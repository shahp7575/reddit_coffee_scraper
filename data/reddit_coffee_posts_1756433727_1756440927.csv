1n2xmcj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1n2xmcj/aio_my_friend_got_upset_and_said_that_im_being/,"AIO? My friend got upset and said that I’m being disrespectful, cause i was on video call for couple of minutes when i walked in to her house, as she invited me for breakfast.","I went over to a close friend’s place for breakfast — she invited me for breakfast. ( basically she sent a photo after I’ve asked what she is doing, I said it looks yummy and she said if I want I can come over for breakfast. We live in the same building) 
Literally one minute before I entered her home, I got a FT call from my niece, she lives abroad, so for her it was already 9:30 pm
We had previously agreed to talk once she got home that evening (it was already late there). I wasn’t planning on talking long — just catching up briefly.

When I walked in, my friend was busy — she was either on a work call or recording a voice message and went to another room. So I stayed in the kitchen and kept talking to my niece for a couple more minutes.

Then my friend came back, asked if I wanted milk for my coffee, and suddenly started getting visibly irritated as I was still on the phone. 
She said I was being disrespectful — that she was cooking breakfast for me and I just came over to “eat” and that I was talking to someone on the phone, not work or emergency related in her house, not to actually spend time with her. She said it felt like I didn’t value her effort or our time together.

I was caught off guard. I told her I hadn’t meant anything disrespectful at all, and that I was about to hang up in a minute. She started being mad and I said that I’m not having this conversation as this is such a small thing and I came to my bf and not some random person and I would be perfectly fine if she did same to me. Then she kept telling me same thing and basically fighting with me over this and I said that I can just leave if she felt disrespected. That made her more upset — she said that the fact I was ready to leave instead of “working through it” that I’m being more disrespectful. 

We argued a bit more. I mentioned that question of respect is quite sensitive for her( she usually have fights with people that starts from question of respect) - to which she answered that of course she is— and that I found it difficult to accept that my short call with my niece was interpreted as some kind of offense.
After some more arguing I said that I’m not having this whole conversation and just left. 
Later, she started messaging me about this whole thing 
One of my messages was that if I would do this consistently I would get it that I’m being disrespectful and this conversation would definitely have a point. 
Than she responded 
“ well it’s not consistently happening, so it’s not the problem…. I’m making a tragedy out of it… 
ended the conversation with something like “whatever” and next one “go read a book for young ladies” — which came across as a passive-aggressive jab rather than a real resolution. 
That she sent another message that it’s not a big problem for her, rather a question or respect and attention. And that if we truly understand each other that would have been enough if I’ve accepted the fact that I’m wrong instead of explaining, why it’s wrong that she felt that way. 
I just didn’t respond. 
Cause all my previous messages was basically telling her that from my perspective of view it’s not a big deal and I don’t want to fight over it and that I’m not planning to explain myself and apologize for it, as I don’t think I did something wrong. 
We don’t really fight with her. We know each other for like 5 years already. Both are 30yo.
for me this whole thing is not worth to start a fight and I wouldn’t even noticed it.  
Usually I’m the one who says sorry to everyone and tries to fix up even if I’m right, but lately I’ve decided that I’m done with it. 

Now I’m wondering:
Was I really being disrespectful?
Should I try to reconnect and talk it through again — or give it space and see if she reaches out?

1n2xlr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/awareness_series/comments/1n2xlr5/the_mirror_of_perception_when_everyone_seems/,"The Mirror of Perception: When Everyone Seems Flawed, Look Within 🪞","
Have you ever found yourself in a room full of people, silently cataloging everyone's shortcomings? One person talks too much, another seems lazy, someone else appears selfish, and yet another strikes you as utterly clueless. If this sounds familiar, you're not alone. But here's a thought-provoking question: what happens when literally everyone around you seems to have problems?

## The Art of Selective Vision 👁️

Our brains are fascinating pattern-recognition machines. They're constantly scanning our environment, making judgments, and filing away observations. Sometimes, we notice genuine issues that deserve attention. When we spot a specific problem in someone we care about, addressing it directly can be incredibly valuable.

Think about it: if your friend consistently shows up late and it's affecting their relationships, a gentle conversation might help them realize the impact of their behavior. If a colleague struggles with a particular skill that's hindering their success, offering support or feedback could be transformative.

This kind of targeted observation and communication serves everyone well. It builds stronger relationships, improves workplace dynamics, and helps people grow.

## The Universal Flaw Detector 🔍

But what about those moments when everyone seems problematic? When your internal critic goes into overdrive, and suddenly every person you encounter appears to have serious issues? This is where things get interesting, and it's time for some honest self-reflection.

When our perception shifts from noticing occasional problems to seeing universal flaws, we might be experiencing what psychologists call projection or a cognitive bias. Essentially, our internal state begins coloring everything we see around us.

## The Science Behind Our Judgments 🧠

Research in cognitive psychology shows us that our mood, stress levels, and personal struggles significantly influence how we perceive others. When we're feeling critical, anxious, or dissatisfied with ourselves, we tend to notice and magnify similar qualities in everyone around us.

Consider these scenarios:

**The Stressed Professional**: After a particularly challenging week at work, Sarah finds herself irritated by every colleague. Tom's enthusiasm seems fake, Lisa's questions appear stupid, and even the friendly janitor strikes her as intrusive. Sarah's stress is creating a lens through which everyone looks problematic.

**The Perfectionist Parent**: David, struggling with his own sense of inadequacy as a father, begins seeing poor parenting everywhere. At the playground, every other parent seems either too permissive or too strict. His own insecurities are manifesting as judgment toward others.

**The Relationship Doubter**: After a minor argument with her partner, Michelle suddenly notices relationship problems everywhere she looks. Her friends' marriages seem dysfunctional, her coworkers appear unhappy, and even happy couples on TV strike her as fake.

## The Internal Weather System ⛅

Our internal emotional state acts like a weather system, influencing everything we observe. When we're experiencing our own storms, the world outside appears darker and more threatening. When we're at peace internally, we tend to notice more positive qualities in others.

This isn't about toxic positivity or pretending problems don't exist. It's about recognizing when our perception might be skewed by our internal state.

## Practical Steps for Better Perception 🛠️

### 1. The 24-Hour Rule ⏰
When everyone seems problematic, implement a 24-hour waiting period before making any judgments or taking action. Often, after a good night's sleep or some time to decompress, our perspective shifts dramatically.

### 2. The Three-Person Check ✅
If you find yourself frustrated with three or more people in a single day, pause and ask yourself what's happening internally. Are you tired? Stressed? Dealing with personal challenges? This simple check can prevent unnecessary conflicts.

### 3. The Energy Audit 🔋
Regularly assess your physical and emotional energy levels. Low energy often correlates with increased irritability and negative perception. Prioritize sleep, nutrition, and stress management to maintain clearer judgment.

### 4. The Gratitude Reset 🙏
When caught in a cycle of finding fault with everyone, deliberately look for one positive quality in each person you encounter. This exercise rewires your brain to notice strengths alongside weaknesses.

### 5. The Context Consideration 🎭
Remember that everyone you meet is fighting battles you know nothing about. That ""rude"" cashier might be dealing with a sick family member. That ""incompetent"" coworker might be struggling with personal issues affecting their performance.

## The Ripple Effect of Self-Awareness 🌊

When we develop the habit of looking inward during periods of universal criticism, remarkable things happen:

**Better Relationships**: We stop damaging relationships with unfair judgments and instead address our own needs that might be creating the negative perception.

**Improved Decision-Making**: Clear perception leads to better choices about who to trust, when to speak up, and how to navigate social situations.

**Enhanced Empathy**: Understanding our own biases makes us more compassionate toward others' struggles and limitations.

**Personal Growth**: Regular self-examination accelerates our own development and emotional maturity.

## Building Your Internal Compass 🧭

Developing reliable self-awareness takes practice, but it's one of the most valuable skills you can cultivate. Here are some daily practices:

**Morning Check-ins**: Start each day with a brief assessment of your emotional state. Are you feeling optimistic, stressed, tired, or energized? This awareness will help you interpret your reactions to others throughout the day.

**Evening Reflection**: Before bed, review any strong reactions you had to other people. Were they justified, or might your internal state have influenced your perception?

**Stress Monitoring**: Learn to recognize your personal stress signals. Do you get impatient? Critical? Withdrawn? Understanding your patterns helps you catch biased perception early.

**Energy Management**: Pay attention to how hunger, fatigue, and other physical states affect your judgment of others. Simple self-care often resolves what seemed like everyone else's problems.

## The Long-Term Perspective 🔮

This principle of looking inward when everyone seems flawed isn't just useful today—it's timeless wisdom that will remain relevant regardless of how society changes. Human nature, with its tendency toward projection and bias, remains constant even as technology and culture evolve.

Four hundred years from now, people will still experience stress, fatigue, and personal challenges that color their perception of others. They'll still benefit from the practice of self-reflection when caught in cycles of universal criticism.

## Real-World Applications 💼

### In the Workplace
Instead of labeling all your colleagues as incompetent during stressful periods, recognize when your own pressure is creating negative perception. This leads to better teamwork and fewer unnecessary conflicts.

### In Relationships
When your partner, friends, and family all seem irritating simultaneously, it's usually time for self-care rather than relationship counseling for everyone else.

### In Parenting
Children are incredibly sensitive to our emotional states. When all the kids in your child's class seem problematic, consider whether your stress or fatigue is influencing your perception.

### In Social Settings
That party where everyone seemed boring or annoying? You might have attended while emotionally depleted, creating a lens that filtered out positive interactions.

## The Balance Point ⚖️

The goal isn't to never notice problems in others or to dismiss all criticism as projection. Some people do have genuine issues that need addressing. The key is developing the wisdom to distinguish between:

- Legitimate concerns that warrant direct communication
- Universal criticism that signals the need for self-reflection

This balance comes with practice and honest self-assessment.

## Moving Forward with Clarity 🚀

Next time you find yourself surrounded by apparently flawed individuals, remember this simple framework: specific problems with specific people often deserve attention, but universal problems with everyone usually point inward.

This shift in perspective doesn't just improve your relationships—it transforms your entire experience of the world. Instead of living in a reality populated by difficult people, you begin to see a world full of complex individuals, each doing their best with their current circumstances and capabilities.

Your perception becomes more accurate, your relationships more harmonious, and your personal growth more accelerated. All because you learned to use the mirror of self-reflection when everyone else seemed to need fixing.

The next time you notice flaws in someone specific, go ahead and have that conversation. But when everyone seems flawed, head to the nearest mirror—internal or otherwise—and start the most important conversation of all: the one with yourself.

*Finding strength in our invisible struggles* 💪

## The Stumble That Everyone Notices 👀

Have you ever noticed how quickly people spot when someone trips or stumbles? A slight misstep on the sidewalk, a wobble while carrying groceries, or even just looking tired after a long day - somehow, everyone seems to have their eyes trained on these moments of visible vulnerability.

It's fascinating, isn't it? We live in a world where external signs of struggle are immediately apparent to those around us. A bandaged arm gets sympathy. Crutches earn understanding. A visible cast prompts offers of help.

But what about the weight that doesn't show?

---

## The Invisible Load We All Bear 🎒

Every single person walking past you today is carrying something invisible. It might be:

• **Financial stress** that keeps them awake at night, calculating bills on repeat
• **Relationship challenges** that drain their emotional energy throughout the day  
• **Health concerns** that create constant background anxiety
• **Career pressures** that make every Monday feel like climbing a mountain
• **Family responsibilities** that stretch them thin across multiple generations
• **Personal dreams deferred** that whisper ""what if"" during quiet moments

These aren't abstract concepts - they're real, tangible pressures that affect how we move through our days, how we make decisions, and how much energy we have left for the people we care about.

---

## Why We Focus on the Visible 🔍

There's a psychological reason we're drawn to obvious signs of difficulty while missing the deeper struggles. Our brains are wired to process visual information quickly - it's a survival mechanism that served our ancestors well. When someone limps, we immediately understand they need space or assistance.

But emotional and mental loads? They require deeper observation, genuine curiosity about others' lives, and the kind of attention that goes beyond surface-level interactions.

Think about your own experience. When was the last time someone asked not just ""How are you?"" but ""What's weighing on your mind lately?"" The difference between these questions is profound.

---

## The Daily Reality Check ⚖️

Let's get practical about this. Right now, as you're reading this, you probably have:

**Immediate pressures:** Bills to pay, deadlines to meet, appointments to keep, people depending on you for various things.

**Medium-term concerns:** Career decisions, relationship dynamics, health maintenance, financial planning that extends beyond this month.

**Long-term weight:** Dreams you're working toward, fears about the future, responsibilities that will only grow with time.

This isn't pessimistic thinking - it's realistic acknowledgment of adult life. Every functional person manages multiple layers of responsibility and concern simultaneously.

---

## The Art of Invisible Strength 💎

Here's what's remarkable about human beings: we've become incredibly skilled at managing enormous amounts of internal pressure while maintaining normal external appearances. This is actually a superpower, though we rarely recognize it as such.

Consider your own capabilities:
- You handle complex emotional situations while maintaining professional composure
- You solve problems constantly without anyone noticing the mental effort involved
- You make hundreds of small decisions daily that keep your life functioning
- You adapt to changing circumstances with resilience that would amaze your younger self

---

## Practical Ways to Lighten the Load ⚡

**1. Acknowledge Your Own Weight**
Start by simply recognizing what you're carrying. Make a mental (or actual) list of your current concerns. This isn't complaining - it's inventory management for your life.

**2. Identify What's Actually Yours to Carry**
Some burdens belong to other people. Some problems aren't actually problems yet. Some worries are about situations completely outside your control. Learning to distinguish between these categories is life-changing.

**3. Use Time-Boxing for Worry**
Give yourself 15 minutes daily to actively think about your concerns. When worries pop up outside this time, remind yourself: ""I'll address this during my designated time.""

**4. Share Strategic Information**
You don't need to tell everyone everything, but having 2-3 people who understand your actual situation (not just your public persona) creates support networks that actually support.

**5. Celebrate Invisible Victories**
Nobody applauds when you successfully manage anxiety, make a difficult decision, or handle a complex family situation with grace. Learn to acknowledge these wins yourself.

---

## Building Awareness in Daily Interactions 🤝

**At Work:**
Instead of ""Busy day?"" try ""What's the most challenging part of your project right now?""

**With Friends:**
Replace ""Everything good?"" with ""What's taking up most of your mental energy these days?""

**With Family:**
Move beyond ""How was school/work?"" to ""What felt heavy today, and what felt light?""

These questions invite real conversation and demonstrate that you're paying attention to the person, not just their visible circumstances.

---

## The Ripple Effect of Recognition 🌊

When someone acknowledges the weight you're carrying - really sees it - something shifts. The burden doesn't disappear, but it becomes more manageable. This recognition:

• Validates that your struggles are real and significant
• Reduces the additional stress of feeling invisible or misunderstood  
• Creates connection based on authentic human experience rather than surface-level pleasantries
• Reminds you that strength isn't about carrying everything alone

---

## Creating Space for Heavy Things 🏠

In your daily routine, build in small pockets of time that acknowledge your inner experience:

**Morning:** Spend 5 minutes identifying what feels heavy today and what support you might need.

**Midday:** Check in with yourself - are you carrying anything that belongs to someone else?

**Evening:** Acknowledge something difficult you handled well, even if nobody else noticed.

This isn't therapy - it's basic maintenance for a complex life.

---

## The Long View: What Really Matters 🔭

Four hundred years from now, the specific details of our individual struggles will be forgotten. But the fundamental human experience of carrying invisible weight while maintaining visible strength? That will be exactly the same.

Future generations will face their own versions of financial stress, relationship complexity, health concerns, and the gap between their inner experience and outer appearance. What we can offer them is the wisdom that:

- Everyone is carrying more than they show
- Strength includes asking for help when needed
- Small gestures of recognition have outsized impact
- The ability to function while managing internal complexity is remarkable and worthy of respect

---

## Today's Action Plan ✅

**Right Now:**
Take 30 seconds to acknowledge one invisible burden you're currently managing. Give yourself credit for handling it.

**This Week:**
Ask one person in your life about something they're working through internally, not just how they appear to be doing.

**This Month:**
Identify one weight you're carrying that might not actually be yours to bear, and explore ways to set it down.

**Ongoing:**
Practice seeing the invisible strength in others, especially when they stumble visibly. Remember that the stumble is often the smallest part of what they're managing.

---

## The Bottom Line 💫

Everyone you meet is fighting battles you know nothing about. Everyone you love is carrying weight you may never fully understand. Everyone you work with is managing internal complexity while trying to appear competent and capable.

This isn't a call for constant emotional excavation or turning every interaction into deep conversation. It's simply an invitation to remember that visible struggles are just the tip of the iceberg.

The next time you see someone stumble - literally or figuratively - you might choose to notice not just the momentary instability, but the incredible strength it takes to keep walking forward despite everything else they're carrying.

Because that strength? It's worth seeing. It's worth acknowledging. And it's worth celebrating, even when - especially when - nobody else is looking.

---

**Remember:** Your invisible load is real. Your quiet strength is remarkable. And you're doing better than you think you are. 🌟

**RECAP**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/WuHcrAG5Ry): **September 13, 2024**

I'm honestly a mess and I don't know what to do, so any advice would be appreciated.

I (27m) and my husband (37m) have been married for 3 years, dating for six. He has an ex-wife (37f) which he divorced a year before we met. We have a son (7m) who was adopted after we got married and who I love as my own child, because he is.

I know my husband, Peter (fake name) is bisexual, I have no problem with it and I had no problem with his ex-wife, Allison (also fake name), I did have a problem with his family as they're a bit homophobic and are always telling Peter he should get back together with Allison. Well, two weeks ago, we were at his family's town because it was my son, Jack's (fake name) birthday and we wanted to spend it as family. My mother in law, decided it would be a good a idea to invite Allison so she arrived in the middle of the party, I didn't want to ruin Jack's birthday so I stayed quiet. I spent all my time with Jack, playing with him and his cousins at his request.

When it was time to cut the cake, I noticed Allison and Peter weren't there, so I went inside and looked for them around the house. I found them in Peter's old bedroom taking their clothes off. I stood there in shock for a moment but then I left and went back to celebrating Jack's birthday. Part of me wanted to scream and cry but I also was in shock and I refused to make Jack's birthday about me. We cut the cake and opened the presents, people were already leaving when Allison and Peter came back. Peter took me aside and started saying that I shouldn't have cut the cake without him present and it was disrespectful. I stared at him and just said ""I'm sorry, I just thought you'd be too busy getting into your ex-wife's pants"".

He got quiet so I took Jack and left the house to go back to the hotel. Once I put Jack in bed and made sure he was asleep, I locked myself in the bathroom and broke down. I called a friend and he tried his best to console me. I only calmed down in the morning when I took Jack for breakfast because I didn't want him to see me like that. I'm now watching him play in the park and I don't want him to suffer, I don't want him to have a broken family, I don't want him to know that relationships aren't a happy ever after. Peter has been calling and texting, apologizing for everything and I'm tempted to forgive him, I'm tempted to just have my family back, and all my friends are saying that it wad just a mistake, that he was vulnerable and Allison is his ex wife. So what am I supposed to do now? I need the advice from people who don't know my husband or me personally.

Please, any advice is helpful.

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/klewnQc4jQ): **September 14, 2024 (next day)**

Well, first of all, I want to thank you all for your advice and I want to explain some things before the actual update. But thank you for opening my eyes about my situation.

1. Peter and Allison didn't notice me when I saw them. There was music very loud downstairs and they weren't facing the door.

2. I didn't stop them because I was in shock, I just stood there for a moment and I heard my son so I unconsciously focused on him. I was pretty much in autopilot.

3. Peter didn't come to the hotel with me because I changed to a different one, he did try to follow me but I took a taxi and left. As far as I know, he's staying with his parents and Allison left.

4. We met when I was 20 and he was 30, we started as friends, and we ended up dating. Yes, we're both men and no, I didn't feel manipulated or groomed by him.

Those were the most asked things and I did answer some comments, not all. Now onto the update.

I did as some of you said and took some tests to discard any STIs or STDs, the results are coming back in a few days, and I will take another one in three weeks to be sure. My son is having a sleepover with a friend and I decided to speak with my husband.

He came by our house after a few minutes I texted him, he asked about Jack and I told him where he was, then we sat on the couch and started talking. I started crying after a few minutes and he followed after. I asked some simple questions ""When? Why? How many times?"" Among others, and this is what I could figure out by all the things he said: It happened for the first time when he visited his parents alone two years ago, they invited her, they both got drunk, he was feeling lonely as I had been more attention to Jack since we adopted him, and they slept together. Nothing happened again until our sons birthday party, he said his mother pressured him a bit and he caved in. I don't believe he did it for that reason but I don't know. He said he doesn't love her and I believe him but it doesn't negate the fact of what he did.

After talking for a while, I told him that I wanted a divorce. He started sobbing and begging for another chance but I told him that I can't give him another chance because I wouldn't be able to trust him again and I don't want that in a relationship. He kept crying and begging for another thirty minutes until I told him that we have to think about Jack and his well being, that we could stay friends ds and coparent him. He got mad, really mad. He started yelling that it was all Jack's fault, that we shouldn't have adopted him, that he's the one who's getting between us. I was crying and really scared, I had never seen him this angry. He hit the table and stormed out of the house.

I called the house where Jack is staying at and told them if Peter shows up there, they can't open the door. After the little episode, I was scared that Peter would try to hurt Jack. I called my friend again, Thomas, and told him everything that happened. He came by and is staying with me until I'm better. Right now, I'm trying to figure out what to do and how to go on with the divorce.

&nbsp;

[Update #2](https://new.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fp15ug/2_update/): **September 25, 2024 (11 days later)**

Hi again. Sorry for taking so long to update but it's been a chaotic week and I'm pretty shaken up but I'll try to summarize it.

My husband has been showing up at my work, following me, and calling me from burner phones. I was afraid he'd go after Jack like many of you said he would, but he didn't. He said a lot of stuff but I'll try to write the important things.

He said that he missed when we were just us, that I stopped paying attention to him when we adopted that Jack, that I wasn't his, anymore. He said that he missed how dependent I was on him, I was very insecure when we met but I started working on my issues when we adopted Jack because I didn't want to be a bad example for him. When we got married, I used to get sick all the time, I was weak and tired, so he would take care of me 24/7. The doctors couldn't tell what was wrong with me and I didn't get better until a bit after we adopted Jack. I guess that dependence it's what he missed?

Yesterday, he followed me to work and started screaming that I was his and that we made vows to stay together, we had to call security and he waited for me next to my car. I panicked and took a taxi home.

He keeps messaging me and showing up to our house, I took a few weeks off work to be with Jack although he's taking this better than me. I made an appointment with a therapist for him and when the divorce is finalized, I'll go to one myself.

I've been debating what to do, so I'll update when something happens.

[Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/nkLmaQS4br): **November 5, 2024 (1.5 months later)**

Hi guys, this is the final update for anyone who is interested, I'm only doing this update to give it some closure and because some people messaged me to ask for it. So here it is.

This has been a really difficult time but I'm almost divorced, I have primary custody of Jack, and I've got a restriction order against Peter and Allison. I'll try to be quick but a lot happened.

So, after I made the post, Peter kept calling and stalking me, I didn't know what to do until I started packing Peter's stuff and I found a box of pictures of me before we met, like three or four years before we met, while he was still married to Allison. I never knew why they got divorced, he just said it was too painful to talk about so I never asked, but I swallowed my anger and sent Allison a message to ask her about the pictures and she told me that they got divorced because she saw him stalking my Facebook several times and found the same box I did. He called it an innocent crush and curiosity but she thought he was cheating on her and they got divorced, a year later, he met me, but Allison always thought that I was the side piece.

I read a few comments saying that I maybe was sick because he was making me sick, I don't know if that's possible, I don't really know. I mean, the illness were bad enough to make me stay in bed, like having a bad cold, but I don't know, I stopped digging. After I found the pictures, I confronted Peter without Jack in the house and he seemed, I don't know, proud? He kept smiling and saying that all he did was for us, that it was love at first sight, and we were destined, he was just making sure it happened. Apparently, we had met before we became friends, I remember meeting him at a party through some friends but we met before, as teenagers. He and I lived in close by towns and my school made some trips to the towns nearby and we met on one of those trips. We were something like friends but only for a summer because he went to college and I soon forgot about him, but he found my Facebook, and the story continued. I was horrified, to say the least, he tried to console me and tell me that it was fine, that he did it out of love, and that if only we hadn't adopted Jack, everything would be fine.

I was bawling my eyes out, my entire marriage was a lie. He said that he only slept with Allison because he knew that it would get my attention and that we didn't have to go through with the divorce, that I know he loves me and that's it. He promised to be a better dad for Jack if I made more time for him. He told me to quit my job because he earned enough to take care of all of us and that would give me more time with him. I was in shock and then he hugged, calming me down. I admit that for a moment, I allowed him to hold me, I allowed myself to consider his proposal, but I kept thinking about his lies, it wasn't about the cheating, it was the stalking, the lies, the obsession, it creeped me out so I tried to pull away and tell him I'd go through with the divorce. He refused, he hugged me tighter and screamed that I needed him, that he could protect me, he could take care of me, he could save me, that I was his husband and only his. I was terrified, I slapped him and pulled away, yelling at him to get out of my house. He didn't. He just kept screaming and holding onto me until a neighbor heard the commotion and called the police. I filed a restriction order and been taking care of Jack since.

During the divorce proceedings, Peter asked for 50-50 custody, which surprised me because in all this time, he hasn't cared about seeing Jack, but I later found out that it was only because he would get to see me and talk to me regularly. He's been contesting every single thing about the divorce, trying to make it last longer than it has, and it's been working. He offered to give me child support even though we have 50-50 custody, he allowed me to keep the house, and other stuff.

So, that's what's been going on in my life, the only happy thing that happened was Halloween, Jack insisted on dressing up as Spiderman and me dressing up as Tony Stark so we did and I took him Trick or Treating, it was the most adorable sight ever and I knew I made the right choice with him and Peter.

I'm sorry for such a long post but this will probably be the last update, thank you so much for the advice and for hearing me rant.

&nbsp;

[Update #4](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/yVb3s3XIhK): **April 20, 2025 (5.5 months later)**

I know I said that my last update would be the final but I'm so very confused right now.

So, we're finishing with the divorce proceedings but Peter's attitude has given a 180° and I don't know if I'm crazy or what. The last time I posted here, Peter was basically saying that our son was the reason for our divorce and only wanted custody of him to see me. We'll, now he's being father of the year. A friend of mine, Dean (fake name) is handling the drops and pick ups of Jack so that I don't see Peter, at first he was mad and called me because he thought he and I were dating, then he didn't care.

Now, I thought that he would treat Jack badly and I kept a very close on him, asked him questions about his father, how everything was going, etc. Jack told me that he's been acting like the perfect Dad, he's nice, he plays with him, helps him, and is completely different from before. I have talked to Peter and he told me he was going to therapy, which I'm happy for, and he has messaged me, apologized, and told me that we should try couples therapy. I declined and he hasn't asked again but he wants us to meet up at his house tomorrow to discuss everything that happened, he said it was part of his therapy.

I haven't gone to therapy, I can't afford it right now, but Jack is. I can't say I don't miss Peter because he was a great partner and husband before everything went down, but I don't trust him after all that happened. So, I don't know what to say to him tomorrow or how to express how I feel about it.

Is it wrong to miss him? I mean, this whole thing happened because he slept with someone else and I know that he hasn't seen Allison and won't be seeing her again because she's also done. Should I just move past it? Jack is also saying that he misses the three of us together, he's cried to me about it more times than I can count and asks why I can't forgive his dad. What the hell am I supposed to do? To feel?

It's a short update. I guess that I'm just trying to vent without judgement from the people I know and give an update to those who asked it. Thanks again for all the support I received in my other posts.

&nbsp;

[Update #5](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/XNz6oCHCP9): **April 29, 2025 (nine days later)** 

Okay, I'm going to clear up a few things before I give you the actual update, I don't answer comments, I prefer to answer every question here instead of answering the same question separately.

1 - I should've explained ir better but my restriction order was a temporal one, only for 30 days. 

2 - Peter was a very good husband. I read that he was abusive all throughout our relationship, he wasn't. And he was a good dad to Jack. Everything went to hell when I caught him cheating. 

3 - What Jack was saying wasn't told by Peter, I talked to him and I made sure, he just has been missing our life before. 

4 - Peter would NEVER touch Jack like some of you suggested. My case may make it seem like he could, but he never even touched me or groomed me. I did talk to Jack, just to make sure, and he reassured me nothing happened.

Now, onto the update. I did meet with Peter, most of you told me not to go to his apartment so I told him to meet at a park, take a walk, or something. When I saw him, he was different. He looked very depressed and he hugged me when he saw me. He wouldn't stop apologizing for what happened.

We started talking and walking, he didn't justify what he said or did, but he did say he regrets it. He said that he misses me and misses being together. I asked about Allison and he told me that he cut her and his parents out, which I believe he did, and then I asked about what he said about Jack. He basically said that he resented Jack for a long time because my attention wasn't on him anymore, and it was selfish, but he was too used to be the center of my world so when it suddenly changed, he couldn't take it. He told me he loves Jack but that he sustains that if giving him up meant to have me back, he would do it in a heartbeat.

We talked for hours while Jack was with my friend, I cried a lot, there were things I decided not to ask like if he was drugging me like some of you said, because I honestly don't want to know. We have been texting these past days, mostly about Jack, but I'm considering family therapy, mostly to help Jack cope with everything. The divorce is still happening which Peter wasn't too happy about but he wasn't angry anymore, just sad.

I also recently met a guy in a coffee shop and we have been texting a lot so I'll see how that turns out. And that's it for the moment, I'll update you guys if you have many questions or if something else happens.

#----NEW UPDATE----

**Editor’s note: the final update was recovered with Arctic Shift**

[Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/6zaO6h2ATU): **August 22, 2025 (nearly four months later)**

Final Update: WIBTA for not forgiving my husband for cheating on me with his ex-wife

Hi, guys! Sorry for taking so long to update, a lot has been going on and I forgot about the account but today is my cake day so I decided to give one last update. And this time is really final unless something extreme happens and I need advice again.

In the last post I talked about Peter and I talking, Jack doing better, and I mentioned I met someone.

We have been going to family therapy Peter, Jack, and I, and Peter has gone to individual therapy and so has Jack. They're both doing better. It was better explained to Jack the terms of the divorce, I didn't mention the cheating, Peter did, but we told him that we loved him and this didn't mean we wouldn't see him as much.

The divorce was finalized a few weeks ago and Peter ended up moving back with us, it was a mutual decision, as we both thought it would be stupid to pay for two different housings and have Jack move around, we wanted to give him some stability,  I've actually reduced my work hours to spend more time with Jack and we're seeing if I can become a Stay At Home Dad for a while.

The guy I met, we had been seeing other a bit here and there, he's a really nice guy, but then I learned he was a friend of Peter's, none of us knew who the other was, and I decides to cut it off to avoid uncomfortable meetings or anything like that.

My relationship with Peter has improved, the divorce is finalized, don't worry about that, but he has been putting a lot of effort into making it up to me and Jack. He has destroyed all the pictures, as far as I'm aware, and he promised to never do anything like that again. I believe him, people may call me naive for that, but he seems sincere.

One of the questions I was asked the most after one of my updates is that why I had been so insecure and vulnerable at the start of our relationship that I ended up dating a man so much older than me. Well, I don't have a good relationship with family since I came out and I have very to almost no friends so when I met Peter, I fell in love almost instantly. He's charming and nice and sweet. I was just smitten.

So that's the update, I don't know if this is good or bad or whatever, I'll answer questions in the comments this time because, like I said, I won't make an update and I don't want people to stay worried or misinterpret things. Thank you a lot for the support and advice.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** How did you meet on a school trip as teenagers when your husband is ten years older than you? If it was the summer before he left for college, weren't you 8 years old?

> **OOP:** No, he was already in college, he just left again. He was spending the summer at his hometown, sorry for not explaining better.

**OOP clarifies on how Peter had the pictures before he left for college**

> **OOP:** He had pictures from before I thought we met when I was 20. And he was already in college, he was just spending the summer in his hometown, we met in the summer when I was about fourteen. I'm sorry for the messy writing, English isn't my first language.

## 🌍 The One Thing Money Can't Buy

In our world of endless inequality, where the gap between the wealthy and the struggling continues to widen, there exists one profound truth that levels the playing field for everyone. It's a reality so fundamental that it shapes how we should view success, failure, and the very meaning of our existence.

## 💰 When Wealth Becomes a Barrier to Empathy

Picture this scenario: A billionaire sits in their ivory tower, looking down at the masses below. They've accumulated more wealth than entire nations, built empires that span continents, and wielded power that influences governments. Yet, in their bubble of privilege, something disturbing often happens – they begin to lose touch with the struggles of ordinary people.

We've all witnessed it. The wealthy individual who suggests that poverty is simply a choice. The executive who claims that anyone can become successful if they just ""work harder."" The inheritance recipient who believes their advantages are purely the result of their own merit.

But here's where reality delivers its most powerful lesson.

## ⚖️ The Ultimate Reality Check

There exists one force in this universe that doesn't discriminate based on bank account balances, social status, or family connections. This force doesn't care if you own private jets or struggle to pay rent. It doesn't check your credit score or ask about your portfolio performance.

This universal equalizer ensures that no amount of money can buy immunity from the fundamental human condition. It's the one experience that connects every person who has ever lived – from ancient emperors to modern tech moguls, from street sweepers to world leaders.

## 🎭 The Mockery That Never Comes

Imagine if this weren't the case. Picture a world where wealth could purchase exemption from life's ultimate reality. The consequences would be devastating for human empathy and social cohesion.

In such a world, the privileged would likely develop an even more twisted perspective on inequality. They might begin to view those who face life's inevitable challenges as somehow deficient or deserving of their fate. ""Look,"" they might say, ""they couldn't even afford to avoid this basic human experience. Clearly, they didn't work hard enough.""

The mockery would be unbearable. The wealthy would point to those facing universal human struggles and claim it was evidence of personal failure rather than the shared human condition.

## 🌟 Practical Lessons for Daily Living

Understanding this universal truth should fundamentally change how we approach our daily lives:

### 1. 🤝 Cultivate Genuine Empathy
- Remember that everyone you meet is fighting battles you know nothing about
- Don't judge others' circumstances without understanding their full story
- Practice kindness as a default mode of interaction

### 2. 💡 Prioritize What Truly Matters
- Focus on relationships over possessions
- Invest time in experiences rather than just accumulating wealth
- Build memories that will outlast any material achievement

### 3. 🏃‍♀️ Take Action While You Can
- Don't postpone important conversations with loved ones
- Pursue meaningful goals instead of just profitable ones
- Make peace with people you've been in conflict with

### 4. 🌱 Develop Perspective on Problems
- View setbacks as temporary rather than permanent
- Remember that even billionaires face the same fundamental challenges
- Use difficulties as opportunities for growth and connection

## 🎯 Building a Legacy That Matters

Since we all face the same ultimate reality, the question becomes: What kind of impact do we want to make while we're here?

### Short-term Actions:
- Call someone you care about today
- Help a neighbor or coworker with a challenge they're facing
- Express gratitude to people who've made a difference in your life
- Resolve ongoing conflicts instead of letting them fester

### Long-term Vision:
- Create something that will benefit future generations
- Mentor young people who are just starting their journeys
- Build systems that promote fairness and opportunity for all
- Document your wisdom and experiences for others to learn from

## 🔄 The Cycle That Connects Us All

Every generation learns this truth anew. Ancient philosophers wrote about it, medieval scholars contemplated it, and modern thinkers continue to grapple with its implications. Four hundred years from now, humans will still be discovering the same fundamental reality about the equality that exists beneath all our superficial differences.

This continuity across time shows us something beautiful about the human experience. Despite all our technological advances, cultural changes, and social evolution, we remain connected by certain unchangeable truths.

## 🚀 Transforming Society Through Understanding

When we truly grasp this universal equalizer, it has the power to transform how we structure society:

- **Economic Policy**: Recognizing our shared vulnerability should inspire more compassionate approaches to poverty and inequality
- **Healthcare**: Understanding our common humanity can drive us to create systems that serve everyone, not just the privileged
- **Education**: This knowledge should motivate us to provide equal opportunities for learning and growth
- **Justice**: Our legal systems should reflect the fundamental equality that exists beneath surface differences

## 💪 Personal Empowerment Through Acceptance

Rather than feeling depressed by life's ultimate reality, we can find empowerment in it:

### Daily Motivation:
- Every day is a gift that even the wealthiest person can't purchase additional units of
- Your impact on others matters more than your net worth
- Small acts of kindness ripple through time in ways money never could

### Long-term Purpose:
- Build relationships that transcend material considerations
- Create art, write stories, or document experiences that will outlast any fortune
- Invest in causes that address fundamental human needs and struggles

## 🎪 The Absurdity of Extreme Inequality

When viewed through the lens of our shared human condition, extreme wealth inequality reveals itself as somewhat absurd. While one person hoards resources that could feed thousands, they remain subject to the same biological and existential realities as everyone else.

This perspective doesn't diminish the real impact of poverty or the legitimate need for financial security. Instead, it highlights the moral imperative for those with resources to use them wisely and compassionately.

## 🌈 Finding Joy in the Journey

Understanding life's universal equalizer doesn't have to lead to pessimism. Instead, it can inspire us to:

- Celebrate each moment of connection with others
- Find humor in our shared human struggles and triumphs
- Appreciate the simple pleasures that money can't enhance
- Build communities based on mutual support rather than competition

## 🔮 A Message for Future Generations

To those who will read these words centuries from now: The fundamental truths about human equality haven't changed since your ancestors walked this earth, and they won't change in your time either. Technology may advance, societies may evolve, but the core realities of human existence remain constant.

Use this knowledge to build a more compassionate world. Remember that every person you encounter – regardless of their social status, wealth, or achievements – shares the same basic human vulnerabilities and hopes.

## 🎬 The Final Act

In the end, we're all part of the same story. The wealthy executive and the struggling artist, the powerful politician and the quiet teacher – we all face the same ultimate questions about meaning, purpose, and connection.

The sooner we embrace this truth, the sooner we can focus on what really matters: treating each other with dignity, creating positive change while we can, and building a legacy of kindness that transcends any material achievement.

## 🎯 Your Action Plan Starting Today

1. **Morning Reflection**: Begin each day by remembering what truly connects us all
2. **Midday Check**: Ask yourself if your current priorities align with life's deeper truths
3. **Evening Gratitude**: End each day appreciating the people and experiences that matter most
4. **Weekly Service**: Dedicate time each week to helping others, regardless of their social status
5. **Monthly Perspective**: Regularly evaluate whether you're building something meaningful or just accumulating stuff

Remember, the universe's greatest joke isn't on the poor or the struggling – it's on anyone who thinks their wealth makes them fundamentally different from their fellow humans. We're all in this together, facing the same ultimate realities, sharing the same basic needs for connection, purpose, and meaning.

The question isn't whether you'll face life's great equalizer – it's what you'll do with the time you have before then. Will you use it to build bridges or walls? To create connection or division? To spread kindness or maintain indifference?

The choice is yours, but the timeline is universal.

---

*This perspective transcends cultural, economic, and temporal boundaries because it addresses the most fundamental aspect of human existence – our shared vulnerability and the equality that lies beneath all surface differences.*

1n2xbsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualPH/comments/1n2xbsr/how_much_time_do_you_spend_with_someone_during/,How much time do you spend with someone during your first date?,"I’m curious. 

Someone that I have been talking to casually, and flirted a little bit asked me out for coffee. I have school during the day, so I’m only available in the evenings. He happened to be only available during Thursdays, so may pasok pako bukas so I told him we can do coffee but I might have to go home after a few hours (3 at least) so I can do some assignments and get a good sleep. He told me never experienced a short date, and was kind of hoping to spend the whole evening with me. But I told him I need to prioritize my school since I don’t want to procrastinate, and it looks like he doesn’t like it. 

I’m planning to resched our meet up. But based on my experience I went to casual dates before and spent an hour or two, and that usually suffice for both of us. 

Note: This is our first time meeting in person but we’ve been following each other on IG for quite a while. 

Is spending the whole evening for a first casual date so long? Is my proposed length really that short?

1n2x9w3,https://www.reddit.com/r/awareness_series/comments/1n2x9w3/the_partner_who_supports_the_changemaker/,The Partner Who Supports the Change-Maker 🌟,"

When you choose to be with someone who's dedicated to making a real difference in the world, you're signing up for something extraordinary. This isn't your typical relationship playbook – it's about supporting someone whose mission extends far beyond personal comfort zones.

## Understanding the Bigger Picture 🎯

Imagine being with someone whose daily focus isn't just on building a comfortable life together, but on addressing the deeper issues that affect entire communities. When your partner is committed to helping others heal from trauma, break cycles of harm, or create positive change, your relationship becomes part of something much larger.

This means your connection transcends traditional expectations. You're not just thinking about mortgage payments and weekend plans – you're supporting work that impacts countless lives. The person you've chosen sees patterns of suffering that others miss, and feels compelled to act.

## Creating Space for Growth 🌱

Supporting a change-maker requires a fundamental shift in how you approach partnership. Instead of expecting your partner to fit into predetermined roles, you learn to create space for their authentic path to unfold.

This might mean:
- Adjusting your timeline when urgent community needs arise
- Understanding that some evenings will be spent processing difficult conversations
- Accepting that your partner's energy goes toward healing work that can be emotionally draining
- Learning to provide emotional support without taking on their stress as your own

The key is recognizing that your partner's calling isn't competing with your relationship – it's an integral part of who they are.

## Redefining Intimacy and Connection 💝

When your partner works with trauma and healing, it naturally affects how they approach physical and emotional intimacy. Their sensitivity to energy, boundaries, and consent becomes heightened through their work.

This creates opportunities for deeper connection:
- Slower, more mindful approaches to physical intimacy
- Greater emphasis on emotional safety and communication
- Understanding that healing work can make someone more aware of subtle energies
- Learning that true intimacy often requires patience and presence

Rather than seeing this as limitation, it becomes an invitation to explore more conscious forms of connection.

## Managing Your Own Growth Journey 🚀

Being with someone dedicated to positive change inevitably triggers your own growth. You'll find yourself confronting:
- Areas where you might unconsciously hold others back
- Your own unhealed wounds that surface in the relationship
- Tendencies to make everything about your needs and comfort
- Fears about sharing your partner's attention with their important work

This isn't comfortable, but it's transformative. You discover that supporting someone's calling often reveals your own areas for development.

## Practical Daily Support Strategies 🛠️

**Morning Routines:**
Start days with check-ins about energy levels and upcoming challenges. Offer practical support like preparing meals or handling logistics when they have intensive sessions scheduled.

**Emotional Regulation:**
Learn to distinguish between your emotional reactions and theirs. When they come home processing difficult client situations, practice being a calm presence rather than absorbing their stress.

**Boundary Setting:**
Help maintain healthy boundaries around work hours, client emergencies, and personal time. Sometimes change-makers need external reminders to step back and recharge.

**Communication Practices:**
Develop skills in active listening without trying to fix or minimize their experiences. Learn when they need space to process versus when they need your engaged support.

## The Freedom Paradox 🕊️

True partnership with a change-maker requires embracing a paradox: the more space you create for their growth and mission, the more freedom you both experience. This happens because:
- Resentment decreases when you're not constantly pulling them away from their calling
- Authentic connection increases when both people can be fully themselves
- Personal growth accelerates when you're not stuck in limiting patterns
- The relationship becomes energizing rather than draining

## Handling Social Pressures 👥

Society often doesn't understand relationships that don't follow conventional scripts. You might face:
- Questions about why your partner prioritizes their work so highly
- Pressure to pull them back into more traditional roles
- Misunderstanding from friends and family about your dynamic
- Your own doubts about whether you're being ""supportive enough""

Building confidence in your unique partnership requires:
- Clear communication about your shared values
- Strong boundaries with people who don't understand your choices
- Regular check-ins about whether the relationship still serves both of you
- Celebrating the positive impact you're creating together

## Practical Warning Signs to Watch For ⚠️

While supporting a change-maker can be incredibly fulfilling, watch for these red flags:
- Feeling consistently unimportant or neglected
- Your partner using their work to avoid relationship intimacy
- Inability to ever prioritize your needs or the relationship
- Your own life becoming completely subsumed by their mission
- Lack of appreciation for your support and sacrifices

Healthy relationships require balance, even when one partner has an intense calling.

## Building Your Support Network 🤝

Don't try to be your partner's only source of support. Encourage them to maintain:
- Professional supervision or mentoring relationships
- Peer support groups with others doing similar work
- Personal therapy or healing practices
- Regular time with friends outside their work context

Similarly, build your own support network of people who understand your unique relationship dynamic.

## The Long-Term Vision 🔮

Relationships with change-makers often develop in phases:
- Initial attraction to their passion and purpose
- Reality check as you understand the demands of their work
- Growth period as you both learn to balance individual and shared needs
- Integration phase where you find sustainable rhythms
- Mature partnership where you both contribute to positive change

The goal isn't to change your partner or get them to abandon their calling – it's to create a relationship structure that honors both your authentic selves while building something meaningful together.

## Celebrating the Journey 🎉

Remember to acknowledge the extraordinary nature of what you're building together. Your willingness to support someone dedicated to healing and positive change contributes to collective wellbeing in ways that ripple far beyond your immediate relationship.

When you help someone stay grounded and supported in their change-making work, you're participating in healing that affects entire communities. Your behind-the-scenes contributions matter enormously, even when they're not visible to others.

The person who chooses this path – supporting the supporter, holding space for the space-holder – walks a unique journey that requires courage, flexibility, and deep commitment to growth. It's not the easiest path, but for those called to it, it offers meaning and connection that conventional relationships rarely achieve.

Your partnership becomes a demonstration that love can be both deeply personal and broadly transformative – a living example of what becomes possible when people support each other's highest calling rather than trying to diminish it.

I’ve actually been talking to him for a while because we were in the same university group chat, but we just met in person a week ago. He reached out to me first months ago and later told me it was because “I seemed cool and talked a lot.” Our conversations were pretty flirty off the bat, he would tease me and compliment me, ask whether I like his new haircut, etc. We meet irl and he’s a lot less social. He’s still very open with me and talks, but isn’t as flirty. I invited him over to my dorm and to pizza with my family and we just hung out. I told him I was going to go to church the next day with my roommate and he asked if he could come as he was also looking into churches. I said of course and he offered to drive me. My roommate said she needed to “run some errands” and suggested we go to the coffee shop alone. He took me and ended up paying for my coffee and we sat and talked for a bit before walking back over to the church. I invited him back to my dorm that night and he was out with friends but ended up leaving them to come hang out with me. The next few days we ended up going to welcome week events together and I amped up the flirting a bit, but he seemed very oblivious to it. The next morning I get a text of him joking about switching majors (he’s MechE and I’m a physics major, he was joking about switching to physics.) Every welcome week event ended up being late and he would always walk me and my roommate home so we wouldn’t be walking home alone in the dark. This evening he took me to dinner (originally the whole friend group was going to go but it ended up being just us.) He then bought me dinner (or tried to I paid him back for some of it.) and we went to casino night together with a few other friends. I’m realizing that I really like him, and I have for quite awhile now. He seems rather oblivious to the fact that I’m flirting with him and honestly I’m just wondering if I should ask him out directly. I know he doesn’t have a girlfriend, I just don’t know if he likes me in the way that I like him. At the very least we are very good friends, and I don’t want to ruin that by asking him out.

## Key Features Analysis

The modern living room furniture table sets offer a range of features designed to enhance functionality, aesthetics, and durability.

**Material Quality:** The best table sets are constructed from high-quality materials such as solid wood, engineered wood, metal, glass, and stone. Solid wood offers durability and a classic aesthetic, while engineered wood provides a more affordable and sustainable option. Metal frames offer strength and a modern look, while glass tabletops add elegance and visual lightness. Stone tabletops, like marble or granite, provide a luxurious and durable surface.

**Design and Style:** Table sets come in a variety of designs and styles to suit different tastes and interior decor themes. From contemporary and minimalist to traditional and rustic, there's a table set to complement any living room. Consider the shape, size, and finish of the tables to ensure they coordinate with your existing furniture and decor. Common shapes include round, square, rectangular, and oval, each offering different benefits in terms of space utilization and visual appeal.

**Functionality and Versatility:** Many modern table sets offer added functionality, such as lift-top coffee tables with hidden storage compartments, nesting tables that can be easily expanded or stored, and adjustable height tables that can be used for both coffee and dining. These features enhance the versatility of the table set and make it suitable for a variety of activities, from relaxing with a book to entertaining guests.

**Size and Dimensions:** The size and dimensions of the tables are crucial for ensuring they fit comfortably within your living room and provide adequate surface space without overwhelming the area. Consider the size of your sofa, chairs, and other furniture when selecting a table set. A general rule is to choose a coffee table that is approximately two-thirds the length of your sofa and side tables that are roughly the same height as the sofa arms.

**Durability and Stability:** A well-constructed table set should be durable and stable, capable of withstanding daily use without wobbling or tipping over. Look for tables with sturdy legs, reinforced joints, and a solid base. The weight capacity of the tables should also be considered, especially if you plan to place heavy items on them.

**Finish and Maintenance:** The finish of the tables should be durable and easy to maintain. Common finishes include lacquer, varnish, paint, and stain, each offering different levels of protection and aesthetic appeal. Consider the maintenance requirements of the finish when making your selection. For example, glass tabletops require regular cleaning to remove fingerprints and smudges, while wood tabletops may need occasional polishing or waxing to maintain their luster.

*Discovering the relationships that shape our world but remain beautifully nameless*

---

## Introduction: Beyond Labels and Categories 🌟

In our quest to organize and categorize every aspect of human experience, we often encounter connections that refuse to fit neatly into predefined boxes. These relationships exist in the spaces between friendship and family, between professional and personal, between temporary and eternal. They are the connections that make life meaningful, yet paradoxically, they often go unnamed.

## The Mirror-Like Quality: Truth in Relationships ✨

Some connections in our lives possess an extraordinary quality of reflection - not just showing us who we are, but revealing who we can become. These relationships act as honest mirrors, offering feedback without judgment and clarity without harshness.

**Daily Application:**
- Practice active listening with people who matter to you
- Seek feedback from those whose opinions you trust
- Be willing to see yourself through another person's perspective
- Cultivate relationships where honesty flows both ways

Think about that colleague who always tells you the truth about your presentations, or the neighbor who genuinely celebrates your successes without envy. These connections help us navigate life with greater self-awareness and confidence.

## The Purity Factor: Untainted Connections 🌸

Just as flowers bloom without agenda, certain relationships exist without ulterior motives. They represent pure human connection - free from manipulation, competition, or hidden expectations. These bonds remind us that genuine care still exists in our world.

**Practical Steps:**
- Identify relationships in your life that feel effortless and genuine
- Nurture connections where you can be completely yourself
- Recognize when someone accepts you without trying to change you
- Value those who support your dreams without expecting anything in return

Consider the friend who remembers your birthday every year, the mentor who guides you without seeking credit, or the family member who loves you despite your flaws.

## The Time Factor: Precious Moments and Lasting Impact ⏰

Time is our most valuable resource, and certain relationships make every moment count. These connections don't necessarily last the longest, but they leave the deepest impressions. They teach us that quality trumps quantity in human connections.

**Ways to Honor This:**
- Be fully present during meaningful conversations
- Create memorable experiences with people who matter
- Don't postpone important conversations or gestures
- Appreciate the temporary nature of all relationships while fully engaging in them

Whether it's a brief encounter with a stranger who changes your perspective or a lifelong bond that evolves over decades, these connections remind us to treasure each interaction.

## The Delicate Thread: Handling with Care 🧵

Some relationships require gentle handling - not because they're weak, but because they're precious. Like delicate fabric, they need careful attention to maintain their beauty and strength. These connections teach us the art of emotional intelligence and thoughtful communication.

**Nurturing Strategies:**
- Choose your words carefully in sensitive conversations
- Respect boundaries and personal space
- Show appreciation through small, consistent gestures
- Handle conflicts with patience and understanding

Think about relationships with elderly relatives, new friendships, or connections with people going through difficult times. They require extra care and consideration.

## The Essential Breath: Life-Sustaining Connections 💨

Just as breathing is automatic yet vital, some relationships become so integral to our existence that we barely notice them until they're threatened. These are the connections that provide emotional oxygen to our daily lives.

**Recognition and Cultivation:**
- Acknowledge the people who consistently support you
- Don't take reliable relationships for granted
- Express gratitude regularly to those who are always there
- Create systems to maintain contact with essential people in your life

This might include the family member who always answers your calls, the friend who checks on you during tough times, or the colleague who makes work bearable.

## The Beautiful Paradox: Nameless Yet Invaluable 🎭

The most intriguing aspect of these special connections is their resistance to classification. They exist in the beautiful ambiguity of human experience. Perhaps their power lies precisely in their indefinable nature - they can't be reduced to simple terms or expectations.

**Embracing the Unnamed:**
- Stop trying to define every relationship in your life
- Allow connections to evolve naturally without forcing labels
- Appreciate relationships for what they bring rather than what they're called
- Celebrate the unique nature of each human connection

## Modern Challenges to Meaningful Connections 📱

In our digital age, we face unique challenges in forming and maintaining these special relationships:

**Digital Overwhelm:**
- Social media creates illusions of connection without depth
- Constant connectivity can prevent deep, focused relationships
- Virtual relationships may lack the nuance of face-to-face interaction

**Time Poverty:**
- Busy schedules leave little room for relationship cultivation
- Career demands often take priority over personal connections
- Geographic mobility separates us from established relationships

**Solution Strategies:**
- Schedule regular, uninterrupted time with important people
- Choose quality interactions over quantity of contacts
- Use technology to enhance, not replace, real connections
- Prioritize relationships that energize rather than drain you

## Building and Recognizing These Special Bonds 🏗️

Creating meaningful connections doesn't happen by accident. It requires intention, effort, and sometimes courage.

**Foundation Elements:**
- **Authenticity:** Be genuine in your interactions
- **Vulnerability:** Share your real thoughts and feelings
- **Consistency:** Show up regularly, not just during good times
- **Reciprocity:** Give as much as you receive
- **Patience:** Allow relationships to develop naturally over time

**Warning Signs to Avoid:**
- Relationships that consistently drain your energy
- Connections based solely on mutual benefit
- Bonds that require you to compromise your values
- Relationships where growth is discouraged

## The Ripple Effect: How Special Relationships Transform Us 🌊

These unnamed treasures don't just enrich our lives - they transform us. They shape our capacity for empathy, our understanding of love, and our ability to contribute meaningfully to the world.

**Personal Growth Through Connection:**
- We learn patience through challenging relationships
- We develop empathy by truly knowing others
- We discover our own worth through being valued
- We practice forgiveness and acceptance
- We expand our worldview through diverse perspectives

## Practical Daily Applications 📋

**Morning Ritual:**
Start each day by identifying one person you're grateful for and why. Send them a quick message or make a mental note to appreciate them.

**Weekly Check-ins:**
Choose one day each week to reach out to someone who matters to you. No agenda, just connection.

**Monthly Reflection:**
Evaluate your relationships. Are you investing time in connections that truly matter? Are you neglecting important people?

**Annual Assessment:**
Consider which relationships have grown stronger and which may need attention or natural closure.

## The Science Behind Connection 🧠

Research consistently shows that strong relationships contribute to:
- Better physical health and longevity
- Improved mental health and resilience
- Greater life satisfaction and purpose
- Enhanced cognitive function as we age
- Stronger immune system response
- Better stress management

These benefits occur regardless of what we call these relationships or how we categorize them.

## Cultural Perspectives on Unnamed Bonds 🌍

Different cultures recognize various forms of meaningful connection:
- Japanese ""nakama"" - deep friendship and mutual support
- Danish ""hygge"" - cozy togetherness and connection
- Ubuntu philosophy - ""I am because we are""
- Indigenous concepts of extended family and community bonds

These perspectives remind us that meaningful connection transcends cultural boundaries while taking unique forms in different contexts.

## Navigating Life Transitions 🚀

Special relationships often help us navigate major life changes:

**Career Changes:**
The mentor who guides without judgment, the peer who offers honest feedback, the supporter who believes in your potential.

**Personal Growth:**
The friend who accepts your evolution, the family member who loves you through changes, the stranger who offers perspective at the right moment.

**Life Challenges:**
The companion who sits with you in difficulty, the voice of reason during confusion, the steady presence during chaos.

## Creating Space for the Unnamed 🏠

To welcome these special connections into our lives, we must create space for them:

**Physical Space:**
Make your environment welcoming for meaningful conversation and connection.

**Emotional Space:**
Develop the capacity to be fully present with others without distractions.

**Mental Space:**
Clear away preconceptions about what relationships ""should"" look like.

**Time Space:**
Protect time for unstructured interaction and spontaneous connection.

## The Future of Human Connection 🔮

As we move forward in an increasingly complex world, these unnamed treasures become even more valuable. They remind us of our shared humanity and our fundamental need for authentic connection.

**Trends to Watch:**
- Virtual reality creating new forms of distant intimacy
- Artificial intelligence challenging our understanding of relationship
- Global connectivity creating opportunities for worldwide bonds
- Urbanization requiring new approaches to community building

**Timeless Elements:**
Despite technological advancement, the core human needs for authenticity, understanding, acceptance, and mutual support remain constant.

## Conclusion: Celebrating the Unnamed 🎉

Life's most precious connections often defy categorization because they encompass the full complexity of human experience. They are simultaneously simple and profound, temporary and eternal, fragile and strong. By recognizing and nurturing these unnamed treasures, we enrich not only our own lives but contribute to a more connected and compassionate world.

The beauty lies not in naming these relationships but in experiencing them fully. They remind us that the most important things in life often exist in the spaces between words, in the pauses between conversations, and in the connections that need no explanation.

As we navigate our daily lives, let us remain open to these special connections. Let us treat them with the reverence they deserve - not because of what we call them, but because of what they bring to our human experience. In doing so, we honor both the relationships themselves and the beautiful mystery of human connection.

Remember: the most powerful relationships in your life might be the ones you never learned how to name. And perhaps that's exactly as it should be.

I guess I'm writing here because these are words I'll never get to say. 

Why do I like you? We've only just met. Two months in and you've captivated me in a way no one else ever has. Which is both a serendipitous, yet unfortunate situation. Because I'm not sure you could ever feel the same. And I know deep down I stay because I want to lighten your load, if even just in some small way, by making sure the things you need done where I am get done so you don't have to worry about at least one thing.

Sometimes a person can feel like a word.  For me you feel like nostalgia- the sentimental longing or wistful affection for the past, typically for a period or place with happy personal associations.

I guess that is the closest thing that describes the emotion you infuse my senses with. Or, maybe its more accurate to say that that's what you feel like; a place in time I miss most, personified perfectly. 

You remind me of the 90s - not the decade, but the feeling. Maybe, I guess, because the 90s felt like the last truly authentic decade. But it's more than that. The 90s felt almost safe, with a sense of calm, ease, and slow steadiness. Nothing was hurried the way it is now. Things were simpler, mixed with the grunge culture, of course - that raw, honest, angsty, rough around the edges, but oozing with sincerity vibe it gave off. But I like that about you too. 

A time when things felt natural, when people were less afraid, less plugged in, and when meeting someone, and truly connecting with them could happen anywhere, if you were open enough to it. When the anticipation and excitment of having to wait for new things, without it being just a click away, or at the touch of a button, wasn't a choice - which is why it felt more special and significant. 

Sitting with you, having a conversation, about literally anything, makes the urgency of current culture fade into a slow ease, where time doesn't seem to matter anymore, and all the things that are scary and burdening just... fall away. Reality becomes the backdrop, and the singularity of this moment, spent with you, becomes the main event and focus, with everything else becoming the mere, less important ""extra"" in a story that is bigger than anything outside of it.

I don't know if I love you - not yet; but I love how you make me feel.

You make me believe in Ethan Hawke's quote to Winona Ryder in ""Reality Bites,"" when he tells her, ""This is all we need. A couple of smokes, a cup of coffee, and a little bit of conversation. You, and me, and five bucks."" 

And for a messy, chaotic, overthinker like myself, you have been like water to my thirsty soul, and a soft place to land in a world where it never feels entirely safe to rest, even for just a little while.

I guess what I'm really saying, is that you somehow, to me, feel like peace. Like something tranquil, which has seemingly been unattainable for me up until I met you.

It's been a long time since I felt safe with someone the way I feel with you. Or, just safe in general for that matter. I'm a bleeding heart, possibly a little bit of a ham lol but I'll always be a safe place for you too, even if that means we'll never know a connection past friendship. Which is unfortunate, because somehow you feel like the halve of my soul I've been searching for my whole life...well, if you ever change your mind ;) 

By the way, currently, in your absence I've been keeping things in good shape just like I promised.

I hope you got the rest you needed. You deserve it...you deserve a lot more good than what this world has given you, and though I'd give almost anything to be the one who gives that to you, I'll settle for any way you can have it, and I hope that someone someday will give you the same feeling you've given me. 

""I wish you a lifetime of happiness, and the courage to look for it.""

went full nerd mode tracking everything i could think of. food timing (was it the carbs? skipping meals?), caffeine (too much? wrong time?), sleep data from my watch, room temp, when i worked out, stress levels throughout the day. had like 4 different apps going and was making notes in my phone constantly.
felt like i was doing real science but the results were still totally random. some days all the “right” variables lined up and id still crash. other days everything was “wrong” according to my tracking but id feel great. was getting pretty frustrated tbh.

then i noticed something stupidly simple. on days when i drank a big glass of water right after getting up and kept sipping through the morning, i felt way clearer and didnt get that afternoon wall.

started using waterminder to actually track it instead of just assuming i was drinking enough. holy shit the pattern was so obvious once i had data. 16-20oz first thing + steady sips = stable energy. skip the morning rehydration and go straight to coffee? 2pm faceplant guaranteed.

looked it up and apparently we lose a ton of water overnight just from breathing. brain is mostly water so makes sense that timing matters but honestly never thought about it. was so focused on complex stuff i missed the basic thing.

kinda embarrassing how long it took me to connect those dots when the solution was this simple. makes me wonder what other obvious stuff im missing.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Same-Game Parlay Breakdown: Taylor Fritz vs. Jérôme Kym – US Open 2025**  
*Where Underdogs Trip on Shoelaces and Favorites Serve Like Clockwork*

---

**1. Parse the Odds: A Tale of Two Rankings**  
Let’s cut to the chase: Taylor Fritz is here to *Fritz-terize* the competition, while Jérôme Kym is here to *Kym-ically* defy the odds. The numbers don’t lie. Fritz (-1408) is so heavily favored, bookmakers might as well just hand him the trophy now and call it a night. His decimal odds hover around 1.05-1.07, implying a 95%+ chance to win—statistically, this is less a tennis match and more a “safety drill for the crowd.” Kym’s +675 (decimal \~10.5-11.5) means his implied win probability is roughly 8-9%, or about the same chance I have of winning a bet that my coffee will spontaneously brew itself.

The spread? Fritz is -6.5 games, which is as kind as saying “bring an umbrella to a rainstorm.” The total games line is 33.5, straddling the line between “a quick three-set romp” and “a five-set endurance test.” Given Kym’s recent five-set marathon against Brandon Nakashima (which took 4h23m and included a tiebreak where he missed *two* match points), the “Over 33.5” has some spicy underdog appeal. But let’s not forget: Fritz is ranked ATP 4 for a reason.

---

**2. Digest the News: Fresh Off the Five-Set Grind**  
Kym’s journey to this match is the stuff of underdog legends. He just survived a five-set thriller against Nakashima, a player ranked 31st in the world, in a match so grueling it makes a Netflix docuseries look lazy. His mental fortitude? A 10/10. His physical tank? A 7/10 (he’s probably sipping electrolyte drinks in a recovery tub right now). Meanwhile, Fritz is fresh off a relatively stress-free victory, and his resume includes a 2022 US Open semifinal run. He’s the kind of player who makes highlight-reel serves while thinking, “Is this thing on?”

Kym’s lone hope? Hope is a dangerous game, Jerome. Fritz, meanwhile, is the human equivalent of a Swiss watch: precise, reliable, and not here to trip over his ow

*Imagine waking up in a world where every challenge we face today has been solved. Where cities pulse with clean energy, where healing happens through natural harmony, and where every person can discover their true potential. This isn't fantasy – it's the blueprint for humanity's next chapter.*

## 🏙️ The New Urban Revolution

The future holds remarkable possibilities for how we'll live together. Picture cities designed not around profit or control, but around human flourishing and natural harmony. These aren't just improvements to what we have – they represent a complete reimagining of urban life.

Think of these future settlements as giant wheels of opportunity, with central hubs radiating outward like spokes of possibility. From these central points, broad pathways will connect healing centers, learning institutions, and community spaces. Between these main arteries, quiet neighborhoods will nestle alongside parks and recreational areas where families can thrive.

What makes these cities extraordinary isn't their size or technology alone – it's how they integrate the physical and energetic aspects of human life. As these communities develop, they'll become increasingly aligned with natural rhythms and human potential, creating spaces where everyone can access their best life.

## 🏥 Revolutionizing Health and Healing

### The End of Disease As We Know It

The healthcare of tomorrow will bear little resemblance to today's medical system. Instead of treating illness after it appears, these new healing centers will maintain perfect health through natural balance.

**Sound and Color Therapy** 💫  
Practitioners will use specific combinations of sound frequencies and colors to restore physical harmony. Different tones and hues will target specific imbalances, bringing the body back to its natural state of wellness.

**Cellular Regeneration** 🧬  
Lost limbs, damaged organs, and worn tissues will regenerate naturally by activating cellular memory. The body's own blueprint will guide perfect restoration, making permanent disability a thing of the past.

**Light-Based Healing** ✨  
Controlled light frequencies will eliminate cancer, arthritis, and blindness. These gentle treatments will work with the body's natural processes, causing no side effects or trauma.

**Electrical Stimulation** ⚡  
Precise electrical currents will accelerate bone healing and growth. Even specific colors will promote bone regeneration, making fractures heal in days rather than months.

**Aura Reading for Diagnosis** 🌈  
Trained practitioners will read the colors around each person to instantly understand their health status and spiritual development. This non-invasive diagnostic method will catch imbalances before they become problems.

**Musical Medicine** 🎵  
Every musician and composition carries unique healing properties. Orchestras will perform therapeutic concerts, with specific pieces prescribed for different conditions. The marriage of sound and color will create powerful healing combinations.

**Plant-Based Remedies** 🌿  
Synthetic drugs will become obsolete as advanced herbal and flower therapies take their place. These natural medicines will work in harmony with human biology, providing healing without harmful side effects.

## 📚 Education That Unlocks Human Potential

### Discovering Your True Gifts

Education in these future communities will focus on uncovering and developing each person's natural talents rather than forcing everyone into identical molds.

Children will learn practical wisdom alongside creative skills. Instead of memorizing facts for corporate jobs that drain their energy, they'll discover their unique contributions to community well-being. The focus shifts from competition to collaboration, from consumption to creation.

Young people will understand how to work with natural energy, how to maintain their physical and mental balance, and how to contribute meaningfully to society. They'll learn that true success means finding fulfillment while serving others.

### A Curriculum for Life Mastery

**Ethical Communication** 📡  
Students will learn respectful ways to connect directly mind-to-mind, always honoring privacy and consent. This skill will eliminate misunderstandings and create deeper relationships.

**The Golden Principle** 🤝  
Treating others as you'd want to be treated becomes the foundation of all interaction, creating communities based on mutual respect and care.

**Movement Mastery** 🏃  
People will learn to move their bodies efficiently through space, whether by advanced physical techniques or technology that works with natural forces.

**Body Harmony** 🧘  
Understanding how to maintain perfect health through lifestyle, breathing, movement, and mental practices ensures everyone enjoys vibrant well-being.

**Natural Food Production** 🌱  
Growing pure, nourishing food without harmful chemicals becomes a basic life skill, connecting people to the source of their vitality.

**Creative Expression** 🎨  
Art, music, and innovation flourish when people have time and support to explore their creative potential without worrying about basic survival.

**Universal Connection** 🌍  
Understanding our relationship to the larger cosmos and other forms of life prepares humanity for broader participation in galactic community.

## 🔬 Science Aligned with Natural Law

### Beyond Current Limitations

Future scientific research will operate from completely different principles than today's mechanistic approach. Instead of trying to dominate nature, scientists will learn to work harmoniously with universal forces.

Communication with other civilizations will require understanding energy patterns rather than just electromagnetic signals. New codes and frequencies will open channels to connect with beneficial beings throughout the cosmos.

This shift in scientific understanding will revolutionize everything from energy production to space travel, always prioritizing harmony with natural law.

## 🎓 Centers for Human Development

### The Five Stages of Personal Mastery

These future communities will include specialized centers where people can systematically develop their full potential through five progressive stages of growth.

**Stage One: Physical Mastery** 💪  
Learning to manage physical impulses and desires, overcoming addictive patterns, and establishing healthy relationships with food, substances, and sensory pleasures.

**Stage Two: Emotional Balance** ❤️  
Developing emotional stability and maturity, learning to respond rather than react, and cultivating genuine compassion for others.

**Stage Three: Mental Clarity** 🧠  
Gaining control over thought patterns, learning to create positive outcomes through focused intention, and understanding the laws of manifestation.

**Stage Four: Spiritual Integration** ⭐  
Making significant sacrifices for the greater good, releasing attachment to external validation, and connecting with higher purpose.

**Stage Five: Unified Consciousness** 🌟  
Achieving harmony between all aspects of being and contributing wisdom to guide others along their development path.

As people progress through these stages, they gain access to advanced knowledge and abilities that allow them to serve humanity more effectively.

## 🌈 Life in the New Reality

### Daily Experience Transformed

Imagine your typical day in one of these evolved communities:

**Morning** 🌅  
You wake naturally as your body's rhythms align with optimal health patterns. Your dwelling adjusts automatically to provide perfect comfort while using no external energy sources.

**Nourishment** 🍎  
Pure, vitality-rich foods grown in harmony with natural cycles provide all the nutrition your transformed biology requires. No artificial additives, no genetic manipulation, no chemicals that interfere with your body's perfect functioning.

**Purpose** 🎯  
Your ""work"" involves expressing your natural talents in service to the community. Whether through art, healing, education, food production, or innovation, your contribution flows from joy rather than obligation.

**Learning** 📖  
Continuous growth and discovery keep life interesting as you explore new abilities, deepen relationships, and expand your understanding of existence.

**Connection** 🤗  
Direct heart-to-heart communication creates deeper relationships than ever before possible. Privacy is respected while loneliness becomes impossible.

**Movement** 🚀  
Getting anywhere happens effortlessly through clean, silent transportation or advanced personal mobility techniques that work with natural forces.

**Recreation** 🎪  
Free time opens up for pure enjoyment, creative expression, and relaxing activities that restore your energy rather than depleting it.

**Health** 🌺  
Perfect vitality becomes normal as your enhanced biology maintains itself automatically. Age-related decline disappears as your cellular structure operates on improved principles.

## 🌍 A World Without Violence

### Beyond Competition and Conflict

These future communities operate on principles that make violence impossible. When everyone's needs are met and each person can express their unique gifts, the roots of conflict disappear.

No weapons exist because there's nothing to fight over. No wars occur because cooperation produces better results than competition. No crime happens because everyone has abundant access to everything they need.

The old paradigm of scarcity and competition gives way to abundance and collaboration. People naturally treat each other with respect because they understand their fundamental interconnection.

## ⚡ Clean Energy for Everything

### Freedom from Pollution

All energy comes from sources that work in harmony with natural forces. No fossil fuels, no nuclear waste, no environmental destruction. Clean, abundant power flows freely to meet all community needs.

Transportation glides silently without emissions. Buildings maintain perfect climate without depleting resources. Manufacturing creates useful goods without toxic byproducts.

This isn't just better technology – it's technology aligned with universal principles that support life rather than destroying it.

## 🥗 Nourishment That Heals

### Food as Medicine

The future diet consists entirely of pure, organic plant foods that enhance rather than burden your biology. No genetic modification, no chemical additives, no processing that strips away vital nutrients.

These foods provide not just calories but life force energy that maintains perfect health. Eating becomes a joyful, sacred act that connects you to the natural world rather than disconnecting you from it.

## 🏥 Healing Centers Instead of Hospitals

### Wellness as the Standard

Since disease becomes rare in these enhanced communities, healing centers focus on optimization and rejuvenation rather than crisis intervention.

These beautiful spaces use light, sound, color, and energy to maintain perfect health and reverse any imbalances before they become problems. Visiting a healing center feels more like going to a spa than a medical facility.

## 👥 Work That Fulfills Your Soul

### From Jobs to Purpose

The concept of ""employment"" transforms completely. Instead of trading time for money to buy necessities, people contribute their natural talents to community well-being while their needs are automatically met.

Artists create beauty that uplifts everyone. Healers maintain community health. Teachers share wisdom. Innovators solve problems. Farmers provide nourishment. Everyone does what they love while serving the whole.

## 🎨 Creativity Unleashed

### Art and Music Flourish

When survival concerns disappear, human creativity explodes into unprecedented beauty and innovation. Art, music, dance, and storytelling reach levels of excellence impossible under current conditions.

These creative expressions aren't just entertainment – they carry healing frequencies and uplifting energies that enhance everyone's well-being.

## 🚀 Preparing for Galactic Citizenship

### Beyond Earth's Boundaries

As humanity develops these advanced communities, we prepare for participation in broader galactic civilization. Learning to live harmoniously on Earth qualifies us for peaceful interaction with other worlds.

The same principles that create paradise on Earth – cooperation, respect for life, sustainable abundance, and spiritual development – will guide our relationships with cosmic neighbors.

## 🌟 Your Role in This Transformation

## 🔮 The Timeline of Transformation

### Changes Already Underway

Many elements of this future are already emerging around the world. Communities experimenting with alternative currencies, sustainable living, natural healing, and cooperative governance are testing the principles that will guide larger transformations.

As more people recognize the limitations of current systems and embrace life-supporting alternatives, the transition accelerates. What seems impossible today becomes inevitable tomorrow when enough people align with these principles.

The key is maintaining focus on positive possibilities rather than getting trapped in current problems. Energy flows where attention goes, so consistently visualizing and working toward the world you want to live in helps bring it into reality.

## 🌺 A Healing Vision for All

### Beyond Religious Divisions

This vision doesn't require any particular spiritual or religious beliefs. It's based on practical principles that work for everyone regardless of their worldview: treating others well, living sustainably, developing human potential, and creating abundance through cooperation.

Atheists and believers alike can appreciate communities organized around human flourishing rather than profit extraction. The benefits of clean energy, natural healing, meaningful work, and peaceful relationships appeal to anyone who values quality of life.

## 🎯 Making It Real

### The Power of Collective Vision

Individual actions matter, but collective vision creates transformation. As more people hold clear images of positive possibilities and work together to implement them, these future communities manifest more quickly.

Share these ideas with others who might be interested. Start small projects that demonstrate these principles. Connect with existing communities exploring alternative ways of living. Support innovations that align with these values.

Most importantly, embody these principles in your own life as much as possible within current circumstances. Become the change you want to see, and you'll attract opportunities to participate in larger transformations.

## 🌈 The Choice is Ours

### Creating Tomorrow Today

The future described here isn't guaranteed – it's one possibility among many. Whether humanity moves in this direction depends on the choices we make individually and collectively right now.

Every day, we vote with our attention, energy, and resources for the kind of world we want to live in. Choose wisely, act with courage, and trust that your contribution matters more than you might imagine.

The communities of light and love aren't waiting to be built – they're emerging wherever people commit to living these principles today. Your participation is needed and welcome.

The transformation has already begun. The only question is how quickly you want to join it.

---

*This vision represents humanity's potential when we align our communities with principles of cooperation, sustainability, and human development. While the timeline remains uncertain, the direction is clear for those ready to build a world that works for everyone.*

Unfortunately, I will not be returning this fall and am looking for someone to take over my lease at The Standard Eugene. It is $1080 a month and the apartment is a four bedroom unit with the Drummond floor plan, and the available space is Bedroom A. Two of the other rooms, Bedrooms C and D, are already occupied by wonderful roommates.

The Standard is one of Eugene’s newest luxury apartment communities and offers an incredible variety of amenities. Residents have access to a rooftop pool and jacuzzi with a large jumbotron overlooking the city, a fully equipped fitness center, sauna, and indoor rock climbing wall. There is also a golf simulator, dedicated study lounges, and beautifully designed resident common spaces. The building is secure, modern, and designed for student living.

The location is also highly convenient, it’s a short walk, drive or bike ride to campus, with close access to restaurants, coffee shops, and shopping. When I first signed my lease, this unit was one of the last of its kind available, as the Drummond floor plan is particularly popular. I had been very excited to live here, and while I am disappointed not to be returning, I would love to pass the opportunity on to someone who will enjoy it.

If you or your student are interested in taking over the lease, please feel free to reach out to me for further details.",0,1756438347.0,UofO,0,0.33,False

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message!

	•	Option 2: White sofa with a single bench cushion (one long seat cushion) and two back cushions — looks cleaner and more minimal, with a modern structured feel.

Thing is, by this point, Ayanaokoji STILL seems like just an ordinary student with some weird cryptic stuff going on, so the humor sometimes falls flat. I think that's the main problem with this whole franchise. It's like when I, an autistic person, shares my sense of humor with a group of neurotypical people. Lots of things that make others laugh leave me confused and vice versa, because most of the things that make me laugh, others think I'm being serious because that's how I usually am when they're laughing. Still, Ayanaokoji is funny.

Chapter 6.1- Hyori is not the Smartest Character for analyzing coffee cups. I liked that Ayanokoji said Ryueen would knock Kouenji off his suspect list if he knew what a naturally born weirdo he was. Sigh. I wish I had the confidence to just be like Kouenji.

Chapter 6.2- Ayanokoji says he remembers previous 3rd Year Class D Students not being happy to see him, but... Wasn't there only 1 Class D Student left? Gasp! Maybe they were originally Class A and got knocked down by an Ayanokoji-esque Person! I think it would be interesting if graduation from Class A didn't actually matter. Isn't there a 100% employment rate for this School anyway? And why would anyone decide to go to a University if they can just get any job they want, even if that's a Baseball Player?

Chapter 6.4- I have no sympathy for Ayanokoji if he can just be so casual that a whole friend group gets named after him. Also, I feel for Yukimura and his Past... I'm glad Hasabe backed off.

Chapter 6.5- I could not give less of a crap over this Ayanaokoji, Satou, Sakura love triangle. Satou only likes Ayanaokoji because he can run fast, and Sakura is literally an online super model celebrity, but she's mad that her crush doesn't like her back. Oh, boo hoo, First World Problems.

Chapter 6.6- Soudou is still only at Elementary School level? And what was with Karuizawa dumping grape juice on Kushida? If her dark side activated right there, would she have tackled her? Also, why is it taking SO LONG for Kushida to do anything? I know I complain about this all the time, but High School Syndrome can't even be bothered to release its Second Volume, and it's already done Way more than Classroom of the Elite has if you ignore the Special Exams.

Chapter 6.7- I'd take a dozen Volumes of whatever's going on in Class A between Sakayanagi and Katsuragi, along with whatever's happening between the calm and friendly Ichinose and then arrogant and rude Ryueen, over this stupid Ayanaokoji Group bunch!

I am a 21-year-old female in an engineering undergraduate program at a university that might be considered prestigious. I've been raised in a very academically focused setting, attending a high school intended to prepare students for rigorous programs and successful careers. 

As a result, since high school, I have been staying up late, doing homework. In grade 11, I began falling asleep in every class. I thought this could be chalked up to 5-7 hours of sleep a night. I did my best to take notes and stay focused - definitely had the pressure to perform well, too. But in every class, I'd realize my pen slipped and I had scribbled incoherent phrases from my dreaming/drowsy state. This occurred even in courses I enjoyed and when sitting in the front.

In university, my workload increased, and I was consistently sleeping under 5 hours. Here, I also fell asleep in every class I attended, despite my best efforts. I tried chewing gum, eating, drinking coffee/cold water, and listening to music, but nothing worked.  I noticed that this would happen whenever I was unengaged in my classes and usually occurred because the class was boring, uninteractive, or the professor and course concepts were too difficult for me to grasp. 

During my internships, I had a lot more free time and consistently achieved 7-8+ hours of sleep. However, I often had nothing to do but mundane and very unstimulating tasks (i.e. data entry). I would even get incredibly sleepy during meetings. In fact, I've had issues staying awake when talking to tutors that I was paying for at uni. 

The sleep itself feels like my whole face and head are shutting off and drifting into a stupor. I get a sort of fog-like feeling and tunnel-vision. I'll end up nodding off over and over, trying to keep myself awake. Then instantly, if someone starts to talk to me or something interesting happens, all the blood rushes to my head, and everything physically feels instantly switched on. Even on my most sleepless days, the moment I leave class or am with friends, or get a text on my phone, I am immediately engaged. The problem is that in my day-to-day life, it's pretty difficult to keep a job or have network with professors if I am constantly falling asleep. I've ended up skipping most of my classes, as I was simply wasting time. I feel incredibly embarrassed and ashamed afterwards, and this anxiety probably helps me stay awake afterwards. It's more noticeable now, in my smaller classes (under 30 students) and at work (I want a return offer).

In January, I began taking caffeine pills. The pills do not always work, unless I take around 2-3 before each meeting, which means I'm clocking over 600mg a day. When I take these, I can't tell when I am awake and when I'm asleep. I also feel my heart rate elevate like crazy, and I have to fight myself to not take a sh\*t every few minutes. Work has been a nightmare like this, I have been digging my nails into my skin and drinking so much water trying to fight sleep with pain and discomfort, and my success has only been moderate.  

My googling has always led to some sort of attention disorder and ""intrusive sleep"". While I think this term best describes it, I know self-diagnosis is irresponsible and unreliable. So, my ask is basically if anyone has had similar experiences to me and what they've done to overcome this? Is this a sign of a disorder to be looked into?

We’ve decided on a SE Asian menu, but there are so many choices out there (including, of course, Western-style food), that I wanted to get thoughts on how others built the menu for their reception.

That is, how do you decide on what cuisine to cater, let alone narrow down the dishes?

For us, no beef or pork is a no-brainer, to respect some guests’ religious restrictions; instead, we will have chicken, fish, and shrimp, as well as fried appetisers, rice, and noodles. There should also be a mix of spicy and non-spicy carbs and proteins, and separate veg/gluten-free plated meals.

The catering is a buffet and includes iced punch, but we’ll be topping up for hot coffee/tea, because many older folks won’t drink cold beverages. For dessert, [tong sui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tong_sui) and sweet [rice pastries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_cake). No cake.

When planning your menu, what considerations did you take into account? Any advice you’d give?

The other wedding subs often have comments about “bad” or “inedible” wedding food, which is tragic and unthinkable to me as a guest and host, but I’m also wondering what US wedding attendees’ expectations are.

*Understanding the magnetic pull of intense relationships and their lasting impact on our lives*

## The Allure of Intensity 🌪️

Have you ever met someone who seemed to carry lightning in their fingertips? Someone whose presence transformed ordinary moments into extraordinary memories? These individuals possess a rare magnetism that draws us in like moths to flame, leaving us both enchanted and vulnerable.

We encounter them in coffee shops, at work events, through mutual friends, or in the most unexpected places. They're the ones who notice details others miss, who see art in everyday moments, who make you feel like you're the only person in a crowded room. Their energy is intoxicating, their perspective refreshing, and their company addictive.

## The Memory Maker Phenomenon 🎨

These captivating individuals have a unique gift: they transform simple locations into sacred spaces in our minds. A walk through the local park becomes an adventure. That corner bookstore turns into a treasure trove of shared discoveries. Even mundane spots like the grocery store or a bus stop become infused with meaning when experienced through their eyes.

They introduce us to new music that becomes the soundtrack to our emotions. They recommend books that change our perspective. They suggest restaurants that become ""our places."" Every shared experience becomes a thread in the tapestry of connection they weave around us.

**The Psychology Behind This:**
- Our brains create stronger memories when emotions are heightened
- Shared novel experiences bond people more deeply than routine interactions
- When someone shows us new ways of seeing familiar things, we associate those fresh perspectives with them

## The Beautiful Chaos They Bring ✨

These individuals often live life with an intensity that both thrills and exhausts. They feel everything deeply, love passionately, and approach life with an ""all or nothing"" mentality. They're the friends who suggest spontaneous road trips at midnight, who cry during movies, who get excited about cloud formations or the way light hits a building.

Their emotional depth can be overwhelming. They might spend hours discussing the meaning of a song lyric or become completely absorbed in a piece of street art. They see beauty and significance in things others might overlook, and they want to share these discoveries with you.

**Common traits of these magnetic personalities:**
- Highly empathetic and emotionally expressive
- Creative or artistic tendencies
- Tendency toward deep, philosophical conversations
- Spontaneous and adventurous spirit
- Intense focus when something captures their interest

## The Inevitable Transformation 🦋

Spending time with such people changes us, often permanently. They expand our comfort zones, challenge our assumptions, and introduce us to parts of ourselves we didn't know existed. We might discover hidden interests, develop new hobbies, or find ourselves more willing to take risks.

They teach us to notice details: the way morning light filters through leaves, the sound of rain on different surfaces, the taste of a perfectly ripe strawberry. Through their eyes, we learn to appreciate subtleties we previously ignored.

However, this transformation comes with a price. We become accustomed to their level of intensity and passion. Regular interactions with others might start feeling flat in comparison. We find ourselves craving the emotional highs they provided.

## When the Season Ends 🍂

Not all intense connections are meant to last forever. Sometimes these magnetic individuals are in our lives for a specific period, serving as catalysts for growth before moving on to impact others. Their departure often feels sudden and devastating, even when we logically understand the reasons.

The aftermath can feel like emotional whiplash. Places you once loved together now carry bittersweet memories. Songs trigger unexpected waves of nostalgia. Even positive memories can sting because they remind you of what you no longer have.

**Healthy ways to process this transition:**
- Acknowledge that grief over lost connections is normal and valid
- Focus on the growth and positive changes they brought to your life
- Create new positive associations with shared spaces gradually
- Practice gratitude for the experience rather than dwelling on the loss

## The Lessons They Leave Behind 📚

While the immediate aftermath of their departure might feel destructive, these intense connections often leave valuable gifts:

**Enhanced Appreciation:** They taught you to notice beauty in everyday moments. This skill remains with you long after they're gone, enriching your daily experiences.

**Emotional Courage:** They modeled vulnerability and emotional authenticity, potentially inspiring you to be more open in future relationships.

**Expanded Horizons:** The new interests, perspectives, and experiences they introduced become permanent additions to your personal repertoire.

**Self-Discovery:** Their intense focus on you might have revealed strengths, interests, or capabilities you didn't know you possessed.

## Understanding the Storm Metaphor 🌩️

Natural disasters are named after people because they share certain characteristics with these intense personalities: they're powerful, transformative, memorable, and leave lasting impacts on the landscape they touch. Just as communities rebuild stronger after weathering storms, we often emerge more resilient and self-aware after navigating intense relationships.

The comparison isn't meant to suggest these people are destructive by nature. Rather, their intensity can be overwhelming for those unprepared for such emotional weather. The key is learning to appreciate the experience without losing yourself in it.

## Building Emotional Resilience 💪

Recognizing these patterns can help you approach future intense connections more mindfully:

**Maintain Your Identity:** Enjoy shared experiences without completely abandoning your own interests and friendships.

**Practice Emotional Balance:** Appreciate intensity while also cultivating contentment in quieter moments.

**Set Realistic Expectations:** Understand that not every connection, however meaningful, is meant to be permanent.

**Learn to Create Your Own Magic:** Develop the ability to find beauty and meaning in experiences independently.

## The Ripple Effect 🌊

One of the most beautiful aspects of these encounters is how they change our approach to future relationships. We learn to value depth over surface-level interactions. We become more selective about who we invest our time and energy in. We develop a greater appreciation for authenticity and emotional courage.

We might also find ourselves becoming the catalyst for others' growth, sharing the lessons we learned and the perspectives we gained. In this way, the positive impact of these intense connections extends far beyond our own lives.

## Creating Lasting Meaning 🌱

Instead of viewing these experiences solely through the lens of loss, consider them investments in your personal growth. Every meaningful connection, regardless of its duration, contributes to who you become. The art appreciation, emotional vocabulary, adventurous spirit, or creative interests they sparked in you become permanent parts of your identity.

These relationships teach us that love and connection come in many forms. Not every meaningful relationship needs to last forever to be valuable. Sometimes the most transformative connections are brief but intense, like shooting stars that illuminate the sky for just a moment but leave us forever changed.

## Moving Forward With Gratitude 🙏

The healthiest way to honor these experiences is through gratitude rather than regret. Thank them mentally for the growth they inspired, the beauty they helped you see, and the parts of yourself they helped you discover. This gratitude doesn't require contact or closure; it's a gift you give yourself.

As you create new memories in those ""sacred spaces"" they once shared with you, you're not erasing their impact but building upon it. Each new positive experience in those locations adds another layer to their significance, gradually transforming them from monuments to the past into foundations for the future.

Remember: you were whole before you met them, and you remain whole after they've gone. They didn't complete you; they revealed parts of you that were always there, waiting to be discovered. That revelation is a gift that belongs to you forever, regardless of their presence in your life.

The most beautiful relationships, even those that end, leave us more capable of love, more aware of beauty, and more authentically ourselves. In that way, even the storms that bear their names ultimately bring renewal and growth.

I’m looking for any of the **Riding Shotgun rewards**. *Mainly the outfit*, but I’m also interested in the plans! I’m not sure what they’re worth but I know the rewards are a little hard to get, so I’m gonna put what I have a decent amount of/think might be worthwhile, lol. I have enough plans that I took screenshots and slapped them all on one photo, I’ll list a few that I think might be the best ones on the list itself. 

I’m okay to do and/or with whatever I list, as in you can ask for a mix of caps+ammo or like, caps + some plans. If that’s allowed! 

Here’s the list of what I have to trade: 

**Caps**: 30k

**Ammo**:
• 43 Fusion cores (full, lol)
• 70 ultracite plasma cores (also full obviously)
• 25,000 fuel
• weaponized nuka ammo, 274 nuka cola, 73 nuka cherry, 57 nuka quantum

**Glowing masks**:
• Glowing Minotaur
• Glowing Skull
•*(I also have a buffoon and winter man mask, not glowing, but I’m not sure if those are sought after anymore?)*

**Plans**: *(I have a lot, so you can pick a handful if you want. I know some of these are probably common drops or something, but I’m just throwin’ it out there!)*

Amen."" - Matthew 6:13  
  
PONDER THIS  
  
What is wrong with so many of us is that we wake up in the morning and everything’s going fine. We jump out of bed, we get dressed, and have our breakfast. We gulp down some hot coffee. We get in the car and go to work. Everything is just fine. We think we’ve got it made, and then here comes the enemy—and we fail.  
  
We fall and we come to the end of the day and we pray, “God forgive me.” And we should! Every time you pray that in sincerity and in truth, God does forgive you. But why do we keep on asking Him to forgive us for the same thing? You ask God to forgive you, and He does. Then you fall again and say, “God forgive me,” and He does.  
  
The reason we keep asking God to forgive us for the same thing is that we’ve only learned part of this prayer in Matthew 6. We’ve learned to pray, “God forgive us,” but we’ve not learned to pray, “lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil:”  
  
The best way to deal with your sin is not to try to clean it up at the end of the day, but to prevent it from coming at the beginning of the day. This prayer is not the lock that closes the night; it is the key that opens the morning. Pray in the morning for daily deliverance.  
  
What are some of the ways you get ready spiritually each day? How do those things prepare you for the spiritual battles ahead?  
  
What are some reasons you don’t prioritize getting ready spiritually each day?  
  
PRACTICE THIS  
  
Make a reminder for yourself to get spiritually ready each day. Make this preparation a habit.

It was great to have the actual roaster present for advice on recipes and to participate meaningfully. Second, the coffees themselves were excellent. The notes on the brews are at:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeerotation/comments/1mzoxfk/inugami\_reviewsrecipes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeerotation/comments/1mzoxfk/inugami_reviewsrecipes/)

The bean selection was good; the beans were high-quality and well-roasted. I hope that Inugami Coffee gets put in Rotation. u/Lost_Anything_5596/ did a better job than I did of formatting his reviews. More than the beans themselves, though, I hope this becomes an integral part of Rotation - testing and promoting roasters we would likely never hear of if not for our participation in Rotation.  

I first got into Rotation because it offered access to top, well-known, roasters from around the World - like Glitch, A.M.O.C., Manhattan, et al. in a way that worked for an individual and in quantities that allowed me to sample a large number of coffees fresh every month without too many of any one bean. Although this is still a huge perk, the fact is that you hear about these coffees everywhere. Finding gems like Inugami Coffee, which I would likely never stumble across (until they became huge, of course), who is not getting astroturfed on other subs, and who is present and available to discuss his work, well, that is even more amazing than the original premise.

32F, 5ft 7in, purpose for doing carnivore is hormonal health. 

I have lost 18lbs in nearly 8 weeks, and the last few weeks of that I have plateaued. Start weight 212, now 194lbs. 

So much inflammation before!!! You can see my cortisol belly before. I had a histamine intolerance and a very real sensitivity to stress. I feel massive improvements. 

In these 8 weeks, i had a long keto flu/adaptation phase where I was zonked of energy, which has returned thankfully. Weeks 1&2 I felt fine, weeks 3,4,5 I felt rough and had to trust the process! Weeks 6&7 back to normal. 

All throughout this time my mental health has seen the biggest improvement. I felt depressed and anxious before carnivore, now I feel consistently calm, which is enough to make me dedicated to this woe. 

I eat 2mad - bacon and 3 eggs cooked in butter around lunchtime (rarely need breakfast) and a different meat for dinner, mostly steak and eggs but to have variety I would eat lamb, pork belly, duck breast, steak burgers, etc etc. I would snack on cheese. I stopped eating cheese for a while but I missed it, probably why I have plateaued. I snack on peperami sticks if I’m out on the road at work and feel peckish (I drive a lot in work). I drink coffee with a dash of whole milk. My macros are between 70/30 and 80/20 every day, very very low carb (the milk) 

My only concern is my menstrual cycle. My last few cycles before this woe were becoming less regular and it was freaking me out. 
I found Dr Kiltz and thought carnivore was an answer to my prayers - but nearly 8 weeks in and no improvement in that department yet. 

Can someone reassure me please 🙏 ? ",13,1756437733.0,carnivorediet,10,0.93,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **""Doosan Bears vs. Lotte Giants: A KBO Thriller Where the Bears Roar and the Giants Stumble (Probably)""**

The KBO’s Doosan Bears (1.74 implied probability to win) and Lotte Giants (2.05 implied probability) clash on August 29 in a game that’s as predictable as a spreadsheet—*if spreadsheets had 9.5-run totals and a 1.5-run spread*. Let’s break it down with the precision of a relief pitcher timing his warm-up.

### Key Stats & Odds

* **Moneyline**: Doosan Bears (-150 implied probability) are the clear favorites, while Lotte Giants (+206) offer a tempting long shot for those who enjoy “betting on a coffee break to win the World Series.”
* **Spread**: Doosan -1.5 (-220) vs. Lotte +1.5 (+180). If you’re feeling spicy, back the Bears to cover, but don’t be surprised if Lotte’s “+1.5” ends up being more of a “+1.49” heart-stopper.
* **Totals**: Over/Under 9.5 runs. The Over (even money at some books) is for the optimists; the Under is for the realists who’ve seen too many rain delays.

### Why Doosan Will Win (Probably)

Doosan’s -150 line implies they’re the KBO’s version of a guaranteed Netflix series finale—\*you know it’

I'm F18, born in AZ raised in KY. My dad is white and my mom is mostly native. I've been told I look mixed and told I'm faking my ethnicity. I have a stereotypical southern accent. I've identified as white because it's exhausting fighting people over my ancestry. I've only met one other native in my life and we were friends until I had to drop out of school.

I'm so tired of the racism I face for my Hispanic and indigenous roots. And no it isn't only online. My dad's side of the family won't talk to me because they believe mixed race children (esp brown ones) are the ""seed of satan"". No fucking joke. I don't have any family that fw me. I want to bang my head on a wall and cry. 

About a month ago i posted my dna results on the 23&me sub and holy shit were people so weird and xenaphobic. I got told I was a pathetic Mexican trying to be white. Told I was self-hating and obviously brown. A disgrace to my ancestors, etc. I'm just so fucking tired. I don't even know what tribe I am from because my moms side of the family is so embarrassed about being native. My dad used to yell at me for saying my mom was brown meanwhile her skin is as dark of fucking coffee.

I wish I felt complete. I wish I had a community and could fit it. White folks, not even from my own family consider me other. Most natives consider me other (can't really blame them since I know nothing about the culture).

I just wanted to make this post because I feel really alone and frustrated. I want to be normal and fit in. I want to learn more about my native side but have no way to start. ",2,1756437661.0,mixedrace,0,0.75,False

Ah, Major League Soccer—where soccer meets “meh” in a sweaty, overpriced stadium. Let’s dive into the chaos:  

1. **Inter Miami’s Messi & Co.**: Lionel Messi, the man who’s basically a deity in MLS, is *still* scoring goals like it’s his job (spoiler: it is). Meanwhile, Jordi Alba is probably sipping tea and whispering, “I’m not injured, I’m *strategizing*.” The Leagues Cup semifinal against Orlando City? A mere formality for Messi, who’s on a quest to make “multi-goal games” feel as normal as your neighbor’s morning coffee routine.  

2. **Charlotte FC’s “Fine Form”**: Charlotte FC, led by Dean Smith, is “continuing their fine form” in MLS. Translating from Coach Speak: they haven’t collapsed yet. With the transfer window closing soon, Minnesota United is frantically trying to sign Relebohile Mofokeng from Orlando Pirates. If they fail, they’ll probably just buy a bunch of highlight-reel skills from YouTube.  

3. **Goalkeeper Drama**: Drake Callender, Inter Miami’s goalkeeper, has officially joined Charlotte FC. Because nothing says “stability” like swapping one goalkeeper for another who might or might not remember how to dive.  

4. **Apple TV’s MLS Season Pass**: The MLS website is just a never-ending loop of “Apple TV - MLS Season Pass.” It’s less a sports league and more a corporate-sponsored screensaver. Bonus points if you can watch a full match without the app crashing.  

5. **Messi’s Magical Midfield Shenanigans**: Messi scored a “magical goal” against Montreal, which is just a fancy way of saying he dribbled past three players and then *tossed* the ball into the net like it owed him money. Meanwhile, Yahoo Sports is hyping up the 2025 MLS All-Star jersey reveal. Because nothing says “star power” like a $200 jersey that you’ll wear to a BBQ and immediately spill BBQ sauce on.  

6. **Son Heung-Min’s Debut**: Son Heung-Min’s MLS debut? Historic. Austin FC’s “next step”? Probably figuring out how to not look like they’re playing soccer in a video game on hard mode.  

In conclusion, MLS is a delightful mix of soccer, corporate branding, and transfer window panic. If you ignore the fact that half the players are here for the lifestyle (read: Instagram clout), it’s a decent show. Just don’t ask us why Drake Callender’s career feels like a Choose Your Own Adventure book. 🏆✨",1,1756437615.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

On the other side, Diamondbacks starter Zac Gallen (5.13 ERA) is just 1-5 against the Dodgers over the course of his career, and his last 2 outings resulted in a loss for Arizona (both opponents covered the RL). With Snell being a perfect 3-0 at home and having allowed a mere 2 runs over his last 3 outings, I’ve gotta take the Dodgers to cover here for plus money.

Honestly, I was a little skeptical about all ""shade resistant"" talk, but after using them for a while I've got to say, it's been totally worth it.

On clear days, I usually see around 330-370W combined, which is super solid for two 200W panels, and sometimes I even catch short peaks going a little over 400W. Even when part of the panel is shaded. Another thing I've got to mention is their customer service, any questions I had during setup or use, they answered super patiently. Now with the panels feeding into my portable power station, I can run my fridge, lights, laptop and even use a little cooker or coffee maker now and then without stressing.

1n2wh6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/SugarDiet/comments/1n2wh6a/the_sugar_bulk_thread/,The Sugar Bulk thread,"Sugar Diet is for spring and summer (March 1 - Labor Day).

Sugar Bulk is the other half of the year.

Simple platform designed for maximum lean gains. 

Ideology: Maximum clean, whole foods carb intake, moderate lean protein, lowest possible fat. Eat as much as you can, don't count calories. You can and should use the scale--but do NOT be discouraged if the scale seems slow to go UP.

Each numbered point is a ""calorie consumption interval"". One day example:

1) Organic coffee 1-4 cups with two rounded desert spoons of table sugar, honey, molasses or syrup. Include 15 grams of grass fed organic bovine collagen.

2) Pineapple and mango (frozen) based fruit smoothie with added scoop of organic sprouted hemp protein. Use a sweet store bought green smoothie juice as base. You can use other protein powders but organic sprouted hemp is best.

3) A large bowl or container of whatever raw wet (preferably organic) fruit(s).

4) Cups of cooked rice, oatmeal. You can add a can of tuna and pineapple chunks and juice to the rice, or cover the oatmeal with applesauce and cinnamon. You could also put syrup, jam or honey on the oatmeal.

4) Two chicken breasts, romaine lettuce, a whole pineapple (must be ripe, preferably raw) and a cooked starch which could be any type of peeled  potato. Add a carrot or two. 

5) Special K cereal (or other low fat high quality cereal) with some kind of low fat plant milk or skim milk about 1 hour before bed. You can also eat 1-2 servings of oatmeal and put honey, jam, syrup or sugar in it.

If you wake up to pee at night, have a shot glass of some kind of syrup (preferably organic maple) ready on your counter and slam it down before you go back to sleep. This is especially useful if you experience cortisol-based early awakening or disturbed sleep.

Consume each dose until you are satisfied, reasonably full, and happy. Drink good amounts of water and ginger tea throughout the day.

Train like a madman and make sure you stick to big eating on all recovery days. You will be able to train and gain like a beast. Don't feel bad or lazy if you need multiple consecutive recovery days.

You will be running very hot. If not, smash more carbs. No need to add more protein. This will exceed the the RDA and in fact put most people around the optimal .7 grams per lb required for hypertrophy. 

There are a few other things that could be added. But before creatine or anything else, a quality multivitamin and one good EFA pill can be added with the meat ""dinner"" meal.

This plan can be tailored to individual needs by those with good nutrition and training experience. But it is essentially foolproof as is.

My guess on calories is about 3500-4500 per day for me. But I only make gains and add no fat. You can get a little soft or smooth in some places, but relish this. It's just water storage and glycogen looking for a home.

Try it for one month. You have nothing to lose. Downside risk is minimal. The upside? Reaching your natural genetic potential. 

This will work in the precise way I describe. I stake my reputation on it.",0,1756437135.0,SugarDiet,0,0.33,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Hanwha Eagles vs. Samsung Lions: A Parlor of Perfection and Puns**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a KBO clash that’s equal parts pitching masterclass and slapstick comedy. Hanwha’s rookie phenom Jeong Woo-ju has single-handedly turned baseball into a *Jeong*\-show, while Samsung hopes to avoid becoming the latest victims in Hanwha’s 16-game winning streak (a streak so long, it’s practically a permanent fixture on the team’s Instagram Stories). Let’s break this down with the precision of a radar gun and the humor of a dugout full of stand-up comedians.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

The odds tell a tale of two teams: **Samsung Lions** (-1.5, implied probability \~61.7%) are the favorites, while **Hanwha Eagles** (+1.5, \~44.4%) are the underdogs. The total runs line sits at **9.5**, with Over and Under odds hovering around 52-55% implied probability. But here’s the kicker: Hanwha’s pitching staff is a statistical anomaly.

* **Hanwha’s Pitching**: They’ve got three 10-win starters (Koo Dong-ju, Ryan White, Moon Dong-ju), a trio so dominant they’ve made the rest of the KBO look like they’re playing with training wheels. Their collective ERA? Low enough to make a lifeguard jealous.
* **Samsung’s Burden**: The Lions haven’t been highlighted for their pitching or hitting in recent news. Without standout stats to counter Hanwha’s armada, they’re essentially bringing a spoon to a gunfight.

### Digesting the News: Jeong’s Historic Inning and Samsung’s Silent Struggles

Hanwha’s Jeong Woo-ju isn’t just a rookie; he’s a one-man meteorological event. On August 28, he struck out **nine batters in a single inning** with fastballs clocked between 151-153 km/h—so fast, the batter’s coffee went cold mid-swing. This makes him the 11th KBO pitcher to achieve a *무결점 이닝* (perfect inning), but the first rookie since 2024. Scouts from **11 MLB clubs** were in attendance, which is about as subtle as a text message saying, “Hey, we’re here, but also not here.”

Samsung, mean

1n2wgdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1n2wgdn/mf_blame_it_on_the_rain/,[MF] Blame It On The Rain,"We are intrigued by the weather. Something in our human DNA requires us to have at least two weather apps on our phones at all times to have immediate access to all the local and national forecasts by the minute if necessary. And it’s absolutely wild how anxious we get when those app reports contradict each other? I have four apps myself: the app that came preinstalled on my smartphone, the Weather TV app, the Storm Tracker app, and the NOAA Weather Radar app.

After hearing that, you probably believe I have an unhealthy obsession with weather. Well, it’s not that or a sanity thing either. I assure you I’m in complete control of all my faculties.

I check all these apps around the clock because when it rains, two things happen. My powers work. Then they show up with that ghastly tapping on the circular window in my attic.   

“Damn!” I see on my weather apps that there’s a hundred percent chance of thunderstorms, which means rain all night. That means I’m working tonight. 

They’re coming because of my abilities. You see, I’m a psychic, but with limitations. My telepathic powers switch on only when it rains outside. On rainy nights, I work for a broker who facilitates what I can do for our customers in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.

 The storm started a few hours after nightfall. When that happens, I’m expected to be waiting in the attic for them to arrive to give me my work assignment. 

My attic is quite bare because it’s partially finished. I set up a television area with an 18-inch TV set that requires an antenna and a camping hammock in the corner. Since the antenna picks up only two channels, my viewing options are Little House on the Prairie reruns or old Hanna-Barbera cartoons. I enjoy Thundarr the Barbarian, so I’m picking the cartoons.

I’m lying in the hammock, facing the TV, with my back to the attic window. I’m hyper-focused on the cartoon when the noise of glass pecking drowns out whatever Thundarr is saying. “They’re here.” About time! I’ve been waiting a while now—a long enough period to have watched five Thundarr episodes. I’ve become antsy.

There’s more pecking on the window. I turn my head toward the window and see them. A large, red-eyed blackbird is on the other side of the glass. My employer’s magical messenger raven has a tiny scroll (my work assignment) in its beak and is feverishly tapping on the glass to come inside to deliver it. 

They see me almost flip the hammock over and spill onto the floor while getting out of it, but luckily, I catch myself.  

The raven suddenly becomes restless. They tap away on the wet window and start to make deafening bird noises. That with the sound of the rain and thunder is overwhelming. It seems my almost-fall transferred my anxiety to them and amplified it.

“Calm down, I’m coming.” 

I press the circular window to open it. The entire glass pane swings out, and the raven swoops in, lands on the top of my TV set, and shakes the rain off their feathers. 

“Come on, show some respect! You’re getting everything wet,” I said, irate. 

After giving my attic a bath, they drop the tiny scroll from their beak onto the table on which the TV set rests. “Someone’s mind needs attention,” they caw. Oh yeah, they can talk.

I look at the scroll and wonder what task they gave me. Our clients usually want their minds wiped or want me to read someone’s thoughts, which I admit is intrusive and deviant. But hey, my moral compass doesn’t rotate when the minds I’m intruding on belong to a cheating husband who’s been lying to their wife and family about late meetings with coworkers, who’s their mistress. “Screw that guy!”

“Someone’s mind needs attention,” they caw again.

 I grab the scroll from the table, remove the tie, and unroll the paper. My assignment tonight is to wipe the mind of someone named Bailey. 

“Bailey, why is that name familiar?”

The raven flaps their wings and flies out of the attic, back through the window, and into the storm.  I’d better be going myself.

———————

The thunderstorm was tremendous. The thirty-minute drive to Bailey’s house was perilous, to say the least. I drove by one wreck, hydroplaned once, and almost got hit by a cool person driving too fast in this mighty downpour. Halfway to Bailey’s address, I remembered why he was familiar. “Damn.” My attitude suddenly turned to a dread of our momentary interaction.

I first discovered my powers as a kid. My cousin and I were waiting for his parents to pick us up at the movies. We just watched the second Mighty Ducks. We were under some shelter because the rain was coming down hard. My aunt and uncle pulled up, and we darted to their car. You could tell that they had been fighting. The tension was coming off them like steam. 

We were at a stoplight. The wiper blades were going a mile a minute. My cousin said he wanted Taco Bell for dinner. My aunt told him that they were eating leftovers. Then I heard my uncle say something. “She can’t know about Denise and me. We’ve been so careful.” But no one responded. He didn’t speak. It was all in my mind. It was like I thought it up. I asked my uncle who Denise was. I was curious. I didn’t know that my aunt was suspicious of my uncle cheating on her. That’s what they had been fighting about. 

He, of course, was. My hearing his thoughts proved that. I got dropped off afterward. My uncle ended up with a black eye. My aunt divorced him. Good riddance to that asshole.  I love my aunt. She didn’t deserve that. I’ve hated cheaters ever since.

The area of Charlotte I’m driving through is very affluent. I’ve never actually been in this neighborhood before. Our customers aren’t broke because our services aren’t cheap, but Bailey has to be a millionaire several times over by how much a house here costs. “This is going to be terrible.” 

I believe I’m here, but it’s hard to tell in the raining, so I drove by the house’s mailbox to confirm the house number. Yep. The house number is 1-3-5-2. The instructions said to park behind the Lexus SUV on the road, walk down the driveway, and enter through the gate beside the garage. Bailey will be waiting in the pool house. 

I’m in my nonluxury car assessing the situation. I can wait for a break or dash to the pool house in the rain. There doesn’t seem to be a break soon, so it’s plan B.

 I put on my rain jacket, grabbed my umbrella, opened the door, and got hit with a waterfall before I could even open the umbrella. My first step onto the street from my car is into a pool of rainwater that soaks my running shoes. “Damn, I forgot to change into my rain boots.” 

Next, I’m moving down the driveway. Every one of my running steps splashes water onto me. It doesn’t matter. This storm is the type of severe storm that makes your clothes an oversaturated sponge. Luckily, the gate was easy to open and the path to the pool house was concrete, so I never had to walk through mud or a flooded yard. 

Of course, the pool house is enormous. I’m waiting outside. There’s a blue door between me and something I don’t want to do. Bailey did something terrible. I’m sensing there are two people inside. “The message didn’t say anything about a second person being here.” 

Someone shouts “coming” after knocking on the door. I count to five, and then a white-haired man with a goatee without a mustache opens it. “Come on in,” the man greets me, whom I recognize from the news.

I’m drenched. I walked by the man who stepped away from the doorway to let me in. “So this is Bailey, the girlfriend killer.” He offered me some bourbon and asked me to sit on a tan leather couch where a young man was seated, whom I assumed was the other mind I sensed outside. I declined the liquor.

“Welcome, this is my son Tristen Bailey,” Bailey says. 

“Nice to meet you, Tristen,” I say with a handshake.

Bailey moves to a wooden bar cart in the corner to pour himself a drink, but Tristan could use one. He seems on edge about something. Bailey’s back is to us. I hear two ice cubes hit the bottom of a glass and him pouring liquid into the glass. Then he sits on a similar colored leather chair across Tristan and me, sipping his whisky, and lays it on a glass coffee table. 

“So, I guess you know who I am and why you’re here,” Bailey asks me. “Yes, you do. I know you know who I am by the way you look at me.”

I thought I was doing an excellent job of containing my uneasiness about being in this poolhouse with him. I didn’t realize that my face was so easy to decipher. “Yep, I know who you are. I’m here to erase a memory from your mind.” I answered the monster.

“Well, that’s almost correct. You are here to erase a memory,” Bailey says cryptically.  I look at Tristan. I don’t have to use my powers to know that  he’s dead scared. It’s radiating off him. He hasn’t said a word since I shook his hand. What’s going on? I could quickly find out, but I didn’t think it was right to scan his mind, so I scanned his Dad’s mind instead. “Wow! So that’s why I’m here. Bailey’s mind is a dark place.”

 “Tristan, my baby boy here, saw something he didn’t mean to. I need what he saw to disappear,” explains Bailey.

“Sure! I can manage that,” I tell Bailey. Then, I explain to the father and son how the memory erasing process works: Tristan needs to conjure up the memory, and then I use my abilities to make him forget whatever it is indefinitely.

Tristan permitted me to perform the memory erase. I told him to remain calm and remember what must be wiped out. Then Bailey watched me cover his son’s face with my hand with great attention and curiosity. The technique resembles a Vulcan mind-meld from Star Trek. 

I grunt and shout like I’m in pain, which is purely theatrical. The whole thing is relatively harmless for both of us. I remove my hand from Tristan’s face and recoil on the couch.

“Is it done?” Bailey wonders. I shake my head, yes. He asks Tristan what he was doing the night of March 12th after nine o’clock to be convinced. Bailey’s girlfriend was murdered on that date.

“Dad, I don’t remember. There’s nothing but a black hole,” Tristan says for the first time.

“Impressive. Tristan doesn’t remember,” Bailey said convinced.

I tell Bailey that I need to get going. He thanked me with a devilish smile. “Damn you for making me do that to Tristan.”

The rain is still falling, but not as heavily as before. I dash for my car. 

In my car, I think about Tristan and feel awful for him. His Dad is horrible. When I read 

his mind, I learned two things about his Dad.

The first is that he did kill his girlfriend. 

The second is that Tristan witnessed part of what happened and will testify in his Dad’s trial in two days. That’s the memory that I erased from Tristan’s head. How could Tristan tell the truth while on the stand if he didn’t remember the truth? Bailey needed that fixed.

I feel awful for what I just did to him. Not only did I violate him, but what’s going to happen to him in two days. I  made it so that he’ll remember what he saw on the night of March 12th, right before he testifies. It will gut him and his family—the collateral damage.

“I’m sorry, Tristan. I couldn’t allow your Dad to get away.”

She works in a large company, and a male coworker from another department (38M) has repeatedly asked her out for coffee, beer, and drinks. She's always declined, and all of the times he invited her, she was actually with me — so I know she didn’t go.
Still, I’m bothered by how she handled it. While she technically said no, she wasn’t as firm as I think she should’ve been, and she didn’t report it right away. We talked about boundaries, and she admitted she could’ve done better.
What really made me upset is that she kept screenshots of their chats and shared them with a friend, making fun of him and calling him a weirdo — instead of just dealing with it directly. She told me she kept the messages in case she needed to report him, but when I contacted him myself to tell him to back off, she actually warned him that I was reaching out. She said she felt pity for him.
Eventually, I pushed her to report him to HR, and she did. But now I’m considering telling his wife what’s been going on. I don’t know if he’s done this before, and I feel like she deserves to know. I also don’t want her to find out only after HR contacts him.
should I reach out to his wife before or after he hears from HR? And what’s the best way to do it — text, email, call, or even in person?
Would appreciate any honest advice. This whole thing has really shaken me, and I’m trying to do what’s right here.

The Sixth Tale of Chazz Monet

Blüdhaven—where the harbor mists curl around the kind of secrets that never make tax returns, and every shadow on the street has something to hide. For Agent Chazz Monet, alias Cash Money, the city was both a homecoming and a headache. He’d come here seeking only the mundane pleasures of an ordinary weekend: a good cup of coffee, a quiet walk beneath the neon glow, and perhaps the faint luxury of forgetting, just for a moment, the heavy ledger of his responsibilities.

But Blüdhaven—in true DC Comics fashion—never offers its champions peace for long.

Chazz had learned to expect the unexpected. After all, the Fiat Force, the metaphysical power granted to him by cosmic whim or some bureaucratic deity, thrummed beneath his skin with the pulse of global currency markets. Four distinct ways the Fiat Force manifested—Investor, Divestiture, Donation, and Debt—each as cataloged as the IRS code itself. Yet, tonight, he hoped to keep his powers holstered.

It was only when the shriek of tires and the staccato pop-popping of gunfire broke his midnight reverie that Chazz realized his break would be brief.

# Nightwing’s Dilemma

Dick Grayson, acrobat turned vigilante, was no stranger to Blüdhaven’s chaos—but tonight was different. Nightwing had been tracking a new syndicate led by a slippery financier known only as “The Broker,” whose criminal empire thrived on tax evasion, shell companies, and weaponized philanthropy. The Broker’s latest scheme threatened not only the city’s coffers but also its soul.

Chazz crossed paths with Nightwing near the abandoned train depot, where the air smelled of rust and rain. The vigilante was locked in combat with a masked thug wielding what appeared to be a briefcase full of counterfeit bearer bonds.

“Agent Cash Money,” Nightwing greeted, barely dodging a wild swing. “Didn’t expect to see you here tonight.”

“Blame the city’s lack of reliable accountants,” Chazz replied, eyes narrowing as he assessed the scene. He reached into his coat, fingers brushing against crisp twenties. Instinctively, the Fiat Force flickered.

Nightwing, recognizing the gleam, grinned. “Mind lending a hand?”

Chazz nodded. He let the Investor manifestation channel through him—the currency in his pocket became more than paper; it was power. With a flick of his wrist, strength surged through his muscles, propelling him into the fray. The criminal’s bat splintered against Chazz’s forearm, the impact absorbed and dissipated by the latent value of the bills he’d pocketed.

“Nice trick,” Nightwing murmured, dispatching another thug with balletic precision.

“Just doing my job,” Chazz replied. “And speaking of jobs, you might want to check your 1099 forms this year.”

# The Red Hood’s Arrival

Before Nightwing could retort, another figure emerged from the mist—a leather-clad vigilante with a red helmet and a penchant for the dramatic. Jason Todd, the infamous Red Hood, carried an energy that was always half threat, half promise.

“Monet,” Red Hood growled, tossing a duffel bag onto the ground. “Heard you were back in town. You here to audit me?”

“Only if you’ve been holding out on your charitable donations,” Chazz shot back, half-amused.

Red Hood snorted. “Like anyone in this city gives for free.”

The Broker’s men regrouped, guns raised. Chazz, feeling the pressure mount, called on Divestiture. He plucked a handful of coins from his belt—quarters and nickels, each gleaming with possibility. With practiced dexterity, he flicked them into the crowd.

The coins sliced through the air, transformed by the Fiat Force into projectiles of astonishing power. A penny became a bullet; a quarter, a small-scale explosive. Currency shattered on impact, sacrificed to the cause of justice.

Red Hood whistled, impressed. “Remind me never to rob a bank in front of you.”

The skirmish concluded as quickly as it had begun. Nightwing cuffed the remaining thugs as Red Hood rifled through the Broker’s files, searching for clues.

# The Broker’s Scheme

Nightwing, ever the detective, laid out the evidence: “The Broker’s laundering millions through fake charities. He’s siphoning public money, and now he’s got politicians in his pocket.”

Chazz understood the implications. The Fiat Force’s Donation aspect could come in handy here. He pressed a fifty-dollar bill into Nightwing’s palm.

“This isn’t just cash,” Chazz explained. “Imbued with the Donation power, it’ll give you an edge—speed, resilience, whatever you need. But the currency will be gone once you use it.”

Nightwing nodded, tucking the bill into his utility belt. “Thanks. Let’s see how charitable giving feels in the field.”

They tracked The Broker to the penthouse of a glass tower overlooking Blüdhaven’s river. The villain was slick, his grin oily as he greeted the unexpected trio.

“Agent Monet,” The Broker purred. “Here to talk tax strategy? Or just to interfere?”

“I’m here to enforce compliance,” Chazz replied, his voice cold. “And you’re overdue.”

The confrontation was brief but intense. Chazz invoked Debt, feeling the force surge through him—every misused dollar, every stolen cent, fueling his aggression. The Broker’s smugness faltered as Chazz moved with superhuman speed and power, relentless in his pursuit.

Red Hood and Nightwing flanked him, working in tandem—a blend of acrobatics, brutality, and, thanks to Chazz’s Donation, enhanced speed. The Broker’s henchmen fell quickly.

In the heat of battle, Chazz felt the rare stirring of Dividends—the air around him shimmered as one of the Broker’s accountants, in a rare act of conscience, began transferring funds to legitimate charities. Instantly, Chazz’s powers flickered, diminishing as generosity flowed through the room.

“Dividends,” he muttered. “Never convenient.”

Nightwing seized the moment, pinning The Broker. “Looks like your deductions won’t save you now.”

# Dependency and Resolution

The Broker tried one last ploy, shifting blame onto city officials. Chazz sensed the subtle nudge of Dependency—the Fiat Force directing his focus to those entrusted with stewardship. He made mental notes for future audits; the powers rarely let him rest.

With the Broker in custody and the funds redirected, Chazz found himself standing alone on the penthouse balcony. Nightwing joined him, the city lights reflecting in his mask.

“You know, most people think superhero work is all punches and gadgets,” Nightwing said. “But you—You make finance look heroic.”

Chazz shrugged. “In Blüdhaven, someone has to balance the books.”

Red Hood, leaning against the doorframe, smirked. “Next time you’re in town, bring more quarters. And maybe audit the hot dog vendors—they’re definitely skimming.”

Chazz smiled, feeling the tension ebb. For now, his powers were quiet, the ledger closed until the next crisis. He walked back into Blüdhaven’s night, ready for whatever audit—literal or figurative—awaited him.

But as every agent knows, the city’s debts are never fully paid, and neither are its heroes.

In a second-floor workshop above a cheap restaurant in a city that smelled of grease and solder, Henry Emily tightened a bolt under a speaker and asked William Afton whether the acoustic dampening mesh would ever stop peeling in the humidity. William, who had a way of smiling around problems until he’d find a way to solve them with metal, said it would — in the next revision. He told Henry about a new tie-in, a mascot redesign, a safer lock for the springs; he sketched with a bleeding fingertip and a cigarette forgotten under the bench.

They called their venture Fazbear Entertainment because it sounded friendly. They opened a family diner called Fredbear’s, and somewhere else — later, quieter nights, more clinical lights — there would be Circus Baby’s Pizza World. Between Henry’s careful engineering and William’s knack for showmanship, the animatronics learned to sing and to wink, to crack their timers at the right laugh, and children learned, obediently, to trust the faces of metal.

Then William’s wife left.

It was not dramatic. The apartment door closed in a way that made it seem final. A small suitcase on the landing. A note. In it she wrote that she could not stay to watch the boys grow up with someone who kept his heart outside under the fluorescent lights. She left with the practical cruelty of someone who had already planned the rest of her life without him. Evan was only a newborn. Michael had the small, sore look of an eldest son who would become a parent’s second worry. Elizabeth, sandwiched between them, learned early that silence could be a weapon.

“Take care of them,” she told him once, at the doorway. “Don’t make me regret leaving.”

He promised. He promised with the heavy promise of a man who did not know how to keep it. That night he locked his hands around a glass and looked at the bump of a wrench like a ship’s wheel. Henry stayed late at the diner and helped him make a cradle. They joked about names. William named the child Evan because it sounded like a bell.

Years slid like rust under a hinge. William kept his word in the only ways he knew how — by doing. He worked; he built animatronics. He created entertainment that ate him from the inside. Mornings, he’d be the apron-dusted father tying his boys’ shoes; nights, he was the man who chased a deadline, the owner whose smile was made of schedules. The house smelled like coffee and sweat, the children’s laughter a hurtling echo against a schedule he could not break.

Michael grew ornery. Elizabeth wanted to be loved with a longing that made her quiet. Evan started waking in the night for reasons no boy should have: he whispered about shadows moving too far to be just the blink of a passing car. He described the animatronics as creatures without mouths in the dark, as monsters that watched, as mechanical grin left to rot in the wrong light. No one laughed it off as a child’s fear — William did not laugh. William tightened the bolts on the suits and told Evan they were safe because he built them.

But the child saw what the father could not: the seam of the spring lock lying like a secret, the exposed endoskeleton mocked by a painted smile. Evan began to hear voices that slipped through the gaps of things. In the daytime he painted, and at night the paintings bled. He would sit by the window and press a small palm against the glass, looking for meaning in the neon.

“He’s seen too much,” Michael would say to his friends. “He screws with people’s heads.”

“You always cover for him,” his friends laughed. Michael had his own reasons, too. Being the eldest had given him privileges and resentments. There was a raw, adolescent cruelty in his hands that hurt when no one watched.

1983 marked the year the house stopped pretending it was whole.

On Evan’s birthday the family threw a party at Fredbear’s. The room smelled of cake and wax—plastic balloons bobbed under the lights. Parents laughed and took pictures, and the animatronics performed with the mechanical precision of a good lie.

Michael and his friends wanted a prank. They wanted to be remembered as the boys who took a risk. “It’ll be funny,” Michael said to the others, who answered with the cheer of children who had not yet learned consequence. They wore their bravado like capes.

They put Evan near Fredbear’s mouth.

Maybe they thought he’d scream, maybe they thought he’d cry, maybe they thought the adults would scoop him up and tell him it was a lesson in bravery. Evan, already fragile with the private terrors of sleep, flinched when metal teeth touched him in the wrong way.

The mechanism closed.

There was a sound nobody forgot later — a wet, final slap, the way a body sheds sound after the breaking. The life left him in the party light. The room went quiet like someone had clipped the world’s outer sound. William ran. He saw, for the first time, the absolute truth of the thing he’d made and the child it had taken. Henry’s hands were white, gripping the counter like a man balancing on the edge of a high building. William could hardly breathe. In his chest was a new noise — the hollow rattle of guilt and terror.

They called it a tragic accident. The papers wrote it in shorthand: “The Bite of ’83.” They meant it to be a headline, a neat punctuation on a messy life. But history keeps odd indentations. It keeps names. It kept Evan’s.

After that, nothing was the same.

William unraveled in ways that were private and then public. He drank. He slurred and staggered and came home smelling of whiskey and oil. Henry found him half-asleep on the bench outside the restaurant more than once and dragged him home like a parent without a child. Michael retreated into a small, clenched animal. He would sometimes slip out at night and walk the city streets to the cemetery, hands in his pockets, staring at a headstone he could not move. William did not forgive so much as he punished — and he punished Michael often. He took the sorrow and sharpened it into a tool. He took the child he already blamed and struck at him until the boy learned how to run.

“This is your fault,” William said to him on a night slick with rain, his voice both low and insane-sober. “You put him there.”

“I didn’t mean—” Michael rasped.

“You meant enough,” William said. Then he hit him.

Henry came to the house the following winter with a look that suggested he had measured all the ways one could fail a friend and had catalogued each example in his mind. He asked William to stop. He told him about compassion, about the way a man’s life could be rebuilt if he let someone help.

“Let him breathe,” Henry said once, voice frayed. “Not every moment must be business. You can’t buy time with them, William.”

William looked at Henry like a man who had been shown the face of the moon through a pane of glass and found it dull. “You cover your machines with varnish and you call it finished,” William said. “You hide things. You fix numbers. You don’t face what you make.”

Henry’s jaw tightened. “You made the thing. You must bear it.”

“You should have taken responsibility,” William replied, and in that sentence hid the beginning of a philosophy that would eventually make amusement parks a hunting ground. He believed in cause and effect the way men who build monsters do: you tinker with a thing long enough, you can control its outcome. When loss terrorized him, he decided that loss could be conquered.

Charlotte Emily was Henry’s daughter. She was not a child built for headlines; she was a bright thing with big hands and a laugh that could cut sun through dust. William killed her because he wanted Henry to know loss the way he had knotted it to his own throat. It was a spite that smelled of broken trust and genius turned rancid. He did it not out of directive but out of spite — Henry had not let the police be told, had not allowed the legal machinery to grind away at William’s company’s reputation. Henry had, in William’s eyes, hidden part of the truth.

After Charlotte’s death, the Puppet—the long, thin animatronic with hollowed-out eyes—moved in the night. The first nights it had been a rumor, then the event logs standing up like hair. William, who by then had become a man with a habit of asking practical questions for impossible results, watched surveillance and saw it move when the building believed it impossible to move. He went to a voodoo practitioner, the sort of man who kept older, darker books in places that smelled like damp sugar and iron. The practitioner said one word and an explanation: Remnant. Energy that clings to memory. A shard of a soul pressed into an object. When a child is taken violently, a part of them does not simply fade. It adheres to the things around them, a static that holds shape.

“Remnant turns matter into a vessel,” the practitioner said. “If you harvest it, you can make a life refuse to leave.”

William listened the way a scientist listens to a yes, and then to the cost. He had lost a son. He had lost a job description of himself. The idea of collecting that energy — of making death answerable to him — tasted of salvation. He started small. He learned how it could be transferred, how a hand placed on an endoskeleton might carry a thing’s memory. He began to test.

The experiments were not theoretical for long.

Susie was a child who loved her dog, Clementine, more fiercely than anything. She lost Clementine when the dog ran past a back lot and into a shadow where the light didn’t want to go. William found a child searching for a lost pet and, with the gentle manners of a man who had learned how to lie, promised help.

“Bring me to the back,” he said, and in the bright, corrosive glow of his sincerity, Susie trusted him.

He did not return Clementine. He put the dog inside a machine and watched with clinical dedication as life and form separated. He stuffed the little animal’s head and heart into a torn machine and sealed it where the other children would not look. Later he led Susie to Chica and told her, with a tenderness so falsified it would have been funny in a different man, that the animatronic would help her find her dog. He lured her there and closed a door.

He stuffed Susie into Chica.

Her spirit — and Clementine’s — seeped into the machine like oil. A remnant split: part went into Mangle, part into Chica, and an oddly intimate shard lodged itself in a cupcake molded for display. The machine learned to sound like a child losing something and like a dog crying. The Puppet — Charlotte’s remnant inside the long-limbed animatronic — took notice and sheltered these new presences like a mother of lost things.

Gabriel, Jeremy, Fritz, Cassidy — names that would echo in nightmares — were taken by other hands and methods designed not to be efficient but to prove a point. William wanted proof. He wanted to see if a soul could be coaxed into machinery. He wanted to fill a jar with it and drink. He wanted to be immutable, everlasting. Each murder felt to him less like a crime and more like the careful scraping of an experimenter collecting data.

Cassidy was different. Where others drifted, Cassidy fought. Cassidy fought with a single, terrible conviction: vengeance. She was the one who would later make cruelty a religion of its own. William thought he had tamed the edge when he put her into a spring-lock — a machine that could fold a body with a sigh and latch on bone like a vice. Spring-locks were as beautiful as they were murderous. They sang the song of someone who wanted to be a joke.

To Cassidy the spring-lock was not a punchline; it was a trap that taught a lesson in a language of pain. When the mechanism failed, when the suit shifted and the metal bit and thumbed like something that wanted to learn a new grammar, something ancient and hungry in the house answered. Cassidy’s hatred would become an instrument. The thing William had made to collect love became a mouth full of teeth to swallow the maker.

Elizabeth, William’s daughter, smiled like someone waiting for a present. He took her to Circus Baby’s Pizza World on her birthday because he could not be trusted to leave any stuff to fate. He warned her not to touch some things — and then he looked away for a moment. Elizabeth, the yearning child, went toward the machine that promised the impossible: to be entertained into love. She leaned into the voice of the machine designed to coo like a mother, and the machine took her like a husband steals a name.

Circus Baby’s internal mechanisms were crueler than any of William’s earlier constructs. They were meant to invite a child to a mouth and then to close it forever in a lesson of how fragile trust can be. Elizabeth’s spirit did not stay quiet. It merged. It became part of Circus Baby. It was not at rest there. Devotions of metal and sorrow collided, and the machine learned to be human in a particular way: it desired and it remembered.

At Freddy Fazbear Pizzeria, the old place changed faces and names like a man changing coats. In 1987 the pizzeria bore new paint and new masks. William continued his work and also his hobby — the habit of killing in the name of a hypothesis. Four more children disappeared on a day that smelled like oil and caramel. The building held more secrets than a heart. Jeremy Fitzgerald, who later would be named among the lost, was a friend to Michael, and Michael’s grief became a thing with teeth.

Years passed. Time was elastic because death and metal stretched its seams. Michael grew with a map of guilt burned into his face. He grew into a man who could not quite sleep. He did odd jobs, he learned the faces of restaurants in the way a mapmaker learns coastlines. By 1993 he wanted to atone the only way his fright had left open: from inside. He took the night shift at Freddy Fazbear Pizzeria and wore a name — Mike Schmidt — so the lost would not call him Afton.

At nights he listened. The building breathed with a mechanical wheeze. Lights flickered, and shadows measured each corner like an examiner. He met eyes that were not eyes. The children’s presences were restless. They first tried to kill him because he wore the face of his father. At first they attacked the shape more than the man — because to them, William’s geometry sat on Michael like a suit of someone else’s skin. Michael told them the truth — that he had been a child, once, and that he had mourned. He said the words slow and patient: he had come to free them. They listened because the stories they had been given were short and full of holes.

Michael moved between rooms like an apology. He found the Puppet and heard Charlotte’s voice in its motion. The Puppet guarded like a bereaved mother. Charlotte’s purpose was not vengeance, at least not at first. She wanted the children to have guidance — to not be alone. Her remnant had made her a sentinel. She would shepherd these bits of children into a place where they might, at last, be more than the sum of their injuries.

William, in those years, was no longer merely a man. He had become a late-night myth. He returned to the pizzerias not as a businessman but as a hunter. He wanted the remnant the way addicts want a high. He believed immortality could be stolen. He believed that if he took enough shards, stitched them to himself, he could make a body that would not leave him. He walked into Freddy Fazbear Pizzeria with an axe and the arrogance of a man who believed that even pain could be commodified.

He killed the animatronics. He beat them into uselessness because in their stillness he thought he could find the glowing seam. He thought he could take from them what they had taken from the children. But the souls were not things to be harvested with a blade; they were living tides. When he opened their skulls, their spirits poured out and came angry and small.

He ran.

He fled into a Spring-Bonnie suit because the imitation of life had once been comfort; inside the suit, mechanisms meant for show became teeth and binding metal. Cassidy — that unquiet thing — found him. Cassidy wanted justice sculpted into a ritual — not for the press, not for pity, but because pain ought not to make room for him. She killed him in the suit. The spring-lock failed and sealed him like a fly in amber. Metal folded into him and through him and pinned him with the exactitude of a lover who had grown tired of a lie.

But death in their world was a complicated business. Cassidy did not end him. She awakened him because the world’s rules were not so simple as closure. He should have been finished. Instead, he remained, trapped and half-shredded, alive because Remnant had wrapped itself like bandage. The thing that should have been final became a living horror: Springtrap.

Michael’s later nights were worse because his father now came to him as a walking ruin. Yet Michael kept to his plan. He moved next to Circus Baby’s Pizza World to find Elizabeth. There the animatronics were more sophisticated, more cruel to human trust — Funtime animatronics designed with a different, sinister intelligence. He endured five nights of torment and machine logic. He was placed into a spring-lock for a night and felt the world fold. He was scooped — a horror like unmaking — and lived. The remnant inside him was a talisman; it patched him with a stubborn life.

Elizabeth’s remnant had a more immediate agenda. She used Michael’s body like a puppet, until Michael woke from it with a new knowledge: the horrors there were bound together by sorrow and by design. Ennard, a grotesque accumulation of wiring and stolen faces, took the pieces and left. Michael’s shell broke, but he remained. He stood with Henry. Henry had never forgiven himself, and he had never stopped trying.

They planned. They wanted to end the web that began in laughter and ended in blood. They wanted to gather the children’s spirits together and to finish William. They wanted a fire that would be righteous in its finality.

Fazbear’s Fright burned like an unholy signal. For thirty years the pizzerias lay in ruin; the city allowed rust to bloom where policies had once been drawn with eagerness. William — who had become a thing known as Springtrap — rotted and schemed in the smoke. He grew illusions: phantoms made of his own remnant to confuse and obstruct. The two men returned as ghosts of a different kind. Henry and Michael crept into that museum-like ruin, shelling out oil and burning, hiding, sleeping during the day and moving at night like old conspirators. William saw through their plot and used his remnant to make specters, illusions that preyed on the mind. The building fought back like a living thing.

When it burned, it burnt around them. They escaped. The city breathed and did not know how to look at that place again.

Henry made Lefty. Lefty was an animatronic with pockets and a purpose. Henry built it because Charlotte’s remnant was failing — because the Puppet had been wounded and almost given away. Lefty would find Charlotte and contain her. Henry set the thing to work like an odd prayer, and Lefty did what it was built to do: it found Charlotte and carried her back to Henry. Henry placed the Puppet’s remnant inside Lefty, and Charlotte’s power — once merely a wisp, then a sentinel — flickered back to life inside a new vessel.

William, who had been Springtrap, decayed into Scraptrap — a body of rot and rust that crawled like something made of teeth. He was captured by an old logic: the very remnant he wanted to possess would be turned against him. Cassidy, who had once almost eaten him with fury and hatred, had exhausted her vengeance. She had put together something like a hell for him and had continued to watch. She had taken the role of inquisitor and kept him in the place he had made for himself.

Years later — decades after the lights had gone out, after kids played with only memory — Michael and Henry gathered the children into one place. They wanted a finality that was more ceremony than conflict. They wanted to close every wound they could touch. They lit fires and made decisions. They burned down pizzerias and their own hands. In the conflagration they thought to end it.

But in that world, endings are arguments not conclusions. They did what they could. They burned their own promises. They walked into the smoke with the feeling they had finally settled the score. The remnant was gathered not like a trophy but like a reluctant family returning to a house that had forgotten them.

William was nowhere to be found for a while. When he was found, it was in a place that smelled of old metal and worse things. Cassidy had done what she set out to do. She had forced him to endure everything in a manner that suited her — cruelty. She had made him live the precise hour she wanted to teach him, and then she had been done. She let him be dragged into a torment that was not simple death but endlessness — a Baroque sort of hell.

After the deed, a man named Andrew — a darkly godlike presence who wore the business of death like a fisherman wears a coat — spoke to Cassidy. He said, in words that were simple and final, “Let him rest. Let him be. Go and be still.”

Cassidy did.

There were other ends. The children’s spirits were guided by Charlotte — by the thing that had once been a little girl and now looked like a puppet — and they were led toward something like light. The small, stubborn souls that had been stuffed into animatronic bellies were lifted to a place that was not the pizzerias. They went with Charlotte because Charlotte knew where grief sat and how it could be turned into patience.

Henry and Michael — they did their burning and bearing. They died, as far as the world counts death, inside the plan that had consumed them. They died with a ceremony attached: they set fires and closed doors, and in those flames they believed they ended a problem. Whether they truly did was not for anyone to pronounce. The children were guided to something like peace. William was cast into a hell manufactured by Cassidy; it was a living hell, specifically made for his particular cruelties. There he stayed — a cautionary figure in a land that had no use for him but for memory.

Years later, the company names still had echo. People told the stories with a nervous laugh. Children who heard them in the dark ate sugar and shivered. The pizzerias were names you said for a dare. That was the world they had left behind — a tangle of amusement and mourning where machines learned to be faces.

All along, there was this one stubborn truth: bureaucracy could explain a lot, but it could not explain what happens when a father builds a machine to be a friend and that machine takes the shape of a son. William had started with an earnest show and ended with an experiment in immortality. Fate had given him neither absolution nor the eternity he desired. Instead he got punishment – a long, iron-quiet ending that is the scold of myth.

Charlotte rests. The children rest. Henry and Michael built their own obituaries into the strategy; they wrote their redemption in fire and went where they wanted to go. Cassidy — who wanted the last laugh — laid down her own weapon and slept. Andrew, who collects ends, returned to his fishing. The city kept the names like talismans.

And somewhere beneath the dust, in the dark workshop where bolts still waited for purchase, a robot’s eye flickered like a candle that had learned to spark itself from memory. The machines, after all, are patient.

They remember.

1n2wax3,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1n2wax3/went_from_chipotle_runs_to_actually_feeling/,went from Chipotle runs to actually feeling productive in college,"A few months into college. I was just surviving on Chipotle, coffee, and whatever snacks I could grab between classes, and honestly, I was feeling like crap. My grades were okay, but I knew I could do better. My energy was low, my room was messy and there was no sequence for anything.

I decided to make a change. First, I started meal prepping. Instead of spending ten dollars every lunch on burritos, I cooked for myself a few times a week. It was actually kind of fun experimenting with recipes, and I saved money too. That extra cash made me think about my finances, which I had completely ignored until then. I set up a fizz card to track my spending and start building my credit responsibly. Seeing exactly where my money was going made a bigger difference than I expected and motivated me to be smarter with my budget.

Next, I focused on working out. Before, I would always say I would go laterbut  I never did. I started with short, consistent sessions in my dorm or at the campus gym. Even just twenty minutes made me feel more energised and focused in class.

Studying got better too. I started blocking out time. I planned my week, reviewed notes daily, and took breaks that didn’t involve scrolling Insta. Productivity started feeling like a habit instead of a chore.

It’s still a work in progress and I procrastinate, but seeing all the small wins stack up, the meals I prepped, the workouts I didn’t skip, and my money tracked with credit improving feels really good. I don’t miss just surviving on burritos.

If anyone else is struggling with college chaos and wants to get their life in order, start small. Meal prep one week, plan study sessions, and track your spending. Little wins really add up, which will eventually make you productive and better. ",0,1756436632.0,productivity,1,0.5,False

1n2w8rp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1n2w8rp/dating_tips_for_women/,Dating Tips for women,"40F , and I always read the negative posts and complaints here, but my dating experience—seven years post-divorce—has been very positive! Yes, you’ll encounter the occasional jerk, but by and large, American men are wonderful, kind, and respectful. They often try their best to impress you. Not everyone is everyone’s cup of tea or shot of tequila, but be kind and respectful along your dating journey.

Here’s what worked for me:

1. Don’t judge a book by its cover. Men SUCK at selfies and profile descriptions (unless they’re narcissists or womanizers), and most look much better in person. I also work w men and some of the best & most interesting guys are very plain & simple when you meet them at first. 


2.Consider the app’s AI suggestions. Apps like Bumble use AI to analyze messages and data points about both parties. The algorithm GENUINELY seeks compatibility, so it’s worth considering its recommendations. One time AI recommended me a guy, I did NOT like anything about his profile. Because I work in tech I decided to give it a shot and swiped right. Ended up having a call 🤙 & a really fun date. He looked super handsome in person & we dated for about a year. We ultimately broke up because he had some other struggles but I still have a lot of love and respect for him. 

3. Have a phone call before the first date. People have a certain energy / vibe to them, and you’ll sense whether you connect. If you get along over the phone, your date will likely be enjoyable.


4. GO EASY on men ffs. Don’t make the first date overly complicated. Women with rigid first-date preferences might as well order your 76 cats. Keep it simple—a hike or a cup of coffee works well. Don't even get me started w restaurant preferences. Just don't. 

5. Be clear about your needs. We don’t need everything from men, some things are just nice to have. Identifying what you truly need makes dating easier.

6. Maintain a positive attitude—we are self-fulfilling prophecy machines. For example: if you’re one of those women who think every guy is a jerk, no decent, healthy male will feel compelled to connect with you & do anything nice for you. If you can’t see the good qualities men bring to the table and have already made up your mind, why would they try? As a result you never actually get to experience the positive side of men, so you will hover over jerks.With that mindset, you’re unlikely to meet a decent guy because of your own attitude.

7. Sunsets and sunrises, left and right, nice people and jerks—all exist simultaneously. Learn to identify and appreciate each in their own way

8. Relationships are hard, but dating over 40 is fun. Men over 40 already know who they are, what they want, what they don't want, what they have and don't have and they navigate with much more courage and integrity. That's refreshing. Appreciate it. 


Happy dating and I do hope every one of you will find an awesome guy. Too many out there ",13,1756436467.0,Bumble,19,0.71,False

1n2w81c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minority_Strength/comments/1n2w81c/who_were_toussaint_louverture_and_jeanjacques/,Who were Toussaint Louverture and Jean-Jacques Dessalines?,"Do you know these names?

Jean-Jacques Dessalines 
(September 1758 – 17 October 1806) was the first Haitian Emperor, leader of the Haitian Revolution, and the first ruler of an independent Haiti under the 1805 constitution.

Born around 1758, in Africa, Jean-Jacques Dessalines was enslaved in the French colony of Saint-Domingue. He served as a lieutenant under Toussaint L'Ouverture after the 1791 slave revolt and later eliminated French rule. 
Dessalines renamed the colony Haiti in 1804 and declared himself emperor.

The enslaved people of Haiti freed themselves during the Haitian Revolution (1791-1804), a decade-long slave revolt that resulted in the abolition of slavery and the establishment of the first independent Black republic. 

The Haitian Revolution:
A series of conflicts fought by enslaved people against their French colonizers, beginning in 1791. 

Toussaint Louverture:
A former slave who became a formidable military leader, rising to prominence during the revolution and leading the fight for the abolition of slavery. 

Napoleon's Intervention:
In an attempt to restore French control and reinstate slavery, Napoleon Bonaparte sent an expedition in 1802, leading to Louverture's capture and deportation to France. 

Jean-Jacques Dessalines:
Louverture's successor, Dessalines led the revolutionary forces to victory over the French, culminating in a decisive battle in November 1803. 

Independence and Abolition:
On January 1, 1804, Dessalines declared the independence of Haiti and confirmed the permanent abolition of slavery, making Haiti the first country in the Americas founded by former slaves.🇭🇹🇭🇹

*So exactly WHAT was going on there*?

Slavery was started in Haiti by the Spanish colonizers shortly after Christopher Columbus's arrival in 1492, who initially enslaved the indigenous Taíno people. 
When the Taíno population dwindled due to disease and brutal labor, the Spanish, and later the French colonizers, turned to the transatlantic slave trade and forcibly brought enslaved Africans to the island to work on plantations. 

After Columbus's arrival, the Spanish quickly enslaved the native Taíno and Ciboney people to mine for gold and work on plantations. 

The indigenous population was devastated by brutal working conditions and European diseases, leading to their near extinction by the late 16th century. 

Spain ceded the western portion of the island to France in the 17th century, which became known Sainte-Domingue.
The French established a lucrative colony built on the severe exploitation of enslaved Africans who were forcibly brought to the island.

*Transform your daily routine from mindless scrolling to meaningful action*

---

## The Morning Question That Changes Everything ☀️

Picture this: You wake up tomorrow morning, grab your phone, and instead of asking ""What notifications do I have?"" you ask yourself ""What meaningful thing will I accomplish today?""

This simple shift in thinking can revolutionize how you experience each day. Most of us have been conditioned to chase comfort, entertainment, and instant gratification. But what if there's a better way to measure whether our day was truly worthwhile?

## The Pleasure Trap We All Fall Into 📱

We live in an age of endless distractions. Netflix shows that auto-play, social media feeds that never end, and streaming services competing for our attention 24/7. It's easier than ever to fill our days with activities that feel good in the moment but leave us feeling empty afterward.

Think about your last ""perfect lazy day."" You probably binged a series, ordered takeout, and scrolled through your phone for hours. How did you feel at the end of that day? Satisfied? Fulfilled? Or maybe a bit... hollow?

Here's the thing: pleasure is like sugar for the soul. It gives you a quick high, but it doesn't sustain you. And just like sugar, the more you consume, the more you need to feel the same level of satisfaction.

## The Purpose Alternative That Actually Works 🚀

Now imagine a different kind of day. Maybe you spent three hours learning a new skill that frustrated you. Perhaps you helped a neighbor move furniture when you'd rather have stayed in bed. Or you worked on a project that challenged every fiber of your being.

These activities might have been harder, more demanding, even uncomfortable. But here's what's remarkable: at the end of such days, you feel genuinely satisfied. You sleep better. You wake up with energy. You feel like you're moving forward rather than just marking time.

## Why Our Brains Trick Us Into Choosing Easy 🧠

Your brain is wired for survival, not success. It constantly pushes you toward the path of least resistance because, thousands of years ago, conserving energy meant staying alive. But in today's world, this ancient programming often works against us.

Every time you choose the easy option, you're reinforcing neural pathways that make future easy choices more likely. It's like creating a mental highway that leads straight to mediocrity.

Breaking this cycle requires conscious effort, but the payoff is enormous.

## The Daily Practice That Builds Character 💪

Start each morning by identifying one challenging but meaningful task. It doesn't have to be life-changing. Small purposeful actions compound over time:

**Personal Growth:**
- Read 20 pages of a challenging book instead of scrolling news
- Practice a skill that pushes your comfort zone
- Have a difficult but necessary conversation

**Contributing to Others:**
- Volunteer for an hour at a local organization
- Teach someone something you know well
- Help solve a problem in your community

**Building Something Lasting:**
- Work on a creative project that excites you
- Organize and improve your living space
- Develop a side business or valuable skill

## The Compound Effect of Purposeful Days 📈

Here's where it gets interesting. One day of choosing purpose over pleasure might not feel dramatically different. But string together 30 such days, then 90, then 365, and you'll barely recognize your life.

People who consistently choose meaningful challenge over easy comfort develop:
- Stronger resilience when facing setbacks
- Deeper confidence in their abilities  
- More interesting stories and experiences
- Stronger relationships built on shared goals
- A sense of momentum in life rather than stagnation

## Practical Strategies for Daily Implementation ⚡

**The 3-Hour Rule:** Dedicate the first three hours of your day to purposeful activity before allowing any entertainment or passive consumption.

**The Challenge List:** Keep a running list of meaningful but difficult tasks. When you catch yourself defaulting to easy options, pick one from this list instead.

**The Contribution Habit:** End each day by doing something, however small, that benefits someone else. This could be as simple as leaving a thoughtful comment on someone's post or preparing something nice for tomorrow's breakfast.

**The Progress Journal:** Each evening, write down one way you grew or contributed rather than what entertained you. This rewires your brain to notice and value purposeful activities.

## When Purpose Feels Impossible 😮‍💨

Some days, the idea of choosing challenge over comfort feels overwhelming. Maybe you're dealing with stress, illness, or major life changes. During these times, remember that purpose doesn't always mean grand gestures.

On tough days, purpose might mean:
- Maintaining basic self-care routines
- Reaching out to one person who matters to you
- Doing one small thing to improve tomorrow
- Simply showing up when you'd rather hide

The goal isn't perfection; it's direction.

## The Long-Term Vision That Sustains You 🔮

Imagine looking back on your life decades from now. Which days would you remember with pride? The days you conquered a new level in a video game, or the days you learned something that changed how you think? The afternoons spent mindlessly browsing, or the afternoons spent building something meaningful?

This isn't about judgment—we all need rest and entertainment. It's about balance and intentionality. It's about recognizing that the most fulfilling days often begin with the question ""What can I contribute?"" rather than ""What can I consume?""

## The Ripple Effect Beyond Yourself 🌊

When you choose purpose over pleasure, you don't just change your own life. You become someone others can rely on. You model possibility for people around you. You contribute to solutions rather than just consuming resources.

Your family notices your energy and engagement. Your friends see your growth and feel inspired to pursue their own goals. Your community benefits from your contributions. This is how individual choices create collective change.

## Building Your Purpose-Driven Tomorrow 🌅

Starting tomorrow, experiment with this approach:

**Morning:** Before checking any device, identify one meaningful task for the day.

**Afternoon:** When you feel the urge for mindless entertainment, pause and ask ""What would serve me better right now?""

**Evening:** Reflect on moments when you chose growth over comfort, contribution over consumption.

Remember, this isn't about becoming a productivity machine or eliminating all joy from your life. It's about recognizing that true satisfaction comes not from how much pleasure you can extract from a day, but from how much meaning you can create.

The most remarkable thing about choosing purpose over pleasure is this: you don't actually sacrifice happiness. You discover a deeper, more lasting form of it. You trade the fleeting high of instant gratification for the sustained satisfaction of genuine accomplishment.

Every day, you get to choose. Every morning presents the same opportunity. Will today be measured by what entertained you, or by what you contributed to the world?

The answer to that question shapes not just your day, but ultimately, your entire life.

Details Inside, Feel Free to Share Your Ideas!","Okay. So I've made dozens, if not *hundreds* of references to this before over the last couple years. And I made a few posts about it before, but I want to share even more details about it as my ideas are becoming much more clear. 

And most importantly, I'm looking for some ideas from this very sub and will give credit where it's due. Because I don't really think I can do this alone. And yes, I do intend to put together a full screenplay of this and present it to whoever may be interested. Possibly Jeff Rake himself, or at least one of his publicists or whatever gatekeepers I'd need to convince.

So without further ado, I give you Pi11ars, a fan created sequel to Manifest.

Okay. No time to waste, let's get right into it. Get some coffee or a beer or something. This will be a long freakin' read.

To me, there are three tensions I came up with after watching the ending of the show. Here they are.

**Tension #1 - Will what transpired during the show take place again? And if it does, when will it take place and who else may be affected?**

If there were to be a sequel, *this* is what it should be all about. Because how do we know that what transpired won't happen again? Or maybe even earlier? Or involve different individuals? Individuals that the passengers who passed the divine's test may need to save? Who knows.

This is what a proper sequel or spin off or whatever should be all about. *Especially* if the passengers have knowledge of the future. Because whether we like it or not, this ending created a Terminator like scenario where even though the passengers are gonna try to change whatever negative things took place during the show, it might cause different things to happen. Things that might be worse.

For example, Grace may be murdered by someone else instead of Angelina. And it may happen *sooner.*

**Tension #2 - How do we know this isn't a time loop? How do we know there isn't gonna be a death date? How do we know it isn't earlier?**

Related to the first tension, this is the next thing that a sequel should be about. Because news flash, just because the passengers ""escaped"" the death date doesn't mean that there isn't another one that might be on the horizon. And in my opinion, there probably is. And that's because...

**Tension #3 - What** ***actually*** **happened to the passengers that turned to ash? And what happened to the timeline the passengers left?**

Okay. I know what most of you are thinking ""well come on j0elsuf, they turned to ash. They don't exist anymore. Duh.""

Well how do you just *know* that? Especially when Daly turned to ash *after* going back to 2013? How come that couldn't happen to the other passengers who turned to ash? You can accuse me of overanalyzing as much as you want, but there *has* to be something to that.

And this isn't something I haven't said on this sub dozens or even hundreds of times, but I'm sorry. The timeline the passengers left didn't just magically *disappear.* That's not how time travel works in storytelling. If you go ahead in time, the timeline you went to will *still exist* whether you like it or not. There have been *hundreds* of shows/movies/video games before Manifest that have established this storytelling precept.

So yeah. That timeline still exists. And guess what? Best believe it's gonna affect the world that the passengers returned to. It *has* to.

Because if it *didn't,* and if a sequel *only* contained Vance (and maybe the major) lookin for the passengers and all the stuff the fandom wants (Michaela hookin up with Zeke, Cal recovering from cancer, Saanvi and Alex establishing their relationship), *no one* would truly like it. Because it would be far too predictable. Those things should happen in a sequel, but other stuff has to happen as well.

So Pi11ars will address those three tensions. But how will it address those tensions? This was where I got waaaaay too creative for my own good. And it's where I'm taking a big risk. And that's because...

**Pi11ars will introduce a brand new cast of characters, the majority of whom are from Angelina's past. And yes, it will contain an arc where Angelina (As well as Daly, Autumn, and Paul) turns over a new leaf.**

When I first started this, that third tension above was the only one I focused on. I came up with a plot where the punished 11 (or 13 or whatever) passengers were sent ahead in time again from June 2nd 2024 to January 2nd 2030. Four of them (Daly, Angelina, Autumn, and Paul) get callings of not only a death date that takes place on March 3rd 2033 in their timeline, but November 11th 2018 in the timeline that the passengers returned to.

You see, the fact that we know next to nothing about Angelina before 828 kinda irked me. We get decent backstory about a lot of the other passengers but next to nothing about Angelina. We don't even know why she went to freakin Jamaica in the first place. But that eventually became my muse for Pi11ars, and allowed me to build whole *worlds* around the very blank canvas that was Angelina's past before 828.

I'll admit, I went a little crazy with this. I gave Angelina a half-sister who is pretty much the exact opposite of her (think of every femme fatale trope you can come up with; that's Angelina's half-sister lol), and this half-sister goes out with a kid sister of Danny's. So yes, Danny is somewhat connected to Angelina. Sarah, the major's daughter, is another half-sister of Angelina's. And that's because it becomes established in Pi11ars that the major is Angelina's real mother.

Then I started thinking: What if I created some characters who grew up with Angelina but who also encountered some of the *other* characters from Manifest at some point before 828? Like what if one had Ben as a professor in college? Or if one delivered food to Grace from that restaurant she liked so much? Or one who encountered Michaela at that skating rink she hung out at all the time? Or if a couple of them were in a band that TJ was auditioning for or something? It's all connected, indeed.

And now that these characters (who went to Jamaica with Angelina but who were on the same flight as Grace and Olive when going back btw) are now looking for Angelina, they'll have to learn about what happened to her in the era that Ben, Michaela et al came from. And it'll be up to certain passengers to guide them. And *that* is because...

**Characters in Pi11ars will still get callings, but only very few will.**

Yup, callings will still be a thing in my sequel. And they'll be almost *totally* based in memory because I liked that aspect of the callings the most.

And different from Manifest, the callings in Pi11ars will be graphic and *very* transparent, as if it's the divine saying ""yo. This *will* happen unless you do something!"" I always thought the callings should have had a horror element to them and in Pi11ars they will. In spades.

So that's what Pi11ars will be about: It'll be about a core group of 828 passengers (Ben, Michaela, Saanvi, TJ, Violet, a few others) helping a core group of passengers on Grace and Olive's flight with their callings. Including Grace and Olive themselves.

Yes, Grace and Olive *will* get callings in Pi11ars. And the ones Olive gets will be so unsettlingly scary that you'll be just as afraid as she gets. You know how Olive had to see therapists and stuff in between those 5 and 1/2 years during Manifest? Well in Pi11ars she will still be seein therapists and stuff, but it'll be because of the callings she's now getting.

And lastly, let's cover the villains of Pi11ars. Starting with...

**The major - Pi11ars will see her at her very worst. But she'll still get killed.**

Anyone who has seen my posts knows that I'm a fanboy for the major. And she is going to be at her very worst in this sequel. She'll do everything she did during Manifest and, because it's revealed that she's Angelina's true mother, she'll be going after those who grew up with her.

It'll be eerily entertaining just like she was during Manifest, too. And like with Angelina, I also built worlds around the major. Given all the military experience she has, I have plenty to work with.

But have no fear. The major will be stopped. But by who? She'll be stopped by a villain I'm creating who you'll have no choice but to dislike. Imagine a cross between Aileen Wuornos, Terry Silver from Karate Kid/Cobra Kai, and Bryce from 13 Reasons Why. That's who's gonna stop the major.

But I don't wanna spoil this too much. And admittedly, this is slowly becoming something of my own creation, with the Manifest-iverse or whatever as a backdrop. But! I'm still open to ideas. Let me know if you enjoyed this. I almost want to create my own sub for this, but idk. I do have a discord channel for it where I upload scripts and stuff. Hit me up if you're down for joining that.

Once again, happy 8/28, everyone. Follow your callings, it's all connected, preserve the lifeboat, etc etc etc.",1,1756435894.0,ManifestNBC,0,1.0,False

- Straight 
- Christian
- Single. Never been engaged nor married. 
- No kids.
- Curvy in all the right places, plus size.
- Pleasing to the eyes (your mileage may vary, but so far the reviews are good 😏)

By day, I’m a healthcare professional (fancy way of saying I help keep people alive and functioning 🩺). By night and during my days off, I’m probably sipping coffee or matcha at a cozy café, pretending to “study” but actually people-watching… or getting lost in a book I picked up from FullyBooked.

I love wearing dresses, strolling through bookstores like it’s a sacred ritual, and walking around the city with my earphones in, imagining I’m in the opening scene of a movie chzz haha. I’m also a sucker for fog-covered mountains, road trips with no real destination, and city lights that feel like they’re winking back at you. Oh, and dogs? Absolutely. 💯 

I’m also a bit of an introvert. I recharge in quiet, meaningful spaces. But if the vibe is right, you’ll see my playful and adventurous side.

What I’m looking for… A guy who’s an equally accomplished professional, intelligent, economically secure, and can start a conversation that goes beyond “hi” and “hello”. Also, someone warm, caring, nice, grounded, endless thoughtful, and just as pleasing to the eyes as the scenery I adore.

- Age 27-35 years old
- Are well-groomed, carry yourself confidently 
- Single. Not in a romantic relationship whatsoever. Never been married. (Best if you can provide a CENOMAR cert when we meet 😂)
- No human kids 
- Christian (genuinely God-fearing)
- Love and/or have dogs
- Enjoy spontaneous long drives
- Can appreciate the charm of bookstores and late-night cafés
- Preferably you’re in **Cebu City / Mandaue City** (easier for coffee dates and spontaneous drives)

If this sounds like you…
Send me a DM and tell me: 
- About yourself comprehensively, like the important aspects in your background, current work, and/or long-term goals AND

I picked up the phone and dialed 411 (this used to be a handy way to get phone numbers, for all you kids) and sure enough, they gave me his number. Without much thought I called the number. A gravelly voice answered the phone and said hello. I said, ""Hi, can I speak with Jack Kirby?"" That was the start of an amazing adventure. We spoke for 20 minutes and at the end of the call he asked where I lived. I told him and he said, ""That's not too far from me. Why don't you get your mom to drive you over here this weekend and I can sign all your comics?"" My Mom, bless her, said yes and we drove to Thousand Oaks that weekend. As promised, he signed all my comics and we talked for an hour while my mom and Roz Kirby drank lots of coffee and smoked cigarettes (at least mom did!). Later we sat in their kitchen and ate sandwiches. Before we left, Jack Kirby gave me a portfolio and then sat down and drew this for me. One of the greatest experiences of my life, an unbelievable act of kindness and generosity. Happy Birthday to the King. Comics fans owe you so much more than they realize.

After she told me I did research so I can learn how to best support her. Correct me if I’m wrong, but this concern is coming from the research I’ve done. One of the concerning things I’ve noticed is that her blood sugar is in the 300+ range almost all the time. From what I’ve read, this is not good but she keeps insisting it’s normal. She has mentioned not being able to see and hear as well as she used to and I can’t help but wonder if this is caused by that. The other concerning thing is her diet. She usually starts off the day with a large blended Dutch bros coffee which contains 125g of sugar, has either Taco Bell or McDonalds for lunch, snacks on candy throughout the day, has whatever I make for dinner, then usually a whole pint of Ben and Jerry’s for desert. I’m by no means an expert, but this just seems like too much sugar for someone with type 1 diabetes. I’ve tried to help her by encouraging her to try sugar free coffees and offering to make a well balanced lunch for her but she refuses. I’m at a loss of what to do.

I’m looking for a real and lasting relationship, a partner in crime for concerts, late night walks, random adventures, and maybe even a cycling date. Life’s better when you’ve got someone to pedal, laugh, and grow with through the chaos.

About me:

- Fun sized at 5’6”
- Inked on both arms, each tattoo comes with a story I may or may not oversell
- Chubby, but currently in “plot twist” and “do not disturb” mode with weight loss
- Cyclist who enjoys long rides as much as long walks at night
- Plays the guitar. Bonus if you like serenades, because I firmly believe I can sing
- Casual gamer who still yells at the screen when I lose to a bot in FIFA 😃
- Works mid shift from 3 PM to 12 MN, which basically makes me a night owl disguised as an employee
- Loves long walks at night. Romantic strolls or fast food quests, your call

About you, my possible 2025 plot twist:

- Single, and yes I’m repeating this like a Spotify hook because it’s that important
- Has actual time to date, because connections are built with presence not promises
- Can hold a conversation, and I mean a two way one, not a podcast episode where only one person speaks
- Witty enough to keep up with playful banter without spraining your brain
- Can match my energy, whether that’s headbanging at a gig, cycling side by side, or laughing at nonsense at 2 AM
- Nerds out about music and loves live shows
- Tattooed is optional, but cool ink stories are always welcome
- Believes cuddling and hand holding should be Olympic sports
- Speaks her mind and doesn’t sugarcoat the important stuff
- Not a DDS
- And once again, single, because apparently that still needs a sequel

I mainly came here to see if anyone has left a property they were renting - apartment/house either one , particularly people who had trouble with their landlords / property management , did they give you a hard time ? . I’ve lived at my complex for about 2 years now . I’ve had nothing but trouble with the property management , maintenance & the issues in the unit from the night I moved in literally the night I moved in there was a leak from my air vent .. I live in a basement level unit so I ( and the others on the basement level of course ) get the worst of the leaks etc , upon move in I did an inspection ( alone which is uncommon for me ) I noticed many things were wrong . Even though they claimed the unit was professionally cleaned the carpet was covered in cat hair ( I’m not exaggerating) now I’m HIGHLY allergic like my eyes swell shut I sneeze bad & I have asthma so it feels like death when I make a wrong move around cats , I wrote that in my report as well as documented there wasn’t a microwave how it claimed in the inspection list , the bathtub was stripped (they must’ve been painting over damage ) my bedroom door was off the top hinge .. dished from previous tenants were still in the dishwasher. The cabinets are white and you could tell they weren’t cleaned . What looked like coffee was still on the side of the wall .. I’m sure there’s more but those are what I remember, there have been about 6 water leaks 2 being severe with 1 busting out of my cabinets .. the old maintenance man ( who was the father of a guy who’s stalked me for about 7-8 years ) was polite enough to let us wash and dry our towels we used to clean up with for free .. not even a week later we have another bad leak .. well the usual guy came in said he was now part time ( haven’t seen him since ) and he left another guy came by lets call him ice tea because that’s who he resembles , he came by and the old maintenance men would come by laugh about it and take 20-30 mins to even come back well he assessed the situation and handled it , turned off the water and said he’d speak with the manager figure out what to do next . Didn’t get the free wash of the laundry we had to use ( still washed it with our own coins not to mention the washer and dryers absolutely suck but we are having transportation issues so only option last minute ) I’m going to skip a day ahead the maintenance man randomly knocked on the door ( now ik it their job to care for units , buildings etc ) but normally we are warned if someone’s coming by and he gave no warning , he wanted to come in and check our carpet ( there was a small spot that in my opinion didn’t need checking it had a drying unit in front of it and we usually put them back in the hall when we are done using it ) well he knocked let him check on it he left , I let the office know id like to be warned dude to not only him but the carpet company coming in as well , how I grew up you’re always supposed to make your home and self look presentable before allowing someone in .. let me say this day my house was not all that tidy I have children & if you have kids you know once you clean up they go right back over it , well I text the office he responds and agrees to let me know next time , I’d say a week goes by , the toilet in the room my kids use is leaking and I see the base of the floor collecting mold ( I’m like 100% sure it’s mold , there’s mold in so many spots here and I can’t do anything but spray it with this spray I have and move alone hoping it doesn’t come back. I’ve reported it before but they don’t do much but paint over it and like me they hope it doesn’t come back & it does it got to the point the ignore most of my requests come by look at it and say it’s something else ) okay so the new guy and landlord ( male ) comes in they look say toilet needs a new band & base boards aren’t molding they didn’t even say it was mildew .. mind you we had a mild leak in that bathroom through the exhaust fan that in-fact created mold in my main bathroom (that’s what they painted over and left which it’s back visible) now back when that leak happened they sent someone to fix the walls he never touched my bathroom took a piece of wall from second bathroom left I asked about my bathroom they came in I heard the 2 guys whispering about what to do , one said something about how they needed to tear that wall down the other goes “shhh” they finished talking left & guy comes back & that’s when they painted and left  it to marinate, now back to ice tea and landlord they’re here talking basically contradicting themselves bc they knew what I said was right . And I’ve came to the conclusion these people don’t want to fix anything bc it will have to come out of their pocket .. they have upped the rent twice and still don’t have enough to make repairs? Okay so I’ll skip a lot to get to my point , they basically called the same guy that did the first bathroom repair and I kid you not he painted over what was on the boards .. I complained and they acted surprised.. they come back remove them be on their way .. now I have a terrible memory but do have all of what I’ve experienced documented just not looking at it I’m sure things happened after this and before but this is just what I’m remembering on spot . So what is bringing me here today . I made a complaint for the second time about my mail box . In the past I’ve caught it wide open and was able to close it without needing to unlock it ( the lock was turned by the postal worker even tho it wasn’t closed ) well I complained they came by said nothing was wrong okay I left it alone , recently they have been complaining about mail on the floor so when I caught my box open yesterday I tried to make another complaint hoping with new workers they’d actually help , do the request apparently they still saw nothing wrong . Now when you make the complaint there’s an option that says like for quick response or what ever do we have approval for entry and there’s like no , yes or n/a entry not needed so I clicked that … Ice tea still came by ? My child’s father answers ( I’ve been having kidney and heart troubles so yes he’s been a angel and helping me out more than usual) I’m not sure why that upset the guy & I know I did leave a lot of my experiences with him out due to memory or me thinking I could be just assuming but let me add I don’t wear a bra all the time … but the first time Ice tea and the landlord came by child’s father wasn’t there and I had no bra on and kept my arms crossed the entire time let me add even when you put maintenance requests in they never come on the day or time you placed it for so again caught way off guard, aside from being vulnerable I can’t think of any other reason why a man answering my door would’ve upset him , he marked it as complete came to the door told child’s father nothing was wrong , I texted the office voicing how this is the second time nothing was corrected about the box ( I get it it’s a mail box but with all of the other things they don’t want to fix yes I get frustrated with every little thing they try to over look ) well this lady replied for me to call ice tea .. I said that is who said nothing was wrong with it … basically this guy went back to the office and I’m not sure what words he used but told the lady ( she’s not based In My city so he had to of called her ) and told her a guy answered my door I’m assuming so she texts back saying when can I meet with him at the box .. and then says oh he said a guy answered ( I’ll add the messages now again I’m always on high alert with these people they try to do and say anything to make you look bad or like you’re doing something wrong so yes I may look as if I’m beating around the bush or being rude but like what did my children or the father have to do with the mail box ? Well after my last text she still tried to mention the mail box & no I did not reply i felt like she was trying to argue ( usually how every text from management always feels ) so I tend to not respond today was one of those days I responded but tried to keep it together.. now sorry for the sob story my over all question was would I be over acting to abandon my lease ? Do you think they would try to take me to court ( which would backfire on their behalf due to me having a truck load of evidence of negligence and health hazards ) my lease isn’t up for a couple of months so I’d be in debt if I moved but I’m starting to think it would be in everyone’s best interest . ( I would still pay the rent on time if they give me the option to ) let me know if I was wrong and if I should just not reply in the future which if it’s nothing big I’ll probably just not put a maintenance request in and let them take it out of my deposit. She may have just been curious it it was honestly the wrong time and if they can clearly see my lease then why constantly nag for an answer? ",1,1756435134.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

EO is an incredibly demanding sect of Christianity that appears to offer enlightenment, mystery, and mysticism. Originally, I found their perspective on God's essence and energies/Theosis unique and exciting. Now, I see that it's really just a Buddha-zation of Christianity (the desire for unlocking Theosis is truly quite selfish) and that underneath their zen exterior is an animus towards scholasticism and critical thinking. When questioned on a theological point, they fall back on their laurels and say, ""But do *they* have a St. Paisos?""

I believe that the cult-like aspect (besides the glaring example of Mount Athos and all of monkdom) is that they expect so much from the parishioners in regards to money and time--and does that money and time go to worthy causes or helping the needy? No. It's directly funneled back into the church and for the continued existence of the church. It's truly a shame that they aren't a greater presence for good in America. Between the constant church services, volunteering, pressure to attend social events and coffee hours--I found myself so spent that I didn't even have the bandwidth or desire to read my Bible. 

Lastly, I have seen derision towards the elderly and poor, legalistic paranoia about fasting, hatred towards the Jews, and objectification of women.

For starters I'm 19 yrs old and started the job initially 8 hour days 5 days a week and my mom is also working there with me it's at a small (but popular) family owned coffee roasting business which is abt a 35 min drive away from where I currently live and since I started at 8am to 4pm I had to wake up at 7am which I'm not used to at all so I got my hours bumped down to 6 hours a day and am now starting at 10am - 4pm same with my mom but for different reasons.

For some of the benefits I have great coworkers, a great boss who is very understanding and lenient, 30 min paid lunch, generally easy work.

downsides is that it's an extremely loud place since it's a factory, pay isn't the best but not the worst, and the 35 min drive there and back every day.

I just don't know why I'm so freaked out about it I've been spending the last few days the night before work bawling my eyes out due to just pure worry about whats to come and I shouldn't be worried since I like the job and the people I'm just thinking I might have some major anticipatory anxiety or it's just such a drastic change to my life that I'm having trouble handling it and it's making me worry about EVERY little thing in my life even my parents dying in the future and how I'll handle myself without them and more recently some crazy life or death shit just happened to my cousin and it's been making me feel that more the past couple days.

It just feels like I'm throwing away some freedoms and that thought alone is overwhelming even at my last job where I was working 4 hour days starting at like 11am some days and 6pm other days I would still go to sleep at night dreading the next work day I just need major advice or some way to relax my mind.",1,1756434929.0,jobs,0,0.67,False

A Due Diligence

Currently trading at 3-3.2$ a share and I am convinced it will be trading above 100$ within a five to ten year time horizon.

Fundamentals and Overview
Richtech defines their company mission as, “By harnessing the power of collaborative robotic solutions, Richtech is redefining the service industry landscape. Our mission is to drive a revolutionary automation of tasks, enhancing customer experiences, and enabling businesses to unlock their full potential.”

“Richtech Robotics partners with NVIDIA through the NVIDIA Connect program to integrate NVIDIA's AI and accelerated computing technologies, such as the Jetson Orin platform and Isaac Sim, into their service robots like Adam and Scorpion. This collaboration enhances Richtech's robots with improved body movement detection accuracy, faster development times through simulation, and more efficient navigation in complex environments. The partnership aims to accelerate Richtech's mission to make AI-driven service robots a common sight in industries such as hospitality, retail, and restaurants.” As we have seen over the last five to ten years, NVIDIA has become the industry leader in the AI and semiconductor market. With a market cap of over 4.4 trillion dollars, NVIDIA is positioned as the backbone of the technological landscape for the foreseeable future. Because of this, NVIDIA will be able to consistently supply Richtech with the most up to date technology for their line of robotics. Additionally, NVIDIA has a 50% voting share of the company so will be able to guide them financially as they make their transition from unprofitable to profitable. 

Market Opportunity
A majority of my positive sentiment comes from the FACT that low-skill jobs will be phased out of existence within a 10-20 year time horizon. I believe trade skills (electricians, mechanics, etc.) will be one of the few blue collar job markets that will survive the coming AI and tech revolution. However, back to low-skill jobs, I fully believe jobs like assembly line workers, fast food workers, cashiers, hostesses and waiters, taxi and uber drivers, and many more will become obsolete as robotics transition into becoming a cheaper labor option. Yes, I know a majority of robotics companies are in the very early trial phase, and many of the existing prototypes have not become fully functional. While that may be a bearish sign for the robotics market now, I believe it only provides RR with less barriers to entry in the coming years. As I said before, Richtech is financially backed by NVIDIA and operates on their platforms. This allows RR to put more focus into the development of their robotics as they have a 4.4 trillion dollar market giant lining their pockets.

Enough about NVIDIA, let’s continue to discuss RR’s market opportunity in the future. As consumer and commercial robotics transition into the global labor market, companies like Richtech have the opportunity to become the face of an entirely new industry. I really love this stock, and believe robotics poses a similar market opportunity to Apple in 2008. As we have seen with every form of new technology that comes out, initial reactions are typically all over the place, often siding towards skepticism.

Historical Examples
Steve Ballmer (former CEO of Microsoft) said this, “There’s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance.” Yeah okay bud, how did that turn out for you.

Or similarly, look at the public reaction to the current AI revolution. This is not to say that there is always a bad reaction as new technology is released, just that the public often sides towards skepticism vs optimism. Robotics is currently the center of one of these optimism vs. skepticism debates in regards to its long term potential. This is why I believe now is the best buying opportunity for robotics and robotics stocks. This is a situation where we have the chance to buy that metaphorical iPhone at its release (i.e robotics). Don’t be a Steve Balmer, look beyond the next few years!

Technology and Software
Richtech Robotics currently has seven operational robot models with a variety of functions.

Competitors/Current Market Landscape

Richtech Robotics is taking aim at the low skill job industry I spoke about earlier with their service industry robotics. Industry analysts point to a market with few pure-play automation names to lean on. Serve Robotics is one comparable, though it focuses more on autonomous delivery, while titans like ABB, Siemens, and Rockwell Automation dominate factory-floor automation Meanwhile, established robotics firms such as Intuitive Surgical shine in medical automation. At its core, Richtech’s competitive edge lies in its niche deployment in hospitality, health, and cleaning. I believe that these three industries could be some of the most affected by the upcoming robotic revolution. The company has already deployed over 300 robots across the U.S., blending proof-points with scale. RR is positioned to become the Apple, Google, Tesla of the robotics industry by 2030.

Future Potential

I fully believe to my core that Richtech stands on the brink of something big, even though the path might be a longer journey. The global retail automation market is projected to reach $25 billion by 2030, highlighting the magnitude of opportunity ahead. They recently signed two-year Master Services Agreement (with auto-renewal) with a major retailer signals a breakthrough in actual channel penetration and investor sentiment. For example, the stock soared 23% on that news alone. Add to that the Walmart ghost-kitchen deployments running Richtech robots in dozens of locations and the revenue potential becomes very tangible. These locations are each projected to pull in between $700,000 and $2 million annually. Pair this with Richtech’s 76% gross margin and strong solvency score (81/100), and you’ve got a company that isn’t just spending its cash left and right, it has a robust financial base to reinvest aggressively.

On the flip side, risks are real: analysts widely forecast price targets in the $2.50–$3.50 range, with an average near current levels. This implies modest to minimal short term upside. Freedom Broker recently downgraded RR to Sell, citing overvaluation and the need for more deliverables from its retailer partners before they’ll reconsider. 

This poses a good buying opportunity for us. Many may still be thinking like Steve Balmer regarding the iPhone. Public perception still thinks robotics may be a fad or may never be able to “capture the market share.” All that aside, robotics has been framed as ""the next era"" by Nvidia’s CEO himself. So, Richtech is very much in the spotlight. Not only that, but its use of Nvidia’s scalable AI platform is an edge no current robotics competitor can replicate.

TL;DR

If you just want to read a paragraph, here you go:


Richtech Robotics (RR), trading at ~$3 today, backed by Nvidia, has seven operating service industry robots. Robotics has infinite market opportunities in retail, hospitality, and healthcare. I believe this is undeniably reminiscent of early-stage Apple circa 2008. Current verdict: strong margin profile, robust cash and solvency, tangible large-scale deployments en route. I believe that proof of consistent revenue execution is the crucial next step towards a robotics revolution. If you’re in for being a long-term investor, I have unwavering faith that RR could be the next Apple-like stock within the next 10-15 years.

I wanted to let you guys know, even though I hadn’t announced it on here yet that I was planning to do a range day tomorrow, I have a lot of different things in life going on right now that is not making that feasible. I was going to announce this earlier in the week, but like I said, there’s a lot of serious stuff going on right now in my life (that is very bad, quite frankly) that it just wasn’t on my mind or a priority. I will go more into detail in the meeting for transparency reasons as transparency is one of my biggest values but in short, due to a mental health/red flag situation in Michigan, My gun rights are suspended for the next year as Michigan thinks I “am a high enough suicide risk” that I need a temporary separation from them, and I’m not working armed security anymore for that reason as I had to turn in my duty gun. I did feel the need to at least address this a little bit in case you guys see or hear anything online. That is one of many things that it’s going on in my life right now that it made me cancel the range day. 

I can still be around guns, technically, but I cannot be in possession of them or use them; again, this was because a mental health/red flag order, which expires in a year. I just didn’t want you guys getting the wrong type of picture here thinking that I’m out here doing bad shit lol.


What I will say, however is that our normal meeting schedule is still going to be the same. Our next meeting is going to be next Friday at 7:30PM like the usual meeting times at The Well Coffee House in South Bend. 

I hope to see the more newer faces there, some of the old ones, and hopefully some brand new ones. I absolutely love you guys and I love what we’ve created here, I don’t know each individual member super super well, but from what I have seen from you guys, you have shown me that you are very good people with good hearts and I appreciate your guys’ presence and engagement and what we have created here.

If you guys have any questions, DM me or comment on this post.

So I've started reading romcoms recently and while it isn't much, one trope I've noticed is that instead of the modern ""online dating"" where you select potential partners by their provided parameters on the dating website, chat online and go on real-life dates in hopes that you will click with each other; or the current ""offline dating"" where you also purposefully select a potential partner at an event or activity (such as at a party, at a bar or even at a hobby convention) and court them in hopes that both of you will click; relationships in romcoms are often depicted as of follows:

Originally the main characters have a platonic relationship with each other: they can be classmates, coworkers, or hell, even patrons at the same bookstore or the same coffee shop (TBH I also don't know why romcoms love the bookstore or coffee shop setting so much lol). But as time goes on, through the many events that both of them partake in, they gradually start to develop romantic feelings for each other.

Their relationship often gets tested and they have their ups and downs throughout the narration, yet the many challenges they face throughout the narration only serves as kindling for the mutual feeling they have for each other, until the end where during a romantic setting (such as on a scenic spot on a hill under a full moon overlooking the city or beside the shimmering river under a full moon during a festival; note how there is always a full moon thrown in there), they confess their mutual feelings for each other and go for an often awkward but passionate kiss.

1n2vm8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstateExam/comments/1n2vm8m/if_youre_struggling_with_the_ny_real_estate_exam/,"If You’re Struggling With the NY Real Estate Exam, Read This (I Just Passed!)","This journey started back in January when I got laid off. I was struggling hard—submitting job applications, barely getting interviews, collecting rejection emails left and right. I didn’t have a professional network and honestly had no clue how I’d find work again.

Since I was on unemployment, the state sent me invites to job fairs. I decided to attend one at a local university gymnasium. Being an extrovert, I went table to table, asking about opportunities. That’s when I found myself at the Keller Williams table. I spoke with two reps about what it’s like to be a real estate agent. When they mentioned they’d cover the cost of my real estate course, that was the spark.

They sent me an email with a discount code (100% off) for the **77-hour Kaplan Real Estate Course**. At first, it was brutal. Growing up, I hated school. Reading never came naturally to me, and Kaplan’s format—paragraphs on paragraphs on a screen—was overwhelming.

***But here’s how I got through it:***

* Kaplan has 26 units. I read each sentence slowly until I understood it.
* I wrote notes in my own words (not just copying the screen).
* I created a blank Google Doc and typed out every end-of-unit quiz Q&A.
* Then, I’d paste them into ChatGPT and have the AI quiz me until I could get them all right. 

Each unit took me 5–6 hours. I camped out at Starbucks so often that people gossiped about how long I stayed. The baristas got to know me, cheered me on, and even slipped me free coffee sometimes. That little community kept me going.

By late July, I finished all 26 units with 116 logged hours (77 required). Then came the **Kaplan proctored final exam.**

The first time, I failed with a 55%. I felt crushed. But I refused to quit.

Digging deeper, I realized I had been practicing with the wrong test. **Kaplan’s “Pretest v1.0” barely matched the actual exam. What I needed was the “Post Test v10.”** Once I switched, I drilled it over and over—100 questions at a time—until I could ace it **ten times in a row.**

On my second try, I went in with only two words in my head: **Revenge and Passing**. I flew through it in under 10 minutes (the first attempt took me 25). This time, **I scored a 97%.**

With the certificate in hand, I **scheduled my NY State Exam for two weeks later in Pomona, NY.**

**The exam: 75 questions, only 2 math.** At first, I was breezing through—I’d read half the question and already know the answer. But by the 40s, things got tricky. **The wording was intentionally confusing.**

Some people finished quickly and handed in their tests. I stayed focused on my own pace. **My strategy: if I wasn’t sure, I marked it on the scrap paper and moved on. After finishing the whole exam, I circled back to those flagged questions.**

**Out of \~20 people in the room, I was one of the last 5 still working.** And that was fine—I didn’t want to rush just to match others.

The waiting period was torture—three days of checking the state site, biting my nails, full of anxiety. And then finally: I saw PASS.

***What Helped Me Most:***

* Take your time with the 26 units. Don’t rush—it’s about understanding, not speed.
* Write notes in your own words. That forces real comprehension.
* Use practice tests strategically. Make sure you’re using the right ones.
* Breaks are necessary. Burnout kills progress.
* Ignore how fast or slow others test. Focus on your own paper.

***Final Thoughts***

You’re stronger than you think and smarter than you realize. If you fail, it doesn’t mean you won’t be a great agent. Some of the most determined people I’ve met are the ones who failed first—but came back stronger.

That “revenge mindset” I had after failing pushed me to dig deeper and prove myself. **So if you’re on this path: persist. The only way you lose is if you give up.**

On the day Sophie found out she was pregnant, she heard the cruelest sentences from her fiancé— ""The baby might be a Morgan,"" Liam Morgan sneered, pulling another woman into his arms, ""but it sure as hell isn't mine.""  ""A fool like you? You're nothing but a pawn to secure my inheritance."" Devastated, Sophie ran, only to be pinned against the wall by Marcus Morgan, Liam's uncle, who also was the ruthless head of the Morgan family. ""You're carrying my child, and you think you can just walk away?"" With that, Marcus tore up her old engagement contract, crushed his conniving nephew, then turned to Sophie and whispered darkly, ""From now on, you're the one and forever Mrs. Morgan."" However, with one hand on her baby bump, Sophie just smirked. ""Mr. Morgan, are you sure the baby is yours?""  He grabbed her jaw, breath hot and dangerous. ""Then let's have another little one.""

———

Chapter 1

 ""Place your bets, Sophie's having a boy, no doubt about it.""

 Her hand froze midair on the door handle.

 It was clearly her boyfriend's voice.

 She'd come here to tell him the good news, of course. But how has Liam already knew she was pregnant?

 Then a roar of laughter exploded inside the private room.

 ""Liam, man, you really hit the jackpot this time! The Chandler princess is so into you, she's even carrying your baby! That means all the Chandler family's resources are basically yours, right?""

 Sophie peered through the narrow crack in the door.

 Liam sat with one leg crossed over the other, swirling a glass of wine, that smug face, one she'd loved for three years, looking impossibly pleased with himself.

 ""Please. The kid's not even mine.""

 A slow, mocking smile crept across his lips. ""I never touched her.""

 Sophie's mind went blank. Her whole body turned cold.

 ""What?! Then who's the father?!"" Jake's voice cracked with shock.

 ""How would I know?"" Liam spun his Macallan lazily, voice light as air. ""She probably just found some random guy at the Hamptons. She's dumb enough to believe whatever you tell her. As long as she thinks it's mine, it's all good. Even if Mr. Chandler hates my guts, now he has no choice but to hand her over.""

 ""Once we're married, my place in the Morgan family is set.""

 She clenched the doorknob so hard her knuckles turned bone white.

 ""Damn, Liam, that's one hell of a hustle,"" said the Goldman Sachs guy, smirking. ""Aren't you worried she'll figure it out someday?""

 ""Worried?"" Liam let out a laugh. ""She's a total pushover. I could tell her our Met Gala meeting was fate and she'd believe it. And even if she does catch on, so what? We'll be married by then. What can she even do?""

 Another wave of laughter followed, glasses clinking in celebration like they'd already won some big game.

 Outside the door, Sophie felt the whole world tilt.

 She'd only gotten the positive test from her Upper East Side gynecologist a week ago. Her plan had been to surprise him on his birthday with the news.

 She'd imagined the moment a hundred times, how thrilled he'd be, how he'd pull her into his arms with tears in his eyes, promising her forever.

 But what she got instead was an even bigger surprise.

 The baby wasn't his.

 Then whose child was she carrying?

 Chapter 2

 ""That dumb bitch Sophie? All money, no brains. I've had enough of her.""

 Sophie stopped breathing.

 ""Once I drain the Chandler family's cash after we're married, the first thing I'll do is kick her to the curb.""

 The words hit her like ice water. Three years, and this was what he really thought of her.

 Laughter erupted from the room. ""Damn, Liam, you're cold! But smart. Why work when you can marry into money?""

 ""She makes it so easy,"" Liam's voice carried through the door, dripping with contempt. ""Desperate little princess, fighting mommy and daddy for me. I just have to smile and she hands over everything.""

 Sophie's knees nearly gave out. The hallway felt suffocating, the expensive cologne and smoke choking her.

 She couldn't listen anymore.

 Sophie walked to her car in a daze. Three years of fighting her parents for him. Three years of believing he loved her. She'd starved herself when they disapproved. Cried herself to sleep. Nearly destroyed her relationship with her family.

 All for a man who called her a desperate little princess.

 All lies.

 She sat in the driver's seat, hand on her stomach. The baby wasn't even his. Then whose was it? That night two months ago was still a blur of alcohol and fragmented memories.

 Her phone buzzed.

 A text from Liam.

 [Hey babe, where are you? Thought you were coming over?]

 She stared at the screen, her heart going colder by the second. Even now, he was performing. The caring boyfriend act, when minutes ago he'd been calling her a desperate little princess.

 The drive home passed in a blur. By the time she pulled into the driveway, darkness had fallen over the villa.

 The house felt empty, silent. Sophie curled up on the couch, replaying every moment of their relationship. Had there ever been anything real? Any genuine feeling from his side?

 Her parents had been right all along. Liam was from a side branch of the Morgans—ambitious but powerless. And she'd been his ticket to the top.

 Footsteps approached the front door.

 Liam walked in, wearing his signature gentle smile.

 ""There you are, sweetheart. Where did you disappear to?"" He placed a takeout bag on the coffee table. ""Got your favorite from that place you love. Parking was a nightmare.""

 What an act.

 She stared at him, numb.

 ""Hey, you alright? You look rough."" He reached for her forehead, worry creasing his brow. ""Are you running a fever? You shouldn't be driving around if you're not feeling well.""

 She turned her head away. ""I'm fine.""

 ""You sure? You seem off."" His concern sounded so genuine. How had she never seen through this act? ""Maybe you should rest. I can stay the night, take care of you.""

 ""You said you had a surprise for me. What is it?"" Liam's eyes lit up with anticipation, leaning forward slightly.

 Sophie met his gaze.

 She could see the calculation in his eyes. He was waiting for pregnancy news that would seal his future.

 ""My family just landed a major business deal. Big numbers.""

 The light in his eyes died instantly. His smile faltered for just a moment before snapping back into place. ""That's... that's great news, baby.""

 She watched him try to hide his disappointment. He'd been expecting something else. Something about the baby he somehow already knew about.

 ""Isn't that worth celebrating?"" she said quietly.

 ""Of course! Hell yeah!"" He scrambled to recover, gesturing at the takeout. ""This calls for champagne. Well, maybe sparkling cider for you since you..."" He caught himself. ""Since you look a bit under the weather.""

 Nice save. But she'd caught it.

 ""I just thought maybe you were going to say your family had finally agreed to the wedding.""

 Sophie watched him fake his way through it. Three years of falling for his bullshit. Three years of being his ""desperate little princess.""

 But that Sophie was gone.

 She smiled—a real smile this time, though not for the reasons he'd think.

 ""Don't worry,"" she said softly. ""I have plenty more surprises coming.""

 Chapter 3

 Late at night, alone in bed, Sophie couldn't close her eyes without seeing that hazy figure again.

 The baby wasn't Liam's.

 Then who was that man that night?

 She had to find out, fast.

 The next morning, she headed straight for the hotel.

 ""I'm so sorry, Ms. Chandler,"" the hotel manager said, full of regret. ""There was a system failure that day. All the surveillance footage was lost.""

 ""Really? Of all days, it had to be that one?""

 The manager's eyes darted away, his voice lacking confidence. ""It was truly an accident. We're deeply sorry…""

 Sophie let out a cold laugh and turned to leave.

 The hotel belonged to the Morgans. If Liam wanted something erased, all he had to do was lift a finger.

 Still, no matter what, she was going to find out who the father was.

 She clenched her fists, eyes filled with a stubborn, burning resolve.

 3 p.m., at the convention center.

 She sat beside her father, her thoughts stuck on the hotel footage. She couldn't focus on the auction at all.

 ""Sophie, that's Marcus Morgan.""

 Her father leaned in to whisper in her ear.

 She blinked, snapping back to the moment. Her gaze drifted toward the entrance, where a man was walking in, surrounded by a crowd.

 Sharp, chiseled features. An air of power and distance clung to him with every move he made.

 Marcus.

 Liam's uncle.

 The real head of the Morgan family.

 The man holding the lifeline of Riverland's entire economy.

 She'd heard rumors, Marcus was ruthless and decisive. Every time Liam caught wind of him nearby, he'd grab her hand and take a detour.

 ""If we can strike a deal with the Morgans,"" her father murmured with awe, ""our family will be untouchable in Riverland.""

 Sophie gave a distracted nod and looked away again.

we have a complicated story. she came back into my life this year because she missed me and wanted to reconcile. she was much more grown from when we previously dated (i did lots of therapy work too), so reconciliation seemed like a good idea. plus, i never really stopped loving her. 



but the thing is, she left my life during a really, really vulnerable time. this was early last year. im 28. my parents got in a car crash, my mom didn't make it, dad spent months in a hospital, I cancelled my cross country move to stay home and take care of things. it was maybe the most intense grief/panic/shock/trauma I've ever felt. i remember constant panic attacks and breakdowns and it was just an AWFUL time. 



my ex and i had problems. we argued a lot, and i was a slightly reactive person back then. i wasn't rude, i was just very direct and blunt in how i spoke (she was a very soft spoken person and she needed that from me, which i understand). we argued a lot and eventually she left me about 3 months after the accident. it was really hard on me to have both of those losses back to back, and i spent a majority of last year and this year basically hating myself for ruining us. I remember spending WEEKS trying to get her to come back, i cried endlessly to her, left her long voicemails, left so many texts like apologizing nonstop. I thought i was some monster and i thought i deserved these losses and i was trying to just save things i guess. 



well some times passed and i was able to reflect on the relationship. and yes, we argued, and yes, i was reactive. but i was looking at certain situations after my mom passed away. 



\-one time, we had a string of days where she cried to me daily. this was maybe 2-3 weeks after the accident. I remember telling her ""would you be able to keep things together? most of my day is spent comforting my crying sisters and my (barely alive) father, it's hard to hear more crying"". after a few days of this, she told me ""am i just not worth the effort to you?"" and i remember i snapped that day. and i absolutely acknowledge that my reaction could have been better, but I remember how me and my life situation felt so small at that time. and her crying was only because she missed me (obviously if something major happened, i would absolutely comfort her, but if it wasn't major, i needed to give my energy to my family). 



\-i wont list more examples but there were many more instances where she said and did inconsiderate things to me, but it was hidden behind a soft tone, but after a while, i would react. and my ""reaction"" is just a very blunt/direct version of me, i never like degraded her or anything. i remember she wanted to come see me one time, and i told her if we could please wait, because my life is so unstable and i kindof want to face everything head on and build my routine again. new job, frequent trips to the hospital to see dad, taking care of the house - my life was just so hectic and i wanted to build a version of myself that could satisfy all these needs. and so i told my ex that we should wait a little if that's okay (we were long distance). her coming would only add to my plate at that time, things were just not okay at all in the family. and she told me eventually ""i figured you must not love me if i couldn't come see you"" (we had seen eachother 2 times in 2 months already, this is way more than what we normally do. infact we were texting more, calling more, seeing eachother more, i was pouring SO MUCH love onto her daily...it just shocked me that she said that). other examples like this....



so yeah, i was reactive sometimes. i was firm, that's all. but after reflecting, i was like 'wait, yes i could have been better but she was SO inconsiderate randomly. i didn't ruin everything. i needed peace and understanding in that time. it doesn't mean im perfect but im at fault maybe 20% of the time and she was the other 80%. i didn't deserve this breakup, i didn't deserve to grieve 2 losses at once, i dont deserve any of this hardship.



but by this point, it was a year of no contact. a year of me collapsing, on medication, panic attacks, crying myself to sleep so many nights, fighting trauma from the accident, and my ex wasn't there. but i can never hate her. im not perfect, maybe she didn't know any better. 



so this year around may she came back into my life. she wanted to try again. and i was hesitant but i agreed. to me, i worked on my problems, and she apologized and owned up to her lack of maturity and understanding from the past. she seemed sweeter, kinder, and im literally in contact with the person i wanted to marry. i couldn't say no. 



but internally i felt i was at war. on one hand, i love this girl SO much. her smile, laugh, dumb stories - i smile even just thinking about her. but on the other hand, i remember how i went most of 2024 without her. i remember those 3am nights where im crying so hard and i want to call her for some love and i can't. i remember going through my bday, and every holiday, and things are just so unbearably sad here without mom, and all i wanted was my ex, and she wasn't there. i cried so so so much last year. daily basically. and so, that pain just hits me like a truck when she enters my life again. we both say our sorries, we both try to softly enter eachother's life again, but my pain never could go away. i guess on the inside i wanted to SCREAM at her for leaving. our love was too pure for this. our love was too pure for me to be grieving my mom while she was in another relationship. i felt so small and replaceable and discarded and i just felt like this whole thing was extremely unfair to me. we HAD this shit, we were THE couple, we could have achieved so much together, but we didn't...... 



and that pain just stays with me constantly. and 99.9% of the time, it showed only as sadness. I tried to hide it but ever since she came back into my life, i cried daily again. just constant breakdowns from this beautiful relationship - to a confusing breakup - to now almost being strangers again. to me, it was avoidable, every last bit of it. but i still love her so freaking much. i still want her to be my forever. im hurt but i cant stop loving her. and the battle between the love and the pain made me feel so off. i remember so many days where i would just breakdown to her for no reason. or she facetimes me and my eyes are red (from a breakdown earlier). i felt like i was carrying a thousand pounds on my chest everywhere i went and it wrecked me. so i ended up showing my anxiety and emotions outwardly and i could see her getting uncomfortable at times. i guess in her mind, we spent all this time apart, she's completely detached from me, and she comes back in my life and see's im a wreck. and i guess she wanted reconciliation to look different. i think she wanted us to get to know eachother again and start from scratch. 



and again, i loved her too much to not try. i wanted this too. but every few days my emotions would just be so bad. again i hid it the best i could but she could tell. and there were 2 times where my emotions showed as blunt moments. it wasn't intentional, it just happened. my therapist told me that sometimes depression can show as anger, and i guess it did (not trying to evade responsibility here, but this behavior is NOT like me at all). one time i told her ""my friends were actually here for me when you weren't"" and another time i told her ""my family seriously doubt your growth. just a year ago you were pulling all these stunts on me while i was going through such a hard time, they think you may not have changed."" (and its true, my family had concerns about her, but it's not like me AT ALL to talk like that). i think my nervous system just crashed really hard and instead of the constant sad emotions, it showed as bluntness 2 times. 



and that was the final straw i guess. my ex told me that she thinks ive changed a lot, personality wise. she said our emotions will never mesh, because of how fragile and emotional I've been, she said we will never align. she told me to find someone who is emotional like me. and she also told me that my bluntness is an indication of us speaking differently, and we need to date people who speak more like us. and i was really sad during this time so i didn't want to give bullshit reasons or act like i had an excuse, so i just kept saying sorry. i apologized wholeheartedly - both when my ""bad"" incident occurred, and during the end when she wanted to leave. i just said ""im sorry, i misspoke, i should have realized that this might be hurtful...etc"". i JUST apologized but she is so sure of no future with me that she left and she shut the door really hard. she was really cold too so i didn't get to explain anything. 



and now im 50 days no contact from all of that. and i guess i dont know what to do. my brain tells me that she apologized, she owned up to the past, and she wanted a clean slate. and 50% of the time, i DID give that clean slate and we had really nice soft loving convos. but i was guilty of the other 50% where i was just emotional. i was still my sweet self, i was still trying to show up, but most days i would literally have the worst breakdown and then i try to talk to her and words cant even come out of my mouth. im sad and still processing trauma and im like stuttering almost and trying to act normal and loveable. i never got to tell her why i was in so much pain on the inside. and i really want to. i know my pain and hurt was valid, but i guess i wanna reach out and tell her everything i was fighting on my own and how much hurt i was carrying and how it affected how i showed up. i want to tell her that the version of me she saw isn't the one to judge for compatibility. i want to tell her that i freaking love her and i want this and there's so much more to me. i want to fight for myself and for us. 



shes moving close to me soon and it makes me remember how things were before mom died. morning bagel dates, coffee runs, watching dumb cartoons together while eating takeout. those bummy days when she wasn't dressed up nicely and had no make up on is the version of her that i fell in love with. i want it all with her but she was just so cold when she left that i haven't had the courage to reach back out. i miss her terribly, I've been a mess again for these last 50 days, but im scared that if she's cold again, it could hurt my mental health even more. i just feel like if i was able to be a better and more composed version of myself, our reconciliation would have gone better. and maybe we could have built something stable and healthy this time. and it feels like im being forced to detach from my person, again, and this time it feels just so unfair. i just wanna fight for us.

1n2vebs,https://www.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/comments/1n2vebs/its_tough_for_me_to_understand_how_the_elderly/,It's tough for me to understand how the elderly don't understand anti-natalism,"In my work organization (a university), there are plenty of old people.

What I've noticed is that when the older people in my organization find out I don't have kids (i.e. those who are 70 years old or older), they don't really say much.  Maybe some of that is from pity, I can't be certain.

But I do know that some of those elderly employees, they do talk about death and medical issues (which obviously correlate with suffering).  Oftentimes, they couch it in the form of jokes or sense of humor. (""Oh, my knees don't work the way that they used to, maybe I should get my TA teaching assistant to fetch my coffee for me too, hahahaha!"" or something like that.)  And those guys, when they hear I'm nearing 50 and don't have a kid and they invariably get the sense that I'm possibly AN, they seem to nod a tiny bit.

**And it got me thinking: Wouldn't the elderly and those who suffer from bad health intuitively understand AN mindsets?  I find it hard to believe that they never think of the benefits of AN.**

As in, if I were elderly and suffering from a variety of health problems, I'm not sure I can 'flip' my mindset and then suddenly talk about the joys of being a grandfather and holding a baby, when I am bright enough to realize that s/he will someday suffer the way that I'm suffering.  In other words, the ailing grandfathers out there who can be so proud to hold a grandchild seem to me to be a bit delusional.  Or a special kind of ignorant.

Does my specific perspective resonate with anybody here?",13,1756433988.0,antinatalism,6,1.0,False
