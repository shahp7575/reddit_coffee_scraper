Worked there for almost four years. Nature of my work required me to sometimes stay till very late because of international markets.
Anyways I had a friend there. We were good buddies, lots of talk, hang out, he would come to my place often. Knew my wife well. 
One night it was slow and we were sitting on kitten table talking n having snacks/coffee. I noticed he was looking at me bit differently that night. He put his hand on my crotch. I looked at him shocked. He was looking at me too. He started rubbing it gently. Then he got up, unzipped my pants and pulled my dick out. I was hard even though I wasn‚Äôt sure what‚Äôs going on. He got down n started sucking me. Still looking into my eyes. My hands moved on the back of his head. He kept on going till I came in his mouth. He swallowed it all and licked it clean after. 
Then without saying a word, he put it back, zipped up and left the kitchen.
He worked there for 6 months after that incident but we never talked about it. He stopped coming to my place too. My wife asked if something happened between us n I said no. 
To this day I don‚Äôt know what triggered that and most importantly why I never stopped him. I do think about him sometimes but haven‚Äôt spoken to him in over a year now. 
Anyways I thought I would share n see what others think.",1,1743977251.0,bisexual,0,1.0,False

They'd talk about future date plans and initiate physical contact. May it be a hug or a kiss. 1 time I initiated it the other 2 they did.

Then they ghost me the next day or tell me they are interested but pull away. I don't like to chase when I feel like it isn't reciprocal or if I'm getting mixed signals because I never want to make someone feel uncomfortable.

I'm just wondering if there are cues I am missing. When it comes to westernized gaysians or gaysians who immigrated from other countries, i can usually vibe at how the date is going.

1jt5n3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1jt5n3u/i_think_my_friendship_with_another_girl_is_making/,I think my friendship with another girl is making my LO jealous and will ruin all chances of contact with her,"My(31M) LO (27F) is my coworker. We have had lots of lunches (in the breakroom) together both with others and alone. We have also gone out drinking with coworkers many times and always end up next to each other and talking the most to each other. We often see each other and give warm smiles. Despite this she has stated she will never date or even mess around with a coworker. I'm almost at the point of accepting that it will never happen and that she will end up with someone else, and I should just be happy for her as long as she is happy.

Then 6 months ago a new coworker (24F) started. We work much more closely and are put on the same ""X team"" as each other. She has a long term boyfriend that they plan to get married. I met her boyfriend at a work event and we all got along and had a great night drinking and having fun, and he is a cool guy. I do not have feelings for this new girl at all, but over time we have become good friends and vent work problems to each other and due to seeing each other a lot more have a lot more conversations. It's very much friendly, but we do go off site for coffee or lunch on occasion when we want to say stuff that nobody else can hear. On top of that, she bakes, and leaves baked goods on my desk once a week or every other week. My LO has her desk right by mine, so she definitely sees that if she pays any attention. Also it seems completely coincidence that whenever we get back from coffee or lunch and enter through the break room, my LO is there to see us come back together. 

Now she hasn't said anything, but I feel a different vibe lately from her, especially after she notices us hanging out or the baked goods. On top of that, the new friend mentions that, ""I don't think (LO) likes me, she seems annoyed at me when I tell her she needs to do something "" (it's my friends job to regulate certain things and she is just doing her job). I do not think that my friend realizes my feelings for my LO, as this is something I cannot admit to anyone. 

Basically I am torn between friendship and my LO. If my LO actually is treating my friend differently, then it ""gives me the ick"" as women usually say.

1jt5mcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1jt5mcd/what_would_you_do_in_this_situation_with_a_best/,What would you do in this situation with a best friend?,"TL;DR: My male obsessed best friend was flirting with my friend‚Äôs boyfriend and it‚Äôs changed my view on her.

I‚Äôve been best friends with my BFF for 10 years. She and I have been inseparable and we‚Äôve always gotten along very well. We have the same sense of humor, general values & outlook on life, and as a friend, she is very loyal and always roots for me in life. She doesn‚Äôt get defensive.

Something I‚Äôve always known about her (and have been told about many times from other people who either know her or are in the same friend circles) is that she has a tendency to obsess over men. The first time I met her even centered around a man. We met working at a coffee shop as seniors in high school, and she had gotten fired because she was messing around with the male owner (the owners were a married couple) - aka the owner cheated on his wife by flirting & taking her out on a date. She was close to the female owner as well, but that didn‚Äôt stop her from fooling around with her husband. She came clean to the wife & she fired her. Throughout college, she told me she hooked up with a guy while his gf was downstairs. But despite all this, I never really held these against her or looked at her differently. She did these pretty awful things surrounding men, but she was my best friend and in the ten years we‚Äôd been friends, I never felt like she put a man first above me or when it really concerned me. I‚Äôve always overlooked it. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, I invited a lot of my friends among different friend circles to a music event. My best friend came as well. I invited two good friends from my past job, and they brought their boyfriends. One of their boyfriends is my best friend‚Äôs type physically. I had even shown her a picture of the guy on her Instagram before last year, and she jokingly said ‚Äúcan they break up?‚Äù. We meet up at the event and when my friends and their bf come, I bring my best friend to say hi and introduce them. I first spot the friend‚Äôs boyfriend who my best friend thought was cute online, and I greet him & give him a hug. Then I greet the others. My best friend is there with me the whole time. After we say hello & go back to the venue, she‚Äôs asking me ‚Äúis he single?‚Äù I say no, that‚Äôs my friend‚Äôs boyfriend. She says ‚Äúoh then why is he making eye contact with me then‚Äù and I just ignore her, not indulging in this because he‚Äôs taken and he‚Äôs just off limits.

Throughout the event, I notice that they‚Äôre flirting with each other. He‚Äôs flirting with her, which pisses me off, because wtf you‚Äôre taken. And she‚Äôs flirting with him! The flirting is akin to intense eye contact, banter, laughing, and overall, I just know my best friend. I know what she‚Äôs like when she‚Äôs flirting, and also she‚Äôs expressed MULTIPLE times that she thinks this guy is attractive.

The last straw for me was I see them talking to each other & flirting from a distance, but then my other friend who came along with this friend gives them a look and calls his girlfriend to see where she‚Äôs at. We go to find her and she‚Äôs saying she was trying to find her boyfriend ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è so I‚Äôm mad at this point and I don‚Äôt talk to my best friend for the rest of the night as I‚Äôm flitting with the rest of my friends to get some distance. 

When we‚Äôre going home since we carpooled in the same car, I tell her that I was upset and not talking to her because I felt that she was flirting with my friend‚Äôs bf. I pointed out that he‚Äôs definitely more in the wrong, but that I was very disappointed and upset and embarrassed that she would do that - I‚Äôm introducing you to MY friends for the first time, and in exchange, you flirt with their boyfriend unbeknownst to my friend (the girlfriend). It‚Äôs just disrespectful and distasteful. We talk about it for several days to iron things out and smooth things over, and basically she apologizes she embarrassed me but states she wasn‚Äôt flirting with him. I told her I believe her, but really it‚Äôs because I wanted to. I don‚Äôt actually believe her unfortunately. She tells me that she didn‚Äôt know he was with the group when she saw him the first time that night, asking if he was single, but later I realized she was with me and she had to have seen me greet him. So it just makes me thinks she‚Äôs lying. Later I find out another friend at the event felt that she was flirting with that guy as well, so I don‚Äôt think I was imagining it. She tells me that she doesn‚Äôt want to be this annoying girl who gets perceived this way and wants to ease up on trying to find / date men at parties etc, which I appreciated her saying & to me, I can believe it‚Äôs a wake up call.

Now, she‚Äôs dating a new guy and it seems like it‚Äôs going well. I mean, if this guy ends up being the one for her, she‚Äôll be off the market and that‚Äôll be it. But I can‚Äôt shake how I felt about this situation. It just really rubbed me the wrong way and has changed the way I see her. It‚Äôs just incredibly disrespectful and she‚Äôll say things like she loves women, but you don‚Äôt do something like that if you do. It‚Äôs not very surprising in hindsight that this situation would occur given the background & track history, but again, it was never something I paid that much mind to. It makes me rethink being best friends with her. I still love her as a friend & care for her, but genuinely, I don‚Äôt know if I want to be her best friend.

# Best iPad 10th Gen Keyboard Case: 2025 Ultimate Guide

The iPad 10th generation is a versatile device, perfect for both productivity and entertainment. However, its potential is truly unlocked when paired with a high-quality keyboard case. A keyboard increases typing speed and accuracy, turning the iPad into a viable laptop replacement. With so many options available, selecting the right case can be overwhelming. This guide will explore the best iPad 10th generation keyboard cases available in 2025, offering detailed insights to help you make an informed decision.

## Key Features Analysis

The best iPad 10th generation keyboard cases offer a blend of protection, functionality, and style. Understanding the key features is essential for finding the perfect match for your needs.

**Keyboard Type and Layout**

The keyboard is the centerpiece of these cases.Premium options feature mechanical keys, providing tactile feedback and enhanced typing accuracy. Others use chiclet-style keys which are more common and generally quieter.Look for a layout that matches your typing habits, and consider models with dedicated function keys for speedy access to common iPad functions like volume control or screen brightness adjustment.

Most Keyboard case for ipad 10th generation offers a standard QWERTY layout, ensuring a familiar typing experience. Some models also include adjustable backlighting, enabling pleasant typing in low-light environments. The key travel distance, typically between 1mm and 1.5mm, impacts typing comfort and accuracy. Larger key spacing and a logically arranged layout can substantially improve typing speed and reduces errors, especially for users with larger hands.

**Case Material and Protection**

The case material impacts both the protection offered and the overall aesthetics. Polycarbonate or TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) are common choices for impact resistance, protecting the iPad from drops and scratches. Some cases incorporate a reinforced frame for added durability. Look for cases with a good mix of style and protection.

The physical protection offered by a case is also vital. Robust cases use a combination of materials, such as rigid polycarbonate for the outer shell and shock-absorbing TPU for the inner lining. Raised edges around the screen and camera lens prevent scratches when the iPad is placed on flat surfaces. Some premium cases can even offer certified drop protection meeting military standards, providing users with enhanced peace of mind.

**Connectivity and Power**

Most keyboard cases connect to the iPad via Bluetooth, offering wireless convenience. Some high-end options utilize the Smart Connector, which provides a direct power and data connection, eliminating the need for Bluetooth pairing and charging the keyboard separately. Battery life is a crucial consideration for Bluetooth keyboards, with some models offering weeks or even months of use on a single charge.

Bluetooth connectivity allows for wireless use but may require occasional pairing and battery charging. Cases using the Smart Connector draw power directly from the iPad, providing a seamless and efficient connection. Check for Bluetooth version compatibility to ensure stable and fast data transmission. Furthermore, keyboard cases using bluetooth 5.0 or later offer improved range, stability, and energy efficiency compared to older generations.

**Adjustability and Ergonomics**

The ability to adjust the viewing angle of the iPad is crucial for comfortable use in various settings. Look for cases with multiple viewing angles or a kickstand that allows for near infinite adjustability. Ergonomic design, such as a curved keyboard or wrist rest, can also improve typing comfort, especially during extended use.

Adequate adjustability allows users to configure the iPad‚Äôs display at the most optimal angle, reducing glare and strain on the neck and eyes. Some keyboard cases feature a 360-degree rotating design, enabling the iPad to be used in both portrait and landscape modes.A well-designed hinge mechanism ensures stability and prevents the iPad from wobbling during typing. Additionally, keyboard cases with an ergonomic design can promote better posture and reduce the risk of repetitive strain injuries.

Key features of the best iPad 10th Gen Keyboard Cases include:

*   Durable Construction
*   Bluetooth or Smart Connector
*   Adjustable Viewing Angles
*   Responsive Keyboard
*   Long battery Life

## Core Benefits

Investing in a quality iPad 10th generation keyboard case provides several tangible benefits, enhancing both productivity and convenience.

**Enhanced Productivity:** A physical keyboard significantly improves typing speed and accuracy compared to the on-screen keyboard. This allows users to draft emails, write documents, and take notes more efficiently. Users report an increase in typing speed by up to 50% when using a physical keyboard compared to the virtual one, translating to significant time savings in task completion.

**Improved Comfort:** A properly designed keyboard case offers a more comfortable typing experience, especially during long typing sessions. The tactile feedback of the keys and the ability to adjust the viewing angle reduce strain on hands, wrists, and neck. This means users can work for extended periods without discomfort or fatigue.

**Increased Portability:** A keyboard case acts as both a keyboard and a protective cover, consolidating two essential accessories into one package.

I've had a crush on this guy for about a year. I met him about three-ish years ago at the start of our college program. And I found him attractive as soon as I saw him. It doesn't help that he's very talented and funny. He's my type, and every time I've talked to him, the conversation just flows, and it's easy to carry on a conversation. I see him almost every week day and we live in the same neighborhood. I couldn't avoid my crush about 7 months ago when we saw each other every day at the bus stop. It is ruining my life lol. I've tried to push myself to just ask him out for coffee, but every single time the opportunity comes up, I can't do it. I cannot tell if he is even interested. He remembers small details of my life, like that my parents live in another country, which I don't really mention often. He always seems happy to see me? Idk if he's just being nice. Recently, he complimented my outfit, which he could have just been being nice. Sometimes the eye contact is a little lingering, but idk bro. It could mean anything? I may be delusional. There are a few things that are holding me back:

We are in the same cohort of about 60 people. Many of the people in my cohort, whom I have asked about their opinions on dating within the class, have been skeptical about it. They point to the issue of whether a couple breaks up, which would be awkward at best. And two people in our class have had a ""will they won't they"" situation which ended with neither of them talking to each other. And that is literally the last thing I want to happen.

Also, I am not sure if he is single. I also don't know if he is willing to date someone who is nonbinary. My friend who is in the same cohort, B, says that she thinks he's single. But I would really like to be sure before I make a move, y'know? 

Also, what if he says no? I have been rejected a few times in the past and while I won't be utterly crushed by it... I will be sad. And I will be a little embarrassed seeing him in class if he rejects me and I don't want to make school uncomfortable for me. 

I guess I'm asking, how do I go about this? I don't think I can just ignore it. What is the best way to go about this? Do I just ask him out and hope for the best? Should I find out if he's single first? Or do I just go for it? Am I being delusional? ",1,1743976529.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1jt5kzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1jt5kzc/i_am_exhausted_this_is_a_cry_for_help/,"I am exhausted, this is a cry for help","Hello people on the internet. I (17M) am from Eastern Europe and I have been forced to leave my parents' house in October. Over the last few weeks my life has been going downhill. I lost my job two weeks ago due to my schedule overlapping with school. I also missed a lot of school due to my mental and physical health and also due to the fact that i had to move places multiple times. Now I have too many absences and they are threatening to expel me or to make me repeat the year, and being in a top school in my city, they will expel me to protect their reputation. I am not a bad student, I don't really have top grades either, but I am not failing any classes and I am pretty involved in school related activities.

I am a musician. I played competitive piano for 12 years now, it is my life. I have a band and we are supposed to play at 3 festivals this summer. I am the main instrumentist and composer for my friend's masters project (a musical) I am doing pretty cool things, if you think about it.

But the stress of it all is killing me. So many people depend on me, so many things that i have to do on the daily but I can't get out of bed most days. I don't have access to any medical care because I am still a minor, and no doctor is going to consul a minor without a parent's consent. Therefore, I can't get a doctor's note to excuse my absences for school and I can't get my health in check. I used to go to a psychiatrist which helped me to some extent until my mother pulled me out of it.

My parents were abusive to me in my childhood. Physical, emotional, verbal, you name it. I had bruises constantly as a child, and my first suicide attempt was when I was 9 years old. At 13 I was hospital for the same reason. After that, they toned it down a bit but for the few months prior to my leave, they started to do it again, mainly due to our disagreements on political stuff. They are leaning into the far right pipeline and I am a gay man, so i feel like I don't need to explain further. I had to leave.

I am dissociating emotionally from everything at the moment, but the stress of it all is killing me, I need to pay rent in 3 days, all I have in the pantry are oats and tap water, my bank account has a few cents, I lost my job, my school wants to throw me out and notify my parents, and then they would have all the right to call the police and come to collect me. This isn't a country where the child is always protected, it's one where the leather belt is the best disciplinary method. I can't go back.

I've been having suicidal thoughts for the past few days, and I started involuntarily thinking of methods and plans, which is scaring me. I just want to rest. I want to sleep it off, but if I do, then I will get thrown out of school, I will disappoint all these people counting on me, and ruin so many beautiful projects. But if I don't kill myself, I will probably die another way, I am so close of being evicted, and all I've had for the last couple of days are oats, water and coffee. Christ I can't even afford the razors in order to do it. I don't know what to do, I want to sleep.

We both eventually stopped working at the place we met. I really liked hanging out with him at work and talking to him, so I followed him on Instagram. We started dming a lot, and I guess maybe he dm‚Äôs more than my friends do because we would talk on there like everyday. And it wasn‚Äôt dry texting, we would do bits and stuff (*reminder not in person, just dms). He was always interacting with my posts and we would send each other stuff. I invited him to coffee but that was the only time we hung out. He had told me about a performance he had, the time and the place. But when I brought it up he said, ‚ÄúI invited you?‚Äù and that really stung. I didn‚Äôt go to the performance because I said I was busy that night (which I was but I wouldn‚Äôt go either way). I stopped messaging him as much and started texting drier because my ego/feelings were a little hurt. My good friend also told me to stop talking to him, and I trust her more than him. He also told me about this girl he liked so I knew for sure he wasn‚Äôt in to me. And he would send me stuff like he sent me a reel about how he thinks he might never get married and have kids. I was a bit annoyed by this because I thought it was too personal for a guy that I am not that close with to talk to me about. Like, it made me think, does he wanna talk about romantic stuff or is he just fishing for me to validate him? Eventually, I was like ‚Äúleave me alone‚Äù in like a joking way so it wasn‚Äôt too harsh. That was last semester. This semester, he has not messaged me but he has liked a lot of my notes. Which is weird. Like, people don‚Äôt like notes on instagram hahaha. I‚Äôm still getting over this never-to-be relationship so when he liked a post from a group I posted and then posted another song from the group, I thought about it a lot. Sometimes he would like my note two days in a row. Even though I‚Äôm not into him anymore, it makes posting feel like I‚Äôm gambling, like I‚Äôm seeing if he will interact with it or not. I like posting in general, even before we followed each other so it‚Äôs been a little hard for me to stop. He started liking my stories too (maybe he is just liking everyone‚Äôs stories lately idk), so I hid my story from him. Am I crazy to feel like I was led on?

1jt5hxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jt5hxv/aitah_for_checking_my_wifes_instagram_messages/,AITAH for checking my wife's Instagram messages,"Ok so let me give you a little bit of context of what my life has been in the last quarter.

Me (25M) and my wife (24F) have been married since almost 3 years now. The entire time we've been married I never have noticed something wrong or bad until last December when we were arguing about a stupid matter.

Basically this is what happened: my parents have a recently open glasses store (where you get your prescription glasses, contact lenses and all of that)

They needed money for the rent urgently so my wife decided it was a good idea to buy her prescription glasses from them, so she went to my mother and ask her to make her a pair of prescription glasses.

So the following day my mother went ahead and ask for her previous glasses so she can take their measurements and make her a new pair.

She then went MAD but I mean really bad, she was asking me to tell them to stop making the glasses because ""We didn't have the money for it"", mind you, we did, the glasses where around 60 USD, we had like 1500 usd on the bank account at the moment.

I felt bad because that was the exact amount of money my parents needed to cover the rent for that month and they were counting on it.

Then wife told me to told my parents to stop making the glasses and wait until we had more money to cover the glasses but I wasn't on the mood to tell my parents AGAIN that we were not going to give them money that they need for a pair of glasses she ask for.

That's when she blew up, started crying and telling me how I'm the bad guy and that I was making her look like the bad guy again. Mind you one more time, I'm always giving the excuses to my family whenever she does stuff like this. I'm always either: too tired to go or to broke to give money, or too busy to do things with them.

So no, I never let her face her own consequences, so that's totally my fault to protect her from herself all the time.

So back to the point again, she was screaming, crying and screaming once more, I just wanted to listen to my music and sleep, I was not in the mood for another fight. But everytime I tried to just stop the arguing and sleep she pushed and pushed me into giving some sort of reaction or answer but I really was not on the mood for it that night.

So I just said: ""Please let me sleep, I don't have the strength for this right now"", what did she do? She throw her wedding ring at me.

That action broke me so hard that I couldn't be the same since that day.

Fast forward to today. I've been receiving therapy for almost 3 months now. I've been learning about limits and self-love. Since I've been receiving therapy wife started to take her own therapy seriously.

Her therapist told her to have more friends and expand her social circle.

So one day I'm scrolling through reddit and found a post about coffee shops in our city, essentially this was a dude from the city trying to meet new people. Then I saw a comment about a reddit user recommending to meet on a coffee shop I go with wife a lot, so I started to get suspicious.

Quick context, she has cheated on me before when we were dating 3 times, once when we first started dating, again months later with her neighbor and then on her first year of university with the first dude that show interest on her (this isn't an exaggeration, he literally was the first dude that show interest in her and she just fell for him).
End of quick context.

I looked for the reddit guy's Instagram and noticed wife started following him, at that point it was weird for me that she was looking for friends on Reddit but honestly I've heard of it so I didn't care that much.

But then our of a sudden she changed her pfp to a photo with a swimsuit, mind you: she has never changed her Instagram photo, like ever, since she registered on Instagram. But then days after starting to talk with this dude she changed it.

So that's when it really started to bothering me and I was so suspicious about what were they talking about.

So a couple days ago I couldn't hold it any longer and I decided to look into her Instagram chats. I know I should've not do that and that it was violating her intimacy. But honestly she has done that too many times to me so I thought just this once I needed to know.

So I did but before reading I thought yo myself that all I needed to know was if she mentioned our marriage. If she did I would know her intentions with this dude are just friendly and we would be ok.

I started reading and reading, this dude is clearly interested in meeting her, he was sooo insisting in going to get something to drink and talk. And she was too.

The conversation wasn't in any way intimate nor wasn't cheating. But I can't shake the fact that she changed her pfp just when starting to talk with this dude and never actually mentioned that she's married.

Even though this dude is clearly interested in her.

I've already told her all about how I look into her phone but now I feel so bad about that.

And I know I'm not justified to have look into her privacy, so that's why I'm wondering Am I the asshole in this situation?",0,1743976282.0,AITAH,5,0.33,False

We met at the party at the work and, we were a bit tipsy and I walked her home. She invited me to hers while I will wait for taxi so I said ok. And we end up talking whole night till 6am, but nothing happend because I didn't want to fuck something up since she is my colleague (been there).

So after that we started to talk more and going out on dates but no one gave it labels. It wasn't super regular but maybe once a week. I was ok with that because I prefer when things go slowly so I get to know her.

And 3 months passed and we get closer we were flirting on every ""date"" and had a blast.

So 3 weeks ago we were out on a hike for 3 hours then get back to town and she asked me if we want to spend more time together and go get some coffee, so we went and after that I walked her home and she said thst if her roommate wasn't home she would love me to get to her place for some tea.

The we didn't see each other for 3 weeks cause I was sick and then she went on vacation.

So I had time to think and and I realized I missed her much so I was about to ask her to get things to next level. I was pretty sure she is on the same page since our last trip went so well.

We finally met and everything was fine as always time flew by and we were talking about future and she told me she doesn't see her as a wife in a future so I asked her why is she even thinking about it. On which she replied that she is ""probably"" in relationship for 2 months. I was in shock but I saw she was pretty uncomfortable telling me. I didn't asked her much because I am not good at confronting people.

Then I walked her home and while doing so I told her I am glad she finally told me because I wouldn't act like I did on our ""dates"" if I knew she had someone and that I was about to asked her to take our relationship to next level. On which she just asked me if we are still friends, I said yes because no one got hurt since we were not together and then she started crying we had a 10 sec hug and went our ways.

At first I thought I am ok and told myself it's my fault because I should tell her sooner and I missed opportunity.

But second day it hit me and I dont know if I should try to meet her and ask her why she didn't tell me sooner, why she was flirting with me, why we were planning trips together. And get some answers. Or I should just leave it on her if she want to be friends the she should make next move and try to reach out to me, because now she is just sending me memes...",1,1743976221.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

I have had my breville barista express since December and have very fruitlessly tried to pull decent shots to eventually use in an iced latte. I used to work at a coffee shop a long time ago, so I have been around decent to very good espresso, and I am absolutely not getting close to that.

Here is some information:
- I am using locally roasted beans from a highly regarded roaster in the area(award winning, etc) ‚Äî using their espresso roast (which is dark)
- I have invested in a spring loaded tamper so I can at the very least tamp consistently to eliminate a variable
- I am using purified water incase my faucet water would have any effect on my coffee flavor
- I grind on a 2 right now (finer lower, coarser higher up to 10)
- I am grinding 17g of beans
- I grind into cup to help aerate the grounds, rather than right into the portafilter (I am not sure if this truly is making a difference)
- I am pulling shots that hit the ‚Äúespresso‚Äù zone in the pressure gage, consistently

Why I think my shots are bad:
- sour tasting, which I have read this means grind is too fine, but
- bitter/burnt taste, which I have read this means grind is too coarse (I am so confused which one I am doing)
- with 17g of beans, I am getting close to 55 g of coffee (I pull doubles) which I feel like is too much
- this is with around a 25-30 second extraction time including infusion time
- I fear there may be channeling happening?
- when I remove my portafilter, my puck is watery at the top, but does come out in one piece. Sometimes it sticks to the underside of the machine and the filter is empty when I pull it out.

I‚Äôll be honest‚Ä¶ I have been hard working at this for 4 months now, watching tons of videos, reading a lot of posts in this reddit, taking notes and every weekend dedicating about 2 hrs Saturday and 2 hrs Sunday trying to get something usable. I am getting so discouraged and frustrated. I can‚Äôt return the machine anymore, so any help would be so greatly appreciated. I have invested a lot (for me) money into making this work, so I will try anything. (Please be nice to me)

Look,‚Äú he told me,
‚Äúall those little children dying in the trees.‚Äù
And I said, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù
He said, ‚Äúlook.‚Äù
And I went to the window and sure enough, there they were hanging in the trees,
dead and dying.
And I said, ‚ÄúWhat does it mean?‚Äù
He said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs authorized.‚Äù

The next day I got up and they had dogs in the trees,
hanging, dead, and dying.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it, it‚Äôs the way of things. They took a vote. It was decided.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt see how they caught all those cats so fast and hung them in the trees, but they did.
The next day it was horses,
and that wasn‚Äôt so good because many bad branches broke.

1jt5db9,https://www.reddit.com/r/comingout/comments/1jt5db9/i_came_out_to_my_religious_family_my_story_advice/,I came out to my religious family - My story + advice,"Hi there, I am a lesbian and I am 26 years old. As a gay woman who grew up in a strict muslim family, there were limited videos or content rather than when I was still in the closet and struggling. It was difficult having limited resources and advice and kind of made it a lot scarier. So I am hoping this post finds someone who may need to see it or someone who is seeking comfort in their current circumstances. I am sharing my story 8 years later after being silenced quite a bit.¬†

To start, I came out of the closet when I was 18 years old. I had always known I was gay I always had crushes on girls and I have always known that this is a part of who I am. My original plan when I was a teenager was to act like this part of me wasn't real, I was going to let my family marry me off to a muslim man and I was just going to suck it up and try to live that lie. As I got older though I knew that could not hide this part of me anymore. It was a very difficult realization because I knew that when I spoke my truth I would not be accepted for who I was and knew my family would try to get me ‚Äúhelp‚Äù to try to fight and fend off these feelings. So rather than scheduling a day to tell them, I scheduled a day to run away. I had a friend who was going to college a couple hours away, and the idea was proposed that I move in with them and their other friends after coming out of the closet. So to make a long story short, four months before the lease to the apartment would start I put down a deposit on the apartment with them in secret. If you are muslim you know that an Arab girl not living at home without being married is kind of rare. At least in the environment I grew up in. So I had to keep that a secret. About a month after I put down that deposit, my father passed away unexpectedly. This created alot of grief in my family, and I had contemplated whether or not I was ready to even come out. These hardships made me think that maybe I shouldnt come out quite yet. But unfortunately, I was unable to get out of my lease and my coming out date for August 6th 2017 stood still.¬†

When the day came, I had already secretly moved some of my stuff out over the course of a few weeks. At around 3 in the morning when I knew everyone in my family was asleep, I snuck out and hopped onto my bike towards a friend's house. My plan was to call my family in the morning and to let them know my truth. And that is exactly what I did, once I arrived at my friend's house I didn't really sleep. As soon as 8 o'clock hit I made the call and as difficult as it was, I came out as gay. I got the reaction that I expected. There was a lot of cussing, a lot of crying, and a lot of rejection. I don't want to go too deep into the exact moment but I will say it will be a day that I remember for the rest of my life. It was not easy and it was the hardest thing I ever had to do. I did not want to say goodbye to all these people I had known my entire life. It was and still is earth shattering. Coming out isnt something that you are really ‚ÄúReady‚Äù for. Yeah there were moments before I came out where I wanted to shout it out. My intention was never to hurt anyone, even though I knew I would. I just couldn't continue to live life as a lie.

During this period of my life I received a lot of hate messages, a lot of threats, I had my socials hacked into and I was stalked. I lived my life in paranoia and grief. Grieving my father who passed away three months prior, grieving my family who said they would never forgive me for this, and grieving that life I lived for 18 years. Coming out caused a ripple effect, and like dominoes so much of my life came tumbling down. By September of that year I had been overwhelmed with this huge change in my life. My apartment was near train tracks, and one night I got up from bed and walked to them. I didn't really have a plan, maybe just lay there and hope the train takes me? About halfway there something came over me where I guess I just needed someone to listen. Instead I walked to the hospital. I spent the night there speaking to a counselor who, if I'm being honest, was very unkind. I walked away feeling sadder than I had walked in. I was placed on suicide watch and was told that I could go home but i will have to answer my phone when the hospital calls or they would send an ambulance to retrieve me. So I started to walk back home but stopped at a gas station right by the hospital to get something to drink. As I was checking out, the cashier who I will never forget, his name was Sterling, said ‚ÄúEverything is going to be okay, you know.‚Äù I don't know if it was the dark circles around my eyes or the hospital bracelet around my wrist. But I really needed to hear those words. He did more for me than the counselor at the hospital did for me. It was much needed, and I am forever grateful for him.¬†

Eventually they were able to find where I was living and it felt really unsafe for me, even when I expressed this to the leasing office I was unable to get out of my lease. So I moved into my barely functioning car in the middle of winter with no heat. I parked in parking lots and went to coffee shops as soon as 5am to warm up. It was a miserable time in my life. I kept my homelessness a secret from the friends I still had left except for one, who let me crash on his couch if the cold got too unbearable. There really are no words I can use to describe this time in my life, it was dark, hard, and numbing.¬†

I eventually made some more friends who I spoke my truth to, my story, being homeless, etc. I slowly learned that family isn‚Äôt always blood. My friend's family heard my story and decided to take me in. I was able to start anew and I had a roof over my head. I started to discover things about myself that I didn‚Äôt notice before because I was too busy struggling with the loss of all I had ever known. I went to film school and I was able to grow into my passion. I met the love of my life and we have two cats, they are my little family. I want to emphasize that this is just a little summary of my coming out story, and if you would like some advice, please feel free to message me. But here is some advice I would like to leave for whoever needs to hear it:¬†

I know that coming out can be hard and scary, but I promise you it is so worth it in the end. It‚Äôs better to live a truthful life than to live a lie. Things will look up even when it gets too much. I didn‚Äôt believe that to be true when I first came out, but I‚Äôm here to let you know 8 years later it is absolutely true. I am sorry that you are struggling right now, and I‚Äôm sorry that you are carrying this heavy weight. Be kind and gentle to yourself, you will make it out stronger. I am proud of you for getting this far. 

I‚Äôm not sure if this part is allowed and if it‚Äôs not please let me know and I will gladly delete it, but I talk about my story on my TikTok @solarisvisuals in hopes that I can create a platform to bring more awareness to situations similar to mine. Feel free to message me on there as well with any questions or if you would like some advice.

Wishing everyone on this subreddit peace and contentment <3

As this campaign begins to transition into the endgame, submod shenanigans will ramp up to facilitate and reward emergent storylines and player conflicts. Many future large-scale events that affect Kumkayeisak will not be reproducible in base Anbennar.*

The Conquest of Mahinosy went as expected. Anbenncost sent no troops or ships to assist their ally, allowing our fleets to completely blockade the Mihitarabi coastline. One by one their cities fell. Discussions in the Scaled Council swelled as the halflings drew closer and closer to capitulating. Our empire was not equipped to take on the administrative burden of annexing the entire nation, so provinces with the most mercantile value were prioritized in the peace treaty. The Hooded Lords wished to seize the two nahzyn plantations Mihitarab owned, while the Scaled Lords wished to take the Anbenncoster clove trading station of Ingarava.

The realm entered a time of peace and building after the war‚Äôs conclusion. Samsumbat, deep into the process of integrating with our empire, was relieved of their duty to assist the Combined Imperial Forces in order to devote more time to their assimilation. Speaking of our military capabilities, up to this point our navy had been little more than bodyguards for the ships of the Seahorse Coast Trading Company, protecting their interests all along the southern Sarhal coastline. As we clashed more and more frequently with powers in Cannor, it could no longer be assured that our weak hold over our waters would continue to go unchallenged. Our Scaled Navy was upgraded with copper-bottomed galleons to brave the open seas. Meanwhile, the newly-acquired provinces of Mahinosy and Jakavafo had their aquacultural infrastructure improved and expanded to grow nahzyn in even greater quantities. These acquisitions gave our empire near-total control over the production of the seaweed. Only a few offshore plantations lay outside of our grasp.

[Nahzyn production in the South Sarhal Sea](https://preview.redd.it/050ajmxt6ate1.png?width=1463&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c37ba49b329f1b65007429171f1c9dacdd5c81d)

It was during this time of peace and prosperity that Scaled Speaker Mzikisa called an unexpected meeting of the Scaled Council. The Scaled and Hooded Lords arranged themselves in their usual battle lines, facing each other across the Council Chamber. Mzikisa began the session by claiming that he had found a flaw in the Pillars of Governance. A flaw that could bring the empire to its knees if not addressed.¬†

The Pillar of Wisdom required that every child of the Five Families of the council must be taught with great care to ensure that they had the moral fortitude to carry the burden of leadership. Samsumbat‚Äôs Tower of Muhaqaar, the most prestigious mage academy in Sarhal, would no doubt be a boon to this endeavor once it fell under our direct control. But Mzikisa warned that even this may not be enough. There was simply no way to ensure that each candidate for the throne was of firm character.¬†

The selection pool was too large, for one. Each of the Five Families usually had multiple candidates that were being groomed for Speakership at any given time. There would always be at least one bad banana in the bunch. Additionally, the power struggles between the Five Families influenced the candidate selection just as much as merit did. The good of the nation was not always at the front of the minds of the Five Families‚Äô leaders as they chose which candidate to present. Lastly, the Scaled Council had no constitutional powers to remove a Scaled Speaker. If a corrupt individual managed to claim the Scaled Throne, they were guaranteed to rule for nine years, no matter how much damage they caused to our empire. Our nation, he continued, had thus far been blessed with more great leaders than terrible ones. But for every Saban ‚Äòthe Visionary‚Äô, there was a Vunyani ‚Äòthe Fool‚Äô. For every Ananto ‚Äòthe Herald‚Äô, a Sesethu ‚Äòthe Denier‚Äô. A string of weak, ineffective Scaled Speakers could ruin Kumkayeisak the way it had Kheterata. Something must change.¬†

It was then Mzikisa revealed himself to be a vampire. A nearly-immortal being of superhuman power and ability. The only way to ensure that the Ikilshebe would always have a just, strong ruler, he proclaimed, would be if that ruler never changed. He declared a restructuring of the empire, dissolving the Scaled Council and discontinuing the elections for the Scaled Throne. He would rule forever, not as a Hooded Lord, but as the Hooded Emperor. The outraged Council immediately called a vote to overturn this decision. The Scaled Lords unanimously voted against Scaled Speaker Mzikisa, quickly approaching the number of votes necessary to stop his plans. Their confidence quickly turned to confusion as the first Hooded Lord voted in favor of the restructuring. That confusion bubbled into worry as the next lords followed suit. The eighth Hooded Lord to vote smiled at the Scaled Lords, revealing a set of fangs, and the worry boiled over into despair. By the time the last vote was cast, it was clear that vampires had infested enough of the Council to prevent the veto. The Scaled Lords departed in a rage as Hooded Emperor Mzikisa began the process of reorganizing the government.¬†

Confusion rippled throughout the empire as his proclamation went out the following week. The vampires of Sarhal would not rule in the fashion of their northern brethren, hiding behind shadows and secrets. They would rule in the open, proud of their heritage and willing to represent themselves on the world stage. In the same vein, we were no longer an empire that hid behind our scales, always on the defensive. We were an empire of fangs, teeth bared in defiance of any who would oppose us.

[Kumkayeamazi, the Empire of Fangs, the prophesied 333rd empire of the lizardfolk](https://preview.redd.it/a57w2ppn6ate1.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6c83f070308583876ce136fb71fb43344deaa49)

The deposed Scaled Lords went to ground and began stirring up distrust and resentment throughout the breadth of the empire. Talks of armed counter revolutions swept among the populace. The Ashhana lizardfolk capitalized on the unrest and began a widespread assault on the Taneyas fortification network. Multiple pacification campaigns were started in Katala Raz to crack down on the bloodcrazed beasts. Samsumbat, wary of the sudden instability of their imperial overlord, paused their efforts at assimilating. There was even an emergency meeting of the Council of Nations as some of the member states received desperate messages from the Scaled Lords. As the Hooded Emperor argued at the impropriety of the Council taking an interest in internal Ikilshebe affairs, the other empires weighed the merits of taking a stance on the Sanguine Revolution.

The situation reached a boiling point in early 1657 AA when a contingent of Scaled Lords met with Hooded Emperor Mzikisa in the now-empty Council Chamber. They issued an ultimatum - either Mzikisa stepped down and allowed the republican traditions of Kumkayeisak to resume, or the Night of Cleansing that had removed the Medawor from Isagumze would pale in comparison to the civil war that erupted across the empire. The Hooded Emperor‚Äôs response was lost as the chamber was suddenly plunged into darkness and drowned in the sound of nine and ninety winds. An enormous shape fell through the massive open skylight and landed amid an expanding ring of dust, leaves, and the smell of spices. Nyokyora, God of the Ikilshebe, had returned once more.¬†

Sembled back into His human form, Nyokyora stalked right up to the Hooded Emperor, who was frozen in place and much paler than normal. Nyokyora spent several long moments searching for something in the emperor‚Äôs eyes. Then He stepped back and barked out a laugh. ‚ÄúAn eternal emperor for the Eternal Empire, eh? Very well. I‚Äôm interested in seeing how this plays out‚Ä¶‚Äù He then swept from the chamber, calling for a bath to be drawn and for His Oware board to be brought out.¬†

The civil unrest evaporated overnight as word of Nyokyora‚Äôs sanctioning of the Sanguine Revolution spread. The Scaled Lords, unable to act against our God‚Äôs wishes, quietly returned to their pedestrian lives. Samsumbat hesitantly resumed their assimilation process. The resolution to condemn the vampiric coup fell apart in the Council of Nations as Karakhanbar and The Reach failed to gather enough support to pass it. Disasters averted, Kumkayeamazi continued to march towards eternity.¬†¬†¬†

That eternity included a Horashesh united in truth, not just name. The Conquest of Kunolo was initiated in order to bring the last two former Medasi into the imperial fold - Kunolo and Samishesha. Samishesha fell almost immediately, unprepared for the armies that marched over their borders with only a few days of notice. As Nyokyora‚Äôs Host dug in for an extended siege of the port city of Kunolo, their Fangaulan allies rallied a surprisingly effective defense and stopped the rest of our forces‚Äô advance into Dao Nako. Pitched battles raged left and right as the Combined Imperial Forces ground slowly westward, but they bled heavily for every inch of ground.¬†

Our newly-outfitted navy sailed on to blockade the Fangaulan coastline once Kunolo was captured. Here our lack of experience in naval warfare proved costly. Uncaring that our fleets were far outside of our resupply range, our admirals ran them ragged simply patrolling the coastline. In two brilliantly timed battles, the Fangaulan navy smashed our decaying fleets to splinters and ensured an uncontested naval theatre for the rest of the war.

Even so, the fortresses of Dao Nako slowly fell one by one. As our armies overextended in an attempt to reach the capital, Fangaula seized the opportunity to send a few legions through Samsumbat to attack our undefended eastern regions. Respectful of Samsumbat‚Äôs neutrality as they continued their annexation, the Fangaulan forces marched straight through Khetapera without antagonizing the locals. With a brilliantly timed maneuver of our own, Chancellor Guzme Sekamdal signed the documents that finalized the integration of Samsumbat just as the Fangaulans were marching through the Mukis Mountain passes. The Guards of the Free, no longer neutral parties, fell upon the unsuspecting West Sarhalys and decimated their forces.¬†

Back in Fangaula proper, the Knights of the Fang successfully punched through the walls of Benba Kulu and marched on the capital. Having been informed of the failed ploy to the east and surrounded by enemy armies, Emperor Majnun I Camara sent an offer of peace to our leader. It did not offer nearly enough. Perhaps the tales of what had happened last time the Ikilshebe came to Atijo Sigilan had faded over time, the Hooded Emperor mused. Thus it was that Nyokyora graced the skies of Janama for a second time.¬†

The Medasi system had ostensibly been created so that Kheterata could better handle the administration of the varying cultures and peoples of South Sarhal. In reality, its main purpose had been to prevent the tribes from ever uniting. Kumkayeamazi proved that the Khets‚Äô fears were well founded as the last two Medasi were welcomed under our banner. Though Asheniande and The Command continued to gain more and more land in Sarhal, our nation was now the strongest Sarhal-based empire by far.¬†

Our Hooded Emperor‚Äôs next goal became the absorption of Duwarkani. The initial meetings had a rough start as the harpies were understandably upset by our recent acquisition of Samsumbat. That redrawing of borders had left them completely surrounded by our empire. They also had more than a couple misgivings about being ruled by a vampire. Eventually, a settlement was reached when the Hooded Emperor agreed to marry Lady Tentamun II Menkaunswt‚Äôs youngest daughter, Forna Menkaunswt.

[Long live the Empress-Consort](https://preview.redd.it/g82was1z5ate1.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=caf9151d7fb8f3c5a29081a87c5efb4124cd06d0)

The Empress-Consort‚Äôs first official act was to visit the World Tree in Sprigi Twani. The bards and agrimancers had finished their work, and the Tree stood tall for the first time in centuries, free from the weight of Strangler Vines. Yet it remained weak after so long under the influence of the hags and needed time to heal. The harpy consort announced the last and final revitalization stage: a mass cleansing of Yezelne Nisha. Every plant, creature, or Shadow Plane-influenced material would be removed from the Heart of the Swamp. Eventually, the Tree would be strong enough to erect a barrier between the Shadow and Material Planes. Until then, Kumkayeamazi would give it a safe space in which to rest and recuperate. Ikilshebe hunting parties began to relocate or eradicate the unnatural beasts such as crocodilians and death vultures. The Mihipha agrimancers taught our troops how to tell the difference between shadow-corrupted plants such as the Hattiatia and Last Wish, and those which had simply evolved to survive in the environment, like the Night Blossom or Black Coffee.

With two decades-long projects moving into their final stages, our emperor decided the time was ripe to at last deal with a thorn that was lodged in the side of our empire. The bountiful lands of Fahvanosy had been the subject of many wars throughout the history of our nation, yet two halfling realms stubbornly held on even now. The areas we conquered had seen explosive growth and prosperity under our rule, yet the proud little people insisted on squandering the lands they had been blessed with. No longer. The Final Conflict for Fahvanosy was made up of two wars against Mihitarab and Bamdikizy. They called in Anbenncost and Beepeck, respectively, but our leader knew how little the Cannorians cared for the island halflings.¬†

Bamdikizy capitulated first, giving over not only their land but some of Beepeck‚Äôs holdings in Dao Nako. This included New Hookfield, now renamed Wabeniyeqabyi, the site of a half-buried zatsarya. With this,¬† only one more zatsarya remained outside of our grasp - the Citadel of Kuvunika. Still intent on the current war, Hooded Emperor Mzikisa commanded his generals to begin drawing up plans for an invasion of Shelokmengi. Controlling all of the zatsarya would further strengthen our claim to the Throne of Eternity.

[Kumkayeamazi, the first openly-vampiric nation in history, circa 1674](https://preview.redd.it/z1yk6iwu5ate1.png?width=2559&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c41d3672c261595277ed23a89ae786f316314e)

Our compatriots on the Council of Nations have come a long way from when we first contacted each other through the blapalantirs. Starting out as small, struggling nations, each of us have grown into continent-spanning superpowers. None of this would have been possible without our radical system of mutual support and knowledge sharing.¬†

And yet it seems that this is slowly being forgotten. The grasslands of the Forbidden Plains have become matted and trampled as armies of hobgoblins and Reachmen sneer at each other while patrolling their shared border. The Kharakanbari orcs conquer south as fast as they are able, desperate to grab as much land as possible before becoming completely surrounded by the Reach, the Command, and Asheniande. The tunnels of the Serpentspine ring with hammers and bellows as the silent Molten Amber Dwarves prepare for yet another war. Our new vampiric leader will need all of the wisdom and strength of Nyokyora if we are to keep this two hundred-year compact from fracturing.

I hope it can help someone see a silver lining, as it‚Äôs the story of how and when my parents met. 

My dad, 41, worked nights for a newspaper. During one (well, probably several) of those nights, his girlfriend cheated on him. He had to break up with her and it was a whole thing: screaming, crying, furniture in the garden, locks changed, the works. He was devastated. 

My mother, 32, had a boyfriend who went on a work trip in Colombia. It turned out that he had found a nice Colombian girlfriend and my mother was broken up with on the phone. She was *also* devastated. She was a working student at the time, and this will be relevant. 

By chance, trying to change his habits after the break up, my father started going to a cafe in the city center at the end of his night shifts. Coincidentally, that is were my mother always went to have her breakfast. 

She was determined to leave her ex in the past. ‚ÄúI will not drop one tear for that loser‚Äù kind of mindset. That is when she saw my father, on a random Tuesday. He was minding his business and having coffee, still sad (it had been a month-ish), but kind of intrigued by the woman that kept glancing in his direction. That girl was *on a mission*. 

A couple of days later, she striked and ‚Äúforgot‚Äù her books at the cafe, and he jumped at the opportunity. The next day they started talking and got to know each other better. Two months later they started dating and they were together ever since. Six years later, I was born in a house full of love when they were 38 and 47. 

They were married for 28 years, until my father passed away, and even in death, he still holds her heart. 

They were both done dirty by their exes, but it was fine, because they found each other. If my dad had stayed with his shitty ex, they wouldn‚Äôt have. If my mom had listened to her shitty ex who obviously came back crying, they wouldn‚Äôt have. 

When he was about to die, he said to my mother that his only regret was not meeting her sooner and wasting his time on shitty relationships.

The moral of the story is that your person is out there, no matter your age. You have time. Breakups are devastating, but they *will* lead you to your forever home. 

I hope this story brings some of you comfort. I wish you the best on your journey. ",2,1743975559.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

i get the fact that the game has a gym but who exactly likes just spamming the space bar to get buff ?  
what really does the game bring when you cant have achievments using cheats ?  
after all vigilante,firefighter,taxi,and deliveries are basically copy pasted from gta vc so to be fair that kinda sucks... although vigilante on a cop bike and the fact that ambulance missions do give you more hp makes a lot of sense (instead of pizza boy in VC) but pizza boy in vice city is kinda funny and sort of makes the gameplay a bit more sort of in the other direction of the crime,which is a decompression from the story (just an opinion dont hate on me im just sayin okay,relax) it still is kinda the same rinse and repeat boring chore a video game offers in both games,but make it kinda fun idk...  
the whole hot coffee problem makes girlfriend kinda useless...although two of the girlfriends give you good bonuses-the other ones dont...the rest of the side activities are extremely long-100 spray tags,50,horse shoes,50 oysters---bro VC had 100 collectibles-this game has like 250...why ?  
why do you need so many ? what is so interesting in just exploring a place where there is literally nobody but you ? GTA open world RPG MMORPG ? like san Andreas is a game which looks like it has an identity crisis dude. you're a gangster,then you are some sort of san francisco racer boy,then some weird zero RC missions,the country side and catalina with claude is an interesting easter egg,but the race isnt even fun-its just checkpoints :D most of the useless full of rinse and repeat proccesses are that.  
i mean i've played it when i was like 16-now im 27.  
it was fun i do admit and gta V is worse im not saying modern gta is so much better lmao.  
But in the end of the day looking back at this game i just dont get it ? i don't what was so fun about it  
its boring... i did 100% on VC and i was not with nostalgia glasses-ive did SA two times but never 100% it.  
because i dont have the energy for it... lol i remember GTA SA was praised for mods and multiplayer---  
we used to fuck around a lot with cheat engine and other stuff... i guess thats why gta 5 now has a success because what the developers do to the game isnt really the fun of gta at all lmao

Before diving into the scents themselves, I‚Äôve got to give props to the shipping and overall service. Each decant came well-packaged, neatly labeled, and arrived faster than expected. At $1.99 per sample, it‚Äôs a solid way to explore different scents without committing to a full bottle. Now, onto the fragrances:

1. Vintage Radio by Lattafa,
smells strangely like an old grandmas house but in the best way possible. Think smooth vanilla with a leather twist. great date night scent, perfect for colder weather. 9/10

2. Aromatic Star Anise,
Clean, herbal, and slightly sweet. kinda like a weaker version of sauvage with more alcohol. Good for everyday wear 6/10

3. Amber Oud Gold Edition by Al Haramain,
Sweet, fruity, almost too sweet, all I could really smell was bubblegum 5/10

4. Club de Nuit Intense Man by Armaf,
despite how well liked this one is it was probably one of my least favorite, very generic pine sol scent, reminded me of a lemony spruce forest 4/10

5. Fakhar Black by Lattafa,
super fresh, has a suprisingly expensive smell to it. fresh deodorant shower smell mixed with some complexity. my wife really loved this one 9/10

6. Sceptre Malachite by Maison Alhambra,
Green, tropical, and slightly citrusy. It opens fresh and herbal, then mellows into a woody base.very feminine leaning, could definitely be unisex but i really like it 8.5/10 

7. Khamrah Qahwa by Lattafa,
This one's rich with sweet coffee and spice, very heavy on the cinnamon, almost dessert-like. could also be unisex, feminine leaning. Warm, cozy, and perfect for fall or winter. 7.5/10

I really like the atomizers on these 1ml bottles, shipping was fast and price was affordable. Most likely would shop with again, hope they have some more options in the future. would like to see more of the jean lowe line",1,1743975248.0,fragranceclones,1,1.0,False

1jt50qh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianConservative/comments/1jt50qh/why_do_people_bring_up_culture_war_talking_points/,Why do people bring up culture war talking points when discussing Pierre?,"I've been this a lot on Twitter/X.  It's a trend of people attacking Pierre over cultural issues like LGBT Rights,  Abortion and the freedom convoy


This is a problem with political discourse where people don't have all the facts and they distort their view of a politician into a caricature. It happens with Trump, Trudeau and now it's Poilievre.  


Let's address them one by one.



LGBT rights:     There is a clip going around of Pierre opposing gay marriage in the 2000s
 Where he says ""they oppose redefining traditional marriage"".  That is true, but it's not the party position now. Do people realize that Canada has progressed further in thought and culture. The Conservatives are for the rights of all Canadians including the LGBT community. After gay marriage was passed conservatives like the infamous MAXIME BERNIER, Patrick Brown and others attended a pride parade. Not to mention, the current deputy leader for the CPC Mellissa Lantsman is a married Lesbian. So this idea that the Tories will strip away gay marriage is complete fearmongering nonsense.  And for trans rights specifically,  Pierre voted yes for banning conversion therapy based on gender identity. This is a balanced approach because he opposed puberty blockers for minors. 



Abortion:   The party platform is that they don't care about abortion. They don't want to make legislation for or against it. Pierre has said this multiple times. The notion that they are attacking women's rights is asinine. It's all Justin Trudeau talking points. Justin Trudeau would say ""we proudly believe in preserving a woman's right to choose"". Bitch, who is taking your rights away? No one, nowhere. 



Freedom Convoy: I think people are getting too worked up on the freedom convoy. Pierre agreed that it was a legitimate protest and gave people coffee and doughnuts. The same thing Toronto Police did with Free Palestine protestors. Lumping violent actors with everyone egregiously generalizes everything.  Also, Pierre does not support diagolon. They are a bunch of retards who hijacked a legitimate protest. Not to mention, Jeremy Mackenzie faced charges for joking about sexually assaulting Pierre's wife. Poilievre was never a fan of the Alt-right or dialogon.


I hope people can do better research and look at both sides of the argument before voting. Because most of the topics can be easily debunked and can be seen as half-truths. ",10,1743974964.0,CanadianConservative,6,0.92,False

We haven't really had much issues and I have a great relationship with his family. However something that has always bugged me is the way he behaves towards his SIL. He honestly seems, for lack of better word, obsessed with her.

My bf and his brother are pretty close in age, so they're part of like the same friend group. That's why we see them quite a lot like going out, visiting, having group dinners and also on family birthdays and stuff. Whenever we see them my bf always, without exception, makes sure he sits next (or very close) to her. He tends to mostly just talk to her on these kind of occasions/events. He also uses cute names when adressing her (kind of hard to translate in the right tone, but I think ""sweetheart"" would probably be the most accurate term). Leading up to these visits he even tells me how excited he is to meet them. He says 'them' as in his brother and SIL, but I feel like it's really just her. They also meet 1-on-1 quite regularly for like coffee or lunch.

It's simply something that I have found that works for me, and the reason that it works for me is not mentioned when I try to research how only drinking water helps quitting smoking. They just go on a spiel about how water flushes the toxins from your system, well that's not why it helps me, or at least not the big reason.

1jt4rhl,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1jt4rhl/18_months_and_107_supplements_later/,18 months and 107 supplements later,"And I'm still stuck in this post-viral hell.

This is my story. It is a long read, not for everyone, but I hope someone might read it and offer some help. 

At this point, I feel like I've exhausted every possible avenue and I'm done using ChatGPT as a sounding board.

**The initial infection**

Just over 2 years ago I came down with a nasty virus that had all the hallmarks of covid (despite testing negative) - loss of sense of taste, loss of sense of smell, high temperature, muscle aches and the most fatigue I have ever felt, completely bedridden for over two weeks.

For the first 7 months, I wouldn't say I had the kind of long Covid I have now (more on that later), but I certainly noticed some things were odd. I would crash after carb-heavy meals or deserts and would need to sleep for an hour or two in the middle of the day. For approximately the first 4 months, I needed a mid-afternoon nap because I could not keep my eyes open. I was so tired, especially after lunch. At this point, this fatigue and insulin-like resistance was my only real symptom. 

Some 8 months after my initial infection, after being incredibly careful about not engaging in physical exercise after reading all the horror stories on here, I decided to slowly build up my fitness and hire a personal trainer. In my second week of training, I woke up one day before my session feeling quite groggy and tired. I felt like cancelling the session, but figured I was just being a coward. Boy was I wrong. About 5 minutes into my warmup on the treadmill, I felt like I was going to die. I checked my heart rate - 190 bpm. My personal trainer told me to stop and we ended the session for the day. I have not ran since. 

**The real hell begins**

For the next week, I was bedridden with what I can only describe as ME/CFS symptoms, or perhaps PEM. I could not do anything. After eventually finding some energy to get up on the 3rd or 4th day, I immediately felt dizzy and this dreaded feeling of palpitations and anxiety began. I checked my heart rate and it was 140 bpm. I had POTS. Somewhere around that same time, I also developed yellow and foul smelling stools, which remain to this day, undigested food in stools and bloating after meals. Thankfully, the CFS/ME symptoms dissipated over a couple of weeks, but they do come back in full force if I let my heart rate get too high for too long. I also seem to have developed a short fuse, I get emotional and angry easily, but it's hard to say whether this is because I feel so stressed and upset at the situation my body is in or because it's a direct symptom of whatever the hell this is. 

Since this dramatic worsening in September of 2023, I have tried every supplement under the sun, achieving a couple of short-term remissions:

a) January 2024 I had a 3-week remission after taking 1,200mg of NAC/day. This effect eventually wore off.  
b) November 2024 I had another short period of remission after supplementing with SAM-e, Dihydromyricetin, Boron, Vitamin B2 and Tongkat Ali. I stopped after developing stomach pains.   
c) 70% remission on low-histamine, low sulfur, low fat diet after 5 days (combined with anti-histamines and fat-soluble vitamins A and E). I relapsed pretty quickly, because all I was eating on this diet was rice. 

I've also achieved some mild improvements in my POTS with certain antihistamines, including Xyzal and Bilastine but the effects are small and not permanent, and my stools have not improved either. 

**Bloodwork & other tests**

Unremarkable. The only abnormal biomarker was low IgM, which I was told was clinically insignificant, although I'm not convinced. H pylori, stool tests for parasites and active viruses (HIV, CMV and EBV) all came back negative. SIBO breath tests for both hydrogen and methane also came back negative. It's not possible to test for H2S SIBO where I am but I don't think I have it. B vitamins and trace minerals all came back normal. Iron normal. Testosterone is within normal range albeit on the low end of normal for a man of my age (early 30s). 

My personal working theory is that somehow there is a metabolic/liver element to my type of long Covid given that both NAC and SAM-e seem to have improved my condition, albeit temporarily. I also believe there is a histamine component, and I also think I may have functional fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies given my yellow stools. 

I had pre-existing grade I fatty liver at the time of the initial infection, which remains to this day. On this basis, I have tried to supplement liver supporting herbs such as milk thistle, artichoke, dandelion and TUDCA, but these have not brought me any improvements in my POTS, and they've dramatically worsened my stools every time and also given me BAM symptoms. 

I have also had my microbiome tested with biomesight, where I discovered high elevations of novispirillum (proteobacteria), which I have since brought back to normal levels using interventions such as lactulose and high dose vitamin C. My bifido although improved is still low, while my akkermansia and lactobacillus are non-existent. My bacteroides are now slightly elevated, but they were normal when I first had POTS anyway.

In the last 6 months, I would say I've also developed some gastritis-like symptoms. It's unclear if this has been brought on by stress, or by using my body as a guinea pig trialing all sorts of supplements, drugs and snake oil, daily-coffee on empty stomach (which I've done for years), or is simply another delayed long-covid symptom. 

Here's a non-exhaustive list of supplements and drugs I've tried from the top of my head - when I last counted the ones in my cabinet it was over 107:

I'm not expecting anything to come of this post. It's part rant, part hope. I just don't know what to do anymore. I've ordered some bovine-serum derived IGG as a last hail Mary supplement given that my IgM is low, but given that the above list has failed I don't have any expectations. 

I'm hoping maybe someone who recovered reads this and sees some kind of similarity, but I realise that is unlikely. 

I just want my life back. I have my own business which at times can be physically demanding and I don't know for how much longer I can do this.

Why had she done this again?

Well no. She knew why she'd done it. The Anemoi Cabin didnt have a Counsellor, which meant no one to speak for all _five_ of the cabins that called it home and no leader the members could go to when they needed something, and that was enough for Aubrey's (five minutes) older sibling instincts to kick in- so, Aubrey got started on preparing for her Cabin Meeting.

Right after the Counsellor Meeting. It was a bit awkward that that had happened before Cabin Meeting honestly.

On Saturday Evening using her wind powers, she slipped a piece of paper saying

**Cabin Meeting in Zephyrus Wing Tomorrow!!**

under all her Cabinmates' doors and got to work. The next morning, were the members of the Anemoi Cabin to assemble in the Zephyrus wing of their Cabin they'd find it to be pleasant as ever with the scent of freshly brewed coffee mixing and wafting with that of flowers and fruits with chairs and beanbags set up everywhere and a round table she'd borrowed from the Aeolus wing in the middle. Aubrey herself sat at the head, twirling her hair as she looked tapped her pen against the blank page of her notebook.

As people began to gather, Aubrey smiled, trying to hide and suppress just how nervous she was and managing with some success, looking like her usual cheerful self as she looked around the table.

""Hello everyone! Nice to see you all! I'm Aubrey, my dad's Notus and I'm your new Counsellor!"" She explained as she introduced herself ""I uh, thought we could use one since its been a while since we had one and‚Ä¶ I think I'm up to it!""

Aubrey grinned and waved her hands at the various assortment of snacks like cheeseballs and some baked goodies (courtesy of one Anthony Grizzle of the Demeter Cabin) and a whole bunch of different coffee drinks that Aubrey herself brewed.

""Please help yourself. Now‚Ä¶ Is there anything anyone needs or wants to address? I have some topics we can discuss, if you can't think of any yourself."" She continued, uncapping her pen as she looked around expectantly.

**The Topics:**

*   Is there anything you need?

*   Is there any dispute you need resolved?
    
*   Is there any Cabin you want to ally with?
    
*   Is there any activity you'd like to hold?
    
*   Any questions you have for me?

""Oh! and also, I'm gonna need a couple of us who can fly to help me out with a favour I owe the Horai Cabin, since Rex has agreed to ally with us so‚Ä¶ If anyone wants to volunteer for that, it'd be great!"" She added with a nervous smile. Maybe she should've asked this before she made the deal with Rex.

I sit here, watching the start of a new year of Bingo. I finished my card with about 24 hours to go, and now I've composed some thoughts: time to reminisce on the fifth full Bingo year I've done (and I suppose, less satisfying numerically, the eighth card). It's been a different year than the last few, I haven't had nearly the time or mental energy to do the big double card push I did for three years consecutively. I didn't even do all hard mode. Anyway, here's some minicomments on books and potential 2025 squares:

**First in a Series : Leviathan Wakes - James S. A. Corey**

**2025 Squares: Pirates?**

First in a series. Simple, classic square. Also a total trap. Look, I definitely was in a space where I just wanted to munch on a long series and this definitely let me do that. 

Leviathan Wakes is just a good solid blend of interesting science fiction in a well imagined mid-future of a colonized solar system, with good characters, grand mysteries, and a compelling plot. Also the start of a solid long series of the same. Not necessarily something I consider life-changingly excellent, but pretty damn good. 

**Alliterative Title : Warlords of the Wyrdwood - RJ Barker**

**2025 Squares: Gods and Pantheons, Impossible Places, Down with the System**

Gotta love some alliteration. Wasn't feeling inspired by any three word books and I did want to get around to this second Wyrdwood book at some point. 

A second installment in yet another metalless world from RJ Barker this time with huge trees and weird gas monsters and lots of fun fauna. Very reminiscent of the Edge Chronicles in a lot of ways. But darker. I think I want to like this series more than I do. The woods are interesting but the populated world is a lot less so and unfortunately the characters Barker chooses seem to consistently be detached from the fascinating (albeit deeply fucked) societies that make this world interesting. 

**Under the Surface : The Failures - Benjamin Liar:** 

**2025 Squares: Impossible Places**

Love weird underground stuff. 

A strange new debut about a world without light, and a giant mountain, and the machinations of various great and wise factions, also I guess a very strange portal fantasy subtheme. Large portions of the plot take place in a crumbling city deep within the Mountain, lots of fucked up losers and failures swirling around a strange lightless world.

**Criminals : Metal From Heaven - August Clarke**

**2025 Squares: Down With the System, LGBTQIA Protagonist**

My favorite kind of criminals: queer communist rebels. 

A fascinatingly stylized book. Told so viscerally from within the corporeality of its main character. The survivor of a workers riot and inheritor of a strange power that interacts with the magical metal that is driving industrialization. Plot and character can feel very slippery, as we are so viscerally within the fevered mind of Marney. I don't know what to say about the weird house full of the lesbians who will inherit the powers of industry

**Dreams : Starling House - Alix Harrow**

**2025 Squares : Parent Protagonist (in spirit)**

Probably the square that killed my desire to do a hard mode card. The most interesting part of dreams in fantasy is all the fun ways they can interact with the plot and magic. 

A fairly classic and simple kind of story. A spooky house with backstory. Ambiguous guardians of some dark secret hidden at its roots. A scrappy young protagonist and her brother scraping by after having fall through all too real cracks in the system, and maybe finding a place in this spooky house. Mildly annoying in the flavors of pat liberalism that suffuse it's perspective on small towns. All are pettily malicious unless they're oppressed in which case they're all fine allies. 

**Entitled Animals : The Last Unicorn - Peter S. Beagle**

**2025 Squares : Not a Book (if you watch the movie lol)**

The Last Unicorn goes on an adventure to find out where the other unicorns are, meets various characters and eventually finds herself in another form as she tries to figure out what the vaguely defined antagonist has actually done. I wanted to like this more than I did. It was good, don't get me wrong, but it never quite hit for me. I think this is a book that I'd need to read while fully relaxed on a vacation with little time pressures in order to fully appreciate. As it was, even as the book read over my morning coffee it never quite stuck. 

**Bards : Master of Poisons - Andrea Hairston**

**2025 Squares: Impossible Places, Down with the System, Pirates, Author of Color**

Not sure whether to count my completion as hard mode. Didn't, but it felt a little weird since a main character is literally the closest possible analogy to a bard in another culture: a griot. 

A fascinating African-inspired fantasy of ecological devastation. Powerful kings and priests are calling on great magics that sap power from and poison the earth, to protect themselves from the unravelling ecology. Many fascinating enclaves, and many harrowing trials that the characters survive in the hopes of eventually building something a little better. 

**Prologues and Epilogues : Melancholy of Untold History**

**2025 Squares: Gods and Pantheons, Author of Color**

I totally fell into this one. This book had really interesting and meaningful uses of prologue and definitely epilogue. 

Written by a history professor it's a fascinating book that describes itself, internally in a sense, as a fabulist history. It's a work of fiction and marketed somewhere on the border of lit-fic and spec-fic in the vein of things like Cloud Atlas and Cloud Cuckoo land with the nested narratives back and forth in time.

It's relatively short, and adopts a sort of clipped and distant tone that I associate with like books of folklore, dialogue isn't exactly the smooth and novelistically natural, but rather a bit abrupt and direct as is the narrative.

The most consistent through-narrative is a modern day narrative of a history professor in a modern day country that seems to be based on loosely East Asia, probably China, perhaps Korea, called the 'Grand Circle'. This professor is mostly dealing with middle aged grief and reminiscing over his own works which picked apart the historical narratives that had defined the layered dynasties of the country's history.

Those narratives then depict a sort of echoing fantastical and fabulized set of conflicts, rebellions, migrations etc that all seem to echo with the spirits of four mountain gods who we hear a founding myth about. But this founding myth is perhaps fabulation? But also the echoes echo even unto the present as the historian looks back.

**Self-Published or Indie Publisher - Everything For Everyone: An Oral History of the New York Commune.**

**2025 Squares: Indie Pub (now HM), Down with the System, Hidden Gem**

I'm a huge proponent of using small presses for this square. I just think the small press ecosystem feels more like a way to aspire to more interesting unheard voices. I kind wish the hard mode was not one that restricted us to relatively big ones in the way it is. 

¬†I and my work were definitely obliquely the villain about two blocks off page... and like fair. Anyway it is an imagined oral history of a communized New York with twelve interviews spanning from like 2052 to 2072. I sometimes lapse and say it interviews key figures in the revolutions/communization... but that's too simplistic. Frankly it takes pretty everyday and representative characters who are adjacent to the key themes it wants to imagine: planning, organizing, food distribution, dancing, love, the violent overthrow of worldwide oppression and the less violent versions thereof.

Really effective, I will be thinking about it for a long long time. Has adged in weird ways in only two years(most painful example for me personally: it was written in 2022 and the second chapter features someone participating in the liberation of the Levant, which is to say starting from Gaza...). But also it ends with a funny note on non-alarmist AI futurism.

**Romantasy : A Taste of Gold And Iron -¬†Alexandra Rowland**

**2025 Squares : LGBTQIA Protagonist, Generic Title, maybe High Fashion**

Good square to have, wish I'd liked the experience more. 

(1) I felt like the fantasy/political intrigue B-plot was interwoven in a way that weakened my ability to enjoy the romance plot. Mainly because there were several scenes where for the sake of the romance plot I absolutely wanted to be able to just soak in the internal pining/agonizing/overthinking of the MCs, but was unable to focus on this because for inscrutable reasons characters were treating life-and-death-crucial-urgent B-plot information as non-urgent seemingly just long enough to allow a romance plot banter/convo/internal monologue to go on for five pages. It was frustrating because it felt like there was an easy world where that info got passed, given relatively little pages time, and then we could settle into the more central romance stuff... but no. 

(2) I just have a constant low grade peeve at books like this where I feel like I'm supposed to cheer for the ooh-so-enlightened queernorm mercantile monarchy that claims to treat their servants like humans and we should cheer them because they're better than the patriarchal europe coded countries they are economically extorting. 

(3) Not sure if this is the biggest or the smallest but this ran into a lot of my pet peeves around the way gay physicality gets portrayed by not-gay-men authors in romance/romantic subplots. Biggest things being just... idk the author almost never being willing to acknowledge a person is/would be hard in a situation. I get that's sort of a spice level thing but it just makes lot of the physical description of encounters feel quite inauthentic. Also some stuff about the end state of two men ""having sex"" being a lot more of a negotiation of what exactly that means and the book seeming (though corrected later) to treat that as something with an unambiguous spontaneous meaning.

**Dark Academia : The Historian - Elise Kostova**

**2025 Squares: Epistolary**

I have this thing where I have a lot of exposure to actual academia and dark academia is a lot more about like, the undergrads, where I'm always fascinating by the professors

A  wonderfully atmospheric take on the Dracula mythos. Follows generations of scholars who find threads that they pull on that suggest Dracula is real. Many journeys through Eastern Europe from Istanbul to Greece and even then out to France layered throughout the twentieth century. On the one hand solidly dark academia, but on the other so deeply and keenly about the scholarly obsessions and pursuits. 

**Multi-POV : Wicked Problems - Max Gladstone**

**2025 Squares: Impossible Places, Gods and Pantheons (HM)**

The potentially penultimate book in the Craft Sequence, or at least in the big trilogy capping this current stage. This is the book we've been craving where suddenly the cast of protagonists and the many cities all get woven together into a massive world spanning plot to find out what the heck the eldritch beings from the deeps of space are doing, and what the villains on our planet are doing. Wild. Fun. Craft!

**Published in 2024 : Rakesfall - Vajra Chandrasekera**

**2025 Squares:  Author of Color, Impossible Places, Gods and Pantheons, Down with the System?**

Classic square

What the heck do I do to explain Rakesfall. Relatively short, but massively ambitious. This is a novel about reincarnation. Linked lives swirling around each other and intermixing and getting confused with each other on a rampage through time, worlds, genres, and narratives. It begins with a chorus/fandom/host of dead children commenting on an oddly meta documentary about young school children in probably-a-Sri-Lankan-village who themselves may be watching documentaries about the dead children, who then are engaged in lots of online fandom discussion of the show.

And that's just one little chunk. An introduction to two characters, or at least threads of character-like-things, a boy and girl named-at-least-for-now Annelid and Leveret, who then go rampaging out into the timelines and narratives of the rest of the book.

**Character with a Disability : An Unkindness of Ghosts**

**2025 Squares : Author of Color, Down with the System**

We're on a really fucked up generation ship. It seems unclear if the people in charge want to get anywhere or are just happy living as the upper class in a world they control. The main character is autism coded though never explicitly labelled, and is one of the best medical minds on the ship (in a very genuine feeling way, it's also just not something others do or are allowed to do, and this character has perservered in pursuing and hoarding this knowledge) and slowly unravels the mysteries her engineer mother left behind about the secrets of the ship.

**Published in the 1990s : Stations of the Tide**

**2025 Squares: Impossible Places, Down with the System**

Simple square, lucked into hard mode without thinking. 

A bureaucrat from a fascinatingly weird galactic empire searches for a criminal who has supposedly stolen forbidden technology on a planet that is about to flood with some massive cataclysmic cyclical tide that will temporarily rewrite the ecology of the planet. A many layered book with lots of nods to occultism and ideas of transformation and alchemy. A bit of the male gaze horniness, but not in the worst way, I suppose. Does seem to believe women are subjects rather than objects pretty consistently. 

**Orcs, Trolls, and Goblins - Oh My! : The Daughter‚Äôs War - Christopher Buehlman**

**2025 Squares: Maybe Biopunk?** 

Man it was so hard to find anything I found interesting here. 

This was good though. Very dark. A world beset by a deeply unsettling goblin horde. Something deeply alien and cunning in their portrayal. This is the war where the daughter's have to fight because the knights are all dead. But also we have giant murder crows this time so maybe that will help. 

**Space Opera : The All Consuming World - Cassandra Khaw**

**2025 Squares : Pirates? LGBTQIA Protagonist, Author of Color**

I feel like I like the idea of space opera more than most of the ones I actually read, and read fairly few that actually feel as operatic.

Honestly compares interestingly with the much-recently-buzzed Metal From Heaven. Similarly visceral prose, though more POV jumping, similarly angry lesbians cast though a little more fully imagined. A bit more unsatisfying in it's lack of really fleshing out and writing out a final arc or denouement. Very much ends on an ""and then we chose to fuck shit up. Fin."" Enjoyable. Ish. Not my favorite thing, interesting prose. Feels like something that could have been so much more though... idk?

**Author of Color : No Gods, No Monsters - Cadwell Turnbull**

**2025 Squares : Down with the System, Author of Color**

The masquerade breaks in an urban fantasy world. There is a sudden set of breaches wherein werewolves riot on the highway in Massachusetts. Fragmented almost short story snippets weave the reactions of various secret societies and communities and just sets of roommates to the breach, and to societies feverish desire to hush it up.

**Survival : Chain Gang All Stars - Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah**

**2025 Squares: Down with the System, Author of Color, LGBTQIA Protagonist**

A terrifying real feeling book in which the US Prison system gets turned into commercialized televised bloodsport. Visceral and effective, with a smattering of different perspectives on a system that is ultimately far less ridiculously far-fetched than it seems. One of the absolute highlights of the year for me. 

**Judge A Book By Its Cover - Gogmagog by Steve Bear and Jeff Noon**

**2025 Squares : Impossible Places, Gods and Pantheons**

A mysterious crotchety retired (ha) sailor in a world of many kinds of fairy-like people finds herself being asked to ferry a small child and her robot keeper upriver to the big city. The journey will take a day, but the catch is that the river is um... the ghost of a dragon? With different regions corresponding the dragons anatomy? And weird timey-wimey ness. Also the dragon ghost is sick? And there are mysteries and old wars and old dark forces at play. Very curious to see the next. 

**Set in a Small Town : The Other Valley - Alexander Scott Howard**

**2025 Squares: Impossible Places**

A melancholy and more literary book that still deftly plays with a blatantly speculative premise. A small town in an isolated valley (unclear if there is more beyond this valley in the world) that is bordered on the east and west by itself 20 years past and 20 years future. The core function of government is the maintenance of this border and the consideration of petitions to visit the neighboring towns. To see (literally, but not actually meet and speak to) a child you won't live to see grow up, or perhaps a reverse. 

The main character finds herself having observed a visit, wracked by what it might mean, and how that shapes her life. A fascinating book. Definitely a highlight

**Five SFF Short Stories : Her Body and Other Parties - Carmen Maria Machado**

**2025 Squares : Short Stories**

A series of visceral and mildly speculative stories that mostly border on horror and perhaps magical realism. More visceral in their unapologetic treatment of women's sexuality and corporeality than in violence, though there are certainly touches of that. Like any short story collection, some are better than others. I particularly enjoyed the first story about a woman and her ribbon, in a world where some women have mysterious ribbons around parts of their body... 

**Eldritch Creatures : Our Share of Night - Mariana Enriquez**

**Book Club or Readalong Book : The Wings Upon Her Back - Samantha Mills**

**2025: Gods And Pantheons, Down with the System**

A book that I liked, but really wanted to like more than I did. This fell somewhat afoul of my dislike of split timelines. It's a pretty compelling tale of abuse of brainwashing and cult behavior told via dual timelines in which a young girl joins and trains with the warrior sect of her city, and her much older self being stripped of her position for a petty kindness viewed as treason and joining with rebels who wish to make a kinder system not ruled by the cruel subsect she was part of. 

**Final Thoughts:**

While I maybe didn't have the space to go full hard mode or double up this year (we'll see how the coming year goes), I found Bingo once again just an incredible experience. Highlights were the West Passage, Everything for Everyone, Rakesfall, and Our Share of Night. ",7,1743973894.0,Fantasy,2,0.88,False
1jt4mlv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jt4mlv,Help me getting in shape,"Hi,

As the title says, please help me get in shape. I'm just ""down"" these days

I used to work out pre-Covid, 1-2x crossfit workouts and 1x run a week, but after Covid and after my baby was born I haven't been to the gym. I'm trying to run once a week lately, but believe me or not, I can't really devote more time to my body.

I really want to work out more, but realistically the most I can manage is 2-3 short home workouts in the evenings (around 10pm) and 1 run max weekly. Will this make any difference at all, should I start? I know I won't get a six pack, but if I were a little bit better in shape, that would be awesome. I would especially get rid of my barrel belly, that could also be genetic, since all my family has a similar body type - when I worked out more, I didn't have a flat stomach either. My arms/legs are quite thin, my upper body looks much more strong.

I am 170 cm, 67 kg, recently turned 40. Sleep 6-6.5 hours a day, don't smoke at all, drink alcohol only occasionally, try to avoid sugar and reduce bread/pasta consumption. Daily fluid intake is around 1.5 l (80% of which is tap water, 15%, 1% coffee, 4% other). I just uploaded some pictures of a random daily meal. Breakfast and dinner are usually the same and constant: a small amount of bread, cold cuts, veggies. Lunch: alternately ordered and home-cooked.

OP

I am a mess, literally upside down, and need some support and advice.

I feel like I have blown up my marriage and I don‚Äôt know what to do.  I [31F] been with my husband [28M] for five years and married for two.  He knew that I was poly from the start.  But after a bad relation with my previous partner, I was actually look for a monogamous relationship.  Before we married we had a long talk about my poly and I made it clear that at some point I would want to date others.  I also made it clear that I felt that a bunch of rules would do nothing but cause resentment.  He agreed, but he also made it clear that he was not into poly and didn‚Äôt plan on dating anyone else.  We decided to get married fully knowing that it might not be forever and we basically promised to try to work through what we could, but try be kind if it failed.  

Now some back story.  Sorry.  My previous relationship was open from the start.  But my ex-partner was very selfish and he believed that there were rules that applied only to me.  Basically he could date whoever he wanted and do whatever he wanted with them.  But he was very manipulative when it came to me.  He would demand I stopped seeing people on a whim to prove I loved him.  If I was uncomfortable with someone he dated he would make it seem like I was selfish.  In the end, it basically meant I could date or have relationships with his girlfriends.  But he would throw a fit over me seeing other men.  It was a very difficult relationship.  We never married, but we did have a daughter together.  

My ex is not in our life as he also turned out to be a deadbeat.  But my husband is nothing like him.  He is very self-confident.  He is a very successful lawyer and he has stepped in and been a great father to my daughter.  I couldn‚Äôt be happier with anyone else.  

I began to feel very comfortable in my relationship.  So comfortable that I thought it would be relatively safe to open up our marriage a bit.  Out anniversary was in December.  In February, I got the courage to talk to my husband about my desire to start seeing other people.  He was still adamant that he wouldn‚Äôt be looking for love anywhere else.  But he was very understanding about my needs.  He wasn‚Äôt excited about it though because he felt there were serious dangers in it.  Mostly, to do with my daughter.  We had been talking about him legally adopting her and he was worried about what would happen if we suddenly broke up.  I knew that it could cause issues with our marriage but I was very confident that we could weather any storm.  I really just thought that it would make me a better wife.  

I feel so dumb now.  But my husband seemed so supportive over most of the last seven months that when it all blew I was caught so very off guard.  I dated several people and entered into two serious relationships over the past seven months.  I was very honest with my husband about the relationships.  I left my phone unlocked and made it clear he could read through my text any time he wanted.  I also made it clear that if he was ever uncomfortable that he should tell me.  And if he had any questions he should ask me.  The thing is he never really did.  I have only had physical relationships with the two me. I entered relationships with.  They both knew that my husband was my primary and since both are also married it didn‚Äôt really matter to them.  

As it turns out, my husband was basically wearing a mask all these months.  From the start, and unbeknownst to me, he has been slowly detaching himself from me and my daughter. The way he did it was to start working more.  He basically through himself into his job.  Often, he would work late at the office and then come home and work most of the night.  

At first, I thought he was seeing someone else.  He would tell me he was just working for a chance to be a partner.  And it went on for so long that I started snooping around.  But there was no evidence of any other women.  In fact, I found evidence of him shutting down a coworker and then lying to his colleagues about why he had to go straight home or his wife would go crazy.  But in fact, I‚Äôd be the one out.  He had tape recordings of himself practicing for court.  So I was sure he was really chasing his partnership. 

Still I was a bit worried.  Our sex life had dropped to almost zero. And he would never initiate sex.  This was the scariest thing for me because previously he would initiate sex all the time.  My nick name for him is ‚Äúrabbit.‚Äù   In June I came to him and offered to close our marriage because I was worried that I was losing him.  But he assured me that we were doing great. And he said he wouldn‚Äôt be okay with me not being who I ‚Äúreally am‚Äù anymore.  He also assured me that it was all just related to his work and that after he became partner it would all be better.  

We had planned to visit my parents for the 4th of July in Wisconsin.  The tickets were bought and a hotel room was reserved.  Basically when we go my daughter stays with my parents and we stay at a hotel.  Well two weeks before the trip my husband sits me down and says that he can‚Äôt go because of work.  But instead of cancelling he thought we should still go.  Nothing unusual about that.  But he said that I should probably see if one of my boyfriends could go.  I was so shocked.   But he was so sincere and he gave me this long justification why he thought it was a good idea.  Basically he said that he felt as though I was keeping a secret from my friends and family and that there was no reason to be secretive about who I was.  Even told me it‚Äôd make him feel better about our marriage.  So like a dummy, I did take one of my boyfriends.  And there is a moment from that trip that keeps replaying in my mind.  The three of us were sitting on the plane and my daughter and boyfriend were playing and inside I had this heartbreaking feeling that it was all wrong.  The trip was very bad for me.  During the five days my husband had almost no communication with me. I would text him but he would only respond a few times a day and each time was very brief.  I called him several times, but he would never answer.  Instead, he would text me that he was busy.  Not even him typing but the auto responses.  I could tell be cause I would stare and never see him typing.  It was maddening.  I sent him a very long text at one point saying that if he was mad he should have told me instead of pushing for me to take my boyfriend.  His response was ‚Äúchill out, I‚Äôm not mad‚Äù.  

When I got back home, things only got worse.  All of a sudden he had to fly to New York for work.  Then he had to goto Detroit.  The. Back to New York. Then Miami.  I wanted to talk.  I wanted to fix it.  I told him I‚Äôd do anything to fix us.  And he told me there was nothing broke to fix.  That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs been all of August and all the way up till Monday.   Monday I was at work, ran out of my office to grab coffee for my team.  When I got back the secretary informed me that someone was waiting to see me.  When I went out to see, I got served divorce papers.  

Monday night all the truth came out.  He has been going crazy since February.  I thought he didn‚Äôt care.  Well as it turns out he has been reading all of my messages. He actually connected my iPhone to an iPad and has been reading every little message.  He didn‚Äôt want me to know. But he has created this false narrative in his head.  He has dissected offhand jokes into these ridiculous attacks on him.  He told me that he wanted to divorce me in February.   But he felt the best thing for us all was a slow unraveling.  And that‚Äôs what he has done. He literally says he wanted me to have someone to step right and take his spot.  

I‚Äôm so broken right now.  I‚Äôve pleaded with him to try. But he is so sure that our marriage is over.  It‚Äôs so heartbreaking.  I don‚Äôt know how much is him being good at wearing a mask or just me wanting him to be okay with it.  But it‚Äôs a real gut punch. I‚Äôve begged him to goto counseling and I‚Äôve stopped talking to the two men.  But he calls me silly for giving up on love so easily.  Which is like a dagger in the back.  I don‚Äôt know what to do.  ",2,1743973824.0,openmarriageregret,6,0.75,False

Our startup, a social e-commerce platform, was facing uncertainty and we needed to move fast. That's when we decided to launch an MVP to test the waters. What we learned in those early days has been instrumental in shaping our future success. Here's a key take-away: focus on solving a problem, not building a feature.

In our case, we identified a critical pain point in the e-commerce space ‚Äì difficulty in discovering new products. We created a simple, yet effective, feature that allowed users to easily search for products based on their preferences. The MVP was built in just three months, and it was a game-changer. We received valuable feedback from early adopters, which led to significant improvements in our product. The MVP also helped us secure funding from top-tier investors, who were impressed by our quick turnaround and willingness to listen.

My advice to fellow founders and investors is to prioritize building a solid MVP over perfecting a product. The benefits are numerous:

1. **Rapid iteration**: An MVP allows you to test assumptions quickly, making adjustments as needed.
2. **Alignment with customer needs**: By focusing on solving a problem, you'll ensure your product meets customer demands.
3. **Competitive advantage**: Early mover advantage is crucial in today's fast-paced market. An MVP enables you to gain traction before competitors do.

In our case, the MVP paved the way for a successful Series A funding round and set the stage for our product's continued growth. It's a valuable lesson I carry with me to this day ‚Äì a reminder that sometimes perfecting a product is less important than perfecting the problem it solves.",1,1743973416.0,u_Helpful_ruben,0,1.0,False

That‚Äôs not chonky. That‚Äôs pre-diabetic and assortment of health problems leading to a premature death.

These dogs already struggle with breathing and joint issues. Turning them into sausage-shaped balloons isn‚Äôt quirky ‚Äî it‚Äôs a slow health decline wrapped in cuteness. They shouldn‚Äôt look like they were poured into their skin and forgot to say ‚Äúwhen.‚Äù

I‚Äôm not saying your Frenchie needs to hit the gym and count macros, but if their neck is the same width as their waist, it might be time to reevaluate.

Love your dog. Keep them trim. And maybe stop feeding them half your charcuterie board. Also, a 15 minute walk around the neighborhood to do their business is not enough exercise. These are supposed to be athletic dogs, not adorable coffee tables.

1jt4eb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcritiques/comments/1jt4eb9/need_critiques_bad_this_is_for_school/,"Need critiques bad, this is for school!! :)","Andy stared blankly at the empty booth across from him. It had been at least two months since they planned this trip, and he wasn't so sure Calvin would show. It wasn‚Äôt the first time he‚Äôd been stood up. Andy‚Äôs demanding job left little free time, making things like this rare. He opened a pack of Marlboros and slumped into the bench, deciding whether or not he should call for the bill. Looking out the cloudy diner window, he studied the cars driving down the road. The conversations surrounding him faded into the background as he sank into deep thought, utterly unaware that Calvin had taken a seat across from him.



‚ÄúAndy?‚Äù Calvin tapped on the table to get his attention.



He whipped his head around and quickly put out his cigarette, ‚ÄúCalvin, man! You actually made it!‚Äù¬†¬†



Calvin let out a short laugh, ‚ÄúYeah, well, I wouldn't let you down. Considering you drove five some hours to be here.‚Äù¬†



Andy let out a relieved sigh, then reached over to put his hand on Calvin‚Äôs. But just as their hands touched, Calvin snatched his hand away frantically, subsequently checking for judgmental stares. He understood Calvin's anxiety, hell, you‚Äôd be crazy not to feel even a little paranoid doing what they were doing. Even knowing that, the rejection painfully stung. The waitress soon walked by with a pot of coffee, finally breaking the awkward silence.¬†



‚ÄúAre you boys set to order?‚Äù¬†¬†



‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ no, but thank you ma'am, we‚Äôre just on our way out.‚Äù Calvin politely waved her off.¬† ‚ÄúSuit yourselves,‚Äù she sassily quipped as she sauntered away to serve the next customers.



‚ÄúYou're choppin‚Äô at the bit to get outta here, huh?‚Äù Andy said

‚ÄúOh yeah‚Ä¶sorry,‚Äù Calvin scratched the back of his neck. ‚ÄúWere you uh, hungry or somethin'?‚Äù¬†¬†



Andy shrugged. ‚ÄúNot really. Just kinda figured we‚Äôd have more than five minutes to catch up, but I guess we got a whole weekend for that.‚Äù Calvin looked down at the floor and smiled, ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù



Wordlessly, the two gathered any of their belongings and shuffled out the door. Calvin retrieved his bags from his truck, double-checking that it was locked and parked safely behind the diner. Andy slid into his rust-bitten truck, the engine sputtering before finally turning over. He gripped the wheel, rested the side of his head against the window for a moment. Watching Calvin in the rearview mirror as he tossed his duffel into the truck bed. Calvin climbed into the passenger seat, exhaling sharply as he shut the door.

¬†

""You good to drive?"" he asked, his voice calmer now. Andy nodded.¬†

""Yeah."" He shifted the truck into gear and pulled onto the road. They still had a good few miles ahead.



‚ÄúSo, how‚Äôs the camp?‚Äù Calvin finally asked.

Andy exhaled, dragging a hand through his hair. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs, well, it‚Äôs fine. Long hours, cold mornings, trees. Not much else to say.‚Äù

Calvin happily nodded. ‚ÄúAnd the guys? They still just as bad?‚Äù

Andy smirked. ‚ÄúNothing new.‚Äù

¬†Calvin tapped his fingers against his knee, watching the world blur past in the window. ‚ÄúYeah, I figured,‚Äù Calvin said quietly, eyes still tracing the highway‚Äôs endless stretch. ‚ÄúHey, you ever thought about leaving? I mean, doing something different with your life?‚Äù

Andy had thought about it before‚Äî he was still working the same job after almost a decade. But something in him felt stunted after Calvin quit; strangely the job had become a source of sentimentality‚Äîa constant day-to-day reminder of their love. Or what was left of it at least. Leaving it behind felt like severing the last aspect of control to what they once had. Calvin didn't seem to mind any of this, but his paranoia is what ultimately drove them apart. That fear is why he moved hours away, why he stopped answering calls for weeks at a time, why their meetings had dwindled to rare, quick catch-ups like this one. Andy had tried to be patient, to understand, but watching Calvin try to heal from him like a virus had worn him down.¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know what else I‚Äôd do,‚Äù Andy responded, forcing a laugh after.

The conversation died down, mostly because there was not much else to be said that felt good enough to break the silence. Neither of them had felt like it anyway.

  


The difference between the air in the stuffy truck and the breezy mountain was immediately noticeable. The campsite was nestled deep in the woods, hidden by towering pine trees that slowly swayed in the wind. Gravel crunched under the tires as he pulled into the clearing.

Calvin stretched as soon as he stepped out, rolling his shoulders and taking in the view. ‚ÄúDamn,‚Äù he closed his eyes and breathed in deeply, ‚Äúforgot what fresh air smells like,‚Äù he muttered. Andy, on the other hand, was already set on getting the gear out and set up. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, help me get this stuff up to the camp spot before it starts gettin‚Äô dark.‚Äù Finally, they got to laugh and reminisce about old memories as they went about setting up. Calvin was different up here, slightly looser. Being isolated in nature, there's a liberation where you seem to subconsciously exist as you are.¬†



As the sun set, the faint hum of crickets grew.¬† The fire projected a faint warm glow onto them, and the trees became black silhouettes that slowly disappeared into complete darkness. Andy sat leaning back on his elbows, and Calvin sat just a couple of feet away, nervously fiddling with a half-empty pack of matches. Andy exhaled and tilted his head back, watching the stars appear. They seemed so lonely, all the way up there, far from anything living. Hesitantly, he moved closer to Calvin, just enough so that he could wrap his hands around him.¬†¬†

Calvin flinched and jerked away. His hands twitched like he might shove Andy back, but he froze before he could. Andy started to pull away, realizing his attempt was ill-considered. But before he could, Calvin let out a sharp breath and suddenly melted into him. He gripped the zippers of Andy‚Äôs jacket, it was like something in him had finally cracked. He started to let out short sobs and quietly muttered apologies between breaths.¬†

‚ÄúIt's okay, you‚Äôre okay,‚Äù Andy whispered as he held Calvin's head in his hands. The world seemed to close in around them, and for a while, neither of them spoke.¬†

‚ÄúI just don't wanna spend anymore of life wondering what it would be like with you around..‚Äù Calvin took a deep breath and made eye contact with Andy, It seemed like he was tyring to apologies for everything. The weight of those words settled in. It seemed this wasn‚Äôt the life either of them dreamed of.¬† They both knew this wasn‚Äôt ideal, but this was all they could have. Secrecy was the price they paid for love, and they now had to accept it.¬†

  
  


After a while, Andy dug into his pack and pulled out a small bundle wrapped in an old, faded plaid cloth. Inside were two wilting flower crowns, made from wildflowers he‚Äôd discreetly picked on his drive there. He knelt on one knee and cuffed one in his hands, raising it up to Calvin.¬†

¬†Calvin extended his hand to help him up, and then Andy placed the makeshift ring on his head. Calvin then took the other from Andy and put it atop his head. Calvin then extended his arm and finally brightly smiled.¬†

‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre dancing,‚Äù Calvin said.¬† ‚ÄúWhat else are you supposed to do after a wedding?‚Äù

Andy let out a laugh. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs no music.‚Äù

Calvin shrugged. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt mean we can't dance.‚Äù

They swayed slowly, guided by the distant chirp of crickets and the whisper of the wind in the trees. Here, in the protection of the wilderness, they weren‚Äôt hiding. Mother Nature comforted them after humanity's harsh rejection. In the quiet of the night, they stood together, pretending for just a moment that they were standing like any other newlywed couple, hands clasped, flower crowns perched on their heads.



‚ÄúThe preacher may never marry us, and my mama may never know you,‚Äù Andy murmured, his gaze meeting Calvin‚Äôs in the flickering light. ‚ÄúBut I can kiss you over a fire and dance with you under the stars. And if that isn‚Äôt marriage, I‚Äôm not sure what the hell else God is looking for.‚Äù¬†



The quietness that had seemed so unsettling earlier had now become full. Their bond needed no approval, didn't need it to thrive. It had and would exist for centuries in moments just like this, of rebellion and love.¬†

So a few days back, I‚Äôm sitting on my porch with my coffee at like 7AM. Then I see these 6 dudes (yup, all dudes as always) walking onto the beach completely naked. Then they start doing yoga. Full on naked yoga, bending and stretching right in front of our house. Then my wife steps outside, sees whats going on, and just walks right back inside and covers the curtains so our kids dont see it. Because were used to this stuff at this point. I‚Äôm sitting there like do I laugh? Do I call someone? Who the hell does naked yoga at 7AM on a public beach?

Then theres the dogs. Recently a pack of dogs has set up shop in the dunes across the street from our home (not even the cute kind, they just bark at everything). We called animal control and they did nothing and havent even shown up yet and its been over a week. Yesterday, one the dogs sprinted up to my kid while we‚Äôre heading to the car and ate the granola bar she was holding, barked at us, and ran off. My daughter was crying and I‚Äôm pretty sure the naked yoga weirdos or those bonfire teens are feeding them, cause these dogs are acting like they own the place & used to people. Now my wife and I are carrying brooms and bats just to get to our driveways.

Sorry this rant is getting long. But it gets worse and this is what pushed me over the edge today. Last night (saturday night), My wife and I are sleeping when this loud rumbling wakes us up at like 3AM. I looked outside our window that faces 5th street and there‚Äôs a freaking PORTA POTTY getting dragged down the street by a white SUV. Turns out some jackass‚Äôs (probably the same little shits who torched those xmas trees in january) cut it loose from wherever it was parked and tied it to their car.

We didn‚Äôt move here for this. But at least the city responded quickly to our call last night and almost has it cleaned up at this point. But jt smells like SEWAGE. Cops never came too.

Whats the deal with this beach? Is fifth street just the spot where all the crazies come to play? I wanted chill vibes and ocean air for my family, not whatever this is.

My mom (59F) is usually the only person I trust with my safety because my dad and I have a lot of issues.

The issue started because I was eating my food on the bed, since the dining table was fully occupied and I have trouble eating while holding my plate steady with my hand. We don't really have a sofa or a smaller coffee table where I could have kept my plate and eaten. My mom got frustrated when she saw my plate on the bed and started shouting at me. I explained my reasons and that sitting on the bed to eat was my only option. She didn't want to listen to that reasoning because she felt that I was only giving excuses and that eating on the bed makes it dirty.

She kept telling me that she doesn't care about these excuses and that no matter what, I shouldn't have eaten on the bed at all. Now this is where I might be the AH. I kept justifying my point to her until she finally got so angry that she threw the plate, which still had food on it, on the ground. I was really shocked and actually frozen for a few seconds because I didn't know how to react. I have never in my life physically frozen before. I felt blank.

She must have realized from my lack of reaction that something was wrong and then took a look at the plate she had thrown, finally seeing all the spilled food. She started saying that she didn't know that the plate still had food and that she hadn't meant to spill my food. Now, it must be noted that she might have genuinely not known because the plate was a completely covered one, and she couldn't see if there was anything in it. But it wasn't about the spilled food, it was about her reaction for me because I have never thrown stuff around in frustration. So her doing that scared me.

I got down and started cleaning up the food with her help. I threw it all away and then went to the bathroom to cry for about half an hour. She kept trying to apologize, saying that I should have listened to her and immediately removed the food from the bed so that this didn't happen. But I felt/am still feeling blank. I just told her ""I understand, I am sorry, this has already happened it's fine."", and am trying to ignore her.

Mom feels that I should have immediately listened to her instead of escalating the situation by arguing and causing her to throw the container. I felt that she was not understanding my point which is why I was over-justifying myself but I never meant to argue. AITAH for causing my mom to get frustrated enough to throw the plate, and with it my food, on the ground?

I am very blessed and grateful to my parents for getting me a car, I don‚Äôt want this to come off like I‚Äôm not thankful for the car as I know many aren‚Äôt able to have their first car be paid for them by their parents.

However, anything they buy for me is under the guise that that means they can use that against me.  All my life if they bought me something with their funds, it would mean they‚Äôd threaten to cut me off financially when we‚Äôd get into fights and other things. We don‚Äôt get along a lot of the time and they are very toxic so we do fight often. I knew when it was time for a car I had to tread carefully, as I knew they‚Äôd be saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúmy car‚Äù but use it against me and say it‚Äôs theirs and not mine. 

I get I didn‚Äôt pay for the car and on paper it‚Äôs theirs, however I am trying to drive places and learn after getting my license, and they keep taking the car to work leaving me stranded without a car to use. It‚Äôs very frustrating and just doesn‚Äôt give me any sort of independence in terms of driving. I may not be perfect at driving but I want to have the ability to go places slowly, and they both have their own cars too. Again, I am very grateful and understand it‚Äôs not technically my car, but they tell me consistently as if it‚Äôs my car but then use it against me later and I hate it. 

They also  make the car insanely dirty and leave their crap like old coffee cups that are filled, tissues and other things. I like a clean space and I honestly can‚Äôt stand the amount of trash they leave. I want my car to feel new when I drive it and it feels beat up because it‚Äôs left so dirty. It‚Äôs just really hard on me trying to establish some sort of independence as I live at home and I thought having my license and this car would help me gain some of that. It‚Äôs just so frustrating and I wish I was rich so that I wouldn‚Äôt have to rely on them. They are very narcissistic and manipulative a lot of the time when it comes to money. I didn‚Äôt ask to be their child or to be born, and they always make it a point to tell me that anytime they get me something they can take it back and cut me off‚Ä¶. Also because they pay for me a lot financially, they are expecting that same treatment from me once I‚Äôm older with a more stable job and when they want things when they are elderly and such. Little do they know I plan to live far away from them due to their mistreatment towards me as their child for many years. Can‚Äôt wait for me to be able to own my own car fully paid by myself.",0,1743973081.0,rant,1,0.43,False

‚ÄúProbably got caught up in work,‚Äù Briar said.

The captain of the Wild Hunt shot a glare at his subordinate. The master of thorns lounged on a branch halfway up the tree that had once been a foolhardy pair of monster hunters.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a shit. She needs this training. Not to mention she could show a little appreciation for the skills I‚Äôm teachin‚Äô her.‚Äù

Briar jumped from the tree, using his wings to slow his fall. Crossing his arms, he leaned next to a skull as he listened to his superior continue to rant.

‚ÄúProbably off with that Weeper woman. She‚Äôs lucky I don‚Äôt see that *caoineadh* as an actual threat. Should‚Äôve killed her after she finished singin‚Äô her song for puppydog.‚Äù He shook his head.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get why you‚Äôre so jealous of the Weeper,‚Äù Briar commented. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs becoming human, so her years just got numbered. She‚Äôll live what? Another fifty years, maybe? And in that line of work‚Ä¶‚Äù The wielder of thorns grinned. ‚ÄúAnd who‚Äôs to say what kind of trouble Orion might see in the coming years.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs that what ya think this is? Jealousy? Fucking spare me. I ain‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù He stopped. I ain‚Äôt jealous of no fuckin‚Äô *caoineadh*, was what he *wanted* to say. But the words wouldn‚Äôt come out of his mouth.

‚ÄúTrying to tell lies?‚Äù Briar laughed.

Iolo plucked a string on his banjo and a stone went whizzing past Briar‚Äôs ear. Briar only laughed more.

‚ÄúHer time will come. And then you‚Äôll get yours. But don‚Äôt push your puppydog away in the meantime.‚Äù

The Dragonfly began to play a melody, slow and melancholy, but harmless. ‚ÄúWhat? You some kind o‚Äô expert on courting now? ‚ÄòCause you and ol‚Äô blue eyes got a thing goin‚Äô? I hope you‚Äôre not spillin‚Äô any secrets in exchange for him lettin‚Äô you fuck him.‚Äù Iolo‚Äôs expression was calm, but anyone who knew him would see the restrained violence hidden behind his hazel eyes.

Thorns coiled and uncoiled in Briar‚Äôs gut. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt told him anything he hadn‚Äôt already figured out.‚Äù

‚ÄúMm.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll I‚Äôm saying is, you gotta lighten up on her a little. If you kill that Weeper, or cause her death, she‚Äôll hate you more than she already does. If you think she‚Äôs stubborn and mouthy now, she‚Äôll be ten times worse.‚Äù

Iolo only continued to pick at his instrument, the notes rising and falling in the cool night air. A grin slowly spread across his face.

‚ÄúOr is that what you want?‚Äù

‚ÄúBriar, you know as well as I do that it‚Äôs more fun when your quarry puts up a fight.‚Äù

Briar sighed. ‚ÄúSure. But you want to mold her, right? Turn her into a Hunter and have her ride at our side on Samhain. Making her angrier than she already is won‚Äôt earn her loyalty. Let her live with and enjoy the Weeper while it lasts, which might not even be for the span of the Weeper's life. Then when the Weeper‚Äôs gone, make your move. Hell, if you play it right, puppydog might even come running to you for comfort.‚Äù

Iolo snorted. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt actually believe that.‚Äù

He shrugged. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt believe the draugr would come to me willingly, and yet he did. Eventually. Whether or not your puppy will come to you will depend on how you treat her and her little fling.‚Äù

The captain continued to play, the tune becoming thoughtful. ‚ÄúYou really think she might come to me?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know how much pleasure you take in beating down your quarry. Of isolating them and running them down until they have no will left to fight. I do, too. But trust me when I say that luring them to you, having them question every ideal they‚Äôve ever held, is *far* more intoxicating.‚Äù

‚ÄúHm. I‚Äôll consider it. But there still ain‚Äôt no excuse for her avoiding her training! When she finally decides to show her pretty face, she‚Äôs gonna wish she‚Äôd skipped out altogether tonight.‚Äù

They both turned their attention to the footsteps crunching through the trees. A minute later, the topic of their conversation appeared, stopping short at the edge of the clearing. Her eyes widened as she read the tension in the atmosphere.

‚Äú‚ÄòBout time you fuckin‚Äô showed up! Do we need to have a talk about respectin‚Äô others‚Äô time?‚Äù Iolo asked her.

She scowled at him. ""I was *working*,‚Äù she spat back. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt exactly walk out in the middle of removing a transformed Housekeeper, can I?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah? And who were you workin‚Äô with? Sounds like someone who doesn‚Äôt know how to do the job.‚Äù

Briar sighed and rolled his eyes before shooting up out of the clearing. It wasn‚Äôt him that the rat catcher would be sparring with tonight, and he had no interest in listening to them bicker. Maybe someday his captain would learn how to court his quarry.

In the meantime, maybe the draugr would be interested in sharing a cup of coffee‚Ä¶",5,1743973040.0,atypicalpests,2,1.0,False

Now being in a relationship with him, I realise that it‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt really like him. He drinks a lot, his memory is suffering because of these already. He keeps on genuinely forgetting things that are important to me, he works out and is in a great shape but I think this is mostly the only thing he has going for himself.

When I look into the future I really don‚Äôt see myself trusting/counting on him and his decisions as a long life partner. I used to look forward to seeing him but now spending time with him has become hell. He hasn‚Äôt wronged me in anyway, he is still making long term  plans with me.

I want to make it very clear I have not read the book so I can‚Äôt judge its contents completely. I also am glad that the author survived cancer. However‚Ä¶in reading the back (you can see the full description on Amazon) there are a lot of choice phrases that both avoid claiming that tea cures or prevents cancer while still claiming this book is ‚Äúfor anyone battling the disease or for friends and family of those fighting cancer‚Äù and ‚Äúdrink tea to tell cancer to hit the road.‚Äù That sounds pretty definitive that you‚Äôre telling people who actively have cancer that tea will cure them. 

Basically the language to me is very sketchy and deceptive. On the back it calls tea ‚Äúone of the most studied anti-cancer plants‚Äù and talks about the author‚Äôs research on these studies. That in itself I don‚Äôt think would be awful, to essentially create a meta analysis of current cancer research that involves tea. Sure. But, surprise surprise, the author is not a scientist or doctor, she just owns a tea company. Red flags all around. 

After just googling I basically found what I thought‚Ä¶there‚Äôs some loose and spotty research that is not definitive about teas and cancer prevention or intervention. Like, web md even says straight up ‚Äú But more research in humans is needed before tea can be recommended as a cancer fighter.‚Äù

To me this book is just as damaging as other wellness huxters who sell supplements/food claiming they can actually cure real diseases. It makes me think of when my mom was dying (and did die) from cancer and her well-meaning friends were trying to get her to drink charcoal cleanses and aloe juice. 

All that is to say‚Ä¶I mean I doubt tea hurts anything and I actually only drink tea now vs. coffee because coffee makes me too anxious and gives me acid reflux. But still, I think it‚Äôs sheisty of the author to phrase the title of the book and market it this way.

Me (F35) recently divorced after 15 years together. Matched with guy (m30). We had great chats, met for coffee and two days later had a lunch date. Each time was great flow of interesting conversations. He was looking for something more serious while I was just thinking FWB. Note we are FB friends so I know no SO or funny business

Because of living situations (we both recently moved back in with family) we got a hotel this weekend.

Met for lunch, great two hour conversation, got to the room and had 3-4 rounds with cuddles and talks between. Then we went out for dinner and again flow was awesome. When we got back he wasn't able to preform, no big deal as I knew he's already came 3 times that day lol. I said let's just take a break and we laid there and the vibes just changed.

He was trying to work through a anxiety attack, finally he said he was having issues and didn't know what to do. I offered if he just need time for me to distract him or hold him? He said hold him and I did for while. He was still working through breathing and his muscles twitched at times.

Finally he said he thinks he just had to go. I kept it all light and said no problem and to drive safe. He got dressed in the dark kissed me goodbye a few times then kissed my forehead. As he left he said he would text me when he got home so I wouldn't worry. And he did. I said ""ok thanks"" and then ""I'd still like to talk when you get in a better headspace but if your no longer interested no hard feelings"".
I was really feeling insecure that it was something about me and his attraction to me. 


And haven't heard from him since. This is a super short relationship over two weeks, very new.

However I really like him. I want to support him however I can, so for now I just let him know that wasn't a dealbreaker and to give space? I think maybe it was obvious that I was genuinely into him and scared him off (I didn't say anything but I wasn't playing coy) He's been single 3 years and while hasn't said anything to show his feelings towards me I believe all his actions reflect care, respect and compassion towards me.

Any insight or thoughts on how to handle this? I feel like it's something about me that caused it but that's just my insecurities, logically I feel like it's him. I‚Äôm just worried he will be embarrassed and ghost me if it wasn‚Äôt about his attraction to me but his own stuff. 

Update: update I posted this on dating advice and they said my second text seemed like I was uninterested so today I just texted ‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôre doing ok today‚Äù.  No reply but he often takes an hour or so to text back. Not one to be glued to his phone ",1,1743972354.0,Anxiety,2,1.0,False

Here‚Äôs why I think this.","I grew up in the LDS faith in Utah.  I went on a 2 year ‚ÄúMormon mission‚Äù in west Texas.  I am no longer apart of the LDS faith or any other faith.  I believe there is a bigger picture to what we are doing here, I just don‚Äôt know what that is.

Enough of that so let‚Äôs get straight into it. 

I don‚Äôt want to go into details of the early LDS church.  Let‚Äôs just say it was started by Joseph Smith and ran mostly by power hungry perverts (Brigham Young) who, yes, wanted sex with dozens of women, but they also have a very strong and clear history of wanting power and control but not just control of their followers, but of the United States and possibly the world.  They also want a One World Government.  


This is writing from Brigham young himself.  Here is the link below.  The link will take you to writings of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young talking about how the LDS church will be the rulers in the last days. 

https://josephsmithfoundation.org/faqs/government/31-hang-by-a-thread

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_government_(Mormonism)
Here is another link for what the Mormons think about a One World Government.

But let‚Äôs focus on one specific paragraph from Brigham Young himself.

When the Constitution of the United States hangs, as it were, upon a single thread, they will have to call for the ‚ÄúMormon‚Äù elders to save it from utter destruction; and they will step forth and do it. 

The LDS not only teach it, but its members believe it whole heartedly.  It‚Äôs something members are anticipating.  That‚Äôs why Mormons are well known for being prepared with their food storage.  I lived in the culture and it‚Äôs apart of the culture to be ready for some kind of event.  Not saying all the members are nutty doomsday people.  But just very aware that one day our government will fall.

They also have their own ranches, food factories, food transportation.  They have everything to be self sufficient and so much more.  

When the government falls, they Mormons will be so well networked within themselves.  They have their own tv broadcast that can be broadcasted to members televisions as well as satellite dishes in virtually any city in the US as well as all over the world. 

I have seen it first hand in different places in the us.  It‚Äôs the same everywhere.  When it comes to being organized and ready to respond, the Mormons have it locked down.  

And don‚Äôt get me started on the members‚Ä¶

You see, the church leaders have always taught about the Law of Consecration.  But what is this law and why would this be worrisome of the government collapsed?

The law of consecration is a commandment in the Latter Day Saint movement in which adherents promise to dedicate their lives and material substance to the church. It was first referred to in 1831 by Joseph Smith.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_consecration

If the government collapsed, or a natural disaster hit and made everything shut down, the LDS church could ask all its members to give them their cars, houses, guns, skills, talents, business resources if you own a business, or even go to war for them, which Joseph Smith mentions in the first link I shared.  

These people believe whole heartedly in the doctrine they are taught.  They are a very dedicated to their faith and would do anything for the church.  And especially in ‚Äúend times‚Äù if the government fell, they would be scared and have the ‚Äúone true church‚Äù (as members believe) to look to in order to guide them on what to do next.  

Have you ever looked the amount of CIA/FBI Mormon members there are?  Mormons are very disciplined, many never having tried drugs, alcohol or even coffee and tea.  Very clean cut and trust worthy.  Perfect for keeping secrets, which they are already used to doing by going through the LDS temple, usually at the age of 18-19 but sometimes later.  That ceremony is copied from the ceremonies that the Freemasons do.  In this ceremony (which I have been through) they promise how they will follow the prophet above following the government.  God over government in the LDS faith.  

Now I have 2 theories.  

Either the LDS church has been co-opted from outside groups or entities who also want a One World Government.

Or

The LDS faith has stayed untouched but still with their want for a One World Government.  And they may have even infiltrated other groups themselves.

Either way, they want a one world government and if you look into the doctrine behind their doctrine, there is a lot of reasons to speculate that they have satanic based beliefs disguised as Christian beliefs which is what 99% of the members would be taught.  Much like the Freemasons and other church groups, the people at the bottom have no clue what they are apart of.

Hello everyone,

I‚Äôm 26 years old and have graduated from university. During my university years, I isolated myself to focus on self-development, and as soon as I graduated, I started working. I‚Äôm currently employed, but I have no friends or anything else meaningful in my life. My relationship with my family isn‚Äôt good either‚Äîwe talk for about five minutes every couple of weeks.

I thought I would make friends at work, but since I couldn‚Äôt find anyone on the same wavelength, it didn‚Äôt really work out. It‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt take the first step‚Äîmost of the time, I‚Äôm the one initiating‚Äîbut unfortunately, I rarely get a response. Right now, I don‚Äôt even have someone I can grab a coffee with or share my thoughts with.

I keep asking myself: people around me don‚Äôt seem to have solid plans for the future or even jobs, yet they seem happier than me‚Äîprobably because they have friends or supportive families. I tell myself this every morning: I‚Äôm working and earning money, but what‚Äôs the point if there‚Äôs no one to share it with?

Sometimes I want to spend money just to feel something, but I don‚Äôt even know what to do with it. I recently bought myself a nice computer‚Äîthat‚Äôs about it. I get really jealous when I see people laughing or hanging out with their friends over coffee.

I wanted to go somewhere for a short vacation during the holiday, but who would I go with? I have no one. I thought about visiting my family, but since things are strained, I didn‚Äôt go. At this point, I have no motivation for work, or even for living.

I feel embarrassed asking these kinds of questions at my age, but I have no one else to talk to, so I have no other option.

Now what I‚Äôm asking from you is: how can I accept this reality and continue with my life? I‚Äôm not looking for advice like ‚Äúyou can try making friends‚Äù because I‚Äôm tired of trying. I just want to learn how to come to terms with this and move on.

Every day I normally do about thirty minutes moderate intensity biking before doing a few ""sprints"" (high intensity intervals) at the end and then I measure my heart rate recovery. 

Today, on a whim, I stupidly decided to start directly with a sprint without even warming up. 

Not only that, I was in a quasi-fasted state (hadn't eaten in about 14 hours), hadn't drank much water, but had had a few cups of coffee.  

Anyways when I started I noticed it was taking longer than usual to get myself into the target heart rate zone for sprinting so I really pushed myself and was breathing heavily.  Anyway this ended up triggering a full blown panic attack.   I cancelled the rest of my workout and decided to skip it for today.

Needless to say in retrospect not warming up before sprinting was extremely stupid.  I thought that because I do sprints every day that my body would be ""used to it"" but I guess that's not the case.

1jt3q22,https://www.reddit.com/r/EMDR/comments/1jt3q22/what_you_expect/,What you expect,"I don't know how anybody else's emdr has gone, but I can honestly state that mine has been life changing and altering. Mentally, I am still drained but I'm getting back to a better base line. Physically I'm finally able to get out of my bed and perform basic tasks like taking a shower, making dinner or even food in general. I have been under going EMDR now since the middle of february. i was on suicide watch for at least three weeks, leading up to it. I went in for my first session, and I was finally at baseline and hungry. Weighing in at 110 pounds that day in february. That session was merely a session to get me to a baseline regulation. We did some more sessions where it brought me to a point to where I could actually process the main EMDR treatment. 

The first session was about 1 week ago. I'm on 2 now. I would like to put out into the ether, if you are wanting to do this, and you're finally to the point to where you're doing the hardcore, get it sessions. Take PTO!!!! I cannot stress that enough. You are going to get so much sleep. I ended up sleeping every night now between twelve and fourteen hours. I'm exhausted, but i'm able to actually get up and do work. I would advise to take this into consideration. The new brainwaves and solidarity of it all is amazing. Finally able to wake up in the morning and not have your ears ringing because of high blood pressure. Actually wanting to relax. Get up, go make coffee, whatever the case may be. Being able to actually relax is very alien to me, because I was in fight or flight mode for so long.. And putting into place boundaries with people already just after one session. It makes me feel like am I being controlling. Because being ""controlling"", before you are a tyrant, or you were some sort of horrible person telling somebody that this is what I would expect for boundaries, and expectations. That wasn't fair to the other person, but I had to respect their boundaries and expectations. But looking back on all of that now it's because they didn't have control growing up either, so they wanted to control the situation. Which is fine because now I wouldn't allow somebody to do that to me. Which is so weird because a co-worker tried to pull that kind of backlash boundaries and expectations on me. But I couldn't have that same boundary and expectation for other people. I pretty much said, hey, it's not fair.You don't want to follow my boundaries and expectations so I'm not going to follow yours. I wasn't being respected, so I refused to respect the other person. It's so funny whenever people think you're a nice person instead of a kind person. There is definitely a difference between the two. 

Another thing about e m d r, just after one hardcore session, I am finally able to see all puzzle pieces that I need to be putting back together. All of the shattered parts that I thought I kew of. Obviously I didn't, because now I can see everything so much more clearly. I'm finally able to give people explanations of why I don't like certain things, or why I do certain things in certain ways. It's because of past trauma and past abuse. But I can pinpoint it now to exactly where it came from, and exactly at what age, time frame..

I was finally able to tell my daughter why I don't like the rain. It was because the one safe haven, that I had. My dad burnt completely to the ground, and I was a prisoner every day that it rained inside my abusive household, and I wasn't able to run away to my safe haven. So after that I hated the rain. It was like I was cursed. Every time I found a place that I could go to. It was always taken away when it rained.. That was a memory unlocked, that's for sure. 

I can't wait until this tuesday for my second session. And if there is any advice that I could tell anybody to do beforehand it would be look up parts work and shadow work. Go through the intense talk therapy that I went through. Get all of the disgusting things up as much as you can, and as much as you can take. Whether it's past relationships,  experiences, situations.... Get it all out number it and process it as much as you possibly can. Don't push yourself to where I ended up pushing myself to. That was scary. And I do not highly recommend my pace to anyone. 

Good luck to everybody, that wants to do this. It is not for the faint of heart and it is definitely admirable to yourself. 

Much love ‚ù§Ô∏è

1jt3okt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Candida/comments/1jt3okt/help_me_convince_my_doctors_i_need_antifungals/,HELP ME convince my doctors I need antifungals! Tests are positive but doctors dismiss the results.,"Hi guys, i will try to keep it short and sweet. i have yet another hospital appointment **tomorrow, 7th apr**, and i will not let the opportunity slip away and actually try to make my doctors LISTEN instead of just hearing me and disregarding whatever i have to say.

i'm based in the UK but i am from EU. i've been struggling with candida for almost 3 years. in 2022, back home, i had endoscopy that said i had 'light fungal plaque' in my oesophagus but i wasn't given any medicine for it. after a while i started having symptoms like:

* **extremely smelly stools**
* **oily/loose stools, sometimes diarrhoea**
* **mucus (whit fluffy clumps) in stools**
* **thick layer of yellow/white film on tongue, kinda like cottage cheese**
* **fatigue after eating**

i documented everything. i had used my tongue scraper a year prior to developing the yellow tongue, so i know exactly how a healthy tongue should look like. i even have pictures of it before and after! i did pictures of the stool in all its weird forms and white mucus attached to it. i showed it to my docs and all i hear is - it is normal to have it. DUDE, I DID NOT HAVE IT BEFORE, SO HOW COME IT IS NORMAL NOW? I KNOW MY BODY! Infectious disease doctor said the same thing - normal. she was the most dismissive of them all. didn't feel like she listened to anything i was saying as if it would kill her pride.

in 2023 i had tongue swab - came back positive. i was put on a weak fluconazole dosage of 50mg for a few weeks - tongue remained white/yellow but the test came back negative. OF COURSE IT CAME BACK NEGATIVE CAUSE CANDIDA GROWS INSIDE THE CELL, NOT ONLY ON THE SURFACE! so this medicine killed only the top layer of candida but not everything. symptoms were persistent.

had another endoscopy and colonoscopy - in the uk. this time supposedly everything was good.

docs told me i might have sibo, so i did treatment for 3 months - nothing changed. then i stumbled upon the **'overcoming yeast infections'** by marjorie crandall somebody mentioned on this sub. it was GODSEND! guess what? i did the tests she recommended and they came back **POSIVITE**!

* **low white blood cell count?** check
* **low neutrophiles?** check
* **high candida antibodies in blood?** check (i did a test for antigen as well but it was negative)
* **stool fungal culture?** came back positive for Candida lusitaniae!

so i present these results to my UK docs. mind you, test were private, had to fly back home to do them, spent a lot of money overall just to hear the same old song: ***cAnDiDa iS a nOrMaL oRgAnIsm iN dE bOdyyy***.

i understend it is a commensal organism, yes. but some people, INCLUDING ME, have too much of it and it causes havoc in our bodies! their response? my stools are loose cause of a low faecal elastase (they did a test and it came back low) and if i would consider taking fat-breaking enzymes... BRO, I DON'T NEED TO TREAT THE **SYMPTOMS**, I NEED TO GET RID OF **THE ROOT CAUSE!** it's like saying to a patient with a brain tumour - take some paracetamol, so you don't have a headache instead of removing the tumour! stool could be fixed but will taking enzymes fix my white tongue??? i know once candida is out, the body will do its thing and will start functioning normally.

what i've done so far:

* **strict diet of meat with broccoli ONLY**. followed for 3 months. felt like sh... was very weak. it helped clearing out a tongue a bit and improved stool consistency but nothing major. i'm in need of something way stronger than that.
* **liver flush** \- two times! it helped removing all gallstones but probs nothing to do with candida
* **drank home-made kefir** and used kefir enema and nystatin enema for 2 months
* **coffee enema**
* **took frozen castor oil pills**
* **drank castor oil** (which resulted in excreting something, check my previous post with a pic!)
* **took turpentine oil**
* **10g of activated charcoal** with water for a few days - no impact

in the aforementioned book, dr. crandall mentions protocols that patients would need to follow to get rid of candida. in my situation, it sounds like the ideal protocol would consist of taking 200mg fluconazole (the max. dosage i had was only 50mg...) for a few months along with nystatin. she was studying candida for 30 years, so for sure she knows what she's talking about! unfortunately, western medicine is not interested at all in candida and doctors have no clue how serious it is!

fellow guys of reddit, **could you please help me convince my doctors to prescribe me the medicines i need**? i could go back home and pay for it but it's thousands of pounds! i live and pay taxes in the uk, so it would cost me roughly ¬£10 to buy everything on the NHS.

what are the steps i could take to sound convincing? would writing an official complaint letter to the hospital management help? i'm not making anything up, i have proof, i have medical evidence, positive test results, before and after pictures (healthy tongue vs candida tongue, mucus in stool etc.) i am running out of ideas...

***as a side note, if you are in the uk (or anywhere in europe) and know any mycologist that takes patients seriously - please let me know in dms! :)***

1jt3lvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dcl/comments/1jt3lvs/thanks_to_the_community_for_helping_me_prepare_a/,Thanks to the community for helping me prepare + a brief review,"Took my first ever cruise last week on the Treasure (2 adults no kids), and wanted to say thanks to the community for all the great tips and such that helped me make it successful. Because I did so much research and reading here I wanted to share some things that were better and worse than anticipated based off what I had read to hopefully help future sailors.

**Better than expected:**¬†  
**Dining timing** \- ran like clockwork at a tight 75 minutes, nothing was cold, perfect service  
**Service in general** \- thought it would be great and was even better than anticipated  
**Moana** \- see above  
**Room quality** \- also see above  
**Children** \- I was trying to have a child-free vacation, and I thought I would find the kids annoying, but they are so joyful that it's infectious. Far fewer meltdowns than at the parks, imo.  
**Shopping**¬†\- wasn't expecting much here but found some harder to get items!  
**Classic cocktails** \- had the best old fashioned of life at the Cove Cafe thanks to Nikola (ask for rum and cold brew), and the dirty vodka martini at the Rose was also great.  
**Marvel shows** \- loud but not as intrusive as expected, do bring hearing protection if you are sensitive though  
**Enchante** \- Fully on par with French Laundry. Pro tip: the 10 course menu is identical for both lunch and dinner, just minus the cheese course at lunch. In exchange, you get the great views because it's daytime. Do not look at the menu online, you want the 10 course that isn't fully listed. Can easily translate to gluten-free with few modifications, I am sure they can accommodate any allergy but I don't know how that would change the experience.  
**Logistics/Elevators** \- very easy, no backups  
**Gluten-free churro waffle** \- no idea how they do that  
And finally, a personal victory - it was a choppy sailing most days and I didn‚Äôt feel sick at all. I'm someone who mostly can't do thrill rides, so I was very happy about this discovery.  
  
**Worse than expected:**¬†  
**Most specialty mixed drinks** \- I counted that I tried 10 and only one of those was even good (the Creme de la creme at Scat Cat). Stick to classics or beer/wine which was excellent.¬†  
**Pool access/comfort** \- I think we were able to get in a pool once, and a hot tub never. Also the adult seating/lounging situation is dire.¬†Would be fixed by making the Chip N Dale area also adult-only.  
**Coffee** \- thought it would be bad and was terrible. We brought great instant coffee and it saved us most mornings.   
**Availability of adult entertainment** \- Sage and Coriander had one show all sailing and then there was Match Your Mate 2x. Other than that it was live music, which I enjoyed. Just felt like the adult offerings were a bit thin, and not a priority for DCL.¬†   
**Gluten free safety/labeling** \- I really wanted allergen labeling at Marceline's and FF. I got SO SICK of asking about every last thing, and finally just stopped. Was having a mild reaction for most of the trip. However, dinner was always perfect, and breakfast/lunches in 1923 were as well.  
**Palo** \- Mid-tier Italian. Good, but not exciting except for the excellent wine menu. No clue why people rave about this one.  
**Coco dining -** It's not even hard to do Mexican food well, so I thought, 'how bad can it be?' LOL  
**Castaway snorkeling** \- take the boat tour if you can get it, there are few fish in the bay, and who snorkels to see a statue?¬†  
**Walking deck access** \- constantly closed off possibly b/c it was choppy and the walking deck has stairs, yet the stairs by the pools further up were always open, so who knows. I just wanted to walk around the boat some and this should be easy.¬†  
**Tour of the boat** \- nice enough, but I wanted any easter eggs or BTS content and it was lacking both.  
And finally, **Incomprehensible content if you‚Äôre not a Disney fan** \- my kids aged out of the Disney years right after Moana, and didn't kick in until Brave, so there are huge swaths of movies/shows that I just never saw.¬†Nothing in Marvel made any sense, Coco was hard to follow, and Choose Wisely was really well received in the room, but I was confused AF. I thought the entertainment would be more accessible, but it felt really inside baseball. My experience at Moana was really helped by knowing the movie, and I imagine all of this would have been the same.  
  
And I guess this brings me to my TL;DR - I thought that this cruise would succeed as a cruise, separate from Disney, and in many ways it absolutely did. But the value here is if you either have young children or are a superfan. I will absolutely cruise again, and I had a great time on this trip, but as someone who thinks Disney is just OK, I don't know that the cost/benefit ratio makes sense for me.

But maybe about 15 minutes after the date, I went back to the dating app and saw that he had unmatched me.

However, we got a bit of a late start so we couldn't go to one of our regular diners because the wait was like an hour and we didn't want to wait quite that long. 
We finally found a nice little diner that we had seen on Google and thought we'd give it a try. 

It wasn't quite as busy as the other restaurants but was very nice on the inside and smelled good when we walked in. They seated us right away, nothing special took place. 

We sat and waitress asked us what we wanted to drink, hubby politely  says ""I think I'll have some coffee, hon would you like some?"" I reply ""yes, that sounds good.""  
We start checking out the menu....

A few moments later the waitress returns, we weren't really looking at her bc we were concentrating on the menu, she SLAMS the coffee cups and pot on the table! Which took us aback quite a bit. We were confused about what was happening here. She didn't say a word and walked off. 

She came back 20 sec later demanding whether we were ready to order with a stern face and bad attitude. We weren't, but hubby was concerned about her behavior so he had me order while he hurried and picked something. 

She was so rude to us. From the lack of communication, to the look on her face while she was dealing with us, to just giving us the cold shoulder the entire time we were there. 

We tried to just let it go and enjoy our meal, but as we were having our breakfast we began to notice how overly nice she was to all her other tables. They even got ice water with their coffee, which we did not and was not even offered. She is also chatting, smiling and having nice conversation with these other tables. 

Meanwhile, she won't even speak to us. Did not bring us our food or anything else for that matter. 

I'm not sure what the issue could have been. 

We are very nice people. We aren't rude to anyone and usually tip quite well, but after this disastrous meal we only left $1. 

I will be leaving a review for the restaurant bc I always do, but was wondering if anyone else had any insight as to wtf just happened. 
Have you had this happen to you? 
Why?

This was completely unprovoked and she wasn't so busy she just didn't have the time bc that's what hubby and I originally thought when this all began, but after watching more closely to what was happening in the restaurant we decided that wasn't the problem.

(For clarity, I've worked in restaurants my entire life, and hubby and I even ran one for a couple of years so we know the business fairly well)

I‚Äôve got longish dark brown hair usually in a bun, glasses, a beard, some tattoos, and piercings if that paints a picture. 5‚Äô8‚Äù, 220 lbs, warm vibes.

I‚Äôd love to find someone local who wants to hang out often ‚Äì hit up coffee shops, explore new spots around the city, have cozy nights with good food and music, maybe get lost in a record store or park. If we vibe and something romantic blooms, awesome ‚Äì if we just become close friends, that‚Äôs just as good.

If you‚Äôre in or near Pittsburgh and any of this resonates with you, drop me a message. Let‚Äôs get to know each other and see where it goes.

1jt3fsa,https://youtu.be/dVjrgNeo_Eo?si=vHfcHewkcduVdNPw&t=167,Recording of my conlang Ghalzhii ‚Äî 2nd excerpt from my audiobook,"

This is a continuation from my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/s/XzndFXOSVN).

It‚Äôs a long one, but I‚Äôm pretty happy with how it turned out.  It takes place in a sort of refugee settlement which Ghouls from various regions have been corralled into, so I had fun fleshing out the accents and speech patterns in a couple new characters.  The prologue revealed a little of the Ghouls' insecto-mammalian biology, and this one gets a little more into their culture, as well as their place in the world at large‚Äîwhat they call their *kozmix* (/kozmiks/) in Ghalzhii.

The link should take you straight to the first conversation at [2:47](https://youtu.be/dVjrgNeo_Eo?si=vHfcHewkcduVdNPw&t=167), then there's a couple more lines around [7:35](https://youtu.be/dVjrgNeo_Eo?si=32D6qU-SgkTS5bWp&t=455), and the final and longest convo is at [9:25](https://youtu.be/dVjrgNeo_Eo?si=r936WPm8u0ZioRpU&t=565) (links are also among the transcriptions below).

That previous post was the prologue and this is chapter 8, so if you want more narrative context, here's the book's playlist:  
[https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHK9boQ3UsiW51LLgbxXHpG2V24gETf0e&si=AAxJ2yl2TM5Cuc0Q](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHK9boQ3UsiW51LLgbxXHpG2V24gETf0e&si=AAxJ2yl2TM5Cuc0Q)

(The other chapters might have sprinklings of Ghalzhii vocab, and a couple lines of the Goblin language Go√ªbd√°ling (/go ïbd√°Àêli≈ã/) here and there, but not enough to have made a whole post about.)

I plan to keep posting any chapters that have Ghalzhii dialogue as they release on YouTube, so look out for those.



Here‚Äôs the transcript with IPA, gloss, and translations:

How can my wife be so oblivious?  I've been sugaring for years.  I'm dying to get caught so she can initiate a divorce because I don't have the balls to talk to her, but even with zero OpSec she's still not catching on.

In a world where dick is free, how does a young chad find a sugar momma?

Does this [Insert any obvious scam] sound like a scam to you?

Anybody else from Wichita?

Is it just me, or is the racism off the charts with these men?  Obviously it's not my personality/body shape/style/findom post history.

Is it customary to get paid for doing my hair and meeting somebody for coffee?

Would anybody be up for a sugar mixer in Wichita?

Septum ring: will it ruin my chances?

Cocaine: will it ruin my septum?

Is there anybody in Kansas City that would be willing to meet up halfway between there and Wichita?

Should we all band together and develop an alternative to Seeking?  We can improve the quality of people on the site by inviting everybody from Reddit.

So I have a upcoming meeting with my gynecologist to see if the antibiotics cleared everything up from a little Chlamydia mishap.  He's a doctor and has kind of a George Clooney look.  How do I go about broaching the idea of a sugar arrangement when I see him?

Do I need to pay my SB extra allowance while on vacation? Also, does anybody know if The Great Wolf Lodge has late checkout?

Is anybody else worried about telling their future partner that they dated a guy that was successful and made taking care of them and provided for them?  I'm concerned that being honest about sugar dating will ruin my chances with low-income guys.

My SB is bringing her mom to the M&G - do I bring a gift for both of them, or only if we all end up at the hotel?

This guy and I agreed on a great allowance.  Should I ask for a raise on the M&G, or only after we are intimate.

To nip or not to nip: should I wear the dress that highlights my perfectly perfect nipples?

To nip or not to nip: should I explore a vasectomy?

Is there any chance I get a good cup of coffee grinding with my Timemore C2 and brewing with a V60? I want to save myself from days of frustration getting bad results and the feeling of just wasting coffee. 

From what I've read my plan is to grind coarser than I normally do, reduce agitation (just one pour) and use hot water.

I‚Äôm into deep convos, music, movies, video games, cooking, animals, and probably way too much weed (but hey, I‚Äôm chill about it ‚Äì not a personality trait). I‚Äôve got longish dark brown hair usually in a bun, glasses, a beard, some tattoos, and piercings if that paints a picture. 5‚Äô8‚Äù, 220 lbs, warm vibes.

I‚Äôd love to find someone local who wants to hang out often ‚Äì hit up coffee shops, explore new spots around the city, have cozy nights with good food and music, maybe get lost in a record store or park. If we vibe and something romantic blooms, awesome ‚Äì if we just become close friends, that‚Äôs just as good.

If you‚Äôre in or near Pittsburgh and any of this resonates with you, drop me a message. Let‚Äôs get to know each other and see where it goes.
