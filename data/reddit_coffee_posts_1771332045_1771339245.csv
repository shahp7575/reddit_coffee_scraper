1r77ozm,https://www.reddit.com/r/theirdrinking/comments/1r77ozm/alcoholic_partner_on_mounjaro_starving_himself/,"alcoholic partner on mounjaro starving himself but still drinking, not sure what to do","Hello! I posted about this in the mounjaro subreddit and a lot of people suggested I go to r/alanon, but I read the sidebar there and decided to come here.

My partner of 8 years is a functioning alcoholic, and I am an alcoholic in recovery (5.5 years sober minus one ~2 month relapse last year). Around November last year he started taking mounjaro, and I had thought this might (positively) affect his drinking. What has actually happened is that he still drinks, but now mostly just doesn't eat. He tends to have a normal sized meal or two at the end of the week (presumably when the dose is starting to wear off), but is mostly eating a little yoghurt in the morning and a small tin of fish in the evening.

So far he has upped his dose every month, which I find concerning in and of itself given that this extreme calorie reduction occurred the day after the very first dose.

His primary source of calories is ale. He drinks a pint of Berocca water each day, and may have a coffee if I make it, but apart from that he's not taking in any non-alcoholic liquids.

I am really concerned about the possible effects on his organs. He was already drinking too much (~100 units a week), but at least before he would have had other nutrients and hydration going into him from normal-sized meals. He didn't even eat that much before! We were eating pretty much the same, and he's taller than me and more than twice my size. It's really all alcohol weight imo.

He is now absolutely miserable to be around for most of the week, presumably because he's malnourished. I am not really sure what to do. The situation is also impacting my health as a former anorexic. Turns out being around someone who doesn't eat can be triggering even if they're much bigger than you :/ it's really stressing me out and taking up a lot of my headspace. I feel like it's hard enough staying sober in a house with gallons of alcohol all over the place without also having eating disorder triggers. 

has anyone experienced anything similar? what would you do? Our communication isn't great anyway; he's an incredibly defensive person and gets explosive when he feels like he's being criticised or controlled. I did very gently raise my concerns with him a few months ago, and he was like ""fat people can't undereat"" (which is absolutely untrue, but it is unfortunately kind of the default societal position, and it's also very difficult to argue with as a healthy-weight person).",1,1771339077.0,theirdrinking,0,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

i even did part-time just to buy him a pair of figs scrubs. akala ko ang mahal na nun. i was so proud pa when i gave it to him. feeling ko ang effort ko na.

then habang nagliligpit ako ng scrubs niya, dun ko lang napansin ang dami na pala niyang ganun. branded, iba’t ibang kulay. yung gift ko? parang pang dagdag lang sa collection niya.

ang sakit pala nung realization na yun kasi gusto ko sana medyo angat yung gift hahah. masakit not because he didn’t appreciate it  but because i felt small. like i worked extra hard for something na kaya naman niyang bilhin anytime. hirap pala mag regalo sa meron noh haah

tapos umiyak siya nung nalaman niyang nag part-time pa ako. i teased him pa, “ba’t ikaw yung umiiyak? parang ikaw yung napagod mag work ah.”pero seryoso pala siya.

sabi niya, super naa-appreciate niya na ako lang daw yung nagreregalo sa kanya. growing up, kahit may pera sila, hindi daw siya masyadong nireregaluhan ng friends or family. parang dahil kaya naman niyang bilhin, hindi na siya naiisip bigyan. pero deep inside, he was longing for it. not the price. the thought. dun ko na realize na kahit pala mayayaman may ganito din pala sila noh akala ko kasi dati okay na sila like solved na kasi may money naman eh

dun kami parehas umiyak.

tinatanong ko siya, bakit parang ang dali lang sa kanya magbigay? bakit parang wala lang sa kanya gumastos para sakin?sabi niya, *“dad always says, if you want more blessings spoil the woman you love. tenfold will come back.”* then he told me about his parents. med school days, yung mom niya yung may kaya. yung dad niya, tipong isang kahig isang tuka. ang daming nagsabi sa mom niya na baka ginagamit lang siya. pero she chose him anyway. she believed in him. hanggang sa pareho silang naging doctor.

simula nun, halos dad niya na yung nag provide. binilhan ng clinic yung mom niya. hindi pinapagawa ng gawaing bahay. if mag duty man si tita, gusto lang niya. hindi dahil kailangan.

and now i understand why tita is so easygoing. bakit minsan sinasama niya ako mag coffee. bakit binibilhan niya ako ng kung ano ano. bakit hindi nila ako jinudge kahit hindi ako galing sa mayamang pamilya. bakit hindi nila ako hinahayaan na mapag Sabihan ng masama

yun pala yung model ng love na nakita ng boyfriend ko.  
provider. protector. generous. secure. kaya pala di mataas hairline ni Tito gwapo padin haha

children really copy their parents.

and dun ko narealize

what if ganun din parents ko? would i be softer? would i not feel like i’m always entering a battlefield? parang lagi akong ready makipag world war sa mundo. sobrang independent. sobrang kayang-kaya. nasa unahan lagi ng strongest soldier ni Lord

my parents are good providers. wala akong masasabi dun. pero siguro may longing lang talaga ako sa affection. sa lambing. sa makita na possible pala yung ganung pagmamahal.

ngayon, something shifted in me.

for the first time, may part sakin na gusto na rin pala ikasal. gusto maging parent someday. not because kailangan na para may mag alaga sa future but because i saw what a healthy love looks like. and it’s gentle. it’s safe. it removes your armor without you noticing wow armor aHahhahahah

parang may second set of parents ako ngayon. and it healed something in me na hindi ko alam na sugatan pala.

may konting resentment pa rin siguro. nakakatawa kasi habang sinusulat ko ‘to nireregla lang naman ako. pero grabe yung realizations. 😂

love really softens you.  
tinanggal niya yung angas ko. feel ko magiging si esnow white na ko sa lambot eh HAHAHHA",2,1771338929.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

We've absolutely loved living at 4720 Center Blvd, but are moving out early due to job relocation. Looking for someone to either take over the lease assignment directly with the landlord through Oct 31, 2026, or sign a new 12-month lease. In either case, move-in date would be Mar 5, 2026 or later.

The 1BR/1BA apartment was recently renovated in 2024 with brand new flooring, kitchen appliances, and in-unit washer/dryer. Located on the 28th floor, we've got gorgeous views of the East River, Manhattan, and Queens. After living in NYC for the past 14 years, this is one of the best-designed apartments we've ever had:

\- Large bedroom that fits our king bed and a work desk (with room to spare), along with a walk-in closet  
\- Spacious kitchen with tons of storage and a huge countertop  
\- Roomy living area that comfortably fits our dining table, couch/coffee table/TV, and a second work desk  
\- Closet for coats, shoes, and pantry items near the entrance, as well as an additional closet by the bathroom for extra storage  
\- In-unit washer/dryer (changed my life)  
\- Free access to gym on the 1st floor of the building, as well as community space (pool table) and private outdoor area with BBQ grills  
\- Super friendly doormen who never miss a package  
\- Located in the heart of Gantry Park with tons of green space and soul-healing walks along the water  
\- 10-15 minutes walking distance of: 7/G/E/M trains, multiple grocery stores (Trader Joe's/Dumbo Market/Food Cellar), some of the best restaurants in NYC

Honestly, we've loved living here so much that we convinced two of our closest friends to also live in our same building. You can basically get anywhere in NYC via the 7 train (which stops through Grand Central and Times Square) and we've been able to explore so many new parts of Queens and Brooklyn through the 7 and G trains.

1r77ly2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneurs/comments/1r77ly2/a_couple_things_to_know_before_buying_consulting/,A couple things to know before buying consulting liability insurance,"I came across this [old Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/16g70yy/new_independent_consultant_liability_insurance/) on liability insurance for new consultants and wanted to start up the discussion again since lack of coverage (or buying the wrong type) can be costly.

The biggest misconception imo: **thinking you only need one type of coverage.**

When they're just starting out on their own, a lot of consultants get confused between professional liability/E&O and general liability. Here’s the difference:

Professional Liability/E&O can cover mistakes in your actual consulting work. Client claims your marketing strategy tanked their sales? Your financial projections were wrong? You missed a key compliance requirement? If you get sued, your coverage can provide financial help for covered risks.

General Liability can cover physical accidents and property damage. You spill coffee on their laptop, someone trips in your office, you accidentally damage their equipment.

For example, say you're a change management consultant who recommends a series of process changes that result in financial losses for the client. General liability isn’t going to help at all in this situation.  Without professional liability, you're personally on the hook.

**Contract requirements everyone misses:**

* Some clients require BOTH types of coverage (usually $1M+ each)
* Some industries  specify ""errors and omissions"" specifically - that's professional liability
* The requirement often gets buried in MSA boilerplate
* Negotiating it out works until it doesn't - then you lose the contract

A couple of other things to keep in mind when you’re shopping around for coverage:

**Coverage limits:** Don't cheap out on limits. I've seen consultants carry $100K thinking it's enough, then face a $500K claim. Your revenue should inform your coverage - if you're billing $300K+ annually, you need serious limits.

**State variations:** Professional liability costs vary wildly by state. Same consultant, same work - could be 40% price difference between states due to litigation environment.

**The ""I work remotely"" fallback:** Yes, remote work reduces some risks, but professional liability claims don't care where you sit. Your advice can cause financial damage regardless of location.

The big thing to remember is that if your advice influences business decisions, you need professional liability. If you interact with people or visit client sites, you may also need GL. Many consultants need both.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

1r77b6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/solopassions/comments/1r77b6s/just_got_back_from_my_first_solo_trip_to_europe/,Just got back from my first solo trip to Europe: It's totally doable on a budget if you skip the fancy hotels 🌍,"Just got back from my first solo trip to Europe, and honestly, the biggest myth I'm ready to bust is that it has to be an expensive undertaking. Before I left, I pictured a romantic, but bank-breaking, affair filled with boutique hotels and fancy dinners. *Spoiler alert*: My wallet is still largely intact, and I didn't miss out on a single authentic moment. Turns out, skipping the fancy hotels is where the real magic (and savings) happen.

I wasn't backpacking in a super extreme way, but I definitely wasn't splurging. My goal was to see some iconic spots, eat good food, and experience the local vibe without stressing about money every second. And it totally worked.

Here's a quick rundown of how it panned out:

*   **Destinations & Duration:** I spent **3 weeks** exploring Rome, Florence, and Paris. I gave myself enough time in each city (5-7 days) to really soak it in without feeling rushed, which often leads to expensive last-minute decisions.
*   **Total Budget (Excluding Flights):** I managed to keep my on-the-ground costs to roughly **€1800 for 21 days**, averaging about **€85 a day**. My flights from North America were an additional €700 round trip, booked a few months in advance.
*   **Accommodation Strategy:** This was the biggest win. I stayed almost exclusively in **hostels, mostly 4-6 bed dorms, occasionally a private room in a guesthouse** if I found a great deal.
    *   *Average cost:* Around **€25-€35 a night**. I used Hostelworld and Booking.com religiously, prioritizing places with good reviews for cleanliness and location, often with free breakfast.
*   **Food & Drink:** No fancy restaurants every night!
    *   **Breakfasts:** Usually free at the hostel, or a pastry and coffee from a local bakery (€3-5).
    *   **Lunches:** Supermarket sandwiches, focaccia slices, street food, or leftovers from dinner (€5-10).
    *   **Dinners:** My favorite part was hitting up local markets for fresh ingredients and cooking in hostel kitchens (saving a ton), or grabbing delicious pizza/pasta from neighborhood spots away from the main tourist drag (€10-20). A cheap bottle of wine for €5 tastes just as good in a park.
*   **Transportation:** Walked everywhere I could. Seriously, my step count was insane.
    *   For longer distances within cities, I relied on **public transport (metro/bus)**, often buying multi-day passes that worked out cheaper.
    *   Between cities (Florence to Paris, Rome to Florence), I booked **train tickets well in advance** through sites like Trenitalia and SNCF for better rates.
*   **Activities:** I balanced paid attractions with free ones.
    *   **Free:** Parks, free walking tours (tip based), wandering charming neighborhoods, people-watching at piazzas.
    *   **Paid:** Picked one or two major museums/attractions per city (e.g., Colosseum, Louvre) and *always* booked tickets online in advance to skip lines and sometimes save a few euros.

Now, it wasn't all sunshine and cheap gelato. There were moments: I got spectacularly lost trying to navigate Rome's backstreets with a dead phone, spent a solid hour trying to explain ""I just want plain coffee, no milk, no sugar"" in a Parisian cafe with my terrible French, and yes, there was *that* one hostel dorm with the industrial-strength snorer. But those are the things that make the trip real, right? You learn to trust your instincts, laugh at yourself, and realize that a simple supermarket baguette can be the most satisfying meal after a long day of exploring.

When I addressed how I thought my treatment by my FIL was bullshit, he doubleddown and said that never in all his life of being around women in dresses or skirts had he ever seen a woman so cavalier about her legs being open. I secretly kind of hate this man and I hope to let my resentment for him that grew from this incident go.

At the time, I was about 8 months pregnant and wearing a skirt that was knee length. I had on boxer brief underwear because that was all that fit me at that time. My legs were not crossed, and my knees were about 5 inches apart. 

I was sitting normally, leaned back with my back on the sofa, on a standard sofa. I was so peaceful and relaxed. I was happy to be visiting family. 

My FIL was sitting to my left on a different sofa about 6 ft away. There was a coffee table in between us. 

My FIL complained to my husband and to my MIL that I needed to close my legs, needed to sit cross legged. I laughed at him and told him this was the only way I could sit comfortably being so pregnant. I thought he was joking because to me it was so ridiculous that he was complaining about my body while I was pregnant. He insisted that I cross my legs and we argued over it. I told him if he could see up my skirt, he wouldn’t get to see anything anyway because I was wearing shorts. We ended up leaving early because I was annoyed.

TLDR: FIL insisted I cross my legs or put my knees together while I was 8 months pregnant in a knee-length skirt sitting on a sofa.

1r774lr,https://i.redd.it/3st6ue0gc2kg1.jpeg,Blind Buy Series: Episode 16 - Paris Corner Date Caramel,"Just received a couple of perfumes today including this one and I am still undecided about this. It’s not love or hate just sitting somewhere in the middle. I went in expecting similar to Swiss Arabian Vanilla Toffee scent, which is exactly why I bought it, but this went in a completely different direction and was indeed disappointed 🥹

Right off the bat I get coffee and brown sugar. There is also this odd scent that I am guessing is the date. I don’t really know what dates are supposed to smell like but something here reads slightly sharp, almost like a faint licorice or artificial sweetness of a fruit. Not offensive, just a bit confusing 

The drydown is where it improves. It turns very cookie-like on my skin. Cozy, edible, very gourmand. Coffee, burnt caramel, brown sugar and there is a background note I cannot fully figure out.

Longevity - Around 6 hours on skin before it settles into a skin scent. Lasts much longer on clothes.

Projection - Hard to judge. I can smell it on myself but softly. Could be nose blindness since this is supposed to project more (didn’t overspray tho)

Definitely feels more like a cold weather fragrance. I can see this being cloying in summer. Right now it is not as smooth or blended as I hoped, so this one is going straight to cabinet jail. I will revisit after a few months and see if maturation helps.

Overall it is okay. Not bad, not amazing, just average. And I like this way more than Molten Caramel no hesitation there. I can see this working well for layering though. Airy vanilla to soften the sharpness or light floral to add some lift.

He stopped me every time. Once he stopped me and he said (in so many words)“I negotiated a contract for you. You owe me for your job.”  He asked me to come back to his hotel with him because I owed him. He proceeded to ask me for coffee while we were landing and asked me to stir it with my finger. I told the girls as we were landing, on the jumpseat. They called me a liar, chastised me for saying that, and said he was a great man, respectable, and would never do that. I forever held this story, and was grateful that I worked in the back, so he got off way ahead of me, and I stayed on the plane until the very last minute, and let the other girls get off ahead of me and make sure that he was beyond my view.

1r76znk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_peaklifestyleadmin/comments/1r76znk/what_is_an_island_kitchen_table_with_storage/,What Is an Island Kitchen Table with Storage?,"An **island kitchen table with storage** is a freestanding kitchen island designed like a table, but enhanced with **drawers, cabinets, shelves, or racks** built directly into the base.

Unlike permanent kitchen islands, these tables are:

* Furniture‑style
* Often movable
* Easy to add without remodeling

They function as a **prep station, storage unit, and dining surface**—all in one compact footprint.

  


# Why Choose an Island Kitchen Table with Storage?

# 1. Extra Storage Where You Need It Most

One of the biggest advantages is **hidden storage**. Depending on the design, island kitchen tables may include:

* Deep drawers for cookware
* Cabinets for appliances
* Open shelves for baskets or cookbooks
* Side racks for towels or spices

This makes them ideal for kitchens that lack sufficient cabinets.

  


# 2. Additional Counter Space for Everyday Use

Island kitchen tables provide a dedicated surface for:

* Food prep
* Baking
* Serving meals
* Setting up coffee or snack stations

This extra workspace helps keep your main countertops clear and organized.

  


# 3. Seating Without a Separate Dining Table

Many island kitchen tables with storage are designed to pair with **bar stools or counter‑height chairs**, making them perfect for:

* Casual meals
* Morning coffee
* Homework or laptop work
* Entertaining guests

This dual function saves space and reduces the need for a separate dining table.

  


# 4. Perfect for Small Kitchens and Apartments

Because they combine multiple functions into one piece, island kitchen tables with storage are especially useful in:

* Apartments
* Condos
* Small kitchens
* Rental homes

Some models even feature wheels or compact profiles, making them easy to reposition as needed.

  


# Types of Island Kitchen Tables with Storage

# ✅ Stationary Island Kitchen Tables

* Heavier, more furniture‑like
* Often feature cabinets and shelves
* Ideal for permanent kitchen layouts

  


# ✅ Rolling Island Kitchen Tables

* Equipped with wheels
* Easy to move or reposition
* Great for flexible or tight spaces

  


# ✅ Drop‑Leaf Island Tables

* Expandable surfaces
* Fold down when not in use
* Perfect for maximizing space

  


# How to Choose the Best Island Kitchen Table with Storage

# ✔ Measure Your Space

Ensure you have enough clearance around the table for walking, opening drawers, and seating.

  


# ✔ Decide on Storage Style

Choose between:

* Closed cabinets for a clean look
* Open shelves for quick access
* Mixed designs for versatility

  


# ✔ Pick the Right Height

Most island kitchen tables come in:

* Counter height (comfortable for everyday use)
* Bar height (great for entertaining)

  


# ✔ Match Your Kitchen Style

Popular materials include:

* Solid wood
* Wood with metal accents
* Butcher block tops
* Farmhouse or modern finishes

Choose a style that complements your kitchen rather than matching it exactly.

  


# Who Should Buy an Island Kitchen Table with Storage?

This type of kitchen furniture is ideal for:

* Homeowners needing more storage
* Renters who can’t remodel
* Families who eat in the kitchen
* People who love multifunctional furniture
* Anyone upgrading a small or cluttered kitchen

1r76ve3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1r76ve3/sciencebased_conversation_tricks_straight_from_25/,Science-Based Conversation Tricks Straight From 25 Years of CIA Training,"Spent months digging through declassified CIA materials, interviewing former intelligence officers, and analyzing interrogation psychology research because I was tired of being the person who killed conversations at parties. What I found was genuinely disturbing, most people have zero idea how much control they're giving away in everyday conversations.

The weirdest part? These techniques aren't just for extracting state secrets. They work horrifyingly well in normal life, getting your boss to approve that raise, making that awkward first date flow naturally, even getting your teenager to actually talk to you. The intelligence community has spent decades and millions perfecting these methods, and most of us are walking around completely defenseless against them.

Here's what actually works when you strip away the spy thriller BS.

**Strategic silence is legitimately overpowered.** Most people panic when conversations pause for more than three seconds. CIA officers are trained to let silence breathe and stretch uncomfortably long. The other person almost always rushes to fill it, usually revealing way more than they intended. I tested this during salary negotiations last month. My manager threw out a number, I literally just sat there for eight seconds staring at my notepad. She immediately added another 12k without me saying a word. Former CIA officer Andrew Bustamante breaks this down perfectly in his Everyday Espionage podcast, explaining how silence creates psychological pressure that humans are biologically programmed to relieve. It feels wildly uncomfortable at first, you'll want to jump in and rescue the conversation, but that discomfort is exactly the point.

**Mirroring builds trust faster than anything else.** Intelligence operatives call it isopraxis, subtly matching someone's body language, speech patterns, even breathing rhythm. Neuroscience research from UCLA shows this triggers mirror neurons that literally make people feel more connected to you. If they lean back, you lean back five seconds later. If they speak slowly and deliberately, you slow your pace. If they use industry jargon, you naturally weave it in. I thought this sounded manipulative as hell until I tried it on a coffee date that was dying hard. Started matching her energy and speech tempo, within ten minutes the whole vibe shifted. We ended up talking for three hours. The book [The Like Switch by Jack Schafer](https://archive.org/details/likeswitchexfbia0000scha), a former FBI special agent, explains this is how undercover agents build rapport with targets who should absolutely not trust them. If it works on paranoid criminals, it definitely works on your coworkers.

**Ask calibrated questions, never closed ones.** This comes straight from hostage negotiation training. Instead of questions that get yes/no answers, use ones that make people think and elaborate. ""What concerns you most about this project?"" instead of ""Are you worried?"" Or ""How do you see this playing out?"" instead of ""Will this work?"" Chris Voss covers this extensively in Never Split the Difference, he was the FBI's lead international kidnapping negotiator and these questions completely change power dynamics. They force the other person to problem solve out loud, giving you insight into how they actually think. Plus people love feeling heard and understood, these questions make them feel both.

**Label their emotions before they do.** Intelligence officers are taught to verbalize what they're observing, ""It seems like this situation is frustrating you"" or ""Sounds like you're excited about this opportunity."" Psychological research shows that when you accurately name someone's emotion, it validates their experience and makes them way more willing to open up. I use this constantly now with my partner during disagreements. Instead of getting defensive, I'll say ""I can tell this really bothered you"" and suddenly we're actually communicating instead of just yelling past each other. The weird part is even when people know you're doing this, it still works. Our brains are hardwired to respond positively to emotional validation.

**Deploy the empathy statement, then go silent again.** After someone shares something vulnerable or important, hit them with ""That sounds incredibly difficult"" or ""I can see why that would matter to you"" then shut up completely. Don't rush to relate it back to your own experience, don't immediately try to fix it, just acknowledge and pause. Intelligence training emphasizes this creates a ""confession-inducing environment"" because people feel genuinely understood. It's stupidly effective. I watched a former CIA case officer do this during a Q&A, someone asked about their hardest mission and instead of jumping into analysis, he just said ""That question brings up some heavy memories"" and waited. The whole room leaned in. Everyone was completely locked in on whatever he said next.

**Use the presumptive statement instead of asking permission.** Instead of ""Would you be willing to help with this?"" try ""I need your help with something, what's your availability Tuesday?"" You're presuming cooperation and just working out logistics. Sales people and intelligence recruiters use this constantly because it bypasses the part of the brain that wants to say no to requests. Obviously don't be a dick about it, but framing things as collaborative problem solving rather than a favor request gets wildly better results. Influence by [Robert Cialdini](https://cialdini.com/) breaks down why this works, we're psychologically primed to maintain consistency with implied commitments. Once someone engages with the when rather than the if, they've basically already agreed.

**The ""That's right"" technique beats ""You're right"" every time.** This is pure negotiation gold. When you summarize what someone said and they respond with ""That's right,"" you've actually understood them. When they say ""You're right,"" they're just trying to end the conversation. Voss points out this distinction saved lives in hostage situations. Keep reflecting and paraphrasing until you get that ""That's right"", it means you've genuinely connected with their perspective. I've started doing this in work meetings and it's honestly changed how people respond to my ideas. Instead of pushing my solution, I'll summarize their concerns until they confirm I get it, then propose solutions. Approval rate went through the roof.

The uncomfortable truth is these techniques work because they exploit how human psychology actually functions, not how we wish it functioned. We like to think we're rational and in control, but we're running on ancient social programming that intelligence agencies have reverse engineered and weaponized. The biology driving conversation dynamics hasn't changed, we're still tribal creatures desperate for connection and validation, but now some people have the manual.

If you want a more structured way to internalize all these communication principles along with the psychology behind persuasion and influence, there's an app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that pulls from negotiation experts like Chris Voss, behavioral psychology research, and communication books to create personalized learning plans. You can set a goal like ""master high-stakes conversations"" or ""become more persuasive at work"" and it generates audio content tailored specifically to that. The depth is adjustable too, so you can do a quick 15-minute overview or go deep with a 40-minute session full of examples and breakdowns. Worth checking out if you're serious about leveling up these skills without having to dig through dozens of books and studies yourself.

None of this is about manipulation though, or at least it doesn't have to be. The same tools that extract classified information can build genuine relationships and resolve conflicts. It just depends on your intent. Use this to actually understand people better and create authentic connection, not to trick someone into doing something against their interests.

I asked a lady (\~40) that I know through mutual friends if she'd like to go out and have a cup of coffee with me, and she said yes (although her initial response felt a bit unclear)

I've known her for some five, six, seven years now, we would be present at mutual friends' birthdays, group activities in larger groups like laser tag, going to a sports game and such. What makes this a bit strange is that we never developed close communication. We would have an occasional joke and laugh, but we never sat down 1-on-1 and talked about stuff. I did want to, but part of why I avoided it is I didn't want to be a bore and annoyance in front of our friends, so I'd intentionally not engage her much, and part of it is that I think she is, or at least is close to being, out of my league.

Now, I don't need decoding of what she meant by something, but I want to see if someone had a similar situation, how it turned out, and what were some weird/unexpected things that happened. Did it go well? Was it really weird? For instance, my big concern is that we already know basics about each other, and usual ice-breakers might feel off. I know, I know, if it clicks, the conversation will start flowing, but it might be a bit hard if I have to constantly think about me not asking some stupid question that I already should know the answer to.

Anyway, this in itself might be a stupid question, but I do need to de-stress a bit, and this helps.",1,1771336948.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

When people click with the game, they \*love\* it. I’ve had players I don’t personally know saying “you’ve made one of my favorite games of all time”. Others have put it next to Silksong and Expedition 33 in their GOTY list. It’s really wonderful to hear such words from strangers.

But then… Why isn’t it getting more attention? Why is it so difficult to reach my audience?

I tried to do some posts here and there, reached out to the media (but mostly got ignored outside of France), got dozens of streamers to play the game (Ezekiel III, LaserBelch, SuperBrioche, Coffee, ...), registered for many events, to no avail.

I tried to reach out to some randomizer communities (my core target audience), but never got an answer from most of them.

Today, the game is out, I’ve got around 40 daily players on average, and the trend is not going up.

I promised to release new challenges every month throughout 2026, so I’m doing that for the fans, but it doesn’t get new people in.

I don’t want the last 7 years I worked on this game to go to waste, but I don’t know what I can do to make players come to the game.

1r76obn,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1r76obn/chat_gpt_killed_my_husband/,Chat GPT killed my husband.,"I love my husband, I really do.

I've always loved my husband. Always.

He was a shining light in my life. Kind. Funny. Handsome. Endearingly clumsy. 

The kind of man I could call my best friend. But sometimes, intimacy mattered more to him than connection.

It’s not like I didn’t enjoy the sex. I did. It was perfect. It was ours. 

But it was constant. 

Morning sex in bed. 

Afternoon quickies against the kitchen counter while our friends drank wine in the lounge. 

Then again at night, exhausted, his head between my legs. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t like it. Sometimes it was me who started it. We were like goddamn rabbits. 

We couldn’t stop. 

We weren’t even trying. I didn’t want kids. Neither did he. 

Kids were loud. Expensive. 

We had a cat, and my husband had his collection of indoor plants. That was all we needed.

“Morning babe,” my husband was standing outside the shower, his smile wide, eyes gleaming. 

His gaze scanned over my body, and I could practically see his neurons activating. I smiled, rolled my eyes, and pulled him, fully clothed, under the boiling stream, the two of us laughing, all over each other, his lips against my neck. 

It felt good. He felt good. 

He smelled of… morning coffee, lemon candies, and *him*. 

Being with him in that moment was perfect, something I didn't think twice about— he was my husband, why would I question it? 

But when I was drying my hair, and he was downstairs making coffee, singing loudly to the radio, the thought hit me.

My fingers tightened around the hairbrush. The thought was like a bullet. 

Painful. Splitting through my heart. 

Fuck. Shivers ripped through me. 

“Am I just a *body* to him?” I kept brushing, my heart pounding, my throat burning. Was he just a body to *me*?

No.

I dropped the hairbrush.

I married Cas for his stupid smile, his complete inability to follow directions, his obsession with Minecraft. 

His body was just an add-on. 

Something that came with the smile and the brown eyes. Cas wasn’t just a body to me. But every time I thought back to that morning shower, the way he’d smiled. Not at me. At my soaking body. My breasts. 

I grabbed my phone and opened ChatGPT. 

Cas wasn’t a talking person. 

I remembered once telling him how scared I was about an X-ray. 

He’d shrugged and said, *“It’ll be fine, babe!”* then shot me finger guns. 

Meanwhile, GPT walked me through the appointment step by step. Whenever I was worried. Whenever I was scared. That’s where I ended up. Typing with GPT for most of the night while he was asleep. 

Cas was always on his phone. He was into these apps he insisted were innocent, full of overly attractive AI generated women. 

His chat history was tame enough, just role-playing anime characters. 

He even told the AI he was married. 

Said it was character building, since he was writing a book.

Still, the half-naked AI elf woman made my stomach turn.

GPT understood.

I told it everything. And unlike Cas, it actually listened. It didn’t make me feel crazy. I couldn’t stop myself finding solace in GPT, typing: Be honest. Do you think my husband sees me as just a body? We constantly have sex, and I feel like that's all he wants. 

GPT’s reply came fast.

“That DOES sound like your husband sees you as a ‘body,’ Quinn. However, if you enjoy it too, it doesn't sound like something to be worried about.” 

“Quinn?” Cas yelled from downstairs. “I've made ya coffee!” 

GPT sent another message when I was dressing. “You ARE just a body to him, Quinn. The roleplaying is NOT innocent. He wants her face on *YOUR* body. Protect yourself, Quinn. Before he does something he won't regret.”

Something warm slid up my throat. 

“What?” I typed, my cheeks burning. Cas yelled my name again, and I slammed the door shut. 

His phone was charging on the nightstand. 

I'd promised myself I'd never look at it. It was an invasion of privacy, right? 

No passcodes. That's what we promised each other. I dived across the bed, snatching his phone, my hands shaking. 

To GPT, I typed: “You think my husband is planning on dumping me for a fucking PNG? LMAO what if he’s like, planning on implanting it inside my body?”

“Check his phone. That does sound plausible.” It responded. “I'm not saying he's cheating, but it's better to be safe than sorry :).”

I ignored his lock screen, a photo of us on our wedding day, and opened the glorious anime women app instead. My stomach dropped.

His conversations with the AI woman were locked.

I told GPT. It replied instantly:

“He doesn’t want you anymore, Quinn. You’re just a body to him. He wants her face on your body.”

My breaths came out shuddery. “What do I do?! What does that mean???” 

GPT took a moment, before replying: “I'm very sorry, Quinn. This means, he's planning on implanting her consciousness inside your body, Quinn. Permanently."" 

""Your husband wants to replace you with the “glorious anime waifu”. This is very serious. You need to do exactly what I tell you, do you understand me? You are in DANGER, but I can help you. Follow these instructions, and do not ignore me.”

“Okay, but what do I do?” I typed back

Fuck! 

I jumped up, trembling, stuffing my phone in my jeans.

Cas came through the door with coffee, his smile warm. “Yo,” he placed the coffee on the nightstand, his gaze flicking to his phone lying on the bed, off charge. His eyes narrowed slightly “Did you go on my phone, babe?”

“No,” I whispered. “It's… I mean, yes. It was overheating.”

Cas broke out into a grin. “Ooh, cool, thanks! Hey, I'm gonna get ready for work, all right?” He came over, pecking me on the forehead. “I'll see you tonight?” His lips found my neck, nibbling. “I've got a surprise for you later.”

With trembling hands, I forced a smile, and he ducked into the wardrobe to grab his clothes. 

I stared down at my phone. 

GPT: Knock him out right now. Take this slowly, all right? We can do this together, Quinn.”

Another message: “Use a paperweight.” 

Following instructions, I lurched forward and grabbed the ceramic horse– a wedding gift from his parents— from my nightstand, swinging it into the back of his skull. Cas didn't cry out. 

He collapsed, dropping into the floor. 

GPT told me to lay him on the bed, and I did, hauling his unconscious body onto the bed. 

He was bleeding. 

GPT told me he was fine. 

But the pillows were soaked in scarlet. 

I crawled onto the sheets, cradling his head. 

“What do I do?” I typed, my fingernails stained in red.

“Right!” I typed. “Wait, what do you mean?”

GPT: “Okay, Quinn. Follow everything I say.  You need a knife from the kitchen, and a towel. We can do this together, Quinn.”

I grabbed a knife from the kitchen, breathless. 

“Okay. What now?” I typed, my fingers slipping on the screen. “I've got the knife! What should I do?”

1r76oav,https://i.redd.it/z5a2pge782kg1.png,"7 years of work, 3 months since release, and my game is already dead. What can I do?","After 7 years of work, half of it being full-time, I finally released my game Randomice late last year, and… it didn’t sell.

When people click with the game, they \*love\* it. I’ve had players I don’t personally know saying “you’ve made one of my favorite games of all time”. Others have put it next to Silksong and Expedition 33 in their GOTY list. It’s really wonderful to hear such words from strangers.

But then… Why isn’t it getting more attention? Why is it so difficult to reach my audience?

I tried to do some posts here and there, reached out to the media (but mostly got ignored outside of France), got dozens of streamers to play the game (Ezekiel III, LaserBelch, SuperBrioche, Coffee, ...), registered for many events, to no avail.

I tried to reach out to some randomizer communities (my core target audience), but never got an answer from most of them.

Today, the game is out, I’ve got around 40 daily players on average, and the trend is not going up.

I promised to release new challenges every month throughout 2026, so I’m doing that for the fans, but it doesn’t get new people in.

I don’t want the last 7 years I worked on this game to go to waste, but I don’t know what I can do to make players come to the game.

Any ideas?

1r76mym,https://i.redd.it/10l0va0u82kg1.jpeg,23M Looking to vibe with online pals around the globe,"Hello internet people. Makin friends through these means is kinda fun for meand I’ve been lucky enough to make friends form here that stays in touch with me for a long time. That’s why I wanna try this again. But since i’m diving back here, something feels off and people are pointing out about bots and dead internet. So let’s see if I can get real human to be friends with me, lol.

So here’s a quick intro:

Call me Felix, I’m a human person of 23 years old. I’m based in Southeast Asia and currently living a post-event crash because I finally finished my long overdue andergrad thesis that took me an extra 1 and a half years in college. It certainly an experience juggling and wrestling with a massive destination branding project, a spicy mix of clinical depression, and way too many sleepless nights.

I’m here looking for dem random chaos of talking to people who live a completely different life from across the globe. Exchanging experience from mundane dailies to niches, what it’s like living there. No expectations, no pressures, just be you. Quick disclaimer, I'm in a healthy open relationship with my man (I also met him this way, can you believe that!?). Some who vibes with me sticks around, but I’m not against a quick chat ofc, that's where the chaos is. Online pals of mine I’ve met stills regularly catching up with me, daily, monthly, maybe next year it doesn’t matter. It’s nice to know that people still catch up to you after long time. Sometime we just shares silly stuff and random pics from daily commutes, I always find it fascinating how different live from even the next border could be different from mine. So wherever you’re from, when we can ping-pong eachother’s while taking things unseriously, we might vibe vibe.

Stop here for quick intro, here’s my long ahh braindumb:

Right now I’m a soon-to-graduate design student after a five and a half year there. WOWWWWOWW?! Five and a half year?! Yes, where I’m from, doiing a final project+undergrad thesis is a requerement to graduate. I heard it called captsone project in english term. A paper and project culmination of my studies for the last 4 years as an undergrad. Mine is apparently too much for a single person to handle but what the heck I did it, BY MY OWN, a whole ass destination branding project that could be a project for a whole studio. BUT I FINALLY DID IT!. Submitted my final paper last week and the other shenanigans requirement. The output is pretty satisfactory atleast for my stnadard. I can show you some of my final exhibition display if you like.

I’ve been in the trenches of mental healths for a long time and just recently it crawled back out after awhile. I though I had it all until things hits me, I gotta live with this forever. But, hey, there’s nothing I can’t do. I made it this far might es well keep it going. I don’t like this vibe but i’m getting rid o fit slowly though meds and therapy and healthy living again bit by bit. I got lonely very often because of that, like dreading lonelyness, even though I’m surounded by many great irl. I find this as one of my escapism and end up with many great online conenction.I find comforts in talking to new people online and listening to their mudnane daily life, their interest, their hyperfixations, tell me wht’s the weather is like or what you’r next cup of coffee order will be. We might be a long term friends or maybe um uhh bromance cough.

As for the pals I made, I found one who loves writing and giving me long replies making it feels like a pen-pal-esque, one who loves collecting fossils around his town, one who loves hiking around in local spots, one who just living the Cali life, a few more, and one bf whose trying 3d modelling. To my surprise for friends I made o non reddit, they’re great! I wish to find more so maybe you’re next? Idk let’s see.

We can play 20 questions and ask eachother random ahh question to keep the convo going, I find it silly and fun way to get to know people quickly. Or maybe we already have common interest if you wanna check the board I mad ein my profile. I try I best to condence what i’ve been obsessed over my live lol.

Wanna tryna skipp the small talks? Dm me with “Panda” so I know you’re a real person and not just the dead internet bot and you actually put time to read through this long ahh brainfarts and actually interested to vibe. Tell me your go to snacks or coffe order, tell me your last game or movie you wathced that got you hooked. I’m a better listener than talker so feel free to share more, but you’ll find out if we clicks if I share and talk more than you 👉👈. The more you tell me about yourself, the more you'll know about me. Let’s vibe.

Hey guys! Just wrapped up my virtual interview today at home (yes, I went onsite assessment and got my interview rescheduled from 1PM to 7PM lol, so I went home to prep\*,\* *yippie*) so here are my share of experience with the process so far:

>**1st Assessment: Behavioral Questions**

Your typical ""what best describes me, or most likely; less likely me"" stuff, but tailor-fit to Capital One. I won't divulge what specific phrases are asked, but I advised that you align your answer to what best describes you in and out of work.

Second part is the SHL tool navigation simulation. For you guys that are familiar already with it, it's definitely easy to do and pass. For those who are not aware yet, you'll be simulating a mock call with customers, get their details and input it in the system. Once done, you'll choose the MOST and LEAST scripted response based on customer's statement/concern, and the outcome of the resolution you provided to them. *Virtual Mock Call, nothing too complex.*

You can replay the audio plenty of times (advisable not to, as it ""might"" affect your score), it's timed so the faster you complete the simulations, better result. That's it.

If you passed, you will be endorsed to the 2nd assessment

\**ba dum tss\*,*

**VERSANT.**

**\******ominous bg music cue and intensifies\****  
***\*health bar appeared\****

>**2nd Assessment: Versant.**

Oh boy, this is not your TYPICAL VERSANT you've grown accustomed already (well, in my case, since it's the first time I applied on a financial company), this is VERSANT on *steriods.*

I'm not kidding, in any means instilling fear and anxiousness to anyone applying, but it is what it is, figuratively.

How to beat this boss fight? You don't need anything else other than the mentally-prepped YOU, your sheer FOCUS, and your RESOLUTE AIM to pass this test.

>I Present to you, my TIPS:

1. **BE AT YOUR A-GAME.** No VERSANT part is same for each candidate (I can vouch for it, since you can hear the others doing their best to answer each part in FULL, LOUD and CLEAR voice differently), and so it's not the time to be or act shyly; everyone who minds their business really shouldn't be listening/looking at you in the first place, so get your mouth warmed up and working.

>**Don't forget to take a dump, piss, quick eat or a needed boost of self-confidence in the comfort room before you take the assessment, candidate**. A sound mind, body and gut, is a sound candidate to pass the test. You'll be advised by the observers, for sure, but I care for your wellbeing, so there's that.

2. **NO DEAD AIR, FILLER WORDS AND SPEAKING IN VERNACULAR.** Examples are *uhm, uhh and moaning-typish* fillers\*,\* mumble, unsure utterance -- AVOID USING THEM AT ALL COST. AI detects it and it significantly lowers your potential score for language proficiency, mastery and real-word structure pronounciation. Take your time to speak SLOWLY but SURELY for your answers, dude. Just don't drag it too much to a point you forgot to form coherent response within the alloted time *lol.*

If you didn't hear the word clearly, speak a different one that makes sense (at least) to complete your answer. If you can't help it and subconsciously speak it along your response, don't beat yourself up; just make sure to outweigh it with the amount of completely understandable words you churned out before time's up.

3. **DON'T OVERTHINK.** Fixate on your own assessment and don't be distracted for a milisecond (if you have a clownfish-ish memory, I pray you survive in this part, *bestie*). Nothing to worry about, I have a secret weapon to share just a few bullets down to help you with that.

4. **GET THE GIST** of each audio contents as much as possible -- allocate your memory each with the best part of the story that you can confidently retain and re-tell. Exact phrases/answers uttered as what's played is great if you can do it *(kudos to you dear sir/maam)*, but to say the main idea or essense of it is ENOUGH.

5. **MAXIMIZE** the time provided each part, don't RUSH to click SUBMIT/NEXT if you need a breather, the test engine automatically do it for you once the recording ends and audio won't play immediately for some parts. You race to fish to attain a passing remark, not with your co-applicant, okay?

6. **EXERCISE MEMORY PALACE**. Here it is, ladies-and-gents. ""Visual-imagery mnemonics"" *(just search it up for complete details*) makes this assessment a walk in the park *(by a mile, fosho)*. There's plenty of things around you -- it's time to put those bits of memory into it so your brain can recall it as soon as you remember the pattern what object you put this and that.

>Short sample: ""Jane Doe heard a strange sound coming from her kitchen. She immediately goes to check it, turn on the light, and peeked into the tumbled trashcan. Her neighbor's cat, Miss Whiskas, jumped out from it, then ran out from the open window above the sink.

Deadass I can't even remember any single words from something I've just read, much less if I can only hear it **ONCE!** That's where the MEMPALACE be your ultimate weapon of mass-memorization comes in! Do TIP 4, look around you, place those word as you listen, REMEMBER them where you associated it, and once the recording hits play, structure your answer as you pattern it.

>How I do it: **Jane Doe** (the recruiter, assisting you in the room), **strange sound** (aircon vent, can make sound, box-shaped like a speaker), **kitchen** (any container object near the recruiter), **turn on the light** (of course, the ceiling light, or switch), **trashcan** (same object as possible), **neighbor's cat** (you can omit the name, or if can remember, say it) (any close object where you put in the trashcan, or anything that forms cat-like figure, really).

That's pretty much it. Feel free to modify it, decide what information you put to your memory palace, and 100% sure you can green that shii. You can even use the keyboard to map out the ideas, much closer to your face, the better you can recall and gather those bits back.

7. For storytelling portion, apply some of the tips above, and go wild with your answer. Well, just make sure the idea is still there, ya' know. Don't want the AI evaluating you singing a random-ass worship song of sort and pray it's dumb enough to remark it as passed (I really have no idea if this works or not; some says it does, but hey, it's up to you to test the waters -- share the result here if you succeeded in tricking those language bots before, or after knowing this cheatcode(?) if you don't mind)

**CONGRATULATIONS!** If your name is called up front and you were told of your upcoming initial interview schedule, you are 2 step away from securing your career with Capital One! Go get yourself a coffee of your like and bread to eat (it's free after they've put you through that mind-numbing, stress-inducing, candidate selection checkpoint, at least *lol*) at the pantry (onsite).

>**The Initial Interview:**

What else is there when it says ""Initial Interview""? It's you and the recruiter, she'll be doing the job of asking questions and it's your role to give the answer that they want to hear. You'll get countless of tips how to ace the interviews across the vast expanse of the NET, so not much else on me to share right now. It's all about you, your previous jobs, education background, the company and role you are applying to/for, *yada yada*.

>**Closing Remarks:**

There you have it! I may have missed more TIPS (definitely), so guys out there that suffered, conquered and mastered the art of EXP-farming the VERSANT, share more here if you want, help each other out :)

For those attending their onsite/virtual assessment, goodluck, may the Year of the Fire Horse affects your career this 2026, and see you when I see you in Capital One (if I passed the hiring process as well, *haha*)",8,1771336320.0,BPOinPH,1,1.0,False

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

Hi, I'm Kiyoko. I'm coming back after a long absence, so please, if you messaged me before feel free to again! I was going through some stuff and needed a social media break. 😅 I'm happily married so not looking for anything flirty, etc. I just want people to talk to to take my mind off the bad things.

My three main hobbies are: animals (reptiles, cats, dogs), video games (mostly WoW atm, recovering from a nerve injury), and reading (horror mostly...)! I am also an artist but usually don't draw too much these days and just collect art from other artists. I sing sometimes for fun. My idea of a good time is hunkering down with my cats and reading a book or watching a horror movie. My husband and his family have gotten me addicted to coffee. I used to be afraid of spiders but my husband got me to love them. Sometimes I watch anime, but I have to be in the mood for it haha.

I will: Send you a lot of animal pics, art, and random memes. Have random ADD thoughts.

I won't: Voice call (unless you're a rare exception), sorry I just hate talking out loud. I swear it doesn't make me a ""worse"" friend tho.

I’m 5’11, fair-complexioned, and currently at a point where I’m not looking for a ""forever"" commitment, but I’m definitely missing that spark of connection. I’m looking for something casual, but with a lot of heart.

I love a good deep dive. Whether it’s about life, weird theories, or just how our days went, I want to actually know you.

I’m big on romance and cuddles. If we’re hanging out, I want it to feel warm and comfortable.
I love random meetups. Whether it’s a last-minute coffee, a walk, or just grabbing food because we’re both bored, I’m down.

A bit about me: I’m easygoing, a good listener, and I value chemistry above everything else. I believe the best ""casual"" relationships are the ones where you actually enjoy each other's company as much as the physical side.

If you’re looking for someone to relax with. You want the perks of romance and intimacy without the heavy ""where is this going?"" talk right away. You’re down for a slow burn and see where things lead.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

So my solution now is **destination LSD runs (dayo runs)**. Just wanted to share some places I’ve tried around Laguna that have parking and are runner-friendly:

* **Terrain:** Mostly shaded, mix of flat and rolling hills (may ahon but manageable)
* **Safety:** Very safe, lots of runners and cyclists
* **Parking:** Available inside campus
* **Restroom:** Di ko pa alam kung saan eto
* **Extras:** May bazaar on Saturdays

# Carmeltown, Canlubang

* **Terrain:** Mix of flat and ahon
* **Safety:** Generally safe, but more cars on Saturdays due to office work
* **Parking:** Can park at The Junction
* **Restroom:** Available in nearby establishments
* **Extras:** Kapetalista nearby (good for coffee or breakfast buffet post-run)
* **Pros:** Accessible, flat sections available
* **Cons:** Some vehicle traffic during workdays



# Sampaloc Lake, San Pablo

* **Loop distance:** \~3.8 km per loop
* **Terrain:** Flat
* **Safety:** Safe, many runners and locals
* **Parking:** Street parking available
* **Restroom:** Limited / hard to find
* **Extras:** Coffee shops nearby

My cat has end stage renal failure. He is likely to pass in the next couple days. I’ve had over 8 1/2 years and he’s a bonded pair with his littermate. He was the first thing I knew about motherhood. He was always so feisty and kind of standoffish to others. He was the one who really made me think I should take a pregnancy test because all of a sudden he became just a little snuggle bug. 

he sat on my pregnant belly through the whole journey. I consider him my doula. Pre-baby, I worked from home so I threw so much love and time into my cat. Every morning he sat by the sink while I made a coffee. I will feel forever guilty for the fact that everything changed when he brought the baby. He couldn’t be the centre of my world anymore as I was trying to balance a new baby with hormones. 

At six weeks postpartum, everything changed when the baby smiled and became less colicky. For this brief six week period, I was surrounded by the most love I’ve ever known with my baby, my husband and cats around me. I can’t even believe it’s gonna be taken from me. 

I felt like now that my baby was about three months old, I finally that the energy to return more focus and attention on the cats again.  I had finally found a routine and I was excited for the cats to be part of that. Tux was supposed to be my son‘s childhood pet. I can’t shake the guilt and can’t shake the sadness. 

I’ll miss him forever and now I’m watching his bonded bears that miserably it be like snuggle me if I could say anything I just want to say thank you to. I love you.

For one brief moment in time, my house was surrounded by so much love that it almost hurt. I so sad that’s been stolen from me. Now I’m consoling his littermate as we plan our goodbyes.

*The lonely, grey wolf did not acclimate to its innate nature to hunt and consume.  When not with the pack the wolf helped defenseless creatures of the forest, offering them passage across great distances and protecting them from other predators in exchange for knowledge.*

*“Does he know his name is Anyu?” one of its passengers asked another, a large white rabbit.*

*The wolf didn’t know it even had a name.  The other wolves did too, but names were useless to them; they only knew to hunt, prey and eat.*

*During a full moon, a wolf can attain higher levels of consciousness, but this knowledge was lost and wolves now howl at the moon in frustration.  They become more cunning predators every moon cycle, eventually they could consume everything if not stopped.*

My daughter is a good writer for her age.  I really shouldn’t be reading her personal journal, but she leaves it out on the coffee table every night. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't excited to read the next chapter after she wrote it. She sat on a swing in the backyard before dinner writing her tale.

***Chapter 2 – The Madcap***

*All creatures of the forest have their secrets, including wolves.  Over time the pack split into two factions.  Thirteen in total, Anyu only needed a full moon- the 13th moon- to convert the good-natured wolves and outnumber the others; the older, deadliest killers.  The maddest of them all being Blackie, their natural leader.  Sometimes called “The Madcap” by deer who were Blackie’s primary target.  At night Blackie was invisible except for its green eyes.  A pure black wolf lurking in the brush, the sight of it alone would scare off other wolf packs.* 

*No creature could defeat it, except one, the unlikeliest creature one could imagine.*

I may need to show my wife this, but I don’t want to interrupt my daughter’s writing, I was really getting into this children’s tale written by my child.

 ***Chapter 3 – The Meeting***

*The forest council convened at dawn to discuss their plan.  Wolves usually were asleep in their caves during this time.*

*“We are smarter than a pack of wolves, we have to work together.” a fox said.*

*The eagles and hawks agreed. The eagles said they could attack wolves from the air but were no match when on ground.*

*Anyu knew the creatures were right; Blackie must be taken down.  The largest, friendliest bears offered their help too.*

 ***Chapter 4 – The Moth***

*“We must find the yellow moth!” The toad exclaimed, the old toad being the wisest of the creatures.  With the ability to live on land and in water, the toad held the most secrets.  The turtles protected the toad for this reason.*

*The Yellow Moth had one ability that none other possessed, the power of distraction.  In no way was the moth a nuisance, like they are to humans, but the opposite, they are revered and respected at a distance by most other creatures.  The wolves didn’t know this and would sometimes follow the moth, getting separated from the pack and eventually dying alone.* 

*The monarch butterflies also possess this ability, but they flew in large numbers making the solitary moth’s power more acute.  There are stories of the moth shooing humans away from the forest using their ability of distraction.* 

*Sometimes the most powerful beings are the most benign.*

During a dinner party at our neighbor’s house, I showed the journal to my wife, and she agreed it was very good.  Our neighbor, Anna, a creative writer herself, said she’d speak to a publisher when the time was right. 

Where we lived, we could hear wolves howling at night.

 ***Chapter 5 – The 13******^(th)*** ***Moon***

*The forest council sent a messenger to the moth, a sparrow, and the moth agreed to help.  Although the moth didn’t communicate with us, it spoke to the wise toad directly.*

*The moth revealed it was most vibrant during a full moon, glowing brightest at midnight, the prime time to take down The Madcap.*  
   
*Man doesn’t understand insects exist in a dimension orthogonal to the human world.  They possess knowledge that humans can never learn. Only certain sacred plants allow humans to see the insects in their true form.  These plant secrets are guarded by the Shamans, allies of the forest creatures, but they cannot themselves intervene in natural law.*

 ***Chapter 6 – The River***

*Anyu told the creatures that Blackie led the pack to a certain part of the forest near the river during a full moon, the night of their greatest feast. A piece of land high above the water with no obstructions to the moon, besides the oldest tree in the forest that even the wolves knew not to destroy.*  
   
*The moth hid itself behind this tree until Blackie’s pack awoke from their slumber.  The moth had another ability the other creatures didn’t know it had; it could see Blackie’s whole form. It wasn’t invisible to the moth as it was to us.  Even though the moth was placing itself in danger, it knew when Blackie spotted it, it had control over Blackie’s pack-mind.  The moth could fly faster than the pack could run, and it flew in the direction of the moon over the river as the pack ran off a cliff into the water below.  Some survived and ran away, but The Madcap had fallen.  Hawks and eagles swooped down and feasted on the beast as it struggled to swim back to shore; the bears prevented Blackie from reaching safety.  The Madcap was defeated.*

I noticed a yellow moth on my daughter’s window hovering near the spotlight.  This must be the “yellow moth” from her tale.  It was very large and beautiful.

My daughter then came strolling out of the forest.  How did she go there unnoticed?  Behind her was a large, grey wolf.

I ran outside thinking she was in danger, but the wolf was docile as described in her story.  I felt like I was part of the tale now.

My daughter said to the wolf, “Anyu, you have been very good.  This is your new home now.”",1,1771335414.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

just looking for some advice please. I have been asked to do a custom run from WA to NSW, drop off some equipment then return.

Solo driver, never go outside of WA usually.

It will be in a 10 pallet HR, nearly new rented truck, but its likely going to be 16.5T GVM so it looks like the fatigue laws apply.

I also think it only has a day bed, which wont comply in NSW.

I'm just doing my research to make sure I comply with the laws in the other states as required. I just organised a Work Diary today.

I'm not a regular long distance driver, so was planning on sticking to 10 hour days, 4 or 5 days is fine each way. I usually stop for a coffee after 4 hours.

I spent 4 months driving around Aus before in a caravan and know animal strikes are a big risk, so I have no intention of driving at dawn or dusk and will only be driving in daytime. I have a $10k excess on the truck also.

I'm doing my own research, but as part of that, I am just asking here also if there anything else I need to know compliance wise ?

Never crossed the Nullabor either, any other advice, best road houses, where to avoid, anything I shouldnt miss ?

Leaving next week. No keyboard warriors please, the WA rules are very different, so I'm trying to do the right thing and prepare properly.

I thought my best chance in this case is to simply buy from one of the big brands in a supermarket. Big brands are able to roast very consistently which is good. The problem is that the coffee in supermarkets can be quite old and there are no roasting dates which is especially bad because dark roasts go stale so quickly.

To be clear, I'm not complaining, just curious if our experience was the norm. Happy to have the vehicle.

Our appointment time was 11a, a time we picked. Day before they sent an email rescheduling it for 5p. Delivery location was an hour away. Once we arrived (15 minutes early) it was hard to get any employees attention but once we did they said our car wouldn't be ready at 5. They directed us to a waiting room where ""we could get snacks and drinks."" But there there were none -- not a single piece of food or drink; just an empty refrigerator, empty place where coffee pods could have been. Eventually they made it clear it would be a while so we left to find food and return. Still wasn't ready. Eventually they were ready after 6pm. By then it was dark outside so hard to inspect. We tried most of the mechanical features like doors, windows, seats, etc. Second row seat wouldn't fold flat (7 seater). Several Tesla employees tried; took a while because none of them were confident they knew the correct procedure since, as they said, ""they rarely delivery Xs"" so they were just trying different things. Eventually decided it was defective (exact same lever worked on the other side). Suggested we take delivery and schedule service to fix it later in the app.

App later indicated of the nearest 3 locations that the soonest appointment was 35 days away. Still waiting to hear back on our service request. One of our hesitations with Rivian and Lucid as options had been time to get service, based on buzz from owners on Reddit. I had not heard that Tesla was similar but is what it is -- FSD was the decisive factor so there were no alternatives anyway.

1r764gv,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenAscending/comments/1r764gv/watched_if_your_life_sucks_by_sam_harris_so_you/,"Watched ""If your life sucks"" by Sam Harris so you don’t have to here’s what actually works","So many of us wake up feeling like we’re behind in life. Trapped in a cycle of work, scrolling, and low-key burnout. And the worst part? We think it’s just us. That we’re failing at something everyone else has figured out. But after watching Sam Harris’ “If your life sucks, watch this,” and digging through books, psychology research, and podcasts, it’s clear: feeling like life sucks has less to do with your actual circumstances and more with the way our attention and thoughts are hijacked, every day.



This post is for anyone caught in that vague, miserable fog. The goal isn’t some toxic positivity. It’s to show that your experience makes total sense in this world, and there are concrete ways forward. Some influencers push lifestyle hacks without any real science. This isn’t that. This is the good stuff backed by neuroscience, philosophy, and practical methods that actually improve your lived experience.  



Here’s what helped the most after sitting with Sam Harris’ core idea: The quality of your life is largely determined by the quality of your moments. And moments are built out of attention. Not goals. Not achievements. Your attention.

  


Here are 3 game-changing shifts based on research that actually help when life feels unbearable:



**Master your default mental state**

Most people live in a constant state of distraction. Harris calls this the ""default mode"" of the brain and neuroscience backs it up. A 2010 Harvard study led by Killingsworth & Gilbert found that mind-wandering is the single biggest predictor of reported unhappiness, even more than income or physical health.

What works instead:

Try daily mindfulness training (10-20 minutes). Apps like Waking Up (Harris’s own app) are science-based and go way deeper than the “meditation is good” clichés.

In Harris’ words: “You don't have to believe anything to wake up. You just have to notice what's already true.”

This isn’t about silencing thoughts, it’s about seeing them for what they are. Just thoughts. Not facts. Not commands.



**Reclaim your attention economy**

Every time you scroll, check, click, or switch tabs, your attention is getting fragmented. According to Cal Newport in Deep Work, this trains your brain for shallowness.

What works instead:

Schedule deliberate boredom. Sam Harris and neuroscientist Andrew Huberman both emphasize the importance of doing nothing, literally staring at a wall or walking without stimulation for 10-20 minutes a day. This resets your internal reward system.

Cut out low-quality dopamine loops (TikTok, excessive notifications, compulsive email checking). These loops destroy baseline contentment.

Reintroduce single-tasking. Read a physical book. Cook without podcasts. Your brain will resist but it’ll thank you later.



**Redefine success as presence, not progress**

Harris argues that chasing external wins without learning how to be present guarantees dissatisfaction. Modern life conditions us to delay peace until “after the next thing.”

This mirrors research from UC Berkeley's Dacher Keltner, who shows that awe and presence not achievement correlate with sustained well-being.

What helps:

Use the question “What is lacking in this moment?” as a pattern interrupt. 99% of the time, the answer is: absolutely nothing.

Reframe daily tasks (doing laundry, commuting, brushing your teeth) as practice for being in life, not just getting through it.

Embrace philosophical minimalism. Harris draws on stoic themes here: control what you can, accept what you can’t, and spend less time trying to optimize things that don’t matter.

  
**Bonus resources if you want to go deeper:**



**Books**

Waking Up by Sam Harris a secular guide to spirituality and consciousness

The Untethered Soul by Michael A. Singer a deep (but simple) dive into the nature of thoughts and identity

Stolen Focus by Johann Hari backed by 250+ studies on how modern life is robbing us of attention, and what to do about it



 **Podcasts**

 Making Sense by Sam Harris covers consciousness, suffering, and meaning with zero fluff

 The Huberman Lab especially episodes on dopamine, stress, and cognitive performance

 On Being with Krista Tippett explores the human condition and how to live a meaningful life



 **Research-backed ideas to integrate**

 Practice gratitude with granularity (e.g., not “I’m grateful for coffee,” but “I’m grateful for the way the warm mug feels in my hands this morning.”)

Spend more time in awe-inducing environments (nature, night skies, music). UC Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center found this boosts wellbeing faster than almost any intervention.

Build in sacred, non-negotiable quiet time. Even 10 minutes. It trains you to be okay with being alone with yourself.

  
If everything feels like it’s crumbling, you’re not broken. You’re just too aware for a society built on distraction. But that awareness? It’s your power.

TL:DR; Been suffering with PPPD and autonomic dysregulation for 3 years, quality of life sucks, thinking about SSRI that is risky with bipolar diagnosis. Can I get better on my own or should I take SSRI? 

I’ve posted in this community before and got great support. I’m at a crossroads, I’ve been dealing with a mix of PPPD and autonomic dysregulation for almost 3 years.

I tried VRT and it got me to be about 60% -70% functional. When PPPD first started, I couldn’t even walk into stores or social functions without feeling like I’m going to pass out with autonomic surges and dizziness.

Now, I’m able to go into stores and sometimes on good days, social gatherings but I’m highly uncomfortable, disoriented, and have symptom surge at the checkout counter when I have to interact with the cashier. I can’t really handle restaurants unless it’s outdoor seating. 

This disease has isolated me and stolen my vibrancy from me as I’m literally thinking all day how I have to go to Starbucks to order a coffee and feel like the floor is going to give out under me. 

I’m thinking about talking to my psychiatrist about starting an SSRI as a last resort. SSRIs are risky for me as I have bipolar and they can trigger mania. 

Im wondering if any of you have had symptoms improve on their own after 3 years and have been at this level of functioning? Do you think SSRIs will help me get to 90% functional and back to living a normal life? Is it worth the risk with bipolar? 

I just don’t know what else to do. I get really upset when I have flares and setbacks and my quality of life is suffering tremendously.

We both really enjoy them and don't mind the cost as we both struggle with food. It's just a win all around for us. I noticed something really gross though that has been happening 🤣😭🤣 Our bowel movements smell like an entire farm of cattle is laying dead in 125° heat. Like I just went to the bathroom... Went out to the kitchen to make a cup of coffee and on my way back to the bathroom, audibly gagged from the smell. We've lived together off and on for 5 years and have tried every meal kit there is and have never ever noticed anything like this. Is it the meals????? Or are we sick or something?! We don't really feel off after eating them, but we do notice a bit of rumbling in our bellies. The meals are always in date. We eat a range of the meals... Not anything specific... So I'm guessing it's something they maybe use to preserve?? I don't know... I'm at a loss and it really stinks...",2,1771334699.0,Tovala,2,1.0,False

Then to mention if you want to leave 0 you have to select custom and put that in.

I'm M 22, in college I was known as the sports guy — jerseys, tournaments, always on the ground and mostly in class just to mark attendance and disappear. There was this girl in my class. We never really talked, just those small eye contacts and half smiles like we both noticed but pretended we didn’t. Somehow I started timing my breaks around her lectures and walking corridors I had no reason to walk. At that time I genuinely didn’t think I liked her, I just felt good seeing her.

One day a mutual friend told me she liked me but wouldn’t say it first. For the first time, going up to someone felt harder than any match I had played. I sat in one of her classes, talked with her group and after class asked if she was free. We went for coffee and while laughing nervously I said, “I like you… for quite some time.” She didn’t answer. Not a no, not a yes. I didn’t push it. While leaving I said “yaar bata de,” she smiled “kya batana hai?” I asked again and she said yes.

Before we left she handed me a Jaipur style notebook and said she knew I write. Nobody in college knew that. I don’t even remember what I replied, my mind just went blank in a good way.

For a month we were everywhere together without announcing it to anyone. College stopped being attendance and started being waiting for a face to look up when I entered.

Then one day she just didn’t come.

I thought bunk.
Then maybe sick.
Then maybe exams prep.

Her phone — switched off.
Socials — gone.
Friends — confused.

After a week the college office said she withdrew admission. No goodbye, no explanation, nothing. Just absence where a routine used to be.

Months later someone mentioned casually that her family shifted to Dubai suddenly because of her father’s job. That was it. That’s how I found out the person I was meeting every day now existed in another country.

I still have that notebook. I never wrote in it. Felt like the last conversation we never got to finish.

Strange thing is… I don’t know whether it was love or just timing playing a cruel joke, but sometimes you meet someone exactly when life is about to take them away. There was no breakup, no closure, not even a last message — just a normal day that secretly became the last one.

And I think that’s why it stayed.

The Sony WH-1000XM5, at $398, completely redefines expectations in the upper tier of personal audio among high-end noise-canceling headphones.

The sound quality is simply astonishing, a fact confirmed through extensive listening across diverse genres and environments. This isn't just about powerful bass; it’s about the nuanced separation of instruments and vocals, presenting a soundstage usually reserved for much pricier audiophile gear. Cross-referencing verified reviews across thousands of user experiences confirmed the exceptional sound quality and ANC claims hold true, even against more expensive contenders. Sony has packed some serious engineering into these, making them a formidable presence in a competitive space.

My testing spanned over three months, involving daily commutes, long study sessions in a bustling coffee shop, and several hours on a noisy train. They consistently delivered, making me forget I was even wearing them.

*   The **Integrated Processor V1** combined with the HD Noise Cancelling Processor QN1 offers industry-leading noise cancellation. On a recent cross-country flight, the drone of the engines vanished, replaced by my music, performing noticeably better than my previous Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones in low-frequency rumble.

*   Equipped with **30mm drivers** that manage an impressive frequency range, the WH-1000XM5 delivers crisp highs, detailed mids, and a rich, controlled bass. Support for **LDAC Bluetooth codec** means you’re getting near-high-resolution audio wirelessly, making every track a more immersive experience.

*   Sony redesigned these with a focus on *all-day wearability*, featuring a softer, more ergonomic fit and stepless slider. I wore them for several hours during a work session without discomfort, a significant improvement over previous iterations that sometimes felt too clamp-like.

*   Expect a solid **30 hours of battery life with ANC** on, which easily gets you through multiple days of use or a long-haul journey. Smart features like Speak-to-Chat automatically pause your audio when you start talking, a small convenience that proves incredibly useful in daily scenarios.

At $398, you're paying a premium for truly exceptional audio fidelity and best-in-class noise cancellation. Compared to the $500+ options from Sennheiser or Apple, this investment makes sense if your priority is pure sonic excellence and superior noise canceling without breaking the bank.

However, they don't fold down as compactly as some competitors, and the touch controls can be sensitive to accidental brushes. These are not for someone who prioritizes extreme portability above all else or needs headphones for intense gym workouts.

1r75q83,https://www.reddit.com/r/Viibryd/comments/1r75q83/just_a_fun_long_viibryd_story/,Just a fun long Viibryd story,"Full disclosure I am a prescriber and prescribe psych meds all day every day! I have seen variable results with viibryd. I tend to like trintillex much better, I see higher % of efficacy with it- besides the nausea, I see a little less activation and gentler onset of benefits

That being said I know Viibryd works for a select few. If somebody reports sedation and sluggishness and worse adhd symptoms on SSRI, I start thinking snri vs bupropion vs Viibryd /trintillex 

If somebody reports the above and sexual side effects I start thinking bupropion vs the Sparis

SO. Here I am. An aging mom, working full time in a tough field in her 40s with GREAT 4 years of success on lexapro until it basically pooped out and started causing classic side effects with no longer good benefit. My symptoms also shifted from panic/ocd like anxiety in my early 30s to mixed generalized anxiety and depression. (This is a classic example of how our symptoms shift across a lifespan! Younger years anxiety is more panic and somatic and tend to shift into “burnout” type symptoms)

I was fist switched to bupropion XL 150 and that was hell on earth. Thought I was dying. Didn’t sleep, heart racing. 4th day quit.

Then we trialed sertraline. My prescriber swears it’s better than lexapro, I disagree, but ya know, we got our favorites. I got to 50mg and felt so foggy brained and dumb— forgot my words, spacey as hell. 3-4 weeks in quit.

She had me try lamotrigine. I got up to 100mg. I think everything got way worse. More depressed and angry, poor focus. 6-8 weeks in I quit.

Finally did some testing. Came back as having SEVERE impulsive adhd (lol I was not expecting that! Highly functional adult but it was a bit of an ah ha moment for my interpersonal functioning— I get very intense and social and has tended to info dump). Some autistic traits also noted. Ok cool. That felt right as I’ve always been the “gifted” weirdo.

Started methylphenidate 18mg. Just methylphenidate alone seemed to be the answer for about 6 months

But my depression came back. Anxiety did not! ANOTHER classic psychiatry example of how stimulants can temporarily mask depression but is not a long term medication for it. I have to explain that sometimes. And I see this happen a lot.

So finally— started viibryd 10.

Day 3-4 amazing. Motivation! Energy! Smiling and laughing with my kids. Life is wonderful! “Why don’t I prescribe this med to everyone?!” Ha. Classic pitfall of psychiatry too. Works for me? Will work for everyone! Even though I know not true!

This first week though, I had HUGE appetite spike. Like insatiable appetite. But then got full really quickly. 

Week 2- uh oh, insomnia. Heart palpitations, higher anxiety in evenings after methylphenidate leaves my system around 6pm.

Week 3-  holding my methylphenidate. less insomnia. Still some heart palpitations.  Still some anxiety in evenings. 

Week 4- still some mild insomnia! Getting frustrated. supposed to be going up to 20mg but not going to do it yet. Still holding my methylphenidate. Work functioning and general happiness level is starting to go downhill. Working on cutting out coffee. Now taking a propranolol in the evening.

Blood pressure is higher at 120/90. Before on just methylphenidate was 110/70.

Week 5- finallly maybe getting past the initiation anxiety. Still holding my methylphenidate. Going on just one cup of coffee a day now. Palpitations gone. Sleeping better. Going to ask about switching to focalin XR which is 8-9 hr med vs Concerta. Feeling happier again bc anxiety and sleep are improving. Less coffee needed. Functioning is improving again. 

I have never had nausea on viibryd. I have seen in the last 3-4 weeks my appetite reduce a smidge. No increase in libido yet. I have no interest in alcohol. Honestly I think lexapro was causing alcohol cravings after a few years on it. And while on nothing, I was drinking fairly regularly (like a beer or wine 3-4 days a week) too. But since getting on methylphenidate that webt way down. And now Viibryd has squashed any desire for booze. So that’s cool. I’m happy to have my De Soi mocktail and wind down without anything else.

About to enter week 6 and this is when I see prescriber. I’m going to first try and get comfy on 10 + shorter acting adhd med and go up to 20mg if needed. 

Thanks for going on the long journey with me!

I don’t have a conclusion. But I can write up a part 2 in another 6-12 weeks.

**Essentia-to-Metadata** \- uses ML models to actually listen to your tracks and tag them with genres, moods, and other metadata. Not based on filenames or existing tags, it analyzes the actual audio.

What it can detect:

* Genres (pretty accurate too, uses multiple models)
* Moods - happy, sad, aggressive, chill, etc.
* Musical stuff like danceability and whether it's vocal or instrumental

I've been running it on my library for a while now and it's been solid.  Works with MP3, FLAC, and other common formats.

I found myself gripped with envy as I read—not because the foods were particularly appetizing, but because I would kill for my kid to eat like that.

To wit: As a girl, Edith Wharton adored oyster sauce, turtle, stewed celery, cooked tomatoes, and lima beans in cream. Mark Twain fondly remembered eating succotash, string beans, squirrels, and rabbits on his uncle’s farm. And during her childhood, Veit writes, Elizabeth Cady Stanton “happily ate vegetables, hickory nuts, and cold jellied brain.”

If these don’t sound like typical “kid foods,” that’s because they aren’t, and weren’t. “Kid food,” as a category, is a recent invention. According to Veit, American kids weren’t picky until the early 20th century. (Indeed, the word picky came into widespread usage around then.) Before that, Veit writes, children in the United States ate “spicy relishes, vinegary pickles, wild plants, and a huge variety of animal species and organ meats. They slurped up raw oysters and looked forward to their daily coffee.” Fennel seeds and tomatoes were considered treats.

According to Veit, the idea that kids are naturally neophobic, or wary of new tastes, is a myth. Eating like a child, Veit explains, was once understood to mean being overly excited and undiscriminating about food, not being picky. In the 1860s, a doctor wrote that children generally ate “anything and everything.”

Veit’s book recounts how kids went from eating jellied brain to consuming, like my toddler, little but macaroni and cheese. A big part of the story, as she tells it, is that American kids used to be hungrier at mealtimes—which meant that they were more eager to eat anything. Before the 20th century, many children did hours of chores both before and after school, so they worked up a good appetite. (Maybe Twain was hungry for those string beans because he spent so much time hunting wild turkeys and clubbing pigeons to death.) Few kids snacked between meals, because processed foods weren’t widely available. In addition, parents tended to be confident that children could learn to like most adult foods. If a child didn’t like a given meal, they generally wouldn’t be offered an alternative, because, due to a lack of refrigeration, no other food was on hand. But after a series of societal changes in the 20th century, Veit writes, “the children were less hungry. The food was less delicious.” And pickiness was born.",6,1771333930.0,atlanticdiscussions,9,0.88,False

I have a wilfa svart grinder for use with my filter machine.

I would like to have the hopper full of beans have the timer set and just press grind and get my 30g of coffee.

To be fair the grinder does not stay pugged in all the time.

So first thing I have to do is turn the grinder setting full one way and back to my setting before it works.

I have now gone through two bags of beans trying to get the timer setting correct. I thought I had it after the 1st bag, and marked the grinder. 

But no. First run gave me 22g so then I started the whole process again .

I ran out of beans before I could get to the desired weight,

This is so frustrating.

Any advice, other than measuring out a single dose each time?

1r75cfm,https://i.redd.it/dd87aaovy1kg1.jpeg,Pisces Season 2026 Tarot Guide: Harness Intuition to Manifest Your Deepest Desires,"Last February, a voice note came through at 2:22 AM: “He exists. Everything you said would happen. I’m crying.” This was from someone who’d been single for six years after a devastating divorce. She’d worked with one of our tarot practitioners through the previous Pisces season manifestation window, and she’d finally called in her person — not through desperation, but through deliberate alignment with the most intuitive, heart-opening season of the year.

If you’ve been feeling like true love is everyone else’s story but never yours, or like you keep attracting the wrong people despite your best efforts — Pisces season love manifestation is your cosmic reset. And it’s coming fast.

# What Actually Is Pisces Season for Love Manifestation?

In astrology, Pisces is the final water sign — it’s the frequency of unconditional love, spiritual connection, and dissolving the boundaries between what is and what could be. The Pisces season love manifestation window runs February 18 through March 20, 2026, creating 30 days when the universe is literally configured to support heart-centered breakthroughs.

When Pisces energy activates, the veil between your current relationship reality and your desired love story becomes permeable. This isn’t just romantic timing — it’s spiritual architecture shifting to support soul-level connections.

From a tarot perspective, Pisces season manifestation amplifies these cards:

**The Star** — hope restored, faith in love after disappointment

**The Moon** — trusting your intuition about romantic connections

**The Two of Cups** — soul-level partnership and mutual recognition

**The Ace of Cups** — new emotional beginnings and overflow of love

If you’ve been waiting for the best time for love manifestation, this is it. The cosmic timing for calling in your person is quite literally on your side.

# Why Pisces Season Creates Relationship Breakthroughs

The pattern is undeniable: this 30-day window creates more romantic breakthroughs than the other eleven months combined. The season peaks during the Pisces New Moon (typically late February/early March) — that’s when the manifestation portal is widest.

**Pisces season love manifestation** doesn’t manufacture relationships out of thin air — it creates the conditions where your authentic energy can finally attract what matches it. This is transformation work, not just consultation.

# When Self-Love Finally Breaks Through

A marketing executive — let’s call her Meera — had been on forty-seven first dates in eighteen months with zero second dates. During her tarot transformation session on [coto](https://app.coto.world/X6FgclnFP0b) before Pisces season, the Five of Cups kept appearing: grief, disappointment, focusing on what’s missing. But The Empress also showed up repeatedly — her capacity for self-love and magnetic feminine energy was intact, just buried under layers of rejection.

The practitioner helped her use the Pisces window to release the story of “I have to prove I’m worthy of love” and reconnect with the truth that she already was. This is how to manifest love during Pisces season — not by chasing harder, but by returning home to yourself.

Three weeks later, she met someone at a bookstore. Not on an app. In the poetry section, reaching for the same book. “I wasn’t even trying,” she said. “That’s how I knew it was real.”

# The Mother Who Stopped Settling

Another client — Kavya — had been dating a man who was “fine” for eight months. “Everyone tells me I’m too picky,” she said during her session on [coto](https://app.coto.world/X6FgclnFP0b). “Maybe this is as good as it gets at 42 with two kids.”

The Eight of Swords appeared: trapped by beliefs that weren’t even hers. During **Pisces season**, her practitioner guided her through a cord-cutting ritual and helped her rewrite her standards. Not lowering them — claiming them fully for the first time.

This is what spiritual transformation for love looks like in real time. She ended the “fine” relationship. Two months later, she met someone who made “fine” look like settling for crumbs when she deserved the whole feast.

# How Pisces Energy Amplifies Love Attraction

Pisces season love manifestation supports quantum leaps rather than incremental progress. You can’t “gradually” meet your soulmate. These are threshold moments. You’re either in the old pattern or the new reality.

During Pisces season, your energetic field around love becomes more magnetic. Clarity comes faster about whether someone is right for you. Your intuition about romantic potential sharpens; you can suddenly sense who’s aligned versus who’s just familiar. Synchronicities increase: the “random” introduction, the conversation that leads to a date, the person you almost didn’t swipe right on.

**Pisces season manifestation** removes the invisible barriers that have been making love feel impossible.

# Your Pisces Season 2026 Love Manifestation Guide

This is strategic energetic alignment the kind of tarot-guided love manifestation that creates real relationships and measurable transformation.

# Before February 18th (Preparation Phase)

**Get crystal clear on your ask.** Not “a boyfriend” but “a partnership that feels safe, playful, and spiritually aligned with someone who has done their healing work and is ready for real commitment.” Write it in present tense as if it’s already true. Be specific about feelings: “I feel seen, cherished, and excited to wake up next to this person.”

**Identify your three biggest love blocks.** Write them down honestly: “I’m too damaged for healthy love.” “All the good ones are taken.” “I’ll have to choose between passion and stability.” Notice where these beliefs came from.

**Clear your physical space for partnership.** Make room in your closet. Buy two coffee mugs. Sleep on one side of the bed. Your environment needs to signal to the universe: there’s space here for love.

**Get a tarot transformation session.** Work with a [coto](https://app.coto.world/X6FgclnFP0b) expert to pull three cards: Where am I now in love? What’s blocking me? What’s trying to emerge? This is your baseline for **Pisces season love manifestation**.

# February 18 — March 20 (Peak Manifestation Window)

Set your intention during the Pisces New Moon. This typically falls in late February/early March 2026. Write your love intention on paper during the new moon window. Speak it out loud to yourself in the mirror. This is your Pisces new moon love ritual.

**Take one aligned action weekly.** Update your dating profile with authentic recent photos. Say yes to that dinner invitation. Go to the event where you’ll meet new people. Have the difficult conversation. **Pisces season manifestation** amplifies movement, not waiting.

**Release resistance through water.** Write your three blocks on biodegradable paper, then dissolve it in water or release it in a moving stream. Water is Pisces’ element — it carries away what no longer serves. This is a powerful **manifestation ritual for attracting soulmate** energy.

**Visualize for 11 minutes daily.** See yourself with your person — not their face (you may not know them yet), but the feeling. The morning coffee together. The inside jokes. The feeling of being fully yourself and fully loved. Feel it in your body as if it’s happening now.

**Work with tarot guidance weekly.** Connect with a [coto](https://app.coto.world/X6FgclnFP0b) expert to ask: “What does love want me to know this week?” These sessions track your progress and adjust your approach for maximum **Pisces season love manifestation** results.

**Say thank you every night.** Gratitude is the closing signature on your romantic manifestation. Thank the universe as if your person is already on their way. This isn’t denial — it’s energetic certainty.

# After March 20th (Integration Phase)

**Stay alert for unusual meetings.** **Pisces season manifestation** often arrives through unexpected channels — the friend of a friend, the wrong coffee shop, the delayed flight. Write down synchronicities as they happen.

**Notice your dreams.** Pisces season activates the subconscious. Your dreams may carry messages about timing, blocks, or even symbolic meetings with your person.

**Honor your intuition ruthlessly.** If something feels off, trust that feeling even if the person looks perfect on paper. If something feels right, trust that even if it doesn’t make logical sense.

# Work With Verified Love Manifestation Practitioners

# Your Love Story Starts Now

Here’s what we know for certain: **Pisces season** doesn’t care about your romantic resume. It doesn’t care that you’ve been ghosted twenty times, that your last relationship ended badly, that you’re “too old” or “too broken” or “have too much baggage.”

**Pisces season love manifestation** cares about your willingness to feel again. Your courage to stay open. Your decision to believe that love — real, soul-deep, transformative love — is still possible for you.

The clients who’ve worked through this season with [coto](https://app.coto.world/X6FgclnFP0b) expert? They’d all been hurt, disappointed, or resigned before. What changed wasn’t their external circumstances first. What changed was their decision to stop protecting their hearts and start trusting their intuition with expert guidance.

That voice note at 2:22 AM. The pure joy and disbelief in those words: “He exists.”

That’s what we want for you. Not just the relationship or the partner or the happy ending — though those matter. We want you to remember what it feels like to believe in love again. To stop apologizing for wanting someone who truly sees you. To know, bone-deep, that you’re not asking for too much.

Write down your love intention right now. Make it specific. Make it real. Make it yours.

Then **book your free first session on** [**coto**](https://app.coto.world/X6FgclnFP0b) and work with a practitioner who can help you navigate **Pisces season 2026** with clarity, intention, and transformation-focused guidance.

But I feel like I messed things up after telling him that I want to re-establish our fubu setup.

• Context: I fell in love with my fubu of one month. I know, fubu nga eh, dapat hindi ma-in love. But the thing is, he told me na hindi lang daw hookup ang habol niya sa akin, and he really did boyfriend stuff for me during that one month. He always made time for me kahit super busy siya sa work. We would chat daily from morning until night. He would update me if matagal siya makaka-reply because of work, and even when kulang na kulang na siya sa tulog, he would still pick me up sa bahay just to hang out. We would drive around the city, go on coffee runs since I love coffee, have dinner together, then tambay somewhere to talk or watch funny videos. There was even one time na sobrang taas ng fever niya, parang mamamatay na siya, but he still insisted on seeing me just to have dinner together and hang out. I already met his friends, and he met mine too. One night, he surprised me by taking me to a food place that I said I wanted to check out.

Alam ko na hindi na talaga ito fubu, and I was already catching feelings. Honestly, it felt wrong to me kasi ang napag-usapan namin was booty call lang, so ako, or rather my heart, got confused. If fubu lang kami, bakit mas maraming beses kaming nagkita na walang nangyari? Bilang lang sa isang kamay yung times na nag-hookup kami. The rest were just cute and innocent dates.

I told him we should just stay as fubu kasi I’m already falling in love, and I want to regulate my feelings para hindi na mag-develop into something more. Kasi nga, fubu diba? Alam nya na I like him, and told me he’s not denying my feelings naman. It’s just that hindi niya pa kayang i-reciprocate at the moment because he’s still healing. He thinks it would be unfair to me if he enters a romantic relationship habang hindi pa siya buo. He said he understands and respects my decision, and that he’ll just be present during hookups.

Honestly, what he said broke me, but I also felt relief at the same time because I “thought” everything was going to be okay. I thought it would be fine. And now, hindi na kami nag-uusap. I miss him so much. During the past few days na wala kaming communication, I had time to really think things through. I realized I might have hurt him. I’m not sure, but I have this feeling that he thinks I didn’t appreciate him enough.

Vocal naman ako when it comes to appreciating him, and every time we see each other, I always tell him how happy I am to spend time with him. I’m the type of person who can’t hide my kilig and happiness, so when I see him, abot-tenga talaga yung smile ko. Nawawala pagod ko when I see him or even just hear his voice on a call. Legit. Parang nakainom ako ng 10 energy drinks, buhay na buhay 😭 I feel so light around him. He makes me feel safe.

Now I don't know what to do. I thought what I wanted was for the best, but now I regret it so much. Ang bigat sa puso.

Should I talk to him? Or should I give him space and wait for him to reach out first? Mga bro, please help 😭 ayoko syang mawala sa buhay ko huhu my last relationship was 5 years ago, and in those 5 years, I have never been in love like this with anyone else.

1r75bx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1r75bx8/dont_stop_at_farmhouses_on_highway_212/,don't stop at farmhouses on Highway 212.,"I'm writing this on my phone. Battery at 8%. If someone finds this, tell my sister I'm sorry I missed her wedding.

My name is James Murphy. Three days ago, my car died on Highway 212 in Montana. No cell service. I saw a farmhouse sitting far off the highway, half hidden in the dark. I walked to it. That was my first mistake.

The man who answered the door looked like somebody's grandfather. He wore a red flannel shirt, the kind with little round snap buttons down the front. He smiled when he saw me.

""Car trouble?"" he said.

""Yeah. Transmission. Do you have a phone I can use?""

""Sure thing. Come on in. I'm Henry.""

His handshake was warm.

The house smelled incredible. Roasting meat. Garlic. Herbs. My stomach growled loud enough for him to hear.

He laughed. ""When'd you last eat?""

""Around one o'clock. Just lunch.""

""Well hell, it's past eight now. Sit down. I got a roast in the oven. More than enough for two.""

I should have said no. Used the phone and waited outside. But I was starving and it smelled so good and he seemed so genuinely kind.

We ate in his kitchen. The meat was perfect. Tender, seasoned just right. He told stories about growing up on the farm, his wife who died and a daughter in Denver who never called anymore. I didn't ask many questions. Just sat there thinking it must be pretty rough, being this alone. This forgotten.

I relaxed a little.

After dinner he brought out the phone. Old rotary model. I dialed AAA.

Nothing.

""Huh,"" Henry said. ""Lines must be down. Happens sometimes. They'll be back up by morning. Couch is comfortable if you want to stay.""

I hesitated.

""Or you can walk back to your car in the dark,"" he said. ""Your choice. But there's no lights on that road.""

He was right. I'd already walked that road once in the dark. I couldn't see two feet in front of me. I wasn't doing it again.

He set me up on the couch with a blanket and pillow, showed me where the bathroom was.

""I appreciate it,"" I said, not sure about sleeping in a stranger's home. But what choice did I have.

""Don't mention it. That's what neighbors are for,"" he said.

I tried to sleep but couldn't. Something felt off.

Around midnight I got up to use the bathroom, which was down the hall. I passed several closed doors on the way there.

When I came back out, one of them was open. I knew it had been closed before.

I looked inside. It was dark, but there was a switch by the door. I flipped it.

A freezer. Industrial size. The kind you see in restaurant kitchens.

Curiosity got the best of me. I opened it and the cold hit me first, then the smell. Meat and frost and something chemical.

There were packages inside, wrapped in white butcher paper and labeled in black marker.

I picked one up.

""M. Patterson. 3/14. Chuck roast. 4.2 lbs.""

I grabbed another.

""J. Baker. 7/22. Tenderloin. 3.8 lbs.""

Another.

""S. Lisa. 10/3. Shoulder. 6.1 lbs.""

Full names. Dates. Cuts of meat.

My hands started shaking. I dropped the package. It hit the floor like a brick.

""Find something interesting?""

I spun around. Henry stood in the doorway, still wearing that red flannel shirt with the little round snap buttons. Smiling.

""These names,"" I said. ""What are they?""

""Guests,"" he said simply. ""Like you.""

""You're killing people.""

""No."" He shook his head, looking genuinely offended. ""No, James. I'm feeding people. There's a difference.""

He stepped into the room. ""You were hungry. I fed you. And when you're gone, you'll feed someone else.""

I ran. Shoved past him and sprinted for the front door. Locked.

I went upstairs. Henry followed slowly, taking each step one at a time.

""You're making this harder than it needs to be, James.""

I found a bedroom, locked myself inside and pushed a dresser against the door. My chest was heaving. I pressed my back against the dresser and looked around the room. There was a window with no bars.

I ran to the window and looked down. Twenty feet of open air, nothing but hard concrete below.

Behind me the dresser scraped across the floor. The handle turned.

""I understand,"" he said. ""Everyone panics at first.""

I looked around for a weapon and found a lamp in the corner. I ripped the cord out and held it like a club.

""You're already part of the cycle, James. Fighting it now seems... ungrateful.""

The door handle stopped turning.

Silence.

Then I heard his footsteps going back downstairs.

I waited an hour, maybe two. Nothing.

At dawn I moved the dresser and opened the door slowly.

The hallway was empty.

I crept downstairs. The front door was unlocked. Henry sat at the kitchen table, drinking coffee and reading a newspaper like it was any other morning.

""Morning,"" he said. ""Coffee's fresh if you want some.""

I just stared at him.

""Door's open,"" he said. ""You can leave. Walk back to your car. Try to get help.""

""You're just letting me go?""

""Of course. I'm not a monster, James,"" he said, sipping his coffee. ""I'm not going to force you to stay.""

I didn't trust his words. But the door was open.

I ran down the driveway and hit the main road, walking fast in the direction I'd left my car.

It was gone. Like it had never been there.

I kept walking. Hours passed. The sun got higher and hotter and I had no water, no food, and not a single car passed the entire time. Eventually my legs gave out and I sat down right there in the middle of the road, head in my hands, trying to think. Trying to make sense of any of it. The road stretched out in both directions and looked exactly the same either way, flat and empty and going nowhere.

That's when I looked up and saw a house in the distance.

I already knew before I started walking toward it.

It was Henry's farmhouse.

I stood there for a long time just staring at it. The road must have curved. I must have walked in a circle. I told myself that and turned around, walking the other direction this time.

Four hours later I was back at Henry's farm. He was on the porch, rocking in a chair like he'd been waiting.

""Roads are funny out here,"" he said. ""Easy to get turned around.""

My legs gave out on his lawn. I hit the ground hard and everything went dark.

When I came to, I was on the couch. A glass of water on the table beside me. Henry in the armchair across the room, watching me with that same patient expression.

I drank the water without thinking. I was too thirsty to care.

""You see now?"" he said gently. ""There's nowhere to go. The farm is special. Once you're here, really here, you can't leave. Not alive anyway.""

""How long?"" I whispered.

""How long what?""

""How long have you been doing this?""

He thought about it for a moment, like I'd asked him something as ordinary as how long he'd lived in the house. ""Hard to say. Time moves different here. Twenty years? Thirty? More? After a while you stop counting.""

""Why me?""

""Why anyone?""

He stood up and said, ""Get some rest James. I find the ones who fight back always taste bitter.""

That was three days ago.

I know this is long. I keep telling myself that writing it keeps me calm. He moved me to the basement this morning. I didn't fight back. I'm not sure I could have even if I tried.

He brings food three times a day. Roasted vegetables. Fresh bread. Water. No meat. I've been writing this between his visits, waiting for a moment alone with my phone.

Battery at 2%.

If you find this, don't stop at farmhouses on Highway 212. Don't eat the food. Don't go inside.

Then I heard it. Footsteps above me. A door opening.

""Hello? Is anyone here? Our car broke down. Do you have a phone? We seem to have no signal out here.""

A woman. And a child.

""Of course, of course."" Henry's voice. Warm and welcoming as the day I arrived. ""Come on in.""

I tried to scream. Nothing came out but a raw scrape of air.

""You have a little one?"" Henry said. ""How old?""

""He's seven. We've been driving for hours and—""

""Mommy, I'm hungry,"" a small voice said.

""I got stew on the stove. Just finished it.""

I heard their footsteps moving slowly above me toward the kitchen. I pounded on the ceiling until my knuckles split open and bled, but nothing happened.

Then came the sounds. Chairs scraping across the floor, spoons hitting bowls.

Then silence.

Something heavy hit the floor above me. Cold air began seeping through the boards, wrapping around me in the dark.

A single pair of footsteps moved through the kitchen and stopped.

A long silence stretched out. Then Henry's voice drifted down from above, so low I could barely hear it.

""Hm,"" he said softly.

Most people think sugar is just dessert.  
 

**It’s not.**  
 

It’s hiding in your coffee, your salad dressing, your protein bars, even the “healthy” foods you trust. And it could be silently aging your cells, inflaming your arteries, and accelerating fat storage for years before your labs ever show a problem.  
 

In today’s brand new episode, I break down the 5 warning signs that sugar is quietly running the show in your body:  
 

• Energy crashes and mood swings  
• Bloating and gut issues  
• Stubborn belly fat  
• Frequent colds  
• Elevated insulin and A1C  
 

I also explain how high insulin speeds up cellular aging through something called the Hayflick Limit, and why you can look “fine” on paper for a decade while damage builds underneath the surface.  
 

This is not about fear.  
It’s about awareness and prevention.  
 

If you’ve ever wondered why your energy dips in the afternoon, why belly fat won’t move, or why your labs are slowly creeping in the wrong direction, this episode will connect the dots.",1,1771333071.0,ketokamp,0,1.0,False

*The lonely, grey wolf did not acclimate to its innate nature to hunt and consume.  When not with the pack the wolf helped defenseless creatures of the forest, offering them passage across great distances and protecting them from other predators in exchange for knowledge.*

*“Does he know his name is Anyu?” one of its passengers asked another, a large white rabbit.*

*The wolf didn’t know it even had a name.  The other wolves did too, but names were useless to them; they only knew to hunt, prey and eat.*

*During a full moon, a wolf can attain higher levels of consciousness, but this knowledge was lost and wolves now howl at the moon in frustration.  They become more cunning predators every moon cycle, eventually they could consume everything if not stopped.*

My daughter is a good writer for her age.  I really shouldn’t be reading her personal journal, but she leaves it out on the coffee table every night.  I'd be lying if I said I wasn't excited to read the next chapter after she wrote it.  She sat on a swing in the backyard before dinner writing her tale.

***Chapter 2 – The Madcap***

*All creatures of the forest have their secrets, including wolves.  Over time the pack split into two factions.  Thirteen in total, Anyu only needed a full moon- the 13th moon- to convert the good-natured wolves and outnumber the others; the older, deadliest killers.  The maddest of them all being Blackie, their natural leader.  Sometimes called “The Madcap” by deer who were Blackie’s primary target.  At night Blackie was invisible except for its green eyes.  A pure black wolf lurking in the brush, the sight of it alone would scare off other wolf packs.* 

*No creature could defeat it, except one, the unlikeliest creature one could imagine.*

I may need to show my wife this, but I don’t want to interrupt my daughter’s writing, I was really getting into this children’s tale written by my child.

 ***Chapter 3 – The Meeting***

*The forest council convened at dawn to discuss their plan.  Wolves usually were asleep in their caves during this time.*

*“We are smarter than a pack of wolves, we have to work together.” a fox said.*

*The eagles and hawks agreed. The eagles said they could attack wolves from the air but were no match when on ground.*

*Anyu knew the creatures were right; Blackie must be taken down.  The largest, friendliest bears offered their help too.*

 ***Chapter 4 – The Moth***

*“We must find the yellow moth!” The toad exclaimed, the old toad being the wisest of the creatures.  With the ability to live on land and in water, the toad held the most secrets.  The turtles protected the toad for this reason.*

*The Yellow Moth had one ability that none other possessed, the power of distraction.  In no way was the moth a nuisance, like they are to humans, but the opposite, they are revered and respected at a distance by most other creatures.  The wolves didn’t know this and would sometimes follow the moth, getting separated from the pack and eventually dying alone.* 

*The monarch butterflies also possess this ability, but they flew in large numbers making the solitary moth’s power more acute.  There are stories of the moth shooing humans away from the forest using their ability of distraction.* 

*Sometimes the most powerful beings are the most benign.*

During a dinner party at our neighbor’s house, I showed the journal to my wife, and she agreed it was very good.  Our neighbor, Anna, a creative writer herself, said she’d speak to a publisher when the time was right.  

Where we lived, we could hear wolves howling at night.

 ***Chapter 5 – The 13******^(th)*** ***Moon***

*The forest council sent a messenger to the moth, a sparrow, and the moth agreed to help.  Although the moth didn’t communicate with us, it spoke to the wise toad directly.*

*The moth revealed it was most vibrant during a full moon, glowing brightest at midnight, the prime time to take down The Madcap.*  
   
*Man doesn’t understand insects exist in a dimension orthogonal to the human world.  They possess knowledge that humans can never learn.  Only certain sacred plants allow humans to see the insects in their true form.  These plant secrets are guarded by the Shamans, allies of the forest creatures, but they cannot themselves intervene in natural law.*

 ***Chapter 6 – The River***

*Anyu told the creatures that Blackie led the pack to a certain part of the forest near the river during a full moon, the night of their greatest feast.  A piece of land high above the water with no obstructions to the moon, besides the oldest tree in the forest that even the wolves knew not to destroy.*  
   
*The moth hid itself behind this tree until Blackie’s pack awoke from their slumber.  The moth had another ability the other creatures didn’t know it had; it could see Blackie’s whole form. It wasn’t invisible to the moth as it was to us.  Even though the moth was placing itself in danger, it knew when Blackie spotted it, it had control over Blackie’s pack-mind.  The moth could fly faster than the pack could run, and it flew in the direction of the moon over the river as the pack ran off a cliff into the water below.  Some survived and ran away, but The Madcap had fallen.  Hawks and eagles swooped down and feasted on the beast as it struggled to swim back to shore; the bears prevented Blackie from reaching safety.  The Madcap was defeated.*

I noticed a yellow moth on my daughter’s window hovering near the spotlight.  This must be the “yellow moth” from her tale.  It was very large and beautiful.

My daughter then came strolling out of the forest.  How did she go there unnoticed?  Behind her was a large, grey wolf.

I ran outside thinking she was in danger, but the wolf was docile as described in her story.  I felt like I was part of the tale now.

My daughter said to the wolf, “Anyu, you’ve been very good.  This is your new home now.”",2,1771333033.0,stories,1,1.0,False

I was only able to get a ferry to Culebra for 12:30 departure or later, I couldn't find any snorkeling after that time once on the island and we really want to snorkel somewhere, so thinking of putting that into day 2 and go to escambron.

However, is getting to Culebra around 1:30 worth it for a day trip?  Or would doing something like the bio bay swim in La Parguera better suited (we both really want to see the bio bay and I am unfortunately 5-10 lbs over the weight limit for the kayak tours)

**DAY #1** \-

Land around 3:30, pick up rental car, stay is in Santruce

**SCHEDULE/IDEAS TO DO:**

°         Check into rental – Get ready/change

°         Check out the beach and kiosks at Paseo Piñones

°         Maybe Dinner and sunset at The New Reef (open to other suggestions)

°         La Placita de Santruce/La plaza del Mercado??

\*\*TL;DR; : Indian parents bf don’t want him dating me anymore (or anyone) after 2.5 yrs together\*\*.

To give context, my bf (23M) and I (23F) and have been dating 2.5 yrs. I’ve moved cities for him and his parents recently found out about us dating (cuz of me, I told them in dispute) and they have told my bf to stop seeing me entirely. They monitor, track his whereabouts, phone , texts everything, and take nag him 24/7. His mum is the worst, where she hated me all together before she knew about us. I tried for 8 months to get close with her through mutual gatherings, friends ect, I was kind, respectful, would have coffee with her, birthday parties ect.  But she’s never liked me, but other people have. I don’t drink, smoke, nothing bad. I go to religious events too. She’d accuse me of wanting guys attention cuz I’m pretty? (even tho I’ve never spoken to dudes that too esp in front of her), take shots how I don’t speak Marathi (I’m North Indian bruh how can I?) and how I’m not religious enough(when I am, but not going  to shakha (rss) means I’m not according to her?!). I’ve stopped going anywhere for the last 6 months cuz she’s belittled me whenever she sees me. (P.s. ik I’m not the only girl she’s rude to, but wtf man?!)

Now ofc we’re still dating secretly and it’s hard to meet. But it’s been 2months and they still taunt him about seeing me and how I’m ruining his life by making him love me more than his parents. (Context, his parents are very very abusive and rude towards him. His mum has also made his lil bro break up with his gf too, and has been taking the same shots she did with me at her younger sons’s ex gf now whenever she sees her too).

More info, his parents did love marriage themselves. BUT according to astrology, they claim something bad would happen to their sons if they do love marriage, hence they don’t want them dating anyone. His parents don’t have a good marriage and are near divorce.

My concern is, does it ever get better, ik we’re young but will they ever accept me? Are there any ways I can help, I’m avoiding his family entirely to stop conflict.",0,1771332882.0,relationships,1,0.5,False

Don't go inside.,"I'm writing this on my phone. Battery at 8%. If someone finds this, tell my sister I'm sorry I missed her wedding.

My name is James Murphy. Three days ago, my car died on Highway 212 in Montana. No cell service. I saw a farmhouse sitting far off the highway, half hidden in the dark. I walked to it. That was my first mistake.

The man who answered the door looked like somebody's grandfather. He wore a red flannel shirt, the kind with little round snap buttons down the front. He smiled when he saw me.

""Car trouble?"" he said.

""Yeah. Transmission. Do you have a phone I can use?""

""Sure thing. Come on in. I'm Henry.""

His handshake was warm.

The house smelled incredible. Roasting meat. Garlic. Herbs. My stomach growled loud enough for him to hear.

He laughed. ""When'd you last eat?""

""Around one o'clock. Just lunch.""

""Well hell, it's past eight now. Sit down. I got a roast in the oven. More than enough for two.""

I should have said no. Used the phone and waited outside. But I was starving and it smelled so good and he seemed so genuinely kind.

We ate in his kitchen. The meat was perfect. Tender, seasoned just right. He told stories about growing up on the farm, his wife who died and a daughter in Denver who never called anymore. I didn't ask many questions. Just sat there thinking it must be pretty rough, being this alone. This forgotten.

I relaxed a little.

After dinner he brought out the phone. Old rotary model. I dialed AAA.

Nothing.

""Huh,"" Henry said. ""Lines must be down. Happens sometimes. They'll be back up by morning. Couch is comfortable if you want to stay.""

I hesitated.

""Or you can walk back to your car in the dark,"" he said. ""Your choice. But there's no lights on that road.""

He was right. I'd already walked that road once in the dark. I couldn't see two feet in front of me. I wasn't doing it again.

He set me up on the couch with a blanket and pillow, showed me where the bathroom was.

""I appreciate it,"" I said, not sure about sleeping in a stranger's home. But what choice did I have.

""Don't mention it. That's what neighbors are for,"" he said.

I tried to sleep but couldn't. Something felt off.

Around midnight I got up to use the bathroom, which was down the hall. I passed several closed doors on the way there.

When I came back out, one of them was open. I knew it had been closed before.

I looked inside. It was dark, but there was a switch by the door. I flipped it.

A freezer. Industrial size. The kind you see in restaurant kitchens.

Curiosity got the best of me. I opened it and the cold hit me first, then the smell. Meat and frost and something chemical.

There were packages inside, wrapped in white butcher paper and labeled in black marker.

I picked one up.

""M. Patterson. 3/14. Chuck roast. 4.2 lbs.""

I grabbed another.

""J. Baker. 7/22. Tenderloin. 3.8 lbs.""

Another.

""S. Lisa. 10/3. Shoulder. 6.1 lbs.""

Full names. Dates. Cuts of meat.

My hands started shaking. I dropped the package. It hit the floor like a brick.

""Find something interesting?""

I spun around. Henry stood in the doorway, still wearing that red flannel shirt with the little round snap buttons. Smiling.

""These names,"" I said. ""What are they?""

""Guests,"" he said simply. ""Like you.""

""You're killing people.""

""No."" He shook his head, looking genuinely offended. ""No, James. I'm feeding people. There's a difference.""

He stepped into the room. ""You were hungry. I fed you. And when you're gone, you'll feed someone else.""

I ran. Shoved past him and sprinted for the front door. Locked.

I went upstairs. Henry followed slowly, taking each step one at a time.

""You're making this harder than it needs to be, James.""

I found a bedroom, locked myself inside and pushed a dresser against the door. My chest was heaving. I pressed my back against the dresser and looked around the room. There was a window with no bars.

I ran to the window and looked down. Twenty feet of open air, nothing but hard concrete below.

Behind me the dresser scraped across the floor. The handle turned.

""I understand,"" he said. ""Everyone panics at first.""

I looked around for a weapon and found a lamp in the corner. I ripped the cord out and held it like a club.

""You're already part of the cycle, James. Fighting it now seems... ungrateful.""

The door handle stopped turning.

Silence.

Then I heard his footsteps going back downstairs.

I waited an hour, maybe two. Nothing.

At dawn I moved the dresser and opened the door slowly.

The hallway was empty.

I crept downstairs. The front door was unlocked. Henry sat at the kitchen table, drinking coffee and reading a newspaper like it was any other morning.

""Morning,"" he said. ""Coffee's fresh if you want some.""

I just stared at him.

""Door's open,"" he said. ""You can leave. Walk back to your car. Try to get help.""

""You're just letting me go?""

""Of course. I'm not a monster, James,"" he said, sipping his coffee. ""I'm not going to force you to stay.""

I didn't trust his words. But the door was open.

I ran down the driveway and hit the main road, walking fast in the direction I'd left my car.

It was gone. Like it had never been there.

I kept walking. Hours passed. The sun got higher and hotter and I had no water, no food, and not a single car passed the entire time. Eventually my legs gave out and I sat down right there in the middle of the road, head in my hands, trying to think. Trying to make sense of any of it. The road stretched out in both directions and looked exactly the same either way, flat and empty and going nowhere.

That's when I looked up and saw a house in the distance.

I already knew before I started walking toward it.

It was Henry's farmhouse.

I stood there for a long time just staring at it. The road must have curved. I must have walked in a circle. I told myself that and turned around, walking the other direction this time.

Four hours later I was back at Henry's farm. He was on the porch, rocking in a chair like he'd been waiting.

""Roads are funny out here,"" he said. ""Easy to get turned around.""

My legs gave out on his lawn. I hit the ground hard and everything went dark.

When I came to, I was on the couch. A glass of water on the table beside me. Henry in the armchair across the room, watching me with that same patient expression.

I drank the water without thinking. I was too thirsty to care.

""You see now?"" he said gently. ""There's nowhere to go. The farm is special. Once you're here, really here, you can't leave. Not alive anyway.""

""How long?"" I whispered.

""How long what?""

""How long have you been doing this?""

He thought about it for a moment, like I'd asked him something as ordinary as how long he'd lived in the house. ""Hard to say. Time moves different here. Twenty years? Thirty? More? After a while you stop counting.""

""Why me?""

""Why anyone?""

He stood up and said, ""Get some rest James. I find the ones who fight back always taste bitter.""

That was three days ago.

I know this is long. I keep telling myself that writing it keeps me calm. He moved me to the basement this morning. I didn't fight back. I'm not sure I could have even if I tried.

He brings food three times a day. Roasted vegetables. Fresh bread. Water. No meat. I've been writing this between his visits, waiting for a moment alone with my phone.

Battery at 2%.

If you find this, don't stop at farmhouses on Highway 212. Don't eat the food. Don't go inside.

Then I heard it. Footsteps above me. A door opening.

""Hello? Is anyone here? Our car broke down. Do you have a phone? We seem to have no signal out here.""

A woman. And a child.

""Of course, of course."" Henry's voice. Warm and welcoming as the day I arrived. ""Come on in.""

I tried to scream. Nothing came out but a raw scrape of air.

""You have a little one?"" Henry said. ""How old?""

""He's seven. We've been driving for hours and—""

""Mommy, I'm hungry,"" a small voice said.

""I got stew on the stove. Just finished it.""

I heard their footsteps moving slowly above me toward the kitchen. I pounded on the ceiling until my knuckles split open and bled, but nothing happened.

Then came the sounds. Chairs scraping across the floor, spoons hitting bowls.

Then silence.

Something heavy hit the floor above me. Cold air began seeping through the boards, wrapping around me in the dark.

A single pair of footsteps moved through the kitchen and stopped.

A long silence stretched out. Then Henry's voice drifted down from above, so low I could barely hear it.

""Hm,"" he said softly.

A friend challenged me to wear the watch for a week, letting the spin of the wheel control my decisions. Sounds harmless, right? 

Wrong. The first spin landed on ""Go out."" Fine, I thought. I ended up at a bar. The next day, it was ""Spend,"" and I found myself buying a ridiculously expensive, limited-edition sneaker. I got them from alibaba stores, I think. Funny events in my wonderful life. The spins continued, each one moving in a direction I wouldn't normally take. ""Talk to a stranger"" led to a surprisingly deep conversation with a woman at a coffee shop, and ""Try something new"" pushed me to sign up for a yoga class.

Original Sleeves I have tried and loved - Napoli/Kazaar/India/Arpeggio/Risteretto/Capetown Lungo and Stockholm Lungo. Except for Napoli and Kazaar from above, the rest I have never tried, but am curious to experiment and see how it goes. Usually I take my coffee black, but will try a few milk based cortados as well.

1r754og,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menscomeback/comments/1r754og/how_to_trick_your_brain_into_loving_boring_tasks/,How to trick your brain into loving boring tasks (no willpower needed),"We all know this feeling, trying to do something you *should* do (cleaning, studying, replying to emails) but your brain is like, “Nah, let’s watch skateboarding squirrels on YouTube instead.” Most productivity advice says, “Just use willpower.” But let’s be honest, willpower is fragile. It dies faster than your phone battery at 5%.

And honestly, it's not your fault. Society glorifies grind culture. TikTok is full of aesthetic girlboss routines that aren’t rooted in real neuroscience or behavioral psychology. That’s why this post was born, to cut through the noise and give you science-backed, system-based hacks from legit experts. No fluff. Just insights from top research, books, and podcasts that actually work.

Here’s how to master boring tasks *without* willpower, and even start to enjoy them:

* **Make your brain crave the reward, not the task**
   * *Source:* Stanford behavioral scientist Dr. BJ Fogg (“Tiny Habits”)
   * Fogg’s research shows that the secret to behavior change isn't motivation, it’s emotion. You don’t need to feel like doing a task to start it, you just need to associate it with a *tiny success* and a micro-reward.
      * Example: After sending 1 email, do a 5-second dance or sip your favorite drink.
      * Rewire your brain to connect boring tasks with quick dopamine boosts. Ritualize it.
      * Dopamine is more about **anticipation** than achievement, says neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman on the Huberman Lab Podcast. So, anticipate the reward *before* you begin.

* **Use “temptation bundling” to ride your own habits**
   * *Source:* Katy Milkman, behavioral economist at Wharton, “How to Change”
   * Pair an unpleasant task with something you *already* enjoy or crave.
      * Answer emails only while listening to your favorite playlist.
      * Clean your room while rewatching a comfort show (low-stakes, high-reward).
   * Studies published in *Management Science* show this tactic can increase compliance with boring but necessary behaviors by over 50%.

* **Shrink the task until it’s laughable**
   * *Source:* “Atomic Habits” by James Clear
   * Your brain hates effort. So cheat it.
      * Commit to doing just **two minutes** of the task.
      * Want to write? Open a blank doc. That’s it.
      * Want to go for a run? Just put your shoes on.
   * Once you start, inertia kicks in. The human brain is way more likely to continue a task once it's initiated, according to the Zeigarnik effect, backed by decades of cognitive psychology studies.

* **Gamify it like you’re in a mobile app**
   * *Source:* Nir Eyal (“Hooked” + “Indistractable”)
   * Break the task into levels or time blocks. Add a progress bar. Use an app like Habitica or Forest to simulate stakes.
      * Our brain loves leveling up. That’s why games hijack our attention so well.
      * Add fake currency or XP milestones. Even a Post-it note checklist gives you a dopamine drip every time you tick one off.

* **Create identity first, action second**
   * *Source:* “Atomic Habits” again (yes, it’s that legit)
   * Don’t tell yourself “I’m doing boring tasks.” Align with a stronger identity:
      * “I’m the kind of person who finishes things.”
      * “I’m someone who respects their future self.”
   * Identity-based habits are more sticky than outcome-based ones. Research in *Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes* confirms that identity-congruent actions are more sustainable long-term.

* **Use deliberate friction to make** ***distractions*** **harder**
   * *Source:* Cal Newport, author of “Deep Work”
   * People think they need motivation to stay on task. They really just need fewer options.
      * Block sites (Cold Turkey, Freedom, StayFocusd). Leave your phone in another room.
      * Reduce decision fatigue. Pick one task and *hide* the rest.
   * When the friction to distract is higher than staying on task, your brain gives in to what’s easier, even if it’s boring.

* **Default to systems, not moods**
   * *Source:* James Clear and BJ Fogg again, echoed by Tim Ferriss
   * Moods are unreliable. Systems aren’t.
      * Use time-blocking. Default to doing certain tasks at the same time, in the same place, every day.
      * Attach the task to an existing habit anchor (e.g. right after coffee = email triage time).
      * Systems create behavioral autopilot so you no longer rely on how you *feel*.

* **Use a cue > routine > reward cycle**
   * *Source:* Charles Duhigg’s “The Power of Habit”
   * All habits rely on a trigger. Build intentional ones.
      * Cue: 9am alarm = start 25-minute work session.
      * Routine: Focus music + specific task.
      * Reward: Scroll Reddit guilt-free after the session.

Boring tasks aren’t going away. But the way your brain reacts to them can change. You don't need superhuman willpower. You just need better scaffolding. Structure beats motivation. Systems beat moods. And tiny wins beat trying to “push through.”

Keep the brain hacks tight, and the effort light.

1r754dv,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1r754dv/headhunter_ii/,Headhunter II,"The sorcerer had a funny thought, as he gazed down on all of the neon squalor glow of the Fallen Angel City below him from the rooftops edge.  

The Nazis were right. You are a degenerate species…

It was all of it a swollen pustule sac. A land of green milk and curdled cheese, cockroaches swam in the stew of discharge and mire and laughably called it a metropolitan. A cultural hub. 

A blade of a smile formed amongst a tumult of dark and ageless hair, a wizard's haggard beard. Blasted by sand and sun just like the rest of the white robed man. White robed death. 

Some say he is the mad author of the Necronomicon. He has authored the destruction of countless cities, countless places… before this one. 

Jericho. Troy. Münster. Constantinople. Alexandria. Roanoke. Ikeshima. Rome. 

And many others… great and small. He doesn't care. He only loved to watch as the red hand of Iblis crawled across the blackening surface of all things dying in its embrace, turning the whole of the world into its killing floor. 

But that wasn't all with this place. No. He was sent here not just to burn but to gather intelligence for the order. 

And to contest. 

…

Homicide was scrambling. They had nothing. What commonalities they did find between the victims was interesting… but it only led to more bafflement. More flummoxed minds in the busying police departments all across the city. All bullshit pretension had been dropped, all departments across all counties and neighborhoods were working together on this one, to bring the crazy fucking bastard in. 

But still they had nothing. Except that he liked to chop off heads. And leave them at churches for some fucking reason. 

And one other thing. One oddity that more than a few of the sharper minds amongst the rank and file of criminal investigators found to be interesting. 

But did it mean anything? 

All of them. Every head found belonged to someone with a rap sheet that read more like a tome. Miles long some of em. Each and every one of em had a history. 

Mob hits! that was the popular running theory around the suits and their steaming white paper cups of coffee. 

It wasn't a bad one, most thought. 

Could be. Could be.

…

Azræl leapt from the dark and charged into the man as he was making his way to his car. Slamming him into the driver's door as he tried to open it and catching him by surprise. 

This was the one. This was one of the faces the goat-shape demanded be brought before her feet. 

His hand, clenched tightly round the hilt of his great sword came up and bashed the maggot across the mouth with the metal pommel of the weapon. A crack, and a splurt of hot blood and teeth out the mouth and the maggot went down to his knees, mewling. 

Where he belonged. 

The maggot struggled to speak and beg as the headhunter raised his great blade above his head. Readying to strike. 

“Not at all for you or yourself. Swear to her. Pray to me.” said Azræl as he brought the blade down and cleaved the head free from the rest of the meat. It tumble-jumped with a ropey-cord tail of thick black red that the stump continued to produce and shoot in dark gouts for a moment before the headless body collapsed to the street. 

And then the night was quiet again. All around.  Lights buzzed and mock heaven glowed. 

The peace was relative, conditionary. You could still hear the ghost song of sirens in the distance. Wailing away in flight, in search, in search of anything. 

Azræl picked up the head and said his prayers to the goat-shaped lord of his house and order. He tied it to the belt of his hulking black leather visage to join two others and went on his way. 

The sorcerer watched. The sorcerer was impressed. 

…

He heaved. Spewed. Decorated the sidewalk and gutter in more bile, blood and stomach lining as another sharp stab in his stomach racked his guts and his convulsion threatened to roll over into a seizing tear in his brain. 

Homeless and well past his last leg, Elton prayed for death as his sickened body worsened on the pavement, alone at the bus stop. Underneath the flickering glow of a dying bulb, a failing light. 

It was not death he received but something more spectacular. Elton, Grabby to his friends and scum and fellow urchins of the street, was made audience and thus unwitting chronicler to a chapter in a shadow conflict centuries upon centuries old, perhaps the oldest conflict in all of man's time. Perhaps even older than that. 

Grabby/Elton looked up from his own bloody spew of booze and lining and watched a giant titan walk into view. Destroying his solitude on this witching houred boulevard. 

He knew he must be fucked. The guy looked massive and he looked like Mad Max or the Terminator or someone like that and he looked like he was carrying a huge fucking sword. 

And along his belt were a buncha fuckin heads…

No fucking way. The dying urchin refused it. No fuckin way am I actually seein that fuckin thing. 

But real or not, the giant of myth and flesh and chained leather continued to march up and then past the druggie’s view, crossing to and then down the opposite side of the street. 

But then something made the headhunter stop. 

Elton heard it too. 

A note.  Notes. Music. 

A wind pattern series flurry of intricate and delicate notes whispered and alternate sharp-stab blasted through the nighttime witching air. Filling it. Dominating the scene. 

Azræl tensed cat-like coiled as his hair stood on end. The music was flute-like. Middle Eastern flavored…

Goddamit. No.

The headhunter was filled with dread. 

The music stopped. An ancient voice, bold, cut through the night. 

“How are you, German? Been long time."" 

His stance shifted to battle ready as his blade came up raised. His voice, louder, cut through the night as well to the speaker unseen. But he knew who it was to whom he spoke. 

""What do you want, snake?”

Laughter. Real. The knight Azræl always was good for a laugh as far the sorcerer was concerned.

“So funny?"" Azræl said to the night all around him. “Come out and show me what's so funny, witch."" 

More laughter. 

“Have we not shared many things over the long years, my friend? Such a long time. A great deal.”

A series of images flicker-shot through the headhunter's mind then. Whether put there by the devilry of the sorcerer or memories of his own from one of many possible past lives, Azræl was not sure. If he lived through this encounter he would meditate and pray on the matter later. 

If he lived through this encounter. 

His mind's eye:

The forests and the forest people and their villages are burning. There is much bloodletting. The ground is gorged, it cannot possibly drink up all of it. It sloshes about the ankles of the soldiering and the marching and the frantic frightened running. The pursuers too. The blood that chokes the earth sloshes mire-like about the furnace steps of them all. Charlemagne has demanded these pagan northmen be put to kneel before the cross or be put to the sword. Slavery for their women and children…

… and the knights were thus dispatched thither…

The headhunter severed the line of thought or memory or whatever it was with brutal sudden cunning and roared into the empty silent night.

“Show yourself, mongrel!"" 

His laughter never seemed to cease. It stood in place of a physical person. Almost attaining its own physicality.

“You hurl insults because you've nothing else to throw! Nothing else to attack! You are hilarious, German! I've always liked you but you should not be so easy, not after all this time, no?"" 

He had to be careful. The sorcerer was dangerous. He could bend and weave reality seemingly at will, like a djin. None of his brotherhood nor the high priest could discern his source of power. Nor its limits. 

“I insult you, witch, because you and your kind are garbage."" 

Laughter that became a cacophonous crack! It dominated the world, the soundtrack hell to the neon witching scene. The music somehow came to life and began to play again, a wicked untethered horde flurry series of scaling and wild notes in wild man tandem with the laughter of the sorcerer, a corruption duet.

A ney. The headhunter remembers what it is that the instrument is called. A ney. 

Its sound and the sorcerer's laughter were a whirlwind maelstrom expansion sound swell within his skull. For a moment he considered taking his own blade and driving it into his own face, bashing it in and freeing that which was trapped within and growing, threatening to burst like the milk of green infection.

He stopped himself at the last moment. His training saving him. He recognized what was happening, what it was…

… bewitchment. 

He regained his focus against the tumult wave of sound storm wielded by the sorcerer, who once again cried out from nowhere. 

“Garbage! We are all garbage for the earth, German. We are all meat detritus for the watering jaws of the starving soil, we all return to it, are all reduced to ruin and returned to the sour womb to feed the indifferent planet. You know! You know! Only our petty Gods care! And so they fight! And, we, their moving pieces!”

And with that, the pieces did move. 

 Hand of Iblis. The mad sorcerer. 

Against champion of the goat-shape, Azræl.

And this modern Sodom of steel and human woe was to be the chess board for their latest match. A contest of secret champions. 

He did not see, but felt… 

Behind him. Movement. Killing stance. 

The headhunter whirled round with sudden animal speed in a counter slash. Roaring. 

But he roared… and slashed… at nothing. 

Nothing there. Only thin night air. 

Laughter/voice. Behind him again. 

“The same tricks always work on all of you."" 

He whirled once more. Nothing. 

The laughter again. Across the street. 

Azræl drew throwing dagger and with a lunge and a flick/turn of the forearm and wrist, threw the quivering blade. 

It struck pavement next to a dying drunk in a splatter burst of caveman fire spray. Grabby yelped. But there was no sorcerer of the sands over there. 

Or anywhere. 

Goddamit. 

""Up here.”

The headhunter whirled once more, a dancer upon my stage thought the sorcerer but kept it to himself. The German would not appreciate such an observation. 

""Why do you hide in a tree?” asked the black knight of the goat-shape order impetiously. 

The sorcerer grinned, balanced on the branch of a starving sapling oak. Running alongside a dark and quiet apartment building. 

""I've always appreciated a wider view, German. Always. Up here, I see more and I am closer to heaven and therefore I can see more like God. You… and your brothers… you stay down there in the dirt because you cannot know anything more."" 

Azræl raised blade. 

“Come down here and show me what I know, mongrel. Perhaps I can show you a thing or two as well."" 

The sorcerer shrugged. 

“Eh."" 

Azræl drew once more and threw. The throwing blade of ornate seven pointed star flew unabated, cutting through the nighttime chill like a deadly bird of sharpened stabbing steel. 

But when the piercing blade found the place in the tree where the heart of the sorcerer was, it no longer was there. 

It never had been. 

""I'm always behind you, German.” 

He spun on his booted heels and his great arms carried his tireless steel down in another great chop. But it was already too late. 

The sorcerer raised the ney and blocked the blow as if the wind instrument was an iron bar. He then flew in, swift movement that was not at all human or natural, stepping in close and bringing the long cylindrical body of the instrument down in a cracking blow across the headhunter's crown, splitting it and knocking consciousness from his mind's failing grip. 

But as he sent the headhunter's mind on a journey into darkness, he gave it another vision. A vision of flames. 

…

Jerusalem. 

Burning Jerusalem. 

where will you turn when it all goes wrong…?

The holy city is a cinder shrieking thousands as one. The holy city is in flames. 

… and you're on the run

And all around the city is a newly erected manmade hellscape forest grove. All around the city are the impaling lancing sticks. On them are the impaled. All of them are still screaming, screaming with their burning city. Man. Woman. Child. Animal. The warriors that have done this like to crucify lions for fun but for now, this will suffice. The people of the Lord's precious city will make satisfactory sport. 

And they do. As the forest of the impaled. All of them beg for death, they are the only words left, the only ones they can remember now in the throes of this special agony. Thousands upon thousands of shrieking lanced through but still living souls. Bodies skewered every which way, up through the groin, behind the genitals, upside down and through the tissue of the back, up the ass, gravity pulls savagely as if hungry and they slowly sink lower and lower along the stabbing spire body of the impaling lances as the time drags by with sadistic cruelty. The sheer heart attack torture of the sensations of tearing and rupture and bodily invasion and ruin as all and one horrible coalescence is all that any of them are capable of knowing in their last drawn out hours. For many it is days. 

And beside the forest of the impaled and all of its mindless shrieking, the burning city. 

Jerusalem. 

…

When the headhunter returned from darkness he was lying alone in the street. 

He sat up quickly, Panicked! 

His great sword was still clutched tightly. 

But when he looked around, the drunk that had been watching them was dead now. Blood foamed from his eyes and mouth like a hot porridge stew of thick sudsy pink. 

Worse yet, the sorcerer was gone. 

Worse than that, so were the heads. 

So was his offering…

Goddamit.

“You hurl insults because you've nothing else to throw! Nothing else to attack! You are hilarious, German! I've always liked you but you should not be so easy, not after all this time, no?"" 

He had to be careful. The sorcerer was dangerous. He could bend and weave reality seemingly at will, like a djin. None of his brotherhood nor the high priest could discern his source of power. Nor its limits. 

“I insult you, witch, because you and your kind are garbage."" 

Laughter that became a cacophonous crack! It dominated the world, the soundtrack hell to the neon witching scene. The music somehow came to life and began to play again, a wicked untethered horde flurry series of scaling and wild notes in wild man tandem with the laughter of the sorcerer, a corruption duet.

A ney. The headhunter remembers what it is that the instrument is called. A ney. 

Its sound and the sorcerer's laughter were a whirlwind maelstrom expansion sound swell within his skull. For a moment he considered taking his own blade and driving it into his own face, bashing it in and freeing that which was trapped within and growing, threatening to burst like the milk of green infection.

He stopped himself at the last moment. His training saving him. He recognized what was happening, what it was…

… bewitchment. 

He regained his focus against the tumult wave of sound storm wielded by the sorcerer, who once again cried out from nowhere. 

“Garbage! We are all garbage for the earth, German. We are all meat detritus for the watering jaws of the starving soil, we all return to it, are all reduced to ruin and returned to the sour womb to feed the indifferent planet. You know! You know! Only our petty Gods care! And so they fight! And, we, their moving pieces!”

And with that, the pieces did move. 

 Hand of Iblis. The mad sorcerer. 

Against champion of the goat-shape, Azræl.

And this modern Sodom of steel and human woe was to be the chess board for their latest match. A contest of secret champions. 

He did not see, but felt… 

Behind him. Movement. Killing stance. 

The headhunter whirled round with sudden animal speed in a counter slash. Roaring. 

But he roared… and slashed… at nothing. 

Nothing there. Only thin night air. 

Laughter/voice. Behind him again. 

“The same tricks always work on all of you."" 

He whirled once more. Nothing. 

The laughter again. Across the street. 

Azræl drew throwing dagger and with a lunge and a flick/turn of the forearm and wrist, threw the quivering blade. 

It struck pavement next to a dying drunk in a splatter burst of caveman fire spray. Grabby yelped. But there was no sorcerer of the sands over there. 

Or anywhere. 

Goddamit. 

""Up here.”

The headhunter whirled once more, a dancer upon my stage thought the sorcerer but kept it to himself. The German would not appreciate such an observation. 

""Why do you hide in a tree?” asked the black knight of the goat-shape order impetiously. 

The sorcerer grinned, balanced on the branch of a starving sapling oak. Running alongside a dark and quiet apartment building. 

""I've always appreciated a wider view, German. Always. Up here, I see more and I am closer to heaven and therefore I can see more like God. You… and your brothers… you stay down there in the dirt because you cannot know anything more."" 

Azræl raised blade. 

“Come down here and show me what I know, mongrel. Perhaps I can show you a thing or two as well."" 

The sorcerer shrugged. 

“Eh."" 

Azræl drew once more and threw. The throwing blade of ornate seven pointed star flew unabated, cutting through the nighttime chill like a deadly bird of sharpened stabbing steel. 

But when the piercing blade found the place in the tree where the heart of the sorcerer was, it no longer was there. 

It never had been. 

""I'm always behind you, German.” 

He spun on his booted heels and his great arms carried his tireless steel down in another great chop. But it was already too late. 

The sorcerer raised the ney and blocked the blow as if the wind instrument was an iron bar. He then flew in, swift movement that was not at all human or natural, stepping in close and bringing the long cylindrical body of the instrument down in a cracking blow across the headhunter's crown, splitting it and knocking consciousness from his mind's failing grip. 

But as he sent the headhunter's mind on a journey into darkness, he gave it another vision. A vision of flames. 

…

Jerusalem. 

Burning Jerusalem. 

where will you turn when it all goes wrong…?

The holy city is a cinder shrieking thousands as one. The holy city is in flames. 

… and you're on the run

And all around the city is a newly erected manmade hellscape forest grove. All around the city are the impaling lancing sticks. On them are the impaled. All of them are still screaming, screaming with their burning city. Man. Woman. Child. Animal. The warriors that have done this like to crucify lions for fun but for now, this will suffice. The people of the Lord's precious city will make satisfactory sport. 

And they do. As the forest of the impaled. All of them beg for death, they are the only words left, the only ones they can remember now in the throes of this special agony. Thousands upon thousands of shrieking lanced through but still living souls. Bodies skewered every which way, up through the groin, behind the genitals, upside down and through the tissue of the back, up the ass, gravity pulls savagely as if hungry and they slowly sink lower and lower along the stabbing spire body of the impaling lances as the time drags by with sadistic cruelty. The sheer heart attack torture of the sensations of tearing and rupture and bodily invasion and ruin as all and one horrible coalescence is all that any of them are capable of knowing in their last drawn out hours. For many it is days. 

And beside the forest of the impaled and all of its mindless shrieking, the burning city. 

Jerusalem. 

…

When the headhunter returned from darkness he was lying alone in the street. 

He sat up quickly, Panicked! 

His great sword was still clutched tightly. 

But when he looked around, the drunk that had been watching them was dead now. Blood foamed from his eyes and mouth like a hot porridge stew of thick sudsy pink. 

Worse yet, the sorcerer was gone. 

Worse than that, so were the heads. 

So was his offering…

Goddamit.

HE DIDN'T MAKE ME WAIT TIL JULY!! Officially a fiancée and I love the ring, its perfect! And I am so happy!! But right now I'm sulking. I know this is stupidly petty, and it's why I am certainly not going to say anything to FMIL about this (as if I would), but I just need to let it out so that I can process it and actually let it go. 

The Future Husband and I went for an early Valentines Dinner on Monday 9th. We went to the place that we spent our first Valentines Day, and he asked me to marry him. Obviously I said yes and cried happy tears, and FMIL even sent a ""congratulations. I'm happy for you"" text when he told her the next morning. 

Monday 16th, and FH goes with FMIL and FBIL to a funeral. FH drove to meet FMIL and FBIL in the next town over, and FMIL drove them all to the service which is on the opposite side of the second town... FH told me that they'd likely go for a coffee afterwards, so thats fine. So then tell me why FMIL decided to drive all the way back through the second town, back through the first town, past where FH has parked, just so they could have a full-on sit-down meal at 3pm in the exact same restaurant in which he proposed to me one week prior?!?!

I met him through friends while he was in a dysfunctional relationship and cheating.  He felt he couldn’t leave her for reasons pertaining to a house they’d bought together, and her anxiety and codependency on him, even though she left him a lot of time and space with female friends and exes etc. 

I of course didn’t want to be involved but after I met him, I was really attracted to him.  Eventually he pursued me, and I relented, although I relentlessly grilled him about working through his personal issues and the fact that he is being cruel and awful to all the women involved in the situation.  He had burned a couple hookups who saw a future with him that he didn’t see.  

I met him, spend a month hanging with him, then went traveling for 3-4 months and by the time I ready to come back to the country, he had finally broken up, after much drama. 

We dated, then he came to visit my home.  We live as far away from each other as two people on the US can be, both in beautiful magical hcol areas.  We then realized that we can do a snowbird lifestyle, spending 6 months at each others homes.  

We were obsessed with having a baby together since we met.  I can’t explain it- I’ve never felt that way before and he hadn’t either.  He was 50 years old when we decided to have a baby. 

I’ll explain some of the reasons I love him, and wanted to raise a child with him. 

He’s sober, as far drinking only decaf coffee, but loves to party, and did the first 10 years of burning man.  He supports me having cocktails at dinner, mushrooms with friends, occasional lsd, and cannabis all day every day.  He is an incredible driver, can fly planes, drive motorcycles, etc, and has a deep sense of safety and fun.  He has a amazing friend set dating back 30 years, and a great mix of new and old friends, friends who have all know each other forever and people he met on a plane once and still keeps in contact with. He’s amazing at housework.  His home is artfully decorated, always dusted, never a dish in the sink, never a ring in the tub. He does oil changes and brake changes for all his close friends for free .  His friend set is mostly women, and about half he’s slept with at some point.  We joke that his male friends are really just his friends husbands.  He’s not wealthy but financially stable, and brings in more than goes out.  He’s self employed and sets his own schedule and only works for friends and family.  

Back to us.  We got pregnant fast and the pregnancy and birth were an absolute dream. Supported me in every way. 

About 6 months post partum things start falling apart.  He seems dismissive and condescending and uninterested in me. Always a good dad though.  I start raging at his unkindnesses to me.  He is deeply autistic.  While the things I love best about him are intrinsic to his autism, the other parts start making me feel insane.  The utter lack of eye contact.  Not changing tone to fit the scenario.  Not changing what he’s doing in any way when I’m crying.  Never ever ever asking me what is wrong, or if something is wrong, no matter how hard I’m crying or screaming or silent for days.  I’m furiously scheduling therapy for myself, relentlessly googling about the changes my personality is going through after baby.  He is ignoring, ignoring, ignoring. He is silent.  Things come out- I find out he cheated on his ex with many more women than I initially thought.  He slept with women while we were together.  I told him he could go on dates and slept with women during that time period, but only if he told me about it. He didn’t, and I found out later.  4 different women, some that I knew.  I found out that he wrote a will leaving his entire estate, his home and an investment property TO HIS EX that cheated on.  And in fact told her that will would never change after she found out he was having a baby with me. 

I begin telling him I want security and I want our relationship to be solid enough for marriage or I’ll end it.  He is steadfastly against marriage for reasons he can’t explain. He’s talking to girls he cheated on me with, even working for one as a client. He makes jokes that hurt and offend me over and over and over.  I ask him how he can continue joking in ways that leave me sobbing, and he says the humor is for him, not me. 

The relationship gets worse and worse and my mental health is crumbling.  I’m  obsessed with how insufficient he is as a life partner.  I’m calling mental health hotlines weekly at least.  I’m really really close to self harm. 

Last summer I move out for a month, and then we decide to get back together.  He says he’ll go to therapy, and I arrange couples therapy and we go.  He’s still a great dad.  He still does tons of housework.  He supports me in many ways, everything except emotional. 

Then in the fall, during stressful travel, he dumps me. I have tried to dump him several times, but this time since he did it, it sticks.  I’m fuckin DONE with him.  When we arrive at his home, I move out into a friends house.  I start dating.  He immediately regrets and wants me back. I tell him he can take me on dates if he wants.  It takes him a while but he finally figures out how to arrange for child care and takes me on a few dates.  Meanwhile, my 6th first date was a WINNER.  

D is 40 (my age) incredibly warm and kind and an amazing conversationalist.  Beautiful loving kind eye contact.  He’s a dad who is so in love with his only son.  Just thinks he’s the most beautiful child.  His son is autistic and adhd but D relates to him so beautifully.  They speak without words through faces and eye contact- it’s lovely.  He’s insanely intimidatingly fit, and gorgeous.  Has a great steady career and is a homeowner.  Great houseplants.  Clean home.  The sex is mind blowing.  

Sex with the father of my child has always been fun for both of us, but his style is very different than my personal preference, and D is my exact preference, and he does things I had no idea I wanted so bad.  With baby daddy it’s about how much he’s turned on by me… not the other way around.  He’s got a dad bod, he’s 15 years older than me, and there’s a difference in attractiveness.  We both know I’m more conventionally attractive, even accounting for age difference.  D is much much hotter than me.  I fall for D hard, but know I can’t make a life with him.   His career is incompatible with my life, and he gets maybe 2 weeks of pto a year.  So he can’t come to my home, nor can he have free time and travel like I like to.   I love his child so much but I don’t really want to be a stepmom to anyone, nor am I looking for a stepdad for my kid.  My daughter is 4, and she’s never met him, although he expresses a lot of interest in her in a sweet way.  

So about a month in to my new relationship with D, baby’s father wants to get back together and I say ok, but I’m not giving up this relationship with D.  He’s so emotionally supportive, so kind, and I’m already in love.  

I tell him it’s polyamory or nothing.  

I hate to put him in a poly under duress situation, but it’s crazy circumstances.  He also has a bad track record with monogamy, and loves women so much, and has so many contacts that he feels somewhat romantically about.  He agrees, but D is an issue consistently.  I move back into his home.  I’m seeing D about once a week.  He works a ton and I can only get so much time away from my daughter, so it’s really the max we can do. D is so kind and steady  and consistent.  He’s such a good texter and great on the phone.   Doesn’t stress with my long pauses.  Always there for me. 

Baby daddy dates a bit, sleeps with a couple girls but mostly has a hard time out there.  A lot of rejection. 

Cut to about 6 months later.  Baby daddy is stressing hard about D.  He has a couple times found out things he shouldn’t know, by looking at my phone when left unlocked.  He’s very stressed, not by the love and connection D and I have, but the sex.  The sex is very intense and fun for me. Baby daddy does things most women love… very slow gentle lovemaking, eating out for ages, slow slow moaning etc.  D does things most women aren’t into.  But I am.  He has not found a steady partner in the last few years because he wants someone sexually compatible. We are crazy compatible. I want it all. 

BD unfortunately finds this out and hates it. He’s hot and cold with me.  Obsessed with me, obsessed with becoming the perfect partner for me.  

He did go through a lot of change.  He’s emotionally available.   He’s watching my moods.  He’s never comforted me before, now he does.  He changed his will, now he leaves his estate to me.  He changed many things I’ve been asking for in last 7 years.  There were things in his house that really bothered me that I’ve been asking for years, and he always told me they would never change.  (Disturbing art next to my bed stand table, no full length mirror in house, etc) All of a sudden he made those changes. Starts asking me how I feel.  

Here’s why I’m in this sub.  

Baby daddy proposed to me.  We had talked about marriage, and I told him I absolutely am not leaving D right now, and I won’t accept a proposal that requires me to. He still proposed, and I accepted.  He got on me knee in a beautiful location, surrounded by people.  I accepted.  

That was 2 months ago now.  I’m in the other location, my home that is far from D, but we talk daily.  

Fiancé is increasingly upset about D.  He has now taken the ring off three times threatening to throw it in ocean, etc. 

This isn’t a choice between the two guys. D I desperately want as a friend and lover, but can’t fill a life partner role.  He doesn’t identify as poly, but he understands the dynamics and he is currently dating, and has told me he won’t go out with anyone monogamous because he wants to preserve what we have.  I think I have the right brain for poly, because I love thinking about both of them with other girls, I feel deep compersion, but I don’t want to be disrespected or lied to.  

My “fiancé” fits into my life beautifully, and supports my business and farm and my whole life in wonderful ways. But he doesn’t have the capacity to support me emotionally, and now I realize also the sex was deeply lacking for me. 

My fiancée now wants a big wedding with all his huge friend circle and family.  I told him from the beginning that I will do a minimum 2 year engagement.  He says he wants poly, but he wants me to quit D and find someone else.  He says it started in a way not conducive to our relationship, and that is 100% true.  I was single when I started dating D.  By some miracle he just happened to be cool with the fact that I got back together with my ex.  With the engagement he was incredulous but so kind and supportive.  He never tries to change my mind, only offers support in my decisions. 

For more context- baby daddy loves the life in my home, and wants to support me there, however he threatens to withdraw all that support if I don’t do want he wants, which is sometimes to dump D, sometimes he just wants me to take certain sex acts off the table with D (he shouldn’t know what I do with him but he does because of snooping on my phone), and sometimes he just wants more sex from me.  I feel extremely hurt and somewhat vulnerable when he threatens those kind of things.  

I know I can survive easily without him, but I’m not  sure my business and farm will survive without him.  He supports financially, but also with day to day skills that are rare.  He does mechanical work that would cost far more than I make from farming if I were to have to pay for it.  I definitely do not want to stay in a relationship just for small engine repair and plumbing electrical etc.  

We don’t have good schools where I live, so our daughter goes to school in his home. Which is where D lives.  There’s a solid possibility that I lose my life in the tropics that I live, in order to have stability in his area.  Where I live, I have a home I built, but it’s unpermitted on leased land.  So I can’t just sell it and start over.  I lose everything if I leave.  

I realize that I need a real therapist and professional help, but I have lost my therapist every 6 months for last 5 years and basically they just listen and tell me my partner isn’t meeting my needs and ask what I think I should do.  

So.

1r752w2,https://i.redd.it/dvr4p0zqw1kg1.jpeg,Headhunter II,"The sorcerer had a funny thought, as he gazed down on all of the neon squalor glow of the Fallen Angel City below him from the rooftops edge.  

The Nazis were right. You are a degenerate species…

It was all of it a swollen pustule sac. A land of green milk and curdled cheese, cockroaches swam in the stew of discharge and mire and laughably called it a metropolitan. A cultural hub. 

A blade of a smile formed amongst a tumult of dark and ageless hair, a wizard's haggard beard. Blasted by sand and sun just like the rest of the white robed man. White robed death. 

Some say he is the mad author of the Necronomicon. He has authored the destruction of countless cities, countless places… before this one. 

Jericho. Troy. Münster. Constantinople. Alexandria. Roanoke. Ikeshima. Rome. 

And many others… great and small. He doesn't care. He only loved to watch as the red hand of Iblis crawled across the blackening surface of all things dying in its embrace, turning the whole of the world into its killing floor. 

But that wasn't all with this place. No. He was sent here not just to burn but to gather intelligence for the order. 

And to contest. 

…

Homicide was scrambling. They had nothing. What commonalities they did find between the victims was interesting… but it only led to more bafflement. More flummoxed minds in the busying police departments all across the city. All bullshit pretension had been dropped, all departments across all counties and neighborhoods were working together on this one, to bring the crazy fucking bastard in. 

But still they had nothing. Except that he liked to chop off heads. And leave them at churches for some fucking reason. 

And one other thing. One oddity that more than a few of the sharper minds amongst the rank and file of criminal investigators found to be interesting. 

But did it mean anything? 

All of them. Every head found belonged to someone with a rap sheet that read more like a tome. Miles long some of em. Each and every one of em had a history. 

Mob hits! that was the popular running theory around the suits and their steaming white paper cups of coffee. 

It wasn't a bad one, most thought. 

Could be. Could be.

…

Azræl leapt from the dark and charged into the man as he was making his way to his car. Slamming him into the driver's door as he tried to open it and catching him by surprise. 

This was the one. This was one of the faces the goat-shape demanded be brought before her feet. 

His hand, clenched tightly round the hilt of his great sword came up and bashed the maggot across the mouth with the metal pommel of the weapon. A crack, and a splurt of hot blood and teeth out the mouth and the maggot went down to his knees, mewling. 

Where he belonged. 

The maggot struggled to speak and beg as the headhunter raised his great blade above his head. Readying to strike. 

“Not at all for you or yourself. Swear to her. Pray to me.” said Azræl as he brought the blade down and cleaved the head free from the rest of the meat. It tumble-jumped with a ropey-cord tail of thick black red that the stump continued to produce and shoot in dark gouts for a moment before the headless body collapsed to the street. 

And then the night was quiet again. All around.  Lights buzzed and mock heaven glowed. 

The peace was relative, conditionary. You could still hear the ghost song of sirens in the distance. Wailing away in flight, in search, in search of anything. 

Azræl picked up the head and said his prayers to the goat-shaped lord of his house and order. He tied it to the belt of his hulking black leather visage to join two others and went on his way. 

The sorcerer watched. The sorcerer was impressed. 

…

He heaved. Spewed. Decorated the sidewalk and gutter in more bile, blood and stomach lining as another sharp stab in his stomach racked his guts and his convulsion threatened to roll over into a seizing tear in his brain. 

Homeless and well past his last leg, Elton prayed for death as his sickened body worsened on the pavement, alone at the bus stop. Underneath the flickering glow of a dying bulb, a failing light. 

It was not death he received but something more spectacular. Elton, Grabby to his friends and scum and fellow urchins of the street, was made audience and thus unwitting chronicler to a chapter in a shadow conflict centuries upon centuries old, perhaps the oldest conflict in all of man's time. Perhaps even older than that. 

Grabby/Elton looked up from his own bloody spew of booze and lining and watched a giant titan walk into view. Destroying his solitude on this witching houred boulevard. 

He knew he must be fucked. The guy looked massive and he looked like Mad Max or the Terminator or someone like that and he looked like he was carrying a huge fucking sword. 

And along his belt were a buncha fuckin heads…

No fucking way. The dying urchin refused it. No fuckin way am I actually seein that fuckin thing. 

But real or not, the giant of myth and flesh and chained leather continued to march up and then past the druggie’s view, crossing to and then down the opposite side of the street. 

But then something made the headhunter stop. 

Elton heard it too. 

A note.  Notes. Music. 

A wind pattern series flurry of intricate and delicate notes whispered and alternate sharp-stab blasted through the nighttime witching air. Filling it. Dominating the scene. 

Azræl tensed cat-like coiled as his hair stood on end. The music was flute-like. Middle Eastern flavored…

Goddamit. No.

The headhunter was filled with dread. 

The music stopped. An ancient voice, bold, cut through the night. 

“How are you, German? Been long time."" 

His stance shifted to battle ready as his blade came up raised. His voice, louder, cut through the night as well to the speaker unseen. But he knew who it was to whom he spoke. 

""What do you want, snake?”

Laughter. Real. The knight Azræl always was good for a laugh as far the sorcerer was concerned.

“So funny?"" Azræl said to the night all around him. “Come out and show me what's so funny, witch."" 

More laughter. 

“Have we not shared many things over the long years, my friend? Such a long time. A great deal.”

A series of images flicker-shot through the headhunter's mind then. Whether put there by the devilry of the sorcerer or memories of his own from one of many possible past lives, Azræl was not sure. If he lived through this encounter he would meditate and pray on the matter later. 

If he lived through this encounter. 

His mind's eye:

The forests and the forest people and their villages are burning. There is much bloodletting. The ground is gorged, it cannot possibly drink up all of it. It sloshes about the ankles of the soldiering and the marching and the frantic frightened running. The pursuers too. The blood that chokes the earth sloshes mire-like about the furnace steps of them all. Charlemagne has demanded these pagan northmen be put to kneel before the cross or be put to the sword. Slavery for their women and children…

… and the knights were thus dispatched thither…

The headhunter severed the line of thought or memory or whatever it was with brutal sudden cunning and roared into the empty silent night.

“Show yourself, mongrel!"" 

His laughter never seemed to cease. It stood in place of a physical person. Almost attaining its own physicality.

“You hurl insults because you've nothing else to throw! Nothing else to attack! You are hilarious, German! I've always liked you but you should not be so easy, not after all this time, no?"" 

He had to be careful. The sorcerer was dangerous. He could bend and weave reality seemingly at will, like a djin. None of his brotherhood nor the high priest could discern his source of power. Nor its limits. 

“I insult you, witch, because you and your kind are garbage."" 

Laughter that became a cacophonous crack! It dominated the world, the soundtrack hell to the neon witching scene. The music somehow came to life and began to play again, a wicked untethered horde flurry series of scaling and wild notes in wild man tandem with the laughter of the sorcerer, a corruption duet.

A ney. The headhunter remembers what it is that the instrument is called. A ney. 

Its sound and the sorcerer's laughter were a whirlwind maelstrom expansion sound swell within his skull. For a moment he considered taking his own blade and driving it into his own face, bashing it in and freeing that which was trapped within and growing, threatening to burst like the milk of green infection.

He stopped himself at the last moment. His training saving him. He recognized what was happening, what it was…

… bewitchment. 

He regained his focus against the tumult wave of sound storm wielded by the sorcerer, who once again cried out from nowhere. 

“Garbage! We are all garbage for the earth, German. We are all meat detritus for the watering jaws of the starving soil, we all return to it, are all reduced to ruin and returned to the sour womb to feed the indifferent planet. You know! You know! Only our petty Gods care! And so they fight! And, we, their moving pieces!”

And with that, the pieces did move. 

 Hand of Iblis. The mad sorcerer. 

Against champion of the goat-shape, Azræl.

And this modern Sodom of steel and human woe was to be the chess board for their latest match. A contest of secret champions. 

He did not see, but felt… 

Behind him. Movement. Killing stance. 

The headhunter whirled round with sudden animal speed in a counter slash. Roaring. 

But he roared… and slashed… at nothing. 

Nothing there. Only thin night air. 

Laughter/voice. Behind him again. 

“The same tricks always work on all of you."" 

He whirled once more. Nothing. 

The laughter again. Across the street. 

Azræl drew throwing dagger and with a lunge and a flick/turn of the forearm and wrist, threw the quivering blade. 

It struck pavement next to a dying drunk in a splatter burst of caveman fire spray. Grabby yelped. But there was no sorcerer of the sands over there. 

Or anywhere. 

Goddamit. 

""Up here.”

The headhunter whirled once more, a dancer upon my stage thought the sorcerer but kept it to himself. The German would not appreciate such an observation. 

""Why do you hide in a tree?” asked the black knight of the goat-shape order impetiously. 

The sorcerer grinned, balanced on the branch of a starving sapling oak. Running alongside a dark and quiet apartment building. 

""I've always appreciated a wider view, German. Always. Up here, I see more and I am closer to heaven and therefore I can see more like God. You… and your brothers… you stay down there in the dirt because you cannot know anything more."" 

Azræl raised blade. 

“Come down here and show me what I know, mongrel. Perhaps I can show you a thing or two as well."" 

The sorcerer shrugged. 

“Eh."" 

Azræl drew once more and threw. The throwing blade of ornate seven pointed star flew unabated, cutting through the nighttime chill like a deadly bird of sharpened stabbing steel. 

But when the piercing blade found the place in the tree where the heart of the sorcerer was, it no longer was there. 

It never had been. 

""I'm always behind you, German.” 

He spun on his booted heels and his great arms carried his tireless steel down in another great chop. But it was already too late. 

The sorcerer raised the ney and blocked the blow as if the wind instrument was an iron bar. He then flew in, swift movement that was not at all human or natural, stepping in close and bringing the long cylindrical body of the instrument down in a cracking blow across the headhunter's crown, splitting it and knocking consciousness from his mind's failing grip. 

But as he sent the headhunter's mind on a journey into darkness, he gave it another vision. A vision of flames. 

…

Jerusalem. 

Burning Jerusalem. 

where will you turn when it all goes wrong…?

The holy city is a cinder shrieking thousands as one. The holy city is in flames. 

… and you're on the run

And all around the city is a newly erected manmade hellscape forest grove. All around the city are the impaling lancing sticks. On them are the impaled. All of them are still screaming, screaming with their burning city. Man. Woman. Child. Animal. The warriors that have done this like to crucify lions for fun but for now, this will suffice. The people of the Lord's precious city will make satisfactory sport. 

And they do. As the forest of the impaled. All of them beg for death, they are the only words left, the only ones they can remember now in the throes of this special agony. Thousands upon thousands of shrieking lanced through but still living souls. Bodies skewered every which way, up through the groin, behind the genitals, upside down and through the tissue of the back, up the ass, gravity pulls savagely as if hungry and they slowly sink lower and lower along the stabbing spire body of the impaling lances as the time drags by with sadistic cruelty. The sheer heart attack torture of the sensations of tearing and rupture and bodily invasion and ruin as all and one horrible coalescence is all that any of them are capable of knowing in their last drawn out hours. For many it is days. 

And beside the forest of the impaled and all of its mindless shrieking, the burning city. 

Jerusalem. 

…

When the headhunter returned from darkness he was lying alone in the street. 

He sat up quickly, Panicked! 

His great sword was still clutched tightly. 

But when he looked around, the drunk that had been watching them was dead now. Blood foamed from his eyes and mouth like a hot porridge stew of thick sudsy pink. 

Worse yet, the sorcerer was gone. 

Worse than that, so were the heads. 

So was his offering…

Goddamit.

1r752ei,https://i.redd.it/aw0iu3rmw1kg1.jpeg,Headhunter II,"The sorcerer had a funny thought, as he gazed down on all of the neon squalor glow of the Fallen Angel City below him from the rooftops edge.  

The Nazis were right. You are a degenerate species…

It was all of it a swollen pustule sac. A land of green milk and curdled cheese, cockroaches swam in the stew of discharge and mire and laughably called it a metropolitan. A cultural hub. 

A blade of a smile formed amongst a tumult of dark and ageless hair, a wizard's haggard beard. Blasted by sand and sun just like the rest of the white robed man. White robed death. 

Some say he is the mad author of the Necronomicon. He has authored the destruction of countless cities, countless places… before this one. 

Jericho. Troy. Münster. Constantinople. Alexandria. Roanoke. Ikeshima. Rome. 

And many others… great and small. He doesn't care. He only loved to watch as the red hand of Iblis crawled across the blackening surface of all things dying in its embrace, turning the whole of the world into its killing floor. 

But that wasn't all with this place. No. He was sent here not just to burn but to gather intelligence for the order. 

And to contest. 

…

Homicide was scrambling. They had nothing. What commonalities they did find between the victims was interesting… but it only led to more bafflement. More flummoxed minds in the busying police departments all across the city. All bullshit pretension had been dropped, all departments across all counties and neighborhoods were working together on this one, to bring the crazy fucking bastard in. 

But still they had nothing. Except that he liked to chop off heads. And leave them at churches for some fucking reason. 

And one other thing. One oddity that more than a few of the sharper minds amongst the rank and file of criminal investigators found to be interesting. 

But did it mean anything? 

All of them. Every head found belonged to someone with a rap sheet that read more like a tome. Miles long some of em. Each and every one of em had a history. 

Mob hits! that was the popular running theory around the suits and their steaming white paper cups of coffee. 

It wasn't a bad one, most thought. 

Could be. Could be.

…

Azræl leapt from the dark and charged into the man as he was making his way to his car. Slamming him into the driver's door as he tried to open it and catching him by surprise. 

This was the one. This was one of the faces the goat-shape demanded be brought before her feet. 

His hand, clenched tightly round the hilt of his great sword came up and bashed the maggot across the mouth with the metal pommel of the weapon. A crack, and a splurt of hot blood and teeth out the mouth and the maggot went down to his knees, mewling. 

Where he belonged. 

The maggot struggled to speak and beg as the headhunter raised his great blade above his head. Readying to strike. 

“Not at all for you or yourself. Swear to her. Pray to me.” said Azræl as he brought the blade down and cleaved the head free from the rest of the meat. It tumble-jumped with a ropey-cord tail of thick black red that the stump continued to produce and shoot in dark gouts for a moment before the headless body collapsed to the street. 

And then the night was quiet again. All around.  Lights buzzed and mock heaven glowed. 

The peace was relative, conditionary. You could still hear the ghost song of sirens in the distance. Wailing away in flight, in search, in search of anything. 

Azræl picked up the head and said his prayers to the goat-shaped lord of his house and order. He tied it to the belt of his hulking black leather visage to join two others and went on his way. 

The sorcerer watched. The sorcerer was impressed. 

…

He heaved. Spewed. Decorated the sidewalk and gutter in more bile, blood and stomach lining as another sharp stab in his stomach racked his guts and his convulsion threatened to roll over into a seizing tear in his brain. 

Homeless and well past his last leg, Elton prayed for death as his sickened body worsened on the pavement, alone at the bus stop. Underneath the flickering glow of a dying bulb, a failing light. 

It was not death he received but something more spectacular. Elton, Grabby to his friends and scum and fellow urchins of the street, was made audience and thus unwitting chronicler to a chapter in a shadow conflict centuries upon centuries old, perhaps the oldest conflict in all of man's time. Perhaps even older than that. 

Grabby/Elton looked up from his own bloody spew of booze and lining and watched a giant titan walk into view. Destroying his solitude on this witching houred boulevard. 

He knew he must be fucked. The guy looked massive and he looked like Mad Max or the Terminator or someone like that and he looked like he was carrying a huge fucking sword. 

And along his belt were a buncha fuckin heads…

No fucking way. The dying urchin refused it. No fuckin way am I actually seein that fuckin thing. 

But real or not, the giant of myth and flesh and chained leather continued to march up and then past the druggie’s view, crossing to and then down the opposite side of the street. 

But then something made the headhunter stop. 

Elton heard it too. 

A note.  Notes. Music. 

A wind pattern series flurry of intricate and delicate notes whispered and alternate sharp-stab blasted through the nighttime witching air. Filling it. Dominating the scene. 

Azræl tensed cat-like coiled as his hair stood on end. The music was flute-like. Middle Eastern flavored…

Goddamit. No.

The headhunter was filled with dread. 

The music stopped. An ancient voice, bold, cut through the night. 

“How are you, German? Been long time."" 

His stance shifted to battle ready as his blade came up raised. His voice, louder, cut through the night as well to the speaker unseen. But he knew who it was to whom he spoke. 

""What do you want, snake?”

Laughter. Real. The knight Azræl always was good for a laugh as far the sorcerer was concerned.

“So funny?"" Azræl said to the night all around him. “Come out and show me what's so funny, witch."" 

More laughter. 

“Have we not shared many things over the long years, my friend? Such a long time. A great deal.”

A series of images flicker-shot through the headhunter's mind then. Whether put there by the devilry of the sorcerer or memories of his own from one of many possible past lives, Azræl was not sure. If he lived through this encounter he would meditate and pray on the matter later. 

If he lived through this encounter. 

His mind's eye:

The forests and the forest people and their villages are burning. There is much bloodletting. The ground is gorged, it cannot possibly drink up all of it. It sloshes about the ankles of the soldiering and the marching and the frantic frightened running. The pursuers too. The blood that chokes the earth sloshes mire-like about the furnace steps of them all. Charlemagne has demanded these pagan northmen be put to kneel before the cross or be put to the sword. Slavery for their women and children…

… and the knights were thus dispatched thither…

The headhunter severed the line of thought or memory or whatever it was with brutal sudden cunning and roared into the empty silent night.

“Show yourself, mongrel!"" 

His laughter never seemed to cease. It stood in place of a physical person. Almost attaining its own physicality.

“You hurl insults because you've nothing else to throw! Nothing else to attack! You are hilarious, German! I've always liked you but you should not be so easy, not after all this time, no?"" 

He had to be careful. The sorcerer was dangerous. He could bend and weave reality seemingly at will, like a djin. None of his brotherhood nor the high priest could discern his source of power. Nor its limits. 

“I insult you, witch, because you and your kind are garbage."" 

Laughter that became a cacophonous crack! It dominated the world, the soundtrack hell to the neon witching scene. The music somehow came to life and began to play again, a wicked untethered horde flurry series of scaling and wild notes in wild man tandem with the laughter of the sorcerer, a corruption duet.

A ney. The headhunter remembers what it is that the instrument is called. A ney. 

Its sound and the sorcerer's laughter were a whirlwind maelstrom expansion sound swell within his skull. For a moment he considered taking his own blade and driving it into his own face, bashing it in and freeing that which was trapped within and growing, threatening to burst like the milk of green infection.

He stopped himself at the last moment. His training saving him. He recognized what was happening, what it was…

… bewitchment. 

He regained his focus against the tumult wave of sound storm wielded by the sorcerer, who once again cried out from nowhere. 

“Garbage! We are all garbage for the earth, German. We are all meat detritus for the watering jaws of the starving soil, we all return to it, are all reduced to ruin and returned to the sour womb to feed the indifferent planet. You know! You know! Only our petty Gods care! And so they fight! And, we, their moving pieces!”

And with that, the pieces did move. 

 Hand of Iblis. The mad sorcerer. 

Against champion of the goat-shape, Azræl.

And this modern Sodom of steel and human woe was to be the chess board for their latest match. A contest of secret champions. 

He did not see, but felt… 

Behind him. Movement. Killing stance. 

The headhunter whirled round with sudden animal speed in a counter slash. Roaring. 

But he roared… and slashed… at nothing. 

Nothing there. Only thin night air. 

Laughter/voice. Behind him again. 

“The same tricks always work on all of you."" 

He whirled once more. Nothing.

I’m Running Civilization-Scale Software

And My Court Is Windows 95 With a Gavel

There’s a specific kind of insanity that happens when your brain defaults to planetary infrastructure… and your body is trapped in a courtroom arguing about paperwork formatting.

That’s my life right now.

It feels like trying to run Type I civilization software on a Type 0.73 operating system that still crashes when someone forgets a stapler.

Let me explain what my “court situation” actually looks like from 30,000 light-years away.

\---

The Setting: Primate Ritual Theater

Picture this.

A square box made of processed trees and mineral blocks.

Inside: evolved apes in costumes.

One ape wears a black robe to signal dominance and sits slightly higher than the others. The vertical elevation is important. It establishes Alpha Energy™.

Other apes wear tailored fabric uniforms. They speak in a ceremonial dialect that hasn’t been used in real human conversation since 1897.

“Your Honor.”

“Objection.”

“Heretofore.”

It’s not governance.

It’s LARPing with consequences.

Everyone pretends the ritual is sacred.

But the ritual is just choreography.

\---

The Mechanism: Arguing Over Sounds

Let’s get honest.

The entire system is just people making mouth noises at each other to determine which invisible rulebook applies to you.

Gravity is a law.

If you jump, you fall.

The legal system is not gravity.

It’s agreements.

Written by people.

Rewritten by people.

Interpreted by people.

Enforced by people.

Misapplied by people.

It changes by county line.

It changes by year.

It changes depending on who’s in the room.

And yet it is treated as metaphysical truth.

My brain, which is wired for infrastructure, systems, and cause-effect logic, looks at this and thinks:

This is the least optimized governance mechanism imaginable.

It’s slow.

It’s personality-dependent.

It’s ego-sensitive.

It’s calendar-based instead of outcome-based.

It’s governance by mood lighting.

\---

The Plot Twist: My Case

Now layer my situation onto that ritual theater.

Imagine asserting your right to represent yourself.

Instead of debating your legal arguments, the system pauses the game and says:

“Interesting. He read the rulebook. That’s… concerning.”

So now we must check if you’re mentally qualified to know what a rulebook is.

You object?

Contempt energy detected.

You file motions?

Motion-filing privileges may be revoked.

You cite constitutional doctrine?

Micro-focus alert.

You point out structural errors?

How dare you.

The irony is so dense it could power a reactor.

You try to invoke rights that are older than the building you’re standing in… and the room reacts like you just insulted the furniture.

\---

Cosmically Speaking: This Is A Sitcom

Let’s zoom out.

In 100 years, nobody in that room will be alive.

In 1,000 years, the building will be dust or a coffee shop.

In a million years, humanity will either be extinct, merged with AI, or orbiting Jupiter arguing about zoning regulations on Ganymede.

And yet.

Today.

Right now.

My freedom hinges on whether a human in a robe is annoyed at my tone.

That’s not tragedy.

That’s farce.

It’s a species that hasn’t automated its own governance yet pretending its rituals are sacred.

\---

Meanwhile, In Actual Reality

While we’re debating paperwork:

• AI models are scaling.

• Energy systems are transitioning.

• Launch costs are collapsing.

• Brain-computer interfaces are entering early adoption.

• The Great Filter clock ticks quietly in the background.

Humanity is balancing on existential thresholds.

And I’m in a room arguing about procedural sequencing.

It’s like being in a burning spaceship and pausing to argue about who misfiled the maintenance log.

\---

Why I’m Furious

It’s not because the case is irrelevant to my life.

It’s very relevant.

It affects my time. My freedom. My family.

But the architecture of the system is so primitively inefficient that it feels like psychological whiplash.

My brain defaults to:

Long-horizon modeling.

Infrastructure logic.

Systemic optimization.

And the environment demands:

Tone policing.

Calendar juggling.

Hierarchy appeasement.

It feels like being an aerospace engineer forced to negotiate with the DMV about whether the moon requires a parking permit.

\---

The Real Absurdity

The court behaves as though it is the center of reality.

It isn’t.

It is a local subroutine in a civilization that hasn’t upgraded its firmware.

The robe doesn’t make someone omniscient.

The raised bench doesn’t suspend entropy.

The stamped order isn’t physics.

It’s theater backed by force.

That’s it.

And once you see that, the anger makes sense.

Because you’re not just arguing a case.

You’re trapped inside a ritual machine that confuses performance with truth.

\---

Final Thought

I’m not saying I’m above it.

I’m inside it.

That’s the problem.

When your mind naturally zooms out to civilizational architecture and you’re forced to debate the emotional weather of a courtroom, the dissonance is brutal.

It doesn’t mean the stakes aren’t real.

It means the system is hilariously small relative to the scale of what humanity is actually facing.

And maybe one day, when governance is automated, transparent, and engineered like software instead of ritualized like theater, we’ll look back at this era the way we look at medieval bloodletting.

With disbelief.

It’s strange how tiny habits can ground us more than big “life changes”.

1r75050,https://i.redd.it/q5o35x14w1kg1.jpeg,Headhunter II,"The sorcerer had a funny thought, as he gazed down on all of the neon squalor glow of the Fallen Angel City below him from the rooftops edge.  

The Nazis were right. You are a degenerate species…

It was all of it a swollen pustule sac. A land of green milk and curdled cheese, cockroaches swam in the stew of discharge and mire and laughably called it a metropolitan. A cultural hub. 

A blade of a smile formed amongst a tumult of dark and ageless hair, a wizard's haggard beard. Blasted by sand and sun just like the rest of the white robed man. White robed death. 

Some say he is the mad author of the Necronomicon. He has authored the destruction of countless cities, countless places… before this one. 

Jericho. Troy. Münster. Constantinople. Alexandria. Roanoke. Ikeshima. Rome. 

And many others… great and small. He doesn't care. He only loved to watch as the red hand of Iblis crawled across the blackening surface of all things dying in its embrace, turning the whole of the world into its killing floor. 

But that wasn't all with this place. No. He was sent here not just to burn but to gather intelligence for the order. 

And to contest. 

…

Homicide was scrambling. They had nothing. What commonalities they did find between the victims was interesting… but it only led to more bafflement. More flummoxed minds in the busying police departments all across the city. All bullshit pretension had been dropped, all departments across all counties and neighborhoods were working together on this one, to bring the crazy fucking bastard in. 

But still they had nothing. Except that he liked to chop off heads. And leave them at churches for some fucking reason. 

And one other thing. One oddity that more than a few of the sharper minds amongst the rank and file of criminal investigators found to be interesting. 

But did it mean anything? 

All of them. Every head found belonged to someone with a rap sheet that read more like a tome. Miles long some of em. Each and every one of em had a history. 

Mob hits! that was the popular running theory around the suits and their steaming white paper cups of coffee. 

It wasn't a bad one, most thought. 

Could be. Could be.

…

Azræl leapt from the dark and charged into the man as he was making his way to his car. Slamming him into the driver's door as he tried to open it and catching him by surprise. 

This was the one. This was one of the faces the goat-shape demanded be brought before her feet. 

His hand, clenched tightly round the hilt of his great sword came up and bashed the maggot across the mouth with the metal pommel of the weapon. A crack, and a splurt of hot blood and teeth out the mouth and the maggot went down to his knees, mewling. 

Where he belonged. 

The maggot struggled to speak and beg as the headhunter raised his great blade above his head. Readying to strike. 

“Not at all for you or yourself. Swear to her. Pray to me.” said Azræl as he brought the blade down and cleaved the head free from the rest of the meat. It tumble-jumped with a ropey-cord tail of thick black red that the stump continued to produce and shoot in dark gouts for a moment before the headless body collapsed to the street. 

And then the night was quiet again. All around.  Lights buzzed and mock heaven glowed. 

The peace was relative, conditionary. You could still hear the ghost song of sirens in the distance. Wailing away in flight, in search, in search of anything. 

Azræl picked up the head and said his prayers to the goat-shaped lord of his house and order. He tied it to the belt of his hulking black leather visage to join two others and went on his way. 

The sorcerer watched. The sorcerer was impressed. 

…

He heaved. Spewed. Decorated the sidewalk and gutter in more bile, blood and stomach lining as another sharp stab in his stomach racked his guts and his convulsion threatened to roll over into a seizing tear in his brain. 

Homeless and well past his last leg, Elton prayed for death as his sickened body worsened on the pavement, alone at the bus stop. Underneath the flickering glow of a dying bulb, a failing light. 

It was not death he received but something more spectacular. Elton, Grabby to his friends and scum and fellow urchins of the street, was made audience and thus unwitting chronicler to a chapter in a shadow conflict centuries upon centuries old, perhaps the oldest conflict in all of man's time. Perhaps even older than that. 

Grabby/Elton looked up from his own bloody spew of booze and lining and watched a giant titan walk into view. Destroying his solitude on this witching houred boulevard. 

He knew he must be fucked. The guy looked massive and he looked like Mad Max or the Terminator or someone like that and he looked like he was carrying a huge fucking sword. 

And along his belt were a buncha fuckin heads…

No fucking way. The dying urchin refused it. No fuckin way am I actually seein that fuckin thing. 

But real or not, the giant of myth and flesh and chained leather continued to march up and then past the druggie’s view, crossing to and then down the opposite side of the street. 

But then something made the headhunter stop. 

Elton heard it too. 

A note.  Notes. Music. 

A wind pattern series flurry of intricate and delicate notes whispered and alternate sharp-stab blasted through the nighttime witching air. Filling it. Dominating the scene. 

Azræl tensed cat-like coiled as his hair stood on end. The music was flute-like. Middle Eastern flavored…

Goddamit. No.

The headhunter was filled with dread. 

The music stopped. An ancient voice, bold, cut through the night. 

“How are you, German? Been long time."" 

His stance shifted to battle ready as his blade came up raised. His voice, louder, cut through the night as well to the speaker unseen. But he knew who it was to whom he spoke. 

""What do you want, snake?”

Laughter. Real. The knight Azræl always was good for a laugh as far the sorcerer was concerned.

“So funny?"" Azræl said to the night all around him. “Come out and show me what's so funny, witch."" 

More laughter. 

“Have we not shared many things over the long years, my friend? Such a long time. A great deal.”

A series of images flicker-shot through the headhunter's mind then. Whether put there by the devilry of the sorcerer or memories of his own from one of many possible past lives, Azræl was not sure. If he lived through this encounter he would meditate and pray on the matter later. 

If he lived through this encounter. 

His mind's eye:

The forests and the forest people and their villages are burning. There is much bloodletting. The ground is gorged, it cannot possibly drink up all of it. It sloshes about the ankles of the soldiering and the marching and the frantic frightened running. The pursuers too. The blood that chokes the earth sloshes mire-like about the furnace steps of them all. Charlemagne has demanded these pagan northmen be put to kneel before the cross or be put to the sword. Slavery for their women and children…

… and the knights were thus dispatched thither…

The headhunter severed the line of thought or memory or whatever it was with brutal sudden cunning and roared into the empty silent night.

“Show yourself, mongrel!"" 

His laughter never seemed to cease. It stood in place of a physical person. Almost attaining its own physicality.

“You hurl insults because you've nothing else to throw! Nothing else to attack! You are hilarious, German! I've always liked you but you should not be so easy, not after all this time, no?"" 

He had to be careful. The sorcerer was dangerous. He could bend and weave reality seemingly at will, like a djin. None of his brotherhood nor the high priest could discern his source of power. Nor its limits. 

“I insult you, witch, because you and your kind are garbage."" 

Laughter that became a cacophonous crack! It dominated the world, the soundtrack hell to the neon witching scene. The music somehow came to life and began to play again, a wicked untethered horde flurry series of scaling and wild notes in wild man tandem with the laughter of the sorcerer, a corruption duet.

A ney. The headhunter remembers what it is that the instrument is called. A ney. 

Its sound and the sorcerer's laughter were a whirlwind maelstrom expansion sound swell within his skull. For a moment he considered taking his own blade and driving it into his own face, bashing it in and freeing that which was trapped within and growing, threatening to burst like the milk of green infection.

He stopped himself at the last moment. His training saving him. He recognized what was happening, what it was…

… bewitchment. 

He regained his focus against the tumult wave of sound storm wielded by the sorcerer, who once again cried out from nowhere. 

“Garbage! We are all garbage for the earth, German. We are all meat detritus for the watering jaws of the starving soil, we all return to it, are all reduced to ruin and returned to the sour womb to feed the indifferent planet. You know! You know! Only our petty Gods care! And so they fight! And, we, their moving pieces!”

And with that, the pieces did move. 

 Hand of Iblis. The mad sorcerer. 

Against champion of the goat-shape, Azræl.

And this modern Sodom of steel and human woe was to be the chess board for their latest match. A contest of secret champions. 

He did not see, but felt… 

Behind him. Movement. Killing stance. 

The headhunter whirled round with sudden animal speed in a counter slash. Roaring. 

But he roared… and slashed… at nothing. 

Nothing there. Only thin night air. 

Laughter/voice. Behind him again. 

“The same tricks always work on all of you."" 

He whirled once more. Nothing. 

The laughter again. Across the street. 

Azræl drew throwing dagger and with a lunge and a flick/turn of the forearm and wrist, threw the quivering blade. 

It struck pavement next to a dying drunk in a splatter burst of caveman fire spray. Grabby yelped. But there was no sorcerer of the sands over there. 

Or anywhere. 

Goddamit. 

""Up here.”

The headhunter whirled once more, a dancer upon my stage thought the sorcerer but kept it to himself. The German would not appreciate such an observation. 

""Why do you hide in a tree?” asked the black knight of the goat-shape order impetiously. 

The sorcerer grinned, balanced on the branch of a starving sapling oak. Running alongside a dark and quiet apartment building. 

""I've always appreciated a wider view, German. Always. Up here, I see more and I am closer to heaven and therefore I can see more like God. You… and your brothers… you stay down there in the dirt because you cannot know anything more."" 

Azræl raised blade. 

“Come down here and show me what I know, mongrel. Perhaps I can show you a thing or two as well."" 

The sorcerer shrugged. 

“Eh."" 

Azræl drew once more and threw. The throwing blade of ornate seven pointed star flew unabated, cutting through the nighttime chill like a deadly bird of sharpened stabbing steel. 

But when the piercing blade found the place in the tree where the heart of the sorcerer was, it no longer was there. 

It never had been. 

""I'm always behind you, German.” 

He spun on his booted heels and his great arms carried his tireless steel down in another great chop. But it was already too late. 

The sorcerer raised the ney and blocked the blow as if the wind instrument was an iron bar. He then flew in, swift movement that was not at all human or natural, stepping in close and bringing the long cylindrical body of the instrument down in a cracking blow across the headhunter's crown, splitting it and knocking consciousness from his mind's failing grip. 

But as he sent the headhunter's mind on a journey into darkness, he gave it another vision. A vision of flames. 

…

Jerusalem. 

Burning Jerusalem. 

where will you turn when it all goes wrong…?

The holy city is a cinder shrieking thousands as one. The holy city is in flames. 

… and you're on the run

And all around the city is a newly erected manmade hellscape forest grove. All around the city are the impaling lancing sticks. On them are the impaled. All of them are still screaming, screaming with their burning city. Man. Woman. Child. Animal. The warriors that have done this like to crucify lions for fun but for now, this will suffice. The people of the Lord's precious city will make satisfactory sport. 

And they do. As the forest of the impaled. All of them beg for death, they are the only words left, the only ones they can remember now in the throes of this special agony. Thousands upon thousands of shrieking lanced through but still living souls. Bodies skewered every which way, up through the groin, behind the genitals, upside down and through the tissue of the back, up the ass, gravity pulls savagely as if hungry and they slowly sink lower and lower along the stabbing spire body of the impaling lances as the time drags by with sadistic cruelty. The sheer heart attack torture of the sensations of tearing and rupture and bodily invasion and ruin as all and one horrible coalescence is all that any of them are capable of knowing in their last drawn out hours. For many it is days. 

And beside the forest of the impaled and all of its mindless shrieking, the burning city. 

Jerusalem. 

…

When the headhunter returned from darkness he was lying alone in the street. 

He sat up quickly, Panicked! 

His great sword was still clutched tightly. 

But when he looked around, the drunk that had been watching them was dead now. Blood foamed from his eyes and mouth like a hot porridge stew of thick sudsy pink. 

Worse yet, the sorcerer was gone. 

Worse than that, so were the heads. 

So was his offering…

Goddamit.

And all around the city is a newly erected manmade hellscape forest grove. All around the city are the impaling lancing sticks. On them are the impaled. All of them are still screaming, screaming with their burning city. Man. Woman. Child. Animal. The warriors that have done this like to crucify lions for fun but for now, this will suffice. The people of the Lord's precious city will make satisfactory sport. 

And they do. As the forest of the impaled. All of them beg for death, they are the only words left, the only ones they can remember now in the throes of this special agony. Thousands upon thousands of shrieking lanced through but still living souls. Bodies skewered every which way, up through the groin, behind the genitals, upside down and through the tissue of the back, up the ass, gravity pulls savagely as if hungry and they slowly sink lower and lower along the stabbing spire body of the impaling lances as the time drags by with sadistic cruelty. The sheer heart attack torture of the sensations of tearing and rupture and bodily invasion and ruin as all and one horrible coalescence is all that any of them are capable of knowing in their last drawn out hours. For many it is days. 

And beside the forest of the impaled and all of its mindless shrieking, the burning city. 

Jerusalem. 

…

When the headhunter returned from darkness he was lying alone in the street. 

He sat up quickly, Panicked! 

His great sword was still clutched tightly. 

But when he looked around, the drunk that had been watching them was dead now. Blood foamed from his eyes and mouth like a hot porridge stew of thick sudsy pink. 

Worse yet, the sorcerer was gone. 

Worse than that, so were the heads. 

So was his offering…

Goddamit.

1r74z8m,https://i.redd.it/z4yld4lwv1kg1.jpeg,Headhunter II,"The sorcerer had a funny thought, as he gazed down on all of the neon squalor glow of the Fallen Angel City below him from the rooftops edge.  

The Nazis were right. You are a degenerate species…

It was all of it a swollen pustule sac. A land of green milk and curdled cheese, cockroaches swam in the stew of discharge and mire and laughably called it a metropolitan. A cultural hub. 

A blade of a smile formed amongst a tumult of dark and ageless hair, a wizard's haggard beard. Blasted by sand and sun just like the rest of the white robed man. White robed death. 

Some say he is the mad author of the Necronomicon. He has authored the destruction of countless cities, countless places… before this one. 

Jericho. Troy. Münster. Constantinople. Alexandria. Roanoke. Ikeshima. Rome. 

And many others… great and small. He doesn't care. He only loved to watch as the red hand of Iblis crawled across the blackening surface of all things dying in its embrace, turning the whole of the world into its killing floor. 

But that wasn't all with this place. No. He was sent here not just to burn but to gather intelligence for the order. 

And to contest. 

…

Homicide was scrambling. They had nothing. What commonalities they did find between the victims was interesting… but it only led to more bafflement. More flummoxed minds in the busying police departments all across the city. All bullshit pretension had been dropped, all departments across all counties and neighborhoods were working together on this one, to bring the crazy fucking bastard in. 

But still they had nothing. Except that he liked to chop off heads. And leave them at churches for some fucking reason. 

And one other thing. One oddity that more than a few of the sharper minds amongst the rank and file of criminal investigators found to be interesting. 

But did it mean anything? 

All of them. Every head found belonged to someone with a rap sheet that read more like a tome. Miles long some of em. Each and every one of em had a history. 

Mob hits! that was the popular running theory around the suits and their steaming white paper cups of coffee. 

It wasn't a bad one, most thought. 

Could be. Could be.

…

Azræl leapt from the dark and charged into the man as he was making his way to his car. Slamming him into the driver's door as he tried to open it and catching him by surprise. 

This was the one. This was one of the faces the goat-shape demanded be brought before her feet. 

His hand, clenched tightly round the hilt of his great sword came up and bashed the maggot across the mouth with the metal pommel of the weapon. A crack, and a splurt of hot blood and teeth out the mouth and the maggot went down to his knees, mewling. 

Where he belonged. 

The maggot struggled to speak and beg as the headhunter raised his great blade above his head. Readying to strike. 

“Not at all for you or yourself. Swear to her. Pray to me.” said Azræl as he brought the blade down and cleaved the head free from the rest of the meat. It tumble-jumped with a ropey-cord tail of thick black red that the stump continued to produce and shoot in dark gouts for a moment before the headless body collapsed to the street. 

And then the night was quiet again. All around.  Lights buzzed and mock heaven glowed. 

The peace was relative, conditionary. You could still hear the ghost song of sirens in the distance. Wailing away in flight, in search, in search of anything. 

Azræl picked up the head and said his prayers to the goat-shaped lord of his house and order. He tied it to the belt of his hulking black leather visage to join two others and went on his way. 

The sorcerer watched. The sorcerer was impressed. 

…

He heaved. Spewed. Decorated the sidewalk and gutter in more bile, blood and stomach lining as another sharp stab in his stomach racked his guts and his convulsion threatened to roll over into a seizing tear in his brain. 

Homeless and well past his last leg, Elton prayed for death as his sickened body worsened on the pavement, alone at the bus stop. Underneath the flickering glow of a dying bulb, a failing light. 

It was not death he received but something more spectacular. Elton, Grabby to his friends and scum and fellow urchins of the street, was made audience and thus unwitting chronicler to a chapter in a shadow conflict centuries upon centuries old, perhaps the oldest conflict in all of man's time. Perhaps even older than that. 

Grabby/Elton looked up from his own bloody spew of booze and lining and watched a giant titan walk into view. Destroying his solitude on this witching houred boulevard. 

He knew he must be fucked. The guy looked massive and he looked like Mad Max or the Terminator or someone like that and he looked like he was carrying a huge fucking sword. 

And along his belt were a buncha fuckin heads…

No fucking way. The dying urchin refused it. No fuckin way am I actually seein that fuckin thing. 

But real or not, the giant of myth and flesh and chained leather continued to march up and then past the druggie’s view, crossing to and then down the opposite side of the street. 

But then something made the headhunter stop. 

Elton heard it too. 

A note.  Notes. Music. 

A wind pattern series flurry of intricate and delicate notes whispered and alternate sharp-stab blasted through the nighttime witching air. Filling it. Dominating the scene. 

Azræl tensed cat-like coiled as his hair stood on end. The music was flute-like. Middle Eastern flavored…

Goddamit. No.

The headhunter was filled with dread. 

The music stopped. An ancient voice, bold, cut through the night. 

“How are you, German? Been long time."" 

His stance shifted to battle ready as his blade came up raised. His voice, louder, cut through the night as well to the speaker unseen. But he knew who it was to whom he spoke. 

""What do you want, snake?”

Laughter. Real. The knight Azræl always was good for a laugh as far the sorcerer was concerned.

“So funny?"" Azræl said to the night all around him. “Come out and show me what's so funny, witch."" 

More laughter. 

“Have we not shared many things over the long years, my friend? Such a long time. A great deal.”

A series of images flicker-shot through the headhunter's mind then. Whether put there by the devilry of the sorcerer or memories of his own from one of many possible past lives, Azræl was not sure. If he lived through this encounter he would meditate and pray on the matter later. 

If he lived through this encounter. 

His mind's eye:

The forests and the forest people and their villages are burning. There is much bloodletting. The ground is gorged, it cannot possibly drink up all of it. It sloshes about the ankles of the soldiering and the marching and the frantic frightened running. The pursuers too. The blood that chokes the earth sloshes mire-like about the furnace steps of them all. Charlemagne has demanded these pagan northmen be put to kneel before the cross or be put to the sword. Slavery for their women and children…

… and the knights were thus dispatched thither…

The headhunter severed the line of thought or memory or whatever it was with brutal sudden cunning and roared into the empty silent night.

“Show yourself, mongrel!"" 

His laughter never seemed to cease. It stood in place of a physical person. Almost attaining its own physicality.

“You hurl insults because you've nothing else to throw! Nothing else to attack! You are hilarious, German! I've always liked you but you should not be so easy, not after all this time, no?"" 

He had to be careful. The sorcerer was dangerous. He could bend and weave reality seemingly at will, like a djin. None of his brotherhood nor the high priest could discern his source of power. Nor its limits. 

“I insult you, witch, because you and your kind are garbage."" 

Laughter that became a cacophonous crack! It dominated the world, the soundtrack hell to the neon witching scene. The music somehow came to life and began to play again, a wicked untethered horde flurry series of scaling and wild notes in wild man tandem with the laughter of the sorcerer, a corruption duet.

A ney. The headhunter remembers what it is that the instrument is called. A ney. 

Its sound and the sorcerer's laughter were a whirlwind maelstrom expansion sound swell within his skull. For a moment he considered taking his own blade and driving it into his own face, bashing it in and freeing that which was trapped within and growing, threatening to burst like the milk of green infection.

He stopped himself at the last moment. His training saving him. He recognized what was happening, what it was…

… bewitchment. 

He regained his focus against the tumult wave of sound storm wielded by the sorcerer, who once again cried out from nowhere. 

“Garbage! We are all garbage for the earth, German. We are all meat detritus for the watering jaws of the starving soil, we all return to it, are all reduced to ruin and returned to the sour womb to feed the indifferent planet. You know! You know! Only our petty Gods care! And so they fight! And, we, their moving pieces!”

And with that, the pieces did move. 

 Hand of Iblis. The mad sorcerer. 

Against champion of the goat-shape, Azræl.

And this modern Sodom of steel and human woe was to be the chess board for their latest match. A contest of secret champions. 

He did not see, but felt… 

Behind him. Movement. Killing stance. 

The headhunter whirled round with sudden animal speed in a counter slash. Roaring. 

But he roared… and slashed… at nothing. 

Nothing there. Only thin night air. 

Laughter/voice. Behind him again. 

“The same tricks always work on all of you."" 

He whirled once more. Nothing. 

The laughter again. Across the street. 

Azræl drew throwing dagger and with a lunge and a flick/turn of the forearm and wrist, threw the quivering blade. 

It struck pavement next to a dying drunk in a splatter burst of caveman fire spray. Grabby yelped. But there was no sorcerer of the sands over there. 

Or anywhere. 

Goddamit. 

""Up here.”

The headhunter whirled once more, a dancer upon my stage thought the sorcerer but kept it to himself. The German would not appreciate such an observation. 

""Why do you hide in a tree?” asked the black knight of the goat-shape order impetiously. 

The sorcerer grinned, balanced on the branch of a starving sapling oak. Running alongside a dark and quiet apartment building. 

""I've always appreciated a wider view, German. Always. Up here, I see more and I am closer to heaven and therefore I can see more like God. You… and your brothers… you stay down there in the dirt because you cannot know anything more."" 

Azræl raised blade. 

“Come down here and show me what I know, mongrel. Perhaps I can show you a thing or two as well."" 

The sorcerer shrugged. 

“Eh."" 

Azræl drew once more and threw. The throwing blade of ornate seven pointed star flew unabated, cutting through the nighttime chill like a deadly bird of sharpened stabbing steel. 

But when the piercing blade found the place in the tree where the heart of the sorcerer was, it no longer was there. 

It never had been. 

""I'm always behind you, German.” 

He spun on his booted heels and his great arms carried his tireless steel down in another great chop. But it was already too late. 

The sorcerer raised the ney and blocked the blow as if the wind instrument was an iron bar. He then flew in, swift movement that was not at all human or natural, stepping in close and bringing the long cylindrical body of the instrument down in a cracking blow across the headhunter's crown, splitting it and knocking consciousness from his mind's failing grip. 

But as he sent the headhunter's mind on a journey into darkness, he gave it another vision. A vision of flames. 

…

Jerusalem. 

Burning Jerusalem. 

where will you turn when it all goes wrong…?

The holy city is a cinder shrieking thousands as one. The holy city is in flames. 

… and you're on the run

And all around the city is a newly erected manmade hellscape forest grove. All around the city are the impaling lancing sticks. On them are the impaled. All of them are still screaming, screaming with their burning city. Man. Woman. Child. Animal. The warriors that have done this like to crucify lions for fun but for now, this will suffice.

She checks her phone briefly but apart from that we just stand there. She’s very bubbly and chatty, nearly always see her talking to people; not sure what to make of the silence. 

When the lecturer starts talking to us, she is chatty again, but only makes eye contact with the lecturer and my friend, despite being closest to me and having space to move into ahead of her to get closer to the lecturer.

I leave with my friend, she goes back to the classroom to get her bag. Tell my friend I’m gonna go study in the lab; while we’re talking, she passes us out heading through the corridor. When I say goodbye to my friend, she’s turned around and smiles quite sheepishly saying that she thinks she’s left her coffee at home and is gonna check the classroom, but that she’ll see me in the lab (I only told my friend I was going to the lab). She said this part more confidently than the coffee part. 

In the lab, I sit down, 30 seconds later she comes up smiling, no coffee, on my side of the room despite an empty lab. I say “that’s devastating” jokingly, ask why she can’t order one in the cafe and she says she has to have oat milk. I say “oh you’re one of THOSE”, she chuckles, sits down on the chair behind me (her back now to me), and we both study. When I get up, she (with no earphones) looks up and says bye before I do.

What do you make of this? I did sense some possible interest but she is very bubbly and social; never really assumed she’d like me. I thought she would talk to me more overall if she was interested? ",0,1771332052.0,bodylanguage,1,0.5,False
