Jk lol. Well, sort of. 

I’m a 3L who summered at a V30 (DC office) and is a campus ambassador for the firm. Because of the new insane timeline of biglaw recruiting (with 1L summer recruiting happening as early as October and 2L as early as December/January) my firm has enlisted our help to recruit/find people who would be a good fit for the firm personality/culture wise. Obviously, being at Georgetown, the grades will matter to a lesser extent. Georgetown is also the most highly represented school at the firm (at least it was, this summer). 

In any case, the firm will pay for us to have a meal/coffee with 1Ls who are interested in biglaw and the firm specifically, so feel free to comment or reach out via PM if you are interested and we can set something up. This isn’t an interview, but it’s a chance to recruit people who would be a good culture fit for the office and the firm as a whole. It’s also fun because I get to meet cool new people—I’m always impressed at how much everybody here has accomplished. 

Feel free to ask questions if you have any and I hope that orientation week is going well for you all!

1mvd2zf,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFriendsFriendsClub/comments/1mvd2zf/my_review_on_moto_metabolism_pills/,My Review on Moto Metabolism Pills Multi-Ingredient Weight Loss Formula: Comparison with other weight loss supplements,"**My Rating: 2.4/5 stars**

[**Moto Metabolism Pills**](https://wholesomehealth.cc/out/motometabolism.php) represent the classic ""better than nothing but not by much"" category. If you're someone who wants the psychological boost of taking a weight loss supplement and you're already doing the hard work of diet and exercise, it might provide modest support. However, at this price point, you'd likely get better results buying high-quality chromium picolinate and a separate B-complex vitamin.

The reality is that most people would see identical results by simply drinking 2-3 cups of quality green tea daily and taking a basic multivitamin. This formula feels designed more for marketing appeal than therapeutic effectiveness, which is unfortunately common in the weight loss supplement space.

Currently, I'd recommend [**Phen**](https://wholesomehealth.cc/out/phenq2.php) **and** [**HourGlass Fit**](https://wholesomehealth.cc/out/hourglassfit.php) **over this multi-ingredient formula** for one simple reason: focused effectiveness beats scattered attempts every time.

While Moto Metabolism tries to do everything with underwhelming doses, **Phen** delivers serious appetite suppression through proven ingredients like a-Lacys Reset and Capsimax, while **HourGlass Fit** provides reliable hunger control specifically designed for sustainable weight management.

From my first-hand observations, people get frustrated with ""kitchen sink"" formulas like this one because you never know which ingredient is working (if any), whereas Phen and HourGlass Fit have clear, researched mechanisms that actually move the needle on weight loss.

The chromium in Moto Metabolism pills formula might help with cravings, but why settle for ""might help"" when you could get the consistent, predictable appetite suppression that makes the difference between another failed diet attempt and actual results? At this price point, you're better off investing in a supplement that specializes in what you need most - appetite control - rather than getting minimal doses of everything.

After years of testing/reviewing various weight loss supplements, I'd approach Moto Metabolism formula with cautious optimism at best. If you're looking for a comprehensive supplement that hits multiple pathways, this product attempts to cover all the bases - but that's both its strength and weakness.

**How It May Benefit You**

Based on first-hand experiences I've observed with these ingredients, this supplement could provide modest benefits if you're just starting your weight loss journey. The **chromium** component might help with those afternoon sugar cravings that derail many people's progress. I've seen users report feeling more satisfied after meals when taking chromium consistently, though the effects are usually subtle rather than dramatic.

The green tea extract could give you a slight metabolic boost - think of it as adding an extra 50-100 calories of daily burn, not the fat-melting miracle some expect. If you're someone who struggles with energy for workouts, the modest caffeine content might provide just enough kick without the jitters.

The B-complex vitamins are where this formula might surprise you. I've witnessed people discover that addressing nutritional deficiencies significantly reduced their constant hunger signals. If you're eating a restricted diet, these vitamins could help your body function more efficiently during weight loss.

**Where Moto Metabolism** **Falls Short**

Here's my honest assessment: this feels like a ""kitchen sink"" approach that throws multiple ingredients together without optimizing any single pathway effectively. The chromium dose at 600mcg is reasonable, but the green tea extract amount isn't specified clearly, making it impossible to know if you're getting therapeutic levels.

From first-hand observations, multi-ingredient formulas like this often underperform compared to focused, single-ingredient approaches. You're essentially getting a little bit of everything but not enough of anything to create meaningful change.

**Recommended Usage for Weight Loss**

If you decide to try this, I'd recommend taking it with your largest meal of the day to maximize the chromium's glucose-stabilizing effects. Start with one capsule daily for the first week to assess tolerance, especially if you're sensitive to B vitamins or caffeine.

Don't expect dramatic results - this is more of a supportive tool than a primary weight loss driver. Combine it with consistent calorie tracking and regular exercise for any realistic chance of success.

**Pros & Cons**

**Pros:**

* Covers multiple metabolic pathways in one formula
* B-vitamin complex may address hidden deficiencies affecting appetite
* Chromium dose is within therapeutic range
* Convenient single-supplement approach

**Cons:**

* Ingredient amounts may be too low for meaningful effects
* No clear dosing information for green tea extract
* Multi-ingredient formulas often create more side effects
* Expensive way to get basic nutrients you could obtain separately

**Recommended alternatives**

Currently, I'd recommend [**Phen**](https://wholesomehealth.cc/out/phenq2.php) **and** [**HourGlass Fit**](https://wholesomehealth.cc/out/hourglassfit.php) **over this supplement.**

**Ingredient Breakdown**

**Vitamin B12 (2.4mcg):** A basic maintenance dose that won't hurt but likely won't provide the energy boost many hope for unless you're actually deficient.

**Chromium Picolinate (600mcg):** This is the star ingredient here - a solid dose that could genuinely help with glucose metabolism and reducing carb cravings in some users.

**Green Tea Extract (270mg):** Without knowing the EGCG content, this could be anywhere from mildly helpful to completely ineffective for fat burning.

**Black Cumin Seed Extract (200mg):** An interesting addition with potential anti-inflammatory benefits, though the weight loss evidence is limited and mostly from small studies.

**Capsicum Extract (1mg):** This tiny amount is essentially worthless - you'd get more thermogenic benefit from adding hot sauce to your meals.

**Bottom Line**

This supplement represents the classic ""better than nothing but not by much"" category. If you're someone who wants the psychological boost of taking a weight loss supplement and you're already doing the hard work of diet and exercise, it might provide modest support. However, at this price point, you'd likely get better results buying high-quality chromium picolinate and a separate B-complex vitamin.

The reality is that most people would see identical results by simply drinking 2-3 cups of quality green tea daily and taking a basic multivitamin. This formula feels designed more for marketing appeal than therapeutic effectiveness, which is unfortunately common in the weight loss supplement space.

**My Performance Evaluation: Moto Metabolism Weight Loss Formula**

**Performance Ratings (1-5 Scale)**

**Appetite Suppression: 2.5/5** The chromium picolinate at 600mcg could provide modest appetite control for some users, but the minimal capsicum dose and unclear green tea extract potency severely limit overall hunger suppression effectiveness. You might notice slightly reduced cravings, but nothing approaching the reliable appetite control of dedicated suppressants.

**Metabolism Boost: 2/5** The green tea extract and tiny capsicum amount provide negligible thermogenic effects - you'd burn more calories walking to the mailbox than this formula would add to your daily expenditure. Without knowing the EGCG content or having meaningful doses of proven metabolic enhancers, this is essentially metabolic theater.

**Energy Enhancement: 3/5** The B-vitamin complex could provide genuine energy improvement if you're deficient, and the modest caffeine from green tea won't cause crashes like synthetic stimulants. However, if you already eat a balanced diet and drink coffee, you'll likely notice zero additional energy boost.

**Stimulant-like Effects: 1.5/5** This formula is designed to avoid strong stimulant effects, which means minimal jitters or crashes but also minimal noticeable impact. The green tea's caffeine content is so low you'd get more stimulation from a cup of weak tea.

**Fat Burning: 2/5** The combination lacks the proven fat-burning compounds in therapeutic doses needed for meaningful lipolysis - you're looking at maybe an extra 20-30 calories burned daily at best. The black cumin seed extract is interesting but unproven for fat loss in humans.

**Safety Profile: 4/5** This is probably the formula's strongest point - the conservative dosing means very low risk of adverse effects for most users. The ingredients are well-tolerated individually, though some people might experience mild stomach upset from the B-vitamins if taken on an empty stomach.

**User Reviews: 2.5/5** Based on similar multi-ingredient formulas I've observed, expect mixed reviews with many people reporting ""no noticeable effects"" and others claiming modest improvements that could easily be placebo. The lack of standout ingredients makes dramatic testimonials unlikely.

**Price/Value for Money ($29): 2/5** At $29, you're paying premium pricing for basic ingredients in subtherapeutic doses - you could buy quality chromium picolinate and a B-complex separately for under $15 and get better results. This represents poor value compared to focused, effective alternatives in the same price range.

1mvcy28,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mvcy28/how_does_nespresso_vertuo_pop_deluxe_coffeemaker/,How does Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ Deluxe coffeemaker review stack for home brewers?,"The sleek and stylish look of the **Nespresso BNV125TTN1BUC1 Vertuo Pop+ Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Maker by Breville** instantly caught my eye when unboxing the product. Finished in a metallic Titan color, it didn’t just look premium but also felt durable. Being a coffee enthusiast who prizes aesthetics as much as function, I was particularly drawn to how effortlessly this product complements a modern kitchen setup. It fits snugly on my countertop, and its compact design, measuring 14""D x 8.6""W x 10.4""H, makes it ideal for small spaces—a critical point for anyone living in apartments or maintaining a minimalist vibe.  

**Ease of Use with One-Touch Functionality**  
Operating this machine is a breeze. With its fully automatic design and one-touch coffee system, brewing coffee has genuinely never been simpler for me. A quick heat-up time of 30 seconds caught me pleasantly off guard—I didn’t have to wait long before I was enjoying my morning espresso. The adjustable drip tray allows me to switch between shorter espresso cups and larger mugs, which makes this machine great for accommodating all types of coffee drinkers in my household. Even my notoriously impatient teenager found their way around the buttons without trouble.  

[Smooth Brews Await! Check Nespresso BNV125TTN1BUC1 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0c5zp4tx7/)  

**Precision Brewing for Perfect Flavor**  
The quality of the coffee was an absolute highlight for me. This machine uses Nespresso’s precision brewing technology, which ensures every cup is full-bodied and balanced. I noticed a velvety layer of crema on top, giving it that café-style experience right in my kitchen. Each sip, whether it was a robust espresso or a lighter 8-ounce brew, was smooth and satisfying. From my early morning jolts to mid-afternoon coffee breaks, this machine delivered perfect consistency every time.  

**Wide Variety of Options**  
It comes with the capability to brew in five cup sizes, including single and double espressos, as well as 5, 8, and 12-ounce coffees. I even experimented with their Cold Brew style coffee, which turned out great for warmer afternoons. Plus, the machine includes a tasting pack of Vertuo capsules. This pack was fantastic for exploring blends and flavors before committing to a full sleeve of capsules. Of course, being compatible exclusively with Nespresso Vertuo capsules might be a downside for some, but for me, knowing I can get over 40 permanent blends, along with limited-edition offerings, actually felt exciting!  

**Sustainability Efforts**  
Being environmentally conscious, I was thrilled to learn Nespresso pays special attention to sustainability. The aluminum coffee pods are fully recyclable, and Nespresso provides a free recycling program. It feels nice knowing that my coffee habit doesn’t have to come at such a high environmental cost.  

**Highlights**  
- High-quality and precise brewing technology for consistent coffee.  
- Five brew sizes, covering espresso to larger mugs.  
- Recyclable aluminum capsules and free Nespresso recycling program.  
- Compact yet premium design with metallic detailing.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Despite the strengths, there are some pitfalls worth mentioning:  
- Exclusivity to Nespresso Vertuo capsules can feel restrictive for some.  
- The reusable filter option doesn’t extend to non-capsule coffee, which doesn’t cater to traditional coffee grounds users.  
- Priced slightly above generic coffee makers, which might put off budget-conscious buyers.  

**Competing Options**  
As a dedicated coffee drinker, I’ve tried numerous single-serve coffee makers, including the Keurig K-Supreme Plus and the Breville Bambino Plus. Compared to these alternatives, the Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ Deluxe shines in the simplicity of its brewing process and the quality of its crema. Where Keurig excels in offering third-party pod options, the Nespresso gains an edge thanks to its sleek aesthetic and precision. The Breville Bambino Plus, on the other hand, delivers similar quality, but it has a steeper learning curve with a manual frother. For anyone seeking both ease and café-style coffee, I’d argue this machine strikes the right balance.  

**Best Value**  
Considering its premium look, versatile brewing options, and remarkable coffee taste, I’d say this machine offers a good price-to-quality ratio. It’s not the cheapest out there, but the convenience, design, and consistency make it an appealing investment for coffee lovers who value both function and form. Personally, I feel it’s worth the slightly higher cost compared to other mass-market coffee makers, especially if you drink coffee daily.

Help me make sense of this, as I really don’t know much of anything about coffee other than I like it with creamer. And recently have switched from brewed coffee (it was giving me OAB) to espresso but noticing something.. 

•Brewed dark roast coffee (like from a pot) =energizes me and wakes me up (like a neurotyp) & often can make me jittery and even overstimulate me… despite having less caffeine then espresso

•Espresso shot (high intensity)=makes me insanely tired, ready for bed (took a nap at 3pm espresso yesterday) but tastes so much better. 

And heck, even if I drank 2-4 cups of brewed coffee, I would still be jittery and buzzy, like I can’t reach the tiredness/relaxation I get with espresso from increasing the brewed coffee intake, but one espresso shot does the trick.

And let me share with you, when I first started drinking coffee at age 20, I was drinking only nespresso pods, and it also made me tired (briefly after when I found out I had ADHD too), when I switched to my dads coffee pot I started getting Overactive Bladder Syndrome problems & became an easily overstimulated human. 6 years later and I’m realizing it’s the damn coffee.

1mvcwfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1mvcwfy/toys_part_iii/,Toys Part III,"I didn’t sleep that night.

After I was sure Win was out, I crept into the closet – making sure not to wake up Jess. My heart was pounding, my breathing hard and fast, and I didn’t want to scare her.

I was scared enough for the both of us.

We had some of our things stacked in boxes toward the back of the closet – old, unnecessary things consolidated to a few boxes. I had meant to take them up to the attic, that new shared and secret space, but just hadn’t gotten around to it yet. I was glad I hadn’t because the thought of creeping up those narrow stairs into the still, hot dark up there after what had just happened seemed unbearable.

One of the boxes had a bunch of Win’s baby things. Old bottles, a well-used maternity pillow, some of Win’s baby toys she had moved on from – all of them were stuffed into a box labeled ‘Someday’. We’d been saving them, of course, with the thought that maybe we’d need them again; *someday*. A sweet wish we were banking on for the future.

I ripped the tape off the top of the box, a little too loud. I winced, looking back through the closet to the edge of the bed, watching Jess’s feet in case she stirred and kicked. But she was still, and even from the insulated quiet of the closet I could hear her deep, rhythmic breathing.

I rummaged through the box, my hands clumsy in the dark – forgotten shapes playing against my imagination. I knew what I was looking for, and after some digging my fingers brushed against a length of cord. A hard, plastic shape. I pulled it all free.

It was Win’s baby monitor. A small black camera, the power chord snaking around the aperture. I stuffed it into the pocket of my pajama pants, walking carefully around the spots in the floor I knew would creak and back out of the closet.

As I stood in the doorway, I heard it.

A long, slow *creeaaak.*

This wasn’t the timid, hesitant sound I’d heard before. This was drawn-out, deliberate – ending with a low, hollow *thunk,* like the lid meant to shut itself. Like it meant to be heard.

I froze. The shape of the second-floor unspooled in my mind: the hall stretching to Win’s room, the nook, the box in the corner.

*creeaaak.* *thunk.*

Again – measured, almost playful.

My pulse skittered. I thought of her jaw clicking last night, her wide, glassy eyes. The cold tooth in my palm. I felt my forehead break out in sweat at the thought of it – that frigid pebble of a molar.  

I walked down the hall as silently as the carpet allowed, feeling the darkness lean toward me. Lick at me. The creaking stopped as I reached her door.

I eased it open.

The room glowed in the faint, amber haze of her nightlight. Win was a bundled shape on the bed, her face turned toward the wall. The toybox sat still and shut within the nook, as if it hadn’t moved in years.

But I knew better. I was learning to be better.

I pulled the monitor from my pocket, unwinding the cord. I worked by memory, crouching in the far corner of the room – away from the bed, away from the box. *Out of sight*, my mind whispered, *out of sight*.

I found an outlet and jammed the cord in. The red light blinked on. I angled the lens toward both the toybox and the bed, making sure they fit together in the frame. Then – standing, holding my breath – I backed out of the room.

On the other side, back in safer dark of our room, I took out my phone. I downloaded the monitoring app and logged back into our account. It took a moment for the camera to start streaming live to me but when it did…

I saw Win, still and tucked away in her blanket. I saw the room, the night vision switching on as soon as the camera felt how dark the room was. I saw the nook -- the dark little threshold in the far wall.

And inside, the edge of the toybox.

I settled next to Jess as softly as I could, as careful as the bed springs as I was of the floorboards, rolling over on my side, hugging my phone close to me. I checked the app every few minutes like I was pressing on a bruise to make sure it still hurt. My little portal into Win’s room, a window to peek through. The toybox was still, a window to peek through. Static shimmered across the shadowed wood, making it seem alive, *squirming*.

And there, eyes wide in the dark, I waited. I watched.

\*\*

“What are you doing?”

I jolted, half-asleep, spilling cold coffee over the edge of the mug. I was sitting at the kitchen table, hunched forward in my seat. My phone in my other hand, close to my face.

Too close, I guessed, from the way Jess was looking at me.

“Hello?” she asked. Her arms were crossed in front of her, and she nodded her head toward my phone. “What’s that?”

“Just work,” I said, sliding my hand and the phone with it under the edge of the table and into my lap. I’d been checking the feed since dawn, over and over, and I’d had to have my phone plugged in ever since I got up out of our bed a few hours to charge. I brought the mug to my lips, taking a sip. Wincing at the flat, cold flavor.

“Yeah,” Jess said, turning around. She was portioning snacks – carrots and apple slices and yogurt pouches. A juicebox.

I frowned.

“What are *you* doing?” I asked.

Jess didn’t turn around.

“Packing a bag,” she said, stuffing the goods into the plastic grocery bag.

“Yeah, I can see that,” I said, sitting up a little in my chair, a dull pain settling in my lower back, “but why?”

Jess dropped her hands on the counter. I saw her shoulders slump, saw her head roll back just the barest few inches. Inches enough for me. I felt my heart kick up in my chest.

“For Mom’s?” she said, half-turning her head to me. I could see the side of her eye, her lips drawn tight.

“For Mom’s,” I repeated, closing my eyes.

Of course. Jess had told me last week we’d be going to see her parents this weekend. They lived two hours away, they were well off in their retirement, and they spoiled Win at every chance they got. The thought of her coming home with some fresh toys, something new and good? It was a relief, it was a balm to the unease throbbing in the center of me.

“I’m sorry,” I said again after a moment, opening my eyes again – a slow struggle, “I know I’ve been…”

“We’re leaving in an hour,” Jess said, grabbing the bag. Cinching it shut and turning toward me.

I met her eyes. I tried to smile. Wondering, idly, if I looked as sick as I felt.

Jess softened. She didn’t return the smile, not quite. But her body relaxed, her free hand easing the neck of her bathrobe. Rubbing her collarbones – drifting tickling fingers along their ridges. It was a small gesture of self-comfort, automatic, and one I knew well. In that moment I wanted so very badly to stand up, cross the distance between us in the kitchen, and wrap my hands around her waist – to take her hand, hug her close, and whisper how much I loved her right into the dip of her shoulders. To wish in her well.

I blinked, my eyes suddenly watering. Jess smiled, and this time I’m sure what she saw reflected back on my face was genuine. It was the real chord of our love, thrumming through us – what brought us together, what made Win, what made sharing this life and this house so beautiful.

A secret, smiling note between us that – in the bare seconds of that moment – felt like it could fill the house. One that could amplify all of the light of everything good we had here and push back the shadows.

I stayed at the kitchen table longer than I needed to, just watching her move. The soft hum of the fridge, the faint shift of the house above us – like something settling deeper into place. Her presence felt… steady. It was something I could hold onto.

“Want to get the girl?” Jess said, walking by me and pausing where I sat. Laying her hand on my shoulder. Squeezing once. It felt like home should.

I wiped my eyes, nodding. I heard Jess walk on behind me – out the kitchen and up the stairs. When I was sure she was gone, I thumbed shut the close button on my phone. I stood up, stretching, and tried to keep that lingering moment with me.

Then, with a sigh that turned into a shaking yawn, I turned around myself and started up the stairs. Toward Win’s room.

\*\*

I walked past our room, smiling to myself as I heard Jess humming deeper inside as she got dressed. The sun was up and full as I came to Win’s door – streaming through the window upstairs, washing the still-bare walls in warm gold. Win’s door was closed, Win’s door was closed – a habit she picked up after potty training; she always closed the door on the way back into her room if she had to get up in the middle of the night for some reason. I reached for the handle and pressed my ear to the wood, listening for the sounds of my girl sleeping.

Nothing.

I eased the door open.

Win’s bed was empty. Blankets a messy coil at the foot, pillow almost bare.

Except for Milkshake. Except for *fucking* Milkshake.

The room didn’t have any of the warmth from the outside hall. It felt… hollow. Empty.

I took a slow step inside, shutting the door again, my eyes sweeping the room. I didn’t see Win’s new doll anywhere – that one didn’t have a name yet and I was glad of it. Hoping she’d forget about it, hoping she wouldn’t latch on to it like she had that ashen snake. It would be so much easier to take that way – to get rid of.

*creeaaak*

My gaze shot to the nook. The toybox was open, its black lid angled back.

For a moment, I didn’t understand what I was seeing—two small legs, pajama cuffs bunched at the ankle, feet hooked over the edge. Half my daughter’s body – inside the gaping mouth of that shadow thing. The rest of her vanished inside.

“Win.” My voice came out flat, too quiet.

No answer.

I dashed across the room and grabbed her around the waist. She twisted in my arms, immediately struggling, small hands clutching something to her chest. I gasped, surprised, and tried to keep my grip on her.

“Let go!” she shrieked, writhing. “LET GO.”

“Win, stop. STOP,” I said, finding myself screaming as I yanked her back and out of the nook. I felt what she was holding on to pressing against me, a lump of cold and wet. It was repulsive, and in the dreamy scramble of the moment the first thought that lit up my mind was that it was dead, that it was a dead thing Win had and she was squeezing it so tight against herself.

“Drop it baby,” I said, my mouth going dry, “drop it now, what…what is that?”

Win’s eyes shot to mine. Her face was flushed, eyes bright. She wailed, her arms going limp as she started to cry, sloping against my shoulder. I held her closer to me, an entirely different sting of tears welling in my eyes.

Win dropped the thing. I felt it land on my bare feet, and I gasped. And, I hate myself very much for admitting this – but my first reaction was to drop Win, after feeling the way that frigid lump felt against the tops of my bare feet. It was lizard instinct, the kind that knows to run when you see a shadow creeping up behind you out of the corner of your eye.

But Dad instincts won. I squeezed Win tight, stepping around the thing and away from the nook. 

The toybox lid slammed shut.

I moaned. My heart was throbbing, my guts wrung. Win held on tight to me, pressing her face against me, her wails rising as I spun around to look at the box.

It was silent. Eerie. Still.

I heard footsteps pounding down the hall – Jess. I hugged Win tighter, burying my face in her hair.

“Shhh, shh,” I said, my own voice shaking, “it’s okay, daddy’s here. I’m here, I’m with you, I’m here.”

I repeated my litany as the door to Win’s room shuddered in its frame.

“Robert? What’s going on?”

I could hear Jess on the other side of the door, see the knob rattling. I heard her grunt before she gave three short slamming knocks.

“ROBERT.”

Had I closed the door? I moved to open it, breathing hard, when my foot brushed the thing on the floor once more.

I recoiled, feeling bile sluice up my throat even before I laid eyes on the thing. I looked down, expecting to see something rotten and awful, something that should never be in my daughter’s room. I stared, struck dumb and disgusted, down at the lump on the floor.

It was, of course, a toy. A new toy, one I’d never seen before – and larger than the others. Its body was lopsided, stitched from mismatched fabric: faded doily webbings, shredded silks, threadbare linens. All of them separate shades of grey, a bouquet of ash. The shape of the thing was uneven, and I couldn’t tell if the fabric was supposed to be a dress or a shirt or a blouse. It looked – half-finished.

My mind retched the word: *undigested.*

The thing had two button eyes, one missing, leaving only a frayed circle of thread. The one that remained, however, was smoke-white and glassy. Staring down at the thing, I almost thought I saw myself reflected in its haze.

“What the hell is GOING ON?!” I heard Jess shout, from the hallway.

Hearing her voice, the strain, the horrible rise in pitch at the end, broke me out of my shock. I reached for the door in a rush, turning the knob. Hearing the lock click as I swung it open.

Jess was on the other side, her face almost as red as Win’s.

“Whathappenedwhathappened,” she said, twice and fast, slurring her words together. She was already stepping in the room, reaching for Win. Taking her from me.

I reached for her, the same way I’d wanted to reach for the warmth in the kitchen hours ago — but this time she twisted away, her back to me. The box creaked behind her, long and low, a settling groan.

Like it was breathing.

I let Jess take Win from me, my gaze shifting back to the thing on the floor. The cyclopean bundle.

“What is that baby,” I heard myself say, before I realized I was speaking.

Win’s face was buried in Jess’s shoulder, and she raised it, her face twisted with anger and confusion.

“It’s mine,” she said, breathless. “It was in the hallway.”

My mouth went dry. “What hallway? What?”

She didn’t answer – just hugged Jess tighter, her cheek pressing into her mother’s neck.

“Jess, I…”

But Jess just looked at me. Something unreadable in her stare. I felt it shrivel me, and suddenly all the menace in the room was gone. I felt empty, confused and dumb.

“you’re acting *in-sane*,” Jess hissed.

I opened my mouth to reply, but Jess stepped out of the room, barreling down toward the other end of the hallway. Back to our room.

I turned around to glance once more at the toybox before following them. The shadows underneath the chitinous wood were deeper than they should have been in the spilling daylight, pooling and oily at the bottom. I glared at it, waiting for it to open, waiting for it to creak.

But there was nothing. Once again, the fucking thing was *still*.

\*\*

By the time I came downstairs, Jess was in the entryway, kneeling in front of Win and buttoning a dress up the girl’s back – it was nice, almost too nice; floral print and pressed smooth. Win hadn’t worn it since Easter. Win was struggling to try and get the dress off, heavy-salted tears still lying fat and swollen on her face.

A small overnight bag sat open on the bench, half-filled with Jess’s clothes. The plastic snack bag was next to it, and beside that too were Jess’s toiletries.

There was nothing of mine.

Win whined, a pitiful little cry, and slumped down on the entryway wall as I came close. Jess froze, her face locked in a scowl. She watched me from the corner of her eye, standing up slowly.

“What are you doing?” I asked.

Jess gesticulated with both of her hands in front of her – an inferred ‘duh’.

“I’m taking her to my parents. Alone.,” she said, her tone already hard.

“Jess –”

“What the hell was that? I mean, she’s shaking, Rob. She’s scared out of her mind.”

“She was in the box,” I said. “Halfway inside.”

“It’s a *toybox*.” Jess zipped the bag with one sharp pull. “Not a trapdoor. Not some – ”

“You didn’t see it.” I stepped closer. “The way she was in there. The way she was holding that thing, I mean, it felt disgusting…”

“What felt disgusting?”

“The toy,” I said, “the…thing she had.”

“It’s a toy, Robert. She’s a kid. Kids play. You’re the one turning it into some something, something it isn’t ever going…” She stopped herself, glanced at Win, lowered her voice. “You’re scaring her.”

I looked at Win. She stared back, peeking up through her bangs which had spilled loose over her head. Her eyes were shiny and wet, her lip trembling.

I wanted to go to her. I wanted to scoop her up into my arms and hold her. I wanted to apologize to her a hundred thousand times with a hundred thousand kisses all over her head. I wanted to take the fear I had put into her, siphon it out, and remove every hard thought flowing through her head.

I wanted her Daddy to make it all better. But Jess stepped between the two of us, reaching a hand down for Win’s. Our daughter took it, -- standing up and locked eyes with me once more.

“It’s mine,” she said softly, almost a whisper.

Jess stroked her hair. “I know, honey. We’re just going to go see Grammie and Grandpie for a little while.”

But Win was still looking at me, clutching the edges of her dress and pulling it up over her knees. Her voice was steady now:

“It’s not for you,” she said.

The words slit their way into my mind. I stood still, meeting Win’s gaze. She stared through me. And even then, even in that moment and knowing what was coming, it felt like there was no one else in the entryway but the two of us.

Jess stood, sweeping Win close as she opened the door. She picked up our girl with one hand while the other looped though the bags’ handles. A late summer gust rushed in, filling the entryway with hot, bitter warmth. The air wet like breath.

“Don’t follow us,” she said. “Just… let us breathe for the day. Take some time and, I don’t know. Relax.”

I opened my mouth to respond – to try and convince them to stay. To argue, to push back, to tell them I was coming too.

But Win’s words were still buried in me. I felt so full – of dread, of confusion. Of a vague and helpless anger. It was all enough to make me burst…and yet I felt paralyzed, that I myself was just another fixture of the house – just some unwanted thing left to stand and witness another leaving love.

And what if Jess was right? What if I was the one making everything this way?

Did I want it to be this way?

The door shut behind them, the sound echoing through the house. I stayed there in the doorway, watching through the window set into the front door at Jess’s back as she went down the steps, Win’s small head resting on her shoulder, bobbing up and down – her eyes fluttering shut. The sudden warmth dissipated with the door shut, sealing out the sounds of their retreat – the engine starting, the slow backup down our driveway. I watched as our car drifted down the street without a sound. the quiet in the house shifting again – not settling this time but holding its breath.

Glutted with the words Win had whispered.

*It’s not for you.*

\*\*

I don’t know how long I stood in the empty entryway. I lingered longer than I should have, hands in my pockets, staring at Win’s backpack. Jess must have left it in her rush to get out and by the time I noticed it they had been gone for too long. It was hot pink and covered with blue polka-dots. It was also zipped tight. I didn’t know what was inside, so I left it where it was. Because, for several long moments, I thought if I kept looking that maybe I’d hear the car back up again. Hear the door open. Hear her voice calling for me like nothing had happened.

The house felt airless, not empty – not exactly – but suspended. Like every room was holding its breath. But the quiet never went away. It just… waited.

I drifted from room to room, trying to shake my thoughts loose. My eyes skimmed the places no one was—the living room, the kitchen, the hallway to the stairs. The corners where shadows pooled like water.

I kept going, unable to stop, pacing the downstairs in tighter and tighter loops. Circles around Jess and Win. Circles around the toybox. Around the thing I’d seen. Around what I’d done. Each lap pulling the walls closer, each turn drawing me in.

Everywhere felt wrong without Win. Without Jess.

My mind kept replaying what I’d seen in her room, like a broken clip on a loop – the pale cuffs of her pajamas disappearing into the toybox, her little heels spinning over the edge. That lump of cold in her arms.

Except, each time I ran it back, the edges started to shift and blur.

  
*Maybe she hadn’t fallen all the way in. Maybe she was just leaning over the edge.*

  
*Maybe the lid didn’t slam — maybe it just fell.*

*Maybe the lid did open easily, maybe it’d just been stuck when I tried, the wet paint sticking with humidity.*

*Maybe she really had found that thing in the hallway, and I’d—*

I sat down hard in one of the kitchen chairs, the breath rushing out of me.

Jess’s voice came back in perfect detail. *You’re scaring her.* It landed heavier this time. Made my skin itch.

Was that what she saw? Not a father keeping his daughter safe, but some paranoid lunatic grabbing his kid and shouting at her about nothing?

I pressed my hands to my face and stayed there. The dark behind my eyelids was safer. But when I opened them, all I could see was Win.

I took out my phone, unlocking it and composed a quick text to Jess:

“Hey. Sorry for earlier. I know I can be a lot sometimes. Hope you and Win are having a good time with your parents.”

And then:

“Love you both.”

The air in the kitchen felt thick, like I couldn’t get enough of it down my throat. My fingers itched for something to do, anything that would stop the circling.

The toys.

I went upstairs and gathered both Milkshake and the new lump doll. I didn’t look at them too closely. I didn’t want to know if they were warm or cold. I just put them all in an old laundry basket, carried it through the back door, and locked them in the garage.

It helped a little. But not enough.

I came back inside, opened my laptop at the kitchen table. The screen lit my face in the stillness, and I tried not to stare at my dim reflection in the monitor. I signed in, minimizing all my work tabs, and opened a new tab. I stared at the empty search bar, not sure what to type.

Then it came to me. I typed: **“60 Adams house history.”**

It was our house address. Nothing came up at first — just realtor blurbs, aerial maps, a few grainy shots of the property from when the last owners had it listed. But there were no photos listed anywhere taken inside the house. None of them showed the nook. None of them showed the toybox.

I tried other searches: *60 Adams accidents.* *60 Adams deaths.* *60 Adams children.*

A few old news clippings turned up, scanned crooked into the county archive. I expanded my search, replacing our address with the name of the town and county. Still, there was mostly nothing. Fundraisers, lost pets, a fire at a gas station that’s been a vape shop for as long as we'd lived here.

I leaned back in my chair, staring at the screen. My reflection met my stare, my eyes tired and too wide. I blinked, looking around the kitchen for the first time. Already it was dusk. I checked my phone, but I didn’t have a single message.

I almost closed the laptop. I almost let myself believe there was nothing to find. That the absence of proof meant I could shut this down and go sit in the living room until Jess came back. Maybe if I couldn’t forgive myself I could at least distract myself enough to forget. Bury myself on the couch in a blanket, order a pizza and maybe pick up some beer from the liquor store down the road – or maybe something stronger. Jess would be back that night, she had to be. At the very latest she would on Sunday. I wouldn’t have long to myself and maybe if I numbed the time I wouldn’t keep feeling this way all night – or all day tomorrow.

God I hoped it wouldn’t be that long.

I looked down at the laptop again, one more time before I shut it off. And that’s when I saw it.

A thumbnail on a page for the *Sevrin Hill Historical Society*, some buried section of their website that hadn’t been updated in years – white background with blue bulleted hyperlinks. I clicked on one of them: “Community Picnic — August 8th, 1987.”

The photo loaded slow, the pixels knitting themselves into shapes. Rows of folding chairs on the lawn in front of an old town hall. People holding paper plates and sweating in the August sun. People that looked like they could be anyone and be anywhere.

And near the bottom edge of the frame, apart from the others – a girl, maybe six years old. Standing alone in the grass. Her expression was unreadable, almost blurred by the sun.

But in her arms, hanging loose against her side, was something long and striped.

I leaned closer to the screen. My hand went to the trackpad, zooming until the image broke into little squares. But it didn’t matter how close I got. I knew the shape.

Milkshake. Or…something that looked exactly like it.

I leaned in closer, squinting, trying to let my mind run over the pixels. Trying to synthesize what I couldn’t define make sense in my mind. It was like I was looking at an old Magic Eye poster – the truth was in there, I just had to relax my focus, let my mind fill in the details.

The more I looked at the thing in the girl’s arms, the more sense it made to me. The thing in the girl’s arms was Milkshake. But the more I looked at the girl…

She was plump, and her face had the grim acceptance of the relentlessly bullied. She was short, the Girl Scout uniform she wore ill-fitted and looked even in the low quality of the image like it needed to be washed. And there was something over her eye. It could have been a trick of the lens or a mote of dust but…the closer I looked, the more I was sure. It was an eyepatch. Medical, white and wide, covering her left eye.

The same eye missing from the doll upstairs. Win’s newest plaything.

I scrolled down to the caption. The words were simple, nothing strange:  
*Sevrin Hill residents celebrate at the farmer’s market.*

That was all. No note about the snake. No explanation for why she was standing alone, away from the other kids. Not that I really expected there to be one. Still, I felt like I was on to something. The coincidence, the eerie resemblance, was too great.

I sat there a long time, staring at that girl’s pale, unreadable face.

Then it came to me, clicking back to the previous page. I typed the year from the original link on the historical site in my search bar and followed it with “Sevrin Hill girl scouts”.

A few pages popped up, but most of it was irrelevant. Some of the results directed me back to the county’s public records, and so I filtered my search to only show results from there. I clicked on a few dead ends and found more than a few dead links. I was almost out of search results when I got lucky.

Another photo – this one a faded black and white. A line of young girls sat under a mural – the same one I’d seen with Win and Jess downtown while we’d walked over for dinner a little while ago: fields of sunflowers of varying sizes and skill in composition. The girls were all wearing smocks, and some of them had paint smudged around their noses and eyes. And there, at the very end and almost shoved out of frame, was the girl from the farmer’s market photo.

A slinking, ringed serpent wound around her shoulder.

Below, the caption read “Troop 217. From left to right: Lenore Adams, Cary Ann Clark, Stephanie Cole, Marissa Trailor, and June Howard.”

June Howard. That was the girl’s name.

I copied and pasted it into the search bar, my heart beating fast. I made my search “June Howard Sevrin Hill”. I hesitated for a moment and then added “disappeared” before jamming the enter key.

I clicked the top result.  
It was a scan of the Sevrin Hill Gazette from 1992, the grain ghosted into the page like it was printed on ancient skin. I leaned closer to the screen, squinting at the headline:

**LOCAL GIRL STILL MISSING**

The article was barely three paragraphs. An afterthought between a notice about a pancake breakfast and an ad for lawnmower repair. I skimmed it, breathing faster and faster with each line.

*Authorities continue to search for 11-year-old June Howard, missing since the evening of September 2…last seen walking home from a friend’s house in the Adams Street area, near Hollow Hill Road…quiet and shy…missing her left eye, often wears a white medical patch…no new leads.*

It was the photo that stopped me.

She stood alone, framed from the knees up, her expression flat in a way only a kid who’s been through too much can manage. The white eyepatch was there, stark against her skin. In one hand was a thick hardcover book, the other a plastic terrarium. Curled up inside was a small, ringed snake. But I wasn’t looking at her face or the snake.

Behind her was a white house with a sharply pitched roof and a narrow front porch. One corner sagged, the same way ours did. The windows were set too close together. The siding was split under the eaves in a way I knew by touch.

I didn’t have to check the caption. I didn’t have to count the shingles or match the railings.

It was this house.

*Our* house.

I sat there staring at the screen, my hands resting uselessly on either side of the keyboard. The girl’s face filled my mind — the blunt, guarded expression, the white medical patch swallowing one eye. The same side missing from the doll upstairs.

June Howard.

The name kept spiraling in my mind, an undercurrent to every thought.

I looked again at the old photographs – the farmer’s market, the troop mural. Both times, the snake was there, draped around her like a stuffed animal for any other kind of child. Milkshake, or something so close it didn’t matter.

Maybe there was a practical explanation. Some eccentric neighbor or overzealous parent with a sewing kit and too much time on their hands, making toys to match a pet snake for the lonely girl down the street. A gift that, by some coincidence, had outlived her and ended up in our house years later. That could happen, I told myself. Small towns hold on to things. People die, boxes get donated, junk ends up in attics and thrift stores and – sometimes – in the hands of children who don’t know the history behind them.

But the more I tried to settle into that version, the less it fit. It was too neat. Too bloodless. I could feel it in the pit of me, in that place Jess would call paranoia but which I knew was something else entirely. A sharper kind of knowing. There was a ring to it – the resonance of truth vibrating inside my skull – that this wasn’t coincidence, and it wasn’t harmless. I needed to trust that, even if she wouldn’t. Especially if she wouldn’t.

My eyes drifted up, toward the ceiling. The attic was the one part of this house we hadn’t seen when we toured it. After Jess and I had torn down the boards during our first week here, we’d swept out the splinters and insulation and then started sliding things up there we didn’t need right away. Winter coats. Boxes of old books. A few sealed cartons left in the coat closet from the previous owners that I’d never gotten around to opening. The sealed boxes…

Now, the thought of those forgotten remnants made my skin prickle. Maybe there was something left behind. Something of the one-eyed girl, something of June’s. And if there was, I wanted to see it for myself.

\*\*

I climbed slowly, my palms sticking to the rails. The attic pressed in around me as soon as my head cleared the opening. It was the same as I remembered: the pitched roof – a tent of dark beams, the scattered floorboards over insulation puffing out from between joists, and the slow, oppressive heat curling around me. My breath felt heavy in it.

A few of our own boxes sat stacked near the attic stairs, labeled in Jess’s neat handwriting. Beyond them, the cartons from the previous owners slouched against one wall, the tape yellow and curling at the edges. For a second, I just crouched there, staring, the hair on my forearms rising for no reason I could name.

I started toward them, stepping lightly along the narrow plywood path laid to keep from crushing the insulation. The floor flexed under my weight. I knelt at the first box, traced the faded writing scrawled across the cardboard – indecipherable – and popped the top.

Inside was a mess of paperbacks, most of them damp-soft at the edges, and a few ceramic figurines packed in yellowed newspaper. I shifted them aside, looking for something… more. Something that would connect.

Beneath the books and brittle newsprint was a layer of toys – cheap plastic farm animals, a jumble of hair clips, and a pair of jelly sandals gone cloudy with age. I dug deeper, my fingers catching on the cracked edge of a photo frame. Inside, faded almost to nothing, was a picture I recognized instantly—two little girls in early-90’s puffers, cheeks red from the cold, their parents standing behind them. Candace and Marie. The worn twin of the photo Jess and I had found in the downstairs coat closet. We’d found other traces of them when we first moved in – marker scribbles on the upstairs baseboards, a pair of children’s spades behind the shed, a few other photographs tucked in odd places. Little artifacts of a family’s life left behind and outgrown like discarded cicada shells.

I felt the familiar sag of disappointment as I set the frame aside. No snake. No eyepatch. No June. Just more pieces of someone else’s history.

But as my hand left the frame, something made me pause. I picked it back up, this time looking harder at the girls’ faces. One of them – Marie, I thought – had the same pale hair and glass-bright eyes I remembered from the doll Win had in her hands the night I’d carried her down from her room. Not just blue eyes, but *those* blue eyes, the same clear, almost unnatural shade, crystalline frost. I stared at her smile, wide and fixed, and felt my skin prickle.

The connection was loose, frayed—but it was there. The doll Win had been holding the night I’d taken her from her room. It was someone. One of these girls.

I lowered the frame into my lap, holding it there longer than I meant to, the attic’s still heat settling heavy over me. Enveloping me. Licking at me.

And then I heard it.

Not a creak, not the dry flex of wood, but a low *groan* from below. It wasn’t the water softener, the boards shifting in the house. It wasn’t any appliance or outer wind.

It was squelching. Luridly alive, an unmuffled groan that I felt in my bones. Deeper than a creak, wetter than wood should sound. A long, deliberate sound – something working its jaw after a slow meal.

It came again – shorter this time, clipped, a swallowed chuckle. The sound reminded me of something I’d heard before, and it only took a moment for me to put it together. I felt sick, unbalanced, even as it came to me.

It sounded like the toybox. The opening of its jaws. The exaggerated sibling to its taunting creaking moan.

I knew I should go downstairs, get my hammer, smash the fucking thing apart and take the splintered remains outside to burn them. But instead, I found myself turning toward the far side of the attic, toward the sound’s echo in my head. Hesitating only for a moment, I started toward the back end of the attic, the section we hadn’t used, running my hand along the bare wood of the slanted attic walls for support as the floorboarded path narrowed.

That’s when my hand brushed a section of wall that felt…off. Too smooth.

I turned my head, swaying slightly on my feet—the boards here were thinner, narrower, uneven in their fit. Their grain didn’t match the rest of the attic—darker, almost bruised. I thumbed on my phone’s flashlight, already bracing for something I didn’t want to see.

The beam caught on a stretch of boards slick with a black, oily residue, as if something deep in the wall had burst and seeped slow for years. The stain seemed to breathe faintly under the light, as if there were pressure behind it. When I pulled my hand away, there was a faint film webbing between my fingers, sticky and metallic in the air and on my tongue when I reflexively swallowed.

I pushed the first board. It flexed, giving before tearing away with a damp snap. I tossed it down into the insulation and reached for another. Each one peeled off softer, wetter, colder. The dampness seemed to cling, not just to my hands but under my nails, sinking in. By the time I’d cleared the last of them, I was shivering.

Beneath the boards was not more wood, but stone. Black stone – slick and glistening, reflecting the light in the same way the toybox lid did, a shifting sheen that made me think of the way an eye moves under a lid. At the center of this surface was an opening – low, jagged, puckered at the edges. A split seam in the wall, raw and uneven, as if it had grown out of the house.

I crouched low, the rafters pressing down on me, and angled the light inside. The corridor beyond was paved with uneven stones mortared with something pale and fibrous. The walls pressed in tight at odd angles – as if they had shifted and locked into place centuries apart. The cold that rolled out was a deep cold, bloodless and still.

It wasn’t just darkness in there. It had weight. It had depth that didn’t belong in the shape of this house –  the way a body can feel its wounds deeper than the shallow scar tissue.

I dropped to my hands and knees, breath loud in my ears. I stuck my head inside, the stone damp and cold against my arms, angling the light forward. The beam bled into the dark and disappeared.

Somewhere ahead, in that thin black channel, something shifted. Soft. Deliberate.

My throat tightened. I jerked back, scraping my shoulder against the frame.

For a moment I stayed there, crouched, my breath ragged, phone still aimed at the hole. Waiting for the sound again. Waiting for…something.

But the corridor was still.

I stood, my knees popping, and backed away until my spine pressed against the far wall, nearly falling into a pocket of insulation as I did. The hole waited in the beam of my light—patient. Expectant.

I killed the flashlight. The dark rushed in.

Then I turned, forcing my way down the attic stairs, sliding the plywood cover back behind me.

I didn’t look up again – not once. I went downstairs, flung open the front door, and walked to the end of the driveway. I sat on the curb, cross‑legged.

I looked down at my hands and watched them shake. Black filth under my fingernails. I breathed, hard and fast, trying to calm myself down.

“Headlights, baby, c’mon headlights please,” I repeated, I prayed, aloud to the quiet of the evening, “c’mon, c’mon, come home baby pleaaase…”

I sobbed, finally letting my head drop into my hands. I wanted my girls, I wanted home the way it was even just a day ago. That I’d take, I’d take anything over what I had seen. What I’d *felt*.

But cutting under even that? I had a different kind of dread. A dread that resounded in me and, even now, grew louder and louder. Echoing, repeating, demanding I feel it.

It was this – Jess wouldn’t believe me. Even after everything, even after dragging her up there to show her, I had a sinking knowing at the very center of me that all of this would be another example of breaking from them. From their reality.

No, Jess may not believe me. And I would spare myself the trial of getting her to, that I knew now. Because whatever the fuck was going on in this house – with the toys, the toybox, the horrible, lonely way in the attic – I would have to deal with it and spare them of the grief. Even if Jess never believes me, I know what I heard.

I would fix this. I would fix this for our family, for my girls.",1,1755691508.0,libraryofshadows,1,1.0,False
1mvcw1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1mvcw1y/loving_in_silence_the_story_of_an_untold_feeling/,Loving in Silence: The Story of an Untold Feeling,"This is all written while I listen to depressing music. Through this text, I want to talk about my recent love, which was never meant to happen. But if there is something I’ve learned from this experience, it’s that you can fall in love with anyone.

Life is cruel, and I found out the hard way. One day I decided to walk with a girl to university for a trip without knowing what life had in store for me. I just wanted company; I didn’t want to walk alone. Now I think I’ll have to walk for the rest of my life without her. How can a simple five minute walk mean so much? How is it possible that the smallest interactions are the most valuable of them all? I could have never imagined what that would mean for me in the future.

I didn’t know many people on that trip, but what I did know is that I felt safe and comfortable with that stranger. Me, an introvert. I’m also the kind of guy who sometimes gets afraid of talking to girls. But this one was different. She was so easy to talk to, so easy to relate to, that it made me feel at home. We didn’t interact as much as I would have liked during the trip, but the little we did meant a lot to me. After that day, we didn’t hang out or talk much, but I decided to remind her that she had said she would send me the number of a woman who rents apartments. That’s how it all started from the smallest and most insignificant thing. From there, we just started telling funny stories and laughing. It felt so natural, so nice. I will never forget how she made me feel during those days.

We continued talking day after day, but as you can imagine, topics started to run out. So I did what anyone who wants to keep talking to someone does: I sent her a follow request on Instagram. This would be a decision I’d come to love and be grateful for, but also one I’d come to regret at some point. I never knew the powers that Instagram held back then. I just innocently thought it was a meme sharing app.

As the days went by, I started sending memes, more and more memes, and she reacted, laughed, and sent memes back. It was fun, and I loved the interaction. At the same time, after class, I used to walk with her since her house was in the same direction as mine. Those were my favorite 10 minutes every Tuesday and Thursday. Actually, I’m lying, those were the best minutes of my week. I will never forget the laughs and jokes we shared in those minutes. They were magical. I wish I could go back to those days. The cruelest thing is that time flies, and we no longer have any classes together. She is a business major, and I am an engineering major. It was just a matter of time before our paths split. Neither of us let that kill our bond, though. We kept sending each other reels and texting on WhatsApp. We gave each other daily updates. We were each other’s daily chat, but for me, it was always more than a conversation. It was my way of forgetting about everything else and just enjoying the good things in life. She became the reason I smiled, the reason I did stupid stuff just to tell her so we could laugh together.

While all of this was happening, I managed to invite her to small things where we bonded from time to time. We went out for the occasional ice cream or coffee, or just sat under a tree. It didn’t matter what we did, I just wanted to spend time with her. I must confess that during some of those moments, I would stare at her and think to myself: “How can someone be so beautiful?” But I never said anything. I still looked at her and thought of her as my friend.

A few months later, around July 2024, she told me she was planning on going to Italy as an exchange student. I told her it was a great idea to visit other countries and enjoy European life, another decision I would come to regret. During all this, we usually talked through texts or audio messages, until one day, out of nowhere, she got angry at me for never calling her. I was surprised, as I thought she wasn’t that type of girl that liked calls. So we started planning calls, and yet again, another decision I would come to regret. We usually called after 10 p.m., the best and worst time for a girl and a guy to talk. We discussed every topic under the sun. The main one, though, was love and sexual experiences, and we found out neither of us had any. So we had to rely on Instagram reels for those conversations. I must say, there are a lot of hormonal people who post very lustful stuff on Instagram.

In January, she left for Italy, six months without her. These would be the six longest months of my life, and also the time when I would finally realize what I’d been avoiding since day one. When she left, we kept texting, but it was never the same. There was a five hour difference, when I was free, she was asleep; when she was free, I was in class. In Italy, she met friends who loved parties, and she started partying. I saw nothing wrong with that and I told her to have fun. I enjoyed her funny stories about parties and visiting new cities until the day she told me she kissed a random guy at a club. That day, I discovered jealousy. I was so pissed and angry that I just read her messages from the notification bar and ignored them the whole day. When I finally replied, she asked for my opinion on the matter. I told her she had done nothing wrong and that she should enjoy her life. The greatest lie I’ve ever told. What I really wanted to say was that she should never kiss any guy that wasn’t me but I didn’t have the courage.

That experience made me realize I had fallen in love with my friend, my dear friend, with whom I had shared so many moments. It might seem obvious to you, reading this from the outside, but for me, it was never that simple. She had always told me stories of guys who started as her friends and then ended up hitting on her, and how much she disliked that. I suppressed my feelings for so long. But that day, I couldn’t hide my love from myself anymore. I was lost. I didn’t know what to do. “Should I tell her my feelings? Should I just stop talking to her without telling her what I felt?” These were the questions I asked myself. I was more inclined to just end our friendship without saying anything, simply because I was afraid of becoming one of those guys she used to complain about. So I started distancing myself. I stopped replying quickly, and when I did reply, it was with shorter messages. I kept that up for almost a week, the longest week of my life.

By the end of that week, I realized I wanted her in my life as my soulmate, and if I couldn’t have her as my love, I still wanted her as my friend. So I went back to being the same person I was before the kiss, texting and calling her regularly, but it hurt every time I thought of that moment. Sadly, it didn’t end there. She found a guy she liked, the first guy she said she had ever liked. He was everything she wanted. That opened a deeper wound in my heart, but I kept silent and told her to enjoy her stay in Italy with him. In the end, that guy ghosted her out of nowhere. She told me they never even kissed, he just disappeared. She was mad at him, but I was secretly happy he was out of the picture, or so I thought. She couldn’t get over him. She kept bringing him up, and I just avoided the conversation.

While she was still in Italy, I tried sending her some indirect messages to see if she was interested in me at all. All I got back were either no replies or subtle rejections. I’ll never know if she did this consciously or not.

When the six months were up, she came back, and I was so happy and excited to see her again. I gave her a proper, long hug, a hug with love. We sat and talked for hours, and then she asked me to go grocery shopping with her. It was such a pleasant experience. I forgot to mention that we used to do this during the first months of our friendship. It was fun, but nothing lasts forever. Later that week, during one of our late night conversations on Instagram, she confessed to kissing two other guys, and told me she’d even met up again with the guy who had ghosted her. At that moment, I just wanted to go to sleep, so I started replying slower until the conversation ended.

That day, I understood that what I felt was not reciprocal. I loved her, while she loved her summer fling from Italy. That day, I finally understood the meaning of the phrase: “I could fight 100 men who want you, but I can’t fight the one guy you want.” There was nothing left for me to do. She only saw me as her friend. I was happy to be her friend for a few more days, but I’m an overthinker. If you give me time to think, I start imagining every possibility. And in every one of them, I couldn’t see myself not loving her. Overthinking, that’s what leads us to the end of this text.

While she was still in Italy, she told me we should go to the cinema together to watch a movie. I suggested the new Demon Slayer movie, which releases in September this year. She told me she hadn’t watched the anime, so I said we could watch it together. That’s why, every Tuesday and Friday night, we’ve been watching it on Teleparty.

But going back to what I said about overthinking, I kept imagining more and more scenarios, and in every one, I couldn’t see a world where I didn’t love her. I got tired of hiding my feelings. I decided it was time to make a real decision about our future: either I express how I feel, or I leave her behind. I talked to a friend about it, and the opinions were divided. In the end, I’m a coward, so I chose the easy way out. I’d rather stop talking to her without telling her what I feel than confess and be rejected. My friends told me that one sided love never ends well, that it always ruins the friendship eventually. So I thought, if we’re going to stop talking either way, I’d rather let it fade without becoming another one of her stories about “friends who fell in love with her.”

In life, there are questions we think we know the answers to, and we’d rather stay that way than discover the truth. The fear of rejection has made me suppress my feelings for so long. So my plan is to do the most selfish thing I’ve ever done, even though I’m usually a selfless person. I plan to finish the anime, pretend everything is okay between us, then go to the cinema together, and after that, slowly stop talking to her. The plan is to mute her everywhere so I don’t feel the impulse to text her right away, and instead only reply when I check my phone. I’ll also stop texting her first, something I’ve already been doing for the past two weeks. Lastly, I’ll stop calling her and stop sending the long voice notes we used to call “podcasts” about my day. At some point, I hope she stops texting too. It will be hard to watch my friend fade away, but deep down, I think this is the wrong thing to do, with the right intentions. The longer this friendship stays this close, the harder it will be for me to detach. And when she realizes what’s going on, it will hurt her too.

Loving is also letting go, even if that means it hurts you deeply.

After I was sure Win was out, I crept into the closet – making sure not to wake up Jess. My heart was pounding, my breathing hard and fast, and I didn’t want to scare her.

I was scared enough for the both of us.

We had some of our things stacked in boxes toward the back of the closet – old, unnecessary things consolidated to a few boxes. I had meant to take them up to the attic, that new shared and secret space, but just hadn’t gotten around to it yet. I was glad I hadn’t because the thought of creeping up those narrow stairs into the still, hot dark up there after what had just happened seemed unbearable.

One of the boxes had a bunch of Win’s baby things. Old bottles, a well-used maternity pillow, some of Win’s baby toys she had moved on from – all of them were stuffed into a box labeled ‘Someday’. We’d been saving them, of course, with the thought that maybe we’d need them again; *someday*. A sweet wish we were banking on for the future.

I ripped the tape off the top of the box, a little too loud. I winced, looking back through the closet to the edge of the bed, watching Jess’s feet in case she stirred and kicked. But she was still, and even from the insulated quiet of the closet I could hear her deep, rhythmic breathing.

I rummaged through the box, my hands clumsy in the dark – forgotten shapes playing against my imagination. I knew what I was looking for, and after some digging my fingers brushed against a length of cord. A hard, plastic shape. I pulled it all free.

It was Win’s baby monitor. A small black camera, the power chord snaking around the aperture. I stuffed it into the pocket of my pajama pants, walking carefully around the spots in the floor I knew would creak and back out of the closet.

As I stood in the doorway, I heard it.

A long, slow *creeaaak.*

This wasn’t the timid, hesitant sound I’d heard before. This was drawn-out, deliberate – ending with a low, hollow *thunk,* like the lid meant to shut itself. Like it meant to be heard.

I froze. The shape of the second-floor unspooled in my mind: the hall stretching to Win’s room, the nook, the box in the corner.

*creeaaak.* *thunk.*

Again – measured, almost playful.

My pulse skittered. I thought of her jaw clicking last night, her wide, glassy eyes. The cold tooth in my palm. I felt my forehead break out in sweat at the thought of it – that frigid pebble of a molar.  

I walked down the hall as silently as the carpet allowed, feeling the darkness lean toward me. Lick at me. The creaking stopped as I reached her door.

I eased it open.

The room glowed in the faint, amber haze of her nightlight. Win was a bundled shape on the bed, her face turned toward the wall. The toybox sat still and shut within the nook, as if it hadn’t moved in years.

But I knew better. I was learning to be better.

I pulled the monitor from my pocket, unwinding the cord. I worked by memory, crouching in the far corner of the room – away from the bed, away from the box. *Out of sight*, my mind whispered, *out of sight*.

I found an outlet and jammed the cord in. The red light blinked on. I angled the lens toward both the toybox and the bed, making sure they fit together in the frame. Then – standing, holding my breath – I backed out of the room.

On the other side, back in safer dark of our room, I took out my phone. I downloaded the monitoring app and logged back into our account. It took a moment for the camera to start streaming live to me but when it did…

I saw Win, still and tucked away in her blanket. I saw the room, the night vision switching on as soon as the camera felt how dark the room was. I saw the nook -- the dark little threshold in the far wall.

And inside, the edge of the toybox.

I settled next to Jess as softly as I could, as careful as the bed springs as I was of the floorboards, rolling over on my side, hugging my phone close to me. I checked the app every few minutes like I was pressing on a bruise to make sure it still hurt. My little portal into Win’s room, a window to peek through. The toybox was still, a window to peek through. Static shimmered across the shadowed wood, making it seem alive, *squirming*.

And there, eyes wide in the dark, I waited. I watched.

\*\*

“What are you doing?”

I jolted, half-asleep, spilling cold coffee over the edge of the mug. I was sitting at the kitchen table, hunched forward in my seat. My phone in my other hand, close to my face.

Too close, I guessed, from the way Jess was looking at me.

“Hello?” she asked. Her arms were crossed in front of her, and she nodded her head toward my phone. “What’s that?”

“Just work,” I said, sliding my hand and the phone with it under the edge of the table and into my lap. I’d been checking the feed since dawn, over and over, and I’d had to have my phone plugged in ever since I got up out of our bed a few hours to charge. I brought the mug to my lips, taking a sip. Wincing at the flat, cold flavor.

“Yeah,” Jess said, turning around. She was portioning snacks – carrots and apple slices and yogurt pouches. A juicebox.

I frowned.

“What are *you* doing?” I asked.

Jess didn’t turn around.

“Packing a bag,” she said, stuffing the goods into the plastic grocery bag.

“Yeah, I can see that,” I said, sitting up a little in my chair, a dull pain settling in my lower back, “but why?”

Jess dropped her hands on the counter. I saw her shoulders slump, saw her head roll back just the barest few inches. Inches enough for me. I felt my heart kick up in my chest.

“For Mom’s?” she said, half-turning her head to me. I could see the side of her eye, her lips drawn tight.

“For Mom’s,” I repeated, closing my eyes.

Of course. Jess had told me last week we’d be going to see her parents this weekend. They lived two hours away, they were well off in their retirement, and they spoiled Win at every chance they got. The thought of her coming home with some fresh toys, something new and good? It was a relief, it was a balm to the unease throbbing in the center of me.

“I’m sorry,” I said again after a moment, opening my eyes again – a slow struggle, “I know I’ve been…”

“We’re leaving in an hour,” Jess said, grabbing the bag. Cinching it shut and turning toward me.

I met her eyes. I tried to smile. Wondering, idly, if I looked as sick as I felt.

Jess softened. She didn’t return the smile, not quite. But her body relaxed, her free hand easing the neck of her bathrobe. Rubbing her collarbones – drifting tickling fingers along their ridges. It was a small gesture of self-comfort, automatic, and one I knew well. In that moment I wanted so very badly to stand up, cross the distance between us in the kitchen, and wrap my hands around her waist – to take her hand, hug her close, and whisper how much I loved her right into the dip of her shoulders. To wish in her well.

I blinked, my eyes suddenly watering. Jess smiled, and this time I’m sure what she saw reflected back on my face was genuine. It was the real chord of our love, thrumming through us – what brought us together, what made Win, what made sharing this life and this house so beautiful.

A secret, smiling note between us that – in the bare seconds of that moment – felt like it could fill the house. One that could amplify all of the light of everything good we had here and push back the shadows.

I stayed at the kitchen table longer than I needed to, just watching her move. The soft hum of the fridge, the faint shift of the house above us – like something settling deeper into place. Her presence felt… steady. It was something I could hold onto.

“Want to get the girl?” Jess said, walking by me and pausing where I sat. Laying her hand on my shoulder. Squeezing once. It felt like home should.

I wiped my eyes, nodding. I heard Jess walk on behind me – out the kitchen and up the stairs. When I was sure she was gone, I thumbed shut the close button on my phone. I stood up, stretching, and tried to keep that lingering moment with me.

Then, with a sigh that turned into a shaking yawn, I turned around myself and started up the stairs. Toward Win’s room.

\*\*

I walked past our room, smiling to myself as I heard Jess humming deeper inside as she got dressed. The sun was up and full as I came to Win’s door – streaming through the window upstairs, washing the still-bare walls in warm gold. Win’s door was closed, Win’s door was closed – a habit she picked up after potty training; she always closed the door on the way back into her room if she had to get up in the middle of the night for some reason. I reached for the handle and pressed my ear to the wood, listening for the sounds of my girl sleeping.

Nothing.

I eased the door open.

Win’s bed was empty. Blankets a messy coil at the foot, pillow almost bare.

Except for Milkshake. Except for *fucking* Milkshake.

The room didn’t have any of the warmth from the outside hall. It felt… hollow. Empty.

I took a slow step inside, shutting the door again, my eyes sweeping the room. I didn’t see Win’s new doll anywhere – that one didn’t have a name yet and I was glad of it. Hoping she’d forget about it, hoping she wouldn’t latch on to it like she had that ashen snake. It would be so much easier to take that way – to get rid of.

*creeaaak*

My gaze shot to the nook. The toybox was open, its black lid angled back.

For a moment, I didn’t understand what I was seeing—two small legs, pajama cuffs bunched at the ankle, feet hooked over the edge. Half my daughter’s body – inside the gaping mouth of that shadow thing. The rest of her vanished inside.

“Win.” My voice came out flat, too quiet.

No answer.

I dashed across the room and grabbed her around the waist. She twisted in my arms, immediately struggling, small hands clutching something to her chest. I gasped, surprised, and tried to keep my grip on her.

“Let go!” she shrieked, writhing. “LET GO.”

“Win, stop. STOP,” I said, finding myself screaming as I yanked her back and out of the nook. I felt what she was holding on to pressing against me, a lump of cold and wet. It was repulsive, and in the dreamy scramble of the moment the first thought that lit up my mind was that it was dead, that it was a dead thing Win had and she was squeezing it so tight against herself.

“Drop it baby,” I said, my mouth going dry, “drop it now, what…what is that?”

Win’s eyes shot to mine. Her face was flushed, eyes bright. She wailed, her arms going limp as she started to cry, sloping against my shoulder. I held her closer to me, an entirely different sting of tears welling in my eyes.

Win dropped the thing. I felt it land on my bare feet, and I gasped. And, I hate myself very much for admitting this – but my first reaction was to drop Win, after feeling the way that frigid lump felt against the tops of my bare feet. It was lizard instinct, the kind that knows to run when you see a shadow creeping up behind you out of the corner of your eye.

But Dad instincts won. I squeezed Win tight, stepping around the thing and away from the nook. 

The toybox lid slammed shut.

I moaned. My heart was throbbing, my guts wrung. Win held on tight to me, pressing her face against me, her wails rising as I spun around to look at the box.

It was silent. Eerie. Still.

I heard footsteps pounding down the hall – Jess. I hugged Win tighter, burying my face in her hair.

“Shhh, shh,” I said, my own voice shaking, “it’s okay, daddy’s here. I’m here, I’m with you, I’m here.”

I repeated my litany as the door to Win’s room shuddered in its frame.

“Robert? What’s going on?”

I could hear Jess on the other side of the door, see the knob rattling. I heard her grunt before she gave three short slamming knocks.

“ROBERT.”

Had I closed the door? I moved to open it, breathing hard, when my foot brushed the thing on the floor once more.

I recoiled, feeling bile sluice up my throat even before I laid eyes on the thing. I looked down, expecting to see something rotten and awful, something that should never be in my daughter’s room. I stared, struck dumb and disgusted, down at the lump on the floor.

It was, of course, a toy. A new toy, one I’d never seen before – and larger than the others. Its body was lopsided, stitched from mismatched fabric: faded doily webbings, shredded silks, threadbare linens. All of them separate shades of grey, a bouquet of ash. The shape of the thing was uneven, and I couldn’t tell if the fabric was supposed to be a dress or a shirt or a blouse. It looked – half-finished.

My mind retched the word: *undigested.*

The thing had two button eyes, one missing, leaving only a frayed circle of thread. The one that remained, however, was smoke-white and glassy. Staring down at the thing, I almost thought I saw myself reflected in its haze.

“What the hell is GOING ON?!” I heard Jess shout, from the hallway.

Hearing her voice, the strain, the horrible rise in pitch at the end, broke me out of my shock. I reached for the door in a rush, turning the knob. Hearing the lock click as I swung it open.

Jess was on the other side, her face almost as red as Win’s.

“Whathappenedwhathappened,” she said, twice and fast, slurring her words together. She was already stepping in the room, reaching for Win. Taking her from me.

I reached for her, the same way I’d wanted to reach for the warmth in the kitchen hours ago — but this time she twisted away, her back to me. The box creaked behind her, long and low, a settling groan.

Like it was breathing.

I let Jess take Win from me, my gaze shifting back to the thing on the floor. The cyclopean bundle.

“What is that baby,” I heard myself say, before I realized I was speaking.

Win’s face was buried in Jess’s shoulder, and she raised it, her face twisted with anger and confusion.

“It’s mine,” she said, breathless. “It was in the hallway.”

My mouth went dry. “What hallway? What?”

She didn’t answer – just hugged Jess tighter, her cheek pressing into her mother’s neck.

“Jess, I…”

But Jess just looked at me. Something unreadable in her stare. I felt it shrivel me, and suddenly all the menace in the room was gone. I felt empty, confused and dumb.

“you’re acting *in-sane*,” Jess hissed.

I opened my mouth to reply, but Jess stepped out of the room, barreling down toward the other end of the hallway. Back to our room.

I turned around to glance once more at the toybox before following them. The shadows underneath the chitinous wood were deeper than they should have been in the spilling daylight, pooling and oily at the bottom. I glared at it, waiting for it to open, waiting for it to creak.

But there was nothing. Once again, the fucking thing was *still*.

\*\*

By the time I came downstairs, Jess was in the entryway, kneeling in front of Win and buttoning a dress up the girl’s back – it was nice, almost too nice; floral print and pressed smooth. Win hadn’t worn it since Easter. Win was struggling to try and get the dress off, heavy-salted tears still lying fat and swollen on her face.

A small overnight bag sat open on the bench, half-filled with Jess’s clothes. The plastic snack bag was next to it, and beside that too were Jess’s toiletries.

There was nothing of mine.

Win whined, a pitiful little cry, and slumped down on the entryway wall as I came close. Jess froze, her face locked in a scowl. She watched me from the corner of her eye, standing up slowly.

“What are you doing?” I asked.

Jess gesticulated with both of her hands in front of her – an inferred ‘duh’.

“I’m taking her to my parents. Alone.,” she said, her tone already hard.

“Jess –”

“What the hell was that? I mean, she’s shaking, Rob. She’s scared out of her mind.”

“She was in the box,” I said. “Halfway inside.”

“It’s a *toybox*.” Jess zipped the bag with one sharp pull. “Not a trapdoor. Not some – ”

“You didn’t see it.” I stepped closer. “The way she was in there. The way she was holding that thing, I mean, it felt disgusting…”

“What felt disgusting?”

“The toy,” I said, “the…thing she had.”

“It’s a toy, Robert. She’s a kid. Kids play. You’re the one turning it into some something, something it isn’t ever going…” She stopped herself, glanced at Win, lowered her voice. “You’re scaring her.”

I looked at Win. She stared back, peeking up through her bangs which had spilled loose over her head. Her eyes were shiny and wet, her lip trembling.

I wanted to go to her. I wanted to scoop her up into my arms and hold her. I wanted to apologize to her a hundred thousand times with a hundred thousand kisses all over her head. I wanted to take the fear I had put into her, siphon it out, and remove every hard thought flowing through her head.

I wanted her Daddy to make it all better. But Jess stepped between the two of us, reaching a hand down for Win’s. Our daughter took it, -- standing up and locked eyes with me once more.

“It’s mine,” she said softly, almost a whisper.

Jess stroked her hair. “I know, honey. We’re just going to go see Grammie and Grandpie for a little while.”

But Win was still looking at me, clutching the edges of her dress and pulling it up over her knees. Her voice was steady now:

“It’s not for you,” she said.

The words slit their way into my mind. I stood still, meeting Win’s gaze. She stared through me. And even then, even in that moment and knowing what was coming, it felt like there was no one else in the entryway but the two of us.

Jess stood, sweeping Win close as she opened the door. She picked up our girl with one hand while the other looped though the bags’ handles. A late summer gust rushed in, filling the entryway with hot, bitter warmth. The air wet like breath.

“Don’t follow us,” she said. “Just… let us breathe for the day. Take some time and, I don’t know. Relax.”

I opened my mouth to respond – to try and convince them to stay. To argue, to push back, to tell them I was coming too.

But Win’s words were still buried in me. I felt so full – of dread, of confusion. Of a vague and helpless anger. It was all enough to make me burst…and yet I felt paralyzed, that I myself was just another fixture of the house – just some unwanted thing left to stand and witness another leaving love.

And what if Jess was right? What if I was the one making everything this way?

Did I want it to be this way?

The door shut behind them, the sound echoing through the house. I stayed there in the doorway, watching through the window set into the front door at Jess’s back as she went down the steps, Win’s small head resting on her shoulder, bobbing up and down – her eyes fluttering shut. The sudden warmth dissipated with the door shut, sealing out the sounds of their retreat – the engine starting, the slow backup down our driveway. I watched as our car drifted down the street without a sound. the quiet in the house shifting again – not settling this time but holding its breath.

Glutted with the words Win had whispered.

*It’s not for you.*

\*\*

I don’t know how long I stood in the empty entryway. I lingered longer than I should have, hands in my pockets, staring at Win’s backpack. Jess must have left it in her rush to get out and by the time I noticed it they had been gone for too long. It was hot pink and covered with blue polka-dots. It was also zipped tight. I didn’t know what was inside, so I left it where it was. Because, for several long moments, I thought if I kept looking that maybe I’d hear the car back up again. Hear the door open. Hear her voice calling for me like nothing had happened.

The house felt airless, not empty – not exactly – but suspended. Like every room was holding its breath. But the quiet never went away. It just… waited.

I drifted from room to room, trying to shake my thoughts loose. My eyes skimmed the places no one was—the living room, the kitchen, the hallway to the stairs. The corners where shadows pooled like water.

I kept going, unable to stop, pacing the downstairs in tighter and tighter loops. Circles around Jess and Win. Circles around the toybox. Around the thing I’d seen. Around what I’d done. Each lap pulling the walls closer, each turn drawing me in.

Everywhere felt wrong without Win. Without Jess.

My mind kept replaying what I’d seen in her room, like a broken clip on a loop – the pale cuffs of her pajamas disappearing into the toybox, her little heels spinning over the edge. That lump of cold in her arms.

Except, each time I ran it back, the edges started to shift and blur.

  
*Maybe she hadn’t fallen all the way in. Maybe she was just leaning over the edge.*

  
*Maybe the lid didn’t slam — maybe it just fell.*

*Maybe the lid did open easily, maybe it’d just been stuck when I tried, the wet paint sticking with humidity.*

*Maybe she really had found that thing in the hallway, and I’d—*

I sat down hard in one of the kitchen chairs, the breath rushing out of me.

Jess’s voice came back in perfect detail. *You’re scaring her.* It landed heavier this time. Made my skin itch.

Was that what she saw? Not a father keeping his daughter safe, but some paranoid lunatic grabbing his kid and shouting at her about nothing?

I pressed my hands to my face and stayed there. The dark behind my eyelids was safer. But when I opened them, all I could see was Win.

I took out my phone, unlocking it and composed a quick text to Jess:

“Hey. Sorry for earlier. I know I can be a lot sometimes. Hope you and Win are having a good time with your parents.”

And then:

“Love you both.”

The air in the kitchen felt thick, like I couldn’t get enough of it down my throat. My fingers itched for something to do, anything that would stop the circling.

The toys.

I went upstairs and gathered both Milkshake and the new lump doll. I didn’t look at them too closely. I didn’t want to know if they were warm or cold. I just put them all in an old laundry basket, carried it through the back door, and locked them in the garage.

It helped a little. But not enough.

I came back inside, opened my laptop at the kitchen table. The screen lit my face in the stillness, and I tried not to stare at my dim reflection in the monitor. I signed in, minimizing all my work tabs, and opened a new tab. I stared at the empty search bar, not sure what to type.

Then it came to me. I typed: **“60 Adams house history.”**

It was our house address. Nothing came up at first — just realtor blurbs, aerial maps, a few grainy shots of the property from when the last owners had it listed. But there were no photos listed anywhere taken inside the house. None of them showed the nook. None of them showed the toybox.

I tried other searches: *60 Adams accidents.* *60 Adams deaths.* *60 Adams children.*

A few old news clippings turned up, scanned crooked into the county archive. I expanded my search, replacing our address with the name of the town and county. Still, there was mostly nothing. Fundraisers, lost pets, a fire at a gas station that’s been a vape shop for as long as we'd lived here.

I leaned back in my chair, staring at the screen. My reflection met my stare, my eyes tired and too wide. I blinked, looking around the kitchen for the first time. Already it was dusk. I checked my phone, but I didn’t have a single message.

I almost closed the laptop. I almost let myself believe there was nothing to find. That the absence of proof meant I could shut this down and go sit in the living room until Jess came back. Maybe if I couldn’t forgive myself I could at least distract myself enough to forget. Bury myself on the couch in a blanket, order a pizza and maybe pick up some beer from the liquor store down the road – or maybe something stronger. Jess would be back that night, she had to be. At the very latest she would on Sunday. I wouldn’t have long to myself and maybe if I numbed the time I wouldn’t keep feeling this way all night – or all day tomorrow.

God I hoped it wouldn’t be that long.

I looked down at the laptop again, one more time before I shut it off. And that’s when I saw it.

A thumbnail on a page for the *Sevrin Hill Historical Society*, some buried section of their website that hadn’t been updated in years – white background with blue bulleted hyperlinks. I clicked on one of them: “Community Picnic — August 8th, 1987.”

The photo loaded slow, the pixels knitting themselves into shapes. Rows of folding chairs on the lawn in front of an old town hall. People holding paper plates and sweating in the August sun. People that looked like they could be anyone and be anywhere.

And near the bottom edge of the frame, apart from the others – a girl, maybe six years old. Standing alone in the grass. Her expression was unreadable, almost blurred by the sun.

But in her arms, hanging loose against her side, was something long and striped.

I leaned closer to the screen. My hand went to the trackpad, zooming until the image broke into little squares. But it didn’t matter how close I got. I knew the shape.

Milkshake. Or…something that looked exactly like it.

I leaned in closer, squinting, trying to let my mind run over the pixels. Trying to synthesize what I couldn’t define make sense in my mind. It was like I was looking at an old Magic Eye poster – the truth was in there, I just had to relax my focus, let my mind fill in the details.

The more I looked at the thing in the girl’s arms, the more sense it made to me. The thing in the girl’s arms was Milkshake. But the more I looked at the girl…

She was plump, and her face had the grim acceptance of the relentlessly bullied. She was short, the Girl Scout uniform she wore ill-fitted and looked even in the low quality of the image like it needed to be washed. And there was something over her eye. It could have been a trick of the lens or a mote of dust but…the closer I looked, the more I was sure. It was an eyepatch. Medical, white and wide, covering her left eye.

The same eye missing from the doll upstairs. Win’s newest plaything.

I scrolled down to the caption. The words were simple, nothing strange:  
*Sevrin Hill residents celebrate at the farmer’s market.*

That was all. No note about the snake. No explanation for why she was standing alone, away from the other kids. Not that I really expected there to be one. Still, I felt like I was on to something. The coincidence, the eerie resemblance, was too great.

I sat there a long time, staring at that girl’s pale, unreadable face.

Then it came to me, clicking back to the previous page. I typed the year from the original link on the historical site in my search bar and followed it with “Sevrin Hill girl scouts”.

A few pages popped up, but most of it was irrelevant. Some of the results directed me back to the county’s public records, and so I filtered my search to only show results from there. I clicked on a few dead ends and found more than a few dead links. I was almost out of search results when I got lucky.

Another photo – this one a faded black and white. A line of young girls sat under a mural – the same one I’d seen with Win and Jess downtown while we’d walked over for dinner a little while ago: fields of sunflowers of varying sizes and skill in composition. The girls were all wearing smocks, and some of them had paint smudged around their noses and eyes. And there, at the very end and almost shoved out of frame, was the girl from the farmer’s market photo.

A slinking, ringed serpent wound around her shoulder.

Below, the caption read “Troop 217. From left to right: Lenore Adams, Cary Ann Clark, Stephanie Cole, Marissa Trailor, and June Howard.”

June Howard. That was the girl’s name.

I copied and pasted it into the search bar, my heart beating fast. I made my search “June Howard Sevrin Hill”. I hesitated for a moment and then added “disappeared” before jamming the enter key.

I clicked the top result.  
It was a scan of the Sevrin Hill Gazette from 1992, the grain ghosted into the page like it was printed on ancient skin. I leaned closer to the screen, squinting at the headline:

**LOCAL GIRL STILL MISSING**

The article was barely three paragraphs. An afterthought between a notice about a pancake breakfast and an ad for lawnmower repair. I skimmed it, breathing faster and faster with each line.

*Authorities continue to search for 11-year-old June Howard, missing since the evening of September 2…last seen walking home from a friend’s house in the Adams Street area, near Hollow Hill Road…quiet and shy…missing her left eye, often wears a white medical patch…no new leads.*

It was the photo that stopped me.

She stood alone, framed from the knees up, her expression flat in a way only a kid who’s been through too much can manage. The white eyepatch was there, stark against her skin. In one hand was a thick hardcover book, the other a plastic terrarium. Curled up inside was a small, ringed snake. But I wasn’t looking at her face or the snake.

Behind her was a white house with a sharply pitched roof and a narrow front porch. One corner sagged, the same way ours did. The windows were set too close together. The siding was split under the eaves in a way I knew by touch.

I didn’t have to check the caption. I didn’t have to count the shingles or match the railings.

It was this house.

*Our* house.

I sat there staring at the screen, my hands resting uselessly on either side of the keyboard. The girl’s face filled my mind — the blunt, guarded expression, the white medical patch swallowing one eye. The same side missing from the doll upstairs.

June Howard.

The name kept spiraling in my mind, an undercurrent to every thought.

I looked again at the old photographs – the farmer’s market, the troop mural. Both times, the snake was there, draped around her like a stuffed animal for any other kind of child. Milkshake, or something so close it didn’t matter.

Maybe there was a practical explanation. Some eccentric neighbor or overzealous parent with a sewing kit and too much time on their hands, making toys to match a pet snake for the lonely girl down the street. A gift that, by some coincidence, had outlived her and ended up in our house years later. That could happen, I told myself. Small towns hold on to things. People die, boxes get donated, junk ends up in attics and thrift stores and – sometimes – in the hands of children who don’t know the history behind them.

But the more I tried to settle into that version, the less it fit. It was too neat. Too bloodless. I could feel it in the pit of me, in that place Jess would call paranoia but which I knew was something else entirely. A sharper kind of knowing. There was a ring to it – the resonance of truth vibrating inside my skull – that this wasn’t coincidence, and it wasn’t harmless. I needed to trust that, even if she wouldn’t. Especially if she wouldn’t.

My eyes drifted up, toward the ceiling. The attic was the one part of this house we hadn’t seen when we toured it. After Jess and I had torn down the boards during our first week here, we’d swept out the splinters and insulation and then started sliding things up there we didn’t need right away. Winter coats. Boxes of old books. A few sealed cartons left in the coat closet from the previous owners that I’d never gotten around to opening. The sealed boxes…

Now, the thought of those forgotten remnants made my skin prickle. Maybe there was something left behind. Something of the one-eyed girl, something of June’s. And if there was, I wanted to see it for myself.

\*\*

I climbed slowly, my palms sticking to the rails. The attic pressed in around me as soon as my head cleared the opening. It was the same as I remembered: the pitched roof – a tent of dark beams, the scattered floorboards over insulation puffing out from between joists, and the slow, oppressive heat curling around me. My breath felt heavy in it.

A few of our own boxes sat stacked near the attic stairs, labeled in Jess’s neat handwriting. Beyond them, the cartons from the previous owners slouched against one wall, the tape yellow and curling at the edges. For a second, I just crouched there, staring, the hair on my forearms rising for no reason I could name.

I started toward them, stepping lightly along the narrow plywood path laid to keep from crushing the insulation. The floor flexed under my weight. I knelt at the first box, traced the faded writing scrawled across the cardboard – indecipherable – and popped the top.

Inside was a mess of paperbacks, most of them damp-soft at the edges, and a few ceramic figurines packed in yellowed newspaper. I shifted them aside, looking for something… more. Something that would connect.

Beneath the books and brittle newsprint was a layer of toys – cheap plastic farm animals, a jumble of hair clips, and a pair of jelly sandals gone cloudy with age. I dug deeper, my fingers catching on the cracked edge of a photo frame. Inside, faded almost to nothing, was a picture I recognized instantly—two little girls in early-90’s puffers, cheeks red from the cold, their parents standing behind them. Candace and Marie. The worn twin of the photo Jess and I had found in the downstairs coat closet. We’d found other traces of them when we first moved in – marker scribbles on the upstairs baseboards, a pair of children’s spades behind the shed, a few other photographs tucked in odd places. Little artifacts of a family’s life left behind and outgrown like discarded cicada shells.

I felt the familiar sag of disappointment as I set the frame aside. No snake. No eyepatch. No June. Just more pieces of someone else’s history.

But as my hand left the frame, something made me pause. I picked it back up, this time looking harder at the girls’ faces. One of them – Marie, I thought – had the same pale hair and glass-bright eyes I remembered from the doll Win had in her hands the night I’d carried her down from her room. Not just blue eyes, but *those* blue eyes, the same clear, almost unnatural shade, crystalline frost. I stared at her smile, wide and fixed, and felt my skin prickle.

The connection was loose, frayed—but it was there. The doll Win had been holding the night I’d taken her from her room. It was someone. One of these girls.

I lowered the frame into my lap, holding it there longer than I meant to, the attic’s still heat settling heavy over me. Enveloping me. Licking at me.

And then I heard it.

Not a creak, not the dry flex of wood, but a low *groan* from below. It wasn’t the water softener, the boards shifting in the house. It wasn’t any appliance or outer wind.

It was squelching. Luridly alive, an unmuffled groan that I felt in my bones. Deeper than a creak, wetter than wood should sound. A long, deliberate sound – something working its jaw after a slow meal.

It came again – shorter this time, clipped, a swallowed chuckle. The sound reminded me of something I’d heard before, and it only took a moment for me to put it together. I felt sick, unbalanced, even as it came to me.

It sounded like the toybox. The opening of its jaws. The exaggerated sibling to its taunting creaking moan.

I knew I should go downstairs, get my hammer, smash the fucking thing apart and take the splintered remains outside to burn them. But instead, I found myself turning toward the far side of the attic, toward the sound’s echo in my head. Hesitating only for a moment, I started toward the back end of the attic, the section we hadn’t used, running my hand along the bare wood of the slanted attic walls for support as the floorboarded path narrowed.

That’s when my hand brushed a section of wall that felt…off. Too smooth.

I turned my head, swaying slightly on my feet—the boards here were thinner, narrower, uneven in their fit. Their grain didn’t match the rest of the attic—darker, almost bruised. I thumbed on my phone’s flashlight, already bracing for something I didn’t want to see.

The beam caught on a stretch of boards slick with a black, oily residue, as if something deep in the wall had burst and seeped slow for years. The stain seemed to breathe faintly under the light, as if there were pressure behind it. When I pulled my hand away, there was a faint film webbing between my fingers, sticky and metallic in the air and on my tongue when I reflexively swallowed.

I pushed the first board. It flexed, giving before tearing away with a damp snap. I tossed it down into the insulation and reached for another. Each one peeled off softer, wetter, colder. The dampness seemed to cling, not just to my hands but under my nails, sinking in. By the time I’d cleared the last of them, I was shivering.

Beneath the boards was not more wood, but stone. Black stone – slick and glistening, reflecting the light in the same way the toybox lid did, a shifting sheen that made me think of the way an eye moves under a lid. At the center of this surface was an opening – low, jagged, puckered at the edges. A split seam in the wall, raw and uneven, as if it had grown out of the house.

I crouched low, the rafters pressing down on me, and angled the light inside. The corridor beyond was paved with uneven stones mortared with something pale and fibrous. The walls pressed in tight at odd angles – as if they had shifted and locked into place centuries apart. The cold that rolled out was a deep cold, bloodless and still.

It wasn’t just darkness in there. It had weight. It had depth that didn’t belong in the shape of this house –  the way a body can feel its wounds deeper than the shallow scar tissue.

I dropped to my hands and knees, breath loud in my ears. I stuck my head inside, the stone damp and cold against my arms, angling the light forward. The beam bled into the dark and disappeared.

Somewhere ahead, in that thin black channel, something shifted. Soft. Deliberate.

My throat tightened. I jerked back, scraping my shoulder against the frame.

For a moment I stayed there, crouched, my breath ragged, phone still aimed at the hole. Waiting for the sound again. Waiting for…something.

But the corridor was still.

I stood, my knees popping, and backed away until my spine pressed against the far wall, nearly falling into a pocket of insulation as I did. The hole waited in the beam of my light—patient. Expectant.

I killed the flashlight. The dark rushed in.

Then I turned, forcing my way down the attic stairs, sliding the plywood cover back behind me.

I didn’t look up again – not once. I went downstairs, flung open the front door, and walked to the end of the driveway. I sat on the curb, cross‑legged.

I looked down at my hands and watched them shake. Black filth under my fingernails. I breathed, hard and fast, trying to calm myself down.

“Headlights, baby, c’mon headlights please,” I repeated, I prayed, aloud to the quiet of the evening, “c’mon, c’mon, come home baby pleaaase…”

I sobbed, finally letting my head drop into my hands. I wanted my girls, I wanted home the way it was even just a day ago. That I’d take, I’d take anything over what I had seen. What I’d *felt*.

But cutting under even that? I had a different kind of dread. A dread that resounded in me and, even now, grew louder and louder. Echoing, repeating, demanding I feel it.

It was this – Jess wouldn’t believe me. Even after everything, even after dragging her up there to show her, I had a sinking knowing at the very center of me that all of this would be another example of breaking from them. From their reality.

No, Jess may not believe me. And I would spare myself the trial of getting her to, that I knew now. Because whatever the fuck was going on in this house – with the toys, the toybox, the horrible, lonely way in the attic – I would have to deal with it and spare them of the grief. Even if Jess never believes me, I know what I heard.

I would fix this. I would fix this for our family, for my girls.",2,1755691210.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False

One time, I was scrolling through Instagram, watching videos of people in the street doing incredibly embarrassing and absurd things. I kept wondering, why do they do these silly things? Is it for views and followers? Maybe. That's what was on my mind until a reel popped up from an Egyptian content creator who was doing ""rejection therapy."" His whole idea was to try a hundred new things and face rejection. Whether it was asking to make his own coffee at a cafe, or requesting a look inside a fire engine from a firefighter, and so on.
As I watched his videos, one after another, I discovered that most of his requests were accepted, not rejected. Not only that, but they brought a smile to his face for trying something new, and to the people he asked, because they saw it as an appreciation for their work and effort. I also realized that even if you get rejected once, twice, or three times, you'll eventually be accepted. That's because people are all different and each person has a unique personality in this vast world. Furthermore, rejection will only make you stronger, more determined, and more confident in other social situations—whether at work, a wedding, or any social event. You'll remember that even if you look silly or misunderstood for a moment, others will quickly forget. That situation will be buried as if it never happened, because everyone has bigger things on their minds than your momentary slip-up.

1mvcndr,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleansRealEstate/comments/1mvcndr/hidden_gem_of_the_month_marlyvillefontainebleau/,Hidden Gem of the Month: Marlyville–Fontainebleau,"# Marlyville–Fontainebleau is one of those Uptown neighborhoods people often drive past without realizing how much it has to offer. Quiet oak-lined streets, a mix of historic and modest homes, and a strong sense of community make this pocket a standout, especially if you’re looking for value compared to pricier Uptown submarkets.

**Neighborhood vibe**  
This area developed mainly in the 1920s–40s, giving it an eclectic mix of California bungalows, Arts & Crafts cottages, doubles, and a few show-stoppers along Versailles Boulevard. It feels like a suburban retreat tucked inside the city, neighbors chatting on porches, kids on bikes, and plenty of shade from mature trees.

**Housing highlights**

* Prices range from $109K starter condos/fixers to $1.65M historic estates
* The *sweet spot*: most homes sell in the **$300K–$500K range**, averaging \~1,700–2,000 sq ft
* Median price sits around **$389,500**, with a median $206/sq ft—solid value for Uptown
* Buyers can find everything from first-time opportunities to legacy properties

**Market tempo**  
Homes take a bit longer to sell here, median 74 days on market, which creates room for negotiation and opportunity. The last two homes that went pending were on the market for 27 days. 

**Location perks**  
Just 3 miles from downtown, you’re minutes from Tulane and Loyola, Audubon Park, and Carrollton’s streetcar line. Groceries, coffee shops, and BBQ joints are nearby, but the neighborhood itself stays quiet and residential.

  
Marlyville–Fontainebleau offers something rare in Uptown: a wide range of housing options at approachable price points, without sacrificing charm or location. If you’re searching for a hidden gem that balances value with character, this neighborhood deserves a closer look.

Here's a snapshot of the homes in [Marlyville](https://ewbank.kw.com/area/marlyville-new-orleans-la/151932) and [Fontainebleau](https://ewbank.kw.com/area/fontainebleau-new-orleans-la/107148).",1,1755690809.0,NewOrleansRealEstate,0,1.0,False

I am on biologics for half a year now, it gave me back life. THOUGH, it's tough with the random pain, sore throat etc.

When I go climbing I have a very dedicated warmup routine, I don't jump from heights.

Yet, I feel worse than people who don't give a single flying fuck about their health. Just yesterday I had to end a boulder session early due do hip pain. I just want to cry man.

1mvcjnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningTrainingShoes/comments/1mvcjnr/explore_joomra_whitin_mens_running_shoes_review/,Explore Joomra Whitin Men's Running Shoes Review Lightweight and Cushioned Athletic Sneakers!,"Having spent enough time putting the Joomra Whitin Men's Supportive Running Shoes Cushioned Athletic Sneakers through their paces (literally and figuratively), I believe I’ve cracked the code on what makes them tick—and what could be improved. Whether pounding the pavement during a morning jog or just slipping these on to grab coffee, I’m confident this review will give you the inside track on what it’s like to live in these shoes daily.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
The first thing that struck me when I opened the box was how visually appealing these sneakers are. The engineered knit upper has this sleek, slightly structured design that hints at both style and practicality. It feels modern yet understated, which is perfect for someone like me who wants something minimal but not boring. The neutral tones make them versatile enough to pair with running gear or casual wear. Plus, the added patch on the upper to prevent lace tearing—genius touch right there. I’ve seen way too many sneakers lose their form because the laces dig through the fabric, so seeing this small but thoughtful feature was a win.

**Comfort on the Go**  
Wearing these shoes feels like stepping into a cozy yet supportive cloud. The padded collar wraps gently around the ankles, so there’s no chafing, even after extended wear. That lace-up closure allowed me to get a snug, customized fit. I’ve worn these for long walks, quick errands, and a couple of light hikes, and not once did my feet feel pinched or sore. The foam midsole stands out—it’s cushy enough to absorb impact, but it holds its shape well, offering lasting durability. Running in these felt smooth and natural, partly because of the level platform design. The lower heel-to-toe drop truly promotes a more grounded stride.

[Grab Joomra Whitin Running Shoes on Amazon at a bargain price!](https://crosner.com/p/b087by2wyc/)

**Performance and Durability**  
Performance-wise, these sneakers deliver nicely for casual runners and walkers alike. The rubber outsole has this superb grip that kept me steady during an unplanned run in the drizzle. Whether on slick pavements or gritty paths, traction was never an issue. That said, these are not heavy-duty trail runners—you’ll want to stick to roads or even indoor gym tracks. After weeks of near-daily use, including several gym sessions, the outsole still looks surprisingly fresh. The knit fabric holds up well against wear and tear, and cleaning them doesn’t require much effort—a damp cloth usually does the trick.

**Target Audience Fit**  
These shoes seem perfect for people who need reliable, lightweight, and budget-friendly athletic footwear. I can see them being a hit with fitness enthusiasts who prefer cross-training and light running. Gym goers will appreciate their flexibility and comfortable fit for those treadmill sprints or lifting sessions. Even non-athletic folk who are just on their feet all day would find these suitable. However, if you’re training for marathons or ultra-long stretches, you might crave additional arch support.

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Lightweight design that doesn’t sacrifice support.  
- Patch reinforcement prevents lace damage.  
- High-density foam midsole cushions impact effectively.  
- Grippy yet durable rubber outsole works well on multiple surfaces.  
- Versatility to transition between casual and athletic use.  

**Areas That Need Attention**  
- The level platform isn’t for everyone—if you’re used to more pronounced arch support, the experience may feel unusual initially.  
- Ideal for light to moderate use, but likely won’t cut it for hardcore trail runners.  
- Knit fabric, though durable, might not be the warmest option during colder months.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing these shoes to other similar products, like the Asics Gel-Venture or Nike Revolution 6, there are definite pros and cons for the Joomra Whitin sneakers. For instance, the Asics option excels with its more robust outsole for trail settings, but it’s bulkier and less breathable than the Joomra sneakers. Meanwhile, Nike’s Revolution model offers a more cushy midsole for long runs but falls short in terms of affordability. Comparing to both brands, Joomra’s product strikes a middle ground by delivering both lightweight comfort and decent grip, without tipping into premium pricing territory.

**Smart Spending**  
In terms of value, I’d say these sneakers absolutely justify their cost. While they’ll never replace high-end running models or specialized designs, they’re great for their intended use. Whether you hit the gym sometimes, head out for walks as a routine, or keep things low-impact, you’re not breaking the bank unnecessarily here.

1mvcim1,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mvcim1/the_message_in_the_sky/,The message in the sky,"I’ve always loved stargazing. There’s something about the quiet above the world that feels clean—untainted by the noise of life down here. That’s probably why I agreed to this trip: three days at an abandoned fire lookout tower with my best friend Leo and his sister Mara.

Leo’s the reason I’m into astronomy in the first place. We met in college, both insomniacs, both a little too obsessed with things we didn’t fully understand. He’s the kind of guy who laughs at ghosts but tears up at time-lapse videos of galaxies. A physics major with a soft heart.

Mara’s the opposite. Sharp as a blade, journalism student turned conspiracy blogger. Always chasing hidden truths and dark government secrets. She came on the trip for “content,” as she put it. I honestly just think she was lonely.

The first night was normal. Cold, quiet, uneventful. We set up camp, drank instant coffee, and tried to remember constellations.

The second night, everything changed.

We were lying on the roof of the tower around midnight when the stars began to… rearrange.

Not fall—move. Slowly. Deliberately. Like someone behind them was dragging each point of light into place. One by one, stars shifted until they formed symbols, then letters. It took a few minutes, but when the last star locked into place, the sky clearly read:

WE SEE YOU.

We laughed at first. Mara grabbed her camera, whispering, “This is it, this is real.” Leo didn’t laugh. He just stared.

Then came the noise. A low, humming vibration, like a distant generator—or something alive, breathing. The tower shook. My skin prickled like it was being pulled toward the sky.

“I don’t like this,” Leo said quietly. “This isn’t—this shouldn’t be possible.”

I looked at him. He was shaking.

“Leo?” I asked. “What’s wrong?”

He didn’t answer right away.

Finally, he said, “I… saw that message before. In a dream. A month ago. I didn’t tell anyone because—how do you explain that?”

Mara turned, her camera forgotten. “What do you mean, before?”

He looked at us, eyes wide. “In the dream, it wasn’t just the message. After it appeared, people started… disappearing. Like they were being taken. Like the sky was choosing.”

That’s when the stars shifted again. The letters broke apart and reformed, faster this time. A new message:

ONE OF YOU DOES NOT BELONG.

We stood there, frozen. The humming grew louder.

Mara whispered, “What does that mean?”

I didn’t have time to answer. The tower groaned, and the lights in the sky began to pulse—once… twice… then a long, blinding flash.

When I could see again, Leo was gone.

Not a trace. No scream, no sound. Just… gone.

Mara ran down the ladder, screaming his name. I stayed frozen on the roof, staring up. The stars were back to normal. Still, silent, innocent.

It’s been two nights since then. Mara won’t speak. She just writes in her notebook, muttering things I can’t hear.

Tonight, the stars moved again. New message.

NOW TWO REMAIN.

(Part two)

It’s been three days since Leo vanished.

Mara still won’t talk to me. She just writes. Pages and pages in a weathered notebook, scrawling in frantic, looping handwriting. I tried to peek once. She snapped it shut and hissed, “Not yet.” Her eyes look wrong now—wide, glassy, as if she’s staring through me at something farther away. Or deeper.

We’ve rationed the food, but neither of us is eating. Every sound outside sounds like footsteps. Every shadow moves just enough to make me doubt what I saw. The woods below the tower aren’t empty anymore. They’re watching.

Last night, the stars moved again. No message this time—just slow, methodical shifting, like they were… preparing.

Mara finally spoke. “It’s a test,” she said. Her voice was calm, too calm. “It’s always been a test.”

“A test for what?” I asked.

She didn’t answer. Instead, she held up a small, silver device. Not her phone. Something stranger—smooth, metal, no screen, no buttons. It looked… alien.

Leo had shown it to me once, back in college. Said he’d found it on a hiking trip near Area 51 during a student road trip. I thought it was a joke. I hadn’t seen it again until now.

“You had that the whole time?”

Mara smiled—cold, tight-lipped. “Leo thought it was a relic. I knew it was a key.”

“A key to what?”

She looked up at the sky. “To them.”

That night, I didn’t sleep. I waited, staring at the stars, waiting for another message, another disappearance. But nothing came.

At dawn, Mara was gone.

The notebook lay open on her sleeping bag. I picked it up with trembling hands. The last page was a diagram of the sky—each star carefully labeled, connected with scribbled lines and annotations.

In the margin, she had written:

“Only one of us was real.”

Below that:

“They don’t take humans. They take echoes.”

And finally:

“Check under the tower.”

The ground beneath the fire lookout was soft from the rain. I dug with my bare hands until my nails split and my fingers bled. And then I found them.

Bones.

A pile of them. Fresh. Small.

Leo’s glasses.

Mara’s necklace.

And then—my journal. Half-buried. Pages I didn’t remember writing.

And in the dirt, something else: a mirror.

I picked it up. My reflection stared back.

Except it didn’t move when I did.

It blinked.

Then smiled.

Above me, the stars began to rearrange again.

The mirror didn’t stop smiling.

I threw it across the clearing, but it didn’t shatter. Just landed face up, still grinning. My own face—no, something wearing my face—stared at me from the reflection. Unblinking.

Above, the stars pulsed again. A new message burned into the night.

YOU ARE THE LAST.

I should have run. But run where? The tower? The woods? Nowhere felt real anymore.

The trees whispered when the wind didn’t blow. The animals had vanished. Not even flies circled the bones I’d uncovered.

I took the notebook Mara left and returned to the tower, locking myself inside. Pages crinkled in my hand as I flipped back to older entries. Most of it was paranoid ramblings, coordinates, sketches of constellations.

Then I found something strange.

A list. Names. Hundreds of them. Crossed out, one by one.

Leo… crossed out.

Mara… crossed out.

And then—my name.

Also crossed out.

But in the margin beside it:
“Reinstated?”
“Observe longer. Pattern instability.”
“Possible retention of memory fragments.”

That’s when I heard the radio click on.

We hadn’t touched it in days. It was just an old emergency unit Leo insisted on bringing.

A burst of static. Then… a voice.

Not Mara’s. Not Leo’s. Not mine.

“Test Subject 73-B reactivation confirmed. Host body still responding. Proceeding with final observation.”

I froze.

Test subject?

Reactivation?

The stars pulsed once more. This time, no message—just light. Blinding, red, consuming. I dropped the notebook.

The walls of the tower began to peel—not fall apart, peel, like paper from a wall.

Behind them: metal.

Steel.

And then it clicked.

The fire tower wasn’t real.

None of it was.

Not the trees, not the sky, not the stars.

It was a simulation.

I stumbled outside. The forest flickered at the edges like an old film reel glitching. The ground beneath my feet pixelated and reformed with each step.

A new voice rang out. Smooth. Artificial.

“You’ve exceeded expectation. Cognitive retention beyond threshold.”

“It remembers.”

“End trial.”

I screamed—but no sound came out.

The world folded. Collapsed inward like origami. The stars collapsed with it, falling like dead pixels into the void.

And then I was back.

Lying on a cold metal table. Tubes in my arms. Needles in my spine. A glass ceiling above me, lined with figures in sterile suits.

One leaned in. Her voice was familiar.

Mara?

But different. Hollow. Detached.

She looked down at a clipboard. “Subject 73-B has achieved persistent identity formation. Memory bleed confirmed. Emotion sequencing intact.”

She tapped the glass.

I wanted to move, to scream, but I was paralyzed.

“Time to reset,” she said.

The lights dimmed.

Darkness again.

But just before everything vanished, I saw Leo. In the reflection of the glass. Not lying beside me.

Watching.

Smiling.

And he whispered:

“We never went to the tower. You were the test.”

Then the stars returned.

The play equipment was fantastic – bright slides, climbing nets, ball pits, and sections that catered to toddlers as well as older children. What struck me most was how safe and well-maintained everything was, giving parents peace of mind while kids dived into their adventures.

For adults, there was a relaxed café space that offered more than just basic snacks. I sat with a decent coffee and could still watch over the play zone without feeling like I was stuck on the sidelines. There was a nice community feel too, with parents chatting while their kids played happily together.

I took level 1&2 in 2024 in a third world country and the exam venue provided coffee/snack station, called us in a group of 5 to do the body inspection and escorted us to the exam room which allowed the rest of us to review our notes in the waiting room. The venue had lockers, clean bathrooms, comfortable seats.

A few days ago I sat L3 exam in a fairly developed country and my experience with the exam venue and proctors was a disaster. They made us all line for the inspection which meant we had to be in line for 15-20 minutes, even during the 30 minute break we had to manage our time so that we come back early just to wait in the line to be inspected for 15 minutes. Some of us even were late to the second session just because of this. There were 2 staff one of which knew nothing and were unable to accommodate candidates general questions or requests. The other person was a real proctor who had to monitor the exam rooms, do the inspections, also monitor the check in check out signings - this was too much for one person. The bathrooms were broken and far from the exam room. Somehow it was even locked during the 30 minutes break and we had to leave the building and use the bathroom of a nearby coffee shop. And then comeback, check in, wait for the proctor to come out from the exam room and inspect us. 

What were your experiences?

The one I visited in Exeter had such a thoughtful design – colourful play zones for children, comfortable seating for parents, and even a café serving proper coffee.

The play area itself was impressive, with plenty of space for children to explore safely. There were slides, climbing frames, tunnels, and little sections for toddlers so they didn’t get overwhelmed. It was great to see kids making new friends while having the freedom to run around in a safe environment.

What I liked most, though, was that parents weren’t forgotten. The seating was arranged so you could relax but still keep an eye on your child. The café felt like a place you’d choose to sit in even without kids in tow – which is rare for play centres.

Unlike traditional parties where you’re constantly worrying about activities, games, and keeping everyone happy, a play centre really takes that stress away.

At the last party we went to, the children dashed straight into the soft play area and didn’t stop laughing, climbing, and sliding for hours. The set-up included a decorated party room with balloons and a spread of food, which meant once the play was done, everyone gathered easily without fuss.

What made it even better was the atmosphere – parents weren’t just stuck on the sidelines, they could enjoy a coffee and a chat while the kids wore themselves out. It’s one of those win-win scenarios where everyone leaves happy, and the mess stays behind at the venue.

The play area itself was brilliant – colourful, spacious, and designed with plenty of different zones so children of all ages could find something to enjoy. From climbing frames to slides and little toddler corners, it kept my child happily entertained for ages. What I appreciated, though, was that while the kids were busy, the parents had space to breathe. A decent café with coffee and snacks, seating that wasn’t crammed in, and a general atmosphere that didn’t feel chaotic made a big difference.

Ear mites are common parasites that can affect cats and lead to various health issues if left untreated. Recognizing the symptoms of ear mites in cats is crucial for ensuring your feline friend receives prompt care. One of the most noticeable signs is excessive scratching at the ears. Cats will often rub their heads against furniture or the floor in an attempt to relieve their discomfort.

Another prominent symptom of ear mites in cats is the presence of dark, waxy discharge in the ear canal. This discharge can resemble coffee grounds and is a telltale sign of an infestation. Additionally, if you observe your cat shaking its head frequently or tilting it to one side, it could indicate ear mites, as the irritation can cause disorientation.

Owners should also be vigilant for any signs of inflammation or redness inside the ear. Infected ears may appear swollen, and a foul smell can emanate from the ear canal, signaling a secondary bacterial infection. Furthermore, cats infested with ear mites may exhibit changes in behavior, such as increased irritability or withdrawal, as the discomfort can affect their overall mood.

In some cases, you may notice hair loss around the ears due to continuous scratching. It's essential to check your cat regularly for these symptoms to ensure early intervention. If you suspect your cat has ear mites, consulting your veterinarian is advised for appropriate treatment options.

Being aware of the symptoms of ear mites in cats can make a significant difference in the health and well-being of your pet. Prompt action can help alleviate discomfort and prevent further complications.

For parents, it’s more than just sitting on the sidelines – there’s a welcoming café atmosphere where you can relax with a coffee while keeping an eye on your kids.

What struck me most was how balanced it all felt. Often, play centres can be loud or overwhelming, but here it felt calmer, brighter, and genuinely well thought-out.

Hey there, fellow Houston foodies and hospitality warriors! If you’ve found yourself bleary-eyed after a never-ending shift, coffee in hand and counting down the minutes until you can get some shut-eye, well, you’re in good company. Running a restaurant or bar in a bustling city like Houston isn’t for the faint of heart. Today, I’ll share a few candid thoughts about the daily challenges we face and how we're tackling them head-on.

---

**A Rollercoaster of Emotions: Staffing Woes (Frustrated)**

Let’s dive right into it—staffing. It’s been a dumpster fire scenario lately, especially post-pandemic. One week, you’re fully staffed and operational. The next, you’re scrambling to find cover for multiple shifts because half your staff called in sick.

Frustration is an understatement when you’re funneling time and resources into training only to see employees leave just as quickly. It’s tough, and it often feels like a never-ending cycle. 

**Lesson Learned: Flexibility is key.**

We’ve had to adopt more flexible staffing models and offer competitive incentives to keep our team motivated and engaged. Little things like an extra paid day off or performance bonuses can go a long way in retaining staff.

---

**Riding the Waves: Rising Costs (Exhausted)**

As if staffing challenges aren’t enough, we’re also battling rising costs. The price of everything from raw ingredients to utilities has skyrocketed. It feels like we’re always just one step ahead of the next hurdle, and the journey can be exhausting.

Cutting costs without cutting corners is the balancing act we’re all forced to master. We’ve had to renegotiate supplier contracts and even the portions of our dishes to keep our menu price manageable for our customers.

**Lesson Learned: Every dollar counts.**

We’ve learned to be meticulous about every line item in our budget. Staying financially savvy and being proactive about cost management have been crucial in keeping our doors open.

---

**Facing The Giants: Competition (Optimistic)**

Despite our challenges, the Houston food scene is booming, and while competition is fierce, it’s also incredibly inspiring. New restaurants and bars pop up almost weekly, each pushing us to innovate and stay sharp.

We’ve learned to view competition not just as a threat but as an opportunity to differentiate ourselves. Whether through unique menu items, exceptional service, or creative marketing, there’s always a way to stand out.

**Lesson Learned: Differentiation is crucial.**

Offering something unique—whether it’s a signature dish, a special event, or an unbeatable happy hour—can set you apart from the rest.

---

**Embrace the Future: Technology (Optimistic)**

Now, let’s tackle a topic that’s near and dear to my heart—technology. In today’s data-driven world, a modern POS system can be a game-changer. Switching to SkyTab has dramatically streamlined our operations, from real-time inventory management to detailed sales analytics.

Gone are the days of manual record-keeping and guesswork. SkyTab allows us to monitor our sales, track our best-selling items, and even manage employee schedules more efficiently. This has saved us countless hours and headaches.

**Lesson Learned: Invest in technology.**

A modern POS system like SkyTab is not just an expense; it’s an investment in efficiency and growth. It pays off in spades by simplifying many aspects of the business.

---

**Local Call to Action**

Houston, we’ve got each other’s backs. If you’re in the hospitality industry and facing similar challenges, consider upgrading your POS system to SkyTab. Trust me, it’s a game-changer. For all my local business owners, Advantage Merchant Services is our Houston-based, authorized SkyTab seller, and they’ve been instrumental in helping us make this transition smooth and effective.

Here's to navigating the highs and lows and serving up something extraordinary every day. Cheers!

1mvc8qw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductPerspectives/comments/1mvc8qw/assess_natruth_cleaning_tablets_for_coffee/,Assess Natruth Cleaning Tablets for Coffee Machines Worth It,"Jumping straight in, I've been trying out the NATRUTH 20 Packs cleaning tablets for a few weeks now, and I have to say, they’ve made my life noticeably easier. As someone who frequently uses kettles and coffee machines, dealing with limescale can be both unsightly and frustrating. This product caught my attention because it claimed to handle limescale in a natural yet efficient way, without any harsh chemical odors.

**Impressive Performance on Limescale Removal**  
These tablets genuinely deliver when it comes to limescale removal. I popped one into my kettle for a test after noticing a stubborn chalky layer. Within about 20 minutes, the inside looked almost brand new. The citric acid formula breaks down deposits seamlessly, leaving no residue behind. Using it in my coffee machine was just as effective. I found it particularly satisfying not having to scrub or use additional tools. It’s basically drop-and-forget, which is something I can certainly appreciate.

**Convenience at Its Best**  
One of the best aspects I found was the simplicity of use. All you have to do is put a tablet in, add water, let it dissolve, and watch the magic unfold. Thanks to their small size, these tablets fit snugly into kettles, coffee maker reservoirs, or even narrow stainless steel water bottles. I’ve even tested them on my shower head and iron—again, all excellent results. This versatility makes it a one-stop solution for many household appliances plagued by hard water damage.

[Find the best price for NATRUTH 20 Packs cleaning tablets on Amazon.](https://check.sanue.com/p/b0b24ptppj/)  

**Good Points**  
- Citric acid formula works effectively without leaving chemical odor.  
- Perfect for various daily-use appliances like kettles, coffee makers, and irons.  
- Easy to use; no scrubbing required.  

**Design and Packaging**  
The packaging itself leaves a bit to be desired. While the compact box is easy to store, the tablets lack individual wrapping, which can become an issue in humid climates. If left out or improperly sealed, they could crumble or lose effectiveness. However, the clean and tidy design of the overall kit means I don’t have to worry too much about extra storage hassles.

**Negatives**  
- Tablets need careful storage to avoid exposure to moisture.  
- Might require a second attempt on very heavy limescale buildup.  

**Product Competitors**  
In comparison to Durgol Descaler and De’Longhi EcoDecalk, I found the NATRUTH cleaning tablets to be more versatile in usage. While the Durgol liquid descaler offers a quick pour-and-rinse solution, it’s limited to coffee machines and kettles. De’Longhi’s EcoDecalk is eco-friendly but costs a bit more. The tablets from NATRUTH, being multi-use, are definitely more flexible and a better all-rounder. However, the liquid competitors can sometimes handle thicker buildups in fewer attempts, so it’s a trade-off depending on your specific needs.

**Cost-Effectiveness and Its Appeal for Budget Buyers**  
Considering how well these tablets perform and their wide applicability, the price makes them a sound investment. Each tablet brings astonishing value by restoring appliances to peak efficiency while preventing further damage from stubborn limescale. If you’re like me and use multiple small appliances daily, this is an extremely affordable way to extend their lifespan without splurging on regular maintenance or replacements. At this price point, it fits nicely into both budget-conscious and eco-aware households.

I am not sure wether I want a friendship or a relationship with her, since the situation is complicated (we both have partners), but I very much want her in my life.

For the last year and a half, we’ve had these long conversations where we share our ideals, our fears, our family stories, our political ideas…

We also lend each other books and send us songs that resonate with us and talk about our favorite films and tv shows.

We have this “secret society” in which only the two of us belong and fantasize about writing its manifesto.

We have gone on quite a few one on one dates where we walk through the park, go to a museum or take coffee, but mainly talk, and talk and talk.

In the last few months she’s been struggling with mental health issues and I’ve tried my best to show her I an her for here without smothering her. I understand her need of withdrawal and it doesn’t bother me if she “disappears” for a couple of days. We have had this long phone conversations which she says “cheers her up”.

She has been very grateful for this and even was surprised because I seem to understand her “more than herself”.

All of this sounds great, but after all this I’ve realized she is never the one to initiate contact or to propose to meet.

If I initiate, she continues and talks about herself to me, explains me her suffering, her dreams or whatever. But if I stop, she doesn’t reach out.

So I keep having these doubts. Is she only being friendly? Is she mirroring my attitude out of fear of confrontation? Would she set boundaries if she didn’t like my attention and interest on her?

I really love her and my priority is for her to be happy.

It’s marketed as a compact, durable, and versatile laptop suitable for students or anyone demanding portability and resilience in a daily workhorse. While there are many stand-out moments, it’s not without its trade-offs. Let’s dive in.

**Durable and Kid-Proof Design**  
The Dell Latitude 3190 immediately impressed me with its rugged build. The rubberized base, along with a spill-resistant keyboard, feels incredibly sturdy. I tested the spill resistance by knocking a half-full glass of water onto the keyboard (not intentionally, of course). Surprisingly, it withstood the incident without any hiccups. The display’s Corning Gorilla Glass NBT also handled scratches like a champ—as someone who tends to throw their laptop into a backpack alongside keys and pens, this feature was particularly appreciated. The laptop is clearly constructed to endure drops, locker mishaps, and the occasional coffee spill, making it a reliable choice for students or anyone notoriously hard on their tech.  

**Performance and Everyday Usability**  
Under the hood, this 2-in-1 features an Intel Celeron processor paired with 4GB of DDR4 RAM. Testing it out with basic tasks such as document editing, streaming HD videos, and multitasking with a handful of Chrome tabs showed it’s capable, though certainly not blazing fast. Switching between applications lagged slightly when I pushed it too far, like adding a dozen browser tabs alongside Spotify and Microsoft Word. Still, if you’re sticking to lighter workloads, it’ll serve you well.  

[Is Dell 3190 Latitude on sale? Check Amazon now.](https://batterydiscounter.com/p/b07rxh56c5/)  

**Display Quality and Touch Functionality**  
The 11.6-inch screen offers a resolution of 1366 x 768, which isn’t the sharpest, but for its size, it’s acceptable. The touchscreen responded smoothly, adding some fun and practicality when switching between tablet and laptop modes. I used it in tent mode while watching some Netflix shows, and the colors, while not as vibrant as a high-end display, were passable. One disappointment here is the brightness level; under harsh light or even a very sunny room, it struggled to remain visible.  

**Battery Life That’s Just Okay**  
Dell’s promise of a long-lasting battery is somewhat accurate. From my personal tests, the laptop averaged around six hours of use before requiring a charge. That included some light browsing, streaming, and a bit of writing work. While it got me through most of the workday, it might fall short for anyone who needs a laptop to last through extended hours of lectures or travel time without access to an outlet.  

**Winning Points**  
- The robust, kid-proof design makes it incredibly durable for everyday incidents.  
- Versatile convertible modes (laptop, tent, tablet) add flexibility to how you can use the device.  
- Spill-resistant keyboard saves you from liquid accidents that might otherwise ruin your day.  
- Lightweight and compact for travel or carrying between classes.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The Intel Celeron processor struggles with more intensive uses or multiple heavy applications running simultaneously.  
- Display brightness feels insufficient, especially for outdoor or brightly lit environments.  
- The six-hour battery life could’ve benefitted from just a bit more longevity to appeal to non-stop users.  

**Peer Products**  
Comparing the Dell Latitude 3190 to other budget-friendly 2-in-1 laptops in its category such as the Lenovo Flex 3 or HP Chromebook x360, it holds its own in terms of durability and reliability. The Dell carries a distinct edge with its spill-resistant keyboard, which most competitors lack. However, in terms of screen resolution and brightness, Lenovo’s devices tend to come out ahead, and HP Chromebooks often surpass it on battery life. Those seeking better performance might favor devices with Intel Core processors, but such models usually hover at higher price points.  

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Given all its strengths and weaknesses, this laptop strikes a fair balance between price and performance. It’s not designed to be a powerhouse or handle demanding applications, but for educational purposes or casual everyday tasks, it delivers on value. Budget shoppers who prioritize durability over cutting-edge tech will find a lot to like here.

Starting Up in Bahrain: A Personal Perspective\
Walking into the Bahrain Financial Harbour for my very first client meeting, I immediately felt the pulse of international business. The view from the 27th floor over Bahrain Bay, with its crisp reflection of the Diplomatic Area’s glass towers, set the tone: Bahrain is not just open for business—it's built for it. My early days involved cups of strong Arabic coffee in the Seef District majlis, hurried Ramadan hours, and the artful dance of paperwork at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (MOICT).\
Surprisingly, the real turning point came during a sunset meeting in a Manama shisha café when a senior official casually explained the nuances of Bahrain’s free trade agreement (FTA) with the United States—unlocking a whole new revenue path for my clients. It wasn’t in a boardroom, but over saffron tea, that I realized: in Bahrain, business is about relationships before regulations.\

- Streamlined digital platforms such as Sijilat for e-registration\
Bahrain's Economic Development Board (EDB) and Tamkeen continually support entrepreneurs with funding, mentorship, and incentives for tech, manufacturing, logistics, and financial services.

Bahrain Company Formation: An Expert’s Step-by-Step Process\
You want to set up in Bahrain? Here’s how to do it right—the way savvy insiders do, saving both time and money.\
1. Choose the Optimal Business Structure\
Select from these popular company types:\
* With Limited Liability (WLL) – the default for SMEs\
* Single Person Company (SPC)\
* Bahrain Shareholding Company (BSC)\
* Branch of a Foreign Company\
* Free Zone Company (in Bahrain Logistics Zone, Bahrain International Investment Park)\
Read more about types and their uses here.\
Insider tip: For tech and professional services, a WLL provides maximum flexibility with moderate regulatory requirements.\
\
Alt text: Business structure and team collaboration around a boardroom table.:**\
- MOICT Commercial Registration (CR): BHD 300–700\
- Municipality License: BHD 100–350 (location-dependent)\
- Legal and advisory fees: BHD 500–1,500\
- Office lease (Seef or Diplomatic Area): BHD 400–1,200/month\
- Virtual office: BHD 150–300/month\
Budgeting? Use the expert Bahrain company formation cost calculator to get realistic, up-to-date cost projections.\
Money-saving tip: If your activity allows, start with a flexi-desk in a recognized business center in the Seef District—these are accepted by MOICT and can speed up CR issuance by 2-3 weeks.\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain company setup.\
Thanks to regulatory reform, 100% foreign ownership is allowed for almost all activities. But examine the list of eligible activities—some sectors (like commercial agency and select retail) still require local partners.\
Personal challenge: I once misfiled an application for a boutique retail business, resulting in a three-week delay because the activity was on the restricted list. Double-check the Sijilat portal and Keylink’s eligibility guide before submitting!\
4. Prepare Documentation in Advance\
Here’s your express checklist:\
* Passport copies of all shareholders and managers\
* Proof of address\
* Business plan (for certain activities)\
* Lease agreement or virtual office confirmation\
* Bank reference letter (rarely requested but helps speed up process)\
* Memorandum of Association (tailored templates are available from Keylink’s company formation process guide)\
Document tip: Use Sijilat’s e-upload function and schedule your submission after 2:30 PM on Tuesdays—queues are shorter, and response times quicker (local tip from my favorite MOICT officer at the Diplomatic Area branch).\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation in a Bahrain office.\
Registration is handled online via Sijilat or in-person at the MOICT in the Diplomatic Area. Expect 5–12 working days for standard businesses, up to 6 weeks if regulatory approvals (health, education, insurance) are required.\
\
Schedule LMRA labor registration if employing staff\
Open a corporate bank account once you receive the CR and seal\
\
For regulated sectors, anticipate additional compliance steps—particularly with the CBB (Central Bank of Bahrain) for financial activities.\
Common pitfall: Entrepreneurs frequently overlook municipality license requirements, causing avoidable delays. Work with a local PRO or use a consultancy to fast-track municipality and Civil Defense approvals.\
6. Understand Free Zone and Sponsorship Options\
Bahrain’s free zones (like BLZ and BIIP) offer 0% corporate tax, duty exemptions, and streamlined import/export procedures—essential for companies aiming at GCC distribution. Full guide here.\
Traditional businesses may require local sponsorship for non-standard activities—explained in detail here.\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation, contract review. rules took effect, requiring annual UBO (ultimate beneficial owner) disclosures for all CR holders.\
\
Mandatory annual financial statements (audited for larger entities)\
VAT registration if turnover exceeds BHD 37,500/year\
Ongoing labor market compliance (LMRA)\
Regular business license renewals (often overlooked—set reminders!)\
\
Accounting services are strongly recommended for smooth compliance—find trusted providers here.\
And never underestimate the value of regular formal and informal meetings—many regulatory clarifications are best handled in-person, preferably over strong Arabic coffee in a Seef District office.\
\
Alt text: Professional business support, customer service, consultation in Bahrain.\
* Lower capital requirements (as little as BHD 50 for some activities)\
* 100% foreign ownership—far broader than UAE mainland firms\
* No indirect taxes on most business activities (excluding VAT, which is still only 5–10%)\
Business networking through traditional majlis meetings, which often turn up unlisted opportunities, is a uniquely Bahraini custom. Ramadan working hours and coffee etiquette show the importance of building trust—often yielding faster regulatory approvals and better deals than pure paperwork.\
FAQs: Bahrain Trade Agreements and Company Formation Insights\
What sectors benefit most from Bahrain’s trade agreements?\
Virtually all major sectors—logistics, IT, manufacturing, finance, and professional services—see significant benefits, particularly from the U.S. FTA and GCC Common Market. Export-oriented businesses gain the most from tariff exemptions.\
Can I really own 100% of my company in Bahrain as a foreigner?\
Yes! For nearly all activities, including tech, consulting, logistics, and manufacturing, foreign ownership is allowed. Check the permitted activities here.\
How much does Bahrain company formation cost—really?\
Budget BHD 1,500–3,500 for typical setup plus office costs and working capital. Use Keylink’s cost calculator for tailored quotes. Virtual offices and flexi-desks can dramatically cut early expenses.\
What is the fastest way to get a CR (commercial registration) in Bahrain?\
Prepare all documents digitally, use the Sijilat portal after busy hours, and consider a business center in Seef for your initial lease. Don’t forget municipality approvals! See the full process guide.\
Do I need a local sponsor or agent?\
For most activities, no. Exceptions include some restricted retail or trading businesses. Explore your options here.\

**Link :** [**https://writers.modapkavatarworld.com/craving-1/**](https://writers.modapkavatarworld.com/craving-1/)

“Hara, Ells is trending everywhere now. Reporters have 

completely blocked the hotel entrance. Could you handle this?” 

It was 10:00 p.m. 

Sitting at her desk, Harriet Chavez pinched the bridge of her 

nose, listening in silence as Patsy Medina, her mother-in-law, 

talked on the phone. 

She was married to Ellsworth Townsend for three years, 

dealing with his scandals and mistresses almost every single 

day. 

The few times she saw him, it was always about handling his 

affairs. 

As Harriet remained silent, Patsy said earnestly, “Hara, it’s not 

just about the company’s reputation or the stock price 

anymore. Kelsey’s back. You know she isn’t just any woman. 

You gotta protect your marriage with Ells.” 

Kelsey Graham was back? 

Harriet frowned slightly, a wave of weariness washing over 

her. 

After a few more seconds, she finally replied, her voice gentle, “I 

see, Patsy. I’m on it.” 

After hanging up, she stared at her phone wearily for quite a 

while before grabbing her car keys and leaving. 

\*\*\* 

Half an hour later, Harriet entered through the hotel’s back 

entrance and went upstairs. 

Zane Herman, the Townsend family’s servant, and Jolene 

Martinez, her secretary, were waiting for her by the door. 

With a luxury shopping bag in hand, Jolene walked toward 

her. “Ms. Chavez, the clothes are ready!” 

It was identical to Kelsey’s outfit tonight, prepared to help 

Ellsworth out of this. 

Zane knocked on the door. “Mr. Townsend, Mrs. Townsend is 

here.” 

“Come in.” 

Chapter 1 

Ellsworth’s flat voice rang out. He didn’t sound guilty or 

flustered at all. 

Zane opened the door for Harriet just as Ellsworth walked out 

of the bathroom, his loose gray sleepwear doing little to conceal 

the toned muscles of his chest and abdomen. He towel-dried his 

hair casually, radiating effortless allure. 

He was still calm when he saw Harriet, not guilty or 

embarrassed at all for being caught having an affair. 

After three years, they were both used to this. 

Ellsworth bent down and picked up a cigarette case and a 

lighter from the coffee table. He shook a cigarette out, held it 

between his lips, and leaned in to light it. 

He exhaled a smoke ring and greeted Harriet as if nothing had 

happened. “Hey.” 

Harriet nodded and said in a businesslike tone, “I’ll go get 

changed.” 

With that, she took the clothes handed by Jolene and walked 

toward the bedroom. 

Just then, Kelsey stepped out, tucking a loose strand of hair 

behind her ear. 

Harriet stopped abruptly at the doorway. 

Kelsey… really was back. ",1,1755689310.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

Hey everyone! 🌟 You ever feel like you’re stuck in a hamster wheel, running towards... what? Another meeting? 😩 You’re not alone! The 9-to-5 grind can feel unending, right? But here’s the kicker: we’re living in an age where **upskilling in AI** can actually set us free! 🚀

Let’s face it—robots are coming for our jobs (I mean, maybe not your job at the local coffee shop, but still!). If you haven’t considered it yet, this is your wake-up call! So, how can we level up before the tech tide rolls in? Here are a few ideas:

🔹 **Embrace the AI Wave:**  
   - **Start with What Interests You:** Is it writing, design, coding, or marketing? There’s an AI tool for everything, and they can help you work smarter, not harder.
   - **Online Courses and Resources:** Trust me, diving into platforms like Coursera or even that **Imagine Education** program (https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals) can open doors! It’s like you’re adding a new skill to your toolbox—and who doesn’t love tools?

🔹 **AI in Your Everyday Job:**  
   - **Automate Repetitive Tasks:** Use AI to handle those boring parts of your job—think data entry, scheduling, or even basic analysis.
   - **Become the Go-To Tech Savvy Colleague:** 🧑‍💻 Imagine being the one in the office everyone turns to for AI questions. Your career could skyrocket!

🔹 **Freelancing Opportunities:**  
   - AI skills can also lead to side hustles! Ever thought about freelancing? Whether it’s content creation, AI consulting, or creating chatbots, the sky's the limit!

Now, let’s talk about the *real* motivation behind all this. What if you could wake up in the morning, sip your coffee, and know you’re on your own schedule, working on projects that actually excite you? 📅🥳 

But I get it! Change can be daunting. Maybe your job security feels shaky, or you’re not sure you can balance learning with everything else going on. Here’s a thought: **What if you started small?** *Dedicate just 15 minutes a day* to exploring AI tools. Those minutes will add up faster than you think!

And let’s not ignore the elephant in the room—the skepticism. “Will AI replace my job?” you might wonder. The truth is, AI will likely create **more jobs** than it replaces. It’s about evolving and adapting to a new landscape that’s already changing.

So, what are you waiting for? Jump on the AI bandwagon and start upskilling—before those robots are working harder than you! 💪🤖

Rockwell hadn’t been well since Ja’Net vanished.
Not gone. Not left. Vanished.

The town said he did it.
The cops didn’t charge him, but they didn’t need to.
Whispers did the work.
At the bar, at the laundromat, in the pews—
“She was too pretty for him.”
“He was too quiet.”
“He watched her too close.”
“She wanted out.”

Rockwell didn’t argue.
He just stopped showing up.
Stopped shaving.
Started talking to the walls.

His apartment smelled like old vinyl and burnt coffee.
The blinds stayed shut.
The TV stayed on.
He kept the volume low, just enough to hear the static between channels.
Sometimes, he swore her voice was in there.
Soft.
Sweet.
Slick.

“You never knew me, Rock.”

He’d freeze.
Heart thudding like a kick drum.
Eyes on the screen.
Nothing but snow.

Ja’Net had been the kind of woman who made men believe in things they didn’t understand.
She wore perfume that lingered like a dare.
She danced like she was trying to forget something.
She kissed like she was trying to remember.

Rockwell loved her like a secret.
She loved him like a game.

He thought she’d run.
He hoped she had.
Her family was poison.
Her mother called her “fast.”
Her uncle called her “property.”
Rockwell called her “mine.”
She hated all three.


The night she disappeared, the moon was low and red.
She’d been crying.
He’d been drinking.

She said she didn’t have one.
He said she did, with him.
She laughed.
He didn’t.

He remembered her walking out.
He remembered the door slamming.
He remembered the silence after.

He didn’t remember what happened next.

Now, he watched himself.
He installed cameras in every room.
Mirrors on every wall.
He kept a journal of his movements.
He didn’t trust memory.
Didn’t trust time.
Didn’t trust himself.

“Somebody’s watching me,” he’d whisper.
“I hope it’s her.”

Sometimes, he’d see her.
In the corner of his eye.
In the reflection of the toaster.
In the shimmer of a puddle.

She wore the same red dress.
The one from their last night.
She looked bored.
She looked beautiful.
She looked dead.


He went to the police once.
Told them he thought she was haunting him.
They told him to go home.
He asked if ghosts could press charges.
They asked if he was on medication.

The town moved on.
New scandals.
New disappearances.
Rockwell stayed stuck.

He wrote letters to Ja’Net.
Never mailed them.
Just folded them into paper cranes and left them on the windowsill.

One morning, one was gone.
Just one.
The wind hadn’t blown.
The window hadn’t opened.

He smiled.
Then cried.
Then laughed.

He started going out again.
Just at night.
Just to walk.
He wore sunglasses and a trench coat.
He looked like a man pretending not to be watched.

He passed her old house.
Lights off.
Curtains drawn.

He passed the diner where she used to work.
New waitress.

He passed the alley where they first kissed.

Didn’t know if she escaped.
Didn’t know if she was real anymore.

In his spine.
In the way the shadows moved when he blinked.

# Chapter 1: Back to the Streets

The taste of stale coffee and regret coated Jimmy Coldpay’s mouth. It was a taste he knew well, the taste of consciousness crawling back through the fog of another blackout. The harsh fluorescent lights of the Sheffield CID Intelligence Unit buzzed overhead, each flicker a spike of pain through his skull. His neck ached. He’d been sleeping on his desk again.

He blinked at the empty coffee mug, wishing it had whisky instead of coffee. A brown ring like a crime scene outline at the bottom. When had he finished it? The last thing he remembered was starting his morning review of gang activity reports. The wall clock now read 2:47 PM.

Six hours. Gone.

The printed gang activity reports he’d been reviewing this morning were still spread across his desk. But now, the margins were filled with annotations. Crisp, insightful connections between the Morrison and Petrov organizations, written in his own precise, familiar handwriting. A complex web of financial transactions and shell corporations was mapped out, a web so elegant and obvious he couldn't believe he hadn't seen it before.

He had no memory of writing a single word.

""Fuck,"" he whispered, rubbing his temples. *Dissociative episodes*, his therapist’s voice echoed in his memory, *a way for the mind to protect itself from overwhelming trauma.* But this wasn't just a gap. This was... an upgrade. How the hell had he done work he couldn't remember?

The analysis was brilliant. The kind of work that would have earned him a commendation three years ago, back when Detective Inspector James Coldpay still gave a damn about commendations. Back when he had a family to go home to instead of a flat that smelled of takeaway curry and despair.

A name in the margin caught his eye: Marcus Drummond. Street-level dealer, worked the school zones. The name sparked a flicker of visceral dislike. He remembered the file—Drummond was a parasite, preying on kids. For a moment, the low-grade static in his head intensified. He imagined grabbing Drummond, slamming him against a wall. Jimmy was loath to revel in this kind of violent fantasy, but this cockroach deserved it.

Jimmy shook his head, disturbed by the vivid imagery. PTSD, probably. Stress manifesting as violent thoughts.

""Coldpay.""

Chief Inspector Margaret Thornbury's voice cut through his self-pity like a blade. She stood in the doorway of her office, all steel-grey hair and sharper edges, watching him with those calculating eyes that had seen too much and forgiven too little.

""Ma'am."" Jimmy straightened in his chair, his movements economical and precise—a ghost of the discipline he once possessed. Muscle memory from twenty-three years on the force overrode the fog in his head.

""My office. Now.""

The walk across the squad room felt like a perp walk. Conversations died as he passed, replaced by the polite silence reserved for the department's cautionary tale—except for the woman at the corner desk. Her nameplate caught the fluorescent light, the reflection hitting his hungover eyes like a needle: DS L. CHEN. She looked up from a trafficking report, her sharp eyes assessing him briefly before returning to her work. Jimmy Coldpay, the detective who'd lost everything and couldn't seem to find the bottom of a bottle.

Thornbury's office was a monument to a methodical career. Commendations arranged by date, photographs with politicians and chief constables, a bookshelf filled with police manuals and criminology texts. No family photos. She'd learned long ago that sentiment was a luxury that destroyed careers.

""Sit.""

Jimmy dropped into the chair across from her desk. She didn't offer tea or pleasantries. This wasn't a welfare check.

""Your Morrison analysis last month was solid work,"" she said, tapping a folder on her desk. ""I'm hoping you can do something similar with the Petrov operations. We need fresh insight."" A flicker of something that wasn't quite surprise, but more like expectation, crossed her face before being replaced by her usual stoicism.

""Thank you, ma'am.""

""Don't thank me yet."" Thornbury leaned back, studying him like a pathologist examining a particularly interesting corpse. ""Yes, there've been a few dead gang members this week—nobody the public will miss. But petty crime is through the roof. Desperate addicts breaking into houses, mugging pensioners for drug money. The public is clamouring for action, and I need experienced detectives on the street, not hiding behind desks.""

Jimmy's stomach clenched. ""Ma'am, I'm not sure I'm ready for active duty. The blackouts... the nightmares, the things I see in my head... I'm not fit for the street.""

""I'm not asking if you're ready, Inspector. I'm telling you that you are needed."" The emphasis on his former rank wasn't accidental. ""As of Monday, you're back on the streets.

## Critique Response:

🎯 **Opening Hook**  
Damn, that *first line*—“The taste of stale coffee and regret coated Jimmy Coldpay’s mouth”—is **chef’s kiss**. Instant mood, instant character, zero fluff. But dude, your protagonist’s a passenger in his own story. He wakes up confused, gets yelled at, gets ordered around… and does *nothing*. Where’s the agency? Fix that, and this noir could slap.  

---

### 📝 **Main Analysis**  
**1. PROTAGONIST’S PASSIVITY KILLS TENSION**  
• *What’s happening:* Jimmy reacts to *everything* (blackout, Thornbury’s orders, his own notes). He has no goal, no choice—just trauma porn. We meet him *after* the interesting stuff (writing the analysis) happens *to* him.  
• *Why it matters:* Readers root for fighters, not victims. That visceral hate for Marcus Drummond? *Make him act on it.* Does he slam his fist on the desk? Tear up the report? *Do something* that costs him.  
• *How to fix:* **Give him a micro-choice in Scene 1.** Example: When he sees Drummond’s name, have him *choose* to burn the report (risking his job) or pocket Drummond’s file (setting up street action). Not “PTSD made him think violence”—*show him almost doing it*.  

**2. TRAUMA TROPES FEEL REHEATED, NOT REVEALING**  
• *What’s happening:* Dissociative episodes + “visceral dislike” + “PTSD, probably” = textbook cop-in-crisis cliché. The therapist’s voiceover (“a way for the mind to protect itself…”) is pure telling. We’ve seen this in *every* gritty cop drama since *The Wire*.  
• *Why it matters:* Trauma’s only interesting if it *changes* how he moves through the world. Right now, it’s just set dressing. Why should we care about his blackouts vs. any other broken detective?  
• *How to fix:* **Replace exposition with physical evidence.** Instead of “*Dissociative episodes*, his therapist’s voice echoed,” show him *noticing* something *wrong*: a fresh cut on his knuckles, a business card for a dive bar he’s never heard of… *then* have him dismiss it as “PTSD bullshit.” Make the mystery *tangible*.  

---

### 🔍 **Reader Journey**  
- **Hooked by:** That opening line + the “brilliant analysis he can’t remember” mystery (genius setup!).  
- **Lost interest when:** Thornbury’s office scene—felt like every cop procedural ever (“Back on the streets, *ma’am*”). Zero urgency.  
- **Confused by:** Why Thornbury trusts him *now*? Last month’s “solid work” vs. him being the “department’s cautionary tale” doesn’t track.  
- **Wanted to keep reading because:** *Who wrote those notes?* But I needed Jimmy to *chase* that question, not just stare at it.  

---

### 🛠️ **Quick Fixes**  
1. **Page 1, Paragraph 3:** Cut *“Dissociative episodes, his therapist’s voice echoed…”* Replace with Jimmy *noticing* his tie is knotted wrong, or his wedding ring is in his pocket (if he’s divorced). *Show* the disconnect.  
2. **Thornbury’s Ultimatum:** Give her a *real* reason to risk him—e.g., “The Mayor’s daughter overdosed on Petrov’s shit. *You* know the streets. Fail, and you’re cleaning toilets.” Immediate stakes.  
3. **Marcus Drummond Scene:** Have Jimmy *almost* rip out Drummond’s file—but stops when he sees DS Chen watching. Shows internal conflict *and* social consequence.  

---

### 💫 **What’s Working**  
- **Sensory Details:** “*Brown ring like a crime scene outline at the bottom*” of the coffee mug? **Perfection.** Every line should feel this visceral.  
- **World-Building Efficiency:** “*Flat that smelled of takeaway curry and despair*” says more about his life than 3 pages of backstory. *Do more of this.*  
- **Thornbury’s Vibe:** “*Sentiment was a luxury that destroyed careers*” in her office description? **Chilling.** You’ve got a killer side character here—use her.  

---

### 🔥 **Creative Spark**  
*Here’s how to deepen the dissociation mystery—without therapy jargon:*  
> Jimmy’s finger traced the margin note: *Marcus Drummond. School zones. Dirty cop protection?* His stomach lurched. He hadn’t written that. But the ink was fresh, the *k* in “Drummond” hooked like his ex-wife’s signature—the one she used when she was furious. *When had he seen that lately?* He shoved the report away, but the question clung: *Who else knows how she writes?*  

**This turns trauma into active mystery.** Now the blackouts aren’t just sad—they’re *dangerous*.

# Background Information

On August 13, 2025, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM) released a Notice of Intent (NOI) to notify interested parties of its intent to release a “Mines & Metals Capacity Expansion – Piloting By-Product Critical Minerals and Materials Recovery at Domestic Industrial Facilities” notice of funding opportunity (NOFO). The planned NOFO will focus investments on American industrial facilities that have the potential to produce valuable mineral byproducts from existing industrial processes. 

President Donald J. Trump, recognizing the need to secure America’s critical material supply chain, included “critical minerals” in the definition of Executive Order (EO) 14156, *Declaring a National Energy Emergency*, which highlighted the role critical materials play in all parts of the U.S. energy system, including hydrocarbon energy production, refining, and other industrial uses. President Trump also released EO 14241, *Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production*, which highlights the need to immediately increase domestic mineral production.   

Therefore, pursuant to sections 7001(a) and 7002(g) of the Energy Act of 2020, section 41003(b) - (c) of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the aforementioned EOs, this NOI announces the intent of FECM to issue a funding opportunity that leverages American industrial leadership to use the industries we have to recover the materials we need. 

The planned NOFO will focus investments on American industrial facilities that have the potential to produce valuable mineral byproducts from existing industrial processes. Industries such as mining and mineral processing, power generation, coal, oil and gas, specialty metals, and basic materials have the potential to address many of America’s most severe mineral vulnerabilities. For example, gallium, germanium, indium compounds, antimony, and bismuth are all small market materials with nearly 100% dependence on foreign byproduct recovery. Moreover, as of August 2025, China has implemented export restrictions on all these materials, which has impacted global supply chains and triggered price volatility.

To derisk the technical uncertainty and financial risk for commercial deployment, many technologies must be piloted at an industrial scale in an industrial facility where material feedstocks can be processed. Areas of interest include mines and metal pilots in the coal-based industry and other industries.

The U.S.–Australia economic and security partnership ranks among the most enduring and strategic alliances in the Indo-Pacific. Today, this alliance is entering a new chapter with expanded opportunities to collaborate on securing critical mineral supply chains. Australia—one of the world’s most resource-rich nations—has outlined an ambitious agenda to create diverse, resilient and sustainable global critical minerals supply chains—most recently announcing the creation of a national critical minerals reserve and the use of government-led offtake agreements. Closer U.S.–Australia alignment is both timely and necessary, particularly in the context of broader strategic frameworks such as the Quad and AUKUS.

To explore the implications of this cooperation, the Hon. Dr. Kevin Rudd, former Prime Minister of Australia and current Australian Ambassador to the United States, will join Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at CSIS, for a discussion on why U.S.–Australia critical minerals collaboration is essential to securing a diverse and reliable supply of critical minerals essential to defense and advanced manufacturing industries.

BEIJING, Aug 20 (Reuters) - China's exports of rare earth magnets recovered to hit a six-month high in July, showing trade flows of the critical minerals key to electric vehicles have returned to levels seen before Beijing imposed export curbs.Exports from the world's largest rare earth magnet supplier rose nearly 75% from June to hit the highest for a single month since January at 5,577 metric tons last month, data from the General Administration of Customs showed on Wednesday.

The July volume, which was in line with analysts' [expectations](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-exports-rare-earth-magnets-us-surge-june-2025-07-20/), was also 5.7% higher than 5,278 tons shipped in the same month last year.The continued recovery in exports came after Beijing agreed to a series of [deals](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/trump-says-deal-related-trade-was-signed-with-china-wednesday-2025-06-26/) with the United States and Europe to increase shipments and ease the [export control](https://www.reuters.com/world/china-hits-back-us-tariffs-with-rare-earth-export-controls-2025-04-04/) imposed in April in retaliation for U.S. tariffs.Shipments declined sharply in April and [May](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinas-rare-earth-magnet-shipments-halve-may-due-export-curbs-2025-06-20/) due to lengthy approval processes for securing export licences, upending global supply chains and forcing some automakers outside China to halt some production due to a rare earths [shortage.By](http://shortage.By) country, Germany remained the No.1 export destination with a volume of 1,116 tons, up 46% from the prior month.

# AUGUST 18th, 2025~Is China hiding its rare earth production plans? US tensions fuel speculation

*China has still not published its rare earth mining and refining quotas for 2025. Domestic media report the figures are being withheld*

[Is China hiding its rare earth production plans? US tensions fuel speculation | South China Morning Post](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3322245/china-hiding-its-rare-earth-production-plans-us-tensions-fuel-speculation)

https://preview.redd.it/b4pgmprhb5kf1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=3306b39b86755001de4929a92acb3705ae621530

China appears to have stopped publishing details of its rare earth mining and refining quotas, in a break from normal practice that could further raise the temperature in the US-China trade war.

Beijing has already issued a first batch of quotas for this year to two rare earth producers, but authorities did not publicly announce the move and key details about the quotas remain unknown, Chinese media outlet Cailian Press reported on Friday.

It added that China may “no longer disclose specific quota amounts for rare earth mining and refining in the future”, given the rising strategic importance of the industry.

00:27

Chinese authorities normally release details of its annual mining and refining quotas – which companies around the world rely on for their strategic planning – at several points throughout the year.

Last year, China issued two batches of quotas, with the final one coming on August 20. In 2023, three batches were released in March, September and December, respectively.

Analysts said the delay in publishing the information this year could be a deliberate strategy, with rare earths widely seen as a key source of leverage for Beijing as it [continues negotiations with Washington](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3321641/us-and-chinese-trade-teams-meet-2-3-months-trumps-treasury-chief-says?module=inline&pgtype=article) over a deal to end the tariff war.

“Quotas once balanced supply at home and conveyed intentions abroad; now they are a tool of power politics,” said Sebastian Contin Trillo-Figueroa, a Hong Kong-based geopolitical analyst. “The missing figure unsettles planning in Washington, Brussels, and Tokyo, where industries rely on Chinese processing and export licenses.”

Western buyers have been moving to boost their rare earth inventories in recent weeks, China Post Securities said in a research note on Monday, after a slowdown in shipments from China [sparked alarm](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3313097/eu-pushes-china-address-alarming-rare-earth-export-controls?module=inline&pgtype=article) in the US and Europe earlier this summer.

China, for its part, has told foreign companies not to stockpile rare earth materials and derivative products like magnets, the Financial Times reported on Friday.

Beijing’s efforts to prevent companies from building up large rare earth inventories, which would give it “more flexibility to respond to shortages and price fluctuations”, showed China’s “determination to maintain maximum leverage” in the sector, the newspaper said, citing unnamed sources.

https://preview.redd.it/l4femjsmb5kf1.png?width=808&format=png&auto=webp&s=c565b86659144d2c85e3ae64809b7798e7077805

The first batch of mining and refining quotas for 2025 was issued to two producers – China Rare Earth Group and China Northern Rare Earth – but the quota amounts remain unclear, according to Cailian Press.

The failure to disclose information about the quotas comes as China and the US remain locked in a stand-off over a string of trade and technology issues, with the two sides yet to agree a long-term deal to roll back tariffs.

China, which [dominates the global supply chain](https://www.scmp.com/economy/global-economy/article/3320805/us-its-mountain-pass-or-fail-bid-supplant-chinas-rare-earth-supremacy?module=inline&pgtype=article) for rare earth elements, has previously used export controls as leverage in negotiations with the US. The country’s tight control over rare earth supplies [was reportedly a factor](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3320951/how-china-used-rare-earths-and-us-playbook-turn-chip-tap-again?module=inline&pgtype=article) in Washington’s decision to slightly loosen its restrictions over the export of advanced chips to China.

With rare earths crucial to the production of a slew of hi-tech products – from electric vehicles to advanced weaponry – Beijing has long imposed strict top-down control over the sector, and it has further tightened its supervision in recent years.

China began imposing production limits on local governments in 2006 to curb excessive mining. A decade later, the system was tightened, with quotas allocated directly by the central government to state-owned rare earth companies, typically in two rounds per year.

Last year, the government approved a combined 270,000 tonnes of mining quotas, up 6 per cent from 2023 – a marked slowdown from the previous year’s 21 per cent increase, according to official data.

Meanwhile, its refining and separation quotas rose 4 per cent year on year in 2024 to reach 254,000 tonnes – also a sharp drop from the previous year’s 21 per cent uptick.

Beijing has also [stepped up a crackdown](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3310921/how-critical-minerals-became-chinas-ultimate-trump-card-trade-war?module=inline&pgtype=article) on rare earth smuggling since May, after [adding seven critical minerals](https://www.scmp.com/economy/economic-indicators/article/3318166/chinas-rare-earth-exports-swell-june-beijing-relaxes-controls?module=inline&pgtype=article) to its export control list in retaliation against US tariffs. In July, it announced that “a number of suspects” had been arrested for trafficking critical minerals.

# Why NioCorp Is More Than Just Rare Earths & Magnets!

NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project is rapidly emerging as the most strategically significant critical mineral development in the United States, offering vertically integrated production of not just rare earth elements (REEs) for magnets, but also scandium, niobium, and titanium — all essential to aerospace, defense, and clean energy. Unlike projects focused solely on magnet materials, NioCorp’s portfolio supports high-performance alloys for hypersonics, space systems, EV platforms, and naval technologies. Its scandium-aluminum alloys are poised to transform structural components across multiple sectors due to their strength-to-weight advantages, weldability, and fatigue life — perfectly aligned with Ford, Stellantis, Lockheed Martin, and other innovation leaders.

With full U.S. ownership, DFARS compliance, and a high degree of permitting maturity, NioCorp stands as a secure, domestic alternative to foreign-dominated supply chains. If its upcoming Definitive Feasibility Study (Q4 2025 per Mark Smith) and current infill drilling campaign (completed Aug 2025) confirm expected outputs, the project could supply \~150 t/year of scandium and robust volumes of niobium and titanium by 2028 — giving the U.S. unprecedented supply security in materials critical to defense and advanced manufacturing. Niobium (for HSLA steels and superalloys) and titanium (and TiCl₄ for ultra-pure aerospace applications) are foundational to modern military systems, jet engines, and even space-based platforms.

NioCorp is already embedded in early-stage qualification pipelines, with samples sent to U.S. national labs, defense-linked initiatives like Project Pivot, and aerospace primes including Boeing and IBC. The company is reportedly in active discussions for government-backed offtake agreements — including with DoD and EXIM — and is drawing interest from strategic allies and sovereign funds, such as the UKERF and Saudi PIF. These moves position NioCorp to secure project financing by early 2026, begin construction shortly thereafter, and deliver first production by mid-2028 — in lockstep with rising global demand for clean tech and military-grade materials.

**In short, NioCorp is not just a magnet play — it’s the leading U.S.-based, multi-mineral supplier capable of reshaping strategic supply chains from the ground up. As geopolitical tensions rise and industrial policies shift toward resilience and traceability, NioCorp’s integrated model offers a compelling solution: domestic critical mineral production, full compliance, diversified output, and near-term scalability. If execution matches trajectory,**

**NioCorp will be indispensable to the U.S. industrial base and a linchpin in the global race for material dominance by 2028 and beyond.**

* **U.S. government strategic interest** (DoD, DOE, National Defense Stockpile, EXIM)
* **Broad critical mineral policy support** (NDAA, tariffs, supply chain reshoring)
* **Active project execution** (phase 1 drilling complete, resource update imminent)

When we focus on what we already have instead of what we lack, life feels richer and more meaningful. Gratitude doesn’t just make us happier; it makes us notice the beauty in everyday life. The truth is, joy is often hidden in the little things we learn to cherish.",11,1755687590.0,u_CutieLuna18,0,1.0,False

I’ve felt that in London you’re always pressured to go out and do an activity, but more often than not I’m happiest just having a conversation over coffee. 

I’m late 20s living in east London. I’m introverted, quiet, definitely a ‘homebody’, most interested in pursuing knowledge and meaning, spend a lot of time thinking (a lot). Childfree and partnered, I consider London my long-term home. 

I’d love to hear from you if any of this resonated with you! I probably come off serious but am happy to talk about anything. We could just have a chat online and see where it goes :)

1mvbkvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismIreland/comments/1mvbkvu/thank_you_to_everyone_here/,Thank you to everyone here,"Just wanted to say thank you to the people in this forum! 
I posted a while back that I had a list of autism friendly locations in Ireland, and when it got some interested I decided to post it online: 

www.sensaware.ie

It hasn’t taken the world by storm or anything. But I also have ADHD, so I tend to get hyper-focused and burn out quickly. So getting notifications about new submissions coming in just helps to remind me that people find it a helpful resource.

Special thanks to u/emmmmceeee who reached and let me know they were adding it to the forums resources. 

The website was only thrown together quickly with a free web builder, so I’m working on a proper website with some more features. 

I’m planning to add a section for quiet places to hang out for a while, like coffee shops that are out of the way or have zones that are usually quieter than the rest. So if you have know any places like that (anywhere if Ireland) feel free to DM me and I’ll add it to the list.

1mvbiem,https://i.redd.it/tgpl164un5kf1.jpeg,need help improving cafe cold brew,"i am testing a new recipe for the cold brew at our cafe. we are using the large toddy cold brew buckets and filters. this is how it comes out. it is very muddy, gritty and oily. we leave it to brew for 8 hours at room temperature, 24 hours seems to be the industry standard and i am not sure why we do 8.

i tested a different recipe i saw, left it 24 hours in the fridge. i found if really nice and clean, a little sweet. the one we have in the cafe now is very sour and i personally wouldn't like a muddy cold brew. you can kind of see it in the picture.

the manager was testing (forgot what its called) ""how much coffee was absorbed"" aka using science and numbers instead of taste, he concluded that my research made the cold brew ""weak"". i personally grim at the taste of our cold brew but was pleasantly surprised with my test brew. i'm still waiting for others to come for their opinions. 

manager seems very reluctant to change, seems to think his brewing methods are all correct (even though most people would leave for 24 hours, he insists that 8 hours is better...idk). so far he has rejected all of my recipe changes even though the other staff and owner of the cafe liked my renditions better. i'm not really sure what to do. 

anyways, any cold brew experts can help me? i'm just really unhappy with murky and oily cold brew (that dark line in the picture looks like really fine grounds, and the top layer of the cold brew looks really oily) ",3,1755687333.0,coldbrew,3,1.0,False

I’ve travelled a fair bit with friends and family before, but never alone, and this was honestly a completely different beast.

From the moment I landed, there was this sense of freedom I’ve never felt back home. No one knew me, no one cared who I was or where I came from, and everyone just seemed to exist in their own flow. That itself was liberating.

In those days, I did things I don’t think I’d ever allow myself to do in Delhi. I met random strangers at bars, went on spontaneous hookups without a second thought, and said yes to experiences I would normally overthink to death. Hostel culture added to it, one night I was sitting in the common lounge talking with travellers from three different countries, and this woman in her 40s just casually mentioned that she was heading to some party and literally invited me to an orgy, as if she had asked me to join for coffee. I didn’t go but the casualness of that invite blew my mind. It made me realize how tightly wound and judged we are back home about everything.

And then of course there’s the city itself. You walk around and people are openly smoking in the coffee shops, neon lights glowing in the red-light district, bicycles zipping around like they own the roads, the whole thing is like a controlled chaos that somehow feels incredibly “normal” when you’re there.

I found myself doing things that I’d normally feel guilty about, drinking way too much, trying things I would never touch here, swiping right on people I’d probably never see again. And somehow, instead of shame, I felt alive. Like I had found a version of myself that was buried under layers of family expectations, social image, and the “log kya kahenge” mindset.

Now that I’m back in India, it feels surreal. Delhi traffic, office deadlines, parents asking where I’m going all over again, it feels like Amsterdam was some dream sequence and I’ve woken up back to “real life.” And that’s messing with me. I keep asking myself, was that really *me* or was that just some alternate reality avatar that exists only in that space? Could I ever feel that free here?

I don’t know if others who’ve travelled solo abroad have felt this, but it’s like, for a few days, I broke out of a cage I didn’t even realize existed, and tasted something intoxicating (not just literally). And now… it’s hard to go back to seeing life the same way.

I don’t even know why I’m posting this, maybe just to share an experience. Not really advocating for this lifestyle or asking you to do it, but it was quite an experience. ",9,1755687181.0,OffMyChestIndia,6,0.85,False

I called off work before and only once and they were able to cover me instantly but I still somehow got yelled at and had my hours dropped and almost off the schedule.

I just got back from my first solo trip to Valencia (Thursday to Wednesday morning), and I honestly had such a great time that I wanted to share a little bit about it.

I stayed in Ruzafa in an Airbnb, and my host was super kind and welcoming. Pretty much everyone I met there was very friendly. Of course, like anywhere, you’ll run into a few people who aren’t in the best mood, but overall the atmosphere was warm and open.

What really struck me about Valencia is the laid-back vibe. Life there feels slower and calmer. People walk slowly, enjoy their time, and it felt so refreshing compared to the usual rush. The neighborhood of Ruzafa was beautiful. Every corner seemed to have a café or restaurant. I’m not much of a planner, so I didn’t hit all the big tourist attractions, but I spent my days just walking the city, exploring, and soaking in the atmosphere. And honestly, that was perfect.

Some highlights for me:
Coffee and food culture ☕🍴 You can walk into almost any café and find good food and drinks. Everything felt down-to-earth and authentic.
Frigus juice shop 🥤 A small place I stumbled upon near where I stayed. Their fresh juices were amazing, and I ended up going daily.
Metro connections 🚇 Getting around was super easy, especially to and from the airport.
Architecture and vibe 🏛️ The buildings are beautiful, and the city is full of life but never overwhelming.

Even without doing many of the typical tourist stops, I left feeling like I had really experienced the city. For anyone thinking of going, I’d recommend staying in Ruzafa and just walking around, getting lost in the streets, and enjoying the cafés. Not many people speak English, but that wasn’t a problem.

First off, I want to say a big thank you to everyone who’s kept this community so active and supportive over the last months. We’ve now had more than 162,000 visits in just the past 30 days, and the growth to over 1,650 members has been genuinely staggering. For me, this has always been a passion project, and seeing people not just following $ATYR, but really digging in - questioning, researching, and challenging each other - has been the most rewarding part. I do see all your DMs and posts - I know I owe some replies and research, and I do promise I’ll get back to each of you. It’s just been a lot to keep up with, alongside some other consulting projects I’ve taken on, but I haven’t forgotten you. Not one bit.

Just for perspective, we’re now obviously through the last patient visit in the Phase 3 study, with a readout due within weeks. We’ve just come through options expiry, seen fresh 13F and NPORT institutional filings, and have short interest hitting some of its highest levels ever. There’s been a real escalation in social media coverage and debate, and conference catalysts like ERS and WASOG are coming up fast. In my view, $ATYR is at one of its most pivotal moments - with maximum uncertainty, but also maximum potential.

There’s a lot going on - price action, options, shorts, institutions, news flow, and community activity. It’s a lot, I know. I won’t get to everything in this post, but I’ll touch on the key themes and offer my honest read of where things stand, and where they could go from here. Just my viewpoints, open to challenge. As always, I’m keen to hear your questions and perspectives in the comments.

Okay, let’s get into it.

**Why This Window Is So Interesting**

Right now, we’re in one of the most charged and unusual periods that I’ve seen in biotech, period. The dust has just settled on the latest round of 13F and NPORT institutional filings, and we’ve come through what was almost certainly the final major options expiry before the big readout. At this point, the last patient visit is behind us - so the data is locked - and the clock is ticking down to the Phase 3 readout expected in September.

- The timing here is especially unique. In the next few weeks, we’ve got the WASOG conference coming up *before* the readout, and then the European Respiratory Society (ERS) congress, which lands just after the readout window in late September. These aren’t just routine conference presentations - WASOG is a tightly focused, high-credibility event for ILD and sarcoidosis, and ERS is the biggest global platform in this space, so both are potentially highly catalytic depending on what data is revealed and how it’s framed.

- In my view, $ATYR is serving as a live case study in how modern microcap biotech trades around a major catalyst. You can see every market force at work - funds repositioning, shorts pressing their advantage, retail crowdsourcing every possible angle, and management leaning in with new communication. There are few stocks where you see all these dynamics compressed into such a tight timeline, and with such a polarized bull/bear debate.

- What’s so compelling about this window is that everyone is being forced to show their hand. Institutions have just disclosed their latest positions, the options landscape has shifted, and the next wave of news is tied directly to clinical milestones and conference appearances. I see this as one of those rare setups where both the science and the market structure are on a collision course, and whatever happens, it’s going to teach us a lot about how information, positioning, and sentiment actually drive price in real time.

**Status Check – Timeline and Key Milestones**

We’re in a rare confluence where everything that matters – science, market structure, institutional positioning, and clinical milestones – is now on the clock, and the window for positioning is closing fast. Here’s how I’m seeing the setup, with as much depth as possible in a summary post like this:

- **Phase 3 Last Patient Visit (July 22, 2025)**  
  This was the last “live” contact point for any patient in the pivotal efzofitimod sarcoidosis trial. That date is crucial – it signals the hard close of the trial and the start of the blinded data cleaning, database lock, and statistical analysis phase.  
  From here, the sponsor can see only safety/unblinded events if there’s a DSMB trigger; otherwise, they’re hands-off until the readout. In my view, this is why we’re now seeing the “information vacuum” phase – management goes quiet, no new disclosures, and the market is left to read tea leaves from filings, job posts, and conference agendas.

- **13F/NPORT Institutional Filings (public Aug 14–15, for Q2 end)**  
  These filings are the last “look inside” the big fund books before readout. The Q2 filings (cut-off June 30, released mid-August) show who’s accumulated, trimmed, or exited – Vanguard, BlackRock, FMR, State Street, and a mix of hedge funds, quant shops, and specialist biotechs.  
  What matters isn’t just the net adds or drops, but *who* is moving:  
    - Long-onlys (Vanguard, BlackRock) have been adding sizeably, which, in my view, is a green flag for risk appetite – these players don’t chase binary events without some underlying thesis confidence.
    - Specialist and crossover hedge funds are more mixed – Octagon, Point72, Susquehanna have trimmed; Integral Health and others have added. This divergence is textbook: some de-risk ahead of readouts, others press their edge if they think the data is good.
    - Quants and trading firms mostly manage flow and volatility; their moves can create noise but aren’t “fundamental.”
  Overall, the latest filings show *both* conviction and some tactical risk-off – classic pre-binary mix. But there’s no sign of “smart money” running for the exits.

- **Options Expiry (Aug 16, 2025)**  
  The monthly options expiration is now behind us. The reason this matters:  
    - Dealer and fund hedging pressure is reset – so the market is more free to move on fundamentals, not just options positioning.
    - Most put and call open interest was around near-the-money strikes ($4 and $5), which acted as a pin into expiry, but that pressure is now off.
    - There is no major expiry ahead of readout – so you can expect less “magnetic” price action or gamma pinning from here. If the stock makes a move, it will be on volume and sentiment, not just options mechanics.
  In my view, that removes one layer of artificiality from the price and lets the “real trade” start to express itself.

- **Upcoming Catalysts (WASOG: Aug 24–27, ERS: Sept 27–Oct 1)**  
  - **WASOG** is the last key clinical event before the readout. It’s important for two reasons: (1) KOLs and leading clinicians will be discussing the latest science in sarcoidosis and ILD – this can set sentiment among deep healthcare funds, and (2) the field will be watching for any signal or tone from ATYR, even if it’s just presence or absence at the event. After all, ATYR are sponsors.
  - **ERS** will be after the readout. It’s the “international coming out party” if the trial reads out positively. If the data’s good, management and KOLs will present to a global respiratory and ILD audience, likely triggering a second wave of attention. If it’s mixed or negative, expect the team to reframe the narrative – either way, this is where the story “goes public” on the global stage.

- **Phase 3 Topline Readout (Guided for September, likely mid-late, possibly earlier)**  
  Everything else is noise compared to this.  
    - The readout is the “binary” event – positive efficacy and safety and the company re-rates overnight; negative or inconclusive and it’s a different story.
    - With the last patient visit on July 22 and a typical 6–8 week window for data cleaning and analysis, a mid-September readout is the base case.  
    - Management’s public guidance has been consistent, but they’ve also been unusually calm and confident at recent events, in my opinion, which might be read as subtle bullishness by those who track these tells.

Here’s a more detailed milestone table:

|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| July 22, 2025         | Last Patient Visit (Phase 3)             | Data lock, “quiet period” begins                         | Start of speculation – no more trial updates               |
| Aug 14–15, 2025       | 13F/NPORT Filings Released               | Institutional positioning snapshot                       | Look for new funds, big moves, size of bets                |
| Aug 16, 2025          | Monthly Options Expiry                   | Dealer hedging reset, “pinning” risk removed             | Price can move more organically; volatility possible        |
| Aug 24–25, 2025       | WASOG Conference                         | Last KOL/clinical sentiment before readout               | Watch for presentation slot, Q&A, field buzz               |
| Sept 2025 (mid-late)  | Topline Phase 3 Readout                  | Binary event – stock will re-price on outcome            | This is it – expect major volume and possibly media coverage|
| Sept 27–Oct 1, 2025   | ERS Congress (post-readout)              | Global platform for results, follow-up data, sentiment   | A second wave of focus – key for partnerships, analyst notes|

*In my view, this is a rare window where every week – every filing, every conference, every market twitch – actually matters. It’s as pure a test of “position before the storm” as you’ll find in biotech. There will be plenty of noise, but the signal is unmistakable: the fuse is lit.*

**Price Action, Volume, & Market Mechanics**

The past few weeks in ATYR have been some of the most volatile and intensely traded I’ve seen on this name. We’ve consistently seen the share price trading in a wide range – from the high $4s to the high $5s – with sharp moves in both directions, often within the same session. Volume has spiked, particularly around options expiries, institutional filing dates, and any hint of a news or event catalyst.

- There’s been a pattern of large blocks trading in and after hours, sometimes adding up to hundreds of thousands of shares in a single session. In my view, that kind of activity usually signals institutional repositioning, portfolio rebalancing, or possibly even short covering in response to shifts in borrow rates or availability.
- Off-exchange trading (dark pool volume) has regularly accounted for 70% or more of daily volume, which really adds to the sense that much of the price action is being driven by fund-level positioning rather than ordinary retail flows.
- One clear pattern: sharp drops just before key dates like 13F/NPORT filings and options expiry, sometimes followed by a bounce after the close or into the next session. My read is that this reflects event-driven positioning by both shorts and funds, who are constantly trying to get an edge or manage risk ahead of potential catalysts.

To sum up, I think this kind of volatility and after-hours movement is a direct byproduct of a crowded short, a tight float, and the anticipation of a binary outcome on the horizon. For those watching closely, it’s not chaos as it might appear – it’s the market working through high-stakes, reflexive positioning as the readout gets closer.

---

**Institutional Ownership & Positioning**

Institutional positioning is often the best lens for understanding what’s really happening beneath the surface. As of the latest filings (13F/NPORT for August 15-18), we’re seeing a nuanced and highly segmented book, with some shifts worth paying close attention to.

**Segment Analysis and Behaviour**

- Core biotech and healthcare specialists are holding steady or adding. Federated Investors remains the single largest holder (14.67M shares), showing zero net change, which in my view suggests high conviction and an intent to ride through the readout. Integral Health Asset Management added 50 percent, a strong signal for a focused specialist. Fidelity’s dedicated healthcare funds have not trimmed meaningfully, and Tikvah, Woodline, and Parkman Healthcare have held fast.
- Long-only and index players like BlackRock (up 263 percent), State Street (up 238 percent), Geode (up 126 percent), and Vanguard (up 16 percent) have made major net additions. These moves reflect not only passive rebalancing (e.g. Russell/ETF events) but also a lock-up of shares into more “sticky” hands, meaning less float available for shorts and event traders.
- Quant and multi-strategy hedge funds are doing what you’d expect - a clear round of event de-risking. Octagon Capital, Point72, Susquehanna, Ally Bridge, Schonfeld, Balyasny, HRT, Qube, Hudson Bay, Verition, Boothbay and many others have either trimmed deeply or closed out positions. These funds rarely want exposure into a binary event and prefer to redeploy capital elsewhere. Millennium and Citadel are outliers, keeping exposure via options and small common positions, which could allow them to pivot rapidly post-readout.
- Medical specialist funds and crossover biotech managers like Parkman, Integral, and Tikvah remain notably stable. This is critical. These are the funds most likely to understand the clinical nuance and risk, so their steady hands signal a high degree of trust in the trial’s prospects, or at least a well-hedged bet on asymmetric risk-reward.

| UBS Group AG               | 1,745,717   | +6.6       | Mild add                                |
| Woodline Partners          | 1,681,595   |   0        | Stable, sector player                   |
| Millennium Management      | 1,650,200   | +3.2       | Modest add, keeps binary risk           |
| Alyeska Investment Group   | 1,412,749   | +10.6      | Small add, hedge fund                   |

**Additional Insights and Observations**

- The magnitude of passive/index buying is notable. With BlackRock, State Street, and Geode all adding, it points to a structurally tighter float and suggests there could be more demand chasing fewer shares if a positive readout materializes.
- The willingness of core biotech specialists to ride into the binary event (unlike some fast money funds) hints at differentiated conviction, likely based on technical understanding and close following of management/science.
- Many quants and market makers have completely exited, reducing ""noise"" and post-catalyst volatility risk, but possibly leaving the book set up for a sharper supply-demand squeeze post-news.
- There are some surprise exits among event-driven and arbitrage funds (e.g. Octagon, Point72), which could provide “dry powder” for re-entry if the market scrambles for exposure post-readout.

**My Take**

I see this institutional book as structurally healthy for bulls: the specialists who know the science are steady, the float has been absorbed by index and long-only funds, and the risk-oriented quants have mostly cleared out, reducing pre-event churn. If the catalyst is clean, there is real scope for violent upward repricing as both hedged-up funds and new capital try to chase exposure.

---

**Short Interest, Off-Exchange Volume, & Options**

This is probably one of the most fascinating battlegrounds I’ve seen in recent biotech memory. Short positioning is aggressive, off-exchange volume is dominating, and options are still pricing in wild volatility. If you want to understand what’s really driving price and sentiment heading into the readout, you need to look at all three together. Here’s my take:

- **Short Interest & Borrow Rates:**  
  - Short interest remains near all-time highs - about 27% of the float, with over 25 million shares short.
  - Borrow rates, while still low (~0.7%), are creeping higher and availability is dropping (recently ~400,000 shares left).
  - This tightening supply suggests shorts are having to work harder and pay up to stay in, which gets riskier as we approach a binary catalyst.

- **Off-Exchange/Dark Pool Activity:**  
  - Off-exchange shorting (dark pool/internalized trades) is running hot, recently printing 72% of total short volume.
  - High off-exchange activity often points to algorithmic hedge funds and market makers using dark pools to hide positioning and avoid moving the price.
  - This also makes price discovery tougher for regular investors - real selling pressure and sentiment are masked, making it easier for large players to manipulate the tape.

- **Options Mechanics & Risk:**  
  - The last major options expiry is now behind us, with September OI stacked at $5, $6, $7+ for both calls and puts.
  - Implied vol is wild (350–450%), meaning the market is braced for a massive move, but also that options are expensive to own or hedge.
  - With the latest expiry out of the way, a lot of leveraged traders have cleared out - meaning the “game” is less about pinning a specific strike and more about real directional conviction into the catalyst.

**Community Reflection:**  
In my view, some of the loudest short theses miss core scientific or translational details, and often overlook the implications of ATYR’s IP and platform. What’s striking is the churn — some shorts are persistent, but others just parachute in, stir up panic, and leave. There’s also a level of nastiness from certain shorts that I don’t see from the long side. This community has remained focused on healthy debate and real research. Both sides are welcome, but let’s keep it respectful and evidence-based.

- The constant push and pull between shorts and longs has, if anything, forced everyone to do deeper research and stress-test their thesis.
- I think that’s a net positive, regardless of which side you’re on. In this setup, constructive skepticism isn’t a threat - it’s fuel for stronger conviction.

**What does it all mean?**  
My read is that the short side has gotten crowded and potentially complacent - heavily leaning on historic biotech failure rates, price manipulation tactics, and the assumption that retail/institutional demand will dry up before the catalyst. But with short supply tightening, borrow rates ticking up, and options pricing in a massive move, the risk of a sharp reversal is high. If the readout is even passable, the shorts could be forced to cover aggressively into a thin float, potentially triggering a squeeze.

All things considered, this is the kind of setup where the next major move will be determined not by day-to-day games, but by the real fundamental outcome - meaning risk/reward is now as asymmetric as I’ve ever seen it in small-cap biotech.

**Company Operations, Filings, & “Tells”**

Recent operations and filings from aTyr have offered several clues about how the company is managing its risk, preparing for major events, and signaling to the market. Here’s how I’m reading each key element, strictly based on observed facts:

- **SEC S-3 “Effect” Filing**  
  - The effect filing makes a previously submitted shelf registration immediately effective. This gives the company legal clearance to raise capital on short notice if needed (for example, secondary, ATM, or PIPE).
  - In my view, this is a standard move for any late-stage biotech nearing a pivotal readout, especially one where either a positive or negative result could trigger rapid changes in capital needs. It is not an indicator of imminent dilution but a risk-management tool.
  - Sophisticated investors expect this kind of “optionality.” If anything, it reflects management’s discipline rather than any intention to surprise the market with a raise.

- **Job Advertisements**
  1. *Scientific Intern – San Diego*  
    - The intern posting is routine for a research-based organization. It may reflect ongoing lab activity and business as usual. I see no special read-through here regarding clinical outcome or operational shifts.
  2. *VP, Commercial Analytics, Insights and Operations*  
    - This is a much more telling role. Recruiting for a senior commercial analytics executive before a major readout indicates the company is getting infrastructure in place for potential commercialization and launch planning.
    - The timing, so close to a pivotal event, suggests management is thinking about go-to-market readiness, scenario planning, and having strong internal analytics if the Phase 3 data is positive.
    - Importantly, this type of strategic role would be needed regardless of outcome (for launch or partnership negotiation), but the presence of the posting now reinforces the view that aTyr is not asleep at the wheel on commercial planning.

- **Leadership and Communications**
  - The management team has kept a measured public stance: no evidence of “storytelling” or excessive hype in conference appearances (RBC, Jefferies, etc).
  - The company has not issued any unusual or promotional press releases, nor have they tried to talk up the share price through social media or aggressive investor outreach. Instead, they’ve focused on factual updates and process discipline.
  - For institutional investors, this approach signals a leadership team focused on execution rather than managing to short-term optics, which in my view is a positive.

- **Operational “Tells” and Red Flags**
  - So far, there have been no sudden resignations, surprise cost-cutting, or out-of-pattern moves by insiders.
  - No abnormal insider selling, and no change in the cadence of regulatory disclosures. Another tick in the box for operational stability.

**My Read**  
When I put all this together, I see a company operating as a textbook case for late-stage biotech risk management: keeping all financing options open, investing in commercial infrastructure, maintaining scientific activity, and avoiding “promotional” moves.  
If there’s a signal in all of this, it’s discipline, not desperation. The absence of “tells” is itself a kind of tell. The real message, in my view, is that the company is methodically preparing for all outcomes and not telegraphing the result, a behavior the best funds and analysts generally respect.

---

**Science, Thesis & Confidence Levels**

This is always just my current read - these aren’t fixed positions, and I strongly encourage everyone to interrogate the science, look at the trial design, and challenge my view. Here’s where I stand today:

- **Scientific Mechanism & Rationale**
  - Efzofitimod (formerly ATYR1923) is designed to target neuropilin-2 (NRP2), a cell surface receptor involved in immune regulation, particularly in shifting inflammatory macrophages to a more inflammation-resolving phenotype. In chronic lung diseases like sarcoidosis, ongoing macrophage-driven inflammation is a key driver. By binding NRP2, efzofitimod is intended to reset this balance and promote resolution of inflammation.
  - The March 2025 Science Translational Medicine paper provided independent evidence that the HARS protein behind efzofitimod can induce this shift, with effects replicated in independent labs and highlighted by leading academic KOLs.
  - This means efzofitimod is working upstream of typical anti-inflammatory drugs, potentially offering broader benefit.

- **Key Clinical Evidence: Phase 1/2 & 2b Data**
  - Most recent data comes from a robust Phase 1b/2a study in pulmonary sarcoidosis. Efzofitimod showed a strong safety profile (no major adverse signals) and a meaningful trend toward steroid reduction and better patient outcomes vs placebo. While not powered for full statistical significance, the effect size was clinically relevant and strongly suggests drug activity.
  - There were also trends for improved lung function (FVC) and quality of life, with some patients achieving steroid-free remission.
  - The pivotal Phase 3 is designed with regulator input and incorporates earlier trial lessons, which, in my view, increases the chance of a clean or approvable result.

- **Why My Confidence Is Where It Is**
  - In my view, the science is credible, the trial design is robust, and risk/benefit is attractive as more data emerges. Management has been disciplined - no hype, no odd trial changes, steady operational signals.
  - My confidence sits around 70-75% for a clear or approvable readout, 15-20% for mixed/approvable, and less than 10% for an outright negative. This is as much about what isn’t happening (no visible red flags, consistent KOL support) as what is.

- **Balanced: Why I Still Respect Both Sides**
  - Bulls are seeing a real platform, deepening scientific validation, and market scarcity if this works.
  - Shorts point to volatility in immune ILD trials, novel biology risk, and a history of setbacks in the space.
  - No view is fixed here - I could be wrong, and if the science or signals change, so will my outlook.

Again, these are just my views - they evolve. Please do your own research and build your own thesis. Both sides have valid questions in this story.

**Social Sentiment, Community Growth, & “How We Think”**

What I’m most proud of in this community isn’t just the rapid growth - it’s how people have matured as researchers and thinkers. You see members combing through conference schedules, flagging job postings, dissecting SEC filings, and cross-checking KOL presentations. People aren’t just trading - they’re reading between the lines, building out nuanced investment theses, and holding each other to a high standard of intellectual honesty.

My encouragement is simple: keep questioning, keep digging, and don’t be afraid to challenge consensus or even your own assumptions. The best results come from being curious but flexible, sticking to a thesis but knowing when to adapt.

The heart of this community is in challenging how people traditionally look at biotech and investing - pushing past headlines, embracing uncertainty, and always staying intellectually hungry. That’s what sets us apart.

---

**Synthesis & Working Hypotheses**

Bringing it all together, I think this setup is one of the most unusual and potentially asymmetric situations we’ve seen in small/mid-cap biotech. The combination of institutional conviction, active retail, a highly engineered short book, and a pipeline with growing scientific credibility puts us in rare territory.

- On the institutional side, the book is deep and diverse. Long-onlys, indexers, and smart healthcare specialists are sticking around or quietly building, even as some quant/hedge and tactical traders move in and out for short-term gain. The big standouts – BlackRock, Vanguard, FMR, Federated – aren’t flinching, and I haven’t seen the sort of mass “tourist” exodus you’d expect before a true rug-pull. In my opinion, this is telling.
- Short interest is still at historic highs, but the aggressive push into the stock in recent weeks – especially off-exchange – looks like more than simple bearishness. To me, it’s increasingly about controlling volatility, managing options exposures, and perhaps squeezing the last drops from the derivatives complex before the binary event. If the readout is good, a massive unwind could force covering and amplify any upside move.
- The options chain shows leverage stacked to both sides, but especially on the call side at key strikes just above current price. The expiry of major contracts before the readout opens the door for new positions, possibly favoring directional bets as we enter the final countdown.
- Operationally, the effect filing and recent commercial job ads reinforce the sense that ATYR is prepping for the next phase – not scrambling to survive. I read this as quiet confidence, not desperation. Leadership is keeping a low profile, which is what you want heading into a sensitive period.
- Scientifically, every new publication and the tone from management continues to support the idea that this mechanism has legs. The market may be slow to price in translational medicine or mechanistic nuance, but those signals are what matter for the medium- and long-term upside.

My best hypothesis: the next few weeks will bring more noise, more volatility, and likely a last gasp of short-driven panic. If the data is clean or even “approvable mixed,” this could become a case study in reflexive price action – retail and institutional FOMO, covering, M&A rumors, and platform rerating all feeding off one another.

What I’m watching most:
- Unusual options activity (especially new OI at high strikes)
- Changes in borrow availability and fee spikes
- Any 13G/D filings, insider activity, or block prints off-exchange
- The tone from management and top KOLs at upcoming conferences

In my view, this is the kind of setup where patience and discipline matter most. Stay focused on your thesis, stay curious, and expect the unexpected.

**Ask Me Anything / Community Engagement**

There’s a lot more I haven’t covered here, and I know people are following every angle of this story. If you want my take on anything specific, just ask in the comments – I’ll be posting more often as we move toward the readout and will do my best to get back to everyone. Always keen to see new research, findings, counterpoints, or opinions from the group. The more we challenge each other, the sharper our collective thesis becomes.

---

**Summary**

To wrap up – what a wild, fascinating period this is for anyone tracking ATYR. There’s an enormous amount of information flying around: we’ve just had a fresh round of institutional filings, shorts remain active and aggressive, there’s unusual off-exchange activity, options positioning has shifted after the last expiry, and social sentiment is at an all-time high. The science and management story keeps evolving, and new “tells” are popping up with job postings and company moves. We’re all trying to read between the lines – to understand what’s noise, what’s meaningful, and how different players (institutions, quants, shorts, retail) are positioning ahead of the pivotal readout.

In my view, the real challenge is to step back and digest all of this without panicking or getting swept up in daily volatility. It’s about building your thesis from multiple angles, acknowledging the information asymmetry, and being willing to change your mind when the facts change. This community’s engagement and depth of research are what make it so different, and I’m genuinely proud of how far we’ve come together.

On another note, if you continue to find value in these posts and want to help keep the analysis going as we approach the pivotal readout, you’re very welcome to support my work with a tip through [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/BioBingo). Every bit of support is appreciated and helps keep this project running.

Thank you for your continued support.

1mvbau4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1mvbau4/aio_about_my_bfs_female_friend/,AIO about my bf's female friend?,"My bf(40m) and I (35f) have been together for 3 years. Around 2 years ago, there was some trust issues as he gave his number to a woman while we were going through a rough patch. It did not lead to anything, but they did exchange somes messages. We talked about it, he admitted some of his insecurities around his fear of being along which pushed him to exchange number with that woman as he was feeling our relationship was failing..that we should break up due to the fights, but he could not bring himself to do it, and he thought that texting that other woman would help him leave. He did admit his behaviour was cowardly. He promised on building the trust again and we have since then established an open phone policy.

One month after all that last year, I noticed he had taken a picture of his coffee mug in the garden and I asked him to whom he sent the picture. He replied it was to his good friend Jessica (ficticious name) who lives in his home country. This set off lots of alarms:

1. During the 2 years we were together, he never mentioned her to me. 
2. He shared the screenshots of text messages with her and it was platonic. But messages prior to 3 weeks before were all deleted. When I asked about it, he stated that he deleted it as they had stopped texting for some time, he got frustrated as he felt she was not putting effort in the friendship, same as some other friends, so he deleted her msg along with some other friends messages.
3. She was not aware he had a gf. I asked him to send a msg to her to casually mention he has a gf, and he did it to prove that there is nothing going on with her. She was surprised that he had a gf and told him you have a lot of things to tell me.
4. She is always venting about her bf to him, criticising him and demeaning him, his mental health issues, etd, which I find inappropriate
5. He also lied that she was an ex. They were together as teenagers. They lost contact for around 20 years and re-connected around 5 years ago. Apparently nothing happened between them since then. She has 2 kids, got divorced and now has a bf. He said for him its been 25 years since they were together, they were kids, so she is not an ex as such. 
6. She invited him over to her house while he was visiting his home country and she was alone that day, with no kids and no bf there which bothered me.

My bf has other female friends. He has one girl best friend who he often invites to his place for dinner, and never had an issue with her. I communicated my discomfort to him about his friendship with
Jessica specifically and he agreed to the following:

1. He will let me know anytime they are texting again
2. He will avoid texting her constantly and will only reply when she reaches out and avoid going into deep conversations with her.
3. I can always check the msgs with her
4. He will not go to her house alone again.

During the past year I did not check his msgs with her. He did let me know last year when they texted a bit again. Recently I noticed msgs from her again. And they were long texts catching up with each other, about health issues, family issues, holidays, etc. He did not let me know that they texted again and the msgs did not seem short and casual.

I got upset and while he apologised for forgetting to let me know that he was texting her, he justified that I can always check his phone and he has nothing to hide. And that for him the messages are casual.

I also pointed out that during the last 2 weeks I have been telling him that when I try to text him at night or during the day from time to time, he always cuts the conversation short. He said he was busy with work and stressed with surgery. But it seems he had no trouble sending long messages to Jessica on those days. Even if it was nothing flirty, it still hurts that he has time and energy for her, but not for me. His reasoning is that we spend a lot of time together while jessica texts him after 1 or 2 months so they have more to catch up on.

But it bothers me. I try to tell him how Jessica makes me uncomfortable due to the past issues we had regarding their friendship, the deleted msgs, the lies, etc. But he downplays it. His reasoning is that since I have access to all the messages, it means he has nothing to hide, that I should believe she is just a friend and move on. That Jessica is a long time friend and he will not cut contact her. I am not saying to cut contact, but to limit it. Am I overeacting here?",1,1755686643.0,AmIOverreacting,5,0.67,False

Where the water takes me

Mommy's body was being dragged through the hallway, her head hanging limply as if she were nothing more than a ragdoll. Daddy's grip in her hair was pulling so tightly her neck arched back at an unnatural angle. Rage filled the empty house, but it no longer reached me.
Her screams faded into the background like white noise, it was his laugh that made my skin crawl. A sound so detached and cold, it seemed to freeze everything around us.

The air was heavy with the metallic stench of sweat and blood, thick and suffocating, as though it had soaked into the walls, settled in my lungs. I could taste it in the back of my throat. He wasn't stopping. His rage was relentless. He hit the wall beside her so hard, fist-sized holes broke through the drywall. A trail of destruction followed as he dragged her along. His fist was driven by rage, so blind that I wasn't sure he saw her anymore. She screamed and begged, but it was useless. His wrath had taken over. Nothing could reach him now.

Without thinking, I threw myself over her, desperate to protect. An act of love and fear. A shield of flesh and bones. But it was a foolish move. His eyes flashed dark with contempt. He wasn't even angry. Just annoyed. His gaze darted between us, and focused on me with pure disdain, as though my presence was nothing more than an inconvenience. An obstacle. I wasn’t a threat. I was a nuisance. 

With a careless shove, he tossed me aside and I hit the floor so hard my breath was knocked from my chest. I scrambled to sit up, my heart pounding, my body trembling, but his eyes were already back on her, like I had ceased to exist. With one final punch, he threw her limp body to the floor.

I collapsed beside her, my arms shaking as I gathered her black and blue form. Her skin was slick with sweat, heavy and lifeless in my embrace. I held her tightly, uncertain if it was more to comfort her or myself. But when her eyes finally met mine, there was no love in them. Her gaze was distant, far away as she hissed ""get off"", voice cold and stripped anything maternal. 

I froze, then desperate, I squeezed her tighter, praying for some sign of recognition. But when I finally let go, it was as if a weight had been lifted from her. Relief washed over her like I had been what she needed to shed all along.

We sat in silence after that. Neither of us spoke, neither of us cried. I refused to break. I had promised myself I would always stay strong, even if it meant burying my own fear. She hated when I got emotional. But sitting there, I could feel myself unraveling. Mom couldn’t cry anymore—and I thought she hated that I still could. But I came to realize, what she hated most, was being seen broken.
By someone who still needed her soft. When there was no softness left in her. Just a kind of cold resentment, like my needs were a weight she couldn’t carry anymore. Whatever she used to have, it was gone and needing it from her just made things worse.

Still I searched her face for anything—some trace of the mother I once knew. I noticed more and more of her was lost after each fight, but today’s rejection felt final. She was gone. I wanted to scream at her, shake her awake, tell her that I was still here, still holding on. But the words wouldn’t come. Instead I looked deep into her eyes, pleading silently with my own, but her gaze stayed unfocused. Vacant.
She wasn't seeing her daughter. She was staring right through me. She was somewhere I couldn't follow. Stuck in a place I couldn't reach.

I was alone, even though I wasn't.

""Come here,"" Dad's voice shattered the silence, harsh and demanding. I glanced at my mother, but she didn't respond. She didn’t move. Didn’t flinch. Didn’t care. 
“Go,” she whispered, barely audible. Her voice was hollow…and her eyes remained as though I wasn't even in the room.

I didn't want to go to him. I didn't want to leave her. But I had no choice. I knew resisting would only make things worse. Slowly, I forced myself to stand, my legs heavy. I moved toward him as if it was a dream, my body moving without my will. 

He sat on the coffee table, his body slumped, eyes hollow. His face was a mask of exhaustion twisted with something deeper, haunted by some unseen torment. When I reached him, he yanked me onto his lap with a force that made me flinch. His hand engulfed my entire waist. His grip suffocating, both protective and possessive, as if I were an object, something he could own. I stared down at his knuckles, swollen and bruised from years of violence, and a wave of dread rolled through me. My heart pounded in my chest, louder than anything else. He wasn't holding me to comfort me. He was holding me to control me.

Then I felt it, something cold brush against my thigh. My breath caught in my throat, panic rising like a wave. I knew what it was. I didn't need to look. The barrel of a gun was pressed against me, a gentle reminder of how easily it could all end. A warning…or maybe a promise.

My body went rigid, fear spreading through me like wildfire. My mind scrambled to make sense of it. What was he planning to do? I need to get out of here. As if he read my mind his arm tightened around my waist, not violently but with purpose —as if to keep me from escaping. I wanted to scream, run, vanish. But the gun. His touch. His breath. EVERYTHING became a cage. A cage that was slowly, relentlessly closing in on me. 

He was my father, but in that moment, I was both his daughter and his captive.

And then, without warning he cried.

Silent, sudden tears slid down his face. His breathing came out ragged, his whole body trembled against mine. He held onto me so tightly I could feel his pain as my own. It reminded me of the strange, suffocating bond between us. A closeness that had never been love, but something darker. Something I couldn't escape. And just like that, the threat hanging between us shifted.

He clung to me. His touch was no longer angry but desperate. Not a vicious monster but a man falling apart. Confusion wrapped around me and even as fear consumed me, there was an instinctive urge to soothe him. I was still scared. Terrified even. He hadn’t moved the gun. My muscles screamed at me to stay tense. But something inside me gave away. Maybe habit. Maybe something I couldn’t name.

Slowly, cautiously, I let myself slump against him. Not because I was safe, I wasn’t. But because I thought maybe…if I could make him feel safe.

 I could save him. Save us.

I wanted to ease his pain. I didn’t understand it, not really. But whatever it was, was leaking into me, soaking into my skin. And some twisted part of me thought if I stayed still, if I held him just right, if I could absorb enough of his darkness, maybe I could quiet the storm inside him. 

We were both trapped. Him by his demons. Me by him. And yet I couldn’t help but stay in his arms.  I let him hold me as though I could anchor him, as though my small body could somehow keep him from falling apart. I forced myself to relax, hoping to settle the emptiness inside him. Terrified. And trying to comfort the man I feared most. There were no words, but a thousand emotions passed between us.

Sometimes, on nights when it all became too much, Wonderland would take me away. My body would remain with him, but my mind slipped elsewhere—somewhere quieter.

Instead of staring at the gun I focused on the static on the TV in front of me, flickering in the background, blue and fuzzy, a strange comfort in its monotony. I was slipping away, like the noise was drawing me into another world, one where none of this mattered.
And then, I was gone.
Sinking underwater.
I wasn’t afraid. There was no panic, no racing heart, just a strange sense of calm. I floated, weightless, as the sunlight danced on the surface above me. It felt peaceful. The weight of everything—the violence, the fear, the helplessness—was fading away. For a moment, it was as if none of it could touch me. I could pretend everything was okay. I was drowning but I had never felt more safe, it’s the only time I felt peace.

As I sank further though, I felt their pain, faint but persistent, like a tether pulling me back. Their suffering was part of me. It flowed through my veins as surely as my blood. It was an echo just beneath the surface. Still, I clung to this fragile escape, desperate to remain in this stillness where nothing hurt. I held on as if it were the only thing keeping me together. The water cradled me and just for a moment, it was enough. Then, just as quickly as it came, the water faded, and I was back. His grip had loosened, and the spell broke.

The warmth of his body slipped away as he released me. His lingering touch, a reminder of the hurt I could never quite escape. The TV static was louder now, the room filled with a noise that drowned out the silence. I didn’t know how long I had been gone, lost in that peaceful world, but I knew I wanted to go back. The relief was fleeting, like a shadow that faded when the light changed. But I held onto it anyways, it's the only place I could breathe.

Later that night, after the violence, after the silence, I curled into a tight ball in bed. Pulling my knees to my chest, I sought the comfort of my own embrace. The darkness pressed in around me, suffocating, like the weight of it would crush me if I let it. I layed alone knowing neither of them would come. Neither of them would hold me, like I had held them.
So for the first time that night, I let myself cry. The tears came in heavy waves, each one dragging me deeper into the abyss of their pain. Though it wasn’t just their pain. It was mine too. I felt it in every fiber of my being, suffocating me from all sides. It was unbearable. I could feel them everywhere, both of them, pulling me down, dragging me under. 

I begged to sink beneath the surface once more. To drown. To feel no desperation, no frantic gasp for breath, just stillness. Far from the echoes of their suffering, far from the relentless noise of my thoughts.
But this time the water wouldn’t take me. I was still gasping for breath alone in my room. I reached for them, my hands grasped at the empty space where they should’ve been, even though I knew no one was reaching back.

My attempts to keep us afloat had failed. 
Still I’d drown with them before I let go.
And yet, even as I clung to that promise, something inside me wavered. For just a fleeting moment I wanted to know what it would feel like to completely let go. I wouldn't fight it, I'd slip blissfully beneath the surface. I’d welcome the peace, the quiet, the end of the pain. The pressure in my chest loosened, and for a moment, I thought maybe, just maybe I could do it. All I had to do was let them go. Let everything go.

But her screams tore through the stillness. A sound I’ve heard too many times pierced the silence like a knife. My mother's voice raw and frantic pulling me back. I couldn’t leave. They both needed me. My father’s tear filled eye’s followed me everywhere. They both haunted me. They’re eternal reflections of my own anger and fear. Their pain was woven into me not just something I endured, but something I carry.

I can't outrun it, I can't escape it. There’s no refuge from the ties that bind me. 

Sleep finally took me, not peace but surrender. The next day my nightmare would start over. I knew that when I woke up I'd still be there, still drowning, still trapped in the cycle.

The surface, forever just out of reach.
I had tried to carry us. Tried to stay afloat.
But now I knew the truth.
With or without them,
I could only ever sink.

1mvb67h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mvb67h,Easy Flaky Sourdough Croissants,"So I tried making flaky sourdough croissants this weekend, and let me just say... I have a whole new respect for bakers. Not gonna lie, I thought the whole sourdough croissant recipe thing would be this relaxing, fancy baking project, but wow. The laminating process? My kitchen looked like a battlefield. But I pushed through (with many coffee breaks). 



I’ve been dabbling in sourdough lately, mostly for bread, but croissants felt like another universe. The first batch had butter oozing everywhere. I literally questioned my life choices as I wrestled with dough sticking to my counter. But then, round two actually worked! When those golden layers started puffing up in the oven, my heart almost burst. The smell... rich and buttery with that tangy sourdough kick. It filled the whole house.



My kids were my toughest critics (because what’s more honest than a 9-year-old?) but they actually loved them. My youngest called them ""fluffy bread pillows"" and now I’ll never forget that. And my husband? He’s been side-eyeing store-bought croissants ever since, so I guess I’m stuck making homemade croissants for life now. It’s not a bad trade, I suppose.



One thing I discovered: keeping the butter cold is NON-negotiable. I even chilled my rolling pin between folds (overkill, but it worked). Also, don’t skimp on resting time. I learned that the hard way during batch one.



Anyone else struggle with laminating dough? Or have tips to keep the process from feeling like an upper body workout? Let me know!

1mvb2jt,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalmedium/comments/1mvb2jt/adrenaline_digestion/,Adrenaline & Digestion,"Hello MM Fam,

There are several observations I would like to share with you and also looking forward to some useful replies and a friendly discussion.

Something of great importance for me is having a flat Belly and feeling light and digesting well..Now the past three weeks I was eating very MM conform:

16oz LW 
16oz CJ
32oz HMDS
Fat free lunch (MM recipe)
Diner (mostly without troublemaker foods but not always)

With all that I felt rather bloated and even after waking up my belly was still not flat and even if not eating anything for 13-14 hours between diner and breakfast It stayed rather bloated.

NOW: Currently I am on vacation with my family and due to simplicity I have reduced my routine to LW in the morning. The rest of the day:

Breakfast - fruit, Baguette, cheese, ham, Jam, Black coffee 
Lunch - left over Curry or some fruit or nuts
Diner - whatever we cook as family (mostly vegan)

My belly is so much flatter the past days even though I am eating ALL the things I ""should not eat"". My acne is getting worse and I can feel the fat in my blood so I am.not saying ""this is the way and MM does not work"" but it would be nice to understand what is happening.

To give some more Information:

It is a lazy holiday and I am taking naps 2-3 times per day and also lying around at the beach a lot.

I am Not working and sitting in Front of my Laptop. At home I felt wired and under tension up until diner and only then I felt a relaxation.

At home I was struggling with a gaming Addiction where I spent so much time gaming even though my inner voice told me not to.

TLDR: currently on vacation and eating all troublemaker foods. I spend most time inapping, playing Board games and having a swim. Belly is now flatter than when doing a lot of MM Tools but feeling Stressed due to 12-15h screen time, gaming Addiction, little movement and little social Interaction.

Is there a relationship between digestion and Adrenaline / stress?
What can I do also at home to improve my digestion so my belly is nice and flat?

Thank you very much for reading and answering 🙏🫶🏻",0,1755685867.0,medicalmedium,1,0.5,False

1mvaznj,https://www.reddit.com/r/starwarsunlimited/comments/1mvaznj/my_favourite_store_is_dropping_swu/,My favourite store is dropping SWU :(,"SWU had a great slot (every Sunday). Participation peaked at 15-16 every Sunday and 20+ at showdowns. The store is not a traditional hobby store with tables, rather a boardgame caffee with product. The idea was to have zero profit from events (all fees went into prizing) and make money from product sales and coffee / snacks. In practice product sales where really low because boxes had a real hard time staying close to retail in price, and some people only paid for the entry and never got anything else.

So when participation dropped to bellow 8 per week the store owner said that Sunday is a prime slot and with gundam and riftbound coming up, he can no longer hold the slot for SWU.

I really really love swu, have more than 80 tournaments since launch in all local stores, and that store was a really cozy place to play at vs the standard chair and table setup at an lgs.

The owner is an ex player and knows the business from both ends, his tongue in cheek comment was that SWU players are too smart for their own sake.

His more professional comment was that overprinting has really hurt lgs support for the game since some stores can't follow the price downwards and would rather carry product that can hold prices close to retail.

1mvazjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1mvazjo/broken_up_and_confused/,Broken up and confused,"Me and my ex broke up 3.5 weeks ago before we both went on holiday. We saw each other for the last time right before we went and there were some doubts. Thats why we used the vacations to think about the breakup and if we were sure about it. During the vacation, we were in contact for a bit

Yesterday we met up again, had a drink together and talked about how we experienced the last couple of weeks. He told me, before breaking up, he mostly thought about the negative things but during the vacation he thought more of the positive things. But for him it is still not enough to restart the relationship again. I was very sad about it but understood his decision. After the conversation, we hugged, cried, listened to our songs and told each other how much we’re going to miss each other. He also told me he doesn’t feel attracted to other girls anymore and he would find it very difficult if i would find somebody else in the end. And that he wished i was the one. But he’s is staying with his decision and thinks its for the best. We also slept together last night. So its all very confusing.

I told him i need to block his number for a couple of weeks or months to heal for myself. I’m going to send him a last text tomorrow. He wanted to meet up for a coffee in 1 month. I’m very confused and just need some advice. When do i text him again? And why does he say all these things when he breaks up?",2,1755685575.0,BreakUps,4,1.0,False

The big Springfield “Hollywood” sign turns to “Far Far Away”. The Simpsons ride itself can get transformed into Shreks Swamp as the facade. The restaurants could be like the ones you see in Far Far Away parodying real ones. Put a real Starbucks but call it Farbucks Coffee like in the film and have all the cups and merch be themed to that. See if you can make Baskin Robinhood or the parodied Burger King in the film too. Maybe even one or 2 of the parodied clothing stores for merchandise as well. And to top it all off you can have a facade of the Far Far Away castle where they currently have the nuclear reactor up top.,3,1755685466.0,universalstudios,3,1.0,False
