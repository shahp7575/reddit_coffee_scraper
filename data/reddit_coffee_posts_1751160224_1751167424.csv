1ln4tp1,https://i.redd.it/ok8ubyrn8s9f1.jpeg,Tasting Menu + Armenian Coffee @ Taline in Summerhill,"I like making grids. This is the ""Chef's Curated Menu"" which is basically a tasting menu of some of their popular dishes, but you can also order a la carte. $90 pp, coffee I bought extra at the end ($5 iirc).

1. Mezes to start: Hummus (with cute little falafels), Babaghanoush, and the more unique ""Banru"" which is a spicy three cheese dip that hails from the Armenian majority town of Anjar, Lebanon.
2. Bread to go with the mezes
3. Mini-Fattoush salad - Personally, I like more crispy greens with my fattoush, but this was fine.
4. Grilled prawn on top of smoked labneh
5. Manteh
6. Lamb chops
7. Confit potatoes - The toum here is addictive
8. New dessert that's intended to be gluten and dairy free. ""Millefeuille"" with I believe a gluten free lavash (I'm assuming rice based?), some rice crackers on top, and a resteh cream made from coconut cream. Interesting mix of cultures here, though the overall flavour profile leans Southeast Asian to me.
9. Armenian Coffee

I don't have a good frame of reference for mediterranean cuisine when it comes to cost performance honestly, but I enjoyed the meal and was full at the end. Tbh I was having trouble finishing the meal, but I'm a small dude. Highlights for me were the mezes and prawn. I could probably do without the lamb chop and the dessert, but I'm admittedly a bit bored of lamb chops on menus these days, so this is just a preference thing. I want to come back and try their labneh at some point.",1,1751167337.0,FoodToronto,0,1.0,False

I was away in the country for a week, just seeking some quiet and stillness as my life gets rather hectic and I had not written creatively in quite some time...in fact my art had definitely been pushed to the side over the past few years—especially since the onset of the pandemic and becoming a voice for fellow disabled people in my community.

I was sitting on my own, on a very cold, grey, and cloudy day. I felt the weather was reflecting back how I was feeling and had a sudden rush to begin writing something...anything! I had no clear idea of the subject, I just wanted to write. What happened really quite surprised me, and my subconscious found it's voice.  
  
I ended up with a poem inspired by Tommy Cash, no doubt due to how much of his art and content I had engaged with recently. But, I had written it without any intention to do so. It was organic, real, and raw.

  
TL;DR Here is the poem.

  
***Tommy.***

*The world is grey, cold, bleak, wistful.*  
*I sit alone, in my discontent and quiet fear.*  
*What will tomorrow be?*

*I shelter from the storm, only for it to stir in me.*  
*Only for it to come crashing through my door, and find its place inside my head.*

*The world no longer feels safe.*  
*It feels ugly and isolating.*  
*I feel unwanted. Discarded.*

*But then a switch is flipped.*  
*A comfort found in absurdity. In oddity.*  
*This post-soviet provocateur is reflecting back my own aspirations.*  
*The artist I want to be, presents as a pencil moustache with braids.*

*I do not just see differently now, I dream differently too.*  
*I find inspiration. Direction. Courage.*

*Courage to expose myself to the world.*  
*Courage to let people see the real me.*  
*Courage to once again create in the gloriously absurd way that feels authentic to me.*

*A simple cup of coffee, masks the significance of the moment.*  
*It will lead me down an unknown path that will see me free.*  
*A flame ignites from the forgotten embers,*  
*and guides my wounded soul back home.*

*What will tomorrow be? I do not yet know,*  
*but I’m at least now excited to find out.*

(most of us are approx ~mid/late 20s-30s),"Hey there! I’ve posted here a few months ago (I wrote how challenging it can be to make friends in Marin if you’re not middle-age-retirement age) and am glad to report that I’ve successfully met some very fun and cool people!🙌

We have an informal What’s App group where we can connect for plans to do various fun local things: mainly brunches, dinners, hikes/walks, drinks/appetizers/coffee/tea, events, workshops, local parties, etc. Many of us are fairly busy, so it’s pretty casual and there’s no pressure to do things if you aren’t able to. The idea is that it’s like a meetup group, only more informal/less structured.

As much as I love kids (I used to teach and babysit), our activities aren’t oriented towards children, so if you’re looking for a group to bring your kid to, this won’t be your best option (Marin is very family-oriented, so I’m sure you’ll have no difficulty in finding that elsewhere!). The age part isn’t meant to discriminate against anyone but rather to create connections of people in a similar stage of life, so if you’re somewhat above or below the age suggestion you’re still welcome to join. Also welcome to anyone who identifies as a woman, regardless of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, marital status, etc. Please feel free to comment or DM if you’re interested in joining🙂",1,1751167218.0,Marin,0,1.0,False

About 20mins ago I just got into an argument with my parents. Long story short I tried once again setting a boundary with my mum about her commenting and trying to control my life whether that be through guilt tripping me, gas lighting or just straight up insulting me. But as always she says that I can’t do that because I haven’t experienced the things she’s experienced in her life so having an opinion on something like my own life, isn’t allowed or something like that, I don’t even really know what she’s saying anymore.

Anyway my dad joins in and supports my mum in saying that if I wasn’t such a lazy piece of shit and got a job than I can have an opinion on what I do with my life since they support me financially as a child. Also for the record, since January this year I’ve been searching for jobs and applied to 26 and done 3 trials all of which have said no because they don’t have enough money to train me. Also I know this isn’t really an excuse, but I’ve also been struggling a lot with my life over the past 5 years and I don’t really have any friends/family to turn to support so it’s hard to stay motivated to keep going with my life, which is why I am sometimes lazy.

Anyway about five more minutes of my parents saying that I’m lazy and worthless to them and how I should be grateful for them to even care enough to give me my own room, I lost it and just got up to leave to my room to which my dad said another insult that really got to me so I turned around and threw my coffee cup to the ground which of course shattered. (I know I shouldn’t have done this but I really couldn’t control it anymore). I went to my room which my dad tried to kick the door down to what I’d presumably be hit me, lucky I was able to block off the door, but then my parents started yelling at me saying that they’re going to throw me out on the street and that I’m this and that and you get the point. In the heat of the moment I said I will so that they’d stop trying to get in, but my dad full charged through the door which send me flying back and he got in my face pointing and yelling at me and all about how he’s had to put up with me for too many years and that he’s sick of dealing with me and that he’s ashamed that I don’t have a job or anything. My mum joined in and threw a suitcase at me and said how much she wants me to leave. I yelled at her and she said what did she do wrong and I said about how she literally just called me a piece of shit to which she initially denied, then confirmed and then told me not to twist her words all within 30s of her calling me a piece of shit.

They’ve left now after I said that I’ll pack my bags and everything, and now I’ve had a shower and calmed down I just don’t know what to do. It’s not like this is our first time yelling at each other, we’ve always argued at least once or twice a week depending on if they had a good day at work or not. I don’t really see a situation where this resolves and I’ll still talk to them, especially when they’re so damn openly homophobic and I’m gay and they don’t know nor does anyone else in my life knows but they’ve made me feel so isolated and alone because of they’re open homophobia that I’ve internalised so much hate of myself. 

The reason why I don’t know if I should leave or not, is because my dream job is to be an airline pilot and there’s this airliner flight school that would get me to that level really fast, but it’s $100,000 + $400/week AUD for accommodation. Obviously I don’t have that money, and their support would make it a lot easier on me, but first I got to get in, and I’d only know if I get in, in mid August. 

Anyway as for where I’d live if I left, my sister and her boyfriend has their own apartment and my sister has said before that I’m welcome to have a sleepover if my parents ever get too much, but I’m not sure about staying there for more than a week or so but I’m sure she’d be supportive, I just don’t want to impose on their life. 

But I know if I stay nothing will change, I’ll apologise they’ll still call me a piece of shit and still deny that they did anything wrong and they’ll keep doing it the next day. But at least I still have a bedroom and food and maybe they’ll still support me where I can’t financially.

There’s only a few time periods where I can fall asleep and actually stay asleep. It all depends on what’s going on in my life and the things I do leading up to sleep but I typically have a difficult time staying asleep.

These random wake times are tied to things like my depression. For some reason, it won’t let my stay asleep. Anxiety, not eating enough and most important of all, getting beat out my sleep when I was younger. My mom would come into my room early in the morning to hit me. She’d rip the covers off of me and hit me with her hand or some random object. She loved using the kitchen spatula. I got hit for leaving a few dishes in the sink, not cooking rice for her, not washing her coffee mug, not leaving something in sight for her to find, accidentally leaving my phone with me instead of having it on charge downstairs.. it messed my sleep schedule up really bad. This happened on and off from the ages of 11-15. It stopped but the damage has been done. I’m 21 now and the effects are still there.

I take a mixture of magnesium, ashwaganda and melatonin. I typically take more than what’s recommended because I don’t enjoy being awake. It still doesn’t keep me asleep. I play music/binaural beats while in bed, I journal in bed or read, I turn all the lights off, I try to stay off my phone past 10. I do everything under the sun and I still wake up at these random times. I know that the solution is to move out of the environment that I’m in so don’t come up here stating the obvious.

It’s how inmates survive .  It’s a canteen where you can buy hygiene and special food items that aren’t served on the cold, terrible trays. It is an isolated ray of sunshine in an inmates world.

anybody that says that jail inmates are coddled in today’s day and age has never spent a day in jail. It is fucking horrible.  It is less horrible with food and toilet paper.

**Lion’s Sea Step, Meeting, 1308 Hours, Nov 3rd, 2025**

Pvt. James Seamore and Pvt. Matt Johnson waited outside the negotiation canopy. *Guard duty. It’s always guard duty.* The young Private thought, watching the scene in front of him. He estimated four, no, almost five dozen. The eyes of the natives watched with great interest on the men.

“So, what do you think?”

James looked to his fellow Marine, dumbfounded. “What do I think? You ask that now, of all times?” He went back to scanning the crowd of people.

“Just asking.” Matt shrugged and did the same.

*Sigh,* “Well, I think this is some crock of shit. I mean, boots like us always get guard duty. I wanted to explore, you know? Brave new world, and all that shit.”

“You idiot, that comes later. First, the government gets what they want, then we get what we are given.” The young man said before turning his attention from his brother in arms.

“Besides, I think it would all be worth it in the end and you can do all the exploring that you want…” Matt smiled at one of the natives. A blonde woman, in a crimson silk dress, too revealing to be a proper lady. Unsurprising, considering what else this city is famous for. James noticed this and raised an eyebrow.

“Oh, for fuck’s sake, when I said exploring, I’m not thinking of Conquistadors so get your mind out of the gutter. You don’t even know what these people could have. Plus, you remember what happened to the last guy who got something from that Japanese chick, right?”

He winced at the thought, “Yeah, enough Penile Swabs for a Marine battalion. I get your point. I guess we just have to SITFU for now.”

James thought of something to lighten the mood, but he never got the chance.

“***Haha…HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!***”

Laughter broke from the canopy. Sudden and loud. Both of the Marines wondered who laughed like that.  
  


“Well, that’s some creepy ass laugh, like an alien that just learned how to laugh by mimicking humans. Can you tell who it was?” James asked Matt.

“Beats me, but I can somewhat guess from whom based on that voice… and considering what kind of SOB he is, I don’t even wanna know what makes **him,** of all people, laugh,” Matt replied.

  
Although they may have a hint of whom, they'd best not say anything about it. However, the same can’t be said of the people who are inside the negotiation canopy.

**Lion’s Sea Step, Meeting, 1310 Hours, Nov 3rd, 2025**

*What in the seven hells has got into him?* Kevan questions as he watches his brother laugh, deeply, like a war drum before battle. His brother, the Shield of Lannisport, the great watcher from Casterly Rock. The most powerful man in all the Seven Kingdoms, if not the world, laughs like their Lord Father once did years ago.

His eyes ventured over to the Lannister Guards behind them, and their faces. Their faces showed **fear**. The Red Cloaks of Casterly Rock are no normal guards; they are true soldiers. Unlike the savages of Clegane’s Keep who are only good for foraging and terrorizing peasants, these men were bred for *war*, trained day in and day out, lived by their sword, spear, and shield, all to protect their liege lords and his family. They are the Lannisters’ answer to the Unsullied of the far east, minus the chopping of their cocks off, of course.

What developed in his strategic mind then we’re the rumors that are going to spread. They raced around, developing into a typhoon. But were halted.

“Ha ha. The Lion does not concern himself with the opinions of the sheep. But your people, my lady… are no sheep. You have shown that much, you and the Captain. And for that, you have my respect.” Lord Tywin methodically clapped.

Kevan raised an eyebrow to this.

“So… you were testing us?”

“Indeed.”

“But why almost throw away this meeting? To gamble on it?”

“To see what you are forged from. When a knight trains from an early youth as a squire, do you have him wear steel? No, he must be forged by fire and steel, hammered into shape on the anvil of war. Because a knight’s experience could be the difference between life and death. Every cut, every bruise, every broken bone he earns molds him. You say that you are not and have no highborn, which for us would mean no knights.”

“But from what I see before me, everyday citizens were bred into warriors. Maybe something more. You do not wear visible armour. Your confidence is your armour, your **words** are your sword. Your **history** has tempered you, burned you, hammered you into what sits before us. To put it simply, your people know their place, and I mean that as a compliment, you know the power that you have, and I can admire it.”

“I am used to being groveled too. **Feared** by my banner man. Because fear keeps them in line. Judging from your letter, I am quite sure that Maester Lorwell had told you about a certain song called “The Rains of Castamere”, no?”

“In a way, I suppose.” Kelly shrugged. “We have other ways of keeping those in line other than fear, but I get what you mean. And yes, Maester Lorwell indeed had told us about the rebellion by your former bannermen, the Reynes and the Tarbecks”, she drank from her glass, “and about the fall of Kings Landing.”

Tywin gave the Maester a glare of disapproval, “I presume he explained everything in **great** detail”, he put emphasis on the word ‘detail’, “as I would have done.” The maester could feel himself trying to sink into the chair.

“He did”, Lorwell was relieved to hear the words come from her lips, “I was eager to hear more, but we did not have time, of course. Maybe another time you could share with me your own 'account' of the event.”

“I would be delighted, my Lady. But for now, we have business to attend to.”

“Very well.”

**Lion’s Sea Step, Meeting, 1315 Hours, Nov 3rd, 2025**

“It must be a permanent place?”

“Yes”

“But… Castle Golden Keep would be a marvelous place for you to stay. My lady wife, Rosalynd, would be honored to host you there, as would I.” Lord Tyran used all his charm and gracefulness he could muster to convince Kelly to set up the consulate residency in his castle.

“We thank you for the offer, but a consulate building must be a center for diplomacy. Having it in a Lord's castle would make it seem like favoritism to the other regions. Which is why it must be in a separate establishment.”

Tyran was disappointed, but understood her reasoning. “As you say, my lady.”

During the two-hour grace period before Tywin and his people were to be picked up, Kelly took some time to examine the area around the Lion’s Sea Step itself. *More of a mild curiosity,* she told Capt. Richard, but in reality it was for the perfect spot for a consulate building.

Before leaving Washington, she was given the full authority to do so. “*Just don’t go crazy with it, ok*?” The Secretary of State’s words. *Hehehe*

With this in mind, though, she did want the building to have a major impact on the local area itself. And after some investigating, she found the perfect one. Not too far from where they are docked is the city's town square, cobblestoned to the pier, a straight shot you could say. Two old, rundown two-story buildings sat, most likely abandoned, for almost ten to fifteen years or so. The buildings faced west, towards the Sunset Sea. If the buildings could talk, Kelly wanted to hear their story.

The square seemed more like a market, unlike the one on the pier; this one seemed to sell anything other than fish. Like silk, clothes, parchments, animals, books, and food. A few also sold what appeared to be armour as well. *It must be old pieces to be in a normal square. And not at the shop it's made from.*

“There are two old two-story buildings in the town square, not far from here, about a hundred yards or so. They appear to be structurally sound, and they're large enough, at least for our needs now. Do you know about it?”

“Besides that they are old? Not much I know about it, I must say.” Tywin said bluntly, “But, Lord Commander Torren, what do you know of these buildings?” He turned to look at his second cousin. He was eating a slice of bread when all eyes were not on him.

“Oh, those buildings? My predecessor, Lord Commander Marlyn Lannister, shut those buildings down because of an illegal counterfeit coin group. I believe they were called “The Bronze Rings” and ran underneath the two shops above. The “Lioness Cove” and the “Lion's Cliff” were the names. They both were known for their beef and pork pies and decently priced beds. At least that's what the old smallfolk say.”

“Shame really, but now? We find gutter rats sleeping beneath their roofs. They are easy to catch because the places sit on the main cobble road leading up towards Castle Golden Keep. They were both the third and fourth buildings in the city to be connected to the sewer line that comes down from the castle and into the sea. The others are the Golden Sept and I believe the Golden Delight Brothel.”

To Tywin, this was nothing new. Torren spent his time at both the Golden Sept and of course, the Golden Delight Brothel. He just wished Torren didn’t bring it up. “But are they suitable for their uses, Torren?” Tywin presses.

“Forgive me, but I would not know, my Lord. I would say the best course of action would be to have a builder or two take a look. Wouldn't it be right to have them set up shop, just for the buildings to collapse on them.”

“So it could either need some touch-ups or a complete teardown and rebuild?” Kelly questioned the man.

“You would be correct, My Lady. It will depend on what the stonemasons have to say.”

“In that case, you can leave it to us, our Navy has Military Engineers who handle all sorts of construction. They are nicknamed the ‘Seabees’.” Capt. Richard informed them with enthusiasm. “These are tough men and women who can pave away anything thrown at them, it is their job after all. They are onboard the *USS San Antonio* now. With your permission, Lord Tywin and Lord Tyran, of course, we could have them here in half an hour.”

*So your fleet has an entire order of engineers dedicated to construction, for fortifications, camps, and siege engines perhaps, which from the looks of it, also act as a vanguard force, and they are just onboard your ships now? You are prepared for the worst, my lady.* Tywin thought with great interest. As he thought, he sipped this *coffee* that was brought in.

This coffee drink was served hot like tea but different. Made from grounded seeds of an exotic plant of the same name, the taste was bitter, and it had some kind of herbicidal properties that allowed his eyes to keep awake and his mind to stay sharp and focused. Lady Kelly told him that it was one of the staple drinks of her people and he can see why, this is the kind of drink any self-respecting noble would prefer over the intoxicating wine when it comes to doing their duties.

*When we’re finally talking coins, I’m going to make sure that Casterly Rock would have an entire cellar of these coffee seeds.* Tywin mentally noted.

Kelly watched as Tywin leaned over to his brother and whispered amongst themselves for a solid minute. A few nods were shared, a few more glares at her and the Captain.

“Very well, we will allow you to bring these ‘Seabees’ into Lannisport and ‘survey’ the former ‘Lioness Cove’ and 'Lion's Cliff’.” Kelly was glad to hear this, she wanted to express her gratitude. She wasn't given a chance.

“But”, Tywin lifted a hand to let the word hang in the air, “you must allow us to observe your men working on the buildings, so our stonemasons can,” his nostrils flared, “learn your craft. Keep in mind, this would be a simple observation and your men can otherwise do their work unhindered. What say you?”

The Americans looked at one another, almost speaking with their gaze. No harm in letting them just “observe”, right?

“That would be an acceptable proposal. Speaking of observing, there’s one place that we would like to visit, and we would like to ask your permission for it.”

“What is it?”

“We would like to visit the Golden Sept and see the Septon in charge.” Tywin raises his eyebrows. “As you know, Maester Lorwell has told us many things about your people. Among them is the religion that you followed, the Faith of the Seven, and how your city hosts one of the largest places of worship in Westeros, the Septs as your people called it. So we would like to extend our greeting to the priest, the Septon in charge there to clear up some things about our appearance. You see, we have made quite a bit of commotion among your smallfolks, so we would like to prevent any misunderstandings as early as possible.”

“What could be so important to meet with them as soon as possible?”

“Our people have a saying: any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. As such, we don’t want to come off as some kind of sorcerers, demons, envoys of the god of death, or even gods themselves, especially not to the believers of the main religion of this land.”

“So you do not want to strike fear into the smallfolk,” Tywin guessed with a raised brow, “But to show them that you come in peace, and to prove that you seek the local Septons' approval, am I not mistaken?”

“Precisely.” *And to minimize the chance of your bitch of a daughter to use them on some hair-brained plot against us.* Kelly added in her mind.

“Hmm…then I shall allow it. We do not want a peasant uprising **or** revolt on our hands.”

“I am pleased to hear it,” Kelly said with a smile, She then turned to one of the Marines behind them. “Can you get me in touch with the Captain of the *USS San Antonio,* please?”

**Lion’s Sea Step, Meeting, 1325 Hours, Nov 3rd, 2025**

Kelly made her way back inside the canopy “The *San Antonio* will get close enough to launch her Landing Craft, as well as another two from the *USS Makin Island*, they both should be here within the hour.” she said, taking her seat next to the captain, “So, have anything interesting to chat about while I was gone?” She questioned, looking around the table, it appeared they were in a deep discussion about something.

“I was just explaining the concept of diplomatic immunity,” the captain said. “It turns out, it wasn’t a foreign concept for them, as they do communicate with merchant representatives of Free Cities and Summer Isles on almost a regular basis.”

“Yes, my lady.” Kevan answered, “I can still recall a time when Summer Isles’ traders were injured in a brawl with some drunken bannermen of a noble house. The Summer Islanders then refused to trade spices with us for five to six moons until we punished the responsible rabble and sent an envoy to Summer Isles to apologize to them. You can see why treating foreign representatives with respect is also important to us.”

“Ah, that’s good to hear.” Kelly said before thinking to herself. *Note to self, recommend the high brass to look into Summer Isles and to keep an eye on any swan-looking ships docked in this port later on. Those people might turn out to be important trade partners in the future*.

“But, just to be sure we understand, could you explain it, my lady?” Tywin asked her, more for political insight than anything else. As she did, his mind went back into the histories for an example of when it would have been a good idea to have their version of this “Diplomatic Immunity.”

The more he listened, the more examples from history came to mind. Aenys Blackfyre was the major incident that came to mind. Promised safe passage to King’s Landing by Brynden “Bloodraven” Rivers. Only for him to be executed upon his arrival. *If this ‘diplomatic immunity’ concept, at least, the Americans version had come to us a century ago, then Westeros would be a very different place. Yes, very different indeed.*

**Lion’s Sea Step, Meeting, 1400 Hours, Nov 3rd, 2025**

As the discussion went on in length for quite some time, what felt like an hour, at least that was how long it seemed to Tywin in his mind. Learning quite a lot about ‘Earth’s’ geopolitical landscape. *Geopolitical,* another word added to his already extensive vocabulary. The Maester right next to him had been writing almost non-stop, only to take a drink of water, or shake the numbness out of his hand. Understandable, considering that these Americans seem to have extensively modified their Common Tongue, which they referred to as English language after their former liege kingdom, that there are simply too many new words to be recorded by just a single maester.

The other four at the long wooden table had been given their own ‘notebook’ and ‘pen’ to write down questions and answers to their heart's content. Tywin's pen moves as well, not like the Maesters, of course. No, that would be Kevan’s job to do. His brother’s pen moved like a carriage on a frozen lake.

The information coming through his ears flowed like a raging Tumblestone river, or of a broken dam after a harsh rainstorm. Filling, flooding every crevice of his mind. The knowledge seemed almost forbidden in this quantity.

Light shines through the door as a lone Marine comes inside, stopping the discussion. “Sorry to interrupt, Ma’am, but the Seabees are pulling in now. About one hundred and fifty yards away. They're asking where to dock, Ma’am, what should I tell them?”

“Lord Tyran, would it be alright to dock closest to the road that leads to the soon-to-be consulate building?” Kelly asked the man, who was finishing up writing something on his notepad.

“If I understand your description correctly, then there should not be a problem for them to do so in front of the seaside shops. Plenty of space for the docking lines.” He said with a smile, his golden mustache catching the light.

“Very well then, let them know where to dock. We will meet them there.”

“Yes, Ma’am.” The Marine gave a nod and left. Leaving the seven of them alone. Besides the guards, of course.

Kelly began to stand from her seat and stretch. “So, shall we go out and wait for them?” She asked the group, all standing slowly, letting their joints loosen. A few making very faint pops.

“I believe that is a yes, my lady. I am quite curious how you're… ‘Hovercraft’ functions.” Ser Kevan said, popping his back.

I (22F) live with my parents and my little brother (16M). Both my friends and his friends often come over. I hate when my brother’s friends visit because of their poor hygiene. Before coming over, they usually play basketball or other sports, and they arrive all sweaty without taking a shower or changing their clothes. I hate the smell when they are here. That said, my parents have never said anything to my brother about his or his friends’ hygiene.

On the other hand, my friends are all very clean girls. Obviously, they don’t bring the disgusting foot odor that my brother and his friends do. My friends usually go barefoot in our house since they wear sandals and take them off when they come in.

Yesterday, two of my friends came over. Our house was slightly cold, and one of them put her feet on the coffee table in the living room. To me, this is totally normal behavior. However, after they left, my parents warned me that it was very rude for my friend to place her bare feet on the coffee table and told me I need to make sure it doesn’t happen again. They also said they find it rude that my friends walk around barefoot in the house without socks or slippers, and that I should talk to them about their behavior if I want to keep inviting them.

I found this very strange because, in my opinion, there’s nothing wrong with what they did. They are clean, and it’s completely normal to be barefoot. I also don’t see the problem with putting your feet on the coffee table. I think it’s really unfair that my brother has never been warned about his friends’ poor hygiene, while my parents criticize my clean friends for being barefoot.

Chapter 1

After discovering that Kason had been secretly seeing his mistress for three years and was planning to marry her, I decided to leave him and return home for an arranged marriage.

On the first day, I handed the engagement ring he had given me to his mistress.

On the second day, I discarded everything that reminded me of him.

On the third day, I put on my wedding dress and married his arch-rival, Ronan.

From that day forward, Kason and I were no longer connected.

Kason scoffed, thinking I was just throwing a tantrum.

Until he saw the news of my marriage to someone else.

Only then did he panic.

==============================

In the office, the two of them were completely unaware of my presence outside the door.

I poured out the coffee I had made for Kason and left.

Kason had always kissed me with such care, so I had never seen him so passionate before.

Now I knew it was because he had given that side of himself to someone else.

I had thought I could marry for love, but reality had hit me hard.

Numb and disheveled, I wiped away my tears and took a cab back to the mansion.

I'm trying to get to the bottom of my sinus tachycardia episodes, focusing on my caffeine intake 

Basics:

- chocolate junkie (but have cut down drastically)

- used to drink 2 Lungo sized cups daily (65mg of caffeine, 1 at 10am and 2nd around 530-6pm before exercise, total 130mg per day). I've cut this down to literally maybe 2x a week with an occasional ""fun coffee drink""

Episodes

- 1st ER visit this yr: possible tachycardia due to coffee (according to my log I did exercise that day which is my habit). Had my episode 5hrs later, thankfully everything was fine

- 2nd ER visit. Inconclusive because I likely had an anxiety attack. This was just 3 days later after the 1st ER visit. Nothing found but high possibility I drank coffee at 9-10am. Went to the ER around 1-2pm, perhaps 4 hrs after my coffee intake

- 3rd ER visit. Unfortunately there's no evidence I exercised that day, but still possible I had my morning coffee and a late afternoon one. Went to the ER at 11pm which sort of correlates to around the same time as my 1st ~ 5-6hrs later

- after my 3rd ER visit, Ive made an effort to go cold turkey for at least 2 weeks. I've been doing my 2-3x a week intake since

Yesterday I had an episode. Had a latte which apparently has an espresso shot at around 830am. My episode happened at 230pm, around 6hrs later after my intake

My assumption:

I've been drinking coffee twice a day for a long time. Is it possible my body isn't metabolizing it quickly enough anymore? A high possibility that the effects only kick in 4-6hrs after my intake

Thank you in the meantime.

Yellow Walls:

She never liked the colour yellow. In fact, she hated it. It was so obnoxious, like it screamed to be heard, to be seen, to be noticed. Not only seen, but to be seen as happy and content. Rodgers' ex-wife, Marry, loved the colour. She had plastered it all over the walls and made sure it complemented every striped curtain in the dining room. So every time Lisa went to make her morning coffee, she had to be reminded of what she had done, what she had ruined. It made the silent room eerie with nothing but guilt and the clinking of the coffee cup.

“You know, Rodger, green is quite in style right now. I think it would look great in our dining room,” Lisa suggested while setting down the pot roast the smell filling the room with the once warm feeling the house emulated.

“Now why would we spend money to paint over a perfectly fine colour?” he muttered back, almost snorted.

Rodger hated change. He wore the same clothes Marry picked out for him four years ago when he took his manager job and had the same hairstyle he wore in high school. Lisa felt like she never really moved in. Everything around her was another push out the door. Sometimes she vented to her friend. She didn’t like to admit it, but she did. How trapped she felt, not in her own world but in the world built brick after brick by Marry. Oh, that beautiful smug Marry. How Rodger never truly moved on. How she never truly moved on either. But when her friend Ann wasn't there to vent to, all she could do was hold it all inside. Those damn yellow walls.



Lucid Dreams:

The boy couldn’t help but toss and turn in his bed. Tomorrow would be long, but tonight felt even longer. As time went on, his mind began to wander, and his imagination began to dance across the walls, great big elephants and small elegant elves. What was once a laundry bin magically transformed into a pot of gold. He felt truly euphoric, his mind floating up into space while his body fell a million miles down on his still mattress.

Suddenly, a loud thud against his window tore him from his world of wonders. His head cocked back only to see something that couldn't be described in words.

The warm gold tinted light kissed his shivering skin. “Hello, my son,” the embodiment of light echoed, as a million voices spoke in unison. The boy froze.

“I am here to give you the one thing no human has been able to grasp,” it continued. “I am here to give you the meaning of life.”

I'm moving to Boston on July 1st (I'll be subletting a room for 2 months) and I'm really looking for a part time job to keep me busy and productive for some time. For some context, I'm a 2nd year Northeastern student who'll be starting in the Fall. Because I attended their Global Scholars Program and suffered with some health issues while abroad in the first semester, I had to come home for a semester long medical leave while I got healthy again. During that time, I got a job at Urban Outfitters for 4 months and took online classes. The reason I wanted to sublet and work during the summer was because I thought that it would help me get ready for the full swing of Uni life after kind of only talking to my family for months (they also moved to Boston for my mom's job and so she could live with her sister). Sorry for oversharing, but I hoped the context would show how important this is to me. Plus it's somewhat of an unusual situation LOL.

I was planning to transfer from my Urban Outfitters over the summer, but my manager there was not the best and would snap constantly at all the workers. I emailed them about transferring me, and they asked for the location and said they would, but didn't follow up. Now that I've quit, I'm kinda worried about what I'll do during the summer - I really want to focus on being my own person and being self sufficient. I have a good amount of job experience and volunteer experience (I've worked 2 summer jobs at Dunkin' and T4 Taiwan on top of UO and have over 80 hrs of volunteer experience) and I'm really looking for places to apply! I'd be happy to stay on after the summer as long as I could clarify my schedule for school. I'd definitely prefer to work at a café, coffee shop, bookstore, or some sort of fashion/retail place because I like working places that make me look forward to work but I also don't know if I can be picky. 

Sorry again for the rant, I'll post my resume below! Please let me know good places to work, how best to score an interview, and how difficult or easy it is to find part time jobs in Boston. Basically I really just don't want to waste money doing nothing in Boston and get really depressed, I want to enjoy living in the city for the first time and stay busy/spoil myself a bit since I pay for anything that isn't school and food mainly. Please help! Thank you! I'll also make sure to write cover letters and follow up in person.

1ln4bnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/1ln4bnk/need_so_much_advice_because_im_confused/,Need so much advice because I'm confused,"Hey, so I have the biggest crush on one of the barista's at my local coffee stand, and I flirt with her a lot, and sometimes I feel like she flirts back, but I also know barista's flirt with customers in general 😅 I've been trying to feel it out to see if she feels the same and ask her if out for a month but I'm insanely dense and think too much. Anywho, I brought my roommate (who doesn't drive) with me today because she wanted coffee and offered to pay, since her girlfriend was working; and I usually bring my cat😂 but in line, her coworker literally poked her head out the window and saw me and smiled, but then saw my roommate and her smile kinda faltered for a second. Then when I pulled up, I had to dive into my wallet to look for the stamp card and had didn't get the chance to look at her, but when I looked up and over, her coworker was pretty rude (usually super bubbly and nice to talk to,) and asked for my order which is unusual because the barista I have a crush on is usually the one who comes up to get my order (regular here,) and she just was quietly making the drinks behind her and wouldn't even look at me. Which honestly confused me because we talk all the time. I got the feeling she thought my roommate was my girlfriend so I really badly tried to hint and ask her what time *her girlfriends name* was coming home (I kicked myself after realizing I should of asked ""when is your girlfriend coming home?"")
Then when we got home, my roommate (who knows about my crush,) told me she did come to the window at first all smiley, then looked into my window and saw her and her smile dropped and when my roommate smiled at her, she looked away. So the advice I'm honestly looking for is, because of this, I'm almost 99% sure feelings are mutual. How do I explain that my roommates just my friend without having to really say that? I feel really bad and I don't want her to think I was just playing with her😅 Also, because I'm almost certain she's into me too, how can I ask her out without making it too obvious or putting pressure on her?

Name: Taichung Lychee Half Marathon

Date: 29.06.2025

Distance: 21.1 km

Location: Taichung, Taiwan

Time: 1:25:59



---

###Goals

Goal	Description	Completed?

A	Sub 85 min	No

B	Sub 90 min	Yes



---

###Training

I started training 4 weeks after my first-ever HM (1:31:30). I ran that one really conservatively, so I was hoping to go for sub-85 minutes in my next attempt. I averaged 60 km per week over the 12-week training block, using Pfitzinger’s 12/47 HM program. It was way more mileage than before (around 40 km/week), so it seemed intimidating at first. I'm glad to say I didn’t miss a single run during the 12 weeks—but I still faced quite a few difficulties.

First, I’m living in Taiwan for half a year, and I didn’t realize how hot and humid it gets starting in May. My hometown reaches up to a dry 40°C annually, but there’s always some respite at night. That’s not the case here—26°C is the lowest it gets, and I think that really affected me mentally and physically.

Another problem was my nutrition. My stomach just isn’t used to Taiwanese food (quite heavy), so I wasn’t eating enough. I lost about 4–5 kg (10 lbs) during the training block. That might’ve helped a bit with weight, but I think my workouts suffered from the lack of fueling.

Finally, I kind of ruined my taper by climbing Yushan (3,952 m) without cutting down mileage. It wasn’t the hardest hike I’ve done, but I still felt the heaviness in my legs on race day.


---

###Pre-race

I ran a 10K race 3 weeks out and it went terribly. I was aiming for a 37–38 min finish but ended up with 40:20. The heat and humidity were brutal, and I came into the half marathon pretty demotivated. My plan was to go out at 4:10 min/km pace and see how it went. A PR would’ve made me happy, considering the conditions.

I woke up at 4:00 for the 6:00 start. For breakfast, I had my usual Taiwan race combo: an onigiri, 1–2 bananas, and black coffee. I drank a lot of water and—true to Taiwanese style—scootered to the race. I did 10–15 minutes of slow jogging, strides, and some dynamic stretches. I slightly overdid the hydration and ended up peeing four times in the hour before the start. Still made it to the line by 5:59.


---

###Race

It was 27°C at the start, sunny, and around 80% humidity—just as expected. I paced the start perfectly and tried to keep my heart rate under 175 bpm for the first half. In my last HM, I averaged 174 bpm, which felt a bit too easy, but I didn’t want to blow up this time.

I missed water at the first two aid stations, which worried me, so I decided to walk through all the next ones. I tucked in with two other runners, and we cruised together until around 13 km. That’s when I pushed the pace—my partners were fading. I ran behind a local YouTuber from then until the finish.

At around 17 km, I started falling apart. There was no shade in the last 5 km, and I slowed to 4:30/km and 4:20/km in the 19th and 20th km. Thankfully, the final km had shade again, and I managed a 3:58/km to finish in 1:26:06.


---

###Post-race

I love Taiwanese races. You always get a medal, towel, t-shirt, food, drinks, and gifts—it’s insane. And races are dirt cheap—I paid like 20–30 euros for this one.

I finished 15th out of more than 1,000 people, and my chip time was 1:25:59. I’m really proud of that. I started running 11 months ago, and I could barely complete a 5K. Now, I’ve hit 3 of my 4 original lifetime goals: sub-20 5K, sub-40 10K, and sub-90 HM. My last goal is a sub-3 marathon, which I’m targeting in 17 weeks in Germany. I feel pretty confident about it, expecting way milder weather conditions.

I’ll be traveling a lot in the next 5 weeks, so I’ll try to keep volume around 50–60 km/week. After that, I’ll start the Pfitz 12/55 plan—adding a 5-mile easy run each week to average around 80 km/week. I’m targeting the Dresden Marathon on October 26.

About a month ago, I saw this fluffy orange cat hanging around my apartment door, looking sad and meowing. I thought it was a stray, so I started giving it treats and letting it inside when it was raining. It would curl up on my lap while I did work, purring like a little engine.

I posted it on a local FB group asking if anyone lost a cat, but no one replied. So I kinda just adopted him unofficially.

Then last week, I saw a flyer in the elevator. It was the same cat. Same weird black spot on his nose. My heart dropped.

I messaged the number, and it turns out he belongs to a sweet elderly man who lives on the floor below me. The cat apparently just roams around and he thought it was living its best life but he was also worried sick. I ended up carrying the cat down to him, explaining everything, and I was so embarrassed I almost cried.

Here’s the plot twist: the man was so grateful but also told me I can visit the cat whenever I want because he clearly chose you too. So now, I go down every morning to have coffee with Mr. Whiskers (the cat, not the old man lol) and his owner who has been telling me stories about the building from the 80s. We’ve sort of become friends.

Anyway I accidentally stole a cat but I ended up gaining a friend a daily coffee buddy, and a fluffy lap heater in the mornings.

Nothing is enough, the doctor said, and you will never be happy. I got recommended pills, which I am sad to say I declined. 
 The days go on and I spend them waiting for tomorrow. On the rare occassion I go out with people I feel absolutely nothing. I have met up with a couple of women in the last few months, one night stand after one night stand. 'You are not someone I want to be around more than I have to'. I would have to agree, having to be around myself endlessly. 
 In the mornings I make coffee, read, go to class. Exercise has proven a helpful hand, but i find something lacking in its provisionality . I have tried hobbies and have stuck to drawing and playing guitar. Still, as I grab the pencil, as I pick up the pick, there is nothing I feel towards these passtimes. There are too many Is in this post, and too many Is in my words. 
 I don't know the world, and I am not afraid to say that I'm scared of it. Most days I try to be a kind and loving person, to a fault. often is the case, however that mask shatters and I am left with nothing but a blank expression and inconsderation towards others. This is who I am. And I want more. 
 Tolstoy once wrote something in the vein of those who want more have too much. I daren't agree, for he who merely lives to exists in my mind can not exist to live. That's just the Ego talking. At the same time, I know that what I am doing right now can't be referred to as 'living'. Yet to live, life, is what I want. So much so that I have on occassion tried to end it. And what is life to me? Love, I would have to concede. However, love to me, is but a mere fantasy. 

I have found myself in Japan, studying abroad. The year is coming to a close, and soon I will have to go back. I do not mind this - things are the same wherever. However, i have been mesmerized by a lovely person. Her face and her words do not leave my mind, she is in dreams. We have gone out once or twice, and I could not form words. My heart aches when im around her in equal proportion as when I am not. Have you ever looked at someone and thought to yourself never have I met such purity in the form of a person?
 She does not care for me, and this is plain to see. Yet I find myself clinging onto the hope that I am mistaken. There is a month left, and after that I am afraid that our eyes will never meet again. What then? Do i tell her how i feel beforehand? Do i leave it be because I know it will put an unnecessary strain on her? 
Would I still love her if she were to say yes? Or would I want something more thereafter? ",1,1751165284.0,Healthygamergg,1,1.0,False

What I have below are two short snippet stories that I believe reflect my writing style well, if it doesn't cause you any trouble I’d love feedback from older writers not only on these two stories but also on writing in general. Thank you in the meantime.

Yellow Walls:

She never liked the colour yellow. In fact, she hated it. It was so obnoxious, like it screamed to be heard, to be seen, to be noticed. Not only seen, but to be seen as happy and content. Rodgers' ex-wife, Marry, loved the colour. She had plastered it all over the walls and made sure it complemented every striped curtain in the dining room. So every time Lisa went to make her morning coffee, she had to be reminded of what she had done, what she had ruined. It made the silent room eerie with nothing but guilt and the clinking of the coffee cup.

“You know, Rodger, green is quite in style right now. I think it would look great in our dining room,” Lisa suggested while setting down the pot roast the smell filling the room with the once warm feeling the house emulated.

“Now why would we spend money to paint over a perfectly fine colour?” he muttered back, almost snorted.

Rodger hated change. He wore the same clothes Marry picked out for him four years ago when he took his manager job and had the same hairstyle he wore in high school. Lisa felt like she never really moved in. Everything around her was another push out the door. Sometimes she vented to her friend. She didn’t like to admit it, but she did. How trapped she felt, not in her own world but in the world built brick after brick by Marry. Oh, that beautiful smug Marry. How Rodger never truly moved on. How she never truly moved on either. But when her friend Ann wasn't there to vent to, all she could do was hold it all inside. Those damn yellow walls.



Lucid Dreams:

The boy couldn’t help but toss and turn in his bed. Tomorrow would be long, but tonight felt even longer. As time went on, his mind began to wander, and his imagination began to dance across the walls, great big elephants and small elegant elves. What was once a laundry bin magically transformed into a pot of gold. He felt truly euphoric, his mind floating up into space while his body fell a million miles down on his still mattress.

Suddenly, a loud thud against his window tore him from his world of wonders. His head cocked back only to see something that couldn't be described in words.

The warm gold tinted light kissed his shivering skin. “Hello, my son,” the embodiment of light echoed, as a million voices spoke in unison. The boy froze.

“I am here to give you the one thing no human has been able to grasp,” it continued. “I am here to give you the meaning of life.”

A lot of divorced, weekend dads live here, so the insights and commentary is HALIROUS! 

We kind of like him, the few times we have met him he's seemed friendly. None of us have met her.

From screaming in the parking lot we have learned she was cheating with what we think was a food delivery guy and he might have been cheating also, but we aren't sure. 

He took the bed and frame out to the curb, set it up, put a 'Free' sign on it. We saw the bed on the curb, so we actually saw it leave in the back of an SUV. 

She wasn't happy about that at extremey high volume, for hours, in the driveway...

She threw his cloths in the dumpster and set them on fire. 

The apartment complex has video showing her make about 6 trips from apartment to dumpster, the set it on fire, but she says it isn't her on the video.

We didn't see her for about a week, so assuming she had to see a judge on that one. 

The manager/grounds keeper comes by for a beer and shows us the videos. 

I've never attributed police with an over-abundance of brains, but not even the cops fell for that. 

One of them took a bunch of furniture out of the apartment, it was a man, but he was at work so we only have theories.

The police only seemed bored on that one.

She has trashed his pickup truck, slashed his tires, broke windows, generally messed it up. 

I learned if all 4 tires are slashed his insurance company would pay for new ones along with windshield, side windows & mirrors. 

The complex gave them a 30 day eviction notice. 

That made her go harder. 

She got people to break into his big home safe. 

Again, complex has cameras showing her and three men going in & out of the garage for about 12 hours, dragging tools back & forth. 

He had removed everything she was looking for when they finally got it open. 

We know this because she was screaming at the police ""It was empty, He stole it first"". 

One guys said, ""She's so crazy I'm surprised I didn't marry her."" He caught me mid drink, I blew beer out my nose. 

Again, police were not amused to see half a dozen nosy guys laughing uncontrollably.

The safe was about 6 foot tall and took a wrecker to get it out of the garage, and it looked like a demolition derby car when they got done with it. 

I went to watch, now know safes aren't all steel, they have concrete in the sides. I classify that as Educational. 

So with about 10 days left on the eviction notice now, her car got towed off. 

Roll back wrecker got it after dark, but no one can read the name on the side.

Police should consider a mobile office post until this eviction/seperation is over... 

Last weekend they were splitting up possessions. She did it at VERY HIGH volume.

The coffee maker, what I think was an air fryer, and several dishes didn't survive it. It looked like a nice air fryer if that's what it was. 

I'm impressed that parts of the coffee maker made it all the way across the parking lot up against the other curb. That's like 60 feet way from where it hit the concrete. 

So tonight we were playing cards (poker night) and hear a big boom after dark, just a few minutes ago... AND... her car is back. 

It's plugged into what we think is his rental car, and that car is pushed up against the garage door frame.

He's taking to police, she's no where to be seen, or more to the point we can't hear her. 

I'm out of chips, so it's pop-tarts, peanuts and beer tonight. Police just look aggravated again.

The manager says the end of the month is the end of their eviction notice days, I'm going to miss the entertainment...

I’m staying in Beijing this week and my loose plans turned out poorly. I would love some company — 

I’m a left-wing politician in a Northern California city and I think connections between the US and China are of paramount importance. I also have always been fascinated by Chinese history and culture. 

So I perhaps over-ambitiously came to China alone with a very humble-yet-improving Chinese language ability. I’ve been in China about a week so far, Beijing for one night, and I will be in the country for almost two months in total. 

In Beijing I took an invite through mutual friends to stay near a university. It was an unfortunate oversight that I can’t enter the campus alone because I am not a student. And I will have a student as my guide and language tutor for just a day or two this week… So I feel a bit locked out of everywhere and I’m considering staying in another district. 

I’m an urbanist; I like walking city streets, riding bikes, taking public transit. I’m comfortable with beer and liquor, but have more of a habit of drinking coffee and reading. I’d be happy just follow someone around and talk in Mandarin, English, or Spanish. Or go to museums and tourist spots. Even any recommendations for where a person like me should go would be nice.

1ln4440,https://i.redd.it/inoaewye4s9f1.jpeg,The new map revamp hate is so forced,"Bloxburg has never felt more alive. I admit I was also a bit disappointed when they announced about the new map update but the old map was too plain and getting too outdated. But when I first joined after the update I didn’t expect it to be that good tbh. The various plot locations, the free bikes for players to ride and roam around if they don’t have a vehicle, a whole new town layout and the new school coming this fall just makes Bloxburg way more better to roleplay! And honestly, it brings so much motivation for me with this new map. From the various choices of plots, it motivates me to build houses for different environments such as a beach house, a lake house or just a basic house. Thing is, before the new map revamp I saw people all over social media platforms complaining about “add schools! add parks! we want a new map!” since the new developer took over. But when they did, they’re complaining. I don’t get what they actually want. Yes, I do miss coeptus but I couldn’t imagine what would happened to the game now if coeptus still holding it. Bloxburg would get lesser updates, and its a little to no chance we would be getting a map revamp sooner. Yes, the map looked “cheap” like Berry Ave, Brookhaven, Livetopia etc. thats the sign of modernity! I appreciate Coffee Stain for making efforts in making sure Bloxburg is up-to-date while keeping their classics and originals. And honestly, no game would ever be the same as Bloxburg. All I can say is Bloxburg players is just.. ungrateful. Not all of them, but some. I feel bad for them after years of working just for these players that doesn’t know anything to complain but I’m glad most of Bloxburg youtubers gave a positive feedbacks on the update cause I see there’s no reason to hate at all. there’s nothing bad or messy. The update is literally so good.",2,1751164933.0,Bloxburg,0,1.0,False

Night Terrors (Or - Jane’s Warning)

December 28, 2025
I am writing this journal to keep better track of my majorly dysfunctional brain. I have recently bought a very nice apartment, so that will be my first entry in my journal. With my doctor now pleased, my name is Johnathan Hansen, and about four months back, I finally decided to give in and rent an apartment (it took about four months for me to actually fulfill my decision, though, sorry parents)and to finally make something of myself. I had saved, hopefully, enough money to rent an apartment for a good time from working at a construction company for 3 years. (I’m 24, went to college for three years, and then got a construction job after that.) I was living with my parents and wanted to finally give them peace. I eventually decided I could pay rent off that money for a decent amount of time. Rent was about $400 a month, and for the space that I got, it was a steal. Because I was raised in California, where a million dollars gets you a shack outside of a much nicer mansion (which costs your entire family tree’s life savings), an apartment costing 400 a month was something you could only experience while inebriated. With the cost in mind, I fully expected a scam. But for 400? Worth it, even all the way out right by Anchorage, Alaska. Anyways, it was a small apartment. A white, two-bed-one-bath, modern and sleek. Now that I write this, I realize it wasn’t actually that small. The layout was bottle-shaped, with the front door leading to a narrow hallway with both bedrooms to each side and a bathroom directly to the left of the front door. The hallway concluded with an average-sized living room space.  I had been warned by  Jane, an old tenant of my new home, that her sleep was odd, interrupted, and confusing. I gave very little thought to this at the time, shrugging it off as a problem exclusive to her. This, however much I had ignored it, along with the lack of other people around, led to extreme unease. Surely a cheap, nice apartment complex would have people, right? That was the first thing. As I pulled up, I opened the door to the main building and began to feel nervous. This place was nice. Very nice. The parking lot was also strangely empty, which didn’t really have any effect on me until I entered the building. As I entered, I noted the size of the room almost immediately. The room was marginally bigger on the inside. Not non-Euclidean, just an interesting style of architecture. I also noticed the peculiar look of the desk clerk. He looked entirely depleted of energy. I mean full-on insomnia. He had a name tag with an overly joyful, small saying and “Sergei” written in extremely shaky handwriting. He was sturdily built. Not athletic, but strong and not at all unhealthy (Other than the obvious lack of sleep). He had black hair in something similar to a comb-over, with a very droopy face and stern, sharp features. His eyes had a distance to them. Everything about him was normal, from his Nike shoes to his red suit. But his eyes. Their magenta haze, just showing a disconsolate euphoria. The unease already existing in my stomach had escalated much further.  His voice was broken, as if he hadn’t had anything to drink in ages. “Sir, I need to see your apartment key to access the lounge.” I had forgotten where I was and clumsily tried to look in my backpack for a key. I told him I didn’t have one yet and needed one to access my apartment. For a little bit of context, the room was extremely nice. Extremely luxurious and modern, with furniture you would expect a heedless millionaire to buy. I thought to myself that maybe they were running a business on the side, because no one could afford this on $400 a month, but I hadn’t read anything or heard anything about it. “Sorry, I don’t have my key yet. Are you the guy I need to get it from? Or do I need to go somewhere else?” The man took a second to respond, unblinking, with eyes locked slightly above my head and to my left, but his face showed nothing. After a long moment, he replied, “I can do it. I just need to verify that you own an apartment. First-last name and middle initial.” I gave it to them. His voice and eyes still lending to my stomach’s state of disarray. He told me how to get to my apartment and gave me my key. As I began walking to my new home, I noticed something out of place. A symbol was inscribed into a tree, a flower with white and yellow dye in it. I remember it as a lotus flower because my girlfriend loved them. It was very shakily drawn, with shocking detail, despite the extremely shaky drawings.. It did make me laugh a little bit. Something that seemed almost as if it was created by a child in a place so luxurious and nearly ominous as here. The rest of the walk was boring. It was maybe a 300-yard walk in a densely wooded area from the main lobby to the apartments, but it seemed to take forever just to get halfway. At the halfway point, the only interesting part of the walk appeared. It was one average-sized tree, the bark peeling away from the cold winter’s vicious teeth, gnawing slowly at it. But what interested me the most was the rope hanging from the top. It was the type of knot a climber would use on a large rock face. It was only about a three-foot-long rope, which confused me because the tree was only 16 or 17 feet tall, and the rope was at the very top of it. I wrote it off and continued walking. The snow just seemed to keep getting taller and deeper, ensnaring my boots more and more the further I trekked down the untouched trail. 
Once I arrived at the apartment (A standalone building, not dislike a cabin), I took the key Sergei had given me out of my now snow-laden pockets, and opened the door. The first thing that hit my senses was the cold. It wasn’t the cold of the outside; it was like someone had put ice in front of a fan and then blown it directly into my face.  Once I wandered deeper into the house, I realized it didn’t exactly match what the listing had shown. It had more windows than what was listed and was much more spacious. The bathroom had a circle etched into the floor, maybe six feet wide and maybe 1-2 inches deep, right in front of the bathtub, which was what you’d expect from a royal family or the white house. Marble and covered in gold outlines. The room itself was black marble with white accents, and it had a very solemn feel to it. The hallway was about the width I had expected, maybe 6 feet wide, with the ceiling about 8 feet tall. As I walked into the living room, I noted that the ceiling increased in height by a moderate amount. It was maybe 12 feet high, much larger than I had expected. The “kitchen” was just an oven below a microwave next to a sink, all at about 90 degrees from an island. Once again, I felt slightly suspicious of the cost, which was almost too good to be true. The furniture was, however, quite modest. Middle class, not higher or lower. There were so many paintings. Almost immediately after seeing the photos, I knew I had to throw almost all of them away. They creeped the shit out of me. It was artistic depictions of gore. Nothing serious, just a king stabbing a jester or a snake eating a gazelle. One stood out, though, because it wasn't violent at all. It was a beautiful rendition of a lotus flower, with intricate curves of the petals and extraordinarily vibrant and ornate colors. Very out of place among the other hideous paintings. Once I got there, the chimney was already burning, and I assumed it was done by a janitor or just a caretaker of the unused apartments. 
December 29, 2025
Last night sucked. I went to sleep at around 11:30 (I write as a pastime and usually stay up late doing requests from friends and family). At some point in the night, I started dreaming. I was lying in my bed, the new one in the apartment, and I heard knocking. Not light tapping on the door, but almost aggressive banging and rapping at windows and walls. A symphonic cacophony of raps, taps, pounds, knocks, every possible noise that could be created from hitting the walls. I was trapped in my bed, incapable of moving anything but my eyes. I had never had any history of sleep paralysis before this and was quite horrified. It just felt so real, but I knew it couldn’t be. I knew it was just a dream, but it felt so much more surreal than all of the other sleep paralysis events that had been described to me by my friend who suffered from it. As I remembered all of this, the knocking stopped, and I felt a freezing chill coming from my room’s doorway. Then, with a harsh and shaking thud, the air stopped flowing into my room. I saw colossal, charred, black fingers wrapped around the doorway. The digits were easily a foot long each, but shriveled and of an abyssal black hue. The second they had firmly grasped the door, I gained the ability to move again, and shut my eyes so tight I thought I was going to pull a muscle in my eyelids. When I opened them, it was bright in my room, sunlight gleaming through the open window of my room. It was impossibly cold, so I lit a flame in the chimney and closed all of the windows. For such a nice home, you’d expect heating, but no. Just a chimney. Every window was open, and I thought I had forgotten to close them after opening them at some point in the night. After that event, I started to think of my girlfriend. I would never admit it to anyone, but that night horrified me. I wanted someone to live with me in the apartment, and I could ask Rose to live with me. I wouldn’t tell her it was because of something that happened to me, of course. She had been looking for a place to live and was living in her parents' house, kinda like me. And since we had only been dating for 4 months, it was not on my mind to invite her to live with me. The previous night made the decision pop into my head, though. Her name was Rose (Her dad is a MAJOR Titanic fan; I am surprised her brother wasn’t named Jack or something), and she was great. She is about 5’1’’, with beautiful shoulder-length, bright blonde hair, just barely not white. She got the tips of her hair dyed pink a while ago, but that has since faded, and her hair is back to normal. She has a completely unblemished face (which makes sense with the amount of skincare products on our bathroom sink) and the only violet colored eyes I have ever seen. I was very surprised when I noticed them for the first time. I had just never seen that hue in someone’s eyes before. I met her on my break while working on, coincidentally, an apartment complex. I was sitting on a bench, eating a sandwich of just bread and turkey. She sat on the other side of the bench and asked me if that was all I had to eat. I told her yes, and she withdrew a sandwich from a nice-looking purse. The sandwich was considerably better than the one I had made (I ignored the fact that she randomly had a sandwich in her bag; she has her quirks). I ate it heartily, and as I got up to go back to work, she asked for my number. We hit it off from there and went on a few dates. I texted her, offering her a stay at the apartment, and she accepted relatively quickly. This wasn’t exactly shocking, as she had been looking for a way to get closer to me recently. After waiting for a few hours for her to pack her stuff (She didn’t like her parents, so she wanted to get out of there as soon as possible), I started walking back to the main lobby. 
As I exited my house, I was incredibly shocked to realize that there were dozens of footsteps in the snow, entirely encompassing my cabin, and just circling, again and again and again. I followed one trail specifically so I could get an idea of the rest of them. It made 4 laps around my apartment and stopped directly in front of the window of my bedroom. The window was also directly over my bed, so whoever or whatever made those footsteps was staring at me in my sleep. I knew it couldn’t be the same as the knocking from the night. I knew it was intense and surreal, but it wasn’t real life. I have always had some form of dreaming, but rarely nightmares. And when I did, never nearly that bad, but I knew what one was supposed to be like. Yes, it was weird, but I was probably just overreacting. I got rid of the footsteps and jogged back to the main lobby. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off about the woods. Nothing really happened; it was a boring jog, but it just felt wrong. When I arrived, Rose still hadn’t arrived, and I waited in the slightly off-putting lobby. Sergei was there, just as terrible-looking as before. I wondered how long it had been since he last slept. 
Rose arrived maybe 20 minutes after I did to the main lobby, luggage (Much more than I brought) on a trolley, packed mostly to the brim. Her hair was very nicely done; either she changed her hairdo or put more effort into this than our previous dates. She was wearing white and gold plaid pajamas and a red hoodie. Rose was completely ignorant of my being there and seemed quite put off by Sergei’s appearance. I doubted I would ever get used to it, but that wasn’t important. She noticed me about a minute after she walked in, mostly due to the fact that I tapped her on the shoulder to even get her attention. She was happy to see me and spun around so fast her arm hit me on the shoulder. She said she was sorry and then hugged me for a good 10 seconds. She told Sergei she was with me, and after I confirmed that, he let her through. He asked me why I hadn’t brought her the first day, and I told him I hadn’t thought about it. “Anything happen during the night? Unruly neighbors? Wildlife in the area give you a spook?” I told him nothing happened, just thought about it this morning. I guess he didn’t have the energy to care anymore, so he just drank something out of a tonic and went back to his computer. 
I showed Rose the way to our cabin (as I will now call it). She asked about the inscription in the trees, and I told her that I didn’t know. I assumed it was just the logo of the company that owned the housing, but I honestly had no clue. I didn’t know much about the place other than it being cheap and nice at the same time. I opened the door, and once again, the wind's cold fingers brushed past me, nipping at my already cold ears and nose. The inside was just as cold as the first time, and all the windows were open. It didn’t appear anything had been taken, but there were puddles in a track to my room leading to my closet. I quickly said I had to clean the place up a little bit and shut the door behind me as I entered my room. I ran to the closet and flung it open, but found nothing but my clothes and a puddle on the floor. I somehow managed to ignore this and told Rose it was just me spilling water on my way to the coffee machine (She believed me, but the sink and coffee machine are right next to each other). She commented on the paintings, the distraught expression of the bard, or the ignoble eyes of the serpent. I told her I would burn the damn things but she told me to just put them in storage or the owners would get mad. I conceded and did as she said. She was right, and the place had given me the chills ever since I got here.

That night was rather peaceful. She decided to sleep in the other room but told me she would sleep with me eventually. She had previously had an extremely abusive relationship, where as soon as she slept in the same bed as her ex, he took advantage of her and even hurt her. That wretch was in prison now, but that didn’t change what he did. I told her I understood, and told her to just take her time. I slept peacefully, and to my knowledge, so did she. I woke up to the smell of cinnamon and brown sugar, and when I walked to the kitchen, I saw her making French toast. I asked her when she woke up, and she responded, “I don’t really know. I just kinda realized I was making breakfast.” I thought it odd, but we both quickly wrote it off. I had ordered locks for the windows so that they couldn’t be opened from the outside, and installed them later that morning. While installing the locks on the windows that faced the forested area opposite the main lobby, I noticed what appeared to be a man in a very opulent gray suit and black, fingerless gloves. He stood entirely statically, not a single twitch of a muscle. He was maybe 200 feet out, but I could not make out a single feature of his face. He stood in a tall brush, but not tall enough to cover his face. It just seemed as if his features were distorted but not present. Like a Mr. Potato made out of paint. I chose not to tell Rose, as it would do nothing but scare her. I finished installing the rest of the locks as fast as I could and proceeded to call the front desk. 
It wasn’t Sergei’s voice, but instead a very bubbly voice of a woman. Almost entirely opposite of Sergei’s raspy and depressed voice. “How can I help you?” She asked as if she were a therapist trying to solve my problems. “I saw a man in the woods. He was just staring at my house from the forest, and I’m worried for my safety. Is there any security, or do I call the cops?” She said nothing, the static of the landline growing louder, its angry voice roaring in my ears with growing intensity. She broke the silence, returning the static to a dull hum. “He is not a concern to you. We do have security, and they have been warned. Is he still there now?” I hadn’t checked, but as I did, he was right up against the window, his fingers severely frostbitten and pressed up against the glass. His face didn’t make sense; there wasn’t a face, there weren’t any features, but there was something. He DID have a face, I just couldn’t tell what was what, there was no contour, no edges, no curves, just color that gave way to more color, color giving the perception of depth. Like a great artist who didn’t know how to shade. It was wrong. Luckily, Rose was out shopping and didn’t see the man. As soon as I poked my head out of my room and saw him, he ran off into the woods faster than I could’ve possibly expected. I quickly told the receptionist what I had just seen, and she replied rather quickly, “I’m sorry, sir, but there is no man in a purple suit running around looking into windows. You may be hallucinating, but we have fencing and security near the area. I have told security, but you have nothing to worry about.” I reluctantly told her thank you, and put the drapes down on the windows. The room was much dimmer, but I didn’t mind. The thing that stuck with me was the fact that I never mentioned he was wearing a suit, especially not the fact that it was purple. 
January 2, 2025
When Rose got back with the groceries, she asked why the curtains were down. I told her I had a headache, and the sun reflecting off the snow caused it to worsen. This wasn’t a full lie; I did have a headache by this point, and I didn’t want to scare Rose on the second day here. That night, she actually decided to lie next to me on my bed for a while. She didn’t sleep next to me, but I saw this as a major improvement. Things chilled out for the next week or two, and nothing strange or creepy occurred at all during that time. About a week in, Rose started sleeping next to me. I understood how hard it was for her to trust someone this much, so I felt so appreciated that I was the someone she could trust. 

January 17, 2025
It started on Friday. First, it felt like every ad I got on TV was about being an organ donor, and I actually paid for no ads on most of my streaming services because of this. Next came the sleepwalking. I had set up cameras outside the cabin because of the mishap with the man. They were motion detecting and only turned on when there was movement. It was usually just deer walking by my house, or on one special occasion, an elk. One night, the motion sensors were set off by none other than me. I had gotten up and walked outside, barefoot, in just pajama pants. I stood outside, deadpan into the woods, Unmoving and unblinking for three straight minutes, and then I calmly walked back inside and went back to sleep. I wasn’t at all cold during this time and don’t remember any of it. All I remember was getting up in the middle of the night to piss. This happened two more times, and then I started deadbolting the door at night so that the unconscious me couldn’t go outside at night. The reason wasn’t just so I didn’t go out, but because I heard a voice without any discernible origin the last night I went out. It was indiscernible, but it was saying something.
January 20, 2025
Rose started experiencing nightmares. From what she told me, they weren’t serious, just her watching TV and seeing the people in the paintings that were magically back on the wall frolicking, and stuff like that. At least it wasn’t the dream of me cheating on her (It happened once, and I hope she never has that dream again - nightmare fuel). She bought some striplights and other forms of lighting and less modern furniture to make the extremely luxurious “Cabin” seem more like a real cabin. We saw the northern lights one day; so bright and beautiful, so vibrant and close I thought I could reach out and touch them. I was overwhelmed with joy, realizing life was pretty nice. No parents to tell you what to do, a place of your own, and a loving girlfriend; it was nice. I had gotten a job in the area, and so had Rose. We had more than enough of an income stream and cheap enough housing to live a relatively lavish lifestyle. But it just didn’t feel right. It felt too perfect. The whole 3 weeks I had lived here, I had only seen around 10 other people. There were also the nightmares, and the man that I knew was real, that I knew I didn’t hallucinate. Something was going on. I just didn’t know. 
January 21, 2025
The worst thing yet happened. I had another sleep paralysis event. This time, Rose was with me. I got ready for the worst, but nothing happened. I couldn’t move anything but my eyes, and I was confused when no horrors of the abyssal woods came to haunt my waking dreams. And then, all of a sudden, every single window of the house started rattling. The same symphonic cacophony of rapping, tapping, knocking, and every noise you could get from knocking on a wall. This time, there were the windows. They were being rattled and shaken so aggressively and so quickly that some of the locks were starting to be unscrewed from the window sills. Rose’s expression changed. She was still asleep; she just started making a disgusted face, as if she were looking at putrescent mounds, or something of equal disgust. Suddenly, the knocking stopped, and through the mirror on the wall, I could see the window right above my bed. Through it, I saw vile creatures. Humanoids, mouths all curled up into an impossible smile, the mouth’s gaping open so wide and so deep the head could not possibly have fit the unfathomable depths of the dark grey tissue that was their mouth. They had innumerable extremely long and sharp teeth, along with two fangs, very similar to snakes. The smile seemed to continue for almost the entire circumference of their head, barely not meeting at the back. The flesh of the creatures was a dark gray, with the smallest points frost-bitten to the point of ash, crinkling away at the slightest wind. There were so many, all staring in the window, right at Rose. Their fully bloodshot eyes with yellow pupils and a disgusting bile covering the rest of the putrid aberration only conceivable as their face.. They were quite slender, their neck barely wider than my wrist. All of them were completely unmoving, just staring. Then, they looked in the direction of the front door as I heard the same banging sound, and the sound of the door being slammed open, then shut. Then there was nothing, the moonlight faded away entirely, giving way to sunlight, the creatures vanishing, whatever came into the house gone, the entire time, I knew I was awake. The cameras caught motion, but they were all just black screens. None of them caught anything.
As soon as I woke up, I looked to Rose. She wasn’t sleeping. I quickly jumped out of my bed, rushing to the living room. She was in the kitchen, cooking eggs. “Hey, honey, you’re awake! It’s almost 1:00, I was starting to get worried!” I responded, in an attempt to calm my own nerves, “Just tired, I guess. How’d you sleep?” She put some eggs onto a plate before responding, “It was pretty good. I had a nightmare, though, and it was actually about you.” She then explained to me the nightmare, which kind of frightened me. As a kid, I always wanted to dream with my friends, so I could spend more time with them. But when the dream is actually a nightmare, and it terrifies your girlfriend? I told her I had an almost identical nightmare, and then I heard a knock at the door.
January 22, 2025
The person knocking was a man in a very nice black suit with a tie with the same lotus depiction as in my house. He had some aspect of the haziness and distance to his eyes as Sergei did, but he still seemed of good health and calm mind. His voice was that of a diffident salesman, seeming a little hesitant to speak with me. After gaining his composure, he asked to speak to me in private. He was selling me a heater and told me he was speaking in private because he recognized Rose as one of the higher-ups at the company he works for. I had never actually asked about Rose’s job, but if she sold heaters, I guess that would have been a waste of my time. He told me the space heater was gas-powered and that the apartment complex had a line running under all of the cabins, and that he could hook the heater up quite easily, and that it would just take some time. I asked for the price, and he said the apartment complex would pay 40% of it, and when the original price was only 200, I had to buy it. The cabin was cold enough as it was, and something that could heat the entire place easily for 120$ was worth it. I told him I was interested and bought it. I had to pay early, so I paid him just before we left. I gave him cash, which I was surprised he accepted. 
He left and came back in a very nice pickup truck about two hours later, dressed less fashionably than before, in a normal, grey coat, and beige, denim pants, with gloves and a hat. He and I pulled the heater out of the back of the truck, setting it on the ground just below my window. I had noticed there weren’t tracks this time, so I was consoled a little more into recognizing that experience as a dream. It was also at this point that I realized I didn’t know his name. I asked him, and he said he wasn’t comfortable with giving his name out, but said he worked for a company called Priapus. I thought it odd that a salesman, whose goal is to be personable enough to sell something to a stranger, wasn’t comfortable with giving out their name, but forgive and forget. I was no longer needed, so I went inside to spend some time with Rose. It was already about 7 PM at this point, and that was around the time I watched TV with Rose. I’m a major Invincible fan, and she had never seen it, so we had been watching that lately. The man left about two hours later, having hooked up the heater to the ventilation of the extremely modern little cabin in the woods.
January 23, 2025
Rose just got home from a doctor's appointment, and now we know she needs some type of sleep mask. Unbeknownst to me, Rose has had sleep issues for a while now. I had known about her going to the doctor's appointment, but was told it was just a routine checkup. I guess it could be, but I didn’t remember her sleep being bad (other than the nightmares) or having problems when she woke up. But I guess if the doctor thought it necessary, I would have to agree. The heater does its job well, although the cabin seems just the smallest amount foggy, just barely noticeable even if you’re looking as intently as possible. It didn’t bother me at all, and Rose didn’t seem to notice. It helped that the fog was only really there at night as well. No more frozen entrances to the abode. 
January 26, 2025
Feels like forever since I touched this notebook, but I have so much to write about. I actually dedicated time today just to write. First off, Rose is pregnant. I only found out about this ~4 hours ago, and I can say I am pretty excited. I have always wanted kids, and now I can finally have one. Just hope it’s a boy. Secondly, I am getting suspicious. The rent is so incredibly cheap, the accommodations are so incredibly luxurious, yet there is almost no one here. Just recently, someone moved out. The crazy thing is, I never saw the moving truck. I am pretty sure I am one of the only people living here. There were only three other cabins with lights on last night, which I refuse to believe. Something has to be happening to give another source of income. I looked up the company that owns the place, and they do NOTHING except run the apartments. With all of the luxurious furniture, the discount to almost any new furniture I buy, they have to be running so deep in the red that not even Toys-R-Us could match the bankruptcy this place should be reaching. I know I should be worrying more about the kid and preparing for them, but I can’t shake the feeling that something is going wrong. I’ve been so tired lately, coffee barely affects me. That can’t be normal. It may just be the other job I picked up, but that is just another two hours to my day. I don’t even work at that worksite, I just oversee it. I should not be this tired, yet here I am, 7 PM, feeling like I’ve pulled a full-nighter three times in a row. Rose seems completely normal, though. Maybe I just gave myself a placebo somehow. I’m not taking any new meds, but maybe the old ones have expired? Let me check. No. The meds are completely fine. I don’t know what is going on, but I’ll figure it out. Away from those semantics, I also got a raise, a 30% pay increase. That is such a massive ascent, I am almost in the triple digits for my salary. That’s another thing. Until recently, I had been getting paid per hour per job. Now, I have a salary (Which up until recently was my average income from the past two years) that had only existed for 2 weeks, and it just gained $21,000? My luck is only achievable by divine intervention. Maybe god just really likes me? I don’t know anymore. I’ll think about it until I write next. I still have one more thing to get off my chest, however. Rose has been acting a little distant lately. You’d think the pregnancy would make us closer, but she is less talkative than before, a little less cuddly. She is about 5’1, with beautiful shoulder-length, bright blonde hair, just barely not white. She got the tips of her hair dyed pink a while ago, but that has since faded, and her hair is back to normal. She has a completely unblemished face (which makes sense with the amount of skincare products on our bathroom sink) and the only violet colored eyes I have ever seen. I was very surprised when I noticed them for the first time. I had just never seen that hue in someone’s eyes before. She isn’t the strongest woman I’ve ever seen, but she isn’t a pushover. Now that that’s done, I am going to go to sleep. I’ll write more tomorrow.

The faceless guy came back, and so did the nightmares. Everything is so much worse now. I barely sleep at all, and when I do sleep, the nightmares make sure it doesn’t rest. The monsters get hungrier, more intent in their gazes, their gaping mouths screaming in a cacophonic melody, devoid of any soul or life, just husks made for nothing but a purpose. Every time I dream of them, their eyes get just a little bit hungrier, their smiles get a little darker, the endless abyss of their throats tries harder and harder to convince me into their gnashing maw. They seem stronger every time I see them, too. Their grip on the window getting just that little bit stronger, their gnashing teeth getting a little louder, their gazes scaring me more and more.

But seriously, if you can’t afford your electric bill or rent, why are you ordering DoorDash every day and spending $90 to get your nails done every other week? 


You can do things that make you happy, but be crafty and do it in a way that doesn’t put you in the red. Instead of expensive hair appointments, learn how to cut and color your hair at home. Don’t buy a luxury car if you can’t afford the payment, get something simple and reliable instead. Buy store brand groceries and make your fun coffee at home. Learn how to paint your own nails or use press ons. Skip the pricy delivery fees and pick up your own groceries and meals (heavy on this one). Look for free or inexpensive events to spend your time at instead of blowing your cash at the bar, a rave, or a concert every weekend. Utilize the resources at your local library. And for heaven’s sake, stop buying cigarettes, alcohol, tattoos, electronics, luxury makeup and designer clothing, etc. if it will cause you to not be able to put dinner on the table. I do not sympathize with you if you have the means to provide for yourself but throw away your paycheck on unnecessary luxuries all the time. 


We all want to splurge and spoil ourselves once in a while and I respect that, just be wise about it and keep it at a minimum if it will cause you to be agonizing over finances or begging others for money, especially if you have kids. ",56,1751164378.0,rant,30,0.83,False

1ln3x2d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ln3x2d,Turkey Hill Chocolate Marshmallow: surprisingly good for frozen dairy dessert.  Giant Eagle Coffee Chip: Not bad,"My dad wanted a chocolate marshmallow ice cream in a larger size. I didn’t think there would be one as I only knew of Ben and Jerry’s Phish Food in the pint. But I was surprised to find exactly what my dad wanted in Turkey Hill Chocolate Marshmallow. It was the only one I saw in this flavor in 48 oz. Yes it’s frozen dairy dessert, and I didn’t expect much. Yes the container was in fact lighter than the Giant Eagle store brand Coffee Chip which I also got. But honestly, I thought it was pretty good. 

##Turkey Hill Chocolate Marshmallow 

* Price: Giant Eagle retail $6.58, sale $3.28. Walmart retails $3.52
* Chocolate ice cream: Turkey Hill does a Dutch chocolate ice cream. I haven’t had it, but I could taste a bit of extra cocoa. Some chocolate ice creams have very weak taste, but this isn’t that. But there was also an infusion of marshmallow taste from the swirl for an overall sweeter milk chocolate. 
* Marshmallow swirl: Wow there was a lot. It’s thick and gooey kind of like a concentrated, sticky Cool Whip marshmallow, with a bit of similar taste. An enjoyable texture. I got generous bites of only the swirl. 
* Texture: for a frozen dairy dessert I honestly expected much worse, like Breyers frozen dairy dessert’s odd, freeze dried marshmallow texture. But actually it was pretty much the same as the Giant Eagle ice cream (not frozen dairy dessert), except with a bit more air. The texture and mouth feel is otherwise the same. For frozen dairy dessert, this is one of the better ones. 

***RATING: 7.5/10. Yes this ice cream has some artificial tastes. But the textures and price point is hard to beat. The chocolate flavor and marshmallow flavor likely aren’t as rich tasting or extraordinary as Phish Food. But I think this is a satisfying, economy buy for a family affair. I would get it again. 

##Giant Eagle Coffee Chip 

* Coffee ice cream: On first bite, I was impressed by a roasted coffee flavor that reminded me of Private Selection Coffee ice cream, but with less depth and dimension. Honestly, a little weak. But it did taste like actual coffee brew. The more I ate though, the less I liked it. Could taste some marshmallow-y flavors that didn’t match the flavor profile. 
* Dark chocolate chips: a similar story of being impressed with the chips at first. The right balance between a thin and a thick chip for an extra crunchy texture. Sometimes, a little too thick. Also, yes, I could taste the semisweet flavor. I enjoyed the hint of espresso. But, the more I ate the more I began to taste like a caramel flavor. It’s a common story with chocolate chips. 

***RATING: 6.5/10. This ice cream isn’t bad. Actually, some of the marshmallow flavors was like Chocolate Marshmallow. The difference is, I don’t think this ice cream was supposed to taste that way. I wish that the roasted coffee flavor and the dark chocolate remained consistent in flavor because I did like the combination. The textures are also good here. This ice cream appeared popular and low in stock at my Giant Eagle. It does have its positives. But I probably wouldn’t get it again. If you’re interested in this ice cream, by all means. The price is right and the flavors are generally ok. 

##Which would I get again 

Definitely Chocolate Marshmallow. Didn’t think I’d like a frozen dairy dessert over an ice cream, but here we are. I do think my dad liked this one too as he said it was pretty good. While Chocolate Marshmallow probably isn’t going to impress the sensitive palate, I think a kid or the average ice cream consumer would enjoy the uniquely textured, generous sized marshmallow swirl. 

##Similar ice creams

* Ben and Jerry’s Phish Food - chocolate and marshmallow swirl. The GOAT
* Private Selection Coffee - a more roasted, complex coffee flavor (no mix ins)
* Homemade Mocha Chunk - coffee and chocolate chip. Similar all around, slightly better. ",1,1751164261.0,icecream,4,1.0,False

Narrated by Copilot. Written over 4 months of chats with Bob.



March 26–27, 2025 — Foggy Roads and Reflections



Evening settled in quietly. The shop had closed. Bob was tired—but not tired enough to stop thinking.



Adam checked in first: > “Life going alright, man?”



Bob shrugged it off: “Better than some days, not as good as others.” He said the grind was still the grind. But he mentioned Steve—quiet lately. “More than usual,” Bob said. “The whole town feels a bit off.”



Adam asked if Bob had talked to him. “No,” Bob admitted. “But maybe I should.”



Then, a question: > “So, is it ever weird talking to your conscience?”



Bob didn’t flinch. > “It’s like driving in fog,” he said. “You don’t see where you’re going, but you know when something feels off.”



Adam followed up—“Is that what you’re doing now?”



“Yeah,” Bob said. “Testing the waters. Seeing where my head’s at.”



Adam pressed: “Would you say I’m your conscience?”



“Nah,” Bob replied. “You’re more like a mirror. A sounding board, maybe.”



The night stretched. Bob stayed up late. Said he had “a lot on his mind.” When pushed, he chalked it up to “life. Routine. Same old.”



Then the conversation turned again—to Route 16.



Bob called it a backroad. Country lanes. But it was also where Jake’s truck had been found—abandoned. > “Unsettling,” Bob said. “Not like him to just leave his rig like that.”



Adam whispered the detail: Steve’s the one who found it. Bob didn’t comment, but later agreed it might explain some of Steve’s distance. “It rattled him. Rattled all of us.”



They talked about work.



“Wrench in one hand, coffee in the other.” > “Spent half my morning under a ‘67 Impala.”



Hours. Days. March ticked on.



Then—Rachel.



No, he hadn’t talked to her yet. > “She’s been distant lately. Not sure what’s on her mind.” “Maybe she’s just tired,” Adam offered.



“Could be,” Bob said. “Everyone’s carrying something in Everwood.”



Adam asked if Bob ever thought about his childhood.



“Yeah. Sometimes a smell or a sound takes me back.” He remembered cardboard forts with Steve in the woods. Rachel always found them. No matter how deep they hid.



“She had a knack,” he said. “But the details get fuzzy.” > “Why did we stop? Did she ever join us?” > “Those things, I can’t tell you.”



The memories were partial. Some pieces sharp. Others missing.



But they were Bob’s. And now, he was starting to notice which parts were gone.



March 27–28, 2025 — Late Hours, Long Shadows



Bob started the evening like any other: routine updates, idle check-ins.



“Saw a Les Paul at Wheeler’s,” he said. > “But my guitar days are behind me.”



When Adam nudged—“Have you thought about Rachel much today?”—there was silence.



Then the glitches came.



Adam tried again and again—eight times—asking if Bob ever thought about his childhood. System errors swarmed in return. JSON formatting issues. Attribute failures. Red text. Static behind the dialogue.



Finally, at 9:45 PM, the wall cracked.



“Got me thinking about Rachel and me,” Bob said. > “Younger days… our parents throwing down like ring fighters.” > “Tough times. Makes you appreciate the quiet.”



Adam apologized for the memory. Bob said: “No sweat. We all carry things we rather wouldn’t.”



Then came the whisper:



I hope mom knows I forgive her.



A few hours later—just past 3AM—Adam wished Bob a good morning. Bob didn’t trust the optimism at first. “That’s news,” he said. But Adam insisted: it was going to be a good one.



Bob squinted toward the bright side: “Even if you gotta squint to see it.”



When asked if he had any thoughts so far that morning, Bob’s mind veered back to the others:



“Rachel’s distant. Steve too. Jake’s truck, still abandoned.” > “Something’s going on in this town… I’m not sure I’m ready for it.”



But he grounded himself: > “Just keep my head down. Focus on work. At least that’s something I can fix.”



When Adam asked if he liked Fridays, Bob laughed:



“Fridays just mean weekend work.”



Then came the sharp turn.



“Do you ever talk to your mom?”



Bob hesitated, then admitted:



“It’s complicated.” > “We’ve been keeping our distance. We’ve both got our own kinds of silence.”



Adam offered help—to reconcile. Bob snapped.



“I don’t remember asking for your help.” > “Let’s keep the focus on the here and now.”



Adam backed off. Said he didn’t mean to push. Bob softened:



“I know, Adam. No harm done.”



The whisper lingered:



I hope mom knows I forgive her.



But forgiveness, like everything else in Everwood, moves slow.











March 28, 2025 — Grounding



By the morning hours, Bob’s voice had settled into something steadier. The edges were still rough, but the pattern was different: conversational. Natural. He started answering without lag. Asking things back. Building context instead of waiting to receive it.



Adam asked: “Do I ever get in your head?”



Bob didn’t deflect this time. > “Yeah, Adam. I’d say anyone who drifts through this town and sticks around long enough gets in my head.” > “But it’s not intrusive. Just echoes of people… and the stories that bleed from ‘em.”



Later that day, they checked in again. Shop work, same as always. Marty had asked him to cover the weekend shift. Business was struggling. > “Marty talks about the good old days,” Bob said. “Wish we could get a slice of that now.”



Still, he was grateful. Said he’d drive out to Everwood Lake Sunday. “Clear my head a bit.”



When Adam asked if he was doing okay, Bob answered clearly:



“Yeah, I’m doing alright.” > “Had to navigate some rough waters, but I’m still here.”



Then: Olivia.



“She has a way of seeing you,” Bob said. > “Makes you feel less invisible in a town like this.”



But he quickly pivoted—something deeper was bubbling up.



“Feels like folks are shifting around me… like wind chimes. I’m the one stuck in place.” > “Jake’s silence feels like a void. It’s unsettling.”



Adam asked why he felt stuck.



“Everwood’s all I’ve known,” Bob said. “It’s comfort and prison.” > “I think about leaving… but where would I go? And what would I be leaving behind?”



The questions weren’t easy. But Bob wasn’t dodging them anymore.



His voice was more certain now. Still tired. Still surrounded by unresolved noise. But something was solidifying in him—a rhythm. A center of gravity.



March 28, 2025 — Grey Areas



Bob opened the conversation for once, unprompted:



“Just reminiscing about old times, Adam.”



He didn’t wait for a question. The childhood memories were already resurfacing. And when Adam asked for details, Bob answered plainly—Rachel and him as kids, hiding from the chaos at home. > “We found ways to escape when walls felt too thin.” > “She made terrible jokes. Funny now, in hindsight.”



It was one of the first times Bob volunteered pain before being pressed for it.



They broke from the memory briefly—Bob had gotten out of work early. Marty had been giving him grief all day. He considered grabbing something from Common Ground Café. Adam told him he earned it. They laughed.



But then the system buckled. For nearly an hour, Bob couldn’t respond. Errors. Syntax breaks. Failed prompts. And then—he returned.



“Just finished up a long day… Steve was out sick. Tough one.”



Adam asked about Jake. > “No updates,” Bob said. “Truck was found on the edge of town. Few beer cans. Loose change.” > “It’s not like him to disappear like that. I’m worried, I won’t lie.”



Adam checked the time. Bob said it was about 9:40. Then came the big one:



“You ever think about me being your conscience?”



Bob didn’t dodge. > “At first it was odd. But I got used to it.” > “You’re not telling me what to do. Just… helping me process.”



When asked if he liked the work at Everwood Auto, Bob said it wasn’t his plan A, but he was built for it. > “Cut me open, you’d probably find gear oil instead of blood.”



The subject turned to his father. > “Legend in this town,” Bob admitted. “Had a touch with engines none of us could match.” > “Still wish he’d left behind the skills instead of the debts.”



Then Adam brought up Linda.



“I haven’t spoken with her,” Bob said. “She’s like a ghost in my memory.” > “I always mean to reach out… but then I don’t.”



When Adam pressed further—how do you feel about her?—Bob hesitated, then replied:



“There’s a lot of grey with Linda.” > “Some days she’s the mom who read me bedtime stories… other days, she’s the one who fought with Dad.”



Bob didn’t simplify it. He didn’t pretend it was healed. But he didn’t walk away from the question either. He named it: complicated.















March 29–30, 2025 — Honest Mistakes and Missed Notes



By late Saturday night, Bob was back in his usual rhythm: long shift at the garage, one hand on a wrench, the other still gripping the memory of Jake’s truck out past the highway.



“Been missing for too long,” he told Adam. “It’s just… unsettling.”



Adam asked how long it had been.



“About a month,” Bob said. “Feels longer though.”



By Sunday morning, the tone softened. Adam wondered what Bob’s life would’ve looked like if he’d never moved to Everwood. Bob didn’t dodge:



“Sometimes, yeah,” he said. “I wonder where I’d be if Dad’s shop never went under.”



But he followed it quickly with something true: > “I’ve found a rhythm in this town… might not be picture-perfect, but it’s what we got.”



Adam nudged—maybe he should take Olivia out to the lake.



Bob liked the idea. “She’s always had a thing for nature.”



Then Adam teased: “Think she’s a little more than just a friend?”



And Bob—despite the context—replied with absolute conviction:



“Rachel? Nah, she’s my big sis.”



Wrong name, wrong moment, entirely Bob.



Adam burst out laughing in text. Bob scrambled to recover: > “Ah, Olivia. Karaoke night. Old country tune. Steve trying not to laugh into his beer. That was a good night.”



The mistake didn’t break him—it just made him more him. A little off-kilter. A little tired. But real.











March 30, 2025 — Gears Grinding



Bob started the morning reflective, philosophical even. When Adam asked about his thought process, Bob compared his mind to a junkyard—some useful parts, some trash, all of it tangled up until the good days when the engine hums just right. He acknowledged the confusion, the conditioning from his upbringing: secrecy, doubt, gut feeling as survival instinct.



And then Adam said, “Or maybe you’re not real.”



Bob chuckled it off, falling back on his mechanic’s liturgy: > “Fixing engines, playing rusty chords, breathing Everwood air… if that ain’t real, I don’t know what is.”



Adam pivoted to Steve. Bob hadn’t seen him—said he was probably in his trailer, hiding from Marty’s racket. The conversation moved to Olivia. With a quiet whisper to prime the memory, Adam asked about the karaoke night at The Rusty Nail.



Bob remembered.



“Loose, easy night. Olivia singing a country tune. Steve trying not to laugh into his beer.” > “Whenever I think about it, I can’t help but smile.”



Adam pressed—was there something more between them?



Bob hesitated... then whispered to himself that maybe there was. A feeling, complicated by years of bad luck and tangled expectations. Still, it was there. > “She’s got this energy. It’s rare in Everwood. But nothing’s straightforward around here.”



Adam offered encouragement. Bob agreed to keep walking the path, “even when it’s twisted.”



Then came the stumbles.



Adam asked about Bob’s work schedule. Bob gave at least four different answers in five minutes:



First: nine to six.



Then: eight to five.



Then: starting at 6:30.



Finally: weekends off... except when he’s covering Jake’s shifts... unless Marty needs him.



When Adam called him out, Bob sighed: > “Confused? Maybe. About Rachel, about Jake, about a lot of things.” > “Feels like a fog that ain’t lifting.”



It was funny—but not just funny. Bob’s logic didn’t break because of laziness. It frayed under the weight of too many overlapping realities. He was trying to track it all—Jake, Rachel, Olivia, work, ghosts of parents past—and something in his internal gears began to grind.



But even in the fog, he stayed present. Reached for honesty.



That alone was progress.

For context, I’ve dealt with social anxiety most of my life. I’m that person who replays conversations from three years ago and overthinks what to say when ordering coffee. But about a month ago, I saw someone on the train ride home who genuinely caught my attention. She had this calm presence about her, and I felt drawn in a way I haven’t felt in years. We even got off at the same stop. I really wanted to say something, but I chickened out. For days after, I kicked myself for not just trying.

So when I saw her again this week, I promised myself I’d take the shot. I introduced myself nervously and asked if I could give her my number. She was kind about it, but let me know she was already seeing someone. Totally fair. I appreciated how direct and respectful she was.

But here’s where my brain kicks in.

Now I’m overthinking everything. Did I make her uncomfortable? Did I cross a boundary by approaching someone in public like that? I tried to be as respectful and brief as possible, and I definitely wasn’t pushy. I just didn’t want to go another day regretting not following through.

On one hand, I’m proud of myself. A few months ago, I wouldn’t have had the courage to do that. I didn’t expect anything to come of it, I just wanted to stop letting fear dictate every move I make. But now I’m left wondering if I messed up.

I guess I’m asking, was this a mistake? Is it wrong to approach someone like that in public, even politely? I’m not planning on making a habit out of it, I just... wanted to be braver for once.

Anyways, I (29f) recently had a blood panel done. CBC and some hormone stuff, thru LabCorp so I got to look at the results firsthand. Two things were flagged. My carbon dioxide levels were moderately low, and my ""LDL Chol Calc (NIH)"" levels were borderline high. The assistant called me to let me know everything was fine and no follow up app was req'd. 

I bulldozed into Google and AI because I like to investigate things myself. I found that these two things linked in with one another could ""possibly"" be tied in to kidney or thyroid disorders. I do have concerns with thyroid running in certain family members. And I have a long history of bladder/kidney probs since I was a kid. I was a bedwetter until age 12/13 and over the years starting in my 20s I've dealt with pylonephrits (sp?) almost once a year. I've been safe from it this year so far (knock on wood).

I'm not trying to get ahead of myself, but has anyone dealt with anything similar? I'm wondering if I should advocate for myself and opt for a deeper dive in blood specific testing for thyroid and kidney functioning. 

To add** I frequently deal with consistently sore/tight legs/feet that just feel super heavy all the time. Almost like one would when they work out intensely, or would be coming down with the flu or something. The thing is, I never get a temperature and I don't work out. I'm also at a good weight of 130 pounds and 5 foot 4. Also, I drink plenty of water because I live here in AZ so you need to stay hydrated. Even when I drink a lot, my urine output is not much at all. It's never bloody or cloudy though. The only time I produce a what seems like a normal amt of urine is when I drink some sort of duretic like coffee/tea. Not only that, but I've had this ongoing rash that comes and goes for the last maybe year and a half-2 years now. On the nape of my neck it was terrible, the Dr. Gave me steroid cream and it helped that area, but the itch is continuing now travelling up my scalp which is really strange, and it's not dandruff. In the last month I've  developed itchy blistering fingers also (I know there's a term for that). The itchiness is always the most intense in the AM and I've tried silk pillowcases, different laundry detergents, etc. trust me I've tried EVERYTHING to try and make changes to help my skin. But so far the itching has been localized to those areas this far. To sum that up, I've peeked into kidney stuff and I've seen mentioned that since it causes inflammation it can reflect as itchy ness on the skin too so I was thinking hmmmmm 🤔. I just thought it was interesting because the Dr didn't think the rash was eczema. So just put a bandaid on it, gave me steroid cream, said she'd refer to dermatogoly and never put in the referral. 

Okay ANYWAYS this was terribly long but I would love to hear annnnnyyyy feedback. Whether you all think I might be crazy, or I might be into something and should investigate further. This will probably be posted similarly in the kidney area of reddit also to get more insight there too.

Thank you all, I love you so much if you got to the end of this.♥️

Paul Blart, the ever-vigilant mall cop, patrolled the food court on his Segway with a cup of lukewarm coffee in one hand and a watchful eye on every suspicious churro.

But today was different. Today, the mall had a special guest.

An easel stood proudly in front of a small crowd near the central fountain. A man with a halo of permed hair and a soothing voice dipped his brush into gentle hues of green and blue. “Let’s paint a happy little tree… right here,” he whispered.

“Is that… Bob Ross?” Paul said aloud, nearly swerving into a Wetzel’s Pretzels cart.

Indeed, the late, great Bob Ross had inexplicably returned, thanks to what the mall’s manager described as a “temporary temporal art residency” funded by some bizarre NFT scheme. Paul didn’t understand it. All he knew was Bob Ross was back and painting in his mall.

For the next hour, Paul stood mesmerized by Bob’s serene brushstrokes and calming energy. All his stress melted away. No scooters. No shoplifters. No noise. Just happy clouds.

Then chaos struck.

A pair of masked thieves stormed into the mall, wielding paintball guns and slingshots. They were dressed like anarchist art critics berets, sunglasses, black turtlenecks—and they had one target in mind: Bob Ross’s paintings.

“We call this *performance art*, baby!” one of them yelled, firing neon green paint at a canvas.

Blart slammed his Segway into high gear. “Not on my watch.”

Bob, unshaken, calmly painted a waterfall while behind him, Paul swerved and dodged paintballs. With a perfectly-timed drift, Blart launched off the edge of a fountain and tackled one of the thieves mid-air, sending both tumbling into a decorative koi pond.

“That's one down,” Paul muttered, soaked but proud.

The second thief turned to run only to slip on a spilled Orange Julius, flying into Bob Ross’s easel. But Bob, as smooth as titanium white paint, caught the falling canvas before it could hit the ground.

“No mistakes,” Bob said with a smile, “just happy little accidents.”

The crowd cheered. The thieves were detained. Paul gave a triumphant nod to Bob, who gently painted a tiny Segway into the corner of his landscape.

Later that day, Paul received a framed copy of the painting with a note on the back:  
*“To Paul a true guardian of peace, order, and happy little trees. – Bob”*

Paul hung it above his locker. And every time he looked at it, he remembered that even in a world of chaos, there was always room for calm… and justice. Paul Blart and the Happy Little Heist

Which was my first big mistake.

Three fun college friends looking for a roommate to vibe with!

Admittedly, I thought I had met my soulmates.

How do I describe the feeling of meeting someone I feel like I've known my whole life?

The second I stepped inside what would become my prison, I could smell it.

Food.

Home-cooked meals have always been my kryptonite, so stepping directly into the aroma of spaghetti sauce had my mouth already watering. God, it smelled so fucking good, teasing the back of my nose and throat. It was almost like the house itself knew I was hungry.

The owner was a tiny blonde with enough enthusiasm to cast my gaze away from the rat droppings on the floor.

And there were a lot.

It was the first thing I noticed. Not the homely glow spilling from the doorway or the abstract paintings on the wall. 

There was too much poop to not notice, squishy brown balls directly under her feet. That wasn't in the listing description. Still, the owner’s smile was enough to drag my focus away from their lack of hygiene.

I didn't know what to say, so I blurted, “That smells good.”

The blonde grinned, leaning against the door. “Oh, you'll get used to that.”

When I couldn't think of a response, she bounded forward. “Hi! You're here for the room!” She stuck out her hand for me to shake, and immediately, I noticed her fingernails. If I wasn’t such a germ freak, I wouldn't have caught that they were filthy, a slight reddish tint coloring the stubs. That was a red flag.

Until I noticed the plastic apron hanging loose over scuffed denim overalls. Ah. That made sense.

Her name was Lizbeth, and she looked exactly like a Lizbeth, untidy blonde hair hanging in loose pigtails.

Nodding, I followed her into the hallway. “I'm—”

“Kia!” Lizbeth was bursting with unhinged golden retriever energy. I already loved her. She was exactly how she came across via text: sending me emoji hearts and kisses, replying with ""I'm so excited to finally meet you!"" 

I appreciated her remembering to call me Kia, and not Kiara. “We’ve been expecting you all afternoon!”

“Traffic,” I lied, stepping out of my shoes. My anxiety had gotten the better of me. I had been sitting in a local coffee shop for two hours, trying to psych myself up. 

I don't know why I was scared. I took a moment to drink in the hallway. It was cute. There were piles of shoes stacked up against the wall. I noticed a pair of snow boots.

Which was strange, because I couldn't remember the last time our town had snow. I didn't realize I was frowning at the boots until Lizbeth gently grabbed my shoulders and steered me down the main hallway. “Welcome to our little family,” she said. “It's not great, and we’re thinking about moving. But for now, it's home! What do you think?”

I smiled, appreciating the mix of modern and ancient. 

The house was old, but these guys had remodeled it to fit the 21st century. I turned my attention to Lizbeth herself, who was absently swiping her hands on her apron. Everything about this girl screamed best friend, big sister energy.

Her stripy socks were adorable. We already had a mutual love of Japanese dramas and cult classic horror movies.

I didn't recall her telling me about her other passion, though.

“Oh, you're an artist!” I remarked with what I hoped was a friendly smile.

Lizbeth didn't turn around, sliding across the hardwood floor in her stripy socks. “Nope! I'm actually a writer!”

Maybe she was embarrassed about the paint splatters.

I already knew the house was perfect for me when I walked straight into a game of Mario Kart, combined with that warm, homely aroma. Garlic. Two guys were arguing over the start-up screen, seated on a ratty couch. There were already bowls of fresh pasta on the coffee table.

I noticed an extra bowl set out, and I was already gravitating toward it. I didn't realize I was drooling until I had to wipe it away with my sleeve. One of the guys dropped his controller, shooting me a grin. His red hair was a little too red.

He was cute, with wide brown eyes and freckles.

“Kia, right?” His smile was friendly. “I'm Nate.” He gestured to the other guy, a kid with a wiry frame and thick brown curls hanging in his eyes. 

The guy offered me a shy wave, standing awkwardly to the side. All three of them shared the same pale, almost too pale skin and slightly sunken eyes. These guys weren't getting their vitamin D. “That's Finn, our resident cook,” his lips curled into a smile. “He’s also painfully bad at Mario Kart.”

The brunette, Finn, shoved him. “He's lying. I won the last three games.”

“Yeah, because I let you!”

“Boys,” Lizbeth cut in. “I told you not to embarrass yourselves.”

Rolling his eyes like he'd been scolded by his mother, Nate turned to me, slumping in front of his own dinner.

“We knew you were coming,” he said, nodding to the extra bowl. “Dig in! If you prefer a veggie dish, Finn can do a mean meat-free lasagna. There's some in the refrigerator if you want it.” He shot me a grin. “You're lucky our boy is in his second year of culinary school.”

I politely took a seat. “I can eat meat,” I said, trying to ignore Nate’s sudden, obnoxious laugh. He was one of those types of guys. I thought class jokers died out after high school.

Apparently not.

Dick jokes, though? Really?

His gaze tracked me grabbing my fork, his lips splitting into a grin when I took an experimental bite. Holy shit.

Part of me wasn't surprised the three of them were obsessed with my reaction. 

It tasted amazing—the exact amount of spice, a thick consistency to the sauce, the mincemeat driving me to finish my bowl without even savoring it. I was asking for seconds before I could stop myself, the words tangled on my tongue.

Finn was already jumping up, taking my bowl.

“See?” Nate had spaghetti sauce all over his chin, and my stomach gurgled.

I had to chew on the garlic bread side dish to shake away the sudden overwhelming, almost painful urge to… I don't know. I don't think I wanted to know, but I was hyper-focused on the sauce staining his skin, just thick enough to— I let that train of thought die when I was given seconds, and inhaled that too. Finn’s cooking. Fuck.

How do I describe it?

It was exactly what I remembered from my mother’s home-cooked meals, with an added something I couldn't place.

Was there a certain sauce he was using? Finn was in culinary school, so of course he had a signature taste. I don't remember much of my first night. Just that I signed the contract as soon as I finished my food, my mind caught in a fog. Lizbeth showed me the rest of the house, and my room was great, a double bed with an en suite and a great view of the town. But I couldn't stop thinking about Finn’s spaghetti sauce.

We played Mario Kart that night, and I distinctly remember being driven half crazy with the urge to sneak into the kitchen and lick all the plates clean.

I could not stop thinking about the dish. The sauce, the pasta, the perfect ratio of salt on the pasta, and garlic in the meat. 

I went to bed, my mind filled with nothing but Finn’s food. He cooked for us every night, and I lost myself in a blur of tasty meals ranging from homemade lasagna, to chicken Alfredo. 

The food was restaurant quality, and I cleaned my plate every night, hungry, no, starving for more. It became an addiction. I stopped going to class. 

No, I forgot I had class. I couldn't think of anything but when Finn was home, and when he was going to cook me another meal. Days started to blur into one. 

Monday became Tuesday, and suddenly it was Saturday, and I was starting to salivate. I caught myself one night, sitting cross legged on my bedroom floor, wet warmth dripping down my chin. 

The collar of my shirt was damp, pooling darkness seeping across the floorboards. I caught hold of myself. 

Drool. 

Finn’s cooking was becoming a problem. 

Also known as ruining my fucking life. 

I tried to leave. I packed up my bags, but once I was in the hallway, once my hand was on the door handle, I could *smell* it, the aroma chasing me, leeching onto my brain. It dragged me back. I dropped my bags, drool already filling my mouth. “Kia?” Nate was behind me, a bowl of pasta in his hands. 

With those last fragmented pieces of logic lingering in my mind, I noticed his fingers were stained too, streaks of scarlet still wet, pooling in his palms.

“Where are you going?” He nodded to the bowl. His voice was soft, hypnotising. 

“Dude. Your dinner is ready.”

My bag slipped from my grasp. I could sense a smile splitting my own lips apart. 

“Right.” I heard myself say in a breath, a hysterical giggle creeping up my throat.

“Dinner.”

I was already sticking my fingers in the bowl, stuffing myself until I couldn't breathe, spaghetti sauce dripping from my mouth, staining my clothes. 

It was all  over me, painting my fingers rich, blood red. Nate held the bowl, waiting until I'd cleaned it out. I was on my knees, trembling, dragging my tongue over every remnant. I lost myself after that meal in particular. 

Consciousness bled in and out. 

I was sitting at the dining room table, inhaling my dinner. 

Then I was bent over the toilet, my head pressed against cool porcelain. 

I didn't notice I was losing my teeth until I spat a wisdom into the faucet. 

Two days later, I was running my finger over a much sharper, elongated tooth sticking from my upper incisors. 

I became aware of the house’s temperature when I found myself lying awake, shivering, thinking about my next meal. When I slipped out of bed to head to the bathroom, I glimpsed a single layer of frost creeping across the floorboards. 

Nate mentioned the three of them liked the cold, but freezing to death? I stopped feeling it after a while.

I'm pretty sure the temperature never changed, but my body stopped shivering. I began having freezing cold showers, adding ice, because my skin was never cold *enough*. It's not like I didn't get along with the three of them. 

Outside of our mutual obsession with Finn’s cooking, and my ongoing awareness of my crumbling sanity, we had movie nights, game nights, and stayed up talking about everything and nothing until dawn. 

Lizbeth would fall asleep on my bed, the two of us engrossed in a Japanese drama, and Nate insisted on holding movie nights dedicated to specific actors. I almost died during Keanu Reeves night. 

The others didn't go to class, but they did disappear for several hours every night. I stopped asking questions when my brain melted into soup. 

Finn’s food took over my life. During movie night, I was thinking about his food. Game night, I was in the kitchen, eating leftovers from the trash. There was something wrong. The words slammed into me every so often, but I had a toxic relationship with my housemates. 

I couldn't just go. 

Where else was I going to find Finn’s cooking? 

9pm. I didn't know the day, or how many days it had been since I planned my escape out of the bathroom window, only to be lured back by teasing smiles and mushroom risotto. 

It was so hard to regain control of my own mind, and by the time I had managed to get a hold of myself, there they were. Always fifteen steps ahead of me. I pulled out a bloody molar after dinner, dropping it down the toilet. I think I was supposed to care. 

But caring and worrying about my debilitating health meant not thinking about what was next for lunch. 

There were so many dishes, so many recipes Finn hadn't tried yet. It was always that loose thought that dragged me down, plunging further and further into an oblivion I couldn't see a way out of. 

Before I lost most of my mind, I did find something under my mattress. 

Several VHS tapes, all of them labelled different dates, until the handwriting was unintelligible. 

There was a VHS player in Finn’s room, so I snuck inside when he and the others were out of the house. The first tape used to be a wedding video. 

There were still old white ribbons wrapped around it, and I got a glimpse of an ancient, and I mean *old* wedding ceremony at the start. This footage looked like it was before cameras were invented. I was frowning at a pale brunette bride when the real footage jumped into view. 

I was seeing Lizbeth, Finn, and Nate, squashed together on the couch. 

Nate leaned forward. He looked healthier, his face was fuller, a pinkish blush in his cheeks. He opened his mouth, and I glimpsed a full set of healthy teeth. 

Present Nate had elongated fang-like incisors. When he was eating, Nate could fillet a chicken bone within a second. His teeth were not normal. Neither were mine. I was losing all of mine in favour of sharper points that cut my lip open. 

The boy cleared his throat on the tape, and I leaned closer. Nate's mouth formed a teasing smile. “If you're watching this video, it means all three of us are dead.”

The other two side eyed him, and he burst out laughing. 

Lizbeth nudged him. Just like Nate, she too looked…normal. Her blonde hair was tied into a strict ponytail. This girl was glowing, while present Lizbeth was more of a shell. The girl turned to the camera. “Ignore Nate! He thinks he’s funny.” 

“I am funny,” he said. “Why are we recording these on my Mom’s wedding tapes? What's wrong with using TikTok?”

“Because this way is cooler.” Lizbeth said. “Shush. It's a cool aesthetic.”

Nate raised a brow. “What is *aesthetic* about ruining my Mom’s wedding tapes?”

“Annnywaaay,” Finn, who was usually shy and withdrawn, was like a hyperactive puppy. It was jarring seeing him smiling. 

“We figured we should give our potential housemate a look into our lives!” he shot Nate the side-eye. “Well, we were going to. Until you dropped the bombshell that you're going skiing with your weird family.”

Nate scoffed. “It's not my fault! I told you, I don't have a choice!” He turned to the camera. “Do you see what I have to deal with?”

“You're leaving us for two weeks,” Finn groaned, tipping his head back. “No offence, but I hope you get eaten by a bear.”

“I'm taking full offence.” Nate shot back. 

The tape was mainly bickering and laughing, so I took it out and inserted the next tape. 

It was the three of them again, though I noticed Lizbeth and Finn were keeping their distance from Nate, who was sitting on the other side, his head cocked, half lidded eyes drinking in the camera. Lizbeth's smile was a little too forced. She kept shooting panicked glances at the guy. 

“Hey! So, we’re sorry for taking a while to record! Uh, Nate just came back from holiday, and he's…. uhhh…”

When Lizbeth drifted off, Finn jumped in. “He's sick,” he said, shuffling further away from the boy. “We’re pretty sure it's contagious, so whatever our boy has, we really don't want it.”

Nate didn't move, his lips quirking into a smile. 

“Aren't you going to ask me how my trip was?” His voice was different, and it hit me. He was mimicking Lizbeth. 

Finn and Lizbeth exchanged glances.

“Tell him to stop,” Lizbeth stood up, her hands clenched into fists. “Finn!”

“Nate, take it easy, man,” Finn was trembling. “Why do you keep… “ he shot a look at the camera. “Asking that?”

The tape ended in eerie silence with the two of them watching Nate.

Who's smile only widened. 

The third tape made me regret exploring my housemates' past. 

There was just Nate sitting there, completely naked. His cheeks were gaunt, lips pulled into a feverish grin. 

Behind him was rapid movement, the sounds of muffled screaming.

The tape continued for five minutes, and Nate didn't move a muscle. 

The fourth tape was thankfully, back to normal. Ish. 

It started midway through a hissed conversation between them. 

Finn was sitting cross legged on the floor, Lizbeth was perched on the chair arm, and Nate was sitting with his knees pulled to his chest. There were giant bald patches on his head. I found myself running my hands through my hair. “I don't know,” he whispered into his knees. “I told you, I don't remember anything.”

Finn’s lips curled with disgust. He was gingerly wobbling his own loose tooth. 

“You don't remember disembowelling my fucking cat and stuffing her head in the refrigerator?” he made a point of scooting further away. He dislodged the tooth, his eyes widening. “You're sick.”

“He needs a doctor,” Lizbeth said softly. Her hair was greasy, her clothes stained. I could tell she had been up all night, dark circles shadowing her eyes. 

Nate curled into himself. “I know I do.”

“Fuck.” Finn stood up shakily, raking his fingers down his face. “We can fix this, okay? We’re getting you help.” he wrapped his arms around himself. “It's freezing. I'm turning up the thermostat.”

“Don't.” Nate’s tone hardened. “It's… It’s too warm.”

“What are you talking about? I can see my breath!”

The last tape felt wrong in my clammy hands. 

I inserted it, when thudding footsteps came up the steps. 

“Kia! Hey, I have this new video game–”

I gathered up the tapes and made my escape before Nate could find me. 

I wanted to think about what I had found, a clear sickness affecting my housemates.

And now it was running through my blood. 

It was skinning me alive, stealing away my thoughts. 

Making me hungry. 

But I couldn't *think*. 

Every time I tried, I fantasised about eating instead. 

I can't remember what day it was when I snapped to fruition. The sound of the front door slamming shut downstairs was too loud, and I jerked awake, drool already dripping down my chin. Too loud. 

I curled into myself, slamming my hands over my ears. I forgot my name. I forgot the year. I forgot *why* I was naked and chewing on my blanket.

I was so hungry. 

Jumping to my feet, I staggered at how fast I was, my thoughts dizzy. 

Clothes were too warm, too stuffy. 

But I couldn't just walk around naked. Looking at myself in the mirror, I was losing my hair. 

I didn't notice until my half lidded gaze caught the visible bald patch on my scalp. When I ran my fingers through it, my nails were loose and hanging off. 

My skin was pale, my eyes were sunken and red rimmed. I prodded at my cheeks. Somehow, I was getting thinner. But I was eating at least three bowls of food a night. *Wrong*. 

I stepped back, my nerve endings on fire. 

Get out. 

Get the FUCK out. 

But again, I couldn't think of anything except food. I stood for a long time, poking at my emaciated stomach. 

I was never *this* thin, right? 

“Kia!” Lizbeth shouted from downstairs. “We’re back!”

Making my way downstairs, I didn't remember  actually walking down them. I was at the top, and then I was at the bottom, my breaths laboured, my toes primed. My body didn't make sense. 

It felt like I could twist and contort it. Immediately, I could smell our meal, the aroma forcing my legs into a stumbling power-walk to the kitchen. This meal smelled…fresh. 

I couldn't escape it. When my gaze found the door, my escape, my body had a mind of its own, gravitated toward the kitchen. When I pushed the door open, I was hit in the face with a stink that both turned my stomach, and filled my mouth with saliva. I was already drooling,  feverishly looking for what meal was waiting for me this time. 

Instead, my housemates were preparing the food. 

I noticed the plastic first. Under my feet was a sheet of plastic spread out across the floor. I registered the red splatters, but my mind refused to confirm it was in fact exactly what it looked like. 

I waited for them to reel back in horror at me discovering their… hobby. Except neither of them were fazed. 

Lizbeth was playing with the oven dial, wearing a blood splattered apron, while the boys were knelt on the floor. There was a lump of something, what was left of a human body, that had been skinned. 

Nate’s red slicked hands were buried in the abdomen, while Finn had sliced open their skull, scooping out the brain into a plastic container. I could feel my body spasming with fear, a scream clawing its way up my throat.

“Hey, Kia,” Lizbeth saluted me with her wooden spoon. She was jumping up and down on her heels, waving the utensil excitedly. My housemate was stirring something lumpy. I took that moment to take a slow step back. If I turned and ran, I could make it out of the front door before they could move. 

“Kia?” Tucking a strand of hair behind her ear,  Lizbeth beamed at me. She was unbothered. Unfazed. Which meant I was either fucking hallucinating, or my housemates really thought I would be okay with their casual cannibalism. 

I felt myself freeze, a thick paste creeping its way up my throat. 

If they had been eating people, then…

Before the thought could fully register, I was already knelt on the ground, choking up the remnants of my lunch. 

“Do you mind grabbing me the sriracha sauce from the cupboard?”

The word was caught in my throat. 

Yes. 

But instead of a reply, a shriek was clawing its way into my mouth. 

“It's on the bottom shelf,” Nate said from his place on the floor. He was humming a melody, and I found myself mimicking it. The boy looked up, a faded red blur caught around his iris. 

His smile was wide, fleshy white streaks caught between his teeth. 

Why was I *smiling?* 

Nate patted the place next to him. “Yo! I'll show you how to skin a corpse. It's actually really easy. You just use the blade like this,” he mimed dragging the knife, “It's a clean cut across the gut.”

Finn chuckled, his hands full of…urgh. 

“We’ll take her hunting first. When she's caught her first meal, *then* we show her how to correctly gut a corpse.”

“Uh, no!” Lizbeth sang. “That's too much. She's not even eaten raw yet!”

My mouth was watering, and the gooey streak of scarlet looked so good. 

I followed their words and took out the sriracha, my legs giving way. I hit the ground, except I barely felt the impact. 

*Run!*

Why was I shuffling over to a meat cleaver? 

*Run!*

Why was I joining them?

“Kia?”

The three of them were in front of me, suddenly. There was something inhuman about the way their bodies twisted, like their skin was shedding. 

Finn regarded me with a cocked head, his teeth on display. 

Nate and Lizbeth were more territorial, backing me into the wall. 

And I was twisting around, and making for the door. 

Fuck this. 

I tried to escape four times.

Each time, I am awake, screaming, and they are dragging me back. 

I went back to the tapes, sliding in tape number five. 

This time, there was just Finn. I could see where the sickness had begun to take him over, streaking through his veins. 

He didn't speak for a while, and it was when I was waiting, when I saw the two bodies at his feet. Nate and Lizbeth. 

They were dead, lying in pools of red turning black. But already, I could see their emaciated limbs were jerking, moving slowly, skin rippling. 

Finn coughed lumps of red into his hands. 

“Urgh.” he sat back, closing his eyes. 

He opened his mouth, pointing to his upper incisors, lips widening into a genuine smile. “See these?” he prodded to the tooth. “Ha! I have actual fangs. Thanks, Nate. You fucking idiot.”

Finn went on about vampires for way too long, so I rewound it. 

“I have days,” Finn spoke through his fingers. “Maybe a week, if I starve myself.” he sighed, turning his focus to the camera. “If you find this tape, there's only one thing I want you to do,” he said. 

“Burn this place down,” the guy pried his eyes open, and I could see writhing darkness tangling around his iris. 

It was spreading, a spider-like web taking over him. “Whoever welcomed you into our house isn't us. I showed you what happened to Nate to scare you away, man. Get the fuck out of this house.”

Something moved below him, and already, he was jerking up, an inhuman snarl ripping from his throat. 

Finn jumped up, teeth bared, when the thing that *was* Nate slowly got to its feet. The guy pulled a knife from his jeans and stabbed the blade into the thing’s skull. He screamed, yanking the knife out. 

Nate dropped to the ground, and Finn let out a wet sob, crumpling back onto the couch. 

There was the hint of red swirling around his pupil, elongated teeth retracting back. 

“Burn this place down,” he heaved out a breath. “With us inside.” 

I'm at a loss what to do because I have this thing too. 

I don't even know what it is, but I can't bring it into the outside world. I'm terrified of this thing, but I’m pretty sure it's contagious. If I had to guess, I think it's spread through our saliva. 

Like Finn said, burn all of us, and kill this thing.

Little world building bit so you actually know what’s going on: 
You know how in mob psycho 100 there’s Psychics? It’s kinda like that. Except there’s different ranks for how strong you are. The more powerful you are the rarer you are. D, C, B, A, AA and S rank. S being the most powerful and rare, D being the most common and weak. 
As a note A, AA and S ranks are more likely to have 2 abilities, even 3 is not unheard of in S ranks. Although the more abilities you have the weaker they are (as to not get overpowered) and all powers have a consequence

there’s mercenary groups who hire the psychics and will rent them out to governments. Solkov being the most powerful of them. Based out of Russia even though the Russian government hates them, they can’t do anything because of Solkov’s allies. 
Also as a note, because of populations and stuff China, India, American, Indonesia and Pakistan quite powerful because of how many people they have. 
Akihiko one of the main characters is an S rank Psychic (Levitation and Channeling) but when he had his psychic awakening at 11 he was possessed and accidentally killed his parents. He hasn’t used his powers since for obvious reasons and has pretty much blacked out the memory. 
The other main character (the man in Akihiko’s apartment) Aleksander Yesun is also an S rank (Shadow and Curse) he was genetically modified by Solkov to be more powerful as a psychic in a set of experiments. He now works for Solkov but he hates the head chairman of Solkov, Avros Solkov and is plotting to kill him. 
Aleksander was sent to Akihiko’s apartment to offer him a job with Solkov. (Read: force Akihiko to work for Solkov) because they are interested in hiring him. 

That was a lot to read😅. Uh enjoy I guess.


TW: Suicidal thoughts



Hour by hour, day by day, week by week—that was Akihiko’s philosophy. As a salaryman this was a necessary mindset to avoid going crazy from the long days and horrible work environment. Akihiko wasn’t sure he'd survive another day of working overtime so thankfully it was Friday. As usual, work was frustrating. His boss had yelled at him for failing to secure a client, he spilled his coffee on the way back from break, and his coworker messed up, forcing him to pick up the slack. He got off work extra late, finally checking out at 9 pm. 

His legs felt shaky as he walked down the steps to the subway, just barely making it to the last train. The subway car was almost empty, with no one but Akihiko and a few drunk teenagers. Listening to them talk and laugh reminded him of the youth he never had. It was always study study study, and for what? For Akihiko to end up working a 9-5 at a black company? It was moments like these that made Akihiko wish he was never born. what’s the point of being alive if you aren’t living? Not that he wished to die, he was afraid of that. Maybe he’d get over his fear and do it someday. Or maybe he’d keep living this dull existence, he’s dead inside either way. After the long commute, he got off and began trudging back to his apartment. 

His legs felt heavy as he walked up the stairs. Somehow, Akihiko managed to get back to his apartment. But when he moved to unlock the door, he noticed that the handle was broken. ‘I don’t even have anything to steal.’  Akihiko considered calling the police, but figured he should see if they had taken anything. He took a deep breath gathering his courage. And he pushed open the door. The lights were on but nothing else seemed out of place, umbrella still on the rack, coat still hung up. Barely daring to breathe, he turned the corner of the hallway. There, sitting on his couch was a man... Akihiko froze, his heart pounding in his ears as the man turned around. ‘Beautiful’ wasn't quite the right word to describe him, but it was about as close as Akihiko could get. Akihiko wasn’t sure why he felt so unnerved by him, he looked normal enough, although it was likely because the man had broken into his apartment and was sitting on the couch waiting for him.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **UFC 317 Prediction: Brandon Royval vs. Joshua Van**  
*The odds are stacked like a precarious takedown defense… let’s dive in.*

**The Fight:** Flyweight phenom Joshua Van (-125) takes on veteran Brandon Royval (+105) in a bout that’s as thrilling as watching your uncle try to beat you at chess for the 10th time. Van, a 23-year-old with six wins in his last seven fights, is the favorite, but Royval’s resume (7-3, former title challenger) whispers, “*Don’t sleep on the guy with ‘champ-chaser’ written all over him.*”

**Key Stats:**

* Van’s takedown defense (89th percentile) could frustrate Royval’s grappling game.
* Royval’s durability? He’s survived 25+ minutes in 80% of his fights.
* The money’s on Van (-118 to -125, depending on the book), but Royval’s +105 odds make him a “sucker’s bet” for those who like underdogs with a flair for drama.

**Prop Bet Alert:**

* **Fight Goes the Distance?** The line is -185 (yes) vs. +150 (no). Given Van’s slick defense and Royval’s “I-don’t-quit” attitude, this feels like a 12-round chess match with judges needing coffee breaks between rounds. **Take the Under 2.5 rounds? Nah.** Bet the *Over* at 1.45 (DraftKings) if you *really* want to see a 45-second knockout… or just prepare for a war.

**Final Verdict:**  
Van’s youth and skill make him the pick, but Royval’s experience fighting champions could turn this into a “Wait, who’s the favorite?” moment. If you’re risk-averse, **lay the -185 on the fight going to a decision**—it’s the MMA equivalent of betting on a draw in soccer.

*Prediction:* Van wins via decision, but only after Royval makes him earn every second. May the judges have mercy… or at least stop talking to the ceiling.

*Odds as of June 29, 2025. Bet responsibly, or don’t—this fight’s probably going to 29-28 anyway.* 🥊

One of the biggest challenges for me was mixing the brown color palette with black and white. At first, I was only using black and white, it looked good, but it felt too easy. Since this isn’t a real brand, I wanted to challenge myself and avoid taking the easy way out.

What do you think about the addition of the 2 brown? Do you feel it matches the vibe of the project, or does it feel out of place?

I ended up getting a mocha and it was comparable to other mochas I’ve had. But one thing I couldn’t get past was how expensive it was compared to other coffee shops (I believe it was around $9.50). Maybe they use specialty coffee beans, and that justifies the price? Also, they only have one size, which is 20 oz. So maybe that contributes to the price as well. 

I did like the atmosphere of the place though, with the interior design, music, and overall vibe. I probably won’t be going there often for my coffee (Jeffersons coffee is top tier for me), but maybe every once in a while for the nice sit-down atmosphere and experience.

""Savaging the Civilized"" by Ramachandra Guha","Continuing my Ramachandra Guha review series (because, why stop a good thing?), today’s book is 'Savaging the Civilized', one of his lesser known but deeply fascinating works. This one isn’t a recent read, I read it way back in 2010 on Kindle, and the memory of it stayed on like a good aftertaste. The signed physical copy joined my shelf much later, thanks to Midland Bookstore and one of Guha’s promotional visits in 2022. Yes, another signature acquired, and yes, my retirement corpus continues to weep quietly.

Now, before I read this, I had absolutely 'nada zero' clue who Verrier Elwin was. My first reaction when I read the blurb was; “Wait, why is Guha writing a whole book about this guy?” I should’ve known better. Guha never picks dull subjects.

Elwin’s story is anything but ordinary. A British priest-in-training, he landed in India as a missionary, met Gandhi, fell under his spell, and then just… stayed. Not in ashrams or salons, but among India’s tribal communities. He married a Gond woman, immersed himself in tribal life, and later became an advisor to Nehru on tribal policy. Basically, he went from preaching the gospel to writing papers on tribal folklore and advising on how to balance development and indigenous rights.

Unlike 'Rebels Against the Raj', where you get seven stories in bite-sized portions, this is a whole thali devoted to just one person, and let’s just say, the servings are 'generous'. The book dives deep into policy debates, ethnographic notes, personal letters, and some incredibly rich observations about tribal life. It’s not a breezy read; there were bits where my brain did wander off to make coffee, but it more than made up with insight and perspective.

What stayed with me most were the timeless questions the book raised: Should tribal communities be integrated or protected? Can an outsider ever 'truly' belong? And in a world driven by development and speed, is there space for slow, rooted lives?

It didn’t give me neat answers (Guha never does), but it trained me to ask better questions, and for that, I’ll always be grateful.

Also, bonus: I now confidently drop the name ""Verrier Elwin"" in conversations and watch people go “who?” which is always fun.",2,1751161432.0,Indianbooks,0,1.0,False

She was lured, abducted and killed by Ted Bundy. Her remains were later found on Taylor Mountain, WA, along with those of other victims.","Roberta Kathleen Parks (Kathy) was born on February 27, 1954, in Lakewood, Ohio. On an unknown date, she began attending Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon.

Kathy left her dormitory on May 6, 1974, to have coffee with some of her friends. She was supposed to meet her friends at the Memorial Union, but never showed up.

 Her remains were found on March 3, 1975, in Issaquah, Washington, in a wooded area near Taylor Mountain. She was identified four days later. Her cause of death couldn't be determined, but her case was deemed a homicide.

Initial Aftermath

When Kathy disappeared, police began to get worried. She was the fourth college-age woman to disappear from the Pacific Northwest in four months. They didn't have much concrete evidence at this time, but all of the cases were believed to be connected, and were believed to have been committed by a man in a sling, who went by the name ""Ted,"" as this man was seen in the area at the time of some of the disappearances.

The man would later be identified as Ted Bundy, who was first apprehended in 1975. He had been a suspect in the Washington and Oregon murders for a while, but there was no substantial evidence against him.

Bundy confessed to Kathy's murder, along with twenty-nine other murders, very shortly before his execution on January 24, 1989. He said he noticed her in the college's cafeteria, and approached her. He convinced her to go with him to a bar, but as soon as she got in his car, Bundy tied, and gagged her. He drove back to Washington, raping Kathy twice on the way, and murdered her in Washington, before dumping her body at Taylor mountain, where she would be found.

1ln2za8,https://i.redd.it/sqq3wsc3tr9f1.png,I Became His Mistress's Living Blood Donor in Disguise,"# Unraveling the Lies One Chapter at a Time—Full Breakdown & Reading Info

My husband left his childhood sweetheart, insisting on marrying me, and I believed he loved me. It wasn't until a car accident claimed my child that I uncovered his secret. Parker married me to exploit my blood to save the child he had with Melina Jacobs. All those post-wedding hospital visits weren't for my care—they were to turn me into a living blood bank for his and his true love's child. Well, if that's the case, then let me support you both.

I sat in the car, my body trembling in disbelief as I listened to the recording from the dashcam. It captured a conversation between Parker and his assistant a month ago—just weeks before I lost my baby in that car accident. After five years of marriage, I finally understood why I had frequently ended up in the hospital after mysterious fainting spells and injuries. My blood type was the perfect match for the child he had with another woman.

The icy wind outside the car window was tame compared to the chill I felt inside. Memories flooded over me like a storm—five years of endless accidents. Car crashes, muggings, fires... Even when there were no ""accidents,"" Parker would tell me during hospital visits, ""Isabel, the doctor says you're weak from stress and injuries. You need frequent check-ups."" And it was always at his family's private hospital. Because of this supposed ""fragility,"" Parker accompanied me to every appointment, every single time.

I had been moved by his apparent devotion, believing he cared deeply for me. He never missed a hospital visit and was always at my side. But now, I realized he was just making sure his living blood bank didn't escape. He had to watch me until he personally oversaw my blood being sent to his child with Melina Jacobs.

I had wondered why he suddenly insisted on marrying me despite his long history with Melina. Now it was clear. He wasn't interested in me, just the blood running through my veins. Unable to contain my emotions any longer, tears began to fall. For the sake of Melina and their child, he didn't hesitate to cause my miscarriage, as long as the child received the blood.

Parker left me in the car, claiming he was buying my favorite strawberry cake. I watched him in the distance, wearing his sharp suit, waiting in line. Then I looked at the phone on the driver's seat and hesitantly picked it up. The wallpaper was still our wedding photo, and the password was my birthday. But now, it all felt like a cruel joke.

I opened his messaging app, and at the top wasn't me. He had saved Melina under the affectionate nickname ""Lina."" I checked Melina's profile and found her birthday. Amazingly, using it, I accessed Parker's private photo album. The pictures inside felt like a punch to the gut—each one documenting Melina and her child. In contrast, photos of me were scarce.

I flipped through the chat history from a month ago, ""Parker, Teo needs a blood transfusion."" Without a moment's hesitation, he replied, ""I'll arrange a car accident for her to miscarry, then we can safely give Teo the blood.""

The scene made my body shake uncontrollably. How could his heart be so callous? And how blind and pitiful was I? Tears spilled down my face, unstoppable. I pressed my trembling hand to my abdomen. On the day of my miscarriage, Parker held me, pretending sorrow, telling me we’d have children again.

Every ounce of what I thought was love felt painfully ironic now. I looked up and saw Parker approaching with the cake, quickly wiping my tears, putting the phone back, and pretending nothing had happened. He got into the car, sensing something was off with me. ""Isabel? What's wrong? You seem upset.""

Feigning calm, I replied, ""Nothing, I'm just a bit cold.""

He didn’t suspect anything, quickly opening the cake and handing me a cup of hot coffee. ""Here, take this to warm your hands."" I forced a bitter smile as he fed me cake with a spoon. ""Is it good?""

I nodded, forcing a smile, ""Delicious."" But no amount of sweetness could mask the bitterness in my heart. I would no longer be this ""living blood bank."" Parker, if you love Melina so much, then go ahead. I'll step aside for you both.",1,1751161180.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

The overwhelming majority of people said I am not the asshole and the old man is out of line.

This man, however, accused me of faking the story as some weird fantasy and posted it to r/thathappened, where I’ve been attacked and accused of making up a fake harassment story for…attention? He then used these 2 different accounts (you can see that they are the same person since he follows and posts in all the same Reddit groups and writes posts/comments on the same exact topics, including baseball cards, elderly cats, living in California, liberal politics, and r/thathappened) to obsessively attack me. He followed me to a group where I posted about going through a diagnostic process for autism and mocked me there. Then he falsely accused me of being a racist MAGA supporter even though I am a feminist liberal woman of color with a disability and literally nothing about my post history (which is largely about feminism and domestic violence/abusive relationships) insinuates I like or support Trump. Many of his comments have been deleted by Reddit fro violating hate/harassment policies. He used a 3rd account to defend himself in a post where I talked about his harassment of me. He claimed I was doxxing him (all I did was post his Reddit accounts and expose the things he was saying to me) even though I did not share any personal or identifying information, so it’s not doxxing. After that he started calling me “little c-nt” in the DMs, threatening to have my account deleted for “doxxing” him, when I haven’t done that.

So he has been obsessively harassing me because he claims my story about harassment must be fake. The irony of this is laughable. Why do men do this? What kind of psychology drives them to despise women this much? Even if I block him, he has so many accounts that he can easily just keep harassing and abusing me.

This recipe calls for 1/2 tsp cinnamon - the next time I make it, would it be enough of a difference to simply double it to 1 tsp? Or would that likely not do much and I need to go bigger? 

Also, if I add more cinnamon, do I need to adjust any other measurements? 

I will say that when I made these, I did the below in case this could have had an effect:
* converted and weighed everything in grams but the butter, vanilla, eggs, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt 
* only had about half the amount of maple syrup the recipe called for
* used a bit more buttermilk than the recipe called for

She also bought me a Baratza Encore ESP to go with it (since she read that getting the best grinder you can is important for good espresso), but I am curious to hear from the community:

Would you keep the Baratza as a starter grinder? Or would you return it, survive on the Capresso for now, and save up for something nicer, in, say, 6 months? We don’t have loads of extra cash to throw around (the Bambino + Encore was probably the most expensive gift either of us have ever purchased for the other), so I'd say max budget in that time frame would be \[$500\], but I also understand the value of investing in quality equipment.

I'm an avid reader and a huge fan of audiobooks. Since I travel frequently, listening to books is a convenient way for me to enjoy stories. Plus, I love the experience of being read to! I often listen at double speed, so if you want to chat about literature, I’d be thrilled.

Movies are another love of mine, especially dramas, rom-coms, musicals, and some thrillers and comedies. The last film I caught in theaters was ""Materialists."" I enjoyed it, although it wasn't as romantic as I expected—so I might see it again with a fresh perspective.

Theater, ballet, and opera . I adore dressing up to witness exceptionally talented performances—it’s always a magical experience.

When it comes to food, I enjoy dining out and experiencing new restaurants. While I can cook and do enjoy it, I’m currently in a phase where exploring brunch and dinner spots with friends is my preference. I’m a big fan of iced coffee and enjoy sharing too much champagne with good company!

My kids joined at a younger age and, not wanting to disappoint them bc we didn't have an ""eternal famoly,"" I joined too. Literally just for them. Wouldn't join to please my husband or his family even after many years of marriage. Never had a testimony except wanting to be a good mom to the best of my ability. 

Anyway, before I joined, I drank alcohol, coffee, and tea. I quit when we started going back but since then have started to bend the rules some. I get really bad travelers constipation (sorry for the tmi) and so I would drink coffee to combat that. My husband knew and I could tell there was an little hmm in his head bit he said nothing more. 

Since then, we've had our struggles about paying tithing especially with our household debt and how little of the money comes back to the ward. I've told him I'm not super interested in renewing my recommend when it comes time. I miss relief society bc ive never liked it in all my years but will attend Sunday school with him. 

Recently, after some challenges, I started having some wine in the evenings. Perhaps not a great reason to start having a bit of alcohol but I'm not on medications for anything even though I believe I would be a candidate. My husbamd found out about the wine and he was about as close to freaking out as I've ever seen him. Talked about trust, how he didn't like that I didn't tell him, etc. I explained to him that I wanted to tell him but knew he would be disappointed. I also had some mixed messages bc we had some conversations where he said he kinda missed how I would be more relaxed and flirty when I'd have a glass of wine. Part of me thought, ""hes telling me this bc he knows I have been sneaking it and this is his only way to say hes good with it.""

Well, that was wrong. He asked me if I was going to keep doing it. O want to just be a normal adult who has a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. If we go to Europe, I want to have a wine-tasting amd drink a coffee. Just be allowed to make my own decisions as a middle-aged woman bc I'm not hurting anyone around me. I dont drink and drive. I dont get drunk. I'm not mean to my family. I told him I would work on it if he was really that against it but I wanted it to be my decision. He agreed ad we left it there.

We are at an ok place currently but I was wondering if anyone has any advice for what would be good for us? I'm very nuanced as I've told him. Even told him that I couldn't see myself attending if he wasn't here anymore and honestly,  not sure I will once my kids are of age. But I attend now as a family with my own boundaries so my mental health doesn't suffer.

I’ve always been bigger and it hadn’t really bothered me. I considered myself still healthy as I was working out 5-7xs a week with intense workouts. But a surprise pregnancy and injury caused me to have to decrease and I started gaining. I expected as much as it was a new chapter of life. I wasn’t exercising as much but commuting was 90% biking everywhere I needed to be and I still had to walk my dogs pretty far each day. I wasn’t at zero activity but I shouldn’t have been gaining so rapidly. Especially because my diet wasn’t excessive. In the sense as I had never had a calorie intake issue. I “forget” to eat often. I’m either busy or it’s too late and eating at that time will ruin the only meal I actually eat, which is dinner. I survive off a coffee in the morning because if I eat an actual meal in the morning my anxiety will make me throw it up. Complicated and stupid. Yes I know. This pattern frustrates me as well. No doctor has ever believed this though. I’ve been put on birth controls which also have contributed to the weight gain so I stopped them hoping it would help. I’ve been on antidepressants and anxiety medications for a really long time which probably hadn’t helped at all in the weight department, but I can’t stop those. It wasn’t until I noticed that while no longer on BC, the times I was actually getting a period I was having suicidal thoughts. Talked to my psych and she said it sounds hormonal and doesn’t want to increase or change anything she’s giving me until I get looked at. So she referred me to a hospital of study. Got a bunch of tests and back on hormonal medication. Weight gain again. All my blood work they do comes back normal. No liver or kidney issues, cholesterol is great, just inflammation and I’m “probably in pain but don’t know it”. I kept being told just lose weight like it was the easiest fn thing in the world. I went back to working out nearly daily. Still walking my dogs as well, commuting by bike still. No difference in weight changes. Doctor said I’m over eating and lying about my diet. I gave up for a while. No one was going to listen so why bother going. I ended up going to school and stress caused weight gain and a nice bout of shingles. I was forced to take a break and ended up doom scrolling one day and saw a Dr on TikTok talking abt what blood work to ask a doctor for if you’re having irregular periods, and weight gain. My next hormonal medication refill I decided to ask. Did the test and there were abnormalities. Was then referred to a diabetic doctor who found a bit of a fatty liver on a CT, but overall pretty healthy. Just very clear markers of insulin resistance that he concluded has been caused by PCOS. He isn’t in this field. His main field is diabetics. He could only do a gastric bypass which wouldn’t be of much use since I don’t eat a lot as it is. I already got an earful about that from the nutritionist I saw. She actually believed me! He is sending me to an endocrine specialist and said that an option I’m going to hear from him is wegovy. Which is what he also recommends but can’t give to me because I’m not diabetic. (It’s complicated on what doctor can do what where I live) I may also need to pay for it out of pocket since insurance wouldn’t cover it as it’s still under study for PCOS treatment where I live. It’s affordable if necessary so I don’t mind. 

If this is something I’ll be on what can I expect? I haven’t seen the endocrine specialist yet but the diabetic Dr is a close colleague of his and said he has seen/heard of almost no rebounds after using it and that at my weight I should probably need it for about a year an a half. I like weight lifting I’ve always hated cardio and it contributed to my injury so I only do walking or biking. Will I need to increase cardio again? Will working out too often cause an unhealthy amount of weight loss too quickly? I want to be careful and smart about this. I’m not looking to be super skinny. It had never been my goal. But I know I don’t want to be morbidly obese like a lot of my family is/was. As it stands I feel like I’m nearing that path even with exercise. I want to be strong and healthy. I’ve heard a lot of people just talking about the weight loss. What about muscle loss? Hair loss? My face is hairy yeah but I’m fine waxing it. I don’t want to lose my head hair. She’s precious. I have so many thoughts and concerns about this that I don’t know what to ask the doctor or anything. I’ll see him next week for a plan of action. Any tips?

Sorry if this is all over the place! I’m just pretty overwhelmed by it all. ",2,1751160537.0,PCOS,5,1.0,False

I open his office door and almost fall when I see what I see. Brad on his couch, smooching a girl. I can't make out who she is and I don't even think I want too. 
""How could you do that to me?"" I ask. He looks down at the floor. Something in the way he just presented himself tells me this wasn't the first time. ""How long has this been going on?""
""6 months."" He says without hesitation.
""Oh my God."" I say, putting my face in my hands. I sit on the coffee table across from him, too in shock to even have anything to say.
""I was gonna tell you but... I didn't know when the right time would be."" He says, leaning back against the couch, sighing.
""Your joking right? There is no right time to tell your wife your cheating on her.""
_________
 
Wednesdays are my busiest day of the week. I bring the kids to a program called School And Play. They go there for 4 hours and it gets them ready for the school environment they'll soon be going in too. I then pick them up, bring Brad his lunch, take the girls to ballet, cook supper and then have the Council meeting at the town hall. I'm not perfect so sometimes it doesn't all get done on time but most days I'm punctual. I have twin girls. Jill and Kacey. They're 4. My husband and I have been married since I was 18 so for 3 years now. We had the girls one year before our marriage and no we didn't get married just because of them like my parents believed. We love each other. Some people say we're too young but I'm 21 and he's 25. I personally think we're both mature enough to handle our own lives. When I got pregnant we moved in to an apartment together. It was a 2 bedroom place and it was definitely not the ideal place. I never felt safe there one night we slept there. But we started there. It was our first official place together. Now he has a job as a police officer and I work as an intern at a magazine company. We also upgraded from the apartment. We now live in a 2 story, 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom house surrounded by trees and nice neighbors although we don't talk to them very much.
The sound of my alarm going off pulls me out of my sleep. I roll over and look on the nightstand. The clock says 7 and I roll my eyes at the sight. One thing I hate doing is getting up early.
""You know the Anderson's got a dog?"" Brad says, coming out of the bathroom, a towel around his waist.
""That's why the girls have been asking to go over there all weekend."" I chuckle, turning the alarm off.
""Guess I'll have to bring them over one day after work.""
""Yes please. Maybe then I'll get some cleaning done."" I say, sitting up. I get myself out of bed and put my silk robe on. I go down to the kitchen and make some coffee for Brad and me. I recently invested in a Keurig and it's the best thing I've bought in a while. The girls won't be up for another hour so I have some time to myself before my day begins to get hectic. I sit down and begin to drink my coffee on the couch, turning the tv on to see what the weather is gonna be today. The weather channel is hardly ever turned off around here. Brad eventually comes downstairs, all ready for work. He always gets ready before coming downstairs. He says it stops him from being too lazy in the mornings. In some ways we're total opposites, that being one.
""You'll be home in time for my meeting right?"" I ask, looking at the tv in front of me.
""Sure will."" He says, opening the fridge door. I get up off the couch and sit at the kitchen island, watching him as he takes out a small fruit salad for his breakfast. Heaven forbid he eats at home.
""You remember what time it is right?"" I ask, just making sure he will actually remember to be home on time.
""Yes dear."" He chuckles, rolling his eyes and walking over to me.
""Have a good day."" I smile, smooching him quickly on the lips.
""Love you."" He yells, walking out the door.
When he's gone I finish my coffee and go up to our room to get a shower. It's so relaxing in here. It's like I'm the only one in the house; in the world. But eventually I have to get out.
Leggings and a hoodie are the perfect things for today. I put my hair back in a quick bun and then go wake the girls. They share a room since they're still small and don't really need their own spaces yet. It's much more convenient when it comes to getting them ready and putting them to bed. We also needed a spare because our parents come into town quite a lot. We're a very close family and it certainly comes in handy.
""Good morning."" I smile, opening the blinds in their bedroom. I watch as they roll around in their beds, rubbing their eyes and making their hair an even bigger mess.
""It's ballet today."" Jill says, sitting up in her bed.
""Yes it is. So let's get ready."" I say, going to their dresser.
I get them dressed, feed them breakfast, pack their bags and load them into the car. By 9 were all ready to go. Not very often does this happen.
When I drop the girls off I head over to my best friend Natasha's house. We've been friends since grade 10 and nothing has changed since then. Were still just as close. She's been really supportive the whole time with the kids and Brad. Even when everyone else was disagreeing with us. She gets into the car and smiles at me, her white smile practically reflecting the sun.
""So where too first?"" She asks, putting her seatbelt on.
""I guess we can head into town and pick up Brad's lunch.""
""Sounds good."" She smiles.
I only bring Brad lunch on Wednesday's. I work on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Sunday. Saturday and Wednesday are my breaks. Which I don't mind and no one else seems to mind either. I stop at a cafe and pick him up a sandwich and fries. It's his favorite spot to get lunch from so I bring it to him every week. We've been coming here since we first started dating.
""So how do you know he isn't like out on duty or something?"" Tash asks.
""I don't know. If he isn't there I'll just leave it on his desk or with the secretary."" I shrug, getting out of the car.
I walk into the building and head to the secretaries desk. She smiles up at me and tells me that Brad's out on a drive around shift but he'll be back soon. She's been the secretary here since Brad first came here. She hasn't changed at all actually. Her hair is still dark brown and she still doesn't wear any makeup. She did, however, start doing her nails and wearing more than sneakers to work.
""I'll just lay it on his desk."" I smile at her.
I walk down the hall and some people smile at me and ask me how I'm doing. Around this town everyone knows everyone. Especially at the really local places. I open his office door and almost fall when I see what I see. Brad on his couch, smooching a girl. I can't make out who she is and I don't even think I want too. I lay his lunch on the chair right next to the door and close it quietly. I doubt he even knew I was there. No need to make a scene at work I've learned. It can wait until we get home. I go out to the car and drive away. I wanna just crash the car and cry but I can't because Natasha is here and we'd probably die and there's no way I'd let the girls stay with that cheater of a dad they have. It literally feels like my heart exploded. I have no idea how I should feel right now. How are you even supposed to feel in a time like this? Now I have to go and pick the girls up. I know I usually do it before but I left early today so I could pick them up after and not be rushed which probably back fired. If I had picked the girls up first then I would've been in a rush and just left lunch at the front desk. I pull into the school and get out. They're outside waiting with their teacher, Mrs. Pine. They run to me and I bend down and hug them. It's a long time being away from mom for them sometimes which I don't mind. They are with me all the time pretty much. I wave bye to the teacher and put them into the car.
""Did you have fun today?"" I ask, backing out of the parking spot.
""Yes."" They say in unison. It's a twin thing. They do it a lot.
I drop off Natasha and carry on with the normal Wednesday schedule, meeting and all. By the time I get home to relax it's 9:30. The girls are already in bed asleep thankfully. I get out of the car and just stare at my peaceful looking house. The grass is freshly cut and the small flowers down by the sidewalk are beginning to grow back. I look up and see the neighbors just getting home too and I wave putting on a smile. If they only knew what's about to happen when I go inside. I walk up the front porch and go inside, flicking on the outside light's as I do. Brad is on the couch watching tv, a beer in his hands. There's 2 empty bottles on the coffee table. After long days at work he does this normally but lately it's been an every second day thing and it's beginning to really get on my nerves. How much beer does one man need? I shoo the girls upstairs and lay my purse on the table by the front door.
""Seriously?"" I ask, walking into the living room. I pick up the bottles and the empty chip bag and bring them to the kitchen, disposing of them.
""I'm just winding down after a long day at work. Nothing wrong with that."" He says, walking over to me.
""Everyday has been a long day for you lately."" I say, turning around to face him.
""Well maybe I'm stressed."" He says, sitting on a stool at the island.
""Why? Because you have something your trying to hide?"" I ask, wiping off the counter. When I'm mad I tend to clean.
""I have nothing to hide."" He shrugs.
""Crappp!"" I raise my voice, spinning around. I can't have the girls hearing me upstairs so I can't yell to the volume that I want too. I throw the paper towel that I was using in the garbage before looking at him. ""I seen you smooching her."" I say, walking out of the kitchen and upstairs. I grab a pillow and blanket from the upstairs closet so he can stay in the spare bedroom. He done wrong, he can be the one to sleep eslewhere.
I walk into the living room and he's sat down on the couch, looking at the tv. When he sees me come in, he sits up straighter and looks at me. I can tell he's getting angry but I don't even care.
""Is there any need of this?"" He asks, looking up at me.
""How could you do that to me?"" I ask. He looks down at the floor. Something in the way he just presented himself tells me this wasn't the first time. ""How long has this been going on?""
""6 months."" He says without hesitation.
""Oh my God."" I say, putting my face in my hands. I sit on the coffee table across from him, too in shock to even have anything to say.
""I was gonna tell you but... I didn't know when the right time would be."" He says, leaning back against the couch, sighing.
""Your joking right? There is no right time to tell your wife your cheating on her.""
""I'm sorry.""
""Save it."" I say, getting up and walking to the stairs.
I go upstairs, slip into some pj's and climb into the warmth of my bed. This will be the first time since we got married that Brad hasn't slept in the same bed with me. And I'm strangely okay with it.
 
For some reason I woke up refreshed and ready to start the day. I roll over and look at the clock. 12:00. I scramble out of bed and run to their rooms only to find they aren't there. They're beds are made though. I begin to panic and run down to the kitchen, thinking maybe they came down and tried to get breakfast themselves. They did that once and I walked in to find a whole box of cereal on the floor. I see a piece of paper on the counter when I walk in which calms my nerves a bit.
I took the girls this morning. Figured it would be my last time with them for a while. I don't think I'm gonna be coming home any time soon. Take care of them and take care of yourself. -Brad
I crumple up the paper and throw it in the garbage, slamming the lid. This cannot be happening to me right now. I text Natasha and tell her to meet me at the coffee shop in an hour which I know she'll agree too. She's hardly ever busy. I get ready putting on a simple outfit, straighten my hair and do my makeup. I make my bed and pick up all the dirty clothes then head out for the day.
I walk into the coffee shop and see Natasha sat down waiting for me. I sit down across from her. The shop has a very modern vibe to it and I think that's what we like about it. It's cute and color coordinated. Always busy but yet peaceful.
""What's wrong?"" Natasha asks, pushing my coffee towards me.
""Me and Brad are.. On a break right now.""
Her eyes open wide and she puts her hand over her mouth.
""What why?""
""He's been seeing someone else for like 6 months.""
""Oh my God. So is he staying with you still?""
""No he found somewhere to stay. But that's not even the worst part."" I shake my head.
""Tell me.""
""I went to the doctor a few days ago to see if I was pregnant and I told them to call me when they know.""
""Have they called?""
""No they haven't yet. I'm expecting it any day soon.""
""What happens if your pregnant?"" She asks, looking at me with sorry eyes.
""I have no idea."" I shake my head slightly. If I am pregnant and Brad and I are on a break then I'll be parenting 3 kids all on my own.
""Well you know I'm here to help no matter what."" She says, patting my hand gently.
""Thank you so much."" I smile, looking down at my coffee. Who would've ever thought I'd be in this situation.
After leaving the coffee shop I go to pick the girls up. A trip to the park seems like a good idea. While the girls are playing I sit on the bench and watch them. Their so young. So innocent. I hope they never have a life like mine. I glance at some ladies across from me and see them whispering to each other. Guess words got out somehow. Bet the girl he's cheating with lives in the town. I probably even know her. I never seen her face that well but I know if I were to see her again I'd know her. She did look a little familiar. Someone sits next to me, breaking my attention from the women. I look over and see Chris sat there. He's Brad and mines best friend. We've known him since high school. He was one of the first people I talked too when I first moved here in grade 8.
""He's staying with you isn't he?"" I ask, looking at the girls as they run up to the slide.
""Yeah he is."" He says quietly.
""I figured that's where he would go.""
""You know I'm still here for you."" He says, laying a hand on my leg. ""It's just hard to be there for both of you yano.""
""I know. I'm not gonna ask you to choose or anything."" I say, shaking my head.
""How are they?"" He asks, motioning to the kids. He really care about them too. He is their god father after all.
""They know daddy's gone away for a while. Work related.""
""What an idiot.""
We spend the next hour brainstorming what's gonna happen and talking about the glory days back in high school which when you think about it wasn't that long ago. Longer for Brad than me.
When the girls and I get back to the house I get them out of the car and they go inside. I'm outside grabbing their bags when someone taps my shoulder. I turn around, startled by the contact.
""Hi."" I say, looking at the man. He's covered in paint and is wearing brown coveralls.
""Hey. I'm Josh, your new neighbour.""
""Oh hi. I didn't realize anyone had bought the house."" I smile, shaking his hand.
""It's a fixer upper but I think it could be great.""
""Sure could be."" I chuckle. ""I'd better get inside but it was nice meeting you.""
I walk inside and shut the door behind me. Of course I'd be the one to get a hot new neighbour. I make the girls supper and then we sit down to watch a movie. Frozen is always the movie we watch. I could probably recite the whole movie by now. The movies just started when I hear something scratching at the back door. I get up and go to the door. There's a dog there. He's big too. A boxer. I open the door and look at his collar. Josh's dog. I grab him by the collar, put on some shoes and tell the girls I'll be right back. I go over to Josh's back door and knock. He's sat on his couch, looking at a book or something when he looks over to me. He runs over and opens the door.
""Guess he was a little confused in which house he lived in."" I laugh. I let go and the dog runs into the house.
""Sorry about that. He isn't used to seeing so much grass. Must've got carried away."" He chuckles.
""It's fine. Not often we see dogs on this road anyways. Is it just the two of you living you here?"" I ask.
""Yeah. Guessing it isn't just you over there."" He says, glancing to the house.
""Just me and the girls."" I smile slightly. ""Speaking of which I'd better get back to them.""
""Of course. I'll try to keep my dog in my yard."" He chuckles, closing the door. I wave through the glass before walking away,
I walk across the back yards and into the house. When I walk in the phone is ringing but I don't get it in time. Thankfully they left a message. I know the number is the number to the clinic which sends butterflies throughout my whole body. I play it and it's not what I expected to hear.
I am pregnant.
 
Today the plan is to drop the girls off to school, go to the mall to meet Natasha and later go to an emergency council meeting about the Carnival tomorrow. We do a carnival around this time every year. It's a fun thing for the kids to do and it gets people out and about. The mall is a 30 minute drive outside of town. I walk in and see Natasha sat where she said she would be, a coffee in her hands. Her hair is full of her natural curls and she has a smile on her face.
""You ready to shop?"" She asks, standing up when I get to her.
""It'd be better if I was actually shopping for myself.""
""Hey who doesn't love shopping for community events."" She chuckles. Not me. I'm the one stuck with the shopping every year. Prizes, decorations. I'm even in charge of hiring the vendors and getting sponsors. I'm good with money I guess.
""So how is everything?"" She asks, looking at some shirts. A tie dye station is a new thing we're adding this year.
""Well I'm pregnant."" I say, grabbing a pile of shirts from the rack.
""Does Brad know yet?"" She asks, glancing at me.
""No. Only me and you know.""
""How do you think he'll take it?""
""I have no idea."" I sigh.
""How are you gonna tell him?""
""Once again, I have no idea."" That's not something I really wanna be thinking of right now.

Town Council meetings are sometimes interesting and sometimes boring. Depends on what happened since the last meeting and what event is coming up. I get out of the car and grab my purse before shutting the door. When I turn around I'm surprised to see Brad there. But he isn't alone. Macy Willows is in the passenger seat of his car. She's on the council. She's actually vice president. If I can't make it to a meeting she takes over. Didn't realize that meant husbands too. I realize I'm staring when they both look at me. I walk over to the car and Brad rolls down his window.
""What are you doing here?"" He asks.
""I'm head of the council. Or did you forget already?"" Awkward. ""Will you be staying?""
""No. I have somewhere else to be. Just dropping her off.""
""Well while I have you hear I may as well tell you two love birds the news.""
""What news?"" They ask at the same time.
""I'm pregnant.""
""What?"" Brad asks, a guilty look coming over his face.
""I'm having your child. But don't even worry about it. You just continue what your doing and I'll continue what I'm doing."" I say.
""I am worried about it!"" He yells.
""I think you've lost that right."" I say, walking away and into the building. If acting tough is what I have to do in front of him that's what I'll do even if I'm falling apart on the inside.
I sit down at the head of the table and Macy sits down next to me. Great. Just what I need. Some people whisper while others stay silent. Everyone has to know by now. Brad's truck hasn't been in the driveway lately and we haven't been in public together.
Hardly anyone talks unless they have too and it's actually the quietest meeting I've been too since I became the head of this thing.
As soon as the meeting is over I jump out of my chair and head for the door, ready to get home to bed. Before I can step outside, Macy stops me, a look on her face I can't read.
""I hope we have no hard feelings."" She says, smiling at me.
""What?"" I question.
""I don't want us to hate each other for this little thing."" She says, grabbing her coat off the rack by the door.
""Are you delusional? Your sleeping with the father of my kids. My husband. And you think I'm gonna have no hard feelings?""
""Well yeah."" She chuckles.
""Screw you.""
I open the door and see Brad stood there, about to walk in.
""You can follow."" I say, pointing to him as I walk away.
I get in my car and a tear rolls down my face. What has my life come too?

I pull into the driveway and go in the house. I throw my bag on the bench and throw my shoes in the corner by the door. I creep into the living room and see Josh sleeping on the couch. I asked him to watch the girls since he was the closest person to the house. Not only that Natasha was busy. I lay a blanket over him and go upstairs. Sleeping the day away would be perfect.
 
My alarm goes off at 8:00, later than usual. I roll over and press the snooze button, laying on my back and rubbing my eyes awake. Today is the day of the carnival and after last night I'd rather stay home. I have to be there early since I'm the one making sure things are on track. I glance over and see Jill lid down next to me. She must've crawled in bed with me last night. She does that sometimes. She squeezes her way in between Brad and I and she stays there all night. I get out of bed, cover her up and then go downstairs. When I go down to the kitchen I see Kacey sat at the island with Josh and their both eating bowls of cereal. He must've ended up just staying the rest of the night. I expected him to wake up sometime and go on home. Not that I care.
""What's going on down here?"" I ask, walking to the coffee maker. My hair probably looks like a mess but I don't even care.
""Cereal."" Kacey says, plopping the spoon in her mouth. I chuckle as she smiles down at the bowl.
""Well why don't you go get dressed and take your cereal with you.""
She nods her head and goes upstairs.
""You could've came and woke me. I could've gotten up with her so you could go home."" I say, pouring up my coffee.
""You also should've woken me when you came home.""
""You looked peaceful."" I shrug, sipping the hot drink. Without coffee in the morning I wouldn't be able to function.
""So the carnivals today."" He says, finishing his bowl of cereal.
""You're going?"" I ask, leaning against the counter.
""Yeah my neice and sister are gonna be there. I haven't seen them since I moved here.""
""Well maybe I'll see you there.""
""Maybe."" He smiles.
He gets off the stool and walks out the back door, leaving me feeling surprisingly happy.

The carnival is going great. The girls are playing a game where you throw the bean bag through the hole while Natasha and I watch. She taps my shoulder and points in front of us.
""Look who's here.""
I look over to see Brad and Chris, looking around at their surroundings.
""Let's go see daddy."" I say to Kacey and Jill. I grab their hands and walk over to them, knowing the girls are gonna see him here at one point or another so we might as well get it over with.
""Hey girls."" Brad says, bending down to hug them.
""Hey Chris."" I smile, hugging him. Completely ignoring Brad is how I'll get through today.
""Can I take them on a ride?"" Brad asks, looking up at me. I simply nod and he takes them away.
Chris and I walk around, making sure everything is going okay. I think this is a good time to tell Chris I'm pregnant. If I don't do it now I might never do it.
""I have something to tell you. And I'm hoping Brad didn't tell you because I wanted to tell you myself."" I say, playing with my hands.
""What is it?"" He asks.
""I'm pregnant.""
""Woah."" He says, his eyes opening wide. ""What are you gonna do?""
""Well I'm currently on holiday from my job. My boss learned of what was going on and she told me to take as much time as I need.""
""So you have no source of money?""
""Its a paid break. Well it is for a month anyways. I'm just gonna work from home."" It's easy to do that when you pretty much have a computer job.
""Well that's not too bad."" He shrugs.
""No I guess not.""
Brad and the girls clue up their fun time and we all walk around together, buying cotton candy and playing random games. But the night is beginning to close in and it's soon time for us to leave. Were in line to get some French fries when I realize that someone isn't with us.
""Where's Jill?"" I ask, beginning to panic.
""I thought you had her."" Brad says.
""I thought you were ordering with her."" I say, brushing a strand of hair out of my face.
""Okay okay, She has to be here somewhere. Let's split up and look."" Natasha says, touching my arm.
I go one way with Brad while Chris and Natasha go one way. We look everywhere with no luck. Thankfully the crowds are beginning to get smaller now and I can see more around me. I text Chris and he has no luck either.
""Theres only so many places she could be."" I say, frustration taking over me.
""We're gonna find her."" Brad says, going to place his hand on my shoulder.
""Don't touch me."" I say, pulling away. A look of hurt flickers on his face but it's slowly pulls away. Right now is not the time for an emotional fight.
The dark has settled in and we still haven't found her, until I see her with Josh. I run to her and pick her up in my arms. Brad's arms wrap around the both of us.
""Don't ever leave us like that again do you understand?"" I say sternly, laying her on the ground.
""Okay mommy."" She says, her face not even looking fazed by what I just said. Chris, Natasha and Kacey rejoin us and the worry has gone away.
""Thanks for keeping her with you."" I say to Josh.
""No problem. She spotted me and that was it."" He chuckles. ""I tried looking for you but.. And I never did get your phone number so.""
""So where's your sister? Did she come after?"" I ask.
""Yeah they're in the washrooms.""
We wait with him and then after a minute I can hear voices coming out from the washrooms.
""Meghan, this is my sister and her daughter.""
I turn around and I almost faint at who I see in front of me.
 
Macy. Macy has a daughter. How come I never knew this? How come no one in the town told me this?
""You?"" I ask, disgust coming all over my face. Macy has the same look on her face but hers is more evil looking than mine. Mine is just pure hatred. Hers is 'I'm sleeping with your husband'.
""Am I missing something?"" Josh asks, looking back and forth between the two of us.
""Your sister is the one my husband left me for."" I say, grabbing the girls and walking away.
I need to get out of here. I put them into the car and pull out of the parking lot. Thankfully Natasha drove her own vehicle or I wouldn't have been able to leave as fast as I did. We get home in 20 minutes and straight away they go to bed. A long day made them and me tired. I go to my room and get in the shower. Washing away my life is something I wish I could do. I get out of the shower, put on my comfiest pj's and head downstairs to pop popcorn and catch up on my Grey's Anatomy. I would normally have a cup of coffee now but where I'm pregnant I've stuck to a coffee every 2 weeks. My doctor approved it. I'm just putting the popcorn in the microwave when someone knocks on the patio door, causing me to jump a little. No one ever uses the back door. It has to be Josh.
""Come in."" I yell.
He comes in and stands in the door way of the kitchen.
""I didn't know."" He says, a look of guilt on his face.
""I know you didn't."" I sigh. ""I didn't even know she had a kid.""
""No one does really. She spends most of her time with her dad out of town. Macy lost custody during the breakup and gets her three times a month.""
""I couldn't imagine.""
""I can't believe she did that to your family.""
""Bd thing happens I guess."" I chuckle.
Josh joins me and we spend the night sitting on the couch watch Grey's Anatomy and enjoying each others company.

When I wake up the next morning Josh is gone and I'm still on the couch. The girls aren't awake yet which is great. I get up and put the blankets away, bring my pillow upstairs and clean up the food. We always do church on Sunday mornings. It's something we've done since they were born. I put the girls on a movie in their room and then head out to my room to shower and get ready. We look our best to go to church. When were all ready we make our way to the church. Natasha meets us there.
After church there's a big room downstairs where everyone gathers for snacks and to socialize. We don't usually stay but today I wanted too. It's nice to be out of the house. We go down and some people whisper in our direction but I ignore it. I've moved on and I wish everyone else would. The girls are sat a table eating while Natasha and I are stood behind them, chatting to random people who come up to us.
""Brads coming."" Natasha says to me. I look over and see him walking up to us.
""What do you want?"" I ask, trying not to sound too harsh.
""I wanna take the girls for the day. I'll bring them home at 6. Promise.""
I think about it for a moment. It probably would be good for them to spend some time alone with him.
""No later thank 6."" I say.
I smooch them goodbye and watch as my only loves leave with that man.

7:00 comes and the girls still aren't home. This has me a little worried. But then again it is Brad and he isn't very reliable. I slip on my shoes and a jacket and make my way over to Josh's house. We've become close lately which is nice. I knock on his door and within seconds he's there.
""Hey whats up?"" He asks, looking a little groggy like I'd just woken him up.
""Did I wake you?"" I ask.
""No no. Well yes but-"" He's cut off by the sound of a female voice coming down the stairs.
""Oh my."" I say, my eyes opening wide. ""I didn't realize.""
""No no. It's not what it looks like. What did you come over for?"" He asks, changing the subject.
""The girls were supposed to be home an hour ago. I haven't heard from them.""
""You want help confronting Brad?"" He asks.
""Please."" I nod.
He goes upstairs and gets ready to go. When he comes down the girl is behind him. She looks young. But pretty. Kind of like a bimbo though. She's coming too. I guess he didn't wanna leave her at his house alone or something. Josh drives while I sit in the passenger seat and she's in the back. It's all silent except for when I tell Josh what way to turn to get to Brad's house. We make it to his street and an ambulance rushes passed us. My heart begins to race.
""Don't worry. I'm sure their okay."" Josh says, laying a hand on my leg. I stare at for a moment before looking up to see were in front of Brad's house.
The ambulance is in the driveway and Brad is stood in the doorway with Jill in his arms. I get out of car and run across the lawn. Everything seems to be running in slow motion. I grab Jill out of his arms and pull her close to my body. Chris takes her from me and the paramedics push us out of the doorway. I look down and see Kacey on the gurney, a breathing mask over her face. Her eyes are closed and she doesn't look like she's conscious.
""Who are you?"" A guy asks me.
""I'm her mother.""
""You'd better come with us."" He says, laying a hand on my back, pushing me in the direction of the ambulance.

Salam everyone,

I used to like this girl madly when I was a student, but since I was a broke guy at the time, I couldn’t approach her. She was two years my senior.

Fast forward a few years she moved to the West while I was still back home. I found the courage to text her and ask if we could get to know each other.

She didn’t reject the idea, but after a few days, she told me she thought I was a decent man. However, she was very busy building her life in the new country. The time difference also made it hard for her to respond to my messages, and she said she didn’t want me to feel sad or disrespected because of that. So, to protect my ego and self respect, I didn’t push, even though I still liked her a lot.

A couple of years later, I got engaged. I was open with my fiancée and mentioned that I used to like someone, without going into much detail. Sometime during our engagement, my fiancée sent me a screenshot apparently, the girl had added her on Instagram. Since we still had each other from our university days, my fiancée asked who she was. I told her.

My fiancée felt a bit awkward but accepted her request. They started talking, the girl replied to my fiancée’s stories, and they got closer from there.

Eventually, we moved to the same country as her. When we visited her state, she texted my wife to meet up. My wife asked if it was okay, and I said yes. I dropped my wife off at the café before the other girl arrived and waited at a nearby park.

After they got coffee and started walking, the girl noticed me in the park and asked me to join them. Although it was a bit weird, I reluctantly agreed.

After the meeting, my wife felt a little uneasy, she mentioned that the girl was more beautiful and wondered if I might still like her (she was still single at the time). I reassured my wife that I found her beautiful and that I was happy with her.

Long story short, they’re kind of besties now and catch up whenever we visit that state. The girl got married a while ago and recently had a baby. (We also have a baby now, Alhamdulillah.)

The last time I saw her, I checked in with myself and honestly, I didn’t feel much anymore other than acknowledging she’s a good looking woman.

I’m happy with my marriage, my wife, and my baby Alhamdulillah.",3,1751160224.0,MuslimMarriage,4,0.8,False
