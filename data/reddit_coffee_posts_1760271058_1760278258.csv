Not with fireworks or headlines, but with the quiet sigh of a hoe dropped in dry soil for the last time. Across Africa, Asia, and Latin America, the people who have fed the planet for centuries are now walking off their land, selling their tools for scraps, and joining the hungry they once sustained. The collapse of smallholder farming is not a story of sudden disaster, but of slow strangulation.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, over 84 percent of the world‚Äôs farms are smaller than two hectares. They produce about a third of the planet‚Äôs food supply, often on soil that governments and corporations have long written off. Yet the World Bank reports that rural poverty remains crushing. Farmers cannot access credit, transport, or fair prices. Their crops rot in the sun while imported goods fill supermarket shelves under fluorescent lights.

In Kenya, cocoa growers have abandoned their groves after the cost of fertilizer tripled since 2021, driven by inflation and broken supply chains. In India, where nearly 118 million smallholder farmers still work the land, farmer suicides remain a stain on national conscience. Government data shared by The Hindu shows over 11,000 agricultural workers took their own lives in 2022 alone, trapped in debt and despair. The story repeats itself from Guatemala to Ghana. The farmers who once defined the landscape are disappearing, leaving behind ghost fields and half-tended dreams.

In Peru, The International Fund for Agricultural Development warns that rising temperatures and erratic rainfall have erased traditional planting seasons. Crops fail not because farmers forgot how to grow food, but because the sky no longer obeys the calendar. In Malawi, the United Nations World Food Programme reports that over 9 million people, nearly half the country, face food insecurity after back-to-back droughts scorched harvests. The cycle is brutal. The farmers who should feed others cannot feed themselves.

The market does not forgive weakness. Big agriculture swallows the smallholder whole, buying cheap, selling high, and branding the system as progress. It is not progress. It is quiet theft disguised as trade. According to Oxfam, small farmers receive less than ten percent of the final retail price of their crops, while corporate intermediaries and exporters claim the rest. The promise of fair trade has too often been a label, not a lifeline.

Yet the soil still holds potential if the right hands return to it. The FAO and World Bank have begun pushing new models of community agriculture and digital cooperatives. Schemes that connect small farmers directly to buyers through mobile technology, cutting out the middlemen who bleed them dry. In Ethiopia, pilot programs by IFAD have shown that when farmers control irrigation, pricing, and distribution, yields rise by 40 percent within two seasons.

In Colombia, ex-coca farmers have begun converting fields into sustainable coffee farms with support from the United Nations Development Programme, earning triple what they once did under the black market. These stories are not miracles. They are proof that the system fails only when people stop believing they can fix it.

The future of food will not be written by algorithms or faceless corporations, but by hands still calloused from soil. It will be fought on the edges of fields abandoned by greed, where stubborn men and women still believe that growing food is not just survival but rebellion. In the collapse of smallholder farming, the world is watching its reflection fade. A planet where the simplest act of feeding oneself has become a luxury. But there are still seeds left in the dirt, waiting for someone to plant them again.

1o4pwiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/freewill/comments/1o4pwiw/the_confirmation_bias_and_the_illusion_of_free/,The Confirmation Bias and the Illusion of Free Will,"The brain is a machine that does not seek truth ‚Äî it seeks meaning, coherence, and validation of already established models. Among its most persistent illusions is that of ‚Äúfree will‚Äù ‚Äî the feeling that we make choices, when in reality we merely follow neural pathways shaped by biology, experience, and chance. And like any good illusion, it is maintained not by actual evidence, but by a psychological mechanism: **confirmation bias**.

Confirmation bias is an embedded filter through which the mind selectively notices and remembers everything that confirms its existing beliefs while ignoring anything that challenges them. This filter protects us from cognitive chaos but simultaneously traps us in self-sustaining illusions. In the context of ‚Äúfree will,‚Äù it means the brain constantly seeks evidence that ‚ÄúI decided,‚Äù ‚ÄúI chose,‚Äù ‚ÄúI am responsible,‚Äù carefully avoiding anything showing that its choices are merely the result of preceding causes.

For example, when we decide to drink coffee instead of tea, the brain does not track the billions of microprocesses that led to this ‚Äî from adenosine levels in neurons, to olfactory cues, to social associations with the drink. It simply constructs a story: ‚ÄúI wanted coffee.‚Äù Then, through confirmation bias, it remembers only the moments that reinforce this internal version of authorship. All cases where we acted automatically or impulsively are pushed into the shadows ‚Äî ‚Äúthen I simply wasn‚Äôt myself.‚Äù

In this way, the brain becomes its own PR department ‚Äî constantly maintaining the image of a conscious agent guiding its life. The truth, that our decisions often arise subconsciously before we become aware of them, is inconvenient and contradicts the narrative of autonomy. Therefore, it is rationalized, softened, or simply ignored. The brain does not lie ‚Äî it merely blocks facts that would undermine the integrity of the story ‚ÄúI am in control.‚Äù

Confirmation bias is the psychological mechanism through which the illusion of free will is maintained as a stable construct. Without it, consciousness would have to confront the painful insight that it is merely an observer, commenting post hoc on processes that have already occurred in the dark depths of neural causality.

Free will, then, is not proof of human uniqueness, but of human vulnerability ‚Äî of the brain‚Äôs need to believe it has control, even when that control is merely rhetorical decoration atop deterministic mechanics. And as long as this cognitive mechanism continues to reinforce our own story of ‚Äúchoice,‚Äù the illusion will remain unshakable ‚Äî because its very function is to preclude doubt.

1o4pvy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewVoyage/comments/1o4pvy7/why_choose_star_brite_fabric_cleaner_for_tough/,Why Choose Star brite Fabric Cleaner for Tough Upholstery Stains,"Cleaning fabric and upholstery has always been an uphill battle for me, with stains seeming to mysteriously appear on everything‚Äîfrom patio furniture to car seats. That‚Äôs why I was more than curious to try out the Star brite 54132 fabric cleaner spray. Its promise to tackle grime and stains on an array of materials sounded perfect for my endless list of cleaning challenges. Over the past month, I put this cleaner to the test, and spoiler: I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. But let‚Äôs dive into the nitty-gritty of how it performs and what you should know before using it.

**Effectiveness on Stubborn Stains**  
Having two cats and a toddler has made clean fabrics a rarity in my home. I tested this heavy-duty cleaner on my favorite (and unfortunately stained) canvas patio furniture first. After generously spraying and waiting the recommended 30 seconds, the dirt and coffee stains from a morning mishap began lifting without much scrubbing. Even on tougher grease stains in my car‚Äôs interior, this formula made a noticeable dent. The fact that it‚Äôs safe for a variety of fabric types‚Äîpolyester, acrylics, and more‚Äîmeant I could clean quickly without worrying about damaging delicate materials.  

[Check Star brite 54132 price on Amazon.](https://blog.sanue.com/p/b0185som8e/)

**Ease of Application**  
Convenience immediately stood out to me with this cleaner. It comes with a spray nozzle that distributes the solution evenly across larger surfaces, helping you tackle significant areas in one go rather than piecemeal. I also appreciated how smooth it was to use for on-the-spot cleaning. Accidentally spilled my drink on a throw pillow? No problem. I sprayed, let it sit for about a minute, lightly scrubbed with a cloth, and voila‚Äîspot-free fabric without any trace of scrubbing damage.

**Benefits**  
- Powerful stain-removing capabilities, even for tougher marks like oil and grease.  
- Versatile solution safe for all fabric types, from delicate to heavy-duty.  
- Built-in UV protection ensures fabric colors don‚Äôt fade over time.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Heavily soiled or older stains may require multiple applications for complete removal.  
- Larger bottles, while economical, can be a tad bulky for smaller cleaning sessions.  

**Durability and Longevity of Results**  
One thing that caught my attention in the product description was its claim to enhance fabric durability while removing stains. After repeated use on my outdoor polyester upholstery, I can affirm it didn‚Äôt degrade the material‚Äôs integrity. The added polymers that claim to act as a ‚Äúprotective barrier‚Äù also seemed to keep newer spills from clinging, giving me an edge on stain prevention. However, I‚Äôd recommend reapplying periodically to maintain this effect.

**Positives**  
- The UV and stain-resistant polymer feature adds extra value by protecting cleaned areas over extended use.  
- Large area coverage makes it efficient for outdoor patio sets or expansive upholstery projects.  
- Safe and non-abrasive formula ensures fabrics stay intact while tackling dirt.  

**Caveats**  
- It can take more time to rinse thoroughly on densely woven or thick materials.  
- Strong chemical odor lingers temporarily, but it dissipates after full drying.  

**Alternative Products**  
Compared to other fabric cleaners, like 303 Multi-Surface Cleaner or Scotchgard Upholstery Cleaner, this product pushed ahead in versatility and its ability to tackle outdoor grime in particular. While Scotchgard‚Äôs protectant properties are excellent, its cleaning power doesn‚Äôt compare for heavily dirty surfaces. On the other hand, the competition from 303 provides comparable results but lacks the integrated UV protection‚Äîwhich, especially in patio setups under direct sun, has proven to be a standout feature of Star brite‚Äôs formula.  

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
When it comes to overall value, I‚Äôd call this product a smart investment. While not the cheapest cleaner you‚Äôll find, the performance aligns well with its price point. You‚Äôre essentially getting a two-for-one bonus with its built-in UV shielding, making it great for anyone looking to protect their fabrics from both dirt and discoloration. For long-term use, especially on high-traffic fabrics, this cleaner seems like it can save you from premature replacements.

Sometimes when I make a latte, I'll take the extra froth left in the pitcher, pour it in a little espresso cup, and give it to him with a kid's spoon as a treat. He will sit patiently at his table and eat it with a spoon for 10 minutes, as happy as he'd be receiving a cookie. 

It buys me time when I'm making coffee. If you have a toddler ladder in your kitchen you can have them stand on that and ""help"", which makes it even more fun for them since they get to participate. It's a good ""treat"" that doesn't have added sugar or any of the other things that good treats usually have, and allows them to participate in your routine, so a double whammy of fun, and I thought it was worth passing this tip on!

I‚Äôve been holding it in for too long, and it‚Äôs honestly been eating me alive. I feel completely lost and exhausted trying to make sense of everything that happened.

We broke up a year ago, but the truth is, she was always an emotional rollercoaster. One of the biggest reasons things ended was how unpredictable she was she‚Äôd give me thoughtful gifts, things that showed care and effort, and just a few hours later say something like, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think we should break up?‚Äù I was left completely confused every time. I never knew what was real if she loved me, if I‚Äôd done something wrong, or if it was all just a twisted game. Getting affection and rejection in the same breath really messes with your mind.

I used to beg her just to see me, to spend time together. But she would cancel plans at the last minute or act like she didn‚Äôt even want to be there when we met. Eventually, I was the one who ended things  and somehow, she still managed to say I was the one who had used her.

A few days after the breakup, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something was off. Out of curiosity, I downloaded a dating app  and there she was. Her profile was already active, which made me wonder if she‚Äôd been using it even before we broke up. When I confronted her, she said she was only there because she was ‚Äúlooking for her friend‚Äôs ex.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt buy it, but I let it go.

After a year of no contact, she suddenly came back  and all the same strange behavior returned. She‚Äôd ask for random favors, like bringing her coffee at work, and if I said no, she‚Äôd respond, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine, my friend will bring it.‚Äù It made me feel completely replaceable, like I didn‚Äôt matter at all.

Every little favor dragged me back into her orbit  I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was love, manipulation, or some cruel in-between. She‚Äôd ask for sweets, toys, little gifts... and then, out of nowhere, she told me she wanted to have kids.

One night she came over while I was drunk. Things almost went too far, and two days later she said something that completely froze me:
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt force you to have kids, but I could poke a hole in the condom.‚Äù
I didn‚Äôt know what to say. I just froze  part of me wanted to laugh in disbelief, part of me wanted to cry or just disappear altogether.

She kept playing the same games. She‚Äôd make plans and cancel right before they were supposed to happen. Once, she told me she was going out drinking with another guy  but later that same night, she sent me a picture of herself at home. It was all contradictions, like she wanted me to stay confused.

She‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt work,‚Äù and the next day it was, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs now or never. If we don‚Äôt get back together, someone might ask me out this week.‚Äù

I was completely lost  I didn‚Äôt know what was real anymore, what was manipulation, or if it would ever stop.

If anyone‚Äôs ever been through something like this, I‚Äôd really like to hear from you. Being alone with all these mixed feelings and doubts  it‚Äôs a heavy place to live in, and I honestly don‚Äôt know how to move forward.

TL;DR: She manipulated me for over a year with gifts, mixed signals, random favors, and even talked about poking a hole in a condom to get pregnant. I‚Äôm completely lost and confused. Am I overreacting for cutting her off completely?",2,1760277532.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

Just putting this out there because I couldn‚Äôt find my specific problem or solution on Reddit already. 

I buy coffee pods from a non-Keurig company and I have always noticed that the ‚Äúcrunch‚Äù sound of closing the door on the pod is always harsher than the traditional Keurig pods. But, everything was all good. Until about 6 months of this a suddenly pressing 12oz got me like 2-3oz and I‚Äôd be cycling the machine multiple times to get a full cup of coffee. I cleaned the needles, cleaned out everything that‚Äôs removable to clean - problem still was happening. 

Then I tried one of my wife‚Äôs decaf pods (she rarely makes coffee) and it worked just fine. So I got to examining the pod that worked fine and the pod that didn‚Äôt and noticed that the center puncture hole on the top was smaller on mine. So - I now put my coffee pod in, close the lid, open the lid and with my pinky press down on that center hole to open it up a bit more, and presto it‚Äôs back to working as it should. 

So, if you‚Äôre having a similar problem don‚Äôt throw out your K-Brew + Chill or switch coffee pods just yet. Give that a try first.

It's put in a great shift but feel it's nearing the end of its service and maybe the right time for a change.

I drink about four coffees a day, pretty much only espresso, so happy to spend a bit on a decent machine if it'll last a long time. The machine is paired with an EK43 and light to medium roast coffees (mainly lighter). I had a speciality shop for several years so like to think I know my way around a machine reasonably well.

I'm interested in going for something which gives a bit more flexibility with pressure. I've got the opportunity for a GS3 MP with pressure profiling conversion which is about ten years old but well looked after. It would be coming in roughly about the same price as a new Lelit Bianca V3 which seems to be the other interesting option out there just now.

I'm leaning towards the GS3 as it's an LM, saturated group, it's an end game machine and it just has that extra bit of counter appeal, but dunno if this is a bit like buying a used Italian sports car when the sensible option is a new Hyundai.

The GS3 is a bit older but given it's an LM and the parts are well supported I don't anticipate that's an issue. The GS3 also feels a bit excessive for making almost exclusively espresso, but it makes it pretty bloody well. Also aware the GS3 uses more water due to how it controls the pressure but i'll be plumbed in so that's not an issue.

Posts like this sometimes feel a bit like just thinking out loud, but if anyone's got experience running an older GS3 or been through similar buying process recently it would be great to hear your thoughts.",0,1760277218.0,espresso,0,0.5,False

1o4pn9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1o4pn9j/i_met_the_love_of_my_life_through_an_affair_and/,I met the love of my life through an affair and was too afraid to blow up my life.,"By all appearances I have a good life - a great job that I secured through a college education, married my high school sweetheart, a few wonderful kids, an idyllic home in a wholesome community.

Somewhere along the way my wife and I drifted apart. She cheated on me once when we were first married, and we worked very hard to get past that. Couples counseling was important and it helped that I'm someone who is very easy to forgive. A feckless people pleaser to some extent.  We made it through the other side and made a life together. I forgave her but in retrospect I don't think I ever fully recovered and don't think I ever will. 

I blamed myself for playing a part in her cheating on me. I was distant and lacked emotional intelligence during a very difficult time in her life. I didn't actively do anything to hurt her, but my generally passive and stoic nature made it hard for her to confide in me. So, I positioned our lives so I could provide everything possible to make her happy. I became an avid runner, got in shape, learned how to dress myself, and had a moderate glow up as we transitioned to the part of our lives where we had kids. I excelled in my career and proudly marched my way to the fiscal purgatory of the middle class. Got us new cars, a house, all the creature comforts a millennial family could want. 

Things seemed fine, partially because I was always so hyper focused on succeeding. Completing every mission I laid out for myself. That included making sure my marriage didn't fail. 

Then at work, I made a friend. She was married too, had a kid around the same age as mine, and we hung out with the same circle of friends. One day she missed out on a lunch with our other friends, so I invited her to lunch on my own. Things started out harmless, more DMs at work, texting occasionally outside of work. Then the chats became more suggestive, more personal. She confided in me how unhappy she was in her marriage. Her husband did nothing - she felt helpless in a life she created but didn't want. I genuinely didn't think her feelings were as strong as they were until she kissed me. We had a short fling, one that confused me because up until then I considered myself happy. I had achieved so many things I had set out for myself to do, so why would I do something so reckless and emotional?

My friend gave me an ultimatum - either blow up my life for her or I couldn't be a part of it anymore. I knew I wasn't going to ever blow up my life for her. I asked myself if it was because I didn't feel that strongly for her, or if it was because I'd never be able to do something like that to my family. 

I suppose that was the driving force for me to actively seek out an affair here, on reddit. Was I now someone who had affairs? Was I that the kind of person I was, or was this a fluke situation with a friend IRL that I just had to experience and move on?

I browsed the appropriate subreddits and eventually made an ad. I got a surprising amount of messages, some of which were thoughtful enough to warrant a response. But nothing really materialized. I was going through a life-or-death family medical emergency and was just about to give up on finding someone when she reached out to me. 

I got a message from a woman bold enough to open the dialogue with pictures. She was so beautiful I legitimately thought I was getting catfished. I left the messages on read for a day before deciding to answer. 

We started talking on a separate app and immediately hit it off. We exchanged messages for hours. We connected so deeply and so quickly. We agreed to meet right away in person. It was supposed to just be a quick coffee date. A meet-and-greet. What followed was the most intense, loving relationship I've ever had. We talked every day for hours. I started every day by texting her good morning and ended it by texting her goodnight. My every thought was consumed by her and how perfect we felt together. I opened up to her in ways I never did with my wife, any of my friends, anyone else in my life I had ever encountered. 

She was perfect to me. An infectious smile, deeply blue eyes full of warmth, addictively soft lips. A kind soul, cut from the same cloth - a people pleaser, but one who knew how to emotionally connect with people. We had incredible, mind-blowing sex that I still think about every day. 

She had her reasons for seeking an affair. I understood and sympathized. We fantasized about being together one day. I never felt that way with the friend I previously was intimate with. It never felt real, not like this. It genuinely felt like I found my person.

I had no plan. It was easy to think we could just do that for years and years, until we both worked up the gumption to change our situations. I had no intention of leaving my wife, but I found myself actively thinking about all the different circumstances in which I could somehow be with my newfound soulmate. We saw each other multiple times a week. Spent trips overnight together. We were genuinely and truly happy together. Every moment apart felt like the space between the actual story of our lives. 

My wife had been struggling with alcohol for years. She would go on benders, and it got progressively worse after COVID. Whether or not my affair actually contributed to it worsening further, it did start to become untenable and I eventually blamed myself when she became a danger to me and those around her. Drinking and driving. Binge drinking during the day and passing out before noon. Not attending our kids activities because she blacked out. 

It became too much. I tried not to put it on my shoulders, but I knew eventually I would. I had a hard time facing it head on. This confident handle I had on my life started to crumble slowly. It got to the point where I thought the only way to fix my life was to let go of the only person who really knew me and understood me. 

Our relationship wasn't perfect. We both made our mistakes. But she was perfect for me. Every inch of her, inside and out, every word she spoke, every sound she made, every heavy breath she took when we held each other - she was made just for me. 

No one in my situation deserves pity, let alone sympathy. I'll make my life work. I always do. I've never had regrets in my life, not substantive ones anyway. Until now. Not just for myself, thinking about what could have been. But for her, what I put her through, the pain I caused her. And the fact that if I never came into her life, she probably would have already run off with someone else and started building herself a better life. Any other sane man in my situation would have. I know I'll think about her every day for the rest of my life. Some part of me thinks the universe will construct some way for us to cross paths again, as unlikely as it was that we ever met in the first place. That's part of what keeps me going, even if I know deep down it's just a construct in my head. But I will always wonder what could have been. And wish I was with her.  

Sometimes I think I'm a sociopath, and that all of my relationships are a reflection of that. Or I say that to myself as a rationalization for what I've done and the decision to carry all that scar tissue all alone. When I'm old and gray, I wonder what I'll think of myself. And if I ever will forgive myself as easily as I've forgiven everyone around me. 

I just know no matter what happens, I won't deserve that forgiveness. From me, or anyone else.",2,1760277184.0,confessions,0,1.0,False

1) what size rug? Currently we have a 5x7. I think we could go larger but it might be at risk of getting in the way when coming in and out of the doors that lead outside.
2) what color rug/pattern?

I (29F) moved into my current apartment two years ago. We have an elderly neighbor (in her late 70s) who mostly keeps to herself. She gets her groceries and medicines delivered every week, but the newspaper delivery boy only drops the paper on the ground floor. Before I moved in, she used to pay some neighborhood kids to bring it up to her, but they moved away shortly after I arrived. So, I started bringing her the paper every day. I usually ring the bell and leave it at her door, but when the door is already open, we sometimes have a little chat. She often insists I come in for coffee and always thanks me warmly.

I noticed her apartment is filled with pictures of her grandson probably more than 20. To be honest, I thought he was the cutest baby I‚Äôd ever seen. The photos ranged from his baby days to what looked like his 21st birthday. I assumed he was around that age but never asked, and she never mentioned it.

About a year after I moved in, I saw an incredibly attractive guy in our building. I was about 70% sure it was the same kid from the pictures, though he looked older than I expected. When he introduced himself, I found out I was right. We started talking whenever he visited his grandmother, and soon we began dating.

We‚Äôve been together for 8 months now. He‚Äôs met my parents, and everything has been going well. Last week, I wanted him to meet my college friends and my twin sister, who‚Äôs currently in town. We all went out to dinner. Although it wasn‚Äôt explicitly discussed, it was kind of assumed that I would cover the bill usually, when someone introduces their boyfriend to the group, the couple pays.

The dinner went really well. My friends (a group of four) and my sister all seemed genuinely happy for us. I was sharing the story of how I met him and his grandmother. At some point, my boyfriend stepped away to take a call. That‚Äôs when my friend Sara suddenly called me a p*d*phile.

I was honestly shocked. When I asked her if she was serious, she just said, ‚ÄúI know a p*d*phile when I see one.‚Äù I was so disturbed by her words that I excused myself. I paid the bill except for Sara and left with my boyfriend.

Later, she messaged me saying that besides being a p*d*phile, I‚Äôm also petty and cheap. It really hurt. I absolutely despise abusers, especially child abusers, so being called something like that has taken a serious emotional toll on me. I‚Äôm disgusted by her and the whole situation.

What‚Äôs been bugging me even more is that Sara was abused by a family member as a child. So now I keep questioning myself. Did I do something wrong?

My sister and two of my friends are standing by me. Another friend said she doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a p*d*phile, but she finds it ‚Äúa bit creepy‚Äù that I saw him as a baby before we met.

My boyfriend (30M) actually found it funny at first, but after seeing how upset I‚Äôve been, he‚Äôs been reassuring me and telling me it‚Äôs not weird at all.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I know I‚Äôm not a p*d*phile, but it‚Äôs been really upsetting to be seen as one by someone I once trusted.

English is not my first language so pardon me for any mistakes

# **Final Update - 2 months later**

[**Update to not paying for my friends dinner**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Significant_Run1849/comments/1la7cec/update_to_not_paying_for_my_friends_dinner/) 

I have got a lot of questions on why I was using my friend's throwaway account and why not create one If you see the profile you could see my friend's post and another subway surfers post ( posted by another friend of ours ) We just thought it would be nice to use one account with all three of our problems. There is no logical reason apart from we just wanted to. Kinda like a our friend's thing lol If you feel it's fake that's okay too. I am not going to argue with a bunch of internet strangers. I used chat gpt to correct my mistakes and posted it earlier. I was a mess on the day I posted with so many spelling mistakes.

Onto the update Me and my bf went on a short trip after the incident and my friend Sara contacted my bf and rambled about how our relationship is not appropriate and called me names when she saw our photos from the trip on my bf's profile.

We blocked her and our other friend who supported sara.

Life has been good.

I don't know what they have been upto but I sometimes miss them.

Unrelated topic but remember my boyfriend's grandmother ? We threw a suprise birthday party for her few weeks back and we took so many photos with her. She framed one photo of me and my bf with her in her house. Which so freaking sweet.

Also I don't have a twin sister . I just wanted alter some details for privacy and I have seen so many people use twin sister in a reddit story. so the sister in my previous post is my older sister. Really appreciate everyone's advice.

1o4phs6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1o4phs6/am_i_in_the_wrong_here_this_only_2_days/,Am I in the wrong here? This only 2 days,"The past few days have def been rough for me. My manager has basically called me lazy, incompetent and that my work doesnt matter ( more so that i just dont matter) 

And he really expects me to be excited to be here and happy go lucky. Yes i know what kind of industry i am in, but when the problems are inside the building its hard to leave them at the door. Why just because he pays me a paycheck that barley covers what i need for 2 weeks and only have like 10 bucks left before pay day? I could feel tensions when I came into work. It was a weird vibe when i came in. But little did i know what was about to go down for the next 2 days. 

I was told that some people have made complaints (some not a lot, as far as what they showed me it was 1 fucking person ) and that it was stated that i looked like i didnt want to be here. Ok im sorry im not going to be bright eyed and bushy tailed at 7am right as i clock in. I havent even had food or coffee. 

He also stated that i need to be paying more attention to what im doing due to 1 mistake in what 6 months that i made. While the other 3 dumb asses never do their jobs correctly but yeah im the one to blame for everything. 

It was also brought up that i never leave the desk and am always sitting down. (he told me not to really leave and has let me over the past 4 years to be sitting at the desk, due to my bad knee) 

He also said something about me not checking people in at 730am on sunday after a sold out night with no one gone and no house keepers here yet. Apparently I am supposed to tell them to wait like 3 hrs let them sit in the lobby wait and offer them breakfast. Things he has himself told me in the past not to do. 

Also he informed me that he could do my job and that if he wanted to he could fire me. basically saying that im not needed and that he will sleep here and work my shifts and do all his work he needs to do. 

With all this being said, yes it got to me. He like to compile everything all at once even if its things from like 3 months ago and just bombard me with it. I have bad anxiety and have been off my meds for like a month so yeah im gonna stressed out over it. It has a lot to do with the fact that when hes rapermanding me he never lets me defend myself or speak. I just nod my head say ok and go about my day. There is no point in fighting with him, he has put in his mind of what he thinks of me and thats it. I just go about my day and reflect on my way home. 

I was fine I took it as what it was(another lashing that wont matter in a week or so) for the most part it still kind of upset me but also was not feeling good at all,  but yesterday just took the cake. 

I had a guest come in at like 1230 wanting to check in I informed him i did not have rooms ready yet and can give him a message for when it is ready. Also told him to give me a min and let me get with the housekeepers. 

He sat down for a few min got back up in my face bitching about how im going to let him just sit there and wait when he ""knows"" there is something ready. Like seriously dick head??????????

Said guest calls me a liar and says i do have a room because he called yesterday and they told him it would be ok for him to check in. He was a standard king prepaid. We have been told that we cannot modify. We only had a studio ready. (but i did not tell him that) I even showed him the board of no vacant rooms open.

He start arguing and demand the managers name number and email, as well as mine.  I give him the desk email and says every time he comes here he always has an issue with me and no one else. He asks for this and that towels and whatever and he never gets it. ( if you dont tell me the correct room number your not going to be getting anything, I put whatever room you told me on housekeeping and it was empty and clean when they checked)  Well fucker stop coming in on my shift or go to the other 3 locations we have in the area. At this point you just want to bitch to bitch.  He leaves and I go find the manager because they have not let me know what was ready so i can get this fucker out of my face. 

When I went to find them I asked can they please find me a room I have an upset person at the desk and i need a room. And let them also know that he was going to complain on me. 

Manager comes down and starts bitching at me saying that ""I should have found housekeeping to see what room is ready, they have been cleaning since 930. ""And that even if it wasnt ready he could have changed it to a differnt room type."" Ok and its not my job to hunt the housekeepers down."" Now the guest is going to complain and it affects our scores. We just talked about this yesterday, I could seriously fire you right now. Why would you do that and not tell me ? Do you need time off ,Do you need a break?"" Just kept on and on. Making my anxiety go though the roof. 

As was just sitting here taking it like the nice person I am (as he is still exploding at me, and also him not letting me talk) , I tell him it was prepaid and that you have yourself told us you wont change the room. ""When did I ever say that?"" ummmm all the fucking time. and i cant take fucking time off, are you going to pay for my mental health days?? no I think the fuck you are not. As he sees getting very upset honestly I am crying at this point. 

Anyone who knows me knows I will not show emotions to anyone, but even someone as strong as me has their limits. 

As he was going on and on seemed as if he was trying to get an answer out of me becasue i just kept saying ok yes i understand ok yes.  I finally hit a wall. At this point I am in fill on tears and just snapped telling him ""when I am trying to tell you something and explain what actually happened you dont listen you  dont let me talk. Now the guest came in calling me a liar already mad and thats when i went to go get you. Look im fine I will be ok I just need a few mins to reset. I also havent been feeling good the past few days"" 

He finally just walks away not saying anything else, I break down even more. Go to the bathroom take like 5 min and make myself stop crying. Wipe my eyes and face, That guest comes back after about 20 min. I get him on his way. He says he did not send the email. ( yeah i know i would have seen it dumb ass) Im on full blown panic attack at this point with no where to go. 

I stay quiet the rest of the day, manger doesnt speak 1 word to me either. Ya know all of that could have been avoided if you just answered your text and or started checking rooms when you came in at 11am if housekeeping has been working since 930 you could have found me a few rooms you know we always have people trying to check in early. But no all you heard within the 13 min interaction was I did not go find housekeeping and the guest was going to complain. Nothing of the sorts of Hey hes being kind of rude please find a room so i get him on his merry way. 

All I was hearing over the past 2 days was ""I do not matter, My work is not important, I am lazy, and I am incompetent, We arent going to fire you but we could."" 

I commute an hr everyday come in when you need me to work cause i need that o.t but I really dont matter in this company anymore.  

Yes all of this hurt my feelings all its telling me is that for 4 years I have not mattered to this company. And that it would be better off without me. 

Anxiety at a record high in many years, mid shift comes in hes trying to make small talk im not into to it today. I say ok yea and just walk out. 

Im reflecting all the way home still in tears bawling my eyes out. I get home and pretty much go to bed at like 6pm. No dinner (actually didnt eat or drink any water all day) no talking to anyone just sleep.  

You give us absolute nothing to be excited about coming in to work. No benefits, no paid time off, no holiday pay, no rotating weekends, havent had a raise in 2 years, just nothing. So please anyone out there please tell me before i lose my mind why the fuck should I be thrilled to go into a job that im not appreciated at? Tell me what I have to be so excited about. Why because you give me minimal pay with a tiny bit of over time here and there? You seriously dont think I can find another job and be better appreciated and that ""ill never have it as good here as I would anywhere else?"" You dont Think I could build my stamina back up and find a bakery to go back to? You dont think with 20 plus years of customer service hospitality wont find me another good job that pays well and i would actually look forward going into work. 

I have stayed because i fucking care and i like my job. But apparently 3 and half years was just a waste of time. You want to fire the only woman working the desk. I guess I am just that much of a fuck up. 

I think it is most def time to move on. Because at this point all they are going to be doing is looking for a way to get rid of me. They wont let me go because they dont want me filing unemployment aginst them. 

Please someone tell me im not crazy in thinking what i think right now. Am I in the wrong? Do I really matter? ",2,1760276782.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,0,1.0,False

I chose to be single following break up of a relationship to take time to work on self and focus on being a mother.  I'm 49, work full time, doing a masters degree and work out regularly. 
I matched with a 52 yo (M) who had similar interests in things like music which is important to me. His values aligned with mine and he is also a single dad out of that relationship 10 yrs. He said he'd been in 'bits and pieces' of relationships over the yrs the most recent 2 were 6 and 9 months and from OLD
He was v gentlemanly and although we lived a few hrs apart we met halfway for 1st date which was coffee and a walk and then we went for dinner. All good and there was a spark. He made it clear he was interested.  
Conversation was easy and fun throughout the foll week and we arranged to meet again that wknd , he asked. We went to his house as he had made dinner for me. I offered to pay for a meal out but he's a foodie and so I agreed. Was lovely. I stayed the night. We spent the next day together and both communicated our interest in pursuing this. 
The next week we knew we wouldn't get to see each other and we had a video call on the sat night. I had told him about a personal issue I was dealing with in relation to 2 friends. He felt that I was in the wrong (for context I'd lent them some money for a holiday, few hundred bucks) He said that it was a betrayal as one of them wasn't aware. I said I didn't realise that at the time. He said I ""facilitated betrayal"" ! I said do you really think I did something wrong cos I don't. He got quite animated and shouted and said if you don't want my opinion then wyhd you ask?! I said surely I can ask for opinion and not agree with it. He was aggressive in his tone and volume. I said you're shouting at me, please don't. He eventually lowered his voice and we ended the call. I didn't hear from him again that night. 
Next day I knew he was meeting his son and ex partner for a difficult conversation so I msg him good luck with it. He replied thank you. 
Never heard from him again. That was a week ago. I happened to go on hinge last night and he's unmatched with me although I don't tjink/know if he's blocked me on WhatsApp! 
What gives?? I'm not sad just confused. The sex was amazing, we got along well and he made it clear how interested he was. Definitely not married or in another relationship.  I know from his house and just his values he communicated to me.

‚ÄãI own an automatic machine (De'Longhi Magnifica) and primarily drink espresso. I'm looking for a dedicated manual grinder just for my evening decaf espresso shots, to ensure maximum freshness and quality.
‚ÄãMy budget is $50 - $100 (max), but cheaper is better!
‚ÄãSince I'm aiming for espresso, consistency and fine adjustment are key.
‚ÄãI've looked at two options online:
‚ÄãHansek√ºche Manual Grinder (Stainless Steel burrs):
‚ÄãPrice-wise, this is perfect: [Link to Hansek√ºche on Amazon IT] (e.g., Hansek√ºche Manual Coffee Grinder with Stainless Steel Burrs)
‚ÄãQuestion: Is this good enough for the fine, consistent grind needed for espresso?
‚ÄãTIMEMORE (A bit more expensive, maybe a C2/C3 model):
‚ÄãExample link (Timemore C2/C3 or similar): [Link to TIMEMORE on Amazon IT] (e.g., TIMEMORE Chestnut C2/C3 Manual Grinder)
‚ÄãQuestion: Which Timemore model (C2, C3, C3S Pro, etc.) would be the best fit for an espresso-fine grind while still staying close to the budget? I've seen some users suggest the C3S Pro or similar for better espresso performance.
‚ÄãBONUS/Specific Request:
I would prefer a grinder that can be modified to be run with an electric drill/screwdriver (at low speed/torque) since I'll be grinding a single dose every evening and it would save some effort. Do any of these, or other models in this price range (like Kingrinder K4/K6), offer this possibility safely?

**Parsing the Odds: When ""Favoritism"" Means ""Free Money""**  
Let‚Äôs start with the numbers because, in this matchup, the math is as clear as a Croatia defender‚Äôs path to a corner kick. On FanDuel, Croatia is listed at **1.0 odds to win**, which translates to a **100% implied probability**. That‚Äôs not a typo‚Äîit‚Äôs essentially a bookmaker offering free coffee with your bet. Meanwhile, Gibraltar‚Äôs chances? A comically minuscule **0.99%** (1/101). For context, you‚Äôre more likely to find a four-leaf clover while blindfolded than see Gibraltar leave this game with a point.

The spread, courtesy of BetOnline.ag, demands Croatia to win by **4.75 goals** (odds: -180), a line so steep it makes the Colosseum‚Äôs steps look flat. If you‚Äôre betting on Gibraltar (+475), you‚Äôre not just a gambler‚Äîyou‚Äôre a masochist with a lottery ticket. And the total goals? Set at **5.5**, with the under (-111) favored. Considering Croatia has kept **11 clean sheets in their last 14 qualifiers**, the under is about as risky as betting the sun will rise tomorrow.

**Digesting the News: A Tale of Two Footballing Universes**  
Croatia enters this clash as the **group‚Äôs unassailable titan**, boasting 13 points and a defense tighter than a goalkeeper‚Äôs grip on a penalty save. Under Zlatko Daliƒá, they‚Äôve turned home games into a masterclass in efficiency‚Äî**14 qualifiers without a loss since 2013**, including **11 clean sheets**. Their offense? Relentless. Players like Luka Modriƒá and Josko Gvardiol don‚Äôt just play football; they perform open-heart surgery on opponents‚Äô defenses.

Gibraltar, meanwhile, is football‚Äôs version of a participation trophy. They‚Äôve

1o4p2hh,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversalEpicUniverse/comments/1o4p2hh/my_epic_day_at_epic_universe/,My epic day at epic universe,"My friend and I (early 30s) went to epic on 10/10 and we ended up having a 10/10 day!! A lot of our decisions contributed to that and we didn't realize how big of an impact some of those decisions would end up having on the rest of our day so I wanted to share. Here's everything we did with the important stuff in bold

**1. Before even going to the park we decided we weren't going to go on HP.** We knew this ride had the longest line and was down often. I am confident this ride would make me motion sick, even if I took medicine. Therefore we decided to skip. The wait time for this ride never went below 180 mins that day. Even at 9 am, before the park opened ,the wait time was 210 mins. We met some HP super fans in the park later in the day. They said they waited almost 3.5 hours to ride

**2. We decided to stay two nights at Dockside.** We stayed the night before and the night of. My friend is a FL resident. Originally we were going to only stay the night before but ultimately decided to do two nights. Doing one night would have been a HUGE mistake 

**3. We woke up somewhat leisurely.** We were *not* on the first shuttle out by any means. We woke up, got ready, got Starbucks,etc. I think we got to the park around 9:30. There were no lines at the gate. Later we heard that the line to get in right at 9 was huge 

**4. We went straight to Mario world. We got in the single rider line for Mario kart.** The regular line had a 50 min wait. We waited maybe 20 mins to ride. I didn't like the shooting game but the set pieces made up for it. We then went to the DK ride and used the single rider again. The regular line had a 55 min wait, we waited 30-45 mins max. I thought it was a fun coaster and I personally didn't feel like I was being thrown around much. For the rest of the day the lines for these rides never went below 1-2 hours. 

**5. My friend bought a Mario band.** Only one person in your party needs a band in order for everyone to participate in the games. We played all the mini games, got the 3 keys and played baby Bowser's mini game. All of the games were pretty fun and we appreciated that there were lose conditions to most of the games. We didn't beat the clock game. We also rode the Yoshi ride around this time. I think we waited 40ish mins in line. 

6. I got the DK crush float before leaving Mario world. I love banana and was surprised to find it's a layered dessert with frozen banana and pineapple ice cream. The ice cream was delicious. I didn't care for the soda. Also, in case you're wondering you cannot use the DK souvenir mug with hot liquids like coffee. I asked the store attendants this question and they looked at my like nobody has ever asked that before. I didn't get the mug, just the ice cream 

**7. We went to Berk next.** We beelined to Hiccups Wing gliders. The posted wait time was 60 mins iirc. I think the line ended up moving faster than that though. This ended up being my favorite ride in the park. Its a fun coaster with great theming and perfect music.

**8. We ate lunch at spitfire grill.** We split a steak bowl and a pulled pork Mac and cheese cone. Initially I thought the Mac and cheese cones sounded disgusting but it ended up being really, really good. The bread was toasted (not soggy) and garlicy. The mac and cheese was creamy. The pulled pork was good as well. The steak bowl was decent but I enjoyed the cone more. I got Stoic's beer, I liked it. My friend got the mead, they liked that a lot. We ended up sitting and relaxing here for a while here because we were having such a good time taking in the scenery with John Powell's soundtrack playing in the background. One of the highlights of the day

**9. We saw the untameable dragon show.** This was a cute show. The plot is very, very simple but it's worth seeing the animatronics. There's one scene in particular that I think makes the whole show worth seeing 

10. We rode dragon racers rally. Weirdly, I think we waited in line the longest to ride this ride. The posted wait time was 45 mins. We waited over an hour easily. Its a fun ride but it's not worth waiting in line for. Its a very short ride. I wasn't able to do much with the paddles but my friend was sitting in front of me and they were able to roll the entire time. 

**11. We went to HP world next.** We mainly walked around and looked in the stores. The show times didn't work for us so we missed it. This is the only thing we missed that I wanted to do. **If you tell the ride staff that you just want to view the ride queue, they will let you in through the exit so you can walk into the floo fireplaces and see the ministry of magic.** Ultimately, we were disappointed with the HP section. It didn't feel like HP to me. The ride had an incredible set, the rest of the area did not. For context, I am a fan of the core books but didnt see any of the spin off content. Oh also my friend got a green absinthe drink here that was very strong. 

12. We stopped and got a snack at this stand in the hub world that sold Asian snacks. I don't know what the stand was called. We shared a tteokbokki hotdog skewer and bao buns. The bao buns were very good. Pillowy soft bun, crispy chicken and good acidity. The skewer was the worst thing I ate all day. Dripping with grease and the shell was like leather. I only got it because a certain famous food YouTuber said it was good. Unless I had it on a bad day, pass on this. 

**13. We went to Dark Universe**. We rode monsters unchained. The wait time was only 15-20 mins. I'm shocked that there was never a long wait time for this ride all day. Its a super fun ride. I almost wish the wait time was longer so I could have looked at the exhibits in the queue more closely.

**14. We went to the rooftop bar in Hotel Helios and watched the sunset.** By this time of the day we were tired and hungry. We need to sit for a little while. This was the perfect spot. The bar overlooks the entire park and has a balcony. I don't know how many people know this place exists! You don't need to be a hotel guest to go. Our drinks were VERY good and  honestly about the same price we were paying for drinks inside the park. Just fancier! 

15. At this point we split up to finish a few things. When we first went to Dark Universe, the line for werewolf was long. By the time we were done at the bar it was shorter so my friend went to go ride. They said it was fun but too short. Probably not worth waiting more than an hour for. I went to go buy a hat in Berk. 

**16. We rode stardust racers at night.** Oh my goodness, what a crazy ride. In a good way. There is no lull on this ride. As soon as you sit down it's nonstop. I'm glad I went on it but I'm also glad it was the last ride we rode that day üòÇ. I don't think I could ride anything else afterwards. Both my friend and I thought it was more intense than we expected. We were on the yellow track btw. It's also VERY smooth. I don't know how long we waited because we had to double back to our locker but the line moved quickly

**17. We got Pizza Moon to go.** By this time it was almost 10 pm. Pizza Moon doesn't do takeout *exactly* but you can go in the restaurant, order pizza, have them bring it to your table and then immediately put the pizza in a box and leave. That's what we did. We brought the pizza back to our hotel and ate it in our beds üòÇüòÇ. As someone who is not only from the northeast but from a city that calls itself 'the pizza capital of the US' (that's literally a sign at the airport) I can confirm this pizza is very good. Its not what you would expect from amusement park pizza at all. 

We got incredibly lucky with the weather. It was supposed to rain all day with passing thunderstorms. Instead it was sunny most of the day with one or two passing showers. 

It ended up being an epic day!! ",3,1760275663.0,UniversalEpicUniverse,1,1.0,False

Looking some advice to check if I‚Äôm insane or what I should do!

I‚Äôm currently going through a bad time with my marriage.  My wife is 39F and my self Male 38.

My wife is constantly monitoring what I say and do on social media/tracking my devices and that has been the way it‚Äôs always been throughout our marriage.  

It‚Äôs recently irked me and frustrated me.  I‚Äôm constantly having to watch what I say and do in case I say something that she might over react about.

Disclaimer I did admit to cheating before we got married to an ex GF.  I admitted because the guilt killed me and I couldn‚Äôt cope!  However I‚Äôve never came close to or wanted to cheat again because I know what that guilt done to me before. 

But still to this day she‚Äôs always challenging me or feel like I‚Äôm being checked because she believes I‚Äôm cheating.

Recently she bought an audio recorder which I found.  This happened days after a fight where she believed I was having a phone call and was shady about it.  She claims it was for work.  It‚Äôs still in her work laptop bag and hasn‚Äôt been ‚Äúdeployed‚Äù but still the paranoia is still eating me.

Then last week I went for a coffee after the gym.  I left my phone in the car because my pockets are crap in my gym shorts.  She questioned me on it on why i was sat in the car park for so long.

I went to the gym today.  This is the first time I‚Äôve been out of the house all week on my own apart from work.  And I‚Äôm so paranoid about what I might get accused of this time.

I‚Äôve basically realised I‚Äôm afraid to leave the house unless she‚Äôs with me because literally everything I say and do is now scrutinised!

What can I do to end this? I can‚Äôt ask her to stop checking things because that looks like o have something to hide ",1,1760275052.0,relationship_advice,7,1.0,False
1o4otzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cigars_Australia/comments/1o4otzp/what_would_be_in_your_personal_300_sampler/,What would be in your personal ~$300 sampler?,"Inspired by the [discussion around Corporate's $210 cigar bundle](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cigars_Australia/comments/1o4d01l/corporate_cigar_bundle/), **if you had to pick a selection of cigars to go into a bundle at a price point of say \~$300, what would you pick?** The usual advice in the sub is to go into a proper cigar shop and talk to them about what you like, but not all B&M cigar shops are great, and not everyone has access to them, so random orders online may be the only accessible option for some. 

$300 feels like a good cut-off because it's enough to still get a reasonable number of decent cigars given the tyranny of the tobacco excise, but still limited enough that someone just dipping their toes into the hobby won't feel ripped off. Plus, $300 [will clear most Australian online retailer's minimum spend for free shipping](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cigars_Australia/comments/1nv0ia0/buying_cigars_from_inside_of_australia_a/).

At that price point some of the retailers offer packs that appear quite reasonable already, for example: 

* Cigar Box's [$261.65 Mild Starter Pack](https://cigarbox.com.au/products/mild-starter-pack) \- with the My Father Connecticut Corona, La Aroma de Cuba Caribe Edicion Especial No. 3 Toro, San Cristobal Paradiso Elegancia Corona, Nub Cameroon 358 Gordo, and Esteban Carreras Cashmere Robusto - feels like a good introductory sampler. Their [Robusto Sampler for $293.35](https://cigarbox.com.au/products/robusto-sampler) and [$248.90 Corona Selection Pack](https://cigarbox.com.au/products/corona-selection-pack) also look reasonable for someone a bit more advanced looking to expand their horizons. 
* [Cigar Hut's $199 Spring Sampler #1 for $199 ](https://www.cigarhut.com.au/cigar-hut-spring-sampler-1/)is on the smaller side at only 4 cigars, but the selection feels like it would hold up, with the Quai d'Orsay No. 54, Arturo Fuente Hemingway Best Seller, La Palina Double Digit, and Undercrown Sun Grown Robusto.
* [Cigar World's Beginner Sampler of 6 Cigars for $300 ](https://www.cigarworld.com.au/aud/categories/Cigars/CIGAR-SAMPLE-PACKS/?sort=priceasc)also has a good range, with the Oliva Nub Connecticut 354, Arturo Fuente Hemmingway Work of Art, AJ Fernandez New World Connecticut Robusto, Por Laranaga Montecarlo, Perdomo Lot 23 Connecticut Belicoso, and Padron Damaso No. 15. 
* [Andrew's Tasting Pack Volume 2 at the Index for $299 ](https://www.theindexcigars.com.au/collections/cigars/products/andrews-tasting-pack)has the E.P. Carrillo Endure Robusto, Plasencia Alma del Cielo Boreal Toro, The Tabernacle Havana Seed Connecticut Lancero, Montecristo Open Regata, and Por Larranaga Petit Corona. That feels like a good blend of different flavours and sizes, both Cuban and New World, and the most accessible for a beginner IMO. 
* Firmin has a couple of interesting options (albeit limited stock). For example, this [Cigars Humidor on a Budget ](https://firmincigars.com.au/product/firmin-cigars-humidor-on-a-budget/)includes 5 cigars, none of which stand out to me as being amazing - but, at $273.56, comes with a 20-stick humidor to really kick off the craze. Similarly, the 5 cigars that come in the [Cigar and Coffee Sampler ](https://firmincigars.com.au/product/coffee-book-cigar-sampler/)aren't anything to write home about, but at $186.70, you also get a book telling you how to make the coffee you might want pair with your cigar (if you're into that kind of thing).

I‚Äôm 29M and today was one of those days where everything felt heavy. Work sucked, my phone kept buzzing with stuff I didn‚Äôt want to deal with, and even the weather was grey. 

I stopped for coffee on the way home and the barista saw I looked tired, so he just said, ‚Äúrough day?‚Äù in this genuinely kind way. 

For some reason, it made me feel seen in a way that none of my friends or family had managed in weeks.

It got me thinking about how, growing up, I always remembered random strangers being gentle or friendly like the guy who helped me pick up my groceries when my bag broke, the older neighbor who waved every morning for years, a woman who once told me my shoes looked cool on a day I felt invisible.

Looking back, the ‚Äúbig‚Äù milestones like graduations, promotions, or moving cities didn‚Äôt actually stick in my memory as warmth. It was these unexpected, everyday moments of kindness from people I barely knew. 

The effect was so much bigger than I expected.I‚Äôm starting to believe the little acts from random people matter way more than we think, maybe because they‚Äôre proof the world is softer than it sometimes seems.Has anyone else felt the impact of a stranger‚Äôs kindness more than expected?

1o4osgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/1o4osgm/chronic_constipation/,Chronic Constipation,"22F here. This year April I had my first constipation episode. I had blood in my stools. Went to my GP who told me to up my fibre and water intake which I did but made no difference. I was then constipated again and everytime I was I would bleed. I had a rectal examination and she said I might have a tiny internal hemmmie and prescribed me Magrocol/Miralax.
I did everything I could to get rid of this chronic constipation - 2x Kiwi, changing my diet, moving around, excersize, using a foot stool, improving my breathing, prune juice, psylium husk, magnesium glycinate and citrate, b-complex, slippery elm, coffee, herbal teas, apple cider vinegar, cayanne pepper in food. Everything. 
Whilst I did have some success with magnesium citrate and magrocol I don‚Äôt believe these are suitable long-term and I personally don‚Äôt want my bowels to become reliant on them at such a young age.
My stools currently are soft although it‚Äôs so unpredictable when I will be constipated as it happens overnight. I‚Äôm currently having fybogel and have started a carnivore diet, well I say carnivore but I do have some gluten free bread here and there. However, even though my stools are soft they are extremely hard to pass and I think after my countless constipation epsidoes I have an anal fissure or maybe 2 as they feel like theyre stretching from different areas. Every single bowel movement is like glass is coming out of me and it gives me so much anxiety that I am literally terrified to go to the toilet.
I‚Äôve tried Anusol, sitz baths, castor oil, coconut oil, iodine, sudocrem, and vaseline but NOTHING works. I did a few stool tests and the lab told my GP to treat my condition as IBS-C.
I‚Äôm in the UK and I am on a waiting list to see a colorectal surgeon but I just feel so hopeless. Everytime I go to the toilet and can‚Äôt release I just cry lol. I just think back to the times I didn‚Äôt have this problem and how I took them times for granted. 
The worst thing is I have problems with my teeth and can‚Äôt consume a lot of sugar/acidic things as I have a clenching problem so most of my molars are just fractured. So even with natural cures that help other people, I can‚Äôt stay consistent with them because my teeth will literally fail:(

Hey everyone! üôå I was just chatting with a buddy who's diving into the world of content creation‚Äîlike, a total newbie in this wild, wild West of AI tools. And it got me thinking... how many of us are just throwing our hard-earned cash down the drain?

We‚Äôve all been there, right? You hear about the next shiny AI tool that‚Äôs supposed to make your life easier, only to realize you've signed up for a subscription that you barely use. Yikes! Time to pivot!  

**So, here‚Äôs the lowdown on how to work smarter, not harder. üß†‚ú®**  

- **Set A Budget**: This sounds so basic, but like, seriously‚Äîhow many times have you just clicked ‚ÄúSubscribe‚Äù without thinking? üí∏ Set a clear budget for your AI tools. Do you really need that fancy AI photo generator, or could a free one do the trick? A little prioritizing goes a long way!  

- **Do Your Research**: You‚Äôre not going to the supermarket without a list, right? Look for community reviews (like this one!) or comparisons. You‚Äôll often find gems that are affordable yet powerful. And let‚Äôs be honest, there are a ton of students and creators out there that can steer you in the right direction if you ask.  

- **Try Before You Buy**: A lot of tools offer free trials. Use ‚Äòem! üéâ It‚Äôs like test-driving a car before you commit. Find out what works for you without pulling out your wallet.  

- **Utilize Free Resources**: There‚Äôs a sea of free AI resources out there! From tutorials to templates, take advantage of what‚Äôs readily available before spending. Who knew learning could be this fun?  

- **Be Wary of Everything-in-One Tools**: Sure, having everything in one place sounds dreamy, but how many features of that tool will you actually use? Get the real scoop on tools that do one thing really well rather than feeling overwhelmed (and overpaying) for a bunch of features you‚Äôll never use.  

- **Connect with Fellow Creators**: Join forums, Facebook groups, or‚Äîdare I say‚Äîthis community! Sharing experiences and recommendations can save you soooo much cash that you can use for something important, like that nice pizza date you keep missing out on. üçï  

And, if you‚Äôre keen to really dive into the AI deep end, check out this: [Easy Peasy AI](https://easy-peasy.ai/?via=aca). I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs pretty solid for everyone wanting to enhance their AI game (just a heads up, it's an affiliate link, so a little love comes my way if you end up checking it out!). 

**Remember**, we‚Äôve got only a few months left until Q3 wraps up! It's time to get your AI toolkit sorted without breaking the bank. Plus, it‚Äôs always nice to save that extra cash for, I don‚Äôt know, maybe treating yourself to a nice coffee while working on your next big project? ‚òïüí™

3. Marketplace highlight. When in marketplace, the red highlight isn‚Äôt showing and selects a shelf. You have to RB and LB every time to get back to the product.

4. When doing a delivery, no way to see where to deliver to at all (maybe I‚Äôm just a dumby and haven‚Äôt figured it out yet)

5. Stocker, if storage is full, will hold box and not do anything until store shelf opens up or you move box off storage rack for them.

I wanted to add mine so that others will have info to go from. Apologies for the length - I was to make sure I've covered as much detail as I can in case it is helpful

¬†

Timeline:

I initially brought up getting sterilized with my GP last September (2024).

I was there to get my Nexplanon implant replaced as it had run out. Initially she was a little hesitant given my age and not having had any children. And was saying about changing mind and possibility of regret etc, but then suddenly stopped herself and said ""actually, you know what, I wouldn‚Äôt be pushing this hard with a 16yo who was pregnant, and you seem to have looked into this"" so she sent the referral.

¬†

20/01/2025 I was given an appointment with the local health center gyno, and went in prepared with all the reasons I didn‚Äôt want children, the fact I had had Nexplanon for about 10 years, and preference for a Bi-salp due to reduced ectopic pregnancy chance and 80% reduction of ovarian cancer risk.

By the time I got through the stats he stopped be and said he was happy that I was serious, had tried other long term contraceptives and had done my research, but due to my age, it was the local NHS trust policy (North Bristol) to refer for a second gyno opinion. Also advised that he was the only gyno in the local health center, So I would likely have to go to Southmead hospital.

¬†

I received a copy of the letter he had sent in the post a couple of weeks later.

¬†

13/05/2025 I had my appointment with the second gyno. He had read the supporting letter, so advised he didn‚Äôt feel the need to go through all of the bits around having looked into other options etc, so said he would instead focus on the surgery itself, what it would entail and risks.

I once again advised that I wanted a bi-salp, at which point he went to double check with the surgeon that he hadn't missed any info. He came back and added that he had to advise that it would be non-reversable. And that I would only be able to get pregnant after via IVF- which the NHS wouldn‚Äôt cover.¬† I Said ""Good"" which he laughed at and then showed me him typing Bilateral Salpingectomy in the surgical request box. And asked for any planned holidays in the next few months - I advised I had a holiday planned for beginning of October.¬†¬†¬† Again I got a letter summary a couple of weeks later.

¬†

I had a call in august to go through pre-op questions for anaesthetic - and they said at this point that they weren't sure on timescale but I would hear once I reached the top of the list.

¬†

On 26/09/2025 I had a phone call offering my a surgery date. They said they know I get back from holiday the day before but the slots had come up. I asked if I could call back to confirm as I wanted to check with my partner and she said okay as long as it was within an hour.

I called back 20 mins later to accept day for 11/09/2025 (a Saturday).

¬†

Day of Surgery:

I went in at 11 as requested, and they showed me to a private recovery room, with chairs and bit, and advised that‚Äôs where I would be for the day. They said that there were a few people ahead of me so I would likely be going in for surgery about 2pm.¬† The initial nurse ran through basic bits and pieces, asked me to remove jewelry and gave me wrist tags. A little while later the surgeon came in to run through the surgical consent form.

He did ask how many children I had, and when I said none, he went ""oh"",¬† and did ask about my process with getting to this point, and say the biggest risk of the operation was regret. I advised I had spoken to my GP, and 2 Gynos and was very firm in my decision. He also asked if I can considered other forms of contraceptives such as condoms, IUD or Vasectomy (this last point was directed at my partner, who just said that this surgery was about me and it isn't relevant to the convo (My partner will also be getting a vasectomy, I just started things going sooner)).

The surgeon seemed happy after this then asked if I wanted clips or full tube removal, I specified tube removal due to safer etc: he agreed and wrote it down. Signed the consent form and said he would see me after it was all done.

I then told my partner to go home as it was going to be at least another 5 hours.

After this the nurse got me to do vitals and a pregnancy test, and to change into the gown and put on compressions socks and I chilled with a book for a bit.

The anestheologist also came in to run through the sedation process and how that would work.

At about 2.30pm, I was asked to walk to the surgery room, where they got me wired up, inserted cannula, and chatted a little about cats and game of thrones. They reassured me they'd take good care of me and I was out.

¬†

I woke up at about 4pm in the original room I was in earlier, a little groggy, and stomach feeling like I had done wayyy too many sit ups. Nurse asked pain levels I said about 4 - so she gave me some water and a codeine tablet.¬† I recovered from the groggyness quite quickly, got my glasses back, and had some biscuits and a coffee.¬† Because they were fairly please they said I could call my partner to come get me.

The surgeon came back in, said everything had gone very smoothly, tubes came out nicely but that he had noted a little bit of endrometiosis on the pelvic wall. He did specify that it wasn‚Äôt enough to generally cause any concern, or need treatment at this point, but as he dealt with it a lot he recognised and would note down. I will note that I have not really had any symptoms of concern either. He was in a bit of a rush, and left (I assume to go home as was Saturday evening).

The nurse got me to pee, and confirmed she was happy for me to get dressed. I had some bleeding from 2 of the 3 incision sites, so she put a couple of dressings on and gave me some to take home too.¬†

I was not given any painkillers, as she advised I should be ok with ibuprofen and paracetamol, but I was struggling I should get some co-codamol otc.

I asked about sick note - and she checked a realised the surgeon had forgotten it. As he was gone for the day, she said I can call in Monday to the clinic and they will email me over.

I also managed to get a photo of the laparoscopy camera images they had taken- which do show before and after of the tubes being removed, and what I assume is the endometriosis.

¬†

My partner then picked me up, and stopped on the way for the Co-codamol. I was fairly sore at this point, walking gingerly, and some pain in middle and right side if I twisted too hard.

Got home to find my partner had got me flowers, chocolate and prosecco to celebrate (for once I'm allowed alcohol after 24h)

¬†

Recovery:

¬†

¬†

I slept ok, but just on my back. Theres definitely swelling across my abdomen, and I can feel the gas remains sort of bubbling around, with some pain in my ribs and shoulders.

Getting out of bed was quite painful, but once up and about its doable, just need a bit of support going from sitting to standing.

¬†

Work had already ring-fenced 2 weeks off for me, so I am going to ask for this as sick note tomorrow, and I'm feeling better than I was expecting - I'm just not sure I'll be up for the 4 miles of walking that is my commute with a semi- heavy bag.

¬†

Again sorry for the essay, I had read several accounts on here and they had all been very helpful, so I wanted to do my due diligence.¬†

Any questions let me know.

So yesterday I go out to the sunporch and Mark is doing some gardening. And I see he has my Joe Biden mug. And its full of dirt. And he has a little succulent planted in it.

I was like what are you doing?? And he said ""Oh it was just sitting in the cabinet not being used. It has a hole in the bottom now."" HE DRILLED A HOLE IN THE BOTTOM OF MY MUG.

I just stood there staring. He said ""What? Its a good use for it. The plant needs a home.""

I got so mad. I told him he could have used any mug but he used my political one. He knows what that mug means to me. Its not about the politician really its about the principle. We had a rule.

He says I'm overreacting and its just a mug and the plant looks nice. He said ""Its not like I voted for him, I just planted a flower in him.""

I haven't really spoken to him since yesterday afternoon. I'm just so annoyed. He broke our unspoken rule and doesn't even see why it's a big deal.

So be honest... am I overreacting? Should I just let this go? I feel like he knew exactly what he was doing.",0,1760274283.0,AmIOverreacting,67,0.36,False

(Chatgpt won't let me create nsfw anymore üíî)

The sun was out, but soft‚Äîa mellow gold pouring over the city and catching in the curls at the edge of Kryoz‚Äôs hair as he leaned against his car, sunglasses reflecting the bright sidewalk. Smii7y trotted up with that usual half-grin, hoodie sleeves pushed to his elbows, coffee in one hand, phone in the other. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt have to pick me up, dude,‚Äù he said, voice light, but there was a warmth in it that always gave him away.

Kryoz tilted his head, the corner of his mouth lifting. ‚ÄúPlease. You think I‚Äôm letting you take the bus when I‚Äôve got this baby?‚Äù h?e
 said, tapping the hood of the gleaming convertible. ‚ÄúBesides, I like spoiling you a little. You‚Äôve earned it.‚Äù

Smii7y rolled his eyes, though the smile didn‚Äôt fade. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sw WA wwwwuch a sugar daddwwwwa+
‚ÄúGuilty,‚Äù Kryoz said easily, pushing off the car and opening the passenger door with a little flourish. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, I promised you brunch. Pancakes with that ridiculous mountain of whipped cream you love.‚Äù

They slid into the car, radio humming soft indie pop, city rushing past in colors. The wind tangled through Smii7y‚Äôs hair, and he laughed as the convertible took a sharp corner. ‚ÄúYou drive like you‚Äôre in a movie.‚Äù

‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs a movie when I‚Äôm with you,‚Äù Kryoz said, deadpan, but his lips twitched when Smii7y burst into laughter.

The caf√© was one of those small, hidden ones‚Äîbrick walls, plants trailing down from shelves, sunlight cutting across wooden tables. They sat by the window, knees brushing under the table. Kryoz ordered for both, like he always did, with that effortless confidence that somehow made it feel like care rather than control.

When the food came, Smii7y took a bite and nearly moaned. ‚ÄúGod. Okay, maybe you being a sugar daddy isn‚Äôt so bad.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, so now you admit it?‚Äù Kryoz leaned back, smirk tugging wider. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs next? You gonna let me buy you that jacket you‚Äôve been pretending not to want?‚Äù

Smii7y‚Äôs cheeks went faintly pink. ‚ÄúYou notice everything, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly when it‚Äôs about you..?""

The air softened between them, laughter tapering into something quieter. Kryoz reached across the table, brushed a crumb from Smii7y‚Äôs lip, his thumb lingering just a beat too long. ‚ÄúYou deserve good things,‚Äù he said, tone gentler now. ‚ÄúLet me do that for you sometimes.‚Äù

Smii7y looked down, smile tugging shy but real. ‚ÄúYou already do.‚Äù

After brunch, Kryoz dragged him through a record store, pretending to argue over which albums were classics and which were ‚Äúobjectively crimes against sound.‚Äù They tested colognes in a tiny boutique, each one more questionable than the last until Smii7y‚Äôs laughter filled the whole space. Kryoz bought the one that smelled faintly of citrus and cedar, pressed the small bag into Smii7y‚Äôs hands with a wink. ‚ÄúSomething that‚Äôll remind you of today.‚Äù

The day melted into evening. They found themselves on a park bench, drinks from a corner shop in hand, watching the sky shift violet and rose. The city hummed in the distance, soft and familiar.

Smii7y leaned against his shoulder, the contact easy, natural. ‚ÄúYou know, for a sugar daddy, you‚Äôre really bad at the whole power imbalance thing.‚Äù

Kryoz chuckled. ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. You treat me like‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, an equal.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because you are,‚Äù Kryoz murmured, gaze fixed on the skyline. ‚ÄúThe money, the gestures‚Äîit‚Äôs not about that. I just like seeing you happy.‚Äù

Smii7y was quiet for a moment, then reached up, tugged Kryoz‚Äôs sleeve until he looked down. ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù he said, grin returning slow and mischievous, ‚Äúmission accomplished.‚Äù

Kryoz laughed, that deep, warm sound that made Smii7y‚Äôs chest loosen. ‚ÄúGood. Then let‚Äôs call it even.‚Äù

They stayed until the stars came out, just talking‚Äîabout nothing, about everything, about all the small things that made up their strange, perfect friendship that sometimes felt like something more. Kryoz‚Äôs hand found Smii7y‚Äôs without thinking, and when Smii7y didn‚Äôt pull away, neither of them mentioned it.

I'm working through an Archaeology degree in university.

I also work in a coffee shop, which I hate with the burning passion of a thousand suns.

I'm in a long term relationship of 12 years, and with a busy schedule between work and school, I really want for people to talk to about life. Good, bad, favorite music, cool anime, ramblings of what we find interesting, or sharing photos of nature.

**So what if the current job market is thrashy?** That‚Äôs even more why not to rush into OMSCS full-time**.**

Why burn yourselves out for a piece of paper that won't guarantee stability? Taking it slow with a part-time program gives you the best of both worlds - you keep your cash flow, gain real-world experience (be it through internships, jobs, love, holiday, etc.), and let the *learning sink in*, properly. 

Mastery doesn‚Äôt come from cramming, it comes from building knowledge steadily, applying and reflecting them, and then positively and creatively reinforcing them.

1o4odtx,https://www.reddit.com/r/iih/comments/1o4odtx/headaches_after_diagnostic_lp/,Headaches after diagnostic LP,"I‚Äôm so glad this subreddit exists as I had never heard of this condition until I got my diagnosis on 9/10/25. This has all moved so fast for me as it was less than 3 weeks ago I went to the opticians due to visual changes and now I‚Äôm here 3 days after my first LP and my official diagnosis. My opening pressure was 36 & I was taken down to a pressure of 12. 
And basically I‚Äôm wondering if such a drop in pressure is what is causing the headaches I‚Äôm getting now? 

The day of my LP I had no headaches, but had severe backache so much so that by the time the local wore off I could barely walk. 

The second day backache was completely gone, started my day as normal but without a coffee as I took my first acetazolamide & within 45 minutes a headache started that was so bad that I instantly went and lay flat, to which lying down definitely helped but I was so drowsy that I just went to sleep, woke up an hour later & tried to get up again but the pain hit again so I just lay right back down and went back to sleep for another couple hours. I tried to get up again and the headache was still there but definitely not as bad as it had been and eventually eased off. So I decided that it must‚Äôve been the acetazolamide and decided that I would start my course after the weekend as I had a comic con to go to that I had been looking forward to for months. 

The third day was comic con day, no acetazolamide just coffee & painkillers in the morning to hopefully preempt any incoming headaches. The car ride to where I was going was excruciating but after around 40mins of walking about my headache completely cleared and I managed to enjoy the day. By the time I got home, sat down & rested for a while the headache came back with a vengeance so I lay flat and the headache instantly went away and I managed to get to sleep. 

Now we are on the present day, I slept well but woke up with the same headache I‚Äôve been feeling and have no respite from it as laying flat doesn‚Äôt appear to help anymore. I understand I may have overdone it yesterday with walking around for 3 hours but for laying down not helping now I‚Äôm completely stuck with this headache and have no idea what to do. I‚Äôve read that these headaches after an LP can last up to 5 days and I know I‚Äôm only 3 days post LP but I‚Äôm worried that my headache symptoms are getting worse as before my official diagnosis I rarely got even mild headaches as all my pain was mildly behind my eyes and mostly in my neck and upper back. 

I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar to this after an LP and what you did to help ease your symptoms as I‚Äôm already nearing my wits endü•≤

Freddy Krueger rice Krispy treats 

Browned butter, black cocoa, food coloring, condensed milk, salted caramel I made with part of the browned butter, crushed pretzels on top, and a little bit of coffee.

I tried my best with the fondant I have to make a basic Freddy Krueger decoration.

I stuck it on with condensed milk, and used black food coloring for shadowing.

The last evening, when work was done, I was roaming around in Reguliersdwarsstraat, the main gay bar street in Amsterdam, when I found a bar which was not so crowded. Inside, there was something like 5-6 elevated tables with tall chairs. I took one table by the window, and ordered something to drink.

After like 10 minutes, two people arrived, a younger guy and his lady friend. The guy was a gorgeous twink. Tall (202), slim and extremely cute and handsome. He was in his mid twenties. That friend couple took a table not so far away from me.

I was first pretty sure that he hadn‚Äôt even noticed me, when he suddenly gets up and starts to walk toward my table. First, I didn‚Äôt realize he was aiming for me, but some milliseconds later, I got aware that that was actually the case.

He said something like ‚ÄúHi, can I maybe ask to help me with something? I have got this bracelet, but I cannot put it on my wrist myself, because the bracelet lock is so tricky to operate without help‚Äù. I got stunned. What? Really? Is he kidding, I thought.

But I said ‚Äúsure‚Äù, and he gave me his hand and the bracelet. It helped him to put it on, and with that I had to touch his hand for something like 10-15 seconds. He said thank you, and immediately walked back to his lady friend.

Then, after another 5-6 minutes, he walked back to my table again, and asked if he could use the electrical outlet on the wall, right behind me, to charge his phone. I stood up, so he could reach the outlet. He then noticed my height and said something like ‚Äúoh you are also tall? How tall?‚Äù then, he put himself back to back with me to compare heights. I said, ‚Äúyes, you are taller, which is not so common for me‚Äù. I asked him where he was from and I think he said Italy. But the conversation never got any momentum. Then he walked back to his table again.

The third time, he came to collect his phone, and he said something like ‚Äúhave a nice evening‚Äù. Then they left, and I never saw him again.

Was I a complete idiot? Why did he ask me to put on his bracelet, when his lady friend was sitting at the same table, and she could have helped him as well?

1o4o7kj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeyondTheBumpUK/comments/1o4o7kj/pushchair_pram_confusion_recommendations_please/,pushchair / pram confusion - recommendations please,"Hi there, wondering if anyone has advice. We're first time parents looking to get a pram / travel system for baby due March. We're starting to look early as we're keeping our eyes on the 2nd hand marketplaces.

**My priorities:**

* Small when folded. The frame would be stored in a shared hallway, we live in a small flat in a converted house with one upstairs neighbour who is happy for us to store it there, so long as it is fairly compact. When baby is older and we're using it with the seat fitted, we might just fold it with the seat and leave it here too. I prefer when they're folded if they can stand on their own, so you don't have to lay them down or balance them.
* I'm small and weak so I'd like it to be relatively light and easy to manage.
* Ideally I'd like it to have a 'one handed fold' feature.
* I'd like it to have a sleep-safe bassinet / carrycot that we could take inside and use in our lounge for naps.

**My partner's priorities:**

* He'd like it to be all-terrain or otherwise appropriate for walks in the countryside.

**What we've looked at in person**  
We went to a buying for baby appointment and I really liked the bugaboo dragonfly and the joolz aer. I liked the 'Yoyo' in theory too but I didn't like how it was more involved to fold (2 handed job). I also like the Nuna trvl lx as the fold is so easy but the sales assistant was less keen on Nuna as they're not as compatible with other car seats, or something? I kind of missed this.

However, when it was pointed out to us that these weren't all-terrain, my partner had a bit of an issue with this... he envisioned doing more walking in the countryside when we have a baby. I am worried that the bigger wheels and bulkier build will make it harder for me to manage on a daily basis: we live in a city and realistically the most use is going to be walks in the park where we live and going for coffee with friends. I wonder if it's really that big of a deal to not have an all-terrain feature - I was thinking he could just carry baby in a carrier if we want to go on a walk that's going to be rough underfoot. He liked the 'bugaboo fox renew' for this reason, and I also liked this as it still has the one-handed fold and does fold up fairly small, but you then have to sort of balance it on its side, and it's bigger, which I am less keen on.

I'm also a little doubtful that these exact models will come up on the marketplaces as they're the newest versions, so I'm guessing we'd be looking at the fox 2/3 rather than the renew, which looks more complicated to fold (not one hand).

If anyone has any good recommendations, whether for the models I've listed here or completely different ones, I'd love to hear them! Would be great if we could find something with the features both of us think are important.",1,1760273330.0,BeyondTheBumpUK,3,1.0,False

My post will be quite long because I want to make everything clear before you decide to message me. Once again, thank you so much.

**I‚Äôm looking for a connection that grows genuinely over time from both sides.**¬†***Whether it turns into friendship or something more, I always value friendship first. because I believe real love comes from the time and effort we put into getting to know each other.

I don't do voice call ! I prefer chatting over voice calls.

**- Age: 26 - 35**

**-**¬†Single (of course)

\- I just hope that if we‚Äôre on the same page, you‚Äôre serious when messaging me. Being serious doesn‚Äôt mean boring - it just means genuinely wanting to get to know each other.

\- I hope you‚Äôll be open with me, because that‚Äôs important for us to build a real connection, right? I don‚Äôt mean you have to open up too much the first time we talk, we can just take our time and slowly get more comfortable and open with each other

\-¬†**Appearance:**¬†5'7 , chubby , glasses, brown eyes, black long curly hair (not natural), I don‚Äôt really judge whether I‚Äôm beautiful or not. I‚Äôm just a simple girl who doesn‚Äôt wear much makeup and prefers a modest, comfortable style.

\-¬†**Personality:**¬†**straightforward**¬†(I‚Äôm straightforward, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt respect you or being rude) , sometime I¬†**swear a lot**¬†and I need people who don‚Äôt get bothered by that or we can do that together. Honestly, I don‚Äôt really know how to describe myself. Sometimes I‚Äôm a very energetic and cheerful person, but other times I‚Äôm quiet and deep in my thoughts and that really affects my mood. Everyone has their own way of seeing me, eople see me differently, depending on their point of view.

\-¬†**Hobbies**: going to museum especially history museum (even though I'm not good at history), reading romance novel, take picture from my phone - i dont have any a digital camera because I take pretty bad pictures, I don't play game much but I like watching Streamer play horror game and learning about that storyline - (Resident Evil, Silent Hill, etc) , love cookinggg so much, I‚Äôm an indoor person, but lately I‚Äôve been trying to find reasons to go out more, to take photos of beautiful scenes and share them on Reddit.

I would like to invest in a car that will stay with me for the rest of my life. I am not talking about a very expensive and hard-to-find car. Rather, I mean a car that is still available today, or was widely available until recently, but is no longer in production. I want to drive it every day (5,000‚Äì10,000 km per year).

I am very tired of modern technology in contemporary cars: a traffic assistant that knows better what driving style is better, or when you need to drink coffee, ‚Äòclose the door‚Äô, ‚Äòopen your eyes‚Äô, ‚Äòslow down‚Äô, ‚Äòchange gear‚Äô. It's a disaster.

My preferences: a limousine-type car, possibly an estate, with a larger engine capacity, petrol or diesel, more power, automatic transmission, I like lots of dials, but electronic dials are also fine, air conditioning, possibly a convertible, comfortable seats... A tow bar for a motorbike. I want to take Chopper with me. I want the car to be presentable too.

I'm not that knowledgeable about cars, so I'm asking for your help in choosing one. I would like to buy a car next year, so there's no rush. Before I start driving it, I intend to renovate it and bring it to the best possible technical condition. So it can be a car that is not in working order. It is important that parts are available.

My choices are: Audi A8 or Mercedes (there are more options here). But other proven brands are also possible. Reliability is important to me. I would not like to visit the garage for repairs too often.

I am sure I will find people here who know their stuff and will help me make a decision. Best regards.",5,1760273241.0,whatcarshouldIbuy,30,0.86,False

And honestly? I'm not even mad about it.

Here's the thing‚Äîtaking care of your health shouldn't require selling a kidney. Yet somehow, quality supplements and wellness products always seem to come with price tags that make you wince. That's where **iHerb promo code OPG9367** comes in, and trust me, this little code has saved me more money than I care to admit.

# Why iHerb Should Be Your Go-To Wellness Shop

I stumbled onto iHerb a couple years back when I was desperately searching for decent probiotics that wouldn't cost me half a paycheck. What I found was basically a wellness wonderland with over **30,000 products** from more than 1,200 brands. We're talking supplements, vitamins, skincare, sports nutrition, organic food‚Äîyou name it.

The selection is genuinely impressive. Whether you're hunting for that obscure herb your naturopath mentioned or just need some solid multivitamins, iHerb's got you covered. And unlike those sketchy supplement sites that make you question if you're buying vitamins or elaborate placebos, iHerb stocks legitimate, tested brands.

But here's what really sealed the deal for me: **their prices are already competitive**. Even before any discounts, they consistently undercut most health stores I've visited. Add in promo code OPG9367, and you're looking at savings that actually matter.

# Breaking Down the OPG9367 Promo Code Magic

So what exactly does this magical code do? Simple‚Äîyou get **10% off your order**. I know, I know, 10% doesn't sound earth-shattering. But stick with me here.

When you're buying supplements, that 10% adds up fast. I recently stocked up on my monthly essentials (vitamin D, omega-3s, magnesium, and some skincare stuff because self-care, right?), and the discount knocked off about $15. That's basically a free bottle of high-quality fish oil. Not too shabby :)

Here's how you use it:

1. **Load up your cart** with whatever wellness goodies you need
2. **Head to checkout** like a responsible adult
3. **Enter OPG9367** in the promo code box
4. **Watch those prices drop** and feel instantly smarter with your money

The code works for both new and existing customers, which is refreshingly fair. Some companies act like loyalty means nothing, but iHerb rewards everyone.

# What Makes iHerb Different From Other Wellness Retailers?

Ever wonder why some people swear by certain retailers while others bounce between stores constantly? It usually comes down to trust and value. iHerb nails both.

# Quality You Can Actually Verify

iHerb doesn't mess around with quality control. They maintain **climate-controlled warehouses**, conduct regular testing, and ensure products meet strict standards. I'm not saying other retailers are selling snake oil, but... okay, some of them probably are. iHerb's transparency with product information, reviews, and certifications makes me feel way more confident about what I'm putting in my body.

# The Review System That Actually Helps

Their review system is solid gold. Real customers sharing real experiences‚Äînot just the ""5 stars, great product!"" nonsense you see everywhere. People get detailed about what worked, what didn't, and why. I've avoided some duds and discovered hidden gems purely based on these reviews.

# International Shipping That Doesn't Suck

Here's something wild‚ÄîiHerb ships to **over 180 countries**. And their shipping rates? Actually reasonable. I've had friends in different countries complain about insane shipping costs for wellness products, and iHerb consistently beats the competition. FYI, they often have free or discounted shipping promotions running alongside promo codes.

# My Personal iHerb Favorites (And Why They're Worth Your Money)

Let me share some products I genuinely love and repurchase constantly. No fluff, just honest takes.

# California Gold Nutrition Omega-3

I've tried at least a dozen fish oil brands, and this one wins. Why? **No fishy aftertaste**, high-quality sourcing, and the price point is unbeatable‚Äîespecially with the OPG9367 discount. My joints and brain thank me daily.

# NOW Foods Vitamin D3

Vitamin D deficiency is weirdly common, and supplementing has legitimately improved my energy levels and mood during darker months. NOW Foods offers **excellent value without compromising quality**. Their 5,000 IU softgels last forever and cost less than a fancy coffee.

# Derma E Skincare Line

Okay, I'm slightly obsessed with their anti-aging products. The **peptide-infused creams** work surprisingly well, contain clean ingredients, and don't require a small loan to purchase. My skin looks better now than it did five years ago, which feels like cheating biology.

# Garden of Life Raw Probiotics

Gut health is having its moment (finally), and these probiotics are legit. They're **raw, contain multiple strains**, and I've noticed significant digestive improvements. Worth every penny, but even better at 10% off.

# Smart Shopping Strategies to Maximize Your Savings

Using promo code OPG9367 is just the beginning. Want to stretch your wellness budget even further? Here's what I've learned through trial and error (mostly error, honestly).

# Bundle Your Purchases

Instead of buying one thing at a time, I plan monthly hauls. This strategy helps me **qualify for free shipping thresholds** and makes that 10% discount hit harder. Plus, you're less likely to pay multiple shipping fees.

# Subscribe and Save Programs

iHerb offers subscription options for products you buy regularly. Combine these with OPG9367, and you're looking at **serious long-term savings**. I subscribe to my basic supplements and never worry about running out.

# Check the Trial Sizes First

New to a product? Grab the trial size. IMO, there's no point committing to a giant bottle of something that might not work for you. Test it out, read reviews, and then go big with your discount code.

# Stack Those Weekly Specials

iHerb runs weekly promotions on different brands and categories. I've snagged **20-30% off** certain items by timing my purchases with sales and using OPG9367 on top. It requires a tiny bit of planning, but the payoff is real.

# The Wellness Products Actually Worth Your Investment

Not all supplements are created equal, and frankly, some are borderline scams :/ Here's my brutally honest take on what deserves your money.

# Essential Supplements That Make a Difference

**Vitamin D3** is non-negotiable if you live anywhere with actual winters. **Magnesium glycinate** helps with sleep and muscle recovery. **Quality omega-3s** support literally everything from brain function to heart health. These aren't sexy or trendy, but they work.

# Overhyped Products You Can Skip

Those detox teas? Save your money. Expensive collagen drinks that promise miracle transformations overnight? Please. Focus on **proven basics** rather than chasing wellness trends that'll be forgotten in six months.

# Skincare That Delivers Results

Clean skincare doesn't have to be expensive. Brands like Derma E, Acure, and Mad Hippie offer **effective formulations** without the luxury markup. Your skin can't tell the difference between a $15 serum and a $150 one if the active ingredients are comparable.

# Common Questions About Using Promo Code OPG9367

Does the code expire? Currently, OPG9367 is active for both new and returning customers. These codes typically run for extended periods, but I'd use it sooner rather than later just to be safe.

Can you combine it with other promotions? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. iHerb's system will automatically apply the best available discount, so you're always getting **optimal savings** without mathematical gymnastics.

Are there any restrictions? The code applies to most products, though some brands or specific promotions might be excluded. I've rarely encountered issues, and when I have, customer service sorted it quickly.

# Why Investing in Wellness Now Pays Off Later

Here's something they don't tell you enough‚Äî**preventive health care is way cheaper than reactive health care**. Taking quality supplements, eating well, and maintaining your body now means fewer medical bills and health crises later.

I'm not suggesting supplements replace medical treatment or proper nutrition. But complementing a healthy lifestyle with targeted supplementation makes logical sense. And if you can do it affordably with codes like OPG9367, why wouldn't you?

The wellness industry loves to overcomplicate things and jack up prices. iHerb offers a refreshing alternative‚Äî**straightforward products, fair prices, and actual transparency**. The 10% discount just sweetens an already solid deal.

# Making the Most of Your Wellness Journey

Your health isn't a destination; it's an ongoing process. Some days you're crushing your wellness goals, other days you're eating cookies for breakfast (no judgment). The key is consistency over perfection.

iHerb makes consistency easier by removing financial barriers. When quality supplements don't cost a fortune, you're more likely to actually take them regularly. When skincare fits your budget, you'll maintain the routine. **Small investments in wellness compound over time** into significant health improvements.

# Final Thoughts: Your Wallet and Body Will Thank You

I never thought I'd be the person writing enthusiastically about a promo code, yet here we are. But honestly, OPG9367 has enabled me to maintain a wellness routine I can actually afford long-term.

Quality health products shouldn't be luxury items. With iHerb's already competitive prices and that extra 10% off, wellness becomes accessible rather than aspirational. Whether you're just starting your health journey or you're a supplement veteran, this discount helps stretch your budget further.

So go ahead‚Äî**load up that cart, enter promo code OPG9367 at checkout, and invest in yourself**. Your future self, looking back from a healthier, happier place, will definitely appreciate it. And hey, if you end up with a bathroom cabinet that looks like a wellness store exploded, welcome to the club. We have great skin and balanced gut flora here.",1,1760273163.0,iHerbCouponsReviews,0,1.0,False

1o4o4as,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1o4o4as/express_impress_vs_touch_vs_pro/,Express Impress vs. Touch vs. Pro,"Hello!

I got the keys for my first apartment and now I am looking for a nice coffee machine. My eye got on the Breville (Sage) machines. I spotted three discounts/deals:
- Express Impress for ‚Ç¨630 ($732)
- Pro for ‚Ç¨641 ($745)
- Touch for ‚Ç¨699 ($812)

I understand the Touch Impress would have like best of both (Impress & Touch) worlds, but that is ‚Ç¨1090 ($1267) and quite over my budget. I don't think the advantages weigh more then the extra money it costs.

My main drinks are milk coffees like flat white and lattes. I don't have any barista experience.

I have read quite some reviews, but it is mostly comparing the Impress with Pro or the Touch with Touch Impress, not these three. And it's also considering the prices, which I totally understand, but the Touch has quite a discount right now and I want to consider that with my purchase.

You guys got any advice for me?

Thanks in advance :)",1,1760273069.0,BrevilleCoffee,0,1.0,False
1o4o3s5,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1o4o3s5/coffee/,Coffee,"*For those who don't know me, I have written for over a decade over at /r/MilitaryStories. I recently [started a free Patreon account](https://www.patreon.com/cw/BikerJedi) where I write about activism, teaching, politics, life and my time in the Army. Enjoy.*

With Dad in the hospital after two surgeries for his cancer and Mom mostly unable to do much by herself and being a major fall risk, someone has to stay with her. She doesn't think so at all, but she is also deep in denial because of the dementia. My son and my wife have been taking turns sleeping over while I and whoever is ""off"" tend the house and dogs. My boy has been a huge help. He normally is anyway, if reluctantly a lot of the time being a teenager full of angst and all, but he has been great lately. So when I asked him this morning to make the coffee because I forgot to set it up last night, I didn't think twice about it. He is almost 18, so it should be OK, right?

I should point out that I HAVE taught the boy to make coffee before. Last time he made it, it was a bit strong, and I made a mental note to talk to him about it but forgot in the rush of the day. That was my mistake. I need to keep a notepad in my pocket to write that stuff down on or something like a proper old person, because I keep forgetting stuff like that. Might be the eight concussions, or maybe all the drugs the VA had me on for decades.

As I'm driving to work this morning, I picked up the Navy travel mug and took a sip. Yes, I'm an Army vet, but I lost my other travel mug somewhere, and this is what we had for some reason - I think a recruiter gave it to the kid. In any case, my day got very strange within two sips. I felt, I don't know, ""floaty"" for a while. Then I felt it. As my heart rate sky rocketed like a meth user getting a fix after days without, I took the third sip and realized my mistake.

This was NOT normal Maxwell House drip. My heart felt like it was made of explodium. I panicked, but then realized all my life insurance was paid up. The wife and kids would be OK for at least ten years if they were smart with the money. Not so sure about the drivers I'd run into when I died behind the wheel though, so I fought the panic that was rising and did my best to maintain control of the car.

Before I really took off into outer space, I was briefly reminded of the coffee we had in the Army. It was borderline illegal because of how strong it was. This is how the US Army wins battles and wars - coffee. It's better for you than the meth the Nazis used. Then whatever I had drank fully kicked in, and it went beyond a mere Army flashback, which I'm sort of used to. From sunny Florida to strong coffee in Iraq to this new reality. Thankfully at this point I was stopped for a long light at a major intersection, or someone would have died.

While waiting for the left green arrow, I was transported to an alternate dimension and gained some insight into it. It was a place of untold beauty and unimaginable horrors. I heard colors and smelled numbers. I tasted the sounds of the classic rock from the radio that drifted across our dimension to this one, and I wept. Time was an illusion, and I was the master of that illusion. I felt emotions mankind hasn't felt since before we invented language and religion. I reached back into time and was able to view the memories of my ancestors ten generations before me. For a minuscule of a fraction of a microsecond, I saw to the beginning of time and understood all. Hawking, Einstein, von Braun, what I knew was so much greater than their wildest imagination.

I sobbed after, having lost the beauty of the universe, probably forever without a much stronger drug than whatever my son brewed this morning. Maybe a I need an Ayahuasca trip next. (Subscribe, maybe I can take that trip sometime!)

All day long I was worried I was going to be pulled out of the classroom and sent off for drug testing or something. I felt like Tweak from South Park, just twitching and jerking all day. I'm sure some kids were wondering about my strange behavior. I've got great relationships with my kids, but I was EXTREMELY happy and energetic today. Lol. I don't know how I taught a coherent lesson on Plate Tectonics, but I did.

The crash came hard. By fourth period I wasn't feeling well, AT ALL. About ten minutes in I was unable to finish what I was working on, and was holding my neck in pain. It wasn't the coffee crash. This post has been silly, and I was still wide awake from what he made. But no - this was the Fibromyalgia. It was hitting hard, and I could barely hold my head up. The weather hadn't been bad lately, so maybe this was stress related. But the flare up was horrible. I kept massaging my neck and shoulders, hopping it would get better. And my fourth period kids - bless their hearts. They could see I wasn't doing well at all, and were genuinely worried. As they sat and did the work for the day, they kept asking me if I was OK. That made me realize how bad I was. I couldn't even hold up my head long enough to type up the lesson plan for next week I was working on, and I was near tears.

Normally, I'd put my TENS unit on at this point, or even sooner. But the new pads the VA sent me are incompatible with the model I have, so no TENS therapy for me today. I took some aspirin, but got NO relief at all. I've been off all the opioids long enough that aspirin actually works a little bit and sometimes even gives me a 10-15 minute ""buzz."" Not today. Finally, about 20 minutes before fourth period ends, I called the Assistant Principal.

Carol. A lovely lady. She and the other AP (also Carol, funnily enough) are running things since our principal is off campus at a meeting. ""*Carol? Are you and the other Carol running things with the boss out? (She laughs) I can't. My Firbro is so bad right now I'm ready to cry. I need to go home after fourth period.*"" My sub shows up as I'm passing out the work for fifth and sixth to do. I make threats of Biblical level harm if they misbehave and then I head home.

I don't mean this paragraph as a sob story, because it is what it is, but I'm out of sick leave now because I've been taking time off to help Mom and Dad and then being sick/unwell myself. So I lost two hours of pay today, and that hurts. A few years ago it would have crippled us. That's how much capitalism sucks. Today it's not a huge deal, because I have managed to save a small bit of money. Anyway, I digress.

I got home safely despite the cramps and nerve pain, and the boy was home. Before I got settled, we went into the kitchen to investigate. Whatever was in the coffee pot was blacker than Vantablack - reality itself was being sucked into the pot. I grabbed it and unplugged it from the wall before the kitchen remodel I just paid off was destroyed, along with us and the rest of the house. Maybe the east coast or the entire Earth. After we rinsed it out, I pulled out the filter. What was in it was not coffee at all. It was black and looked like coffee grounds, but it had the density of uranium and glowed with something that was other worldly. It was several inches thick. Lest the government come after us for something, I quickly buried it in the backyard.

I'm relaxing with a glass of mead after a nap right now, and damn I hurt. I'm also hoping that the buried cake of ""coffee"" doesn't contaminate our well water. But for a few minutes this morning, I was on a journey few have ever been on. I did make sure to re-teach him how to make coffee properly, because I can't be on drug trips like that until after I retire if I want to keep my pension. Maxwell House drip coffee should not project your consciousness into another dimension like that.

Actually, I might dig that up and brew it a few more times. I'll bet I could sell that shit for a lot more money than Starbucks. Then again, I'm trying to be a better person, so maybe not. I don't want anyone to accidentally summon Cthulhu or something. Better not. Then again...

Y'all be good.

1o4o38o,https://i.redd.it/wtk0alubfouf1.jpeg,Praise for Touchy Coffee Uganda Sylvia Achebet (A Fellow Drop),"I cracked open this bag a few minutes ago and decided to try Aeropress first, because I‚Äôve found that because Aeropress is such a forgiving brew method, it greatly reduces mistakes that I can make from the equation, which could screw up the brew and skew my perception. That allows me to get a really good baseline of what a new coffee should taste like (honestly similar to cupping), and how I should tweak water temp and grind size going forward.

I decided on 10:170, 195¬∞, 110 clicks on my 1Zpresso X-Pro, and the James Hoffman Aeropress method (standard, non-inverted, approximately 2:30-3:00 brew time). 

What I got was wonderful - Truly one of the best cups I‚Äôve had in a long time. I was immediately struck by how clean and sweet the flavor was. I‚Äôm not great at identifying tasting notes in coffee, but this was what I‚Äôd call superbly rounded. The acidity was not too tart or sharp, just ‚Äúthere‚Äù, how it should be. The aftertaste was creamy and sweet.

Looking forward to also trying this on my other grinders (Ode with Gen 2 burrs and J-Ultra), as well as on pourover (V60, Kalita Wave Mino, Chemex) and espresso (Flair 58). I have a feeling that this will be awesome on pourover, and probably even juicier! 

Awesome that I have a full 12 oz of this bean to play with. So glad I ordered this.

I used to have OCPD. After working with a therapist, I no longer meet the diagnostic criteria. The type of therapy that helped me the most was a therapy group for childhood trauma survivors. My father and sister have OCPD traits.

Many people have obsessive compulsive personality characteristics. Mental health providers evaluate whether they are clinically significant (symptoms of OCPD). See my reply to this post for the diagnostic criteria for OCPD.

**DISCLAIMER**

Clinicians define cluster C PDs as being driven by fear and anxiety. Controlling behavior driven by malice, narcissism, entitlement, and other issues is not a symptom of OCPD.

**FACEBOOK GROUP**

Loved Ones of People with OCPD Diagnoses:¬†[facebook.com/groups/1497774643797454/](http://facebook.com/groups/1497774643797454/): When you request membership, the admin team will send you a DM on Facebook Messenger within a week. You probably won‚Äôt receive a notification of the message. Go to the ‚Äúmessage requests‚Äù area of Facebook messenger and reply.

**DIVORCE RESOURCES**

I'm providing this information because posts in the Loved Ones sub typically describe partners with abusive behavior towards the OP and their children, and some members are considering divorce or in the process of divorce. Many posts describe partners who are exhibiting signs of one or more PDs, but who are not working with therapists or just using therapy sessions to vent about other people, and partners who seem to feel justified in their abusive behavior.

This is a presentation from psychologists Beth Wilner, a clinical psychologist and divorce mediator, and Kara Anast, a clinical psychologist who has worked with clients with PDs, and performs child custody evaluations:¬†[How Parental Personality Disorders Impact Parenting/Coparenting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P3PJaBfUsM). The PDs they discuss are Borderline, Antisocial, Narcissistic, Histrionic, Paranoid, and Personality Disorders. They are giving advice to lawyers, but there is good content for people thinking about or in the process of a high conflict divorce. They recommend these books:

Susan Boyan, Anne Marie Termini- The Co-Parent‚Äôs Communication Handbook (2017), Cooperative Parenting and Divorce (2003)

Bill Eddy- Don‚Äôt Alienate The Kids (2020), Splitting (2021), BIFF For Co-Parent Communication (2020), High Conflict People in Legal Disputes (2016)

**ADVICE**

I think it‚Äôs best to take some time to learn about OCPD, and consult with a therapist, before attempting an intervention for a loved one who may have OCPD.

This is excellent advice from another member:¬†[Looking for advice on how to properly set boundaries and stand up for myself](https://www.reddit.com/r/LovedByOCPD/comments/1doj2zv/looking_for_advice_on_how_to_properly_set/).

You need to get a therapist for yourself as soon as you can. Everything changed for me when I knew I had someone in my corner who understood and validated me.

Journal these incidents in detail before you act. I found this immensely helpful for me to look at things objectively and see that it was not all my fault. Also good to have a record of things to avoid gaslighting if that‚Äôs happening. Make sure your records are honest and include the bits where you messed up as well, you grow that way.

Make a deal with yourself that you will STOP apologising for things that are not your fault to keep the peace. This is hard, because it means you can‚Äôt make the conflict go away quickly, but things will NOT improve ever if you keep doing this.

Learn to be okay with your partner‚Äôs being disregulated. That is their issue not yours. Have a plan for what you can do to self-soothe or protect yourself. Can you leave the room/house, go for a walk with the dog, get a coffee etc. If it goes on for a long time you will need a longer strategy.

Have scripted responses in your pocket to respond to attacks and attempts to draw you in or elicit an apology. This is why journaling is good because you already have an objective understanding of why you don‚Äôt need to apologise. Eg ‚ÄòI am not going to be yelled at about X, if you keep yelling I will Y‚Äô. ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt see it that way, I‚Äôm happy to have a conversation about it when you are calmer.‚Äô ‚ÄòI understand that you think (reflect what they said), but I don‚Äôt agree that that‚Äôs how it was.‚Äô

Books like Boundaries and Stop Walking on Eggshells are great.

Know that you can‚Äôt fix this person, be prepared to leave, you are not obligated in any way to put up with abuse. Don‚Äôt go to couples counselling IMO, unless they are in a place where they admit they are controlling and are doing their own work. YOU CAN LEAVE THEM. But you will need to address your own boundary issues regardless, otherwise you could end up back in the same position with another controller.

Advice from¬†¬†[American Psychiatric Association:](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/personality-disorders)

Individuals with personality disorders are usually aware that their life is not going well. Approaching a friend about their¬†painful feelings or the frustrations and disappointments in their¬†life, and offering to listen, might be a way to help them¬†consider treatment. If you have had a successful experience in therapy, share that with your friend, even if it wasn‚Äôt necessarily for ‚Äúpersonality problems‚Äù (an off-putting term for many people). Most people with personality disorders enter treatment with another problem, such as depression, anxiety, substance use, a job loss, a romantic break-up, etc. The challenge is to get your friend ‚Äúin the door,‚Äù so to speak, not to commit to long-term treatment at the beginning.

Turns out I was making 5 critical mistakes.","For months, I was stuck in a cycle of absolute exhaustion. My hair was falling out, I had zero energy, and even walking up the stairs felt like a marathon. I was eating spinach salads, taking the iron pills my doctor prescribed... but my levels just wouldn't budge. I honestly started to think something was seriously wrong with me.

The problem wasn't a lack of effort. The problem was I was unknowingly sabotaging myself with common advice that turned out to be completely wrong.

I finally figured out the 5 mistakes that were blocking my recovery, and I put together a comprehensive video explaining exactly what they are and how to fix them, fast. It covers things that my doctor never mentioned, like:

* Why your morning coffee could be making your iron supplements completely useless (this one was a huge shock for me).
* The difference between the iron in spinach vs. the iron in meat, and why one is 4x more effective.
* The single most important nutrient you MUST take with your iron to boost absorption by up to 300%.
* How to find the¬†real¬†root cause of your anemia (it's not always just diet).
* A simple trick to avoid the horrible side effects (like constipation) from most iron pills.

I'm sharing this because I know how hopeless and frustrating it feels. If you're stuck in the same cycle, I genuinely believe this information can be a game-changer for you.

*By Your Humorously Analytical Sports Oracle*

The Indianapolis Colts (-9.5, -300 ML) host the Arizona Cardinals (+9.5, +231) in a Week 6 clash that‚Äôs as lopsided as a pancake on a griddle. Let‚Äôs dissect this matchup with the precision of a stathead and the wit of a late-night host who‚Äôs had one too many coffee-infused energy drinks.

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: Why the Colts Are Football‚Äôs Version of a Free Hug

The Colts are favored by 9.5 points and carry a -300 money line, implying a 75% chance to win (per implied probability). Meanwhile, the Cardinals‚Äô +231 line suggests bookmakers think they have a 30% shot‚Äîa number so low it could describe my chances of surviving a buffet without gaining weight.

Key stats? The Colts‚Äô defense allows just 17.8 points per game, while Jonathan Taylor‚Äôs legs (480 rushing yards, 6 TDs) make him the NFL‚Äôs version of a human forklift. The Cardinals? They‚Äôve squandered a 15-point lead in their last game, and Kyler Murray‚Äôs foot injury has left their offense as reliable as a toaster oven during a power outage.

The over/under is 46.5, but let‚Äôs be real: The Colts‚Äô offense isn‚Äôt exactly a fireworks show. Their 23.8 PPG ranks 22nd in the league. The Cardinals‚Äô defense, meanwhile, is so leaky it could double as a colander. This points to a ‚Äúlow-scoring thriller‚Äù where both teams trade field goals like they‚Äôre at a yard sale.

### 2. Digest the News: Injuries, Collapses, and Why the Colts Are the NFL‚Äôs Version of a Fortress

The Cardinals‚Äô recent loss to the Titans was a masterclass in self-sabotage. They blew a 15-point lead, including a fumble by safety Dadrion Taylor-Demerson that would make a toddler blush. Kyler Murray‚Äôs foot injury? It‚Äôs the final nail in their coffin, unless he‚Äôs secretly training to be a ninja (and even then, ninjas don‚Äôt play football with sprained feet).

The Colts, meanwhile, are riding a four-game win streak, including a 40-6 dismantling of the Raiders that looked less like an NFL game and

A few months ago my very very depressed, anxious, and alcohol addicted partner made the switch from Prozac and vyvanse to Wellbutrin alone. The amount of change I have seen in him feels like a literal gift from the universe. This is such a big thing to say but he legit feels like he is being cured. I am really shocked at how well he is functioning without stimulants, too. 

I similarly have adhd and have had depressions. I do feel as though I am in a phase of my life now where depression is completely in remediation. I have been taking stimulants for 13 years, and Zoloft for 7, and have just been feeling so inspired by how this medicine works for him and others. For me, I still feel wired when I‚Äôm on vyvanse. The effects are nothing like when I first started taking it. It‚Äôs basically my morning cup of coffee, nothing really more or less. I don‚Äôt have complaints, per se, but I do think I could be having better experiences. 

I‚Äôm really interested in trying Wellbutrin, especially as I have severe sexual side effects from Zoloft. The button is fully broken iykwim. I also have the most difficult time losing weight despite calorie counting and working out. I mean it‚Äôs been years. I know Wellbutrin is known to sometimes help with that.

I‚Äôd been chatting with the January ghoster for a while, and he was very intentional about being slow-moving - it was the holidays, and he said he wanted to get to know me before meeting, which I was fine with as I also generally like to take it on the slower side. We finally agreed to meet up for coffee, and picked a place. I had a feeling something was up when I didn‚Äôt get the ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù text like I usually did. When I reached out, the text was undelivered - he blocked me. I reached out a few more times, but for nothing. Luckily I realized that before I went to the coffee shop and got stood up, but it was still embarrassing and hurtful after spending so much time trying to get to know someone.

Cue October - I just redownloaded dating apps after being ghosted by September guy, and got a Hinge message from January ghoster. To give credit where it‚Äôs due, he was immediately apologetic and took responsibility for his actions.

I would not be compromising the quality though. Everything would be high quality and tasty. 

For some background on me, I‚Äôve been working in the restaurant business for 23 years, I‚Äôm 37 years old and I currently manage a successful cafe. 

I have someone who approached me that has around $200k and wants to be my business partner. And is willing to basically go along with whatever I want. But struggling a little to come up with an idea. As in my state there are quite a few Cafes especially in the bigger towns and need to think of something outside the box. 

Some reasons why I think a breakfast burrito spot would be good are..

-Breakfast Burritos where I work now are a top seller

-Minimal waste and high-er margin than some other food items

-Less staff needed/lower labor costs

-Quick and efficient so customers can get in and out quickly and get on with their day

-Would offer  veggie and vegan options. Including a bowl version for ppl that don‚Äôt want a wrap

Only real downsides I can think of would be that it‚Äôs not enough variety.

It brings me to every subsequent recipe with real doubt, and that‚Äôs a real shame.  Am i bring too harsh for one bad recipe?  Not sure what it takes to make a recipe book, but testing each one for, at minimum, proper ratios and pourability, seem to me to be par for the course, whether it‚Äôs the first, or last course.

I started my home espresso journey about a year ago. After a trip to Italy during which many an espresso was drunk, I was left in a deep pit. Back in my home town, there was no good espresso. I thought to myself, that I couldn't justify the price of an espresso machine and didn't bother to do my research. After a while, I forgot all about espresso until a friend's room mate wanted to get rid of their Delonghi Dedica and buy an automatic coffee maker instead. I bought it off of her for 60‚Ç¨ incl. a stainless steel tamper. That afternoon I saw the same machine in a thrift store for 20‚Ç¨ used. Good times. That's how I got started.

I would like to give back to the community by providing a list of advice and methods for using this machine. This list took me from sour, inedible espresso to a great espresso that rivals some of my local caf√©s. I compiled it from various websites and my own experiences over the course of almost a year. Unfortunately I cannot provide links, as I have literally scoured hundreds of websites and videos without the intention of ever writing a guide.

This guide, in short, is supposed to help beginners overcome the limitations and constraints of this budget friendly setup.

*If you want some more ramblings read the code block at the end, otherwise just enjoy the guide (:*

**Delonghi Dedica EC685.M Guide: LET'S GET BREWING**

**Choosing coffee beans**

In my experience, freshly roasted coffee beans are best for the Dedica. Many beans you can buy in your local grocery store have been sitting there for a long time. I've once found a bag that indicated a roast date of more than a year prior. Once beans are roasted, they need to degas for about two weeks. After that you can brew them. I have found a small, private coffee roaster who roasts small batches. When I get my beans, I know they have been roasted a month ago max.

I have never once gotten crema with store-bought coffee beans on the Dedica. The beans from my local roaster give me a thick crema with every shot. Importantly, crema does not equal quality of your shot. It can still be bitter or sour and need more dialing in. I'm no expert on dialing in, so please refer to a guide using your specific grinder. Whenever you change your beans to a new type, you need to dial in again. Sometimes you need to do little adjustments as the beans in your current bag age.

The dedica handles dark roasts best. Medium roasts can be tricky and light roasts are near impossible to be used on the machine.

**Setting the Dedica for water temperature, water hardness and auto-off time**

Press the steam button for ten seconds. You are now entering the settings menu (tier 1). Press the single espresso button and you enter the brewing temperature menu. Press the single espresso button for low temperature, double espresso button for medium temperature and steam button for high temperature. In my opinion, dark roasts are best with the medium setting. Back in tier 1, press the double espresso button for water hardness. Set it according to your water hardness. From left to right, the buttons indicate soft, medium and hard water. Back in tier 1, press the steam button for auto-off time. Single shot button is about 5 minutes, double espresso button 30min and steam button 3 hours. I have gotten better shots with a pre-heated machine, thus I set the auto-off time to 30min.

**Single espresso vs double espresso mode**

You can either brew a single espresso or a double espresso by pressing the corresponding buttons. To state the obvious: for a single espresso you use less coffee grounds and get less coffee extracted. For a double espresso, you get more coffee. There are baskets for single and double shots. It is highly recommended to always do double shots. It produces a more predictable shot and has less variance in taste shot to shot.

**Pre-heating everything and I mean everything**

Start your machine by pressing any button. Let it sit for 20 to 30 min to preheat. My shots taste better once the machine is fully heated up. You can check the temperature by placing your hand on the top of the machine.

Boil some water in your regular water boiler. Put your portafilter head, basket and puck screen in a cup. Pour in hot water and let it sit for around 30 seconds to heat up. While waiting, pour water into your espresso cup too. Alternatively, you can just put your portafilter in the machine and run an empty shot. Catch the water with your espresso cup and let the cup preheat too. Whichever method you used, take the portafilter out. Dry the portafilter, basket and puck screen individually with a cloth. This is important, because a wet basket can pre-wet the coffee grounds before extraction.

**Evening out the coffee grounds with a WDT tool and a magnetic funnel**

Put the funnel on your portafilter, dump in the freshly ground powder. Break up lumps with your WDT tool. I carefully slap the portafilter a little to even out the top of the grounds. There's also a gadget for it, which I don't use. Tamp it. It is highly recommended, that you don't tamp on your kitchen surface, as you will sooner or later dent it. Some people buy expensive rubber mats. I just flip over the little rubber mat that came with my tamper and use that instead. Finally, put on your puck screen. It's not really necessary, but it came with my portafilter and it keeps the shower screen clean.

**Double pre-infusion**

When you start your shot, your machine pours a little water of your grounds before starting the actual water infusion. This is called a pre-infusion. When you press the double espresso button, the machines hums for about 3 seconds and then stops. Right as the machine stops humming, you press the double espresso button again to cancel your shot. Immediately press the button again to start a new shot. This way, more water is pre-infused, wetting the coffee grounds thoroughly. If you only do one pre-infusion you often get more channeling and unsteady flow. The taste of the shot is also a lot better with double pre-infusion. It's a more balanced taste.

**Shot time**

You've probably seen people debate their shot time. Many aim for about 25s. With the dedica, you can throw all that out the window. While it's true that very quick shots are usually sour on the Dedica, the machine often takes upwards of 30s, even 40s per double shot when the grinder is dialed in properly.

**Afterflow**

Once the shot is done, coffee typically continues to flow for another few seconds. After some testing, I couldn't find much of a difference in taste when waiting it out vs pulling the cup out right off the machine stops humming. Sometimes you get a few drops of coffee after the second pre-infusion. Since a second pre-infusion enhances the taste profile, I don't mind the drops.

**Adjust water volume per shot**

When making espresso, many people aim for a 1:2 ratio. This means, that for every gram of coffee powder used, you want to extract two grams of coffee into your cup. The Dedica does not automatically do this. You have to adjust your water volume setting and save it.

First, measure the beans after you grind them. Write down the input and multiply it by two. Now you have your extraction weight. Remove your drip tray entirely, put the scale below the group head and put your cup onto it. Start your shot by pressing the double espresso button. But instead of letting go of it, you keep holding it. As your espresso extracts, keep an eye on your scale. Let go of the double espresso button as you are closing in on your desired extraction weight. The machine will now save the water volume to the double espresso button. To reiterate: the machine does not save the extraction time to the button, but the water volume used.

**HERE ARE SOME BEGINNER FRIENDLY TIPS ON UPGRADING AND MAINTAINING THE DEDICA**

**Hardware Upgrades right after buying**

The Dedica comes with a so-called pressurized basket. Essentially, the basket has a double bottom which forces the coffee through a tiny hole in the bottom. There's good videos explaining the how and why, but bottom line: this produces a slightly below average espresso that isn't particularly nuanced. It's often slightly sour. It's a starting point though, if you cannot afford a grinder at the moment.

*First Upgrade: Non-Pressurized basket (and maybe a new portafilter)*

You do not need to upgrade anything on the Dedica necessarily. However, if you have the additional 10‚Ç¨, buy a no-name basket.

You can spot non-pressurized baskets by flipping them bottom up. If there are a lot of tiny holes on the bottom, it's non-pressurized. Pressurized baskets have only one or a few holes right in the centre.

When buying the basket and portafilter, make sure you buy one with 51mm diameter. Most other machines come with 54 or 58mm diameter.

Bottomless portafilters are nice because you can see the extraction with a mirror, spot channeling and they are much easier to clean. But ultimately, I personally feel that they are more of a gadget. You can just buy a new basket and put it into the portafilter that your machine came with.

*Second Upgrade: Steam Wand*

I'm not a big cappuccino fan, thus I can't go into depth about steaming milk. However, even I appreciated a stainless steel steam wand. You can twist off the plastic steam wand of your Delonghi Dedica, pull off the rubber wand and replace it with a stainless steel wand. You can easily find them on Amazon. Sometimes the stainless steel wand flies off after the second or third jug of milk, so there's that. However, I personally only make cappuccino for christmas when the family is around. Rest of the year, I only drink a black espresso. So I'm not an expert on frothing milk with the Dedica. In my experience, you can only steam three 250ml jugs of milk in a row. After this, the Dedica needs a break.

*Third Upgrade: Drip Tray with Holes in it*

I replaced my drip tray with a 3D printed one off Amazon, which has holes in it. This helps a lot during pre-heating, when I just run an empty shot to pre-heat the group head. The water cannot run through the stainless steel drip tray that the machine ships with. Massive quality of life improvement.

**Maintenance**

Every couple of months, the steam button on your Dedica will light up orange non-stop to tell you that the machine needs a descale. You can still make espresso, but you should descale very soon. There is an official Delonghi descaling solution you can buy. However, you can also just buy a coffee machine descaling solution in your local grocery store. Just make sure it's rated for espresso machines and you're good to go. I've read that just using citric acid as some people recommend, might damage the aluminium hardware inside. However, I have no experience with that.

How to descale: Put the recommended amount of descaling solution in the water tank and fill up the rest with water. But a pot below the group head and steam wand. Start the dedica. Press and hold the steam button for ten seconds. Turn on the steam wand by twisting the knob anti-clockwise. You will hear a rhythmic pumping noise. Water will slowly spout out of the steam wand.  You can twist the steam knob back into its original position and the water will come out the group head instead. I typically switch between the two a few times. Decalcification will take quite a bit. After it is done, empty the residue of the solution out of the tank, wash it and fill up with fresh water. Put the tank back in and press the steam button again. It will now rinse the machine.

**Ramblings and disclaimers at the end**

`Why a guide for a cheap beginner's machine that many will upgrade soon anyway?`  
`Delonghi Dedica is a great beginner's machine that can pull a satisfying shot of espresso. But only if you know what to do. Espresso is notoriously difficult to master on any machine. However, what sets the Dedica apart, are hardware limitations that aren't found in pricier machines. Thus, a lot of advice meant for higher quality machines does not necessarily apply in the same way to the Dedica or it has to be applied in a different way. Because of this, a lot of beginners upgrade to more expensive machines, thinking it's all the Dedica's fault, only to find themselves stuck with different issues on a more expensive machine.`

`Why me? What's the purpose of this guide?`  
`I'm no espresso expert. I'm a beginner myself. As mentioned I've started making espresso about a year ago on the Dedica with no prior experience. I don't have the greatest taste buds, that can distinguish the slightest nuances. I'm content with a simple dark roast that makes an espresso that's neither bitter nor sour.`  
`However, my espresso journey was not too easy. Although there are many reviews of this machine, they are not always practically applicable, but more a hardware review. Many reviews are done by very experienced people who subconsciously do a lot of side steps that aren't always mentioned or use grinders that are more expensive than my car. Thus, a lot of the advice given was lost on me as a newbie. Instead, I scoured the internet, forums, reddit and YouTube videos to piece together advice and develop my own workflow on budget hardware.`  
`I don't always have an explanation for why I do the steps that I will list in this guide. I'm not an expert on the hardware and technicalities. This is a list of advice that improved my espresso little by little. YMMV.`  
`I will keep updating this guide, as I continue to improve my espresso with this machine.`  
`Please feel free to add to this guide, provide technical explanations, links and correct me if I am wrong.`

`Who is this guide for?`  
`Other beginners who are overwhelmed by the wealth of information and the depth of this rabbit hole. ""Man I just want a good espresso and now I've bought five different gadgets, none of which improved anything.""`  
`I think that we should master the setup we have to it's full potential before upgrading. If you are like-minded this guide is for you.`

`What's my setup?`  
`* Delonghi Dedica EC685.M`  
`* Baratza Encore (I would suggest to get the Baratza Encore ESP. If you accidentally bought the old model like myself, there is a way to calibrate the Encore for espresso. You have to open it up and switch a particular screw.)`  
`* Any water boiler`  
`* Bottomless no-name portafilter`  
`* Double shot basket`  
`* puck screen`  
`* WDT tool`  
`* magnetic funnel`  
`* cheap scale for around 30‚Ç¨`

After Toritsuka accidentally knocked over the exclusive coffee jelly that Saiki had bought, let's just say that Saiki decided to punish Toritsuka so that he would learn his lesson.

Saiki made an aura of social repulsion follow Toritsuka, so anyone near him would receive thoughts of quickly moving away from the medium, stores would no longer sell him ""that"", and he wasn't allowed to leave his room.

My hobbies include watching cooking , baking, knitting, sewing, reading, anime, reading manga, reading comic books, reading manhwa, watching cartoons, reading webtoons etc. Those are not all my hobbies you'll have to message me to find out more. I would like to get married eventually. I would like to have kids. I consider myself to be sex repulsed and would prefer a partner who is the same. I am looking for someone kind, caring, accepting, honest, loyal, respectful, someone who makes me feel safe. I want someone accepting because I have some disabilities. They are autism, ADHD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, and schizoaffective disorder. I also have a genetic defect that makes me extremely sensitive to certain things such as caffeine, so no coffee dates. Being accepting of me and my disabilities is a requirement. As for my appearance I am 5'6, 166 pounds (so slightly overweight), dark brown curly hair that is somewhat long, dark brown eyes, and olive skin tone. I am not religious and would prefer someone who is also that way. Also appearance is way too important for me. I am not a fan of physical touch and would prefer someone who is the same.

Hi! It's nice to meet you. I am a 29 year old cisgender asexual/omniromantic female who is looking to meet anyone who considers themselves to be male. My hobbies include watching cooking , baking, knitting, sewing, reading, anime, reading manga, reading comic books, reading manhwa, watching cartoons, reading webtoons etc. Those are not all my hobbies you'll have to message me to find out more. I would like to get married eventually. I would like to have kids. I consider myself to be sex repulsed and would prefer a partner who is the same. I am looking for someone kind, caring, accepting, honest, loyal, respectful, someone who makes me feel safe. I want someone accepting because I have some disabilities. They are autism, ADHD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, and schizoaffective disorder. I also have a genetic defect that makes me extremely sensitive to certain things such as caffeine, so no coffee dates. Being accepting of me and my disabilities is a requirement. As for my appearance I am 5'6, 166 pounds (so slightly overweight), dark brown curly hair that is somewhat long, dark brown eyes, and olive skin tone. I am not religious and would prefer someone who is also that way. Also appearance is way too important for me. I am not a fan of physical touch and would prefer someone who is the same.  I am from New York and would prefer someone from the USA. However I am also open to long distance. Anyway I look forward to hearing from you soon! Also you must like mushrooms, beets, and molasses. Also please make an effort when messaging me. Also I want someone who I am physically attracted to, if you can‚Äôt respect that, don‚Äôt message me",1,1760271686.0,asexualdating,0,1.0,False

After living here for five years there‚Äôs been a sharp uptick in the amount of senior neighbors muttering under their breath or outright confronting my wife and I when we walk to the coffee shop in the morning.

These incidents have ranged from not liking the way our 6lb dog was eyeing the leaves, to being chastised this morning for walking on the sidewalk whilst crabapples had fallen? They always occur around 7am.

Is there something we should be doing differently? We‚Äôre thinking about having kids here but I can only imagine how they would intensify the animosity we‚Äôre encountering. Is there a non-profit funding education about sidewalk rights? Should we be changing our behavior (my wife‚Äôs laugh could be perceived as loud?). Is our mistake using sidewalks in the first place, and we‚Äôd be better off buying a car, driving down one block and double-parking in front of the coffee shop in the morning?

1o4nk6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/OriginalCharacter/comments/1o4nk6c/interview_with_dimitri/,Interview with Dimitri,"That armchair was sinfully comfortable. I would almost forgive this whole charade for it.

""Dimi,"" the General began that morning, ""you scare people, even our own. The Culture Department had an idea ‚Äì we'll bring a few journalists and film an interview‚Äî""  
""Egone, with respect, that‚Äôs bullshit.""  
""‚Äîand show your less professional side,"" he continued calmly, still observing me with his one good eye.  
""Less professional side?"" I rubbed the bridge of my nose. What idiot came up with this? It must be Bl√∂dworm. Either way, that stupid worm whispered it to someone.  
""You know perfectly well what I am,"" I sighed, ""what I‚Äôve always been. This is my life. I can't pretend to be someone else.""

He rubbed his chin with a crippled hand and was silent for a moment. He tapped his cane thoughtfully on the floor a few times, perhaps so his thoughts would march to the rhythm he had so firmly set.

""Show them you can bark more than just orders,"" he turned to me with a short but brutal command.

And so I sit here, slowly melting under the glare of the spotlight, trying not to accidentally scare someone just by my existence. The moderator closest to me, a young rookie, looks as if I‚Äôm about to throw him to the piranhas.

""Mr. Minister-Major,"" he starts, nearly tripping over his tongue just saying the address, ""it is an honor to have you as part of our program today. The viewers, both here in the studio and at home, must be thrilled by such a visit. Thank you!""

The hall fills with lukewarm applause and pained smiles. I try to smile too, but without showing my teeth, and just nod condescendingly.

""So,"" he clears his throat and glances at his notes, ""let‚Äôs start with the questions. A classic one we ask every guest - What does your typical day look like, Mr. Major?""

I had to suppress a laugh.

""Typical day?"" I asked, just to be sure I hadn't misheard.  
""Yes,"" he nodded eagerly, a strained smile on his lips; he knew himself we were playing a farce, ""roughly what time do you wake up? Do you eat breakfast, or not? Do you walk or drive to work‚Äî""  
""Are you planning to blow up my car, Radim?"" I shot a glance at his badge and no longer hid my sneer. This is starting off well. A few audience members chuckled nervously, and the color drained from his face.

""I check it daily, so I‚Äôll answer‚Äî"" I waved my hand dismissively.

""I wake up at half-past four. Because of the briefings. I usually don't eat breakfast, just drink coffee, and often skip lunch, eating only at night after work. I drive to the HQ, go through the papers the assistant left on my desk, light a cigarette, then deal with the day's agenda. I finish around ten, but it often drags on until midnight, especially when there are some ground 'actions' involved.""

I noticed a subtle murmur among the rows of the audience. Actions, of course. Actions that involve broken fingers and muffled screams. I didn't want to seem out of touch with fieldwork; otherwise, I‚Äôd just become a glorified desk rat who occasionally, just to save face, goes to squeeze information out of someone in the basement.

""That is truly relentless dedication to the state,"" he commented, perhaps in the only permissible way.  
""I look like it, too,"" I couldn't resist a quiet remark, ""so, we already know when and where to wait for me with a knife‚Äîwhat else have you prepared for me?"" I tried for a playful tone, but it must have been a misstep. Well, he should have asked better questions.

""How would you like people to remember you?""  
""You‚Äôre talking about me as if I were already six feet under,"" I snorted, ""as... as what I am. Dimitri Groza.""

""And what exactly does being Dimitri Grozou entail?"" the moderator continued.

""Being as strong as a rock and not fretting unnecessarily about things. And now, the next question, I'm truly not one for philosophizing,"" I urged him on. He started rummaging through his notes. For a moment, I caught a glimpse of a densely scribbled sheet of paper with many crossed-out lines.

""What-"" he had to clear his throat again, ""what lie hurt you the most when you heard it?"" he finished, raising his eyes to me with a smile that even pained me.

""That I force things upon women with violence,"" it slipped out before I could think it through. He raised an eyebrow at that. Perhaps he expected me to mention the whispers about my fascination with straps and belts. Or, if he were being naive, that I would lie about what goes on in the basement.

""I have a sister,"" I continued, attempting a nonchalant tone and taking off my beret, ""she practically raised me when our parents died. I'm far from a saint, but I would never allow myself that. To violate someone. I see a piece of her in every woman, after all.""

Wonderful, Dimo, now you've given away another potential target for the anarchists. It's a good thing she's buried in such an inconspicuous place that not even an oracle could find her.

""That's actually beautiful,"" he managed to say, but immediately continued: ""that women remind you of your sister. You must really love her, mustn't you?""

Make a note to myself‚Äîcheck out Radim Such√°nek. Either he's just trying to break the silence in an unfortunate way, or he's provoking me.

""Of course. Don't you love your siblings? If you have any. Blood is thicker than water."" I settled deeper into the armchair and crossed one leg over the other, the tip of my boot now pointing towards him.

""And now, a question many of us ask. Where did you grow up, Minister-Major?"" He ignored my remark and continued as if nothing happened. But I noticed his eyes darting to the metal-reinforced sole and then to the subtle bulge of the holstered weapon on my thigh.

""The countryside,"" I blurted out. They won't get the name out of me. Not after I revealed Ilona's existence.

""So, a green stripe?"" He dared to use our own ranking system against me.  
""Yes, green, brown, and black,"" I agreed, ""pretty good progress towards yellow, wouldn't you say?"" I grinned.

""Time flies, so now let the audience ask a few questions!"" he announced, clapping his hands. One of the spotlight cones moved to the now buzzing seats. For a moment, I scanned the faces, some still wearing strained grimaces or expressions of sad neutrality, and wondered how much this event was a planned euthanasia of my career.

Radim stood up and jumped off the stage floor with excessive speed. With the microphone in hand, he pointed to the audience.  
""Ask away! I'll only call on a few lucky ones!"" he declared with undisguised happiness that he was no longer sitting next to me.

The audience turned into a forest of hands. He searched for a moment before pointing to a girl in a purple sweater. She stood up and accepted the microphone brought by the crew. She wasn't looking at me, but at the ceiling of the room.

""You spoke of strength, Mr. Major, so I wondered if there were moments when even that didn't help you. Who, or what, and how hurt you the most?""

""I could say smallpox. It killed my mother, father, brothers, and sisters. It scarred my face into this spectacle‚Äî"" I grinned and pointed to my face, ""‚Äîand not just that, I have scars everywhere. But honestly? Anarchy,"" I snorted, ""and I don't mean monarchists. I don't mean the resistance. I mean the general mess of the world and life."" I didn't even realize I had dug my fingers into the armrest of the chair. I wasn't going to elaborate further. The hall fell silent for a moment before Radim recovered and signaled for the questioner to sit down again.

""Thank you for your answer,"" she breathed out tremulously, tears welling up.

""Next question‚Äî"" he began scanning the faces in the audience. It took suspiciously long. He couldn't find the planted stooge from the production in that crowd.

From the forest of hands, one emerged waving with more desperation than the others, and the equally lost moderator called on him. When the hall quieted, and he saw the face of the questioner, his eye twitched.

""How can you even sleep at night?!"" the man almost yelled, sitting down without being asked.  
""How?"" I repeated before Radim could intervene.

I folded my arms across my chest and watched the presumptuous man, even though he tried to hide his face behind the edge of his scarf.  
""There are nights when I don't sleep. I smoke cigarettes and stare at the sky. At the sleeping city, those blinking lights. At the silhouette of the HQ on the horizon. But,"" I straightened up and tilted my head to the side, ""there are nights when I fall asleep with a sense of a job well done. So I either sleep or I don't,  if that‚Äôs what interests you.""

I turned to the moderator.  
""So, what now? I'm already trembling with anticipation for what else you have for me.""

""What is your relationship with your author?"" a voice sounded behind my shoulder. I turned around, but all I saw was the darkness of the backstage area.

The hall falls silent. All the lights, except for that annoying spotlight, dim and leave me alone. I am no longer in B√´rnung, no longer in my universe, but instead in the middle of a diorama in a shoebox. A paper cutout, a rough sketch to which is pinned a collage of military uniforms from various regimes, a swatch of rotten browns, photos of combat boots, a few random men with prominent noses. Behind my back breathe references to history lessons, The Starry Hour of Murderers, Mephisto, and M ‚Äì A son of the Century. Somewhere in the distance, an industrial sound similar to a march, interwoven with the affected German of a Slovenian group, plays softly.

""To her?"" I raised a finger towards the ceiling. In the darkness, I can barely make out a few deep eyes framed by spectacle rims.

""I am an archetype bordering on a caricature. I am a superficial knowledge of Italian fascism, sadism, Gestapo and Soviet interrogation. I am the mannerisms of many and no one. I am the knowledge of cruel reality applied in a fictional world. A study for one,"" I tried to summarize the wave of thoughts that the breaking of the walls had given me. That newfound lucidity that was tearing my brain to shreds.

""A study for her. Because it‚Äôs easier to deal with a fictional fascist regime than to watch the real world burn. Maybe she wants to prepare, to see and understand the mechanisms of evil. Which I appreciate, even if she is practically arming herself against me,"" I spread my arms. The pain in my temples was becoming unbearable.

With a groan, I got to my feet and took a few steps across the stage. I was completely stiff.

""What did you expect?"" I yelled into the deserted audience. Dead silence, except for three shy pairs of eyes.  
""An ode? A surprise?"" I was shouting now. My pulse was deafening. They just blinked. Typical.

I had to close my eyes for a moment. The light was becoming blinding.

Slowly, as if from the bottom of a well, the buzzing of the audience returned, and the pain eased. I opened them again.

""Thank you for coming, Minister-Major Groza!"" Radim sang beside me. I stood face-to-face with the smiling masks that were applauding.

""And that's all, dear viewers, those in the studio and at home. Goodbye, and thank you for tuning into our program!""",1,1760271423.0,OriginalCharacter,6,1.0,False
