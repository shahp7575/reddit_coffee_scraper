1il2ckp,https://www.reddit.com/r/TinyHouses/comments/1il2ckp/minimum_amount_of_counter_space_for_tiny_house/,Minimum amount of counter space for tiny house kitchen.,"I'm in Escrow for a duplex with a small, detached outbuilding which has a bathroom that I would like to convert to a ""tiny house"" ADU. I would use it for myself when I visit family and rent it to traveling nurses/furnished finders much of the rest of the time.  I can't AirBnB it in the area due to regulations that prohibit that unless you live on the property 270 days/year.

It is about 300 sq. ft. There is an 8 ft. 3"" long section along the back wall close to the bathroom that I would like to use for a kitchenette.  That wall is 11 ft. high with clear story windows from 7 ft. to 10 ft.  To the left of that space is a 2 ft. x 2 ft. water heater closet.  And next to that closet is the bathroom.

I would like to replace the water heater with a tankless water heater mounted on that outside wall, with appropriate enclosure for weather (this is in the Pacific Northwest).  I want to use that 2 ft. closet for a stacked ventless compact washer/dryer which requires no side clearance.  I've looked into under counter combo washer/dryers and under counter combo fridge/freezer.  They are costly and really don't quite do the job.  In the 8 ft. 3"" space, I would like to place an apartment size 21"" wide refrigerator/freezer on the far right, with a 12"" lower cabinet and counter next, followed by a 24"" oven with a 4-burner stove top and a venting under cabinet microwave above that.  

For the remaining 42"" space, I'm torn between a smaller sink with an 18"" cabinet and 15"" sink and a 24"" base cabinet with 24"" counter space to the left of it; and a 24"" cabinet with a 21"" sink and an 18"" base cabinet and counter to the left of the sink.

I'm leaning towards the larger counter space for food prep, coffee maker, drainer for dishes, but am reading a 15"" sink may be too small for washing pots and pans.  I have a 21"" sink in the laundry room of my primary residence, and it seems 3"" smaller or 15"" for a tiny house kitchen would not be too bad.  If I went with a larger sink, then I would only have 18"" of counter space.

For those of you that live in a tiny house or rent one as an AirBnB or for furnished finders (traveling nurses), Is a 15"" sink too small?  I believe I would want the full 24"" space adjacent to the sink for food prep, etc.",1,1739061652.0,TinyHouses,0,1.0,False

1il25v6,https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1il25v6/is_ux_design_still_worth_it_curious_if_others/,Is UX Design Still Worth It? Curious if Others Feel the Same,"I know others have shared similar experiences, but I wanted to reflect as well‚Äîthese past two years have been the most challenging for me in my UX/UI design career.¬†

I want to set the scene for how I got into the industry‚Äîit was the early 2000s, and I was in high school, glued to Dragon Ball Z. I loved the show, but I also wanted a place to collect and share DBZ content and information. Back then, platforms like Geocities, Angelfire and Homestead let you drag and drop website elements to build a basic site, usually limited to 3‚Äì5 pages for free. Or, if you wanted more control, you could dive into learning HTML and code it yourself. From there, I taught myself how to code and design, sparking my passion for both.¬†

After high school, I was ready to jump straight into the workforce instead of continuing my studies. I ended up spending a significant amount of time in tourism‚Äîa field I genuinely loved. That career path led me to travel and even spend a season working in the snow industry (Ski Field) in North America. But when I returned, I realised I needed something with more long-term growth‚Äîsomething that could truly set me up for the future, or at least I hoped.  
  
I decided to go back to study, relying on my self-taught skills in HTML, CSS and design. With that foundation, earning the necessary certifications to break into the industry felt like a natural next step. In 2010, after completing two diplomas, I was ready to start my career in design. I landed a role as a Web Designer at a small agency, marking the beginning of my journey in the field. At this point, UX design hadn't yet been established as its own role (*or at least not where I liv*e). When you entered the industry, you came in as a Web Designer‚Äîsomeone who not only designed but also built their designs using code. Back then, we had much more creative control because the value of our work was harder to quantify. Mainstream services hadn‚Äôt yet made it easy for non-coders to build their own websites.

After my time at the small agency, I moved to a corporate media company, where my role was now called an interactive producer‚Äîa glorified webmaster, in short. I really enjoyed this role, especially as responsive design was beginning to take off, with tools like Bootstrap leading the way. I had the opportunity to take full ownership of the product/service I was managing and drive its evolution moving forward. After a while, as this role wasn‚Äôt as hands-on with the tools, I decided to return to agency work. That's when I landed a position at a WordPress agency, and it was here that the term ""UI/UX Designer"" really began to take shape. We quickly witnessed the rise and fall of tools like Sketch, UX Pin, and InVision, while Figma emerged as the leading UX tool. For those who remember the old-school days, you'll know the struggle of working with a massive PSD file filled with multiple artboards and layers for each page of a website. It was exciting to learn new tools, but it also made things more complex with each job, as every business had its way of working and often didn‚Äôt use the same tech.

As UX expanded, the role started to become more ambiguous, with businesses having different expectations. Did they want someone focused purely on research? A web designer who could code? Someone to design sleek UI elements? Or did they expect a ""unicorn"" who could do it all?In my experience, it's challenging to be an expert in every aspect, which is why the role really needs to be split. However, it remained tricky because ""UX"" often felt like an umbrella term businesses used to pull designers into various roles that didn‚Äôt always align with their expertise.

For me, I got into design because I wanted to be creative and make an impact on the projects I worked on. As the field matured and tools improved for the lower end of the market, it meant even small businesses, like a local coffee shop, could design their own websites without needing to hire a designer. This shift led to larger businesses requiring specialists‚Äîpeople who could work with an already-defined design system or tackle specific issues within a user flow.These larger businesses were often in the financial sector, which, as a designer, didn‚Äôt feel very creative. It was more about solving complex design systems to display financial data on a page‚Äîdefinitely not what I wanted to do or the reason I entered the field in the first place. With smaller businesses, it also felt like clients no longer valued our work at the price point, or at least the perceived value. It became reduced to ""just dragging and dropping stuff around on a page""‚Äîin other words, pixel pushing.   
  
Of course, some people truly love this industry and can't imagine doing anything else, so credit to you. My next few thoughts aren't meant to discourage anyone from the field; they‚Äôre just how I genuinely feel about the direction we're heading. Personally, I find it hard to see how this role evolves positively, especially with the rise of AI and the increasing predictability of design systems‚Äîlike where a hamburger menu is placed on a website. A job that once might have required four UX designers could now potentially be handled by just one. There are systems today that can generate a site map from a detailed brief, provide modules with sample content, and allow you to import them directly into Figma‚Äîor even move them straight from Figma into platforms like Webflow. This only adds to the devaluation I mentioned earlier, where our work is seen as less valuable from a budget, time, and client expectation perspective.  
  
Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚Äîthere will always be a human element to this, where the UX designer can empathise with users and understand the pain points they experience with a product or service. But much like front-end or back-end developers, AI works in their language and can code and debug faster than humans. Is it always right? Not necessarily. But just think about how this could evolve in the next five years‚Äîor even sooner. Will we become just prompters, using our understanding of design or code to evaluate? In a world where business, product managers, marketing managers, and CEOs prioritise efficiency over everything else.  
  
Given what I know now and my experience, I struggle to recommend UX as a career option. Again, this is just how I feel. However, I‚Äôm concerned and have encountered the same issues across multiple businesses and projects, which has led me to believe it might be time to leave the industry for good.   
  
I'll be honest, sometimes I daydream about becoming a firefighter‚Äîputting out real fires and having a genuine sense of purpose. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I know every career has its ups and downs. But I just don‚Äôt feel the same job satisfaction in UX that I once did, and I‚Äôm struggling to see how it improves. I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on how others feel in the industry and if anyone shares the same sentiment.",2,1739061093.0,UXDesign,1,0.75,False

He sat at the dinner table, alone. He was working on finding a partner but he didnt really have much luck. Never did. He had finished his microwave mac 'n' cheese and stood up, he took the plate he used and walked to the sink. He rinsed it and then placed it in the dishwasher, it was filled with knives and forks and spoons and over a dozen coffee mugs. 'I should cut back on the coffee' he thought briefly before placing the plate neatly in between two others. He looked at the trash bag that was slouching against the back door. Like the drunken step father he had ran away from back in his early 20s. He was in his late twenties now, not that long ago if you really think about it. He wasn't going to take it out yet. he was going to rest on the old couch in his living room and watch the most mindless TV show he could find channel surfing. The American dream, oh how great you are, he chuckled to himself thinking about it and then he closed the dishwasher. 
About an hour later, at 6:23 to be exact, he had thought about sleeping for a while, he knew he couldn't be judged about being lazy or stubborn, he was alone in his 2 story fort of solitude. His neighbors didnt care they couldn't see him, no one could. Then he felt sad. Ever so sad. He felt lonely, he hadn't spoken much to people or left his home ever since he had a mental breakdown about a week ago. He had always kept a watchful eye on his mental health ever since high school but he never thought to ask it if it was okay. So he suffered the consequences. 
He had spent a few days in the hospital after that fateful afternoon just to recover, which he did surprisingly quickly. Out after two days, what a record. He sat cross legged on the soft cushions just to ponder if he really was okay. It scared him, just the thought of it, of being borderline insane over simple,mindless paranoia, and then being locked away in that white box with the doctors coming in ever so often to check if he was ok. Although he had nothing to fear, the doctors had told him that he was okay. He was glad and so was mother. He wouldn't have to go back there ever again. 
He thought...

2: Night
He had slept longer than he would've hoped for. About 2 hours. He got up to go get a glass of water from the kitchen. He stared into the black hole that led to his kitchen. The darkness engulfed the familiar environment before him. It morphed into a deep, unfathomable area of complete darkness. However, a savior came to him. The eppeteme of help in a dark home. The light switch.
The brightness stung his tired eyes, making him shield them as they adjusted to the miniature sun that was glued to ceiling of the kitchen. He stumbled to the sink and twisted the dial that encouraged the faucet to release a gush of that ever so satisfying liquid that every human relies on to survive. As he got a glass he looked toward the sink but was distracted by the windows. Outside was completely surrounded by the unending darkness. This time he couldn't simply flick a switch and be done with the blackness. It was an impossibly dark night too which made it much worse. He grabbed a glass and returned to the sink, trying to ignore the outside. He wasn't particularly scared of the dark. Never was. But this was different somehow. Much different.
He got his water and began to take a sip and walk back to the living room until he spotted something in the corner of his eye. Just outside, a shape was barely visible. It looked like a sort of worm or tendril. It had fur on the end. Weird. 
He looked at the window but the shape was gone.
Even weirder.
Then he saw the trash bag, still slouched against the back door. 
It was mocking him, daring him to go outside
It was mocking him and fears. That bastard.
""I'll take it out later"" he said, almost like a comeback. He returned to the living room.

3: man in the dark.
10:41, He had sat on the couch giggling and laughing at the show he was watching. He would forget it soon enough
He remembered the trash bag that had been leaning against the back door for nearly 4 hours now. He had to take it out, no matter what was out there. He had to chance it. He rose from the couch and waltzed toward the kitchen he felt determined for such a mundane task.
But this was different. Much different. Because someone, or something, was waiting for him and he knew it.
He picked up the trash bag and twisted the key on the back door and felt a rush of cold winter air,
And fear.
He took a deep breath and took his first steps outside.
'One big step for man' he thought and then grinned, giving him some much needed confidence.
Despite the fear, he was enjoyed the cool air that grazed his skin.He felt calm in a way.
However this didnt last long, as he heard a sound from the other side of his backyard. Crunching of the grass.he paused his journey and listened. 
Nothing, no sound. No sound but the whistling of the wind. 
He continued. Then he heard it again. That distinctive crunch that frosted grass had.
He stopped again. 
Nothing.
Was he imagining it? But he couldn't be, he's no where near the grass. Not at all.
The trash can was close now. He could see the moonlight reflecting off of it. He felt another rush of confidence and he kept walking.
Crunching, closer this time. He moved faster this time. Fear put it's cold,dead hand on his shoulder once again.
The crunching got faster too.
Then he was speed walking, it was too,
Then he wax jogging,and it was too,
Then he wax running, and by God, 
It was too.
He ripped the lid off the trash can and slammed the bag in. 
It kept running.
He twisted around and began to dart back toward the back door. He slipped slightly and gasped.
The thing kept the same pace it had before.
His feet touched the linoleum floor of the kitchen and he slammed the door shut and began to lock it before he stopped.
He hadn't seen it yet. What did it look like? Why was it here? But what was most important was the question, What exactly is it any way?
He opened the a draw and fiddled with its contents. Then he saw it, a flashlight.
Outdoor's light switch.
He opened the door again, a new sense of determination crept up his spine. 
'One giant leap for mankind' he thought.
He turned on the flashlight and began to search for the entity in the backyard.
Then he felt the determination slip away.
It was replaced with doubt.
He thought about his breakdown and then had a realisation.
WHAT IF IT WASNT REAL THE WHOLE TIME?
It sent a shock down his spine.
Was it all anxiety? 
No. No. No. No. No.
He darted the flashlight around as he swore he spotted something. Lurking...
It was a spot of fur and pale,white flesh.
Its skin wrapped around the thin build it had.
Its eyes appeared a brilliant orange in the light.
Its mouth was wide open ( or at least he thought it was, he could never make out a bottom jaw, just a red tongue ).
Its tail curled around its mass in a defensive manner.
Its hands were also up in a defensive manner, as if it was attempting to shield its face
Speaking of, it had a skull making up its head ( a deer's to be specific ).
And two antlers stuck upright.
He turned the flashlight back in its direction.
It wad gone.
""SHIT!"" He cried in a frightful manner as he dropped the flashlight and began to run once more. 
He could hear it behind him. Sprinting.
He threw himself through the back door and slammed it shut. He locked it and took deep breaths. Then he slumped against the back door. As the trash bag had once done. He cried.

Did you add any supporting documents?  
  
Hi there,

I was hoping to hear from some people who have done this in the past, and get some advice.

The realization has sort of hit even deeper recently that, if I don't get into med school, then the most likely thing I'd be doing is selling my soul to some company and doing the same, non dynamic, repetitive tasks everyday. Wake up, drink coffee, go to work, pipette some shit, then go back home. And repeat. Furthermore, the idea of ""research"" doesn't really interest me. All the chem labs we've done so far, and all the bio labs have been like, ok cool. I always feel that the idea behind them is we're building these skills, to literally prepare us for industry. And I don't want to be a slave to industry.

Literally the other day, I was sitting in chem lecture, and the word ""industry"" kept coming up. In industry this, in industry that. I don't give a shit for industry, and I surely do not want a life where I'm working a 9-5, in industry.

It's always been a dream of mine to start my own company, and launch my own product, especially in health care (hence why I'm really interested in iBiomed). I don't have the training, but I have the grit and the dedication. I know if I start learning things in Eng, I can start doing things with what I learn as well.

So far I've been doing pretty well for myself in 1st year.

Fall term ended with an 11 average. Second term so far so good. Chem 1AA3 midterm was 23/25 (92%), and all my other assessments have been okay as well. I hear that the workload in engineering is no different, by a lot, than in life sciences, so I know I can handle it. Furthermore, I've been able to handle all of this much better than a lot of other students while also working 16 hours part-time.

If there is anyone here who in the past has transferred, what was your cGPA like, and what did you talk about in the application? Did you add any supporting documents?

Thank you for all your help.",3,1739060799.0,McMaster,2,0.8,False
1il21vt,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1il21vt/motherson_enmeshment/,Mother/Son Enmeshment?,"My boyfriend (M21) and I (F21) have been together for six years as of the 6th of this month. We successfully purchased our first home together in June of last year at the ages of 20 and 21. We decided to keep this significant milestone private until we felt the timing was right, as it was a major investment using our hard-earned money. We wanted to avoid any feelings of obligation from friends and family regarding gifts, so we opted not to host a housewarming party. Instead, I prepared dinner for both of our families on separate occasions, as that felt more meaningful to us!

I‚Äôve heard discussions about ‚Äúmother/son enmeshment,‚Äù and I wonder if that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm experiencing. Perhaps she resents my support for him, my affection, or the fact that I don‚Äôt try to control him? However, I cannot help but wonder if her feelings towards me stem from a sense of competition or insecurity. After six years of trying to foster a positive relationship, I‚Äôve come to realize that it‚Äôs not my responsibility to change her perspective. Her interactions with me have often been marked by passive-aggressive comments and inappropriate behavior, which my boyfriend has noticed but has difficulty addressing. 

My boyfriend's family tends to be quite judgmental, and we were concerned that their opinions might influence our decisions. When we finally shared the news, his mother initially appeared happy, but her expression quickly changed. I had anticipated she might be upset about us keeping the news from her (as normal), but she proceeded to ask personal questions about my finances‚Äîtopics we had never discussed before. While I felt obligated to answer her questions nicely, I was taken aback by her regarding whether my name was on the house. When we confirmed that it was, her demeanor shifted, and she expressed displeasure. As the evening progressed, she sent my boyfriend a text saying, ‚ÄúIf YOU need anything, always come home.‚Äù 

For context, my boyfriend‚Äôs mother is a nurse who lives with her husband two children, (15 and 16), 2 cats and 1 dog. She has been divorced three times and has been in a tumultuous relationship with her current partner for seven years. Two years ago, she moved into a duplex apartment due to ‚Äòpersonal issues‚Äô but 3 days later returned to her husband house. During that time, she frequently made disgusting jokes about how her apartment home was just a ‚Äúvacation house‚Äù for her because she was alone. My boyfriend and I had previously bought a storage unit together, she generously had given us the household items and furniture from when she moved. Now, we finally have our own home together. 

However, I have noticed that she often makes disparaging comments about me, which my boyfriend has observed as well. One particularly incident happened when I prepared dinner for her daughters after school. She was arriving home from work early, came in coughing and while I politely moved over, she grabbed his face and pretended to put her tongue in his mouth. Which led to all of us contracting COVID-19 from her, including my family. 

Additionally, last year she made a birthday post for my boyfriend, referring to him as her ""soulmate"" and mentioning that she had breastfed him until he was three years old. Since then, it‚Äôs been changed to ‚Äúbaby boy‚Äù. But, this behavior has also affected his social relationships, as his mother's actions on social media have made it difficult for him to maintain friendships. Especially in high-school. She frequently deactivates her Facebook account and has blocked my entire family, whom she has met only twice. During one of those meetings, she made an inappropriate comment to my father, who is a recovering addict, suggesting he should take Xanax for his daily struggles.

Since we moved into our new home, she has sent my boyfriend texts suggesting that he needs more appreciation in his life, and she has even offered to ‚Äúshare his phone number with younger nurses at her workplace.‚Äù Alongside negative comments trying to get her son to leave me, ‚ÄúOpen eyes. Use your gut, not your heart. It‚Äôs going to hurt, but we can survive the most unbearable decisions together. I promise I will never let you down.‚Äù She then sent him a rather personal photograph of herself outside in a chair, holding a coffee mug, with her camel-toe front and center. Her behavior has felt competitive and immature, as she seems to be vying for his attention.

More recently, she has been persistently texting my boyfriend about wanting to adopt a dog together, despite his very clear refusals. ‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt ready yet‚Äù, ‚ÄúNo‚Äù, ‚ÄúThat isn‚Äôt the dog we want‚Äù, or ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want a dog‚Äù just isn‚Äôt enough for her. Her urgency seems to stem from the recent loss of her older dog just as of 2 weeks ago. But it is concerning that she is not consulting us about the decision, and is instead focusing on her desires. It is obvious that her husband does not support the idea of bringing a new dog into their home either. 

Now, last night, while my boyfriend was at work, he called me in a panic because his mom unexpectedly bought him 8 CHICKENS. I was taken aback, but suggested he ask her if she could cancel the purchase instead. She responded by saying, ‚ÄúOh no, you can have them in April when you‚Äôre ready. Just make sure the coop is finished by then.‚Äù Then, she started over reacting, claiming, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just give them to someone else.‚Äù My boyfriend and I have discussed getting chickens this spring for our property, and he has already completed the base of the coop. However, for her to make such a significant decision without consulting either of us feels disrespectful.

Now that we finally have our own space, I‚Äôve reflected on our relationship over the last six years. It seems that she often bypasses her husband for decisions, seeks emotional validation from her son, and looks for his approval in everything she does. Additionally, she has sent him inappropriate pictures and has been quite bullying towards me. It feels as though she doesn‚Äôt recognize that he is capable of making his own choices. I have never tried to keep him from his family, hobbies, or career; instead, I‚Äôve always encouraged him to be the best version of himself, and I‚Äôve always been proud of our relationship. 

I‚Äôm unsure how to navigate this situation moving forward as I want to maintain a respectful relationship with her while also protecting my relationship with my boyfriend. Any advice or insights you could provide would be greatly appreciated.",1,1739060774.0,motherinlawsfromhell,1,1.0,False

‚ÄúOur family has a book that's been passed down many generations,‚Äù he began.

‚ÄúThe first entry was written by your twelfth great-grandfather Edward in 1655. When Edward was thirty years old, he hand-wrote a long, detailed book of wisdom and life learnings for his eldest son, your eleventh great-grandfather William, and gave it to him to read at the age of twenty-five. After William finished reading, Edward then instructed William to write his own life learnings in the next pages before he turned thirty, then hand it down to his oldest son when he turned twenty-five with the same instructions. William‚Äôs oldest son Harold, your tenth great grandfather, did the same.‚Äù

I listened in awe.

‚ÄúOver time the collective wisdom of the books from each first-born sons of our ancestors were passed down through the generations,‚Äù He continued. ‚ÄúWhen the book was damaged during the Napoleonic war, your sixth great grandfather diligently restored the book to the best of his ability. By the time of the first world war, the pages were so worn that your great-great grandfather recreated it with a typewriter before passing the new copy down. When your grandfather passed it to me, that copy was falling apart, so I copied it into a Google Doc.‚Äù

He paused.¬†*Comically tech savvy, but efficient*, I thought.

‚ÄúNow that you‚Äôve turned twenty-five, I‚Äôll be sending it to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWow, that‚Äôs mind blowing!‚Äù I exclaimed, ‚ÄúWhat other family has something like that?‚Äù

‚ÄúRight? No family like us.‚Äù He smiled and patted me on the back, as he sent me an email from his laptop. ‚ÄúRead it carefully. It contains the wonderful experiences and wisdom from the youths of our past grandfathers. To carry on the tradition, you‚Äôve got five years to write your own message to pass onto your oldest son, along with the rest of them. Might as well start thinking about it early.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, I can‚Äôt write stuff in it after I turn thirty?‚Äù

‚ÄúAfraid not,‚Äù dad shook his head, ‚ÄúNot sure why, that‚Äôs how the tradition goes. Each entry is an account of youth, written between the ages of twenty-five to thirty. We must respect it.‚Äù

‚ÄúFair enough.‚Äù

I opened the email with the link to the Google doc that dad had transcribed, containing thirteen generations of wisdom. The entries were fascinating and emotional. That night, I stayed up until dawn reading.

Edward, my twelfth great-grandfather who started our book, was a wealthy estate owner who lived through the English Civil War. I was impressed by his writing, even though I had to try and decipher some of the old English.

To quote, ‚Äú*I commence this tome to chronicle the youths of mine sons. As long as they draw breath, I shall not meet my end.*‚Äù

I was sure my future grandsons would be disappointed at my entry after reading a banger like that.

His eldest son William, my eleventh great-grandfather, was similarly a hard-working tradesman. One of his gems of wisdom: ""*A man‚Äôs worth is not measured by his fortune, but by his steadfastness when the world shifts beneath his feet.*""

His son Harold, a soldier who fought during the War of Spanish Succession, seemed like the total opposite type to his dad and grandad. ‚Äú*My dear son and grandsons, to charm a lady and shoot a pistol are but two arts of precision; both require a steady hand and a heart unflinching. For while bullets may fly true, it is the spark in her eye that captures a man's soul.*‚Äù

*He must‚Äôve gotten all the ladies,*¬†I thought. Unfortunately, it seems like I never inherited any of those pickup genes.

Each entry was as captivating as the last. It was as if I could envision the spirited youths of my grandfathers standing in front of me, speaking to me directly. In their stories, I discerned reflections of my own character and glimpses of their shared essence within one another. It was an emotional experience ‚Äì they were all well written and captured the highest highs and lowest lows of their lives.

Well, all except for¬†*one*. I was left confused by my fourth great-grandfather‚Äôs entry.

All my other grandfathers, my dad included, had written dozens of pages, full of stories, teachings and advice. But my fourth great-grandfather had only written one page. I couldn‚Äôt even understand the meaning of his entry.

‚Äú*He is the whisper that directs you to verity. Is it sagacity or artifice that you discern in his utterances? Not all connections possess the strength they purport, nor the sincerity. Your heart perceives more than your eyes are willing to acknowledge. Father-hood is a role most sacred. When the stars align, fate weaves its intricate design. You are the author of your own unfolding tale, brave and unyielding. Turn your gaze to the horizon, where dreams dance on the edge of dawn. Thirty echoes with the laughter of youth, yet whispers of wisdom draw near. You must delve deeper, beyond the well-known fa√ßade. Are you prepared for what lies hidden beneath? Next arrives the instant when your destiny shall reveal.*‚Äù

Perhaps he was trying to write a poem, I thought. I asked dad, but he had no idea what it meant either. He suggested the war made my fourth grandfather go mad, and perhaps those were his ramblings.

For the next two years, I periodically opened up the Google Doc and read through the entries, while thinking of what I would write in my own. I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about my fourth great-grandfather‚Äôs entry. Like my dad, I concluded that it was most likely gibberish. Either he was trying to sound overly artistic, or he had really gone mad during the war. PTSD was no joke. However, my fifth great-grandad‚Äôs entry about his son, and my third great-grandfather‚Äôs entry about his father, my fourth great-grandfather, were both bothersome to me.

According to the context, my fifth great-grandfather finished his entry at the age of twenty nine, and had my fourth great-grandfather, his first son at the age of nineteen. He describes his oldest son:

‚Äú*As I observe my ten-year-old son, a quiet lad with a contemplative brow, I am continually astounded by the brilliance that resides within him. Though he speaks little, his mind dances with the complexities of numbers, effortlessly unraveling the most intricate mathematical conundrums that baffle even seasoned minds. His remarkable ability to discern subtleties in behavior and read the hearts of those around him fills me with confidence that he shall one day be a genius of great renown. I cannot help but envision a future where he is celebrated not merely for his intellect, but for the profound understanding he brings to the world‚Äîa light among many, illuminating paths previously obscured*.‚Äù

Basically, he clearly thought his son was exceptionally intelligent as a boy. Having read that description, I couldn‚Äôt help but think there was a deeper meaning to my fourth great-grandfather‚Äôs book entry, which seemed nonsensical at first glance.

My third great-grandfather describes how as a child, he witnessed his father, my fourth great-grandfather, trying to take his own life several times. A notable quote reads:

‚Äú*As an eight-year-old, the memory is etched into my mind like a scar that time cannot heal. I recall the day vividly, the sombre atmosphere hanging heavy in the air, as I witnessed my father, a man of strength and resolve, grappling with a darkness I could not comprehend. His actions, born of despair, unfurled before my young eyes like a cruel nightmare, shattering the innocence of my childhood in an instant. In that moment, I felt a chilling blend of fear and confusion, a child's heart struggling to understand how the very anchor of our family could be so lost, leaving an indelible mark on my soul that would forever shape my understanding of sorrow.*‚Äù

I deciphered from the rest of his entry that my fourth great-grandfather would have been about twenty-six at the time this happened.

After much consideration, I eventually came to the conclusion that the PTSD theory seemed to fit ‚Äì perhaps he was a highly intelligent man struggling mentally around the time he wrote his entry, so it made little sense. But I could never shake the feeling that my fourth great-grandfather was trying to convey something deeper.

For the past five years, I had taken extensive notes about my most important life experiences and was finally ready to gather them into prose to complete my chapter of the family book. I took a vacation from work to visit my parents at their house, and to complete my entry, something I had now considered was to be one of the most important events of my life.

Dad came downstairs to find me typing away on my MacBook in the morning.

‚ÄúHard at work leaving your legacy,‚Äù he beamed, as he sat on the couch with his morning coffee.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre gonna love this,‚Äù I smiled, eyes fixed on the screen. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gotta be my oldest son I give this to, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs correct.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, what if I never have a son?‚Äù I asked nonchalantly. I wasn‚Äôt even married.

‚ÄúOh, you will.‚Äù He smiled.

I raised an eyebrow.

‚ÄúOkay... lot of confidence you‚Äôve got in me there.‚Äù

I took a break from typing to flick back up through the Google Doc for inspiration and found myself staring at my fourth great-grandfather‚Äôs entry again. I stared for a couple of minutes in deep thought, until the words were floating into each other across the screen.

My eyes started scanning the first word of each sentence.

‚ÄúHe Is Not Your Father When You Turn Thirty You Are Next‚Äù

I blinked.

I read the first word of each sentence again. Was that... a message?

After a minute, I realized it made some sort of sense as a message. I began to think about it. Was my fourth grandfather trying to convey the message to someone else who would receive the book after him? If he was, what was that message even getting at? Then it started to click.

My heart began to race as I looked at my dad, without turning my head. He sat still on the couch, watching the morning news. I looked back at the screen.

‚ÄúDad,‚Äù I said, my voice shaking slightly. He looked up at me.

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you remember when I was about six or seven, you and mom would read me a story in my room every night?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù he said, after a pause.

‚ÄúDo you remember¬†*which*¬†stories?‚Äù

He scratched his head.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt remember all those stories, that was a long time ago,‚Äù he said.

It was¬†*Goodnight Moon*. I had asked them to read the same story to me every night for three years. There was no way he would forget that. I started shaking as the background noise of the television faded, replaced by the sound of my racing pulse filling my ears.

An unfathomable thought popped into my head. My mind pieced the jigsaw together into an unbelievable but logical conclusion.

‚ÄúEdward?‚Äù I said quietly, without hesitation. My mouth moved on its own.

Dad stared at me, a surprised look on his face. Our eyes met.

His surprise slowly faded, and was replaced by a wide grin. He stood up and suddenly moved in my direction, then crouched down beside me, staring up maniacally into my eyes as he smiled. I was terrified ‚Äì all I wanted to do was scream and run from this thing that was not my dad, but I was paralyzed.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt heard that name in four and a half centuries,‚Äù he whispered.

All I could do was stare, sweat dripping down my forehead.

‚ÄúYou see, I like to know a bit about my sons before I inhabit them,‚Äù he continued, in a hushed voice, ‚ÄúI look back at my book of the last words of my sons, and sometimes I feel sorry for them. How oblivious they were.‚Äù

‚ÄúW-what did you do to dad?‚Äù I cried.

‚ÄúWhen he turned thirty, I unlocked his body. Then I simply entered.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe fuck you mean you ‚Äòunlocked‚Äô‚Ä¶ what the actual fuck is going on?‚Äù My voice trembled.

‚ÄúI lived on through him, and I‚Äôll live on through you, too. When you turn thirty, I‚Äôll leave this body and inhabit yours. Don‚Äôt worry, it doesn‚Äôt hurt. You won‚Äôt even feel it. But you‚Äôll no longer be here, which is a shame, so I‚Äôd like to keep a little memoir of your existence. You‚Äôd better hurry ‚Äì wouldn‚Äôt want the rest of my sons reading an unfinished entry.‚Äù

My mind flashed back to a doctors‚Äô appointment I had as a child, which I attended with my mom. When the doctor asked if I had any family history of medical conditions, my mom mentioned that my grandad, my dad‚Äôs father, had died young at fifty-two, having collapsed from an unknown cause. The doctor advised my mom that I should get tested for a condition called hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, or HOCM, a condition that can cause sudden unexplained deaths in fit people. The test came out negative, which I was glad about at the time, now not so much.

Dad stood up, placed his empty coffee mug on the kitchen counter, and made his way upstairs. I turned to look at him, his mouth still stretched into a wide, toothy, demonic grin as he walked up the staircase.

I snapped out of my shellshocked paralysis and promptly left my parents‚Äô house, packing up as soon as dad was out of sight. My heart was in my mouth, and I couldn't catch my breath. Panic had taken over my entire body.

It‚Äôs been two weeks since the incident, and I‚Äôve been awake almost every night. While the terror hasn't subsided, I‚Äôve accepted my likely fate ‚Äì that my body will soon be possessed, and I know there isn‚Äôt much I can do about it.

Mom will be alone soon, so I‚Äôve spent some time making sure all my assets are assigned to her name. If my shrewd fourth grandfather wasn‚Äôt able to find a way out, I doubt I‚Äôll be able to in the two weeks I have before my thirtieth birthday.

But I‚Äôm hoping someone will.

It seems like he didn‚Äôt catch onto my fourth grandfather realizing his scheme. I‚Äôll write something generic for my entry, but I‚Äôll edit my third grandfather‚Äôs entry and hope he doesn‚Äôt notice.

‚Äú*I have perused the prior entries in this book, and while each brims with remarkable wisdom, none resonate with me quite like my father's. A man of exceptional intellect, as my grandfather noted, his powers of perception are unparalleled. At first glance, his entry may appear muddled or the ramblings of a troubled mind, but I implore you to read it with care; the truth lies hidden within. It is imperative that you grasp its meaning, for your very life may hinge upon it.

First question is whether I'm overthinking this? Does my brain already has a rate limiting mechanism for acetylcholine that makes this unlikely? Second question is what else I could add or subtract from these rotating stacks?

1il1ofc,https://www.reddit.com/r/paypigsupportgroup/comments/1il1ofc/the_fundamental_attribution_error_and_the_variety/,The Fundamental Attribution Error and the Variety of Submissive Experience,"I know I've written about this before, but I'll revisit it. I often see comments online such as:

""He's not a true submissive.""

""He's not really submissive.""

""He's just a horny kinkster.""

""He's just a sub, he's not a finsub""

""He's a bad sub.""

""You're obviously lost."" (Yes. I shoulda turned left at Albuquerque.)

And yet this is often said about someone who is identifying as submissive. Some of them have been said about me. They have caused me to question whether I am submissive. Am I submissive? I think I am, but though I will use myself as an example, ultimately this is not about me. It is about understanding why someone might end up misunderstanding and mislabelling themselves and creating irritation for all concerned. This is written from a sub perspective in an attempt to help Dommes understand subs and help subs understand themselves. I'm sure a Domme could write a perspective from the other side of the /

**The Fundamental Attribution Error**

The first reason may simply be the Fundamental Attribution Error. This is the tendency, discovered by psychologists, of people to explain the behaviour of others by attributing it to personality traits without realising that the situation someone is in can affect their behaviour. Someone may only be submissive in some situations, but not in others.

Dominance and submission are relational terms, similar to above and below. Most things aren't inherently above or below but may be one or the other or sometimes both. The same goes for dominant and submissive. Someone may be mostly submissive, or mostly dominant. They may switch between the two (Switches), or they may submit to only one person and be dominant in every other situation.

My submission is very situational, as I suspect is the case for more than a few other subs, and there are a number of reasons for that.

**Top/bottom vs Dominant/submissive**

The 'sub' may be more of a bottom.

In case there are people reading this who aren't sure about the distinction, here's a quick (and self-plagiarising) explanation:

Top and bottom dynamics are primarily physical. Tops do things and bottoms have things done to them. Dominant and submissive dynamics are primarily psychological. Dominants control and submissive are controlled. While tops are often dominant and bottoms are often submissive, it is possible for someone to be a dominant bottom (aka a power bottom) or a submissive top (aka a service top).

One reason I might be labelled a bad sub or a non-sub is that I'm more of a bottom than a submissive. It's not that I'm not submissive, I am. I'm definitely not a power bottom. It's just that submission is secondary to bottoming for me.

Bottoms (and tops) are in a tough spot in the BDSM world, even more so in the online BDSM world, and especially so in online Findom. The distinction between Dominant and Top, and bottom and submissive, is absent in much of online BDSM. A lot of people don't even realise there is a distinction, and some who do seem to have forgotten about it.

Take the BDSM Test, for example. Put your hand up if you've taken this test and received a result for ""Top"" or ""bottom."" You haven't, because the labels don't exist. ""Rope bunny"" and ""Rigger"" are the closest thing, but what about the guy who would rather be pegged than tied up?

And how many profiles do you see on here or other social media where a woman labels herself a Top rather than a Domme? I haven't seen any myself. So, is it any wonder that people might call themselves submissive when they might actually be bottoms?

I also wonder how many women labelling themselves Dommes might actually be Service Tops.

**Finsub vs Sugar Daddy**

A recent post in PPSG stated that a Domme had told the post's author that they were a sugar daddy rather than a finsub, making the distinction on the basis that although they liked to give they also liked to be in control.

I can be financially submissive if someone gets me into deep subspace through other means, but it's rare, As an example there is a Domme who, after I had sent initial tribute, told me to buy the quite expensive bikini on their Throne. Then started adding new gifts to their Throne aimed directly at me during the session. That became a $1000 drain.

Most of the time that's not me though. I'm probably more of a sugar daddy. Alternatively I might be a coffee daddy, because silent coffee sends are my favourite. Or perhaps a stevia daddy because I often use stevia instead of sugar.

**Finsub vs Sub**

There are many subs who are submissive, but not financially submissive. It's very common for a sub who wants Femdom rather than Findom to interact with Findommmes. And with regard to bottoms, there are no finbottoms as findomme is inherently psychological (and of course inherently financial).

Aside: I know what many of you are thinking: ""Findom is part of Femdom."" It is my considered belief that it is not but, to quote the Neverending Story, ""That is another story and shall be told another time. Whether it is or isn't is less important than understanding how and why such subs wind up in Findom. So I think we can bracket this particular point and it can be discussed in another post if people are interested.

I'm going to refer out for this explanation, because I cannot improve upon what a very insightful Domme wrote in some comments a little while ago:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/findomsupportgroup/comments/1hp762u/comment/m4gaepu/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/findomsupportgroup/comments/1hp762u/comment/m4gaepu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

**Total vs Limited Power Exchange**

The other reason I may sometimes be labelled a bad or non sub is that I'm not interested in Total Power Exchange (TPE), or even anything close to it. My submission is largely limited to sessions, and maybe across sessions if the Domme wants to actively participate. When a Domme isn't actively dominating me, I just go off and do my own thing. That doesn't make me not submissive.

**Some Suggestions and a Plea for Understanding, Not Judgement**

I have arrived at the position of identifying as a bottom sugar daddy and part time, situational submissive through a lengthy process of action, observation, reading, and reflection. I was always sincere and genuine, but I made many mistakes along the way. I wonder whether I could have taken a shorter route to this self-understanding if a Domme had realised what they were dealing with and held up a mirror for me rather than trying to mould me into something I was not.

Dommes: I know it might be annoying when someone interacts with you when they're looking for something different to you, but I appeal to you to try to understand their situation and help them gain a better understanding of themselves. If a dynamic isn't working, try to refer them to someone who might be a better fit. I know that it is difficult when you're losing a source of money, but I feel that it will be better for the overall findom and femdom ecosystem if this was more common.

Subs: just be aware that you don't have to fit into a particular box with a particular label. And if a Domme is trying to fit your square peg into a round hole then try to find another Domme.

In general, please realise that there is no hierarchy. None of the options I listed above are better or worse than the others. A lot of posts by Dommes, and quite a few subs too, seem to imply that submissives are at the top of the hierarchy of kinksters who might engage with them. While it's perfectly okay to state that you're looking for a submissive rather than a bottom, I would appeal to you to express that as a personal preference rather than in absolute terms. For example, you could say ""He's not a submissive, he's a kinkster and I'm only looking for submissives"" instead of ""He's *just* a kinkster, not a *true* submissive.""

n Findom, don't use 'sub' as a shorthand for 'finsub.' Say ""a finsub would have sent"" rather than ""a sub would have sent""

Third, remember that we're all in this together and that someone's behaviour isn't necessarily disrespectful. They simply may not yet fully understand what they're looking for.

**Points for Discussion**

Share your experiences of misunderstanding in kink, either of yourself or others. How did you deal with it? What could you have done differently?

What other suggestions do you have for ameliorating possible misunderstandings in findom and femdom?

Note: Personally, I'm going to ignore unconstructive criticism or nit picking that generates more heat than light. In particular, I've expressed distinctions as dichotomies in order to lay them bare, but they are probably more continuous that binary.",2,1739059672.0,paypigsupportgroup,0,1.0,False

**Star Wars: The Saga of the Glowing Moon Waffle**  

A long time ago, in a galaxy somehow closer than expected...  

**Chapter 1: The Wobble of Destiny**  

Luke Skywalker stood heroically on the edge of a cliff on Tatooine, though it wasn‚Äôt clear why because there weren‚Äôt any cliffs nearby. His lightsaber hummed softly, glowing with the power of... something important. Probably friendship. Or lasers.  

""I must find the Force,"" Luke declared boldly to no one in particular because he was alone.  

Suddenly, Obi-Wan Kenobi‚Äôs ghost appeared, shimmering like a holographic jellyfish at a disco party.  

""Luke,"" Obi-Wan said wisely, ""the Force is strong with you. Strong like a Wookiee who‚Äôs had too much space coffee.""  

Luke nodded, pretending he understood. ""Where is the Force?""  

Obi-Wan squinted, as if trying to remember if he left the stove on in the afterlife. ""It‚Äôs inside you, Luke. Also possibly in that toaster over there.""  

Luke turned dramatically to see an ancient Sith toaster sitting ominously on a rock. It beeped menacingly.  

**Chapter 2: Darth Vader‚Äôs Slightly Inconvenient Plan**  

Meanwhile, aboard the Death Star II: The Deathening, Darth Vader paced back and forth. His heavy breathing filled the room like an asthmatic accordion.  

""Prepare the ultimate weapon,"" Vader commanded. ""The Galactic Moon Waffle.""  

A stormtrooper saluted, his helmet slightly crooked because it was, in fact, a bucket. ""Sir, the waffle is almost operational, but we‚Äôre out of syrup.""  

Vader clenched his fists. ""Then get more syrup. *Or else.*""  

The stormtrooper ran away, tripping over absolutely nothing because that‚Äôs what stormtroopers do.  

**Chapter 3: The Unnecessarily Long Space Battle**  

Luke, now aboard the Millennium Falcon with Han Solo, Princess Leia, and Chewbacca (who was wearing sunglasses for no reason), stared out into space dramatically.  

""We have to stop Vader‚Äôs waffle,"" Luke said with deep conviction.  

Han shrugged. ""I‚Äôve done worse things before breakfast.""  

Chewbacca roared in agreement, which translated roughly to, ""But have you ever fought a waffle that controls gravity?""  

No one questioned this.  

They flew towards the Death Star II: The Deathening 2: Electric Boogaloo, dodging lasers, meteors, and an oddly aggressive space goose. The battle was intense. Pew-pews echoed through the void, which scientifically doesn‚Äôt make sense because space is silent, but let‚Äôs ignore that.  

**Chapter 4: The Final Confrontation**  

Luke faced Vader in the waffle chamber, standing atop the control panel shaped suspiciously like a breakfast buffet.  

""Father,"" Luke said dramatically, ""let go of your hate.""  

Vader hesitated. ""But... the syrup...""  

""You don‚Äôt need syrup to be complete!"" Luke shouted, his lightsaber clashing with Vader‚Äôs in a flurry of glowing nonsense.  

In the end, Vader looked at his reflection in the shiny waffle iron and saw something unexpected: a man who just needed a hug.  

He turned to the Emperor. ""I‚Äôm done with evil. And waffles.""  

The Emperor screamed, ""NOOO!"" as he slipped on a rogue pancake and fell into the reactor core.  

**Epilogue: Peace and Breakfast**  

The galaxy was saved. The Death Star exploded in a tasteful display of fireworks.  

Luke smiled at his friends. ""The Force was within us all along.""  

Han winked. ""And syrup is overrated anyway.""  

Chewbacca roared in agreement, holding up a plate of toast.  

The end.

Hello to this world!

I am from Belarus, but I have not lived there for the last few years. I am not a traveler, but I have already moved to several countries and my journey continues. That is why I am looking for friends all over the world. I do not care where you live, what gender and age you are. Sometimes people become good friends even without a lot of common interests. Why not?

Let me tell you a little about myself. I like reading books and listening to them in audio format. Sometimes I read comics. I like watching movies, cartoons. I adore horror films! I love video games. Especially indie games in pixel graphics. I also cross-stitch and sometimes take pictures of people. I love autumn and winter. Although lately I have been living in a place where there is only summer. I love hot coffee, walking and swinging. Sometimes I swim in the pool.

I am also a bit of a bore and not very talkative, but I am always ready to listen and support a friends if them needs it.

I love meeting new people. If you are also looking for friendship, just write to me.

P.S. I really don't care where you live, but if you are from Vietnam, it means that I will meet someone who is in the same location with me. I am new to this place and it would be especially nice for me to chat with someone who loves and knows this wonderful country.",5,1739059330.0,MeetPeople,0,1.0,False

Today I decided I was going to make a pie after using the air fryer on the stove top, (this is probably mostly my fault but I'm blaming the cat anyways.) Went to sit outside for 10 minutes while my cheap froozen pie cooked. Came back to the worst possible smell and ran to the kitchen were jerkface managed to bump the back burner on high because he was curious about the damn cherry pie. he only jumps on the counter when he doesn't get wet food so this wouldn't have happened if I just remembered to give him wet food before noon.


He ruined my beloved air fryer and my fianc√©'s coffee maker. Gave me an almost heart attack from the smoke and almost fire. AND MADE ME SPEND 2 HOURS CLEANING A GLASS STOVE TOP. Set me back 200 dollars to order replacements. I'm seriously still shaking from the adrenaline of the almost fire. 


Typing all this out made me realize i FORGOT the pie. Thankfully I just found out I turned the oven off during this ordeal and so no burnt pie... just some raw half cooked monstrosity.


So yeah TIFU by leaving plastic on the stove and not feed Mr. Buttface. Also never leave shit on the stove I'm a moron.

1il1ja6,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1il1ja6/did_i_do_something_to_my_mil/,Did I do something to my MIL?,"My boyfriend (M21) and I (F21) have been together for six years as of the 6th of this month. We successfully purchased our first home together in June of last year at the ages of 20 and 21. We decided to keep this significant milestone private until we felt the timing was right, as it was a major investment using our hard-earned money. We wanted to avoid any feelings of obligation from friends and family regarding gifts, so we opted not to host a housewarming party. Instead, I prepared dinner for both of our families on separate occasions, as that felt more meaningful to us!

I‚Äôve heard discussions about ‚Äúmother/son enmeshment,‚Äù and I wonder if that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm experiencing. Perhaps she resents my support for him, my affection, or the fact that I don‚Äôt try to control him? However, I cannot help but wonder if her feelings towards me stem from a sense of competition or insecurity. After six years of trying to foster a positive relationship, I‚Äôve come to realize that it‚Äôs not my responsibility to change her perspective. Her interactions with me have often been marked by passive-aggressive comments and inappropriate behavior, which my boyfriend has noticed but has difficulty addressing. 

My boyfriend's family tends to be quite judgmental, and we were concerned that their opinions might influence our decisions. When we finally shared the news, his mother initially appeared happy, but her expression quickly changed. I had anticipated she might be upset about us keeping the news from her (as normal), but she proceeded to ask personal questions about my finances‚Äîtopics we had never discussed before. While I felt obligated to answer her questions nicely, I was taken aback by her regarding whether my name was on the house. When we confirmed that it was, her demeanor shifted, and she expressed displeasure. As the evening progressed, she sent my boyfriend a text saying, ‚ÄúIf YOU need anything, always come home.‚Äù 

For context, my boyfriend‚Äôs mother is a nurse who lives with her husband two children, (15 and 16), 2 cats and 1 dog. She has been divorced three times and has been in a tumultuous relationship with her current partner for seven years. Two years ago, she moved into a duplex apartment due to ‚Äòpersonal issues‚Äô but 3 days later returned to her husband house. During that time, she frequently made disgusting jokes about how her apartment home was just a ‚Äúvacation house‚Äù for her because she was alone. My boyfriend and I had previously bought a storage unit together, she generously had given us the household items and furniture from when she moved. Now, we finally have our own home together. 

However, I have noticed that she often makes disparaging comments about me, which my boyfriend has observed as well. One particularly incident happened when I prepared dinner for her daughters after school. She was arriving home from work early, came in coughing and while I politely moved over, she grabbed his face and pretended to put her tongue in his mouth. Which led to all of us contracting COVID-19 from her, including my family. 

Additionally, last year she made a birthday post for my boyfriend, referring to him as her ""soulmate"" and mentioning that she had breastfed him until he was three years old. This behavior has also affected his social relationships, as his mother's actions on social media have made it difficult for him to maintain friendships. Especially in high-school. She frequently deactivates her Facebook account and has blocked my entire family, whom she has met only twice. During one of those meetings, she made an inappropriate comment to my father, who is a recovering addict, suggesting he should take Xanax for his daily struggles.

Since we moved into our new home, she has sent my boyfriend texts suggesting that he needs more appreciation in his life, and she has even offered to ‚Äúshare his phone number with younger nurses at her workplace.‚Äù Alongside negative comments trying to get her son to leave me, ‚ÄúOpen eyes. Use your gut, not your heart. It‚Äôs going to hurt, but we can survive the most unbearable decisions together. I promise I will never let you down.‚Äù She then sent him a rather personal photograph of herself outside in a chair, holding a coffee mug, with her camel-toe front and center. Her behavior has felt competitive and immature, as she seems to be vying for his attention.

More recently, she has been persistently texting my boyfriend about wanting to adopt a dog together, despite his very clear refusals. ‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt ready yet‚Äù, ‚ÄúNo‚Äù, ‚ÄúThat isn‚Äôt the dog we want‚Äù, or ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want a dog‚Äù just isn‚Äôt enough for her. Her urgency seems to stem from the recent loss of her older dog just as of 2 weeks ago. But it is concerning that she is not consulting us about the decision, and is instead focusing on her desires. It is obvious that her husband does not support the idea of bringing a new dog into their home either. 

Now, last night, while my boyfriend was at work, he called me in a panic because his mom unexpectedly bought him 8 CHICKENS. I was taken aback, but suggested he ask her if she could cancel the purchase instead. She responded by saying, ‚ÄúOh no, you can have them in April when you‚Äôre ready. Just make sure the coop is finished by then.‚Äù Then, she started over reacting, claiming, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just give them to someone else.‚Äù My boyfriend and I have discussed getting chickens this spring for our property, and he has already completed the base of the coop. However, for her to make such a significant decision without consulting either of us feels disrespectful.

Now that we finally have our own space, I‚Äôve reflected on our relationship over the last six years. It seems that she often bypasses her husband for decisions, seeks emotional validation from her son, and looks for his approval in everything she does. Additionally, she has sent him inappropriate pictures and has been quite bullying towards me. It feels as though she doesn‚Äôt recognize that he is capable of making his own choices. I have never tried to keep him from his family, hobbies, or career; instead, I‚Äôve always encouraged him to be the best version of himself, and I‚Äôve always been proud of our relationship. 

I‚Äôm unsure how to navigate this situation moving forward as I want to maintain a respectful relationship with her while also protecting my relationship with my boyfriend. Any advice or insights you could provide would be greatly appreciated.",3,1739059258.0,JUSTNOMIL,3,0.71,False

Had just gotten out of my Chinese class, only class on Friday. so.  the wally world was out of them so i went looking online for a while in a side idle.  now i had my backpack on cause i just left school, and my laptop goes with me every where.  

  
well i decided to wander around to see if i needed anything.  cruised through electronics.  same boring shit - though they had a pretty good deal in a 1440p 27"" curved monitor i debated.  i was about to leave cause i was walking up the main aisle back up front.  lo and behold i see an undercover ap peeping at me, he is trying to hide.  

now.  at 1st i did a double take, walked another 15 feet or so and turned around, and boom he instantly started looking at some baby formula.  

at this point i was really irritated, cause like, you got nothing else to do than pick a bad target.  

well.  i ran this dude ragged.  

turned left into the coffee/chocolate isle.  grabbed a bag of candy and a small box of k-cups.  hit one isle over, left them behind.  walked over to pick up a pack of blueberry muffins cause that shits the bomb yo and they just had a fresh delivery.  browsed the meats.  pick up a pair of beef kielbasas.    walked back to the milk dept and browsed there.  left a kielbasa in the cold section so it wouldn't go bad.  

and of course this dudes still trying to prowl around behind me .  

  
i started walking up front to check out, and right before the check out i saw him trying to spy me from behind a a clothes rack of shirts

  
it was at this time i decided i needed some new boxers.  so i went browsing for socks and boxers.  the boxers of course are all locked up behind tempered glass, because apparently stealing underwear is top priority for thieves now days .  

  
i popped a couple aisles back and forth, my shadow continues to bumble back and forth, once passing 2ft in front of me when i turned around quickly to walk back out

he was a little panicky but he stuck with it.  had the lady leave my nice pack of boxers up at the service desk.

i decided it was time to go look at food processors, because well that is what aisle i ended up in.  i left behind my pack of muffins in a muffin pan, and walked back up front to a checkout line.  i scanned around side eyed, and low and behold he is peeping me from behind a wall of sweatpants  

so.  i was tired of the game and i walked up to him.  he had to take his earpods out and pretend some bullshit or another

look dude.  who ever trained you did a piss poor job.  you are as obvious as using a baseball bat to play pool.  learn to pick your targets better. told him have a good day sir.  he was looking at me so stupidly.  there were a lot of people staring at us.  went up to service desk and bought my kielbasa and boxers and left.  

i was in a nice mood.  i know he would have stopped me after the 1st door and ruined his career on a false stop.  damn it i should have went back for the muffins.

sometimes ya just gotta fuck with people to teach them a lesson

Hello to this world!

I am from Belarus, but I have not lived there for the last few years. I am not a traveler, but I have already moved to several countries and my journey continues. That is why I am looking for friends all over the world. I do not care where you live, what gender and age you are. Sometimes people become good friends even without a lot of common interests. Why not?

Let me tell you a little about myself. I like reading books and listening to them in audio format. Sometimes I read comics. I like watching movies, cartoons. I adore horror films! I love video games. Especially indie games in pixel graphics. I also cross-stitch and sometimes take pictures of people. I love autumn and winter. Although lately I have been living in a place where there is only summer. I love hot coffee, walking and swinging. Sometimes I swim in the pool.

I am also a bit of a bore and not very talkative, but I am always ready to listen and support a friends if them needs it.

I love meeting new people. If you are also looking for friendship, just write to me.

P.S. I really don't care where you live, but if you are from Vietnam, it means that I will meet someone who is in the same location with me. I am new to this place and it would be especially nice for me to chat with someone who loves and knows this wonderful country.",4,1739059082.0,makingfriends,2,1.0,False

This might be a long ahh read. So if you haven‚Äôt had your morning coffee yet, feel free to scroll down to the tldr

I‚Äôm fairly new to the world of coffee brewing. Now, I‚Äôve always loved sipping coffee at cafes, and there‚Äôs something special about a freshly brewed cup of good coffee. So, I decided to learn how to make it myself recently.

About three months ago, I started with a French Press. I used cheap beans just to learn the basics, and more recently, I picked up a Kaldipress to elevate my brewing game.

But there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôm still struggling with: learning what good coffee is supposed to taste like. I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to differentiate bitterness from sourness, how to identify flavor notes, and how to tell if my brew went wrong or if the coffee itself just isn‚Äôt great.

I know this takes time, but I thought it‚Äôd be helpful for us coffee noobs to have a reference - a way to compare how a particular coffee is supposed to taste, so we can refine our brewing skills.

If this post gets some traction, I‚Äôd love to start a series called Coffee Notes (with mod approval, of course). 
The idea is simple:
Each post would focus on a commonly recommended coffee and its flavor profile as experienced by people who‚Äôve tried it. Here's how this would help :

- Instead of digging through multiple posts, we‚Äôd have a single thread with a variety of reviews on the same coffee.
- Seeing multiple reviews in one place will give a clearer idea of how the coffee tastes, and how it can vary with different brewing methods or preferences.
- People can share the brewing methods and recipes they used, offering more ways to enjoy the same coffee.
- As a noob, I‚Äôd love to ask for advice on how to improve my brew, and more experienced folks can share tips on getting the best flavors.

***Rules:***

- Share how the coffee tastes to you.
- Mention the brewer and brewing method you used (and feel free to drop your recipe if you can).
- *(Optional)* If you‚Äôve tried other coffees that taste similar, share your suggestions!

Let me know if this sounds interesting, and I‚Äôm looking forward to brewing some great conversations with all of you ‚òïÔ∏è

**Tldr** - I‚Äôm new to coffee brewing and want to make it easier for noobs like me to learn what good coffee should taste like. I propose a series called **Coffee Notes** (with mod approval), where we share reviews of commonly recommended coffees, detailing their flavor profiles, brewing methods, and recipes. This will help us compare notes, learn new techniques, and improve our brews.

1il1gst,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1il1gst/am_i_on_the_wrong/,Am I on the wrong?,"Hey everyone, I recently broke up with my boyfriend, and I‚Äôm feeling really conflicted. I‚Äôm F22, and he‚Äôs four years older than me M26. We were together for five years and lived together for a while. Since the beginning of our relationship, I knew he had a lot of past trauma, which led to anger issues. I always tried to be understanding and supportive, even when it was difficult.

I have ADHD, and while I know it can make things frustrating in a relationship, I genuinely tried to improve‚Äîlike being more organized and remembering things better. But it was exhausting trying to change things about myself every single day, and no matter how much effort I put in, it never seemed to be enough for him. I did it out of love because I wanted our relationship to work.

Whenever we argued, things escalated badly. He never physically hurt me, and I truly believe he never would, but he would punch walls, throw furniture, and create a very aggressive environment. I‚Äôd never experienced that before, and it always made me extremely nervous. Still, I stayed because I understood where his anger came from. I suggested therapy, but every time I did, he turned it into an argument, saying I was making him out to be a bad person.

Toward the end of our relationship, I started to feel exhausted. His words hurt more than anything‚Äîhe would say things like ‚ÄúI just want my girlfriend to remember to bring me water on walks,‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt you ask me what nail color I want?‚Äù He even compared me to his exes, telling me how they used to do things for him that I didn‚Äôt, but that he was with me because he loved me. I started feeling like I was never good enough, no matter what I did.

One of the last fights that made me seriously rethink everything started over cleaning. I was doing things differently than he liked (which happens sometimes because of my ADHD), and he started yelling, saying he was tired of me not doing things his way, that I wasn‚Äôt putting in enough effort, and that I just expected things from him without giving enough in return. The fight escalated, and he punched the fridge. That was the moment I snapped‚ÄîI was frustrated because we‚Äôre young, and destroying our own things over an argument is just stupid. I pushed him away from the fridge and told him to stop, but that only made things worse. He got in my face, screaming not to touch him because it made him even angrier. At that moment, I was scared.

I tried to walk away to get space, but he wouldn‚Äôt let me. Eventually, things calmed down, but then the police knocked on our door. A neighbor must have heard the fight and called, thinking it was a DV situation. Because he had been yelling, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt push me,‚Äù the police assumed I was the aggressor. We explained that everything was fine, but they still made him leave for a few hours and stayed outside to make sure he didn‚Äôt come back. After that, we acted like nothing had happened and moved on.

Our final argument‚Äîthe one that ended everything‚Äîstarted over something as small as making coffee. It was a Sunday, and I was taking my time getting up. I offered to make him coffee, but before actually making it, I passed by our bedroom and saw how messy it was. My brain couldn‚Äôt ignore it, so I started folding clothes. He got annoyed and asked why I‚Äôd offer to make coffee if I wasn‚Äôt going to do it right away. He had been off work, and I was the one working and exhausted all week. He had even told me I could clean on the weekend, so I didn‚Äôt think it was an issue.

I finally went to the kitchen, boiled the water, and started prepping my breakfast while waiting for the kettle. He came in frustrated, saying I should have been folding the clothes while the kettle was boiling instead of wasting time. That‚Äôs when it hit me‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt keep doing this. I already had doubts about our relationship, especially after the police situation, and at that moment, I realized I was done.

The fight escalated again, but this time, I was terrified that the police would come back. He told me he was tired of the relationship and didn‚Äôt want to do it anymore, and for the first time, I agreed. And that was it.

Now, we‚Äôve broken up but remained ‚Äúfriends.‚Äù I know we both love each other, and trust was never an issue between us. But he wants us to get back together in the future, and I don‚Äôt know if I can be with someone like this again.

Did I do the right thing by walking away? Or am I overthinking the police situation?",1,1739059065.0,ToxicRelationships,0,1.0,False

1il1f9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/ankylosingspondylitis/comments/1il1f9l/very_different_start_to_my_as_journey_im_curious/,"Very different start to my AS journey, I'm curious if anyone can relate (From first symptom to starting bios was 9 months - now on Cosentyx)","Hi all, recently joined this community and it's been great to see us all help & support each other through this rough assed journey of AS. My journey/symptoms/diagnosis seems to be very different from almost all I've read on here and I wanted to share and see if anyone could relate.

My symptoms started in a very short space of time. I think (not proven) that I worked my body to a point where it triggered the AS. I managed a burger restaurant and had dealt with covering someone being off sick and so worked a few weeks with very long hours (65 or so per week) on my feet and running around. I had spend the previous 4 years eating burgers/a lot of fried food - I don't know if this would set it off but hey, it's what happened before it all kicked off.

In Dec 2016 on my way to work in London I started having lower back pain - the kind where you feel like you've pulled a muscle and it hurts if you move it the wrong way. a few hours late and the pain had got worse till where it was a throbbing agony in my lower back - I think at most this took around 4 hours. I was getting shooting pain down my leg and walking was agony. 

I told my other manager that I was heading to A&E, when I saw the doctor where I said about the sciatic pain up and down my leg and the pain in my back. He thought I had sciatica and gave me some naproxen and another medication for the nerve pain (forgotten which one it was) and send me on my merry way with a two week sick note. He advised walking around helps ease the nerves and maybe get a massage?

Well I think the massage was the worst idea because I couldn't walk after. I had the two weeks off where I was in agony most of the time, couldn't move my lower back, could barely sleep - had a weird thing where I'd wake up after a couple of hours with pain shooting up and down my legs and I could only solve it by propping my legs up with pillows so they were bent. I had full on night sweats where I would wake up with my full body soaked in sweat. 

I've read and heard that exercise and walking can help with AS but for me it's the opposite - I need to rest and not put weight on my lower back. The more I'm on my feet the worse it is and the more I rest the better the pain is. 

After 2 weeks of resting the pain had started to go away a bit, I was still in pain but not nearly as much as when it first hit. i went back to work and hoped that I was over whatever the hell had been going on in my back. Oh how wrong I was. Within a few weeks the pain was back and in full force, I went back to the doctors, they referred me to get a physio appointment in a few weeks and put me on stronger meds (30mg co-codomol). My life was pretty much being in a constant flare and I had no idea what was going on or why - I am sure a lot of you can identify with this but the not knowing why you are in pain is a real added stress on top of the being in pain. I went to work, took co-codomol, waited for it to kick in, worked, went home, took more co-codomol and tried to do as little as possible - it was awful.

The first physio gave me some exercises and sent me on my way. I nearly cried that that was it - surely this level of pain isn't normal? I had another appointment made for 2 weeks later and spent those two weeks struggling through. I had to use a cane to help walk as I just couldn't on my own without medication. 

The second physio, when she examined me told me she thought something was off and I shouldn't be in this level of pain for sciatica - she (God bless her) referred me for a CT scan at Guys Hospital a few days later - I don't want to think what would have happened if she hadn't done it. 

The day before the scan I saw my mum who was visiting, we did not do much but did walk a little around the Portrait gallery, resting regularly and going for coffee somewhere. The day of the scan I could barely walk, I couldn't lift my leg up I was in so much pain. Couldn't have a shower as I couldn't get *into* the shower. Went to the hospital and had the scan, came back home and stayed as horizontal as I could. I was told I will hear about the results in a week or two.

The next morning I get a call from the doctors telling me to go into A&E as soon as possible. I was admitted into one of the wards in St Thomas's Hospital and I was told the inflammation was very bad in my lower back - it was either a really bad infection or AS. They needed to do a biopsy to check and so I spent two weeks in hospital waiting for the biopsy to happen - I was seen by doctors who told me I was ""a very interesting case"" which is not what you want to hear.

The biopsy happened and the results were inconclusive. After 2 weeks being stuck in a hospital bed my flare wound down and I was feeling a lot better so of course they just sent me home, changed my medication to celecoxib and would ""see how it went"". I almost cried as I was just like - what, why are you doing nothing?!!! 

Of course a month or so later (I remember it being in April over Easter. My AS does seem to love messing me over during holidays) I had another bad flare - not being able to walk, significant pain in my lower back, sciatic pain up and down my leg and the only way to stop it was to rest and be as horizontal as possible. I had another trip to St Thomas's and this time I had a bone biopsy which I don't wish on any of you. I did however rule out an infection and so I had it confirmed that it was AS.

Over the next several months - lets say early May to the mid July I would be in low-key pain, the celecoxib definitely helped but I had to take that several times a day to stave off the pain and it just felt like I was struggling through life. I had one or two flares but not as bad as the early ones but I was just in pain most of the time. It must have been late July/early august that I was told I had the options of going on biologicals and that the newest one that seemed to be the best was Secukinumab (Cosentyx) - oh my gosh the relief of knowing that this would hopefully be an end to the daily struggles and actually try and solve the pain long-term. 

I had a small flare at the beginning of September when I started bios and I haven't looked back since. It's been 8 1/2 years and I've had a few flares since but nothing like before, generally an achy back which can be killed off with some celecoxib. 

Has anyone else had a similar story? I know a lot of people have it happen over years but my first symptom to starting bios was 9 months.

I have had other issues and I'd find it interesting if those on Cosentyx would agree - I've had IBS which is steadily getting worse, I know it's one of the most common side effects but is there any way other than cutting things out of your diet that can help? There's so much I can't eat nowadays - onions/gluten/alcohol/beans/soya/pulses/honey and a bunch of other bits - it's driving me mad constantly living with gut pain and my doctors seem to just tell me it's normal.

Yes Father was up drinking and Mother stayed up late for no particular reason, making me stay up late, but even when I fell in to bed, sleep wouldn't take me. I don't know what happened. I was exhausted and ready for sleep and I was almost there, just drifting off and then suddenly, I was wide awake. My mind jerked me away. It was like sleep was a buss and I got one foot in the door before the driver shot away.

I was awake until at least 5 a.m. I drifted in that weird spot close to sleep where I was vividly hallucinating random scenes and sounds but I still felt myself too presently under the sheets, tossing and turning. Too hot, too cold, too many words in my head; If my mind would have just shut the fuck up for five seconds maybe it wouldn't have taken me so long. I developed to just lying like a corpse in a coffin repeating ""Go to sleep"" in my mind for who knows how long. It sort of work. I felt my limbs growing heavy and fuzzy but still, I stayed just a little too awake save me from the pain of today. I know I did fall asleep eventually. I struggled to get up in the morning. I stayed in bed until 10:45 a.m. and I would have stayed longer if I didn't have a cat. 

I have done nothing today accept prepare for tomorrow. The only good thing about my brain deciding to do overtime in the middle of the night was that it did give me a few good ideas. I thought of a new painting technique for the cover so today, I made sure I'd have all the tools i'd need to do it. It gave me the exact sentence I was missing for the next part of my book I need to rewrite so I typed that down in my notes to add to the manuscript tomorrow. I wrote down the story concept for the jesus / judas romance; that is the most i've actually accomplished.

My mind betrays me still. I can't think. What a day for this to happen. I'm rather certain this is the anniversary for when I started writing my book; the actual draft. And what have I done today? Nothing. But, then again, last year I was so depressed that It took me weeks to actually write; maybe it makes sense that uselessness would trike me again in a whole new way a year later.

 I type but the thought are jumbled, senseless, I want sleep. But I also want to be awake. It's only 6:50 p.m. I was to redo the day right but that's just not how it's going to be. All I can do is drink another coffee and hope sleep's bus driver is kinder tonight. Wish me luck. I'll need it.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19:00-19.30. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg))

Hi! I‚Äôm Stephanie. I‚Äôm 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection, something close to a relationship. I‚Äôd like to find someone I can confide in, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don‚Äôt have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I am single, and would prefer that you are as well. I‚Äôm not looking to change my situation at this time, but do crave a relationship-like connection. I‚Äôm not interested in anything solely or immediately nsfw in nature, I prefer to know a person quite well before that. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/zUFNfnA)

That‚Äôs just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

I was stupid and gave him too much information that I realize now he used to find out stuff about me online and by the time we set a date to meet I was half in love with him.   

So we set to meet at Biggby coffee in east Lansing Michigan and I go there to wait early because I'm so excited.   Suddenly this 6'6+ dark skinned guy weighing I would guess over 300 pounds comes up to me and says, ""You must be........."". My face must have said it all because he says, "" Don't run, I just really wanted to meet you!"" I

I start gathering up my stuff and he gets angry and tried to stop me but I just started walking out when suddenly at the top of his lungs he starts absolutely screaming, ""YOU RACIST PIECE OF SHIT!  YOU LED ME ON AND........"" Well just tons of other nonsense.   Now at this point at 7pm at night people are staring at me and judging me and I feel like the bad guy.  To make it worse, I had walked there.  I ended up dodging behind a dumpster to hide and catch my breath.  

Took me two years before I accepted a date from a dark skinned man again even tho I am attracted to men in general.  No matter the race.  (I feel like I have to say this because it seriously messed with my head even tho I know rationally it shouldn't have)

Long story short.. this time last year I weighed 128 pounds, and due to some emotionally stressful events, gained weight, about 11 pounds. I have an event coming up on the 28th of March and would like to see if I can get back to 128, or even 126 by that date.

I wish there were a way to post a photo of my scale daily, but I don't think this subreddit allows it.

My daily eating window will finish no later than 4pm, giving me at least 16 hours of fasting daily.

If I deviate from my food plan I will be honest about it, otherwise to start with my daily intake is as follows, beginning Monday 10th Feb:

- 200 grams lean chicken
- 500 mls bone broth
- 1 herbal tea at night before sleep.

I have already been low-carb for several days. I am also going to stop drinking coffee as I struggle with rosacea as well, and its a huge trigger. Giving up all dairy, including the cream in my coffee, also helps.

I will start adding 10 grams of fat per day in the form of salmon, but only after some progress.

My first goal is for the 1st of March, i'd like to be 130 pounds. It would be a great head start.

I welcome any constructive criticism or support :o)

I (34M) went on a date with a guy (33M) where we grabbed coffee first date and ended up hanging out a couple hours afterwards spontaneously. It was super fun and learned he just recently got out of a relationship a couple of months ago. At the end of the date I asked him what he was looking for. He said he was pretty open and mentioned how hard it is to make meaningful connections at our age. He also talked about wanting a career change and is studying to get into grad school. 

So about an hour after the date he texted me saying he had a great time and asked if I ever want to hangout again. I asked if he was free next weekend and we scheduled dinner for the upcoming Friday.

Throughout the week we were texting each other, and wanna note he didn‚Äôt seem to be the most avid texter but we were joking around each other here and there.

The day before we were texting each other throughout the day and at night he texted me saying he had given it a lot of thought and didn‚Äôt think he can maintain a relationship at the moment because of the studying and asked if it‚Äôs cool if we are just friends, which I said yes and totally understand. 

We ended up still grabbing dinner the next night, and it was a really nice time. After walking out of the restaurant, he held my hand and gave me a kiss. We ended back up at my place and had an intimate time.

Since then we‚Äôve had some texts here and there. Sounds like he‚Äôs been studying quite a bit and I don‚Äôt want to over text and be annoying af to him. I‚Äôm taking the approach as just friends and seeing where things might go in the future. 

I know I should still put myself out there but I just started dating again and this is driving me crazy! Should I still text him or keep it casual and text him whenever something comes up that we chatted about like tv shows, coffee shops, etc?",1,1739057690.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

- play area within the hotel. Our little one need to get energy our first thing and late at night before bed.

A coffee shop by my work has started to remember my order, so I stopped going. This happened once already at a different coffee shop, and I‚Äôll probably swing back there now that the staff and schedules are likely to have changed.

As much as I fully acknowledge that part of the depression spike in the population is caused by a complete lack of community, I just can‚Äôt get behind being remembered by people I order food from. I think it probably has to do with it entirely undermining the ‚Äúnobody is paying attention to you‚Äù thing that helps me feel less self-conscious in social interactions. Plus it‚Äôs just so embarrassing, like, I‚Äôm really wasting enough money on coffee that these people remember me. Awful.

I know this is an unpopular opinion because so many people seem to be upset by folks not remembering them as regulars (I literally just saw a post about this in my city‚Äôs sub), and this opinion doesn‚Äôt even mesh with my broader desire for more community spaces, yet I just can‚Äôt shake it.

1il0vil,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1il0vil/am_i_the_bad_roommate_or_are_my_feelings/,Am I the bad roommate or are my feelings justified? (NEED ADVICE ASAP),"This is my first time really ranting about this. Im will give many details so maybe my roommates will see this. I really hope they don't through.  I really need advice on this like PLEASE read if you have the time. Im desperate. 

The simple rundown: I constantly clean up after everyone and buy almost all the extra appliances, dishes, cookware, utensils, and more. I try to be there for them even when they are not there for me. I'll explain almost everything in this post. Maybe it is immature of me, but I've already talked to them about everything many times.  

Im in university and live in a four-bedroom apartment with three other people. I am a girl and I live with one other girl and two guys. The girl and I were desperate to find roommates to live in this certain apartment complex and we already knew one of the guys and he brought his best friend along. Ill call the girl roommate Sarah and the two guys Ben and Ethan. I have discussed Everything I wrote here with the girl roommate I live with, but honestly, it feels like she dismissed her behavior anyway. 

Everything was okay until I realized I was always cleaning after everyone. For context, I had bought all the cookware, including pots, pans, and cooking utensils, as well as the silverware and dishes. Our swifter, broom, and vacuum are also mine. I did not mind buying everything at first because I would still own those items later in life when I moved out. 

I realized that I have been cleaning after EVERYONE. Many times, dishes would be left over. And I admit, I am not the best person at dishes, so many times; I would just clean everything in the sink or that has piled over because, YES, I am also guilty. However, when it came to cleaning up the stove, counters, oven, microwave, floors, couches, the island, the coffee counter, and basically anything in our shared living space, I was the only one to do it. Every single day, Im picking up disgusting used napkins, leftover fast food, ANYTHING. I have two cars, and I have to clean up so they don't end up eating any of the leftover junk food that's left on the counter. 

The constant cleaning up after everyone has made me consistently stressed. And Im not saying that I don't make messes too. But instead of just cleaning up after myself, Im cleaning up after four people every day. It would be fine if they also cleaned up after four people daily but no, it is just me doing it. It may seem stupid, and I admit it might not seem like a big deal, but I prefer not to live in complete filth with trash, stains on counters, and food piled up everywhere in our shared living space. WE DID DISCUSS THIS BEFORE! Before we moved in, we agreed that we would try to keep everything clean. It does not have to be perfect, but at least not trash everywhere and nasty stains on our counters. 

I went through a depressive episode for the last month where I did not clean anything in the lviign room or kitchen. It got to a point where everything completely pilled up. All of our dishes were dirty, every single utensil, cookware, everything. I admit, some of those dishes were mine and I should have been cleaning up after myself. In my head, I was just exhausted from life and the grief I was going through but also the fact I felt like a maid for the three other adults I live with. 

A week ago when I was determined to get my life back together, I asked my roommates if we could all clean up the kitchen. The girl and 1 of the guys agreed. ""Sarah"" and ""Ben"" agreed to start cleaning and we set a time of 12 pm the following day. When it hit 12 pm, suddenly, Ben and Ethan were not at the apartment except for me and Sarah. We continued to clean anyway since we had previous plans. I knew no one would want to tackle the huge mountain of dirty dishes. After wiping most of the counters, I started the dishes, which took me around two hours. ""Sarah"" did help me for 1/3 of them so she did help! Ben took the trash out but honestly, I wish he did more. Ethan did not help us clean up, which is common for him to do. I do not remember the last time Ethan decided to help clean our living spaceI admit some of those dishes were mine, and I should have been cleaning up after myself.,e even though 

You may be wondering if I had communicated this before, and YES. Many times in our group chat I would text ""Hey when are you all free to do a group cleaning session"" Just to be left on read or delivered.  I can not count how many times I have communicated how we had to clean to avoid bugs. I would leave screenshots, but I do not want my roommates to find this post. 

  
My Faults. I do have many faults, such as leaving my dishes sometimes in the sink. I also contributed to the very large dish pile-up that happened, but I did clean up all of it. As a result, we split our two sinks into the girl's side and the boys' side. But now, I come home to dishes that Ethan had used to cook with hum and his girlfriend in my side. I clean them anyway because I don't want to be that annoying roommate, but I already know that Ethan and Ben don't like me as much. 

For context with my relationship with Ethan. I felt like we were becoming really close friends. However, one instance really made me feel like I was wrong with my judgement. He was suppose to come with me to get my tattoo at 5pm on a certain day. at 4:40 when we were about to leave, I asked Ben where he was and he said that he was out running errands. I texted Ethan asking when we was going to be back and he said that he was probably not coming because he told Ben and his girlfriend he was going to to go somewhere with them. It made me really frustrated because he told me that he was going to come with me but he blew me off last minute and told me he was going to hang out with other people. I want to make it clear, HE HAS EVERY RIGHT TOO! But it really hurt me and that basically gives a explanation of my relationship with him. I thought we were close but I don't think so. 

The whole reason why Im writing this post is because I just spent the last hour cleaning. I came back from running errands to find a lot of rice and dishes in my own sink that I knew I had not done. I cleaned them anyway because I knew it was Ben and his girlfriend. But they were in our living room and I don't want to argue. I cleaned everything, including the dishes, the floors, and the rest of the living room and kitchen. Ben and I have been accumulating recycling boxes, and I went to his room and asked when he had the time if he could take them down. YES! It is my fault that I asked him to take down the boxes when some of them were mine. I admit that is so fucked up to do. I just thought that because I clean up after his mess as a result of cooking he would. 

He said yes but then when I went to turn around his girlfriend yelled from the room ""You mean YOUR boxes?!"" In a very rude tone. I came back and just said, ""Yes, the recycling boxes"". But I never thought she would talk to me like that. I love her, and I had a feeling she didn't like me, but I didn't want to follow my gut feeling. Im a sensitive person so I went to my room to talk to my mom, and she told me not to cry LOL. She wants me to return her attitude, but I physically can't. I do not like being rude or mean to people. 

I spoke to my roommate Sarah about the situation and she said that me cleaning up their mess does not equate to Ben taking down my boxes. Which is completely reasonable but they are both Ben and mine boxes. But she has a point. After I finish writing this, I will just take down the boxes all together because I admit I was wrong for asking Ben to take them down. 

But all around, I feel crazy but still defeated. Am I in the wrong? Its okay, I really want brutally honest answers. I always want to make myself a better person and roommate. What can I do better? ",1,1739057360.0,roommateproblems,2,1.0,False

1il0qgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Contrave/comments/1il0qgm/contrave_anti_nauseas/,Contrave + Anti Nauseas,"Have had the most debilitating bouts of nausea that leave me out of action for days at a time. It usually happens after i drink coffee or alcohol (which I no longer do) but lately it's been happening more often and i can't pinpoint what it is.

So I called the doctor and requested some anti nauseas. Me being a women, they made me go in for a pregnancy test with the nurse which was negative. The nurse said she'll go get the doctor, then returned 5 minutes later saying the doctor already sent a prescription to the pharmacy. 
 
The thing is, I've had Domperidone and Ondansetron (Zofran) multiple times, and Ondansetron works wonders for me while Domperidone does absolutely nothing. Since I didn't actually get to see the doctor myself, I didn't have a chance to tell her this. So the prescription she sent to the pharmacy ended up being Domperidone.

I tried taking it anyways as I figured it's better than nothing but it did absolutely nothing for my nausea. A few weeks later I was extremely sick again and called the doctor to request some Ondansetron. They told me I had to book an appointment for the doctor again since they ""hadn't prescribed Ondansetron to me from this practice before""  (I've been given it many times from doctors before)

At my appointment I told her all of the above and she said she wants to do tests for my liver because Contrave can sometimes affect that. She also prescribed me some Metamucil to make me a bit more regular as 2-3 days has been my normal lately. 

Basically she's trying to get to the bottom of what exactly is causing my nausea, and I was happy to go along with blood tests etc but asked if i could have the anti-nauseas on top of that and she said she'll only give me a couple because i ""shouldn't be taking them too often"" 

I was kinda like .... what? I'm not planning on popping them 24/7, but I told her I really need to have them on hand for those really bad bouts of nausea, and that I'll likely need more than 7 because I don't want to have to come back to the doctor and spend another $75 just to
get some more. She then said that being nauseous all the time isn't normal, which is why we're doing these tests. So because of that she only prescribed me 7 ondansetron. 

How much does everyone else usually get prescribed? Is it normal to only get 7? I totally get what she means saying she wants to get to the bottom of why I feel constantly nauseous, but why would she not want me to have anti nauseas to deal with it in the meantime? The way I see it, it's like someone having chronic headaches and refusing to give them paracetamol to deal with the pain.
I guess this is lowkey a question and a rant all in one lol

TDLR; Doctor won't prescribe me more than 7 anti nausea pills, because it's not normal to feel nauseous. Has anyone else experienced this?

Dad, I found a bag with some yarn and art supplies. No idea how they got in there...*puts on most angelic face* 

Unfortunately, I have to work today and I am honestly annoyed that I have to go to work instead of losing myself in a rabbit hole of creation. 

All I can think about is finishing one of my blankets (crochet - I have three started atm) and starting my art journal. 

My job isn't stupid - I like what I do (caregiver to Alzheimers/Dementia elders) and some of my coworkers are more tolerable than others. So, it's not bad. 

But hell, my brain is in my house, music blaring and all my supplies spread out on the table with a hot cup of coffee as I cackle like a witch deciding on what to create. 

I mean, it just makes me giddy just thinking about it.

But no. I have to be an adult. And have a job. Rumor has it that is how you get the Craft Fairy to drop surprises in your shopping cart. üòÖ

I typically don't mind going to work but today? I actually have something better to do and it's been too long since I was *this* excited about anything. 

Still...


**WORK SUCKS RIGHT NOW.** 

And I feel like a bad aide because I *truly* love my residents - they are so cool. ^_^

So, I also feel a bit conflicted. x_x 

My residents deserve my best and Idw to be patronizing or go all space cadet on them because I can't get my head in the game. Ah, so frustrating!

*Safe to walk around by myself
*Rent budget is up to $2,000 but could be stretched to $2,500 for the perfect location. 
*A variety of good local restaurants, coffee shops, bakeries, jazz clubs and/or within walking proximity to these spots
*Close to a Whole Foods and/or more grocery
 market and farmers markets
*Side streets with a residential feel
*Quiet at night and trying to avoid living near a loud area with active bar scene 
*Keeping my car so will probably need a garage or rent one close by if that‚Äôs a thing?

Meds are Adderall XR 10 mg (this mg for about 4 years, but I've taken it since high school and at a much larger dose back then.) Trintellix 20 mg and Lamictal 100 mg. B12 and vitamin D. Once a day for all. 

I have had a blood test and am going to the doctor on Monday. Blood test came back seemingly normal, but I haven't had anyone explain it to me yet. That's for Monday. 

I'm not sure what's going on. It feels like my meds half stopped working and my emotions became incredibly flat, no one and nothing feels real and time feels nonexistent. 

Timeline:

Had a period where my left arm and leg started becoming 'numb' or just felt like I lost awareness of them. Eventually got better after a few weeks. Then suddenly my right foot would feel warm and wet on and off throughout the day. It's become much less frequent as of now, I think. 

Had a few days where I felt tired and sniffly. The weather was warming up, so I figured it was having a weird reaction to that. It wouldnt be the first time weather going from cold to warm made me tired. Was on my period, which is highly regular. It ended uncharacteristically early. 

Ran out of melatonin so I took a new brand of 10 mg melatonin (my usual.)

Next day, started feeling weird, blew it off as illness or the weather.

Over the next few days everything and everyone stopped feeling real. My emotions became very flat. Social anxiety ramped up. EXTREME, debilitating fatigue. Zero focus or sense of time. Arms and legs have feeling but somehow don't. A depression unlike anything I've ever felt before. Began feeling suicidal because I spent 4 days feeling trapped behind glass with no way out, so I texted a hotline and called friends. 

On the third night my friend gave me a brand of melatonin I've used. I got rid of the other stuff and started using this one, which is 5 mg instead. 

Today, the morning was rough and I felt unsteady. Started to feel a tad better after taking my Adderall and drinking some coffee. Emotions felt like they were coming back some. 

I'm staying at a friend's house this weekend and I still don't feel entirely there, but something seems to be improves a bit. This sounds weird, but sometimes the Adderall side effects of anxiety helped me keep on track and I'm really feeling very little, which isn't great for my productivity, which I already suffer with. The world still feels weird and somewhat dreamy.

Additional: 

About a month and a half before all this I had a terrible ear infection. It took weeks to go away and my right ear really siffered. I ended up seemingly contracting it again but much more mild. Seemed to go away, but my right ear still bothers me and still has some muffling. Pretty positive I have TMJ as it also runs in my family. 

My neck and back have been bothering me on and off. I'm a top heavy girl who also has the habit most of us have of looking down at my phone. As of about 3 weeks ago it's started to feel like something in my neck was rubbing against something else. Very uncomfortable.

Frankly I'm scared and weirded out. I'm afraid I'll never feel normal again, or that something in my brain or nerves broke and my meds will never work again, which is the only thing that's helped me with ADHD and depression. When I talked to my original PCP, he told me that going to a mental health facility could be a good idea. I decided to make an appointment with someone else in the same office so I can get perspective from a doctor that hasn't known me since high school. I'll be seeing her Monday. 

Has anyone had a similar experience? Or heard of such a thing? The only times I can think that are even remotely similar are when I've had really bad infections and for some reason those messed with how well my meds worked before getting better again. ",1,1739055755.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Black dragon black tea: Good, not much to say    

Snow dragon Chinese yellow tea: Description was accurate (hot buttered noodles) except for ‚Äúvery sweet aftertaste‚Äù, didn‚Äôt get that. Didn‚Äôt like it, didn‚Äôt finish it. 
  
Organic offering of mint (cardamom basil mint herbal blend): Hated it!!! Couldnt drink it beyond a few forced sips. Tasted so strongly of licorice (I assume licorice root) and weird overly sweet taste almost like stevia‚Ä¶
  
Life support with lemon, myrtle, tulsi and mint: Not disgusting but didn‚Äôt really like it. Maybe I used too much tea? Came out very dark and ‚Äústrong‚Äù. Then I added a bunch of water but it didn‚Äôt improve much. Almost like sucking on a penny, kind of metallic taste- sort of acetone kind of taste 
  
Herb chai: very good
  
White tea: just fine 
  
Organic on the mend: good/fine taste, the smell is amazing. Maybe it‚Äôs the cinnamon? 
  
Bao ba cha: good, a little weird but can‚Äôt place why
  
Puerh: mild flavor, but kinda tastes like dirt
  
Tumeric ginger refresh: good!

I enjoyed this. I wanted something stronger and have not really touched maduros before.

I was not disappointed, without a sense of taste (head injury), I did get the stronger flavour from it. What felt like dark chocolate, and a coffee note. 

It was consistent throughout for me. It felt a little more intense in the final third. Thinking of grabbing some more. I got this in a CAO sample box in the red carry case I bought last year in Italy. CAO has some great sticks in their range.

-Unreliable dad hacks like renaming broccoli to ‚ÄúDinosaur Trees‚Äù so kids eat it

-Last-ditch survival tactics like how to win a bedtime battle with pure deception

-Parenting field reports like when your kid out-logics you, and you have to accept defeat

It‚Äôs for dads who are tired of boring parenting advice and just want to survive the daily madness with a little humor and maybe a little less guilt.
