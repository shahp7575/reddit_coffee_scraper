## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a teak coffee table for outdoor use requires careful consideration of several features that determine its longevity, functionality, and aesthetic appeal.

**Material Quality:** The quality of teak wood is paramount. Grade A teak, sourced from the heartwood of mature trees, offers the highest oil content and density, making it naturally resistant to rot, insects, and weather damage. Tables made from Grade B or C teak may be less durable and require more maintenance. Look for tables that specify the grade of teak used in their construction.

The source and sustainability of the teak are also important. Opt for tables made from sustainably harvested teak, certified by organizations like the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). This ensures that the wood is sourced responsibly, minimizing environmental impact.

**Construction and Joinery:** Robust construction and precise joinery are essential for a teak coffee table to withstand outdoor conditions. Mortise and tenon joints, secured with marine-grade adhesive or stainless steel hardware, provide exceptional strength and stability. Avoid tables with flimsy construction or visible gaps in the joints.

Examine the overall craftsmanship of the table. Smooth, sanded surfaces and neatly finished edges indicate attention to detail and contribute to the table's longevity. Check for any signs of warping, cracking, or unevenness in the wood.

**Design and Style:** Teak coffee tables come in a wide range of designs and styles, from classic rectangular shapes to modern round or oval designs. Choose a style that complements your existing outdoor furniture and the overall aesthetic of your outdoor space. Consider the height of the table in relation to your seating arrangement.

Some tables feature additional design elements, such as slatted tops for drainage, built-in shelves for storage, or adjustable feet for leveling on uneven surfaces. These features can enhance the functionality and versatility of the table.

**Weather Resistance:** Teak wood is naturally weather-resistant due to its high oil content, but additional treatments can further enhance its protection against the elements. Some tables are pre-treated with teak oil or sealant to provide extra protection against moisture, UV rays, and mildew.

Consider the climate in your region when choosing a teak coffee table. In areas with harsh winters or heavy rainfall, it may be necessary to store the table indoors or cover it with a protective tarp during the off-season. Regular cleaning and maintenance can also help to prolong the life of your teak coffee table.

Key features of the best teak coffee tables include:
* Grade A teak construction
* Mortise and tenon joinery
* Weather-resistant finish
* Stylish design

## Core Benefits

A teak coffee table offers several practical benefits for outdoor spaces, enhancing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

**Durability and Longevity:** Teak wood's natural resistance to rot, insects, and weather makes teak coffee tables exceptionally durable and long-lasting. Unlike tables made from other materials, teak tables can withstand the rigors of outdoor use for many years with minimal maintenance. This durability translates to long-term cost savings as you won't need to replace your table frequently.

A well-maintained teak coffee table can last for decades, becoming a cherished part of your outdoor living space. Its ability to withstand the elements ensures that it will retain its beauty and functionality for years to come.

**Natural Beauty and Warmth:** Teak wood's rich, golden-brown color and distinctive grain patterns add natural beauty and warmth to any outdoor setting. The wood's smooth texture and elegant appearance create a welcoming and inviting atmosphere. Over time, teak naturally weathers to a beautiful silver-gray patina, adding to its character and charm.

The natural beauty of teak complements a wide range of outdoor styles, from traditional to contemporary. Its timeless appeal ensures that it will remain a stylish and sophisticated addition to your outdoor space for years to come.

**Low Maintenance:** While teak wood is naturally durable, it requires minimal maintenance to retain its beauty and functionality. Regular cleaning with soap and water is typically sufficient to remove dirt and debris. Applying teak oil or sealant periodically can help to maintain the wood's original color and protect it from the elements.

Compared to other outdoor furniture materials, such as metal or plastic, teak requires significantly less upkeep. This allows you to spend more time enjoying your outdoor space and less time worrying about maintenance.

**Versatility:** Teak coffee tables are versatile pieces of furniture that can be used in a variety of outdoor settings. They provide a convenient surface for drinks, snacks, books, or decorative items. They can also serve as a focal point for outdoor seating areas, creating a comfortable and inviting space for relaxation and entertainment.

Their versatility extends to their compatibility with different outdoor styles. Whether you have a traditional patio or a modern deck, a teak coffee table can seamlessly integrate into your existing décor.

## FAQs Section

Common questions arise when considering a teak coffee table for outdoor use.

**How do I maintain my teak coffee table?**
  Regular cleaning with mild soap and water is typically sufficient. To maintain the original color, apply teak oil or sealant every few months. If you prefer the silver-gray patina, simply clean the table and allow it to weather naturally. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the wood.

**Will my teak coffee table turn gray?**
  Yes, teak wood naturally weathers to a silver-gray patina over time when exposed to the elements. This is a natural process and does not affect the wood's durability. If you prefer to maintain the original golden-brown color, you can apply teak oil or sealant regularly.

**Can I leave my teak coffee table outdoors year-round?**
  Teak wood is naturally weather-resistant and can withstand outdoor conditions year-round. However, in areas with harsh winters or heavy rainfall, it is recommended to store the table indoors or cover it with a protective tarp to prolong its life.

**Is teak wood environmentally friendly?**
  Teak wood can be environmentally friendly if it is sourced from sustainably managed forests, certified by organizations like the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). Look for tables that specify that the teak is sustainably harvested.

And here’s the honest bit: most “local SEO tips” you find online are either recycled from 2012 or so broad you could swap “plumber” for “dog groomer” and not notice.

This isn’t that.  
This is the shortlist of moves that actually make the phone ring. (Yes, I track it. Yes, even on weekends.)

# 1. Hyper-Local Landing Pages > Generic Service Pages

Skip the generic “Plumbing Services” page.  
Make it:

/plumbing-denver-co/  
/plumbing-lakewood-co/

Each one should talk about *that* neighborhood, use photos from *that* area, and include 2–3 testimonials that literally say the location name.  
It’s boring work, I know, I’ve stared at Lakewood job photos until my coffee went cold — but it prints leads. Every. Single. Time.  
Also, pro tip: resist the urge to “just copy-paste and swap the city name.” Google notices. People notice, too.

# 2. Build Your GBP to Rank for More Than Your Main Keyword

Most folks pick “Plumber” in their Google Business Profile and stop there.  
That’s like ordering a burger and forgetting fries exist. Or a milkshake, for that matter.

Add secondary categories and service lists so Google has more reasons to show you.  
Example: A landscaping company can also list:

* Gardener (yes, even if you mostly do patios, it still gets clicks)
* Tree Service
* Snow Removal Service, winter jobs can keep you afloat when no one’s thinking about lawns

I’ve seen this multiply impressions by four, literally overnight. Okay, maybe a week. but still.

# 3. Own Local “Entity” Signals

Think of Google as an AI gossiping with itself it connects facts, patterns, names.  
If it “knows” you’re woven into a city’s daily life, you rank easier.

Do this:

* Get listed in niche directories (skip the “everyone’s on it” ones go for trade-specific)
* Get your business name on local blogs, news sites, or event pages even without links. Unlinked mentions still count, and Google loves them.
* Sponsor one small local event. I had a client sponsor a high school chili cook-off they walked away with press mentions, backlinks, and two new customers they met while waiting in the chili line. I’m not saying chili is an SEO strategy, but… maybe it is.

# 4. Use GMB Posts Like a Social Feed

Weekly posting on Google Business Profile is absurdly underrated.  
Treat it like Instagram, just with fewer filters:

* Before/after project photos
* Quick “how-to” tips (“How to unclog a sink without a wrench”) short enough to read on a coffee break
* Seasonal offers (before snow hits, before the heat wave urgency works)

One client doubled their call volume just from posting consistently. That’s it. Didn’t touch their site.

# 5. The “Local FAQ Trap”

Most small biz blogs? Honestly useless.  
They chase broad topics like “How to choose a plumber,” which is code for “You’ll never rank here.”

Instead, aim for local-specific FAQs:

* “Cost to Replace a Water Heater in Denver 2025” (yes, put the year it’s a click magnet)
* “Do You Need a Permit to Build a Fence in Austin?”

These are low competition, high buying intent. And sometimes they rank in days. Not months. Sometimes before the coffee’s even cold.

# 6. Track Leads, Not Just Traffic

I’ve seen people stare at traffic graphs like they’re tracking Bitcoin.  
Stop.

Install call tracking and form tracking.  
If your new “Fence Repair in Austin” page isn’t bringing in calls? Scrap it. Try another angle. There’s no glory in a page that ranks but never earns.

**The Boil-Down:**

Here’s the thing.  
If I could only do two moves for the next three months, it’d be:

1. Hyper-local landing pages with proof you’ve actually worked there (photos, testimonials, the whole bit)
2. An over-optimized Google Business Profile with secondary categories and weekly posts (and don’t skip weeks, momentum matters)

Run that combo and I’d put money on it outperforming any “write blogs and get backlinks” advice. Probably faster too.

And if you’re curious, I can show you exactly how to build a local landing page that ***converts*** a headline to CTA. That’s the part that turns a casual browser into a paying customer. Or three.",0,1754914916.0,smallbusinessUS,0,0.5,False

I’ve been using this coffee maker daily, and it certainly does a lot of things right. With its promise of innovative brewing technology, customizable options, and impressive reservoir capacity, there's plenty to unpack here. However, it’s not without its quirks that may leave some coffee enthusiasts wanting more.

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing that struck me when unboxing this coffee maker was its sleek, modern design. It's visually appealing without being over-the-top, fitting nicely with most kitchen aesthetics. Its compact dimensions (7.05 x 17.91 x 14.41 inches) mean it doesn’t hog your counter space—something I appreciated in my already cramped kitchen. The dual-position reservoir is a thoughtful addition, letting you adjust it to fit your layout. I found that having the removable tank was a blessing when it came to refilling or cleaning. It’s worth noting, though, that the unit feels plasticky in certain parts—while it’s lightweight at 5.9 pounds, some might find that it lacks the durable feel of higher-end coffee machines.

**MultiStream Technology: What’s the Deal?**

This is where the magic happens—so the brand claims. The MultiStream Technology is supposed to evenly saturate coffee grounds for maximum flavor and aroma extraction from K-Cup pods. In practice, I found that the flavor was noticeably stronger compared to older Keurig models. It really shines when you select the Strong Brew option, which elevates an otherwise standard cup to something more robust and café-like. That said, I noticed the results weren’t 100% consistent; every now and then, a pod would brew weaker than expected, leaving me a bit disappointed. Still, for the most part, it extracted flavors beautifully.

**Grab your [Keurig 062151515284] at the best price on Amazon.**  

**Customizability and Brew Sizes**

One thing I loved is the range of settings this coffee maker offers. You can brew multiple cup sizes (6, 8, 10, or 12 oz), which was a lifesaver during family gatherings when everyone wanted something different. The Strong button is another standout feature, adding a bolder kick to your cup when you need it most. Brewing over ice was another highlight—summer mornings got a lot better with iced coffee ready at the push of a button. While these options enrich the coffee-making experience, I couldn’t help but think a temperature control option would have completed the package.

**Performance and Efficiency**

Mornings can be chaotic, but one thing I hate waiting for is a cup of coffee. Keurig delivers on its promise of speed, with a freshly brewed cup ready in just minutes. It’s efficient, but I did notice it’s a bit louder than expected. The noise isn’t excessive, but it might wake a light sleeper in the next room. Despite the modest noise level, it’s hard to complain about the speedy performance—especially on groggy mornings when time feels like your worst enemy.

**Positives**

- MultiStream Technology for enhanced flavor extraction  
- A variety of brew sizes and customizable options (Strong and Over Ice)  
- Modern, compact design with a dual-position, removable reservoir  
- Quick brewing process that saves valuable time  

**Weaknesses**

- Occasionally inconsistent flavor extraction with some pods  
- No temperature control feature for further customization  
- Slightly noisy during operation  

**Competing Products**

Comparing this coffee maker to its competitors like the Nespresso Vertuo or the Cuisinart SS-10, the differences are noticeable. While the Keurig stands out for its MultiStream Technology and iced coffee functionality, the Nespresso excels in delivering a more luxurious crema and superior pod options. Meanwhile, the Cuisinart offers a reusable filter and a larger water tank but lacks the same speed and simplicity as the Keurig. Depending on what you value most—be it flavor depth, flexibility, or convenience—the choice can vary greatly. Still, this coffee maker holds its own in the crowded single-serve market. 

**Worth Every Penny?**

When it comes to practicality and price, the Keurig K-Supreme proves to be a smart buy for those who want quick, flavorful coffee without breaking the bank. While it’s not the cheapest option out there, the blend of features, convenience, and reliable performance certainly justifies the price point. The machine covers almost all bases for a single-serve coffee maker, and despite a few shortcomings, delivers excellent value for money overall.

Bahrain’s 2025 Business Environment: The Regional Standout\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting., 2025 saw Bahrain’s non-oil GDP surge by 5.3%, with business registrations hitting an all-time high via the Sijilat portal. Reuters highlights sustained government investments in fintech and logistics, buoyed by advantageous free zone expansions and pared-down red tape.\
The Economic Development Board (EDB) points to more than 8,000 new commercial registrations processed in Sijilat in the last 12 months—many in Bahrain Bay’s new office clusters or the ever-busy Diplomatic Area. Multinationals consider Bahrain both for its 99% foreign ownership policies (source) and its reputation for smooth company formation.\
And, yes, you’ll find Ramadan-adjusted business hours, plenty of majlis-style networking over gahwa, and the classic Bahrain courtesy: a meeting isn’t done until the dates have been served.\
For those considering their own Bahrain company formation, check the official government site for the newest regulatory updates, or this detailed guide for up-to-date, actionable steps.\
\
What Is a WLL (With Limited Liability) Company?\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration. is Bahrain’s go-to company type for SMEs, family businesses, and international entrepreneurs. Legally defined under Bahrain’s Commercial Companies Law (as revised through 2025), a WLL:\
\
Provides liability protection to its shareholders\
Requires a separate commercial registration (“CR”) via Sijilat\
Demands a unique constitutional document (Memorandum & Articles of Association)\
Can own assets, employ staff, and open bank accounts\
\
Why choose a WLL? Bahraini law generally allows 100% foreign ownership (almost as open as ADGM in the UAE, but with less cost and regulatory complexity). Plus, WLL offers flexibility in ownership, management, and business scope.\
Curious about entity types? This resource breaks them down in detail.\
\
Current WLL Shareholder Rules: The Numbers & Legal Details\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.\
- Maximum shareholders: 50 individuals or corporate entities\
\
The WLL company structure is expressly limited to between 2 and 50 shareholders under the Bahraini Commercial Companies Law (Law No. 21 of 2001, as amended by the 2025 update).\
\
These shareholders can be individuals or companies (local or foreign). Ownership can be split any way, subject to the company’s Memorandum.\
2025 Regulatory Twist\
Importantly, as of February 2025, Bahrain’s MOICT (Ministry of Industry & Commerce) requires notarized identification and beneficial ownership declarations for all WLL shareholders, not only those with 10%+ stakes. This reform, announced in the EDB’s spring update, aims to tighten anti-money laundering (AML) controls.\
My Personal Challenge (and How I Solved It)\
When I set up a client’s digital consultancy in Bahrain Bay last year, we nearly tripped over Sijilat’s shareholder documentation rules: one corporate shareholder was missing a legalized Board Resolution. The smart fix? Use a local notary in the Seef District—early morning, right after prayer time, when queues are shortest. Saved hours, and the Sijilat clerk actually thanked us for “not being last-minute!”\
\
Expert Perspective: Why the Shareholder Limit Matters\
Some try to game the system with nominee shareholders, but that’s risky—especially post-2025. The 50-shareholder cap ensures WLLs don’t morph into quasi-public companies, preserving their SME nature.\
Surprisingly, Bahrain’s approach stands out: while Saudi Arabia requires higher minimum share capital and stricter residency for LLCs, Bahrain’s WLLs offer more flexibility in both composition and ownership nationality. Even compared to the UAE’s mainland LLC, the Bahraini WLL is usually lighter on formalities.\
From firsthand experience, keeping your WLL shareholder count below 10 is not just easier—it’s better for decision-making and compliance management. Once you approach 20+ shareholders, annual meetings become a logistical headache, especially during Ramadan when business days are shorter.\
If you need a larger investor pool, consider other entity types like a Joint Stock Company (BSC); see the detailed comparison.\
\
Step-by-Step: Forming a WLL in Bahrain (Insider Tips)\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation.\
- Consider free zone benefits if you need import/export privileges.\
3. Apply via Sijilat Portal\
\
Prepare digital format docs for upload.\
Optimal timing: Submit early in the week (Sunday or Monday morning). Fridays see lower staff attendance due to prayers, and post-Ramadan Mondays are always slammed.\
Use professional translation services if needed—my go-to is Bahrain Translation Services in Seef; their certified translations never got rejected.\
\
4. Pay Fees & Collect CR\
\
Fees range (as of June 2025): BHD 200–600 for basic registration, plus notary & translation costs.\
Receive CR typically within 5-10 business days if paperwork is flawless.\
Need step-by-step support? This resource is gold.\
\
5. LMRA & Tamkeen Registration\
\
Register staff and company for labor permissions and support grants.\
Schedule appointments early—LMRA is busiest at start and end of each month.\
\
\
Don’t forget: Post-CR, open your corporate account at one of the international banks in Bahrain Bay—you’ll save time over busier Diplomatic Area branches.\
\
\
Costs & Budgeting for WLL Formation in 2025\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs.\
- Notary & Translation: BHD 60–150 per shareholder (faster service in Seef or Diplomatic Area)\
- Address Rental: Coworking spaces start from BHD 50/month; prime Seef offices can reach BHD 350-700/month.\
- Professional Fees: Formation consultants charge BHD 500–1,500.\
Want precise numbers, including industry-specific breakdowns? Check this up-to-date cost guide.\
Insider budget tip: Bundle translation and notary services with your formation provider—you’ll pay less and skip repeat visits. Tamkeen grants also subsidize SME formation for Bahrainis and, occasionally, GCC expats.\
\
Compliance, Registration & Accountancy: The Details\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation.: Required for all WLLs; set quorum and minute-taking procedures.\
- Financial Audits: Compulsory for companies with BHD 20,000+ turnover.\
- Accounting: Outsource bookkeeping to avoid missed deadlines—Bahrain’s MOICT fines add up quickly.\
- Regulatory renewals:** Commercial Registration (CR) must be renewed annually, usually through Sijilat.\
Surprisingly, Bahrain’s recent push (since May 2025) for digitalized beneficial ownership disclosures means you can now complete 80% of renewals online. But don’t get complacent: if you skip the AGM minutes upload, Sijilat may freeze your CR.\
\
Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them\
\
Incorrect Shareholder Numbers: Stopping at one shareholder (common, especially for solo founders) isn’t allowed. Always have at least two, even if one has only a token share.\
Notarization Oversights: MOICT only accepts original notarized documents (no scans).\
Skipping Legalization: Overseas shareholders must legalize and apostille their documents—do this in parallel to save time.\
Underbudgeting: Many forget to account for annual costs, not just setup fees.\
Ignoring AGM Requirements: Failure to document meetings risks regulatory fines.\
\
A trick I use: Schedule your shareholders’ AGM at a hotel lounge in Seef—combine business with Bahrain-style hospitality, and everyone leaves happy.\
\
FAQ: WLL Shareholders & Bahrain Business Structures\
Q1: Can a WLL have just one shareholder?\
No. Bahraini law requires at least two. But, a “Single Person Company” (SPC) structure allows for sole ownership—see details here.\
Q2: Is 100% foreign ownership allowed?\
Yes, for most sectors. See the full sector list and details here.\
Q3: What if I want more than 50 shareholders?\
Consider forming a Bahrain Shareholding Company (BSC). Review entity differences here.\
Q4: How do I register a WLL in Bahrain as a foreigner?\
You can register directly, no local partner needed for most activities. Detailed process here.\
Q5: Do I need a local office address?\
Yes, a physical address is mandatory. Coworking spaces and serviced offices in Seef District or Bahrain Bay are cost-effective and accepted by MOICT.\
Q6: Can I get professional help for the process?\
Absolutely. I recommend KeyLink—they’re efficient, clear, and know every inside trick (I’ve used them for tough multi-national setups).\
\
Starting your WLL in Bahrain is both rewarding and refreshingly straightforward—if you’re prepared. Keep shareholder numbers between 2 and 50, prep your docs, and work with reliable local partners. And remember, the best deals (and the fastest approvals) still happen over coffee in a Seef District lounge.\

I’m based in the UAE and have been doing a lot of research on coffee roaster manufacturers and technical institutes in the region. After comparing many options, I’ve narrowed it down to two of the top brands in the Middle East:
•BESCA (Turkey)
•RC Tech (Iran)

Both companies offer hands-on training programs and manufacture professional roasting machines. I’m planning to either build or purchase two machines:
•A 1kg sample roaster
•A 5kg production roaster

Shared Features (Both Brands):
•Ceramic-coated drums
•Premix gas burners
•PLC control systems
•Fully compatible with Artisan and Cropster

Drum Design Differences:
•BSKA: Double-walled drum
•RC Tech: Triple-walled composite drum

Final Prices in the UAE:
•RC Tech (Iran):
• 1kg = ~$6,000
• 5kg = ~$10,000
•BESCA (Turkey):
• 1kg = ~$15,000
• 5kg = ~$27,000

What I’m Looking For:

I’m not just buying machines — I want to learn deeply about how they work: how to build, modify, maintain, and troubleshoot them. That’s why choosing the right place for training is important to me.

What matters most to me:
•Quality of hands-on training
•Real-world learning and lab access
•Industry reputation and after-sales support
•Long-term reliability of the machines
•Whether the price difference is truly reflected in performance or build quality

If you’ve had experience with either company or have any insight into their training programs or machine durability ,I’d love to hear your thoughts.

1mnb5tr,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mnb5tr/white_shadow_part_1_the_shore/,White Shadow Part 1 The Shore,"
The dead bodies were spread out on the shore of the misty lake.

Jack sipped his dull coffee with tired eyes that looked down upon the pale dead bodies that laid before him. The police officers set up a perimeter on the shore of the lake to prevent the media or anybody from stumbling upon the crime scene. 
The flashes of light dominated the crime scene as pictures were taken of the cruelty that laid before them. 

Jack was a skinny white man with bags under his eyes and stubble. He missed his morning shave when he got the call to arrive at the scene. He was a man who spent many sleepless nights on this case. Just a week ago, they found five dead bodies in the woods. They were different though as they were mutilated beyond repair.

Jack lifted up the pictures of the five victims that were taken at the last crime scene. He studied them carefully as he glanced back and forth from the pictures to the fresh crime scene. The gruesome display that made him come to many conclusions. The pictures displayed five torsos, just five torsos, arms and legs ripped off. No head, and a tattoo of a large detailed eye with orbs surrounding.

At least their fates were a bit simpler, he pondered, the last batch were ripped apart. I guess the killer got soft.

“Five,” he muttered under his breath as he counted in a southern drawl, “five dead bodies. Why haven’t you been discovered earlier. I had to wake up at 5 in the morning for this shit.”

“Sorry, I’m late, I had to help my baby girl get ready for school.”

Jack turned to see his partner, Denzel, a young black man nervously scratching his head in a suit. He was a rookie detective that was assigned by the police department to Jack. The young man stood by Jack as he stared upon the carnage before him. Denzel was cleanly shaven, but the job was quickly bothering him as his eyes were weighed down. The bags underneath signaled many sleepless nights. Insomnia is something the two men can share.

“I don’t really care if you come or not,” Jack replied with an annoyed expression.

“Well, it won’t happen again, sir,” Denzel responded.

A police officer went over to Denzel and Jack with a worried look. He was a chubby man of short stature and a classic police moustache. He stared intently at the detectives to get their attention.

“One body was found washed ashore, we sent in dive teams and found the rest, they have been dead for several days,” he explained.

“How’d they die?” Denzel asked.

“We think their throats were slit, thrown in the water with rope attached to a rock tied around their feet. One came loose. The one that washed ashore, but we can't be too sure till the forensic pathologists get a hold of them,"" explained the officer.

“It's obvious, their throats were slit,” Jack grunted, “look at their necks.”

Jack squatted to take a good look at the corpses and he saw something that peaked his interest. A marking, a strange marking that stuck out of the man’s chest through his unbuttoned shirt. Jack proceeded to rip the shirt open to reveal a tattoo. A tattoo of a huge eye surrounded by orbs. They stared upon it in awe-struck and felt shivers tingle down their spines. The team quickly tore the clothing off the corpses to reveal the strange markings and tattoos on their chest.

“Oh, sweet Jesus, deliver us from this evil,” Denzel whispered with his eyes closed and his head down, “have mercy on the souls of these victims. Amen.”

“That ain’t gonna do nothing here,” Jack spitted out.

“You know, I pray for you, Jack,” Denzel said.

Jack grunted as he walked away from the crime scene. Denzel stood there writing his notes within his journal. Soon, the two men went back to the police station to continue their investigation. Jack thought about the tattoos and the markings as he drove to the station. Denzel was close behind, their drive was mostly silent as they pulled up to the station. Jack got out of his car and slowly closed the door.

He pulled a cigarette and lit it to get a quick smoke session in before all the paperwork. Denzel got out of his car and walked over to the smoking Jack. The smoke hovering over them in the damp and cold Nashville air.

“Smoking ain’t good for you,” Denzel chastised Jack, “my grandmama died from lung cancer you know.”

“Please, I’m not in the mood,” Jack growled, looking away from his partner.

“Well, I like to look out for my friends, ya know.”

“Who said we were friends?”

“Anyways,” Denzel said with a sigh while shaking his head, “what do you think those tattoos are from?”

“Don’t know,” replied Jack with a ring of smoke emitting from his mouth.

“This was 3rd time this month, another 5 bodies, it makes me sick,” Denzel muttered angrily, “the sick fuck that’s doing this, I noticed something peculiar about this.”

“What?”

“I don’t wanna get racial, but they are always minorities, the victims have only been black, hispanic, and asian,” Denzel answered, “never white people.”

“You think it’s racially motivated?” Jack turned to Denzel as he peaked his interest, “some white nationalist group? Neo nazi?”

“Maybe, my intuition is pointing me in that direction,” Denzel replied, “what’s your judgement?”

Jack continued to smoke the cigarette until it was a small insignificant stub. Denzel stood there with non-blinking wide eyes at his partner for a response. Jack eventually tossed what’s left of the cigarette onto the ground before mushing it with his foot. He proceeded to walk into the station.

“It’s as cold as a snow man's crotch out here,” Jack muttered, “I’m going inside before my balls become snowballs.”

Denzel followed close behind with an annoyed expression on his face. Both men barged into the police station.

“Hey, don’t leave me hanging like that,” Denzel pouted, “I wanna know what you think.”

“You are being annoying.”

“I’m your partner whether you like it or you don’t. I’m trying to get along with you. I know it’s only been a month.”

Jack looked down with a snarl planted on his face. He looked up at his partner's face with annoyance. His wife always told him to be a little nicer to his newly arrived partner. After all, their two daughters were friends in middle school, so they often hung out after work.

“Don’t take it personal, Denzel, didn’t get much sleep, that’s all,” Jack said.

“So, that’s why you're grumpy?” Denzel jokes, “how about this. You tell me your theory and the next coffee run is on me.”

Jack smirked at his amusing partner, but that smirk quickly turned to a scowl. He thought about the marking and his mind rushed to aliens, weirdly enough. The orbs that resemble planets surrounding an eye. Maybe, it was the illuminati, after all they are distinguished by a singular eye. That can't be right because the eye has always been red.

“My theory,” Jack slowly muttered in his deep southern accent, “I think your theory has merit, but the tattoos, they look cultish to me.”

“A cult?” Denzel spurted with a puzzled look.

“Yeah, a cult.”

“Detective Thorn! Detective Jordan! A suspect turned himself in. He confessed to the murders at the lake. Follow me.”

The two whipped their heads quickly in the direction of an incoming female police officer. Their eyes wide with bewilderment and shock as they followed the officer. Everyone rushed in the direction of the interrogation room. They crowded around the window to get a good look at the suspect.

There he sat, a young white man that looked to be in his early 20s. He was bald, shirtless, and only wore sweatpants. His face was as smooth as a baby's bottom and his eyes were agape with bags that hung lifelessly underneath. He sat there with a big smile that stretched from ear to ear. His eyebrows were shaved off and his darkened pupils were dilated.

“What's his name?” Jack questioned the officer.

“John Doe.”

“You've got to be kidding?” Jack replied.

“I'm not, we can't find anything on him in our database.”

“I told you, neo-nazi skinhead freaks,” Denzel whispered into Jack’s ears.

“Bad cop, good cop routine?” Jack asked.

“You betcha”

They both opened the door to visit the young man as he stared emotionlessly at them. His grin never left his face as they entered the room. A tattoo was revealed upon the young man’s chest with a large detailed red eye that gazed upon the two.

“Detective Jack Thorn! I’m so happy to see you,” the young man gleefully shrieked while fighting against his cuffs attached to the table.

The young man bounced joyfully as he gazed at Jack with his large round eyes. His smile revealed perfectly aligned white teeth. He switched his gaze frantically between the two men.

“And you are not happy to see me?” Denzel responded.

“Our Master is aware of you, but he sees you only as food. As a sacrifice, but Jack. He’s special,” the young man answered.

“This motherfucker, the shit you have done,” Denzel said with a nasty glare.

“Why are you interested in me?” Jack asked

“Oh my!” the young man exclaimed, “you have been chosen by our Master! Our preacher is much too old.”

“They said you confessed to murdering all those people,” Jack said, “Is this true?”

“Yes! Yes! Yes!” the young man sang.

“Why the fuck would you do that?” Denzel hissed, “who sent you? Neo-nazi’s? KKK? Or do you enjoy it?”

“No! No! No!” the young man screamed furiously while slamming his fists, “No! No! No! No!”

“Calm down. We just want information,” Jack said, “who sent you?”

“That is beneath us. We are doing this to benefit our Master! He has done nothing, but help us and create a paradise for us. He demands souls to satiate his hunger. Specific souls,” he explained, “that is better than living the life they lived.”

Denzel balled his fists as he glared upon the young bald man. He wanted to show him no mercy for his cruel acts. Jack looked at his partner and noticed the veins that popped forth from his face. The young man grinned wildly at the two and started to chuckle at Denzel’s anger.

“You think that’s funny?”

“Hey, I need to speak with you outside for a moment,” Jack whispered to Denzel.

“You gotta chill out,” Jack spurted, “you can't be aggressive with the suspect like that.”

“Did I do that?”

“Well, a little, we gotta get him to relax, get him to spill the beans,” Jack explained, “you look like you wanna rip the guy's head off.”

“And you don't?” Denzel asked, “this weirdo got it coming. Anyways, you were right.”

“About what?”

“It's some freaky ass cult. Worse than I imagined.”

“Yeah,” Jack responded while nodding his head slowly.

Denzel's eyes were fixated on the young man, but he reluctantly nodded his head and stepped out of the room. Jack stood there with no expression at all and Denzel had a furious snarl. Though, they both tried to act as though the young man did nothing to disturb them. They knew that the feeling they had deep down in their bones was ice.

1mnb3tg,https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/1mnb3tg/inggit_sa_choir_ng_catholic_update/,Inggit sa Choir ng Catholic (update),"Niyaya ako uli ng friend ko magsimba, nung una tumanggi ako kasi may gagawin pa ko pero apparently: 1 kung anong oras ako available, may available na misa (every hour daw ang misa sa cathedral) 2 walang issue ng tala or rehistro at loyalty kumbaga at kahit every sunday magpalipat lipat ng parish ay okay na okay lang

ako pumili ng oras na convenient for me. sa Cathedral kami this time, high ceiling very colorful at intricate yung design sa loob at aesthetic na parang museum. maraming tao pero hindi masyadong puno. nasa balcony yung choir sa likod so di na ako makakapagfixate on them. pero okay na rin kasi this gave me a chance to observe other parts of the mass.

Observations AKA other Inggit Points

1.	⁠⁠⁠⁠sa start ng mass, a lady seated in front of us parang vinivideohan yung mass, yun pala may kavideocall sya. napansin nung isang staff sa simbahan at kinukuha yung phone nya para ipwesto katabi ng official phone for livestreaming na nakatripod. akala ko icconfiscate. nung una nahiya yung girl pero eventually she happily told yung kavideocall nya na ippwesto lang yung phone nya para mas marinig/makita nya ng maayos.  grabe the consideration for those who cannot attend the mass and still want to participate. what if may sakit nga naman, or OFW or di kaya ng schedule pero gusto makinig sa misa. may livestream at pwede irecord at vulnerable tuligsain ng critics in public? INC would never.
2.	⁠⁠⁠⁠may procession, babae yung may dala ng bible at nagbasa ng texts at nagllead ng mga tugon- lahat ng kababaihan sa angkan namin may tungkulin pero tinuring na alila ng kulto na to. to see the church listening intently to a woman speaking in front, was very empowering and refreshing for me.
3.	⁠⁠⁠⁠first song to move me- mukhang very common kasi lahat alam yung lyrics kahit di sila tumitingin sa mga lcd tv. “Aleluya! Wikain mo Poon nakikinig ako. Sa inyong mga salita, aleluya!” Pacrescendo yung melody at may nagsesecond voice. beautiful song! ito ang LSS ko ngayon.
4.	⁠⁠⁠⁠gospel ay about preparation sa pagdating ng Diyos. umay na tayo dyan sa teksto na yan pero iba yung atake ng homily. hindi pananakot na malapit na ang paghukom. walang tungkol sa masiglang pagbibigay ng pera  para sulong lagi ang lokal to buy your salvation or pangongonsensya na you’re never doing enough sacrifices for the cult kahit halos sa kapilya ka na tumira. instead, the priest talked about 2 viral incidents the past week. yung dumura daw sa holy water for clout sa vlog at yung coffee shop sa iloilo na free wifi for everyone 24/7 at pinakikinabangan kahit hindi naman sila customer. ang point ay there are many different ways on how we can make an impact, we have to choose very well what we do kahit sa maliit na bagay. hindi kailangang bonggang sakripisyo. (unlike INC na buong lakas at kayamanan binigay na ang for what impact? BTW, 2 out of 2 masses i attended, never binanggit ang INC). may binanggit din about impeachment ni VP Sara na di ko masyado nasundan, parang parinig lang sa mga people in power. INC would never.
5.	⁠⁠⁠⁠may mga late pa rin dumarating pero pinapasingit sila sa upuan. may family with small kids na dumating, sa harap pa talaga pinasingit sa tabi ng mga nakabelo na nagccollect ng offering. paglingon ko sa likod puno na nga talaga yung simbahan. ganun siguro effect pag hindi mo pagsasaraduhan ng pinto yung mga gusto naman tagalong umattend ng service. every hour ang mass pero puno pa rin? INC could never.
6.	⁠⁠⁠⁠nagulat ako nung sinabi ng pari “let us pray in the way our Lord himself has taught us”. like WTF nasa bible explicitly dasalin yung Our Father pero INC never does it? mindblown.
7.	⁠⁠⁠⁠offering- yung mga nanay inaabutan ng barya mga anak nila tapos excited yung mga bata ihulog sa parang tela na bag na may stick. rinig mo kalansing ng barya, yung iba dinaanan lang at walang hinulog at oks lang. barya? optional lang ang handog? INC would never.
8.	⁠⁠⁠⁠may part ng mass na marami pinananalangin- mga opisyal ng gobyerno para gawin nang maayos trabaho nila, mga may sakit at yumao, ultimo mga preso pinagdasal. INC could never.
9.	⁠⁠⁠⁠peace be with you- nakakatouch din to. strangers offering each other signs of peace, and smiling or nodding. di magkakakilala pero matic irereciprocate at since di magkahiwalay ang upuan ng males and females, families are seated together. nagkikiss ang mga mag asawa at jowa at mga magulang sa anak at nagbbless sa mga lolo lola ang mga bata. nakakahappy ng puso.
10.	⁠⁠⁠⁠second song that touched me: “kordero ng Diyos na nag-aalis ng mga kasalanan ng sanlibutan, maawa ka sa amin.ipagkaloob mo sa amin ang kapayapaan. ” same crescendo style, no second voice but very powerful. the sanlibutans owning the word sanlibutan like it’s not derogatory?  like they know and admit they are sinners but they are still loved and will still receive peace and salvation? naluluha nalang bigla ako ewan bakit. sa guilt siguro because of years of judging them na ang dumi at lowly at kawawa sila kasi di sila maliligtas like me?
11.	⁠⁠⁠⁠next response that killed me- “Lord I am not worthy (…?) but only say the word and i shall be healed”. Unworthy pero maheheal pa rin?  Just like that? No obilgations and transactions? I was crying at this point.
12.	⁠⁠⁠⁠pila na for communion. last mass umupo lang ako while nakikinig sa “awit ng paglalahad”. i dont even remember the communion song this time pero for the first time in my life, i actually kneeled with others. i just cried and cried quietly. i dont know if it was because i felt sorry for feeling superior over the Catholics all my life or if i felt sorry for myself for not being one of them.
13.	⁠⁠⁠⁠after ng mass, pinapunta sa harap yung mga magbbirthday at annivesary for august. binasbasan sila ng holy water. parang lalong dumami yung tao sa paningin ko. yung mga suot nila, sari-sari. may very casual, may bihis na bihis. may nakashorts at sando at tsinelas and get this. may taong grasa at batang hamog. august celebrants din siguro sila, pantay pantay kahit anong estado ng buhay at pinanalangin ng pari with the community for their good health, purpose in life and impact in the world in their own tiny ways. INC could never.

Medyo napahaba na pala to masyado. Thank you for taking the time to read. May mga DM ako na masasakit na natanggap last time na nagsasabi na wag na daw ako mandamay sa pagkatisod ko. If may natisod man sa sharings ko sa buhay sa labas ng kulto, dasurb!

At twenty-six, Jennifer Weiss married Cleo Ayers, the man who had pursued her relentlessly for six years. But less than a year into their marriage, she discovered he was keeping a mistress.

Back entrance of the Bemrough Ballet Company.

Jennifer stood still, her back against the cold wall, listening to the breathy moans drifting out from the studio.

A woman's voice, low and urgent, broke through the muffled silence. ""Cleo... it feels so good... faster...""

Jennifer's nails dug deep into her palm.

Her husband, Cleo, was inside-hooking up with her student, Debbie Norris.

Just minutes earlier, she had received a text. \[Ms. Weiss, want to know who your husband's sleeping with? Come to Studio 3.\]

Even now, she didn't want to believe it.

They'd only been married a year. How could the love fade so fast?

She stepped forward and knocked on the door.

The voices stopped abruptly. She held her breath.

The door swung open almost instantly, and a wave of strong perfume rushed out.

Debbie stood there in a blush-pink tulle dress, her long, toned legs bare-no sign of the usual ballet tights.

Her cheeks were flushed, her lips slightly swollen. Her gaze was lazy, seductive. She blinked prettily and greeted her, all sweetness, ""Hi, Ms. Weiss!""

Debbie was the rising star Jennifer had discovered and nurtured over the past three years-her hand-picked protege, widely regarded as her successor. Because of her resemblance to Jennifer, people at the company often called her ""Little Jennifer.""

One hand, nails painted a vivid red, rested casually on the doorframe. Around her wrist was a blood-red diamond bracelet-impossible to miss.

Jennifer recognized it instantly.

It was the exact same bracelet Cleo had bought for her at an auction on his last business trip to Uwonard.

Down to every detail.

Warm air blew gently from the overhead heater, but Jennifer felt like she'd fallen into a frozen lake.

She steadied her voice. ""I heard you took some time off from training. Thought I'd drop by. Are you here alone?"" She stepped forward, trying to enter.

Debbie quickly blocked the doorway, a coy blush spreading across her face. ""Ms. Weiss, my boyfriend's here... we were, uh... now's not really a good time.""

Jennifer had heard about Debbie's so-called ""mystery boyfriend.""

She took another step forward. Debbie promptly shut the door in her face. ""Really, Ms. Weiss. It's just not convenient.""

Not convenient? Or was it because the man inside was Cleo?

Jennifer pulled out her phone and dialed Cleo's number, holding it close to her ear.

Inside the studio-dead silence. No ringtone. No sound at all.

Her blood turned to ice.

She limped quickly around the corridor to the front entrance of the studio-her right foot still recovering from an old injury-intent on catching them in the act.

As she moved, memories came rushing back in waves...

Everyone in Bemrough knew Cleo-the elegant, untouchable heir to the Ayers family. Polished, reserved, aloof. His private life was famously clean, even cold. He was said to be completely uninterested in women.

That was, until Swan Lake-when he first saw Jennifer dance as the White Swan.

Love at first sight.

From that moment on, he pursued her with unwavering passion for six full years. Every day, a bouquet of fresh white roses delivered right to her door. He never missed a single performance, always sending flowers in person.

Jennifer had grown up watching her father cheat, her mother spiral into madness and stab the mistress. Her family had crumbled. She'd long since stopped believing in love, let alone marriage. Add to that the vast gap between their backgrounds-she rejected him again and again.

But Cleo never gave up. Persistent. Devoted. Steadfast.

Until the car crash.

To protect her, he'd thrown himself over the seat-unbuckling his belt in the process-taking the full impact. Multiple broken ribs. A punctured lung. Days in a coma in the ICU.

Chapter 2

That was the moment her heart finally cracked open.

Now, standing at the end of the hallway, Jennifer stared at the front entrance of the studio-waiting. Watching. But no one came out.

""Babe.""

A deep, familiar voice spoke from behind her. Jennifer spun around.

Cleo was walking toward her.

Impeccably dressed-perfectly tailored suit, white shirt buttoned up to the collar, tie knotted precisely. A black coat hung casually over his shoulder. Not a hair out of place. Not a hint of guilt.

He stopped just in front of her, the cool scent of mint brushing past her nose.

Mouthwash.

He'd quit smoking three months ago. And it wasn't anywhere near mealtime.

""You went by the office to find me just now?"" he asked calmly.

Jennifer's gaze locked onto his face, sharp and unblinking.

There wasn't the slightest flicker of emotion on Cleo's sharp, elegant face. He spoke in a warm, even voice, ""Yes. What about you? What are you doing here?""

""Checking on student training,"" Jennifer replied smoothly, her tone neutral.

Cleo nodded, then naturally slipped his arm around her and walked her out of the ballet company. The two of them got into a Rolls-Royce Phantom parked under the shade of the plane trees.

As soon as they were seated, he handed her a warm cup of coffee with sugar.

He had a private app on his phone that tracked her entire cycle. Her period was due in just a couple of days.

Looking at him-still so thoughtful and considerate-Jennifer felt a moment of confusion, a crack in her certainty.

She forced a small smile and asked casually, ""Mr. Ayers, where's that bracelet you bought for me at the auction?""

But her fingers clenched tightly around the cold metal of the thermos cup.

Cleo smiled faintly. He reached into his coat pocket and took out a navy velvet jewelry box. He flipped it open.

Inside lay a blood-red diamond bracelet, gleaming with a subtle, dazzling glow.

Jennifer froze.

'So... the man in the studio wasn't him?'

Cleo gently took her hand and slid the bracelet onto her wrist.

His warm fingertips brushed over her skin as he fastened the clasp. He studied her wrist admiringly, eyes lighting up with appreciation. ""Only a top-grade gem like this,"" he said, ""is worthy of my wife's beauty.""

The fine, old-mine ruby shimmered like fire against her pale skin, making it look even more translucent and flawless.

Jennifer snapped back to reality and said calmly, ""It is beautiful. Funny coincidence though-my student, Debbie, has one that looks exactly the same.""

Cleo raised an eyebrow, lips lifting into a confident curve. ""You must be mistaken. It was a one-of-a-kind auction piece. There can't be a second.""

His expression didn't waver.

A faint glimmer of hope flickered in Jennifer's chest.

'Could I really be wrong?

'Then what about the message? Has it all just been a sick joke?'

The Phantom pulled into a luxury gated community and stopped in front of a private villa.

Cleo carefully helped her out of the car. Three months earlier, while searching for him after an accident in the mountains, she had slipped down a wet slope and badly injured her ankle. The damage left her with a permanent limp.

As they stepped inside, the housekeeper, Kenya Fowler, came forward to greet them. ""Ma'am, you had a package delivered today. I signed for it.""

Cleo handed his coat to Kenya, then casually loosened his tie. His eyes swept over to Jennifer, warm and amused. ""My wife's shopping online? What'd you get this time?""

Jennifer hesitated for a second before replying smoothly, ""It's from Flossie-her latest book, signed edition."" Flossie Kelly was her close friend, a well-known self-help blogger with millions of followers.

Cleo nodded. ""I'm going to shower. Long day. I feel a bit grimy.""

Jennifer picked up the package and headed back to her room.

Chapter 3

Since they got married, they had always slept in separate bedrooms.

She opened the box-and her breath caught.

Inside was a black lace nightdress. Sexy, bold, and completely unlike her usual style.

Just then, her phone buzzed.

A new anonymous message popped up on the screen.

\[Ms. Weiss, I heard you're sick-won't even sleep with your husband. Do you even love him?\]

""Sick."" That word stabbed her right in the chest.

Because it wasn't a lie.

Nearly a year into their marriage, Jennifer and Cleo still hadn't been intimate. Even basic physical contact could send her into cold sweats-nausea, trembling, and an overwhelming sense of panic.

Just last Friday, Flossie had run another psychological assessment. The results had improved slightly. She'd encouraged Jennifer to try initiating intimacy, even just a small step.

This black nightdress-Jennifer had ordered it two days ago.

It was meant to be a surprise for Cleo when he came back from his trip.

\*\*\*\*\*

Cleo emerged from the shower and stepped into her room.

Jennifer stood by the wardrobe.

A slim white turtleneck sweater hugged her frame, outlining her graceful shoulders. Her hair was swept up in a neat bun, exposing the smooth line of her neck and a cool, refined face-so pure it seemed untouched by the world.

Cleo's Adam's apple shifted slightly.

Then he walked in.

Jennifer turned at the sound of the door.

Cleo was wearing a dark blue robe, his tall frame moving toward her with measured ease.

The V-shaped collar lay open, revealing the sharp lines of his chest-and faint scars that still traced across his skin. A reminder of the accident.

He stopped in front of her, towering above.

His hand came up and gently cupped her face. In his deep, dark eyes, desire surged-undeniable and unhidden.

His handsome face lowered toward hers, breath brushing against her skin.

The naked desire in Cleo's dark eyes hit Jennifer like a punch to the gut-and in an instant, the shadows of her childhood came crashing back.

""No-don't!""

She shoved hard against his chest. Her entire body trembled violently, out of her control, her face pale as a sheet.

Cleo stiffened. A flash of frustration and helplessness crossed his eyes before he quickly regained his composure.

He stepped back, letting go of her, his voice low and soft, gentle as a whisper. ""I'm sorry. I shouldn't have pushed you.""

Jennifer forced herself to breathe, to stay composed. Seeing the raw guilt in his eyes made her throat tighten. Her nose stung, and her eyes began to burn.

When he leaned in to kiss her, all she could see was the sickening image from her childhood-her father, naked and entangled with his mistress. That memory had branded itself into her mind and refused to let go.

""Please... don't force me,"" she said, her voice still shaking.

It was painfully clear-six months of therapy hadn't done much.

Cleo gave her a patient, indulgent smile. His gaze was full of warmth. He gently brushed a stray lock of hair from her cheek. ""Okay,"" he said softly. ""We'll wait until you're ready, sweetheart.""

He gave her cheek a light squeeze, his tone firm but reassuring. ""No guilt. I'm happy to wait.""

His gentleness made something inside her melt. She felt a wave of warmth rise in her chest. Moved, she stepped forward and opened her arms to hug him.

But just then, her phone rang-shrill and sudden.

Cleo quickly pulled out his own phone from the pocket of his robe. As the screen lit up, he instinctively turned it away, shielding it slightly with his hand.

Jennifer caught a glimpse.

The screen was completely dark-he had a privacy filter.

She paused, slightly thrown.

Cleo looked up, his voice light and casual. ""Babe, I just need to take this call."" Then he added naturally, ""It's Geraldo.""

Geraldo Lewis. The name brushed past Jennifer's thoughts like a breeze.

Chapter 4

Cleo stepped out, leaving her alone in the room.

She picked up her own phone, opened her contacts, and scrolled until she found a name she hadn't seen-or thought about-in year.

Geraldo.

He was her college classmate, and the nephew of her mentor, Melody Glenn. He came from a long line of legal elites-three generations of towering figures in both the judiciary and academia.

Unlike the rest of the Glenn family, Geraldo hadn't gone into politics. Instead, he'd become one of the top lawyers in the commercial world, specializing in complex corporate litigation and international arbitration.

Even Cleo's grandfather Wilford Ayers had to ask three times before Geraldo finally agreed to take on one of the Ayers family's toughest cases.

Jennifer remembered-when he left to study abroad, he didn't even say goodbye.

They hadn't spoken in years. He probably didn't even remember her.

The number in her phone was probably long dead.

Still, she pressed ""Call""-just to see. Just to be sure Cleo really was speaking to him.

To her surprise, the call connected immediately.

Jennifer froze.

From the receiver came the smooth strains of Bach, soft and elegant.

""Jennifer?"" came a low, unhurried male voice. It was rich, slightly raspy-like velvet dragged across sandpaper, deep enough to graze the edge of her nerves.

Her fingers tightened around the phone. For a moment, she forgot to speak.

On the other end of the line, in a tastefully furnished study, redwood shelves were packed with law books. A brass scale gleamed coldly on the desk.

Geraldo leaned back in his chair, listening to the quiet sound of her breathing.

With one hand, he undid the top button of his shirt. His Adam's apple moved slightly as he spoke again, voice unhurried but sharp, ""Cat got your tongue?""

Jennifer finally came back to her senses.

She hadn't expected the call to go through. And she definitely hadn't expected the voice on the other end to be his.

But something in her shifted.

She turned and walked out of the bedroom, making her way quietly to Cleo's room.

From inside, she heard it-low, muffled groans. A man's voice. Heavy breathing.

She froze, her body going rigid.

And just like that, she couldn't move.

Jennifer's fingers clutched the phone so tightly her knuckles turned white, as if they might burst through her skin.

On the other end of the line, Geraldo straightened. ""Jennifer? What's going on?""

Only then did she snap out of it. ""Sorry... wrong number,"" she said quietly.

She hung up before he could say another word. Her gaze drifted to the tightly shut door ahead.

And slowly, her heart began to sink.

Cleo had spent six years patiently warming her heart.

And now, just when she had finally begun to love him back... he'd already moved on?

With someone new?

With her student?

Right then, the door opened. Cleo stepped out.

He froze when he saw her standing there.

Jennifer's gaze swept over his chest and neck-still flushed with a telltale red. ""What were you doing in there?"" she asked evenly.

His eyes darkened. His Adam's apple bobbed once. ""What did you hear?"" he asked.

Their eyes locked. The air felt still and heavy.

Jennifer didn't answer. She just stood there, silently staring at him.

Cleo placed both hands gently on her shoulders, a helpless smile tugging at the corner of his lips. ""Babe, you got me all worked up earlier. I was just... cooling off by myself.""

'Is it really me who's worked him up? Or is it Debbie?'

Jennifer didn't believe a word.

""I'm hungry,"" she said flatly. ""Let's eat.""

She turned and walked away without waiting for a response.

Cleo didn't think much of it. He knew she'd always been uncomfortable with intimacy, so he let her go downstairs first while he changed into something more casual.

But half an hour passed, and he still hadn't come down.

Chapter 5

Downstairs, Jennifer absentmindedly poured herself a glass of coffee, lost in thought.

Suddenly, pain shot through the back of her hand.

Kenya's panicked voice rang out, ""Ma'am!""

Jennifer blinked, realizing too late that the cup was already full. Scalding coffee had spilled over, burning her skin.

She rushed to the kitchen and ran her hand under cold water, letting it soak.

Upstairs, Cleo heard the commotion and hurried down. ""What happened?""

Kenya was pale with fright. She lowered her head, voice trembling. ""M-Mrs. Ayers burned her hand while pouring water... It was an accident.""

Normally, Cleo was calm and gracious-even with the staff. But when it came to Jennifer's well-being, he became instantly sharp, like someone had struck a nerve.

His face turned grim. His tone went cold. ""You're fired.""

Kenya froze in panic.

Just then, Jennifer stepped out of the kitchen, calm and composed as always. ""It was my fault. I wasn't paying attention. Don't blame Kenya.

""I'm fine.""

Cleo stepped forward, took her wrist, and carefully examined the burn. His brows knit in concern, his voice low and tinged with reproach. ""It's all red. How is that fine?""

Jennifer gently pulled her hand away. ""I ran it under cold water. It doesn't hurt anymore.""

That was just like her-never dramatic, never the type to whine. Always composed. Always self-reliant.

But Cleo could tell-something was off.

Her mood had clearly shifted. And Jennifer, who had basically raised herself since her family fell apart, had always been capable. Careful. How could she burn herself so carelessly?

As he carefully applied ointment to her hand, he asked softly, ""Did I do something wrong?""

Jennifer frowned. 'So he is feeling guilty.'

""I was listening to an audio drama,"" she said casually. ""Got too caught up in it while pouring coffee.""

Cleo raised an eyebrow, skeptical. ""You? Listening to an audio drama? That doesn't sound like the refined, elegant Ms. Weiss I know.""

He smirked slightly. ""What was the story about?""

Jennifer met his eyes. ""It was about a man who finally marries the woman he chased for years... only to turn around and cheat on her-with her student.""

As soon as the words left her mouth, she saw his hand tense around the ointment tube. A thick squirt of brown gel oozed out onto his fingers.

He grabbed a few tissues and wiped it off in a hurry.

His flustered reaction didn't escape her notice.

Her chest tightened.

She looked at him and said coolly, ""Why so nervous, Mr. Ayers?""

Cleo paused, then gave a slight smirk and shot back, ""Nervous? About what?

""Maybe just shocked by how dramatic that plot was. Writers these days are really something.""

But Jennifer didn't believe him. He was clearly rattled.

Still, without proof, she wasn't about to accuse him and potentially damage what they had.

So, she kept up the act. ""Art imitates life, right? And real life's often more dramatic than fiction.""

""The male lead's a real piece of work,"" she added.

Cleo continued gently applying the ointment, but his expression had turned visibly darker. ""Yeah. Pathetic, really. A man who can't control himself? He's no better than an animal.""

His tone was cold and laced with contempt.

Jennifer said nothing.

She knew where that disdain came from.

Cleo's father had families scattered across the globe. He'd died in a plane crash-with one of his mistresses. Cleo had never fully recovered from that and had always harbored a deep hatred for infidelity.

""To hurt your first love like that... unforgivable, right, babe?""

His voice cut through the silence again, soft and affectionate.

Jennifer looked up and met his eyes. They were filled with warmth, shimmering under the soft light like they held nothing but love for her.

For a moment, she couldn't tell if it was real... or an act.

But she wasn't the type to overlook even the smallest lie.

Chapter 6

If there was no affair... why the deception?

That night, long after the house had gone quiet, she received a message from the hacker she'd hired. The anonymous text had come from a foreign virtual server-completely untraceable. No IP address, no location, no lead.

The next morning-Saturday, like always-she and Cleo headed to the Ayers family estate to visit his mother Ava Ayers.

Just past ten, their Rolls-Royce Phantom pulled into the elegant courtyard of a modern villa.

Ava stepped out with a housekeeper to greet them warmly.

Over her deep green traditional clothes, she wore a charcoal wool coat, and her jewelry-matching pieces of fine jewel-was as tasteful as it was extravagant. Her full, well-maintained face radiated the practiced grace of old money.

As soon as Jennifer stepped out of the car, Ava came forward and took her hand with concern. ""Jennifer, are you cold?""

1mnb2kl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaffeineFreeLife/comments/1mnb2kl/i_did_not_drink_coffee_and_i_felt_horrible/,I did not drink coffee and I felt HORRIBLE!,"So I am an admitted Coffeeholic. I could easily drink about 8 cups of coffee a day. Plus I add coffee mate French vanilla and hazelnut creamer to my coffee.
I’ve been like this for years. And after getting over a crystal meth addiction and a cocaine addiction; I figured coffee couldn’t be that bad. It’s legal for God’s sake!

Well, I’ve recently visited London England and they don’t serve coffee the way I’m used to drinking it in the US so towards the end of my trip I just stopped drinking coffee altogether. First of all it wasn’t coffee I was being given. It was espresso and their flavored creamers sucked in my opinion so I just decided I’d have water instead.

Man-o-man! Over the past 24 hours I’ve had 1/2 a cup of espresso and nothing else caffeinated.
Because I drink so much coffee I gave up drinking heavy sodas, a long time ago. And at this point, I can barely finish half a can of Pepsi.

I had a little headache last night when I went to bed and I figured I was just tired. I woke up this morning with my head pounding, my vision was off. And there were moments when I felt like I was going to throw up. I could not figure out what is wrong. The only thing that was different was that I had not had any caffeine. About three hours into this head pain; and after taking 1 Tylenol, which always works for me and my concussion meds, because I recently had a head trauma. My head hurts so bad I fell asleep in the taxi on the way to Heathrow airport. The taxi driver literally had to shake me to wake me up.
WTF!

The only change i could think of was the lack of caffeine and sugar in my system. So I got a latte at the airport with heavy vanilla syrup added. I could feel my headache dissipating with the very first sip of my latte. My head still hurts but my vision is less blurry and my headache has gone down quite significantly.

There’s something deeply personal about the digital spaces we inhabit, especially when they reflect our passions and quirks in every pixel and animation. Today, I want to invite you inside my Lichess homepage — a fully customized sanctuary where the cold logic of chess melds seamlessly with warm, whimsical vibes.

This isn’t just a dashboard; it’s my cozy corner of the internet, built pixel by pixel to inspire, entertain, and keep me connected to the game I love.

# First thing you see: the ethereal northern lights dancing behind the UI

As soon as I load the page, I’m greeted by an animated northern lights aura gently undulating behind everything — subtle yet mesmerizing. It’s like having a glimpse of the arctic sky’s magical glow, grounding me with calm focus before a game. The shifting hues of green and purple create a living background, making the chessboard feel like the center of a vast, enchanted universe.

# Twin Peaks font — because style matters

Everywhere my username appears — from the homepage to the deepest corners of the site — it’s rendered in the iconic Twin Peaks font. The retro, eerie vibe of that font adds an unexpected cinematic flair to my identity, like I’m starring in my own chess mystery saga. It’s a small detail, but it’s like a secret handshake with those who notice, a signature that feels uniquely mine.

# The hearth of my homepage: a glowing fireplace with floating embers

No matter how tense the game, the warm glow of my animated fireplace offers a reassuring presence. Flickering flames crackle softly as tiny embers drift upwards — a dynamic, living element that brings the digital space to life. It’s the perfect reminder to stay calm and steady, like chess strategy unfolding in a quiet room with a fire burning nearby.

# My companions: a peacefully sleeping kitten and festive charm

Resting just beside the warmth of the fire is a static sleeping kitten, curled up on a soft pillow. There’s something deeply soothing about that image — a symbol of rest, patience, and quiet observation, virtues every chess player learns to cherish.

Nearby, three Christmas stockings hang quietly — nostalgic, static reminders of joy, tradition, and a little holiday magic that lingers all year round. Alongside these, you’ll find a cherry pie, a lit cigarette with an ashtray, and a steaming cup of coffee — all static but evocative, each telling its own story of comfort, indulgence, and ritual.

# Tools that keep my game sharp and my progress tracked

My homepage isn’t just about ambiance — it’s a powerful hub for my chess journey.

* The **KOTH Climber script shortcut** sits ready, a clickable gateway to tweak and visualize exactly where I stand on the King of the Hill rating slider. It’s an intuitive way to measure progress and plan the next move in my competitive climb.
* The **Titled Players Radar Tracker** is another essential. One click opens a sleek display to log new games, keeping tabs on my battles with chess elites and sharpening my strategy against top-tier opponents.
* And because every great moment deserves to be saved, my **GIF folder** neatly stores a collection of favorite game highlights — frozen snapshots of brilliance, blunders, and unforgettable plays I can revisit anytime.

# And finally, the wild heart of the page: animated wolves pacing along the bottom

Anchoring the whole scene are subtle but powerful animated wolves gliding gracefully along the bottom edge of the page. Their sleek, fluid movements add a primal energy — a reminder that beneath all the calm and ritual, there’s fierce strategy, instinct, and relentless drive. They are the silent guardians of this chess sanctuary, watching over every move with watchful eyes.

In sum, this homepage is more than just a UI for me. It’s a warm hearth of memories, a battleground of strategy, and a gallery of personal expression — where the magic of chess converges with the comfort of home.

The PJ Wood TB01-0101-008-5P-A04 caught my eye primarily for its elegant simplicity, both in terms of design and usefulness. The bold espresso finish immediately gives it a modern, classy flair—exactly the kind of furniture piece that blends seamlessly into any room. Each tray in the set has a rectangular shape and sturdy wood construction that feels solid every time I use it. Setting it up is a breeze; it’s essentially grab-and-go. With dimensions of 14.5""D x 19""W x 26""H, I found the size adequate for most casual activities like dining, reading, or even typing on my laptop.  

I’ve been using the set for movie nights and quick breakfasts, and each tray is wide enough to hold my plate, cutlery, and a drink without feeling cramped. My coworkers have noticed the compact storage rack where all four tables fit snugly when folded, making it ideal for small apartments or spaces that double as a living area and work-from-home setup.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Stylish espresso finish matches modern interiors.  
- Easy setup—simply unfold and use.  
- Space-saving design with a neat storage rack.

**Practicality of Folding Tables**  

After weeks of daily use, the biggest highlight for me has been the seamless folding mechanism. Whether I’m using it in bed for a snack or pulling it up to my sofa for some work, these tables unfold and refold effortlessly. My roommate likes to use them during gaming nights as individual snack stations, which is just another example of how versatile they are.  

The folding tables are perfect for indoor usage, built with a straight leg design that contributes to their stability. While adjusting to their height of 26 inches took me a moment, it turned out to be an excellent fit for most furniture in my home. Each table’s surface area comfortably accommodates laptops, books, or meals without wobbling—a recurring issue I’ve faced with cheaper alternatives.  

**Durability That Matters**  

The solid wood construction was noticeable from the first touch. These trays aren’t flimsy; they’re robust enough to hold heavier dishes or gadgets. Over time, I’ve managed to spill coffee (more than once), and while they’re not stain-resistant, the cleanup with a damp cloth was pretty straightforward. The craftsmanship reflects durability, which reassures me that it can withstand regular wear and tear.  

Despite the solid wood frame, the tables are lightweight enough to move around easily. At just over 35 pounds for the whole set, it’s surprisingly manageable for anyone to carry the rack from room to room. That convenience makes it perfect not just for adults but even for kids who want to set up their own snack corner while watching cartoons.  

**Good Points**  
- Solid and durable wooden frame supports heavier items.  
- Lightweight construction ensures easy portability.  
- Handles spills well with minimal maintenance effort.  

**Some Limiting Factors**  

One thing I did stumble upon was how specific the height and width dimensions are. While it works beautifully with standard seating, taller chairs or unconventional sofas may highlight the limitations of the table’s height. I tried using one for my office desk chair, only to find the angle a little awkward.  

Additionally, the espresso finish, as stunning as it looks, does occasionally show smudges and fingerprints. Regular cleaning is necessary if you want to keep that polished look. And, though the folding tables are practical, they’re not customizable in any way. This didn’t bother me, but I imagine folks looking for versatile furniture might find this a drawback.  

**Flaws**  
- Fixed height may not suit all furniture combinations.  
- The finish is prone to visible smudges.  
- Lack of customization options.  

**Comparing Product Rivals**  

In the world of folding tray tables, competition is everywhere. One notable competitor I came across was the Lifetime tray table. While it’s undeniably more affordable and lightweight, it sacrifices the premium quality found in the PJ Wood set. The Lifetime version felt more plastic-like and less robust, which could be fine for occasional use but not for daily activities.  

Another close competitor is Winsome’s Alex Snack Tables. Those come with a similar compact rack for storage yet lack the rich, elegant finish PJ Wood offers. What ultimately sets the PJ Wood trays apart for me is their solid wood base. Many other brands use composites or engineered wood that doesn’t deliver the same sophisticated look.  

**Cost Efficiency**  

Considering its stylish design, robust build, and long-lasting material, I found the investment in the PJ Wood TB01-0101-008-5P-A04 justified. While it’s slightly on the pricier side compared to plastic or composite options, the quality is evident. The ability to serve multiple purposes—be it as snack trays, makeshift desks, or compact dining surfaces—gives this set an added edge in terms of value.  

If you need something affordable yet classy, these folding snack tables can easily fulfill the role of dependable home furniture.

1mnarhk,https://i.redd.it/uw8egsgpodif1.png,"Even before I am fully awake, I know that this is going to be a day from hell and I have had enough of those in my life.","If just one more thing in my life goes wrong, I am out of here and I will never set foot in this territory again.

“Did the bond form?” I ask Charna, my Lycan. If it did, it would make my day better, or at least I hope so.

“It did form.” She replies, but her tone tells me something is wrong.

I turned eighteen a week ago and found a connection with the future Alpha, Nico, one of the people on my list for hurting me over and over again.

No, he never hit me and neither did anyone else.

Okay, maybe I need to explain something for you to understand what I am talking about.

On my sixth birthday I had been at the lake with my Father, who is our Pack’s Beta, and the Alpha and Gamma family. I had gotten bored with the games they were playing, and I had wandered off into the forest; most of our territory is forest.

I knew to keep an eye out for the markings that tell us where our borders are and I had been picking wild flowers as I walked around. A soft whimper had gotten my attention and being the curious little Beta, I had gone looking for the source.

If only I had known that I would come to hate my sixth birthday one day, I might have walked in the opposite direction.

I had found a girl in the forest. Later, it turned out that she was just a little older than me, and I had taken her to our Alpha.

Her name was Lucy, but she couldn’t tell us how she had gotten here or where she had come from. She did know that her birthday had just been a few days ago or would be in a few days, and that had been the first time that she had gotten something that was mine.

“You have so many dolls, why don’t you give one to Lucy?” my Father had asked and as I had thought about which doll to gift her, I had nodded my head.

My Father had grabbed my favorite doll from the picnic blanket and as I had objected to it, my Father had already given it to Lucy.

I had tried to explain to my Father that I didn’t want to part with that specific doll, but he had just said that I was being selfish, and he had placed Lucy next to him on the blanket.

Lucy had lived on the first floor with the Omegas for about a week, when my Father had moved Lucy to our floor. He had said that Lucy didn’t like living with the Omegas, and she had asked my Father if she could come live with us.

I doubt nowadays that she used the word “us” back then, but I wasn’t there when she had asked and therefore I can’t be sure.

Every birthday I had was overshadowed by Lucy, my Father always telling me that she didn’t have parents to throw her a party and I could just share my party with Lucy.

This happened again and again, not only due to my Father but also due to the Alpha and Gamma families. Nico was the worst, and he would always remind me that Lucy was much prettier than me, at least in his eyes.

So, now you might understand why Nico is on my shit list.

I train every single day because I have to because I am the future Beta. Well, I was the future Beta, and now I am going to be the future Luna.

Nico had been as surprised as I was, but he wanted to form a bond with me. After all, the Goddess had made the connection, and we needed to respect her decision.

Lucy hadn’t been too happy with it; she had been trying to get Nico’s attention for almost a year now and had failed miserably. She even went out of her way to make sure I knew that she would never accept me as a Luna and I had just laughed in her face.

Being Nico’s Mate will make me the Luna, and Lucy cannot do anything about it, even though she might try.

I have gone through my morning routine and am rinsing the dishes I used for breakfast. I hardly ever eat breakfast in the main dining room, because I usually train during that time.

I see that the door to the master bedroom is wide open, which means that my Father is already downstairs, probably having an early morning meeting with the rest of our leadership.

“Why are you so quiet?” I ask Charna, this should be a joyous day for both of us.

She doesn’t answer me, but the moment I leave the Beta floor, she starts pacing in my head and forces me to head up to the Alpha floor. I enter the floor using the code I was given after I turned sixteen, and I am met with complete silence.

It seems I was right about the early morning meeting, and Nico is using it to sleep in, just like he does every time his parents are preoccupied or absent.

I hadn’t made any plans with Nico, even though we knew that today would probably be the day that our Mate-bond would be completed. Charna doesn’t understand why we didn’t make any plans, and to tell you the truth, neither do I.

My steps falter as I stand in front of Nico’s bedroom door and I am glad that our bond hadn’t formed earlier. If it had and we had accepted one another as Mates, I would be in excruciating pain right now.

Because the Asshole is fucking another female, the sounds coming from his room don’t leave any room for errors and I am not sure what to do right now.

“Is this why he didn’t want to tell anyone just yet?” Charna asks me and I think we both know that that is exactly the reason.

“Ohh, Lucy. That feels so good.” I hear Nico groan, but it is the name he called that has made me furious and I can barely manage to keep myself from bursting in. I need to find a way to expose those two, and slowly, I make my way out of the Alpha floor and back to my own room without shedding a tear.

I am going to make them pay for what they did and everyone will know about our connection, but it ends today.

# New Life

I walk into my bedroom and grab my suitcases from the back of my closet; I place them on my bed to start packing the remainder of my belongings. There are only a few sets of clothes left in my closet and only the daily necessities in the bathroom.

Most of the things I want to take with me are already in my suitcases. I made the decision to leave Shadow Valley Pack at my Sweet Sixteen party, and I already know where I am going.

I will be going to the Elders to learn everything I need to learn to become the best Beta I can be, and I will find a Pack that will appreciate me for who I am.

My weapons are in the trunk of my car; I take them out every time I need them and place them back after I have cleaned them. All that is left is my luggage, and then I will make sure that everyone understands who is responsible for me leaving.

Okay, let’s get introductions out of the way. My name is Dallas, I am eighteen years old and my Lycan, Charna, showed up a year ago. My life hasn’t been a bed of roses and the only reason I stayed this long is the hope of finding my Mate.

Well, we already know that that didn’t go as planned. I am officially done with the people in my life and the leadership of this Pack.

I walk back up to the Alpha floor, and to my surprise, Nico and Lucy are still at it, but I no longer give a damn.

“Nico, harder.” I hear Lucy moan. “Put a Pup in me, I want you to cum inside me.” I can hear Nico groan before he yells that he is coming.

I slam open the door, and Lucy drops to the floor when Nico pushes her off his cock, startled by my presence. Both make a mess of themselves and the bedroom.

I don’t wait for him to respond; I just turn on my heel and walk down the hallway to the door.

“Please, Dallas. Stop. This is not what it looks like; it just happened.” Nico says, hopping on one leg as he tries to pull on some sweatpants.

I don’t say anything; I just keep walking down the stairs, and I know that Nico and Lucy are right behind me.

Everyone in the main dining room goes quiet the moment they see me walking in, and I can hear a few whispers the moment Nico and Lucy walk in behind me; everyone can smell the scent of sex in the air.

“I, Dallas, reject you, Nico, as my Mate.” I say after I have turned around to look at him.

“I don’t care if you accept it or not. Just know that it won’t stop me from finding my own happiness and you will have to suffer the consequences of not accepting my rejection.” I state.

“Dallas, why are you rejecting our Son?” Alpha Leon asks and I turn around to look at him.

“Because, as usual, Lucy wanted what is mine and got it. Your Son fucked Lucy, even though he knew that our Mate-bond was nearly complete and now I know why he didn’t want us to tell anyone.” I say as I look into Alpha Leon’s eyes.

I turn back to Lucy and Nico, he is still staring at me and his hands are pressed against his chest. I don’t feel any pain, but that might change if he accepts my rejection.

“You wanted him; you can have him. You can have everything that was once mine. I hope that the two of you become very happy together, and I hope that you enjoy your victory.” I say to Lucy before I walk past her and out of the main dining room.

“Stop, you can’t leave. You are my Mate.” Nico says and I turn around to see him standing in the doorway.

“I am no longer your Mate. You chose to sleep with her, and now you can deal with the consequences. You have always put Lucy before me, just like your family, the Gamma family and even my own Father. You never failed to remind me that you thought that Lucy was prettier than I am.

Our Mate-bond would have made you see that you had been wrong, that you had hurt me with your words, and I would have forgiven you because of our Mate-bond. What I can’t forgive and what I will never forgive, is that you chose to fuck another woman.” I say in a calm, cold voice.

The entire dining room is quiet and everyone is waiting for what is coming next.

“Dallas, there might be a very good explanation…” But I don’t give Alpha Leon the chance to finish his sentence.

“What kind of explanation can your Son have for being buried balls deep in Lucy? Where in this damn universe could this have been an accident?” I growl in his direction.

More Pack-members have gathered in the dining room, all of them curious about the drama unfolding in front of them.

My Father finally gets up from his chair and I am damn curious about what he will have to say.

“Dallas, you are the future Beta. You already have status within Shadow Valley Pack; why not grant Lucy the status of Luna?” My Father says.

Charna is growling in my head, but she keeps to the back of my mind. Neither one of us wants him to know that we already shifted or that we know that he lied about our Mother.

“HAVE YOU LOST YOUR FUCKING MIND? YOU WANT ME TO GIVE LUCY MY MATE, JUST LIKE YOU GAVE HER THE LAST GIFT MOM GAVE ME OR THE FAMILY HEIRLOOM YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GIVE ME ON MY SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY.

GET A FUCKING GRIP ON THAT DAMN BRAIN OF YOURS, I HATE YOUR FUCKING GUTS.” I yell at my Father and I take advantage of his shocked state.

“Nico, this is your last chance to accept my rejection. Once I walk out the door, you might never get the chance again.” I state, looking at Nico and it seems to sink in that no one can change my mind.

“I, Nico, accept your rejection.” Nico says, knowing that I will never forgive him.

I walk out of the Pack-house without looking back; I get into my SUV to finally get out of this place and start my new life.

# At Fault

Dallas’ p.o.v.

Six months later

I took my time to travel to Scarlet Crescent Pack. I needed time to myself, and I wanted to take time to write down all the questions I have had for years.

I arrived at my destination after traveling for almost a week.

Charna enjoyed running around in unknown territory and neither one of us feel sorry for ourselves.

It is almost as if there never was a bond between me and Nico, no pain after he accepted our rejection and no sense of loss for us.

I arrived at Scarlet Crescent Pack in the early morning, and I am glad that I had the letter from the Elders printed; it saved a lot of trouble at the gate.

A Squad Captain was waiting for me at the main building, the building that houses the Elders and where I will get my education.

I was given a schedule for the first week and then he showed me the territory we were staying in.

We might live within Scarlet Crescent territory, but we can’t enter the territory that surrounds the Palace. At least not with permission from the Elders or at the request of the King.

I had the rest of the day off, and I used it to get settled in; my room is on the top floor of building A. It is a hell of a lot bigger than my room back home and I even have a small balcony.

I placed my laptop on the desk next to the balcony door, I unpacked my suitcases and then I went looking for some breakfast.

My first real day with the Elders consisted of tests to establish the level of my knowledge of Laws and my skill level in fighting.

I aced every test they gave me, and that left the Elders with a challenge: where do you place someone who hardly needs basic training?

After consulting with the Squad Captains, I was assigned to one of the Squads and a costume made study plan was devised.

My studies were more focused on Pack-laws and the consequences they could have for a Pack. It was something I wasn’t taught in Shadow Valley Pack; I didn’t even know that an Alpha could make his own Laws within his territory.

Those Laws can’t be breaking our main Laws; they are usually a stricter version of our main Laws, and I was going to need to learn all of them.

I found a few surprises along the way, and I actually enjoyed my studies; they were very educational.

Today, I will become a fully pledged member of Captain Jordan’s Squad, and I will be allowed to go on missions with the Squad; my main priority is to make sure we know the Pack-laws of the territories we get sent to.

“Good morning, Dallas.” Captain Jordan says as I walk into the living room of our Squad house.

The other Squad members greet me with a smile or a wave and I walk over to the coffee machine to make myself a Latte.

Captain Jordan slides a file in my direction after I have taken a seat not far from him, and I reluctantly open it. I know what is in there and hate it whenever he hands me a file like this.

Captain Jordan was the first one who found out about my past; he had found me cussing and swearing at a phone that was lying on the desk in my room.

It was on my third day as a part of his Squad and I hadn’t come down yet, so he came looking for me. I had finally turned on the old phone with my sim card in it and I had many text and voice messages from my Father.

None of them were an apology for the way he had treated me. No, each of them was telling me that I was childish, selfish, and immature.

Captain Jordan took the phone from me, and once a month, I get a file on the type of messages I have gotten with the name of whoever left them for me.

My Father still leaves messages telling me I am being childish, selfish and immature. Nico is begging me to come back, to give him another chance and so do his parents. The only one that hasn’t reached out to me is Lucy and I hope she never does.

My eyes widen when I read a different message from my Father, and I hear Charna laughing in my head; I had completely forgotten about this.

“Something funny, Dallas?” I hear Captain Jordan ask and I need a minute before I can answer him.

“Sorry, but it is the last message from my Father.” I reply and I hear a few growls around me.

“I had forgotten that I had changed the password to the program for the Pack funds. I never informed anyone about it, and it slipped my mind that it is the annual fund meeting in a few days.” I explain, but apparently, I am not making any sense.

“Every Pack makes an annual budget for a variety of Pack-related issues; I have been making them since I turned fifteen, and my Father would pass them off as his own. He never needed access to the program, so he never needed the new password and now the only ones that can get access are Alpha Leon and his Mate.” I explain.

Captain Jordan has a dumbfounded look on his face and looking around; I can see he isn’t the only one.

“Can’t your Father ask Alpha Leon for the password?” I hear Elder Jensen ask.

“And tell Alpha Leon that he hasn’t done any of the financial tasks he was supposed to do?” I ask in return.

I hear almost everyone laughing around me, understanding that this would mean losing face for a Beta and no one would want to lose face in front of his Alpha.

“Besides, my Father would never admit that he was at fault. No matter the evidence against him.” I say.

# Our Mother

Daxton’s p.o.v.

“Good morning, Daxton.” I hear Carl, our future Alpha, say. I doubt it is a good morning if he is standing behind me, he only comes looking for me if someone told him to come and get me.

“Who sent you?” I ask him as I turn to face him. I want to look into his eyes when he answers me; it will tell me if he is aware of why he was sent here.

“My Mother, I believe it has to do with an invitation from Shadow Valley Pack. Between you and me, I think Dad might order you to go.” Carl answers and I know that he is telling the truth.

I am forty-seven, and I still haven’t found my true Mate-bond; I never met a woman my Lycan felt a connection with. I have been waiting for twenty-nine years to find that connection, but so far, I haven’t been able to find her, and I gave up on finding her years ago.

The people around me are still hoping that I will find her one day; they want me to go to other Packs to look for her. I did that for over a decade with no results and now I no longer want to go through it.

“I am sorry, Daxton. Mom wants you at the Pack-house for lunch on the Alpha floor.” Carl says, and I know that he is sorry; our entire future leadership understands me.

None of them have found their true Mate-bond yet and they have to attend as many events as the Pack gets invited to.

I reluctantly follow Carl to the Pack-house; there is no point in shooting the messenger. I am not sure how this lunch will go, but something tells me I will have given everyone a piece of my mind before it ends.

Chatter is coming from the dining room and I can already hear my Mother’s voice above the others.

“If he doesn’t find his Mate during that Alpha Ceremony, he will need to take Daniella as his chosen Mate.” Mom says and even though I am not in the room, I know the smirk Daniella will have on her face.

“I will never take Daniella as my chosen Mate. If and that is a big IF I take a chosen Mate, I will decide who becomes my chosen Mate. You don’t have a say in it, Mother.” I say calmly, knowing that this annoys the hell out of her.

Not just my tone of voice but also the fact that I use the word Mother instead of Mom.

No one says a word as I sit down across the table from my Mother and Daniella; both of them have an annoyed look on their face. Carl sits down in the seat that was meant for me, next to Daniella.

“What is this I hear about an invitation, Luna?” I ask, ensuring everyone understands I know why I was summoned.

“Shadow Valley Pack will get another Alpha in about seven months; we got invited to attend and to bring along some of our unmated Pack-members.” Our Luna answers and I know there is no way I am getting away with refusing to go.

“I didn’t know that Nico had found his connection yet and why does Alpha Leon think it is smart to hand over the Pack so soon?” I ask the question that is probably running through everyone’s mind.

We had all met Nico over the years and he didn’t strike me as the most competent for the Alpha position, not to mention the woman who was always with him. If I am not mistaken, her name is Lucy, but we never found out what her rank is or who her parents are.

The last time Nico was here was about four months ago, and we all had felt that something was off that day. We never figured out what was wrong, but the guy had been jumpy throughout the entire visit and he had eyed every woman in the Pack with suspicion until he was able to see their faces.

“None of us knew he had found a connection until the invitation arrived, that is. As to why Alpha Leon is so eager to step down, any guess could be a good one.” Our Luna answers.

Usually, when a future Alpha finds his connection, his parents make it known to every Pack and not just the allied Packs.

For his parents not to make it known immediately can only mean a few things. He could have gotten someone pregnant who isn’t his true Mate-bond, he could have taken a chosen Mate for an alliance, or he could have broken the connection to his first Mate for whatever reason.

“Why don’t you accompany Daxton to the Alpha Ceremony, Daniella?” My Mother asks, but luckily our Luna quickly shoots that idea down.

“Sorry, but we have chosen the unmated Pack-members already. Daniella is still young and has all the time in the world to find her connection. We will be bringing Pack-members that have been waiting at least five years to find their connection.” Our Luna responds and I can tell that she is telling the truth.

“We did that on purpose, Daxton.” She tells me through the mind-link, and for once, I am grateful that our Luna can be conning from time to time.

Unlike most, our Luna isn’t afraid to talk back to my Mother. My Mother knows that most still consider her this Pack’s Beta female and that means she gets away with a lot of her behavior, but even my Mother isn’t stupid enough to go against our Luna.

Our Luna has the final say and no one is going to argue with her about it, not even me.

My Mother and Daniella don’t seem to be too pleased with our Luna, but my twin Brother, Darius, has a damn smirk on his face and hell breaks loose the moment he opens his mouth.

“You seem eager to have her as a Daughter in law. Why don’t I take Daniella as my chosen Mate?” Darius says with a smirk on his face.

Yeah, leave it to my twin Brother to piss off our Mother.

# Missing Something?

Darius’ p.o.v.

The moment the invitation came in, I knew it would mean trouble between my Mother and my twin Brother.

And yes, I say my Mother for a reason. Daxton might be my twin Brother, but she always treated him less than me, and for the first ten years of our lives, we even believed that we were separated by a whole year.

It wasn’t until our former Alpha overheard a conversation between me and Daxton that we were told that we were twins.

It explained quite a lot of things to both of us, and Daxton has pulled away from our Mother ever since; there even was a time he refused to acknowledge that she was his Mother.

We still don’t understand why she favors me over Daxton and we both doubt that we will ever find out.

I listen to the words my Mother speaks, but I don’t respond and I don’t have to. Daxton can take care of himself, but I am starting to get agitated by Mother’s relentless quest to get Daxton to take a chosen Mate and preferably Daniella.

None of us likes Daniella; it goes back to our childhood, and she hasn’t given us a reason yet to change our minds.

Daniella is the Granddaughter of a former Elder and she was always after Preston. No matter what anyone told her, she kept going after him and we thought she might trick him into a chosen Mate-bond.

Daxton, Rayden and I would always be with Preston and we have seen Daniella try a few desperate things to get into Preston’s bed, but thank the Goddess that she never succeeded. It would have been this Pack’s downfall and one of us would have been charged with murder.

Mother stares at me when I suggest that I take Daniella as a chosen Mate; I know she doesn’t think Daniella is good enough to be a Beta’s Mate, and she will object to my suggestion.

“Darius, that is ridiculous. Daniella is not cut out to be a Beta’s Mate; she would never be able to support you the way you need your Mate to support you.” Mother replies and I see a devilish look in Rayden’s eyes.

“Then she isn’t suited to be Daxton’s Mate either; after all, they are twins, and that makes Daxton also a Beta.” Rayden states and normally I would say that no one can argue with that, but I know how my Mother feels about Daxton and Beta in the same sentence.

“Darius is Silver Eclipse’s Beta; Daxton holds no title. Daniella can be his chosen Mate, but not that of my little boy.” My Mother growls and I know Rayden is going to spill the beans.

“What do you mean with Daxton holds no title? I thought that twins always shared everything, their Mate and their rank.” Ruth, Rayden’s Mate, asks.

“Nice safe, Rayden.” I hear Preston say over our mind-link.

I would like to hear how my Mother is going to get herself out of this pickle; either she acknowledges that Daxton is also a Beta, or she has to tell a lie.

Daniella has had a disgusted look on her face since Ruth mentioned that twins share a Mate, it seems like she hadn’t taken that into consideration.

“You are right, Ruth. A twin usually shares a Mate and a rank, but Daxton made a mess of his life at the age of twenty. It is a shameful period and I don’t like to get reminded of it. I told Preston that Daxton’s status had been damaged and that only Darius had a right to the Beta of Silver Eclipse Pack.” My Mother answers Ruth.

Ruth looks at Daxton for a very long time and I know that he is getting uncomfortable by the way she is looking at him.

“I’m sorry for staring, Daxton. I am just trying to see the monster because only a monster wouldn’t deserve his rank or a true Mate-bond. I will let you know when I have found that monster, even though I have a feeling that I am looking in the wrong direction.” Ruth says.

Daxton is trying to hide his laughter, but I am not even trying. Ruth knows what to say and when to say it; she always manages to lighten up a tense situation.

“Ruth, I don’t like what you are implying…..” My Mother starts to say, but Ruth just raises her hand to shut her up.

“I am not implying anything. It is just a result of the information that you gave me; the only thing I could come up with is that whatever Daxton did must have painted him as a monster and nothing less. I can’t see that monster in him and I doubt his Mate will.” Ruth replies and I see Daxton shaking with laughter.

Our Mother isn’t used to someone interrupting her or telling her how they feel about her, and Ruth doesn’t have a problem doing both.

“Daxton will never find his connection after all these years; it is time he accepts the fact that he will never have a true Mate-bond.” My Mother says and I have to grit my teeth to keep quiet.

“Okay, let’s see if I can get this straight. You believe that Daxton will never find his Mate, but that also means that Darius will never find his Mate. Because Daxton will never find his Mate, you want him to take a chosen Mate and that means that Darius needs to find a chosen Mate too.

They are twins, and that means sharing a Mate; maybe Daniella is willing to take two Mates. Oh, hold on. Her face tells me enough; she is disgusted by the idea of having two Mates. This leaves me with one last question: why settle for the twin that has no right to a high rank according to his Mother?” Ruth states, her eyes locked with those of my Mother.

Damn, that woman is good. She managed to ask a question that has eluded me all these years.

My Mother is looking a little pale, and Daniella looks as if she is about to throw up; why does that deduction from Ruth unsettle them so much? Have I been missing something all these years?

# Goddess' Gift

Dallas’ p.o.v.

Okay, this is not what I had been expecting. I don’t believe anyone in our Squad had seen it coming and I am still a little baffled.

Captain Jordan announced his retirement at the ceremony that would make me a fully pledged member of the Squad, but it turned out to go a little differently after his announcement.

Elder Jensen had appointed me as the new Squad Captain and everyone had started cheering for me, but I had been unable to say a word. I have been here a little over six months and now I have my own Squad.

I know there have been a few others who made Squad Captain within a year of arriving, but I am not sure if this is what I want or need in my life at the moment.

I mean, it is an honor that they believe that I can handle this. There is a downside to it, though. I might have to visit Shadow Valley Pack, and I am not sure if I am ready for that at the moment.

“Captain, Elder Jensen wants to see you. He is waiting in your office.” Joshua, my second in command, says and I wonder why Elder Jensen didn’t link me. “You have your block up, Captain.”

I smile at Joshua as I walk out of my room; I didn’t just take over as Captain; I also got Jordan’s room, and that means living on the other side of the top floor. Joshua follows me to my office on the first floor and everyone we pass slightly bows their heads, a sign of respect for my position.

“I wish they wouldn’t do that; it makes me feel uncomfortable. I am still the same person as before, and now the same people who ignored me suddenly show me respect.” I say to Joshua as another woman slightly bows her head.

“It will become even worse; they will start to talk to you.” He replies teasingly and Charna is laughing her ass off.

I softly growl at Joshua, and he is smart enough to create a little distance between us. He is one of the few people in our Squad that knows about what other members of other Squads have said to me, each and every one of them implicating that I was Jordan’s lover.

It wasn’t until someone said that I had to go and find my own true Mate-bond, that I lost control of my patients and Charna. That fucking Idiot is still in the infirmary and once he has fully recovered, he gets sent home.

No one has dared to make a similar remark to me ever since, but I have gotten enough death glares and I prefer it that way. My Squad members know that I got where I am because of all the hard work I put into it, and none of them question my ability to lead this Squad.

“Elder Jensen, I apologize for having my block up. I was just finishing up for my last exam and I didn’t want to get distracted.” I say as I sit down behind my desk.

“No worries, I knew you were studying. I wanted to do this personally and in private; I know this will be difficult for you, and it might not.” Elder Jensen says.

Joshua and I are looking at one another, this guy is talking in riddles and I don’t think I have the patience for it today.

Elder Jensen holds out an envelope for me and after a small hesitation, I take it from his outstretched hand. I recognize the Pack emblem and my first instinct is to throw it back at Elder Jensen, but my curiosity wins.

We are proud to announce the Alpha Ceremony for our Son, Nico, and the Luna Ceremony for his Mate, Lucy.

I don’t bother reading the rest of the card. I close the card before putting it in the envelope, and I hand it back to Elder Jensen.

“We both know that Nico and Lucy don’t have a true Mate-bond and that causes an issue for the Elders, but we also want to send out a message to every other Pack in the Kingdom. So, we will wait until the Ceremony, and you will get the honor of telling them that the Alpha Ceremony is canceled.” Elder Jensen says.

Joshua looks at me for a moment before he seems to understand why I am getting the honor of disrupting an Alpha Ceremony.

“How long do we have?” I ask Elder Jensen, I need to prepare myself mentally.

“You have over six months to prepare; you know the rules for an Alpha or Luna Ceremony cancellation. Also, make sure that there is a trial date for Alpha Leon, just in case he is willing to fight our decision in front of the King.” Elder Jensen replies.

“Okay, Joshua. Let’s get this Shitshow on the road; I want the cancellation forms filled out. Alpha Leon will ask for them and he will ask for a trial to overturn their own Pack-law.” I say as I show Elder Jensen to the door.

I open the door to let Elder Jensen out and I see my third in command, Jesper, waiting outside the door.

“Get in here, Jesper. We have more than enough to do and, luckily, a whole lot of time to do it in. I do need some answers, though, and maybe you can help me with that.” I say as Jesper walks into my office.

Joshua hands him the envelope and I softly growl at the mere sight of the Pack emblem on it.

For a few moments, it is quiet in my office, but then Jesper starts laughing his ass off.

“Let me guess, we get to break up the happy shindig?” He asks and starts laughing even harder. Someone seems to be happy to be a party pooper and I actually have to giggle.

I decide to tell both of them why I get the privilege of dealing with the cancellation and both men growl loudly.

Jesper went through a similar situation and Joshua had his connection broken before there was a chance to form a bond.

Why Nico chose Lucy over me is still unknown; Jesper and Joshua both know why they were turned down. Neither of them had a high enough rank; both women wanted an Alpha.",2,1754912820.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

When I started in medical billing and coding, I thought memorizing CPT, ICD-10, and HCPCS codes would be the hard part. Nope. The *real* challenge is translating between three dialects — “doctor,” “insurance rep,” and “confused patient” — while chugging coffee like it’s an IV drip.

Stuff I wish someone told me sooner:

1. **If it’s not documented, it didn’t happen** Good provider notes = less pain, fewer appeals, and more time for coffee.
2. **Insurance reps are people (allegedly)** Some are great, some make you question your life choices. Be nice, keep call logs, it pays off.
3. **Denials are just puzzles** A missing modifier can turn a “Nope” into a “Paid in full.” Detective hat optional.
4. **Always be learning** ICD-10 updates every October, rules change, and tech keeps evolving. Curiosity isn’t optional.

It’s not the easiest gig — lots of details, deadlines, and denial-induced sighs — but few things beat turning a rejected claim into money in the bank.

Does anyone here know where I can get a free version of this story?","In the empty room, Jessica Atkinson held a paintbrush in her hand, listening to her mother's weary voice over the phone.

Stella Grant said, ""Jessi, have you thought about what we talked about last time? Your grandfather's seriously ill. You're the only child your dad and I have. Are you really still not coming home to take over the company?""

In the dim light, Jessica added the final stroke to a painting of a family of three.

Just as Stella thought she'd failed to convince her daughter again, Jessica suddenly spoke, ""Okay.""

Stella froze, clearly caught off guard. ""Y-you're saying yes?""

""Yes."" Jessica's voice was calm. ""I'll do it. But I need some time to wrap things up here. I'll be back in 15 days.""

After a few more words, she ended the call.

Jessica stepped out of the room and looked down at the three people in the living room.

Her eyes landed on the man sitting on the couch—Brian Atkinson. His features were striking, sharp without being harsh.

He had a quiet, restrained kind of presence. His shirt and slacks were perfectly tailored, the collar buttoned all the way to the top. He looked every bit the picture of elegance and control.

This was Jessica's husband, the man she had insisted on marrying even though it meant turning down her family's arrangement and cutting ties with them.

In Hartdale, Brian held tremendous power and was always serious and distant. People around him saw him as cold and untouchable, yet now he was speaking to another woman in a gentle tone.

Beside them, a boy around five years old with delicate features, Jacob Atkinson, threw himself into the woman's arms. Blinking his wide eyes, he said sweetly, ""Maddie, I want fish casserole. Will you make it for me?""

Madeline Houghton tapped his nose with a fond smile. ""Of course.""

Jacob's eyes lit up, clearly thrilled. He remarked, ""Maddie, you're the best. Not like my mom—she never lets me eat too much."" As he spoke, he even pouted a little.

Madeline smiled and gently coaxed him, ""Then you've got to eat a little extra today, Jake.""

Jacob nodded with a warm chuckle. ""Maddie, I wish you were my real mom.""

Madeline's smile deepened.

Upstairs, Jessica felt a dull ache in her chest. She always thought kids tended to overeat when they liked something. She only watched Jacob's diet because she didn't want him to get sick. That was all.

Jessica didn't feel like watching any longer. That was her husband and her son, but somehow, the three of them looked more like a real family. She was the one who seemed out of place.

She turned around and went back into the room.

Not long after, footsteps came from outside. Madeline walked in. Her makeup was flawless, her smile gentle. ""Jessi, come downstairs with me. Let's celebrate Jake's birthday together.""

Madeline used to be Jessica's intern. She came from a poor background and was barely competent.

Jessica had once listened to Madeline cry about her past, saying that if she still couldn't find a job, she would have no choice but to go back to her hometown and get married.

Jessica had felt sorry for her and brought her into the company. She never imagined she'd end up bringing in the very woman who would destroy her family.

Madeline had studied her, mimicked her, and tried to take her place—to become the new Mrs. Atkinson. By the time Jessica realized it, Madeline had already made her way into the household, getting along perfectly with her husband and son.

Jessica had long seen through the mask Madeline wore and had hated herself for bringing trouble into her own home. Jessica said coldly, ""I'm not feeling well. I'm not going.""

Madeline spoke with feigned innocence, ""Jessi, you're Jake's mom. It would mean a lot to him if you said happy birthday to him.""

Jessica frowned, about to turn her down again. But then something crossed her mind, and she let out a sigh.

She figured this was between her and Madeline. Jacob was still just a child who shouldn't be affected by it. As his mother, Jessica felt it was only right to wish him a happy birthday.

With that thought, she set down her paintbrush and walked downstairs, brushing past Madeline's shoulder, completely ignoring her.

For a split second, Madeline's smile froze. A flicker of malice passed through her eyes, but she quickly followed after.

When Jessica saw Brian and Jacob, she paused.

Ten years ago, she'd joined the Atkinson Group to challenge herself and met Brian there. They'd fought, teased, and fallen into marriage. She had rejected her family's carefully laid plans and insisted on marrying Brian, even cutting ties with them to do it.

For the past ten years, she'd never once regretted her decision. Her husband was rich, handsome, and he treated her well. Their son was smart and adorable. She had once truly believed she had a happy life.

But then, Jessica looked at Madeline, who was smiling attentively as she served food to Brian and Jacob. Madeline's presence had changed everything that once felt so perfect.

Jessica silently picked up her fork to eat, but then a wave of nausea hit her. She quickly put the fork down and rushed to the bathroom, gagging over the sink.

Brian stood up, looking concerned, about to follow her, but Madeline stopped him in a flurry of panic.

She clutched his sleeve, her eyes wide with worry. ""Mr. Atkinson, what's going on with Jessi?""

Brian spoke gently, trying to reassure her, ""She's been like this lately. It's nothing. Don't worry.""

After saying that, he turned to look at Jessica and sneered coldly, ""What's the excuse this time? A cold? Or is the food at home not good enough?""

Jessica didn't respond. She wiped the corner of her mouth with a tissue and thought, 'If I said I was pregnant, would they even believe me?

'Forget it. I'm leaving soon anyway. Why bother telling them? No need to ruin the sweet little bond between my husband and his mistress.'

Even as a secretary, Madeline still dared to chide her boss, speaking in a syrupy tone, ""Mr. Atkinson, don't say that about Jessi. Maybe she really isn't feeling well. She's lost a lot of weight lately.""

Then she stood up, made a cup of hot chamomile tea, and handed it to Jessica. ""Jessi, are you okay? Here, have some chamomile tea.""

Still nauseous and not wanting to see Madeline's face, Jessica grew irritated and pushed her away.

She hadn't even used much force, but Madeline let herself fall with the motion, and the hot chamomile tea spilled onto her own hand.

""Ow!"" Madeline cried out.

""Maddie,"" Brian and Jacob called out at the same time. They instantly rushed to her side, their eyes full of concern as they looked at her hand which was scalded red.

Jacob's eyes welled with tears, feeling sorry for her. ""Maddie, does it hurt a lot?""

Madeline forced a smile and tried to look strong. ""It's okay, Jake. I was just being careless. It doesn't hurt.""

Brian glared at Jessica, his eyes blazing. His voice was like ice. ""What are you trying to pull now?""

Jessica was overwhelmed with sadness and disappointment. She caught the smug look in Madeline's eyes, then saw her own son standing in front of Madeline like a little protector. Jessica shut her eyes in despair and said, ""I didn't do anything.""

But Brian didn't believe her. When the family doctor arrived, Brian helped Madeline sit down, letting her lean against his chest. There was disappointment in his deep-set eyes as well.

He said accusingly, ""Jessi, you've changed. You were never the kind of person to do something like this out of jealousy.""

Jessica thought, 'I've changed? Yeah, I have.'

Ten years ago, she wouldn't have had stretch marks from childbirth. Her skin wouldn't have gone dull from staying up all night.

And she definitely wouldn't have quit her job and become a housewife just because of Brian's words—only to be replaced by another woman.

Jessica suddenly felt exhausted. She held back the explanation she almost gave and turned to head upstairs.

Right before entering her room, she looked back down at the chaotic scene below and gave one last glance at the husband and son she had once loved with everything she had.

Brian and Jacob were still the same, hovering around Madeline, the three of them tangled up like they couldn't bear to be apart.

Jessica gave a bitter smile and shook her head. Then she gently touched her belly and set a countdown on her phone. Without a trace of hesitation, she turned and went back into the room.

From this moment on, she wouldn't disturb them again.

# Chapter 2 She Was Done Playing Along

The noise outside gradually faded. Jessica didn't bother to check what was going on out there. With her earplugs and sleep mask on, she slept straight through to morning.

Since she'd already decided to return and claim her inheritance, she had to resign from Atkinson Group.

After giving birth to Jacob, she had rarely shown up at the company. But back when Brian had taken over the family business, she had been right there beside him, helping him build everything from the ground up.

Atkinson Group's rise to the number-one spot in the country had a lot to do with her. So even though she didn't come in regularly, she still received a generous annual bonus and profit share.

Early in the morning, Jessica looked at herself in the mirror. Her thick, wavy hair framed a flawless face. She was stunning, but her eyes carried no light.

She had always been beautiful. Even after becoming a stay-at-home mom, even after all the sleepless nights and labor, her looks had barely changed.

But the morning sickness, the emotional strain, and the cold treatment from her family had taken their toll. Her eyes were dull, lifeless—like fish washed up on the shore.

On the top floor of Atkinson Group, Jessica was waiting for her resignation papers to be printed.

Just then, a few employees behind her started chatting, their voices drifting into earshot.

One said, ""Did you see Madeline's Instagram post?""

Another asked, ""No, what did she post this time?""

Someone else added, ""She posted a bunch of stuff. Looks like she was throwing someone a birthday party. You should check it out.""

They were laughing as they teased each other, but when they looked up and saw Jessica, their smiles froze.

One of them gasped, ""Ms. Grant?""

Another asked, ""Ms. Grant, what brings you here to the office?""

Jessica gave a casual nod. As soon as the employees finished greeting her, they dashed away in a hurry. More whispers followed as they left.

Someone sneered, ""What a buzzkill. What's the executive secretary Jessica doing back here at the company?""

Another said sarcastically, ""She's already the CEO's wife. What's the point of showing off in front of us?""

Someone else snorted, ""I don't think Mr. Atkinson's that close to her anymore. I wouldn't be surprised if they're getting a divorce.""

Jessica didn't react. She had never been popular in the company and had long gotten used to this kind of talk.

If she hadn't gone through so much workplace bullying in the past—if Brian hadn't stepped in and helped her so many times—she wouldn't have fallen for him to begin with.

Bored from waiting, Jessica opened Instagram on her phone. The first thing that popped up was a nine-photo post from Madeline.

The first image was taken at Jacob's birthday party last night. The decorations were extravagant, and the giant three-tier cake in the center was impossible to miss.

What caught Jessica's eye was a photo taken in a hospital. Three hands, all different sizes, stacked on top of each other—it looked so warm and loving.

Jessica thought, 'It was just a burn. Why'd they go to the hospital again?'

She found it ridiculous and scrolled through the comments. Most of them were full of envy and well-wishes.

One comment read: \[Wow, a birthday party for the little one? Looks so happy.\]

Another joked: \[Showing off again—so who's your husband anyway? Not gonna show your bestie?\]

Someone else wrote: \[No matter what happens, as long as the family's together, that's what really matters.\]

Jessica was speechless. She knew Madeline had posted those on purpose, just to get under her skin and push her into snapping at Brian.

If it had been before, Jessica really wouldn't have been able to stand this pretentious act, watching her own husband and son leave her at home to care for a woman who had done nothing but poorly imitate her from the start.

But now that she was about to leave, she naturally didn't care anymore.

Jessica gave a dry smile and tapped the screen lightly to give the post a like.

After getting her resignation papers, Jessica went straight to the CEO's office and handed them to Brian's current personal assistant.

The people in the Secretary's Office, just like the ones who had been whispering earlier, looked down on her for showing up as if she were trying to brag. But the moment they saw the resignation papers, they gasped in shock.

Someone asked, ""I-I didn't read that wrong, did I?""

""Ms. Grant is quitting?"" another exclaimed.

The assistant froze, visibly panicked. ""M-Ma'am, Mr. Atkinson is in a very important meeting right now. Maybe we should wait and let him have a look at these until he's done.""

""No need. I'm just a figurehead executive secretary. You have the authority to process this. No need to bother him,"" Jessica said with a light smile.

People around them sighed under their breath.

""Is the rumor true? Jessica and Mr. Atkinson are getting a divorce? And the other woman is Madeline?""

""Why Madeline? Doesn't she have a family?""

""Are you dumb? Did you even see that Instagram post? That hand is clearly Mr. Atkinson's. Who else in Hartdale could wear a Rolex that expensive?""

""Exactly. Didn't you notice Madeline took over all of Jessica's work after she went on maternity leave?""

""Now that Jessica's quitting, maybe she's handing the position over.""

Jessica knew exactly how nosy these people were. In the past, hearing things like this would've crushed her. She would've curled up in bed at night, crying quietly under the covers.

But now, she suddenly realized that once she let it go, none of it really mattered.

She smiled at everyone like she couldn't hear a word and said, ""Thank you all for your hard work these past ten years. I hope Atkinson Group continues to thrive for many more to come.""

Everyone fell silent in embarrassment. Only then did Jessica return to her desk and begin packing up everything she'd accumulated over the years.

She had worked here for ten years, and her workspace was filled to the brim with books she'd bought when she first started out and notes she'd taken while learning to understand Brian as his secretary.

On one page, it clearly said: ""1. He needs a cup of hand-ground coffee every morning. 2. He hates being late. 3. He doesn't allow any woman to wear perfume around him.""

There were many notes like that. Every single one of them had been built with Jessica's effort.

She had poured so much into doing her job as a secretary well, but people always assumed the role was just a man's plaything—that all it took was a body, not a brain.

Only Brian had seen her working late into the night—reviewing contracts, building presentations, digging into the background on every competitor of Atkinson Group, and reciting business reports like they were second nature.

It was because she worked hard enough that someone as untouchable as Brian had come down from his pedestal to get close to her.

Jessica had once believed Brian was the one person who truly understood her. She was wrong. After ten years, all those memories and feelings had turned to dust.

She focused on packing her things. Just then, the meeting ended, and Madeline walked out first.

She had been beaming, but the moment she saw Jessica, her smile froze. Madeline thought, 'Why is Jessica here? Did she see my Instagram post? Is she here to lose it on me?

Just thinking about it made her excited. She went back to her desk, restless, waiting for the storm to hit. On the outside, though, she kept her head down, her eyes turning red, like she'd just been horribly wronged.

Brian was the last to walk out. As he passed the Secretary's Office, he saw Jessica there at the office.

Her desk was the closest to his office, a setup that once symbolized her status and their past affection.

But now, just the sight of her annoyed him especially when she looked like she was in a good mood, flipping through a book with a faint smile on her face.

Right next to her, Madeline sat with her head down, looking dejected, quietly dabbing at her tears with a tissue.

Brian frowned, tapped the corner of Jessica's desk, and ordered, ""Come in.""

Jessica looked up, calm and composed. ""Okay.""

Once she stepped inside, Brian got straight to the point. ""The company doesn't need you right now. If there's no special reason, don't come to Atkinson Group again.""

# Chapter 3 Mrs. Atkinson

Jessica froze. No matter how many times she'd been disappointed by Brian, every time she heard his cold tone, it still felt like a knife stabbing straight into her chest.

Her eyes lowered, and the smile on her face disappeared. ""Okay.""

Brian had expected Jessica to lash out, but he hadn't thought she'd give in so easily. Only then did he actually look at her.

He noticed Madeline was right—Jessica really had lost a lot of weight lately.

He thought, 'Maybe Jessica really was throwing up last night because she wasn't feeling well. Maybe she wasn't being jealous in front of Madeline after all.'

His lips pressed together, and his tone softened slightly. ""Madeline's been doing your job well. Your focus now should be taking care of Jake. I've explained this to you so many times—there's nothing between me and her.

""Jessi, stop making trouble. Don't make me regret choosing you to be my wife.""

Jessica thought, 'Regret? I regret it too. I really regret giving up my family's business just to become this so-called Mrs. Atkinson. The Grant family has real status. Grant Group is powerful. I could've gone back and been the heiress everyone doted on instead.'

Jessica closed her eyes and calmly pulled out her resignation letter. Her tone was polite but distant. ""Mr. Atkinson, then please go ahead and approve this. I'll officially resign starting tomorrow.""

With that, she turned to leave. But just as she reached the door, Brian grabbed her arm.

""Jessica?"" Brian sounded surprised, as if he hadn't fully processed what was happening. Holding the resignation in one hand, he instinctively reached out and caught her.

He stared at her signature on the resignation letter. His face darkened as he held back a surge of anger. ""You're doing this to spite me? I thought you came today to make peace, but now you're taking it even further?""

""No, Mr. Atkinson. You said Atkinson Group didn't need me, and it just so happens—I feel the same."" Jessica kept her gaze lowered, her thick lashes trembling slightly. ""It's been ten years. Atkinson Group isn't what it used to be.

""Since everyone clearly loves Madeline, I figured I might as well step down now instead of holding a position and collecting a paycheck for doing nothing.""

Brian let out a cold laugh. His eyes were sharp, like he could see straight through her excuse. ""Don't use the past ten years to guilt me. I know Atkinson Group wouldn't be what it is today without you. You were a great employee.

""But Jessica, ever since you had the baby, you haven't been involved in any business matters. I've been nothing but considerate. All you have to do is take care of our son, and you'll always be the lady of Atkinson Group.

""You can't even handle something this simple, and now you say you're stepping aside? All you're doing is putting Madeline in a difficult position. Jessica, I know you too well. You're calculating, but don't be cruel. Since last night, have you even apologized to Maddie?""

Jessica thought, 'Apologize? I'm supposed to apologize to the woman who wrecked my home? Shouldn't she be the one thanking me?'

Suddenly, Jessica let out a laugh and looked at Brian with a hint of curiosity. ""Yes, I'm cruel. Mr. Atkinson, have you never considered giving up?""

The kind of giving up she meant was divorce.

Over the past few years, whenever Brian and Jessica fought, she brought up divorce again and again, and every time it ended in an ugly stalemate.

Brian had never agreed. In his eyes, even if he cheated, Jessica was still his wife.

That was always how it was with Brian—domineering and controlling, a man who held power over all of Hartdale.

As for Jessica, at the beginning, she hadn't really meant to leave. She had been acting out, like Brian said, hoping he'd actually care more about her.

But now, she was tired. She was fine with getting a divorce and going their separate ways. She even thought about the kids. They could each take one, and that would be that.

Brian's face darkened, his grip on her arm tightening like he could snap her in half. ""This is your last chance, Jessica. If you mess up again, I won't hesitate to find Jake a new mom.

""Do you know how many times he's complained to me he has no joy or freedom living with you? Why are you such a failure as both a wife and a mother?""

The word ""failure"" made her close her eyes and let out a long breath.

Jessica thought, 'So that's how it is. Waiting up all night for Brian to come home and making him hangover cures was a failure. Hand-washing his designer suits in the dead of winter until my hands were raw was a failure.

'Tutoring Jake through elementary math, raising a child who fit the Atkinson family's image of an heir was a failure. This home really has no place for me anymore.'

""I'm sorry, Mr. Atkinson,"" Jessica said sincerely. She believed someone who failed should take a final bow and leave the stage.

Her other hand slipped into her coat pocket and tapped her phone screen. The countdown began—there were fourteen days left.

Once everything was in order, she would disappear completely. Brian would never have to be annoyed by her again.

Jessica's attitude caught Brian off guard. He still wanted to say something, but she didn't give him the chance and turned to leave.

She walked away without hesitation. Brian reached out again, but caught nothing.

Suddenly, a sharp pain clenched in his chest, a wave of panic rising fast and hard.

He frowned, watching her disappear down the hall, a strange sense growing stronger—that something important was slipping further and further away from him.

Once outside, Jessica called her best friend, Gabriela Clark. They were besties, though they hadn't spoken in over six years.

Gabriela was a fashion designer, constantly flying around the country, tailoring clothes for different models. A lot of them were male, and with adults working in close quarters, it wasn't unusual for things to happen.

Put plainly, Gabriela went through boyfriends like outfits. Brian had always hated that about her. After Jessica had their child, he'd told her to stay away from Gabriela, said she'd be a bad influence on Jacob.

So Jessica had listened and cut ties with the friend she grew up with for six whole years.

After not hearing from Jessica for years, Gabriela was furious. She picked up and snapped, ""So you finally remembered I exist? Jessica, I thought you were way too far gone in your lovesick haze. And now you finally call—what, regretting it already?""

Jessica let out a helpless laugh, tears falling before she even noticed.

She hadn't cried when Brian humiliated her, hadn't cried when Madeline made a fool of her, not even when the child she carried for nine months called someone else Mom. But with Gabriela, Jessica sobbed in regret.

""Yes, I regret it,"" Jessica said. ""Gabi, if I come back now, is it too late?""

On the other end of the line, Gabriela went quiet for a long time after hearing Jessica's sincere words. When she finally spoke again, her voice was choked with tears.

She said, ""I'm just glad you've come to your senses. You idiot, do you have any idea how exhausting it's been running the studio for you all these years? The entire art world's been waiting for your return.

""Jessica, being a CEO's secretary only buried your talent. You were born to be an artist—you're the last true gem of the Impressionist world. Jessi, I've been waiting for you this whole time.""

""I'm sorry, Gabi. I'm so sorry."" Jessica crouched down in the middle of the street, crying.

Jessica was always meant to be proud. She had been brilliant and talented from the start. Even Brian didn't know that she had studied fine art at a university in Fiorenelle, a city in Aurevia.

Her very first graduation piece had made it into the Viremont Grand Biennale, shocking the entire art world.

After graduation, the paintings she signed off on had sold at auction for more than a million dollars.

And yet, for the sake of so-called experience, she came back to the country and started over in a job that had nothing to do with her field. She studied admin, finance, and business management from scratch and still excelled at it.

She gave up painting for ten years. But today, she had finally decided—she was going back.

# Chapter 4 Her Ungrateful Son

After agreeing on a time with Gabriela to take over the studio, Jessica returned to Atkinson Villa.

She had given herself a 15-day countdown because ten years had left too many things unresolved. She couldn't just walk away. There were still matters to handle.

The most important of all was everything inside Atkinson Villa.

The massive villa, over 5,000 square feet, had no housekeepers simply because Brian thought they were too noisy. The daily cleaning had always fallen to Jessica.

Now that she was leaving, she intended to step down like the perfect secretary she'd always been. It was a matter of pride—as the heiress of the Grant family.

Madeline clearly wasn't the type to do housework, so Jessica had to find a qualified housekeeper for her husband and child.

During the day, Jessica interviewed several candidates, having each of them cook according to Brian's preferences. In the evening, as she was eating at home, an urgent voice came from the front door. ""Chester, call the family doctor. Now."" It was Brian.

Jessica, being pregnant, was especially sensitive to the smell of blood, and the air immediately made her nauseous.

She frowned, an instinctive worry rising. 'What happened? Is he hurt?' she pondered.

She instinctively started toward the door, only to see Brian hurrying in, carrying a woman in his arms. It was winter in Hartdale, snow falling steadily, soaking his hair and shoulders, but he didn't seem to notice.

He laid the woman down on the couch and barked, furious, ""Where is the family doctor? Hurry up.""

Jessica didn't even need to see the woman's face to know who she was. It was Madeline.

Wrapped in her thick robe, Jessica stood to the side and calmly asked, ""What happened to her?""

They had just argued in the morning. Brian glanced at Jessica but didn't seem interested in talking to her. His voice was filled with annoyance. ""She ran into some loan sharks and took a stab to the shoulder.""

""Loan sharks? Whose debt?"" Jessica asked, curious. She thought, 'What, has the CEO of Atkinson Group gone bankrupt?'

Before Brian could respond, Madeline, pale and weak, spoke up in a pitiful voice, ""I'm sorry, Jessi. It's my fault. My dad owes gambling debts, and somehow those people found out I was Mr. Atkinson's secretary.

""They waited on a dark road tonight and tried to kidnap me. I fought back and got hurt. Luckily, Mr. Atkinson was working late and happened to be there. If he hadn't shown up and saved me, I might've been killed.""

""Don't say things like that,"" Brian said sharply. ""As long as I'm around, no one will lay a finger on you. But your place isn't safe for now. I've already called the police. Until they catch those men, you'll stay at Atkinson Villa.""

""No."" Jessica didn't hesitate at all.

Hearing that, Brian looked up at her.

Jessica seemed in good spirits. Maybe it was because she had quit her job and reconnected with her best friend. Her cheeks were rosy, her skin glowing. She wore a soft silk robe, standing there lazily, full of charm.

Brian had been irritable since morning, but hearing Jessica's flat rejection actually calmed him down.

He turned his head, sneering with what looked like mockery. He thought, 'Just like I thought. Another game of push and pull. She acts like she's indifferent, but deep down she's still jealous of Madeline.'

His tone turned low and warning. ""Jessica, this is Atkinson Villa."" He was the one who owned this place. Whoever got to stay here was up to him.

""She still can't stay,"" Jessica said firmly. ""There aren't enough rooms. She has nowhere to sleep.""

Atkinson Villa was big, spanning three full floors, but there were only three actual bedrooms.

One room was for Jacob, one for Jessica, and one for Brian. That was all there was.

There used to be extra guest rooms in Atkinson Villa, but back when Jessica and Brian were newlyweds and still happy, Brian had had them all remodeled.

There was a luxurious nursery, a walk-in closet, a display room for luxury goods, and spaces Jessica used to pass the time—like a flower room, an art studio, and a yoga room. But there were no extra bedrooms.

In fact, the third bedroom was planned by Brian for their second child in the future. But back then, they never imagined that one day they'd be sleeping apart because of emotional distance.

Brian hadn't expected Jessica to reject Madeline's stay for this reason. His face instantly darkened.

His voice was tight, like he was clenching his teeth. ""Jessica, you sleep in the master bedroom.""

The implication was clear—they could share a bed. After all, no matter how strained things had gotten, just three months ago, they had still slept together. That was how Jessica ended up pregnant.

But Jessica didn't care. That night had only happened because Brian was drunk three months ago. Back then, her feelings had been a tangled mess of love and resentment. Now, neither was left. There was no reason for them to be intimate anymore.

Jessica stood her ground, stubborn and unmoving, and the sight of it made Brian's anger boil over.

At that moment, Jacob came downstairs, still groggy from sleep. ""Dad, Mom, what's going on? I heard you two arguing again.""

He spoke with a pouty, wronged tone, then glanced over and saw Madeline on the couch, still bleeding as her wound was being treated. He snapped to attention. ""Maddie.""

Jacob ran over quickly. ""Maddie, what happened? Why are you hurt? Does it hurt? Are you okay?""

Madeline smiled, patting his head, ""It's nothing, Jake. Be good and go back to bed.""

""I'm not going. You're hurt. I'm not sleeping until you're better."" Jacob was still a clingy child, and he clung to Madeline without letting go.

Seeing how much he liked Madeline, Jessica suddenly curved her lips into a smile. ""Jake, don't worry. Maddie might be staying with us for the next few days.

""But since we don't have enough bedrooms, would it be okay if Maddie sleeps in your room with you?""

""Really?"" Jacob's eyes widened, full of excitement and joy. ""Yeah, that'd be—""

Halfway through, he quickly clamped his hand over his mouth. ""No, I didn't mean it like that, Mom.""

Jacob thought, 'I totally forgot. Mom hates it when I act like I love Maddie. The last time I stayed out playing with Maddie too long and forgot to come home, Mom got super mad.

'After that, Dad told me I shouldn't let Mom see how much I love Maddie.'

""It's okay. You can mean it,"" Jessica said quietly, her voice soft as her cold hands beneath the robe rested gently over her belly.

Today, she finally understood what it meant to give birth to an ungrateful child.

Jessica still remembered the day Jacob was born. She'd gone through a long labor for nearly two days. The doctors had said she might not survive and told Brian he had to choose whether to save the mother or the baby.

Brian's eyes had been bloodshot, screaming outside the OR that he only wanted Jessica.

But Jessica had refused. In tears, she'd begged the doctors to save the baby. She'd said she could give up everything, anything—just not the child she shared with Brian.

In the end, she'd pulled through on sheer will, giving birth to Jacob naturally without a single dose of anesthesia.

Jessica gave up her career to raise Jacob herself, day in and day out. And now, what she got in return was a child who favored another woman and wanted a different mom.

Jessica was really tired. She hadn't even wanted to keep the baby she was carrying. When she got the results from last week's checkup, her first instinct had been to give it up.

Her life felt too hopeless. She hadn't planned on having another child with Brian.

But when she thought about leaving, Jessica started to feel a glimmer of hope. She thought that maybe this time, without the Atkinson family holding her back, she and her child could grow freely and things might be better.

With that thought, Jessica stopped looking back and walked away.

Jacob didn't understand why his mom was acting this way. He stood frozen, watching her leave, silent for a long time, and then suddenly burst into tears.

He was a sensitive kid. Even if he didn't understand anything, something deep in his blood told him he was being left behind.

His sudden crying startled Madeline. She quickly hugged him and tried to comfort him, ""Jake, don't cry. I'm right here. Don't be scared.""

She looked at Brian, nervous, her eyes brimming with tears like she was silently accusing Jessica of making Jacob cry again.

Brian's face was grim. He looked up toward the second floor, his eyes brooding. But in the end, he didn't say a word.

# Chapter 5 She'd Had Enough

Jessica slept through the night without dreams. The next morning, when she came downstairs planning to make herself breakfast, she smelled food the moment she reached the stairs.

It was Madeline. She had already made breakfast for the whole family and was now grinding coffee for Brian by hand.

When she saw Jessica, she smiled and greeted her, ""Jessi, you're up. Come on, I made sandwiches. I'm not sure if you'll like them.""

""Maddie's cooking is great. Who wouldn't like it?"" Jacob chimed in with a bright smile, then sneaked a glance at Jessica. There was a flicker of fear in his expression. He was afraid of his mother, and he resented her too.

He felt like Jessica had suddenly become a different person. He didn't understand why she had looked at him with such a cold expression before.

Every time Jacob praised Maddie in the past, it would set Jessica off, making her try harder to be good to him—just so he could use that as a chance to slack off from all his tutoring sessions.

Jessica could more or less guess what her son was thinking. She let out a faint, mocking smile and thought, 'Does he really think I, his mother, can't see through a kid's little tricks?'

Jessica had indeed resented Madeline out of jealousy in the past—but only because she couldn't accept that her husband had such a close third party in his life.

As for how Madeline treated Jacob, Jessica had always turned a blind eye.

Jacob was the heir of the Atkinson family. After Jessica gave birth, Brian's mother, Paisley Atkinson, had warned her countless times not to slack off when it came to Jacob's education.

Jessica had always believed in a happy, low-pressure way of raising her child. She knew Jacob was a lively, sweet boy who loved comic books, playing games, and being in nature.

But as Brian's wife, and as the ever-watched Mrs. Atkinson in high society, she had to play the part of a strict and proper mother.

That was why Jacob always ran to his dad, complaining that his mom was too harsh.

What he didn't know was that, while Jessica was strict, she had read educational books from all over the world, doing her best to create a teaching method that balanced structure and rest.

Jessica might have seemed like a stern mother, but back when Madeline was still her intern, it was Jessica who had personally handed her a hand-drawn storybook she had made herself and asked her to use those toys to bond with Jacob.

Jacob's favorite dish—fish casserole—was something Jessica had taught Madeline how to make, step by step.

Jessica never imagined that all the care and effort she once gave would turn into a weapon against her in the end. Her expression turned cold, touched with a kind of hopeless absurdity. ""What are you wearing?""

Madeline hadn't expected Jessica's first words to be that. She looked nervous. ""I-it's a suit. I didn't have any clothes to change into last night, so I grabbed something from the closet. Jessi, what's wrong?""

Jessica thought, 'What's wrong? A woman who doesn't belong in this house is wearing my clothes, making breakfast for my kid and grinding coffee for my husband—and she's asking me what's wrong?'

Brian seemed to sense Jessica was about to cause trouble again. He frowned and spoke first, ""Jessica, it's just clothes. Don't make a scene. I gave you a black card. You can go buy a hundred more.""

Hearing that, Jessica couldn't help but let out a snort. Her stomach turned. She couldn't even tell if it was the pregnancy or the fact that she hadn't eaten breakfast. ""Brian, did you forget that this piece was...""

It was the one she wore after the first time they slept together.

Back then, Jessica had been young, fresh out of school, filled with curiosity about the world.

At a business party, she'd thought she could help the company close a billion-dollar deal. She'd drunk too much with the client, only to realize later that her drink had been spiked. She'd ended up in bed with the company's CEO by mistake.

The next morning, she'd woken up to find her clothes torn to shreds by Brian. She couldn't go to work and had sat on the bed, blushing in frustration.

Brian had found her reaction cute and had his assistant buy her that custom-tailored suit. After that, he'd reassigned her to be his personal secretary.

Jessica remembered it clearly. That was how everything started between them.

She didn't expect Brian to forget. And now he let Madeline wear the very same outfit she once wore—it was disgusting.

Brian looked at Jessica's face, seeing she was holding something back. He gave a mocking smile, his deep-set eyes flashing with something strange. ""What is it? Say it. Jessica, are you really that attached to a piece of clothing?""",1,1754912679.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1mnap4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningTrainingShoes/comments/1mnap4u/should_you_buy_skechers_archfit_reggae_sport/,Should You Buy Skechers Archfit Reggae Sport Sandals Review for Maximum Comfort?,"I recently had the opportunity to try out the Skechers SKCH-ArchfitReggae Women's Archfit Reggae Sport sandals, and let me just say, my feet had a lot of feelings about this experience. With summer finally rolling in, I was on the lookout for a pair of sandals that weren't just good-looking but also easy on my arch-heavy feet. Lucky for me, these sandals promised comfort, support, and a stylish vibe. But were they worth the hype? Let me walk you through my experience.

**Fit and Comfort**  
Wearing these sandals felt a little like walking on ergonomic clouds. The contoured Arch Fit footbed is no joke — Skechers wasn’t messing around when they got podiatrists to sign off on this design. For someone like me who spends a ridiculous amount of time on her feet, this was an absolute game-changer. The footbed molds to your foot over time, which reduces shock and makes every step feel cushioned.  

Another standout? The adjustable sling-back strap closure. My feet like to play Goldilocks — not too tight, not too loose — and the Hook & Loop system made sure everything stayed just right. The stretch fabric uppers also deserve a shoutout. They accommodated my slightly wide feet effortlessly without feeling restrictive.

**Design That Stands Out**  
At first glance, these sandals scream ""casual chic"" with a dash of sporty vibes. Not too fancy, not too basic — the sweet spot where style and practicality meet. The thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) outer material gives off a durable yet lightweight feel, which I appreciate when I’m hauling grocery bags or chasing my kids around the park. They’ve got a really neat texture to them, adding a bit of flair.  

The range of colors offered is another plus because it means I can coordinate these with just about any outfit. Whether I’m in jeans, summer dresses, or workout leggings, these sandals somehow work every time.

**Durability and Build**  
With the sole made from thermoplastic rubber, these sandals are definitely built for more than just the occasional coffee run. I tested these out during one of my infamous impromptu hikes (read: got lost in a park), and they held up much better than most sandals I’ve owned. The grip from the treaded sole was impressive, keeping me stable on a variety of terrains.  

One surprising bonus? They’re machine washable. Yes, you heard that right. If you're someone like me who constantly battles dust, spills, or random stains (hello, ketchup accident), this feature will save you plenty of frustration.

**Good Points**  
- Patented Arch Fit contoured footbed provides exceptional support.  
- Adjustable Hook & Loop straps cater to a variety of foot shapes.  
- Stretch fabric upper combines comfort with functionality.  
- Machine washable, which is ideal for maintaining hygiene.  
- Durable thermoplastic rubber sole offers reliable traction.

**Areas of Concern**  
It certainly wasn’t all rainbows and sunshine for these sandals, though. For one, while the sole is super durable, it does take a bit of breaking in. My first few wears felt a tad stiff, and though this got better, it’s something to keep in mind. Also, while the sandals are marketed for their comfort, people with ultra-narrow feet might find them a bit too roomy. The adjustable straps help, but some tweaking is still needed.  

- Breaking-in period required for the sole.  
- Roomy fit might not suit individuals with narrow feet.  

**Competing Products**  
These sandals compete with similar options like Teva Tirra and KEEN Whisper sandals. Comparing these, the Skechers pair wins in the style department, hands down. They feel less bulky than the KEEN sandals and are way easier to pair with casual outfits than the Teva Tirra.  

However, Teva sandals do have an edge when it comes to longer, more strenuous hikes, as their sole design favors rugged trails. KEEN’s waterproof feature also makes them a go-to option for wet environments like kayaking or beach walks. But for sheer everyday comfort and versatility, Skechers bridges the gap more effectively.

**Price Worthiness**  
For everything this sandal brings to the table — comfort, style, and versatility — it’s pretty well-justified in its price bracket. That said, it’s slightly on the higher end for casual sandals. But when you factor in features like the podiatrist-approved arch support, stress-reducing footbed, and easy maintenance, it does feel like money well spent. Considering similar products from competitors either compromise on style or lack a comparable level of support, these sandals find themselves in a solid middle ground.

1mnap0m,https://i.redd.it/yz65hvn5odif1.png,"Inside My Dreamy, Fully Customized Lichess Homepage","**Where Chess Meets Cozy Magic**

There’s something deeply personal about the digital spaces we inhabit, especially when they reflect our passions and quirks in every pixel and animation. Today, I want to invite you inside my Lichess homepage — a fully customized sanctuary where the cold logic of chess melds seamlessly with warm, whimsical vibes.

This isn’t just a dashboard; it’s my cozy corner of the internet, built pixel by pixel to inspire, entertain, and keep me connected to the game I love.

# First thing you see: the ethereal northern lights dancing behind the UI

As soon as I load the page, I’m greeted by an animated northern lights aura gently undulating behind everything — subtle yet mesmerizing. It’s like having a glimpse of the arctic sky’s magical glow, grounding me with calm focus before a game. The shifting hues of green and purple create a living background, making the chessboard feel like the center of a vast, enchanted universe.

# Twin Peaks font — because style matters

Everywhere my username appears — from the homepage to the deepest corners of the site — it’s rendered in the iconic Twin Peaks font. The retro, eerie vibe of that font adds an unexpected cinematic flair to my identity, like I’m starring in my own chess mystery saga. It’s a small detail, but it’s like a secret handshake with those who notice, a signature that feels uniquely mine.

# The hearth of my homepage: a glowing fireplace with floating embers

No matter how tense the game, the warm glow of my animated fireplace offers a reassuring presence. Flickering flames crackle softly as tiny embers drift upwards — a dynamic, living element that brings the digital space to life. It’s the perfect reminder to stay calm and steady, like chess strategy unfolding in a quiet room with a fire burning nearby.

# My companions: a peacefully sleeping kitten and festive charm

Resting just beside the warmth of the fire is a static sleeping kitten, curled up on a soft pillow. There’s something deeply soothing about that image — a symbol of rest, patience, and quiet observation, virtues every chess player learns to cherish.

Nearby, three Christmas stockings hang quietly — nostalgic, static reminders of joy, tradition, and a little holiday magic that lingers all year round. Alongside these, you’ll find a cherry pie, a lit cigarette with an ashtray, and a steaming cup of coffee — all static but evocative, each telling its own story of comfort, indulgence, and ritual.

# Tools that keep my game sharp and my progress tracked

My homepage isn’t just about ambiance — it’s a powerful hub for my chess journey.

* The **KOTH Climber script shortcut** sits ready, a clickable gateway to tweak and visualize exactly where I stand on the King of the Hill rating slider. It’s an intuitive way to measure progress and plan the next move in my competitive climb.
* The **Titled Players Radar Tracker** is another essential. One click opens a sleek display to log new games, keeping tabs on my battles with chess elites and sharpening my strategy against top-tier opponents.
* And because every great moment deserves to be saved, my **GIF folder** neatly stores a collection of favorite game highlights — frozen snapshots of brilliance, blunders, and unforgettable plays I can revisit anytime.

# And finally, the wild heart of the page: animated wolves pacing along the bottom

Anchoring the whole scene are subtle but powerful animated wolves gliding gracefully along the bottom edge of the page. Their sleek, fluid movements add a primal energy — a reminder that beneath all the calm and ritual, there’s fierce strategy, instinct, and relentless drive. They are the silent guardians of this chess sanctuary, watching over every move with watchful eyes.

In sum, this homepage is more than just a UI for me. It’s a warm hearth of memories, a battleground of strategy, and a gallery of personal expression — where the magic of chess converges with the comfort of home. Every element is deliberately chosen, creating an immersive experience that fuels my passion and keeps me coming back for more.

If your chess site feels cold or uninspiring, I invite you to rethink how your digital chess world can reflect who you are — from the fonts you choose to the ambient animations that surround you. Because in the end, the best games start when you feel truly at home.

Part 3,"Evie lifted her hands to her eyes to block the sunlight that streamed in through the blinds. She hadn't been able to sleep more than a few hours as the horrific scene continued playing in her mind on repeat whenever she drifted off. She turned on her side and was met with the tan, pretty, smiling face of Maxine (Max) whose top bun had fallen to the side of her head through the night giving her curly hair a messy look. 

""Not that I don't enjoy sleepovers but do you maybe want to tell me why you insisted on sleeping in here with me now?"" Max asked jokingly. 

""Maybe after you brush your teeth."" Evie joked back pinching her nose. 

Max lifted her pillow and smacked Evie in the face before sitting up and stretching. 

Evie felt apprehensive. She usually shared everything with her roommates, however, even the police thought she was nuts or on something. As she calmed down and thought about it carefully most would think what she described was impossible. *Would Max be any different?* She thought to herself. 

""Are you planning on making up with Stella today?"" Max asked lifting herself from the bed. 

Evie sat up and pulled off her bonnet. ""That's not important right now... Listen, last night...after I left the club I witnessed something."" Evie began slowly. 

Max turned around and instantly became worried as Evie's expression was one of fear. The sound of the doorbell interrupted them as they listened to Stella and Ally answer the living room door. A few moments later Ally knocked on Max's door. Max opened it and Ally walked in with a concerned look on her face. Stella stood in the hallway with her arms folded looking smug. 

""Um, Evie...there's a couple of cops here that say they need to speak to you..."" Ally said softly. 

Evie quickly jumped from the bed and glanced at Max's digital clock. They had slept into the afternoon and it was 1:13 p.m. Evie sprinted to the living room and was greeted by an exhausted looking Officer Frank and a shapely female cop that identified herself as officer Mall. 

""Hey Ms. Walker. We came across some new evidence concerning the incident you reported last night...I was wondering if you'd be willing to come back down to the station for some additional questions and to provide a description of the individual you saw?"" Officer Frank asked humbly. 

""Oh God...you found her didn't you!"" Evie said shaking. 

""Evie, what's going on?"" Max and Ally asked in unison as Stella's smug expression turned into one of concern. 

""Do you mind coming back down to the station? We know it's last minute."" Officer Mall spoke gently. 

""Okay, um, please give me a few minutes to freshen up."" Evie replied turning towards the hallway. 

""Evie..."" Max spoke out in a worried tone. 

""We'll talk later...I promise."" Evie said heading to the bathroom. 

The police station was a lot calmer on Sunday afternoons compared to Saturday nights Evie observed as she sat nervously in a small room with a bland cup of coffee on the table. She had brushed her teeth, washed her face, and dressed quickly in a thick sweater, jeans and jacket. She had been there for over two hours and had been told she was free to leave anytime. A detective had asked her a lot of questions though they refused to answer any of hers. A second one went over her police report from before, picking over every detail and forcing her to reiterate her experience multiple times  

Her story stayed consistent though they seemed displeased with her description of ""the figure"" she saw kill the pink haired girl. Even so, they were sending in a sketch artist to draw what she saw. They still believed it was an individual in a suit and mask but Evie knew better. Those eyes...those yellow eyes, it's proportions and those nails... A young man caring a computerized sketch pad walked in, introduced himself and sat down across from Evie. He paused multiple times as Evie described what she saw but he continued sketching. It took a bit over an hour before he turned it around and Evie's heart rate increased immediately. A shiver went down her spine as she was instantly transported back to that street watching that thing tear into that poor girl's face. 

""Do you ever sleep?"" Evie asked Officer Frank as he weaved carefully through traffic towards her home. 

He laughed quietly, ""Yeah, I caught a few hours of shut-eye earlier... slept at the station."" He responded. 

""Oh, well that good."" 

They continued in conversation with Evie learning that Officer Frank's first name was Anton and he was a 4th generation police officer. Evie noticed how handsome he looked with his dark blue eyes, dark brown hair, straight pointy nose, and chisel jawline. He also had deep dimples and a great smile. They pulled up to her townhouse and noticed the front door ajar with a bit of grey smoke wisping into the air. Evie quickly jumped from the police car with Anton right behind her ready to call the fire department. She sprinted up the stairs and entered the open floorplan house to find Stella laughing, holding a blackened pan of cookies that had been reduced to charcoal, Max standing on a chair holding the fire alarm and Ally waving a towel by an open kitchen window. 

Evie let out a sigh of relief as Anton ran in concerned. 

""Is everything okay?!"" He asked looking around. 

""Yeah, just my roommate attempting to bake again. This isn't the first time."" Evie explained referring to Stella who looked embarrassed. 

""Sorry about that officer..."" Ally said turning away from the window. 

Ally suddenly yelped in pain as blood splattered across the kitchen wall and floor. She was abruptly lifted a few feet off of the floor as Stella dropped the burnt pan and screamed. Max turned to see Ally floating in thin air, kicking as a large wound formed under her ribcage. She stepped back in fear falling backwards off of the chair landing hard on the ground hitting her head, knocking herself unconscious. Evie screamed as the gangly figure looked pass Ally's now limp body straight at her with it's glowing yellow eyes. It's body was hidden somewhat by the smoke but it's gangly form was clear enough. It still looked as dark as it did that night...as dark as a shadow. It ripped through Ally's side exposing flesh, muscle and bone and flung her body towards the wall like a ragdoll. 

A cascade of bullets suddenly whooshed by Evie's ear causing them to ring from the loud noise. She covered them, screaming as Anton shot at the dark figure. He aimed for it's chest unloading bullets into it with precision. The dark figure jumped effortlessly onto the ceiling and scurried across it swiftly. Anton emptied his magazine shooting the figure in its back as it hurried across the ceiling. Even as he ran out of bullets he kept pulling the trigger as the figure crawled out of the open kitchen window disappearing into the darkness of the evening. Stella cried loudly in the corner holding her legs tightly to her chest. Blood formed around Max's head. Evie slowly removed her hands from her ears, her body shaking violently as she looked at Anton. He still held his gun out as his whole body trembled. His eyes looked wild and red, his lips had gone dry. 

""Did you see it?"" Evie struggled to speak.

""Yes. Yes, I f*cking saw it."" Anton responded finally lowering his gun as tears escaped his eyes.

His eyes looked wild and red, his lips had gone dry. 

""Did you see it?"" Evie struggled to speak.

""Yes. Yes, I f*cking saw it."" Anton responded finally lowering his gun as tears escaped his eyes.

There’s something deeply personal about the digital spaces we inhabit, especially when they reflect our passions and quirks in every pixel and animation. Today, I want to invite you inside my Lichess homepage — a fully customized sanctuary where the cold logic of chess melds seamlessly with warm, whimsical vibes.

This isn’t just a dashboard; it’s my cozy corner of the internet, built pixel by pixel to inspire, entertain, and keep me connected to the game I love.

# First thing you see: the ethereal northern lights dancing behind the UI

As soon as I load the page, I’m greeted by an animated northern lights aura gently undulating behind everything — subtle yet mesmerizing. It’s like having a glimpse of the arctic sky’s magical glow, grounding me with calm focus before a game. The shifting hues of green and purple create a living background, making the chessboard feel like the center of a vast, enchanted universe.

# Twin Peaks font — because style matters

Everywhere my username appears — from the homepage to the deepest corners of the site — it’s rendered in the iconic Twin Peaks font. The retro, eerie vibe of that font adds an unexpected cinematic flair to my identity, like I’m starring in my own chess mystery saga. It’s a small detail, but it’s like a secret handshake with those who notice, a signature that feels uniquely mine.

# The hearth of my homepage: a glowing fireplace with floating embers

No matter how tense the game, the warm glow of my animated fireplace offers a reassuring presence. Flickering flames crackle softly as tiny embers drift upwards — a dynamic, living element that brings the digital space to life. It’s the perfect reminder to stay calm and steady, like chess strategy unfolding in a quiet room with a fire burning nearby.

# My companions: a peacefully sleeping kitten and festive charm

Resting just beside the warmth of the fire is a static sleeping kitten, curled up on a soft pillow. There’s something deeply soothing about that image — a symbol of rest, patience, and quiet observation, virtues every chess player learns to cherish.

Nearby, three Christmas stockings hang quietly — nostalgic, static reminders of joy, tradition, and a little holiday magic that lingers all year round. Alongside these, you’ll find a cherry pie, a lit cigarette with an ashtray, and a steaming cup of coffee — all static but evocative, each telling its own story of comfort, indulgence, and ritual.

# Tools that keep my game sharp and my progress tracked

My homepage isn’t just about ambiance — it’s a powerful hub for my chess journey.

* The **KOTH Climber script shortcut** sits ready, a clickable gateway to tweak and visualize exactly where I stand on the King of the Hill rating slider. It’s an intuitive way to measure progress and plan the next move in my competitive climb.  The slider raises the climber up a digital mountain the higher the rating goes, with the peak being 2800+.
* The **Titled Players Radar Tracker** is another essential. One click opens a sleek display to log new games, keeping tabs on my battles with chess elites and sharpening my strategy against top-tier opponents.
* And because every great moment deserves to be saved, my **GIF folder** neatly stores a collection of favorite game highlights — frozen snapshots of brilliance, blunders, and unforgettable plays I can revisit anytime.

# And finally, the wild heart of the page: animated wolves pacing along the bottom

Anchoring the whole scene are subtle but powerful animated wolves gliding gracefully along the bottom edge of the page. Their sleek, fluid movements add a primal energy — a reminder that beneath all the calm and ritual, there’s fierce strategy, instinct, and relentless drive. They are the silent guardians of this chess sanctuary, watching over every move with watchful eyes.

In sum, this homepage is more than just a UI for me. It’s a warm hearth of memories, a battleground of strategy, and a gallery of personal expression — where the magic of chess converges with the comfort of home. Every element is deliberately chosen, creating an immersive experience that fuels my passion and keeps me coming back for more.

If your chess site feels cold or uninspiring, I invite you to rethink how your digital chess world can reflect who you are — from the fonts you choose to the ambient animations that surround you. Because in the end, the best games start when you feel truly at home.",0,1754912461.0,chess,0,0.5,False

1mnamqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1mnamqi/things_are_strange_right_now/,things are strange right now.,"we dated for two years, and during the last month of the relationship, all we did was bicker back and forth because we couldn’t communicate clearly. I realize a lot of it was me pushing her away because of abandonment issues, and I needed a lot of reassurance. She felt like she wasn’t able to focus on herself, as she’s pretty independent, and my anxiety pushed her away further. She broke up with me but said she loves and misses me, and one day who knows, maybe we can try again and we can be friends in the meantime.

Not too long ago, she invited me out for coffee. She ran up to me, gave me a big hug, kiss on the cheek, held my hand, told me I looked great, handed me a small gift, and she was proud I was working on myself. We talked for two hours and I just poured out how I felt. She said she still needs to focus on herself and can’t give anything romantically, I told her I understand. Before she left she said our love is strong enough to happen twice, and she looks forward to falling in love with me all over again.

I’m so confused and I don’t know what to do. I know obviously she has some feelings for me, but it’s leaving me stuck in this horrible feeling. I understand fearing a relationship getting too close, but if it’s scaring her to have to feel and connect in this level, it’s so much easier to just talk things out than leave. I think part of her regrets that.

If she’s done with me, that’s fine, I’ll move on. It’ll suck. I know deep down it would be easier to move on too. But relationships aren’t meant to be easy, and that’s what I want her to realize. Things will be rough or difficult sometimes, and talking it out can help explain how you feel.

I want to drop her stuff off today while she’s home but I dont know if it’s too much. I want to work on things but if she isn’t willing, I know I cannot convince her.",1,1754912427.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I don’t know you and you don’t know me. We’ve met a million times, we’ve looked into each others eyes, we’ve shared our bodies, but we don’t know each other. We’ve talked about the stars and the depths of the earth and everything in between, but we don’t know each other. I felt the honey kiss of your lips, I’ve felt you grab me in a way that lets me know to let go, I felt you move back and forth above me like the waves of the ocean, but we don’t know each other. I’ve smelled your hair as you’ve screamed with delight as you wrapped your arms around me, but we don’t know each other.

When I talk with her about the most mundane things, when I see her smile as she looks at me over a cup of coffee, when I see her beautiful eyes, I feel a pull against my soul dragging my thru space and time. When she trips and laughs at the silliest things, when she apologies for the simplest slights, when she sees a flower and smiles, I feel something turn inside of me that I can’t explain.

There’s a pull dragging me out of the life I’m in and into the life I belong. I resist it, I fight it, but I am weak against it. I love you, no I thought I did, what we had was not love. It was unbridled passion based on a proverbial form of shared checked boxes. With her it makes absolutely no sense, and that is the only reason I know that the love is true.

Constantly switching between tasks, checking notifications every 5 minutes, and wondering why my most important projects never got done. Here's what actually transformed how I work:

1. Deep work is a superpower, shallow work is quicksand

I started tracking my time and was horrified at how 80% of my day was spent on emails, meetings, and random tasks that felt urgent but weren't important. Now I block 3-4 hours daily for deep work on my most valuable projects. I now accomplish more in those focused hours than I used to in entire days.

2. Attention residue is killing your focus

Every time you switch tasks, part of your brain stays stuck on the previous task. I used to jump from writing to emails to Slack to research. Now I batch similar tasks and use transition rituals (like a 2-minute walk) between deep work sessions to fully reset my attention.

3. Create rituals, not just schedules

I built a specific deep work ritual: same coffee shop corner, noise-canceling headphones, phone in airplane mode, and a legal pad for capturing random thoughts. The consistency signals to my brain that it's time to focus. My brain now automatically shifts into deep work mode when I follow this routine.

4. Embrace productive meditation

During walks or mundane tasks like folding laundry, I practice productive meditation - focusing deeply on a single professional problem. No phone, no music, just pure thinking time. I've solved more complex problems during 20-minute walks than in hours of scattered desk time.

5. Quit social media (or at least tame it)

I deleted Instagram and Twitter from my phone and only check them from my laptop during designated times. The constant dopamine hits were training my brain to crave distraction. Now I can read for hours without feeling the urge to check my phone every few minutes.

6. Schedule every minute (but stay flexible)

I started time-blocking my entire day, not just work hours. Even leisure time gets blocked. This isn't about being rigid but about being intentional. When interruptions happen (and they will), I quickly adjust the remaining blocks. No minute goes unaccounted for.

7. Work like hell, then shut down completely

I created a shutdown ritual: review tomorrow's priorities, close all tabs, say ""schedule shutdown complete"" out loud. After this ritual, I don't check work emails or think about projects. This complete separation allows my brain to recharge and often leads to breakthrough insights the next day.

I stopped glorifying ""busy"" and started measuring my days by depth, not hours logged. One hour of deep work on my book project is worth more than six hours of shallow email responses.

My biggest mistake before was thinking I could multitask my way to productivity. The human brain doesn't multitask it task-switches, and every switch costs focus and energy.

Does anybody know a site where I can get this story for free?","""What... What is he?"" Emma stuttered badly. She was trembling like a leaf. The man in front of her wasn't human at all. He was a beast, a large black wolf. She has witnessed him shifting into a wolf form with her own eyes.

She was horrified out of her wits and dashed out from the woods only to be tackled to the ground minutes later when a hard strong body pounced on her from behind. She lost her footing and was falling but he was fast to change their positions and she landed on him as he bore contact with the rough ground.

Emma screamed and moved away taking a couple of steps away from him. In her haze of getting away from him, she didn't notice he was gone from his place. Her scared eyes looked around only to inhale in horror as she found his human form emerging from the trees. He was only wearing his pants that hung loose on his hips. His dark tattoos gave him a menacing look.

She didn't dare look away from his face. Xander's sharp enraged green eyes were enough to keep her a prisoner.

""W...What a...are.... y...you?"" She stuttered. The small twitch in his jaw was the only indication on his cold expressionless face, indicating how pissed off he was. He didn't want her to know the truth.

He didn't want her to know that he was a beast.

A sudden chilling breeze swept past her locks. The icy wind on her skin made the small hair on the nape of her neck stand.

He didn't respond.

Sheer ominous silence surrounded them. Lurking like evils ready to pounce with its vicious claws.

Yet she couldn't move. The burning in her body felt at ease just by looking into his dark eyes. His face looked dark, brooding yet handsome under the moonlight. Whereas her mind was screaming like a wounded animal for her to run for her life.

""You're in heat!"" His gruff baritone voice resonated around them. His words strained as if the mighty man was holding back, as if in pain.

The man in front of her wasn't a human. No, he was a creature. A werewolf.

Suddenly the reality of the situation dawned on her making her legs buckle up and within seconds the girl swiveled around running in the opposite direction with everything she got.

A ferocious growl from behind her had her heart stuttering and legs weakening in utmost trepidation. Yet she didn't stop.

She could practically feel him getting closer to her. Twigs and rusty leaves crushed under her bare feet drawing out blood, but she didn't care. She needed to get away from this man.

A shrill scream escaped her lips when her arm was taken in a harsh grip before her world turned upside down.

""NO! Let go!"" She cried out, struggling on his shoulder.

One savage growl from him had her insides shuddering in utmost terror and her body stiffened.

""I won't be gentle anymore!"" Xander snarled, animalistically.

# Chapter 1

The loud blaring of her alarm had her groaning out in annoyance as she groggily turned off the alarm.

The illuminating rays of the sun played hide and seek through the slit of the curtains caressing the nakedness of her bare arms.

With a light yawn, she flexed her arms before lazily sitting up and removing the alluring fluffy blanket. The idea of leaving this warm cozy bed was heart-wrenching but what else could she do?

With a nest of her hair, she walked into the restroom and did her business. After a quick shower, she felt fresh and ready to deal with the hectic day ahead.

Emma Belle Richardson. A 17-year-old girl or perhaps a nerd as per the sayings of her classmates.

Emma lived alone in her old apartment that her grandfather left her. The place wasn't amazing, but it was cozy enough to be called her home. Her room was not big but of average-sized, double bed placed in the middle, a small study table in the corner, a cupboard right beside it, on the other wall was a wide large window where a couch was placed, this window was her favorite place in the whole apartment. There was an attached bathroom which luckily consisted of a bathtub. The thing was old, but it worked well for her. A lounge sits right beside her room with an open kitchen to the left. A couch was placed in the lounge with a small table in the front. An old TV rested there in front of the couch. This was the total of her home.

She was 13 years old when her parents died. Her grandfather was the only family she had left. He took care of her, but God took him away from her when she was 16.

He died because of a heart attack. Since then, she has been left all alone in this big scary world. It was tough and still was. But Emma has coped with living alone. Though her apartment wasn't in a very good area, in fact, the opposite, she was thankful at least she had a roof over her head.

After tying her hair in a ponytail, she wore her knee-length skirt. Preparing a coffee for herself she did the buttons of her baggy shirt. She hurriedly drank her coffee, picked up her backpack, and within minutes she locked her apartment and was marching out at full speed.

The area where she lived was well known for its illegal activities and criminal records. And a young girl like her was nothing more than being a lamb in front of wolves.

When she was near the bus stop. She slowed her strides and panted because of that jog. Emma waited for ten minutes before her bus arrived and she hopped on it.

She sat in her usual seat third last in the back. As the vehicle started moving, the dread of what was to come in high school today started to roam her mind.

She was a good student, scratch that. She was on scholarship and one of the top kids in Horace Mann High School. For Emma scholarship was important as it was the only thing she could achieve because the fee structure of her school almost touched the sky. So, she had to work hard to maintain her scholarship and pursue her education with no one at her back as her guardian.

Though she was good at studies and always kept to herself. Trying to fade away in the crowd of people and never to be noticed but things didn't go as planned.

She was noticed. Her weight was noticed. And then it all started. Being bullied daily by this rich group of students who think so highly of themselves wasn’t on her list of plans.

She knew she was fat. That was why she wore baggy clothes. To hide away from their prying eyes. But no matter how much she tried; their eyes would always strip her naked. On one side they call her fat and whatnot and on the other side, those same guys would stare at her with bad intentions in their eyes and girls would always glare daggers her way.

For the past two years, she has become so conscious of herself. She even tried dieting but to no avail, as it only led her to the hospital, followed by sickness.

So, she tried the other way around. She started ignoring them, not responding to their harsh and cruel words. Their stupid pranks and ridiculous behaviors. But they never stopped. She was in her senior year now. Only this year in this hell and she'd be free.

With a sigh, she got off the bus and walked toward her destination. Her hands clenched into fists after noticing her enemies standing at the main entrance in a group.

For a second, she thought of going back but she was not a coward. The only reason she avoided them and bore their torture was that they were rich and could ruin her life with just one phone call because their parents had many shares in Horace Mann. And no one was at her back to save her or protect her. The wisest thing she could come up with was to ignore them.

But they always had other ways. Emma tried to walk past them. 'Please don't notice me.' Chanting this mantra in her head. Luck wasn't on her side.

A tall figure blocked her way, making her apply her brakes at a fast-paced speed and stumble a step back.

Emma closed her eyes before opening them again and stared at the guy named Jack but, in her head, she called him Jackass.

Without a word, Emma tried to walk past him, but he only grinned and blocked her way. It was entertainment for this Jackass, for her it was a waste of time and pure torture.

""Where do you think you're going, fatty?"" Jack mocked.

# Chapter 2

""Where do you think you're going, fatty?"" Jack mocked.

She didn't know why but their words always hurt her. Emma didn’t humor him and tried to walk past him again. His other friend named Landon aka Airhead blocked her way from the left. Emma named him airhead because he was tall and muscular but had no brain, he behaved exactly like what she named him.

""Not so fast, fatty."" Airhead smiled, making Emma cringe back at his behavior.

""I'm going to be late for my class."" She said confidently, she can endure to a certain limit only, and gladly they haven't done anything to extremes that could lead her to the edge.

""She talks!"" Hissed Veronica the goth witch. Emma named her based on the constant black lipstick on her lips. It looks horrific but God knows why she always donned it.

""Yes,"" Emma answered curtly. She bit her lip and clenched her jaw at her stupidity. She was being sarcastic to them, which simply means she was poking the bear with a red flag in her hands.

""Oh! She talked back to you, Veronica."" Jack put fire to Veronica's already heated sentiments.

Emma on the other hand believed that the reason for her being so confident and extra edgy was because her periods were coming near.

And this could get her killed by these mannerless people.

""I didn't,"" Emma said in a low voice. Not wanting to irritate the ticking bombs, because in no way she wanted to bathe in noodles and pasta which they threw at her a few months ago because she complained about their bullying to the authorities. That decision of hers led them to increase their torture and not only that, but the authorities also warned her instead of them and even her scholarship was in jeopardy.

""You didn't!"" Veronica spat before taking angry steps toward her. She was three inches taller than Emma whereas Emma was 5'4.

""Wanna hang out with us sometimes?"" Cane asked who was leaning against the wall.

""No, thank you,"" Emma said nicely and tried to walk past Veronica who intentionally tangled her foot with Emma's, who was taken off guard and fell on the floor with a thud.

A loud chortle was heard behind her. She immediately straightened her skirt which had hiked up a little because of the fall. Without looking back for once, with tears in her eyes she ran into the girls' restroom.

Getting inside one of the stalls. She harshly wiped her tears and glared at the floor for a complete three minutes. ""It's okay, Em, keep your calm."" She talked to herself.

She was all that she got. There was no one else to share her pain or burdens with. No soul on this planet loves her. It was just her all alone with her demons. But she was glad she had one person, her best friend.

""You're strong, ignore those bastards and bitches. They'll pay for this soon. You'll work hard and become successful. This would be the best slap on their faces."" She talked to herself in a hushed voice. Trying to console her mind. Trying to manipulate herself.

Even though she appeared normal and okay, only God knows what goes inside her soul every single night. Those vicious nightmares feasted on her soul, but she was breathing and still going, that was all that mattered.

With a heavy sigh, she got out of the stall and hurriedly washed her face to remove the traces of dirt.

With a heavy heart, she headed towards her first class which was about to start in a minute, and luckily as soon as she got inside, the teacher marched inside right after her.

""Take your seats, class."" Mrs. Arnold said and the whole class immediately settled down. Emma sat in her usual spot in the back right beside the window. Taking out her notebook she started taking notes.

Luckily no one from that gang of bullies was in this class. A little peace for her.

After three consecutive classes, it was finally recess. Time of fun for others but torture for her. One thing that scared her was the cafeteria. The incident of noodles and pasta being thrown on her head happened in that particular cafeteria, so after that incident, she avoided going there at all costs.

She found her sanctuary in Horace Mann. An empty classroom on the top floor where barely anyone goes. The class was filled with extra desks and chairs. No one goes there so she made it her sacred place to spend the time of her break.

Plopping down on one of the cleaned chairs, she whined in irritation. The reality of not bringing food today dawned on her, making her angry but in the next second, she recalled buying a packet of chips and biscuits which she placed in her bag. Opening the front zip, a beautiful smile adorned her face after finding the snacks. Looks like God hasn't forgotten her completely.

Emma ate her snacks while peeking out of the window. Strange that a few of her teachers along with the head of the authorities were standing near the parking lot and talking. She couldn't see her math teacher, Ms. Rebecca there and she wished from the bottom of her heart that Ms. Rebecca was absent.

Within two minutes the gates opened, and a sleek black Range Rover wheeled inside the gates. The glass of the windows was tinted black and in no way could she see who was in that car from up there.

The car stopped and the head of Horace Mann walked towards it followed by other teachers.

Munching on her chips she watched as the door opened and a man came out. The only thing she was able to notice was those mighty broad shoulders and black hair.

The man didn't even turn to face the head. He only nodded at the teachers before he was escorted inside by them.

Emma stared at that beautiful car for a complete minute, admiring its beauty before the bomb blasted into her mind. Next was her math class, the one she hated the most. The only subject that seemed impossible for her to understand. So many formulas, so many methods, and so many similarities.

She hates math!

# Chapter 3

She hates math!

After having her lunch, she checked the time and she only had two minutes before the hell class would start. Picking up her bag and throwing the empty packets in a bin she walked to the restroom, washed her hands, adjusted her clothes, and went to her class.

The reason why she delayed going to the class was that Veronica and Jack were in this class as well.

She went inside and within a second, Jack hooted and before Veronica could utter a word, the head of the school walked in, and everyone took their seats immediately.

In a hurry, Emma sat on the empty seat in the front rather than her usual seat at the back.

""Good afternoon, class. I'm here to inform you about the sudden absence of Ms. Rebecca. Last night she was met with an accident."" Gasps were heard all around and a wave of guilt washed over Emma who wished not to see Ms. Rebecca today.

""Her ribs got fractured and her left leg was broken. She's out of danger and currently in the hospital. It would take her a couple of months to a year or more to return to her duty."" Slight nods of understanding were seen.

""So, we have a substitute teacher who will take Ms. Rebecca's place. Let me introduce you to your new math teacher. Mr. Colt."" As soon as the head said these words.

A man walked inside the classroom with slow powerful steps.

It was as if all the breath was knocked out of her system.

The man in front of her could be any freaking thing but a teacher. He was probably 6'2 with massive shoulders, the outline of his taut muscles could be seen through his shirt. The bulging muscles of his biceps were one thing but the black ink on his neck and hands was another thing. Her eyes found their way to his Adam Apple and then his sharp jaw with a trimmed black beard giving him a rugged look. Pursed lips in a thin line, straight nose with a slight crook at the nose bone as if it was broken once, and then her breath hitched when her eyes met with his sharp green ones. He was staring straight at her. Closing her mouth shut, she abruptly dropped her gaze at her notes and her ears heated up in embarrassment. He caught her checking him out.

This was the same man from Range Rover.

And he was not old like other male teachers. He was very young, not in the lad's category more like in the men's category.

""I'll leave the class to you, Mr. Colt."" She heard the voice of their head before his footsteps faded away.

""First and foremost. I don't like disturbance."" His deep rich voice resonated in the class.

Emma dared to look around only to find everyone gawking at the man the same as she did before.

""Open your books."" He said loud enough for everyone to do as he said.

Mr. Colt strode towards the whiteboard and started solving a problem on it. The way his marker nip was hitting the board indicates how pissed off he was or perhaps he was this way only.

""Eyes on the board!"" His voice was a little high which got everyone to flinch in their seats as they immediately looked at the board rather than him.

Emma was tense as a wooden board during the whole class and so was the situation with everyone else.

The fact that she was sitting in the front wasn't helping at all. Once in a while, Mr. Colt's gaze would flicker to her, and she would get extremely nervous. Never in her life has she missed her back seat more than today. The lesson to never sit in the first row was clear for her.

As soon as the class ends. Emma was fast to leave the classroom.

She went straight to her next class, but her mind was still in her math class where she understood nothing but the man that was her teacher raked her mind throughout the next whole period.

As soon as the last bell rang. Emma sprinted out at a fast pace. When everyone goes back to their homes and rests, she has to earn her bread.

She was glad that Landon and his friends didn't appear in front of her after the morning incident.

Her eyes slowly darted towards the parking lot where that Range Rover stood out like a dominating Anaconda amongst small mice.

""I will buy you one day."" She promised with a soft smile on her face as she walked to the bus stop.

Within twenty minutes she entered the small cafe where she works. Jogging to the restroom she immediately wore her uniform, placing her bag in the locker. She came out of the restroom to find Connor standing with a grin on his face. ""Guess what?"" He was excited, it was written all over his face.

""What?"" She asked. ""I've got selected for my school's soccer team."" Connor grinned.

A wide smile appeared on her face, and she forwarded her hand for a handshake and congratulated him.

Connor shook her hand. ""Your birthday is in a week, so I'll give you a treat on your birthday,"" Connor suggested, making a beautiful smile appear on her face.

Connor was the only person she genuinely trusted. Her only friend or family. She respects him a lot. And he cares for her a lot.

""I'll be delighted."" She gave him her best pearly smile only to earn a flick smack of his finger on her forehead making her groan out in pain.

The audacity of Connor to laugh at her as he walked away to see the customers.

Emma ambled into the kitchen while rubbing her forehead where her colleague, Stacy stood.

""You're late Emma,"" Stacy said in a low voice so the owner couldn't hear her. ""I missed my first bus,"" Emma said in a low apologetic voice, making Stacy nod.

Stacy was kind of the only friend Emma had except Connor. It was not friendship because Stacy joined this job just a week ago but up till now, both girls are good and kind to each other.

# Chapter 4

Emma was the kind of person who never trusted someone easily. She never warms up to anyone just after a few meetings. Connor was the only person in this world whom she trusted. The invisible walls around her were high and strong. She didn't socialize, so almost all the time she kept to herself which led her to talk to herself.

Work was hectic today as it was Monday evening. Customers kept rolling in and the time flew in a blink. It was late at night when her shift ended. Stacy has already left.

Connor locked the door as they both strolled down their path. Connor has been working here since before her. He was the one who got her job here. He has been her friend since she was 14. She always considered him as an elder brother who looked after his sister. He was 20 now.

Many times, he offered to sell her apartment and buy one near his house as her area wasn't safe, but she never wanted to sell the only thing that was left of her family, so she declined his offer.

But he was so worried for her all the time that every night after her shift ended, he would walk her to her apartment. Connor was the one who suggested to her the idea of dressing like a boy while walking back home after work because, at night, it wasn't safe for a girl to walk alone or with a man on the streets of her place.

Emma wore a big hoodie that Connor gave her on her last birthday. Her hair was hidden and the cap she wore hid most of her face. The cloth wrapped around her chest was the thing she hated most. She couldn’t even breathe. She was fat as per her bullies. Her busts were big so to appear like a boy she had to wrap her chest in a cloth and breathe like a dying cat.

They quietly walked past the group of thugs who were drinking near their bikes, and they didn't pay attention to her and Connor. Once Emma was in front of her apartment, she turned to thank him. ""Thank you, but you don't have to do this every day,"" she said softly, feeling like a burden.

Connor smiled before he smacked her forehead playfully with the flick of his stone-like finger. Emma let out a wince of pain and rubbed her forehead while glaring at him who was taller than her.

""Shut up, Emma,"" he said with a roll of his eyes. ""You hit my forehead again and I... I... will not make a sponge cake, ever!"" She threatened and Connor's jaw slacked.

""Don't you dare! I can't live without your homemade sponge cake!"" Connor said with fake heartbreak.

""Then don't hit me!"" Emma muttered, making him chuckle. ""Fine."" He smiled before ruffling her cap as he motioned her to go in.

With a soft smile and a nod, she sauntered inside and closed her door after a small wave. Once she locked the door, she heard his footsteps fading away.

Emma walked to her room and immediately removed her hoodie followed by the cloth wrapped around her chest. As soon as it was off, she took a deep breath and wore her hoodie back.

Freedom!

The perks of living alone are that she could wear anything or nothing at all. It was comfortable.

Going into the restroom she freshened herself and walked into the kitchen to make dinner. It was extremely late at night, so she ended up with a sandwich. After eating it, she checked the lock of her door again and padded into her room. Flopping herself down on the bed she let out a heavy sigh.

It was a hectic day. One down and a lot more days to go.

Emma was sitting in the library doing her pending assignment in her free time. After that, she took out her notebook and started writing the groceries and stuff that was needed in the house as the month had ended.

She made the list and then mentioned the price of each and everything. A smile appeared on her face when the total money was under her budget and still some amount of money was left which she could keep as her savings.

After finishing up her work she left the library. All the students were in the corridor going towards their respective classes.

Her mind was completely drowned in the fact that when she could buy the groceries. Sunday was still six days away and she didn't have much time during the weekdays due to studies and work.

A yelp escaped her lips when her body collided with a hard wall. For a second her brain stopped working and her body was falling back.

A rough hold on her arm and a harsh yanking of her body had a scream leaving her lips. Her body yet again collided with a wall.

She didn't dare open her eyes. The hold on her arm became rough, making her wince and her eyes shot open. The first thing that came to her line of vision was a wolf. Not a wolf exactly but a steel pendant of a viciously growling wolf.

In a millisecond her eyes shot up and widened to the size of saucers when they met with the green forest eyes.

Her breath hitched and a chill ran down her spine. She abruptly moved two steps back. Staring at Mr. Colt with terror-filled eyes.

""I... I'm sorry."" She stuttered badly, her voice a mere whisper. Not being able to look in his dark intense eyes she looked down at the floor.

She was scared of him. Who wouldn't be scared of a dangerous-looking large man like him?

""Look where you're going."" He said coldly, making her gulp.

She raised her eyes to give him an apologetic explanation, but his cold expressionless face and those piercing eyes were enough to make her shut her mouth.

Without further words, he walked past her making her gulp. Once he was gone, she realized what truly happened.

Emma picked up her bag from the floor and looked around to find a couple of eyes set dead on her.

""This nerd is so lucky that she felt him up."" One of the girls standing near the lockers sneered.

Emma's heart dropped into the deepest hollow of disgust at their words.

# Chapter 5

""You did an excellent job, Emma."" Her Science teacher, Ms. Alicia said with a smile on her face as she went through Emma's assignment.

""Thank you,"" she said happily, making her nod as she placed her assignment aside.

""You can leave now, dear."" Ms. Alicia said, making Emma nod as she left her office.

She barely took a few steps when she stopped dead in her tracks hearing a low growl from the room right beside her.

""I'm hating this f\*\*king shit!"" Someone growled, making her jump in her place as she gaped at the door. Her eyes read the nameplate and she gulped reading Mr. Colt written in bold italic letters.

""I'll rip your throat apart; the first thing I see you!"" He growled dangerously and Emma stood frozen at her place.

Did he just threaten to kill someone?

Before she could make a move to leave or run. The door of his office burst open and out came none other than Mr. Colt.

His eyes landed on her small frozen frame. ""What are you doing here Ms. Richardson?"" Came his rich, thick voice.

Emma's heart stopped beating in dread. The dread of him knowing her name. Which simply meant he noticed her, the thing which she didn't want.

She was tongue-tied. Like a deer caught in headlights. She was so stunned and scared because of her crime of eavesdropping that nothing came to her head as an excuse for her safety.

""N-n-nothing."" She stuttered and took a fleeting step back.

His hawk-like eyes narrowed at her feet, making it clear to her that he noticed her chicken movement. He raised his eyes and she abruptly looked away.

His eyes!

The dark forest green with the hues of hazel in it scared the life out of her every time he looked at her.

""I hate liars!"" His voice was gruff with a hint of amusement.

Emma took another step back, not meeting his gaze. There was something about him that oozed out power, respect, and dominance. His mere form reeks of intimidation. This man could be easily considered a warrior or a beast, a fighter rather than a professor.

""I was just passing."" She muttered slowly. Finally, she was able to feel her legs again. Emma turned around and dashed out of there at full speed.

With her heart beating wildly she stepped in the restroom and breathed heavily. Staring at her face in the mirror she splashed water on her face twice before staring at the mirror.

Her eyes were wide and her face pale. If anyone saw her right now, they would think she witnessed a ghost when it was her teacher.

The rest of the day went smoothly.

Connor was kind enough to help her buy all the things during the half-hour break from work.

Emma lay on her bed and eventually, the events of the day started raking her mind.

Xander Colt!

That man gave out scary vibes. Even though she barely knew him, his eyes peered at her as if he could see her soul.

And now he knows her name as well. Excellent going, Emma! The more she tried to stay under the radar, away from all the attention the more she attracted it.

With determination to avoid him at all costs, she welcomed sleep with open arms.

The next day was fine with no bullies waiting for her, luckily. The first three classes went with ease, and it was recess. Emma went to her sacred classroom on the top floor. She brought a chicken sandwich for herself today.

Munching on her food she hummed a tune of her own as she walked to the window. Sitting near it she gazed out. Her eyes immediately landed on that black Range Rover, like a magnet but what got her attention were the strong muscular shoulders.

She moved forward to have a better look. He was leaning against his car while talking on the phone.

She took a large bite of her sandwich, both cheeks full and at that same moment Mr. Colt looked up straight at her.

Their eyes locked!

Her breath hitched and she froze. Her eyes widened to the size of saucers and her mouth stopped chewing her food. With both cheeks full she gaped at him like a fish out of water.

His gaze was unswervingly set on her. She was so freaking away from him, yet he felt her gaze. It was impossible or perhaps his sixth sense is very strong.

She gulped the food without chewing on it and it got stuck in her food pipe making her cough out hysterically as she moved back from the window while lightly punching her chest. She hurriedly drank water from her water bottle and finally, she could breathe.

The coldness of her hands and the numbness of her feet were beyond her understanding. First of all, he looked and behaved nothing like a teacher. Second of all he cusses and threatens people on the phone.

Weird!

""Oh, Lord!"" She facepalmed herself knowing fully well that the next class was math which meant she had to face him.

Lord, show mercy!

Packing up her bag. She walked down the stairs making sure that no one watched her because if her sacred place got out, Landon, Jack, and Veronica would make her life a lot more like hell.

Walking into the classroom, she quietly sat at the back, in her signature seat near the window.

There were still five minutes left till the class started. Emma took out her notes and checked the last problems that Mr. Colt solved on board. She did understand it slightly but what happened in the last two steps went from above her head.

She was so engrossed in the math problem that she didn't realize when the door opened, and he walked in.

""Settle down, class."" His deep voice had her head shooting up and there he stood in his black dress pants and black button-up shirt hiding his dark tattoos behind.

His eyes fell on the front row, and she immediately tried to appear smaller in her seat but alas, he noticed.

""Ms. Richardson, come here and sit in the front.""

# Chapter 6

""Ms. Richardson, come here and sit in the front.""

Pin drop silence, all sets of eyes were dead set on her, and once again she was the center of attention.

Standing quietly with slumped shoulders, she gathered her stuff and walked to the front row. Then, calmly, she sat down on one of the empty seats.

She didn't dare look up because she was one hundred percent sure Mr. Colt was watching her.

""Close all your books and notes."" He said curtly.

""I'm giving you a surprise test."" He announced and everyone's jaw dropped in shock.

He handed a bunch of papers to the first student and motioned him to pass them in all rows.

He just taught four classes and today a surprise test? What stupid sorcery was that?

Emma stared at the problem printed on the paper. Sweat broke on her forehead as she realized it was yesterday's problem.

He's checking who paid attention to his lecture and who didn't. Though she paid attention, God knows math always went above her head.

She slowly took out her pen and started solving the question at an absolute snail's pace. From her peripheral vision, she saw Mr. Colt checking all the students as they did their work.

1mnahcx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskOldPeopleAdvice/comments/1mnahcx/f23_troubled_with_my_grandparents_behavior_and/,F23 troubled with my grandparents' behavior and not sure how to handle it.,"Hi all, I'm F23 and my grandparents are 78 and 77. They never had any physical/mental problems or illnesses, they are doing pretty great for their age, but you know, as we getting older it won't be getting any easier. I wouldn't say they're ""losing it"", but something's going on. They have definitely started acting weird which makes me feel very uncomfortable. I don't know how to navigate this, whether I should just look past it cuz they're getting old and I shouldn't take anything they say at face value, or whether this is genuinely how they feel about us. We always had an excellent relationship, they raised us, we all lived together, we were always very close as a family. I dont know what's happened now...

My grandpa enters every room nearly outraged every time. Provocative ironic tone, ready to make a comment that will strike a nerve, trigger and get a reaction out of us. Maybe they don't talk enough with grandma and are trying to find sources of entertainment to pass their time, honestly I dont know. We could be busy drowning with work and he'll start talking about things to provoke my dad like how he feels his sons are a failure, argumentative tone over inheritance stuff, money, very fake performative interest as in ""i bring y'all coffee every morning"" and will say it out so loud to boast and prove a point that he cares. The stuff he says though, is so specific and so well-pointed to get to you, that it can't be him talking nonsense. He doesnt have Alzheimer's or dementia. Is it true that with age they just show how they really feel about you and blame it on ""old age""?

Grandma same thing, even though she has started talking nonsense lately and having those pauses, blank stares at the wall and flashbacks repeating the same things ... but it's not extreme, she is able to snap back to normal. Yet she makes such oddly specific ""mildly"" infuriating comments about my parents, me, life situation, character, that just ""slips"" and reveals how she really views us and feels about us... I don't know if it's just me overthinking it, maybe i shouldnt even look that much into it but it's such strange behavior... They were never like this... They throw hints, imply stuff, laugh in irony, almost like we aren't family... I feel so strange and uncomfortable being around them... I dont know whether they're tired of us and want us gone or what their issue is... They appear so edgy, irritable, passive aggressive and spiteful all the time,  it feels like chronic piled up resentment that only comes to the surface now...

I don't want to be a piece of shit and respond to them in an ugly way, they are my family and it breaks my heart that our relations are becoming more troubled as they grow older. But I can't tolerate receiving phone calls to be told off or coming to my workplace to see me and argue with me or saying stuff to trigger me to get their daily dose of entertainment and then leave... Im trying to be empathetic and understanding, I don't want to have guilty conscience that I was mistreating/ignoring them when they got old, but this whole feeling of alienation is truly messing me up... Interacting with them ruins my day. Im very attached to my family and things like this affect me deeply... But I don't know what to do. Any insights?",3,1754911960.0,AskOldPeopleAdvice,5,1.0,False

[CMI Elevates Steel to Critical Status for Decarbonization](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/critical-minerals-2025-steel-supply-security/)

https://preview.redd.it/aq2635kdhdif1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=44dec28e9229639176da7529fe49d65e460a824c

# What Are Critical Minerals and Why Do They Matter?

Critical minerals form the backbone of modern economies, powering everything from smartphones to defense systems. These essential materials face significant supply risks while being vital for economic and national security. As global competition intensifies, nations are racing to secure reliable access to these resources through various policy approaches and strategic partnerships.

The Critical Minerals Institute (CMI) maintains one of the most comprehensive critical mineral watchlists globally, integrating data from 12 different national frameworks and detailed trade flow analysis to identify materials facing the highest supply risks.

As Jack Lifton of CMI noted, ""the nineteenth-century steel age never ended—it has simply morphed into a high-stakes age of critical minerals,"" highlighting how these resources have become central to geopolitical competition and industrial policy.

# The Evolution of Critical Mineral Classifications

Critical mineral classifications have evolved dramatically in recent years, expanding beyond the initial focus on rare earth elements to encompass dozens of materials crucial to energy transition, defense applications, and advanced manufacturing.

What began as concerns over a handful of materials has grown into comprehensive frameworks that assess not just geological scarcity but also processing bottlenecks, market concentration, and geopolitical vulnerabilities. This evolution reflects the growing recognition that supply chain security extends beyond mining capacity to include refining, processing, and manufacturing capabilities.

The methodologies for determining ""criticality"" have become increasingly sophisticated, with most frameworks now incorporating both economic importance and supply risk in their assessments. This dual approach helps policymakers prioritize strategic initiatives and investment decisions across diverse mineral resources.

# Steel's Surprising New Classification

In a significant development that has surprised many industry observers, steel has been added to the CMI's 2025 Critical Minerals Watchlist, expanding the list to 24 materials. This addition reflects growing recognition that even seemingly abundant materials can face strategic supply constraints when demand surges or geopolitical tensions rise.

The CMI's decision signals that ""supply risk now extends to the very backbone of every decarbonization project on the planet,"" highlighting steel's unique blend of strength, formability, and durability that makes it ""the workhorse of modern industry.""

This classification challenges conventional thinking about what constitutes a ""critical"" mineral, moving beyond simple geological scarcity to consider complex supply chain vulnerabilities and [critical minerals energy security](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/critical-minerals-energy-transition-2025-energy-security/).

# The Foundation of Decarbonization Infrastructure

Steel's elevation to critical status stems from its foundational role in virtually every decarbonization project worldwide. From wind turbines to electric vehicle manufacturing facilities, steel provides the structural backbone for the energy transition.

A single 3-megawatt wind turbine requires approximately 335 tons of steel, highlighting the material's outsized importance in renewable energy infrastructure. This requirement multiplied across thousands of planned turbines creates enormous demand pressure that could strain even global steel production capacity.

Solar installations, grid infrastructure, and hydrogen facilities similarly depend on specialized steel grades, creating potential bottlenecks in multiple clean energy sectors simultaneously if supply chains become constrained.

# Supply Concentration Concerns

Despite steel's global production footprint, supply concentration among a few Asian producers has raised strategic concerns. Specialized steel grades essential for high-performance applications face particular supply chain vulnerabilities.

Advanced high-strength steels, corrosion-resistant alloys, and electrical steels used in motors and transformers represent particular areas of concern. These specialized products often rely on sophisticated manufacturing processes controlled by a limited number of producers, creating potential chokepoints in critical supply chains.

As infrastructure projects accelerate globally, these potential bottlenecks in high-quality steel production could impact everything from renewable energy deployment to defense applications, making steel's critical designation increasingly justified.

# China's Export Volatility Creates Market Uncertainty

Recent data reveals significant volatility in China's critical mineral exports. In July 2025, rare earth exports fell 23% month-on-month to 5,994 tonnes, despite Beijing's agreements with Washington and Brussels to ease the export licensing regime implemented in April.

This volatility demonstrates how policy decisions in dominant producer countries can rapidly disrupt global supply chains. While year-to-date exports remain up 13% overall, the monthly fluctuations create significant planning challenges for manufacturers.

The full product breakdown, expected on August 20, will provide crucial insight into whether high-value magnet materials or lower-value products dominated these shipments. This distinction matters enormously for industries dependent on specific rare earth elements rather than the broader category.

# Europe's Push for Supply Chain Independence

Europe is taking concrete steps to reduce dependence on China for critical minerals. Solvay's La Rochelle plant in France—described as ""still the only site outside China capable of separating all seventeen rare-earth elements""—has begun a €20 million expansion to pivot from autocatalyst feed to high-purity magnet metals.

The facility aims to meet 30% of Europe's rare earth demand by 2030 through recycling and new feedstock from allied nations including Brazil, Canada, and Australia. This initiative directly supports the EU's Critical Raw Materials Act, which targets greater domestic processing capacity through the development of an [European CRM facility](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/critical-raw-materials-crm-facility-2025-european-supply/).

This significant investment demonstrates Europe's commitment to developing sovereign capabilities across the full rare earth value chain, from separation to magnet manufacturing, reducing vulnerability to supply disruptions from dominant producers.

# U.S. Strategic Partnerships Reshape Global Trade Flows

The United States is leveraging both government policy and corporate partnerships to secure critical mineral supply. A revealing example comes from South Africa, where President Cyril Ramaphosa offered the Rainbow Rare Earths Phalaborwa project to the U.S. in 2019, hoping to gain American backing for a non-Chinese source of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr).

Since then, the project has attracted a $50 million investment from the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation through TechMet. The project is now positioned to benefit from a July agreement in which the U.S. Department of Defense guaranteed MP Materials a ten-year minimum price of $110 per kilogram for NdPr—nearly double the current spot price.

This combination of financial support and price guarantees illustrates the multi-faceted approach the U.S. is taking to secure critical mineral supply chains, using both development finance and [defense-critical materials strategy](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/defense-critical-materials-australia-strategy-2025/) to reshape global investment flows.

# The Emergence of Sovereign Price Floors

Government price guarantees are emerging as a powerful tool to stimulate critical mineral production. The U.S. Department of Defense's agreement with MP Materials, guaranteeing $110/kg for NdPr over ten years, represents a significant shift toward direct market intervention.

Australia is following suit, with officials ""actively considering"" a rare earth price-floor mechanism backed by an A$1.2 billion strategic reserve plan. Even the hint of sovereign support lifted shares of Australian rare earth companies significantly, with Lynas Rare Earths reaching a thirteen-year high while Iluka Resources and Arafura Rare Earths jumped approximately 10%.

This ""contagious"" precedent suggests a fundamental shift in how governments approach critical mineral security, moving from traditional subsidies and trade policy toward direct price intervention to stimulate production outside dominant supplier countries.

# The Economic Impact of Price Guarantees

Price guarantees fundamentally alter project economics by reducing investment risk. Projects that might be unviable under volatile market conditions become attractive when minimum prices are assured. This approach could accelerate development timelines for critical mineral projects globally.

The ripple effects extend to capital markets, where mining companies with exposure to price-guaranteed minerals have seen significant valuation increases. This trend suggests investors are placing a premium on projects with reduced market risk through government backing.

For project developers, these guarantees transform the economic calculus around capacity expansion and processing investments. Long-term contracts at premium prices allow companies to secure financing for projects that might otherwise struggle to attract capital in volatile commodity markets.

# Brazil's Strategic Minerals Sovereignty Push

Resource nationalism is intensifying globally. Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva recently declared strategic minerals a matter of ""national sovereignty,"" vowing to end the export of raw ores without domestic value-addition and to comprehensively map the nation's geological resources.

This policy shift comes amid 50% U.S. tariffs on Brazilian imports and illustrates how governments are increasingly linking minerals policy to broader foreign policy objectives. Brazil's approach reflects a growing trend of resource-rich nations seeking to capture more value from their mineral wealth.

The creation of a new minerals council charged with developing the country's resources for maximum domestic benefit signals a systematic approach to resource nationalism that goes beyond traditional export taxes or restrictions.

# The DRC's Cobalt Export Suspension

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has extended its cobalt export suspension, originally implemented in February when prices hit nine-year lows. This decision by the world's largest cobalt supplier demonstrates how producing countries can leverage their market position to influence global prices.

Mining giant Glencore warned that much of its cobalt output could remain unsold through 2025 due to the ban. Despite stockpiling every pound produced since February, Glencore's first-half output rose 19% to 18,900 tonnes. The company's reassurance that ""zero sales would not dent profits illustrates the distorted economics that emerge when a single country controlling seventy percent of global supply turns off the spigot.""

This market power highlights the challenges faced by industries dependent on cobalt, particularly battery manufacturers, and underscores why diversification of supply and development of alternative technologies have become strategic priorities for many nations and corporations.



Nuclear Revival Drives Uranium Market

Nuclear energy is experiencing a resurgence in the United States, with potential to add seven gigawatts of capacity by 2030—approximately a 7% increase—primarily through restarting shuttered plants and upgrading existing reactors.

**Several major projects are underway:**

* Holtec International is on track to revive the 800 MW Palisades plant this year
* Constellation Energy is preparing to bring Three Mile Island Unit 1 back by 2027 under a long-term clean-power deal with Microsoft
* NextEra Energy may restart Iowa's Duane Arnold station

This revival is creating significant new demand for uranium, reactor components, and specialized materials at a time when global [uranium market dynamics](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/uranium-market-volatility-supply-demand-2025/) are already strained by geopolitical tensions and underinvestment.

# Rebuilding the Nuclear Fuel Cycle

The nuclear revival extends to fuel production. General Matter signed a $1.5 billion lease with the Department of Energy to build an enrichment plant at Paducah, Kentucky, reusing 7,600 cylinders of depleted UF₆ as feedstock and reducing reliance on Russian imports before waivers expire in 2028.

This investment reflects growing recognition of uranium's critical status and the strategic importance of domestic fuel cycle capabilities. As nuclear power expands globally, securing the entire supply chain from mining to enrichment has become a national security priority.

The focus on reprocessing existing depleted uranium highlights the complex interplay between resource efficiency, energy security, and strategic material management that characterizes modern approaches to critical minerals.

# Pentagon Investment in Niobium and Scandium

# The U.S. Department of Defense is directing capital toward less familiar but strategically important metals. Elk Creek Resources, a unit of NioCorp Developments Ltd., secured up to $10 million under the Defense Production Act to advance its Nebraska project rich in niobium, scandium, titanium, and rare earths.

# By implementing design improvements, including scrapping a costly acid plant and installing an electric underground rail system, NioCorp has reduced project capital requirements by approximately $300 million. The company has secured binding off-take agreements for 75% of planned niobium production and twelve tonnes of scandium annually, with discussions underway with Stellantis for rare earth supply.

# This investment highlights how defense requirements are driving attention to specialized metals that enable high-performance applications in aerospace, armor, and electronics—materials that might otherwise struggle to attract sufficient investment based on commercial markets alone.

# Molybdenum's Rising Profile

Molybdenum's addition to the CMI Critical Minerals Watchlist highlights its growing strategic importance. This versatile metal plays a crucial role in strengthening steel alloys, particularly for high-temperature applications in aerospace, defense, and energy infrastructure.

Beyond steel applications, molybdenum is increasingly important in semiconductor manufacturing and catalysts. As advanced manufacturing expands globally, securing reliable molybdenum supply has become a priority for both governments and industry.

Molybdenum's dual role in both traditional industrial applications and advanced technologies makes it particularly interesting as a bridge between conventional mineral markets and the high-tech materials driving the energy transition and digital transformation.

# The Acceleration of Strategic Alliances

The critical minerals landscape is increasingly shaped by strategic alliances rather than purely market forces. From General Motors' agreement with Noveon Magnetics for rare earth magnets to international partnerships between resource-rich nations and technology leaders, securing supply chains through direct relationships is becoming the norm.

These alliances often span multiple countries and involve both public and private entities. The model represents a fundamental shift away from reliance on spot markets toward long-term, relationship-based supply arrangements backed by government support.

This transition is occurring against a backdrop of changing consumer preferences, as evidenced by GM's allocation of ""nearly $900 million to a new V-8 engine plant"" amid first-half U.S. electric-vehicle sales that gained ""just a 1.5 percent"" while global sales ""jumped twenty-eight percent."" These divergent trends highlight how regional variations in adoption rates affect critical mineral demand patterns.

# The Integration of Industrial and Foreign Policy

Critical minerals have moved from technical supply chain concerns to central foreign policy considerations. Nations are increasingly using access to these materials as leverage in broader geopolitical negotiations, while simultaneously developing domestic capabilities to reduce vulnerabilities.

This integration of industrial and foreign policy represents a significant shift in how governments approach resource security. Critical minerals are no longer merely economic inputs but strategic assets that influence international relations and national security planning.

As one industry observer noted, ""Market forces alone no longer set the pace—industrial policy and strategic alliances increasingly dictate who controls tomorrow's supply,"" highlighting the profound transformation underway in global material supply chains and the impact of the [Trump executive order on minerals](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/trump-executive-order-critical-minerals-2025/).

# Evaluating Government Support Mechanisms

For investors, government support mechanisms have become crucial factors in evaluating critical mineral projects. Price guarantees, direct investments, and strategic partnerships can fundamentally alter project economics and reduce market risks.

Projects with government backing—whether through Defense Production Act funding, price floors, or strategic partnerships—may offer more stable returns despite potentially higher initial valuations. Investors should carefully assess the nature and durability of government support when evaluating opportunities.

This assessment should include understanding not just the headline numbers but the specific terms, conditions, and timeframes associated with government support. Projects with guaranteed offtake at fixed prices present fundamentally different risk profiles than those exposed to spot market volatility.

# Identifying Supply Chain Positioning

A company's position within critical mineral supply chains significantly impacts its strategic value. Firms that control bottleneck processes—such as separation and processing—often command premium valuations compared to pure mining operations.

Investors should evaluate not just resource quality and quantity but also a company's ability to provide the specific forms of materials needed by end-users. Companies that can deliver processed materials ready for manufacturing applications typically enjoy stronger market positions than those selling unprocessed ores.

The most valuable positions in many critical mineral supply chains are often in the ""middle"" segments—the processing, refining, and specialized manufacturing steps that transform raw materials into high-value inputs for technology products. Companies that can successfully bridge these gaps may represent particularly attractive investment opportunities.

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

[Here’s the side-by-side valuation gap chart for the top 10 North American rare earth and critical mineral projects — you can clearly see how undervalued NioCorp is relative to peers with far narrower mineral portfolios.](https://preview.redd.it/cz720ct8jdif1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=de2d85a77d446508d16dee6cb59c342f75101fb1)

  
**\*\*\*\*The bottom Line & for consideration...**

NioCorp’s **Elk Creek Project** is uniquely positioned to become the **flagship U.S. source for multiple critical minerals** — niobium, scandium, titanium, and a full spectrum of rare earths — all from a single, fully permitted site in Nebraska. Unlike MP Materials, which is essentially a rare-earth pure play, NioCorp offers a **multi-commodity portfolio** that addresses defense, aerospace, clean energy, and industrial sectors simultaneously. Its output would be entirely **DFARS-compliant**, free from foreign ownership, and strategically aligned with U.S. and allied supply chain security goals. With ongoing infill drilling (completing August 2025 \~ **per Mark Smith**) [NioCorp Can Make America the “Saudi Arabia of Scandium,” CEO Mark Smith Tells Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo | NioCorp Developments Ltd.](https://www.niocorp.com/niocorp-can-make-america-the-saudi-arabia-of-scandium-ceo-mark-smith-tells-fox-business-maria-bartiromo/) likely to boost reserves, and a DFS due late 2025, the company is on the verge of proving it can scale far beyond current projections.

**\*\*\*\*\*Despite this broad strategic scope, NioCorp’s market cap (\~$260M) is barely 2% of MP’s \~$13B valuation — a 50× gap that does not reflect the project’s scope, permitting status, or U.S. government relevance. This undervaluation is amplified by Elk Creek’s ability to produce multiple revenue streams from one operation, positioning it as a resilient supply hub at a time when the U.S. is seeking to end its reliance on Chinese and transitional supply chains. The combination of near-term federal funding eligibility, active discussions with defense and industrial buyers, and imminent technical milestones creates the conditions for a major valuation re-rating once financing is secured.\*\*\*\*\*\***

***\*\*""If ""\~\****\*NioCorp executes on its current trajectory — breaking ground in 2026 and commencing production by 2028 — Elk Creek could quickly move from a development story to a **cornerstone of U.S. industrial independence**. Its role would extend beyond supplying materials; it would anchor a new domestic model for vertically integrated, multi-mineral production that is essential for hypersonics, EVs, SMRs, permanent magnets, and advanced alloys. In short, **NioCorp is undervalued today because the market hasn’t yet priced in the inevitability of its strategic necessity** — but that window may close rapidly as milestones are met.

**Bottom Line:**  
*\*\*\*\*\*\*“For a fraction of MP’s valuation, NioCorp is poised to deliver disproportionate strategic value. Elk Creek isn’t just another mine — it’s a multi-commodity critical mineral hub, aligned with federal defense & clean-energy mandates, fully U.S.-based and increasingly visible. If the 2025 DFS validates the expanded reserve model, investors could be looking at a* ***flagship valuation re-rating*** *— and Elk Creek becoming indispensable to American industrial independence.”*

I live in El Raval and I have an official rental contract for my apartment. Today, two men came to my door wearing dark navy/black work clothes but with no company logo or something, They had a ladder with them.

They said my landlord is scamming me, cut off my water and electricity, then turned it back on again. Before leaving, they said that if they come back another time, they want a coffee. I called the police and while I was waiting someone covered/ looked throw my peephole on the door, so i covered it real quick.

1mnadip,https://i.redd.it/ix4rkeh2ldif1.png,"Tangled in Lies, Bound by Lust. Does anyone know where I can find a free link for this story to read online?","My heart plummets.

My fists clench at my sides, nails biting into my palms as I stare, frozen, at the scene before me.

The room reeks of sweat and sex, I can’t help but tremble.

And there he is.

Dmitri.

My fiancé.

The man I was supposed to marry.

Groveling at my feet, tangled in his own damn pants as he fumbles to cover himself. His face is pale, his hair disheveled, his lips—those same lips that whispered loving words into my ears—swollen from kissing someone else.

A woman—a stranger—lays half-naked on the bed behind him, the silk sheets tangled around her body as she scrambles away like a cornered animal. Her eyes dart to mine in wide-eyed panic before she clutches the blanket to her chest and bolts toward the bathroom, slamming the door shut.

Coward.

Dmitri stares up at me, panic laced in his voice. ""Elena—it's not what it looks like.""

A hollow laugh escapes me. Cold. Emotionless. Clearly the laugh of a woman who has lost everything.

I take a step closer, my heels clicking against the polished hardwood floor. I feel detached from my own body, as if I'm watching this play out from somewhere far, far away.

""Not what it looks like?"" I repeat softly, tilting my head.

Dmitri, the man who once promised me forever, dares to feed me that cliché excuse.

A lump lodges in my throat, burning like acid.

""Dmitri,"" my voice is eerily calm, my hands trembling with suppressed rage, ""I just buried my father.""

His eyes flicker with guilt, but his lips part uselessly, searching for words.

""I came here because I—I needed you."" My voice cracks, raw with heartbreak. ""And I find you like this?""

I gesture to the bed—our bed—where another woman had just lain underneath him. The sheets I had picked out. The mattress we had chosen together. The room that was supposed to be ours.

Dmitri pushes to his feet, his pants still unbuttoned, his entire existence suddenly repulsive. He reaches for me. ""Please, I—""

""Don't touch me.""

My voice is sharper than I intend, but the thought of his hands on me now makes my skin crawl.

His face twists, desperation seeping into his features. ""It was a mistake! I wasn’t thinking—""

I scoff, my arms folding tightly over my chest. ""Oh? Your dick just happened to slip into her?""

Dmitri flinches. ""Elena—""

""Shut up.""

My breath is ragged. My vision blurs, but I refuse to cry. I refuse to break down in front of him.

I should be screaming. I should be throwing things, clawing at him, making him bleed the way he's just made me bleed. But I can't. I'm too numb.

Too shattered.

A part of me—a stupid, naive, pathetic part—wants him to fight for me.

To drop to his knees. To beg. To convince me that this isn’t real, that this is just some nightmare I’ll wake up from.

But I don't wake up.

I just stand there, breathing in the reality of it all.

""You said you loved me.""

Dmitri swallows hard. ""I do.""

My laugh is bitter. ""You have a funny way of showing it.""

Silence.

Maybe if this was the past me. Even the ‘me’ from yesterday, I would have screamed. I would have cursed him out. But now? I was already exhausted. Half my world had already shattered this morning.

So, instead, I inhale sharply and turn on my heel, my heart pounding against my ribs.

I need to leave.

Now.

""Elena, wait!"" Dmitri grabs my wrist, his grip desperate, but I rip myself free with such force that he stumbles back.

The love I had for him dies in that moment.

I don’t even look back as I walk away. Leaving our apartment. I walk in a daze, my mind completely lost to mourning my step-father, mourning the marriage life that I knew wouldn’t happen anymore.

My parent’s house is dark when I step inside.

The funeral was in the morning. It felt like a lifetime ago. And now, it’s night.

Everything feels different. Colder. Like the walls know what I’ve seen tonight, know that I am no longer the same woman who left this house earlier.

I swallow the lump in my throat and walk deeper inside, my heels clicking against the wooden floor.

""Mom?"" I call softly.

She must be sleeping. I had left her resting in her bedroom when I went to see Dmitri. God, I wish I hadn’t gone.

I wipe at my eyes, barely aware of the way my body shakes. The exhaustion crashes into me like a freight train.

One step. Then another.

I reach the kitchen, my fingers gripping the doorframe, ready to head upstairs—

Then I see her.

A choked gasp rips from my throat.

My mother.

She’s on the floor.

""Mom?"" My voice trembles.

She doesn’t move.

The room spins. My breath catches. No. No, no, no.

I stumble forward, collapsing onto my knees beside her. My hands shake violently as I reach for her, pressing my fingers to her neck, checking for breath, for warmth, for anything—

She’s burning.

Her skin is clammy, her forehead damp. And there—little red splotches marring her arm.

Burns.

What happened?

""Mom!"" I shake her. Hard. ""Mom, wake up! Please!""

She doesn’t stir.

The air leaves my lungs.

No. No. NO.

Please, God. Not her. Not her too.

My pulse roars in my ears, drowning everything else out as I grab my phone, my fingers fumbling, my vision blurring.

My heart slams against my ribs.

My throat tightens.

Tears blind me.

But there’s no time to panic.

I dial.

The ringing feels endless.

Then—

“911, what’s your emergency?”

I swallow a sob.

""My mother—she’s unconscious. Please. Please hurry.""

The operator starts talking, but I can barely hear.

I press my forehead to my mother’s, my body trembling.

“Stay with me,” I whisper. “Please, Mom. Stay with me.”

# Chapter 2

Elena’s POV:

The sterile white halls of the emergency ward felt like they were closing in on me, the scent of antiseptic and fear thick in the air.

My mother was wheeled in on a gurney, nurses shouting to each other in rushed, clipped voices as the emergency room doors swung open, then slammed shut, sealing her away from me.

I stood frozen in the hallway, my pulse a frantic drum against my ribs.

What do I do? What do I do?

My hands trembled as I pressed them to my face, trying to steady my breath, but it was impossible. She was fine this morning. Weak, but alive. And now she was in there, fighting for her life.

A nurse approached, her expression gentle. ""Miss Kovalyova?""

I turned, my throat too tight to respond.

""The doctor will speak with you shortly.""

I nodded numbly, my nails digging into my palms.

Minutes stretched into eternity. I had no idea how long I stood there, my body tense and aching.

Then the doors swung open again, and a doctor stepped out, his face strained.

I rushed forward. “Is she okay?”

The doctor exhaled. ""Your mother suffered a severe cardiac episode due to prolonged stress and underlying conditions. We need to perform an emergency bypass surgery to prevent further damage.""

My breath caught. ""Okay,"" I said, too quickly. ""Then do it.""

His face hardened. ""The procedure costs fifty eight thousand dollars here.""

The number hit me like a punch to the gut.

A sharp ringing filled my ears as my mind tried to process it. Fifty thousand dollars?!

I didn't have that kind of money.

Hell, I barely had enough to cover next month’s rent. We were already in deep shit with our previous debt.

""You'll need to secure the payment within the next twenty-four hours so we can proceed,"" the doctor continued, oblivious to the way my world was crumbling beneath my feet.

""Twenty-four hours?"" My voice came out hollow.

""Yes. If we delay any longer, her condition may worsen beyond what surgery can fix.""

I stared at him. Twenty-four hours. Fifty eight thousand dollars.

""Do you have insurance?"" the doctor asked, his voice impassive, like this was just another conversation for him.

""No."" My voice broke on the word.

""Family who can assist?""

I wanted to laugh. What family?

He sighed, pushing his glasses up his nose. ""I suggest you find a solution quickly. We will keep her stable for now, but time is of the essence."" With that, he nodded and disappeared down the hallway, leaving me standing in the wreckage of my life.

I stumbled backward onto one of the plastic chairs in the waiting area, my vision swimming.

I was alone.

There was no one I could call, no one I could ask.

And for one horrifying second, my mind drifted to Dmitri.

Dmitri Vetrov. My ex-fiancé.

Rich. Powerful. The youngest son of a multimillionaire. He could write a check for fifty thousand dollars without blinking.

Would he help me?

My stomach curled in disgust at the thought.

I could see it now. His smug, self-satisfied smirk. The condescending tilt of his head as he crossed his arms and leaned back, acting as if I owed him something for his generosity after how I had left him begging on his knees just a while ago.

No.

If my mother found out I had lowered myself to begging my cheating ex for money, she wouldn’t accept it. She would rather die than have me throw away my dignity for her.

And I wasn’t sure I could survive begging Dmitri either.

Then who?

My nails dug into my knees, my breath coming in short gasps. What do I do? What do I do?

And then—

A familiar name echoed from a nearby television.

I lifted my head.

The hospital’s mounted TV was tuned into a business channel, the news anchor’s voice crisp and professional.

“—Vetrov Enterprises, owned by billionaire Nikolai Vetrov, announced a record-breaking deal today—”

Nikolai Vetrov.

The camera shifted to a man in his mid-thirties, dressed in a sharp black suit, his jawline like it was carved from stone. His dark brown hair gelled back to perfection.

His cold, calculating dark eyes scanned the reporters, his smile hiding something dangerous.

The most eligible bachelor in the whole of Alderidge.

Nikolai Vetrov.

Dmitri’s older stepbrother.

And the man who hated Dmitri with every fiber of his being.

The memory surfaced before I could stop it.

Dmitri’s twenty-fifth birthday. Six months ago.

A lavish party was held in a massive ballroom, filled with people who definitely didn’t belong in my world. I was from a lower class family, attending college with a scholarship.

However, I had become Dmitri’s girlfriend and after four years, for the first time he had invited me to such an occasion. Introducing me to others like I was a trophy. I had actually been extremely happy that day.

Because that was also the day Dmitri had proposed to me.

I had just left the restroom, smoothing out my dress, when I nearly collided with Nikolai Vetrov.

He had been leaning against the hallway wall, one hand in his pocket, a cigarette between his fingers. His onyx brown eyes swept over me, slow and deliberate.

Then he exhaled, releasing a cloud of smoke. ""My condolences.""

I frowned. ""Excuse me?""

""Your mind is sharp,"" he murmured, voice low, slightly slurred from alcohol. ""But your taste in men is absolutely tragic.""

I had been dumbfounded.

Like, who says that about their own brother?

It was the first time I truly realized Nikolai didn’t just dislike Dmitri like a lot of siblings do. He despised him.

""You have such a smart little mind,"" he mused, ""but it’s wasted on a man like him.""

I scoffed. ""And what makes you say that?""

Nikolai took another drag from his cigarette, exhaling slowly as he looked out into the city through the massive floor to ceiling windows in front of us.

""He isn’t exactly husband material.""

I let out a sharp laugh. ""Oh? And what do you think makes a man husband material?"" It had truly been funny to me, that a ‘man’ was telling me what ‘husband material’ was supposed to be.

But I didn’t defend Dmitri, I noticed the venom in Nikolai’s tone and knew it would be useless. I didn’t want to pick a fight with someone like him either.

His gaze darkened, piercing straight into my soul.

""He sucks at cooking.""

My brows lifted. ""Seriously?""

""You laugh, but a man who can’t even take care of himself can’t take care of you either.""

I rolled my eyes. ""It’s fine. I can cook and I’m used to taking care of myself.""

Nikolai’s lips curved into a slow, knowing smirk.

""He’s shit with money. Spends it like water.""

""He’s rich. Why does it matter?""

His gaze sharpened. ""Are you marrying him for money, then?""

I met his stare and tilted my head. ""What if I am?"" Of course I wasn’t. I hadn’t taken a dime from Dmitri. Not that I was against being treated like a princess. I was just not used to being indebted to anyone like this, it made my skin itch.

However, instead of getting offended, Nikolai looked… satisfied. He straightened, flicking ash from his cigarette.

""Good,"" he said.

I frowned. That’s it?

He studied me for a long moment, then murmured, ""I’m richer than him, you know.""

I blinked.

""What does that have to do with me?""

Nikolai shrugged. Then he walked away.

Only later on had I realized what he meant when he had said the last line, but I had tossed it to the back of my mind and assumed he was testing me for his little brother.

That memory burned in my mind as I stared at his face on the TV screen.

Nikolai Vetrov was richer than Dmitri.

More powerful. More ruthless. And he hated his stepbrother.

I sucked in a sharp breath.

An idea began to take shape—insane, desperate, but my only option.

I needed money.

I wanted power.

And there was a man who had both.

I needed Nikolai Vetrov.

# Chapter 3

Elena’s POV:

If I was wrong about Nikolai Vetrov’s intentions, the worst that could happen was that I would embarrass myself. That was nothing compared to what was at stake. But if I didn’t do anything—if I didn’t at least try to ask for his help—and my mother’s condition worsened, or worse…

I knew I would regret it for the rest of my life.

I exhaled sharply, forcing my shaky legs to push me upright.

That’s it then.

I had made my choice.

Pulling out my phone, I searched for the address of Vetrov Enterprises. I had been there once or twice before, back when Dmitri would take me out for lunch at one of the high-end restaurants near his brother’s office. But I didn’t remember the exact address.

At least I knew Nikolai wasn’t out of the country.

I glanced down at my outfit—a simple black dress, the same one I had worn earlier at my dad’s funeral. My hair was still tied into a low bun, strands falling loose from hours of exhaustion.

I looked like a grieving woman.

Which, in many ways, I was.

I was mourning the death of my father, the life I thought I would have, the man I thought loved me and the security I had believed in.

Now, I had nothing.

Except for this one insane, desperate plan.

— 30 minutes later —

The towering glass building of Vetrov Enterprises loomed before me, its sharp edges piercing the dawn sky.

The city was still asleep, the streets nearly deserted, but this place—this empire Nikolai built with his own hands—was already awake at four o'clock in the morning.

A few luxury cars lined the private parking area, their sleek exteriors gleaming under the streetlights.

I inhaled deeply, steeling myself.

I knew I probably wouldn’t be able to see him right away. CEOs don’t stroll into work at four in the morning. But I had no choice. I would leave my number with the receptionist and pray that Nikolai would agree to meet me.

There was no way I could ask Dmitri for his brother’s number.

Not when I was about to do this.

I pushed through the heavy glass doors and stepped into the lobby.

The receptionist at the front desk—a well-dressed woman in her late twenties— looked up from her computer screen, her eyes widening in surprise when she saw me.

“Are you Miss Elena?”

I frowned. “You know me?”

She hesitated, then nodded. “Ah, yes. Sir told me to send you up.”

My heart stopped.

What?

I stared at her, my pulse hammering in my ears. Had he… anticipated my arrival?

No. That wasn’t possible.

How would he know?

My hands curled into fists, my heartbeat racing.

The receptionist smiled and handed me a key card. “Take the elevator to the twenty-seventh floor. He’s expecting you.”

I nodded slowly, forcing myself to act normal as I took the card and walked toward the elevator.

My mind was spiraling.

Was this just a coincidence? Had he expected me to come?

Or… had he known all along that this day would come? No…that didn’t make sense. How would he know that I needed money for my mother’s bypass in advance?

There was another more plausible reason that swirled in my mind…was he somehow stalking me?

I swallowed hard, shaking off the thought as I stepped into the empty elevator.

That was ridiculous though. Why would someone like him have a need to do that?

The moment the doors slid shut, I let out a shaky breath and pressed my back against the cold metal wall.

Calm down. Keep it together.

I tapped the key card against the panel. The elevator hummed to life, carrying me higher and higher.

Maybe it was just my imagination or nervousness but the air felt thinner the closer I got.

Twenty-fifth floor.

Twenty-sixth.

Twenty-seventh.

A soft chime echoed, and the doors glided open.

There was only one office here.

A massive, double-door entrance at the end of the dimly lit hallway.

And sitting just outside it, a man—his posture straight as he typed away at his laptop. Nikolai’s secretary?

As soon as he saw me, he stood up and gestured toward the doors.

“Sir is waiting for you, Miss Kovalyova.” He smiled and moved to open the door for me.

I nodded, thanking him as I stepped inside, my gaze immediately landing on the man behind the desk.

Nikolai Vetrov sat in his massive leather chair, flipping through a file as if he hadn’t just called me here before I even made the decision to come.

His dark eyes flicked up from his papers, locking onto me.

The man was unfairly attractive.

He looked unbothered, composed. His expensive suit was perfectly fitted, the top button of his shirt undone, revealing a glimpse of tattoos peeking from his collar.

The picture-perfect CEO.

And I was standing frozen in front of him.

“Good morning,” he said smoothly, his voice deep.

The last time we had talked, I had drank alcohol so it hadn’t felt like this, and before that, the couple of times we ran into each other we hadn’t conversed at all.

I took a breath, forcing down my nerves. “Morning.”

“Have a seat.”

I did, trying to keep my posture straight and confident despite the storm raging inside me.

“Tea or coffee?” he asked.

“Neither. I’m fine.”

Nikolai frowned slightly before picking up the telecom. “Send in a pumpkin spice latte.”

My body went rigid.

How… did he know my favorite drink?

He leaned back, watching me with something close to amusement. ""Don't think too much. Dmitri talks a lot about you.""

My stomach tightened.

Hearing my ex-fiancé’s name out loud felt like a punch to the ribs. But I refused to show it.

Instead, I kept my gaze trained on Nikolai. “You know what he did, don’t you?”

He smirked.

""I warned you, didn't I? He isn't husband material.""

I clenched my fists ignoring his remark for now. “Why do you hate Dmitri?”

His smirk didn’t fade. ""Hate? No, I don't hate him. But I dislike him.""

I narrowed my eyes.

""He's spoiled. Daddy’s little treasure. He’s never suffered a day in his life. Never had to fight for anything. He thinks with his head, but not the one on his shoulders.""

Nikolai motioned toward his crotch.

I bit down on my tongue, feeling the urge to refute him.

But could I?

I had seen it with my own two eyes.

Dmitri was exactly what Nikolai described.

""After all,"" Nikolai continued, ""if he had any brains, he wouldn’t have fumbled someone like you.""

A sharp, hot sensation crawled up my spine.

This was it. This was my opening.

I lifted my chin. ""I have an offer for you.""

His eyes flickered with interest.

""Marry me. Give me enough money to save my mother. In return, I’ll give you a wife on paper. And a way to make your little brother a laughing stock.""

For the first time, Nikolai froze.

I watched as he leaned back, studying me. Then, his lips curled.

""You're pretty straightforward. I expected you to take more time to come around.""

My fingers dug into my lap. “I don’t have time for that. My mother needs emergency Bypass surgery. Are you willing to help me or not?”

I was probably glaring at him now.

A moment of silence stretched between us.

Then—

""If I say no… will you go back and ask Dmitri for money?""

A wry smile spread across my face.

“He isn’t the only member of the Vetrov family I can go to, you know,” I said, my voice laced with something dangerous. “After all, I know Daddy Vetrov has certain tendencies toward girls half his age.”

I was pushing my limits.

But I had a hunch.

A dangerous, reckless hunch.

That Nikolai Vetrov was interested in me.

# Chapter 4

Elena’s POV:

As expected, Nikolai Vetrov went rigid.

His sharp, composed expression didn’t falter, but something in his posture shifted. His dark eyes locked onto mine, piercing, calculating—assessing me.

Then, he stood up. Slowly.

“You really are something, you know that?” His voice was smooth, almost amused, but there was an underlying challenge in his tone.

“Fine then.” He leaned against his desk, arms crossed. “But tell me, Elena—what else are you willing to give? Because making Dmitri a laughingstock? That’s not difficult for me.”

He smirked. “I could do that without marrying you.”

He was right. He truly didn’t need me for that.

But I needed him.

My wedding with Dmitri was set for three months from now. If I didn’t get married, I would be the one people laughed at. My friends, my classmates, the very people who had seen me flaunt my relationship on social media for years.

The image of Dmitri’s betrayal and his pathetic excuses burned in my mind.

My stomach twisted. I wanted him to suffer.

That’s when I realized—this wasn’t just about saving my mother. If I only needed money for that I could just borrow it from him. Not just him, I could go back to the loan sharks and take more money from them.

They wouldn’t decline me, in fact they would only be happy to see me paying back my debts for the rest of my life.

So yes, I wanted to destroy Dmitri.

I wanted to rip him apart from the inside.

Make him feel even a fraction of what I had felt when I walked in on him with someone else.

I inhaled deeply, staring at Nikolai.

If he wasn’t going to marry me, he was useless to me.

“I’ll give you a wife on paper and nothing more,” I said firmly. “I have nothing else to give.”

That was the truth…or so I thought.

Silence stretched between us.

Then Nikolai got up, his movements slow, deliberate.

His eyes narrowed as he approached, his steps measured, predatory. The air between us grew heavy, thick with an intensity I wasn’t prepared for.

I forced my body to stay still, my heart pounding loudly in my chest.

After what felt like an eternity, he finally spoke.

""You want to marry me and have my name, Elena?""

His breath grazed my ear, sending an involuntary shiver down my spine.

""Then you’ll take everything that comes with it.""

My eyes widened slightly. “What… do you mean?”

He smiled, his fingers gripping the arms of my chair as he turned it to face him completely.

Our noses almost touched. Our breaths almost intertwined.

""Everything,"" he murmured. ""My money. My fame. And even my body.""

My breath hitched.

But I shook my head. No. No, I couldn’t do that.

“I want a strictly contractual marriage. With a time limit,” I said, my voice steady, but my hands clenched into fists.

His lips curled into a smirk. ""And a contract marriage is what you’ll get. No feelings. No strings attached. One year.”

I narrowed my eyes, “I won’t sleep with you.” I truly didn’t trust myself around a man like him. If I actually slept with him, what if I developed feelings? No…not again. Especially not a Vetrov.

His next words however knocked the air right out of my lungs.

""Oh, no, I need you to understand this, Malishka. There will be no sleeping. Only fucking.""

My entire body stiffened.

He leaned closer, his voice smooth, teasing. ""I will fuck you. If you can accept that… then I will make sure Dmitri grovels at your feet. I’ll ensure your mother’s surgery is done by the world’s best surgeon.

He straightened, studying my reaction before he delivered the final blow.

""And I’ll make sure you never have to work a part-time job again. You’ll have all the time in the world to study—to build your dream of making cars.""

After months of solo development, countless cups of coffee, and learning as I go, I finally have something I'm excited to share with you all.

The idea for YourWave was born out of my own frustration. I was tired of the feeling that dating apps have become a popularity contest where ghosting is the norm and conversations die before they even start. I decided that instead of giving up, I'd try to build the space I'd want to use myself.

The result is an app built on a different philosophy:
* Connections based on who you are: The algorithm focuses on your shared tastes and interests. It's about finding your people, not just a gallery of bodies.

* A 'Nomad Mode' to break down barriers: It lets you chat and connect with people from any city in the world, right from your home.

* Made for everyone, and for you: The app is translated into over 30 languages and is highly customizable—way beyond just a light/dark mode—so you can make it feel truly yours.

* Chats without barriers: If you match with someone, the conversation is yours. No artificial limits or paywalls for basic features.

* Real privacy and control: I've put a special emphasis on you always having full control over your visibility and information.

The big step is that Google has finally approved the app, and it's now up for pre-registration on the Play Store for Android. (I'm currently working hard on the iOS version, you're next in line!).

To celebrate and as a heartfelt thank you to the first people who believe in this project, I've enabled a reward: 1 month of Premium for free for everyone who pre-registers (no cards, no tricks, just a straight-up gift on launch day, August 22nd).

YourWave Play Store > 

I would be incredibly grateful for your honest feedback. Do you think an approach like this makes sense? What's your biggest turn-off with current apps? Any feedback on the concept or the offer would be incredibly valuable.

Alea woke up.

She was lying in her cabin. Her arm was in a cast—a sure sign the ship’s healer no longer had mana for healing spells and had resorted to “practical methods.”

She barely remembered anything. They had sailed the Sea Pearl into the storm to escape a Legion battlecruiser. Their sails had already been damaged, and the ship and crew were in poor condition. Milda had been taken to the infirmary along with many others. She had been thrown around violently during the storm and had struck her head, losing consciousness. Most likely, Lobo had carried her below deck and steered the ship through the storm.

There was a knock, and the unlocked door opened. Healer Frenn entered. He looked unwashed, his robe stained with dirt and blood. He looked like he hadn’t slept in days.

“Captain. How are you feeling?”

“Better than you, Frenn. You look like you punched Firebombs and flyers with your bare fists.”

Frenn seemed to tired to appreciate her jokes. “I was about to lie down—but on my way here, I saw a ship approaching us. An unknown ship.”

“The Legion?” Alea asked in alarm.

“It looks similar to a Legion ship, but without the dark steel—and judging from the island wrapped in a mana shield in the background, I’d say the storm pushed us far southeast… to Thalasson.”

“But Thalasson is dead. There’s been no human activity in over 500 years.”

“I read the histories too—but here we are. Off the coast of Thalasson, and a ship is making ready to board us.”  
Alea wanted to continue but suddenly she heard a dull thumb. The sound of creaking wood coming from below.   
She listened for a moment, but nothing else could be heared. The Sea Pearl was groaning and suffering like its crew.  
  
“Why didn’t anyone ring the alarm bell?”

“Because i think no one’s awake.”

“Lobo?”

“Nearly died of exhaustion. After you were knocked out, he held the helm for three days straight and brought us through the storm. I feared he’d die of sheer fatigue and put him to bed. Milda is in her room—fit for duty physically, but the burns on her face have… left her mentally scarred. The rest of the crew is either asleep or injured. Though i occasionally heard some steps. Maybe sombody is walking around somewhere. I am too tired to look into it.”

“Then only one officer is still functional. I’ll go topside. You go get some rest, Frenn.”

Frenn nodded and turned to leave.

“Frenn,” Alea said softly.

He looked back over his shoulder.

“Thank you for everything. You’re a true hero.”

“I think just about everyone on this ship is a hero. But more than anyone—Lobo. Without him, we wouldn’t be having this conversation.”

“I understand. Then it’s my turn now. I’ll face the ship.”

Frenn nodded and left the cabin. He was too tired to worry anymore. He was likely terrified of the unknown ship—especially given his gentle nature—but too exhausted to show it.

Alea heaved herself upright and struggled to get her boots on with just one working arm—but she eventually managed. Just as she stepped out of the cabin, two of the sea marines came toward her—probably the only other functional crew members left. They called out excitedly:

“Captain! An unknown ship has moored alongside us. We’re being boarded!”

“Calm down. We’re in no condition to fight anyway. Let’s head topside and see if we can negotiate—or bluff. Maybe all is not yet lost.”

As they climbed topside, Alea noted that the Sea Pearl was listing. The ship might sink—or at least wouldn’t remain seaworthy for much longer.

Alea stepped onto the deck with the marines. There, she saw the storm’s devastation: a few gulls were pecking at a dead sailor who had been carelessly left lying on the deck. Probably, no one had the time or strength to care for him. Rigging ropes were strewn everywhere. Mast pieces and wood were tangled across the deck. The twin turrets were relatively intact—but that was about the only consolation. Most of the sails were burned, and even the mainmast was charred.

Alea looked to the side and saw an elegant warship moored alongside the Sea Pearl. A vessel of white-lacquered steel with golden accents. Opulent. Lavish. But the twin turret made it clear this was no ceremonial ship.

When she looked more closely at the other ship’s deck, she gasped.Standing there were aging mages, combat automatons—and in the center of them all: two men and a woman, surrounded by elite soldiers—or perhaps elite automatons; Alea wasn’t sure. But their enchanted armor and weapons clearly marked them as elite.

The man in the center, who looked like the leader, wore luxurious robes of black and gold. Beside him stood a man in a traditional white robe with a golden sash. And the woman wore a functional military uniform. Behind the stern of the Sea Pearl, Alea saw the massive mana shield rising from the sea. No doubt about it. This was Thalasson.

Could the three on the opposite deck… be humans? The ancestors of her human half? The humans who had vanished over 500 years ago?

A gangway was pushed out from the other ship to her ship. The three people and the ornate-looking soldiers came forward. Alea looked at the three now up close. Two of them had artificial eyes. Could they be the legendary humanoid automatons? The third one? She searched for signs of him being artificial, but she found none, and his ears were round. A human? A human! He came closer.

""Permission to come aboard?""

""Permission granted,"" Alea replied promptly and then pointed at her injury and the two soldiers behind her. ""Not that we could stop you if we wanted to.""

""True,"" the man remarked dryly. ""And you entered our waters. But the way I see it, it was an accident and not an attack. My name is Fenno Cavil. I am the consul of Thalasson. Who are you?""

""The consul?"" Alea stood at attention. The elected leader of Thalasson. Alea had so many questions and so much fear of doing something wrong. For half a millennium, no one had seen a human...

But every friendship starts the same way – with a name.

""Your honors, Consul Cavil. I am Alea vin Vanthurei. Eldest daughter of the honorable House Vanthurei ruling a dukedom of the Kingdom of Evora. Blessed in part with human blood and, by the grace of the Dragonblood King of Evora, captain of the Sea Pearl. It is a great honor to welcome you.""

Isla

They say ghosts don’t exist, but they’ve never been blindsided by one in a designer suit and Italian leather shoes.

I was running late for the Monday morning meeting—half-asleep, clutching my lukewarm coffee, and praying no one noticed the stain on my blouse from Leo’s jelly toast attack. I slid into my chair just as our CEO, Mike, cleared his throat.

“We have a new majority shareholder,” he began, eyes darting nervously around the boardroom. “He’ll be overseeing operations personally. Please give a warm welcome to—”

The door opened. I looked up. And my heart stopped.

He stepped into the room like he owned it—which, technically, he now did.

Lucien Wolfe.

Only I didn’t know him as that. Not five years ago. Back then, I only knew him as Luke—the man who kissed me under a Tuscan sunset, who made me laugh like I hadn’t in years, who vanished without warning and took my heart with him.

The same man who had no idea he left me with something far more permanent than heartbreak.

I gripped the edge of the conference table, my nails biting into the wood. He looked different—taller somehow, broader, sharper around the edges. His dark hair was slicked back now, his jaw tighter, his expression like chiseled ice.

But his eyes.

God, those eyes.

Grey. Cold. Calculating.

And still the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen.

He scanned the room with all the warmth of a panther selecting prey. And then—he saw me.

Our eyes locked. A flicker of something crossed his face—confusion, maybe? Recognition? But it vanished before I could name it.

“Thank you, Mike,” Lucien said smoothly, his voice deeper than I remembered. “I’m not here to shake things up… yet. I’m just observing. Continue.”

He sat at the head of the table, precisely where he belonged. Alpha. Untouchable.

I couldn’t breathe.

My mind screamed. Does he remember me? But he didn’t say a word. Didn’t falter. Didn’t even blink.

I forced myself to sit still through the rest of the meeting, though I heard none of it. The walls felt like they were closing in. The room was too hot, too bright. Or maybe that was just my panic setting in.

The moment Mike dismissed us, I bolted—too fast, too obvious, but I didn’t care.

I made it to the hallway, half-jogging toward the elevator, willing the doors to open faster.

“Isla.”

I froze.

His voice was behind me—quiet, commanding, impossible to ignore.

Slowly, I turned. Lucien stood just a few feet away, hands in his pockets, watching me like he was trying to place a dream from a lifetime ago.

“You look… familiar,” he said, head tilting slightly. “Have we met?”

I swallowed. “I—I don’t think so.”

He studied me longer, and I felt like I was being dissected under a microscope. “You sure?”

“Positive,” I lied.

He stepped closer. Not threatening. Not unkind. Just… intense. “Hmm. Maybe I’m mistaken.”

You are. Please be mistaken. Please walk away.

But he didn’t. “What’s your name?”

I hesitated. “Isla. Isla Monroe.”

He said it quietly, testing the sound of it on his tongue. “Isla.”

The elevator chimed. I turned and stepped inside, desperate for escape.

As the doors closed, I met his gaze one last time.

Those eyes. That face. That past I’d buried deep.

And the secret I had never told a soul.

I made it to the bathroom before I broke.

Locking myself in the furthest stall, I sat down and pressed a hand to my mouth to muffle the sob that escaped.

Lucien Wolfe. Billionaire. CEO. Tech titan. My son’s father.

How was this happening?

Five years. I’d told myself a thousand times I would never see him again. That what we had was just a summer illusion. That he probably wasn’t even real.

But now he was here. Flesh and blood. Standing in my office.

And I had a son with his eyes and no idea how to fix this.

That night, I tucked Leo into bed and sat beside him as he drifted to sleep. His tiny hand clutched my fingers, his lashes long and dark against his cheeks. He was the only good thing that had come from that heartbreak.

He didn’t know who his father was. I’d never spoken his name. How could I, when I didn’t know who Lucien Wolfe really was until recently—until his face started popping up in Forbes articles and tech magazines?

I’d thought about reaching out. A hundred times. A thousand.

But how do you explain to the richest man in the country that you had his child and never told him?

And how do you admit that you were scared? That you didn’t know if he’d want the baby, or hate you for keeping it?

Now the choice was being ripped from my hands.

He was here.

And the past I’d worked so hard to bury was clawing its way to the surface.

# Chapter 2

Lucien

She looked at me like I was a ghost.

It wasn’t the usual reaction I got when walking into a room—fear, awe, admiration, maybe a hint of jealousy. People read the name Lucien Wolfe and either scrambled to impress or to hide. I was used to being the one in control, the one others studied like a predator in the wild. But this… this was different.

Her expression hit me like a cold wave—eyes wide, skin pale, breath caught in her throat.

And for the life of me, I couldn’t figure out why.

Isla Monroe.

The name lingered in my mind long after the meeting ended. Her voice echoed too—soft, poised, but trembling at the edges, like she was trying to hold herself together. I knew I’d seen her before. Not in a vague, have we met at some gala? kind of way. No, this was different. She struck something deep, something old. Like a song you haven’t heard in years that still makes your chest tighten, even if you don’t remember the lyrics.

But I couldn’t place her. And that infuriated me.

I’d spent years sharpening my instincts, reading people in seconds, uncovering lies with a glance. I could dissect a man’s life from his handshake alone. Yet the moment I looked into her eyes, all of that precision slipped. It felt like standing on the edge of a memory I wasn’t allowed to access.

Familiar. That’s what she was.

Too familiar.

I stood at the window of my penthouse hours later, the city skyline stretched before me like a conquest. The glass walls framed a world I’d carved out with my own hands—skyscrapers that bore my mark, a legacy that had no room for fragility or emotion.

But tonight, I wasn’t thinking about stock prices or acquisition deals. I was thinking about her.

That look on her face. The way she flinched when I said her name.

Isla.

There was something in the way her lips moved. A memory that wouldn’t form completely. A moment just out of reach. I closed my eyes, trying to force clarity.

And then it came. Italy.

My hand tightened around the crystal tumbler of scotch. It had been five years, but suddenly, that summer came back in sharp flashes. A quiet village outside Florence. The smell of lemons and dust. A woman with sun-kissed skin and laughter in her voice. I’d gone by Luke then. My middle name. Trying to escape my life, my name, the headlines. A sabbatical of sorts—except no one really escapes who they are.

And her.

The girl who never asked who I really was. She didn’t care about Wolfe Capital or my last name. She just saw me. Luke, the man who painted awful watercolors and burned pasta. The man who held her under the stars and kissed her like the world was ending.

Could it be…?

No. It couldn’t be.

But the timelines matched. Her reaction matched. The way she looked at me—like I’d shattered her.

And her eyes… God, they were the same ones I remembered looking up at me beneath a Tuscan sky. I’d buried that summer under layers of ambition and steel. I told myself it didn’t mean anything, that it was just a break in the storm.

But it had meant something.

And now I couldn’t ignore the question gnawing at me.

I set the glass down with a sharp click and pulled up her employee file on my tablet. Legal consultant. Hired three years ago. Good reputation. Met deadlines. Clean record. No red flags.

Except there was a gap.

A full year missing.

Maternity leave?

The thought hit me like a brick to the chest. My jaw clenched. I opened a deeper background search—something the standard HR system wouldn’t show. Isla Monroe. Age 29. Born in Seattle. Moved to New York six years ago. One dependent.

Leo Monroe. Age four.

Born nine months after that summer.

I stared at the screen, unmoving. My throat dried. My ears rang like I’d been thrown into the ocean. The facts were lining up too neatly. Too painfully.

A son?

My son?

No. I was jumping to conclusions. Assumptions. Dangerous ones.

I needed proof. I needed truth. Because if she lied—if she kept my child from me—then this wasn’t just betrayal. It was war.

I leaned against the desk, trying to breathe through the storm of thoughts crashing through my head. Four years. She’d known for four years and said nothing. What kind of woman does that? What kind of mother?

And yet… part of me wasn’t angry.

Part of me was gutted.

Because I hadn’t known. I hadn’t been there for his first steps, his first words. I hadn’t even known his name until tonight.

I picked up the phone.

“Darren,” I said, my voice low and clipped. “I need a quiet DNA test run. Fast. Get me something off Isla Monroe. Coffee cup, pen, anything she’s touched.”

There was a pause. “You think she—?”

“Just do it,” I snapped.

I ended the call and paced the room for what felt like hours. The scotch sat untouched. My phone buzzed with updates I ignored. None of it mattered right now. Not until I knew.

That evening, I found myself parked outside her apartment building. I hadn’t planned it. I told myself I was just in the area. That I needed air. But I didn’t move. I stayed. Watched.

She emerged just after six, bundled in a long coat, scarf wrapped tight around her neck. Her hair was tucked beneath a wool cap, and in her hand was a much smaller one—chubby fingers, a navy-blue mitten, a little boy no taller than her hip.

He laughed as they walked. Bright, wild, unfiltered joy. The kind I hadn’t felt in years.

And then—just for a second—he turned his head.

Our eyes met.

Grey.

Not maybe grey. Not sort-of grey.

My grey.

My mouth went dry. My chest caved in.

He looked just like me. Same bone structure. Same smirk. Same damned eyes.

I couldn’t breathe.

She hadn’t told me. She’d gone on with her life, raised a child who carried my blood, my legacy—without me.

He was mine.

And I’d missed everything.

# Chapter 3

Isla

The first sign that something was wrong came when I opened my fridge and found Leo’s juice box missing.

Not a big deal on its own—he’s four and fast when he wants to be—but the second sign came a heartbeat later. My phone buzzed on the counter with a calendar notification I didn’t set. A meeting. Noon. Private conference – Lucien Wolfe’s office.

I hadn’t agreed to any meeting.

I stared at the screen, heart thudding. A chill slid down my spine.

This wasn’t a coincidence. Not after yesterday. Not after the look he gave me.

He knows something.

I tried to shake it off as I dressed for work, but the thought stayed rooted in my skull. I kissed Leo’s forehead before dropping him off at daycare, and the entire time he talked about dinosaurs and cookies, I felt like a bomb was ticking somewhere under my feet.

The office felt colder today. Or maybe that was just me.

Whispers followed me down the hallway. A few glances. Nothing out of the ordinary, but it felt like everyone knew. Like I’d grown a scarlet letter overnight.

I didn’t have time to think about it. At 11:58, my nerves completely unraveled.

I stood outside Lucien Wolfe’s office, staring at the massive glass doors like they might swallow me whole.

You’ve survived worse, I told myself.

That was a lie.

I knocked once, then pushed the door open.

Lucien was behind his desk, sleeves rolled up, suit jacket draped over the chair. He looked up—and everything in him went still.

“So you did come.”

I swallowed hard. “You sent a meeting invite.”

His eyes flickered. “You didn’t decline.”

I walked in cautiously, arms folded tight across my chest. “What is this about?”

He didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he reached into a drawer and pulled out a manila envelope. My stomach twisted.

“I don’t like being lied to, Isla.”

He slid the envelope across the desk.

I didn’t open it. I didn’t have to.

“I want to hear it from you,” he said softly, but there was steel under the words. “Is he mine?”

The air left my lungs.

My legs gave out, and I sat without meaning to, sinking into the leather chair opposite him. I stared at the envelope. At the name scrawled on the tab in neat handwriting.

Leo Monroe.

I looked up slowly, my voice a whisper. “You had me followed?”

“No,” he said. “I had you investigated.”

The distinction barely mattered.

I should have been angry. Maybe I was. But the truth was—I was scared. Not of him. Not really. I was scared of what this meant. For me. For Leo. For the life I’d worked so hard to build.

“You had no right,” I said quietly.

He leaned forward, voice calm, but tight. “I had every right. You disappeared after Tuscany. No number. No last name. You cut me out. And now I find out I have a four-year-old son with my eyes and my damn DNA?”

Tears blurred my vision. I blinked them back.

“I didn’t know who you were, Lucien. Not really. You left without a word.”

“So did you,” he shot back. “I woke up one morning, and you were gone.”

My throat tightened. “Because I saw the headline on your phone. Lucien Wolfe, heir to the WolfeTech fortune, missing from family estate. I realized everything had been a lie. You weren’t just some guy escaping the noise. You were—you. And I was… no one.”

Silence fell.

He stood, running a hand through his hair. “You still should have told me.”

I stood too, suddenly angry. “What would you have done? Sent a check? Sent your lawyers to take him from me?”

His jaw clenched. “You think I would take your son away?”

I didn’t answer.

“Our son,” he corrected sharply. “You had no right to make that decision for both of us.”

Now I was trembling. “I was scared. I didn’t even know if you’d care. I figured you’d deny it. Or worse—use him as leverage if it suited you. That’s what men like you do.”

He looked like I’d slapped him.

“Men like me.”

I regretted the words the moment they left my mouth.

Lucien’s voice lowered to something lethal. “You think I don’t care? You think I’m the kind of man who’d abandon his own son? You knew me, Isla. You knew who I was before the world ever got involved.”

“I thought I did,” I whispered.

We stared at each other, and for a moment, the walls between us cracked—just enough for the past to slip through. I saw the man I once loved in his eyes. The man who held me by the fire in Tuscany, who kissed my shoulder and promised he wasn’t going anywhere.

He was gone now.

This man? This man was fire and storm and vengeance, wrapped in an Armani suit and a heart that had turned to stone.

“I want to see him,” Lucien said at last, voice quieter now.

My stomach twisted. “You can’t just walk into his life. He doesn’t know you.”

“Then introduce us.”

I stared at him, panic rising. “Lucien—”

“I’m not asking, Isla. I’m telling you. You kept him from me once. You won’t do it again.”",1,1754911346.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

To start with brewing time: the rule of thumb is to use 16-24h, and brew inside the fridge, very coarse grind. I see variants where people do 1h blooming at room temp, but overall that's the standard.
However, then I see peopke doing 36h, others same 16-24h but always room temp. I don't fully understand those variants since it seems pretty stablished that with a coarse grind, don't go below 16h or above 24h.

Then about ratios: my understanding is it depens of you want concentrate or already something to drink. So it goes from 1:4 to1:10. Is there a relation between ratio and brewing time? Whe doing concentrate is common to be on the 16h side and when doing 1:10 closer to 24h?

Something I'm feeling while exploring cold brews is that I use a lot of coffee just to get a few cups. For example I did concentrate the other day, and used 60gr coffee with 240ml water just to get 130ml. Feels bad my coffee goes away so quickly 😅

And one final question, right now I'm using a normal jar and full immersion, not using bags or filter inside the jar. When I'm done I use a metal mesh to filter my coffee. Is there a big difference between this or using those ""tea"" bags when brewing? Does it increase brewing time? Does change the flavor?

1mna2bo,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1mna2bo/today_was_a_good_day/,Today Was a Good Day,"Title: Sunrise Over Southside

The sun cracked the sky like a fresh bottle of Thunderbird—slow, deliberate, and full of promise. I woke up in a room that smelled like last night’s sins and this morning’s redemption. No sirens. No knocks. No baby mama drama. Just silence, the kind that makes a man feel like maybe, just maybe, the world ain’t out to get him today.

I slid out the bed, careful not to wake Peaches. She was curled up like a cat in heat, her wig half-off and dreams still dancing behind her eyelids. I didn’t love her, but I didn’t hate her either. She was comfort in a city that rarely offered any.

Coffee was instant, but the peace was real. I lit a Kool and stared out the window at the Southside. Kids playing in the hydrant spray, old heads posted on stoops like sentinels of the block. No gunshots. No chalk outlines. Just laughter and the smell of fried bologna from Miss Geneva’s kitchen.

I stepped outside, creased khakis and a fresh white tee. The Cadillac was still parked where I left it—no broken glass, no missing rims. That alone felt like a miracle. I slid in, turned the key, and let the engine purr like a satisfied pimp. The radio kicked on, Ice Cube preaching gospel over basslines. “Today I didn’t even have to use my AK…” I nodded. Felt that.

Rolled down Crenshaw, past the liquor store where Lil Man usually hustled loosies and dreams. He waved, no desperation in his eyes today. Just a grin and a nod. I tossed him a couple singles. Not charity—just respect. We all trying to make it, one hustle at a time.

Stopped by Big Roy’s Barbershop. Not for a cut, but for the sermon. Roy was trimming a youngblood’s fade, talking about how the Panthers had it right and how Reagan had it wrong. I soaked it in like gin on Sunday. Wisdom from a man who’d seen the game change but never folded his hand.

Next stop: Mama’s house. She was on the porch, rocking slow, humming Al Green. Her eyes lit up when she saw me. No lecture, no side-eye. Just love. She handed me a plate—smothered chicken, collard greens, cornbread so soft it could make a grown man cry. I ate like I hadn’t in weeks. Maybe I hadn’t.

After lunch, I hit the park. Dice game under the shade tree. I threw bones like I had angels guiding my wrist. Came up fifty strong. No beef. No snatch-and-run. Just dap and laughter. Even the OGs were smiling, like the block had taken a deep breath and exhaled peace.

Sun dipped low, painting the sky in hues of gold and blood orange. I cruised back home, windows down, music up. Peaches was gone, left a note: “Thanks for the quiet. Needed it.” I didn’t chase her. Some things are better left in the rearview.

I sat on the stoop, sipping a cold forty, watching the stars blink awake. No cops. No chaos. Just the hum of streetlights and the rhythm of a city finally giving a brother a break.

And in that moment, I knew—today wasn’t just good. It was sacred. A rare jewel in a life full of broken glass and bent dreams. Donald Goines would’ve called it a reprieve. Iceberg Slim might’ve called it a hustle-free interlude. Me? I just called it mine.

Tomorrow might bring the wolves. But tonight? Tonight, the streets sang lullabies, and I listened.",1,1754910622.0,stories,0,1.0,False

I’ve been running a small side hustle for a while now. Buying used espresso machines, repairing and cleaning them, reselling them for a profit. I really enjoy the “buy → repair → sell” cycle and have made some nice extra income from it.

That said, I’m not sure how to take it to the next level.
A few things about my situation:

I don’t want to focus on repair work for customers. I prefer flipping machines rather than being “on call” for fixing other people’s gear.

I’m interested in scaling it up into something more stable and potentially full-time.

I’m not sure what steps to take next. whether that’s building an online shop, expanding into other related products, or something else entirely.

The other problem that i get is that i dont have a steady buying of machines. İ need to check the local marketplace daily and see if there are deals coming by that are worth it.

İ am based in the Netherlands.


If you’ve taken a similar niche hobby or side hustle and turned it into a real business, I’d love to hear:

(Times New Roman, 12) 
     
      As the sun rose over the darkened sky, the world was subsumed in a terror of blueish hues. It was my last day on Earth. A quiet, almost contemplative calm seemed to wash over me as I watched the sunrise. I knew today I would be leaving behind all that which had given meaning to me. I pondered how I would spend my final day.
    Not too long had I figured it out when I left to meet a friend over coffee. We both had work to finish up before my departure, so it seemed the obvious choice for how to spend my time. 
     Besides, it is still just another day, even if my last. Yes, tomorrow would be for most as any day often is; birds would sing, people would wake, and life would go on in such a normal fashion you’d be surprised to learn anyone’s had ever needed mine at all. 
     For now, I simply wanted to take it all in one last time. The sight of my friend, the color of her hair, the shape of her face, the light in her eyes. It was by no means a romantic sight, but an appreciation of all the things that made her whole. I tried to imagine if I looked “whole” to her as well, if I was truly seen by anyone in such a way. A look that could pierce Heaven and Earth and break the chain that pulls me away from here. 
     The night encroached as we worked away the day. There was an atmosphere that made it easy to forget this was the last time I would experience any of this. For a moment, I believed it truly would never end. 
     As the end approached, the work stopped. We had finished our tasks, yet could not leave. Nothing bound us to the room but the desire to remain; the need to exist. There was no more work to distract from my leave, but still time to reflect on all that had happened. I embraced the life I had here as my world faded from view. I had lived, even in a world that could never be, I had lived a lifetime in a moment. 

(Comic Sans, 11)
      
     And the sun rose over the darkened sky, as the world awoke to the bright hues of blue and gold. It was my last day before I returned home. Thoughts of what awaited me flooded my mind as sunlight peered into my peripheral. I knew today I would be returning to all that had once given me meaning. I wondered how I’d spend my final day.
     Soon after, she invited me to get coffee. We both had work to finish before leaving, so it was a nice opportunity to spend time together. It was my last day, after all. Tomorrow the birds will sing a different tune, and the people will not wake at the same times, and our lives will go in such different directions you’d be surprised to learn we had ever met at all. 
      I decided to take it all in one last time. The sight of her, the frays in her hair, the shifts in her posture, the focus in her eyes. It was by all means a romantic sight, an appreciation of all the things that made her whole. I tried to imagine if she would ever appreciate me in such a way, if anyone could ever truly be “seen” at all. Seen so clearly it could pierce Heaven and Earth, breaking the chain that binds me to here. 
      The night came quickly as we worked away the day. It was easy to let our little time pass when we were together. For a moment, I felt that I would never let this end. 
      But the end approached, and work finally stopped. Our tasks were complete, but I could not yet leave. Tension tied us to the room, begging us to remain; to continue to exist. We spoke of what was to come, how we would hold on to the changes we sparked in one another. I embraced the future as she faded from view. I will live, even in a world that may never be, I will remember this moment for a lifetime. 

(Courier New, 12)
     
     And the sun rose over the darkened sky, as the world began anew. It was my last day. I thought of how I might live after today as the sun rose. I already knew how I’d spend my final day.
     I went to get coffee with her. We said we had work to finish before it was time to leave, but we just wanted to see each other. I thought of tomorrow, how nothing would change, how everything must. Even so, it was nice to have known her at all.
      We watched each other one last time; trying to burn the memory within us so that it may never end. It was love. Not romance, not not. It was the appreciation of everything that we were before meeting, and everything we are after. I gazed at her hoping to pierce Heaven and Earth, that we might be able to do so together. 
     The day continued, night came. We existed. For a moment, I knew it was already over. 
     The end came, work stopped. Our work was done, yet our tasks incomplete. We kept each other in the room, accepting that we would soon no longer exist. We reflected and laughed as we planned out a future we knew we could never keep. I embraced her as the world faded from view, and as the sun rose over the darkened sky, I set down my pen and allowed myself to rest.

I appreciate the engagement and the questions; I'm always happy to answer questions. But there was an interaction I had where it became clear to me that people are making this whole ""non-duality"" thing into a belief system.

The commenter asked me something about who is typing if there is no self and when I responded, he claimed this:

>*""I'm with you..*

>*but then that makes you 'God'......which I'm not disputing, just enquiring into..*

>*if you're God....without telling anyone what to believe, what to think, and what to do....why haven't you saved the WORLD ?*

>*if I'm speaking to the SOURCE, then why are children still suffering...(and you can't say it's their lesson or their journey, because you stated that there is no Time or Self)*

>*so why would you, as God, allow this to still exist within your creation....or Eternal, Infinite, Timeless 'self'......???*

>*meaning no offense, but you don't sound like a very compassionate God..""*

There is some sentiment I've seen that, to get to the point where seeking ends, one must then become like God.

Or one becomes infinity. Or one becomes the all. Or one becomes the universe. One becomes something greater than this. Becoming Buddha. Becoming one with the cosmic. Cosmic consciousness. Cosmic awareness. Unity consciousness.

The above commenter is likely an extreme example of this, and tinged with some prior beliefs,

But ***THIS***? This thing (that isn't a thing) that I am pointing to? It's none of that. 

There is no becoming, because there is no self to become. The self is the illusion. The illusion cannot become what this is. There is no self to become anything.

Above all, there is no God here. There is no unity consciousness. No divine cosmic. No Buddhahood. No Christ Consciousness.

All of those are labels. Beliefs. Subtle attempts at the ego, the self, to have something to cling to. Something to attain. Something to seek, Something to acquire.

But this isn't some sacred state. It's not a state at all. It's indescribable for a reason and it is not something you can seek. The cosmic joke is real. When it is ""realized"", it becomes clear that nothing is actually ""realized. It's just a clear seeing. A clear being. There is no label. It's just seamless integration with what is.

And because it cannot be put into words, the words we use conflate these statements as something grandiose and ethereal. Yet it's not that at all. It's the most mundane, most apparent, most direct thing you're already experiencing (though, in a way, overlooking). So the mere saying of this makes it a thing for the ego to want.

You cannot want this. That's the joke. The self cannot want this. Because this is prior to wanting. And yet the self seeks anyway. Not a great punchline, but it never gets old.

There is no God here. There is no attainment. It's just this.

It's the pain. It's the sorrow. It's the joy. It's the aliveness. It's grief. It's anger. It's standing in a line at the chemist. It's hugging your relative at a family gathering. It's getting drunk at 3 am and arguing with a stranger. It's the birth of a newborn. It's the murder of a young child. It's the texture of lace and the smell of lilac. The taste of coffee and the smell of apples.

It's everything in complete fullness. It's also, when looked at closely, empty and nothing. Paradox exists because of binary thinking. It's everything and nothing.

But there is no God here.

It's full acceptance. Full acceptance for whatever is showing up. Whatever is appearing.

In this, there is compassion. Acceptance without judgement is a form of unconditional love. It is not the strong love of passion, or the deep love of family. It is a light, but infinitely deep love of everything, because everything is accepted.

There is no hope here, yet it is not hopeless. There is no excitement, yet there is still enjoyment of events.

But there is no God here.",4,1754910341.0,nonduality,8,0.83,False

1mn9y82,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mn9y82/she_said_she_could_bring_my_baby_back_all_i_had/,She said she could bring my baby back; all I had to do was feed what’s in the basement.,"When our little boy came into this world, the last thing my husband and I were thinking about was that in just over six months, he would be dead.

Our little man had breathing problems when he was born, they put him straight into the incubator for forty-eight hours. That was hard to watch. The terror you feel as a new parent is unmatched in those moments of staring your child's death in the face. You have had this little alien growing inside you for so long, you are its sole lifeforce, and now you stare at it, wondering if it was all for nothing.

We finally brought him home from the hospital, pink and ready to give us hell for the next 18 years. Probably longer. I so wished for longer.

Around six months later, there was a night where I just felt… off. Like something was wrong in our home's air, mother’s intuition, I suppose. I wish I had followed my gut. But I was just so tired. I went to sleep that night and was not waking for anything or anyone. Other parents will know how horrible and real sleep deprivation is. There is a reason that it’s used as an effective torture method. You will do anything, spill all the world's secrets just for a little bit of sleep. 

We had finally put our boy in another room around a week before this particular night, primarily because my husband snores like an elephant. It was so disruptive to the point that the dog began sleeping in the living room.

It was the first night I slept completely through in weeks. When I woke up that morning, I rolled over and felt rejuvenated in my mind. But my body felt tense. I felt that off feeling again and checked my phone; it was well past the time my son would normally wake. 

I checked the monitor, and my stomach dropped into an endless pit. The feeling when you're on a roller coaster, about to slam back into earth. 

He was lying face down, not moving. My heart rate rose like it was pumping on pure jet fuel.

I don’t exactly remember what happened next, just snippets. Fractures in time. 

I remember looking at the door to his room and hovering over the handle. I remember standing barefoot on his rug that I had slept on many nights before. I then found myself sitting on the rocking chair in the corner of his room, milk streaming out of me as I put his blue lips up to my warm skin. 

I rocked and swayed and whispered, ‘Wake up, baby, come on now, bubba, wake up, please.’ But he never did. 

At this point, I must have screamed, because my husband ran in. Thinking back, I feel sorry for him having to be exposed to this scene, and also angry at him, all at the same time. 

The last thing I remember was the paramedics trying to gently pry him from my hands. I put in a fight, my nails dug deep into his sleep sack, and I snarled, like some rabid animal. 

The next few weeks were also a bit of a blur. We found out the cause, SIDS, sudden Infant Death Syndrome. He rolled himself over in the middle of the night, and I was too sleep-deprived to notice him suffocating in the bedsheet. 

I didn’t know they made child-sized coffins; that was a shock. Well, I guess I did, but I never had thought about it. It was so small, so delicate. They lowered it into the hole, and that was the end of my life as I knew it. There was no redeeming, no coming to terms, no coming out of this hole. No reason to anymore.

My husband and I were not strong enough to begin with, and the fights after this were so intense that it led to his insisting that I go to a support group for other mothers who had gone through something similar. After a while of him insisting, he demanded with a divorce threat attached. I finally agreed. I knew I needed some help. I wasn't like one of these people in denial. I knew what happened and that it was my fault. 

The support group was filled mostly with other grieving mothers whose kids had succumbed to cancer. Another lady had her son pass in a car crash, his body so mangled that they wouldn’t even let her see him. Mine seemed like the most peaceful, which made me feel sick that others had it worse, even though my insides were rotting. 

I didn’t say much, I sat there listening, mostly. But, out of respect, I did share my name and briefly what happened, mentioning what I remembered anyway—the reason he was in there in the first place—the blue lips covered in breast milk—the paramedics. The others looked at me like mine wasn’t raw enough, horrific enough. I felt it too. Except for one older lady, she looked genuinely gutted for me. It felt nice.

Once it finished, and everyone started to disperse, I made my way to a little table with assorted sandwiches and cheap coffee. I stared at it for a long time. Probably not a good idea for them to have strawberry jam seeping out of the open bread like a mini crime scene. 

A hand grabbed onto my shoulder, and I spun around in fright. 

And that’s when I met her, Marla. 

She would have been in her late forties, maybe early fifties. You could tell just by looking at her that she has had a hard life. She has seen things behind those eyes. Real haunting pain.

She smiled at me like she had a deep understanding of what I was going through, and I started crying immediately. It was bizarre. I didn’t understand it, and she pulled me in for a hug like an old friend I haven’t seen in years. We stayed like that for far too long, but I didn’t want to let go. There was something about her, some sort of energy radiating from inside that made everything feel like it was going to be okay. 

We went for a walk together after, along the street and into the park. 

We sat on a bench and watched some other kids playing in the playground.

After sitting there in silence for a while, she said, ‘I know what happened, you know.’

I looked at her, a little taken aback. 

‘Sorry?’

‘I know that you're beating yourself up over this, but it’s not your fault. I know that, and I think you do too.’

I sat back and looked forward, lip quivering, and let her continue. 

‘I know your husband is to blame for this tragedy. I know that’s harsh, but I’m just being honest.’

I stood up and went to walk off, wiping away a tear, but then she said something that stopped me in my tracks. 

‘There is a way for your little boy to come back, you know.’

I slowly turned around, ready to go off on this lady. 

She stood and put her hands up in mock surrender. I think she could see the fire behind my eyes.

She quickly added, ‘Please believe me, there are ways. We have done it before. We have done it, and successfully too. Please, let me help you.’

I put my head in my hands and continued my breakdown. 

‘Why are you doing this to me? You're sick!’ I screamed at her.

She rushed up and grabbed me tight. I was shocked, confused—everything, all at once. 

I grabbed her and squeezed aggressively. ‘Why are you doing this to me? Who are you?’ 

She hugged me tightly, like a wall slowly crushing me. But it somehow calmed me. 

She whispered into my ear, ‘I know you don’t know me, but it will only work if you trust me. Do you trust me? You need to be one hundred per cent on board.’

I pulled away slowly and looked her up and down. She was smartly dressed, like she had just come from the local country club, not some cauldron-stirring witch. And weirdly, I did trust her; I really did think she was telling the truth, the truth as she knew it, anyway. 

We walked some distance together while she explained the process to me. She would need something of my boys, his favourite cuddly, a piece of clothing, anything that would still have a bit of ‘him’ left on it. She would take this for a few days, then at the next women’s group meeting, she would give this back to me, and I was to put it into the basement and lock the door until she gave me the next step. 

I did everything she asked. 

Once she returned the stuffed lamb he slept with, it went into the basement. I didn’t tell my husband, what would I say? I didn’t tell anyone about this. I didn’t question it myself. 

In my mind, it was harmless. If it worked, by some miracle, I would get my baby boy back, and if this lady was crazy, which I suspected almost certainly had to be the case, then I wasn’t losing anything, was I? 

A few nights passed, and nothing happened, and I thought I had been duped. I felt like an idiot. 

Until I heard a noise coming from the basement.

I was sleeping this night, and awoke to a chill in the air. It was as if my husband, now sleeping permanently in the guest bedroom, had blasted the AC just to torture me some more. I got up to turn it off, and heard an odd noise. It was coming from the basement. The noise was like a newborn crying into a pillow, muffled and faint. 

With my phone light out, I slowly made my way past the aircon panel, which was turned off, then headed toward the basement door. I was shaking and trying my best to steady my breathing. The floorboards squeaked below me, and the crying stopped. I gently put my ear up to the cold door and went to open it when my husband grabbed my shoulder.

‘Shit!’ I yelled at him as I jumped around, grabbing my chest. 

He looked at me like I was a runaway mental patient. For the first time, I saw true worry behind his eyes. 

He wrapped his arms around his body, hugging himself warm. ‘What the hell have you got the aircon on for?’

‘I didn’t put it on, I thought you did to piss me off,’ I joked. But he did not see it as funny.

He shook his head and walked off, huffing and puffing, ‘You seriously need help, woman, honestly, I don't know what to do anymore.’

I went to walk after him, to plead my case and argue, as always, but I felt like my feet were stuck. I let him go.

Instead, I called Marla and whispered, letting her know what was happening, hoping she could make some light of this.

I could feel her smiling on the other end of the line. Pure happiness in each word. ‘Oh, this is just such great news, hun. Now you feed it.’

The words were there, but wouldn't come out, only fragments. ‘I… It?’

‘Sorry, I misspoke, you feed him–your baby boy. Oh, this is just so wonderful.’

‘Hold up, what do you mean? What is down there?’ I asked, looking at the door.

‘Just follow my rules, do not, under any circumstances, open the door until I tell you to. You understand that, right? Lock it and hide the key so your husband doesn't go in there. This is very important.’

I had forgotten about this crucial part. 

‘Yes, of course,’ I lied. 

‘Good. Now, you need to listen to that noise, your milk will begin coming back in shortly, it's nature. Do not fight it, pump and put it in a ziplock bag, slide it under the door four to five times a day, let him guide you with his noises. Let me know when there are any more… occurrences.’

‘What do you mean? What will happen? How will he get into the bag?’

There were far too many questions and unknowns. 

‘He will know what to do, don't worry. As for the occurrences… You will know when it happens. I am so happy for you, hun. Get some sleep. This is going to be an exhausting but beautiful journey ahead.’

The line went dead.

She was right, the next day I woke with a sharp pain in my breast, like someone was stabbing me slowly with a butcher's knife. I looked down, and my shirt was drenched from the milk seeping out. My breasts were rock hard. During the night, my body must have responded to the faint cries. It was incredibly painful to touch; it happened far quicker than last time.

My husband never questioned anything during the next week. I was pumping in the bathroom, door locked and with the shower on, wanting to scream at the pain I was experiencing. 

I don't know what my husband thought during this time, but he began staying even later at the office, we needed the money. And eventually he began sleeping a few nights at his parents' house. He said it was closer to the office, which it was, but I could see what was happening. I didn’t care. This just gave me more of a chance to express in comfort.

I was well aware of how crazy this all sounded, but the crying, it was… It sounded just like his perfect little cry. It was his cry. Even my body knew it. 

My husband packed up and left around a month later. 

I didn’t blame him. By this point, I had gone a little nuts. I remodelled the baby's room and got it back looking like a newborn was about to occupy it. I bought new clothes and replaced some of the toys we gave away. 

I gave in and told him about what I was doing. There was no hiding it anymore. He packed his bag so fast that I don't think he really packed anything he needed. He was moving back full-time with his parents while he sorted out what he wanted to do. How he looked at me was so horrible. Like I was disgusting. His eyes told me that he didn't know me anymore. 

I was doing this for him as well as myself, he was going to get our baby back, too. Why wouldn't he support me through this? It was for us to be whole again. 

He said that he couldn't hear the cries, but he just wasn't listening hard enough. They were there, but he just blanked them out because he was determined to move on. 

At one point, I even began doubting it all. I thought I was going crazy, but one day my doubts were crushed, and from then on I knew I was sane. I went to put some fresh milk under the door, and found a single tooth. A little milk tooth. It was his, so small and sweet. I put it into its own little box. I was so excited, I couldn't sleep, so I sat by the door all night, just listening, sometimes singing lullabies. The stretching noises, the sweet cries and coos. I just wish I could open the door and go down there, cuddle him and let it all be okay. 

The last call I had with Marla was just before the neighbour's kid went missing. 

She let me know that it was almost time, my baby was almost ready to come back to us, to this crazy world. There was just one more thing that needed to happen, a life for a life. 

He needed a body to come back into, a healthy vessel to occupy. I felt sick, I wanted to hang up, I wanted to kill her for putting me through all of this without telling me this final, horrific step first. 

I wanted to. But I couldn’t. I didn’t.

I asked for more specifics; maybe there was a workaround. 

My thoughts went dark, like, ‘How long does a body last embalmed in a coffin? I could dig him up?’

She said it would only work with a live child. ‘You wouldn't want your kid to look like they had been in a coffin for months, bugs eating holes in the skin, now would you?’ She said.

I almost spewed at the image in my mind. It made sense, but I also know what it feels like to lose your child, surely I couldn't do that to another family, to another mother. I declined, and then she said something that chilled me to my core. 

‘Once the process has begun, there is no stopping it. You must finish, or what you create will be something you will regret for the rest of your life.’

I hung the phone up. 

I made my way back to my room, unsure about my future with this experiment. Then I started to hear scratching sounds coming from outside the basement door. He must have grown his little fingernails, which struck me as odd. It should not happen at this age, not ones big enough to scratch the door like a manic cat. 

I locked myself in my room, but could still hear the faint scratching noises all night. Then the crying began. And so did the milk. She was right, there was no stopping this. 

And today, coming home from the grocery store where I bought some more supplies, diapers and the like, I saw the police consoling and comforting the neighbours. 

My stomach dropped. Seeing her face transported me back to the morning I found my boy face-first. I was about to vomit on my front steps and ran into the house, hoping to God they didn’t see me. 

I slowly walked over to the basement door and sat against it. I could hear faint breathing, and then the cries started right on cue. I started pumping, mechanical and numb, milk hissing into the bottle. I sat there with no expression, it's where I am currently sitting now, still pumping, still waiting, still writing my story, still holding out to hold my boy again. 

The smell of roasting meat wafted from the kitchen, and Marla came into the doorway. ‘Don't worry about them,' she said, 'I will help them get their boy back... in good time. For now, just keep feeding him, you are doing amazing.’ 

Something thumped against the door behind me. Not a knock, more like a little skull testing the wood. Little fingers pushed through the gap near the floor. They were cold, slick, nails black with dirt.

'Soon,' Marla murmured, stirring her pot. 'Your beautiful boy will be free. This one’s growing faster than the last.”'

Marla had started to hum a nursery rhyme, and he began humming it back from behind the door. I had not heard that one before. It’s like it was something meant just for us.

I smiled and leaned my head against the door, grabbing his fingers and whispering, ‘See you soon, my beautiful baby boy.’ 

The fingers curled tighter around mine and didn’t let go.

1mn9waz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mn9waz/aita_for_planning_to_end_a_friendship_where_i_was/,AITA for planning to end a friendship where i was the asshole?,"I 24w had a best friend 24w, lets call her Jen. we met at work and gradually became friends, even tho she didnt like me in the beginning. We were best friends for about 2.5 years. Spent a lot of time, had many great deep talks, helped eachother through tough times. Now the whole thing started in june, where Jen out of the blue invited me to grab food and talk, because she had something serious to talk to me about. basically what she said is that she feels like im retraumatizing her and she feels drained every time we meet. she has felt like this for a while now and she cant understand how someone who calls herself a friend, can be so mean. Basically what i did was continuously comment on physical appereances of hers. Like when she showed me pants she wants to buy id say ""do you have the butt for that? haha"" or when i would talk about the breast reduction i want to get id say ""but i dont want them as small as yours"". Admittedly that is very mean and no trauma i suffered, would excuse my behavior. 

I apologized profously and promised to better myself. I gave her time and space, every now and then i checked in with her and for a month it seemed to get better, texted here and there and even met up for coffee once. we continued to see eachother in our friendgroup and we were somewhat distant but it was okay.

 now recently since my birthday in early july, she grew aloof and passive aggressive towards me, and two days ago we met up in the friend group and she kept insulting me/making little jabs disguised as jokes. i stayed polite and friendly, because i didnt want our friendgroup to be involved in whatever is going on between us.

i texted her the day after, whether she is angry at me and to please tell me what i did. she replied she wants to meet up tonight to talk about it, again saying that there is ""stuff she needs to say to me"".

right now im thinking about ending my friendship with her for good, but id also risk of losing all the other friends, because she kind of was my tie to them. 

What pmo is that she knew i have a somewhat crude humor for all the time we knew eachother, i can be mean and i know it, she knew it too, saying stuff like ""thats just how you are"" and ""others dont understand you're just joking"". i can be very direct and overly honest, and sometimes im unable to read the room. BUT i say on a regular basis to everyone im close to, including her, that if i am too mean or if what i say genuinely hurts someone, to please tell me. never ONCE did she tell me ""hey, that really hurt me, id appreciate if you wouldnt say such things"" i make mean jokes about everyone including myself, its not like im just degrading everyone to uplift myself and call it humor. my humor only became a problem a few months ago (when her ex-bsf came back into her life) but it was okay for her for two years before that. but despite us having a very open communication, whenever we didnt like eachothers behavior (talk, apologize and done), her knowing me and how i am, and also me giving more than one opportunity to tell me she is not okay with me making those jokes, she kept it in and never gave me a chance to change before more or less ending the friendship. i tried fighting for it and showing her i can change and be gentler if thats what she needs. but i feel like she switched up on me. im scared this is beyond repair. 

honestly i dont get it, i feel hurt, because yes i was an asshole in that regard, i admitted that, i apologized and i changed, but other than that i was always there for her and id consider myself a great friend. id go out of my way to take care and feed her cats whenever she needed me to even on short notice. we always did the stuff she wanted to do when we met up, i was just always happy to be in her company. We deeptalked so much, we talked about all the trauma we experienced. we were sisters in a sense. And when she would actually talk about her insecurities to me in a serious manner, i would be the first one to to comfort her and try to make her feel better.

but honestly, treating me like i am a shit person , without telling me what i did now... seeing no effort to mend things and reconnect. it makes me angry and hurt. I dont know if i can hold up the effort to make things right again if she refuses me a genuine chance, but also not ending the friendship for real. she leaves me hanging, giving me hope that things can be okay again, but then also treating me like an outcast.

i dont know if i can do it anymore.

so, AITA?



  
PS: sorry if this is somewhat hard to understand, english isnt my first language and i am very emotional right now.",1,1754910079.0,AITAH,8,0.67,False

""Lennox, sweetheart, I'm not asking you to just hand over your engagement to Raina for free. Of course there'll be compensation...""

Something cold flickered in Lennox's eyes as her lips curved into a mocking smile.  
  
  
""I want a billion—""  
  
  
""A billion? Are you lost your mind!?"" Before she could finish, her father's face flushed deep red, veins throbbing at his temples.  
  
  
Lennox casually tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, completing her sentence with deliberate calm: ""Plus, I want you to cut all ties. No more father-daughter bullshit.""  
  
  
Her father's expression changed drastically, his pointing finger shaking: ""You bastard! Do you know what you're saying?""  
  
  
""Of course I do!""  
  
  
Lennox looked up, her eyes churning with bone-deep hatred. ""From the day you cheated during my mother's pregnancy and caused her death along with her unborn child, you lost the right to be my father!""  
  
  
""Besides, Raina's the only daughter you've ever cared about anyway. You're willing to force me out of my own engagement for her sake. So really, what's the difference if we make this official?""  
  
  
""Two conditions. Not one less."" She leaned forward slightly, impatience creeping into her voice. ""Just tell me—yes or no?""  
  
  
Her father's face turned ashen, his chest heaving with rage. After a long pause, he spat through gritted teeth: ""Fine! Cut ties then! Don't come crawling back! I need time for the billion, but I have a condition too—""  
  
  
""That Montgomery heir is quite taken with you. To ensure Raina can marry him smoothly, you must get out of the country within a month and never come back!""  
  
  
Those words hit Lennox like a physical blow.  
  
  
She couldn't tell what hurt more—seeing how far her father would go for Raina, or hearing him say ""that Montgomery heir is quite taken with you.""  
  
  
Her lips barely moved as she whispered: ""No... he's not.""  
  
  
""What did you say?"" Her father didn't catch it and instinctively pressed.  
  
  
Lennox lowered her gaze, hiding the coldness in her eyes, her voice flat and emotionless: ""Nothing. One month. Billion dollars in my account. I'll handle the paperwork and disappear from your lives forever.""  
  
  
She turned and headed for the door, only to freeze when she saw Hayes Montgomery and Raina walking side by side.  
  
  
The two were chatting and laughing, looking quite intimate.  
  
  
She still remembered when Hayes first met Raina—pure disgust written all over his face.  
  
  
When Raina tried to get close, he'd grabbed her throat with one hand until she nearly suffocated, warning coldly: ""Back off.""  
  
  
But now? Now he was looking at her like she hung the moon.His heart had already turned to Raina, even back then.  
  
  
The realization tore through Lennox like broken glass, leaving her numb and breathless.  
  
  
Memories from her past life flooded back.  
  
  
Her mother, driven to her death along with her unborn child, while her father brought his mistress and bastard daughter into their home. Lennox, treated like dirt under their feet.  
  
  
It was Hayes, bound to her by engagement, who'd stormed into that house and pulled her out of the windowless room where they'd locked her up, beaten and broken.  
  
  
From that moment, Hayes and the Montgomery family became her lifeline.  
  
  
He'd wrapped her in his protection like armor. Her family feared the Montgomery power but craved the social elevation this marriage would bring, constantly pushing for Raina to take her place.  
  
  
But how could Lennox ever agree?  
  
  
How could she give up the one thing her mother had secured for her—a friendship-sealed engagement that was her mother's final gift to this world?  
  
  
She'd fought off every threat, every bribe.  
  
  
Unwilling to give up, Raina had even stripped naked and climbed into Hayes's room, only to be thrown out mercilessly.  
  
  
On the wedding day, Raina had threatened suicide, clinging to his leg and wailing, ultimately jumping into the sea in front of everyone, seemingly perishing without a trace.  
  
  
Lennox thought that with Raina gone, she and Hayes could live peacefully.  
  
  
For three years, they were. Or so she'd believed.  
  
  
Until that day she'd seen them on the street—Hayes and Raina wrapped in each other's arms, with a two-year-old child.  
  
  
Raina wasn't dead. Hayes had hidden her elsewhere, and they even had a child together.  
  
  
Before she could confront them, an out-of-control truck came barreling toward her.  
  
  
As her body was crushed beneath the wheels, she'd caught Hayes looking her way. Those eyes that had once held such warmth for her were now cold as winter stone.  
  
  
In her final moments, one thought had burned through the pain:  
  
  
If she ever got another chance, she would fulfill Hayes and Raina as the ""loving couple"" they were. She was done being anyone's fool!  
  
  
""Lennie!""  
  
  
Hayes's voice snapped her back to the present.  
  
  
His whole face lit up when he spotted her, like she'd just made his entire day. That look used to make her feel like the center of his universe.  
  
  
Now she knew he'd perfected that same expression for someone else.  
  
  
Hayes reached for her hand with familiar ease: ""One month to go! I came to take you for your final dress fitting!""  
  
  
Lennox stared at his outstretched hand, but all she could see was those same fingers intertwined with Raina's.  
  
  
Her stomach twisted. She smoothly sidestepped his reach, giving him a curt ""Fine"" before brushing past him.  
  
  
Hayes blinked at his empty hand, confused but not alarmed. Probably just wedding stress, he figured, jogging to catch up.  
  
  
As she passed Raina, the girl's fingers caught her sleeve with practiced hesitation:  
  
  
""Sis, could I... come with you two for the dress fitting?""  
  
  
Lennox looked at the carefully disguised meekness in her eyes and suddenly smiled.  
  
  
""Sure.""  
  
  
""No!""  
  
  
Two voices rang out simultaneously.  
  
  
Hayes looked at Lennox in shock, his eyes full of confusion: ""Lennie, don't you hate... her the most?""  
  
  
""Why...""  
  
  
Lennox sneered inwardly.  
  
  
Why?  
  
  
Because in exactly one month, the one walking down that aisle in white, it would only be Raina.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
The Rolls-Royce cut through traffic as Hayes glanced at Raina riding shotgun, then leaned into Lennox's ear.  
  
  
""Babe, since when do you want her tagging along?""  
  
  
Lennox watched that familiar crease appear between his brows, the way his jaw tightened whenever Raina came up—like she was nothing but a nuisance to him.  
  
  
What a performance.  
  
  
So damn good he'd had her completely fooled for three years. Right up until she saw that toddler on the street and realized their entire relationship was built on lies.  
  
  
Lennox's voice came out flat: ""You're always complaining about how clingy she is, right? Maybe seeing you marry me will finally make her back off.""  
  
  
Something unreadable flashed across Hayes's face. His lips parted as if to say something, but he just swallowed hard and let her explanation stand.  
  
  
At the bridal boutique, Hayes escorted Lennox inside with Raina trailing behind them.  
  
  
The dress had been waiting for months—champagne silk and hand-sewn crystals that caught the light like captured stars.  
  
  
The stylist had barely lifted it from the garment bag when Raina pushed forward, her fingers already reaching for the delicate beadwork.  
  
  
""It's so beautiful,"" she breathed, drinking in every detail. After a long moment, she turned to Lennox: ""Could I... try it on? Just once?""  
  
  
Lennox took in that perfectly crafted innocent act and felt ice settle in her chest.  
  
  
She could give up the engagement, but her things? Hell no.  
  
  
Her red lips curved into a cutting smile: ""What's next—you gonna sleep in my bed too? Or is following in mommy's homewrecking footsteps enough for one day?""  
  
  
The color drained from Raina's face. She turned those wounded doe eyes toward Hayes, silently begging for rescue.  
  
  
Hayes went rigid. He stepped between them, his hand finding Lennox's elbow. ""Len, come on. People are staring. Let's just get you fitted, yeah?""  
  
  
The gesture looked like peacekeeping, but it put Raina squarely under his protection.  
  
  
Lennox stared at his tense posture and smiled coldly, taking the dress and disappearing into the fitting room.  
  
  
Standing before the mirror in the gown, Lennox felt momentarily displaced.  
  
  
Her reflection was luminous—bright eyes, flawless skin like porcelain against the ivory silk. The last time she'd stood here, her heart had been full of dreams for the future.  
  
  
Now she just felt empty.  
  
  
""Oh!""  
  
  
Raina's startled cry came from outside. Lennox cracked the curtain just enough to peek through.  
  
  
Raina had ""tripped"" over her own feet, tumbling straight into Hayes's arms.  
  
  
And Hayes? He didn't even try to step back. Just caught her like he'd been expecting it, one hand splayed across her lower back while the other smoothed her hair.  
  
  
Even knowing what she knew, seeing it hit like a sucker punch to the gut.  
  
  
She remembered when Hayes used to act like Raina had the plague—literally burning clothes if she so much as brushed against him.  
  
  
But now?  
  
  
Now he was tenderly comforting the woman in his arms. They looked more like the engaged couple than Lennox did, hidden away in her fitting room.  
  
  
Her grip on the curtain tightened until her knuckles went white, something sharp and brutal squeezing her chest.  
  
  
She took a deep breath and started to push through the curtain when the world suddenly tilted sideways, everything swaying violently.  
  
  
Earthquake!  
  
  
Pure instinct kicked in. She grabbed fistfuls of silk and bolted for the exit.  
  
  
But the train wrapped around her ankles like a trap. She went down hard, fabric tearing, skin scraping against marble. Glass and plaster rained down, each impact sending fresh shockwaves through her already battered body.  
  
  
Hayes was right there. Maybe fifteen feet away. He looked straight through her, swept Raina off her feet, and ran.  
  
  
Their voices drifted back as they fled:  
  
  
""Hayes, wait—what about Lennox?""  
  
  
""She's fine. You're hurt—I need to get you checked out...""  
  
  
Those words hit like a physical blow, stealing the air from her lungs.  
  
  
When the shaking finally stopped, the boutique looked like a war zone.  
  
  
Just like her heart.  
  
  
Lennox stripped off the ruined gown and grabbed a pair of scissors, cutting it to shreds with methodical precision.  
  
  
On her way out, she fixed the shell-shocked staff with a cold stare: ""Don't tell Hayes.""  
  
  
Raina could have her wedding. But anything that had been Lennox's? She'd burn it all before handing it over to those two.  
  
  
From the boutique, Lennox went straight to Immigration Services and filed for expedited processing.  
  
  
The clerk glanced at the blood on her arm and nodded: ""We can have everything ready within the month.""  
  
  
Standing outside, Lennox breathed in the gray afternoon air.  
  
  
One month, and she'd be free of this city forever.  
  
  
Free to finally live for herself.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
Lennox skipped going home and drove straight to her apartment downtown.  
  
  
By the time she collapsed into bed, it was past midnight.  
  
  
Hayes hadn't called. Not once.  
  
  
No ""are you okay?"" No explanation. Nothing.  
  
  
She stared at her phone until her eyes burned, then finally threw it aside and crashed.  
  
  
The next morning, she woke to voices and heavy footsteps. Stumbling out of her bedroom, she found Hayes directing a team of movers like he owned the place.  
  
  
The second he spotted her, he rushed over with that familiar guilty smile.  
  
  
""Hey babe, sorry about yesterday. Work emergency—had to bolt. Didn't even realize there was an earthquake until later. You're okay though, right?""  
  
  
Lennox stared at him—this man who could lie straight to her face without missing a beat—and felt something twist in her chest.  
  
  
He knew damn well he owed her an explanation for yesterday, yet he chose to cover up the fact that he'd abandoned her at the earthquake site with this pathetic lie.  
  
  
Why? If he loved Raina so much, why keep up this charade?  
  
  
Did he think she was that easy to fool?Or was he just addicted to having it all?  
  
  
When she didn't bite, Hayes sighed and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear.  
  
  
""I know you're mad. So I brought reinforcements."" He nodded toward the boxes. ""Tiffany's finest. Call it my 'I'm an asshole' tax. Okay?""  
  
  
His phone lit up before she could answer. Whatever he saw made his jaw clench.  
  
  
""Fuck. Crisis mode again."" He was already backing toward the door. ""Can we do this later? I really gotta bounce.""  
  
  
Gone before she could say a word.  
  
  
The apartment fell quiet except for the movers shuffling around boxes of guilt gifts.  
  
  
Her phone pinged. Social media notification.  
  
  
Raina had posted a photo—expensive jewelry scattered across silk sheets, a man's handjust visible in the corner. Lennox knew that signet ring. She had the matching set.  
  
  
Same jewelry Hayes had just ""bought"" for her. Same hands that had just touched her face.  
  
  
The air left her lungs in a rush.  
  
  
This was Hayes's version of love—a fucking timeshare.  
  
  
""Ma'am? Everything's unpacked. Want to check it out?""  
  
  
The delivery guy's voice snapped her back to reality.  
  
  
She looked at the jewelry covering her coffee table and something cold settled in her chest.  
  
  
""Sell it. All of it.""  
  
  
His sloppy seconds? Hard pass.  
  
  
Twenty minutes after they left,, Hayes started calling.  
  
  
She let every call go to voicemail until he finally texted:\[If the jewelry's not your style, we'll pick something else together.\]  
  
  
Lennox deleted it and scrolled to her best friend instead. If she was bailing on this city, Suri deserved a goodbye.  
  
  
That evening, she met Suri at their usual bar. When Lennox mentioned leaving the country, Suri nearly choked on her martini.  
  
  
""You're what? What about Hayes?""  
  
  
A few drinks in, Lennox's words came out flat and emotionless: ""I'm calling off the engagement.""  
  
  
""Are you insane?"" Suri shot up in her seat.  
  
  
""That's Hayes Kingston! The man's obsessed with you—""  
  
  
""No."" Lennox's voice was hoarse. ""He doesn't. And I'm not crazy.""  
  
  
The image flashed again—Hayes with that little boy, Raina curled against his side like she belonged there. The memory hit like a physical blow.  
  
  
She was done being anyone's second choice.  
  
  
Suri looked ready to stage an intervention, but Lennox stood up. ""Bathroom break. Back in five.""  
  
  
Walking past the VIP section, a familiar voice stopped her cold.  
  
  
Through the cracked door, she could see Hayes lounging in the shadows, features barely visible in the low light.  
  
  
But the woman that was wearing a white dress pressed against his side was Raina!

My father is trying to convince me to give my fiancé to my stepsister Raina.  
“Deal, I want ten billion, plus severing our father-daughter relationship.”  
Once, my beloved fiancé Hayes was my only support.    
He rescued me from the abuse of my stepmother and stepsister.    
I thought it was a gift from fate.    
Until the day of the wedding, when Raina jumped into the sea and “committed suicide”.  
But three years later, I bumped into them on the street, holding a two-year-old child.    
It turned out they had been secretly involved all along.    
As the truck barreled toward me, I saw Hayes's icy gaze.    
Now, I saw Hayes and Raina walking in together, and I smiled.    
This time, I decided to grant their wish.    
I would no longer be anyone's substitute.  
  
""Lennox, sweetheart, I'm not asking you to just hand over your engagement to Raina for free. Of course there'll be compensation...""  
  
The familiar voice wrapped around her ears.   
  
Lennox struggled through the tearing pain and forced her eyes open, suddenly realizing—  
  
She was reborn!  
  
Back to one month before her wedding to Hayes Montgomery!  
  
As she looked down, she caught sight of her father—Alaric Thorne's furrowed brow, that earnest expression—exactly the same as when he'd pressured her to give up her engagement the first time.  
  
""Deal.""  
  
Lennox's voice came out rough, cutting him off mid-guilt-trip.  
  
Her father froze, looking up at her with undisguised joy in his eyes. ""Lennox! Thank God, you've finally come around!""  
  
Something cold flickered in Lennox's eyes as her lips curved into a mocking smile.  
  
""I want a billion—""  
  
""A billion? Are you lost your mind!?"" Before she could finish, her father's face flushed deep red, veins throbbing at his temples.  
  
Lennox casually tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, completing her sentence with deliberate calm: ""Plus, I want you to cut all ties. No more father-daughter nonsense.""  
  
Her father's expression changed drastically, his pointing finger shaking: ""You asshole! Do you know what you're saying?""  
  
""Of course I do!""  
  
Lennox looked up, her eyes churning with bone-deep hatred. ""From the day you cheated during my mother's pregnancy and caused her death along with her unborn child, you lost the right to be my father!""  
  
""Besides, Raina's the only daughter you've ever cared about anyway. You're willing to force me out of my own engagement for her sake. So really, what's the difference if we make this official?""  
  
""Two conditions. Not one less."" She leaned forward slightly, impatience creeping into her voice. ""Just tell me—yes or no?""  
  
Her father's face turned ashen, his ch//est heaving with rage. After a long pause, he spat through gritted teeth: ""Fine! Cut ties then! Don't come crawling back! I need time for the billion, but I have a condition too—""  
  
""That Montgomery heir is quite taken with you. To ensure Raina can marry him smoothly, you must get out of the country within a month and never come back!""  
  
Those words hit Lennox like a physical blow.  
  
She couldn't tell what hurt more—seeing how far her father would go for Raina, or hearing him say ""that Montgomery heir is quite taken with you.""  
  
Her lips barely moved as she whispered: ""No... he's not.""  
  
""What did you say?"" Her father didn't catch it and instinctively pressed.  
  
Lennox lowered her gaze, hiding the coldness in her eyes, her voice flat and emotionless: ""Nothing. One month. Billion dollars in my account. I'll handle the paperwork and disappear from your lives forever.""  
  
She turned and headed for the door, only to freeze when she saw Hayes Montgomery and Raina walking side by side.  
  
The two were chatting and laughing, looking quite intimate.  
  
She still remembered when Hayes first met Raina—pure disgust written all over his face.  
  
When Raina tried to get close, he'd grabbed her throat with one hand until she nearly suffocated, warning coldly: ""Back off.""  
  
But now? Now he was looking at her like she hung the moon.His heart had already turned to Raina, even back then.  
  
The realization tore through Lennox like broken glass, leaving her numb and breathless.  
  
Memories from her past life flooded back.  
  
Her mother, driven to her death along with her unborn child, while her father brought his mistress and ba//stard daughter into their home. Lennox, treated like dirt under their feet.  
  
It was Hayes, bound to her by engagement, who'd stormed into that house and pulled her out of the windowless room where they'd locked her up, beaten and broken.  
  
From that moment, Hayes and the Montgomery family became her lifeline.  
  
He'd wrapped her in his protection like armor. Her family feared the Montgomery power but craved the social elevation this marriage would bring, constantly pushing for Raina to take her place.  
  
But how could Lennox ever agree?  
  
How could she give up the one thing her mother had secured for her—a friendship-sealed engagement that was her mother's final gift to this world?  
  
She'd fought off every threat, every bribe.  
  
Unwilling to give up, Raina had even stripped bare and climbed into Hayes's room, only to be thrown out mercilessly.  
  
On the wedding day, Raina had threatened suicide, clinging to his leg and wailing, ultimately jumping into the sea in front of everyone, seemingly perishing without a trace.  
  
Lennox thought that with Raina gone, she and Hayes could live peacefully.  
  
For three years, they were. Or so she'd believed.  
  
Until that day she'd seen them on the street—Hayes and Raina wrapped in each other's arms, with a two-year-old child.  
  
Raina wasn't dead. Hayes had hidden her elsewhere, and they even had a child together.  
  
Before she could confront them, an out-of-control truck came barreling toward her.  
  
As her body was crushed beneath the wheels, she'd caught Hayes looking her way. Those eyes that had once held such warmth for her were now cold as winter stone.  
  
In her final moments, one thought had bu//rned through the pain:  
  
If she ever got another chance, she would fulfill Hayes and Raina as the ""loving couple"" they were. She was done being anyone's fool!  
  
""Lennie!""  
  
Hayes's voice snapped her back to the present.  
  
His whole face lit up when he spotted her, like she'd just made his entire day. That look used to make her feel like the center of his universe.  
  
Now she knew he'd perfected that same expression for someone else.  
  
Hayes reached for her hand with familiar ease: ""One month to go! I came to take you for your final dress fitting!""  
  
Lennox stared at his outstretched hand, but all she could see was those same fingers intertwined with Raina's.  
  
Her stomach twisted. She smoothly sidestepped his reach, giving him a curt ""Fine"" before brushing past him.  
  
Hayes blinked at his empty hand, confused but not alarmed. Probably just wedding stress, he figured, jogging to catch up.  
  
As she passed Raina, the girl's fingers caught her sleeve with practiced hesitation:  
  
""Sis, could I... come with you two for the dress fitting?""  
  
Lennox looked at the carefully disguised meekness in her eyes and suddenly smiled.  
  
""Sure.""  
  
""No!""  
  
Two voices rang out simultaneously.  
  
Hayes looked at Lennox in shock, his eyes full of confusion: ""Lennie, don't you hate... her the most?""  
  
""Why...""  
  
Lennox sneered inwardly.  
  
Why?  
  
Because in exactly one month, the one walking down that aisle in white, it would only be Raina.  
  
The Rolls-Royce cut through traffic as Hayes glanced at Raina riding shotgun, then leaned into Lennox's ear.  
  
""Babe, since when do you want her tagging along?""  
  
Lennox watched that familiar crease appear between his brows, the way his jaw tightened whenever Raina came up—like she was nothing but a nuisance to him.  
  
What a performance.  
  
So good he'd had her completely fooled for three years. Right up until she saw that toddler on the street and realized their entire relationship was built on lies.  
  
Lennox's voice came out flat: ""You're always complaining about how clingy she is, right? Maybe seeing you marry me will finally make her back off.""  
  
Something unreadable flashed across Hayes's face. His lips parted as if to say something, but he just swallowed hard and let her explanation stand.  
  
At the bridal boutique, Hayes escorted Lennox inside with Raina trailing behind them.  
  
The dress had been waiting for months—champagne silk and hand-sewn crystals that caught the light like captured stars.  
  
The stylist had barely lifted it from the garment bag when Raina pushed forward, her fingers already reaching for the delicate beadwork.  
  
""It's so beautiful,"" she breathed, drinking in every detail. After a long moment, she turned to Lennox: ""Could I... try it on? Just once?""  
  
Lennox took in that perfectly crafted innocent act and felt ice settle in her heart.  
  
She could give up the engagement, but her things? No.  
  
Her red lips curved into a cutting smile: ""What's next—you gonna sleep in my bed too? Or is following in mommy's homewrecking footsteps enough for one day?""  
  
The color drained from Raina's face. She turned those wounded doe eyes toward Hayes, silently begging for rescue.  
  
Hayes went rigid. He stepped between them, his hand finding Lennox's elbow. ""Len, come on. People are staring. Let's just get you fitted, yeah?""  
  
The gesture looked like peacekeeping, but it put Raina squarely under his protection.  
  
Lennox stared at his tense posture and smiled coldly, taking the dress and disappearing into the fitting room.  
  
Standing before the mirror in the gown, Lennox felt momentarily displaced.  
  
Her reflection was luminous—bright eyes, flawless skin like porcelain against the ivory silk. The last time she'd stood here, her heart had been full of dreams for the future.  
  
Now she just felt empty.  
  
""Oh!""  
  
Raina's startled cry came from outside. Lennox cracked the curtain just enough to peek through.  
  
Raina had ""tripped"" over her own feet, tumbling straight into Hayes's arms.  
  
And Hayes? He didn't even try to step back. Just caught her like he'd been expecting it, one hand splayed across her lower back while the other smoothed her hair.  
  
Even knowing what she knew, seeing it hit like a sucker punch to the gut.  
  
She remembered when Hayes used to act like Raina had the plague—literally bu//rning clothes if she so much as brushed against him.  
  
But now?  
  
Now he was tenderly comforting the woman in his arms. They looked more like the engaged couple than Lennox did, hidden away in her fitting room.  
  
Her grip on the curtain tightened until her knuckles went white, something sharp and brutal squeezing her heart.  
  
She took a deep breath and started to push through the curtain when the world suddenly tilted sideways, everything swaying violently.  
  
Earthquake!  
  
Pure instinct kicked in. She grabbed fistfuls of silk and bolted for the exit.  
  
But the train wrapped around her ankles like a trap. She went down hard, fabric tearing, skin scraping against marble. Glass and plaster rained down, each impact sending fresh shockwaves through her already battered body.  
  
Hayes was right there. Maybe fifteen feet away. He looked straight through her, swept Raina off her feet, and ran.  
  
Their voices drifted back as they fled:  
  
""Hayes, wait—what about Lennox?""  
  
""She's fine. You're hurt—I need to get you checked out...""  
  
Those words hit like a physical blow, stealing the air from her lungs.  
  
When the shaking finally stopped, the boutique looked like a war zone.  
  
Just like her heart.  
  
Lennox stripped off the ruined gown and grabbed a pair of scissors, cutting it to shreds with methodical precision.  
  
On her way out, she fixed the shell-shocked staff with a cold stare: ""Don't tell Hayes.""  
  
Raina could have her wedding. But anything that had been Lennox's? She'd bu//rn it all before handing it over to those two.  
  
From the boutique, Lennox went straight to Immigration Services and filed for expedited processing.  
  
The clerk glanced at the blood on her arm and nodded: ""We can have everything ready within the month.""  
  
Standing outside, Lennox breathed in the gray afternoon air.  
  
One month, and she'd be free of this city forever.   
  
Free to finally live for herself.  
  
Lennox skipped going home and drove straight to her apartment downtown.  
  
By the time she collapsed into bed, it was past midnight.  
  
Hayes hadn't called. Not once.  
  
No ""are you okay?"" No explanation. Nothing.  
  
She stared at her phone until her eyes bu//rned, then finally threw it aside and crashed.  
  
The next morning, she woke to voices and heavy footsteps. Stumbling out of her bedroom, she found Hayes directing a team of movers like he owned the place.  
  
The second he spotted her, he rushed over with that familiar guilty smile.  
  
""Hey babe, sorry about yesterday. Work emergency—had to bolt. Didn't even realize there was an earthquake until later. You're okay though, right?""  
  
Lennox stared at him—this man who could lie straight to her face without missing a beat—and felt something twist in her heart.  
  
He knew he owed her an explanation for yesterday, yet he chose to cover up the fact that he'd abandoned her at the earthquake site with this pathetic lie.  
  
Why? If he loved Raina so much, why keep up this charade?

Twenty minutes after they left,, Hayes started calling.   
  
She let every call go to voicemail until he finally texted:\[If the jewelry's not your style, we'll pick something else together.\]

She was done being anyone's second choice.  
  
Suri looked ready to stage an intervention, but Lennox stood up. ""Bathroom break. Back in five.""  
  
Walking past the VIP section, a familiar voice stopped her cold.  
  
Through the cracked door, she could see Hayes lounging in the shadows, features barely visible in the low light.  
  
But the woman that was wearing a white dress pressed against his side was Raina!  
  
Lennox felt like she'd been struck by lightning.  
  
Watching Raina laugh and joke with Hayes's crew like they were old friends—this clearly wasn't her first rodeo with his inner circle.  
  
When had he brought her into the fold?  
  
And Lennox had been completely clueless.  
  
All those times his buddies called her ""Mrs. Montgomery"" to her face—were they laughing behind her back? Pitying the poor fool who didn't even know her own fiancé had checked out?  
  
Her nails bit into her palms as she watched the scene unfold.  
  
Truth or dare was in full swing, the bottle pointing straight at Raina.  
  
Whatever challenge they'd thrown at her had the whole table chanting ""Drink! Drink! Drink!"" But one look at Raina's wide, helpless eyes and Hayes was snatching the shot glass, downing it himself.  
  
""Enough."" His voice cut through the noise. ""Raina's not feeling great. Stop fooling around.""  
  
More knowing laughter rippled through the booth.  
  
Few spins later, Raina was up again. This dare was simple—ask someone for something they're wearing.  
  
Her shy gaze drifted to Hayes before landing on his wrist. ""Your bracelet... could I maybe...?""  
  
Lennox's heart stopped.  
  
The wooden prayer beads. Her mother's bracelet. The only thing she had left.  
  
Hayes barely hesitated. Just rolled those familiar beads between his fingers and slipped them right off.  
  
Cold shot through her like a bullet, leaving her shaking.  
  
She could still hear herself years ago: ""This is the most precious thing I own, Hayes.""  
  
And his response, soft and sure: ""Then I'll never take it off. Promise.""  
  
When she'd noticed it missing in her past life, he'd fed her some nonsense about keeping it safe so it wouldn't get damaged. She'd been stupid enough to believe him.  
  
Now she knew the truth. He'd handed her most precious memory to the one person guaranteed to destroy her.  
  
Lennox shoved through the door, eyes blazing. ""Give it back. Now.""  
  
The entire booth went dead silent.  
  
Hayes went pale, scrambling toward her. ""Len, it's not what you think—""  
  
""Then what is it?""  
  
She tried to push past him, but Raina had already melted behind Hayes like sm//oke.  
  
""Hayes..."" Raina's voice was barely a whisper.  
  
And Hayes—Hayes shielded her.  
  
Something vital cracked inside Lennox's heart. ""Seriously? You're gonna protect her? After everything her family did to mine?""  
  
Hayes's jaw worked silently before he found his voice. ""I didn't tell you because I knew you'd react like this.""  
  
""She saved my life once, Len. Almost died doing it. I know you hate her mother, but Raina... she's not like that.""  
  
""I don't care what she's like!""  
  
Lennox's voice cracked. ""You want to play hero? Fine. But don't use my sh//it to do it. Give me that back!""  
  
Raina shrank back, tears welling. ""But Hayes gave it to me... I've never wanted anything so much...""  
  
Her voice broke completely. ""Nobody's ever given me something so special before. You can't just... take back gifts...""  
  
She pressed a hand to her heart and started that delicate little cough.  
  
The room held its breath.  
  
Hayes's face softened as he rubbed her back, then turned to Lennox with something like resignation.  
  
""Just let her keep it, Len.""  
  
Six words that hit like a sledgehammer to the heart.  
  
Lennox didn't budge, her voice raw: ""That's my mother's bracelet, Hayes. My dead mother's bracelet.""  
  
""You're handing it over to the daughter of her killer. You want mom spinning in her grave?""  
  
Hayes's throat bobbed, but before he could speak, Raina's coughing fit cut him off.  
  
Tears streaming, Raina walked toward Lennox with the bracelet extended. ""If you really need it back...""  
  
Just as Lennox reached for it, Raina suddenly grabbed her wrist and threw herself backward.  
  
Crack!  
  
The bracelet went flying, hitting the floor with a sound like breaking bones.",1,1754909487.0,Contemporary_Romance,2,1.0,False

1mn9nmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Contemporary_Romance/comments/1mn9nmc/does_anyone_know_the_actual_title_to_this/,Does anyone know the actual title to this?,"I discovered that my colleagues had been calling me ""the old crow"" behind my back.  
The nickname came from Callan Thorne's stuck-up secretary Sable Quinn.  
Just because I am 32, but still foolishly waiting for the marriage certificate that will never be sent.  
I confronted Callan: ""Your precious secretary is calling me 'the old crow.' Did you know that?""  
Then he looked at me and gave a faint chuckle:  
""Sable jokes too much, you know that. You’re 32—are you seriously arguing with a little girl?""  
""You know what? You gotta admit—it kinda fits.""  
My heart felt like it was being crushed by a hand.   
Eight years of devoted love, and to him it was all just some amusing joke.  
I turned and walked away, submitted my resignation, and blocked him on everything.  
But suddenly, that ever-composed man completely lost it.  
""Rowan, I’m begging you, please come back.""  
  
The first time I heard ""old crow"" crystal clear was during Monday's company meeting.  
  
Sable sat there with her eyes downcast as I chewed her out, tears hanging at the corners of her eyes.  
  
During the break, someone muttered:  
  
""Typical old crow—always bullying the young, pretty girls.""  
  
The words hit me like a slap. My mind went blank.  
  
That opened the floodgates. The whispers behind me got louder and nastier.  
  
""Acting all high and mighty, taking it out on the poor girl.""  
  
""She’s 32 and still hanging on to some dead-end relationship from eight years ago? That’s just sad.""  
  
I set down my coffee cup. The conference room went dead silent for a split second.  
  
Every pair of eyes turned on me like I was the villain here.  
  
Sable dabbed at her slightly red eyes with a tissue.  
  
""Ms. Sylver, I'll double-check the data.""  
  
""Not double-check. Redo it.""  
  
I forced myself to ignore the stabbing pain in my heart and kept my voice ice-cold.  
  
""Get me a full analysis and recovery plan—on my desk first thing tomorrow.""  
  
My gaze swept over her, then over all the rubberneckers.  
  
""Meeting's over.""  
  
I stood up first and walked out of the conference room.  
  
Behind me, the chatter started up again like a tidal wave.  
  
This time, they weren't even trying to hide it.  
  
""What's she trying to prove? Everyone knows she only got that director position because of Callan.""  
  
""Old crow's really showing her claws now. What is this, early menopause?""  
  
Back in my office, my computer pinged with an internal email.  
  
I opened it. The subject line was impossible to miss:  
  
""Suggestions for Optimizing Management Communication and Supporting Employee Mental Health.""  
  
The sender was the HR director, but I knew exactly whose handiwork this was.  
  
Sable's tears apparently carried more weight than my performance reports.  
  
I snorted and closed the window just as Callan's direct line rang.  
  
His voice had that lazy, soothing tone that couldn't have cared less:  
  
""Rowan, you were pretty fired up in that meeting, huh? Made the poor girl cry.""  
  
""Sable's young and inexperienced—she's bound to make mistakes. Cut her some slack, will you?""  
  
I could hear faint sniffling in the background.  
  
I forced down my emotions and kept my voice as level as possible:  
  
""Sable's basic data was riddled with errors. It's going to mess up our quarterly report.""  
  
""Oh come on, work stuff—mistakes happen.""  
  
He brushed it off like it was nothing.  
  
""Sable's on her period and feeling rough. Give her a break.""  
  
""Hey, want to grab dinner tonight? That new sushi place—I already made reservations.""  
  
After work, I slid into Callan's familiar black sports car and finally felt some of the tension leave my shoulders.  
  
""Come on, she's just a kid who doesn't know any better. Show her the ropes, do me this one favor?""  
  
He was putting on his best puppy-dog act.  
  
I decided not to push it and let him off the hook.  
  
At the restaurant, Sable was already waiting in the private dining room—hair perfectly styled, makeup on point.  
  
The second she spotted us, she practically bounced out of her seat:  
  
""Oh! Mr. Thorne, Rowan! I didn't want you guys sitting around starving, so I took the liberty of ordering. I hope that's okay?""  
  
I shot Callan a look, but he was already making a beeline for the seat right next to Sable.  
  
""Sable was worried you were still pissed at her, so she wanted to make it right. Sweet, isn't she?""  
  
Sable immediately started fussing over me, pouring sake into my cup:  
  
""Rowan, I am so, so sorry. I totally screwed up those reports, made you look bad, and now everyone's gossiping... God, I feel terrible."" She raised her glass. ""I'm drinking to my screw-ups!""  
  
She knocked it back in one go, her cheeks instantly turning this perfect shade of pink.  
  
Callan watched her with obvious approval, then turned to me with casual curiosity:  
  
""Wait, people are gossiping about Rowan? What kind of gossip?""  
  
Sable pressed her lips together, looking almost shy:  
  
""Oh, Mr. Thorne, you should probably ask Rowan herself. I don't want to... you know...""  
  
Callan's eyes locked onto mine, clearly intrigued.  
  
I met his gaze head-on: ""Your staff have been calling me 'the old crow.'""  
  
He didn't even flinch. Actually started cracking up:  
  
""Come on, Sable jokes too much, you know that. You’re 32—why are you letting a kid get under your skin?""  
  
Then he really looked at me, and this little smirk crossed his face:  
  
""You know what? You gotta admit—it kinda fits.""  
  
I stared at this man I'd been with for eight years, and suddenly it was like looking at a total stranger.  
  
""Callan... do you really think this is funny?""  
  
""You honestly think it's hilarious that people are calling me 'the old crow'?""  
  
The whole room went dead quiet.  
  
Sable started to stand up, tears forming in her eyes:  
  
""Mr. Thorne, I think I should go. I'm obviously making things worse. You two should talk...""  
  
""Sable, sit your ass down!""  
  
Callan grabbed her wrist, then turned on me with pure irritation:  
  
""Jesus, Rowan! She's trying to apologize here. Why are you being such a bit//ch about this? It's a stupid nickname—why are you making it into this huge thing?""  
  
It felt like someone had just plunged a knife straight through my heart.  
  
I stared at his hand wrapped around Sable's wrist, and something inside me just... broke.  
  
Eight years. Eight years of believing in us, and it all just crumbled to nothing.  
  
""You know what? You're absolutely right.""  
  
I started laughing—actually laughing.  
  
I picked up that cup of sake Sable had so carefully poured for me:  
  
""This apology drink? I don't deserve it.""  
  
With that, I didn't bother looking at their horrified faces and walked out fast.  
  
The next morning, I needed the latest sales data for my presentation to the big boss.  
  
I sent out work emails but got radio silence.  
  
I went to track people down directly, and got the exact same response from everyone:  
  
""Sorry, Sable said Mr. Thorne needs it urgently. She told us to get it to him first.""  
  
""Sable said Mr. Thorne hasn't reviewed the data yet, so we can't release it to you.""  
  
""You should check with Sable. We're just following her orders.""  
  
The second I turned around, the snickering started up behind me:  
  
""The old crow can act all high and mighty, but she still needs us!""  
  
""I say we just call her 'basic bit//ch' at this point. All attitude, no power!""  
  
I immediately called Callan. Straight to voicemail.  
  
This deliberate freeze-out was basically a public humiliation.  
  
I marched straight to Callan's office.  
  
I walked in and found Sable all over him, like they were in their own little world.  
  
When he saw me, his voice had this edge of annoyance:  
  
""Jesus, do you not know how to knock?""  
  
I stared straight at him, my voice ice-cold:  
  
""Callan, I need the latest sales data for my presentation.""  
  
His frown deepened:  
  
""I already told you—I need to use that data first. What's the rush?""  
  
He paused, then added:  
  
""Sable's being extra careful going through everything so you don't blow a gasket over some tiny mistake again.""  
  
""Tiny mistake?""  
  
I almost laughed out loud:  
  
""Callan, she screwed up data that affects multi-million dollar project decisions!""  
  
I took a breath and tried again:  
  
""Your idea of 'being careful' is letting someone who can't even read a basic spreadsheet hold up critical data?""  
  
Sable's eyes immediately filled with tears, her voice dripping with hurt:  
  
""Rowan, I know I'm not as smart as you, but I'm really trying my best here...""  
  
""Sable, this isn't your fault!""  
  
Callan immediately pulled her closer, his voice going all gentle.  
  
When he turned back to me, there was actual disgust in his eyes:  
  
""Rowan! Are you kidding me right now? You're losing your mind over nothing! You really are turning into an old crow!""  
  
Hearing those words come straight out of his mouth hit me like a slap.  
  
He completely ignored the hurt in my eyes and kept going, his voice getting louder:  
  
""You can't do your job right, and then you throw these tantrums! Calling you an old crow is being nice!""  
  
""Look at Sable—she's actually humble! I'm only saying this for your own good!""  
  
Sable was leaning into Callan's shoulder, and I could see the smug satisfaction written all over her face.  
  
""Fine, Mr.Thorne. I get it. I'll figure out the data myself.""  
  
I turned to leave, and behind me I could hear Callan's voice go all soft and soothing again:  
  
""Sable, don't cry. Just ignore her. She's jealous of you, totally twisted...""  
  
The humiliation didn't stop there—it just kept getting worse.  
  
Callan's protection gave Sable and everyone else a free pass to do whatever they wanted.  
  
""Old crow"" was becoming their open joke now.  
  
Two new interns saw me coming and exchanged these knowing looks.  
  
One of them spoke just loud enough for me to catch:  
  
""Oh, here comes the old crow. Better run before she pecks us to death.""  
  
""Hey, did you get added to that group yet? It's hilarious.""  
  
""No, not yet! Send me the link!""  
  
This happened every day.  
  
Everything finally blew up during a project presentation.  
  
My last presentation had totally flopped, leaving the CEO pretty unhappy with me.  
  
This time, I'd spent weeks making sure everything was perfect.  
  
But ten minutes before we started, Callan strolled in with Sable right behind him.  
  
""Sable's been working on this project too. She's presenting today. You can jump in if needed.""  
  
I tried to push back:  
  
""Callan, I've been leading this project from the beginning. I know every detail.""  
  
He actually snorted and gave me this look:  
  
""Oh, you know it? Then remind me who screwed up the last presentation?""  
  
He turned to Sable with this warm, encouraging smile:  
  
""Sable, whenever you're ready.""  
  
Sable stepped right up and plugged her USB into the laptop like she owned the place.  
  
Callan was nodding along to everything she said, looking so proud.  
  
I just sat there watching this whole show, keeping my mouth shut.  
  
Then she went to switch slides and accidentally clicked the wrong thing.  
  
Her personal messaging app suddenly filled the entire projection screen.  
  
At the very top was a group chat that made my stomach drop:  
  
\*\*Old Crow Daily Updates\*\*  
  
It was packed with sneaky photos of me and running commentary.  
  
""Look at this—old crow's got her yoga pants and fancy coffee again. Must be nice living off someone else's money!""  
  
""Right? Eight years of this freeloading. I would've kicked her to the curb by now.""  
  
I could see Sable's fake-innocent response: ""Come on guys, that's not nice.""  
  
And right there underneath it, Callan had written: ""Sable you should probably keep your distance from the old crow. Don't need her taking it out on you again.""  
  
I looked straight at Callan. He wasn't even trying to look sorry—if anything, he seemed entertained.  
  
That's when something inside me just died. Eight years of believing in us, and I was nothing but their entertainment.  
  
I didn't stick around for the meeting to end. Walked straight to HR and handed in my resignation.  
  
As I was leaving with my box of stuff, I ran into Callan and Sable chatting and laughing in the hallway.  
  
Callan watched me walk by but didn't say a single word.  
  
I thought to myself: Goodbye, Callan. You're out of my world for good. Eight Years His Girlfriend, Thirty Days His Downfall",1,1754909262.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

But suddenly, that ever-composed man completely lost it.  
  
  
""Rowan, I’m begging you, please come back.""  
  
  
The first time I heard ""old crow"" crystal clear was during Monday's company meeting.  
  
  
Sable sat there with her eyes downcast as I chewed her out, tears hanging at the corners of her eyes.  
  
  
During the break, someone muttered:  
  
  
""Typical old crow—always bullying the young, pretty girls.""  
  
  
The words hit me like a slap. My mind went blank.  
  
  
That opened the floodgates. The whispers behind me got louder and nastier.  
  
  
""Acting all high and mighty, taking it out on the poor girl.""  
  
  
""She’s 32 and still hanging on to some dead-end relationship from eight years ago? That’s just sad.""  
  
  
I set down my coffee cup. The conference room went dead silent for a split second.  
  
  
Every pair of eyes turned on me like I was the villain here.  
  
  
Sable dabbed at her slightly red eyes with a tissue.  
  
  
""Ms. Sylver, I'll double-check the data.""  
  
  
""Not double-check. Redo it.""

I even found an ongoing list where you can apply right now (I’ll drop it below because you NEED to see this):  
**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**

I’m sorry but HOW did we get here? Should I just forget everything I went to school for and start stress-testing shopping apps on my couch??  
Here’s the INSANE part: these companies are hiring REMOTELY—yes, globally—so you don’t even need to live in a big city! Here are 10 legit companies straight up hiring mobile app testers for 2025 with remote, flexible options:

I’m genuinely SHOCKED that these gigs fly under the radar. Like, is this the universe’s way of apologizing for all the ‘entry level only/ 5 years experience required’ memes?

IMAGINE—spending your afternoon testing a puzzle game while sipping coffee and getting PAID TO “play.” Bizarre? Yes. Incredible? Absolutely. Want another kicker? Payments get sent through PayPal, gift cards, or (sometimes) direct bank transfer. No brainer.

Truthfully, the heartbreak didn’t hit until April when I tried to reconcile and found out my ex had already moved on in February. It was my first big heartbreak, and I went through the full spectrum: longing, regret, jealousy, resentment.

Since then, I’ve been actively working on myself like moved to a new city, joined social groups, owned my mistakes in the relationship, started therapy, and worked with a breakup coach. I’ve only recently started dating again.

A month ago, I met a woman, (35F) who owns a plant shop near me. The first time I went in, I asked her out (something I never do). She had a boyfriend but said she would have said yes otherwise, and even complimented me for being direct.

Two weeks later, I stopped in and she mentioned she and her boyfriend had broken up that weekend. She said it was mutual, a relief, not working for a while. I didn’t ask her out then, but popped in a couple more times for small purchases and light banter.

This past week, I went in intending to ask her out. She said yes, but sinceshe’s fresh out of a breakup and in a “weird headspace,” so she’d like to wait a few weeks. She asked me to check back in later. I’ll be in Europe for three weeks, so it will be about four weeks before I see her again.

I’ve only been on a couple dates since my breakup, I’m still craving connection, and my brain wants to make her “the one” before we’ve even had coffee. My rational side knows she’s fresh out of something, I barely know her, and the odds are small. But emotionally, I’m already getting hopeful.

How do I stay grounded and open-minded without loading this up with fantasy and pressure before it’s even started?

TL;DR: 39M, 8 months post-breakup, just started dating again. Met a local “plant store girl,” asked her out once (she had a BF), she broke up, asked her out again and she said yes… but wants to wait a few weeks due to fresh breakup. I’m already getting hopeful and imagining the future. How do I keep expectations realistic and not turn this into a romcom in my head before our first date?",1,1754908940.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

Zhang Wei first spread his palm for a reading, his fingertips nervously pressed the edge of his palm. ""The internet says a short life line means a short life,"" he said, his voice tinged with anxiety. A recent office trend of ""judging lifespan by the life line"" had left him losing sleep, wondering if something was wrong.I pointed to the subtle branches on his life line: ""This isn’t about how long you’ll live—it’s about your energy pattern. See these small forks? They mean you recharge through creative activities, but you’ve been neglecting them lately."" Zhang’s eyes widened: ""I used to draw every weekend, but stopped after getting promoted. Now I’m exhausted all the time, even after 8 hours of sleep.""The life line, that curved crease starting between the index finger and thumb and curving toward the wrist, is palmistry’s most misunderstood feature. Contrary to popular belief, it has little to do with ""predicted lifespan."" Instead, it acts as a dynamic barometer of your physical energy, emotional resilience, and soul vitality—recording how you generate, expend, and replenish life force. Today, we’ll unpack what your life line truly reveals: How does your energy flow? What drains your vitality? And how can you decode your ""life force instruction manual"" through this line?

# The Life Line’s Basic Energy Code: Length, Depth, and Clarity

The fundamental characteristics of the life line form your ""energy blueprint."" A 2019 study in the *International Journal of Palm Energy Research*, tracking 2,000 participants, identified these three features as most indicative of energy states:

# 1. Length: The ""Range"" of Your Energy Distribution

The length of the life line reflects how broadly you distribute your energy across life areas—not how long you’ll live.

* **Long with a wide curve** (about 35% of people): Energy radiates across multiple domains, balancing work, family, and hobbies. 42-year-old university professor Teacher Wang has a long, expansive life line: ""Colleagues call me ‘energetic’ for juggling teaching, research, and parenting—but I just naturally spread my energy across different areas."" These individuals avoid ""energy bottlenecks"" and thrive in diverse lifestyles.

* **Short but compact** (about 40% of people): Energy focuses intensely on core priorities, with strong bursts in key areas. 28-year-old programmer A Kai’s short yet clear life line matches his pattern: ""I can focus for 8 hours at work, but social gatherings drain me in 2 hours. Accepting I ‘only have energy for deep work’ eliminated my anxiety.""

* **Medium length** (about 25% of people): Energy distributes evenly, balancing focus and flexibility. 36-year-old designer Sister Lin explains: ""I dive deep into projects during busy periods and switch to family travel when free. My life line seems to say ‘enough is enough’—no need to overextend.""

# 2. Depth: The ""Reserve Strength"" of Your Energy

The depth of the life line reflects the ""solidity"" of your energy reserves—whether you’re ""quick to charge and quick to deplete"" or ""slow to charge but long-lasting.""

* **Deep and continuous** (about 38% of people): Energy reserves are robust with strong stress resistance. 39-year-old entrepreneur Lao Zhou’s deeply etched life line explains his stamina: ""Pulling all-nighters on projects barely phases me—my team jokes I ‘have a built-in generator.’"" Studies show these individuals recover 40% faster from high stress, excelling in intense environments.

* **Shallow and delicate** (about 32% of people): Energy reserves are sensitive and require careful management. 27-year-old yoga instructor Xiao Meng’s soft, shallow life line guides her routine: ""All-nighters take days to recover from, but 10 minutes of daily meditation keeps my energy steady."" These individuals thrive in low-stress, rhythmic lifestyles.

* **Alternating deep and shallow** (about 30% of people): Energy fluctuates with natural cycles. 45-year-old editor Sister Zhang identifies her ""energy seasons"": ""Spring brings productivity for deadlines; winter calls for slow reading. Working with these rhythms feels effortless.""

# 3. Clarity: The ""Smoothness"" of Energy Flow

The clarity of the life line indicates how smoothly energy circulates—whether it flows ""unobstructed"" or gets ""stuck in internal friction.""

* **Clear with no clutter** (about 29% of people): Energy flows freely with minimal internal waste. 50-year-old retired doctor Uncle Li’s clean life line mirrors his approach: ""I rarely overthink—rest when tired, act when energized. My energy cycles like ‘living water.’"" These individuals score 35% lower on ""energy drain"" assessments, living with refreshing simplicity.

* **Fuzzy with fine lines** (about 45% of people): Energy easily gets stuck in overthinking and internal friction. 32-year-old marketing specialist 小陈 (Xiao Chen) has many fine lines around his life line: ""I exhaust myself worrying ‘am I doing enough’—I’m tired even without physical work. Anxiety drains my energy silently.""

* **Partly clear, partly fuzzy** (about 26% of people): Energy flows smoothly in specific areas but gets stuck in others. 30-year-old mom Sister Sun thrives in parenting (clear middle section of her life line) but hesitates in career planning (fuzzy lower section): ""Accepting I ‘can’t be fully charged in everything’ made life lighter.""

# ""Special Marks"" on the Life Line: Energy ""Warnings and Turning Points""

Branches, star marks, and island marks on the life line aren’t ""disaster signals""—they’re energy ""signposts"" indicating where adjustments are needed and where vitality opportunities lie.

# 1. Branches: Energy ""Diversion and Expansion""

Branches on the life line represent energy distribution ""crossroads,"" not ""energy loss.""

* **Upward branches (toward the index finger)** (about 22% of people): Energy expands into ""goal pursuit"" areas. 34-year-old sales director A Feng’s upward branch appeared with his promotion: ""I suddenly found motivation to learn management—from ‘just selling products’ to expanding my energy into leadership."" More upward branches mean greater capacity for ""energy 升级 (upgrading energy)"".

* **Downward branches (near the wrist)** (about 18% of people): Energy needs ""grounding in daily life"" for replenishment. 29-year-old content creator Xiao Yu’s downward branch guided her: ""I obsessed over ‘constant productivity’ until illness forced me to cook and garden—rediscovering creativity through grounded living. Energy needs roots in daily life.""

* **Multiple small branches** (about 15% of people): Energy flows through diverse experiences. 47-year-old florist Sister Ling’s life line branches like a small tree: ""Running a flower shop, learning pottery, volunteering—each experience makes life feel purposeful. More branches mean more vibrant energy.""

# 2. Star Marks: Energy ""Peak Moments""

Star marks are ""energy 闪光点 (sparkles)"" on the life line, signaling periods of 超常 energy activation.

* **Star mark at the start** (about 8% of people): Early ""energy awakening"" opportunities. 38-year-old fitness coach Lao Yang’s starting star mark coincided with his 18th year: ""Discovering running transformed me from ‘sickly’ to a team athlete—this awakening shaped my life’s passion.""

https://preview.redd.it/ssaetqdpcdif1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf234fe27fac8993bd9f1b6bac5049a82b8e2197

* **Star mark in the middle** (about 12% of people): Midlife ""energy transformation."" 45-year-old accountant Sister Zhou’s middle star mark appeared when her children left for college: ""I suddenly took up painting, and weekly studio time lit up my energy—proving midlife can spark new vitality.""

https://preview.redd.it/0yvsg7bqcdif1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=f41c5b2dcb7c0af8b437daa1a76424083d5f1901

* **Star mark at the end** (about 6% of people): Sustained energy in later years. 63-year-old retired teacher Aunt Chen’s terminal star mark reflects her vitality: ""Learning calligraphy and caring for grandchildren keep me busy and fulfilled. Neighbors say I ‘grow more energetic with age’—star marks show energy never expires.""

https://preview.redd.it/8pjnmt2rcdif1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=69fed3e2f8268beaf0c5834bd51d74b2d0e9d7df

# 3. Island Marks: Temporary Energy ""Stagnation""

Island marks (small oval shapes within the line) aren’t ""energy crises"" but signals for ""energy adjustment.""

* **Island at the front section** (about 19% of people): Early energy prone to ""overconsumption"" stagnation. 30-year-old programmer A Zhe’s front island mark appeared during college: ""Late-night gaming left me constantly ill, but regular routines faded the island—proving young energy debts can be repaid.""

* **Island in the middle section** (about 24% of people): Midlife need for ""energy balance."" 42-year-old business owner Brother Zhao’s middle island mark emerged during overwork: ""I poured all time into work until health issues forced exercise and family time. Now the island fades, and energy improves.""

* **Island at the end section** (about 10% of people): Later years need ""slow energy conservation."" 70-year-old Grandpa Zhang’s terminal island guides him: ""Doctors advised ‘less overexertion’—now slow walks and chess keep me more energetic than before. Islands remind us to ‘slow down and recharge.’""

# Beyond Physical Energy: The Life Line and Soul Vitality

While the life line reflects physical energy, its deeper meaning lies in revealing soul vitality—that inner drive making life feel purposeful. These connections bridge physical and spiritual energy:

# 1. Life Line Connected to Head Line: Balancing Reason and Vitality

https://preview.redd.it/9yubg6eucdif1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=01a491d2d74dcabca964850c2f4065a7c24acf4e

People with closely linked life and head lines (about 30%) find soul vitality in ""rational exploration."" 35-year-old researcher Lao Zheng explains: ""Solving scientific puzzles energizes me more than sleep—this is soul-level energy replenishment."" These individuals thrive on ""problem-solving and discovery"" for deep vitality.

# 2. Life Line Surrounding a Full Mount of Venus: Vitality Through Emotional Connection

Those with a 饱满 (plump) Mount of Venus (below the thumb, about 25%) draw soul vitality from ""emotional bonds."" 40-year-old community worker Sister Liu’s full mount fuels her: ""Resolving neighbor conflicts and organizing events makes life feel meaningful—this connection energy matters more than food or sleep.""

# 3. Life Line Curving Toward Mount of Jupiter: Purpose-Driven Soul Vitality

People with life lines curving toward the Mount of Jupiter (below the index finger, about 20%) find vitality in ""pursuing meaning."" 37-year-old charity founder Lao Xu embodies this: ""Even exhausted, thinking of our mountain school project reignites my energy—this is soul-given vitality.""

# 3 Practical Ways to Activate Your Life Line Energy

1. **Match Activities to Your Energy Pattern**: Short, deep life line? Focus energy on 1-2 priorities instead of spreading thin. Shallow, delicate line? Build regular replenishment rituals. Programmer A Zhe adjusted his schedule: ""Protecting 2 daily hours for drawing actually boosted my coding energy.""

1. **Adjust Energy Based on Marks**: Follow upward branches to explore new goals; honor downward branches with grounding activities; address islands by reducing overconsumption. Accountant Zhou balanced her schedule after noticing her middle island: ""Fewer late nights improved efficiency—and the island faded.""

1. **Daily ""Soul Vitality Rituals""**: Choose practices matching your vitality type—rational explorers read/reflect; connection seekers chat with loved ones; purpose-driven souls engage with meaningful causes. Community worker Liu spends 10 daily minutes chatting with neighbors: ""More energizing than coffee—my soul’s recharge method.""

Months after his reading, Zhang Wei not only adjusted his schedule but started weekly running. ""I no longer see my life line as ‘short’—I notice its clear, energetic 纹路 (lines). It’s not a ‘sentence’ but an ‘instruction manual’—telling me how to use my energy all along.""If you spread your palm now, your life line might be long or short, deep or shallow—but remember: these aren’t ""fate limits"" but ""energy maps""—guiding you to distribute energy, replenish vitality, and live with both strength and purpose.Want to decode your specific life line energy code?

I let him go. I handle the hospital crisis myself.

In my past life, I forced him to abandon her and rescue his parents instead.

My husband seemed fine with it at first.

He poisoned my anniversary dinner and shoved me down the stairs.

“Madison died because of you! This is all your fault!”

I bled out on the floor, our unborn child dying with me.

When he finally looks at his muted phone and sees the flood of urgent hospital messages, he crumbles.

He appears to have aged ten years in a single night.

————————

1

My husband’s obsession, Madison Brooks, was lounging in my living room when the emergency call came.

“Mrs. Mitchell, your in-laws have been in a serious car accident on the outskirts of town,” a voice from the hospital said, laced with urgency.

“Their condition is critical. They need to be transferred to a specialty hospital for emergency brain surgery. The cost is two and a half million dollars.”

A memory from a life I’d already lived had me jabbing the speakerphone button, making sure my husband, Ryan Mitchell, heard every single word.

I turned to him. His handsome face was a mask of suspicion.

He scoffed. “Lidia Carter, just last month you were screaming that you wanted me to lose everything. Is this your next move? You’d fake my parents’ death just to get Madison out of the house?”

I didn’t cry or scream. I just laid out the facts, my voice flat.

“This isn’t a joke. They are in trouble, and we need two and a half million dollars to save them. We need to access the family trust fund, now.”

His icy glare cut right through me. “This pathetic act won’t make you any more exciting in bed. And now you’re trying to scam me out of my money?”

We had known each other for ten years. I’d saved his life once, and this marriage of convenience was my reward.

Ryan came from a finance dynasty. I was a middle-class girl who ran a coffee shop. He never saw me as an equal. His infatuation with Madison Brooks, a social media influencer, was an open secret.

When we got married, I told him he could go to Madison whenever he wanted. I wasn’t going to chain myself to his handsome face and endless fortune.

He had just pushed me against a wall and kissed me hard, his voice a low growl. “Shut up, Lidia. Just be a good Mrs. Mitchell. That’s all you need to do.”

After the wedding, his coldness only grew worse.

It wasn’t until Madison returned to the country that I saw the fire in his eyes when he looked at her. That’s when I finally understood. There was no room for me in his heart, not even a tiny, pitiful corner.

My own gaze went cold, my disappointment absolute. “I’m not lying, and I’m not playing games.”

I looked him straight in the eye.

“Believe me or don’t. Your parents are really hurt. If you have a conscience, you’ll help me get the money. If you don’t, then get out of my way while I save them.”

He froze, probably because he’d never seen me this forceful.

I turned to leave, pushing past Madison, who was blocking my path. She let out a shriek and tumbled down the stairs with all the grace of a sack of potatoes.

“Oh, it hurts!” she wailed from the floor, tears springing to her eyes on cue. She looked so innocent, so pitiful.

“Ryan, don’t blame Lidia,” she sobbed. “She didn’t mean to do it.”

Ryan’s face darkened instantly. He rushed over and scooped her into his arms.

She winced, clutching her wrist. It was only then I noticed a fresh scratch on the back of my own hand.

He roared at me, his voice shaking with rage. “Don’t you dare touch a hair on her head! If anything happens to Madison, I’ll kill you!”

He stormed out the door, carrying Madison with him.

I was left alone in the vast, empty mansion, my heart a pile of cold ash.

...

The hospital hadn’t said I couldn’t raise the money myself. I called my family lawyer first, then bolted for the bank.

Before I even got there, my phone rang. It was Ryan’s cousin, Jake Mitchell, an FBI agent.

“Well, well,” Jake’s voice oozed smugness. “Pulling another stunt, Lidia? Whose attention are you after this time? Ryan’s?”

None of Ryan’s family ever respected me.

Only his parents had been genuinely kind. I had to save them.

I swallowed my anger. “Jake, did Ryan tell you I was putting on a show?”

The silence on the other end of the line was all the confirmation I needed.

A bitter laugh escaped my lips.

“Jake, you’re an FBI agent, and your only response to my call for help is mockery. If you don’t use your position to help, I will be filing a complaint with Internal Affairs.”

Jake’s playful tone vanished.

His voice exploded through the phone. “You think marrying a Mitchell makes you one of us? Let me be clear. You’re nothing but a gold-digging nobody from the sticks! If Madison hadn’t gone abroad, Ryan would have never given you a second look.”

I hung up without a word and immediately sent an email to the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility.

When I arrived at the bank, I tried to access our joint account.

“I’m sorry, Mrs. Mitchell,” the bank manager said, looking pained. “Your credit cards have been canceled, and the joint account has been frozen by Mr. Ryan Mitchell.”

To make matters worse, my lawyer called to inform me that the family trust fund was also temporarily frozen by a court order, thanks to an internal family dispute.

I took a deep breath and dialed my secretary.

“Mortgage all my coffee shops and liquidate my entire investment portfolio. I need one and a half million dollars in cash within the hour.”

“Right away, Lidia.”

That left a million to go. I dialed Ryan’s uncle, Thomas Mitchell.

“Uncle Thomas, Ryan’s parents were in a car crash. They need an urgent transfer, and I’m short one million dollars. Can you lend it to me? I’ll pay you back as soon as the fund is unfrozen.”

Thomas sounded shocked. “My brother was in an accident? Does Ryan know?”

I sighed. “I told him, but he doesn’t believe me. He’s at a private hospital with Madison right now. You’re the only one who can help.”",1,1754908693.0,Novelnews,1,0.67,False

consists of me, usually in a hoodie and fueled by too much coffee.

For a while, I was spending hours on repetitive tasks sending the same onboarding
emails, manually submitting my site to directories, and tracking leads in cumbersome spreadsheets. I finally decided to automate what I could, and it has been a game-changer.

Here’s the three-tool workflow that freed up my time and actually improved my results:

**Directory Submission Automation**

I use a [tool](https://www.getmorebacklinks.org/) that bulk-submits to over 500 relevant SaaS and AI directories. Setting it up takes about 10 minutes, and within the next two weeks, I had around 40 links live, with some ranking on Google. These links continue to generate referral traffic and enhance my SEO without any additional effort on my part.

**[Loops.so](https://loops.so/) for Onboarding and Nurture Emails**

Instead of sending onboarding emails to trial users manually, I set up a simple
three-email drip campaign. It includes one welcome email, one email about how others use our services, and one nudge to encourage upgrades. All of this is triggered automatically through Stripe events. As a result, open rates increased, and I even received several replies from users considering upgrades.

**Airtable and Automations for Lead Tracking**

Every time a form is submitted, a chat inquiry is made, or someone signs up through a directory, that information goes straight into [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/) with appropriate tags. I receive a weekly digest that shows where users are coming from and which channels I should focus on. This eliminates the need to piece together information from random notes.

The biggest benefit? I can now devote my marketing time to experiments rather than repetitive tasks.

I’m curious about what other automation setups you’re using—I'm always looking to

Brewing black coffee at home can be an art, and when done right, it can transform your mornings and elevate your daily routine. Imagine waking up to the rich aroma that fills your kitchen, and enjoying a cup that’s both invigorating and satisfying.

You might think it’s easier to grab a cup from your favorite café, but you can master the skill of making black coffee right at home with a few simple tips and techniques. This guide will unlock the secrets to brewing coffee that delights your senses and energizes your day. Are you ready to take your coffee game to the next level? Let’s dive in and discover how to create a perfect, flavorful cup of black coffee without ever leaving your home.

# Choosing Quality Coffee Beans

Choosing quality coffee beans is crucial for making delicious black coffee at home. The right beans can enhance the flavor and aroma of your brew. You should consider several factors when selecting coffee beans. These include the type of bean and its origin.

# Arabica Vs. Robusta

Arabica beans are popular for their smooth and rich flavor. They grow at high altitudes, which enhances their taste. Many coffee lovers prefer Arabica for its complex flavors. On the other hand, Robusta beans have a stronger, bitter taste. They contain more caffeine and are easier to grow. Robusta beans are often used in espresso blends for added strength.

# Single-origin Vs. Blends

Single-origin coffee comes from one specific region. It offers unique flavor profiles based on its origin. This choice allows you to explore diverse tastes from different areas. Blends combine beans from various regions to create balanced flavors. They offer consistency and can highlight the strengths of each bean. Both single-origin and blends have their own benefits.

# Grinding Coffee Beans

Grinding coffee beans is a crucial step in making black coffee. Freshly ground beans provide the best flavor and aroma. To make a perfect cup, focus on the grind size and the grinder type. These factors influence the taste and strength of your coffee.

# Grind Size And Its Importance

Grind size affects how coffee tastes. A fine grind makes the coffee strong and bold. A coarse grind makes it lighter and milder. Each brewing method requires a specific grind size. A French press needs coarse grounds. An espresso machine needs fine grounds. The right grind size ensures a balanced flavor.

# Using A Burr Grinder

Burr grinders are the best choice for grinding coffee beans. They crush beans evenly, preserving flavor and aroma. Burr grinders offer precise grind size control. This consistency is key for a perfect brew. Invest in a quality burr grinder for the best results. Avoid blade grinders. They chop beans unevenly, affecting taste.

# Water Quality And Temperature

Water plays a crucial role in making black coffee. The quality and temperature of water can affect the taste significantly. Good water ensures your coffee has a clean flavor. Proper temperature helps extract the right amount of flavor. Let’s dive into these aspects to make your black coffee perfect.

# Filtered Water Benefits

Filtered water removes impurities, enhancing coffee taste. It improves clarity and aroma. Tap water often contains minerals that alter taste. Using filtered water ensures consistency in flavor. It prevents unwanted odors from affecting the coffee. Clean water is vital for a pure coffee experience.

# Optimal Brewing Temperature

Temperature is key to extracting flavors. Water should be between 195°F to 205°F. Too hot or cold affects coffee quality. Proper temperature ensures balanced extraction. It preserves essential oils and flavors. Use a thermometer for accuracy. Boiling water can scorch coffee grounds. Let water cool slightly before brewing.

# Brewing Methods

Brewing black coffee at home can be an art. With a few techniques, you can craft a perfect cup that suits your taste. Each method offers unique benefits and flavors. Let’s dive into some popular brewing methods and discover which one might become your favorite.

# French Press Technique

The French Press is all about simplicity and depth. Start by measuring your coffee grounds; a coarse grind is ideal. Add them to the French Press. Boil water and let it cool for a minute. Pour the water over the grounds, and stir gently.

Let the coffee steep for about four minutes. Press down the plunger slowly. Pour your coffee into a mug. You’ll notice a rich, full-bodied flavor. It’s the perfect method for those who enjoy a strong cup.
