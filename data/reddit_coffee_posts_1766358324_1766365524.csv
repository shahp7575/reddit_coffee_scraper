Date : 3/17/1836
Constable : Montague Jasper Broderick
Identification Number : 87304-C
Case Number : 40897

This is the case report following up on the murder of Mr. Ralph Christopher which took place in the early morning hours of March 14th. Our only lead was the word of ten year old Teddy Bindz, who happened to witness the murder from his second story window across the street. Though, his only description of the killer was that they were wearing a long coat with a top hat, they wielded a curved dagger, and they had a large nose.

After that I was just pulling on random threads. I visited the few business in the area that were open that late into the night to ask if anything else of interest had happened. When I got to The Black Elephant, multiple witnesses including staff claimed that two men from out of town by the names of Mr. Anderson Rostminder and his “cousin” Mr. Frederick Rostminder had been there drinking all afternoon and into the night until they were thrown out around midnight for becoming belligerent and overly flirtatious with the burlesque dancers who were performing.

It was only a hunch, but after gathering these tips, I came to find out that the Rostminders are renting a charming little flat by the Prehville River. A flat that happens to be right next to a property in the possession of one Mr. Ralph Christopher. I went to pay them a visit at around 8:30 that morning, bringing Deputy Middleton along for backup.

The first thing I noticed when Frederick came to the door was that he seemed quite nervous as soon as he saw me. The second thing I noticed was that his nose was quite large. I asked him for his identification papers and if anyone else was in the house with him. He said his cousin Mr. Anderson Rostminder was staying with him, though seemed unsure of his own relation to the man. According to Frederick, Anderson was nowhere to be seen, and their Great-Uncle who had originally rented the apartment, Mr. Lloyd Rostminder, was previously staying with them but left the morning of the 13th when Anderson arrived.

Frederick’s claims, awkward as the young man was, had no indication of guilt. However, it was too early to rule him out as a suspect just yet. I answered his questions on the matter with the bare minimum of explanations. He allowed me to look around his apartment, though the only things of note there was that Frederick had been telling the truth about being the only one there, and that he perhaps had a problem with alcohol. I took note of at least six glasses of wine scattered throughout the room, though he explained it away with some poor excuse in scientific jargon. Sadly, alcoholism isn't probable cause, or tragedy could have been avoided. I suggested that he not leave town before exiting the flat.

I stood on a corner a few buildings over until Mr. Frederick exited the flat at around 11:25 and went to Crowning’s tea house. He stayed there for about three hours, which I had not anticipated, but just as I was beginning to wonder if this trail led nowhere, Frederick left Crowning’s around 2:41 and had quite an interesting exchange at Nove’s Oditty Emporium

He entered the shop, and I watched from close behind. Placing my ear against the door, I could hear him calling for Knove and getting no response. Then his footsteps trailed off deeper into the establishment, and it became much harder to hear him. After a few moments, Mr. Rostminder yelled out something about a joke and a business complaint. There was more silence, and then ever so faintly I heard another voice. Frederick and the voice continued in hushed tones until I heard Frederick rushing towards the door. I prepared to duck around the corner, but then he stopped just short of the entrance. I heard him rifling through papers.

That's when the other voice yelled out a warning to Frederick that someone was listening at the door. How they knew this, I had not a clue and still don’t. I ran as fast as I could around the block so that I was back some distance behind Frederick by the time his run turned into a walk. The strangest part was that I had talked to Mr. Nove on a few occasions, but he and the man conversing with Mr. Frederick sounded nothing alike.

I knew something incredibly peculiar was going on, but I never had any hope of guessing at something this bizarre.

We were back to his apartment by 3:00 and he didn't come out for the rest of the day. Around 5:00, I placed a deputy in my position and went across town to follow more leads on where Anderson had gotten off to.

There was no record of any Mr. Anderson Rostminder arriving at the train station on March 13th. Lucky for me, It would seem that these Rostminder men had made quite the names for themselves in Tirnath already. Everyone in town talks, and though I’m no gossip even I had heard about the old man who at the train station trying to bop some taunter with his cane on the morning of March 12th, two mornings prior to the murder.

With further digging, I found out that the old man was apparently the Great-Uncle of the Rostminder cousins, Professor Lloyd Rostminder, who happened to be wearing a long coat with a top hat upon his arrival. I also learned that the taunter was none other than Mr. Christopher.

What truly cemented my theory was the multiple witnesses I went on to question in the shopping district who corroborated that another altercation had taken place between Mr. Christopher and Mr. Anderson on the 13th, the afternoon before the murder.

I kept deputies surveying the Rostminder’s apartment all night long and came back around noon the next morning on the 15th to relieve them. No movement until a little after 5:00 in the evening when I tailed Frederick to The Twelfth Holy Church Of Shast. I refused to intervene with his matters of faith, being a devout Shastian myself. He left the church around 6:00 and took a walk along the Prehville until returning to his apartment at 6:30.

Frederick stayed there until sundown. Then at 8:05, I noticed movement near the front door of the Rostminder’s apartment. A figure that I believe to have been Frederick made their way swiftly across the yard between the apartment and the Balthazar Estate. I moved in to question them, but the subject had already fled back towards the direction of the apartment. They closed the door in my face, and when I announced myself nobody answered. That was the last I saw of Frederick.

Around midnight, just as I was waiting for a deputy to take my post, I thought I saw a flicker of light inside a high window of the Balthazar Estate. When Deputy Middleton finally did come by, I told him to patrol the block a few more laps around the properties while I stayed to investigate.

He also informed me that we were the only two officers on duty not dealing with some sort of a lizard creature down at the oddities shop which Mr. Knove had apparently transformed into after recently acquiring some sort of exotic amulet shaped like an eye that afternoon. It pains me to admit it because he was quite a nice fellow, but it is needless to say that his shop will most likely need to be shut down after this week’s instances.

Soon after a storm came in from the east. Luckily the restaurant across the street had an awning to block the torrents. When Middleton arrived, I asked him to bring me a cup of coffee and patrol the block for a few more hours.

The clock tower’s chime high up on the roof of the estate next-door was loud enough to hear over the rain. I remembered passing that house with my son Timothy before his passing. That was back when it belonged to Ms. Balthazar. He asked about the clock and bell, and I explained what they were and what they did. He was always so curious. I only mention this because of what happened next.

When I first saw him, I assumed it must have been from fatigue. After spending the past two days tailing this Rostminder family, maybe my mind happened to be thinking of my own. But after everything else that happened that night, I’m fairly certain that I saw my boy again. It was for just a moment, but seeing as I have only a single picture of him, those few seconds were priceless.

It wasn’t until around 4:30 in the morning that I heard a disturbance within the Balthazar Estate. A crash and a bang loud enough to cut through the havoc of the storm. I had just about finished my coffee and braved the rain to cross the street and confront whoever was inside. I approached the residence and knocked on the front door. Then I announced myself and was soon greeted at the door by the elusive Mr. Anderson Rostminder himself.

I informed him of the warrant for his arrest and prepared to take him into custody, when he began pleading with me to come inside and help save his “Great-Nephew Frederick” from the murderer who had apparently also broken into the property alongside the Rostminder cousins. I wouldn’t have believed him if there hadn't been a clatter at that very moment. It came from behind Anderson, deep beyond the long dark corridor. Sounded like someone knocking over a pile of boxes. From what I could tell, Anderson’s fear for his relative seemed genuine. We each took up a candle stick, and I undid the button on my holster. Then I stepped in.

“I was woken in the night by a creak of a door,” explained Anderson quietly as we ventured further into the Balthazar Estate, ""It was faint, almost too faint. All the doors in this house creak something awful, so I knew whoever was opening it was trying with extreme caution not to disturb anyone inside. I’m not sure exactly when I dozed off, but I remember the sound of that door…”

“All the doors, eh?” I asked. Anderson grew a bit flustered, “Just how long have you been residing here? I have strong reason to assume the owner is not aware of your presence…”
“Oh,” he stuttered, “I suppose I’ve spent the last two nights here… But tonight, after hearing the noise of the door, I stood up from the spot where I had fallen asleep on the floor, as quietly as I could. I felt the presence of someone else in the room with me. I still feel it now while walking this hall…”

I knew what he meant. Once you've been on the force long enough, you get a good sense for danger, like a heightened ability to notice when someone is sizing you up. And I knew in that moment that something was waiting for us at the end of the corridor.

“Surely if it was Frederick, he would have said something to me,” continued Anderson, “Standing there in the darkness for more moments than I cared to, I decided to pick up a candlestick and light it as fast as I could to at least get my bearings. I burned my fingers, but I got it lit.

“That’s when I noticed all of the greenery. The wall of plants and ivy that trailed up to the peaks of the ceiling had been completely dried out and dead for decades. Yet now they had inexplicably come back to life. They looked as lively as a forest and the surprise distracted me only for a second.

“All I could think to do was call out for Frederick in hopes that he could come to my aid before this intruder picks us both off one at a time. So I did. I called out for my nephew, and there was nothing but silence. Then the next thing I knew, a pair of wrinkled gray old hands came shooting out of the darkness reaching for my throat. I dropped my candle while fighting them off in the scuffle. A bookcase fell over, and a corner of one of the stained glass windows was shattered. But in the end, I got a few good hits in, and the assailant slunk off into a corner. Before they could make for their second attack, you came knocking at the door and I tossed carpet behind me running down the maze of blackened halls until I got to you.”

“Gray? And wrinkled too, you say?” I asked with trepidation, “What is this, some sort of ghostly tale?”
“I’m telling you!” Anderson persisted, “Skin gray as stone with dirty black nails! This all must be the work of quite the derelict vagrant we’re dealing with…”
At this point I wondered if Frederick wasn’t too far. Perhaps this was all a ruse, and the eyes I felt were those of the two Rostminders about to commit their second homicide.

“Do you have any real proof there was another person here?”
“Are you speaking of Frederick or the intruder? I can show you where the scuffle took place, but didn’t you hear it? There’s no way I could make that much noise by myself!”
“Maybe Frederick helped you?”
Anderson turned to me, and I began to reach for my cuffs.
“What?” he gasped, “No, I told you Frederick is gone! I can't seem to find him anywhere! You must believe me!” he flung open the door to the study, “A killer lurks somewhere in this house! Here is where he was! See the mess of papers and other items across the floor?”

I had reached the end of my patience.
“Mr. Anderson, I believe we had better discuss this matter further back at the station.”
The next thing I knew, I was struck unconscious with a blow to the back of the head.

What happened next was recounted to me by Anderson.
“The figure quickly fell upon me with great fury. We rolled across the floor wrestling, knocking over end tables and vases until we eventually bumped the candlestick off of the desk where I had placed it and into the shelf of plants. In seconds, the entire corner of the study was up in flames, orange fire climbing the ivy like a ladder. I could see the silhouette of a figure in a long coat creeping towards me in the darkness. It only grew closer as the inferno spread. 

“In my attempt to plant myself back upon my feet, I stumbled backwards towards the balcony. The figure drew a large dagger from their coat as they made a dash at me. I reached for the handle of the knife as we grappled for it above our heads. After a moment, I had gained the better grip on the dagger, but the figure had gained ground, pushing me all the way so that my back was up against the railing of the balcony. That's when I finally saw its face.

“Tight gray dry skin and red sunken eyes. Horrible eyes… Crooked cavity filled teeth, gray stringy hair, and a long black tattered coat. It looked like a dead man brought back to life. He gazed into my eyes as the fire raged behind him. I couldn’t understand why he had so much hate for me. I had never before seen this man, this horrid thing!

“I reached with my free hand up to his face to push the heathen away, and I watched in the moonlit night as his withered old jaw bone snapped off in my hand and crumbled to dust. The shriveled tongue writhed around the figure's open neck like a fatty grub. That's when Constable Broderick shot him.”

I had awoken during Mr. Anderson's scuffle. I aimed my weapon and fired upon the attacker, hitting him in the back of the left shoulder. The momentum then pushed Mr. Anderson over the railing. I rushed to assist him, keeping my pistol drawn on the suspect, but their attention had faded away from me by that point. They dragged the large standing mirror in the corner over to the balcony to get a better look at it. Surprisingly, the hideous figure seemed to be taken with something in the mirror, so much so that they reached out their hands towards it with a melancholy look.

A woman's scream of terror rang out. It sounded like it came from somewhere inside the room. The attacker's withered face looked as though it was about to cry as it took a step back. That's when Mr. Anderson flung his torso back up over the railing, knocking over the mirror, and pulling the suspect down over the railing to the rocky shore waters of the Prehville River below with a squelching thud.

“The way he looked at me as he fell…” said Anderson, as I led him out of the burning building, “Lighting crashed in the distance, and I saw the fear in his eyes. That was finally something I recognized… Seeing it these past few days, and even all those years ago…”
I sat Mr. Anderson down on the sidewalk before ringing the bell on the corner to alert the fire department. He seemed to be crying hysterically, muttering “Oh, dear god… It can't be! It simply can't be!”
Finally, I asked him, “What's wrong?”
“I promised not to let him down…”

Deputies have been dredging the river day in and day out since the incident, and as of 6:00 this morning the suspect's body has been found. Our coroner said that “It seemed as if this man had lived for centuries. Every organ in his body was functioning at the bare minimum level required. Every motion, every breath, every thought must have caused extreme pain to execute.""

The body was then given over to Mr. Anderson Rostminder, as he is the next of kin.

Anderson, or should I say Lloyd, has since been cleared of all charges. Although, I have firmly suggested that he make the rest of his stay in Tirnath short and final. He, along with Tirnath's own leading scientific experts, have all agreed that this strange artichoke shaped idol, which Lloyd claims is the cause of all this fiasco, should be encased in lead and dropped deep into the Melville Sea. A plan which he has agreed to execute personally. Though, once it was inside of the lead, all of us present got a sinking feeling. As if once the object was out of sight, it had instantly been transported to some other place, somewhere, some other time…

Mr. Lloyd was lucky, for without my testimony and rank in the police force to bolster it, his morbid and spectacular tale would most definitely not have been believed. All in all, I can't help but be thankful for that cursed artichoke letting me see my boy one last time.

March 18th, 1836

Dear Mother,

I’ve purchased a train ticket back to Darby for tomorrow. I am writing this letter along with my morning tea and peach scones at a shop called Crowning’s. Perhaps I’ll take you here one day. I plan to send this off once the ink is dry and my cup is empty in hopes it should reach the family estate in Darby before I. Believe me that I would leave today but there are a few urgent matters I must sort out here in town first.

I will be sending a copy of the police report along with it to back up my claims. Much has changed in this past week, as I am sure young Frederick has told you. A truly strange happening. I regret having to be the one to inform you and the rest of the family that he will not be returning home in the same state he left.

The only lighter news I bring is that, due to being built primarily of stone, the damage sustained to the Balthazar Estate was extremely minimal. After helping the police and city officials comb through the items that survived the fire, I was able to locate all fifteen of Ms. Balthazar's automatons mentioned in her dossier and the Mayor of Tirnath will be mailing off a letter to one Mr. Neville Wilson to inform him of their arrival within the week. The largest of these inventions was found last night down below, hidden away in a secret basement. It far dwarfs the others, but I’d rather you see what it is for yourself rather than spoiling it for you. Nevertheless, it seems her work has acquired a newfound appreciation.

I have changed much, though I suppose it will seem to you that I have not changed at all. No amount of apology could make up for the time I've wasted or the mistakes I have made. But it seems that recent events have lent me a whole new perspective on time itself.
It’s just as the lad said,

“Time is not a straight line. It’s a sequence of never ending moments folded over one another like the petals of an artichoke.”

I suppose when one pulls back too many of those petals, they end up with nothing left. Sometimes beauty is the unseen heart of the artichoke. I can only hope it's all over now.

Sincerely,
Lloyd Rostminder

My kids are active, fun loving energetic kids who adore each other and play most of the day. Our downstairs neighbors moved in 4 months ago. In their first week here, they sent their 10 year old daughter up to my apartment to tell us to be quiet because they were trying to sleep. This was at 8 pm and my kids weren't doing anything out of the ordinary other than running around a bit as toddlers do. Two days later they posted a sign that read ""BE QUIET"" in the hallway on our floor and next to the mailbox. I complained about this and talked to the maintancnce guy about it who removed the signs. The next day while my children were playing, they banged on their roof. I called the office about this too. I got a call the day after that at 8 am asking me what we were doing because they got a noise complaint about our unit. I explained that during that particular morning, my baby cried, my daughter was watching a cartoon and I had walked across the floor to make coffee. My husband and my son were still sleeping. (He works nights, so he sleeps in until I have coffee ready since I'm always the first one up). The officer manager didn't really have anything to say so she just wished me a good day. I began smelling cigarette smoke in our communal hallway which was new. A few days later when I came home I saw the downstairs neighbors smoking inside her unit, so I reported it to management. Tonight, my daughter was coloring at the table. I was watching a movie with my son and my baby. My daughter got a bit excited and started banging a bit on the table. The downstairs neighbor started banging on their roof again. They banged for a full 30 seconds and got more and more aggressive. I called the office about this too. 

Who's the a-hole here? I feel like me and my family are just trying to exist while these downstairs neighbors are being unreasonable, but I'm sure they feel the same way. I can't put my kids on time out just for being kids. It isn't our fault if the builders of this building didn't take more care in preventing noise from moving through the walls.

You have no obligation to be with this person if they are hurting you! If you feel stuck in your marriage or relationship because you know they “need you,” don’t e even because you love them, but they are abusive, leave. I regret not leaving and if he hadn’t left me I’d probably still be with him and we’d be trying for a baby right now bec that was the plan. You are worth so much more. Yes bipolar is something you can live with, but only if you really want to be healthy and constantly work on yourself. If your SO is like mine was, destructive and not lookin to improve, know you can leave. Take care of yourself first.

On a Wednesday, we stayed up all night giggling and making jokes in bed until 1 am.. the following Monday he left me suddenly…. Over text….

He just texted me coldly and calmly they he wants a divorce and he wants it to be civil, no fighting. While I was walking our dog. He saw me 20 minutes earlier and would have seen me an hour later…. A text.

We were truly best friends, especially early on. We were always the couple that people would come up to and say “I can truly see the love between you two,” “you two are my role models for the love I want.” We had so much fun together. We were silly, we’d giggle and make up songs and jokes. Always having the best times together.

The last year of marriage he kept telling me that my parents don’t have my best interest in mind and that my brother doesn’t love me. That my parents (who btw live 6,000 miles away) were ruining his life.

Now I know bipolar is a horrible and painful disorder to live with, but I truly believe that my ex husband used it as an excuse to be a bad person and to treat others poorly. On more than one occasion he said these words to me: “I want to see those who have wronged me suffer and in pain, and no one knows suffering like I do so I know how to inflict it.

I don’t want to get into the details of the divorce but he really worked so hard to try and make me suffer throughout. Even now, over a month since it’s officially over, I have so many messes to clean up because of him.

One more thing. I always said, bipolar people really need 2 things in order to be successful and have it “easy.” Those are: a really strong support system, and lots of monetary funds. He has both. Not only a wife who stood by him through it all (he was fully psychotic for 3-4 weeks only one year into our 6.5 year marriage). He also has 4 siblings and a mom who truly stood and continues to stand by his side. His father is a surgeon who does really well financially and his parents are willing to spend on the best of the best doctors, medications, tests, etc.

He literally has all the Tools he needs to live a relatively peaceful life. Instead he chooses not to see his doctors, not to take any meds and has 0 respect for the therapist he sees (or was seeing for 7+ years, idk if he still sees him).

So yes, it is a terrible disease. And also yes, some people use it as an excuse to be terrible and abusive.

2 weeks post separation:

A——-,

I miss my best fraynd. Not you, but the man I married. I miss A—— from 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 & 8 years ago. I miss the giggles. I miss you tickling me just to hear my laugh. I miss the jokes and the songs. I miss the cuddles. I miss naming our dog, and then renaming him a day later. I miss our love. I miss our friendship. You made me feel safe, secure, happy, taken care of. You were my ezer kinegdo. You’d make me fun and exciting snacks after a long day, cheese and snack boards with drinks and crackers. You’d wake me with coffee in bed, exactly the way I liked it. You loved me so much then. And I miss that A——-. I miss him so much. But he’s gone, and this is all for the best. For both of us.

1 month post separation:

A——,

The love we once had was so strong, it felt like a fairytale, I thought I was the luckiest girl in the world, and I was. We had true love, real friendship, and what I thought was an unbreakable bond. And we were teammates. I miss that A——, and I wish this didn’t have to happen now, but I know it’s for the best. I want to thank you for the things you’ve taught me over these years together, for the memories, the friendship and the love. I wish it didn’t end this way. I always pictured us making it to 30, 40 and 50 years together. But this is for the best, I can already see it for myself. I hope when you think of me you remember the good times, the giggles & the friendship. And please, give Walter (dog) ear twirls from me. We both know how much he loves those.

Your ex,

E——-

2 months:

A—-

You were so kind when I met you and you’ve completely deteriorated into some semblance of a person, especially in the last 2 years. You’re not a man, and for the sake of all women I am literally praying to god you never date again, although we all know you can never find someone that even holds a candle to me ever again. You are the worst person who has ever come into my life and the absolute best gift you ever gave me was that divorce. Thank you so so so so so so much because I literally feel like I was just revived from a near death experience. Have the life you deserve.

Yes, I know that last one is harsh. The man verbally and emotionally abused me for the majority of our marriage and I do not feel bad for having these feelings. Although he has a painful disorder, I truly know he is also a person with bad intentions",2,1766364790.0,BipolarSOs,1,1.0,False

I feel alone, I’ve tried college clubs, meet up groups, friend activities, paid/ free, volunteering. I’ve talked to people but never made any long lasting connections. One could say that’s just how adult friendships are but I wish for more. I spend so much time doing things I like alone 

In our 20s. I went to a cafe and saw someone smile at me but it kinda didn’t register. She comes in, orders and then I see it’s my old friends. I say hey! That’s all I could get out. She said hi see ya, and she waved and left In a rush it seems. She was carrying a few coffees. So that was my friend from high school, we were close since we live nearby. She went away to college and I didn’t but we maintained contact. In like 2022 we last hung out and then she did not invite me to her birthday for the first time, we stopped hanging out as much too so I think we drifted. It was pretty gradual. I can place down some ways I acted where I could’ve been a better friend. I was experiencing some bad anxiety at the time which I didn’t know was such, so I didn’t initiate plans as much. Wed go on longer hang outs and walk around etc, but with what I now know was agoraphobia I’d panic. 

I then recalled my other friend. We were best friends. We had a different connection where we’d come over to each others house, concerts, movies, went to each others graduation. I went to her sisters wedding. We were very close like big life events close. But she studied abroad, we kept in touch the whole time. She came home, and we hung out some few times. But after I was applying to grad school and got so caught up that I felt guilty I didn’t reach out. I decided I’ll wait because maybe she’ll reach out. We never spoke after that. I thought I was overstepping? I lost a really important friendship but I wondered had she not cared as much as I did. Anyway last year our moms saw each other and we ended up hanging out when our moms caught up. after we just didn’t. So I’m not sure.

It’s clean, has great service, is close to the parks, and offers solid food options. If you're not sure about staying at a non-Disney property, I highly recommend the Swan!

Hey everyone, I wanted to share my love for the Swan Hotel since I know a lot of people wonder if it’s worth staying at a non-Disney-owned hotel. I’ve stayed there four times and each experience has been excellent, so I thought I’d post a review to help others who are considering it.

**Location:**

The Swan is super close to the Disney parks. It’s within walking distance to both EPCOT and Hollywood Studios. There are also boat shuttles to some of the parks, which is super convenient. Magic Kingdom is the only exception - there’s a bus but since it drops you at the TTC you also have to hop on a monorail. That’s fine for me since I prioritize more time at the other three parks but mentioning since it might be a downside for MK fans. 

**Rooms:**

The rooms have always been clean, spacious, and comfortable. The beds are great, and the rooms always feel fresh. On one very lucky trip I got a room with a perfect view of EPCOT and could see fireworks nightly!

**Staff & Service:**

The staff is amazing – always friendly, welcoming, and happy to help with any requests. I’ve always felt well taken care of, and even though it’s not a Disney hotel.

**Dining:**

There are great food options on-site, like Il Mulino (Italian) which has a full service restaurant and a lounge. I eat at the lounge at least 2-3 times every trip. There’s also a great quick service breakfast spot that has breakfast sandwiches (that are actually tasty!) and coffee. 

**Extras:**

Since the Swan is in the Disney Resort area, you get some of the perks like Extra Magic Hours at night. It’s walking distance to EPCOT and HS but transportation is also incredibly fast (boat, bus, and walking - no skyliner).

**Final Thoughts:**

If you’re debating whether to stay at the Swan, I definitely recommend it. I have tried a few other true Disney hotels but come back to the Swan time and time again.",7,1766364558.0,WaltDisneyWorld,6,0.82,False

A buddy of mine said some good things about Reddit, so I figured I’d give it a shot! I've been traveling across the country (working remotely) and have been having a blast. It’s definitely had its high and lows, and I've met a bunch of different folks along the way -- but finding those lasting connections is obviously a little tough with this lifestyle. Hence why I'm here on Reddit. I put the location tag as US, since I'm not really restricted on location.

Here's a bit about me:

* I'm 40, male, and work in the medical field.
* I’ve been traveling full-time since last summer. I started on the east coast (NE), made my way through the Ozarks, and now I’m slowly meandering west.
* I love cooking, especially when I can do it outside. My go-to is a cast-iron skillet breakfast hash with whatever’s on hand -- potatoes, eggs, peppers. Hot sauce is a must, let's be real, haha.
* I'm a big reader. Right now it’s a mix of Steinbeck, some travel essays, and a book on neuroscience I like to pretend I understand.
* I used to be a runner, but now I’m more of a ""slow hiker who stops for photos and snacks"" if you get what I mean.
* I grew up near the ocean. I'm not afraid to laugh at myself, like the time I accidentally locked my keys (and shoes) inside the van at a rest stop in the middle of nowhere. Hey, at least it made for a fun story, right?
* I’m pretty low-key. I'm content with campfires, podcasts, stargazing, and the occasional dive bar conversation with strangers.
* I value good communication and people who can sit comfortably in both silence and long talks.
* My playlists jump from indie folk to old soul to 90s hip-hop, depending on the mood.
* I try to practice gratitude, even on WiFi-free days.

What I'm Looking For:

* Someone grounded, kind, and emotionally intelligent.
* someone who’s curious about the world, loves learning, and doesn’t mind taking the scenic route once in a while.
* I’m drawn to folks who can find beauty in simple things like a good cup of good coffee, a quiet morning - stuff like that.
* You don’t have to be a traveler (though that’s always a bonus), just open-minded, thoughtful, and looking to connect

And it’s exciting,"I find it very exciting so I wanted to share here! I travel a lot and I used to completely fast(inly drank black coffee and water) when I flew transatlantic or ordered special meals for diabetes although I’m not diabetic because otherwise my feet and legs would get swollen during flight and I felt so uncomfortable. I always packed open back sandals for the flights so I could change shoes.

I flew to Japan yesterday and the flight was 14 hours long. Because I quit fasting since I started tirz, I ate grilled salmon with small portion of rice, instant spicy cup noodle, sweets, 4 bananas, some candies, a bunch of Terra chips and the whole bag of Milano cookies. Thinking “1st week of microdosing Tirz isn’t suppressing any appetite at all!”

But here’s the huge differences I noticed. I did not bloat, digestion was good, I pooped on the airplane for the first time in my 20+ years of heavy traveling!!! And my fingers and feet are not swollen. Not at all. WTF!!!!!!

I got up super early this morning due to a jet lag(time home around 2pm) and I felt hungry. I ate another bag or Terra chips. Went out to get water and milk from the convenience store and saw this local bakery, so I grabbed freshly bakes Japanese buns. Ate one small one with half a glass of milk. And I’m full. I don’t want any more. And I feel a little bit sick in the stomach with the fullness.

I think it is starting to kick in. I am just so excited!!!!!

My first dose was 0.44mg this Wednesday. I have mild but persistent headaches so I will reduce the dose to 0.22 and inject on day 6. I feel much better today and Shortsy says now I probably have about 0.25mg in my blood. I think that’s where I want to stay. Weird numbers are due to my Brello concentration of 2.2mg per 0.1ml(10 units). 1 unit is 0.22.

I texted eleven friends to invite them. Nine came and I heard back from the other two, who had other plans. I'm pretty newly disabled so it was a big deal. I've been pretty isolated this year and I'm not on social media with friends anymore. I had a friend come and help me get set up this morning. 

. I held it from 12 to 4. This morning I had a fruit plate, cheese and crackers and a cake delivered, along with flavored water and a coffee maker. (I usually have a french press but wanted something bigger so I splurged for a coffee maker in the hopes I'll entertain more). 

I don't drink and no one brought their own but we shared a couple big ol spleefs and spun records and talked. It was a lot and I'll probably have to spend tomorrow in bed but it was worth it and I have a lot of gratitude. I'm also proud of myself for reaching out and doing that for myself, and that they responded with kindness and came. It was the best birthday ever. ",34,1766364286.0,LivingAlone,11,1.0,False

He was very attentive and kind tho. Then he later sent me a picture of himself a day later and I felt shitty but the truth is I was not attracted to him. So I politely told him I’m sorry and how he’s moving too fast, how this won’t work. He said ok and keeps saying how he will slow down but I’m just not into it . I do feel shitty rejecting but hey it’s how I feel and yeah it was too fast and I was being love bombed like crazy. I guess I learned my lesson from “dating blindly” lol. Should I block?

i've been one who's been unlucky with side effects, and into 5mg it's been rough. i take my shot saturday night before bed and usually on sundays and mondays i feel the worst. i have to use zofran a few times to actually function. what's worse is i have a vomiting fear, but i haven't actually vomited yet. i had a terrible bout of constipation after my first shot of 5mg but have kept that at bay by upping my water consumption and utilizing mag07 during the first few days of the week. unfortunately i've been dealing with some loose stool and stomach cramps the last few days.

today i feel terrible. i struggled to get out of bed and laid around all day. i haven't eaten. i tried to have some coffee some hours ago and immediately got hit with nausea and had to take a zofran. 

i need help figuring out what i can eat. this is difficult for me given i come from a past of low-carb diets that consist of high protein, high fat meals. i'm not familiar with lower fat eating. i made a meal i ate a lot on keto, literally just 93/7 ground beef, cream of mushroom, and green beans and experienced terrible cramping the morning after the third day i ate it. so i haven't eaten it since. i eat a lot of eggs & bacon. but beyond that i don't eat much else because i'm scared of the gastro effects.

what works for yall? i'm not huge on veggies, but i love my green beans. i have a ton of frozen ground beef that i'd hate to go to waste as i spent a ton of money on it pre-zep during my last ""keto"" stint. varying levels of leanness. chicken is not a safe food for me but i'm open to trying to make it work as a normal food!",1,1766363867.0,Zepbound,3,1.0,False
1pslrtb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychosis/comments/1pslrtb/what_was_your_psych_ward_experience_heres_mine/,What was your psych ward experience? Here's mine,"This was a few months ago. This was all drug induced. 

I got admitted extremely manic and psychotic. 
I felt totally awesome, a god, unstoppable, could read minds and manipulate people at my will. Somehow I was aware enough to have myself admitted at the ER and then placed into a psych ward.
I was the most powerful being on earth and could feel things normal me can't really explain.

I was put on 6mg risperidone, 60mg valium + 20mg extra if I wanted, 1500mg valproate, and later on also 4mg akineton, and 400mg gabapentin. And thorazine when I had really dark thoughts. 

I was completely sedated. Like, could-almost-not-speak sedated. Also chewing was impossible for a whole week. Lost 7kg from not eating, 53kg at 180cm. 
I couldn't dress myself, brush teeth, text family. Couldn't even smoke cigarettes because I was unable to move my fucking lips.

My god it was awful. Though during that time I was still so manic that I felt fucking great besides some moments of lucidity where I realized just how fucking sedated and disabled I was and felt. And destroyed some shit, or at least tried before getting a syringe stabbed into my ass.

At night I woke up multiple times screaming from unbearable AND I MEAN UNBEARABLE pain because I would literally not move an inch while asleep, so eventually my muscles would cramp up and I'd wake up, still completely unable to move while half of my body had cramps. The nurses had to move my body to stop the cramps. Each. Fucking. Night.

Ok, three weeks pass. I can still read people's thoughts and am the most charmful person on this planet, feel awesome. but am slowly going insane in this clinic (more than I already was). It's hard to explain the feeling of feeling both extremely euphoric and distressed at the same time. Really the movement disorder from the antipaychotic was the worst 

With the help of my family we organize a move to another clinic. 

It gets worse. 

They stop all benzodiazepine meds. No taper. 
Also lower my gabapentin, risperidone, and akineton (good that they lowered the risperidone)

the psychotic delusions settle. Now I feel only amazing without the distress I had in the other clinic. Still somewhat manic? More on the hypomanic side. 

I somehow was drinking 15-20 coffees a day. Normal me can't drink two without feeling awful.

The fun part:

Mania settles, withdrawal sets in and akathisia: 
A week into the stay at the new clinic I'm not manic anymore, but instead, depressed as fuck. That's expected but now I actually start feeling the valium missing. I somehow didn't feel the withdrawal before but now I feel like I'm going insane. Plus, the risperidone causes akathisia (at least to me), and I literally feel like I'm exploding on the inside. Like I'm about to pop. It was pure horror. 

Imagine staying in an uncomfortable position and feeling that feeling of needing to change position. Okay now keep staying in that position until that feeling becomes absolute torture. Now imagine finally relaxing, standing up and stretching...but the feeling doesn't fucking stop. It still feels like you have to get out of that awful position, yet there's no way to make it stop. 

At least I could sleep tho. That was my only savior.

I eventually freaked out, begged the doctors for help but all they said was that they couldn't do anything about it. And some people told me it was because I had cravings. Ah yeah, after a month clean, fucking cravings. That's why I couldn't sit still for a minute and felt like killing myself to make it stop. 

Eventually, they changed my risperidone from morning to the evening. And the problem fucking vanished. They proposed that change after I don't know how many requests I had made. 

I literally had a BPM of 140 sitting still my god. (No, I wasn't drinking any coffee at this point anymore)

No joke, I spent almost 3 weeks in unbearable agony where I felt like I was having a panic attack unless I stayed in my room and rolled from side to side in my bed, just because of one medication. (Probably because of benzo withdrawal too, no idea why they didn't taper me)

Fuck this shit. 

Anywho I'm now out of the wards and feeling much better. Have a long way ahead of me with staying clean from drugs as to not have another episode and cause drugs suck the joy out of life eventually. I finally understood that.

Jessica, couldn’t blink away the image of Dr. Morris’s body on the floor. No matter how hard she tried it was at her feet. His last words had barely passed her ears before he was just laying there. She tried not to turn her head to look at Pat behind her. He’d never shot anything other then paper targets, Same as her, same as every other reserve member walking single file down the hall. Now, he had blood on his gas mask. She could hear him trying to breath through the filters, it sounded like he was choking back tears.

They’d just killed a man for uttering a sentence, and burned his body to ash. Her own breath caught in the mask, the smell was foul with fear and sweat from being stuck in it for days now. Scotty, was the other man behind Pat. He stayed quiet for the first time since they’d gotten assigned here. The two had dragged the Doctor to the burner. She’d been too stunned to move. She hadn’t processed, Mason’s order. She felt guilty for freezing up, and leaving Pat and Scotty to shoulder the burden. The hall was barely five feet to the next room. But it felt like a mile till they got to the airlock room.

Pat, collapsed the moment his boots got in the room. He stripped his mask off before anyone could stop him as he retched into a trash can. Scotty, put his back to the white tiled wall and slid to the floor. He held his head and rocked back an forth. He kept almost reaching for his rifle till Mason scooped it up.

Sgt.Mason about the only person here with a modicum of actual military experience. He held himself together with it. “Pull yourselves together, people.” He grabbed Pat by the shoulder and growled at the man. “But your fucking mask back on, Son!”

Pat, didn’t speak just trembled there looking at his bloody mask. Mason shook his head and Scotty threw his helmet. “How’d the Doctor get infected, Sarge?

The question shook some of that hardcore military attitude Mason was using as a shield from the situation. He looked at the floor. “I… I don’t know. The room was suppose to be sealed. It was suppose to be contained, dammit!”

Jessica felt her legs weaken. It was suddenly unbearably hot in her gear a cold sweat had started running down her back. “Could we be infected?”

Scotty threw his helmet at the wall screaming a curse at the possibility. Pat slid to his knees crying. “I shot the Doctor. Oh God, I shot him.”

“Where is the real army?” Jessica asked searching for away out of this.

Mason’s hands trembled with anger at the question. “We are the army, Dammit!”

“No the fuck were not!” Scotty shouted rushing the Sargent. He did everything except put his hands on Mason. “Were Reserves, public volunteers for a crisis. I didn’t sign up to be an extra in a monster movie!” Mason started the motion of shouldering Scotty’s rifle, when Scotty stepped back with his hands palm out. But he didn’t stop talking. “So, where are the real soldiers, the scientists, the back up, Sir?”

Mason slowly took his hand off the rifle allowing it to drift down. He wouldn’t look any of them in the face. He swallowed before speaking, “The entire building is in quarantine, no one out, no one in till we understand this thing better.”

Pat had checked into the conversation at the wrong time. “So were fucked.” He cried scooting to sit in the corner. Scotty, went over and put a hand on his friend’s back. They spoke softly to each other as Jessica tried to even her breathing so she didn’t pass out in her mask. She stepped aside and made a motion with her head for Mason to follow.

“Sir, do we even know the symptoms of this? How do we know if we have it?” Her voice was even despite the freight train of fear that was running through her.

Mason shook his head, “The Doctor was suppose to decipher that. He was working on a report.”

“All due respect Sir, but he isn’t gonna be talking anymore, Sir. Can we even get another Doctor?” Jessica tried to use the Military attitude like Mason had, but her breath was through clenched teeth, and her respect for the chain of command was already dwindling.

Mason leaned over her shoulder, “EVERYONE, Decontamination scrubs, now!” His sudden shout made her jump to attention. He leaned back to whisper to her. “Private, I will file that suggestion during my report. Uncle Sam is debating how many bodies they want to throw at this problem. They think this is some new type of flu. Not…” He paused shaking his head. “Not whatever the fuck is actually in that chamber.” A greater sense of dread over came her as he put a hand on her shoulder. “I need someone to man the burner till we get back. Since your the last one I can trust to not eat there rifle at the moment.” He looked back at Scotty and Pat. “That’s you, Private.”

Jessica froze again, her mouth clamped shut as her eyes locked on his. Silently begging Mason’s finest of pardons. The hand on her shoulder gave it a firm grip, telling her he knew. But he needed her to stay strong. It didn’t hide the tremble in Mason’s own body. Scotty, pulled Pat to his feet and let the crying man lean on him as they passed her towards the airlock. Mason, handed her a security card on a lanyard. She took it grinding her teeth in her mask at the realization they were actually going to leave her here. Before opening the sealed door, Mason turned back to her.

“Jessica, Watch the burner fuel, and stay out of the observation area. Booth is to your right.” Mason’s voice was light as if he was debriefing her on a simple guard spot. Before she could pull the card from his hand. His grip tightened on it. The lightness in his voice dropped as he looked her in the eyes. “Dr.Morris’s computer and notes are in the booth. I’m lifting the usual sensitive information bullshit, for twelve hours. Find us some answers, Private.”

Jessica watched them leave, feeling the weight on her shoulders triple in the matter of sentences. The key card hanging off her finger suddenly felt heavier then the rifle slung over her shoulder. She took a deep breath, before heel turning towards the two door ways. She ran a thumb over the key card in her hand as she approached the right door. The little black box beeped green and she heard the door unlock. “What the fuck am I doing?” She asked herself stepping down what looked like a plastic covered throat. It felt alien stepping into Dr.Morris’s former living quarters. Her breath in her mask was too loud for the silent space around her. The repurposed break room actually made her miss the barracks. It was barely a broom closet worth of space. A server rack was hastily put together in the corner next to a camping cot. Following the rats nest of cables to a desktop on a lunch table. The table wasn’t even visible for the canned coffee cans that stood in batches of sixes. Empty boxes were stacked taller then the computer beside it.

Whatever Morris was managing to do, Sleep was a luxury he couldn’t afford. The chair had a visible dent in the cheap cushion. Seeing the awful canned coffee made her miss the coffee shop she’d always hit after her morning runs. It’d been a week on this awful assignment and God knew how much longer they’d be here.

Settling into the chair, Jessica had to take a deep breath when her hand hit a coffee can the moment she reached for the computer mouse. The clutter was suffocating when it was already hard to breath. She clenched her fists allowing herself a small moment of selfish fury. Breathing in, Jessica unclipped her helmet letting her blonde pony tail free and unbuttoned her fatigue top. For added measure she knocked a couple cans to the floor. It was such a stupid bit of catharsis. She breathed out, and finally moved the mouse bringing the screen to life.

Her heart stopped for a moment. A camera feed was centered in the middle of the desktop, and the first thing she saw was Dr.Morris’s skull on the floor. Jessica had to look away till her throat unclenched enough for her to breath. Seeing it again after a short time was jarring to think about. They’d just burned a man to bones on the floor and here she was watching his remains a room over. She felt unclean on so many levels. God, she missed stacking sandbags in a field, standing at drill and training for disaster relief. Hoping maybe she could have helped save a family or some shit. Something moved in the corner of what her eye could see of the screen. The jolt of her heart made her squeeze her eyes shut. She rocked in the chair. She wasn’t built for this, minimizing the screen, Jessica started searching the documents folder for anything Dr.Morris might have left behind she could actually read.

Jessica was far from a computer person, everything she ever needed was on her cellphone. That precious piece of tech was confiscated when they entered the quarantine. But simple enough, there was txt. files labeled by system date, going a week back. She narrowed her eyes realizing there were more then just a week. Two weeks of notes, She guessed that’s when they set up the computer and camera systems. But, an extra week stuck on a cot in a break room. Hell, had to be less stress on a person’s body then that. She was desperately dancing around the issue and main reason she was now replacing Dr.Morris in his personal hell. She needed to learn what they were even dealing with. Mason, and Pat, knew about the observation room and the burners. Yet, she was pretty certain her and Scotty had never been informed about anything that was going on in this part of the Hospital. They’d arrived after the initial lock down was created.

All they knew was there was a sick man in the basement, and whatever he had was bad enough they needed to figure out how he got it and ensure nobody else got it. Correction all she knew about the situation. Certain details of what Morris and Mason had been talking about, suddenly made her hair stand on end. If there was simply a sick man in the basement, they’d ran the burners twice. One for Patient Zero, and one for the doctor. Boom problem solved, no one left to spread it. Jessica, folded her hands in front of her mask’s filter. “We’ll try the script again, tomorrow…” Her eyes drifted to the minimized camera system. A flashing red triangle had popped up sometime ago, she’d been ignoring it for her own sanity. There was a monster in the basement, with her.

Hesitantly she moved the mouse over the icon, and the camera popped up eager to show it’s horrors. Dr.Morris’s bones were gone from the floor. His skull had been moved to sit next to another she hadn’t seen before. It wasn’t a human skull, in the black and white feed it was hard to see but it looked like a reptile skull, based on the long snout and many teeth that lined the sides of it. It was massive compared to Morris’s. Nearly twice the size and long enough the tip of it hung over the edge of the metal examination table. She took notice of the time, 5:00PM. She tried to search the mess of cans for a pad of paper or something to write that down. She hesitated to look away from the camera. But with nothing but trash within reach. She had to mouse away to open a new text document. Jessica’s heart was pounding in her chest after she opened it and typed the time with the description -BONES GONE, NEW SKULL ON TABLE-

Jessica nearly cried at the prospect of reopening the camera. She knew something would have changed and she wasn’t ready to deal with the fright it would cause. She opened it and sure enough both Skulls were now looking at the corner of the room vaguely in her direction. Jessica whimpered “Yep, fuck, OK…” She told herself they weren’t really looking for her, she had just knocked over some cans while she was looking for the paper. It was loud, and the noise merely… Merely did what? Make the skulls turn? They were bones on a table. Something had to have moved them or else they wouldn’t have moved at all. Jessica rocked in the chair deeply uncomfortable. Man the fucking burners, he says. Oh God this thing whatever it is. It’s gonna come back. How much time do I have before it’s scratching at the glass again? Jessica thought to herself frantically. She ran a hand over her oily hair in distress. “OK, please for the love of God, Morris. Please tell me you have something useful about this thing.”

She opened the oldest file first and cringed away from a very detailed photo of a man missing his left eye, that popped up. Jessica gagged in her mask seeing the empty socket just staring at the camera. His face was lumpy. Like his skin was being pushed off from the inside. Two massive lumps were on his forehead like something had beaten him with a blunt object. He was smiling even though he was missing most of his teeth. His lower jaw was coated in a thick black sludge. The remaining right eye was sunken in a bruised pit, like the eye was being pulled into his skull. She had to tear her eyes from the photo to read the caption. *-Pete Davidson, Age 28, 5 ft in, Weight 300 lbs, at time of admission to Saint Mary’s ER under police custody. -*

Jessica shook her head in shock, The man in the photo was practically a skeleton with some organs. He was swimming in his work shirt. The name tag read DAVID. Their was no way he weighted that much. The name and work shirt, they struck a cord with her she couldn’t place. She scrolled down seeing another photo rolling its way up and into her nightmares for later. David was strapped to a bed. All kinds of monitoring equipment were strapped, stabbed, and attached to him in various ways. The skin on his hands had darkened, several fingers bent in broken angles. She swore she could see blue bones sticking out a few of them. The change in color dulled the trauma of what she was seeing. She just didn’t know why. A bandage was wrapped over his eyes, the right was filled with black that seeped down his smiling face. The smile wasn’t happy, it looked like something had eaten a hole straight through his cheek and the only muscles left were locked up in a smile. Things had slowly stopped being real to her at this point. She swallowed the foul taste in her throat and read the next caption. *-Two days after admission, Deterioration of the facial tissue continues despite treatments to the area. David’s right eye was removed by patient. Hands have been restrained to prevent any further self harm. David shows no sign of distress or pain from his condition. Keeps repeating “He’s the Healthiest, He’s ever been.” when asked about his condition or how he may have contracted it. Eye has been sent for testing within the hospital. Quarantine precautions have been set up, CDC notified awaiting response.-*

The next Image Jessica couldn’t even linger on for her own sanity and stomach. It was autopsy photos of David with his stomach and chest vivisected. She scrolled fast till only Morris’s notes were visible. But it offered a terrifying preview of David’s empty eye sockets peering just over the edge of the bottom of the screen. Shaking her head she re-sized the screen to remove it. She focused on the next note. *-Day five, Mr. Davidson was declared deceased by nurses. Body was moved to the morgue for further examination. I’m at a lost for what finally ended David’s time on this world. Over the past few days his attitude towards the doctors and nurses never falter or changed in any negative way. All tests were negative for any skin disease, Yet something was eating him from the inside out. All test on the black fluid came back normal. As if whatever this disease is, it can just pretend to be healthy cells. The eye taken for testing, liquefied to the same black material in a sub-zero fridge yet when put under a microscope it was so dark nothing could be gleamed from it. Its perfectly inert, it can’t be frozen or boiled. But exposure to direct flame does cause it to condense and become brittle like glass. Once cooled the pieces melt to the same volume without loss. His memory was growing weaker, and he was losing the ability to remember people once they left direct sight. We feared the disease had reached his brain and was starting to eat away at core parts of him. Rather they were finishing the job so to speak.-*

Jessica, could feel the Doctor was starting to lose professional structure of his notes. The note continued still, her heart ached for him. *-Before David’s passing, I was able to build something of a routine with the man. At the beginning of every shift, I’d introduce myself and ask why we were seeing him today. He’d walk me through his symptoms. Lack of aches and pains when getting out of bed. Smoother joint moments for seemingly no reason. He was adamant that he hadn’t made any life style changes. Yet, his body was lighter he felt better then ever before. When asked if he’d seen any other doctors about the change. A mystery was finally solved. Apparently his family Doctor had told him , “He was the Healthiest he’d ever been.” When contacted The family doctor hadn’t ran a single test on the man the first time he walked into his office despite David’s plea that something wasn’t right. I can’t say I blame the doctor for it. I may have done the same for him. Yet, I find nothing but contempt in my soul for the man. Maybe if this had been investigated sooner. The young man might still be with us. Autopsy will be performed once proper barriers are set up for containment.-*

Jessica shook her head and scrolled up finding the Autopsy photo had been added before the entry stating they hadn’t done the autopsy yet. Her heart bled even more for the tired doctor. Probably pasted it in the wrong section. She squirmed rolling past the eye-less David underneath. The more she saw the worst it got. His entire face was gone exposing bone and teeth. She swallowed feeling the burn in her throat getting worst. But scrolled back He had teeth back where he didn’t in the first picture. Blue crystals were forming in the empty jaw sockets were his teeth use to be. It grew like bright blue bone spurs on the white bone. Rooting and spreading from cracks within the skull like crystal veins. The two lumps on his head in the first picture. They were two large spiked crystals growing right out of his forehead.

OK, she saw the connection in the disease between Morris and his patient. She just couldn’t figure out how a disease turned bone into crystal like that. Unless the Doctor was grinding and snorting a dead man’s cancer crystals how did it spread to another person? Was the bone crystals a late stage or an early stage sign? She had a lot more questions, and nightmares to process then she had answers. Her head was starting to hurt from the influx of information. Reaching down she pulled a unopened can of coffee from a opened pack under the table and cracked it open. The second the can lip bounced off her mask. Jessica nearly cried wondering if death was preferable to not having caffeine in that stressful moment.

Dr.Morris had spend weeks in the room, safe drinking his coffee. without a sign he was infected. She gulped remembering the crystal growing on his skull. Even back here through three sealed doors and a hallway of disinfected plastic. He still got infected, somehow. Was it airborne, or did something else transmit it. Jessica stopped and stood up from the computer. She didn’t have a clue what she was talking about, at this point she was quoting action movie phrases and stuff she’d heard from zombie movies. She glanced over at the camera feed. The crystal skull was bleeding black from its eyes and mouth onto the table and floor. Jessica, could only make hand gestures of bewilderment at what she was seeing. “I’m in a fucking zombie movie, Jesus Christ.”

Jessica, had to sit with her head in her hands for a moment giving her eyes a break from the horrors. David…There were millions of people who went by David. But why was this one grinding on her brain. Sighing she scrolled back to the first page and stared at his lumpy mostly human face. His face was completely unrecognizable in its state. brown hair, named David, worked at a coffee shop. That was everything she knew about- Her hands fell away as she fell back into the chair. Two weeks ago, her coffee shop had been closed by the police before she could get her morning coffee. Putting the puzzle together didn’t make the situation any better. Suddenly, the world was way too small for her liking. This David had to be the flirty barista she’d been getting coffee from for months now. She couldn’t even remember what his face looked like before this. Jessica shook her head no, that was way to close to home. She was merely imposing herself into the whole situation. there was no way.

She dug into the document folder looking for anything to disprove the growing theory. She smirked finding one labeled medical records. She skimmed over the pages of boxes looking for anything that stated his address or place of work. Both were a double tap to her nerves. His apartment was in the city, and his occupation was listed as Amateur geologist, and LOCAL BARISTA. She screamed a curse as she hurled a empty coffee can at the wall. She not only knew him, he’d flirted with her, SHE’D FLIRTED BACK, now he was a fucking monster in the basement, right next to her.",3,1766363551.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

His gaze.
Brief. Almost accidental.
Toward a tent at the edge of camp.
Astarion notices at once.

“Well, good morning,” he says with an innocent smile.
“To the man who feels absolutely nothing.”
He takes a sip of wine and tilts his head.
“I’m endlessly fascinated by how people in complete emotional neutrality keep checking one very specific direction.”
Karlach stops nearby, watches for a second, then laughs.
“Wow… you really don’t feel anything, do you?”

Jan doesn’t answer.
He just keeps drinking his coffee.

No gesture.

College educated, fluent in English, sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits because nothing says thrilling drama like corporate loopholes and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.

I don’t drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, in which case I’m basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less clubbing till 2 a.m. and more building pillow fort empires and bingeing Netflix until cliffhangers leave me emotionally bankrupt. Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

You send memes that perfectly capture life’s chaos because sometimes a GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

I shut off the faucet, dried my hands, briefly adjusted my tie in the mirror, and when I looked down, shit, there it was: a rolled-up square of loose-leaf paper, propped against the side of the drain, held tightly together by what appeared to be a strand of thin black thread or yarn. I pinched the end and dropped it in my palm. Dry as dust. Not an ounce of moisture on the damn thing. 

It didn't make much sense.

“Very funny...” I muttered, chuckling. The words simply reverberated around the empty men’s room.

I twisted my neck side to side - nobody.

I peeked under each stall, figuring I’d catch Tim squatting on a toilet, suppressing a wolfish giggle, but found no one.

It was a strange prank, undeniably, but that wouldn’t exactly be out of the norm at *Happy Harlot Advertising.* 

*They must have lobbed it into the basin when I was distracted...* \- I thought.

Did that explanation make sense? No, not at all. I mean, if that was the case, why didn’t I hear the hinges of the bathroom door creaking? Why didn’t I catch a glimpse of someone in the mirror? Or, better yet, a glimpse of the note flying through the air? 

But I ignored those nagging questions and tugged at the thread.

The note unfurled. I dragged my fingers across the paper. Whoever wrote it did so with force; so much force that they created tiny indents in the looseleaf.   

In jagged blue letters, it read: 

*“HE IS TRYING TO STEAL WHAT IS YOURS”* 

“Who? Tim?” I whispered.

My heart began to gallop. My thoughts grew feverish, imagining myself being fired for what felt like the millionth time. Visions of being replaced by Tim, a younger, smarter, more passionate version of myself: the inevitable upgrade. Pressure built along my skin. Hostile gravity threatened to crush me like a soda can disappearing under the wheel of a steamroller. 

I crumpled the note into a ball before it could do the same to me and launched it into a trash can. 

The thread, however, was harder to dispose of. Not only did it feel nice running between my fingertips, but, strangely, it made me feel safer in a way that's difficult to put to words. Same sort of safety you'd feel carrying around a lucky charm, I guess. I felt protected.

And as long as I ignored one final question, that sense of protection would remain firm.

*Why does this feel like hair...?*

I pocketed the strands and jogged out of the bathroom.

\- - - - -  

An hour later, Fox called my team to the boardroom for Tim’s presentation. I suffered through it with a pit in my stomach like I’d swallowed a cannonball. 

It was...good. 

No, that’s not true - his presentation was *great*. Genuinely remarkable. His proposal was innovative. His methodology was cost-effective. He sold it all with such zeal, such unshakable confidence. There was fire behind his eyes. 

That was his whole *schtick* \- passion. The man had convictions. He felt everything very deeply. 

*Must be nice.* 

I slumped back in my chair, faking a grin, toying with the hair in my pocket. When that wasn’t providing relief, I swapped to old reliable: my fidget ring. A mobile, spinnable band over a stationary inner band. A tactile outlet for my never-ending worry. 

Afterwards, Fox pulled me into his office and closed the door. 

“So - what’d you think? Pretty stellar work, no?” 

I paced around his office, avoiding eye contact, thumbing the hair in my pocket. Could Tim really be gunning for my position? It wasn’t the first time I had considered the possibility; the man’s a wolf. 

Every man’s a wolf. 

“Uh...Pete?” 

“Hmm?” I stalled my hectic pirouettes, unaware that Fox had sat down behind his desk. He gestured towards a nearby chair. 

I winced; lowering myself into the seat forced my hands out into the open. 

Reluctantly, I let go of the hair, spinning my fidget ring to compensate. A series of grinding *squeaks* emanated from my knuckle. Originally, the fixation was noiseless; time, friction, and inclement weather had rusted the bands to the point of musicality. I prayed the sound wasn’t bothering Fox. 

The CFO’s eyes narrowed. 

“Right! Right. You asked me about Tim's presentation...""

I trailed off, distracted. Jagged letters scribbled in blue ink rocketed to the front of my skull. 

*HE IS TRYING TO STEAL WHAT IS YOURS*

“I’m getting the sense that you have...concerns?” 

I paused.

Then, a lie tumbled from my lips. 

“Well...some of the imagery looked...borrowed.” 

Fox leaned forward. His shoulders tensed. 

“You believe his work was plagiarized?” 

I scratched the back of my head, contemplated the potential ramifications of doubling down for about a quarter of a second, then nodded. 

“Alright then. Thanks for being transparent with me, Pete.” Fox closed his eyes and threw his glasses onto the desk. A sigh billowed from his lips. As I stood up, every inch of my body began to tingle. Liquid stress seeped into my veins. My heart rate violently accelerated. 

*What the fuck did I just do?* 

The rest of the day devolved into a hazy panic. Didn’t get a shred of work done. Instead, I split my energy right down the middle: half went to avoiding Tim, half went to keeping myself from vomiting. When I arrived home a jittery mess, Arden was quick to wrap her slender arms around my aching shoulders.

“Oh, I’m sure they’ll understand,” she said, running a tender hand along my side. When my fiancé got dangerously close to my pocket, I slid my fingers between hers and gently guided her away. 

“You made an honest mistake. Nothing more, nothing less.” 

Sleep evaded me that night.

I tossed and turned, writhing well into the morning hours like a man possessed. Contingencies required planning; I needed to practice how I’d respond in every potential scenario. The lies had to be second nature so I could focus on controlling my body language. 

Much to my horror, I encountered Tim in the parking lot the following morning.

He stomped past me, face flushed the bright red of a bell pepper, twitching, mumbling under his breath as he wrenched his car door open. The man sped away and he never came back. 

Later, I learned that when Fox confronted him about his presentation, he completely flew off the handle. Screamed his innocence loud enough that the damn whole office heard it. Even went so far as to hurl a coffee mug in the CFO’s general direction. It’s unclear whether he *intended* to hit Fox or not. Regardless, he had to duck out of the way to avoided being pelted by it. The mug shattered against the wall, leaving a pile of ceramic shrapnel in its wake.

And that was that. 

Tim was fired on the spot. 

*Passion is as passion does, I guess.* 

At first, I was borderline euphoric with relief. Before long, however, that relief began to sour, and a certain unease trickled back into my skull. 

I was alone in the break room, rinsing flecks of caked-on lasagna from my Tupperware, helplessly lost in another mental labyrinth.

*Yes, objectively, it’s not completely my fault. If Tim had better control over his emotions, he’d likely still be working here. Still, I’m not blameless; I was the catalyst.* 

I only looked away for a moment. 

When I turned back, there it was, propped against the side of the drain, tied at the center by a strand of someone’s hair. 

Note number two. 

I plucked the dry scrap of paper from the basin and began unfurling it. 

*Then again, if he* ***was*** *trying to steal my job, my goddamned livelihood, then maybe a preemptive strike would be justifiable...ethically speaking...*

The hair was blond that time. 

\- - - - -

Over the next week, I decided the thing in the pipes needed a name. It's not that I was talking to Arden about it - God no - it’s more that names make things safe. 

*“Rattle”* seemed as good as any other. 

The more messages I opened, the more I received. The more I received, the more I was able to perceive the thing in the pipes. No matter where I was, I’d hear it: a dull, shaking rattle, like a pool ball clanking around the inside of a washing machine, radiating from the walls, or from the floor, or from deep within the earth. It wasn't continuous. If I heard the noise, that meant a delivery was imminent. 

Was the phenomenon disturbing? Seemingly impossible? Laughably absurd? Check, check, and check. 

But did I care? 

Not in the slightest. 

Rattle was helping me.

I likened them to a guardian angel, vigilant and steadfast, keeping an invisible eye peeled for the leeches and the predators that wished me harm, weeding the wolves from my company. 

I wasn’t *sure* that my sister was dead-set on convincing Mom to cut me out of her will. Granted, I had my suspicions, but I never had the evidence to prove it, not until Rattle came along. It was a similar situation with Calvin. Who would’ve guessed he had been calling me a hack and sell-out behind closed doors? I mean, I sort of did. The moment I left the band to focus on my career, his attitude towards me shifted 180 degrees. Cold, vacant stares. Forced smiles. Never sat next to me at the bar anymore. The changes were subtle, but they were there. I just needed proof, and the thing in the pipes was more than happy to oblige. 

Of course, Rattle wasn’t perfect: the notes often contained small clerical errors. For example, my sister’s name is “Meg”, not “Marge”. And the note about Calvin mentioned him despising me for leaving the “team”, when it should have said the “band”. Wasn’t a problem. In both cases, I knew what they were *intending* to say, and, far as I could tell, Rattle was right about those bastards every time, so what did it matter?

Months flew by.

During that time, Arden started growing distant. Strange glances from her side of the bed before she flicked the light off. Curt, loveless text messages. I feared the worst, but didn’t want to jump to conclusions. 

My fiancé was still at work when I heard a rattling below the floorboards that evening. 

I pushed myself from the couch, plodded into the kitchen, and stood over the kitchen sink. 

*Any second now.* 

There was a faint scent drifting through the air, one I had trouble placing. It was woody, but with a peculiar hint of sweetness. Eucalyptus with a drop of honey. Whatever the scent was, it didn’t raise any red flags. In fact, I found the phantasmal aromatherapy quite relaxing. As I waited, my finger stopped incessantly spinning my fidget ring, and the grinding *squeaks* stopped in turn. Silence blanketed our house. Even the muffled rattling had ceased. 

That silence didn’t last. 

Maybe if I had been paying attention, I would’ve noticed something was desperately wrong. 

*Did Arden really have to “stay late” at work tonight, or is that a cover? An alibi? Is she using again? Cheating on me? Could be both, no reason it couldn’t be -* 

A low, whirring clamor blared through the room. Cold metal cradled my wrist. Artificial wind pushed between my fingers, like the breeze from a fan cranked to its max settings.

My right hand was pressing into the drain. 

The garbage disposal was on. 

I leapt back, ripping my hand out. A searing pain exploded across my middle finger. Cereal boxes and cans of soup clattered against the floor as my shoulders slammed into the pantry shelves. Eventually, the discord settled. Excluding my labored breathing, the house was silent again; the whirring clamor had disappeared. Across the room, the switch for the disposal was in the “off” position. Never turned it on, never turned it off. A warm, slow ooze crawled down my middle finger. The alluring scent had been replaced with the sharp, metallic tang of exposed blood. 

Trembling, I examined my hand. 

A nickel-sized slice of skin had been cleanly excised from above my knuckle. The injury was superficial. No wound to sew back together; just a patch of raw, gushing tissue. I wrapped the finger with paper towels and crept over to the sink. 

A note was resting in the drain. The accompanying hair was silver and brittle. I opened it, surprised to find that there was a second note concealed inside the first. Rattle had never done that before. 

In jagged blue letters, the larger read: 

*ARDIN IS SLEEPING WITH HER BOSS*

In delicate black typography, that second, smaller one read: 

*It’s time, Pete. It’s time to come down here. It’s the only way I can truly protect you.* 

There was a flicker in my chest. A brief rebellion. An honest recognition of the outlandish situation I’d found myself in. Before that ember could bloom, however, it was snuffed out. 

A sweet, woody scent slithered up my nostrils. Eucalyptus and honey. 

My mind began to twist. 

*I can’t believe Arden is cheating on me...*

*- - - - -*

“Admit it! Just admit it!” I screamed. 

My fiancé ignored me. She continued to stumble around our bedroom, throwing handfuls of clothes into an open duffel bag, eyes red and glassy, cheeks coated with a sticky layer of dried tears. 

“There’s nothing to admit, Pete.” 

“Right, sure - then why the hell were you late?!” 

She swung around from her wardrobe and bellowed:

“Because we have a deadline, for Christ’s sake! I’ve told you this! I’ve told you this so - many - goddamn - times!” The screech of the closing zipper punctuated her appeal. She launched the bag out into the hallway and stomped past me. 

I paused the interrogation.

My consciousness felt divided, waging war with itself, each half intent on tearing the other limb from limb. Unequivocally, my body believed her. My marrow was on fire, screaming that I was making a mistake. My mind, however, would not yield. No plea would be enough. No evidence would be satisfactory. She was too perfect to have settled for me. Something had to be amiss. 

From behind me, I heard:

“Where the fuck is the Kindle charger, Pete?” Arden ripped open my nightstand’s bottom drawer. Normally, it required a key, but it was an old piece of furniture. In her rage, she’d pulled on the handle with enough force to break the aging lock altogether.

My righteous indignation evaporated. Waves of icy panic surged down my spine. 

She was looming over the drawer, rendered motionless by its contents. 

I kept the tufts of hair on one side and the notes on the other.

By that point, the drawer was nearly full. 

A bevy of useless half-words lurched over my tongue, none of which provided even a semblance of an explanation.

Eventually, I mustered something like: 

“I’ve been receiving...messages.” 

The only thing she said in response was: 

“But...this is your handwriting, Pete.” 

Arden slung the duffel bag over her shoulder and practically sprinted from our home. The front door slammed shut, and I was still in our bedroom. 

I was used to feeling relief after confronting people with what Rattle divulged to me, but that time was different. At that moment, alone in an empty house, I did not experience relief. 

I just felt hollow. 

The minutes that followed are a bit of a blur. 

I don’t think I passed out. Not fully, at least. I floated above my own body, but I couldn’t really see anything. Just shapes lumbering through a thick, blinding mist. I resigned myself. Embraced the detachment. I didn’t feel worth the trouble of it all: letting Rattle protect me was much, much easier. 

Then, it hit me. 

*What’s the point of protecting myself if I don’t think there’s anything worth protecting?* 

The paranoia untangled. The mist cleared. Painful remorse fell over me like a landslide. 

I peered down. 

I was in front of the sink. 

But the drain was triple the size it should’ve been. It nearly covered the whole basin. Thick globs of ash-colored fluid glistened around the quivering metal rim. Hundreds of thin, pearly needles lined the yawning cavity, jutting out from a material that had the color and consistency of velvet: crimson, plush, smooth.  

Rattle’s lips,

and Rattle’s mouth,

and Rattle’s teeth, 

and my right arm was elbow deep within the maw.

I attempted to yank myself out, but Rattle was too quick. 

The drain snapped shut, narrowing the exact diameter of my arm in the blink of an eye.

I screamed. 

Feebly tried to pull it out again, to no avail. 

Then, movement: 

The mouth began twisting. 

\- - - - -

The doctor was very interested in hearing how I managed to flay the majority of my right arm in such a spectacular fashion.  

Lying in the hospital bed, my stump wrapped in gauze, I informed her I’d be more than happy to explain, but she needed to answer one question for me first. The young woman nodded. 

I leaned forward and whispered:

“Behind me, in the wall, do you hear that?” 

The doctor let loose a nervous chuckle and assured me that sound was simply due to noisy plumbing. Initially, her response left me crestfallen, but then, without prompting, she added:

“I will say the noises in your particular room are a little...strange. Shrill. Scratchy… ”

“Almost like grinding metal?” 

She nodded again. I breathed a long, heavy sigh of relief. Best I figured, if she could hear it too - the fidget ring spinning inside the pipes in the walls - that meant I wasn't insane.

It also meant Rattle was still following me.

“Why do you ask? What do you think it is?” 

I laid back, flipped away from her, dragged the blanket over my head, and shut my eyes tight.

I work as an inspector for construction. It can be busy at times, especially in the busy season for us. Funnily enough has nothing to do with my education, being kinesiology. 

I enjoy outdoor activities like hiking, camping, bridge or cliff jumping into water, or slow relaxing nights watching a movie. It is nice to spend time with those you care about and just appreciate the laughs and fun with them. Big movie fan, also love coffee and good food. I do enjoy working out and sports as well. I try to keep healthy with fitness and what I eat. 

My journey in my faith has certainly been an interesting one. I came to it genuinely and seriously while in college. I began digging into the word and repented and turned my life around. Simply put I desire to live according to God's rightly divided word, as I come to more understanding through study. Feel free to ask anything about it that you may have questions on.
I simply identify as Christian, or a follower of the Way in other words.  

I am looking for someone who simply wants to pursue God genuinely and live according to what God teaches as they know as well. As they grow, just someone willing to continue growing when faced with more understanding. Of course a best friend who I can share the ups and downs of life with, fun adventures and all. Humor is a big one as well haha. Physical attraction is part of it, would prefer someone who is healthy and takes care of themselves. 

25-35 not a hardset but just an outline. 

Willing to do long distance of course if I find the right person. 

Looking forward to hearing from people.

1pslbdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1pslbdf/i_failedmega_long_read/,I Failed(Mega long read),"Perhaps it's because of timing? It's not an excuse.  But I feel it's a noteworthy discussion. 

It's not really the holidays. Not really the end of the year stress.

It's the weather. I'm not used to it and it's brutal.

I'm going through an unwanted divorce, had a birthday a few days ago etc.. and I'm wrapping up the court costs of a DUI from a year ago. Lots of stress. My divorce papers arrived the day before my birthday(my wife is not dumb).

The stress I can handle. But being cut off from the outside for the most part due to weather...well I can't discount it. Not to mention my personal location(worst case scenario even when it's nice outside). I live next to a fence factory, a saw sharpening place(yup that exists), a nail salon supply store(not even a salon, just the supplies), tire places etc...it's revolting visually. 

I can't go for a walk. I mean, I can, physically. But No one would do that in my disgusting neighborhood. I am poor. My neighborhood is useless on most levels. My home just ""a place"". I have to use my car for most everything. There is no coffee shop or or park or anything remotely civilized within walking distance. The gas station across the street is the closest thing for food or whatever. So be it. It doesn't matter in the long run.

I have my job. My car. And my stuff(I'm a musician, or I once was). I rent a room in a house with a stranger who is not my friend and it's clear we never will be. This isn't even my hometown. I moved here with my wife for her job. A year in, she wanted a divorce. Never mind that story for now. Basically I'm stranded in some dumb city I would have never moved to(my job is great, so there's that, but I do not like the people and my big plan is to move..again).

I did take this into consideration when I ""quit"". I figured it doesn't matter. I have a home. Electricity. A car... what else matters?

I'm looking at upcoming months of snow. Freezing temperatures and exactly nowhere to go for the next batch of months. I can't take a walk. I can't really do things like go to the gym. Definitely not read a book in the park and feed the birds or whatever. At least not right now or the next few months. 

I suspect I set myself up for failure subconsciously. I quit right before the holidays. My birthday(no friends or family here). The anniversary of a friend's death. Holiday work stress...and my divorce from my beloved wife etc..

This is not a ""get out of jail for free"" thought. I honestly believe I couldn't have picked a worse time to quit. For the record, I'm not used to massive snow or freezing temperatures. My home state was a little more forgiving as far as weather.

I know that ""right now"" is always the best time to quit this evil drug. But I also believe the devil in my brain knew in advance that I would fail given my circumstances. 

I've had some minor ""field research"" experiments in the last months, but I was so dedicated to ending this nightmare, I didn't worry about them. I do not drink at home and I do not use a car in these ""research"" moments.

In three months I've caved three times. Went to the bar(walking distance)to be around people and have my usual poison. These were one-offs that didn't turn into anything usual for me. Didn't go to the gas station for more etc...didn't actually get wasted like I want. Successfully cut myself off and went home(with massive guilt). Unto itself that is an unprecedented achievement in my disgusting case.

I guess the point of this is to discuss timing. All practical signs point to failure. I don't plan on being a drunk anymore. I don't romanticize booze. I won't ever drink at home. I don't have a support system as I don't have friends or family who live here. It's just me, totally alone in life in my sad rented room. So be it. I lean towards what some here would call religious, so there's that. 

I just can't right now. Cooped up in my sad little room with a TV and microwave meals, it is, or can be quite depressing. This is just the wrong time to  take on such a big task. And it's only the beginning. A month from now snow will be a big deal. An hour spent carving out my car just to go to work. Rinse and repeat. It was kind of fun when I was married. This is my second year here. Not fun.

Forgive me, my friends. Forgive me, lord. I won't be a drunk. It's just not my thing anymore. Nevertheless I will cave. Probably tonight. I don't like people in general, but getting cut off from the outside, parks, a coffee shop etc.. I can't take it.

This is just not the right season to take on such a daunting task for me. It's a recipe for failure in my opinion. It's embarrassing on all levels, yet I cede. I will moderate until I can go outside and not die from freezing sideways snow. Or die from loneliness(it's a very nice try on the part of the devil, but I'm way too interesting and smart to give in).

Dear Satan: bring it on. I'm going to destroy you when I regain my strength. You won this round. Not the next one. I swear on the Bible I'm going to tear your fake soul in two and eat it for breakfast. 

Forgive my rant and my current upcoming ""field research"". I'm just hoping that perhaps one other person realizes they took on such a task at the wrong time and can relate. If I'm flat wrong please tell me.

And as far as ""quit lit"" is concerned, read The Art of War by Sun Tzu. Because this is a war. I should have re-read it before starting this journey. One of the main takeaways is ""Know your enemy"".The devil isn't stupid. And he knows me very well. Another part is timing which includes resources. Do you have the resources? Does your enemy? This is just War 101. I conveniently forget the rules of war.

Again, my brothers and sisters, I'm so sorry for the rant. I'm on team quit. Quit for good. I didn't mean to end up in hell. None of us did. I'm just saying pick your battles. But again using The Art of War, *pick* your battles. This was...is...not my time to win a battle beyond anything other than survival. For me personally, my bad. I was arrogant. I did not expect the power of satan.

However, I will not give in. I will freeze. Eat rats and worms. All winter long. But I will not die. I won't give in. 

God bless and never give up.

It was great; we spent all of it talking to each other non-stop. Conversation felt warm and natural, it was not awkward or interview-like at all. We shared laughs and lots in common. At the end, she spoke of perhaps seeing each other that weekend. I asked her out again the day after (Tuesday) and she didn't even get my message until the day of the next date, which was supposed to be on the weekend. I waited a few days and sent her a reminder the day before. I told her if she was still interested in seeing me, here's my number, text me.

She took my number and finally texted me on that weekend; she apologised and was upfront that she already had plans to see some old friends for Christmas celebrations that weekend and that she was heading to her parents for Christmas; she asked me if she could see me in January and said she looked forward to it. Since then we have just been chatting a little on text but she has not replied to my text for a week now. Should I just chalk it up to her forgetting to respond amidst the busyness of the holidays or that she is just not interested?

In general, she seems to be not very good at responding to texts. Before our first date, we texted maybe once every day or two, which is fine and to be fair, during our date, she did tell me that she doesn't go on her phone much and that she takes even 1-2 days to respond to close friends. Judging from her WhatsApp 'last seen', this seems true: she literally checks it maybe once or twice a day.  She further warned me that she was going to have a busy week (she even moved our first date up to Monday so that she could see me ASAP).

Her texts have never ever been dry; sometimes they are a paragraph long and she often asks me questions. This lady has always been quite straightforward with me. Before our first date, she let me know that she was interested in me romantically as opposed to being just friends. She was slightly late on our first date but texted me to let me know. She is such a lovely person and even offered to pay on the first date. I'd be shocked if she was 'playing games' or 'ghosting'.

In your experience, does texting really reveal how into you a person is? If I do see her again, what the best way to say I'd appreciate it if she respond a little more often? Like even one message every 2-3 days would be fine.",1,1766362310.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

1psl6fa,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLettersRaw/comments/1psl6fa/the_meaning_is_not_found_it_is_created/,The Meaning Is Not Found — It Is Created,"Over time, I’ve come to realize that the meaning of life is not a single answer or a formula you discover once and keep forever. Rather, it is a constant dialogue with oneself, a construction that changes with time, with losses, with love, with mistakes, and with those small awakenings that shake us from within. Sometimes we believe life should “have meaning” like a clear map, with precise instructions, but it rarely works that way. Life is more like a path that only makes sense in retrospect, when we look back at everything we’ve gone through and realize that even what hurt had its place.

Many people spend years searching for meaning outside themselves: in success, in recognition, in a relationship, in an ideal. And while all of that can bring satisfaction, it rarely fills us completely. Because the deepest meaning usually doesn’t come from what we achieve, but from how we live what we are given. From the coherence between what we feel, what we think, and what we do. When we live betraying ourselves, even if we seem to “have it all,” something inside breaks. On the other hand, when we remain faithful to who we are—even in fear—an unusual peace appears, quiet but real.

I believe suffering plays an uncomfortable yet fundamental role. No one seeks it, no one desires it, and yet it is almost always there that something essential is revealed. Pain forces us to look at ourselves without masks, to question what we thought was true, to let go of versions of ourselves that no longer serve us. It’s not that suffering is the meaning of life, but that it can become a source of meaning when we go through it with honesty, when we don’t run from it or deny it. Often, after hitting rock bottom, we clearly understand what truly matters and what was just noise.

There is also meaning in simplicity, even if we don’t always know how to see it. In a coffee taken without haste, in an honest conversation, in caring for someone, in laughing at oneself, in telling the truth even when it’s uncomfortable. We live in a time that glorifies the extraordinary, the visible, the spectacular, and because of that we forget that life mostly happens in the everyday. Meaning doesn’t always feel like euphoria; many times it feels more like calm, presence, being at peace with one’s own conscience.

For me, the relationship with oneself is central. If we don’t learn to inhabit our own inner world, no external experience is ever enough. Knowing oneself, accepting oneself, forgiving oneself, setting boundaries, being compassionate with one’s own shadows—all of this is part of meaning. We didn’t come here to be perfect; we came here to be human. And being human implies contradiction, falling, learning, and also the ability to choose differently again.

I’ve come to think—and to realize—that the meaning of life is not found; it is created. It is created every time we choose to love instead of hardening, every time we are honest about what we feel, every time we take care of who we are and what we offer to others. Perhaps life has no universal meaning, but it does have a profound value: to be lived with awareness, with truth, and with the courage to be oneself, even when that hurts. And maybe, just maybe, that is more than enough.",4,1766362135.0,UnsentLettersRaw,1,1.0,False

Forest roads with no cell service, the quiet logistics of overlanding, the slow math of fuel range, weather, daylight, whether the road will forgive you or not. It’s the only time my brain fully shuts up.

I’m better outside than I am inside a bar trying to be charming. I'm into blue collar dudes who notice the small things: how the ground smells after rain, the way dogs sleep harder after a long hike, how a long drive can reset something that felt unfixable an hour ago. I like sleeping near water, cooking something simple on a tailgate, and pretending for a night that nothing exists beyond what fits in the back of the truck.

Escaping into nowhere feels romantic to me in a quiet, unshowy way. It’s the kind of romance that happens when the world gets reduced to sky, ground, and whoever’s sitting beside you. I like the way distance strips things down; how conversations soften, how silence stops feeling empty out there, with nothing asking anything of us. We make coffee in the cold, watch the light move across the land, and for a little while it feels like we’ve stepped outside of time, like wanting less is the same thing as having enough.",0,1766362063.0,R4R30Plus,1,0.2,False
1psl55u,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentTexts/comments/1psl55u/the_meaning_is_not_found_it_is_created/,The Meaning Is Not Found — It Is Created,"Over time, I’ve come to realize that the meaning of life is not a single answer or a formula you discover once and keep forever. Rather, it is a constant dialogue with oneself, a construction that changes with time, with losses, with love, with mistakes, and with those small awakenings that shake us from within. Sometimes we believe life should “have meaning” like a clear map, with precise instructions, but it rarely works that way. Life is more like a path that only makes sense in retrospect, when we look back at everything we’ve gone through and realize that even what hurt had its place.

Many people spend years searching for meaning outside themselves: in success, in recognition, in a relationship, in an ideal. And while all of that can bring satisfaction, it rarely fills us completely. Because the deepest meaning usually doesn’t come from what we achieve, but from how we live what we are given. From the coherence between what we feel, what we think, and what we do. When we live betraying ourselves, even if we seem to “have it all,” something inside breaks. On the other hand, when we remain faithful to who we are—even in fear—an unusual peace appears, quiet but real.

I believe suffering plays an uncomfortable yet fundamental role. No one seeks it, no one desires it, and yet it is almost always there that something essential is revealed. Pain forces us to look at ourselves without masks, to question what we thought was true, to let go of versions of ourselves that no longer serve us. It’s not that suffering is the meaning of life, but that it can become a source of meaning when we go through it with honesty, when we don’t run from it or deny it. Often, after hitting rock bottom, we clearly understand what truly matters and what was just noise.

There is also meaning in simplicity, even if we don’t always know how to see it. In a coffee taken without haste, in an honest conversation, in caring for someone, in laughing at oneself, in telling the truth even when it’s uncomfortable. We live in a time that glorifies the extraordinary, the visible, the spectacular, and because of that we forget that life mostly happens in the everyday. Meaning doesn’t always feel like euphoria; many times it feels more like calm, presence, being at peace with one’s own conscience.

For me, the relationship with oneself is central. If we don’t learn to inhabit our own inner world, no external experience is ever enough. Knowing oneself, accepting oneself, forgiving oneself, setting boundaries, being compassionate with one’s own shadows—all of this is part of meaning. We didn’t come here to be perfect; we came here to be human. And being human implies contradiction, falling, learning, and also the ability to choose differently again.

I’ve come to think—and to realize—that the meaning of life is not found; it is created. It is created every time we choose to love instead of hardening, every time we are honest about what we feel, every time we take care of who we are and what we offer to others. Perhaps life has no universal meaning, but it does have a profound value: to be lived with awareness, with truth, and with the courage to be oneself, even when that hurts.

1psl4m5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dispatchgame/comments/1psl4m5/beat_the_game_today_it_was_okay_but_i_really/,Beat the game today. It was okay but I really liked some parts.,"First, I just want to paste my initial review on steam (which I couldn't post due to using family share...) made immediately after finishing.

""7/10. I can only describe the writing as ""marvel,"" lacking a more eloquent term. Many of the jokes are childish, the world feels lack-luster- and that would be fine, I don't mind thin world-building so long as it does not interfere with the story or come into view- yet, the game somehow constantly throws these world inconsistencies into your face to the point they're impossible to ignore. Characters are simplistic, but they were fun, and I liked hearing them banter. Don't buy it, pirate it, or wait for a sail of over 70%.

But that's not really my problem. It's what makes me give it a ""not recommend"" but personal dislike stems from something else. That is purpose, of which I felt Dispatch had none.

I don't believe every work of art needs a ""purpose,"" creating and displaying one's expertise can be purpose enough, yet, when I think about Dispatch, I feel nothing. I do not feel passion, I do not feel as if the writers had something to say. I see something akin to a witch's brew of tropes that culminate into a sludge of ""okay, I guess.""

Dispatch could've been really good. A series of trolley problems, lined one after another; what things are more worth saving? Nothing new, not in storytelling not in superhero stories. Yet, allowing YOU the player to make those choices, is the kind of storytelling only a game could do.

But Dispatch never takes that opportunity. It is essentially just a tv-series with (admittedly rather fun) gameplay sequences in-between. It's just dull, honestly.""

Most of the my negative's haven't changed (I think Shroud was an awful main villain, the world-building gets in the way, and the writing is juvenile too often) but after a few hours I want to give a more balanced look at what I did like.

I think the best thing a hero series- especially one focusing on a team- can do is make you like the members, and buy their chemistry, and goddamn does this game do that. I like all of them, and I think the gameplay harmony was brilliant. Due to the nature of the gameplay, none of my members were disposable, every time one was on rest, or the one I NEEDED at that moment was injured, I was stressed! These were my guys, MY team, and I felt bad when I sent the wrong ones or when I managed time badly and had to miss calls. I criticize the games inability to meld story with gameplay, and I think that's true, but I think it is better put that the story did not want to meet with an excellent harmony.

The writing *is* very childish, but some of the jokes were good. I can get behind juvenile humor, it just felt too overbearing and left a bad taste more often than not. I wished they more leaned into what the members were like as villains for humor. The running joke of Sonar admiring some rich guy, or on the first shift calling in himself to arrange a meeting? All excellent, and it's sad the game never tries to dig into criminal behaviors/history for humor with the others.

I called the game ""purposeless"" and I think that's true, but I don't think it necessarily needs to be true. To me, the greatest failings of the game are at the end, where it simply peters out, falling to a rather trite ending and character beats that do nothing with the game's strengths (either story or gameplay).

Of course, I'm no writer, and I won't claim to know better than the ones who made Dispatch, but I think a hypothetical 2nd season could improve greatly by doing away with most of the Shroud and Robertson family storyline. It's not the interesting, and takes away from what I actually care about, which is the personal and heroic lives of my team!

On the whole, I enjoyed Dispatch. It's not amazing, and it almost certainly needed a few more drafts, but what's here is good, and I fully believe there's plenty of room for more.

I'm hoping for a S2.

(Also, here's an awful potential man meme I made before finishing).

what helped (this is gonna sound dumb):

started going to this coffee shop every morning for like 3 weeks. same one. just forced myself to say ""thanks"" to the barista and make eye contact. that's it at first.

week 2 I added ""how's your day going?"" felt awkward as fuck but I kept doing it.

by week 3 the barista started conversations with me first. sounds small but it like broke something in my brain. realized people aren't analyzing everything I say.

then I tried it at my gym. small talk with the front desk person. then random people between sets. gradually got less weird about it.

now I can actually have conversations at parties without wanting to die. still not perfect but way better than 6 months ago.

idk if this helps anyone but that gradual exposure thing really worked for me. don't try to go from 0 to 100 overnight, that's where I kept failing before.

I’m planning to build out a coffee cart and I’m debating between a La Marzocco GS3 AV and a GS3 MP. I’m also considering a Linea Mini paired with a connected scale.

What I’m trying to optimize for is future-proofing: something I can grow into as volume increases and as my workflow gets more dialed (consistency, speed, repeatability, ability to train others later, etc.).

My questions
	•	For a coffee cart workflow, which GS3 version do you think makes more sense: AV or MP, and why?
	•	Which setup is more consistent under real service conditions (rushes, imperfect puck prep, different baristas, etc.)?
	•	Does the MP’s manual pressure profiling end up being useful day-to-day, or does it slow things down / add variability?
	•	Is the AV the better call for speed and repeatability once you’re serving customers?
	•	For those who’ve used it: does a Linea Mini + connected scale get you “close enough” in the cup and workflow to justify the smaller footprint/simplicity?
	•	Maintenance/reliability-wise for mobile use: anything you wish you knew before choosing?

Context
	•	This is for a mobile coffee cart, so I’m factoring in workflow speed & consistency.
	•	I care about great espresso, but I also need something that holds up in service and doesn’t become a bottleneck.

If you own or have worked on any of these in a service setting, I’d really appreciate your take — especially anything you’d do differently if you were buying again.

I just came out of my first relationship that lasted around a year and a half. She was amazing at first but then slowly started treating me terribly. It started with her trying to stop me from having my own friends then her complaining about me being in work too much and then being with my family too much. She even complained about me going to visit my mum in the hospital instead of wanting to spend time with her. In the last few weeks she would become physical and lay hands on me and grab me etc. This relationship broke me and I feel so alone now. Even though im out of that abuse I feel worse. I'm a good looking guy but I just feel like no one understands me or will ever like me. All in all I just want to die. All I spend my time doing is going to the gym everyday and going to work everyday and thats it. Its driving me crazy. Im also heavily addicted to stimulants at the moment. Upwards of 1.5g of caffeine a day (pre workouts, coffee, energy drinks etc) but to be honest im hoping I'll have a heart attack soon enough anyway. i'm also really close to starting to use steroids as i guess im hoping it'll make me feel better about myself and distract me from the loneliness by focusing more on the gym.

But I have zero friends currently who know I'm even queer. And that's a whole thing of like, am I supposed to be low-key, am I supposed to want to connect with queer people or make no extra effort, am I supposed to make it a big part of my personality so that people have to engage with it? I've come out to people and had absolutely nothing about the pace or tone of the friendship change, and frankly that bugged me because I deemed these people important enough to tell and they felt no anything as far as like, ""do you need help working through this?"" which would be my reaction to someone coming out to me.

**Original Movie/Show Title:** Glass  
**Original Running Time:** 129 minutes  
**Fanedit Running Time:** 113 minutes

**Synopsis:**  
I went into this movie with expectations for a super hero story about David Dunn taking on two super villains. That's not what this movie is about and the original feels like it takes a dump on that right away. Dr. Staple always seems like she had an ulterior motive, and the pacing felt like it was deflated of all suspense. So here we try to keep that suspense throughout the movie, using Dr. Staple as a stand-in for the public (and frankly rational) view of superheroes, and only reveal Dr. Staple's motives at the end, in true M. Night form. We also give power back to Mr. Glass in the end, letting him orchestrate the final video footage proof rather than hope others do. Mr. Glass himself truly wins in the end.

**Intention:**  
Another movie I wanted to love. But it wasn't nearly as good as Unbreakable, and the ending left a bad taste in my mouth. So my goals are to:

* Remove and much “Comic Book” exposition as possible
* Hide Dr. Staple’s POV and motives until Kevin is shot (to make her seem synonymous with the public view of these people)
* Remove Dr. Staple trying to work with Casey to save Kevin (the Black Clover Society simply plans to kill him)
* Keep the question about the validity of the Kevin and David’s superhero claims in question as long as possible
* Changed the ending to make Mr. Glass the cause of the worldwide video release

**Changes:**

* Removed initial Overseer encounter
* Trimmed Dunn Security scene and removed “Salt Bae” reference
* Removed David alone at home scene
* Removed Dunn Security store scene with M. Night
* Removed Kevin in skates and hostages scene
* Removed Kevin in the sewers
* Removed shot of Dr. Staple in her office watching Kevin being taken into hospital
* Trimmed Dr. Staple discussing David’s room with him and reordered shots in her introductions to David and Kevin
* Removed Dr. Staple’s line “I came here for you both”
* Removed scene of Dr. Staple in her office reviewing files on Mr. Glass
* Removed shots of Casey in the lunchroom
* Remove shot of Joseph’s picture at Casey’s school
* Shortened administrator’s discussion with Casey about Kevin’s capture
* Trimmed Casey’s meeting with Dr. Staple
* Removed Casey’s meeting with Kevin
* Trimmed Dr. Staple’s camera explanation.
* Removed Joseph at the YCMA watching body builders
* Remove Dr. Staple needing to read a note to remember to call out Kevin’s full name
* Remove David’s childhood drowning flashback
* Changed “this and an anchoring incident and you…” to “this and an anchor and you…” to instead refer to Joseph and not the childhood drowning incident.
* Trimmed Comic Book Store employee scene
* Removed “first name mister. last name glass”
* Trimmed office scene with Dr. Staple, Casey, Joseph and Mrs. Glass
* Removed Dr. Staple asking Casey to help
* Trimmed water tank fight to remove David “realizing” the walls are cracking
* Trimmed Kevin’s death scene to remove the part about needing to clean the pants
* Trimmed David being dragged to the puddle
* Trimmed Dr. Staple’s discussion with David while being drowned
* Trimmed Dr. Staple’s discussion to remove the reference to being a 10,000 year organization and that “its not fair”
* Removed Dr. Staple watching Tower news on computer after discussion with hospital staff
* Trimmed Dr. Staple’s discussion with the Black Clover Society to remove questions from the group, the part about moving on to a new city, the part about a machine, and the part about “not being executioners” (they executed David)
* Trimmed Dr. Staple browsing the comics store with luggage
* Trimmed Dr. Staple realizing Mr. Glass’s plan with the security footage
* Moved shots of Mr. Glass in the Security camera control room to when Dr. Staple is realizing his plan
* Added an alarm sound when Dr. Staple checks footage that is meant to signify a trigger for the footage release at the hospital.
* Reordered final shots to seem like Glass releases the videos to the world at the same time the videos are sent to Casey, Joseph and Mrs. Glass
* Selected only one part of Mr. Glass’s monologue, “I believe that if everyone sees what a few people become when they wholly embrace their gifts, others will awaken” and used it as a vocal trigger whenever the mass-released footage was started.
* Removed coffee on bench shots and discussion

1pskwy9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pskwy9,Safe for hot water? Food safe?,"My grandmother had a whole set of these: teapot, coffee pot, sugar bowl, creamer, cups and saucers. I believe she may have glazed them herself in a pottery class 50-some years ago.

Now that they're mine, I'd love to make tea in this pot, but I'm not sure if it's safe for hot water or even if it's food safe.

As someone who already was burned badly from a similar experiment years ago, I thought I'd ask for advice before pouring boiling water into it!

1pskwkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1pskwkn/moving_to_princeton_for_work/,Moving to Princeton for work,"Hey everyone,

I’m moving to Princeton in about a month for work and wanted to get a realistic sense of what life is like there. I’m coming from Alpharetta, Georgia, so pretty different pace and layout.

A few things I’m curious about:

* **Work–life vibe:** What’s the general rhythm like around Princeton? Does it feel more like a quiet college town, or more commuter/corporate?
* **City feel:** How lively is Princeton day-to-day? Are there walkable areas, coffee shops, things to do after work, or does it get sleepy fast?
* **Car vs no car:** Do I actually *need* a car? I’ve heard mixed things. I’ll be working in West Windsor Area but would like to get around cheaply if possible.
* **Cost of living hacks:** Any tips for saving money on rent, groceries, commuting, etc.? Trying to be smart about expenses.
* **Things you wish you knew before moving:** Anything that surprised you, good or bad, especially if you moved from the South.

I’m early 20s, moving solo, and trying to balance saving money with still having some quality of life. Would appreciate any advice, neighborhoods to consider (or avoid), or general heads-ups.

Thanks in advance!",6,1766361392.0,newjersey,13,0.75,False
1pskwej,https://i.redd.it/2t51d02f8n8g1.png,The perfect accompaniments for holiday baking! Diptyque Étincelles and my Lucy Sparrow x Diptyque tree.,"My Sunday has been filled with hours of holiday cookie baking ([NYT Gochujang Caramel Cookies](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023675-gochujang-caramel-cookies), [Taylor Swift Iced Chai Cookies](https://vegnews.com/taylor-swift-iced-chai-sugar-cookies-made-vegan), [Gooey Molten S'mores Cookies](https://thebananadiaries.com/best-smores-stuffed-cookies-vegan/), [Raspberry Shortbread Sandwich Cookies](https://vegnews.com/recipes/vegan-shortbread-raspberry-cookies-vanilla-icing)) and Diptyque Étincelles has been keeping me company all afternoon. 

Last year, my absolutely wonderful Diptyque sales associate also sent me the Lucy Sparrow tree as a gift. I'm not gonna lie, he's stayed out on my shelf all year. He's simply too cute to put away. 

Étincelles is a divisive holiday candle, but I really love it! I got it at the sample sale this year, so the stakes were also nice and low. It's so much like Feu de Bois, but with a spiciness, a coffee note, and a little hint of chocolate that FdB doesn't have. While I know FdB is an objectively stunning candle, it's just too strong for me. I grew up in a big bonfire area, and the smell of it on my clothes for days after was always appalling and not comforting to me. Étincelles softens it in a way that works perfectly for me, so I'm def a big fan!

Is anyone else burning/warming some previous holiday editions? My 2022 Sapin candle is going to my grave with me. I feel like a fine wine collector for having an opinion on this, but I think it's the best year Sapin has ever had. ",17,1766361379.0,luxurycandles,2,1.0,False

1pskuha,https://www.reddit.com/r/SchreckNet/comments/1pskuha/a_southern_winter_solstice_elysium_report/,A Southern Winter Solstice Elysium Report,"[The following thread is posted and constantly updated during the course of the night]
Part 1: 5 PM local time 
“Tonight’s the night” ~ Dexter Morgan, who would’ve made a great Tremere 

Guysssss I’m super excited! The stage is set for the largest and most intricate Elysium of the year. I’ve been absolutely buzzing with energy for the past nights. This is a huge deal for me. For those of you who haven’t kept up with my posts, I’m responsible for catering tonight for all the kindred. Since it’s the winter solstice, the Elysium has to be bigger and better than any other. Also, every kindred (except for duskborn, since our Prince despises them) in the domain must attend under orders of our Prince.   
I’ve actually been spending the past few nights in the museum (location of Elysium) to make sure everything is ready. We’re going to have live vessels rotating around the halls with little necklaces symbolizing their blood resonance. We have rooms in the basement meant to refresh their resonances as well, from a rage room to a plush space with calming music, to a group sexual activity room. I’ve also set aside some rooms for vessels who have partaken in a couple vices, from alcohol, to tobacco and weed, coffee, and even some hallucinogens, nothing too hard though. The vessels in this room aren’t allowed to leave, though, since I don’t want a random kindred unknowingly partaking if they abstain.  
Also, I’ve been working on producing numerous bottles of blood that I even had a local neonate Toreador write labels for. I’ll have these bottles cooled and then warmed in a sous vide setup I have running. The Keeper’s ghouls will be carrying these around on trays for those who do not wish to partake in live feeding or do not wish to leave their conversations. There are also a handful of Nos in the Keeper’s employ who are running security and surveillance. People should be arriving any minute, so I’ll talk to you guys later! 
[Picture with metadata removed and faces digitally altered: Selfie in a large mirror with a group of people. Most wear white shirts with black ties and black pants and jackets. They are carrying trays and bottles of blood in a preparation room. The figure holding the phone is a dark skinned black woman wearing a stark white dress with a plunging neckline and black heels. She's flashing a peace sign at the camera and is wearing a few pieces of gold jewelry.] 

Part 2: 8:32 PM 
Things are going well so far. There was a brief incident with a Gangrel who partook in some potent choleric blood, but that was dealt with. We have a herald from Atlanta, which was surprising. The Herald, a Banu-Haqim, brought word that the Sabbat are very much still in the city, but are in conflict with the Cam there. The chantry there is in a state of decay. Also, a new kindred was introduced to the city tonight! A new Malkavian, they seem nice, although a bit distant. He followed his sire around like a shadow. I hope he’s able to acclimate to these nights soon. This is the latest embrace since mine 8 years ago. 
The Sheriff of the city was in attendance, and we had a short conversation, and I even got him to dance, which was hilarious. Picture a 6 and a half foot brujah, built like a linebacker dancing surprisingly gracefully. A joy to behold, truly. It's nice to see such a stuffy kindred living a little. The room itself seems filled with happiness and good conversation. 

Parts 3: 1:43 AM 
I was circulating through the party when I stumbled across the Prince, who remarked on the quality of the blood. I smiled so much. That smile was ripped off my face when I overheard the Keeper taking credit for all of my hard work. He flaunted his “knowledge of blood preparation”. Talking literal nonsense about how he prepared the blood and vessels by covering them in wine and oils. He even accepted the Prince’s request to provide refreshments for the next Ventrue Council meeting. He doesn’t even know the half of the effort it takes to produce all this blood in a masquerade safe manner. Ughhhh, I swear it’s just like you guys warned me about. I’m appalled he had such a smug look on his face. Later on, I brought him down to the preparation room and spoke plainly. I demanded a major boon for tonight, as well as the same level of boon any time he required my services going forward. He had to accept; refusal would mean losing face with the court as well as being proven as a liar to the Prince. I found the nearest Harpy, and the Keeper logged that he owed me a major boon. That made me feel a bit better, though I’m still infuriated. 

Part 4/Finale 4:12 AM
Made it back to my haven. It was a long night, but after weeks of work, it's done. My sire knows all the work I did and is proud of me, even if I have to stay behind the scenes. Part of me wishes I had stood up for myself in front of the Prince; shown proof that I sourced the blood, not the Keeper, but that wouldn't have been wise. Part of me wonders what it would be like to not be a neonate, to have respect and elevated status in the court. Things move slowly here; the city only has 25 kindred (excluding thinbloods, I'm unsure of their numbers). You'd think it would be easy to rise, but with so few of us, it's hard. I'll bide my time for now, but if anyone has advice, I'd welcome it. All in all, tonight was fun, and a boon is a boon. I wish all my readers a happy Solstice and wish you all well. Good morning! 

~Quinn, the Gourmet Tremere

I'm an introvert who loves talking when it is with the right people, and I promise I'll try and be a good conversationalist. I encourage you to come and say hi if you're equally bored, can't sleep, or think we might have something in common!

A bit about me:
- I'm a uni student in my final year of studying maths and data science
- A long standing hobby of mine is tap dancing. It's just so satisfying and I love learning new routines and challenging myself.
- I love going to concerts - some of my recent ones have been Radiohead, Bastille, Seb Lowe, and The  Wombats.
- I'm a fan of a speciality flat white in a cute coffee shop, maybe a good book to read as well.
- I'm a countryside dweller and think there's nothing better than a long muddy stomp through the woods.",3,1766361197.0,MakeFriendsUK,0,1.0,False
1psktxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/trauma/comments/1psktxr/catecholomethyltransferase_comt/,Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT),"Stress changes you, and it can change your DNA! If you are battling stress and anxiety, you should understand the COMT enzyme and the gene that encodes for it. Knowledge is power and it is the one thing we can use to change our lives and ourselves. **Catechol-O-Methyltransferase** or **COMT** for short, is an enzyme that cleans up (i.e. metabolizes) catecholamines (feeling chemicals) like dopamine, adrenaline and others from your body, but under chronic stress or trauma, cortisol can regulate this gene. More specifically, through promoter hypermethylation, expression of this gene can be switched off. So even if you were born calm, with a “calm brain,” chronic stress or trauma can chemically reprogram you through epigenetic changes.

While we normally think of something like dopamine as a feelgood chemical, that isn’t always the case. Dopamine is a paradox and it’s actually an excitatory chemical that stimulates the brain but also makes it feel good. Think about dopamine like coffee. One cup makes us productive and happy, but ten cups makes us shaky, paranoid, and unable to sleep. With just the right amount, we feel focused and alert, but with too much (uncleared by COMT) our thoughts race and are turned up too loud! Our motivation turns to restlessness. Our focus turns to obsession. In extreme examples, our alertness can become paranoia or sensory overload and our brain can’t change the channel. We obsess over that one awkward thing we said this week at work.

There is a solution! That is the point of this post!

**Remember, skills before pills**. Change is work but we only need **motivation, time and knowledge** to make it happen. To reverse these epigenetic changes, or to simply deal with our anxiety if it is something we were born with, there are simple common-sense things we can do. We can start by reducing the cortisol in our bloodstream by lowering our stress levels. Meditation, yoga, deep breathing, or vagus nerve exercises. I spent one year sitting quietly each morning and meditating for 5-10 minutes before starting my day. I learned to meditate by reading and attending group meditation sessions before doing this. Everyone meditates differently, so don’t be afraid to google it and get started. There is no right or wrong way to meditate. Find a technique and get started.

Second, improving your diet (eating healthy foods!) and the amount and quality of sleep you get can significantly lower your stress levels.

Lastly, everyone’s biochemistry is different, but simple over the counter supplements like magnesium can help make your existing COMT enzymes more effective. The COMT enzyme binds magnesium to maintain the shape that allows it to clean up dopamine and adrenaline. You may need Magnesium to fuel the COMT enzyme you have left. There are other supplements… vitamin B12, B6, apigenin (found in chamomile) and folate. On this last topic of supplements, I encourage talking to your physician who may recommend simple genetic testing to understand your symptoms and the phenotype expression of your genes. Everyone’s biochemistry is different so understanding yours is essential to finding a tailored solution to your biochemistry. It sounds complicated but it’s become common place with some doctors these days. Your doctor may also help you figure out if you have slow or fast COMT and that is another topic entirely.

There was this old guy sitting at a different table. I asked him for a cigarette, he smiles, hands me one. We start talking and he’s like “ you can work for me, you can stay on my boat 2 hours away docked. I started thinking “what’s his angle”. (Side-note) I used to professionaly model, so I’m “pretty” and my warning signals started goin off like crazy but I thought “ugh what if he’s not lying… I’m pretty desperate…”

So I asked my friend Chad, brutally honest guy. I said “I don’t think I can trust him but if he’s not lying it would be amazing!” and Chad said “well bud, it’s either going to be the best thing that’s ever happened to you; or, you’ll wake up on a boat with an old man’s dick in your face” And I was like OKAYYY I GET IT.

Our focus turns to obsession. In extreme examples, our alertness can become paranoia or sensory overload and our brain can’t change the channel. We obsess over that one awkward thing we said this week at work.

There is a solution! That is the point of this post!

**Remember, skills before pills**. Change is work but we only need **motivation, time and knowledge** to make it happen. To reverse these epigenetic changes, or to simply deal with our anxiety if it is something we were born with, there are simple common-sense things we can do. We can start by reducing the cortisol in our bloodstream by lowering our stress levels. Meditation, yoga, deep breathing, or vagus nerve exercises. I spent one year sitting quietly each morning and meditating for 5-10 minutes before starting my day. I learned to meditate by reading and attending group meditation sessions before doing this. Everyone meditates differently, so don’t be afraid to google it and get started. There is no right or wrong way to meditate. Find a technique and get started.

Second, improving your diet (eating healthy foods!) and the amount and quality of sleep you get can significantly lower your stress levels.

Lastly, everyone’s biochemistry is different, but simple over the counter supplements like magnesium can help make your existing COMT enzymes more effective. The COMT enzyme binds magnesium to maintain the shape that allows it to clean up dopamine and adrenaline. You may need Magnesium to fuel the COMT enzyme you have left. There are other supplements… vitamin B12, B6, apigenin (found in chamomile) and folate. On this last topic of supplements, I encourage talking to your physician who may recommend simple genetic testing to understand your symptoms and the phenotype expression of your genes. Everyone’s biochemistry is different so understanding yours is essential to finding a tailored solution to your biochemistry. It sounds complicated but it’s become common place with some doctors these days. Your doctor may also help you figure out if you have slow or fast COMT and that is another topic entirely.

1pskro8,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1pskro8/pantoprazole/,Pantoprazole,"Hello Everyone,

My first post was removed by the moderator, so I’m reposting with much more information as the first time was labeled as low effort post. Sorry for that, I thought if I go through my whole history nobody will read that big of a post. This is my first time posting here, so please bear with me.

About 3 months ago, I was diagnosed with gastritis and prescribed Pantoprazole 40 mg once daily before food.

For the first 2 months, it worked great. My acid reflux completely disappeared and I felt really good. Then one day at work, I started experiencing what I would describe as persistent heart flutters, nonstop. I initially blamed it on too much coffee.

The next morning, the flutters were still there and would not stop. They were happening every 10–20 seconds, about 5/10 in intensity. After about 5 days, I emailed my gastroenterologist. He advised not to stop cold turkey, so we began a 4-week taper.

During month 3, as I started tapering, I began experiencing insomnia. I would lie awake for hours, and just as I felt like I was about to drift off, I’d get an involuntary upper-body startle/jerk that would fully wake me up. This cycle repeated over and over. I had no prior sleep issues whatsoever. My wife would always joke that my head doesn't even hit the pillow yet and Im already out cold.  

At the time, I assumed my nervous system was in overdrive due to the constant palpitations. I completed my final taper dose on Veterans Day here in US (November 12).

After stopping Pantoprazole:

	•	The insomnia worsened

	•	The heart palpitations completely resolved about 2 weeks after my last dose. Its like i got swapped one side effect to another.

Now it has been 5 weeks since my last Pantoprazole dose, and I am still dealing with insomnia.

Some nights it’s easier to fall asleep than others, but every night I wake up around 2–3 AM and cannot fall back asleep. When I do sleep, it feels like I never actually slept — just lying there all night. My Garmin shows that I slept, but I genuinely feel like I didn’t. The sleep quality feels extremely poor, with little to no deep or REM sleep. Some nights, I still experience sudden upper body jerks awake. Like I am being startled and have this internal buzzing/shaky feeling. 

Supplements I’ve tried (hit or miss):

	•	Melatonin 1 mg – 2/10 effectiveness

	•	Benadryl 12.5 mg – 3/10 effectiveness

	•	Unisom 25 mg (split to \~12.5 mg) – 4/10 effectiveness

•    Magnesium glycinate 350mg. Been taking it since the beginning of taper as I thought palpitations might be due to depleted magnesium. 

I should also mention that I’ve been on Effexor 150 mg for 10 years for vestibular issues.

Blood work (all normal):

	•	Thyroid

	•	Electrolytes

	•	Metabolic panel

	•	Iron panel

	•	CBC

	•	Magnesium (RBC)

	•	B12 / MMA

Has anyone experienced something similar and been able to identify the root cause?

What additional blood work should I request from my primary care doctor?

I strongly feel we’re missing some kind of nutrient deficiency, but getting answers from my primary feels like pulling teeth — he mostly just shrugs.

I have two young kids, and I honestly feel like I’m at the end of my rope. I can’t function without proper sleep.

Someone on another social media platform mentioned that amino acids like glutamine and tyrosine can drop out of range due to PPI use, potentially contributing to insomnia through GABA interactions.

If anyone has any insight or words of wisdom, I’d really appreciate it. I’m also open to DMs.

I’m just feeling like I’m in a very dark place right now. :/

1pskr4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpigeneticsOfTrauma/comments/1pskr4n/catecholomethyltransferase_comt/,Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT),"Stress changes you, and it can change your DNA! If you are battling stress and anxiety, you should understand the COMT enzyme and the gene that encodes for it. Knowledge is power and it is the one thing we can use to change our lives and ourselves. **Catechol-O-Methyltransferase** or **COMT** for short, is an enzyme that cleans up (i.e. metabolizes) catecholamines (feeling chemicals) like dopamine, adrenaline and others from your body, but under chronic stress or trauma, cortisol can regulate this gene. More specifically, through promoter hypermethylation, expression of this gene can be switched off. So even if you were born calm, with a “calm brain,” chronic stress or trauma can chemically reprogram you through epigenetic changes.

While we normally think of something like dopamine as a feelgood chemical, that isn’t always the case. Dopamine is a paradox and it’s actually an excitatory chemical that stimulates the brain but also makes it feel good. Think about dopamine like coffee. One cup makes us productive and happy, but ten cups makes us shaky, paranoid, and unable to sleep. With just the right amount, we feel focused and alert, but with too much (uncleared by COMT) our thoughts race and are turned up too loud! Our motivation turns to restlessness. Our focus turns to obsession. In extreme examples, our alertness can become paranoia or sensory overload and our brain can’t change the channel. We obsess over that one awkward thing we said this week at work.

There is a solution! That is the point of this post!

**Remember, skills before pills**. Change is work but we only need **motivation, time and knowledge** to make it happen. To reverse these epigenetic changes, or to simply deal with our anxiety if it is something we were born with, there are simple common-sense things we can do. We can start by reducing the cortisol in our bloodstream by lowering our stress levels. Meditation, yoga, deep breathing, or vagus nerve exercises. I spent one year sitting quietly each morning and meditating for 5-10 minutes before starting my day. I learned to meditate by reading and attending group meditation sessions before doing this. Everyone meditates differently, so don’t be afraid to google it and get started. There is no right or wrong way to meditate. Find a technique and get started.

Second, improving your diet (eating healthy foods!) and the amount and quality of sleep you get can significantly lower your stress levels.

Lastly, everyone’s biochemistry is different, but simple over the counter supplements like magnesium can help make your existing COMT enzymes more effective. The COMT enzyme binds magnesium to maintain the shape that allows it to clean up dopamine and adrenaline. You may need Magnesium to fuel the COMT enzyme you have left. There are other supplements… vitamin B12, B6, apigenin (found in chamomile) and folate. On this last topic of supplements, I encourage talking to your physician who may recommend simple genetic testing to understand your symptoms and the phenotype expression of your genes. Everyone’s biochemistry is different so understanding yours is essential to finding a tailored solution to your biochemistry. It sounds complicated but it’s become common place with some doctors these days. Your doctor may also help you figure out if you have slow or fast COMT and that is another topic entirely.

When there was planned AC maintenance on other occasions we were invited to hang out in the media lounge… that doesn’t fit a buildings worth of people and their pets and accommodate any of us working from home who have presentations or meetings and have to talk.

So I was at the youth section of our christian church and there was girl prolly like 3-4 school grades younger than me who was somewhat very kind to me... (There's this ball game most of us do during free time, I won't explain the rules, but you can line up for your turn to play, and she gave me her spot in line, she also kind of ""guided me through"" the game. For context, this was the first time I actually joined the other kids in the ball game (there's a lot of them) and I'm like the oldest person there because adult church is pretty boring. (note: most kids in there appear to be either middle schoolers or early highschoolers like freshman. Some kids closer to my age go there sometimes, but I don't see them there too often and this is my second time in a long time being in youth church because I have been taking the boring adult church because one day I mentally thought I was too old for the youth church and just decided to stay in the adult church and finish my coffee while I stretch in my seat ( not in a rude way) and wait for the sermon to end.

I'm autistic and not a social person at all ( I used to get bullied in school before escaping to homeschooling which was an option my parents gave me) so that adds up to my antisocialness.

Now you're probably wondering, what did I do? I simply asked her for a ""High five?"" as she was about to leave the room and we high fived. Note: I AM NOT ATTRACTED TO HER, I'm only into girls nearer to my age since I'm 16😭

after it happened, I felt like it shouldnt've. maybe I should've just fist bumped because I never expected a high five would feel weird just bc it's with a girl but it did. (Important note: what I mean by a ""weird"" feeling is that I feel like it shouldnt've happened. Not any other interperatation of ""weird"".)

But the good thing is that it was normal after, we stayed at the church because my mom was helping, and she (the girl) happened to still be there, she didn't give me any sus looks thank god, I was carrying my moms baby at one point because we had to take care of him while our mom was helping (by ""our"" I mean my family, duh) so me and that girls only interactions were her asking about the baby's name and her kind of interacting with my 6 months old (I think) baby sibling for like 4 seconds, that I was carrying, and waving bye at each other when we were at a distance. (She was playing with my siblings earlier bc it was boring otherwise not doing anything when our parents were setting things up for the church so she was saying bye to my siblings as well but I waited for us to be at a distance to wave at her in an attempt to \*sigh\* make things less weird but I made it like 2x weirder because I literally should've said bye when my siblings who were next to me were close enough to say bye loudly.

I hope she doesnt start approaching me in a ""romantic"" way.

I'm so ####### weird 💀💀

1pskpxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1pskpxa/catecholomethyltransferase_comt/,Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT),"Stress changes you, and it can change your DNA! If you are battling stress and anxiety, you should understand the COMT enzyme and the gene that encodes for it. Knowledge is power and it is the one thing we can use to change our lives and ourselves. **Catechol-O-Methyltransferase** or **COMT** for short, is an enzyme that cleans up (i.e. metabolizes) catecholamines (feeling chemicals) like dopamine, adrenaline and others from your body, but under chronic stress or trauma, cortisol can regulate this gene. More specifically, through promoter hypermethylation, expression of this gene can be switched off. So even if you were born calm, with a “calm brain,” chronic stress or trauma can chemically reprogram you through epigenetic changes.

While we normally think of something like dopamine as a feelgood chemical, that isn’t always the case. Dopamine is a paradox and it’s actually an excitatory chemical that stimulates the brain but also makes it feel good. Think about dopamine like coffee. One cup makes us productive and happy, but ten cups makes us shaky, paranoid, and unable to sleep. With just the right amount, we feel focused and alert, but with too much (uncleared by COMT) our thoughts race and are turned up too loud! Our motivation turns to restlessness. Our focus turns to obsession. In extreme examples, our alertness can become paranoia or sensory overload and our brain can’t change the channel. We obsess over that one awkward thing we said this week at work.

There is a solution! That is the point of this post!

**Remember, skills before pills**. Change is work but we only need **motivation, time and knowledge** to make it happen. To reverse these epigenetic changes, or to simply deal with our anxiety if it is something we were born with, there are simple common-sense things we can do. We can start by reducing the cortisol in our bloodstream by lowering our stress levels. Meditation, yoga, deep breathing, or vagus nerve exercises. I spent one year sitting quietly each morning and meditating for 5-10 minutes before starting my day. I learned to meditate by reading and attending group meditation sessions before doing this. Everyone meditates differently, so don’t be afraid to google it and get started. There is no right or wrong way to meditate. Find a technique and get started.

Second, improving your diet (eating healthy foods!) and the amount and quality of sleep you get can significantly lower your stress levels.

Lastly, everyone’s biochemistry is different, but simple over the counter supplements like magnesium can help make your existing COMT enzymes more effective. The COMT enzyme binds magnesium to maintain the shape that allows it to clean up dopamine and adrenaline. You may need Magnesium to fuel the COMT enzyme you have left. There are other supplements… vitamin B12, B6, apigenin (found in chamomile) and folate. On this last topic of supplements, I encourage talking to your physician who may recommend simple genetic testing to understand your symptoms and the phenotype expression of your genes. Everyone’s biochemistry is different so understanding yours is essential to finding a tailored solution to your biochemistry. It sounds complicated but it’s become common place with some doctors these days. Your doctor may also help you figure out if you have slow or fast COMT and that is another topic entirely.

I have the H2C, but it came with either a bad belt or motors, see picture on how dirty and beat up my motors were. That being said, support sent me belts and motors to replace.

Now, i replaced my hole xy in my old P1S, and it was quite a job. Spent lots of hours. So i was expecting that this will be a full day, for which i prepared, physically and mentally.

Got my coffee, laptop, workbench, let's go. I've approached it like a big LEGO, which i love. All i have to say is that i'm impressed with the way they changed certain things to make these machines much much much easier to repair/maintain. I know lots of people compare them to prusa and others, but it seems they are listening to the community and making improvements and progress. Sure, the software might be locked, but that's a different story and not on topic this time.

For once, the build quality is def better than the p1, period. Inside and out, this printer def looks more premium. I only had to remove the back, vs all panels on my p1 (i did the belts alone there too), so that was a nice surprise. The way the belts connect to the tool head - easy to take out and replace. The motors, one was easy, the other you def need patience and the right tool, but in the end, it wasn't hard at all. Of course, i was curious about other things, and i checked what else can i replace later. Seems like almost everything, if not everything, can be replaced with patience.

Their docs: good, not perfect. Could they be improved? 100%. But i was able to follow them, and get everything needed without going anywhere except their website.

Hope they keep listening and improving. Things will break over time, and having parts readily available, good docs and ease of access to components to replace is a great thing.

As housing providers, landlords quite literally put a roof over everyone’s head. That’s not a luxury. That’s a fundamental human need. And when a service covers something that essential, maybe it deserves a little recognition… say, in the form of a tip this Christmas.

The average rent in Providence is around **$2,200**. For what many people consider one of the best small cities in the country, that’s honestly a bargain. Access to walkable neighborhoods, culture, jobs, universities, restaurants, and coastal New England living, for less than what people pay in far worse cities. When you zoom out, it’s a pretty good deal.

Landlords don’t just collect rent and disappear. Good landlords are on call **24/7**. They handle leaks, heat outages, broken appliances, electrical issues, inspections, taxes, insurance, permits, and emergency repairs so tenants don’t have to. They make sure the place is safe, clean, insured, and legally habitable, so you can call it *home*.

Now, not all landlords are created equal. Obviously, if your landlord is negligent, unresponsive, or awful, don’t tip them that much. No one is arguing that.

But if your landlord:

* Responds quickly
* Fixes things properly
* Communicates clearly
* Keeps the building safe and maintained
* Treats you like a human being

…then tipping between **20% and 30% of one month’s rent** seems reasonable, depending on how generous you feel. After all, landlords are in the service industry. We tip baristas for making coffee. We tip drivers for a 10-minute ride. Landlords do a *whole lot more* than either of those.

Landlords make your life easier. They are the backbone support system that allows modern urban life to function. Without landlords, there would be no housing. Without housing, society doesn’t politely adapt—it collapses. In that sense, landlords are the thin line between civilization and anarchy.

If that doesn’t earn a Christmas tip, I don’t know what does. A good landlord is providing a service. And good service is worth acknowledging.",0,1766360462.0,providence,17,0.21,False

Just looking for someone to pass the time with. Nothing weird, just chill conversation.

I’m pretty laid-back. We can play question games, talk about random stuff, talk nonsense, or just chat until one of us gets sleepy.

I like cooking (I make a really good pizza 🍕), traveling, metal/rock music, and occasionally dancing 🕺
I also have a small home gym that I actually use.

He wears his Ring religiously, but completely ignores the actual data. He sees the red ""Readiness"" scores or the drops in SpO2 and just swipes them away.

I realized my nagging wasn't working because I’m just ""the wife."" He thinks I'm being dramatic. I needed an objective third party.

I exported his raw data (you just screenshot the trend graphs) and uploaded it to this medical triage AI.

I explicitly asked it gave it his symptoms and info about what he was experiencing. 

It didn't hold back. It generated a clinical summary linking his specific oxygen drops to ""severe nocturnal hypoxia"" and flagged a ""statistically significant risk of hypertension and stroke within 5 years.""

I didn't say a word. I just printed that page and left it on his keyboard.

He read it, got quiet, and finally admitted he needed to see someone. He booked the sleep study this morning.

If you have a partner who thinks they are invincible, stop trying to convince them with ""feelings."" Hit them with a clinical analysis of their own data. It’s the only thing that finally broke through the ego.

Also, please be kind :-)

I have a question about how I interact with strangers: sometimes when I see someone visibly upset in public open, (99% of the time, it’s a woman), I feel drawn to them as a human and I go out of my way to comfort them.

For example, I went kayaking a few months ago and a lady was arguing with her (fiance apparently) in front of my car. All I heard her say to him through angry tears was “this is the last place I went with my Dad, please don’t ruin this for me!” She then went down a hill by a willow tree (her fiancé went back to the car after their argument), and before grabbing my kayak (which was in the opposite direction), I walked a towards her, lightly tapped her on the shoulder and asked if she was okay. She and I talked for twenty minutes and I learned that this is kayaking spot was the last place that she spent with her Dad and it was the one year anniversary of his death. I think she felt a little better after we talked. We of course thee some girl shade at her fiancé. And of course, I gave her a hug when I walked away.

Defensive clause, lol: I respect ppl’s space and I don’t do this often/everytime, but sometimes I feel called to approach someone as a human and just remind then that they are seen and that they matter.

For example:

I was on the metro one time and a girl had just gotten fired and was very distraught. ( I knew this bc she was talking on the phone to her friend saying “what am I gonna do??”). I minded my business and stayed in my lane but just as I was getting off the trained, I squeezed her arm and said “I’m sorry :(“. She was caught of guard and kinda just gave a weak smile.

Same thing today. A girl was having a frustrating conversation with her aging parent (whewph! I felt for her!) and she was so upset and frazzled. As I left the coffee shop, I soothingly rubbed her back twice, in a non creepy way.

If it helps, for context: I have 3 sisters and I’m a girls girl. Yes, I’m “empathetic” and “ compassionate”, but not everyone with these traits sometimes comforts random strangers.

Do you know anyone like this? Any thoughts on were this comes from?

Also! Please note I am emotionally intelligent :) and I never approach people that my soul/the vibe doesn’t direct me to, as I’m aware that my butting in could cause more harm for them (and potentially me!) I’m also a street smart, confident city girl…so I know what’s up.

1pskibv,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pskibv/does_anyone_actually_want_to_be_asked_to_hang_out/,Does anyone actually want to be asked to hang out?,"I wouldn't like to be asked on a date at work by a stranger, whether from a coworker or customer. The risk is too high. Since there's nowhere in my life that affords repeat proximity to strangers (staying at home, working, and walking or shopping), I think I'm going to have to ask random people if they want to connect... but I don't actually know what I'd want to do with people even if they did say yes. I've tried going for walks with people I didn't know and it was uncomfortable and not fun. I also tried meeting for coffee and again, not fun. I'm not into sports or hiking, and there's nothing much else where I'm from in the way of clubs or classes. 

I saw somebody today at a tire shop.. aka somewhere I'd never go again for another few years. I thought about leaving a note saying, ""hey, it's hard to meet people, if you ever want to chat, here's my Instagram."" and that's basically within my comfort zone. But I don't think I can do that with random strangers I see in passing; there's no social norm that allows people to enter each other's lives this way.

I also want to say that I really want **friends**, as well as a boyfriend. I'm in my early 30s and have none. I'm female and not very attractive, so I also don't like approaching men because I kind of know attention from me wouldn't really be wanted. But I'd still like to be friends with them even if they're not interested in me that way.  

I've been noticing that the prolonged isolation is having an effect on my cognition (let alone that it's obviously miserable to live like this) so I kind of don't care about the potential rejection, I just feel bad about dumping unwanted/uncomfortable interactions on people who may feel creeped out. 

How would you feel if somebody left a short note for you at your workplace like that? How would you feel if someone approached you at the park and tried to make small talk, then said something like ""it's been nice chatting with you, could I give you my Instagram in case you ever want to go for a walk?""

Unfortunately no floor plan provided, and I stupidly didn’t measure anything while I was there. I’ve got a video that shows more of the kitchen side of things but struggling to upload this.

Ideally I’d want a sofa, maybe 2 - if 2 won’t fit then maybe a sofa and some chairs? Standard stuff such as coffee table, tv, tv stand, small dining table & chairs etc.

Now - ideally I’d have a desk and desk chair somewhere within the space too, to make somewhat of a “office” corner or something - and I think this is what I’m struggling with. 

I feel like the positioning of the radiators and balcony windows/doors are what make this so difficult to try to furnish as a TV wouldn’t be able to be near the radiators, as well as a sofa would block the windows/balcony.

I’m thinking either:
- a desk on that side next to the kitchen, in front of the radiator (picture 1), and then the sofa in the middle, facing the other side (picture 2) with the tv and tv stand along that wall
- a desk on the other side of the living room completely (picture 2) near the door and first balcony window, with the sofa facing the other side next to the kitchen (picture 1), but this would mean the tv stand and tv would be along the radiator, blocking it & heating up the tv (or along the left of it, but would mean it’s not central, or in the corner, but would make the viewing angle weird

I've never felt at anything, but it seemed like something I could accomplish and I bought the yarn and crocheted yesterday from this pattern, and then washed it in hot water through the washing machine about six times today. I modified the pattern which is for a tea cozy, by just adding maybe 10 or 12 rounds of crochet before I did the decreases. It was humongous and would have fit my 2-year-old inside when I finished crocheting. I didn't measure it before felting it, but it's now down to 13.5 in tall. I'm debating doing a little more felting but I'm very happy with it!! Also I love this design where you can just pop it over the French press instead of having to mess around with wrapping it and velcroing it or some such. I would make one for myself except we don't use a French press LOL.

I figured that's life telling me it's time to get my act together. 

Packed my gear, dropped my tent. Tent on pack. Off to the truck stop.

Inside. gear dropped at a table with an outlet. Phone plugged in and charging. Coffee. Coffee secured, I head outside for a smoke and to cool off. I'm sweating.

My body has gone into winter heat mode. 'Oh, it's slightly cold and we're moving? Time to produce more heat than we need.' 

Everyone at the truck stop was really nice. Everybody loves a traveler.

A homeless guy comes over, asks me for a cigarette. ""Yeah man here you go."" ""Can you get me a soda? I have money. I'm tresspassed from here."" ""Yeah man. Let me finish this smoke."" Smoke finished, he hands me $1.75 in quarters. Says he wants a fountain pepsi. When I get inside I see a small is $2.09. 'No big deal. I can pitch in a little to get dude a drink.'

Up to the counter. Cashier, ""That's it?"" ""Yep."" ""You're good."" ""Awesome! Thank you."" 

Back outside. Give dude his pepsi and his change back. ""They gave it to me for free."" ""You got another cigarette?"" ""Yeah man, here you go."" ""You got any meth?"" ""Nah bro. I don't fuck around with that."" ""Ok, cool. Thanks for getting me the drink. Have a blessed day."" ""You too bro! Good luck out there."" He heads off.

Back inside. I'd woken up to a 'what do you need' message from someone nearby. I couldn't think of anything gear-wise, so food it is. A few rounds back and forth got that sorted out. E-gift card secured and in the pilot app.

Phone is charged. Breakfast and coffee secured. Gear up. Out to the ramp.

About an hour and a half later a car pulls over. Nineteen year old guy named Sam. He asked a few questions about hitchhiking. He told me he's thinking about starting a business taking people out on guided tours for bird wacthing. Asked me if I wanted to be his business partner. ""I'm interested. That sounds pretty awesome."" It's still an idea at this stage, but I gave him my info and some life and business advice.

He took me about fifty miles down the road to near Greer, SC. Took me to a Mexican restaurant and bought me dinner. The one thing I love more than pizza is Mexican food. (We won't get into the difference between Mexican food in California and Mexican food on the east coast.) It was meaty cheesy goodness.

We had good conversation while we ate. He's been to Nicaragua, Canada, quite a bit of the US. Cool guy. Good head on his shoulders.

He runs me back down to the 85. It's a little before 5:00. No more hitchhiking today. Sitting in a gas station topping off my phone and checking maps for a spot to camp before I head into the trees for the night.

1psk968,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1psk968/my_mom_is_christian_but_is_against_me_marrying_my/,My mom is Christian but is against me marrying my boyfriend,"I (25F) and my boyfriend (24M) have known each other since we were 11. We were friends for a while but didn’t start dating until around 3 years ago. We are both Christians and quite active in church. When we started our relationship we both made sure to pray separately as I told him I wanted my first proper relationship to be my last. 

Over the weekend one of our friends got engaged and I know that we (my bf and I) are on a similar path. I told my mom about my friends engagement and she was really happy for them but then said not my daughter I want you to qualify (context I’m in my final year before I qualify as a solicitor) and be successful. I asked her what she meant and she said she doesn’t want me to get engaged until later on and if I get engaged soon or married she will be my worst enemy.  I did try to explain an engagement doesn’t mean marriage the following week the engagement could last like 12/18 months but she wasn’t having any of it. 

I asked her about my older brother (38M) who is currently abroad on holiday with his girlfriend (36F) who’s still in uni and they’ve only been together for 8 months. My mom said they’re old so she doesn’t care what they do but I am not allowed to do what I want. For context there’s always been a double standard with my brother and I. My mom says it’s cause I’m more mature and more responsible than him so expects better but my brother is allowed more freedom and leeway. 

My bf and I have enough savings and have even been saving up for a wedding. We both have good jobs, a plan for the future and have prayed over it and even had friends/ mentors pray for us. 

I don’t want to upset my mom as I’m still living with her (it’s expensive to live alone lol) and I don’t want her to be my enemy. I know we don’t wrestle with flesh and blood but I’ve been praying for a break through with my family since the start of the relationship. 

They don’t like my bf even though he always helps out around the house, takes my family out for meals and honestly is such a lovely caring guy. They first said it’s because he’s white (context I’m Filipino), then it was because he doesn’t have a house and car (cause he’s saving up for a house and wedding) and now it’s because they want me to be successful first. 

I don’t know what to do and I’m obviously going to say yes to my bf when he ask but I don’t want my family to miss out on this big milestone in our lives. I’ve always been an obedient daughter, always helping the family (sending money to the Philippines, to my mom and helping out when I can) I made sure to study hard and work hard to get where I am at. I volunteer in church, I volunteer in food kitchen and have a homeless ministry. But it seems that nothing that I do is good enough for them. 

If I even breath the wrong way I get penalised for it and get told about how much of a bad daughter I am and it feels like I can never do anything right with my mom/ brother. 

They’re very controlling over my life and get upset and call me indecent if I come home after 10pm even if it’s a church event. I’m not allowed to drink coffee as they don’t want me to get addicted to it and I’m not allowed to do a lot of things. I’m just tired of them controlling me but I don’t want them to hate me. I’m not sure what to do. I know my boyfriend is proposing next year and I’m scared on how they’re going to react when he talks to them. Does anyone have any tips?

1psk8c6,https://www.reddit.com/r/FurnitureForum/comments/1psk8c6/walker_edison_furniture_scam_company_avoid_if_you/,Walker Edison Furniture - Scam Company (avoid if you value your time or money),"Extremely bad experience with Walker Edison – I wanted to share my experience in case it helps other designers or homeowners avoid the headache I just went through. I was working on small interior design for my house and decided to order furniture from Walker Edison because the prices looked reasonable and I didn’t initially see any major red flags online. That turned out to be a huge mistake.

I placed multiple orders for coffee tables. Their website states that orders ship within 1–2 business days and that tracking information is provided shortly after. That never happened.  
 Weeks went by and my orders were still stuck on “preparing” with no tracking, no updates, nothing. I reached out to customer support multiple times asking for a status update. No response. After continued silence, I requested to cancel the orders. The only thing I received was an automated response saying they could not cancel because more than one hour had passed since the order was placed, even though the items hadn’t shipped, hadn’t received tracking, and hadn’t moved at all.

To make matters worse, my card was charged immediately, but I couldn’t get a single human response despite giving them *weeks* and plenty of benefit of the doubt. At that point, I warned them (twice) that I would have no choice but to initiate a credit card chargeback if I didn’t hear back. Still no response. So I opened chargebacks through my bank.

Only *after* the bank confirmed they had initiated an investigation did Walker Edison suddenly email me, saying they could no longer help because a chargeback was in progress and that everything now had to be handled through my financial institution.

After weeks of silence, *that* was the response I got. The lack of communication, refusal to cancel unshipped orders, and complete absence of real customer support is honestly shocking, especially for a company selling furniture at this scale.

I strongly advise against purchasing from Walker Edison, especially if you’re on a timeline or working on a client project. If something goes wrong, you may be left with automated emails, no tracking, and no accountability. Just sharing so others don’t end up in the same situation.

I think I may have misread friendliness as interest,"TL;DR: A coworker from a different department was friendly and easy to talk to. Since we rarely interact at work, I asked her out for coffee and she declined. After that, her behavior changed, and I’m wondering if I misunderstood normal friendliness as romantic interest.

I’m looking for some perspective because I think I might be overthinking a situation with a coworker. My coworker (~25F) and I (31M) work in an office in different departments and we almost never interact. For a long time, our interactions were very minimal, just polite smiles when passing each other. First time we had a conversation was initiated by her out of the blue when she asked me if I was attending a work event the following day. We had small conversations after that where we both remembered little details about each other that we casually mentioned and she generally seemed friendly and comfortable talking to me. I'm not the type of person who would pursue a coworker romantically, but these little interaction seemed too good to just ignore.

Eventually, after weeks of small talk, I asked her very casually if she wanted to grab coffee, this was on a Friday at the end of the day after we discussed what our plans were that weekend. She declined and said she had a boyfriend. I apologized right away for asking and kept things professional going forward. We continued to have brief conversations and things remained very normal for quite some time. What’s confusing to me is that a month or two after asking her out, her behavior shifted in ways I didn’t expect.

Before asking her out, she would smile back when we passed each other, occasionally initiate small conversations, she seemed relaxed and friendly in one-on-one interactions, she remembered small details, and we had conversations where we stood near large groups of people.

After asking her out, I noticed a change in her behaviour around me. When there are people around, she tries to avoid conversations, but she will still have conversations with me if nobody is around. When we talk, sometimes I could barely hear her because she talks quietly. If we're in a group and a person is talking, I notice her looking at me instead of the person talking, but she will look away as soon as I notice her looking. She also mentioned me positively to another coworker in a work related context. Then there are subtle signs like a head tilt when smiling as we pass by each other.

I understand that she might be trying to create a boundary in case I misread our interactions, and I respect her for that because the last thing I want is to make things more awkward between us. I’m not upset about the rejection and I’m not trying to pursue anything further. I mainly want to understand whether this is just a normal reaction after turning someone down at work, if I likely read too much into her friendliness, or if it’s common for people to become more cautious once they know someone is interested.

I’d appreciate any insight, especially from people who’ve been in similar workplace situations.",0,1766359215.0,bodylanguage,3,0.5,False

I’m moving to Princeton in about a month for work and wanted to get a realistic sense of what life is like there. I’m coming from Alpharetta, Georgia, so pretty different pace and layout.

A few things I’m curious about:

* **Work–life vibe:** What’s the general rhythm like around Princeton? Does it feel more like a quiet college town, or more commuter/corporate?
* **City feel:** How lively is Princeton day-to-day? Are there walkable areas, coffee shops, things to do after work, or does it get sleepy fast?
* **Car vs no car:** Do I actually *need* a car? I’ve heard mixed things. I’ll be working in West Windsor Area but would like to get around cheaply if possible.
* **Cost of living hacks:** Any tips for saving money on rent, groceries, commuting, etc.? Trying to be smart about expenses.
* **Things you wish you knew before moving:** Anything that surprised you, good or bad, especially if you moved from the South.

I’m early 20s, moving solo, and trying to balance saving money with still having some quality of life. Would appreciate any advice, neighborhoods to consider (or avoid), or general heads-ups.

A dying engineer, a stubborn protocol, and the day “trust me” got replaced by proof.","My coffee tasted like burnt rubber and government procurement contracts. It was 7:42 AM on a Tuesday, and I, the Deputy Director of the Division of Enforcement at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, was staring at my inbox with the enthusiasm of a man about to perform a root canal on himself.

The subject lines were the usual cavalcade of horrors. *“URGENT: Crypto-Exchange Gamma lost the private keys (again),”* *“Whistleblower claims CEO is actually three toddlers in a trench coat,”* and *“FW: FW: RE: Compliance check on Subsection 4(a)(2).”*

And then, there was this one.

**From:** *Lev Goukassian*

**Subject:** *The Evidentiary Substrate You Never Knew You Needed: Ternary Logic.* 

It didn't have the frantic all-caps of a lunatic, nor the slippery corporate-speak of a defense attorney. It was just… there. I sighed, the kind of sigh that rattles the ribs, and clicked it.

*“Dear Commission,”* it began. *“The current disclosure regime is a 20th-century house of cards built on the hope that people won’t lie. I have built a substrate that removes hope from the equation. It is called Ternary Logic.”*

I snorted. ""Ternary Logic."" Sounds like a bad sci-fi band. I was about to delete it—honestly, my finger was hovering over the trash icon like a drone pilot—when I saw the attachment. *TL and SEC: An Evidentiary Partnership.*

""Evidentiary Partnership,"" I muttered to my empty office. ""That’s bold. Usually, it’s ‘Adversarial Nightmare.’""

Against my better judgment, I opened the document. And then, because I am a creature of habit and procrastination, I opened a new tab and Googled ""Lev Goukassian.""

The first hit was a LinkedIn profile. *Lev Goukassian. Stage 4\. Terminal.*

I froze. The coffee cup stopped halfway to my mouth. I clicked through. There were photos—a guy with kind, intense eyes, looking thinner in the recent ones. And there was a timeline.

He had built this thing—this entire ""Ternary Logic"" framework—in *two months*.

""Two months?"" I whispered. ""It takes us two months to schedule a meeting to decide the agenda for the next meeting.""

I kept scrolling, the bureaucratic cynicism peeling away layer by layer. There was a section on the ""Bus Factor""—that grim engineering metric of how many team members can get hit by a bus before the project dies. Lev had notarized, timestamped, and anchored a ""Succession Declaration."" He had effectively automated his own legacy. Even if he vanished tomorrow, the code, the logic, the framework—it would stand. It was bulletproof.

And there was a sister. Silva. She was living abroad, seemingly moving mountains in the background, handling the logistics, the care, the life-stuff so Lev could code. There was a picture of a dog, too. A Miniature Schnauzer named Vinci, looking at the camera with the same intense skepticism I usually reserve for hedge fund managers.

Then I saw it. The ""Goukassian Vow.""

*Pause when truth is uncertain. Refuse when harm is clear. Proceed where truth is.*

It wasn’t a corporate slogan. It sounded like... a paladin’s oath.

I looked back at the whitepaper on my other screen. The ""Epistemic Hold."" The ""Immutable Ledger.""

""Okay, Lev,"" I said to the screen. ""You have my attention. Don't make me regret this.""

Three hours later, I was having what I can only describe as a bureaucratic meltdown.

I had printed the whitepaper. It was covered in red ink, not because I was correcting it, but because I was aggressively circling things and writing ""HOLY S\*\*\*"" in the margins.

""Johnson\!"" I yelled.

Johnson, my newest hire, poked his head in. He looked like he was twelve and still afraid of the dark. ""Sir?""

""Read this paragraph,"" I commanded, thrusting the paper at him. ""Section 1.2.1.""

Johnson squinted. ""Vulnerability 1: Unverifiable Self-Reported Corporate Data... The foundation of the entire regime is information attested to by management... reactive, not preventative..."" He looked up. ""Well, yeah. That’s the job, isn’t it? We wait for them to lie, then we sue them three years later.""

""Exactly\!"" I slammed my hand on the desk. ""We are forensic archaeologists, Johnson\! We dig up bones and try to prove the dinosaur was murdered\! But this—"" I tapped the paper violently. ""This guy wants to put a heart monitor on the dinosaur *while it's alive*.""

I stood up and started pacing. My office is small, so it was mostly just me spinning in circles.

""Look at the 'Epistemic Hold,' Johnson. Do you know what HFT is?""

""High Frequency Trading, sir. The... fast money stuff.""

""Fast money. Black boxes. Algorithms executing trades in microseconds. We can't see inside them. We just see the wreckage after the crash. But this..."" I grabbed the paper back. ""This 'Epistemic Hold' is a mandatory pause. If the data is weird? *Pause.* If the risk models conflict? *Pause.* It’s a programmable conscience, Johnson\! It’s a circuit breaker for greed\!""

Johnson looked mildly terrified. ""Is that... legal?""

""It should be mandatory\!"" I laughed, a slightly manic sound. ""And look at this\! Greenwashing\! You know that case with the 'Green-certified' bonds that turned out to be funding a coal-powered tire fire?""

""The Henderson case?""

""The Henderson case\! We spent eighteen months proving their compliance officer didn't know a carbon credit from a hole in the ozone layer. Look at Lev’s solution. 'Sustainable Capital Allocation Mandate.' The system *checks the proof* before the claim is filed. If the proof isn't anchored on the blockchain, the filing *bounces*. It literally refuses to let them lie\!""

I slumped back into my chair, staring at the ceiling. ""He fixed it. A dying man in a room with a Schnauzer fixed the evidentiary gap I’ve been complaining about since the Clinton administration.""

""So... what do we do?"" Johnson asked.

I looked at the document. *Ternary Logic does not replace the Commission. It acts as a verification substrate.*

""We test it,"" I said. ""We get the sandbox team. We load up the simulation. And we see if this 'Epistemic Hold' can actually stop a train wreck.""

The ""Sandbox"" was a windowless room in the basement that smelled faintly of ozone and despair. It was where our tech guys, a frantic group of underpaid geniuses, tried to monitor a market that moved a million times faster than their computers.

""Okay,"" I said, addressing the room. ""We’re plugging in the Ternary Logic framework. Specifically, the Epistemic Hold and the Decision Log. We’re going to run the 'Flash Crash' simulation. 2010 market conditions. Maximum chaos.""

Cindy, the lead dev, looked skeptical. ""Sir, the Flash Crash sim usually melts our surveillance tools. We can reconstruct it, but we can't stop it. It’s historical data.""

""I know,"" I said. ""I want to see what TL *would* have done. Treat the historical data as live inputs. Let's see if the logic holds.""

Cindy shrugged and started typing. ""Initializing Goukassian Protocol. Setting thresholds. Anchoring dummy ledger... okay. We’re live. Injecting the spoofing orders now.""

On the big screen, the simulated market chart began to twitch. This was the moment in 2010 where the algorithms started feeding on each other, a doom-loop of selling that wiped out a trillion dollars in minutes.

""Spoofing detected,"" Cindy said monotonously. ""Sell orders stacking...""

Usually, this is where the red line plummets off the cliff.

But it didn’t.

The screen flashed yellow. A giant text box appeared over the chart:

**STATE 0: EPISTEMIC HOLD TRIGGERED.** **ANOMALY DETECTED: LIQUIDITY ILLUSION.** **VERIFICATION REQUIRED.**

The market froze. Not a halt—a micro-pause. The algorithms pushing the fake sell orders were suddenly hitting a wall. They tried to execute, and the TL framework simply... waited.

""What's happening?"" Johnson asked, eyes wide.

""It’s... it's hesitating,"" Cindy said, her voice rising. ""The logic layer isn't letting the trades clear. It’s demanding proof of liquidity intent. The algorithms can’t provide it because they’re spoofing. They’re lying.""

**STATE \-1: REFUSE.** **ACTION DENIED. MALICIOUS PATTERN ANCHORED.**

The red line didn't crash. It just wobbled and straightened out.

""It stopped the Flash Crash,"" I whispered. ""It just... asked for ID, and when the algo couldn't produce it, it kicked it out of the bar.""

""Sir,"" Cindy said, ""There's a problem.""

""What?""

""I left the TL protocol running on the *entire* sandbox environment. Including our internal administrative simulation.""

""And?""

""And... well, it’s currently flagging your lunch order.""

I blinked. ""My what?""

""You ordered the 'Healthy Choice' salad from the cafeteria system,"" Cindy said, suppressing a grin. ""The Sustainable Capital Allocation Mandate just kicked in. It scanned the cafeteria's supply chain data.""

**STATE \-1: REFUSE.** **CLAIM ""FRESH LOCAL GREENS"" UNVERIFIABLE.** **SUPPLY CHAIN ANCHOR: FROZEN / ORIGIN UNKNOWN.** **SUGGESTED ACTION: PIZZA.**

""It verified my salad?"" I shouted. ""And denied it?""

""It’s protecting you from harm, sir,"" Johnson offered helpfully. ""Refuse when harm is clear.""

""It's chaotic\!"" I threw my hands up. ""It’s brilliant, but it’s chaotic\! If we implement this, half of Wall Street stops working on day one\!""

""But the *bad* half,"" Cindy pointed out.

She was right. And that was the terrifying beauty of it.

We spent the next six hours feeding it everything we had. We fed it the Enron financials. TL flagged the off-balance-sheet partnerships instantly—**STATE 0: UNCERTAINTY. ASSET OWNERSHIP OBFUSCATED.** We fed it the crypto-exchange collapse from last year. **STATE \-1: REFUSE. PROOF OF RESERVES NOT ANCHORED.**

It was relentless. It was rude. It was absolutely incorruptible.

At one point, Johnson tried to modify a Decision Log to make himself look better in a simulation. The system didn't just stop him; it created a *new* log entry recording his attempt to change the old log, anchored it to a public blockchain, and emailed me a notification.

**IMMUTABLE LEDGER UPDATE:** **USER: JOHNSON.** **ACTION: ATTEMPTED HISTORY REWRITE.** **RESULT: FAILED.** **STATUS: SHAME.**

Okay, it didn't say ""Status: Shame,"" but it was implied.

By 5:00 PM, the room was a mess of coffee cups and printouts. The simulation was stable. The market was boring. Fair. Orderly. Efficient.

I walked back to my office, my head spinning. I sat down and looked at the picture of Lev and Vinci again.

This man, dying in a room somewhere, had handed us the Holy Grail. He hadn't asked for money. He hadn't asked for a patent license. He had just said, *“Here. The truth matters. Use it.”*

I opened a new email draft. My hands were shaking slightly. Not from caffeine this time, but from a strange mix of humility and grief.

**To:** Lev Goukassian

**From:** \[Redacted\], Deputy Director, SEC Division of Enforcement

**Subject:** Re: A Structural Solution to Systemic Blindness

Dear Mr. Goukassian,

I confess, when I saw your email this morning, I expected another crank theory about how we should replace the dollar with seashells. I did not expect to find the missing instruction manual for 21st-century capitalism.

We ran Ternary Logic in our sandbox today. It stopped a simulated Flash Crash in 300 milliseconds. It also refused to let me order a salad because the supply chain data was dubious. I have never been more annoyed and more impressed at the same time.

I looked you up, Lev. I know about the diagnosis. I know about the timeline.

I sit in a building made of stone and rules, surrounded by people who have spent decades trying to patch the holes in the dam with chewing gum and legal briefs. We are tired. We are cynical. We are used to losing the footrace against technology.

And then you show up. You and your sister, and your dog, and this incredible, terrifying clarity of yours. You built in two months what we couldn't build in eighty years. You didn't just build a tool; you built a conscience and wrote it in code.

The ""Goukassian Vow""—*Pause when truth is uncertain*—is something I wish I could tattoo on the forehead of every CEO in Manhattan.

I know this is a ""gift to humanity."" I see the Succession Declarations. I see the lack of ego. It’s glaringly obvious that you aren’t doing this to get your name on a building. You’re doing it because you looked at the world, saw it was broken, and decided to leave a wrench on the workbench before you clocked out.

We are going to review this. Seriously. I’m setting up a task force tomorrow. It’s going to be a bureaucratic nightmare to integrate, and I’m going to hate every meeting, but we’re going to do it. Because it works. Because it’s right.

Thank you. For the clarity. For the tool. And mostly, for reminding a jaded bureaucrat that the truth is actually worth fighting for.

Give Vinci a pat for me.

Sincerely,

\[Narrator's Name\]

I hit send. I stared at the screen for a long time. The sun was setting, casting long shadows across D.C., a city built on power and secrets.

The reply came twenty minutes later.

**To:** \[Redacted\]

**From:** Lev Goukassian

**Subject:** Re: Re: A Structural Solution to Systemic Blindness

Dear \[Narrator's Name\],

Vinci accepts your regards. He is currently asleep on my feet, which acts as a very effective, though warm, anchor for my own reality.

I am glad the salad was rejected. Verify your greens, Director. The body is a system, too.

Thank you for your kind words. Please, do not mourn the timeline. The timeline is what gave me the focus. When you know the deadline is real, you stop negotiating with the unimportant. You realize that ""ego"" is just heavy luggage you don't need for the trip.

I built TL because I looked at our systems—our markets, our governance, our AI—and I saw they were missing a gear. They have ""Go"" and ""Stop,"" but they lack ""Hesitate."" They lack the capacity to say, ""I don't know yet."" And a system that cannot hesitate cannot think. It can only react.

I want to be clear: This isn't about me. The Succession Declaration is there because the logic is bigger than the logician. Silva knows this. She has been the iron in the concrete, holding the structure up while I poured the cement. Without her, this is just a fever dream in a hospital bed.

My motives are simple. I love this place. Earth. Humanity. We are messy and chaotic and beautiful, but we are building systems that are too fast for our wisdom. If we don't build a substrate of truth—a way to prove what is real before we act on it—we will break ourselves.

TL is a shield. It is a way to ensure that when our machines (and our executives) act, they do so with their eyes open.

The ""institutional chaos"" you fear is just the sound of the truth waking up. It’s noisy at first. It disrupts the comfort of the ambiguous. But once the dust settles, you find you are standing on solid ground for the first time.

Proceed where truth is. That is all I ask.

The work is yours now. I am just the guy who filed the first ticket.

With warmth and clarity,

Lev (and Vinci)

I read the email three times.

""The sound of the truth waking up,"" I repeated.

I looked out the window. The city lights were flickering on. Down there, in the data centers and the trading floors, the algorithms were humming, billions of dollars moving in the dark, unverified, unpaused, reckless.

But on my desk, in a stack of printed papers, there was a way to turn on the lights.

Johnson knocked on the door again. ""Sir? The legal team is asking about the 'Immutable Ledger.' They say it conflicts with their ability to 'massage the narrative' in press releases.""

I stood up. I straightened my tie. I felt a grin spreading across my face—a real one this time.

""Tell Legal to come see me, Johnson,"" I said, grabbing the Ternary Logic whitepaper like a weapon. ""And tell them to bring their lunch. We’re going to be here a while.""

""Yes, sir. Also, the cafeteria system is still down. It's demanding a soil sample analysis for the tomatoes.""

""Good,"" I said. ""I wasn't hungry anyway.""

I walked to the door, paused, and looked back at my computer.

""Pause when uncertain,"" I whispered to the empty room. ""Proceed where truth is.""

I turned off the light. The glow of the screen remained, the cursor blinking in the dark. A tiny, steady heartbeat of logic in a chaotic world.

We had work to do.

The next few weeks were a blur of what I can only describe as ""constructive catastrophe.""

We initiated Pilot Program Beta—code name ""Project Vinci"" (I couldn't help myself). We selected a mid-sized regional exchange that had been on our watchlist for ""creative accounting"" and told them they were volunteering for a new compliance technology.

Their CEO, a man whose tan looked like it was applied with a spray gun, laughed. ""Sure, sure. Send over your little software. We're an open book.""

Two days later, he was calling me, screaming so loud I had to hold the phone away from my ear.

""It won't let us trade\!"" he shrieked. ""The damn thing is locked\! State Zero\! State Negative One\! What is this?""

""It's the Epistemic Hold, Bob,"" I said calmly, sipping a verified organic tea. ""It means your data doesn't match your claims.""

""My data is fine\! It's—""

""Bob,"" I interrupted. ""The system detected that your 'cash on hand' is actually parked in an offshore entity that doesn't return a cryptographic anchor. No anchor, no liquidity. No liquidity, no trade. It’s not me, Bob. It’s the math.""

""Turn it off\!""

""I can't,"" I lied. ""It's immutable. Goukassian Principle. You're accountable to the knowledge the system possesses. And right now, the system knows you're broke.""

Bob hung up. Three days later, they restated their earnings. The stock dropped 15%, but for the first time in history, the drop wasn't a surprise. It was the truth, arriving on time.

The chaos spread. We plugged TL into our internal expense reporting. It flagged the Director of Finance for expensing a ""team building dinner"" that the geolocation anchor placed at a casino in Atlantic City.

**STATE \-1: REFUSE.** **MERCHANT CATEGORY: GAMBLING.** **USER INTENT: DUBIOUS.**

I had to intervene to stop the system from automatically emailing his wife. We needed to tweak the ""social harm"" settings on that one.

But amidst the panic, something else started happening. The younger staff—the ones who had joined the SEC to actually make a difference—started waking up. They saw the Decision Logs. They saw the undeniable proof of *intent*.

""Sir,"" Sarah, a junior analyst, came to me one morning. ""Look at this insider trading case. The Panuwat precedent.""

""Shadow trading?"" I asked.

""Yeah. Usually, we have to prove he knew about the merger. We have to subpoena emails, check phone records, hope he didn't use a burner."" She turned her laptop around. ""We ran the simulation with TL Anchors.""

There it was. Two hashes on the screen.

**ANCHOR 1 (10:01 AM): USER ACCESSED FILE ""MERGER\_ALPHA"".** **ANCHOR 2 (10:08 AM): USER EXECUTED BUY ORDER.**

""It's inescapable,"" she said, her eyes shining. ""He can't say he didn't know. The system logged the knowledge event before the trade event. It proves *scienter*.""

""It proves the mind,"" I corrected. ""It proves the state of mind.""

I thought of Lev. I wondered how he was doing. I wondered if he knew that in a drab government building, a twenty-five-year-old analyst was looking at a computer screen like it was the burning bush.

I wrote to him one more time, about a month later.

**To:** Lev Goukassian

**Subject:** The Noise is Subsiding

Lev,

You were right. The chaos is quieting down. Or rather, people are realizing that screaming at the truth doesn't make it go away.

We caught a Ponzi scheme yesterday. Not after it collapsed. *Before* it started. The system flagged the ""Guaranteed Returns"" mandate as mathematically impossible and refused to anchor the prospectus. The founder is currently trying to explain to a judge why his ""proprietary algorithm"" was just a spreadsheet of lies.

It feels different here. We aren't just janitors cleaning up the mess anymore. We're architects.

I hope you are finding rest. I hope the pain is manageable.

Silva sent me a note saying you were working on the ""Hybrid Shield"" documentation. Please, Lev. Take a day off. Watch a movie. Pet the dog. You've saved the world enough for one lifetime.

\-\[Narrator\]

His reply was short.

**From:** Lev Goukassian

**Subject:** :)

The dog is petted. The shield is necessary.

Rest is for the uncertain. I am very certain.

Keep going.

\-L

Six months later, Lev passed away.

The news hit the wires quietly. To the world, he was an obscure cryptographer and engineer. To us, he was Prometheus, only he didn't steal the fire—he built a lantern and left it on the porch.

I went to the funeral. It was small. Silva was there, looking like a statue made of grief and steel. Vinci was there, looking around for the one person who wasn't coming back.

I introduced myself to Silva. She took my hand. Her grip was firm.

""He liked your emails,"" she said. ""He printed them out. He said, 'See? The bureaucrats have souls. We just have to give them better tools.'""

I choked up. A grown man, a senior federal official, standing in a cemetery, trying not to cry in front of a Miniature Schnauzer.

""We're implementing the full framework next year,"" I told her. ""The Commission voted yesterday. Regulation TL is a go.""

She smiled, and it was Lev's smile. ""I know. The Succession Declaration triggered the handover protocols this morning. I received the keys. The Foundation is ready.""

""He thought of everything,"" I said.

""He had to,"" she replied. ""He didn't have time to make mistakes.""

I walked back to my car. I thought about the ""Bus Factor."" Lev had been hit by the ultimate bus—mortality. But the logic didn't flinch. The system didn't crash.

I pulled out my phone. I opened the SEC's internal app, now running on the Ternary Logic core.

**STATUS: OPERATIONAL.** **UNCERTAINTY: RESOLVED.** **TRUTH: ANCHORED.**

I started the engine. The radio was playing some pop song, oblivious to the fact that the underlying operating system of the economy had just been rewritten by a dying man's love for the world.

""Pause when uncertain,"" I said to the rearview mirror.

I checked my blind spot. I signaled. I merged into traffic.

""Proceed where truth is.""

And for the first time in a long time, I knew exactly where I was going.

The van was driving through the stuffy night toward the city’s outskirts.
Thabo was behind the wheel — silent and grim.
Sibusiso was crying, clutching a machete in his hands.
The corpse of Sifo, his brother, lay on the back seat.

“Was it worth it?” Sibusiso asked Thabo.
“We barely took anything — just some junk. No gold, no money.
And where would you even find them in such a huge house…”

“Right. After you killed the owner,” Thabo said.
“Shoved the machete into his gut all the way to the hilt.”

“He killed Sifo, goddamn it! My brother!!!
That fucking old white man shot him point-blank in the head with a rifle — as soon as we walked into the house,” Sibusiso shouted, spitting saliva.
“It was like he was waiting for us! Blew his damn head off!!!”

Sibusiso started to break down.

“So what do we do now?”

“Calm down,” Thabo said.
“There’s no evidence. We took the body, and on the video you can’t tell who’s who anyway — we were masked.”

He almost joked about Sifo — that no one would recognize him for sure — but held back.

Sibusiso went silent and began to calm down.
“We’ll bury your brother when we get there.
And tomorrow we’ll sell the loot to the fence,” Thabo said quietly, lost in his own thoughts.

What Sibusiso didn’t know was that Thabo had changed the plan — they had gotten too little from the heist, and the panicky Sibusiso no longer fit into it.

Staring at the road through the dusty windshield,
Thabo was mentally reviewing the layout of the house they had ransacked in a hurry.
But something slipped away from him, hid —
something cold and alien, beyond understanding.

“Did you notice anything weird? In that house?” Thabo asked.

“The weird thing was how he met us on the carpet like we were celebrities!
You were the last one to enter, Thabo!” Sibusiso hissed.

“But that’s not it,” Thabo said quietly.

“Then what is it? Explain to me.”
Sibusiso shifted his grip on the machete.

“Mirrors. In such a big, expensive house — and not a single mirror…
And your machete — there was no blood on it
when you pulled it out of the old man’s stomach.
No blood. You get it?”

Sibusiso froze. Then, horrified, he tossed the machete aside and covered his face with his hands.

A silence fell — so heavy and grim it was like something black and sticky had filled the air, touching the back of their necks and stealing their ability to think.

Fear seemed to materialize, swelling behind their backs.

And in that moment, Sifo’s corpse suddenly sat up on the seat.

Thabo and Sibusiso lost all sense and control
at the horror they saw — the van swerved off the road and slammed into a pole.

No one survived.
Except for Sifo.

At dawn, Sifo brought the bodies
to the owner of the house they had raided the night before.
The necromancer was waiting in the backyard, sipping coffee.

“Finally, you showed up,” he said.
“Good boy. I’d give you a bone to chew, but you’ve got no head.”
