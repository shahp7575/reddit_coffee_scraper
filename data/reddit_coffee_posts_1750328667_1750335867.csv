And then... the truth hit hard.,"Hey everyone i want to share something which happen recently with me and created a deep impact on me mentally. For some people maybe it is just a normal thing and there is nothing to worry about. For context I am an introvert kind of guy got bullied lot in school and rejected many times as i was super skinny. For 2-3 years i locked in myself and focus solely on my career and gym, grooming and all. Recently there is a girl in my gym she joined a month back. She and I use to have eye contacts continuous back and forth. Mostly she is the one who initiate it . For  months I ignore tell myself things like oh you should focus on yourself in gym and stuff like that. I  thought maybe we are in tier 3 city and if i go like that things can wrong so i waited but not realized i have given lot of attachment to it. . One day I just say hi to her . She spoke nicely. Later on for 3-4 days same things goes on we talk. Finally  day arrive I ask her for coffee . To which she replied with a smile ok . And then there was a shocking thing happen to me she told she have a boyfriend and she is really sorry for giving wrong signals in first place . I just told her no issues .She gave me  compliment for my physique . She told we can be friends . And I replied ya sure . But from next day onwards things got so awkward and  again those eye contacts. Now her boyfriend(i am not sure her friend or boyfriend) also join gym . Now I am trying to avoid any eye contact with her. She still try to hold an eye contact or look at me when i perform my sets but i am trying to avoid her. I am not blaming her not me . I approach with full honesty no game nothing. I attach so much feelings and thoughts for month that result me in heartbreak. But in this whole incident i got spiritually more connected. The type of relationship , love i want in my life . I am now patiently waiting and believe universe will shower me with love very soon.

1lf9ec4,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreeceTravel/comments/1lf9ec4/why_i_dont_like_athens_at_all/,Why I don't like Athens at all,"Let me be clear that I really don't intend to offend anybody with this or discredit the Greek people, this is just my personal experience and my opinion so far, 3 months into my stay in Athens.

First of all, Athens is the ugliest looking city I have ever stayed in in my life (second to maybe Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam because of the EXTREME pollution there), and I have traveled to 29 countries and countless cities across 5 continents. Sure, there are the few tourist attractions / monuments like Acropolis. But other than that, the entire city center within a radius of 5km+ and even other areas like Piraeus are just horrible in my opinion.

You have to constantly look down at the ground in front of you while walking because every couple meters there is dog excrement or human pee or cockroaches or whatever else on the sidewalk. The ridiculous amount of graffiti on every building in combination with all the abandoned / torn down / vandalized buildings makes the entire city so extremely ugly to look at and gives the entire city a ghetto vibe. Very occasionally you may come across a street that's a bit better, not crowded, not so much trash and feces on the ground, newer buildings etc., but then one block ahead it's back to trash again. Then there is the constant threat of people throwing dirty water or whatever down from their balconies which you have to avoid. 

Then, the people... Yes, I'm sorry to say this for all the nice Greek people out there, but also the people in Athens are some of the worst I have ever encountered. In my first month of staying in Athens I already had bricks thrown at me by some gypsy kids for no reason, and Hindi slurs yelled at me by random dudes on the street while just walking to the grocery store. On top of that, NOBODY seems to have any respect for anybody else's personal space in this city and it seems like everybody thinks they are the main character. I don't mean that in any Karen kind of way, but what I mean is that random groups people will block every sidewalk and not move out of the way until you stop right behind them and ask if they can please move. Every street will have at least 1 fatso just standing in the middle of the sidewalk blocking the entire path not paying attention to anything around them. When people are walking in the opposite direction, they will also take up all the space on the sidewalk and if you don't move for them, they will walk right through you. 

It irritates me to the point now where I just want to see what happens if, instead of moving for people, I just do the same as them, flex my shoulder and smash it into theirs at full force. Will they want to fight me? At this point I'm so fed up with it that I'm willing to find out and fight them over it lol. 

Also, I just see a lot of anti-social behavior from people in general that honestly disgusts me. I've seen someone taking a dump next to a tree in a park with their cheeks fully exposed. I've seen someone taking a leak with their penis fully exposed against a tree on a damn sidewalk. I see these fat and ugly mothers that have 0 control over their child and don't care about anything, and if their child was to harass a random stranger on the street, the mother would do nothing about it and probably even join the kid in the harassment if the stranger says something about it. On top of that, I just sense a lot of hostility from people on the street in general. I've never seen a population that looks so miserable and unwelcoming.

Can someone explain to me why every single street has at least 4 - 20 people just sitting there doing nothing but staring at every person that walks by? You can't walk through a street without random dudes just sitting there with their phone, looking at you as you walk by. They always have to make eye contact as you walk by and I just don't understand why. 

I also feel like there is absolutely nothing to do in Athens apart from see the main tourist attractions. All I see people do is drink beer or coffee and smoke all day. I myself have resorted to finding a nice gym where I spend most of my days now, and other than that I just work. Gym, work, gym, work, that's all I do. The hostility and intimidation of the people on the streets even helped to motivate me to hit the gym hard again, because now that I'm getting bigger and stronger, I'm not intimidated by them anymore and they probably won't mess with me as much as before. 

I have no friends or family in this city or country even, so I am all alone here. I came here with my usual adventurous spirit to explore and experience life in a new place I've never been before. But Athens has been nothing but a huge disappointment for me. 

I'm sure that this is just my personal experience, and as for any place, different people will have opposing opinions and experiences. Somebody else may find this the best place ever. But to me it's the worst place I've been to, much worse even than major cities in South America or Asia. I guess I just wanted to vent a bit because the longer I stay here, the more annoying it becomes. I thought it would only get better after a while, but it doesn't.

1lf9cuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AiChampions/comments/1lf9cuc/what_kind_of_car_could_one_ai_automation_client/,What Kind of Car Could One AI Automation Client Pay For?,"If you've got business owners in your warm network, let's have a bit of fun...

Last year, [Go High Level](https://honeysyed.com/gohighlevel) bought me a Porsche Taycan.

I’m so grateful.

But, to be honest with you… I would never consider a car like this, if I had to pay for it myself. I am not a flashy guy. I bought a ""posh"" glass-top underground wine cellar for my 40th, but I don’t drink anymore - D’oh!

I like sharing delicious food and exotic holidays with my friends and family.

I really savour my flat white coffee every morning from my swish La Marzocco machine. But I can’t think of what else from the ‘material’ world I need? If I did like to SPEND though, How fun would it be to explore? What kind of ride could DBR with AI put in your driveway? Paid for in cash!

… exactly how many old leads would the client need to have? Dunno for sure without knowing your numbers? But… here's some results from the top of my files for ya...

(These are from different clients and niches running ""Sleeping Beauty"" DBR with AI campaigns.)

One HVAC client - $17,500 per month lead package combined with our ‘speed to lead’ Android, signed as soon as they saw a DEMO

One Debt Consolidation client - £60K from a ‘dead’ database, plus ongoing performance-based deal to replace their call center.

One client handed over $100K ""up front"" for the idea alone.

So, now you can see, even with a small biz like HVAC there may be a fun new car in there.

If you're shootin' for the new Porsche Taycan? Well, maybe you'd need to land 2 or 3 ""DBR + AI"" clients? Don't forget ol' Uncle Sam.

When my wife Emily wanted her 7-seater ""weekend football taxi"" to run our kids and their friends around, I just said yes to another AI client.

(I do the choosing these days)

What kind of car could a single ""DBR + AI"" client pay for you? Don't know if you've considered it?

If you're thinking, ""I don’t know how to do the tech, or I'm just not good enough at sales to crank out a brand new car.""

I feel you, that's what nearly all of my peeps say before they get on their first coffee date demo. 

**That’s exactly why I put together the Survive to Thrive Playbook.**

Inside, I’ll show you 5 easy ways to make serious money with AI, even if you’re brand new.

[Grab your copy here](https://honeysyed.com/flexxable)

Then the magic happens.

Once I give them the strategy, templates, prompts and case studies, they go off and crank out 10 coffee dates and 10 new clients which could completely pay off a fun new ride if they wished.

Hey, let me rub some shiny off...

… sometimes we mess it up.

… it happens

... One of my failures only brought in £3K on a database of 360 leads and then they didn't want to go again.

But, that's still a used car, right? Maybe you're not in the market for a new ride? I dunno?

1lf9cnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lf9cnb/i_cheated_in_my_7_year_relationship_and_its/,I cheated in my 7 year relationship and it's destroying me,"
Cheating is never excusable I'm not trying to excuse myself. What I did is unforgivable but I think the context of our relationship is an important factor. I just need to get this off my chest as I've never told anyone.

2 years in
He flirted with his ex behind my back. He felt so guilty and told me a few days/ a week later. He was sobbing and saying he was going to carve my name into himself and I had to beg him not to and try calm him down tell him it was ok.

3 years in
Found messages to 3 women in Reddit saying how hot they were and trying to flirt with them. Confronted him immediately and he said he didn't do it someone must have hacked his account he's never seen them before etc. eventually started crying saying he was being accused of something he hadn't done so I dropped it and forgave him instantly because I thought I was falsely accusing him.

5 years in 
Pushed and pushed for us to be poly when I was very unsure and uncomfortable. He said it was either that or he'd kill himself so I felt like I had to and it wouldn't be as bad as losing him. 
Him going to see a Jess was horrendous. I literally felt like I was being cheated on right to my face and the worst part was there's nothing I can do about it. I did this to myself I said this was okay. I can't take it back because he'll probably kill himself. And he was so happy, that was the happiest I've seen him in years was when he was getting attention from and fucking someone else and it absolutely destroyed me, I felt so suicidal for months and months. I had an unjust burning hatred for her that persisted for years after they stopped seeing eachother. I still kind of hate her I know I shouldn't.

He invited a girl over without telling me and spent the night with her. I found out when I turned up at his house as planned the next day he opened the door and said ""oh Alice's here btw"" then she was immediately in front of me. I ran upstairs and cried until she left. He claims he told me but he absolutely didn't or I wouldn't have been so shocked.
This whole time I never saw anyone on my own. I wanted to so it felt more fair and maybe I'd understand how he was feeling if I also saw someone. He didn't mind me seeing women but if I even mentioned even going to get a coffee with a man he would freak out. Sobbing and screaming that he's not enough, I should just leave him already and go be with this other guy until I would say okay I'm not going. He said multiple times I was allowed to see men but every time I even mentioned meeting a man he'd meltdown so I never did.

He has generally been abusive when he's mentally unwell through almost out while relationship. This has included: threatening to kill me, threatening to kill my family, threatening to out me to my family, threatening to hurt my animals, threatening to burn the house down, saying I deserve to die because I'm disabled, trying to kick me out the house in the middle of the night in all kinds of weather, throwing and breaking objects, waving weapons around, being horrible to make me break up with him so he can kill himself, calling me names, insulting me, insulting and making fun of stuff I like, berating me for hours and breaking down my world views and values for over 9 hours at night when I have work in the morning, begging me to let him kill himself already and asking why I'm torturing him by making him be here, and that I need to tell him that he can die it's okay and so much more I can't even remember right now 

The most recent really bad thing was when he was really drunk he said got on top of me pinning me to the bed and wrapped his hands round my neck. He didn't squeeze at all but his hands were around my neck and I couldn't move. I shouted at him to get off of me and he wouldn't. I tried to pull his hand off and he restrained me with his other hand. I managed to get one of my legs underneath him and kicked him so hard in the chest. He was drunk so he stumbled backwards and knocked loads of stuff everywhere. I started crying and he looked at me like I was crazy and said he was just joking. When I've brought it up later he's apologised and said he doesn't remember but I do I honestly feel scared of him still because of that I know he's capable of that now. This happened 3 weeks before I cheated.

7 years in
I went out drinking to meet a friend of 3 years that I'd never met. I don't remember but he told me later he kissed me. I remember kissing him and he asked if we could go back to the hotel, I said yes and I don't really remember much more than that I know we had sex. That whole night my bf was really worried about me trying to get in contact with me and I wouldn't answer my phone or I'd hang up. He thinks I was doing this deliberately as I was cheating on him but I literally don't remember at all I really don't think I was doing it deliberately I was probably too drunk to use my phone I barely remember anything. After that I continued to sext and flirt with him for 2 months. I knew it was wrong but I did it because it made me feel good. That's the ultimate selfish reason behind it. Due to how he's treated me I felt generally unsafe, scared and like I had already been betrayed by him over and over for years. My trust and boundies had already been repeatedly violated for the past 5 years. I felt like I deserved to feel good for once, he gets to go around fucking people and feeling happy whilst also stopping me from seeing any men how is that fair. I wanted to tell him but I thought he might kill himself ofc so I didn't which I know is cowardly. He saw my phone and found out and confronted me 3 months ago. I feel awful I feel like I'm the most disgusting person ever. I feel evil and abusive. I would do anything to undo it. I literally feel like I deserve to die for what I've done and I don't know how to feel any better about it. It's completely consuming me.

If anyone even reads this I know they will say to break up but I can't. I love him too much and he'll definitely kill himself. That's why I've never told anyone because I know I won't be able to follow through on their advice. I just wanted to say it even if no one sees.

TLDR: I cheated on my partner after several issues in our relationship and I don't think I can ever forgive myself ",1,1750335487.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

One minute, you're chilling, maybe sipping your coffee, and the next? BAM! Your heart’s doing a drum solo in your chest, your breath's trying to break records for fastest pace, and your muscles are tighter than your jeans after Thanksgiving dinner. It’s like your body suddenly gets the memo that you’re freaking out even if your mind is still processing what’s happening.

Here’s the kicker: it’s not just in your head. Anxiety doesn’t just send a text saying, ""Hey, I’m here!"" Oh no, it sends a full-on physical entourage. Tight chest? Check. Dizziness? Check. That weird feeling like you’re about to fall through the floor even though you're standing still? Big check. Anxiety gets *creative* with how it wants to show up.

But here’s the thing: it’s just your body reacting to a trigger. It’s like your internal alarm system going off... for no good reason, obviously. So next time you feel the anxiety ninja coming through, remember that it’s not trying to sabotage you... it’s just trying to get your attention. And trust me, it’s really good at it.

So, how do you deal with it? Well, learning how to manage those physical symptoms can help you disarm it. Deep breathing, grounding techniques, or even just laughing at how ridiculous the whole situation feels because let’s be honest, anxiety’s a little extra sometimes.

Psyhullim husk was the only supplement really at about 15mg a day half in the morning then half in the evening before dinner.

Cut out all red meat only lean chicken and turkey and a lot more fish and shellfish

Also cut cheese and full fat milk and no butter

Always only used olive oil anyways

Main fiber was overnight oats, blueberries, raspberries and milled flaxseed with the husk and a small bit of honey every morning . Then lentails and maybe sometype of beans and veg for dinner.

Had at least 1 cheat day a month and 4 days in Rome as well mixed were i eat around me.

10k-13k steps a day and light run of 5km 3 times a week

Was told to go on a statin but wanted to try diet first and see

Then the following day I had chest pains and my heart rate spiked and dipped like crazy so I finally threw in the towel and decided to go to the ER and get checked out. I have a family history of early heart disease, chronic heart failure, and I was born with a heart murmur so I wanted to be sure I was alright. I am fine — but some this was weird and the ER couldn’t sus it out so I’ve been advised to follow up with a cardiologist.

I called my ‘partner’ to talk about heading to the hospital and I told him I was scared. He wrote me off and said “It’s just chest pains.” I hung up quickly to call my sister because I was upset and I needed to speak with someone who cared. I get to the hospital and continue to give him updates and he’s proving lack luster responses like “I’m sorry you’re going through that.” I tell him I wish he was there and he says pretty much nothing. It’s late, he’s dayshift and I’m night shift so a part of me is chalking it up to him being on the threshold of sleep — but no. Wait for it.

So I get discharged, I speak with my boss (I had left work) and he tells me to go home and rest up so I do. My partner and I don’t live together but he was staying at mine that night so he could play my PlayStation. Being nightshift I stayed up a few more hours before getting into bed with him. I think, okay, sure, he’s asleep so I cant really blame him for not waking up to ask if I’m okay. I go to sleep. I wake up and he’s gone. I text him and he says he just left after playing my PlayStation all day — so now I’m actually very upset because he never asks if I’m okay. Didn’t stick around to ask. I go into the kitchen and the sink is full of his dishes. The counter is littered with his trash. My trash is overfull with half his trash and I have to haul it to the dumpster in pain. Because the chest pains are still there and my migraine for the other day is back in full force.

I wrap my head around this and how I’m feeling about it before I confront him about being hurt. Takes a couple hours. When I do confront him he tells me he was drunk that night (he’s an alcoholic, he promised me he was working on it when we got together but he’s backslid quite a bit) and he shouldn’t have said what he said about chest pains. I tell him he’s just  shown me what my life looks like ten years from now if I get cancer — he’s apologetic and in disbelief that I feel like this. (I told him I didn’t believe he’d come to the hospital if my condition was serious.) We agree to meet up and discuss in person.

We did that on Monday. I explained to him that I don’t ask for much (in response he said that I don’t ask for anything) and I told him that was because I feel like I can’t. And the one time I did he drug ass on it for three weeks and then I ended up doing that thing myself after he made a hundred excuses. (That one thing in question was to refill my cold brew growler because he works 1/8th of a mile from the coffee shop and I gave him the money) I told him that somewhere down the line he forgot that my love language is acts of service and he’s been making me feel uncared for for a while. I said that if we can’t come to a resolution then I have to walk away.

This whole ordeal made me stop ignoring some serious red flags my ‘partner’ has displayed in the past. This ain’t the first time he’s failed to show up for me. I told him this was the last time I was having this conversation. We don’t live together, we have plans to move in in the fall but at this point I’m iffy on it. He seemed very apologetic and chastised after our conversation.

So, to reiterate: Is this something we can work on and rebuild? Do I really want to?

Because today I came home from a very rough 12 hour shift and wanted a glass of cold water but he didn’t refill the brita (after he once again stayed the night to play my PlayStation) and that set my teeth on edge.",1,1750334999.0,TwoHotTakes,10,0.67,False
1lf9683,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lf9683,Update and parts list for my Tamper Mod,">**Small note / Attention:** *The measurements I have taken refer to my tamper / handle! I don't know how exact the tolerances are in the production of the handle. Measure it yourself to be on the safe side!*

This is an update to the following post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CafelatRobot/comments/1leqb37/my\_first\_mod\_for\_the\_tamper/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CafelatRobot/comments/1leqb37/my_first_mod_for_the_tamper/)

Since the interest in my mod was much greater than expected and I can't edit the original post, I'm giving the full info and my impressions after a few days of use. I have **all the names under which the parts can be found** (e.g. on Amazon or AliExpress) **and the dimensions in the pictures**.



**PRO:**

* affordable and matches the design of the tamper
* durable and easy to assemble / disassemble
* works well and my pucks are much more even since then

**CON:**

* the cable grommet that holds the washer smells of rubber

**NEUTRAL / Info on the individual parts:**

* I would prefer to have all the rubber parts in red instead of black, then it would match all robots

* the plug/grommet at the top warps slightly inwards when pressed on firmly
* a plug that wraps around the handle might be more stable here
* but it gives a feeling like a tamper with a spring, when it stops giving way, you have pressed hard enough

* the washer could be one millimeter wider on the outside (but haven't found a suitable one)
* the edges of the washer are fortunately not rough, but if they were, then a protection would be better so that it does not scratch the basket

* the cable grommet that holds the washer smells of rubber, but fortunately it doesn't come into contact with the coffee or other foodstuffs
* I only smell it when I put my nose right up to it (but I don't have the best sense of smell)

Do you still believe what you see?","I would like to highlight the fact that AI video clips, most likely created with VEO 3, are already being used in the context of war propaganda, in this example by a YouTube channel with half a million subscribers. So far, I found no comments below the video that actually pointed out the two fake video clips of ""the bombed-out streets of Tel Aviv"".  
  
I purposely watch reports from all sides of a conflict and the point of this post is not related to my promoting any particular view on the issue. Discussing the political issue would be off-topic in this subreddit, and I will refrain from that here. I am much more concerned, that as of now, we will not be able to believe any video footage coming out of Iran, Israel, Ukraine or Russia or wherever the next conflict will erupt.

Watch here, starting just before the AI clips: [https://youtu.be/TdhKRfP-O4o?si=hW3VX9kdd4o-U5qu&t=434](https://youtu.be/TdhKRfP-O4o?si=hW3VX9kdd4o-U5qu&t=434)  
  
Using AI created fake clips of ""Israeli comedians"" to supposedly expose media lies is kind of ironic: At 7:14 the host says: ""They really are a shameless bunch of lying cowards. So much so that even Israeli comedians are taking to the bombed-out streets of Tel Aviv to mock their leaders for bombing  every country in the Middle East."" 

Both clips that follow are clearly fake AI created slop. How many other clips on this channel are fake? At 7:32, the misspelled words on the ""Visitor Pas"" and the sub-titles of the guy on the ""the bombed-out streets of Tel Aviv"" are still a dead give-away, but as AI is getting better every week this will become harder to recognize. At 7:41 the second clip is just as bad, with the words continuing to be spoken while the guy is drinking coffee. I cannot believe anything any more that I see!

How do you view videos shown on YouTube and even on mainstream media during a time of international conflicts? Do you still trust what you see? 

If a low cost service such as VEO 3 can already produce clips that apparently mislead a majority of viewers, how much more difficult will it be to spot convincing AI war videos produced by intelligence agencies?",0,1750334743.0,Bard,0,0.5,False

## What is Roig Elevado?

Roig Elevado is an **automated trading platform** that uses artificial intelligence to help users trade across different financial markets — including **cryptocurrencies, forex, and stocks**. Think of it like having a trading bot that scans the market 24/7, looking for patterns and making trades on your behalf based on parameters you set.

The platform is designed to reduce the emotional stress and time commitment typical traders face. If you’re tired of manually watching charts and trying to time your trades, Roig Elevado steps in as your digital assistant.

What sets it apart is its **focus on simplicity and automation**, making it accessible for beginners while still offering enough customization for experienced traders.

## Who Created Roig Elevado?

This part’s a bit murky. Like many trading platforms in this category, **the team behind Roig Elevado isn’t prominently advertised**. There are mentions of developers and financial analysts working behind the scenes, but no official public leadership team.

That said, it shares similarities with platforms like **Bitcoin Code, Immediate Edge, and Bitcoin Era**, which have also been designed by anonymous but skilled developers. Usually, platforms like these are backed by development teams specializing in financial tech and AI algorithms.

While anonymity might be a red flag for some, it’s also kind of standard practice in the **automated trading world**. Still, I'd prefer at least a LinkedIn profile or two to verify who's running the show.

## How Does Roig Elevado Work?

Roig Elevado uses **AI-driven algorithms** to analyze market data in real-time and execute trades for you. Here's a simplified breakdown of how it operates:

1. **You set your trading parameters** – like how much to trade, risk tolerance, and asset preferences.
2. The platform’s **AI scans the market 24/7** to find trade opportunities that match your criteria.
3. When a match is found, it **executes trades automatically**, aiming to buy low and sell high.
4. You can sit back and **monitor trades on the dashboard** or intervene manually if you want.

The AI component is probably the biggest draw here. It’s designed to **eliminate emotional decision-making** and act purely on data. That’s a big plus for people who panic-sell or FOMO-buy (guilty as charged).

## Roig Elevado Pros and Cons

Like anything in the trading world, Roig Elevado has its **ups and downs**. Here’s a quick breakdown based on my experience and community feedback:

- ✅ **No hidden fees** – what you see is what you get

Overall, it's a solid platform, especially for casual or new traders. But if you're a pro looking for granular technical analysis tools, you might find it a bit basic.

# Fuel crunch foreseen as county moves into summer

*“The United States will be facing an energy crisis for the next seven years. A lot of people are already going back to coal or converting to electricity and many Door county residents are anxious to add fireplaces to their homes . . .”*

*“We were promised an adequate supply of fuel for the school but that was before the middle east crisis, I don’t know if the situation has changed or not . . .”*

*“With less gas available and increased costs it may be desirable to eliminate side trips and make it imperative to remain in one place for vacations. . .”*

**By LINDA ADAMS**

This week’s coffee shop chatter on the energy crisis? No. These predictions appeared in the Advocate, in November of 1973 and probably not even the seers who made them can believe their prophecies would be relived again in less than a decade.

The first quote is from the late Carnie Seiler, former civil defense administrator; the second speaker was Southern Door School Administrator Lloyd Jilot and the third was John Alward, owner of the Chanticleer Inn at Eagle River. Each of these statements could have been spoken on May 15, 1979.

The energy crisis of 1973-74 — long, frustrating lines at the gas pumps, closed stations, heating oil shortages and soaring fuel prices are all happening again for the second time in six years. Economists on a national level maintain that while the nation has not yet reached a crisis, compared to six years ago the energy crunch is potentially more dangerous.

“It’s hurting me. I’m not half through the month of May and I’ve already pumped 50 percent of my allocation for the month,” Joe Martorano, owner and manager of Joe’s Bay Standard told the Advocate Monday morning.

“I closed down Saturday afternoon and all day Sunday for the first time. I’m only getting 20 percent of the allocation I received last year and I don’t know how long it will last.”

Gasoline wholesaler Vivian Muckian, vice president and secretary of Muckian Oil Co. estimates her allocation has been cut between 10 and 15 percent. She and her husband own five gas stations and she says she hasn’t cut back on allocations to the stations yet but she doesn’t know what is in sight.

“The biggest problem is with fuel oil for homes,” she said Monday. “We haven’t had to place any homes on allocation but we’re lucky warm weather is coming.”

“We aren’t taking on any new oil accounts,” Charles Weigand of Weigand Oil Co. reports. “We are only getting 80 per cent of last year’s usage and we expect trouble.”

Weigand says he plans to close the service station he owns on Sundays and may possibly shut down on Saturdays too.

“We just don’t have the fuel and there is no way to buy it — no matter how much it costs. If you think it’s bad now wait until next year.”

Regarding the home heating oil shortage, Weigand warned consumers to start conserving now. “If we can only get 80 per cent of the fuel we need the customers are only going to get 80 per cent of their needs and that’s the long and short of it,” he warns.

[Mayor Dan Nielsen had his blood pressure taken by Mary Lindhorst, public health nurse, as he checked his proclamation asking others to do likewise.](https://preview.redd.it/to359rwj8p7f1.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=1980c93401a951864575dce6f5ec08983317a100)

“The public has got to realize that there is a real crisis,” maintains William Lawrie, gasoline wholesaler and fuel oil distributor.

Lawrie has already been cut back 20 percent on his allocations and anticipates he might be cut even further in the future.

“The priorities are set by the government,” Lawrie pointed out. “People don’t realize that farmers must first be given 100 per cent of their current requirements and then areas like schools, service crews, telephone companies and others must have their needs met before we can give gas to the service stations.”

According to Lawrie, his suppliers have been warning of the impending situation for several months and telling him to start building inventories. Lawrie’s problem is that it is difficult for a small company like his to meet the expense of building inventories; first, because he doesn’t have the storage tanks and second, because of the overhead cost involved.

“The public thinks that gasoline and oil dealers are really making a killing because of the rise in the price of gas at the pumps. That is not true,” Lawrie contends, “you have to look at the replacement costs. It’s going to get to the point very soon where you can’t replace the product for what you are selling it for.

While dealers here are warning their customers to start conserving, polls show that not only in Door county but nationally people are reluctant to believe there is a crisis. A poll last year revealed that only 33 percent of those interviewed thought the energy situation was serious.

A recent national survey by the American Automobile Assn. of 4,200 gas stations showed that about 15 per cent have already instituted their own rationing program because of supply problems. Thirteen per cent are closing earlier on weekdays and three per cent are limiting purchases by either gallon or dollar amounts.

Ruth Clusen, assistant secretary of energy, speaking to Wisconsin Press Women in Green Bay last Saturday, warned there is a real shortage, not just a manufactured crisis.

“You have to believe there is a serious problem and it will even reach Green Bay and surrounding areas,” she said.

Mrs. Clusen sharply criticized Congress for its defeat of the President’s request for authority to develop a standby plan for gas rationing.

She predicted that the four members of the Wisconsin delegation as well as others in Congress will be sorry for voting against the plan. “We will see the results of their vote in the months to come,” she said, “when long lines at stations, earlier closings and weekend closings will be common.”

The author of a recent energy article in the May issue of “Nation’s Business” asserted that “Until the public believes there is an energy crisis, it is unrealistic to think that elected officials are going to put their political futures on the line by voting for unpopular pieces of legislation.”

On the local level, Lawrie predicts that people in Door county will start feeling the crunch by the end of the month.

“The first problems will come Memorial Day weekend when half of the stations in Door county will have to close because they have no gas,” says Lawrie. “Then people here will believe there is trouble. Farmers have to have their gas first and most of them haven’t even been able to get onto the fields yet.”

Weigand advises residents here who are sincere about finding a solution to start writing to their legislators to find out why the problem isn’t being cured.

The one dissenter of the few gasoline managers contacted is Jae Straubel, manager of the Clark station on Michigan Ave. “My personal feelings are that when the price of gasoline reaches $1 a gallon we won’t have any shortage. If there really is a shortage,” Straubel questions, “why don’t they put a carburetor on the market that can get 50 miles to a gallon?”

Straubel’s allocation was cut last month and again this month after a closing of the bridge contributed to a drop in sales at his station and he fears he may not be able to get back that extra amount after the bridge reopens.

Nationally, energy experts agree that industry has already demonstrated that it can meet the challenge of conservation but the public has not.

In the same article in “Nation’s Business” one economist maintained that “Iran could turn out to be a blessing if it jolts people into realizing how precarious the energy situation really is. Obviously this country needs to have a near-crisis to put the fear of God in people before they will act.

“The Iranian disruption has sounded another loud warning to the U.S. The critical question is: Is anybody listening.”

As Mrs. Clusen summed it up in her speech Saturday, “You will have to decide whether to be cold next winter or drive to your cabins every weekend this summer?”

Or as last week’s Time magazine asked in its heading on a story about the upcoming crisis, “Drive now, freeze later?”

For context, I didn't want to and in a way I was the dumpee because it was really me having to stand up to someone who was non-committal and wishy washy. 

I went no contact and said I would not be speaking to her again for some time (maybe ever). I didn't block her on social media at the time because I didn't feel it necessary. 

No contact was going really well for me. I've been spending time with my friends, my family, my hobbies, and whilst the first two weeks were rough I eventually appreciated the perspective distance gave me and realised she was ultimately a toxic person. 

Unfortunately, we work together. I have been into the office a couple of times (we wfh a lot) and didn't see her. Then all of a sudden, she was there. 

I felt physically sick. She asked to sit next to me when she could have honestly sat on the other side of the office and I probably wouldn't have realised she was there the whole day. 

I said yes because saying no in front of the room felt strange. 

She asked to get coffee. I should have said no. Unfortunately, if this had happened a few more months down the line I think I would have been stronger. I said yes. 

She asked how I'd been and probed a bit. She said she'd gotten sober. She told me she is travelling to my dream country. I asked if she'd missed me and she admitted she had. We both established we were seeing other people although tbh it was clear there was mutual weirdness about that. 

She then asked me to have lunch with her. She caught me up on all of her friends and the things I'd missed out on hearing. She told me she'd reflected and realised she'd only seen me as a friend the whole time, and I know that's simply untrue but let it go. It still hurt. She asked if I still had the plushie she gave me. She asked about the woman I'm seeing and told me the men she's seeing (multiple) aren't serious prospects. 

She wants to be friends. I asked her if she truly still didn't appreciate how badly she'd hurt me and how bad her behaviour was. She apologised multiple times through the day but I could tell she just wanted absolution. She said she wants to come into the office more and implied it's to see me. 

She said ""if I wanted you back right now I know I could have you"". I called her a narcissist. 

I had almost dreamt of this. Going no contact, healing, us running into each other and having coffee and me getting some answers. 

What I got though was a reminder that she hasn't and won't change. She will never admit I meant something, and she will always pretend I didn't to keep the upper hand. She saw me as a tool for validation and still needs to believe she has me. She dates people she knows aren't real options and strings them along. She doesn't have boundaries. 

What was bitter sweet was the realisation that no matter how adamant she was that I was just a friend to her during our half a year of dating, she still wanted to have coffee. She is the one watching every story. She still needed lunch, she still needed to bait me and see if I cared. She missed me, and she missed out. 

I will be no contacting her again, aside from the fact that I cannot avoid seeing her now and then at work. Because no contact, even when they come back, isn't about getting them to come back. The them that comes back is someone who had to go for a reason.

Cold, distant, and we were never close. He was always with his cigarette and black coffee, reading newspaper/books with our late cat Abu on the porch.

My dad loved books. Almost every weekend he’d take me to a bookstore. We didn’t talk much, we’d just sit together lost in our books.

My dad and my mom got married 3 months after they met. My mom told me she never actually loved my dad. She got married just because her dad told her to and my dad at the time had a good job already. 

I think my dad was stuck in an unhappy marriage. I don’t think my parents were a good match. They were so different in many ways. 

My dad became quiet and he shut down when I was in middle school. Everyone, my mom, my sister and I stopped talking to him. I think he fell into a severe and prolonged depression even until the moment he died.

My dad, thankfully died in a peaceful way.

He had just dropped my sister at the airport because she was about to visit me in Tokyo. I had just moved to Tokyo 3 months prior. He insisted on driving my sister even though my mom said she would drive. 

My dad out of the blue texted me 2 things “Don’t listen to the voices that don’t matter” and “be good to your sister”. It was midnight and I thought he was being weird. He usually texted me to send some money or asked if my grades were okay. 

Then in the morning, I picked my sister up from Haneda. Halfway through the trip back to my dorm, we got a call from my mom. She said my dad had a heart attack and he “might” die so we needed to come home. Shortly after we “met” him, he took his last breath and passed away at exacly 7 PM 19th of June 2019.

I am not superstitious and not even religious. But I do believe the universe had made the “best” plan for how my dad would die. I don’t know what I would do if my sister weren’t there. I was 19 years old in a strange country. I don’t know if I’d be strong enough to be in that flight without my sister. My dad “knew” she was my rock. He “sent” her to help me get through the process. 

Now I just wish I had more time with him to fix our relationship. He made a lot of mistakes, but I wish I had reached out to him. I wish I had made more effort. I wish I had been more forgiving.",6,1750334228.0,AsianParentStories,1,1.0,False

Because honestly… I didn’t expect to show up here and feel like I’m being treated like a scammer.

That stings.

Not because I need validation.

But because I’ve lived through hell and found something that could save someone else from it…

…and I feel like I can’t even share it without getting shut down.

Please — don’t confuse my enthusiasm for spam.

I’m not here to pitch.

I’m here because I know exactly what this pain feels like.

Let me take you back.

I’m a welder from a small town in BC.
A few years ago, my wife and I bought a little coffee shop, thinking we were building freedom.

We believed that if we worked hard, treated people well, and created something beautiful — the customers would come.

They didn’t.

We were bleeding money.
Even during the so-called “busy season,” we barely made enough to breathe.

And when the slow season hit?
I panicked.

I was terrified we’d lose our home.

I worried constantly that my marriage

wouldn’t survive the pressure.
I saw my wife slipping into depression…

Exhausted. Disconnected. Empty.

And I couldn’t blame her — because I dragged her into this mess thinking I was doing something good for us.

But I wasn’t just failing as a business owner.

I felt like I was failing as a husband… and a father.

No one talks about that part.

The emotional toll.

The guilt.

The sleepless nights wondering if everything you’ve worked for is about to collapse.

And then… it did.

We were forced to shut the business down.

And let me tell you something most people won’t admit:

The stress didn’t end when we closed the doors.

It got worse.

I was still buried in debt.
Still trying to figure out how to get out of the financial disaster I had created.

Still dealing with the weight of knowing I’d put my family through something I couldn’t undo.

And that’s when, almost by accident, I stumbled across something that finally made sense.

A strategy. A system. 

A completely different way of thinking about how to bring customers in consistently, without relying on hope and foot traffic.

If I had found this earlier?

I honestly believe our business would have thrived.

It would have spared us years of pain, stress, and financial strain.

But now, I’m stuck in this weird space…

And I’m not thinking like “OG Klon” or “90s special chip Memory Man” (although if you wanna talk about em, do it up)…

… instead, what’s a relatively common pedal that does its job so well that trading or selling is just pointless; you’re not gonna get an upgrade?  What’s the kind of pedal you should keep because nothing (maybe even better or more modern things) don’t quite have the features or maybe have too many features? 

My personal ones… easily obtained:  Caroline Megabyte delay. Love the drive and grit, love the delay sound.  It’s not as present and forward as other digital delays, gives you modulation if you want it, tap tempo, long range of delay times.  It’s most of a fancy expensive analog delay without being truuuuuuly analog.  It sits just above the features of something like a DD-7 or 8; but spending way more for a nice analog delay won’t really get much more…

Less easily obtained and kinda obvious: SSBS f*ck overdrive.  I know that many of us would argue no audience member at a show really can tell the difference between drives.  I get that!  But I find that the relatively warm sound of the f*ck at low-to-mid gains, AND the crackle/breakup knob, has not been easy to replace.  I tried the Barbershop and it wasn’t drive-ish enough; some other drives are too metallic or crunchy.  This has been one of those “not much else does it all in one box”… 


So that’s my personal take… if you have a F*ck, keep a F*ck!!!

[The Akron Legal News](https://www.akronlegalnews.com/editorial/36866)

[https:\/\/www.niocorp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/NioCorp\_Presentation.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/wu99ca4iav7f1.png?width=1793&format=png&auto=webp&s=7405d556c60dd7121a3d969b825167a71ea8e2a2)

GANZHOU, China (AP) — China's dominance over critical minerals in global supply chains was a powerful bargaining chip in trade talks between Beijing and Washington that concluded with both sides saying they have a framework to pursue a deal.

China has spent decades building the world's main industrial chain for mining and processing such materials, which are used in many industries such as electronics, advanced manufacturing, defense and health care.

Mines and factories in and around Ganzhou, a key production hub for rare earths, underpin China's control over the minerals. Many residents grew up collecting rocks containing the valuable minerals from the forested hills surrounding the southern city and today make a living from mining, trading or processing them.

# Critical minerals as a trade issue

Responding to ever higher tariffs and other controls on advanced technology, China told exporters of certain key rare earths and other critical minerals to obtain licenses for every shipment abroad. Approvals can take weeks, leading to supply chain disruptions in the U.S. and other countries.

President Donald Trump said that China would make it easier for American industry to obtain much-needed needed magnets and rare earth minerals, clearing the way for talks to continue between the world's two biggest economies. In return, Trump said, the U.S. will stop efforts to revoke the visas of Chinese nationals on U.S. college campuses.

But details remain scarce. Beijing has not confirmed what the negotiators agreed to, and Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump himself have yet to sign off on it.

The Chinese Commerce Ministry said it had approved a ""certain number"" of export licenses for rare earth products, apparently acknowledging Trump's personal request to Xi during a recent phone call. And the Ganzhou-based rare-earth conglomerate JL MAG Rare-Earth Co. confirmed it had obtained some export licenses for shipments to destinations including the U.S., Europe and Southeast Asia.

Experts say, however, Beijing is unlikely to do away with the permit system enabling it to control access to those valuable resources.

""I think what the Chinese have proven is they have now created an entire export control regime for rare earths,"" said Daniel Kritenbrink, a partner at The Asia Group consultancy. ""They can turn that spigot on and off at will.""

The only scenario in which China might deregulate its critical minerals export is if the U.S. fully removes tariffs imposed on Chinese goods as part of the trade war, said Wang Yiwei, a professor of international affairs at Renmin University, echoing the Chinese government's earlier stance.

""Without that,"" he said, ""it will be difficult to blame China for continuing to strengthen its export controls.""

# An industry built over decades with government support

In 1992, Deng Xiaoping, the leader who launched China's ascent as the world's biggest manufacturing power, famously said ""the Middle East has oil, China has rare earths,"" signaling a desire to leverage access to the key minerals.

Several generations later, Beijing has made its rich reserves of rare earths, a group of 17 minerals that are abundant in the earth's crust but hard, expensive and environmentally polluting to process, a key element of China's economic security. In 2019, during a visit to a rare earth processing plant in Ganzhou, Xi described rare earths as a ""vital strategic resource.""

China today has an essential monopoly over ""heavy rare earths,"" used for making powerful, heat-resistance magnets used in industries such as defense and electric vehicles.

The country also produces around 80% of the world's tungsten, gallium and antimony, and 60% of the world's germanium -– all minerals used in the making of semiconductors, among other advanced technologies.

The risks of dependency on Chinese suppliers first came into focus in 2010, when Beijing suspended rare earths exports to Japan due to a territorial dispute. The ban was lifted after about two months, but as a precaution, Japan invested in rare earths processing plants in other countries and began stockpiling the materials.

Beijing's across-the-board requirement for export licenses for some critical minerals has put pressure on world electronics manufacturers and automakers.

Some auto parts makers in Europe have shut down production lines due to delays in supply deliveries, according to the European Association of Automotive Suppliers. In the U.S., Tesla CEO Elon Musk said a shortage of rare earths is affecting his company's work on humanoid robots.

# China's critical minerals resources are dwindling

In the drab industrial hub of Ganzhou, cradled by the scenic Dayu Mountains, the U.S.-China trade war is still a distant stressor. Miners and small mineral traders interviewed by The Associated Press said they are more concerned about depleting the mountains' once-abundant resources.

Zhong, a tungsten factory manager in Ganzhou who would only give his last name, worked his way up to manager from a miner, but he's unsure there is a future for him and others in the industry.

""I find growing difficulties to source tungsten these days,"" he said, adding that smaller mines and trading companies are slowly disappearing as the resources are dwindling. Tungsten is an ultra-hard metal used in armor-piercing ammunition, nuclear reactors and semiconductors.

At least five tungsten mines have closed in the area in recent years, according to state media. Remaining reserves are deeper and harder to extract and process after decades of exploitation, said Li Shangkui, chairman of the Ganzhou-based Jiangxi Yuean Advanced Materials Co., Ltd.

Processing factories in Ganzhou now routinely source materials from other provinces or other countries. Zhong's plant imports some raw materials from places like Africa and Cambodia.

Major state-owned and private companies in Ganzhou are also ramping up investments abroad. Tungsten producer Ganzhou Haisheng, for instance, announced last year a $25 million investment in a new tungsten plant in Thailand.

Whatever the challenges in procuring raw materials, China likely will seek to maintain its dominance in critical minerals, said Fabian Villalobos, an engineer and critical minerals expert at the RAND think tank.

# The U.S. lags far behind China on critical minerals

Between 2020 and 2023, the U.S. imported at least 70% of the rare earth compounds it used from China, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It has diversified its sources in recent years, but still mainly relies on China.

Since beginning his second term in office, Trump has made improving access to critical minerals a matter of national security. But the U.S. has an incredibly long way to go to catch up with China, experts say.

The sole operational U.S. rare earths mine, in Mountain Pass, California, is unable to separate heavy rare earths. It sends its ore to China for processing. The U.S. Defense Department has provided funding to the mine's owner, MP Materials, to build new separation facilities. It will take months to build and still only produce a fraction of what is needed.

***Friction over the issue has opened the way for government-backed financing that was unavailable before, said Mark Smith, who ran the Mountain Pass mine in the early 2010s and now leads NioCorp. It's seeking about $780 million in financing through the U.S. Export-Import Bank to build a processing facility in Nebraska for critical minerals including rare earths.***

The Defense Department has committed $439 million to building domestic rare earth supply chains, but building a complete mining and processing industrial chain like China's could take decades.

***""There are going to be some real issues here unless we can figure out how to get along with China for a period of time while we're developing our own resources and our mainstream processing,"" Smith said.***

The spotlight on critical minerals also provides opportunities for smaller miners to invest in extracting and processing some critical minerals, such as tungsten, considered ""niche"" because they are needed in relatively small amounts in key industries, said Milo McBride, an expert on sustainability and geopolitics at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

""For many of these companies, the business strategy hedges on a scenario where the U.S. and China become more confrontational and where trade relations become more uncomfortable,"" McBride said. ""And all of a sudden, what was once an uneconomic project somewhere outside of China starts to make more sense.""

***MOSCOW, June 18 : The Russian Direct Investment Fund and the US may announce a number of projects in rare earths, Arctic and infrastructure that they are working on in the next couple of months, Russian Direct Investment Fund and Russian special presidential envoy for economic cooperation with foreign countries, Kirill Dmitriev, said.***

***“We are discussing a number of projects with US enterprises. We do not plan to make any specific statements at the SPIEF forum, but I would like to emphasise that we are working on a number of ongoing projects, which, I believe, will be announced in the next couple of months, in the field of rare earth minerals, the Arctic, infrastructure, and in many areas where we work,” Dmitriev told reporters on the 2025 St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) sidelines.***

Russia communicates with a large number of US businesses that promote dialogue between the two countries in the United States, Dmitriev, said.

“We communicate with a large number of American businesses that also promote dialogue between the United States and Russia in the United States, and they tell us that the Russian market is extremely important for American companies,” Dmitriev told a press conference following a business breakfast with the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia (AmCham) on the 2025 St. Petersburg International Economic Forum sidelines.

The economic component and the investment component are an important part of the dialogue between Russia and the United States, Dmitriev added.

“We are working to ensure that the dialogue between Russia and the United States moves forward. … We see that many of the American companies have remained in Russia and continue to develop actively and successfully here.

“We also see that there were many questions from those American investors, American companies that came here in order to expand their presence in the Russian market, in order to invest in Russia,” Dmitriev said.

The Russian city of St. Petersburg will host the 28th edition of SPIEF from June 18-21 under the theme of “Shared Values: The Foundation of Growth in a Multipolar World.”

Leaders from the Group of Seven nations and the European Union unveiled a G7 Critical Minerals Action Plan aimed at breaking China's supply chain dominance during a meeting held in Kananaskis, Alberta.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen brought with her a rare earths magnet produced at Neo Performance Materials' plant in Estonia to showcase what a G7 critical minerals supply chain could look like.

""It was manufactured in Estonia, by a Canadian company using raw materials sourced from Australia, and supported by the EU's Just Transition Fund,"" she said of the magnet she was displaying to G7 leaders. ""And where does it end up? In German, French, and American electric vehicles and wind turbines.""

The European Commission president said China's ""quasi-monopoly"" on rare earths and other critical minerals is a threat to Western nations – not only by controlling access to supply but by wielding that control to undermine efforts to establish competitive supply chains.

""We are seeing a new 'China shock,'"" she said. ""As China's economy slows down, Beijing floods global markets with subsidized overcapacity that its own market cannot absorb.""

The European Commission leader reflected on China's first instance of weaponization of rare earths in 2010, when Beijing cut off rare earth exports to Japan during a territorial dispute in the South China Sea. The embargo sent rare earth prices skyrocketing, which fueled the exploration and development of alternative supplies outside of China.

Beijing's response was to flood the market with cheap rare earths, wiping out rare earths operations in the West and leaving China to dominate.

""This pattern of dominance, dependency, and blackmail continues today,"" von der Leyen warned the G7 leaders gathered in Alberta.

She said Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union must work together ""to create alternatives along the supply chain – from mining and refining to recycling and stockpiling – and ensure critical mass of demand.""

""This is why we are interested in creating a metals club,"" the European Commission president added.

# G7 Critical Minerals Action Plan

President von der Leyen's address to the G7 set the stage for the launch of the G7 Critical Minerals Action Plan, which is focused on diversifying critical mineral supply chains away from China.

The action plan focuses on three key areas: diversifying supply chains, encouraging investments in critical minerals, and promoting innovation across the sector.

**Roadmap to standards-based markets** – Recognizing that critical minerals markets should reflect the total costs of responsible extraction, processing, and trade. The roadmap being developed by G7 ministers will establish a set of criteria that constitute a minimum threshold for standards-based critical markets, including the strengthening of traceability to ensure critical minerals are compliant with G7 responsibility standards.

**Mobilizing capital and investing in partnerships** – To help mining and processing companies overcome barriers such as permitting delays, market manipulation, and price volatility, the G7 is working on a united plan to increase investments in responsible critical mineral projects. The group encourages state and private financial institutions in member countries to allot additional capital for standards-based critical minerals project investments. The G7 also reaffirmed its commitment to deepening cooperation with mineral-rich emerging markets and developing country partners.

**Promoting innovation** – The group is also committed to leveraging the rich public and private innovation ecosystems within G7 nations with untapped potential to address strategic technology and processing gaps essential to bringing critical minerals to market. This includes intensifying collaboration to fill innovation gaps in critical minerals research and development, with a focus on processing, licensing, recycling, and substitution. The group plans to work with partner organizations to showcase new technologies and production processes.

Von der Leyen said that G7 nations have a better chance of breaking China's critical minerals dominance and the threat that quasi-monopoly poses to Western economies and security than they do working independently.

""A common G7 response increases our leverage – pressuring China to take more responsibility for the impact of its state-led growth model,"" she said.

To further increase their leverage, the group welcomes the endorsement of the G7 Critical Minerals Action Plan by the leaders of Australia, India, and South Korea.

The action plan will be advanced during the Conference on Critical Materials and Minerals, to be held in Chicago this September.

# Introduction

According to a 2008 National Research Council report, critical minerals are essential in use and subject to supply risks.[^(1)](https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/HTML/R47982.web.html#fn1) The report noted that critical minerals are essential for certain products and services.[^(2)](https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/HTML/R47982.web.html#fn2) For example, silicon, gallium, and germanium may be essential for manufacturing certain types of *semiconductors*.[^(3)](https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/HTML/R47982.web.html#fn3) Lithium, cobalt, and nickel may be essential for manufacturing certain types of batteries used in electric vehicles and other products. Some *rare earth elements* (REEs) may be essential for manufacturing touchscreens in electronic products and magnet-based motors that drive large wind turbines, electric vehicles, and other products.[^(4)](https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/HTML/R47982.web.html#fn4) Demand for semiconductors (i.e., computer chips), batteries, touchscreens, magnet-based motors, and other products is projected to grow in the next decade, leading to increased demand for critical minerals.[^(5)](https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/R/HTML/R47982.web.html#fn5)

Potential issues facing Congress are the effectiveness of current federal activities related to improving the resilience of critical mineral supplies for the United States and whether to alter legislative direction on critical minerals activities, in the context of recent Administrations' actions and changing demands and access to supplies.

***This CRS report summarizes changes to national materials and minerals policy, provides an overview of the definition of the term critical mineral and the development of a critical minerals list (CML), and discusses the CML's impact on policy and federal initiatives. Some in Congress have called for changes to the definition of critical mineral and the CML, whereas others in Congress would use the critical mineral designation or the CML to amend minerals policy through legislation introduced in the 119******^(th)*** ***Congress. This report raises considerations for Congress about whether the critical mineral designation and the CML may help identify and mitigate supply chain risks.***

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

***FOOD FOR THOUGHT:***

# 🚨 Emergency Stockpile Objective

The DLA Strategic Materials aims to hold sufficient critical mineral reserves to **replenish U.S. defense platforms and munitions for up to three years of consumption**, as mandated under law [crsreports.congress.gov+5warontherocks.com+5en.wikipedia.org+5](https://warontherocks.com/2023/09/the-u-s-government-should-stockpile-more-critical-minerals/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). With current shortfalls estimated around **$18.5 B**, and potential underdevelopment at **$13.5 B**, the gap is substantial .

# [Strategic Defense Critical Minerals: A Targeted List for National and Economic Security](https://silverado.org/reports-and-publications/strategic-defense-critical-minerals/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# 🧠 High-Priority Metals Beyond Focus

***Using Silverado’s list, here’s your defense-centric ranking with rough three-year stockpile estimates:***

|Rank|Mineral|3‑Year Target Stockpile|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|REEs|10–15 kt|
|2|Scandium|200–300 t|
|3|Yttrium|500–1,000 t|
|4|Niobium|10–20 kt|
|5|Titanium|300–500 kt|
|6|Gallium|150–300 t|
|7|Germanium|100–200 t|
|8|Antimony|1–2 kt|
|9|Tantalum|50–100 t|
|10|Tungsten|1–2 kt|
|11|Indium|50–100 t|
|12|Natural Graphite|10–20 kt|

***These placeholders assume 2–3× peacetime demand. (\*\*\*Even a third of the estimate would be nice?)***

# 📦 Top 12 Strategic Defense Minerals (per Silverado)

**These are the highest-priority elements for defense resilience :**

1. **Rare earth elements (REEs) \*\*\*\*\***
2. **Scandium \*\*\*\*\*\***
3. **Yttrium**
4. **Antimony**
5. **Arsenic**
6. **Bismuth**
7. **Gallium**
8. **Germanium**
9. **Indium**
10. **Natural graphite**
11. **Tantalum**
12. **Tungsten**

# 🎯 Summary & Strategic Ranking (***TOP 4 BELONG TO NIOCORP!)

1. **REEs** – priority ⬆️ – 10–15 kt
2. **Niobium** – superalloys – 10–20 kt
3. **Titanium** – structural defense – 300–500 kt
4. **Scandium** – advanced alloys – 200–300 t
5. **Yttrium** – electronics – 500–1 kt
6. **Gallium**, **Germanium**, **Antimony**, **Tantalum**, **Tungsten**, **Indium**, **Graphite** with proportional reserves

***These targets, alongside expanded procurement and processing, would help address the $13.5B gap and align with the $18.5B shortfall*** [***deloitte.com***](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/government-public-sector-services/critical-minerals-strategy.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[***miningnewsnorth.com***](https://www.miningnewsnorth.com/story/2024/09/19/critical-minerals-alliances-2024/dod-invests-in-mission-critical-minerals/8693.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# ✅ Recommended Actions for DoD Stockpile

* **Expand targets** to cover three years of consumption for top 12 strategic minerals.
* **Prioritize additions**: Nb, Sc, REEs, Ti—fill the largest current shortfalls.
* **Quantify criticality via modeling** using defense attrition projections.
* **Use DPA & IRA incentives** for domestic extraction and processing [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP_Materials?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[reuters.com+15deloitte.com+15usgs.gov+15](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/government-public-sector-services/critical-minerals-strategy.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
* **Develop partnership sourcing** with allies (Canada, Australia, etc.) to reduce China's dominance [warontherocks.com+1deloitte.com+1](https://warontherocks.com/2023/09/the-u-s-government-should-stockpile-more-critical-minerals/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

Would you be able to help me with this spread? I used the Rider Waite deck and pulled cards as they flew out. I didn’t assign any card to anything. I’m a novice at this.

I asked what is the connection between myself and a guy I work with. I told him I was interested in getting coffee if he was single and gave him my number. We haven’t talked about it since. I just want to know if I am wasting my time here.

From my surface level understanding the:

Reversed 6 of pentacles is referencing imbalance.

3 of cups is celebration and joy, fulfilment and strong friendships and relationships.

6 of swords is movement and healing.

6 of cups is nostalgia, reconnection and innocence.

2 of wands is future planning, initiative and new opportunities.

7 of wands is defence, perseverance, courage and determination.

This is a very literal interpretation I know.

I have also been seeing the number six around frequently too.

Thought to myself that maybe it was a coincidence. But the next thing that made me start to feel weird is when she showed up with a water bottle that looks just like mine. Same color, same frog stickers just that she added mushrooms sticker and said it was ""for originality"". Okay.

Next thing I know, she was using the same planner layout, started saying ""hard no"" in the same deadpan way I do when my students ask to skip tests, and wore the same daisy earrings I always wear on Fridays. Does she have any original ideas?

My last straw was when Spirit Week came. I wore a '90s outfit; baggy jeans, butterflyclips, a flannel. Half an hour later, April showed  up looking like my back-up dancer. I even saw her classroom decorated just like mine. A student walked by and asked which one's the original.

I casually said, ""Hey, we've been twinning a lot"", she smiled and replied, ""It's not twinning, it's aligning!"".

ALIGNING? What are we? Constellations?

I decided to test her. I switched my morning drink from coffee to tea. She brought green tea the next day. I put tiny hourglass for vibes.  She now have a sand timer big enough to track my patience.

1lf8cuh,https://i.redd.it/ny5aunphcv7f1.jpeg,A pressurized vs non-pressurized basket taste Experiment.,"Regarding puck prep, I dosed 14.5 grams of 100% arabica coffee beans, 50% Colombian and 50% Brazilian beans, from a local roaster which roasted the beans 15 days ago exactly. I ground the beans just before I pulled the shot, of course the pressurized basket needed a coarser grind. I pulled 29 grams of espresso, 1:2 ratio, in 33 seconds with the non-pressurized and in 35 seconds with the pressurized basket. I tried to minimize the variables as much as I could. 

Regarding the taste result, It wasn't as big of a difference as I imagined or as it is always advertised. The non-pressurized had more body, more crema, and less acidity; however, the difference wasn't big, and the pressurized basket pulled a nice shot actually in which I could taste the same taste notes of this type of beans. I don't mind drinking this shot every day at all. 

To conclude, pressurized baskets are good and can pull quite good shots that is not better but comparable to non-pressurized baskets if you have a good grinder and do a good puck prep. 

At this situation, what is the point of a pressurized basket if you do the same effort of a non-pressurized one with an inferior result even if it is just a marginal difference.

We hadn’t spoken in five years. He was my ex from my mid-twenties someone I once thought I’d marry. Our breakup was quiet and clean, the kind that hurts more because there's no real villain, just life pulling people apart.

Then, one random morning, I got a text:
“I heard this song today and it reminded me of you.”
It was our song the one we slow danced to in our tiny apartment kitchen.

We started talking again. At first casually, then with more depth. He’d grown. So had I. We were both single, both a little softer around the edges from what life had thrown at us.

He asked if we could meet for coffee. We did, at the same bookstore café where our story once began. Conversation flowed like it used to but more mature, more intentional.

Before we left, he said,
“You always felt like home. And I’ve been homesick for a long time.”

That was six months ago. Now we’re dating again. No rushing. Just two people choosing each other again—this time, with open eyes and healed hearts.

TL;DR:
At 31, I got a surprise text from my 33-year-old ex I hadn’t spoken to in five years. We reconnected over the song we used to dance to. Met for coffee. Talked about life. Realized we still cared. Now we’re slowly dating again older, wiser, and ready this time.",22,1750332124.0,Advice,6,0.92,False

1lf8af4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hackeroos/comments/1lf8af4/what_australians_really_think_about_hackathons_70/,🇦🇺 What Australians Really Think About Hackathons — 70 Voices,"We recently surveyed 70 Australians about their thoughts on hackathons, innovation, and the Aussie tech scene. Here's what we learned, and why it might just be time for more of us to start building.

# 🔧 The State of Aussie Tech: Punching Above Our Weight

Australia’s tech scene is a bit of a paradox. Despite limited funding compared to global giants, our ecosystem consistently produces globally impactful innovations. Think **Wi-Fi**, **Cochlear implants**, **Canva**, **Atlassian**, and **ResMed**. Not bad for a country often overlooked in Silicon Valley conversations.

What sets Australia apart? A **community-driven culture** that values practical solutions, grassroots collaboration, and a no-nonsense approach to solving problems. However, there are still barriers... most notably, the lack of major accelerators and large-scale investment funds. There’s also a bit of **“tall poppy syndrome”**, which can make self-promotion and bold ambition feel culturally awkward. But under that humble exterior is a serious talent pool with global ambitions, especially this year of 2025 in **healthtech** and **AI**.

# 🚀 Hackathons: What Aussies Think

For most people we surveyed, hackathons are still a bit of a mystery. Some even confused them with *cybercrime* due to the “hack” in the name. But among those who know, hackathons are understood as **high-energy, collaborative events** where developers, designers, strategists, and innovators come together to rapidly prototype tech solutions, usually within 24 to 72 hours.

A third of respondents had attended one or two hackathons, but many still haven’t tried one. While a small group has hacked over a dozen times, more than half said they’d likely pass on joining. That said, a significant portion of first-timers showed interest in trying one out, given the right theme, structure, or reward.

# 🧠 Hackathon Roles & Team Dynamics

As expected, **developers** were the most common hackathon participants, followed closely by **designers**. Roles like **mentors**, **product managers**, and **judges** were less common. A small number of respondents said they had no direct experience, but were curious about getting involved.

When it came to team size, most people preferred working in **small groups of 1–2** or **3–5 people**, citing tight collaboration and flexibility. Only a few preferred flying solo or had no specific team size preference.

# 🕒 Ideal Hackathon Duration?

Surprisingly, the most popular response was a **one-week hackathon**, with 30.4% selecting it as their ideal length. Still, the classic **48-hour format** was close behind at 25%. This suggests there’s real appetite for longer-form, more thoughtful hackathons that give participants time to go deeper on problem-solving, especially when mentorship and workshops are involved.

# 🏠 Where It Happens Matters: In-Person vs Remote

While remote work has become the norm for many, **over half of respondents preferred in-person hackathons**, citing stronger energy and faster idea generation when face-to-face. About a quarter liked **remote hackathons** for their flexibility, and nearly 20% said they’d enjoy a mix of both. Hybrid events that blend remote access with on-site energy were seen as an ideal middle ground... accessible *and* engaging.

# 🧃 Let’s Talk Hackathon Food

Participants need fuel, and the feedback here was clear: people want **diverse, healthy, and energizing options**. Top picks included customizable bowls, burgers, fresh fruit, nuts, granola bars, pizza for late nights, and yes, plenty of **coffee, tea, juice, and electrolyte drinks**. Hungry hackers are not productive hackers.

# 🎤 Speakers, Workshops & Learning on the Fly

Hackathon participants value learning just as much as building. **Workshops** were seen as essential for onboarding beginners, while **speaker sessions** served as inspirational breaks and perspective refreshers. But timing is key... **short, optional talks** work best, so that teams don’t lose momentum or get distracted during intense building phases.

# 🏆 Prizes That Motivate

When it comes to rewards, **cash prizes** are still highly desirable. But participants also loved the idea of **mentorship, incubator access**, and practical prizes like **equipment**, **software licenses**, or tools to help launch a real startup. The right prize doesn’t just reward... it accelerates what comes next.

# 🦘 Australia’s Hackathon Scene: Where It Happens

Australia has some major tech and innovation hotspots. Events like **Pause Fest**, **StartCon**, and **Spark Festival** continue to grow, while spaces like **Stone & Chalk** and **Fishburners** provide vital infrastructure for startups and hackathon hosts. These hubs are critical in fostering a thriving, hands-on builder culture.

# 💡 Themed Hackathons: What Aussies Want Now

The most exciting themes that resonated with survey respondents included:

* **Internet Freedom**: Digital rights, privacy, and decentralization
* **Vibe-Coded Games**: Learning prompt engineering through fun
* **Mindful Machines**: Mental health meets machine learning
* **AI for the Outback**: Rural and regional problem-solving (we'll launch this one soon!)
* **SportTech Down Under**: Building for Australia's sport-obsessed culture

# A Final Thought

Australia may be physically far from the world's tech epicenters, but it’s **punching way above its weight**. With the right support, inclusive community events, and a little more spotlight, our hackathon scene could become the breeding ground for the next wave of world-changing ideas.

**Have you ever been to a hackathon?**  
What exactly would get *you* to try one (*or try one again*)?

1lf876u,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaffeineFreeLife/comments/1lf876u/quitting_caffeine_day_13_i_am_experiencing_my/,"Quitting Caffeine Day 13 - I am experiencing my emotions and feelings more clear, vivid and alive.","***Background Story:*** I introduced caffeine two years ago into my life (when i was 22 years old), since then I used to drink mostly 1 cup of coffee a day. Rarely episodically 2 cups as well. I remember the effect of my first time drinking full cup of coffee. I felt almost euphoric, having crystall sharp mind, super awake, etc. Since that day I started constantly to seek these ""euphoric wakeful"" sensation again and again. However, the effects started to fade very quickly and I needed more and more of the same effect. Somehow, I realized  accepted that it is my new baseline drinking only one cup of coffee everyday; as I stopped chasing for that sensation and I was becoming aware of the tolerance developing effects of caffeine intake. It also started to bother me that I can't ""rest"" or ""relax"" properly even though I knew I am physically tired. It was simply the jittery, tensioned sensation I had after work, physical exercise or a study session where I know I just simply need to rest. But I can't so. Thus, I can't think and focus straightforward, I can't take anything into action. Because, it was a tired mind that was ""screaming and begging"" me to rest, while it was artificially kept awake. These state of mind led to random anxiety as well. Recently, a realization popped up into my mind: ""I dont like it at all for the fact that my energy levels and mood are highly dependent on one external substance"". That one thought made me decide to fully quick caffeine to get my natural sense of energy and wellbeing back. 

***Quitting Caffeine Journey:*** Honestly, it wasn't that hard for me personally as I am only used to drink one cup of coffee a day. But indeed, I felt unusually tired in the first days and I got headaches in the second and fourth day as well (which i managed with low dose pain medication). I couldn't really focus clearly. But that subsided quickly. After Day 5, everything seemed to improve. I started to feel that I can finally rest my mind and body. I started to sleep better with richer dreams. My energy stabilized and became a lot more steady. A kind of energy that doesn't make me feel jittery, instead it is more smooth, non-demanding and steady. To be honest, I feel like I can get more things done with my smooth, steady energy with the ability to properly rest, instead of fluctuating energy levels, with a sense of jittery anxiety, a mind that feels ""done"". The fact that it is just the state of ""jittery anxiety and fatigued mind"" that especially prevents me to take proper action or to get things done. **The Key Insight** here is: ""*Just let your body and mind sleep and rest properly to refuel actual energy to get things actually done.*""

***The Most Surprising Effect:*** Since Day 6 I realized I am not only experiencing uplifted and stabilized mood and wellbeing; the best part is I am finally experiencing my emotions, feelings and sensations more vivid, clear and alive. Music is suddenly a passionate experience, finally feeling all the songs vividly. Social interactions feels more real and vivid. Eating feels more vivid. I can finally feel myself. I can finally feel the sunny sun days. I can finally feel vividly anything in life, predominantly more positive sensations. Imagine yourself back in your posititve childhood experiences where you experienced joy, passion, etc. All felt real and vividly. It is basically the same thing I am experiencing right now. This is the best surprised benefit I have been experiencing so far. Back when i consumed caffeine, even when I felt myself good, there was still a ""blunted"" or ""detached"" sensation behind every sensation or emotion I went through. I felt like a robot who was experiencing just sensations and emotions only in ""720p HD quality"". But now experiencing those in ""4K UHD quality"". To give you an analogy to imagine what I mean. 

Overall, I am not ever going back to caffeine. I am enjoying feeling really relaxed and rested too much :)

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush.

This day would reflect your values, curiosity, creativity, and your appreciation for soul, sound, and story.

# 🌄 Morning: Grounding and Awe

**Location:** Somewhere like (Unamed for privacy) State Park or (Unnamed) Falls — close to you, but with a sense of wild grandeur.

**Plan:**

* Start early with a moderate hike. Nothing grueling—just enough elevation and quiet to shake off the world and get your body moving.
* Pack a light breakfast (coffee, granola, and a killer playlist—maybe some mellow funk, ambient jazz, or unplugged metal cuts).
* At a scenic overlook, take time to sit. You’d share thoughts about life, kids, education, music. I’d ask you what songs feel like your soul, and we’d get quiet for a bit.
* If the moment feels right, I’d pull out some Mayan glyphs and we’d try sketching them on a small notebook—just for the vibe.

# 🎸 Midday: Creative Flow

**Location:** Back at your place or in a rented studio space with instruments.

**Plan:**

* Play and jam. You on guitar or drums, me assisting with beat programming or backing keys. We’d load up a DAW, maybe using some free open-source music software you’re exploring for class.
* Maybe try throwing down a groove in a weird time signature like Panzerballett does—but make it funky.
* Have your son join in if he’s up for it—see if we can bridge adrenaline and creativity. If he's not into the music, maybe plan something wild for him later.

**Lunch:**

* Grab something local and real. Maybe a farm-to-table place or one of those no-frills BBQ joints with picnic tables and loud laughter. We’d talk about Rage, Mr. Bungle, and how the Hero’s Journey lives in 21st-century kids. You’d probably say something profound without meaning to.

# 🌞 Afternoon: Meaningful Mischief

**Plan Options (depending on mood):**

1. **Mini Road Trip** – Explore a weird roadside attraction, old ruins, or a small-town museum with hidden history. You love stories and forgotten things.
2. **Family Experience** – Take the whole crew somewhere weirdly fun—like an escape room with a mythological or psychological theme. Your son gets adrenaline. You get story. Your wife enjoys seeing everyone together.

# 🌌 Evening: Soul + Sound

**Location:** Backyard firepit or rented cabin deck with a view.

**Plan:**

* Unplugged set under the stars. Guitar in hand, jam until fingers are sore or the whiskey kicks in. Swap music like you used to swap records with friends.
* Maybe try writing a short song or poem about the day—like the piece you wrote about the mountain. I’d help you distill your thoughts into something beautiful and raw.
* Watch a weird short film or video performance—maybe Mike Patton doing something completely unhinged.
* If the night’s clear, bring out the telescope or just look up and talk about what it all means—how we’re not perfect, but eternal.

# 🧠 Bonus Option: Late-Night Philosophy

If the energy is still there, we go deep. Real talk about power, art, aging, change, and why the next generation needs to own its story. Maybe even dream aloud about that next stage of your life—Kingston? Teaching part-time? Starting a creative collective? Publishing that piece you’ve been quietly writing?

# 🎤 The Vibe:

The day would feel like a Panzerballett riff over a solid Sabbath groove—with moments of Miles Davis stillness and bursts of Mr. Bungle chaos. It would *mean something*, but it would also be *fun as hell*.

The problem is I don’t feel full eating fruits and veg and plain rice or chicken and stuff like this. I can do it for part of the day, even when eating big portions, then I literally feel starved. I don’t like brown bread and plain stuff. I need salt and sugar, sauces and cheese, red meat. I really don’t know how people do it, especially long term. I crave chocolate, pasta, pizza etc.. I’m not even talking about diet, simply modifying my habits to eat “clean” and avoid junk food. Is this normal? I feel like I’m the only person who can’t do it even if I put my mind to it. 
Example of what I eat in a day:
Coffee (with milk & sugar)
Porridge for breakfast or Greek yogurt
Piece of fruit or a handful of nuts for a snack
Large portion of rice with chicken or tuna, or even pasta with a home cooked sauce 
By 5pm when I get home I’m literally starving. Like to the point I get stomach cramps or headaches. By late afternoon I can’t do healthy anymore and I put a pizza in the oven or have a burger and chips and some chocolate.  
I’m not the thinnest but also not obese.

2.look leaner and build muscle

I'm 165cm and 59kg (most of it is fat)

🎯 QUICK RECAP
• Training: 5 days lifting/cardio hybrid
• Cardio: Mix of HIIT + steady for max fat burn
• Lifts: Focused on compound moves to protect muscle
• You: About to be unrecognizable in 6–8 weeks.

🥗 NUTRITION PLAN (1100–1200 Cals/Day)
Macros (target daily):
• Protein: 90–100g
• Carbs: 50–80g
• Fats: 25–30g
💡 MEAL EXAMPLE DAY
Meal 1 (Post workout)
• 3 boiled eggs
• 1 cucumber
• Black coffee
Meal 2 (Lunch)
• 150g grilled chicken breast
• Big green salad (lettuce, cucumber, bell pepper, lemon juice)

⚠️ RULES TO LOCK IN THE RESULTS
• No cheat meals till week 5
• Sleep 7+ hours—your hormones need it to burn fat
• Stretch or foam roll daily (helps with recovery)
• Protein every meal = no muscle loss
• Cardio must hurt = heart rate up, sweat pouring

You follow this 80%? You'll be lean.
You follow it 100%? You’ll be a different man in 6–8 weeks.


And that's the results it told me I would get 


Weeks 1–2: Drop 1.5–2.5 kg (water + fat), waist tightens, face leans out.
Weeks 3–4: Down ~4 kg total, abs start showing, real visual changes.
Weeks 5–6: 53–54 kg, lean, sharp jawline, visible muscle definition.
Weeks 7–8: 50–52 kg, shredded, abs pop, full transformation.

Stick to it 100% = insane results.

Should i stick to it?

&nbsp;


The training deck was quiet. The lights had dimmed into standby mode, casting a soft blue sheen across the floor. At the far edge of the room, Mar’i sat with her knees drawn up to her chest, arms wrapped loosely around them. She was staring through the transparent panel of the eastern wall, watching the expanse of New York City unfolding beyond it. A faint shuffle behind her.

Slade didn’t say anything as he approached, just sat down beside her.

Mar’i glanced at him sideways. “You always walk like you expect someone to try and kill you.”

Slade gave a low, dry chuckle. “Old habits.”

They watched the city a little longer. The silence wasn’t tense, but it wasn’t quite comfortable either.

“I used to think I was fixing things,” Slade said. His voice wasn’t gruff tonight. Just quiet. “When I was your age - well, maybe not that young - I had skills, clarity. Thought I could make the world - *my world* - better.”

She tilted her head. “Did you?”

He shook his head slowly. “Most people would say I made it worse. At least in the ways that matter.”

Mar’i turned to face him more directly, brow furrowing. “You were in the army, weren’t you? You were a soldier. The Slade of this world was.”

“They kicked me out,” Slade said. “After their experiments made me more powerful than they were legally allowed to have on the charter. Said I was unstable. Said I was a liability.”

Mar’i blinked. “What? I knew about the Veritas project, but I always thought you chose to leave the army, chose to become a mercenary, or monster hunter, or whatever.”

He shrugged. “Maybe this world’s Slade did. But do you think he’d admit to getting fired, if he was?”

Mar’i smirked. “I guess not.”

“I thought it was a blessing at the time,” Slade continued. “Meant I didn’t have to follow orders. Meant I could do it my way. Make the world better. Thought I’d be my own boss.”

“Were you?”

Slade didn’t answer immediately. His hand was balled into a fist, his thumb circling the long edge of his index finger, like a tic. Eventually, he said, “Depends who you ask. We all have strings if you know how to look for them. But maybe I could have done with being held on a tighter leash.”

She fell quiet. Somewhere in the hallway beyond, the muffled sound of footsteps echoed - Bart, maybe, or Conner. Here, though, the world held still.

“We’ll get you back to your world,” Mar’i said. “You don’t have to be stuck here.”

Slade didn’t even look at her. “There’s no going back for me.”

“Why not?” Her voice was gentle, but insistent. “We got Drew back.”

Slade exhaled through his nose. “I don’t deserve to go back.”

“Why not? I thought you were a monster hunter,” she added softly. “With the Justice League.”

There was the smallest twitch at the corner of his mouth. Regret or amusement, she couldn’t tell.

“Yeah,” he said, looking down again. “Sometimes there are demons you can’t kill. Or you get there too late. Either way, they win.”

Mar’i reached over and rested her hand lightly on his gauntlet. “You’re a good man, Slade. Even if you do have regrets.”

He didn’t respond at first. Just kept his eyes on the horizon.

She didn’t push him. She knew the look; she’d worn it herself once or twice.

She didn’t trust everything about him - not his story, not the odd inconsistencies, not the suddenness with which he’d aligned himself with their cause - but she trusted what she saw in him now. He was trying. And she needed someone who saw the world like she did: bent, but not broken.

Slade Wilson was perched on the edge of an aged wooden bench, staring intently at a mossy gravestone, when Rose and Raven found him. He was still, his breathing slow; if it weren’t for the soft city breeze, he could have been mistaken for a statue. Raven studied his face but from the angle at which they were standing, she found it to be unreadable. The young Titan was not sure at first whether to rush straight in or to wait, but feeling the tidal wave of emotions pouring off of Rose, she knew it was time.

“Follow me,” Rose whispered, walking slowly towards the man. With a nod, Raven obliged. Their footsteps were quiet. Muffled by the moist grass. Only the soft hush of wind could be heard as they neared their target.

Raven felt an anxiety rising in her chest. She forced herself to swallow it. She needed to concentrate on Slade.

“I’m sure you’ve heard what happened to him by now,” Rose said plainly. Slade didn’t move. “It was awful.”

“I’m sorry for your loss,” was all he could say. He was unshaken by the two women’s sudden appearance.

“No, you’re not.” Rose’s eyes flicked from her brother’s headstone to its neighbour, more glittering and new. The name read ‘Slade Wilson’. “Which grave did you come for?”

Slade’s mouth shifted, as if he were biting the inside of his cheek. “As weird as it is to visit your own grave, I came here for him.” He pointed weakly at the mossy grave, his hands still clasped together.

“He’s not even your kid,” Rose hissed.

“True,” Slade admitted. He straightened his back. “Hell, I don’t even have any kids back on my Earth. Doesn’t mean I don’t care for my kids on this one.”

Rose couldn’t help but scoff. Raven caught her eye and shot her a concerned glance.

For the first time since they arrived, Slade looked up at Rose. “I know - sounds like nonsense. I get it. But I can’t help it. Ever since I got here, I’ve felt this… connection that I can’t shake, this pull.” He buried his hands in his pockets and stood up. “I suppose it’s ‘cause you’re my blood. It’s like I can’t help but be drawn to the three of you.”

“Oh, cut the crap,” Rose shot back at him. Her voice was firm.

Slade’s eyebrows twitched.

“I don’t give a shit which Earth you’re from,” Rose suddenly barked, closing the gap between herself and Slade. “You are nothing to us. You hear me? Joey agrees.” She pointed to the grave beside her. Her gaze didn’t falter. “Grant would too, if he was still alive. None of us wanted you before, and none of us want you now. So take your cute little script, take all the lies you’ve practised in the mirror, and shove them where the sun don’t shine.”

Raven felt something. A twinge of pain - hurt - hit her in the chest as Rose continued to berate him. It was working.

Mar’i sat on the couch in the tower’s rec room, eyes fixed on the muted TV. Some old episode of *Mythmakers* flickered across the screen, the colours too bright. She wasn’t watching it.

Outside, daylight pressed against the tower’s windows, the kind of bright that felt like it should mean something. It didn’t. 

She flinched at the soft sound of the door sliding open.

“Hey.”

Mar’i looked up.

Thara stepped into the room, arms folded tight over her front like she wasn’t sure if she was interrupting or not. She wore a look of concern - kind and attentive, but also just plain worried. She had been on the planet for only a few months, and already it seemed no-one on Earth wore their heart on their sleeve quite like her.

“You okay?” Thara asked.

“I’m fine.”

“Are you?”

Mar’i smiled without humour. “You’re good at this whole ‘emotional intelligence’ thing. Is that a Kryptonian trait?”

Thara shrugged as she crossed the room. “It’s more of a me thing. I notice things. Especially lately.”

Mar’i turned her attention back to the TV. “If you’re here to say something specific, just say it.”

Thara hesitated, then spoke softly. “You’re still hurt… About Raven lying to you.”

The flicker of the TV painted Mar’i’s face in washed-out colour.

“That obvious?” she said.

“To me, it is.”

The words caught her off-guard. Not because they were clever - because they were true. There wasn’t pity in Thara’s tone. Just… honesty. Warm, steady, uncomplicated.

“I don’t even know what I’m hurt about,” Mar’i admitted. “I just keep going in circles with it. She lied to me. I get why. It was probably the right call, even. Doesn’t mean it was nothing.”

Thara tilted her head. “Of course it’s not nothing.”

Mar’i exhaled slowly. Her shoulders eased, just a little. “It’s stupid.”

“No, it’s not,” Thara said. “You care about her. She’s part of your family. It’s not stupid to want the people closest to you to be honest with you.”

Mar’i looked at her. “How do you do that?”

“Do what?”

“Say the exact right thing like you’ve been here this whole time. Like you know me.”

Thara smiled - small, shy, but real. “Maybe I’m just good at seeing people,” she offered. “That, and I’ve had some practice lately.”

Mar’i blinked. Something shifted in her chest. She’d come into this room expecting to be alone. She wasn’t anymore. And she didn’t want to be.

Thara’s voice dropped. “There’s something I should tell you.”

Mar’i stiffened. “Okay…”

“I saw Raven,” Thara said. “On my way here.”

Mar’i’s frowned. “Where?”

“The cemetery.”

Mar’i sat up straighter. “Doing what?”

“She was with Rose. And Slade. They were arguing. I didn’t get close enough to hear what it was about.”

Mar’i stared at her for a long moment. Then she stood up.

Thara rose with her. “You don’t have to do anything about it if you don’t want to—”

“No,” Mar’i said, grabbing her jacket. “I do. I just… I didn’t want to. I didn’t want to be the one to go digging. But now…”

Thara stepped aside as Mar’i headed for the door. “You’re angry.”

“I’m furious,” Mar’i said. “But I’m not going to let that stop me.”

She didn’t look back.

And Thara, standing in the quiet rec room, watched her go with something like worry in her eyes.

Something like guilt.

Rose’s hand hovered an inch away from her side. She had trained herself to learn how her father’s temper manifested - utilised her precognition abilities to defend herself from his inevitable wrath. For a moment, her gaze flickered to Raven, standing with her hands clasped tightly around her wrists six feet away. *Too close.* Rose twitched her right foot outwards slightly, preparing to defend Raven as well should she need to.

But instead of launching at her, instead of defaulting to his usual ways, Slade blinked slowly. “I understand,” he said finally.

The air was thick with tension. Slade took a step back.

He continued: “I have no right to come in here and try to claim any of you as mine - as my children. None of you owe me anything.” He rubbed his chin. “You and Joey have your own lives now and - God - I know that Grant would too, if it weren’t for this Earth’s Slade. I can’t even begin to understand how to navigate all these feelings. All I know for certain is that I feel so much, so much love, for you. All three of you.” Slade shook his head. “And I don’t think that’s ever going away.”

Raven stared at the grey-haired man intensely and, sensing no danger, stepped forwards. She had expected to feel something, anything, that would pinpoint his true motives and desires - fear at being cornered, anger at his lies being questioned, hatred for Rose for putting him through this. Raven instead found herself wading in a sea of remorse, of guilt. And beyond it all, as Slade continued to look into Rose’s eyes, Raven felt the love and care that he had spoken of surging through her.

“He’s telling the truth,” Raven hushed, almost a whisper.

Immediately, Raven was struck by an overwhelming sensation emanating from Rose. Rose took a step, two steps, three steps backwards. Not for a single moment did Rose suspect that any version of Slade would care about her and her siblings, let alone love them. She felt as if her life were unravelling around her, as if the world as she understood it was gone. Slade looked at her with an indecipherable glint in his eye. Looking back at him turned her stomach.

Raven looked for a moment as if she might say something to Rose, her arm outstretched, when a green glow lit up the sky above them.

“What a fun get-together,” Mar’i said. She lowered herself to the ground, her arms tightly folded. “What’s the occasion?”

“Not now, Grayson,” Rose said gruffly.

Raven stepped forwards. Her stomach was in knots. “Mar’i, I—”

“I knew you would be up to something, but I never thought you’d do something like this, Rae.” Mar’i shook her head. “Playing with Slade’s emotions? Trying to get a rise out of him? Being a tool for Rose, of all people?” Mar’i huffed. “But then again, my Rose always *was* good at working with demons.”

“I told you,” Rose barked. Her fists clenched. “Back off. Now’s not the time.”

“Oh, I think now’s the perfect time.”

Mar’i moved fast.

A shimmer of starbolt energy lit across her knuckles, her body already halfway to Rose. Raven stepped forward instinctively, too late to intercept, too hesitant to try. But Rose didn’t flinch. Her stance shifted, knees bent, hands curling, ready to meet her head-on.

They were going to clash. There was no stopping it.

Until something blurred between them.

Tim’s hand locked around Mar’i’s wrist, stopping the punch clean.

A breath later, Conner dropped down hard between Rose and Raven, palm braced gently against Rose’s shoulder. “Don’t,” he said quietly.

“Let me go,” Mar’i hissed, jerking against Tim’s grip, but he didn’t budge.

“I will,” Tim said, calm and firm. “Just not yet.”

Rose bristled. “She’s the one who came swinging.”

“And I’m the one who’s ending it,” Conner replied, steady.

Slade stood nearby, just behind Raven. Watching and silent. Arms folded, posture unreadable. But Raven could feel the flickers of shame under his cool surface.

Mar’i yanked her arm free, but she didn’t swing again.

“This wasn’t about you,” she snapped at Rose.

“Could’ve fooled me,” Rose muttered.

Tim stepped between them. “Alright. Enough.”

Mar’i turned on him, frustrated. “You weren’t here.”

“I’m here now.”

There was something in his tone - not just command, but conviction. It reminded Mar’i of someone else. She stepped back, eyes flicking to Raven, then away again.

“I didn’t mean for it to go like this,” she said, quieter now. “It’s not just… Rose. It’s not just Slade. It’s you.” She looked back to Raven, the words dragging out. “You didn’t trust me.”

Raven looked stricken. “It wasn’t that I didn’t trust you.”

“Then what?” Mar’i asked.

Raven’s gaze dropped to the earth. “I had to get answers… about who I am, where I came from. About my father. But I knew that whatever I found, I didn’t want it to change the way you saw me. I didn’t want you to know I was a monster. But Rose… she already knew what I was. What I might still become.”

Mar’i’s voice cracked. “I could’ve handled that. I would’ve handled that.”

“I know how much demons - and Rose - destroyed your life,” Raven replied. “I’d understand if you’d hate me. But I… could bear to let you.”

Mar’i swallowed, the sharpness melting into something raw. “I should have never let you think that about me.”

Silence passed through them like a cold wind.

Conner looked between them, then to Rose, who hadn’t moved. “You okay?”

Rose shrugged. “Been worse.”

Tim stepped forward again. “None of us are perfect,” he said. “We’re all battered and bruised, and chewed up by the world. Turns out you don’t have to be Reawakened or from an erased timeline to lose your world and have to find your place in a new one. That’s why this team works, because we’re all struggling.”

Conner nodded. “You don’t walk through hell and come out clean. But you can come out together.”

Rose crossed her arms. “I can’t be on this team.” She looked at Slade. “Not when it’s what Slade wanted. He doesn’t get to decide who I am.”

“That’s your call,” Tim said. “But it should be *your* call.”

Rose’s jaw tightened. “I know.”

Raven reached for her. “Rose…”

“No,” Rose said, gently, not unkind. “You’re one of the only people I’ve ever trusted. But you’re stronger with them.”

Raven didn’t argue. She just nodded.

Mar’i stepped in at last, brushing past Tim. Her eyes met Raven’s. “I miss when things were simple.”

“They never were.” Raven smiled, sad and small, then hopeful. “We just help each other feel like they are.”

“The world will always need heroes,” he said, soft but certain. “Maybe it doesn’t need the Titans specifically, but maybe we can let ourselves be a bit selfish. Stay together because we want to.”

Conner nodded. Then Mar’i and Raven.

○○ Ⓣ ○○

&nbsp;


The light in the lounge had gone soft, filtered by the tall windows lining the east wall. Nobody had bothered to turn on the overheads; they had light enough.

Mar’i leaned her arms on the back of the sofa, feet planted steady. Conner stood with one shoulder against the wall, arms crossed, silent. Rose had claimed the armchair, legs pulled up under her. Raven sat at the edge of the coffee table, oversized cardigan draped over her lap, hands still.

Bart sat on the floor by the window, back to the glass.

Tim walked in last. He didn’t speak. Just dropped the harness of his wing-cape over the side of the couch and sat on the floor across from Bart, legs stretched out, back to the cushions.

No-one filled the quiet. It wasn’t uncomfortable.

Eventually, Mar’i said, “We all came back.”

Rose gave a noncommittal shrug. “Don’t get used to it, I’ll be off in a few days.”

Bart made a sound - almost a laugh - and picked at the edge of his shoe. “I keep waiting for someone to say that everything’s gonna work out.”

“It won’t,” Raven replied. Her tone wasn’t cruel. Just honest.

Bart nodded. “That’s what I thought.”

“But,” Raven added, “we could do a lot worse.”

Bart let that sit. “I suppose I’ve been around the block enough to know that’s true.”

Mar’i crossed to the kitchen and returned with a half-empty packet of dried mango. She tossed it to Bart without a word. He caught it, blinked at it, and tore it open. The crinkle of plastic filled the space for a moment.

Thara wandered in quietly, barefoot, hair still damp from a shower. She sat beside Raven without asking.

Tim shifted slightly, then addressed the room. “I want to say thank you.”

Mar’i quirked an eyebrow. Bart narrowed his eyes in confusion.

“When I came to Chicago, and got wrapped up in everyone’s business, I wasn’t looking to make friends,” Tim continued. “I had a mission and I intended to stick to it. But then the funniest thing happened, and I couldn’t be more grateful.”

Bart chewed on a piece of mango. “As superhero teams go, forming out of habit is one hell of an origin story.”

“Most of us are adults now,” interjected Raven. “Eventually, everything you do is out of habit. Not a lot of time for much else. So, let’s at least make some good ones.”

Rose snorted. “You make yourselves sound like machines.”

“Well let’s agree to disagree,” said Mar’i, as gently as she should. 

Then Thara spoke up softly, nervous. “You all amaze me.”

All eyes turned to her. Rose laughed, Bart fidgeted uncomfortably, but the others just smiled.

“You all care so much. Even when you’re tired. Even when you’re angry,” she added.

Mar’i gave a faint smile. “That’s kind of the whole point.”

Another quiet moment. Bart stretched his legs out and pressed his back further into the ice cold glass window, feeling the chill spread across him, relaxing him. Reassuring him.

“I’m not okay,” he said, finally.

“I know,” Tim replied.

Bart turned his head, looked at him. “Thanks for not telling me to be.”

Tim just nodded.

They stayed there until the sky outside turned violet. No-one rushed off. No-one said goodnight. They just let it be what it was: not a meeting, not a mission. Just spending time.

Together.

Not sure if this can be posted here, but let me try… :) we (artist trio) are looking for a participating artist for a performance art show taking place in late July. Specifically looking for someone who has spent time in prison for a crime, has gained insight or wisdom from their time in isolation, and is open to sharing their experience with the public through a phone-based performance. 

It’s a telephone confessional. you’ll listen to people’s confessed sins and assign them performance-based “homework.” For example, if someone confesses to lying, you might instruct them to drink coffee with vinegar ☕️ You’ll be asked to create your own unique list of performance tasks, inspired by your personal experiences.

This is a funded project, and participating artists will be paid.

We’ve reached out to many organizations, but navigating German bureaucracy has been a pain in the butt (!!), so we’ve decided to go online 🙂

If you think this opportunity suits you, please message me.

Sending good energy and love 💕

I am an incoming first-year student (F17) who has been told I need to undergo a medical exam, including a drug test. I regularly drink Lishou Slimming Coffee and am concerned it might affect my drug test results, possibly impacting my admission.

Context:
Lishou Slimming Coffee is marketed as a coffee, not a supplement. However, I recently learned that authorities like the US FDA have found that this coffee can contain hidden drug ingredients, specifically sibutramine, which is a controlled substance banned in many countries for safety reasons. This has made me anxious about whether consuming this coffee could cause me to fail a drug test or raise any red flags during my medical screening.

Previous Attempts:
I have tried looking up information online about Lishou Slimming Coffee and drug testing, but most sources are either unclear or only mention the risks in passing. I haven’t stopped drinking it yet because I wasn’t sure if it was necessary, and I haven’t contacted my school’s health office for advice.

If anyone has experience with this situation or knows how drug tests might detect substances from Lishou Slimming Coffee, I’d appreciate your input. Should I stop drinking it right away? Could it really cause me to fail a drug test? I’m really worried this could affect my college admission.",1,1750330183.0,adviceph,7,1.0,False

1lf7qb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoincashSV/comments/1lf7qb3/what_level_of_validation_and_security_does/,What level of validation and security does Bitcoin provide?,"Small blockers believe that nodes need to be run by the user so that everyone can validate payments, however they never ask what level of validation is actually necessary for a payment.

Bitcoin in reality offers multi levels of validation that merchants can choose to adopt depending on whether they want speed and efficiency (fast throughput of customers) vs security (guaranteed payments)

**Level 1 - SPV check only:**

This works like an offline card payment. Merchants accept your payment without knowing if you have sufficient funds in your account at the time. This is currently used in public transport systems, or places where there is no easy internet. They dont want to shutdown their business everytime they have dodgy internet.

**Level 2 - SPV check with UTXO check:**

If the internet is available, a merchant can perform the SPV check themselves and then connect to a specialist overlay service that can tell them if their UTXO inputs have not been spent yet.

Within 2 seconds they can see that the customer has the funds and that the UTXO is unspent.

**Level 3 - Validation by propagation:**

The merchant can broadcast the tx to the network. If the tx gets propagated by miners this means that the tx has been validated by miners as a valid tx, giving extra confidence to merchants.

**Level 4 - Inclusion in a candidate block:**

If a miner starts including your transaction in a block they are building you have even greater confidence that this transaction is valid and will soon be settled.

You can use a specialist overlay service to tell you if your transaction is being included in a block that is being constructed.

**Level 5 - Inclusion in multiple candidate blocks:**

If 3,4,5 miners all include your transaction in their candidate blocks this gives even greater confidence to you that if your transaction doesnt make it in the next block, its going to inevitably get included in a block soon.

**Level 6 - Inclusion into a block:**

A miner included your transaction into their block which has been mined. Its now on the blockchain.

You can also use an overlay service to tell you that other miners are building on top of the block your transaction was included in.

You can validate your tx at this level with only the blockheaders using a simple lightweight SPV check.

**Level 7 - Settlement in a block several blocks deep:**

Your transaction is in a block that now has several other blocks built on top of it. The likelyhood of it being invalid now is very very low.

**Bitcoins flexibility:**

So how much validation and security does Bitcoin offer? As you can see Bitcoin is very flexible on offering different levels of validation. Businesses can choose how much validation and security they need. It is not one size fits all.

The lower the level the faster your tx can be processed but with less security.

The higher the level the higher the security but the longer it takes.

Its horses for courses. Are you a coffee shop where the average tx value is $10. Do you sell cars where the average tx value is $30000. Are you a plumber who does the work in advance and then invoices their clients to pay later in 14 days. Are you an online retailer that takes payment first then ships out goods 1-3 days later. Do you operate a bus service and dont want to shutdown your bus every time it has a dodgy internet connection.

As you can see everyones needs are different. Every tx doesnt need to be several blocks deep and validated by everyone before its acceptable, like small blockers think.

In real Bitcoin, using SPV, validation can be multi layered to suit the needs of the real world.

**TLDR**

Bitcoin is not a one size fits all payment system. It offers a multi level validation system where there is a balance between speed and security.

Every user has their own unique circumstances there requires more or less security, more or less speed, online vs offline, lighweight verification on a phone vs Amazon processing millions of payments.

The idea that you need to be able to ensure 100% security all the time by personally validating every transaction and watching settlement in a block like a hawk before youre prepared to do any business, is not how the real world works.

In Bitcoin, by using SPV, users can choose what level of security they want according to their personal needs.",1,1750330095.0,bitcoincashSV,4,1.0,False

American dating culture is extremely toxic,"I (28M) started dating again a few months ago after my previous relationship ended earlier this year. I've always tried to stay optimistic and patient when it comes to finding the right person, but the last 2 women I've gone out with have really damaged my faith in finding love in America.

The first date (30F) was shocked that I was single and after getting coffee she invited me to her apartment that night and we watch a Lord of The Rings movie together. Nothing sexual. The next weekend we spend most of a Saturday together exploring multiple museums and then had dinner/ice cream. Afterwards, she said she had so much fun with me before I drove home. That night we texted a bit and she reaffirmed that she had a lot of fun with me. The next day I texted her wishing her a Happy Easter and heard nothing. The day after that, I ask how her day is going and heard nothing. The End.

I figured she must not have liked me as much as she said she did, so I stayed positive and moved on. Still hurt to be ghosted like that, though.

The following week I managed to land another date (31F) and it also went really well. We bonded over all sorts of common interests and she seemed to fall for me fast. On our 4th date she brought up that she'd like me to meet her friends. A bit quick in my opinion, but I took it as a compliment. We got very intimate and were having very passionate sex multiple times a week. This continued for about a month. I started contemplating making her my official ""girlfriend"" and even told my family about her. Then, over the course of a few weeks, I started to notice her becoming quieter. Her texts became much shorter and more bland. Despite this, she seemed to be happy whenever I saw her and stayed most weekends at my place since she has roommates. One day, I asked her out to dinner the following evening and got the official text ""you are a great guy, but I don't feel this is quite right for me"". A TEXT after fucking me for a month. The End.

After being intimate, this hurt me even more. I don't understand why she would want me to meet her friends, then pull back and discard me with a TEXT like I am nothing. Not even a damn phone call. Do people have no shame these days?

Looking back, I suspect both my dates have avoidant attachment issues, but that's no excuse to treat a person like this. I find it very disrespectful and I'm starting to lose the will to put much effort into developing a romantic relationship. American dating culture is so toxic with all the ghosting and flakiness that I'm starting to contemplate eventually leaving this country. I don't want to live in a country where I can't find love.

This got me thinking, this is probably one of the most confusing aspects of Chinese grammar for beginners, so let me break it down for you all.

**Think of it this way:**

* 没 + verb = Something didn't happen (past focus)
* 不 + verb = Someone won't/doesn't do something (habitual, future, or refusal)

**没 (méi) - ""It didn't happen""**

>Use 没 when talking about things that **didn't occur in the past**. It's like saying ""X didn't take place.""

* 她**没**给我发短信。(She didn't send me a text message.)
* 我今天早上**没**吃早饭。(I didn't eat breakfast this morning.)
* 他们**没**告诉我今天不用加班。(They didn't tell me I don't need to work overtime today.)
* 昨天**没**下雨。(It didn't rain yesterday.)

**不 (bù) - ""Won't do it"" / ""Doesn't do it""**

>Use 不 for **habits, refusals, future actions, or general statements**. It's about someone's behavior or intentions.

* 她**不**回我的消息。(She doesn't reply to my messages. / She won't reply to my messages.)
* 我一般**不**吃早饭。(I generally don't eat breakfast.)
* 他们**不**告诉我面试的结果。(They won't tell me the interview results.)
* 我**不**喝咖啡。(I don't drink coffee.)

**Back to the Original Question**

""They didn't give me the key"" = 他们没给我钥匙

Why? Because we're talking about a specific past event that didn't happen. They were supposed to give you the key, but the action didn't occur.

If you said 他们不给我钥匙, it would mean ""They don't/won't give me the key"" - implying they refuse to give it to you or it's their general policy not to give keys.",35,1750329678.0,ChineseLanguage,5,0.97,False

1lf7jn3,https://i.redd.it/owojpfwz3v7f1.jpeg,SVU: The New Class,"My dream for SVU, a cast that would see us through to another decade or two of shows:

Rollins: but in a role similar to Dr. Huang’s - profiling, digging into the psyches of the bad guys, like she did with Henry and Yates.

Carisi: More court room scenes, more wholesome family scenes with Rollins and the girls, and a big new task…mentoring new assistant DA: 

Renee Clark: the survivor that was able to go back to college with Olivia’s help comes back into the SVU fold to kick butt and take names as a protege of Carisi working as or working up to being his assistant DA. 

Churlish, Bruno, Velasco and Muncy all return as the little squad that could. Seriously - these actors all had INCREDIBLE chemistry in any combination and as a foursome. Bring every single one of them back and let their dynamics be the star of the show. 

Velasco and Muncy’s “will they or won’t they” has ALWAYS given some of that Stabler/Benson heat. This foursome was the way forward and still could be! 

Kat: comes back as a social worker sort of like Sister Peg - ya know, without being a nun. Kat left SVU because she didn’t want to be shot again and didn’t feel they could effect enough change, so bring her back in as somebody trying to make a big difference out in the world and she can bring in the SVU team when she needs to, and they can bring HER in for help as well. 

Jill Hennessy as the permanent medical examiner. She’s a former L&O DA *and* she was the wily medical examiner on Crossing Jordan. Brining her on would please two whole fandoms AND ***finally*** give SVU back a medical examiner as a regular cast member. 

Captain Curry stays on and plays a role like Captains Anita Van Buren and Cragen did. Let her be a Captain, a mentor, a boss and stay out of the field. 

Have Fin and Olivia pop in or have the cast go visit them for help and grab a coffee and allow them to get their checks and make fans happy, but I think with this setup you’d really revive the show and win back fans that are rewatching older seasons and lamenting the current state of the show. I would think Dick Wolf & Co would WANT another 10-20 years of paychecks, no? 

I know I’d love to watch this proposed cast for years and years. How about y’all? ",5,1750329415.0,SVU,9,0.86,False

1lf7ib5,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/1lf7ib5/coffee_isnt_bad/,Coffee isn‘t bad,"I am no doctor and this is less of a recommendation and more of a question if any of you guys know more about the topic.

Many UC patients cut out coffee even in remission. (When having a flare it can be different, I guess. I don’t know, but in a flare even drinking water seems bad enough.)

But coffee doesn’t really damage the colon in any way. It simply increases motility, meaning your food passes through your colon faster.
Therefore, it doesn’t have enough time to absorb all the water, and your stool seems like you have diarrhea and a flare might be coming when in reality there’s just more water in the stool.

Summary: Coffee makes your stool more watery, which is usually a bad sign, but it doesn’t actually mean it’s bad for you or that your colon is inflamed.

Maybe you guys already knew that, or maybe I’m actually wrong.
But I always thought that bad stool = bad colon when that’s not really the case.",3,1750329275.0,UlcerativeColitis,13,0.57,False
1lf7i2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1lf7i2f/they_killed_my_sister_guess_whos_dinner_now_novel/,"They Killed My Sister... Guess Who's Dinner Now? Novel All of Manhattan knew about the PECULIAR TRADITION in the Forrester family,","All of Manhattan knew about the PECULIAR TRADITION in the Forrester family, New York's wealthiest dynasty—Every new bride had to spend her wedding night alone in the family chapel, praying until dawn. Only those who emerged unharmed the next morning were considered blessed by the Forrester ancestors.  
  
What once had been just a formality turned into a nightmare when Callum Forrester, the current heir, took a bride.  
  
His bride was found dead in the chapel, her throat slashed with a gruesome wound, her limbs grotesquely twisted.  
  
Every security camera was reviewed, but the footage clearly showed no one had entered the chapel that night except the bride herself.  
  
Later, Callum married seven more times over the years, and horrifyingly, each bride met the same fate on her wedding night in that chapel.  
  
Police investigations yielded nothing conclusive, and each death was eventually ruled a suicide.  
  
Rumors spread throughout Manhattan—some claimed the Forrester estate was haunted, others whispered about dark rituals. No family would risk sending their daughter there anymore.  
  
But today, I stood before Mrs. Forrester in a crimson dress, my posture graceful yet determined.  
  
""Mr. Forrester is exceptionally handsome,"" I said. ""I've admired him from afar for years. I'm willing to be his ninth wife.""  
  
I looked her directly in the eyes. ""Don't worry. Your ancestors may not have liked the others, but they'll certainly like me.""  
  
\---  
  
My family ran a small bakery on York Avenue.  
  
Before dawn each morning, my sister would help our parents with the work—kneading dough, preparing fillings, making pastries, brewing coffee. She excelled at everything and never let me help.  
  
""Melody, you're meant for academics,"" she would say. ""Just focus on your studies.""  
  
""We'll support you all the way to success!""  
  
Eight years ago, on the day I was announced as Manhattan's valedictorian.  
  
My sister, dressed in a pristine white gown, shyly boarded the luxurious wedding car sent by the Forrester family.  
  
Everyone envied her good fortune. While serving coffee one morning, she had somehow caught the eye of Callum Forrester, heir to the family fortune, and was now marrying into wealth and privilege.  
  
I was happy for her too, not because of the Forrester fortune, but because of the shy, joyful look on her face before she left:  
  
""Melody, don't worry about me. Callum is truly kind, and his family has been welcoming,"" she said, holding my hands. ""I need to fly higher so you can go further. You'll always be the sister I'll protect with everything I have!""  
  
That night, I dreamed my sister had a beautiful baby who called me ""Auntie"" in the sweetest voice while clutching my shirt.  
  
But the next morning, the shocking news of my sister's death shattered our world.  
  
I raced to the Forrester estate, arriving just as they carried her out on a crude stretcher.  
  
My sister's once delicate hands were now bruised and gray. Her fingertips were bloody, all ten nails forcibly torn off, the flesh raw and mangled.  
  
Despite everyone's attempts to stop me, I yanked back the sheet covering her.  
  
Her death was horrifying—a gaping wound across her throat, her body twisted unnaturally, her eyes bulging like a fish's.  
  
Her pristine white gown was soaked through with blood, a pool of it staining the stretcher beneath her.  
  
I felt the world spinning as I collapsed to the ground.  
  
But then I heard my father's sickeningly servile tone as he kowtowed to Callum.  
  
""This terrible incident must be Victoria's fault—she simply wasn't worthy of the Forrester ancestors' blessing.""  
  
""Mr. Forrester, you're young and successful. You'll definitely find a much better wife in the future. Please don't waste your grief on someone so worthless!""  
  
Though we weren't wealthy, my father had always been kind to us sisters, never speaking harshly to either of us.  
  
When relatives once mocked him for having ""worthless daughters,"" he had grabbed a kitchen knife and confronted them.  
  
Now I couldn't believe these words were coming from his mouth.  
  
""Who would've thought I'd marry a mental case? Killing herself in the chapel on our wedding day—what terrible luck!""  
  
""Get rid of her quickly. The sight is giving me a headache.""  
  
Callum's face was dark with annoyance, showing no grief or pain as he turned to leave.  
  
My sister treasured life above all else and had promised to protect me forever—how could she possibly have committed suicide?!  
  
Red-eyed, I moved to confront them, only to be struck hard across the face by my father.  
  
""It's your sister's fault for not being fortunate enough to marry into such a good family!""  
  
""Stop embarrassing yourself and come home with me now!""  
  
I saw stars from the impact as my father dragged me away amid the whispers and stares of onlookers.  
  
The incident caused an uproar throughout Manhattan, prompting a special investigation team from the state.  
  
Shockingly, the conclusion matched Callum's claim—my sister had committed suicide.  
  
The Forrester estate had stringent security, and all surveillance footage was perfectly preserved. The recordings clearly showed that after my sister entered the chapel, no one else went in. The audio recordings captured even the sound of mosquitoes flying but recorded no screams.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Outside the chapel doors and windows, everything remained peaceful until the next morning when Callum and his mother opened the door and discovered my sister's body.  
  
The medical examiner carefully checked every suspicious detail and ruled out homicide.  
  
Everyone calmly accepted this conclusion—everyone except me.  
  
After spending the summer break crying, I enrolled at Princeton University as planned.  
  
Not because I cared about my future, but because it had been my sister's greatest wish for me.  
  
I abandoned the popular finance major and instead chose the obscure field of criminal investigation.  
  
After completing my undergraduate studies, I continued with a combined master's and doctoral program. I studied harder than anyone, terrified of missing any knowledge that might help me solve the mystery of my sister's death.  
  
Eight years later, I returned to Manhattan again.  
  
Much had happened with the Forrester family during my absence. After my sister, Callum had married seven more wives.  
  
These seven women came from vastly different backgrounds, with varied appearances and personalities.  
  
Yet each bride had died by apparent suicide in the family chapel on her wedding night.  
  
Particularly noteworthy was the eighth wife, married just six months ago—Darla Thompson, a butcher's daughter from the marketplace. She weighed nearly 300 pounds and was strong enough to knock out a grown man with one punch, with a notoriously volatile temper.  
  
Her father had gambling debts of $500,000, and the Forresters, desperate for a bride, had promised her $20 million in cash and ten commercial properties in Marina City if she survived the night.  
  
Darla tried—but didn't make it out alive.  
  
Callum had attempted to persuade his family to abandon the chapel ritual, but Mrs. Forrester insisted it was a tradition passed down through generations that could not be broken.  
  
This led to rumors spreading throughout Manhattan—some said the Forrester estate was haunted by malevolent spirits determined to end the family line; others whispered that the Forresters were sacrificing brides to feed otherworldly beings in exchange for their incredible wealth.  
  
Whatever the truth, no family across the country was willing to send their daughter there anymore.  
  
Yet on my second day back in Manhattan, I dressed in a striking crimson dress, applied flawless makeup, and appeared at the Forrester estate's entrance.  
  
""Tell your mistress I'm willing to be Callum Forrester's ninth wife.""  
  
News of my request to marry Callum spread through Manhattan like wildfire.  
  
Though Manhattan wasn't small, gossip traveled faster than any virus.  
  
""I heard Melody Vincent just returned yesterday and is already offering to marry Callum Forrester. Both sisters are just gold-diggers!""  
  
""Poor Mr. Vincent—he used to brag about how brilliant his daughter was, but look at her now, falling at the feet of money just like her sister.""  
  
""Money aside, those Forrester rumors should give anyone pause. Looks like the Vincent family might lose both daughters to that cursed place!""  
  
Everyone in Manhattan branded me as a shallow gold-digger.  
  
The fact that I was a Princeton graduate with a doctorate made the contrast all the more shocking and thrilling to them.  
  
Inside the Forrester estate, Mrs. Forrester had me brought to her.  
  
""Melody Vincent, do you truly want to marry my son?"" she asked, studying me with interest.  
  
""More certain than gold is pure!"" I replied with a smile.  
  
""Everyone knows Mr. Forrester is refined, gentle, and friendly—not to mention his net worth recently surpassed ten billion. What reason could I possibly have not to like him?""  
  
Mrs. Forrester responded with a cold laugh.  
  
""I knew you couldn't genuinely care for Callum!""  
  
The disgust in her eyes was unmistakable.  
  
But I knew she had no choice.  
  
""Look, I'm not gonna beat around the bush,"" she said.  
  
""You haven't forgotten what happened to your sister in our family chapel eight years ago, have you?""  
  
""During the eight years you've been away, a new bride has died in that chapel each year. What makes you think you'll live longer than they did?""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Mrs. Forrester's piercing gaze fixed on me.  
  
I smiled faintly.  
  
""Don't worry, Mrs. Forrester. I'm different from those ordinary women. Your ancestors may not have liked them, but they'll certainly approve of me!""  
  
I stared back at her with proud confidence.  
  
She studied me for a long time before finally nodding in agreement.  
  
""Go prepare yourself. Only by surviving tonight can you prove you're different from the others!""  
  
She dismissed me with a wave.  
  
I smiled, knowing all truths would be revealed tonight!  
  
When I returned home, my parents were already waiting.  
  
""What madness is this? Who gave you permission to agree to marry Callum Forrester?!"" My father's face was flushed with anger.  
  
My mother anxiously wiped away tears, her eyes filled with sorrow as she looked at me.  
  
But as I faced my father, I felt nothing.  
  
""Since when have you cared who I marry?"" I asked, staring into his eyes.  
  
""What nonsense! Why wouldn't I care? Don't you know about the Forrester rumors? Going there is practically suicide! Are you trying to put me and your mother in an early grave?""  
  
My father desperately tried to make me see reason.  
  
But I only coldly asked: ""If you truly cared, you wouldn't have let Victoria die in vain back then.""  
  
My father's entire body trembled, his lips quivering.  
  
""Melody, don't speak to your father like that. Your father…"" my mother began.  
  
""Shut up!"" he snapped harshly when my mother tried to defend him.  
  
Then he glared at me intensely.  
  
""Fine, since you've made your decision, I won't interfere anymore.""  
  
""From this day forward, you are no longer my daughter!""  
  
My father drove me from the house despite my mother's desperate pleas, but he remained unmoved.  
  
After leaving, I bowed deeply toward my parents' home.  
  
""Dad, Mom, your daughter has been unfilial.""  
  
""If I can uncover the truth, I promise I'll return to care for you properly!""  
  
I whispered before turning toward the end of the alley.  
  
Callum's wedding procession was even more extravagant than eight years ago—a line of Rolls-Royces that anyone would envy.  
  
""Well, that's it for the Vincent family line!""  
  
""All those years of fancy education, and that Princeton doctorate isn't worth squat, is it?""  
  
The neighbors lining the alley had all come out to mock me with their cruel taunts.  
  
Yet I boarded the car without hesitation.  
  
The procession moved slowly, taking half an hour to reach the vicinity of the Forrester family chapel.  
  
But when we were still about five hundred yards from the chapel, the driver refused to go any further.  
  
""Miss Vincent, may God be with you. We wouldn't go near that place even if you killed us,"" the driver said, turning to me.  
  
I nodded slightly, then got out and looked ahead.  
  
Perhaps it was the poor weather, or perhaps the area truly was heavy with malevolent energy, but the summer night suddenly felt bone-chillingly cold.  
  
The dark alley ahead resembled a path to hell, yet I walked forward with determined steps.  
  
A few minutes later, I stood before the Forrester family chapel.  
  
The door creaked open, and Mrs. Forrester stood in the entrance beckoning to me.  
  
Perhaps it was her overly pale makeup, but I couldn't shake the impression she resembled a paper effigy.  
  
Mrs. Forrester thrust a prayer book into my hands.  
  
""Go. Recite the prayers,"" she instructed coldly.  
  
""Read them through once, then again. I advise you not to fall asleep—otherwise... well, who knows what might happen.""  
  
Her eyes held a strange mixture of contempt and pity as she looked at me.  
  
Beside her, Callum emerged from the chapel with several others.  
  
He glanced at me dismissively.  
  
""Your sister was much prettier than you, but it doesn't matter now. I'd marry a pig if it survived the night!""  
  
Callum's face was filled with arrogance.  
  
I silently clenched my fists.  
  
I remained convinced that Callum had done something to my sister!  
  
Now my enemy stood before me, yet I could do nothing—the frustration was unbearable.  
  
""May I enter now?"" I asked, looking at Mrs. Forrester.  
  
She didn't speak, merely gesturing for someone to open the inner doors of the chapel.  
  
I walked step by step toward the unknown abyss, my heart growing heavier with each step.  
  
The door slowly closed behind me.  
  
As the last sliver of light disappeared, I found myself in complete darkness.  
  
Whoosh!  
  
Suddenly, candles on the walls ignited, their flickering light making everything around me seem eerily distorted.  
  
My heart raced involuntarily, especially when I first glimpsed the portraits of Forrester ancestors on the walls—my fear reached its peak.  
  
Ahead, memorial tablets were arranged neatly, with a prayer mat placed on the floor.  
  
I took a deep breath, gathering my courage to approach, kneeling on the mat.  
  
Then I opened the prayer book, trying to calm myself.  
  
But just as I prepared to begin reciting, something suddenly occurred to me.  
  
""Let me out! Let me out right now!""  
  
""I know what's happening!""  
  
""I know why all those brides died mysteriously!""
