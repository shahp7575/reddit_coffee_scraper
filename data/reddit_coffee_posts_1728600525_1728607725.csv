1g0xr79,https://www.reddit.com/r/guatemala/comments/1g0xr79/solo_traveler_looking_for_advice_and/,Solo traveler looking for advice and recommendations,"Hi!

I am traveling solo to Guatamala next Feb/March and staying for a little over a week. I live in the US, but I grew up in Philippines. I am likely spending most of my time in Antigua and Flores/Tikal touring Mayan sites, historical areas, and climbing Acatenango. My main focus is to eat and drink (coffee) well, take lots of architectural and landscape photos, learn about some history, and maybe spot some wildlife / birds. 

I have a few questions about how best to go about this:

- From what I see, it's better off to fly via Avianca to Flores, but if I were to head to Mexico (ideally Merida) after Guatemala, is it worth flying TAP to Merida over Avianca to Cancun (then making my way to Merida)

- Is Lake Atitlan worth a visit? It seems a quite challenging to get to and landscape wise reminds me of some lakes back home. There are a few interesting properties that seem quite unique right by the water..

- Which tour operator/guides would you recommend for Acatenango and Fuego for *2 nights*? I only see Old Town Outfitters as a two night option, while most other operators like V Hiking or Ox Expeditions squeeze both the Acatenango ascent and Fuego hike into one day. I think my body could handle it, but I would rather spend another night in Acatenango to get myself more rest and photo opportunities. 

- Which coffee farms/tours would you recommend? I'm not interested in the ones that roast themselves, but more so would show how they cultivate, harvest, and process beans prior to roasting.

I promise I've done my best to google and search a few of these things, but I can't find websites or threads that would have helped me answer¬†these. Perhaps it's because I can only rely on English resources. If you read this or commented below, thank you so much! I can't wait to visit Guatemala",1,1728607545.0,guatemala,0,1.0,False

1g0xn36,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1g0xn36/how_to_save_a_friend/,How to save a Friend,"TL;DR My brother-in-law has isolated is wife, and we're trying to reach her so we can assist in getting her some help. He is monitoring all forms of her communication. 



 So getting right into it, I'll do my best to paint the situation as clearly as I can. 

My GF's brother (X) is married to his spouse (Y) of 5yrs, they have two kids together. Y moved away from her family, friends and job to live with X in his hometown. I've known them for 3 of those years, as I met my GF then and all of her family around that same time. Over the span of these past years, I have witnessed X completely disregard Y pretty much the whole time. Only a handful of instances where he showed affection or really any kind of respect for Y as a spouse. They are pretty devout Christians (church every Sunday, Bible family values), and X believes Y should be the female counterpart to him, the family's leader, take care of the two kids (1 toddler and 1 baby), clean the house, make the food, etc, while he works his job to provide and ""protects the family"". (From what, I'm not sure) 

From my perspective, X pretty much just spent the entire time playing video games, debating with his brothers, going to concerts and other social events, essentially living a life of leisure, while Y was expected to just take care of everything mentioned above. She never went to social events, he always went while she stayed home. In his words, she doesn't like going out of the house and prefers to spend her time at home. 

We gave them the benefit of the doubt at first, but then we realized that even when we would ask her to come hang out with us (she is the mother of my GF's niece and nephew and we love her as a person and friend) after she expressed interest in getting out of the house or going to grab dinner together... X would make an excuse as to why she needed to watch the kids or why he should go instead.

Essentially, Y's been able to come to some family events with everyone, and a couple times to our house, always with X present and Y's arms full of baby. Beyond that, X has been the only one that gets to do ""fun things"", you could say. We know Y, we know she wants to come to restaurants or bookstores or even just coffee...we know she doesn't prefer large crowds or too many social events and that's fine, but we also know she does have a desire to go do things...anything...

We accepted for a while that the most contact with the world that she could have was through video games and social media, so we kept our relationship with Y pretty much to just that. Chatting through social media, sharing life events, memes, dreams and aspirations, you know typical friend conversation. We'd make plans often to see each other, just to hang out with her and the kids, and the desire felt very mutual, no red flags while speaking to her. Despite Y pretty frequently expressing her desire to hang out with us, X would always come up with some excuse as to why it was not a great time for their family for Y to leave for an afternoon/evening.

This was just typical for a while, and even then we thought it was kind of sad that X either didn't realize he was disallowing her to have social interaction or that he was doing it on purpose, we understood that it was their business, their relationship, and we should probably stay out of it unless we saw more red flags or any reason to be worried. Either way, Y slowly over the course of those years... began to fatigue... she would smile and speak to us with relief when we would visit their home, but you could see that she was very tired... a husk of a person. X has a live in brother, who we would hang out with from time to time, and through him we understood that Y was simply living here life as a live in maid. Cooking, Cleaning, caring for babies, taking care of the house, essentually full time with very little time left for hobbies or really anything else. X, as mentioned above, lived a life of leisure, not really assisting with any of it, napping, playing video games, etc, after working from home in his office. (Not a demanding position, he spent most of his time playing video games or watching videos while he was ""working""). 

We understood at this point that she was isolated, but we could not just assume that it was anything beyond a typical 
Christian household dynamic, and we didn't want to intrude, even though our friend was not allowed to be our friend, it seemed. 



So fast forwarding to more present. Some events I'm not wanting to share here occurred, but essentially Y had developed feelings for a friend online. X found out, Y came clean, and they have been working on their relationship since. 
X has been helping out around the house more, helping with the kids more, and showing more attention to Y. He seems to understand that his lack of effort led to her love for him fading over time.  

This being said, X has taken complete control of Y's communications. He now has all of her login information for every social media, full access to her phone, and monitors all correspondence. Since then, her interaction with either of us has dwindled to pretty much none. We still send friendly messages, share things with her that are associated with her hobbies, etc, but the most we get in response is a react emoji sometimes. 

(I should mention that GF and I are not religious, spiritual at most, and X has expressed his disapproval of our choice not to join his church. He believes that my GF is a threat to his family's values, and has started to get disrespectful in their communications (insulting her, saying he doesn't trust her judgement, etc).



So, this is where we start to get worried. GF recently went to her niece's bday party at the park. While there, she was able to have a face to face conversation with Y where Y asked if she could come over to our house, just her and the kids. They did not set a date, but agreed that they were both excited for a meet up in the next couple weeks. They were out of earshot of anyone, complete privacy.

In those following weeks, GF attempted to get in contact with her multiple times. Y responded to GF's proposal of a date to come over with ""I appreciate it, we'll have to pass though."" When GF asked if the date was the issue, there was no response. 
I reached out to say hello around the same time on another social media platform and was told, ""Hey, sorry, I don't really use this app anymore."" Her responses have sounded very unlike her and we can't help but wonder if X is actually the one responding. The sheer abruptness of her lack of communication is very out of character, and GF finally reached out to Y's parents who shared our concern that Y is on an island with no one but X's family around. 
We did see them recently for a family event, but Y was pretty much nonverbal, and X would not stray far from her side. Anytime anyone interacted with Y, X was soon to be within earshot, paying attention, or interjecting. We decided then was not the time to press the matter. 



Thank you for reading all of this, for getting this far. We are finally reaching out anonymously on this channel to try and see if any of you have delt with similar situations, and found ways to communicate with someone who is in need. We are very scared for our friend... there are many details that we haven't mentioned here for the sake of time , but essentially, X exhibits behaviors and beliefs that are very worrying. We feel that our friend is in danger, if not imminently then at least over time. We want her to be able to live her life freely, but it is clear that she is being severely restricted in many ways. 

Do any of you have any creative ways to gain contact with someone who has been completely isolated?

1g0xhh0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g0xhh0,10 days in portugal - a review ,"Trip update: Lisbon > Lagos > Porto from 9/14 to 9/25

AMAZING trip and I‚Äôm glad we kept our itinerary and didn‚Äôt cut stops (per feedback from an itinerary check I did pre-trip). It was a great first trip / intro to Portugal and absolutely want to come back. 

Things we did and places / meals we tried that I cannot stop raving about:

Lisbon sights:
- [ ] Just wandering around Alfama was super fun
- [ ] Walking down the streets to the Pra√ßa de Comercio was fun, we grabbed bottles of wine and watched the sunset. There‚Äôs a gent building a rock village that was cool to watch 
- [ ] Bel√©m tower is gorgeous 
- [ ] Monastery dos Jeronimos was closed since we went on a Monday but got to walk around the outside and architecture was beautiful 
- [ ] Miradouro da Senhora do Monte was a free and gorgeous lookout point of Lisbon. Amazing vista of the city
- [ ] Walked from the lookout to Castelo de S. Jorge. Cool to walk around the castle ruins. Also really great views of the city. if you can, time it so you‚Äôre there to watch the sunset from their lookout point or in the many towers 

Lisbon eats:
- [ ] Pasteis de nata, had at least one everyday and they are divine 
- [ ] Pateo - Bairro do Avillez - dinner our first night and was excited bc chef has a Michelin star. Really enjoyed it in the moment but looking back, it was our most expensive meal of the trip (still affordable compared to states) but I think we‚Äôve had more authentic meals since. Still a cool experience and ambiance was nice. 
- [ ] Pateo 13 in alfama - recommended by a friend and cash only seafood. Whole sea bass we had was good but was expecting more street food vibes 
- [ ] Da Prata 52 - favorite meal in Lisbon. Amazing Portuguese tapas place with really fun service. 
- [ ] O Castica - laid back but very good food. Shrimp, paella and seafood pasta. 

Sintra day trip
Unfortunately most of the sites were closed due to risk of wild fires so we went to the only two that were open: Biester palace and the national palace. Both were fine but nothing in comparison to wanting to see Pe√±a palace and the Moorish Castle but will just have to come back on another trip!
Had lunch at Romario de Baco and it was fun. Checked out some of their stores and stalls before taking the train back, which was super painless.

Lagos:
Omg I did not expect to love but the vibes are so chill and laid back after the hustle and bustle of Lisbon! 

Lagos sites:
- [ ] Do a cave boat tour, so fun to everything from the water. Recommend going in the morning during low tide so you don‚Äôt miss out on caves 
- [ ] Praia do Camilo - it‚Äôs 229 steps down to the beach (don‚Äôt forget the climb up) but so worth it! We went there two days in a row and were there 10 AM in time for low tide and there when high tide came in. Water is beautiful and sand if soft
- [ ] walk the boardwalk from town to the lighthouse and Ponta da Piedade

Lagos eats:
- [ ] Alma Lusa - absolutely get the octopus rice, I‚Äôm still thinking about that dish. The codfish is delicious (be sure to mix in the cured egg yolk), the sea bass was good and buttery, the mussels were delicious and their grilled octopus was divine
- [ ] Restaurante Prato Cheio - get the pork and clams cataplana. The pork was so tender and the seafood was delicious. Hubby got the mixed fish cataplana and enjoyed it
- [ ] O Camilo - please make a reso whether lunch or dinner otherwise you won‚Äôt get in. The grilled octopus was prob my fave of the trip. The squid was equally fresh and delicious, oysters were nice and briny, and garlic shrimp was amazing. 
- [ ] Repolho Gastrobar & Garrafeira Lagos - had a late lunch so did a lighter tapas only dinner here. The octopus pataniscas, shrimp, peri peri wings and spicy chorizo were pretty solid. 

Porto:
Did not expect to love Porto since it was so foggy and dreary when we landed. Actually, while we were there, most mornings started out that way but ended up clearing up and getting warm by lunchtime. 

Porto things:
- [ ] Day trip to Douro valley was so worth it and fun. Our guide Tiago was amazing and we visited a taberna for breakfast, three wineries (d‚Äôorigem, somewhere in Sabrosa and somewhere in Pinh√£o), a boat tour on the river and lunch. Bought a bottle of 20 year tawny port at our last stop
- [ ] Walking around Ribeiro neighborhood was fun
- [ ] Mercado de Bolh√£o- fun to walk around with a glass of wine and check out the stalls 
- [ ] Wandering by the river and taking the bridge to the other side was fun. Came upon some cool shops, port tasting and vendors by the river 

Porto eats:
- [ ] Gazela to try the OG Portuguese hot dog the cachorrino 
- [ ] Taberna dos Mercadores - 1.5 hr wait in line and that‚Äôs with standing in line 20 mins before they opened. But the octopus rice, salted sea bass, shrimp were all an amazing.
- [ ] Mercado de bolhao - got amazing uni, seafood, meats and cheese while walking around. Wished we found this gem sooner
- [ ] Shiko - amazing Japanese food with fresh seafood. Ceviche - this will live rent free in my head forever. Salmon tataki- solid reco by Pedro and cuts were generous and oh so buttery. Tuna akami roll - great cuts. Unagi - nice and lightly seared. Sashimi - nice cuts of tuna, salmon and yellowtail. Turbot - interested in trying pieces we don't get in the states but this was not my fave
- [ ] Potts and combi for coffee and natas 

Could not even choose a favorite stop if we tried bc every place had its own vibes. Loved Portugal and glad we got to see as much as possible! ",1,1728606712.0,travel,1,1.0,False

# A Few Things to Note:

1. **No CF4CF**: 'CFI Friendships' threads are for those seeking only platonic friends, either IRL or online. This is not the place to seek romantic interests; for that, you can create CF4CF posts on Sundays instead. If you spot any lovebirds in the wrong nest, feel free to give us a heads-up! **Stay Safe!** Use common sense and caution when talking to any stranger online.

1. **DM Etiquette:** By commenting here, you agree to be open to DMs from those seeking CFI friends (strictly platonic, unless you also post a CF4CF). Unsolicited dating or creepy messages will lead to a ban and a report to Reddit admins.
2. **Share About Yourself:** Help others get to know you better. Share your age, hobbies, city, gender (though our TwoX comrades might want to be cautious due to unsolicited attention). 
3. **Posting Flexibility:** Feel free to create posts outside of this thread to seek childfree Indian friends - use our new post flair 'CFI Friendships'. The CF4CF rules don‚Äôt apply to friendship seekers, so you can post any day, in any format, as long as you follow the other rules of CFI (see the sidebar for rules).
4. **City-Based Groups:** There are various city-based CF groups (none affiliated with this subreddit) on Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, or Facebook. Give those a try too!
5. **Meetups:** We encourage you to join or host a city-wide CF meetup if you can.

Examples:

1g0xdl0,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1g0xdl0/the_pain_of_a_breakup/,The pain of a breakup," My first girlfriend and I broke up last week. It was not very long, two months, but it was the first time I felt truly in love and loved, I genuinely thought she was the one. We would do all these little things planning the future together, she acted madly in love, snuggling up to me, holding my hand, and initiating kisses. The language she used around me as well, occasionally saying ""Marry me"" or ""I want your babies"", crazy stuff like that as half-jokes. I was the first guy she felt comfortable enough around to fall asleep for a nap with. Then we had our first fight, and it just kept going for several days until we both realized we were incompatible, which broke my heart. 

This week we went to get some coffee for closure, and what she said to me cut my heart again. She said that on reflection she had never truly loved me, that she was settling, and that I had not done enough as her boyfriend, so she didn't think I truly loved her. I know we are truly incompatible now, there is no way we could ever try again, but it still hurts so much that she didn't think it was real, when I had never done anything to hurt her.

I know the grief will go away one day, probably soon, and I will meet someone else, but it just sucks right now",2,1728606375.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

So, I‚Äôve been hearing a lot about adaptogen supplements lately and how they can help with stress, mood, and even energy levels.¬†

Honestly, I wasn‚Äôt super familiar with adaptogens at first, so I did some digging. Turns out, adaptogens are herbs that help your body adapt to stress and balance everything out.¬†

It sounds perfect for me because, let‚Äôs be real, life has been pretty stressful lately.

I decided to try Physician‚Äôs Choice Organic Ashwagandha (picked it up on Amazon because the reviews looked good).¬†

I‚Äôve been taking it for almost a month now, and here‚Äôs what I think so far:

What I Love:

* **Stress Relief**: I was a little skeptical, but I have to admit, it really does help take the edge off. I‚Äôve noticed I feel less overwhelmed, especially during hectic days, and I‚Äôm not as quick to get anxious over small things.
* **Mood Boost**: I‚Äôve been in a better mood overall. My patience levels are up and I feel more ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù mentally, if that makes sense.
* **Natural and Clean**: I‚Äôm always cautious about what I put in my body, so I love that this is organic and doesn‚Äôt have any fillers or weird ingredients.¬†
* **Easy to Take**: They come in capsule form so it‚Äôs super convenient to pop them with my morning coffee and get on with my day.

Things to Consider:

* **Takes Time to Notice Effects**: This isn‚Äôt an instant fix, so if you‚Äôre looking for something that works overnight, you might be disappointed.¬†
* **Capsules Are a Little Large**: Not a huge deal, but if you‚Äôre not great at swallowing pills, the size might be a bit annoying.¬†
* **Price Adds Up**: It‚Äôs not crazy expensive, but if you‚Äôre planning to use it long term, it can add up.¬†

I‚Äôm really happy with it so far. It‚Äôs not some miracle cure but it has definitely helped me manage stress and feel more balanced.

If you‚Äôre thinking of trying adaptogens, I‚Äôd say this is a good one to start with",1,1728606190.0,NoMoreStress,1,1.0,False

1g0x7x5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g0x7x5/the_perfect_life_was_a_lie_and_now_i_cant_wake_up/,"The perfect life was a lie, and now I can't wake up","Listen, I don‚Äôt know if this will make sense. I‚Äôm not sure I even believe what‚Äôs happening, but I have to try. I have to. If anyone reads this‚Äîif it even gets out‚Äîthen know one thing: the world is *wrong.* I‚Äôm trapped in something that isn‚Äôt real, and I can‚Äôt wake up. I‚Äôve tried. God, I‚Äôve tried. And Noah... He‚Äôs not what he seems. *Nothing is what it seems.*

Where do I start? That‚Äôs the hard part. Do I start with the house? The way it just stood there, on the edge of that too-clear lake, shimmering under the weight of the sky like it was plucked from a dream? No, no‚Äî**yanked** from my dream, like someone had gone into my head, scooped up the prettiest vision I‚Äôd ever had, and stitched it into reality with thread so thin I could see the gaps. But it was perfect, wasn‚Äôt it? The glass windows gleaming in sunlight, wood beams stretching like they were trying to hold the world together, light spilling into every corner. A fantasy, wrapped in a lie.

It should have felt wrong. It should have. But at first, it didn‚Äôt. It felt‚Ä¶ right. I woke up, the scent of coffee curling through the air, pulling me downstairs, where Noah stood. God, Noah. He was always there. Dark hair messy in that too-perfect way, a jawline that could cut glass, and that damn smile. That smile that made my knees weak, once upon a time. ‚ÄúMorning, love,‚Äù he said, sliding a cup across the counter. Just like that.

I took a sip. Warm. Strong. Exactly how I like it. Not close. Not almost. *Perfect.* And that should‚Äôve been the first clue. But no, back then it was just‚Ä¶ nice. Everything felt right. *Too* right.

You know how it goes, though. Perfect never lasts. It cracks, always. Like glass under pressure. And this‚Ä¶ this started with something small. A cup. A stupid coffee cup. I left it on the counter, I know I did. But five minutes later? In the sink. Just sitting there, mocking me, as if I‚Äôd forgotten. I thought Noah had moved it. He was always tidy, always cleaning up after me, always smiling that easy smile.

Then it was the door. I‚Äôd close it. Every time. I *know* I did. But I‚Äôd come back, and it would be wide open. Gaping, like it had never been closed at all. I asked Noah, but he just shrugged. ""You probably forgot,"" he said. *I didn‚Äôt forget.*

And then the days started blending. Blurring. I‚Äôd wake up, drink coffee, kiss Noah, paint in the studio. Over and over. One long stretch of time, folding in on itself, so smooth you couldn‚Äôt see where one day ended and another began. The house was too quiet. Too *still*. But I didn‚Äôt notice. Not at first. Not until that morning.

That morning when everything reset.

It was small, at first. Subtle. The kind of thing you could blink and miss. I woke up, went through the routine‚Äîcoffee, kiss, work. But when I went outside, the trees rippled. Not swayed. *Rippled.* Like water disturbed by a stone. The air buzzed, sharp and electric, and then‚Äîblink‚Äîeverything snapped back to normal. Gone.

I thought I was losing my mind. Maybe it was the routine, the quiet. But when I turned the key in the ignition and started driving‚Ä¶ the road. It *stretched*. It twisted, bending in ways roads aren‚Äôt supposed to bend. My knuckles were white, my breath shallow. And then‚Äîsnap‚Äîjust like that, I was back in the kitchen. Coffee cup in hand. Noah, smiling. Like nothing had ever happened.

And then it kept happening. More and more. The resets. I‚Äôd be talking to Noah, walking through the woods, painting in the studio, and then‚Äîsnap‚ÄîI was back at the beginning of the day. Each time, it felt like a piece of me was being pulled away, stretched thin like the road had been. A little more, each time.

I had to test it. I *had* to. I drove for hours, left the house, went into town. But it didn‚Äôt matter. No matter what I did, the world would reset. Always back to that same perfect morning. And Noah never noticed. He never said a word. But how could he not know? He had to know. *He has to know.*

That‚Äôs when the fear dug in. Deep. Twisting. I couldn‚Äôt sleep. How could I? Every time I closed my eyes, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôd wake up the same person. I started watching Noah more closely. Waiting for him to slip. Waiting for him to prove he wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ real. But every day, every single day, he was flawless. His smile, his touch, his voice. Flawless.

I couldn‚Äôt trust him. I couldn‚Äôt trust anything.

The house? It became a maze. A prison. I‚Äôd walk through the rooms, fingers brushing the walls, searching for something‚Äî*anything*‚Äîout of place. And then I found it. A crack. A tiny, hairline crack, in the glass of one of the windows overlooking the lake. It was so small, I almost missed it. But once I saw it, I couldn‚Äôt stop staring. It felt like the world itself was starting to break.

I pressed my fingers to it. Expecting glass. Cold. Hard. But no. It wasn‚Äôt. It was‚Ä¶ soft. Warm. Alive. I yanked my hand back, my heart pounding in my chest. The crack was gone.

I tried to show Noah. Of course I did. But by the time I dragged him over, the window was pristine, perfect as ever. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just tired,‚Äù he said, kissing my forehead. ‚ÄúCome to bed.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not tired,‚Äù I wanted to scream. But I went to bed anyway. And that‚Äôs when the nightmares started.

I‚Äôd wake up in the middle of the night, heart hammering in my chest, drenched in sweat, but I couldn‚Äôt remember the dreams. Only that they had been *bad*. So bad, they left echoes. Cold fingers tracing up my spine. And Noah? He slept like a baby. Perfect. Peaceful. Every. Single. Night.

But every time I woke, I was sure something had changed. The house wasn‚Äôt the same. The furniture, just a little out of place. The color of the walls‚Äîoff, like someone had turned the dial down a notch. And Noah. He started changing too. His smile, too sharp. His eyes, darker. His touch? Too long. I‚Äôd catch him watching me sometimes, and the way he looked back‚Ä¶ it sent chills through me.

But it wasn‚Äôt just the house. I started hearing things. At night. Whispers. Soft at first, like wind slipping through cracks in the walls. But the more I listened, the louder they became. A voice. My name. Over and over. Calling to me from somewhere deep within the house.

I started seeing things too. Shadows. Flickers at the edge of my vision. Figures. Standing at the edge of the lake. Watching. Always watching.

The cracks in reality were widening. No matter how hard I tried to hold on, the world kept slipping. Slipping away, unraveling. I couldn‚Äôt tell what was real anymore. I couldn‚Äôt trust my own eyes.

One night, I tried to leave. Again. I packed a bag, waited until Noah fell asleep, and ran. I ran as fast and as far as I could, through the woods, down the winding road, my breath tearing at my throat. I thought I‚Äôd made it. I thought maybe, just maybe, I‚Äôd finally get away.

But as soon as I crossed the property line‚Äîsnap‚ÄîI was back in bed.

I screamed. I tore at the sheets, at the walls, at my own skin. Noah woke up, calm as ever. He tried to hold me, but I couldn‚Äôt let him touch me. I ran downstairs, locked myself in the bathroom, and stared at the mirror.

That‚Äôs when I saw it. My reflection. It wasn‚Äôt me. The woman staring back was hollow. Empty. Her eyes, black pits of nothing. I reached out, touched the glass, and it *bent* beneath my fingers. The reflection smiled, a cold, dead smile.

I don‚Äôt know how long I sat there before Noah found me. He broke down the door, scooped me up, carried me back to bed. He whispered soothing words, but I couldn‚Äôt hear them over the sound of my own heartbeat, pounding in my ears like a war drum.

I knew then. This wasn‚Äôt real. None of it. The house, the lake, Noah‚Äîit was all a lie. A construct. But who was doing this to me? And why?

The days blurred together. Or were they weeks? I stopped trying to escape. What was the point? Every time I tried, the world would reset. The only thing that changed was the house. It kept shifting. Becoming more‚Ä¶ alive. I could hear it now, breathing around me. The floors pulsing beneath my feet. The house had a heartbeat. A slow, steady thrum, deep within the walls.

And Noah. God, Noah. He wasn‚Äôt Noah anymore. Whatever he was, it wore his skin, but it wasn‚Äôt him. I could see it in his eyes now. The way they glittered with something‚Ä¶ wrong. Every touch, every kiss‚Äîit felt wrong. Tainted. Dark.

I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. The resets. The whispers. The shadows. The house‚Äîit was feeding on me. Feeding on my fear. And I was trapped. I knew, deep down, there was no way out.

The final crack came one night when I woke up to find Noah standing at the foot of the bed, watching me. His face wasn‚Äôt his face anymore. Twisted. Distorted. Like it was barely holding together. His smile stretched too wide, his eyes too bright. He leaned down, his voice a rasp in the darkness.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre never leaving,‚Äù he whispered, his breath hot against my skin. ‚ÄúThis is your life. Forever.‚Äù

I screamed. I screamed until my throat was raw, until my voice was nothing more than a broken rasp. But no one heard me. No one came.

And now? Now I‚Äôm stuck. In this endless loop. Days, weeks, months‚Äîthey all blur together. Every day the same. Every night, the same terror.

But one thing is certain. I‚Äôll never escape.

The house won‚Äôt let me.",2,1728605866.0,nosleep,0,0.75,False

* AFAIK taking pre/pro/post-biotics is important after a course of antibiotics to replenish the gut microbiome.¬†
* **Is there something analogously important (taking mushroom supps?) to do after a course of antifungal pills to support the bodies mycobiome?**

I've just been prescribed Itraconazole (systemic anti-fungal pills) for persistent athletes foot / nail fungus which topical creams have not been able to eradicate.

I've tried many holistic/natural things to improve this already: 3 months of oregano/black walnut + ND shilajit, topical creams (prescribed and homeopathic), months of low carb diet, topical and ingested grapefruit seed extract, generally my diet is free of junk, I tried fermented daily raw garlic for 2 months, as much sunlight exposure to the feet as possible and obvious basic things (1-2x/day sock rotating, 1-2x/day showers - the point here is that I'm very hygienic).

The only thing I can imagine that is contributing to this problem is poor circulation because my feet always feel cold - which I've never been able to figure out - I'm 28M, 6'3, 205lb, 15% bodyfat, bloodpressure is always good, 55BPM resting HR, non-smoker, 0-3 beers/week, 1-2 coffees or tea /day, daily exercise either weights or boxing. I also tried ND gingko biloba for 3 months to improve bloodflow to the extremities.

The only other fly in the ointment of my health in my history was elevated TSH 10 years ago, but every-time I've had it checked since, it's been fine. Besides that I probably have chronic stress due to chronic pain/anxiety which resulted from a spine fracture when I was a teenager, but I feel 100x better now than my worst at 19.

So now I'm going for the nuclear option: Systemic anti-fungal pills

Does anyone have any suggestions for supplements to either support my mycobiome or help with athletes foot eradication? Thanks",2,1728605780.0,FunctionalMedicine,0,1.0,False

As a child of two warring nations, Evie‚Äôs mixed heritage has always marked her as an outcast, yet with the Damned, she discovers the possibility of belonging.

¬†

However, the Church views the Damned as unholy technological mistakes, the poor blame Automatons for the recession and as more of the Damned convert to sky-Piracy many fear what they may become.

When Evie learns of plans to eradicate them, she resolves save them. Operating a shady coffee den by day and smuggling the Damned out of the city by night, her resolve pushed to the brink when her only link to salvation disappears and her means to rescue the Damned with it.

1g0x44y,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1g0x44y/a_day_in_the_life_ramkel_in_2033_ai_story/,A Day in the Life: Ramkel in 2033 (Ai story),"It‚Äôs a crisp autumn morning in Portland, Maine. The year is 2033, and life couldn‚Äôt feel more complete. The house you and your husband bought five years ago is nestled in a quiet neighborhood, with trees lining the streets and that sweet smell of pine lingering in the air. The sun streams through the large bay windows of your living room as you roll over in bed, gently woken by the soft sound of your husband humming in the kitchen.

You take a deep breath, smile, and glance over at the clock‚Äî7:00 AM. Your kids are likely starting to stir. You hear the telltale sounds of tiny feet pattering across the hallway floor, your five-year-old son, Malik, already in superhero mode. You chuckle as he bursts into the room, donning his favorite cape, ready to save the day.

‚ÄúMorning, Daddy!‚Äù he shouts, jumping onto the bed with the energy of a dozen cups of coffee. Right behind him is your three-year-old daughter, Amira, her curls bouncing as she holds her stuffed unicorn.

‚ÄúGood morning, my little superheroes!‚Äù you laugh, scooping both of them up in your arms.

You get up, toss on a comfy sweater, and head to the kitchen where your husband is flipping pancakes like a pro. He‚Äôs wearing an apron that says ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs Best Hubby,‚Äù a gift from the kids for Father‚Äôs Day last year. He turns, grinning as you walk in, and leans in for a good morning kiss.

‚ÄúMorning, babe. Breakfast is almost ready,‚Äù he says, pointing to the plates of pancakes, fresh fruit, and coffee waiting on the table.

The four of you gather around the table, laughing, chatting, and planning out the day. The kids‚Äô giggles echo through the house as they playfully argue over who gets the biggest pancake. Malik, of course, insists his superhero status grants him the largest one, while Amira tries to bribe you with a sweet smile for an extra blueberry on her plate.

After breakfast, it‚Äôs time to get everyone ready for the day. Malik grabs his little backpack, excited for another day of kindergarten, while Amira stays home for a fun day of arts and crafts with you. Your husband kisses you goodbye as he heads out for work‚Äîhe‚Äôs now a successful entrepreneur, running his own business from a nearby office. You‚Äôve got a flexible work schedule, freelancing and creating social media content, which gives you more time with the kids.

By mid-morning, the house smells of fresh paint and glue from Amira‚Äôs latest masterpiece‚Äîa glitter-covered unicorn that‚Äôs probably more glue than paper. You love these moments, getting to watch her imagination run wild. Meanwhile, you also find time to check on your latest YouTube and TikTok content, responding to your followers and planning out the next big video idea. Your social media presence has grown significantly over the years, and you‚Äôve built an amazing community around your advocacy for mental health, LGBTQ+ rights, and life as a dad of two.

In the afternoon, you and Amira pick up Malik from school. On the way home, you stop by your mom‚Äôs place in Portland. She loves seeing the kids, and your siblings are always there to shower them with attention. It‚Äôs a good feeling, knowing your family is so close and connected.

By the time dinner rolls around, your husband is home, and it‚Äôs your turn to cook. You whip up one of your signature dishes‚Äîsomething hearty and warm for the fall weather, like a savory beef stew. The four of you sit around the table again, sharing stories from the day. Malik excitedly talks about the new friends he made at school, while Amira proudly shows off her latest unicorn art project.

As the night winds down, you all gather in the living room for family time. Movie nights have become a weekly tradition. Tonight, it‚Äôs Malik‚Äôs pick, so you‚Äôre all watching an animated superhero flick. The kids snuggle up next to you, their eyes heavy as they start to drift off before the movie ends.

Once the kids are tucked into bed, you and your husband retreat to the backyard patio, the stars bright overhead. Wrapped up in a blanket, you sit together, sipping tea and talking about the future. Even though you‚Äôre living the dream, you both have goals and ambitions you still want to chase. But for now, you just enjoy this quiet moment, knowing that in 2033, life is pretty damn perfect.",0,1728605522.0,lgbt,1,0.33,False

I went on a first date with a girl and very much enjoyed my time. I texted her a few hours later apologizing for being a bit awkward at the end of the date, that I had a great time and that I'd love to meet again.

We just had a simple date at a coffee place and when I got back to my car I noticed that my upper lip was like brownish from the coffee I was drinking (it had honey and cinnamon added). Her reply to that comes off as almost defensive? to me. Like I wasn't worth looking at? Idk, I'm probably reading way too much into that part because, of course, she agreed to meet again.

I‚Äôm feeling pretty lost with my career path right now and could use some advice. I‚Äôm 27 and have had a pretty unconventional twenties so far. I worked my way up in hospitality and even helped open up a couple of coffee shops. I moved across the country and to another state, picking up odd jobs along the way. I don‚Äôt have a degree, but I‚Äôve gained a lot of experience through different roles.

Right now, I‚Äôm working at a corporate job, starting at the lowest level, and I honestly have no desire to climb the ladder. This job has really dimmed my inner light, and I‚Äôm starting to forget what I‚Äôm good at or what my dreams are. I‚Äôve always wanted to own my own business one day, but I feel completely disconnected from my passion and purpose.

Should I consider going back to school, or would it make more sense to stick with my job and focus on developing a business plan in my free time? How can I get back in touch with what I‚Äôm meant to do career-wise?

A coworker and i have (what everyone who's ever seen us interact tells me) a mutual crush on eachother. However I'm a lesbian and shes straight (?)

Over 2 years we've become eachothers shadow at work. She's shy, quiet, and a little icy if you don't know her well, and not very close to anyone at work except me. I've met her kids, gone to her house, she's invited me out, every spare moment  we spend looking for one another, in the hallways, across the room, our eyes lock, even in the middle of something we find any excuse to stare at eachother, to smirk, to find an excuse to be around the other. 

We have a routine every morning, we'll bring eachother coffee and ask about each others day etc She's not so great at communicating her feelings but I'm the one at work who 'understands her the most' She likes to use a lot of sarcasm and has a withholding personality. We have many inside jokes and she's told me many personal things. Everyone else at work maybe knows like 3 facts about her but, i could write an entire book. We'll stay up for hours texting eachother and having banter. 

She told me she had a crush on a guy she hardly knew, seemingly to make me jealous, rubbing him in my face and saying i wasn't her favourite anymore. I 'pretended' to ignore her (shes done this to me before) because i was jealous. I told her, she said she didn't have a crush on him 'really..' that I've always 'been her favourite' 

My other colleague /best friend (who she is also loose friends with) asked me why we weren't talking for the day. I told her she had a new 'favourite' jokingly and his name. That was it, and I know that was my mistake. Then my friend made a joke about this guy to my coworker. (we've teased her about similar stuff and vice versa before) 

She refused to speak to me, and went home because her shift ended. I messsged her to check up on her and she's like a completely different person. She said she's not telling me anything anymore because everyone at work will know. 
I felt so bad. I only told the bare minimum to my friend when she asked.  I really didn't think a) she was serious about this guy b) she's always teasing me and others in the same way c) it would upset her d) everyone at work knows im her 'favourite' she tells everyone

Anyway i apologised profusely and explained what i said and why via text. She didn't reply. I then saw her in person and she was not even looking at me. I brought her favourite chocolates and explained again that i was so sorry to upset her and hurt her feelings. That I told no one any actual details of this guy and that i was just jealous that i really understand why shes upset. 

She refused the chocolate, but I left it in her office with a sorry note attached. She ate it... 

I asked if we we're still friends. She said 'Yes. We're friends. Just friends, now. Not more than friends.'  
Which was a really weird answer because she and I have never actually addressed or mentioned (overtly) our feelings(?) about one another. We make jokes and some flirty comments but we've never addressed it. 

I thought that was weird but i left it. The next day i thought things might be better.  I went in and asked her how she was. She said 'fine' but clearly wasn't, i said i feel like i dont know her anymore to which her reply was 'yes you dont know me.' and i was like 'well are we going to even be friends anymore? I know what i did but i dont understand why you're so mad at me' and she said 'you know you told everyone' and i said 'no i didn't, I'm really sorry' i joked that our other colleague 'couldn't shut her mouth' and she said 'Maybe you should have shut yours.' 

I just sat there and tried to talk to her and she kept smirking?! and i was like 'i don't get you are you joking, are you not?' and she  just kept smiling. I said finally 'I don't know how you feel. And if we're just going to be just colleagues, not even friends just like that then that tells me everything i need to know' and she goes 'yep' 

I got so upset i just had to leave. I haven't seen her since and regardless of our weird relationship I'm finding I am so devastated over the loss of a friendship. I just keep going over and over in my head and i keep crying. I understand I broke her trust and my friend shouldn't have made a joke. But to throw away a friendship like that over something so minor?!! And now at work she is not even speaking to any of my colleagues. She will answer with 1 word answers. And the 'more than friends thing?!'  i miss her so much and i want our relationship to go back to how it was but i don't think shes ever going to forgive me.

I felt like crap most of the time. I usually hardly ever feel boredom, I was bored out of my skin there! When finally last night I found myself in the airport, my God! I craved alcohol so badly, I do not know how I ordered black coffee at the bar! But I did, and it was actually delicious. Every time a flight attendant appeared with bottles of wine, I asked for sparkling water. I was just going through motions and actually it helped.

I don‚Äôt have any friends or family that have worked in corporate so wanted to ask you all here. 

I‚Äôm about to wrap up my 1yr internship up in January. I‚Äôve been wanting to organise ‚Äúcoffee catch-ups‚Äù with some managers that I‚Äôve worked with to open up the possibility of staying on next year - part time until I finish up uni. 

How do I go about asking/and or organising this. I‚Äôve had really great feedback from the team about my work initiative/statistically I‚Äôve shown great performance as well. 

I don‚Äôt want the entire catch up to feel like an advertisement. I want something more causal and laid back, so was thinking of doing a coffee catchup in the morning where I ask the managers more about their role/how they got started etc. and then at the end throw in how I really enjoyed working in the team and would love to stay on.

1g0wl2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Business_Skills/comments/1g0wl2h/how_storytelling_saved_my_business/,How Storytelling Saved My Business,"A few months back, I found myself at a crossroads with my marketing agency. Business was tough; we had lost several key clients and were struggling to stand out in a crowded marketplace. I was stressed, questioning whether I should pivot or just throw in the towel.

One evening, I was chatting with a friend over coffee, sharing my frustrations. She suggested I think about the stories behind my clients and how I could use those narratives to connect with new ones. At first, I brushed it off. I was focused on numbers and services, not storytelling.

But the idea lingered in my mind. What if I could create a narrative that highlighted not just what we did, but who we were? I decided to give it a shot. I reached out to some of my long-term clients and asked if they‚Äôd be willing to share their experiences working with us. 

To my surprise, they were enthusiastic! They told stories about how our campaigns had transformed their businesses, the challenges we had tackled together, and the personal connections we built along the way. I recorded these conversations, weaving them into compelling narratives.

With these stories in hand, I revamped our marketing materials and website. Instead of just listing services, I showcased real-life testimonials framed as stories‚Äîhighlighting not only the success of our clients but also the partnerships we formed.

I shared these narratives on social media, and the response was overwhelming. People resonated with the authenticity and emotion behind the stories. Potential clients reached out, drawn not just to our services, but to the values and connections we represented.

One story in particular‚Äîa small business that had grown exponentially thanks to our support‚Äîcaught the attention of a local news outlet. They featured us in a piece about community businesses, and suddenly, we were getting inquiries from clients who wanted to work with a company that truly cared about their success.

That experience taught me that storytelling is more than just a marketing tool; it‚Äôs a way to build trust and foster connections. By sharing our journey and the journeys of our clients, I was able to create a sense of community and attract new business.

Now, I view storytelling as an integral part of my business strategy. It‚Äôs not just about selling; it‚Äôs about connecting on a human level. If you‚Äôre struggling in your own business, I encourage you to find your story and share it. You might be surprised at how powerful it can be.",1,1728603904.0,Business_Skills,0,1.0,False

I thought okay cool, more family time and we'll be able to stay up later together tonight.

An hour or so after that he let's me know that he's made plans to go out for beers tonight or possibly going to bring company over to have said beers here.

Now, normally this stuff doesn't bother me. My husband is social and he was born and raised in the town we currently live in so he knows or is related to basically everyone lol 

But more and more lately I find myself feeling irritated because he gets to just go ""Hey, made plans, I'll be home later!"" And just peace out for however long he wants with zero other thoughts or concerns or additional checking because he knows I'll be home to watch our baby.

It's not entirely his fault because even I wanted to make plans and go out, I can't. I have zero friends and zero social life of any kind. 

I don't leave the house at all at least 5 days a week. I even work from home! The only time I go out at all is if the two of us (or three of us for family outings) have a reason to go out.

So as a result of have absolutely no friends or social life to speak of, I never get a real break from anything.

I get up, tidy whatever needs it, make coffee and go to work. Get off work between 5 and 6 pm, just in time for baby to get dropped off. Quickly get her supper made and feed her, clean her up and get her down for the night. 

By the time thats done I have around 45 minutes to cook supper and get it ready for when husband gets home at 9pm.

That's my entire life 5 days a week and on the weekend we generally go to the laundromat, maybe visit his grandma in the home and every couple weeks we go to diner. 

But I'm always responsible for something or someone at all times.

I never get to just grab my purse and go out or do anything alone, let alone going out with friends or anything. 

Even when he's home, I'm careful that I don't over do it if I decide to have a drink or something because I'll be needed if the baby wakes up in the night. Even if he were to get her, I'm still responsible for getting a bottle and a recieving blanket prepared for him.

I think I'm just ranting at this point but it feels like such an unfair thing that really, I can't change if I wanted to because what am I going to do? Walk to the bar alone one Friday night? Manifest some friends out of thin air to hang out with? ",12,1728603467.0,breakingmom,6,1.0,False

I just had my Bezzera BZ13 professionally repaired (pump, some valves, pressure gauge were replaced). Now the brew pressure is set to about 8 to 8.2 bars (with blind basket, during coffee extraction it starts at 8-8.2 and drops down to about 7.4-7.2), and I‚Äòm struggling to dial in the espresso (which i usually know how to do), no matter how I adjust grind size and dose, its always way too sour, even when the shots run way too long. Could that be a result of the low brew pressure? Shouldn‚Äôt the pressure be around 9 bars, or on vibration pump machines even higher? Should I adjust the brew pressure? Its kind of a hassle, since you have to open up the machine for that. 

And another thing, the needle of the pressure pressure gauge is always flickering when there is any pressure , it oscillates in between about 1/2 bar instead of standing still at one position. The gauge was just replaced though during the repairs. Do you know any reasons why that happens?

The reason we broke up last year was due to our difference in libido, he is a highly sexual being, down for sex 24/7. I have struggled with depression and anxiety since i was 13 and am currently in the long process dr appts until i am diagnosed/referred to therapist. I suspect i am adhd/on the spectrum because of my sensory sensitivity, how easily overstimulated i am etc. i NEEED my alone time like humans need sleep. needless to say my horniness is very random, hit/miss & this would really get to him, giving him sexual anxiety...and his sexual anxiety (in addition to his poor communication) in turn made me feel pressured into sex which made me want it less. So when we got back together last year we agreed on an intimacy schedule. So that he can know when to expect sex, & i can know when to expect to not be sexualized & have alone time & know when to be mentally prepared for sexual activity. (I am also a victim of SA by a photographer 10 yrs ago) We have sex twice on Wednesdays, fridays and saturdays. On days we dont have sex he takes care of himself in the other room 2-3 times a day, while i have been trying desperately to use my only skill (sewing) to make shit to sell..& it‚Äôs SO hard to find the energy & motivation with adhd. We have fought almost every month about him feeling unwanted (even on the schedule) bc well, it‚Äôs that time of the month for my hormones to go crazy & cause me to withdraw flirtation/sexuality-wise. I of course still give him kisses & hugs etc & show my love for him and fuck him on our ‚Äúon days‚Äù. I make him his coffee and wake him up every single morning, even on days i am feeling REALLY low. I‚Äôll offer back scratchies if he seems sad. But without fail, every few weeks it seems like something is wrong. I ask. & he‚Äôll lie & say he‚Äôs fine & continue acting cold expecting me to read his mind, or its the same problem again. That he feels unwanted. Even if the DAY before he fucked me twice and told me how happy i make my man‚Ä¶i feel like i‚Äôm losing my mind. He is also bi & he spent 3 years getting me into anal & the like even though it was never my interest but as he has come into his sexuality i have fully supported him & even take part in his preferred sexual activity either every weekend or every other. Idk i‚Äôm sorry this is all over the place and i‚Äôll answer any questions‚Ä¶ i just dont know what to do anymore. I don‚Äôt WANT to break up.

We could see the aurora faintly all around us. At one point, one of them realized that it was above us, so we lay on our backs just watching the stars and the dancing aurora. 

They called up their friend, who was apparently busy cooking a lamb roast, and told him to forget the roast and join us. Soon, I was watching the stars with 3 French strangers!

1g0w34h,https://www.reddit.com/r/StandingDesks/comments/1g0w34h/ideas_on_making_a_floor_to_standing_desk/,Ideas on making a floor to standing desk?,"Hello standing desk peeps!! I have been looking for a while on how to either buy or make a floor to standing desk for a small space. I have found a few options such as the [uppeal desk](https://www.uppealdesign.com/). However, it is just a bit to large for where I live and bit too pricy for something that doesn't check all the boxes.

I stumbled upon the [Lambda standing desk from Work From Home Desk](https://workfromhomedesks.com/collections/lambda-standing-desks) company and love it. The size is great but the only issue I have is that it does not go low enough. Does anyone have any recommendations on how I can possibly buy this and make it go lower or make something myself? Below is my ideal requirements.

1. Height range 15"" - 43""
2. Table Width: 31"" (Can be flexible to 41‚Äù)
3. Table Depth: 24"" (Can be flexible)
4. Monitor is needed. Instead of installing a stable shelf for the monitor I would like to install a monitor arm that can move to align with the height.
5. Can NOT be attached to the wall (I rentüòï)
6. I already have a nice office chair so I do not want to get a ‚Äústanding stool‚Äù to make a permanent standing desk to the floor option. 
7. Price- ideally if I am making this I would like to stay below $500. I am flexible if any ideas are a game changer. 

I am very aware that this is a very tall order. I am hoping someone may be a bit more creative then me with any advise on how to do this. I really appreciate your time for even reading :).

Just for some additional background as the need for this is that I have horrific ADHD and if I am not constantly moving from standing to sitting on the floor then I can barely get any work done at home. I constantly move from my current desk to the coffee table to the counter tops. 

Also - I am aware of the lily pad desk but honestly really don‚Äôt like the look of it. And for the price on something I don‚Äôt love is really hard pill to swallow . 

Thanks again!!",1,1728602401.0,StandingDesks,4,1.0,False

-Swap a daily fancy sweet coffee for iced coffee with oat milk no sweetener/sugar 

-Swap a large lunch with a large breakfast & a snack at lunch time instead 

-Add a walk every day (I already have been going to the gym for two years) 

-Swap a piece of toast with breakfast for an extra egg 

-Subtract sweets except for once per week; my treat of choice has also been a vegan cookie recently so it‚Äôs pretty low cal anyway!

The first week it was hard not to get my fancy coffees but I actually stopped craving them after day 5 & would actually no longer get them even if I wasn‚Äôt doing this challenge!! I know this because I was planning to get a fancy coffee as my treat this week but I actually had no desire to get one & had my cookie instead. 

I‚Äôve also gotten out of the routine of sweets every day so this will probably just be a lifestyle thing for me from now on!",1,1728601972.0,75soft,0,1.0,False
1g0vwlm,https://i.redd.it/x51z6qytg0ud1.jpeg,At a loss for how retrieve iPhone so I‚Äôm trying here. ,"Hello all, my daughter just got her very first phone a couple of months ago and when we went, on foot, to check on our neighbors following Helene, it fell out of her back pocket somewhere along the way. We retraced our steps but the phone was nowhere to be found. 

She is, obviously, extremely distraught over this as it was her only means of contacting her friends‚Äîmany of whom she hasn‚Äôt been able to contact (without their phone numbers) to verify that they are ok.  

I checked the phones location but the internet was still showing up as ‚ÄúSOS‚Äù on my device (and presumably hers) so I was unable to use the ‚ÄúFind My‚Äù app to locate it. So, I turned the phone on ‚Äúlost mode‚Äù just in case someone else might find and be able to notify me. 

Fast forward to a couple of days later when the phone was connected to WiFi‚Äîindicating that someone had, in fact, found it! I looked at the location and it appeared to be on Haywood, downtown‚Äîthough the location would flip flop between 20 and 18 Haywood. I tried calling the phone multiple times to no avail. I tried going to the address but there was clearly no one in the bar or the store-which made me think one or more possibilities: 

1. Whoever found the phone retrieved it to keep it safe but possibly has also evacuated/left Asheville and has not heard my attempts to call nor the ‚Äúphone locator‚Äù ring I used when I attempted to find it in person. The phone has remained at the same location this entire time (unless it was moved after the battery died several days ago). 
 
2. I do NOT believe this was an attempt at ‚Äúthievery‚Äù because they found the phone, first of all‚Äîthat‚Äôs not theft‚Äîand they didn‚Äôt turn it off which makes me think they were hoping someone would be able to locate the device to ultimately retrieve it. 

3. The phone is either in one of the stores/the bar on that block OR in one of the units above those businesses. 


With no success retrieving the phone, I have been feeling somewhat at a loss on how to proceed and decided to make a post on Reddit as a last ditch effort. I am currently unable to work (as are so many of us) because the lack of running water prevents me from legally doing so in my industry. Therefore, I cannot afford the $200 deductible at the moment to replace the phone. If you happen to be the person who found the phone, could you please message me here? I would be *extremely grateful.* ",4,1728601864.0,asheville,5,0.83,False

1. Don‚Äôt leave your house unless you really want to . Can‚Äôt stress this enough. 

2. If you are an impulse buyer,  shop online. Don‚Äôt go into a malls all the time. Put things in your cart and shop next day. You will know if you really need them

3. Assess you friends and social circle. Invest your time and money wisely.. 

4. Don‚Äôt tell your friends and  family when are you planning to go back to your home country. Give surprise üòù you can save a lot . 

5. Invest in a good coffee machine . I saved at least AED 3000 in a year just by controlling my urge to go Starbucks and had equally go coffee at home. 

6. Don‚Äôt get more than 2 credit cards . One visa and one master. Limit shouldn‚Äôt be more than 20k.

Little bit info about my boyfriend (M26):
He is currently working full time, leaves at 7 and wake up at 6. This means he is also looking for a roommate who is either working fulltime as well or a student that won't make noise after 10 PM in the building, because you can hear It, He likes to game, cooking, coffee and works at a IT company. 

Information about the shared apartement: 
You have your own room which is about 20M2. You will share a 'small' bathroom and kitchen with him. There is a schedule for cleaning and taking the trash out. 
The rent is around 670 excluded gas, water, electricity and wifi. This means you pay a total amount of around ‚Ç¨800,- included. The location is beautiful, it's nearby the station and city by 5-10 min biking.
