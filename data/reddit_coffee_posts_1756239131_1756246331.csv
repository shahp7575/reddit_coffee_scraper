I had hoped she‚Äôd be at the reunion, but I kept that hope a secret. Even from myself. It took a second to register she was real, not just a fantasy ambushing me in the daytime. She was at a high table across the dancefloor, a wish unmade, a vision of honey blonde curls in a red dress. Alone.

I started walking, dodging the photo booth line and some lady with a clipboard asking me to add to the memory wall. After 20 years, there weren‚Äôt many memories I cared to hold onto. Except one.¬†

She looked better than memory. Not ‚Äúaged well‚Äù, but refined. She was taller, toned shoulders and legs. By the time I reached her I realized ‚ÄúWow, you got hotter‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt cut it. I bumped the wobbly leg of her table, spilling champagne down her chin.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù I said, deepening my voice. I turned to grab napkins, but she stopped me with a hand on my forearm.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt sweat it,‚Äù she said, wiping her lip with her thumb. No Facebook photo could capture the brilliant brown of her eyes.

‚ÄúCan I‚Ä¶ get you another?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, please,‚Äù her voice was warm, a delight to hear. So much better than having to eavesdrop from the corner of her favorite coffee shop. I felt the familiar urge to touch her, to confirm this was real, but I caught myself.

I jogged to concessions, smoothing my shirt and straightening my bowtie. I nearly spilled a row of glasses, terrified she‚Äôd vanish before I returned. But she was still there, perched on her barstool, watching me. I tried to wave but with a drink in each hand it looked like I was giving a toast. ‚ÄúToast to us‚Äù, I thought. ‚ÄúTogether at last.‚Äù

When I slid back into the stool across from her, she was quiet. I tried a proper cheers, but she was sitting on her hands. Her smile was thin, almost pained. Something was wrong. I could feel it, but I didn‚Äôt say anything because the moment felt so fragile. She was finally seeing me. After years of pining, calling and hanging up, watching through windows, digging through dumpsters, I could be in the open.

She trembled, perhaps feeling my passion for the very first time. I couldn‚Äôt help it anymore. I reached out to wipe a tear from her cheek.

‚ÄúI feel it too,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThis was meant to‚Äì‚Äù

A weight slammed into my ribs before I finished. I toppled off the stool, clawing at the Kevlar vest of the police officer that tackled me as my head smacked the wooden floor.

‚ÄúYou said you wouldn‚Äôt let him touch me!‚Äù my love cried, her distress breaking my heart. Another officer locked my hands behind my back as the crowd gasped. My love faded into the background, but I could hear her voice from anywhere:¬†

I wanted to get some honest thoughts. We‚Äôve been tinkering around with making a coffee pod that has sceletium (kanna) in it, and I‚Äôve been really surprised at how good it feels.

I‚Äôm curious if this is something people would actually be into. Do you drink coffee pods where you are? In South Africa they‚Äôre not super common, so I‚Äôm wondering if the idea would make more sense in other places.

Im a polish female and Im 20 years old and I will be moving to Oss, Netherlands for about 2-3 months to work there.. since Im kind of a stoner and weed is.. well.. kinda ""illegal"" in poland i got a couple of questions...

First of all... I saw on google maps that the only coffee shop in Oss is ""de Jungle"" coffee shop.. Ive read that smaller cities in Netherlands have this law that states that coffee shops are exclusive to locals only.. no tourists.... is that really true?.... i really dont want to take a ‚Ç¨200 uber to a bigger city just to smoke some weed... is this really true? maybe I can ask some locals to buy the weed for me? how does this work...

second thing.. If I somehow get the weed. well... lets just say that back in poland, even a small glass pipe could really fuck me up. im talking about 0.1g and im geeked for hours... I dont wanna be disrespectful to the culture of stoners and mix it with tobbaco but... i also dont want to buy a pure joint since it would be a waste of money. i would take a few hits out of this joint and probably will be done with it and all of the rest would go to waste...

I was thinking about smoking out of a glass pipe but.. i dont wanna be considered a weirdo... do people smoke out of glass pipes or do they just smoke pure joints?... i dont wanna be hidin at my crib like some introvert fuck.. i want to FINALLY be able to just chill out, go for a nice walk to the park, sit on a bench and just... feel free... but i dont wanna get weird looks from the locals that I smoke out of a glass pipe and not the whole joint...

and last thing... how do I know if I can smoke in a certain place or not? ive read that a lot of Netherland cities actually are pretty strict with where you can smoke and where not... do I just smoke it inside of the coffee shop or do I find like a sign on the street that says ""you can smoke here""?

1n0zazh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActuallyReviewed/comments/1n0zazh/should_you_buy_the_blonex_electric_spin_floor_mop/,Should You Buy the Blonex Electric Spin Floor Mop for Home Floors,"Testing the BLONEX B0DHGTZ9QG daily has been an intriguing experience. From the moment I started unpacking the product, I could sense it was built with the average household cleaner in mind. Equipped with its striking combination of LED headlights, a water sprayer, adjustable tube, and cordless design, this electric spin floor mop aims to transform a boring chore into something a bit more tolerable. It‚Äôs marketed as versatile enough for various types of flooring, promising efficiency and convenience, though it‚Äôs not without its quirks.

**Innovative Design Features**  
What immediately caught my eye was the compact yet functional design. The adjustable tube, extendable up to 43 inches, makes it both ergonomic and user-friendly for anyone, regardless of height. I often find that many cleaning tools strain my back after extended use, but this mop seems to have been designed to counter such issues. The LED headlights are a surprisingly handy feature; they illuminate dark corners under furniture, showing just how gross your ‚Äúclean‚Äù floor really is. Coupled with a generously sized 290ml water tank, it makes tackling hidden grime that much easier.  

[Time to see BLONEX B0DHGTZ9QG cost on Amazon.](https://info.senaar.com/p/b0dhgtz9qg/)  

**Performance and Cleaning Efficiency**  
The dual-motor mechanism, spinning at 160 RPM, is nothing short of a game-changer. I ran this mop over muddy sneaker trails in the hallway and even some dried coffee spills in the kitchen, and it powered through every stain effortlessly. The self-propelling feature meant less physical effort on my part, which anyone who despises scrubbing will undoubtedly appreciate. During one particularly chaotic family gathering, I managed to clean the mess on both tile and hardwood floors without any damage to the surfaces. The impressive battery life was also notable. With a 2000mAh battery, I was able to clean over 2000 sq. ft. on a single charge, lasting approximately 45 minutes.

**Key Benefits**  
- Self-propelling mechanism that minimizes strain during cleaning  
- Precision LED headlights illuminate dark corners or low-visibility areas  
- Dual-motor system efficiently tackles stubborn messes  
- Adjustable, user-friendly tube length for better comfort  
- 290ml water tank minimizes interruptions for refills  

**Hiccups and Areas for Improvement**  
Despite its advanced features, the electric mop isn‚Äôt completely flawless. The water sprayer dispenses well but lacks some precision. I found it hard to avoid over-wetting certain areas at first until I got used to the timing. Additionally, while the mop handles dirt exceptionally well, it struggles a bit with tougher, stickier grime spots like dried syrup. Another minor issue is the noise level. Though not overly disruptive, it‚Äôs audible enough for pets to scurry away every time it‚Äôs switched on.

**Caveats**  
- The water spray tends to over-wet areas without careful control  
- Slight struggle with removing extremely stubborn, sticky stains  
- Noise level may be unsettling for pets or light sleepers  

**Peer Products**  
Comparing this to other electric mops like the Bissell SpinWave or Shark Steam Mop, a few differences stand out. While the SpinWave boasts a strong mopping performance with similar dual-spinning technology, it falls short on battery duration, so the BLONEX excels in efficiency over large spaces. The Shark Steam Mop, on the other hand, has great sanitization capabilities due to its steam function, but it lacks the versatility and self-propelling feature that this mop offers. For someone like me who prioritizes convenience and tackling everyday messes swiftly, the BLONEX holds its own in the midrange electric mop market.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Is this mop worth the investment? Considering its features, battery life, and capacity to clean multiple floor types, I‚Äôd argue it provides excellent value for someone in a midsized household. While some alternatives might offer more advanced cleaning options like steam, they also cost significantly more. BLONEX seems to strike a good balance between price and utility, making it a smart purchase for households in need of efficient, no-frills cleaning.

I've recently been getting up early and having a morning routine, and all of those things have been coming really effortlessly. I've realised that the difference is momentum. 

So when I get up I start doing things straight away (shower, taking my dog out, coffee, etc) and each thing I do leads into something else. When I have this flow, even if I'm tired that day its alot easier to keep doing things. But I've noticed if I stop/get distracted throughout the day its really hard to get motivation to keep going. 

So now, if I have an interruption in my day, even if it feels really hard to get back into what I was doing I just start with something small and then slowly the momentum and motivation comes back.",1,1756245573.0,productivity,0,1.0,False

I was prescribed buproprion SR for smoking cessation, I took a single 150 mg dose on Sunday,  10:13am (8/24).

I felt fine most of the day, had a BP of 111/80 early in the evening. I went to sleep around 11pm, but woke up at 1245am. I felt a pressure in my left eye, dizzy, and had a headache. I checked my blood pressure and it was 124/85. I  had some water and laid down for 20ish minutes thinking it would go back down, instead it went up to 134/96. So I went to the ER, they checked me in with BP at 140/79. I was put in a room, and about 20 minutes after that they took my blood pressure again and it was 138/90. Doctor came in, asked if I had a history, how long I was taking the med for, checked my pupils, etc. He said I would be okay, don‚Äôt take the bupoprion again, and said he‚Äôd get me Tylenol for the headache I had from my BP.

Now, poor staff was absolutely slammed with patients, so if there was supposed to be another check in I wouldn‚Äôt know. Nurse finally got to me for discharge quarter to 3am. She gave me the Tylenol and checked my blood pressure again, 126/68. She said it wasn‚Äôt great but it was clearly going down.

So, I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll be fine, exhausted but fine. Now, Monday I felt off but I figured it was the lack of sleep and left work early. I had a short nap around 4, felt fine. Around 8pm, I felt my blood pressure going up again, same as the night before. I just laid back and tried to relax assuming I would be fine, and it started to go away. Then, it came back again around 1030pm. It went away after an hour, but I kept waking up every few hours with that same feeling of my blood pressure elevating. I didn‚Äôt check it because it was mostly the thrumming in my ears and a headache. I figured if I had any other symptoms then I‚Äôd check it, but nothing else developed.

Now, I‚Äôm not the healthiest person at all, obviously, but I‚Äôve never had symptoms of elevated BP for days at a time, nor has it been easy to raise it back to back. I‚Äôm actually healthier these past few days off fear alone - took me 2 1/2 days to finish a pack of cigarettes versus the 1 pack a day. I haven‚Äôt had any espresso drinks since Sunday, and usually I have 1 every day AND a regular coffee later in the day. But I‚Äôve only had a single 16oz cup of cold brew a day yesterday and today. I‚Äôm trying to drink 100oz of water daily, and have been for months, I usually only fall a couple oz short here and there. 

Yet today, I‚Äôm still having symptoms of elevated blood pressure, still not as severe but the headache and thrumming in ears.

Basically I want to know - what the fuck is going on? Is this normal after 1 single dose of this medication even though I never took it again? Is this just anxiety worse than I‚Äôve ever had it? Is there something I can do or ask for? How long could I be dealing with this for?

Vault Survivors is a post-apocalyptic action roguelike that combines the frantic gameplay of Vampire Survivors with deep narrative elements and meaningful character progression.

**The Story**

You play as Lucy, awakening from cryogenic sleep in an underground vault after a nuclear catastrophe has rendered the surface uninhabitable. Guided by an robot named Azazel, you must venture into the wasteland to collect genetic material from mutated creatures and work toward rebuilding human civilization. The deeper you go, the more you'll uncover about what really happened to the world and your role in its future. Without spoiling anything, let's just say not everything is as it initially appears.

**Gameplay**

The core loop revolves around surviving increasingly intense waves of mutants while your weapons automatically target enemies around you. Between runs, you return to your vault hub where you can upgrade your gear, unlock new weapons, and engage in dialogue sequences that reveal more of the story. The vault serves as both your safe haven and the primary vehicle for narrative progression.

**Content**

* 30+ unique weapons, each with 7 upgrade tiers
* 10+ different enemy types ranging from basic ghouls to enemies with different gimmicks
* 3 maps with their own challenges
* Multiple difficulty modes for different player skill levels
* 3 playable characters, each with unique starting loadouts and backstories

Vault Survivors is a post-apocalyptic action roguelike that combines the frantic gameplay of Vampire Survivors with deep narrative elements and meaningful character progression.

**The Story**

You play as Lucy, awakening from cryogenic sleep in an underground vault after a nuclear catastrophe has rendered the surface uninhabitable. Guided by an robot named Azazel, you must venture into the wasteland to collect genetic material from mutated creatures and work toward rebuilding human civilization. The deeper you go, the more you'll uncover about what really happened to the world and your role in its future. Without spoiling anything, let's just say not everything is as it initially appears.

**Gameplay**

The core loop revolves around surviving increasingly intense waves of mutants while your weapons automatically target enemies around you. Between runs, you return to your vault hub where you can upgrade your gear, unlock new weapons, and engage in dialogue sequences that reveal more of the story. The vault serves as both your safe haven and the primary vehicle for narrative progression.

**Content**

* 30+ unique weapons, each with 7 upgrade tiers
* 10+ different enemy types ranging from basic ghouls to enemies with different gimmicks
* 3 maps with their own challenges
* Multiple difficulty modes for different player skill levels
* 3 playable characters, each with unique starting loadouts and backstories
* Dozens of dialogues that reveal lore
* Extensive achievement system that unlocks new weapons and content

The demo gives you access to the first map and enough content to get a real feel for both the combat mechanics and story direction. I've put a lot of effort into making sure the narrative actually matters rather than just being window dressing for the action.

The Rookie:


Eva Rostova sat at her desk, drowning in busywork. Her internship had started a month ago, and the initial thrill had long since curdled into the grim reality of endless paperwork. A headache pulsed behind her eyes. 


She leaned back in her chair, an annoyed huff escaping her lips as she glared at the piles of datapads. She swore they grew bigger every time she looked away. Blearily, she pressed the heels of her palms to her eyes, which were dry from hours of staring at bureaucratic text.


In the corner, her mint-green droid, Brenda, sat quietly, monitoring Eva‚Äôs schedule and incoming communications. A small blessing in this administrative hellscape. Eva reached for her long-forgotten mug of coffee, only to knock it over, watching sadly as the cold, black liquid stained and spread across the last five hours of her work.

Eva stared at the now-empty, ice-cold mug. Getting up, she walked across the hall to her supervisor's empty office. In a fit of pure pettiness, she poured the dregs of her ruined coffee onto the sad-looking potted fern on his desk. The fern seemed to suspiciously perk up.


Feeling marginally better, she returned to her office and was just settling down to clean the mess when, suddenly, the alarms began to blare.


Eva jumped up, looking around frantically before making a dash to the official communications console. The blood drained from her face. Brenda glided silently along behind her. A quick beep, and then her synthesized voice announced, ""Eva, I have received new-""


""I see it, Brenda!"" Eva waved her hand dismissively, her eyes glued to the main screen. ""Aliens,"" she whispered to herself, before letting out a loud, giddy whoop and doing a little dance. Then, reality hit her like a semi-truck. ""Oh, shit. Oh, shit.""

Eva began to frantically tap at the screens, sending out messages to her boss, her boss's boss, the Director-General of the Terran Confederacy‚Äîanyone. Every single one bounced back with an automated ""out of office"" reply.


""I need an adult,"" she wailed, sinking down to the floor and hugging her knees, trying desperately not to go into the middle of her very reasonable, diplomatic panic attack.


Brenda chimed again, displaying an official, high-priority directive on the main screen. It stated, in no uncertain terms, that due to the senior staff's unavailability at a mandatory team-building retreat, command authority for the First Contact mission now defaulted to the highest-ranking official on-site: Specialist Eva Rostova
.

Brenda beeped. ""Congratulations on your promotion, Specialist Rostova. ^_^""


""Thanks, I think,"" Eva mumbled, her voice shaking. She struggled to stand, holding onto the console for support.


""You have,"" Brenda added, her voice perfectly flat, ""forty-five standard minutes to assemble your crew and depart.""",1,1756244794.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

2 years ago, I had a very stressful phase in my life. 

I loaded myself on caffeine to keep up with work. cigarettes and a lot of vape to deal with stress. 
Couple of weeks on this mad man lifestyle, I suddenly had severe joint pain and muscle stiffness in my legs. 

I went through every single test - blood, rheum physicals, x rays etc. everything was negative and no swelling or anything. Just pain.
I thought it was all in my head as it went away when the stress left. I came across what was fibromyalgia to be the only explanation.

After a few months, I had the most scariest episode - I was having coffee in my local cafe and i felt a skipped best and my anxiety shot through the roof as the HR was uncontrollable. 

I went to the ER - they did every test possible again with echo, ecg, brain mri , TMT, bloodwork. And nothing!

One doctor just asked to to take clonazepalm and that worked like a charm. Never had the palpitations. Until ofcouse if I have any stimulant and it goes up again like crazy.

From the last 1 year , I had post meal crashes. Brain fog, insane amount of thirst, trachycadia that doesn't go down even with clonazepalm, lathargy, headache. It's almost like i can't even walk after a meal.

but my symptoms go away after 3-4 hours and I'm brand new. No issues and full of energy. The only problem is that this crash has been progressive. It's becoming worse and much more that 3-4 hours until I have some cold water or like 4 liters of regular water. 

Now I started getting the same tingles and stiffness I had before along with my crashes. 

I don't know what to do. I'm fed up of running around hospitals and doctors who can't seem to think there is  something real. 

I recently took it on myself to test my blood sugar regularly and even though the blood work shows normal, the 1 hour spike is very high and chatgpt says I'm fucked because that's neuropathic dysauttonomy SFN. 


I wish I was not able to eat ever again. I wish I didn't have this constant fear of death. I wish I was normal.

For example, the one gluten-free bakery in Honolulu switched to cake orders only, another wasn't even a bakery like their Google maps listing claimed but rather just their muffins were sold inside a different coffee shop business. 

Many places are only open for a few hours once a week and when you show up, oops, they're on vacation. This has happened every time we visit.

## üçç Ordering in Hawai'i üçç

Going to Hawai'i as a Celiac means eating at restaurants that have a shared kitchen if you won't have your own kitchen at your hotel. If not you'll be eating fruit and chips only. It means emailing the lu'au weeks ahead of time so that they'll make you a plate before others are served from the buffet. It means being the first one in the restaurant when it opens so that you can ensure a most likely clean grill. It means disclosing ""Celiac disease"" every single time you eat - not gluten-free, not ""gluten-allergy."" Celiac disease. Staff treat it differently when they hear celiac disease.

From the time that I walked in to the time I got my steak at Zippy's, it was 47 minutes. They took my celiac seriously and rewashed all their tools and cleaned their grill when I told them I had celiac disease. I ordered after looking at their allergen list on their website. 

## üå¥ Beware of Hidden Gluten üå¥

Hawaiian food is heavily influenced by Japanese and Portugal cuisines. There is gluten in everything and you have to check not only for wheat, but also sneaky sources like barley malt in cocktails. Just know that luckily, you can find some desserts that are made with rice flour rather than wheat flour, which is a bonus. It's also the only place in the US where you can eat McDonald's Hawaiian breakfast as Spam, Portuguese sausage, eggs and plain rice are all gluten-free. 

## üêö Know What You're Talking About üêö

For Hawai'i, you're not going to get much in the way of marked celiac-safe options or dedicated restaurants, so you have to know what is and isn't gluten-free ahead of time to ask more questions if you come across ""gluten-free"" on their menu. Chowmein isn't going to be gluten-free but poi will be. Another example, Ululani's shave ice is gluten-free but their ice cream supplier Roselani isn't, so you can't add ice cream to your shave ice. Sit and look up suppliers before going ahead and ordering if you're unsure about packaged foods.

(At Aulani, Tikis, Ululani's, the grocery stores and Waiahole Poi Factory, the food pictured was shared with my husband - this isn't all food that was only for me. The iced coffee at McDonald's was ordered through their app for their daily $1 coffee deal. I went to Aunty Pat's 3x in 2 days at Kualoa Ranch.)

1n0ygqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/northernireland/comments/1n0ygqk/long_lost_family_funeral_final_update/,Long lost family funeral final update.,"Thanks for the therapy, you lot are some crack. 

So hope on for the final leg of the story. 

I got on a bus at 2:50am to catch a 6:30 flight to the funeral. All went like clockwork, except for me spilling lukewarm airport coffee down myself. Thankfully, black funeral attire doubles as a very practical stain camouflage.

Made it through security, we bit of window shopping. Nothing note worthy. I landed, picked up the rental car. Correction, picked up a matchbox on wheels. I‚Äôd booked a mini SUV. They ‚Äúforgot to charge it,‚Äù so I got whatever was left in the car park. Then I promptly got lost leaving the airport, shouted at the satnav for its delayed instructions and poxy accent. It took an hour to do a thirty-minute trip. And don‚Äôt start me on lane assist that I had no idea how to turn off. So just for some visual context if you old enough think  National Lampoon's European Vacation only with added grief.

So, I turned up at the funeral expecting to be the mysterious character nobody saw coming.
Instead? I slipped into the back pew, head down, and said nothing.
When I finally opened my mouth, someone clocked the accent: ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre from Ireland, how do u know ‚Äòdead person‚Äô?‚Äù
Cue me mumbling because, honestly, I wasn‚Äôt sure who knew I was coming apart from my cousins. 

Turns out the whole family knew I was coming. I mean 2nd cousins twice removed type people. The Irish family even got a mention in the eulogy, my cousin looked right at me when he said it, even though we‚Äôd never met before.  That was when the first tear fell. 


My grand entrance? About as dramatic as a trip to your local Eurospar on 740 on a Wednesday night.


That‚Äôs not to say it wasn‚Äôt surreal. There I was, sitting with about thirty people who all shared the same dna as my dad, the family he spent his whole life searching for, and the only person who would have fully appreciated the madness of it all was him. Typical.


After the service, I was let‚Äôs say tired and a tad emotional (exhausted). The way they described my aunt  she didn‚Äôt sound like a stranger. She sounded like someone I already knew. Then one cousin came right up to me, smiling: ‚ÄúYou look so much like Nana. Oh God, it‚Äôs Nana‚Äôs face on a stranger‚Äôs body.‚Äù
No whispers of ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs she?‚Äù. No dramatic slow piano. No ITV reveal moment. Just a funeral, and the absurdity of meeting half your family for the first time over a mass booklet.


Netflix season one cliffhanger? Absolutely not. Did everything fall into place? Nope. But was there something? Aye.


The return journey was mercifully uneventful, no coffee spills this time.

So that‚Äôs that. 


I‚Äôve written these posts as a way to deal with what‚Äôs been happening. While I‚Äôve tried to be light-hearted, it was pretty intense. It did feel like a weight was lifted, maybe just the relief of getting there, maybe the sense that something had come full circle.


I do believe there‚Äôs something after life. I‚Äôll call it heaven. I believe Daddy, his sister, and his mum are there now, catching up on lost time. And when you die, I think you split into pieces and go to the places your soul was missing here. So maybe those missing pieces have finally fallen into place for the three of them.

RIP Auntie

1n0ye12,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1n0ye12/does_fanativita_jtp5501_really_improve_coffee/,Does Fanativita JTP-5501 Really Improve Coffee Quality Review of Keurig Water Filters?,"The Fanativita JTP-5501 Premium 6-Pack Keurig Compatible Water Filters caught my attention for its promise of compatibility with a variety of Keurig machines and its focus on providing superbly filtered water for coffee lovers. As someone who can‚Äôt start a day without my cup of caffeine, I was curious to see if these replacement filters would enhance the flavor of my morning brew and contribute to the health of my trusty coffee maker. Spoiler alert: it definitely made a positive impression. Still, there‚Äôs a little more to the story!

**Universal Fit for Every Keurig Brewer**

What stands out most in these filters is their convenience. They are advertised as universally compatible with Keurig coffee makers‚Äîfrom the K-Slim to the K-Duo and everything in between. Testing this claim, I found it true. Whether at home on my older Keurig Classic or in my office using the newer K-Supreme, these filters slotted into the water reservoir handles without a hitch. Knowing it covered even the Keurig 2.0 and 1.0 Series made gifting them even easier for my family‚Äôs various brewers. No one was left out of the equation! 

[Grab Fanativita JTP-5501 coffee filters at the best price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0cb6vr5c3/)

**Top-Notch Filter Material**

These filters boast organic coconut shell activated charcoal, certified by NSF standards. Seeing ""organic coconut shell"" might sound gimmicky to some, but I noticed an actual difference with water taste compared to cheaper filters I‚Äôve used in the past. They effectively removed impurities, calcium deposits, and even chlorine odors that sometimes sneak their way into tap water. Knowing that they also reduce limescale to protect the longevity of my coffee maker sealed the deal for me. My machine, which is temperamental when it comes to hard water, also seemed to perform more consistently.

**User-Friendly Installation Process**

Swapping out the cartridges couldn‚Äôt have been simpler. All it took was a quick rinse under cold water and snapping them into the Keurig filter housing. Done in seconds, no fuss or frustration. I swapped the filter every two months, though for households with heavier coffee drinkers, once a month might make more sense. This kind of customization ensures that you‚Äôre not wasting money or resources on premature replacements.

**Design and Packaging Quality**

The filters are individually packaged, which kept them in top-notch shape during storage. I appreciated how dust-free and clean they were coming straight out of the box. The sturdy packaging box made it easy to store the extras without cluttering up my cabinet. They even make for a decent last-minute gift add-on for the coffee enthusiast in your life‚Äîpractical and tidy enough to impress!

**Merits**

- Universal compatibility with virtually every Keurig model.
- High-quality coconut shell activated charcoal that improves water taste and removes harmful impurities.
- Effortless installation and quick filter changes.
- Dust-free, individually packaged filters ensure cleanliness and longevity.
- Comes in a one-year supply, offering excellent convenience.

**Drawbacks**

- These filters are catered exclusively for Keurig brewers, so folks using other coffee brands might feel left out.
- While the packaging is neat and protective, I felt slightly guilty contributing to more single-use materials.
- No included filter holder; you need to have the original Keurig one already.

**Rival Brands**

Comparing these filters with other industry competitors‚Äîlike K&J or Maxware‚Äîthe clear advantages are the better-tasting water and convenience. While both brands also claim to use activated charcoal, the difference in water clarity and taste was noticeable when tested back-to-back. On the downside, brands like Maxware include the filter holder in some bundles, which could be useful for new Keurig owners. Fanativita doesn‚Äôt include that option, which might add an extra step for certain people. However, Fanativita‚Äôs focus on durability and dust-free processing gives it a slight edge over those competitors.

**Value for Money**

Priced for a one-year supply, these filters feel like a solid investment for regular coffee drinkers. Thoughtfully designed and effective in their function, they save you from running to the coffee shop because your at-home cups aren‚Äôt quite cutting it. While the upfront cost might seem slightly higher than some off-brand options, their longevity and enhanced performance balance that out over time.

Title: The Hidden Truth of the Jedi Temple Archives

  
The Jedi Temple Archives have always been a treasure trove of knowledge, housing countless artifacts and records that chronicle the history of the galaxy far, far away. But what if there was more to these archives than meets the eye? What if they held secrets so powerful that even the most enlightened Jedi Masters would be unable to resist their allure?

  
In this theory, I propose that within the depths of the Jedi Temple Archives lies a hidden truth ‚Äì one that could change everything we know about the Force and its users. This secret is not just any ordinary piece of information; it's an ancient artifact known as the ""Key to the Unseen.""

  
The Key to the Unseen is said to be a powerful relic, capable of unlocking hidden dimensions within the Force itself. It was believed to have been created by an ancient order of Jedi who sought to harness the full potential of their powers without being bound by the limitations imposed upon them by the Council.

  
According to legend, this key can grant its possessor access to a realm beyond our own ‚Äì one where time and space are malleable, and reality itself is but an illusion. This dimension is said to be home to countless versions of oneself, each representing different choices made throughout their lives. It's here that the true nature of the Force can be understood, as it exists outside the confines of our physical world.

  
The existence of this key has been kept a secret for centuries, hidden away in the bowels of the Jedi Temple Archives. Only a select few have ever laid eyes on it ‚Äì those who dared to venture beyond the boundaries set forth by the Council. Among them was Master Yoda himself, who used its power sparingly due to its immense danger.

  
The implications of this theory are staggering. If true, then the Jedi Temple Archives hold within their walls a secret that could change everything we know about the Force and our place in it. It would mean that there is more to the Force than meets the eye ‚Äì that it exists beyond our understanding and can be manipulated in ways we never imagined possible.

  
This hidden truth has been kept under wraps for generations, but how long will it remain so? With each passing day, new threats emerge from every corner of the galaxy, threatening everything we hold dear. In times like these, knowledge is power ‚Äì and knowing the true nature of the Force could mean the difference between victory and defeat.

  
As fans of Star Wars, we must ask ourselves: are we ready to face the truth? Can we handle the weight of such powerful knowledge? Only time will tell if this hidden secret remains buried forever or if it shall rise once more to change the course of history itself.

Alright, let's talk about Print on Demand.

You've seen the YouTube ads. The ones with the guy on a beach showing his ""passive income"" from selling t-shirts. It seems too good to be true, right?

Well, I finally jumped in a few months ago. I'm not on a beach (I'm at my kitchen table), but I¬†*have*¬†learned a ton. I'm not here to sell you a course‚ÄîI'm just here to give you the real, unglamorous scoop.

Here‚Äôs what I wish I knew before I started:

**1. The ""Print"" part is easy. The ""Demand"" part is the actual job.**  
Setting up a store on Redbubble or opening a Shopify store with Printful is stupid simple. The real work is¬†**market research**. You can't just make a shirt with a pun you think is funny and expect it to sell. You have to find a niche that actually buys stuff. Think ""Beagle Lovers who love coffee"" not just ""Dog People.""

**2. Your designs are probably not enough.**  
This was a tough pill to swallow. The internet is flooded with designs. What makes yours special? It's not just about being a good artist; it's about solving a problem or nailing an inside joke for a specific group. Text-based designs often outperform intricate art for this exact reason.

**3. This is not ""passive income."" It's a slow burn.**  
For the first month, I made exactly $0. It was discouraging. Then I made one sale. Then two. It's a grind of constantly tweaking designs, titles, and tags based on what little data you get. You have to treat it like a real business, not a lottery ticket.

**The Good Parts (Because there are some!):**

* **True $0 Risk:**¬†You don't buy inventory. If a design flops, you're out time, not money.
* **Incredibly Creative:**¬†It forces you to think like a marketer and an artist. It's a fun puzzle.
* **That First Sale Feeling:**¬†Hitting that "" cha-ching!"" notification is pure dopamine. It's proof that a stranger somewhere in the world valued your creation enough to buy it.

**My Verdict:**

POD is a legit side hustle, but¬†**only if you go in with the right expectations.**¬†Don't expect to get rich. Do expect to learn a ton about digital marketing, niches, and SEO.

If you're a creative person who doesn't mind doing deep research and can handle delayed gratification, it's worth a shot. If you're looking for quick cash, run away.",1,1756242878.0,NextLevelIncome,0,1.0,False
1n0y4kx,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1n0y4kx/cravings_arent_real_needs_dopamine_glitch/,Cravings aren‚Äôt real needs (dopamine glitch explained),"Hi my name is Daniel and I smoked for over 12 years and have now been smoke free for over 6. 

Here‚Äôs the thing. Cravings feel real. Like your body is saying I need a cigarette right now or I‚Äôll lose it. But biologically that isn‚Äôt true.

What‚Äôs happening is basically a dopamine glitch. Nicotine spikes dopamine, your brain adapts, and then your natural dopamine dips. When that dip happens your brain sends a false alarm that feels like a need for a cigarette. It‚Äôs not a survival need like food or oxygen. It‚Äôs withdrawal discomfort.

The interesting part is that whether you smoke or not the craving always passes. It rises, peaks, and fades like a wave. Lighting up just restarts the cycle.

Once you see cravings this way everything changes. You realize you‚Äôre not giving up anything. You‚Äôre just breaking free from a false signal your brain has been sending.

I smoked for over 12 years and this shift in perspective helped me quit for good. Cravings aren‚Äôt needs. They‚Äôre noise.

For anyone here who‚Äôs quitting, when do cravings hit you the hardest? Morning coffee, stress, or being around other smokers?",12,1756242877.0,stopsmoking,2,1.0,False

My background: Came to the US on an F-1 student visa in 2016, graduated college in 2021.
Received my OPT August 2021 and it expired a year later in 2022. Due to special circumstances at that time I overstayed my visa. It‚Äôs been a rollercoaster since until I‚Äôve met my husband and got married in July 2024.

August 21, 2025 - I-485 ‚ÄúCard was produced‚Äù 
August 25, 2025 - Green Card Received 

Almost three years exactly since my overstay I got green card in hand and it still feels surreal. 

The process went relatively smooth for us, no RFEs. We‚Äôve been putting all the documents together and filing forms with no lawyer. Huge help was the YouTube channel of Kseniya International, I practically filled every single form  and collected evidence watching her step-by-step guides. So grateful, her videos are gold. 

The interview was re-scheduled due to ICE protests just a couple of days before the original date. We‚Äôve got a new date exactly a month later. 

I had an arrest back in 2017, case was dismissed and sealed. When I had my last F-1 visa interview at the embassy in 2020, I‚Äôve been asked to provide court records. I was granted a visa a week later after providing the documents. This time, I have disclosed my arrest in I-485 form and gave a written explanation of what happened. Also, submitted a copy of court disposition. 

Our interview went well. We were called 40 min later than original call time. The officer was friendly and made us feel comfortable from the beginning. He asked us to answer the same question separately. He‚Äôd say a question and then direct it to my husband first and then to me and visa versa. He was typing every answer in his computer occasionally asking us to slow down or repeat what we‚Äôve said. He barely looked at us but sometimes he‚Äôd ask a question and immediately look at me with this piercing gaze so I knew he was studying my reactions. He asked us a couple same questions twice - just in a different form. Like, as soon as we walked in, he asked if we had breakfast today. And we said no, we just had coffee. And then twenty minutes later , when on complete different topic, he asked: ‚ÄúSo you didn‚Äôt have breakfast, no coffee today?‚Äù And I said: ‚ÄúNo, we had coffee today.‚Äù Things like that just bring you back to reality of this person not being just somebody you have a pleasant talk with but a government official who watches you. But he was nice and it was a relief. 

He asked us: 

Who proposed? 
Where?
What did you say when you proposed? 
Did you give a ring? 
When did you get married? 
Where? 
Who was in the wedding? 
How did you meet? 
What do you see from our bedroom‚Äôs window? 
What do you have hanging on the walls? 
How many windows do you have? 
What side of the bed do you sleep on? 
What was your last fight about? 
Describe your marriage. 
Describe your spouse. 

Then, I-485 yes/no questions. I answered ‚Äòyes‚Äô on overstaying - he didn‚Äôt ask me much about it. Answered ‚Äòyes‚Äô on working without authorization. He didn‚Äôt ask about it. 
Answered ‚Äòyes‚Äô to being arrested before. 

We stayed around 30 min on this topic - he asked me to tell him exactly what happened, I have him court disposition original - he scanned it. I didn‚Äôt have police records with me, he told me that he‚Äôd have to check the information on this arrest and the court disposition could be enough. 

We received a paper stating that they can‚Äôt make decision yet but don‚Äôt need any additional info from us at this time and we not make any moves before 120 days mark. 

I ordered arrest records from the court but I -485 got approved earlier than I received them. For anyone who needs to know - you‚Äôve got to have anything and everything you can get on your arrest, with a full description of all the events. 

The whole process felt like confession to a priest after troubles and fears of the overstay experience. I‚Äôm glad to be typing this right now. And now it feels like now it all just begins. Feeling like I‚Äôm 18 again just landing in the US with excitement and hopes. 

Wishing you all strength and patience and luck. You got this! ‚ô•Ô∏è

1n0xx6g,https://i.redd.it/zimes997iflf1.png,Demo is now live for Vault Survivors - My solo dev project that's been 1+ years in the making!,"After countless late nights and way too much coffee, I'm finally ready to share what I've been working on. Vault Survivors is a post-apocalyptic action roguelike that combines the frantic gameplay of Vampire Survivors with deep narrative elements and meaningful character progression.

**The Story** 

You play as Lucy, awakening from cryogenic sleep in an underground vault after a nuclear catastrophe has rendered the surface uninhabitable. Guided by an robot named Azazel, you must venture into the wasteland to collect genetic material from mutated creatures and work toward rebuilding human civilization. The deeper you go, the more you'll uncover about what really happened to the world and your role in its future. Without spoiling anything, let's just say not everything is as it initially appears.

**Gameplay** 

The core loop revolves around surviving increasingly intense waves of mutants while your weapons automatically target enemies around you. Between runs, you return to your vault hub where you can upgrade your gear, unlock new weapons, and engage in dialogue sequences that reveal more of the story. The vault serves as both your safe haven and the primary vehicle for narrative progression.

**Content**

* 30+ unique weapons, each with 7 upgrade tiers
* 10+ different enemy types ranging from basic ghouls to enemies with different gimmicks
* 3 maps with their own challenges
* Multiple difficulty modes for different player skill levels
* 3 playable characters, each with unique starting loadouts and backstories
* Dozens of dialogues that reveal lore
* Extensive achievement system that unlocks new weapons and content

The demo gives you access to the first map and enough content to get a real feel for both the combat mechanics and story direction. I've put a lot of effort into making sure the narrative actually matters rather than just being window dressing for the action.

Steam page is live and I'd love to hear what you think! This has been a massive learning experience as my first major solo project.

1n0xw6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscifistories/comments/1n0xw6k/the_tezcat_apparatus/,The Tezcat Apparatus,"The device that the salesman had out on the coffee table in Zachary‚Äôs living room looked like someone had taken the mechanical movement from the guts of a music box and drilled it sideways into a miniature model of an old-fashioned phone booth. An LCD screen was mounted to the exterior housing.

‚ÄúHow does it keep critters out of the garden?‚Äù Zachary asked.

The grandfatherly salesman wore a curious wardrobe; filthy sneakers below a Nehru suit, and black sunglasses too small to properly conceal cataracted eyes. He also wore a glove on his right hand, with the two middle sheaths sewn shut where those fingers were obviously missing.

He told Zachary, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a combination of sonic deterrence and pattern recognition. If the animal doesn‚Äôt bother with what you‚Äôre growing, the Tezcat Apparatus will leave the animal alone. But if the animal goes nosing for carrots in your furrows, the Apparatus will deter them from doing it again.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt looks expensive,‚Äù Zachary said, reaching toward the brassy gold hardware along the hinges. He was drawn to glittering appertunance in the way of a magpie.

‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt touch that,‚Äù the salesman said, though he didn‚Äôt seem to be looking at Zachary or the Apparatus‚ÄîZachary was almost certain that the man was blind. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt recommend premature physical contact with the Apparatus.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy? Is it dangerous?‚Äù

The salesman visibly restrained himself from frowning. ‚ÄúNo, but it is a sensitive device. It‚Äôs been carefully calibrated. The Apparatus is a model of mechanical and computational durability, but fiddling with it before placement affects its pattern recognition. It‚Äôs best not to touch it until it‚Äôs been mounted and activated.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoes it work?‚Äù

‚ÄúMost assuredly, sir,‚Äù the salesman said. ‚ÄúOur other test customers have reported a one-hundred percent reduction in invasive destruction. Most have elected to keep the Apparatus in place after the trial period.‚Äù

‚ÄúTest customers? What does that mean?‚Äù Zachary raised an eyebrow.

‚ÄúYes, sir. I should have been clearer. You see, the Tezcat Apparatus is not readily available for purchase by the public. You have been selected as one of the domiciliary testing sites. If you‚Äôre interested, of course.‚Äù

Zachary nodded and clicked his teeth with his tongue. He took a sip of his coffee as he mulled it over. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôd sure like to keep those goddamn ground squirrels and jackrabbits out of my root veggies,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHow much does it cost?‚Äù

The salesman knowingly smiled. ‚ÄúWe provide it to you at no cost. Maintenance and repairs are free, as well. We just ask to be able to regularly check the Apparatus so we can make updates and log functionality, to improve the product before it‚Äôs available to the public-at-large.‚Äù

‚ÄúFree, huh?‚Äù Zachary smiled.

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt get no better than that.‚Äù

The salesman grinned; he was closing the deal. ‚ÄúNo, sir, you cannot.‚Äù

‚ÄúShit,‚Äù Zachary said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take it.‚Äù

‚Ä¢

Zachary sipped his morning coffee as he watched a jackrabbit lope and sniff around his patch of rutabagas. He kept looking back and forth between the Apparatus mounted on the wood pole and the jackrabbit sniffing at the plants.

‚ÄúGoddamnit,‚Äù he said in a grumbling complaint, ‚Äúdo something.‚Äù

An array of green dots suddenly projected from the Apparatus and swept down over the jackrabbit. As the jackrabbit stumbled and rolled onto its back, Zachary twitched a little and tucked his chin into his neck in surprise.

He went outside and looked at the varmint, nudged it with the tip of his shoe. The jackrabbit leapt up, startling Zachary back so he spilled coffee on himself and yelled. ‚ÄúShit!‚Äù Then the fleet-footed hare took flight, bounding toward a wooded refuge of copses and brambles.

‚Ä¢

The same thing happened a few dozen more times‚Äîat least, that was the frequency with which Zachary witnessed, firsthand, the Apparatus bathe the bushy-tailed intruders in a shower of neon green light.

At the end of the week, Zachary‚Äôs doorbell rang. It was right around the time he‚Äôd scheduled the technician‚Äôs visit on the Tezcat app (and boy, wasn‚Äôt that convenient?). He opened the door and saw the old blind man in the Nehru suit and begrimed sneakers. The salesman was holding a large, empty duffelbag in one hand and a tablet in the other.

‚ÄúOh. It‚Äôs you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs me,‚Äù the salesman said, smiling. ‚ÄúI just wanted to make sure it‚Äôs okay to go around back and run diagnostics on the Apparatus.‚Äù

‚ÄúAbsolutely. You need me for anything?‚Äù

The salesman shook his head. ‚ÄúNo, no, sir. Everything‚Äôs well in hand.‚Äù

Zachary went to his window and watched the salesman enter his backyard. The salesman took out his touchscreen tablet and plugged it into the Tezcat Apparatus. Zachary saw on the Apparatus‚Äôs LCD display, which faced his window, as computer images of jackrabbits, squirrels, voles, coons, skunks and chipmunks ran in a sequence.

He watched in astonishment as a group of wild animals in a correspondingly exact species ratio gathered around the salesman. The salesman pressed a button on his tablet. All at once, the varmints keeled over, paws pointed heavenward. All of them, to a one, were surely dead.

The salesman walked around, picking up the dozens of animal carcasses and stuffing them in his duffelbag. It took him five minutes to finish cleaning up the dead bodies, at which point he departed Zachary‚Äôs backyard.

The doorbell rang again. Zachary went to his front door and opened it. The salesman was pulling off his right glove as Zachary opened the door‚ÄîZachary saw that the man was no longer missing his ring and middle finger.

‚ÄúAlright, sir, that‚Äôs it for the week,‚Äù the salesman said as he took his sunglasses off his face and tucked them in his suit‚Äôs outbreast pocket‚Äîhis eyes were perfectly clear, no evidence there‚Äôd ever been cataracts. ‚ÄúJust one last thing.‚Äù

i wanted to embrace my pure natural face a lot more and i'm proud to say that I haven't even touched any makeup since the beginning of summer but i feel even more beautiful :)

anyway i'm writing some simple random tips here that aren't makeup and made me look significantly better. maybe it can help someone out:

\- curling my eyelashes and using vaseline to hold them in place/clump them a bit (better than mascara!)

\- threading my brows thinner, bleaching them lighter by one shade, and holding them in place with vaseline (suited me more than darker thick brows)

\- quitting energy drinks and iced coffees (really hard, i used to not even go a day without one but i don't break out anymore)

\- cutting face framing bangs according to my face shape and styling them every few days with flatiron and using mousse to volumize hair a bit more

\- gua sha and icerolling on my nose and jawline (my nose is often quite swollen so this helped shrink it)

\- using k18 to repair my slightly heat damaged hair (significant improvement! expensive product but one i recommend investing in)

\- minimizing skincare to just panoxyl wash once a week which also improved my slight hyperpigmentation, light cleanser each night, sunscreen daily, and byoma toner or la roche posay moisturizer

\- dermablading (be careful because i heard it doesn't work well for everyone but i use the tinkle razors once a week all over my face and my skin is much smoother and cleaner looking)

\- brushing my lips with vaseline to exfoliate them twice a day (my lips are constantly cracked and whitish/brown colored, but this makes them more rosy and plump)

\- focusing on how i smelled (used eos fresh and cozy soap and lotion and tried new floral perfumes + supermilk in my hair from lush)

i hope this can help someone! some of these tips may seem very obvious but they didn't occur to me until this summer.",11,1756242235.0,vindictapoc,1,0.92,False

\
Alt text: Business people in professional meeting in a modern office.*\
Walking through the glass atrium of Bahrain Financial Harbour on a humid Thursday morning, I remember glancing out at the sea‚Äîwatching container trucks rumble across the distant King Fahd Causeway. Just the night before, I'd shared gahwa (traditional Bahraini coffee) with a Saudi partner at a majlis in Seef District. Those two scenes‚Äîthat constant, tangible connectivity‚Äîperfectly embody why so many companies choose Bahrain as their Gulf business springboard.\
\
The King Fahd Causeway isn‚Äôt just a bridge‚Äîit‚Äôs Bahrain‚Äôs lifeline for cross-border business, the artery that brings Saudi Arabia‚Äôs economic might within arm‚Äôs reach.\
\
Bahrain Company Formation: The King Fahd Causeway Effect\
The Physical Gateway: From Bahrain Bay to Dhahran\
Standing on the edge of Bahrain Bay, you can almost feel the pulse of regional commerce. The King Fahd Causeway, a 25-kilometer engineering marvel, links Manama directly to mainland Saudi Arabia. Every year, over 30 million vehicles cross this causeway (Reuters 2025), ferrying not only workers and tourists‚Äîbut also a huge share of Bahrain‚Äôs trade, services, and investment deals.\
\
90% of bilateral trade between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia moves via the Causeway\
1.7+ million Saudis visited Bahrain in Q1 2025 alone, supporting retail, F&B, and consulting sectors\
Customs clearance times for registered Bahrain-based companies are now under 2 hours (a recent procedural leap forward)\
\
This physical proximity is a cornerstone driver for Bahrain company formation. If you want to do business with‚Äîor in‚ÄîSaudi Arabia, being based in Bahrain with direct Causeway access gives you a daily operational advantage that Dubai, Muscat, or even Abu Dhabi simply can‚Äôt match.\
Why Bahrain? Regional Advantage Over UAE\
Importantly, while UAE free zones offer scale, Bahrain‚Äôs unique proximity and open border customs agreements with Saudi Arabia mean Bahraini LLCs or foreign-owned branches enjoy fast, cost-effective access to the GCC‚Äôs biggest single market.\
\
No corporate tax on most activities, unlike new 2025 UAE tax frameworks (Forbes Business)\
Lower cost of living and office space‚ÄîSeef District or Diplomatic Area offices can be 40% cheaper than Dubai equivalents\
100% foreign ownership allowed in most sectors (see here), including commercial trade and consulting\
\
Bahrain‚Äôs company formation ecosystem is purpose-built for international business growth, leveraging its direct land link to Saudi Arabia via the Causeway.\
Bahrain‚Äôs 2025 Business Environment: Data, Growth, and Opportunities\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, Bahrain Bay skyline with corporate towers.*\
According to the most recent analysis from Reuters and Forbes, Bahrain has surged as a regional business hub in 2025:\
\
GDP growth forecast: 4.3% for 2025, outpacing regional averages\
Foreign direct investment: Up 11% YoY, driven by logistics, finance, and IT\
Ease of doing business: Ranked top in GCC for foreign company setup speed and cost (Bahrain EDB)\
Bilateral trade with Saudi Arabia: $13.2 billion in 2024, expected to break $15b mark this year\
\
My own experience with setting up in the Bahrain Bay area highlights how investor-friendly the regulatory environment has become‚Äîwalk-in support at the EDB office, English-speaking staff, and streamlined eGovernment portals like Sijilat cut setup time by weeks compared to my early-2010s project in Abu Dhabi.\
How the King Fahd Causeway Directly Helps International Companies\
The Causeway does far more than move goods‚Äîit shrinks operational friction and brings Saudi Arabia's lucrative market within daily reach.\
Real-World Example: Trading Company\
A Bahrain-based trading firm (licenced in the Diplomatic Area) wins a contract with a Saudi client. Instead of waiting days for cross-border shipping and separate customs, the company can:\
\
Store inventory in warehouses 15 minutes from the Causeway\
Deliver to Dhahran/Dammam clients within hours\
Rapidly respond to Saudi market shifts with just-in-time supply\
\
Consulting & Services Sector Edge\
Bahraini consultancies, HR firms, and agencies routinely send staff into Saudi for day-long projects, returning that night. No need for expensive, time-consuming KSA branch registration if core operations remain in Bahrain‚Äîwith the Causeway, compliance stays simple, and costs drop dramatically.\
(A common challenge: arranging multi-entry Saudi business visas for staff. My solution? Work with a local Bahraini PRO service‚Äîlike those in Almoayyed Tower‚Äîto pre-process invitation letters and avoid embassy queues. One client slashed travel turnaround from 1 week to 2 days.)\
Choosing the Right Business Structure for Causeway-Powered Activity\
\
Alt text: Business structure and team collaboration in modern office.*\
Three structures dominate for cross-border activity:\
\
WLL (With Limited Liability): Most popular. 100% ownership for most activities, full operational rights (see more).\
Branch of Foreign Company: Ideal for banks, insurers, or multinationals needing brand continuity and direct Saudi client billing.\
Free Zone Company: Best for 0% customs duties on re-exports (details); recommended for logistics and e-commerce firms whose Saudi clients take delivery in Bahrain.\
\
Surprisingly, newer regulations in May 2025 allow for ‚ÄúSmart Warehousing‚Äù licenses. This means a trading WLL can now operate bonded warehouses within 5km of the Causeway, with real-time customs integration‚Äîcutting warehousing costs by 20-25% compared to standard options.\
Personal insight: Avoid the temptation to register a branch in Saudi unless really needed. Bahrain LLCs have more flexibility, lower ongoing costs, and easier banking. Plus, you avoid the Saudi Nitaqat labor quotas, which can be a massive compliance headache.\
\
Pro tip: Always check activity codes on Sijilat before choosing your structure. A minor mismatch can delay your Commercial Registration by weeks.\
\
Step-by-Step Money- and Time-Saving Guide: Bahrain Company Formation for Causeway-Driven Business\
1. Pre-check: Name and Activity Approval\
\
Search your exact business activity code via Sijilat portal.\
Reserve a unique company name (Arabic/English options required).\
Insider tip: For fastest approval, use a name with a clear commercial focus (‚ÄúBahrain Gulf Trade WLL‚Äù gets processed faster than ambiguous brands).\
\
2. Prepare Documents\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation, entrepreneur with paperwork.*\
\
Passport copies for all shareholders\
Proof of address (utility bill or lease in Bahrain)\
Business plan summary (for regulatory review if financial or regulated sector)\
Notarized board resolution (if parent/branch structure)\
\
Speed hint: Use local translation services in the Seef District‚Äîthey‚Äôll stamp English-Arabic docs within hours, avoiding ministry rejection delays.\
3. Submit via Sijilat\
\
All documentation must be uploaded digitally.\
Payment of initial fees (approx. BHD 100‚Äì250, varies by activity)\
Processing time: 2‚Äì5 working days for most activities.\
\
Optimal application timing: Submit Tues-Wed mornings. Mondays and weekend e-submissions often get queued behind a backlog. (I learned this the hard way‚Äîwaiting until Thursday cost me a precious week when the Commercial Registration reviewer was on leave.)\
4. Lease Commercial Office\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs, business budget and calculator.*\
\
Physical address required. Virtual offices permitted in some free zones but not for standard WLLs.\
Seef, Bahrain Bay, and Diplomatic Area offer best access to government, banks, and Causeway route.\
Budget: BHD 180‚Äì400/month for small offices; bigger floorplates range BHD 700‚Äì1,500.\
See up-to-date Bahrain company formation cost breakdown.\
\
5. Register at MOICT, LMRA, and Open Bank Account\
\
MOICT: Ministry of Industry, Commerce & Tourism\
LMRA: Labour Market Regulatory Authority‚Äîwork visas, staff permissions\
Bank: Leading local banks on Government Avenue understand international clients (try Al Salam or BBK in Diplomatic Area for English support)\
Estimated timeline: 4-10 working days after full documentation\
\
\
Frequent mistake: Waiting to open your bank account until after receiving all ministry approvals. Always start banking paperwork in parallel‚Äîyou‚Äôll save a week.\
\
6. Obtain Commercial Registration and Begin Trading\
\
Collect official documents (‚ÄúCR‚Äù)\
Register for VAT if required (threshold: annual turnover BHD 37,500+)\
Set up accounting/bookkeeping (service options here)\
\
Detailed Cost Considerations\
\
Government fees (basic CR): BHD 100‚Äì250 first year, BHD 80‚Äì200 renewal\
Office lease: BHD 2,500‚Äì14,000/year (Seef/Bahrain Bay best Causeway access)\
PRO/legal/translation: BHD 300‚Äì1,000 one-off\
Bank deposit: Usually BHD 100‚Äì1,000 (depends on account type)\
Optional support services: See Keylink‚Äôs detailed cost guide\
\
\
Budget-saving tip: Bundle PRO services (document pickup, MOICT liaison, LMRA processing) with a reputable agency. Keylink and Tamkeen-certified consultancies give you all-in support, avoiding hidden re-filing charges.\
\
Navigating Regulatory Compliance for Saudi-Bahrain Trade\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation in corporate environment.*\
Latest 2025 regulatory update (MOICT Circular 02/05/2025):\
All new WLLs engaged in cross-border trade must submit quarterly digital trade reports. Implementation began 1 June 2025.\
\
Practical implication: Companies trading with Saudi partners via the Causeway must have real-time accounting, or risk BHD 250‚Äì500 fines.\
\
Personal aside: When this rolled out, I had to retrain my team on bilingual digital invoicing‚Äîusing Keylink‚Äôs cloud accounting support (see options here). Saving grace: Their staff explained the new reporting rules in Arabic and English, letting us meet the deadline.\
Avoiding Pitfalls: Cultural, Procedural, and Practical Insider Tips\
\
Majlis-style meetings: Always accept the offer of coffee and dates; relationships come first, paperwork later.\
Ramadan business hours: Start early‚Äîgovernment offices close by 2pm sharp.\
Document handling: Never staple key documents together; use clips, as Bahraini government offices will not accept stapled paperwork (learned this the hard way at Sijilat HQ in Bahrain Bay).\
Networking: The Tamkeen building hosts weekly free business networking‚Äînew deals are often agreed informally here.\
\
\
Common mistake: Rushing the process during Eid or public holidays‚Äîboth Saudi and Bahrain offices may be closed simultaneously even if one country is technically open.\
\
Comparing Gulf Practices: Bahrain vs. UAE and Saudi\
\
UAE: More expensive, slower for cross-border Saudi trade, and now has 9% corporate tax.\
Saudi Arabia: Direct setup possible, but much stricter Saudization quotas, high minimum capital, and complex sponsorship rules.\
Bahrain: Lower costs, easier KSA access, English-first documents accepted.\
\
Free Zones, Sponsorship, and 100% Foreign Ownership\
\
100% foreign ownership in most sectors (full list here)\
Free zone companies can re-export to Saudi via Causeway with 0% duty (more details)\
Local sponsorship only required for a few regulated sectors (guide here)\
\
Definitive opinion: Unless your activity is on the restricted list, always go for full foreign ownership. This makes banking, profit repatriation, and long-term exit planning dramatically simpler.\
Trusted Support: Professional Help for Company Setup\
\
Alt text: Professional business support and consultation in Bahrain office.*\
My strongest recommendation? Use a bilingual, Bahrain-based firm with proven experience (Keylink offers English, Arabic, Hindi support). They know which Sijilat counter staff work fastest, which PROs can pull strings for urgent approvals, and how to adapt document packs for Saudi compliance too.\
Brief Tangent: Why Bahrain‚Äôs Startups in Food Tech and Logistics Love the Causeway\
Out-of-the-blue, you might wonder what food delivery startups and cross-border logistics firms have in common in Bahrain. Both depend on super-fast supply chains‚Äîand both have played a major role in Bahrain‚Äôs 2024‚Äì2025 business boom. The King Fahd Causeway has let Bahraini agri-tech and F&B SMEs serve Riyadh and Dammam in hours. This agility isn‚Äôt possible from the UAE or Kuwait. That‚Äôs why the most buzzed-about pitch nights at Bahrain Bay‚Äôs EDB events often include new logistics and food delivery platforms aiming to win Saudi clients.\
Practical FAQ on Bahrain Company Formation and the Causeway\
\
Q1. How long does it take to set up a Bahrain company for Causeway trading?\
With all documents in order and a good PRO, WLL formation can take as little as 5‚Äì8 working days. Allow more for regulated activities. See Bahrain company formation process for a step-by-step breakdown.\
\
Q2. What‚Äôs the best Bahrain office location for Saudi-facing companies?\
Seef District and Bahrain Bay have the fastest Causeway access, ample parking, and proximity to banks and ministries. Avoid central Manama during rush hour!\
\
Q3. Can I register 100% foreign-owned? Are there restrictions?\
Yes, for almost all trading, consulting, and services activities. Some sectors (like media or defense) require local sponsorship‚Äîsee full list here.\
\
Q4. What are the total ongoing costs?\
Government fees, office space, bank charges, and accounting. Budget around BHD 3,000‚Äì6,000/year for a basic setup. For details, see full cost guide.\
\
Q5. Do I need to register in Saudi to serve Saudi clients?\
For most B2B activities, no. The Causeway allows you to base your team in Bahrain and serve Saudi clients without local KSA setup‚Äîunless you want a physical presence inside KSA or need to participate in major tenders requiring local registration. For ongoing compliance, keep perfect records, and use professional accounting help (details here).\
\
For further updates, check the latest Bahrain government regulations, recent Gulf News reports, and regional economic analysis from Reuters and Forbes Business.\
Key takeaway:\
If you want the best blend of international efficiency, low cost, and direct access to Saudi and wider GCC, Bahrain‚Äîconnected by the King Fahd Causeway‚Äîremains the smart choice for ambitious companies in 2025.\

I (about 25M) am in a somewhat odd situation. I rent in a large apartment complex with lots of units. The property management has an office that‚Äôs staffed 1‚Äì2 times a week (one male employee and a nice female employee in her mid-20s).

I‚Äôve noticed several times that the woman from management turns her head to look at me. If I have an issue to discuss with management, she always tries to join the conversation‚ÄîI can definitely tell she wants to be noticed by me.

Recently there was a moment when she was there alone, so I went over and asked if she‚Äôd like to grab a coffee. Her answer was: ‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶ maybe when you move out, but with tenants it‚Äôs difficult.‚Äù

I naturally figured that was a rejection. But since then, she grins at me every time she sees me‚Äîand for quite a while.

However, when I talk to her, she can‚Äôt look me in the eyes and basically ducks away‚Äîe.g., back into the office. As if she‚Äôs super nervous or even panicking‚Ä¶
A friend of hers‚Äîwho lives here‚Äîhas also been grinning at me since then. So I don‚Äôt think I was too pushy or anything like that.

What does this mean? And what‚Äôs the best way to approach it? Unfortunately I rarely see her alone‚Äîmaybe once every 2‚Äì3 weeks. I only have her work cell number and email, and I‚Äôd rather not contact her through those. I can‚Äôt find her on social media.

I speak now as a man who is defined by clarity. If I had been asked- referencing my definition- a few years ago, I would have hesitated, pondered, perhaps even zoned out in the ether of existentialism; eventually I would reply: Making my son happy.

If you asked me- once more referencing my definition- a few months ago; the words would practically fly from my lips like an uncaged crow: Survival.¬†

My son was killed by a drunk driver who- by taking my son- took a word from my vocabulary and mutilated it; violated it. Loved. I had to say I loved my son. I couldn‚Äôt wake up and look him in the blue marble eyes and smile and say: I love you. That word was taken from me by the last person I‚Äôd expect.¬†

His mother didn‚Äôt bother showing up to the funeral: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to see my son like that, fucker!‚Äù translation: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any clothes not stained with cum or soaked in crack smoke, fucker!‚Äù And other than me and my father-in-law, the pews were empty.

‚ÄúThank you for coming, Immanuel.‚Äù His hand was as soft as sandpaper but gentle.

‚ÄúOf course, Kiddo. This isn‚Äôt something you face alone‚Ä¶ Sasha not comin‚Äô?‚Äù His eyes kept mine open, kept them alert. I shook my head and he nodded his. It felt like his hand was glued to my back, keeping a constant, pleasant pressure on my shoulder. The service was short and despite paying for the lecture, I only had one person to eulogize to.¬†

‚ÄúHe never got to meet you. I‚Äôm sorry about that. Just everything with Sasha‚Ä¶ I was so bitter. And I didn‚Äôt even know you existed till you just kinda‚Ä¶ appeared while she was first showing‚Ä¶ signs.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to apologize. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôll never meet him. I‚Äôll end up in the same garden he is. So will you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm gonna be okay‚Ä¶ I just need some time.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell once you‚Äôre ready‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll call you.‚Äù I raised an eyebrow for a frame, but smiled crudely and nodded. I Ubered home- I suppose the driver was typically chatty, but picking up a tear stained man from a funeral house was a hint enough- and tipped the fella 15 bucks for the quality AC.

8 glasses of cinnamon pain killer were enough to get the tears to stop. As I went for a 9th, the first knock came.¬†*Tap Tap Tap‚Ä¶ Tap Tap Tap‚Ä¶ Tap Tap Tap.*¬†Through the peep hole I saw a lean white man with slick salt and pepper comb-over. He wore a black suit and tie. I opened the door, expecting a mormon and noticed he now wore glasses too. They were thin and circular. I must have missed them in my hasty once-over of him. I thought he looked better with them anyway so I didn‚Äôt pay it much mind. ‚ÄúY‚Äì Yes?‚Äù

‚ÄúHey neighbor! I just moved in down the way, but the movers won‚Äôt have my stuff there till tomorrow. Could I borrow some lunch meat or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶‚Äù It was a weird question, but houses aren‚Äôt cheap, especially not in my area, so who am I to deny a man tight on cash. ‚ÄúSure-‚Äù

‚ÄúYou look lost.‚Äù I was stunned for a moment. ‚ÄúDid you just move here too?‚Äù Relief escaped my lungs. My drunken gait was indifferent from a man lost in a new, too-big house.¬†

‚ÄúNo no‚Ä¶ just a little‚Ä¶ Little too many stiff ones.‚Äù I faked a chuckle and his chuckle followed, even faker than mine. It was oddly reassuring. He faked his laugh to make me feel better about faking mine. I smiled for the second time that day. ‚ÄúDo you wanna come in, get some coffee?‚Äù

He took two steps back and looked up at the sky with a sarcastic examination. ‚ÄúMy dad always told me to play things safe, but where is the harm in living a little dangerously?‚Äù Now I actually chuckled and swung the door wide.

‚ÄúCoffee at 6, you must be a Knievel.‚Äù He walked inside

‚ÄúOne, actually, but I prefer Lou.‚Äù And stayed for about 3 hours, sharing stories about his time serving as a missionary and pastor.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a while, but Egypt was an oven! You simply cannot escape the heat.

‚ÄúOf course. And thank¬†*you,*¬†I needed the laughter.‚Äù

‚ÄúI always provide.‚Äù He bowed slightly and I chuffed. ‚ÄúYou mind if I come around again, see how much more I can steal from ya?‚Äù he giggled and I wheezed.

‚ÄúCome and take what you want anytime, friend.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell I like your doors, so I‚Äôll start there.‚Äù And once more I wheezed in a caffeinated-drunken gigglefit. He stuffed down his laughter and extended his hand for a shake. My hand rose, but was snatched back as my phone rang loudly.¬†

‚ÄúShoot‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúNo worries, get your call, bud. I‚Äôll see ya later!‚Äù

I grit my teeth, embarrassed but nodded and waved, before shutting the door and rushing to my phone. ‚ÄúImmanuel?‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, Kiddo. I just wanted to check in on you.‚Äù The velvet gravel voice of Immanuel bucked in my ears and in my motion my stomach twisted to a knot. It felt years had passed since I thought of him- of anything other than booze, coffee, and conversation.

‚ÄúI- I‚Äôm‚Ä¶‚Äù The world came back to me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶ better. As¬†*better*¬†as I can be.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood good. I was wondering, and you can say no, if you‚Äôd want to come to church with me Sunday?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI- Uh‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs where I belong. I don‚Äôt- I‚Äôm not-‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not asking you to. And, trust me when I say, you don‚Äôt need to. But it‚Äôll help.‚Äù

I chewed on my cheek. ‚ÄúAlright. Where is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about that part, I‚Äôll pick you up at 5:30am. Deal?‚Äù

‚ÄúDeal.‚Äù

The next day, around 3pm, Lou:¬†*Tap Tap Tap,*¬†then cracked open my door and peered in. I craned my neck, cheeks slightly tear stained as I gripped a photo of my son in a Thomas the Tank engine costume me and him had DIY‚Äôd for Halloween.

‚ÄúHey, Bud‚Ä¶ Bad time?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo no no‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ thinkin‚Äô.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat an atrocious sin, oh how hell will punish you.‚Äù He cracked a meek smile.¬†

A humming chuckle rose in my throat but died there as well. He walked in, the suit was a dark shade of red today, nigh-black, and sat next to me on the couch after shutting the door softly. ‚ÄúYour kid?‚Äù

‚ÄúMhm. Elie. He‚Äôs 3 here and I swear he‚Äôs the cutest kid ever born.‚Äù My stomach dropped and fiery guilt swelled but swiftly died.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd be hard pressed to disagree.‚Äù

‚ÄúI uh, would work for days every October to help him choose what costume he wanted, Then we‚Äôd go get the materials and spend a week pouring our hearts into it- till it was perfect. Then he‚Äôd go out, and get maybe‚Ä¶ 3 pounds candy. Guess how long that bucket would last?‚Äù

‚Äú2 days.‚Äù

‚ÄúN‚Äì Yeah! Without fail! 2 days it‚Äôd empty and he‚Äôd say the same thing: ‚ÄòNever again dad, never again.‚Äô I did everything to make him the happiest he could be. Make him know he was loved.‚Äù Gently, so gently I had at first thought the picture floated from my hands, Lou took the picture and stared at it with a distant glimmer in his eye.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in a better place now.‚Äù

Tears flowed again. ‚ÄúI hope so‚Ä¶ If I had it my way, he‚Äôd be in his room right now, building some skyscraper with his magnet tiles. But, maybe he is. Just not here.‚Äù A rock grew in my throat and an opaque haze blurred my vision. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for‚Ä¶ all this- can I get you coffee or a sandwich or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo no‚Ä¶ I just wanted to swing by and say hi, I gotta unpack and‚Äôll be at it all day.‚Äù

‚ÄúI could help ya if you need?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I got a legion on payroll. After they get done doing all the grunt work, I‚Äôm gonna put on some blues and decorate till I‚Äôve got no wall space left.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow far down the way are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know the fork in the road, about a mile or two‚Ä¶‚Äù He conjured a mental map, ‚ÄúThat way.‚Äù He gestured west. ‚ÄúThe yellow one.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ The manor house?! Wow‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre¬†*rich*¬†rich.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYeah, she‚Äôs a nice place, no damned AC, but I‚Äôve been through worse than heat.‚Äù He tapped the picture with his index finger then opened, and swiftly closed his mouth.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh nothing‚Ä¶ I was just gonna ask‚Ä¶ ask if I can keep this?‚Äù He looked queasily at me, embarrassed.

My lip pulled back behind my teeth, then relaxed. ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ I got plenty.‚Äù¬†

He brightened. ‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù He stood up and set his hand on my shoulder. ‚ÄúYou were a good dad.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank y-‚Äù I barely remained intact. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù And he left.

I went to bed that night with an alarm set for 4:00 so I could wake up, adjust, shower, dress, and get coffee made by 5:15 all to be ready by 5:30 for Immanuel. REM came quicker than usual and similarly, left quicker than typical.¬†

2:52am, the clock on my nightstand blared in red dashes. I sat up- floaty headed- and lurched towards the door out of my bedroom; sluggishly traveled down the hall, shambled down the stairs, and peeped through the peep hole. Lou stood facing away from the door in a maroon suit. I swung it open and was met with his smile, he had been facing the door; hadn‚Äôt he.

‚ÄúLou?‚Äù I grunted.

‚ÄúMoses! I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre up. May I come in?‚Äù

I hesitated, confused. ‚ÄúYe- yeah, of course.‚Äù As he entered, I spotted that he held the picture of Elie in his hand.¬†

‚ÄúI need to talk to you, my friend. Sit.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù I said, more awake now.

‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm about to say‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs gonna sound weird.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

He rolled his tongue along his lips.‚ÄùYou‚Äôre son. How did he die?‚Äù

‚ÄúWha-‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did he die?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask me tha-‚Äù

‚ÄúMoses.‚Äù His face lost all luster and kindness.

‚ÄúWhen the car‚Ä¶ spun out: the back passenger seat slammed in a pole and‚Ä¶ he was‚Äì Why are you asking me this!?‚Äù

Lou answered swiftly. ‚ÄúWho was the drunk driver that day?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ please no.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù

I began to weep. ‚ÄúMe‚Ä¶ I had gotten‚Ä¶ and I thought I could manage‚Ä¶ but the rain‚Ä¶ I lost control.‚Äù Lou dove to my feet, his hands cupping my face and directing my eyes towards his.

‚ÄúShush, shush‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs okay. Look at me. I know the pain you feel. All too well. And- and‚Ä¶ can help you. I can bring him back.‚Äù

‚ÄúWh-‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve done it before, brought people back from the other side. Myself a time. You can see Elie again. Have Elie again. all yours, like before.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow‚Äì No, no! It‚Äôs not right.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs perfectly right, because it‚Äôs what you want. Here.‚Äù His index finger tapped my heart. ‚ÄúI know, because I know it all.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou just have to ask.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs it?‚Äù Lou nodded. My lips trembled and my body quaked. ‚ÄúCan you bring my son back?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù His hand rose, and so did mine. It glided forward then recoiled as my phone rang up the stairs. I turned to face Lou and he shrugged. ‚ÄúNow or never.‚Äù Without a thought, my hand swam forward, and shook his. ‚ÄúCongrats my friend. All things are how they should be.‚Äù My racing heart eased its pace and we both smiled. ‚ÄúBetter go get that call.‚Äù He chuffed.

I dashed up the stairs, all hope and joy and passion reignited. Love came back to vocabulary. I raised the phone to my ear. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I chirped.

‚ÄúWhy did you shake his hand?‚Äù Immanuel sobbed.

‚ÄúWhat? Immanuel- what‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù

‚ÄúI told you we‚Äôd see him in the garden someday. Did you want it that bad? Was it worth your soul?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou could have saved yourself‚Ä¶ I made you to be wise‚Ä¶ how could you think so little?‚Äù And the call ended.

‚ÄúMoses‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs back.‚Äù He shouted.¬†*Lou*¬†shouted. Lou One. Low One. I dashed downstairs, tripping halfway down and riding my spine to the ground. I scrambled up and panned my gaze to Lou. Elie stood beside him, eyes wet with tears. ‚ÄúSay: Hi, Elie.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù I wailed, cascading to my knees.

‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶‚Äù I fell to my side and wept against the planks. ‚ÄúGet up Moses. You don‚Äôt have much time.‚Äù I clambered to my knees and crawled into the living room.

‚ÄúElie.‚Äù I sniffled.

‚ÄúDad?‚Äù Elie murmured. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶‚Äù I broke down again.¬†

‚ÄúMoses‚Ä¶ Look at me.‚Äù He knelt to my side and pulled me to my knees. ‚ÄúYou have 10 minutes. Heaven will only let him be out here for 10. Short. Minutes. Mo. You already paid, no point in crying. Spend this well okay?‚Äù His voice was new. It was slicker and polished. It was soft. It was kind. He removed his pocket square and cleaned off my face of the water works.¬†

I shuddered toward Elie who smiled now that my complexion was less glum. ‚ÄúHow are you, Buckshot?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood, Dad! I've been at this pretty garden with Immanuel. There are all these fruits that I didn‚Äôt even know existed!‚Äù His smile was as bright as the day I lost him. His voice as innocent and curious as everyday he‚Äôd woken up.¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs amazing‚Ä¶‚Äù We talked for what felt like an eternity with an end. Each minute felt like some grand and critical part of the world was falling away, but also: that it was used to its fullest before its loss. He told me of relatives he met and friends he had made. He spoke of the food and the music. The wings in the sky.¬†

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait for you to see it, Dad.‚Äù Some part of me knew, but a glance to Lou confirmed it.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be a while before I do‚Ä¶ But, I‚Äôm sure the wait will be worth it.‚Äù I held my son as the last lie I‚Äôd ever tell him fell away from my mouth. His warmth grew then dulled. Lou walked to my side, Elie‚Äôs soft skin becoming gritty as whatever he was made of turned to dust on the furniture.

It broke back out, tears cleaning and dragging away spots of the dust. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Mo. I really am.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a fucking liar.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe worst part is: I can‚Äôt be‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not allowed to not do‚Ä¶ this to people. Most of the time, I enjoy it. I get to look evil souls in the face as they come to understand. But, cases like these‚Ä¶ I wish I didn‚Äôt have to.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúI wish you could know.‚Äù His cheeks became wet. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, I was begging you‚Äôd say no‚Ä¶ Goodbye, Mo. I‚Äôm moving today.‚Äù And he left.¬†

Clarity fills me now. Of definitions I‚Äôve given myself, this one is- unironically- the clearest. I have been given a profound understanding of how many things are watching everything you do. How many things cheer and jeer. How little they lie. That‚Äôs the part that still hurts. More than any other.¬†

Demons lie, and they fail because of it. But, the Devil will give you nothing but the truth, and that's why he will always get you. They call him the king of lies, but not once, not with me or any other human past, present, or future; has he ever lied.¬†

He smiles, dresses well. Smells of honey and speaks so compassionately. He‚Äôs gentle and kind- so, so, so kind. His face is never the same, but it‚Äôs always only his. He will look like you least expect, but most enjoy. He will ask for little things, and soon he‚Äôll ask for everything; and you‚Äôll give it to him.¬†

You only have one hope. If you hear a knock (3 taps, 3 times) on your door and¬† the man on the other side of the door is dressed in a deep red suit that could almost be mistaken as black, don't answer. Just pray and unlock the door. Because if he is at yours, you deserve whatever is coming.",1,1756241848.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

This is an introduction to a longer piece I am writing. I would love your feedback for it :) 

Thank you,

Somewhere North

Jack Harris slid out a chewed up toothpick from between his rough gums and began scraping away the dirt from underneath his fingernails. Done scraping, he held the toothpick about an inch from his good eye and smiled. Happy with his work, he rolled the black end of the toothpick between his index finger and thumb, and wiped the stain on his trouser leg. He pushed the toothpick back between his gums, rocked back in his chair, and propped his feet on the shop counter. Jack interlocked his fingers and rested them on his soft, round belly. He was at peace.

	After a while of doing nothing, Jack stretched his arms towards the grey ceiling tiles and inhaled the stale air of the petrol station through his nose. He reached his left arm around the top of his head, feeling his thinning, oily hair under the back of his elbow. Then, he hooked his fingers underneath his jawbone and cracked his neck into place. In the pit of his bad eye, Jack scratched away the tired orange grit that had formed, pushing his thin cheekbones towards his temples as he did.

‚ÄúTime for a smoke,‚Äù he said, reaching between his legs, fishing out a yellow plastic packet of tobacco. He knew he wasn‚Äôt supposed to smoke inside the petrol station - the boss had told him twice before. But he didn‚Äôt care what the boss had to say. He pinched the packet between his fingers and thumbs, then snapped open the plastic thread that held it together. Next, he pushed his rough tanned hand into the warm mound of tobacco and felt around for the buried rolling paper and filter tips. After retrieving the papers and filters, he shaped an empty canoe for the tobacco, and sprinkled in a coarse pinch of straggly brown addiction. After discarding the toothpick with his free hand, Jack rolled his thin bottom lip under his top teeth and squeezed in his cheeks to wet his tongue. He pinched the filter tip carefully and brought the cigarette to his mouth, licking along the paper with his grey tongue, sealing it like a tight envelope. 
With the cigarette perfectly balanced between his lips, Jack reached into his trouser pocket and brought out a cheap, translucent green lighter along with a ball of lint. Flicking the flint wheel was almost as satisfying as the act of smoking itself. But only almost, for Jack loved the silent rush of pleasure that expanded in his lungs and crept through his red-skinned nostrils. He took a large drag of the cigarette, watching it glow with his good eye before removing it with his middle and index fingers. His right arm dropped gently to his side, the cigarette swinging in his hand like a lazy bell.

‚ÄúBetter pass me that newspaper,‚Äù Jack mumbled, lifting his right arm and pressing the cigarette back into his lips. He leaned forward and fingered the corner of the newspaper along the shop counter towards himself, the chair squeaking as he did. He smiled at his quiet success, gripping the newspaper‚Äôs delicate edges between his hands as he leaned back into the chair. ‚ÄúShit,‚Äù he said, jolting as a thumb of ash fell from his cigarette onto the wrinkled pages, flecks of ash rolling down its inner spine. He picked up the newspaper and shook the ash onto his lap. ‚ÄúNow then,‚Äù he said, settling comfortably in his chair and shifting his feet on the counter, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs see what she‚Äôs got for us t‚Äôday‚Äù.

	Jack held up the newspaper and spread its wings. He inspected the ads section closely. Used cars, used golf clubs, used drum kits, and used prams. Jack sighed through his teeth, shaking his head at the price of a used diesel car, a little more ash falling from his cigarette as he did. He coughed and turned the page. ‚ÄúMust be somet‚Äô worth buyin‚Äô‚Äù he said to himself. More ash from the cigarette floated onto his lap as he continued to shake his head. He turned the page again, but it was no good. He or the newspaper simply could not come up with an agreement on the appropriate pricing of things. ‚ÄúFailed me today, Sarah‚Äù he muttered, turning to the deaths section. ‚ÄúGo on then, love. Let's ave a laugh,‚Äù. He made sure to pay close attention to each and every name. There‚Äôs something therapeutic when it comes to the deaths section, Jack‚Äôs subconscious murmured. After reading closely for a while, he looked up from the newspaper and out through the smeared petrol station window. For a moment, he looked solemn as he gazed at the yellow sun. For a moment, he looked deep in thought. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll ave to try ‚Äòarder next week if you want t‚Äô see me in ere‚Äù he laughed to himself, mocking He who saved the Israelites from the Egyptians.

	The filter of the cigarette tip had turned into a dark orange. Jack pulled it from his lips and flicked it toward the sand bin behind the shop counter. He missed, but didn‚Äôt care. Cleaner‚Äôll get that, he thought. The cigarette butt lay lifeless next to its fallen comrades ‚Äì some of them orange, some of them brown, some of them with their heads squashed down flat. Jack set down the newspaper on his lap and began to roll another. As he did, he felt the rumble of a passing truck glide past the petrol station. ‚ÄúTrucks on a Sunday‚Äù he mumbled, realising he had been using his bad eye to fill the paper bullet, and in the process, had spilled some tobacco onto the newspaper‚Äôs front cover. 

	When he finished licking the cigarette paper‚Äôs edge, he held it in his lips and dropped the newspaper to the grey tiled floor. Better grab a coffee, he thought, and pushed his hands into the arms of the chair because his right leg had gone static and he knew getting up would take some effort. After his leg went from static to full definition, he swung the chair around and placed his hands on his knees. Standing, he let out a habitual sigh ‚Äì the same sigh older people let out when he was young ‚Äì and straightened up. Jack leaned over the counter and took a handful of change from the pay-it-forward tin. Then, he hobbled to the coffee machine on the other side of the counter and loaded it with second-hand coins. The machine buzzed and whirred, spluttered and steamed, and finally spat out an Americano. ‚ÄúThanks, folks‚Äù Jack grinned, tilting the cardboard coffee cup to the pay-it-forward tin, knowing in his brain that he deserved the spare change more than anyone. Knowing in his heart that He who saved the Israelites was probably glaring at him through the clouds. Proudly smiling at the coffee cup, he brought it to his lips and took a sip, staining his grey tongue brown.
 Leaning on an empty shelf, Jack looked across at the upright, hollow fridges along the far side of the petrol station. They used to be full, but the boss stopped refilling them to cut down costs. Once they held sandwiches, drinks, ready meals, eggs, butter, and milk. But the boss didn‚Äôt see much point anymore. He rested his hand on the empty metal shelf where crisps and chocolate bars used to shine, and looked out of the front door. Only money‚Äôs in petrol and diesel‚Äù the boss had said. Only money‚Äôs in your pocket, Jack thought. 

An hour later, Jack was back in his chair, flicking through magazines and listening to an FM radio he‚Äôd hidden under the counter, ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt have a radio because I aren‚Äôt paying for the licence‚Äù the boss had told him ‚Äì three times. His good eye was busy focusing on a story about a woman whose cat had been kidnapped. His bad eye, mute, couldn‚Äôt get its words out and tell Jack that someone had pulled into the petrol station forecourt. You better tell him to put that cigarette out, else he‚Äôll get in trouble, said the bad eye to the good eye ‚Äì but the good eye was too busy to listen to its backward brother. 

Jack was singing along ‚Äì loudly, as he always did ‚Äì to Needles and Pins by The Searchers when the buzzer signalled that pump number three was trying to be used. ‚ÄúShit, shit!‚Äù Jack exclaimed, throwing another fallen comrade to the sand bin and wafting his arms around in the air to dispel the smell. ‚ÄúShit!‚Äù He grabbed a can of air freshener from the shelf and locked his finger on the trigger as he hit the button to activate pump number three. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need any air freshener; the cleaner brings her own‚Äù the boss had said three times this month. Not now! Jack thought.

1n0xm03,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1n0xm03/gingerbread/,Gingerbread,"Marques Reineer was the apotheosis of neat. His quiffed brown hair stood in regimented lines formed from his fine-tooth comb. Had a single pomade slicked follicle broken from formation it would be forced back into position with a swift pass of the ebony comb he carried in his pocket from the moment he dressed till he undressed- although he was prone to keeping it under his pillow or even coddling it while sleeping- 55 minutes before he planned to shower, 75 minutes before he planned to lay down, and 80 minutes before he planned to sleep. However, if this hair dared to break formation more than once: Marques would gently take hold of it, wrap it around his index finger, and pluck it from his scalp. 

His face was a placid lake of which an onlooker could project any emotion they pleased on to it. His teeth were ivory white with the pink gums around them receding from his obsessive over-brushing. His clothes were all tailored to sit on his body with zealous flattery to his machined figure. His pale skin- a suit in and of itself- formed delicately over a toned swimmers-lean body. He wore suits or wore nothing. No inbetween. Every suit was paired with a firmly Balthus knotted tie and one of his 5 identical pairs of brown polished dress shoes. He wore duller tones- any color with a hue even mildly bright was only ever to be worn by children or those afflicted with mental incompetence- for formality and taste‚Äôs sake. 

Outside: Marques was simply a kindly, overly-neat, gentleman with many friends in quite high places. Inside: Marques was a panther, his slitted eyes like microscopes; taking in the world atom by atom. He played any role he needed to to get what he wanted and all he wanted was power.

His journey to conquest began small. As a youth going through private schooling he associated himself with the children of some of the rich and famous in Great Britain. He made the laugh harder than any other, played into and fed their more insidious desires, and gave them connections to other children of esteem. He had girlfriends (until they were no longer necessary) and boyfriends (until they were no longer necessary), but it was never for love. Not on his end at least. Every hand he held, lips he kissed, genitals he massaged were simply moves along a game of chess.

By 17- a trail of broken hearts and dead stray dogs behind him- he was taken in by a family friend after his mother and father were found dead; a metal rod having been shoved through their eye sockets, lobotomizing them. The rod- a steel chop stick Marques used for meals that contains food smaller than a pound coin- was packed with the rest of Marques life and moved into the Buntinger Family Mansion.

Marques held two secrets from the world: 1. He found men more tantalizing than women despite his open homophobia. 2. He was planning a string of murders and manipulations ever-so perfect that by the end the age of 30 he would be Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the 10 lives he took would be filed cold and forgotten.

***

‚ÄúPriscilla?‚Äù Marques queried as he cracked the door to his home. He had invited the young Priscilla- wife to James Vettly- over for dinner and sex. 

‚ÄúYes it‚Äôs me, Marques.‚Äù She chirped, already stirring even before the door was open. Her orange hair was tucked up into a red apple cap. She was wrapped in an oversized brown coat that ventured just above her knees; under it was her thinnest blouse and a non-existent bra on top, a pleated skirt below. Her regular identifiable designer heels were traded for heavy raised-heel black boots. Her face- to Marques- was soft and trusting, but contained horrible insecurities. Marques had correctly presumed she had made attempts on her life as a younger girl and was no better now. She hated herself and the only person in her life who made her feel any different was Marques.

‚ÄúCome on in, Doll.‚Äù She giggled and stepped inside the warmth of the quaint house. The smell of garlic and tomato accompanied by basil filled the home. 

Marques- who genuinely did love cooking- had prepared an elegant meaty pasta dinner, freshly baked bread, and uncorked a vintage 1965 Malbec just for her. Of course more than just the meal had been prepared: The bedroom was lit by 50 or so candles and smelled of soft peppermint. Beside the bed was a prophylactic and lubricant, both would go unused but provided the proper image for her to believe this would be like any other night spent with him.

They ate the meal, Priscilla teasing and coaxing Marques all the while. He made the correct expression, bending his face in the right ways to make the girl confident she was turning him on. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm stuffed.‚Äù She chuckled and bit her lip.

‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù He responded, causing her lips to pull up into a goofy smile and her eyebrows to fly up in glee. He stood and walked to her side of the table, placing his hand under her chin and guiding her from her chair to the bedroom. He undressed her, and she undressed him. As she went to her knees he took a breath of relief as he dropped the visage of attraction. The slut was- by his standards- hideous. He loathed every advance she made and had to stifle vomiting every time she touched him. He retreated from her to her chagrin and laid her onto her back on the floor, spreading her legs. ‚ÄúClose your eyes baby.‚Äù She obeyed, blinding herself.

From beneath the bed Marques retrieved two instruments. ‚ÄúBite down.‚Äù He lulled as he gagged her with a soft rag. She obeyed. ‚ÄúBreath nice and deep.‚Äù and for the final time, she obeyed. As air filled her lungs she felt the tip of something metallic-cold touch the corner of her eye. She opened them puzzled just in time to see the mallet drive the rod down through her eye socket into her brain. Her teeth groaned as she bit down in agony, tears and blood mixing in her eye. She went to scream but the rod sunk further and tapped the backside of her skull. She wasn‚Äôt dead yet, but she wished she had been. 

Her intact eye watched as Marques stood up, pulling the rod from her eye. Watched as he covered the bleeding eye with a rag which soaked up what little blood was coming out. Watched as he rushed to the bathroom and heard him hastily shower himself off. The next sight of him she got he had redressed himself. His gloved hands picked her up, carried her through the house to the garage, and rested her in a tarp lined cooler. Her head bounced, her body flopped limply as the car drove the 20 minute drive to 34th Wenscreek street. The car came to a stop and the cooler was pulled from the back of the car. It was dragged along the empty- cameraless- back street from delivery trucks to a dimly lit alleyway. She was pulled out and laid the tarp. She watched through tears as Marques flipped her over onto her back and dully felt a mallet strike the back of her head once, and died before she could feel the second.
 
He picked her up, holding her by the armpits then pushed her over lightly. He watched blankly as she flopped to the ground. He grabbed her shoulder, leaned her up against the tarp covered cooler, stepped 5 feet away, took aim, and fired a bullet through her eye. Blood and bits painted the alley wall. Finally, he pushed her into the trash spilt onto the alley. 

When the forensic examiners arrived they would surely make the following assumption: Priscilla had been hit in the back of the head then driven here to be disposed of. Only she wasn‚Äôt dead like her killer presumed. She woke up and tried to run, but was shot in the face, falling to the trash caked ground dead. The bruises from Marques dropping her would prove she was standing when shot, and the whiplash would be intact as he had propped her up, leaving room for her head to whip back once shot. In short, the perfect crime. The only evidence left behind, would be the bullet casing, belonging to the gun Marques had used to shoot her, the gun belonging to her husband.

After setting fire to the car, he walked the route he had planned a week prior; devoid of cameras and people, the walk was delightful. 

In the coming days he would support the grieving James Vettly, picking up the pieces of the crumbling man. 5 days after Priscilla‚Äôs murder, James would jump- be pushed- off the ledge of his penthouse and the cops would find a suicide not written in a perfect copy of his script, detailing how he had discovered Priscilla was having an affair and killed her. However, the grief over-took him and he couldn‚Äôt live with what he had done.

The person named in the letter as Priscilla‚Äôs lover was the current prime minister of the united kingdom Desmond Betler. He would be found dead 2 month later, killed by his wife- Marques- in a rage after a woman had been found murdered, dismembered, and raped; Desmond‚Äôs semen inside her. The truth of the matter, the woman- a prostitute- had been murdered and chopped up by Marques. He had used a turkey baster to damage her and inject Desmond‚Äôs sperm. The sperm- 2 weeks old- had been collected by Marques directly. As planned, the closeted homosexual Desmond Betler had come to Marques for support as his wife pushed him away from an affair he promised he never had. Marques seduced the weeping man by reminding him of adventures he and Marques had gone on in Year 13. Of course, Desmond‚Äôs wife wouldn‚Äôt ever dream of killing her husband, but as far as the police would know she had slit his throat, then opened up her own.

Then came the waiting. Marques waited patiently for the next prime minister to come into power, before messaging him. ‚ÄúAdrian! Long time no see old friend. I just heard the news, so happy to see all your hard work has paid off.‚Äù 

Within 3 months Adrian and Marques‚Äô relationship had rekindled and Marques was given a platform to build his rapport with the Commonwealth as a charming and intelligent gentleman. His victory was assured by the time election season came along and he did so in a landslide.

6 months later tragedy struck the world. Adrian‚Äôs beloved wife murdered their 3 children with a meat tenderizer. They say from the time she wakes up to the time the asylum drug her into sleep, she screams and raves of her innocence. ‚ÄúA man in a red suit and mask killed my children! He killed them! He killed them in front of me and put the hammer in my hand! He did! He did! HE!‚Äù 

He served the next year as the lead voice in parliament, hundreds of articles were written in praise of the inhumanly charismatic MP. Then with 3 months remaining in Marques‚Äô 2 year plan, Prime Minister Adrian Urius was found with his head blown off his shoulders. Scrawled in Adrian's blood next to the corpse was a short rhyme: ‚ÄúRun, run, run, as fast as you can. You can‚Äôt catch me, I‚Äôm the Gingerbread man.‚Äù

When it came time to choose who should be the next Prime Minister, the answer was certain to the public. For a month the Queen was silent. This silence ate at Marques. He knew his victory was assured but the silence- the wait- boiled his blood. 

On the 23rd of May an event was held in honour of Adrian Urius and of the guest speaker, Marques was 3rd in line to speak. He sat at the rear of the stage as Adrain‚Äôs brother gave his speech, examining the crowd. His face was posing a grim smile of remembrance for his late friend as his eyes drifted from person to person.

‚ÄúSir.‚Äù The young manservant, his brow slick with the anxious sweat of an inexperienced worker who has been scolded repeatedly that day, gently tapped Marques‚Äô shoulder. The boy, barely 19, was quite attractive and Marques- correctly- assumed that if chosen to be Prime Minister he could easily get this boy, whether he was gay or not, to service him without a second thought after some teaching. Power would allow such things. Power would finally complete his life. 

‚ÄúYes, boy?‚Äù He passed the boy a flirt look.

‚ÄúSomeone has sent a note for you.‚Äù

This knocked him out of his lust. ‚ÄúIs now really the best time?‚Äù He asked, annoyed and confused.

‚ÄúHe insisted, Sir.‚Äù The boy had a queer, nervous look in his eye as he held out the tiny folded piece of paper.

Marques rolled his eyes, took the paper, and shooed the boy away. Marques fiddled with the note, debating if he should open it now, then unfolded it. 

At first, the three small words hadn‚Äôt even registered. Instead, Marques had to stifle mad laughter as he saw the horrific chicken scratch handwriting. The words were not just regular child-borne incompetence chicken scratch, no this was confidently terrible adult chicken scratch. Before he could indulge in the mangled characters any more, the words finally sunk deep. ‚ÄúI already did.‚Äù aside the words a single smooth line and 5 dots formed a toonish gingerbread man with a bite taken out of it. 

For the first time, other than his times with partners, his heart began to race. A pebble developed into a stone in his throat. His eyes flickered up to the audience, his ears refusing to absorb sound, scanning; running over every face. Running, running, running- back up. Of thousands of eyes, only one pair was settled on him.

A short man, his curly hair tossed around in wild spurts that was intentionally ‚ÄúMessy.‚Äù Marques shivered as he thought of the word. Messy. But that isn‚Äôt where it ended. The white dress shirt he wore- ‚ÄúWithout any over coat or even a jacket for fucks sake.‚Äù- was wrinkled. This nearly killed Marques. ‚ÄúIron your fucking shirt! If your gonna catch me, you best have the decency to iron your fucking shirt- oh‚Ä¶ oh god no, his shoes!‚Äù This man, presumably the detective who had caught him, wore the worst thing Marques could possibly fathom. Sneakers. Bright. Red. Sneakers! And if that wasn‚Äôt enough friends and neighbors: His shoes, atrocious as they already were, were untied. 

The man, the detective, simply sat. His hands interlocked and his chin rested atop. His eyes were missile-locked onto Marques. Examining the man he had proved was an emotionless serial killer.

A thought- a chilling thought spat out from the unexplainable aether known as intuition- came to Marques: ‚ÄúIf this is the effort he put into his clothes‚Ä¶ oh god. How easy was this for him?‚Äù

As nature would have such a thing like a perfect murder is impossible. Of whatever reason, there is always at least one mistake. Whether it be big or atomic, at least one mistake is always made. As perfect a killer Marques was, he had made thousands of these atomic errors. A quantum microcosm of flaws that all branched off one large, fundamental error: An error in odds. An error in the odds that after around a year and a half of Britain‚Äôs greatest detectives being utterly stumped by every death, they would call in some help. Not another detective renowned as the best in his or her country, but the world's finest detective. A man so good- who, had Marques known existed, he would have to admit this man was his only superior- that he had solved every facet of this in a month.

Charlie Gnosis was a Welsh-born detective. His existence was little more than imaginary to anyone other than his coworkers. What he was, precisely, is beyond even the limits of my knowledge, but whatever organization he calls home is of the same station and reverence as the queen‚Äôs guard. He had been brought on to the case via his own request, seeing it as just another string of ‚Äúperfect murders‚Äù. Each morning, he woke up without an alarm, brewed a pot of store brand coffee, dressed in whatever was clean, slid on his red sneakers, and drove to work. He would arrive sometime between 9:30 and 11, eat a brick-hard donut, then move to his office for the day. In 7 days Gnosis had Marques‚Äô names written down in that horrid chicken scratch under the title: Prime suspect. By the time he got the call Adrain Urius had been killed, he knew for immutable fact that Marques was the oh-so-genius killer. Arriving to read the poem ‚Äúthe Gingerbread man.‚Äù had left for them, he chuckled, and utter the same 3 words he‚Äôd later write on the note Marques would receive. Had Marques known any of this his soul would surely leave his body and take its seat in the waiting room in hell.

The Gingerbread man held Charlie‚Äôs gaze for the entire ceremony, never leaving even as he gave his short speech. He walked from the podium and found himself in handcuffs once backstage. 

As rumor has it, on the walk to be put into an interrogation room with Charlie Gnosis, Marques pulled the gun off an officer‚Äôs hip and blew his brains out. The truth is, he did that before he even got to the back seat.

1n0xlyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayTechTried/comments/1n0xlyv/explore_if_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Explore if the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker from CHULUX Delivers,"Compact, efficient, and seemingly designed to complement my fast-paced mornings, the CHULUX CL-CM24002 single-serve coffee maker has become an unexpected companion in my daily routine. At first glance, this little powerhouse intrigued me with its sleek, black exterior and slim profile, making it stand out amidst the clutter of larger appliances in my kitchen. Eager to see how it performed, I decided to give it a whirl, and after a few weeks of testing, it‚Äôs safe to say this coffee machine has something unique to offer.

**Design and Space Efficiency**

The design was the first thing that instantly caught my attention. With a width of just 4 inches, the CHULUX CL-CM24002 is compact enough to fit in even the tightest spaces. In my kitchen, which has limited counter space, this was a game changer. I was able to squeeze it in without rearranging half my appliances‚Äîsomething I can‚Äôt say for the bulkier machines I‚Äôve used before. Its portability and lightweight 2.6-pound build also made it super convenient to carry around. Taking it with me on a weekend trip to a cozy cabin proved to be a breeze.

[Check CHULUX CL-CM24002 price on Amazon.](https://triopd.com/p/b0cvxq9bck/)

**Performance and Brewing Options**

What impressed me most during my testing was how quickly this machine brewed a cup of coffee. In about two minutes, it reached an ideal temperature of 190¬∞F, delivering fresh coffee faster than I could scroll through my morning emails. The CHULUX CL-CM24002 accommodates both K-cup 1.0 and 2.0 pods, giving me the flexibility to experiment with flavors and brands. Adjusting the output size between 6 and 12 ounces was easy through manual water input, allowing me to tailor my cup based on how much coffee I needed. On days when all I needed was a small caffeine boost, the 6-ounce option was perfect; for those bleak Monday mornings, the full 12-ounce brew kept me going.

**Pros**

- Its compact design fits easily in tight spaces, making it perfect for apartment kitchens, dorm rooms, or RVs.
- The rapid two-minute brew time was surprisingly efficient for my busy mornings.  
- Flexible brewing sizes (6 to 12 ounces) allowed me to choose exactly how much coffee I wanted.
- Compatible with most K-cups, offering plenty of flavor and brand options.

**Critiques**

- The water filling area is a bit narrow; occasionally, I had to be extra careful not to spill water while pouring into the reservoir.
- It‚Äôs designed for use at altitudes below 4,000 feet, which might limit its application for mountain dwellers.
- Like most single-serve coffee makers, descaling and regular cleaning every 1-2 months are needed to prevent clogging issues.

**Customer Experience and Ease of Use**

My mom, who isn‚Äôt the most tech-savvy, decided to try it while visiting, and even she found it intuitive to use. Its one-touch brewing system made things remarkably simple‚Äîjust press a button, and hot coffee is ready in no time. Cleaning was straightforward too, thanks to its removable drip tray and stainless-steel cover that collected any excess coffee. Funny enough, the first time I used the auto shut-off feature, I didn‚Äôt realize it was built in. I thought I‚Äôd forgotten to turn the machine off, only to discover this energy-saving feature had my back. 

**Product Competitors**

When compared to similar single-serve machines like the Keurig Mini, the CHULUX CL-CM24002 certainly holds its own. While Keurig is known for its brand recognition and extensive pod compatibility, the CHULUX coffee maker often comes in at a more affordable price point, which is a significant win for budget-conscious shoppers. On the flip side, Keurig might edge this model out in terms of water capacity, as it typically offers a larger reservoir, meaning fewer refills. Still, for anyone prioritizing space efficiency and portability, the CHULUX can be a better pick, particularly for travel or small living spaces.

**Quality for Price**

For its features and versatility, the pricing feels fair. Though it lacks a larger water tank and might not compete with high-end coffee machines, the value it offers for casual coffee drinkers is impressive. In my experience, the rich aroma and consistent flavor in each brew proved its worth. While Keurig models might appeal more to heavy users, this machine truly shines for individuals or couples who prefer single cups, freshly brewed each time.

Though my body perished beneath the weight of betrayal, my spirit lingers where honor is brewed. The Samurai Caf√© is one such refuge, where warriors of discipline share silence, laughter, and bitter cups.

When steam rises from the cup, I see the mists of Kurikara Pass. When bitterness clings to the tongue, I taste the lessons of loyalty lost. Coffee, like the blade, is not to be taken lightly.

Remember this:

	‚Ä¢	Drink strong, for strength becomes your ally.

	‚Ä¢	Drink with patience, for haste poisons judgment.

	‚Ä¢	Share your cup, for oaths are bound not by ink, but by fellowship.


I leave these words so you may sit where I cannot, and sip where I am but spirit. Carry your Caf√© within as I once carried my sword, steady, unwavering, undefeated.

1n0xkdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/newcoffeetrackersite/comments/1n0xkdu/welcome_and_intro/,Welcome and intro,"Hello Fellow Coffee Folk,

My name is Karl and I have been looking to do something for the wonderful online coffee community for some time, but I don't consider myself anywhere near expert enough to contribute in the traditional sense.  After years of dreaming about doing something online I have decided to start building a coffee tracking platform which is community focussed. No idea where this will end up but I just want to get started, and having a helpful community motivating me and contributing will be invaluable.

Many of the apps and journals out there are solo endeavours, but there is much to be learned from the collective.  My vision is for people to learn from eachother, not from AI, but perhaps with the help of AI, and be able to adjust their brews to according to their own tastes, identify beans and roasters that they like or not like, gain real data on performance of different equipment for specific brew types, etc...  My vision is for this to be as simple, or feature rich and complex, as any coffee loving human would dream.  Use it daily or use it weekly or monthly, but simply find it useful. 

  
I‚Äôm still very early in the process of building my MVP and really don‚Äôt want to build this in isolation. So I‚Äôd love to hear from you:

* What general features would make a brew tracker genuinely useful to you?
* What would drive you to use the brew tracker on a regular basis?
* Is it more for dialling in and then keeping a record for the next batch?
* Would you prefer it as a web app you can pull up anywhere, or a mobile app?
* Do you like the idea of sharing your brews with others, or would you rather keep them private?
* Would some simple form analytics be useful?
* Anything else!

I'm very much hoping to start building the community for this platform starting right here in this subreddit.  I'm very aware that there are other options out there but I want to build something for the people with the opinions if the people very much factored in right from the beginning.  

I will be building this in my spare time with help from some AI coding tools, I'm very new to all of this, but hope to be able to build and iterate quickly.  

  
I'm also brand new to Reddit, so if there is anything I should be doing differently here please shout.

Many thanks and happy brewing! :)

1n0xg0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1n0xg0a/what_is_an_adequate_amount_of_sex_per_month_to/,What is an adequate amount of sex per month to keep you at least somewhat satisfied?,"I (45M) and wife (40f) have been married 15 years, together almost 19, with 3 kids. She works part time (2-3 days per week) and I work full time. We are both good looking and in decent shape people.

We had some downs early this year due to me losing my company and her being understandably stressed by the political environment and family issues. We have worked through virtually all of it and are probably connecting better emotionally than we have in years. Me not running a company left me emotionally messed up but has since allowed us to reconnect since I‚Äôm not working 75 hours a week now.

Whenever I‚Äôm not at work, I‚Äôll handle the kids activities 75% of the time. This entire year I have cooked more often than her. I probably tidy up the house a little more often than she does (although when she cleans the house, she cleans very thoroughly - much more than I) and I handle the kids laundry more often than her. I also get the kids off to school 75% of the time without any assistance. We both hit up grocery stores fairly evenly, although she does the larger shopping lists more often. You get the drift.

I often get her coffee at SBX or make a cup for her at home. I give her foot massages 1-2x per week (her favorite thing). We shower together 1-2x per week (which leads to sexual activity ~30-50% of the time).

We‚Äôve gone on more dates this year than probably the last 3-4 years combined. I feel like we are engaging socially and emotionally with each other as well as we ever have.

We have had some of the best sex in our relationship this year, too. It‚Äôs just not that frequent. Hell, just last week we had AMAZING sex that she completely initiated. She handcuffed and blindfolded me and she had a massive orgasm! So I know the fun is still in there. And I *always* make sure she orgasms whenever it isn‚Äôt her only taking care is me (which happens occasionally).

But here is the issue. We have sex maybe on average 3 times per month (although this month has been unusually good with 6 times so far). I could easily triple that without batting an eye. I masterbate probably 2x as often as we have sex. I‚Äôve told her several times in the past year I would really like to be intimate more often and she says she hears me but nothing has changed all that much and I‚Äôve since grown overly sensitive to subtle or outright rejection to the point where I feel like an awkward ass hat to even try to initiate. I now have virtually zero self confidence when it comes to initiating. And I‚Äôve shared this with her. Even recently I told her I feel like I have zero confidence and that her body language often indicates ‚Äúno thanks‚Äù when I‚Äôm passively probing interest.

Take for instance last night, we took a shower together. I brought the vibrator to the shelf outside the shower ‚Äújust in case.‚Äù We talked and kissed and it was nice. We even did a fun online quiz. I embraced her and gave her a bigger kiss hoping she would reciprocate but she didn‚Äôt. I tried to make it obvious without trying.

When we got out of the shower about 10 minutes later she saw the vibrator and said ‚Äúoh I didn‚Äôt know you wanted to do that. I would have been down‚Äù although she should know I always want to ‚Äúdo that‚Äù and also I was pressing my body up against her noticeably and giving longish kisses.

We get the kids to bed pretty much immediately right after that short post-shower convo. It took a few minute for our youngest to fall asleep but after we were finally alone she was awake for maybe another half hour scrolling/listening to TikTok. Nothing happened. And I just laid there frustrated with my mind racing. 

It‚Äôs just disappointing. During one of our conversations over sex, I said sooner than later I‚Äôm going to be getting to that age where I won‚Äôt or can‚Äôt have sex that often and I‚Äôd really like to rekindle our passion. She never disagrees and I can tell it even hurts her to know I don‚Äôt feel satisfied sometimes. But ultimately the routine never changes.

I hate thinking that our relationship has to be somewhat transactional for me to get laid, but if I clean her car, do her favors, cook dinner, get the kids to bed, etc. I hope the effort I am putting in and the time it frees up for her can lead to more sex. I hope that doesn‚Äôt come off as entitlement or chauvinistic.

So what‚Äôs the magic number on average? And people in my shoes (or ladies who have been in my wife‚Äôs position), have you done anything to improve your frequency with your spouse?

We were together almost one year - and in line with so many other avoidant breakup posts I've read, things started off passionate, loving, and fast. I genuinely believed I had found the person of my dreams. 

We both (I thought)  felt similarly and hindsight looking back, what I thought was us falling in love fast and hard was really just a never ending string of red flags. 

Within one week of meeting on an app: He initiated the exclusivity conversation and we both deleted our apps; he took me on a weekend cabin trip with coworkers; asked me to be his girlfriend. 

Within one month: He said I love you; involved me in some pretty major decision making for the future of his career; asked me to meet his family the following month when they came to visit for a family vacation; had me fly out to meet him on a work trip in Oceania. Headed home from that trip, he asked if I would want to move in with him when his lease was up in about five months - I said yes. 

The intensity kept increasing for the entirety of our relationship. But please keep in mind, in the moment it all made sense. He really did treat me well, I believe I was genuinely in love, and all of these crazy things just made sense because I felt he truly was my person. 

He took me to look at engagement rings twice. Actively and excitedly spoke about the timeline. We had plans for me to move across the country with him for his job in mid 2026. He had full integrated me into his family and friend groups, and I did the same with him. 

He had to go away for two months of job training and I flew out nearly ever weekend to see him. Due to the timing, I ended up having to go apartment hunting on my own. I quickly found the perfect place - it checked every box of ours, was under budget, and it was just perfect for ""our first home"".

He came back from training, and the next weekend we moved. Almost overnight, there was a palpable shift in his behavior and attitude. Nothing overt and it wasn't easy to give examples or put into words - so of course it was easy for him to deny everything. I know I lean anxious sometimes (although for most of this relationship I had actually been quite secure) so I ignored my internal alarms and figured it was just the anxious part of me coming to the surface. 

Ultimately, we started arguing more due to his lack of communication and because he seemed to want me to be able to read his mind. He avoided conversations that needed to be had until the last possible second, and then an argument stemmed from that. Regardless of these cracks that started appearing, I figured it was just a combination of growing pains stemming from learning how to live together and communication issues that I believed were ultimately easily fixed. 

He let me believe we were repairing and moving forward after each argument we had...until everything came to a head after just three months of living together. Despite the picture I'm paining here - we overall were both very happy (I thought). We had still been intimate often, still actively were planning and talking about our big move next year and getting engaged, went on frequent dates, outings with friends, and family events, traveled multiple times, and just overall had way more good days than bad. 

The day of the breakup started of normal, nice, even. We woke up and made breakfast together, kissed and said.I love you. The usual. We drove an hour away from home on his motorcycle, stopped to get coffee, were laughing and talking, went to shop for overpriced nice soap for our apartment. An hour later, we were finishing up a nice lunch when he started a conversation that started kind of going in circles. It went on for HOURS in the middle of the restaurant we were at. 

I finally asked something like ""so what, do you not want to be in the relationship??"" and he paused for a moment and simply, unemotionally said ""no. I don't want to be in the relationship"". 

Instant crying on my end, naturally. I begged him to have a conversation or to wait a few days and take some space before making any kind of decision. He refused to even talk to me about it, really and that was that. One hour we were happy as could be, the next he was coldly just done. It was like a switch flipped. 

I've had some toxic breakups, but this is next level. I'm so confused, sad, angry, and hurt. I feel stupid for not seeing the red flags. I'm mad that I didn't ask more questions when he told me, at almost 30 years old, he's ended almost every relationship he's been in and none have lasted longer than a year. 

You know what he told me at the end that sticks out so sharply? ""I know it's probably not much consolation, but I stuck around and tried to make it work with you way longer than I ever would have with anybody else"". Gee, thanks. I wish you hadn't.

In general, I love hiking and spending time outdoors, walking around cities/towns, visiting coffee shops, etc.

Day 1: arrive in Dublin and do all of the typical touristy things (temple bar, trinity, etc). I have read a lot about staying in South Dublin but is Jacobs Inn okay? 

Day 2: travel to Galway. Spend the day exploring the city

Day 3: take the bus to Cliffs of Moher and explore solo

Day 4: travel to Killarney. Spend the day walking around/exploring as this is a longer travel day.

Day 5: ring of Kerry bus tour

Day 6: this is where I need the most help I was initially planning on traveling to Cork and exploring and then doing Blarney on day 7. Not sure if it‚Äôs worth going to Cork as the Airbnbs are pricey and the hostels don‚Äôt seem to be the best. Is it more worthwhile to spend 3 nights in both Galway/Killarney or is there another town that would be better perhaps on the way to Killarney from Galway?

Day 7: as above

Day 8: travel back to Dublin for flight in the early evening

# Blurb/Synopsis

Captain Henry Donnager expected a quiet career babysitting a dusty relic in Area 51. But when a test unlocks a portal to a world of knights and magic, he's thrust into command of Alpha Team, an elite unit tasked with exploring this new realm.

They join the local Adventurers Guild, seeking to unravel the secrets of this fantastical realm and the ancient gateway's creators. As their quests reveal the potent forces of magic, they inadvertently entangle in the volatile politics between local rivalling factions.

With American technology and ancient secrets in the balance, Henry's team navigates alliances and hostilities, enlisting local legends and air support in their quest. In a land where dragons loom, they discover that modern warfare's might‚ÄîHellfire missiles included‚Äîholds its own brand of magic.

**Chapter 56: Reputation**

\-- --

Henry‚Äôs brain flickered online in the gray half-light sneaking past the curtains, that pre-dawn mountain glow just enough to outline the room's edges without fully committing. The bed hit first ‚Äì thick blankets wrapped tight like a high-end burrito, dwarven engineering keeping the warmth sealed in despite the frost crusting the window outside. Even in this weather, there were no drafts, no chilling bite; whatever mana or steam setup they had humming through the walls made the place feel like a climate-controlled bubble, cozy enough to tempt staying horizontal.



Technically, it was the perfect setup ‚Äì engineered warmth without flaw, the kind of comfort that deployments rarely delivered unless Big Brother had secured a nice hotel for them. But true coziness demanded more: that missing upgrade of shared heat seeping across from the other side, the subtle mattress dip from another body turning solo space into something synced. Just one night, and it was like his routines had already hardcoded ‚Äòpaired config‚Äô as default.



There it was again, the longing from last night, just bleeding over into today. Yeah, he had to chill out with that. He shelved the thought and snagged his phone from the nightstand. The screen glowed a confirmation ‚Äì 0645, spot on. That wired-in timer preempted the alarm again, saving him from the cold wakeup of his ringtone.



Henry‚Äôs bathroom run was routine, all except for the eager grin that plastered his reflection. He was really looking forward to the date, wasn‚Äôt he?



Returning to the room, he came face-to-face with a new problem. What was he gonna wear? He hadn‚Äôt given it much thought ‚Äì not in the night prior, and certainly not in the night when they first packed for this trip. He had a couple formal getups in case he had to do anything diplomatic, but his civilian closet looked pretty empty. He had three solid fits, partly thanks to the joint input of Isaac and Ryan, but they were all he had.



He opted for the selection that Ryan had said would look good for Sera: thick jeans for the weather, a thermal undershirt, a cream turtleneck, and a black overcoat. It was a bit Hallmark-y, like he was about to go get a coffee in a romance movie set in New York, but he wasn‚Äôt gonna argue with the expertise of their resident ladies‚Äô man.



He scooped the currency pouch, portioned a few hundred bucks‚Äô worth of grenno for pocket change ‚Äì including money for a potential date ‚Äì and holstered his sidearm under his coat.



He stepped outside, the dining hall scent wafting over. He couldn‚Äôt name the dishes for shit, but he recognized them ‚Äì leftover bake with its flaky butter notes, some sort of griffin roast, and a hint of tea. It wasn‚Äôt french toast and bacon, but it was good enough.



A handful of the local staff had just finished tidying the tables when he got there, offering curt nods. Sera had claimed a spot by the window, probably angling herself in the sunlight on purpose.



‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù Henry said, dropping into the opposite chair. He snatched a pastry that flaked apart in the way all pastries ideally should ‚Äì softly and smoothly.



Sera looked up, mouth quirking in a half-smile. ‚ÄúGood morrow.‚Äù Her eyes tracked over him briefly. ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôve a mind for fashion. And here I thought the uniform had long since beaten the notion of color from you.‚Äù



The assessment hit closer than she probably realized. His fashion sense extended about as far as ‚Äòdoes it fit?‚Äô and ‚Äòis it clean?‚Äô This whole outfit was Ryan's doing, down to the color coordination. But admitting that would just prove her point about the uniform thing.



‚ÄúMilitary dulls a lot of things.‚Äù He took another bite of pastry, deflecting. ‚ÄúAnyway, you‚Äôre up pretty early for someone with a nine o‚Äôclock appointment.‚Äù



‚ÄúStrange beds do unsettle me.‚Äù She took a sip, eyes on his. It was a poorly disguised lie, given how well she‚Äôd slept back at that trading outpost. She paused, then added, ‚ÄúThough it may be I simply wished the morning here a touch sooner.‚Äù



Great minds thought alike, apparently. ‚ÄúRight, speaking of which,‚Äù Henry glanced toward the window, where morning light had started glinting off the mountain peaks. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got like two hours until then. Think we‚Äôll have time to roam around before the appointment?‚Äù



‚ÄúHmm, perhaps. Though in truth‚Ä¶‚Äù She set the cup down with a small clink. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd sooner see the dull business done at once. Uncle Caelus will doubtless wish to inquire after my so-called ‚Äòirregular arrangements‚Äô ‚Äì his phrasing, naturally ‚Äì and I‚Äôd much prefer to be done with it ‚ÄòASAP,‚Äô as you might say.‚Äù



‚ÄúUncle Caelus, huh?‚Äù Henry didn‚Äôt realize Sera had extended family, but then again, he had never really asked. ‚ÄúWait, you‚Äôre saying he‚Äôll be ready this early?‚Äù



‚ÄúThe Sonaran embassy sees little stir of a morning ‚Äì but Caelus is no great respecter of leisure. He‚Äôll be at his desk, I‚Äôve no doubt, likely halfway through a missive none will read. That said, family privilege should grant us access regardless.‚Äù



‚ÄúWell, you know what they say: never let an opportunity pass you by.‚Äù Henry shoveled a last bite of pastry and chased it with a cup of tea. ‚ÄúI bet Owens is gonna have something *real* creative to say about our early departure, but whatever. You ready?‚Äù



At Sera‚Äôs nod, they collected coats and headed out. The morning cold hit like a bitch slap ‚Äì not quite Alaskan deployment levels, but close enough to make his face tighten. Minus ten, maybe fifteen? He‚Äôd dealt with worse during Arctic training, humping gear through white-out conditions, but that didn‚Äôt make standing still in it any more pleasant.



Sera pressed closer, her hand finding his arm. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre grimacing.‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine ‚Äì‚Äù



A subtle warmth spread from where she held him, like stepping back through their makeshift hotel. The worst of the wind just‚Ä¶ stopped, deflected by something he couldn‚Äôt see but definitely felt. Her barrier magic, probably. The same trick that kept new adventurers safe from goblin arrows now served as a personal windbreak.



‚ÄúBetter?‚Äù She kept walking, as if creating a mobile climate bubble was totally normal.



‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù No point pretending otherwise. The Embassy Quarter suddenly looked a lot more manageable when he wasn‚Äôt fighting hypothermia.



With this sort of weather, the Embassy Quarter at 0715 was naturally dead as hell. Maybe a guard here and there trudging through shift change, but otherwise the whole place had that government building vibe where even the stones seemed to work banker‚Äôs hours.



The Sonaran Embassy stood out like a Venetian palace, doing its best to pretend it wasn‚Äôt in the mountains. While almost everything else here stuck to the dwarven right angles and chiseled stone, the Sonarans had shipped in their entire architectural identity ‚Äì from the decorative columns to the curves of elegant elven spires. The whole facade had that honey-colored stone they must‚Äôve hauled from home at absurd cost.



‚ÄúNostalgic, I take it?‚Äù Henry asked as they approached.



‚ÄúScarcely. Honestly, it stings my soul a little, beholding this gilded excess. How much does it cost? It is a thought I dare not entertain.‚Äù



The guard at the entrance went from slouching to parade rest in about half a second the moment he laid eyes on Sera. ‚ÄúLady Seraphine. His Excellency is at your disposal, my lady. You are expected within.‚Äù



‚ÄúOf course he expects me,‚Äù Sera muttered, then louder: ‚ÄúMy thanks.‚Äù



Inside was basically a marble warehouse dressed up with gold trim ‚Äì tapestries on the walls doing that noble history thing, fancy furniture arranged like it was posing for a catalog. It was the standard embassy power flex to remind visitors who‚Äôs footing the bill.



Staff were already locked in at their posts despite the early hour, rocking that wired alertness of folks who‚Äôd been mainlining coffee since oh-dark-thirty.



‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt be overlong,‚Äù Sera said. But her wavering tone wasn‚Äôt on the same page. Henry knew exactly what that meant ‚Äì this was gonna drag forever.



‚ÄúTake your time. I‚Äôll just‚Ä¶ admire the scenery, I guess. Make sure all that money wasn‚Äôt spent in vain,‚Äù Henry chuckled, gesturing at the fancy-ass sofas. ‚ÄúIf it really comes down to it I could always go annoy the clerk.‚Äù He nodded toward an old woman whose perma-glare didn‚Äôt really invite conversation.



She squeezed his hand once, then headed up a staircase that curved way more than structurally necessary.



Henry watched her disappear before picking a sofa and collapsing onto it. He checked his phone ‚Äì no signal as expected this far away from home ‚Äì then defaulted to staring at the ceiling like every waiting room ever. Some kind of painting rested up there, angels or whatever the Sonaran equivalent of divine bureaucracy looked like, probably meant to inspire patience but mostly just reminding him of bad hotel art.



The minutes stretched by with nothing to do. Fifteen minutes in, and he was already contemplating the life choices that led him here.



His phone had exactly zero entertainment options ‚Äì no internet meant no bases to raid on Clash of Clans to fritter away the wait, no Reels to doomscroll through. The only thing that could be *remotely* considered entertainment would be the shit he‚Äôd downloaded, which was all work stuff. Paging through Dr. Perdue‚Äôs theories on mana crystallization or guild org charts was technically an option to pass time, but that was more like assigned reading, not diversion.



Fuck. He should‚Äôve cached some offline games. Bloons would‚Äôve been a solid pick. Alas, hindsight was 20/20, but boredom was immediate.



The windows, at least, offered a lifeline: a wide view of Enstadt dropping away in tiers, steam curling from the lower workshops like factory exhaust on a cold day, the river far below snaking through like a power cable in a circuit board. Better than ceiling art. He stood, stretched the kinks from the sofa trap, and headed outside. The cold smacked him like a freezer blast, breath fogging instantly, fingers already tingling through his gloves. It was ball-shrinking territory, undeniably, but it beat lobby limbo.



Reminded him of that study where guys preferred shocking themselves over sitting alone with their thoughts ‚Äì boredom‚Äôs a real motivator, apparently.



But here, he had the privilege of a trade-off; the view made it worth the hypothermia risk. From up here, he could see how Enstadt stacked itself up the mountain ‚Äì each terrace catching different light, shadows carving valleys between buildings. The peaks behind everything did that snow-in-sunlight thing that probably had a fancy name.



Henry pulled out his phone and started grabbing shots. First, the Masonry Domain‚Äôs tower as it jutted up like architectural overcompensation. Then, the Commerce District as it showed early signs of life, steam from the cranes drifting across rooftops. He even managed some decent shots of the Embassy Quarter ‚Äì a handful of the buildings trying to out-fancy the others with their imported architecture.



And of course, he couldn‚Äôt forget the pi√®ce de r√©sistance: the full panoramic drop of Enstadt itself. He lined up the frame, thumb hovering. Mountain terraces stepped down like geological stadium seating, each level carved with enough precision to rival those rigidly square zoning grids from back home.¬†



Click. Click. Click.¬†



He lowered the phone, glancing at the shots. Not bad. Not magazine-worthy, but good enough to slap on a wall or post on Instagram.¬†



Not that anyone would believe it even if he *could* send the pictures home. The whole thing looked like AI-generated fantasy wallpaper. He smirked and tried to line up another shot.



His fingers were just about to go numb when the door opened behind him.



‚ÄúMy sincerest apologies,‚Äù Sera said ‚Äì and for once, it damn near sounded genuine. ‚ÄúI had hoped it would be but a brief audience, but Uncle proved rather more inclined to speak than I‚Äôd foreseen.‚Äù



Henry pocketed his phone, hands grateful for the reprieve. He hid the pain. ‚ÄúNo big deal. Got some good shots of the city.‚Äù



‚ÄúBold of you, loitering in this frost.‚Äù She stepped closer, activating her environmental bubble. ‚ÄúYou at least might have waited indoors. I‚Äôd rather not find you half-frozen.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat sofa had it out for my spine.‚Äù He nodded toward the street. ‚ÄúSo anyway, what‚Äôd Uncle want?‚Äù



Sera‚Äôs face did that thing where she couldn‚Äôt decide between annoyed and amused. ‚ÄúNaught but the usual trifles ‚Äì my safety, health, chastity, reputation, and continued existence.‚Äù



She waved a hand, half exasperated. ‚ÄúTwo guards, a liaison, and ‚Äì lest he be accused of indifference ‚Äì a brooch that might signal should I faint or fall ill. One wonders if he‚Äôd hoped it might shriek should I entertain poor company.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat, he wanted to put a tracker on you?‚Äù



‚Äú‚ÄòFor your safety, dear niece.‚Äô‚Äù Her impression of Caelus was spot-on pompous. ‚Äú‚ÄòOne mustn‚Äôt presume safety where foreign interests are concerned.‚Äô As though I‚Äôd not weathered a great many quests alone.‚Äù



They started walking, putting distance between them and the embassy. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm guessing you shut all that down?‚Äù Henry looked behind them. ‚ÄúNobody like‚Ä¶ following us, right?‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôd hope not. I dismissed any notion of that with but a mention of my Tier; Uncle dared not tread on disrespect and thus withdrew his proposals. This, however,‚Äù she said, drawing a silver pin from her coat, ‚ÄúI accepted with all due grace. Then I dispelled the tracking ward in the washroom.‚Äù



Henry raised an eyebrow. Sera would fit right in some Hollywood spy blockbuster. ‚ÄúStill works as jewelry?‚Äù



‚ÄúOh, quite. Lovely piece, actually. A pity about the enchantment.‚Äù She pocketed it with a grin. ‚ÄúI do wonder, though ‚Äì was that Father‚Äôs doing, or Uncle Caelus‚Äô idea? Father can be rather‚Ä¶ *doting*, after all.‚Äù



Yeah, that didn‚Äôt sound comforting ‚Äì not even in the slightest. Henry was gonna have to meet this man ‚Äì this *legend*, no doubt ‚Äì who probably kept a sword sharp for precisely this sort of occasion.¬†



‚ÄúRight. Well, I suppose it‚Äôs a good thing we haven‚Äôt met yet,‚Äù Henry chuckled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll probably have better chances with an Elemental Dragon under my belt.‚Äù



‚ÄúMm. A feat of that order might just suffice to earn his notice. Approval, however ‚Äì ah, I do not know.‚Äù Sera must‚Äôve caught some change in Henry‚Äôs expression. She added, ‚ÄúFret not. I shall lend my name where I may!‚Äù



‚ÄúHow generous.‚Äù



They reached the commerce district, following the main road until they spotted a group of adventurers clanking past in mismatched gear: one dwarf with a massive hammer, an elven archer, a dude in a full suit of armor, and a lanky guy with a wooden staff and flowing blue robes.



Perfect. Henry didn‚Äôt want to admit he was on the verge of getting lost, so he decided to tail the pros.



The group led them through a shortcut alley that opened onto a bustling square much like the one that surrounded the statue of Sola back in Eldralore. And there it was ‚Äì the Adventurer‚Äôs Guild. Unlike the one in Eldralore, though, this one was probably five times the size, complete with grandeur to match: huge banners flapping with crossed swords and shit.



Time to get an update on the Campaign.

Increasingly over time, Charles struggles with rage. Since his mom died in 2020, he‚Äôs been in ‚Äúreset mode.‚Äù He burnt through his inheritance, a house sale, and a lottery win. He won‚Äôt even toast a bagel or make a cup of coffee, high-end everything. 

He burns bridges. He cohabited a house when the co-owner abandoned it, got a restraining order, and a legal remedy to divest from it.

He is living off credit cards. Last year, a friend gave him a job. He clashed with everyone, complained to his boss friend about everything, and from what he says, the ending was reality housewives TV worthy. 

In 2021, a mutual friend offered me a job. Charles was incensed that she hadn‚Äôt offered him a job; then he looked up the job salary and told me I was entitled. He blocked her. When they were visiting our hometown holidays, he caused a public scene when she asked why he had blocked her. 

I‚Äôve always tried to be supportive without being judgmental. Our conversations have gotten difficult. If I ask how his new profession is going, he snaps that not everyone gets offered a free job. If I share something I‚Äôm doing in retirement, the response is, ‚ÄúMust be nice. I can‚Äôt afford that. You live in a different reality.‚Äù It‚Äôs become harder to discuss anything without him becoming resentful.

He is now a TikToker; it‚Äôs all political Angertainment about the right.

I‚Äôve had some serious health issues the last five years (2 cancers, heart, liver, pancreas problems, UC). My prescriptions are $60k/yr before insurance. So when my COBRA ended and I had to switch to ACA, my premiums doubled. We were talking about Social Security when I told Charles that my entire check basically goes toward health insurance, I‚Äôm looking forward to Medicare.

He said, ‚ÄúWell, I guess you just won‚Äôt be Mr. Globe Trotter anymore. You‚Äôll have to sit at home and live off scraps and Netflix like us peasants.‚Äù

I said, ‚ÄúYeah, guess I‚Äôll just have to give up my shopping and Amazon addiction and no Starbucks.‚Äù

He said I was an A-hole for talking about having to pay for insurance when he doesn‚Äôt have the money to pay for insurance. I was entitled, compared me to people he hates, said I don‚Äôt know what the real world is like, and told me to go F myself. He even threw in a homophobic slur and accused me of secretly being a Republican, to which I know I threw gas on and said maybe I am. He hung up, blocked me everywhere, and that was that.

I‚Äôm not surprised based on history. I know he struggles, and I understand it must be hard to hear about someone else‚Äôs retirement when he feels left behind. But I was just being honest about my own fears, not bragging, not rubbing it in. We‚Äôve been friends for 45 years, and I thought I could talk openly about my health and money worries.

So‚Ä¶ AITA for sharing my retirement and health concerns with a friend who is in a worse financial spot?

I recently got the Casabrews Ultra and have been trying to dial in a good double shot of espresso. But for some reason, I keep on getting way too much espresso compared to the ratio I'm trying to achieve (1:2, which I believe this subreddit has advised for beginners). My most recent espresso shot pulled about 75 grams in 26 seconds from 18 grams of beans, which is obviously way off. 

At first I thought it had something to do with the machine's default programming for its double cup button, which is what I've been using for my double shots, as well as the single-walled, double shot basket. But I don't think I'm using the wrong button. 

I also used dark roast beans, so the ratio should be a lot more equal than what it is now. I'm starting to think I'm using my Kingrinder K2 wrong, but I'm not sure since the resulting ground coffee looks fine to me. 

I know this is a bit vague, and forgive me for my lack of knowledge, but can anyone advise me on what I might be doing wrong to be getting so much espresso in less than 30 seconds with just 18 grams of beans? Thank you!",0,1756240477.0,espresso,19,0.17,False

1n0x2m0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1n0x2m0/the_creepiest_night_in_my_life_in_detroit/,The creepiest night in my life in Detroit,"Hey, I decided to post my new story here before posting on my YouTube channel.

I never thought I‚Äôd be the kind of man who aims his rifle scope at another living person.  
But boredom has a way of twisting your routines into something you‚Äôd rather not admit out loud.

I‚Äôd rented this apartment in Detroit, East Side. Cheap place, temporary deal‚Äîthree months tops, just to be close to a contracting job. It was one of those tall, worn-down complexes: brown brick, peeling paint, neighbors arguing in the hallways. The rent was low because the landlord knew no one sane wanted to stay here longer than necessary. And me? I didn‚Äôt care. I wasn‚Äôt planning on putting down roots.

Evenings were the problem. Work was boring, sure, but at least it kept my hands busy. Back home, I had nothing. No cable‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt about to waste money on that. Mobile data was enough, and signing a long-term internet contract didn‚Äôt make sense when I knew I‚Äôd be gone before the ink dried. I had a couple books, but I burned through those in the first week. That left me with long nights, a thin mattress, and silence thick enough to choke on.

So I turned to the only hobby I‚Äôd brought with me: my Remington 700. Bought it second-hand at a gun show a few years back. Cleaned it up myself, fitted it with a decent scope. Nothing fancy, just a reliable bolt-action rifle. I‚Äôd never fired it at anything living, and I didn‚Äôt plan to. But I liked the weight of it, the precision. Looking through the glass made me feel steady, like the world narrowed into a clean circle where everything was sharp and in focus.

At first, it was innocent. I‚Äôd set it on the table by the window, draw the curtains just enough to leave a slit, and line up the scope with rooftops and street signs. Ranging distances, testing how steady my hand was after coffee, after a long day, after two beers. Just practice.

Then, one night, I slid the crosshairs across the building opposite mine. Another twelve-story complex, maybe two hundred yards away. A whole wall of glowing rectangles, each window a little TV screen playing a different channel. And once I started, I couldn‚Äôt stop.

The first night hooked me right away. Dozens of glowing windows across the street, each one a private stage I wasn‚Äôt supposed to see. People arguing, eating, laughing, living. I told myself it was just curiosity, just something to pass the time. But the truth is, it felt wrong‚Äîand that was part of the pull. The fact that they couldn‚Äôt see me, while I could see everything, gave me a rush that was half excitement, half guilt. Like I‚Äôd crossed into a place I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be, and found it too fascinating to leave.

It‚Äôs funny how boredom makes you cross lines you swore you‚Äôd never cross.  
Loneliness teaches you habits you‚Äôd never admit in daylight.

Over the next few nights, the habit stuck. I‚Äôd come home, heat up some leftovers, maybe drink a beer, then pull the curtains just enough and lean into the scope. The apartment complex across the street turned into my private theater. Dozens of shows, none of them knowing they had an audience.

Most people would probably call it sick. And maybe it was. But for me, it was survival. Better to be the watcher than the man alone in the dark with nothing but his thoughts.

When you stare into other people‚Äôs lives long enough, you realize how predictable we all are. Most windows replay the same story, night after night.  
But every now and then, something new slips through the cracks.

It was on the eighth night that I noticed him.

A window on the eighth floor. At first glance, nothing unusual‚Äîjust a dim, bare room with yellowing wallpaper and a single bed pushed into the corner. A naked bulb dangled from the ceiling. The rest was empty: a couple chairs stacked in the corner, a rug that had seen better decades. The kind of space you‚Äôd expect in a building like this‚Äîcheap, forgotten, temporary.

But the figure on the bed was what stopped me.

He was sitting cross-legged, back straight, facing the wall. His head was completely bald, skin pale under the light. He was shirtless, skinny to the point of wrong‚Äîhis spine curved under the skin like a row of knots pulled too tight. His arms dangled long at his sides, fingertips brushing his knees. He didn‚Äôt move. Not once.

I held my breath, watching him. Maybe he was meditating. Maybe asleep sitting up. Maybe dead. Hell, maybe it wasn‚Äôt even a person‚Äîmaybe a mannequin someone left behind. I tried to convince myself of all those things, but none of them stuck. Something about him made the hair rise on the back of my neck.

I swept the scope across the wall he was staring at. Nothing there. No posters, no pictures, not even cracks that might hold his attention. Just peeling wallpaper, water stains, the color of old teeth. I shifted back to him. Still motionless. Still staring.

Most people move, even if just to scratch their nose.  
But that night, he didn‚Äôt. And I knew I‚Äôd be back at the window tomorrow.

The eighth-night discovery should have scared me off. Any reasonable man would have looked at that pale figure in the bare room, muttered something about ‚Äúnot my business,‚Äù and turned away.  
But the truth? It made me hungrier.

Soon, watching the building across the street wasn‚Äôt just a way to kill time‚Äîit was my ritual. Every evening after work, I‚Äôd heat up something cheap, crack open a beer, and settle into my spot at the window. Curtains drawn just enough, scope angled across the gap, my eye drinking in those glowing rectangles.

I had plenty of windows to choose from, but a few became my favorites.

There was the single mom with two kids. Her boys treated the living room like a trampoline park, bouncing off the couch while she dragged herself in after work. Sometimes she‚Äôd yell, sometimes she‚Äôd laugh, sometimes she just sank into the sofa with a bottle of cheap wine and stared through the TV like she was miles away. I didn‚Äôt pity her‚ÄîI respected her. She kept going, even when it was obvious she had nothing left in the tank.

Then there was the young couple. They were relentless, like they‚Äôd made a bet with themselves to see how many ways two people could wear each other out before sunrise. At first, it was entertaining‚Äîlike stumbling across a pay-per-view show for free‚Äîbut eventually it was just predictable. Still, I kept watching. Predictability can be comforting.

And then the gymnast girl. Twelve, maybe thirteen. Every night she stretched, jumped rope, practiced handstands in her tiny living room. Always in that faded leotard, hair pulled tight. No distractions, no breaks, just pure repetition. Watching her was like seeing focus distilled into a kid‚Äôs body. She reminded me that discipline was possible‚Äîeven in a place where everything else seemed to fall apart.

I never told myself they were ‚Äúneighbors.‚Äù Neighbors are people you wave to in the hallway. These weren‚Äôt people I knew; they were characters in a show only I could watch. And each of them pulled me deeper into the habit.

But the bald man‚Äîhe wasn‚Äôt just another character. He was a puzzle. And puzzles have a way of eating at you if you leave them unsolved.

A week passed. Every night, the same scene: him sitting cross-legged on the bed, motionless, eyes fixed on the wall. Sometimes the sheets on the bed looked slightly different, as if someone had changed them while I wasn‚Äôt looking. But him? He never moved.

One night, after two beers, I decided to break the script. I wanted to see if I could force something to happen.

I pulled up my phone and ordered a pizza. Large pepperoni, extra cheese. Delivery to apartment 8B‚Äîthe bald man‚Äôs floor, his window. My hands were sweating as I typed in the address. I told myself it was harmless. If he was a normal guy, he‚Äôd answer the door, pay, and eat. And I‚Äôd finally know.

Half an hour later, I spotted the delivery car pulling up to the curb. My heart thudded in my chest as the driver walked inside with the box balanced on his arm. I tightened the scope on 8B‚Äôs window, waiting for movement. Any movement.

Five minutes passed. Ten. Then, out of the corner of the scope, I caught the driver coming back out the front doors of the building.

He wasn‚Äôt carrying the pizza anymore.

Instead, he had the box open in one hand, munching on a slice, earbuds in, nodding his head to whatever he was listening to. By the time he reached his car, he was whistling, chewing happily, like nothing strange had happened at all.

I sat back, cold all over. Where had the pizza gone? Why hadn‚Äôt he taken money? Why hadn‚Äôt anyone answered? Did he just‚Ä¶ keep it for himself? Or had he gone up there, knocked, and walked away with the box untouched?

I wanted to believe the driver was just lazy, that he figured no one was home and he might as well eat it himself. But that explanation didn‚Äôt stick. Something had happened in there‚Äîsomething I couldn‚Äôt see.

That night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I lay awake with the rifle beside me, scope pointed at the window, curtains cracked just enough for me to keep watch. He was still there, sitting in the same position, like nothing had changed.

Most people, I reminded myself, live entire lives without ever being noticed. But once you notice someone like that, you can‚Äôt stop.

And the worst part?  
I was starting to feel like he‚Äôd noticed me back.

The pizza stunt should have been my wake-up call. A normal person would‚Äôve felt embarrassed, maybe laughed it off as a dumb idea, and moved on. But I wasn‚Äôt normal anymore. By then, watching that window wasn‚Äôt just a habit‚Äîit was an obsession.

Every night I found myself glued to the scope, waiting for the slightest twitch of movement. Nothing ever came. The mom yelled at her kids, the couple broke their own records, the gymnast girl trained until her arms shook. Life went on in all the other windows. But in 8B, nothing changed. A pale body sitting cross-legged, staring at the wall.

And the more nothing happened, the more it burned me alive.

I started timing how long I could keep my eye in the scope without blinking. Sometimes I sat so long I forgot to eat. Sometimes I went to bed dizzy, with black rings floating in my vision. But I kept watching.

That‚Äôs when I noticed the woman.

It was a weekday afternoon‚ÄîI‚Äôd left work early. Through the scope, I saw her slip into the room. Mid-thirties, maybe older, dark hair pulled back, moving carefully, like a nurse on rounds. She carried a tray: a small vial, a couple of boxes. She set it down on the bed beside him. Then she leaned close, pressed something against his arm. I couldn‚Äôt see clearly from my angle, but it looked like an injection. He never flinched.

When she finished, she crossed the room to the window. Instead of turning her back on him, she shuffled sideways, her face always angled toward the figure on the bed. She cracked the window, lit a cigarette, and smoked it down to the filter. Then she stubbed it out, closed the window, gathered the tray, and backed out the door‚Äînever once turning away from him.

I told myself she was a caretaker, maybe hired to look after a relative. But something about the way she moved chilled me. The way she never let him out of her sight, like she was afraid he‚Äôd pounce if she turned around.

For the next few nights, I tracked her routine. Every other day, almost to the hour, she entered with her tray, gave him the injection, smoked her cigarette, and left. Always backing out. Always keeping her eyes locked on him.

It gnawed at me until I couldn‚Äôt stand it anymore. Watching wasn‚Äôt enough. I needed to know what was happening inside that room.

So one Friday night, when I saw her leave the building with a shopping bag, I grabbed my jacket and headed across the street.

The building‚Äôs hallway smelled of dust and old cigarettes. Fluorescent lights flickered overhead, buzzing like dying insects. I climbed to the eighth floor, every step heavier than the last.

The corridor stretched out in front of me, lined with dented doors. At the far end, junk was piled high: broken furniture, boxes, a bicycle frame, a rusted wheelchair tipped against the wall. And in that cluttered corner sat the door I‚Äôd been staring at for weeks‚ÄîApartment 8B.

I stood there, heart pounding, palms sweating. What the hell was I doing? Breaking into a stranger‚Äôs apartment? Looking for what, exactly?

I told myself I‚Äôd just listen at the door, maybe confirm he was even real. But then, beneath the thud of my heartbeat, I heard it.

A sound.

‚ÄúShhhwaaaark‚Ä¶ shhhwaaaark‚Ä¶‚Äù

Slow, dragging footsteps. Getting closer.

I froze. The noise stopped right behind the door.

And then the handle began to rattle.

Not just a twist‚Äîviolent jerks, like someone was yanking it back and forth, trying to tear it off. The door groaned under sudden pressure, hinges squealing as if something heavy leaned against it from the other side.

My blood turned to ice.

Through the thin wood, I heard it: breathing. Wet, ragged, wheezing like air being forced through a crushed windpipe. Each inhale whistled, each exhale hissed, closer than I‚Äôd ever wanted it to be.

The handle kept thrashing. The frame shook. For one terrible second, I was sure it would burst open.

That broke me.

I bolted. Down the hallway, down the stairs, feet barely touching the steps. I don‚Äôt even remember crossing the lobby. All I know is I hit the cold night air like a drowning man breaking the surface.

By the time I circled the block and made it back to my own apartment, my lungs were on fire. I slammed the door, locked it, and stumbled to my window. My rifle was waiting, scope already aimed across the gap.

I pressed my eye to the glass‚Äî

And there he was.

Not cross-legged anymore. Not facing the wall.

He was standing at the window, hands spread against the glass, pale fingers scraping downward with a squeal I swore I could hear from across the street. His enormous head tilted forward, and in the glow of that naked bulb, I saw his face for the first time.

No nose, no lips. Just two cavernous pits sinking too deep into his skull, eyes that weren‚Äôt eyes at all but endless dark holes, as if they could swallow the light from my scope. And yet‚Äîat the very bottom of that darkness, something moved. A shimmer, a twitch, like a pupil shifting in a place where no eye should be. His mouth gaped open and closed, smearing spit across the glass, fingers scraping with nails too long, too sharp.

And the worst part?  
I knew he was staring directly at me.

I don‚Äôt remember pulling away from the scope. One second I was frozen there, staring into those bottomless eyes, and the next I was stumbling backward, knocking over the chair. My hands were moving on their own, reaching for the box of ammo I kept in the closet.

The rifle had always been a comfort to me‚Äîsteel and wood, simple and reliable. But loading it now felt different. My fingers fumbled as I shoved cartridges into the magazine, each metallic click ringing too loud in the silence of the room. I kept telling myself: if he moved, if he tried anything, I‚Äôd put a bullet straight through that window.

By the time I racked the bolt and raised the rifle again, my heart was beating so hard I could feel it in my teeth. I pressed my eye to the glass.

The window across the street was no longer empty. The curtains were drawn tight, swaying slightly as if someone had just pulled them shut. No pale face. No black holes for eyes. Just heavy fabric, rippling in the glow of the ceiling bulb.

I held there, waiting, the crosshairs steady on the center of the window. Sweat slid down my cheek, caught in the corner of my mouth. My finger hovered on the trigger, but there was nothing to fire at.

I stayed like that for what felt like hours. My shoulders ached, my eyes burned, but I couldn‚Äôt lower the rifle. Every second I expected those curtains to twitch, to slide open, to reveal that face pressed against the glass again.

They never did.

When I finally lowered the rifle, the apartment felt colder, emptier than before. Sometimes silence doesn‚Äôt mean safety. Sometimes it only means something dangerous learned how to wait. The moment something breaks its own pattern, you realize you were never the one in control. As if he hadn‚Äôt disappeared, just‚Ä¶ stepped out of view. As if he was still there, inches from the fabric, waiting for me to let my guard down.

And I realized something that made my stomach twist: he‚Äôd never once moved while I was watching. But tonight, he had chosen to.

I moved out the very next morning. No questions, no excuses‚Äîjust cash on the table for the landlord and a half-hearted promise to forward the mail I knew I‚Äôd never see. He didn‚Äôt ask why. Maybe he saw the look on my face and decided he didn‚Äôt want the answer.

The weeks that followed blurred together. New job sites, new temporary housing, different walls to stare at when sleep refused to come. I told myself I‚Äôd left it behind on that street in Detroit, left him behind.

But the truth? He followed me.

Not in the daylight‚Äîno. In the daylight, I can almost convince myself it was nothing, that I imagined the whole thing. But at night, in dreams too sharp to be dreams, I hear it. The frantic rattle of a doorknob, the hinges straining as something leans its weight against my door. That wheezing, broken breath sliding through the cracks.

And every time, I reach for my rifle. I load it, I raise it, I press the trigger‚Äî  
and every time, it jams.

So I clean it. Again and again. I polish the barrel, I oil the bolt, I run patches until the cloth comes out white. I tell myself it won‚Äôt fail me again.

But what bothers me most isn‚Äôt the dreams.  
It‚Äôs the memory of that night‚Äîwhen he saw me.

You can leave a place behind, but not the things that noticed you there.  
A weapon is supposed to give you certainty. But once doubt creeps in, even steel feels fragile.

And since then, I‚Äôm not sure I trust my rifle anymore.

1n0x1bq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n0x1bq,I launched a photo cleaner app. Today I used it myself for 5 minutes and easily cleared 2GB of storage!,"**Why I Built This App**

The app lets you quickly select and batch delete photos and videos by swiping or tapping buttons. While there are similar apps on the market, I couldn't find any with the specific features I wanted.

I made a feature to group photos and **display storage by month** (screenshot 3), allowing you to identify which months are taking the most space and prioritize cleaning those first. I also included **filters to see only videos or photos**, as videos consume more storage space.

I also wanted a better UX for my large photo library. As you can see (screenshot 2 or 3), I have large number of photos and videos in my library. I've used other apps and always find my fingers getting tired from cycling through my endless photos. I added buttons at the bottom to delete or navigate quickly through the library, plus a scrub bar that you can pan across to move even faster. (screenshot 4)

**Pricing**

**Free trial 7 days!**

monthly subscription for $0.99

yearly for $3.99

lifetime access **only $4.99 (it's an early bird price, and we all hate subscriptions)** 

(for the price of a cup of coffee, you'll own the app lifetime!)

Hi, wonder if anyone could help me improve my supplement routine. I‚Äôve been reading so much online my head is spinning and the GP is not helpful. 
I am 41yo f with non alcoholic mild fatty liver, mild pcos, insulin resistance. Awful brain fog and fatigue, energy so low I only have about 3-4hrs of productivity, at times cannot form sentences, words just wouldn‚Äôt leave my mouth or I say the wrong thing, memory is quite patchy and unreliable, wake up groggy and tired. Gone up one size in the last few years and cannot lose it. Been practicing intermittent fasting for a month now to see if that changes anything. Mostly vegetarian diet, I eat well - plenty of veggies, pulses, fermented foods and yogurt. Physical activity - 10k steps almost every day, 45 min of core exercises once a week, and hour of yoga once a week - physically and mentally cannot do any more. 

From what I understand my folate (10.7 ug/l) ferritin (57 ug/l) and b12 (273 ug/l) levels are suboptimal.

My routine now is as follows:
Ashwagandha and 600 mg NAC in the morning (+2 small cups of black coffee)
1000 mg Myo Inositol and 22 mg Chelated Zinc in the afternoon 
200 mg Ferrous sulfate with 500 mg vitamin C before bed

I am looking to add a multivitamin complex, B12 and Omega 3, perhaps magnesium glycinate. Have really high hopes for B12 but unclear if it needs to be taken with folate? I currently do not want to include vit D as a few months ago my levels appeared to be too high (129 nmol/l).

Any insights or pointers to older post addressing similar issues hugely appreciated!

hihi. I just wanna say, if this post comes off as too serious, it's cause I'm at least a bit nervous about what to write. I like coming across as silly and dumb often, but am often just too shy to do so, and publicly posting on Reddit is not great for shy. also just when not around the right people its kinda hard.



Just gonna be honest rather than embellish stuff. I spend all my time at home, either playing games (only on PC), watching things, listening to music, or sleeping. I do a lot of sleeping lol.



I recently got a new GPU so i could play more demanding games, but i really just sort of play anything. My steam is in my bio if you want to check it out to see if there's any stuff we might have in common (since it's not on Steam, also gonna say yeah I do play minecraft, but just not very often, and if its something you wanna play then im up for it :)). I play stuff all the time, but I really prefer playing with people and would always be up to play just about whatever as long as it's with someone. i really dont play pvp stuff though. Other than playing stuff with a friend though, i've pretty much exclusively been playing OSRS again as of late. I play an ironman (would \*love\* to do a group if someone were up for it), and actually just like a week ago got the agility pet :)) it's IM\_SamGrey if you wanna check out the stats



As for stuff I watch, I don't really watch many shows or movies anymore, but I'd be up for doing so with someone again. As far as favourite shows go though, I really love Hannibal and House and have watched them both many times. Those are the two like more serious shows anyway. But yeah, nowadays I mostly spend time watching YouTube, and on that it's variety of stuff, from science/technical stuff, gaming, people like CoffeeZilla, etc. Though I mainly just end up going down a rabbit hole and watching content only related to specific things for a while. 



I can be pretty shy, am very lonely, I care a lot about people and think about them all the time even when not talking (and am mostly not talking cause feel like I said too much and have to minimise the 'weird' that is me, am just plain sleeping, or am kinda depressed), and won't lie am also pretty depressed a lot of the time. I try to hide that and instead act at least positively with people so I come off as more likeable, but I think saying that upfront is probably important cause i don't want someone to come thinking that i'm always gonna be the happiest person. Also just i don't need someone to relate in the sense of feeling like i need comfort, i don't, but it would be nice if you relate / understand so that you don't get disappointed cause you thought I was gonna be something that i'm not.



Also if it isn't obvious, while yeah I am shy, I do talk a lot. Not like this length really, don't worry, but just more than most people I've talked to. And I use Discord and would always wanna move onto that if we get along.



If you somehow had the patience to read that wall of text and feel we might maybe just a tiny little bit get along, then feel free to dm. And please don't just say hi. I don't really have a problem with it, but just I won't have any idea what to say back. Tell me about yourself or something idk. You do you.

hihi. I just wanna say, if this post comes off as too serious, it's cause I'm at least a bit nervous about what to write. I like coming across as silly and dumb often, but am often just too shy to do so, and publicly posting on Reddit is not great for shy. also just when not around the right people its kinda hard.



Just gonna be honest rather than embellish stuff. I spend all my time at home, either playing games (only on PC), watching things, listening to music, or sleeping. I do a lot of sleeping lol.



I recently got a new GPU so i could play more demanding games, but i really just sort of play anything. My steam is in my bio if you want to check it out to see if there's any stuff we might have in common (since it's not on Steam, also gonna say yeah I do play minecraft, but just not very often, and if its something you wanna play then im up for it :)). I play stuff all the time, but I really prefer playing with people and would always be up to play just about whatever as long as it's with someone. i really dont play pvp stuff though. Other than playing stuff with a friend though, i've pretty much exclusively been playing OSRS again as of late. I play an ironman (would \*love\* to do a group if someone were up for it), and actually just like a week ago got the agility pet :)) it's IM\_SamGrey if you wanna check out the stats

I have lived my life with two swords, and in these walls I carry a third, the bean. The way of coffee and the way of the sword are not separate. Both demand patience, discipline, and a hand that does not tremble.

When I grind the beans, I grind as I carved the Book of Five Rings: slow, precise, inevitable.
When I pour water, I pour as one who cuts; with timing, with flow, with purpose.
When I drink, I drink in silence, for the true battle is not against bitterness, but against the weakness of one‚Äôs own spirit.

Take this lesson: if you cannot master the cup, you cannot master the blade.

how quickly and irreversibly transactions confirm.

Bitcoin :
Confirmations are *probabilistic*. Each block adds security, but it's not instant. 

For high confidence (say, 6 confirmations to avoid double-spends), you're looking at ~1 hour on average (blocks every ~10 mins). It's secure but slow, not ideal for quick coffee buys.

Reversals are possible in theory via chain reorgs, though rare in bitcoin but happening now in Other PoW chains 

Nano

*deterministic* finality. Using a block-lattice and Open Representative Voting (ORV), transactions confirm under 1 second! 

Once voted on by reps, it's irreversible. No mining, no fees, feeless and eco-friendly. Perfect for microtransactions or daily use.

- Opening Day is set for March 25, 2026, the earliest start since the league‚Äôs modern schedule began.
- The Giants‚ÄëYankees matchup revives a historic rivalry and will launch the season.
- MLB shifted the calendar forward by several days to allow more flexibility with television contracts, weather considerations, and postseason timing.
- An earlier start gives colder‚Äëmarket teams extra preparation time and provides a milder climate for the West Coast opener.
- Oracle Park will offer early‚Äëmorning coffee, breakfast menus, kids‚Äô zones, limited‚Äëedition apparel, and social‚Äëmedia contests for fans.
- The advanced start may compress the schedule later in the year, potentially leading to doubleheaders or shorter turnarounds.

Why it matters: The earlier start could change the season‚Äôs pacing, affect player preparation, and set the tone for fan engagement nationwide.

Dawg, youthfulness doesn't make you invincible or invulnerable. Nothing does. As soon as you're born, you're screaming with pain. Once you finally perish, you just learn how to ask the right sources for medicine strong enough to keep you numb and silent. Yet the pain never truly disappears, you're just able to ignore it while your body's plugged up with laughing gas or jungle juice or gobstoppers.

Life was never meant to be anything else except painful. Whenever I see someone trying their hardest to disprove or disregard that, that alone is painful to witness. Like a fish that's frantically floundering out of water, they flop and flail about as they try to fling out optimistic comments to extinguish or muffle mine. You have nothing to fear from pessimism or cynicism other than disillusion, but why must so many constantly flee to a world of fantasy and imagination to help them bear the burden of a failing and crumbling world? Why must they build invisible gates around their perspective to treat providers of truth like they're foul and barbaric enemies?

By all means, smash that mf laugh react and join in with the rest of the jolly jesters who can barely conjure enough brainpower to type out ""TL;DR"".

""Lily, you must marry that comatose man James in place of my daughter. This is what you owe the Ginger family! You‚Äî""  
  
""I will.""  
  
Lily‚Äôs reply made her foster mother gasp in disbelief. ‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù  
  
Lily could understand her shock. After all, in this massive capital city, who didn‚Äôt know how madly she was in love with John Jones? She‚Äôd loved him so much she‚Äôd given up her future, her dignity‚Äîeverything.  
  
She had refused her foster mother many times before, all because of John. Her foster mother clearly hadn‚Äôt expected her to actually agree this time‚Äîto marry a total stranger who lay in a vegetative state.  
  
Calm and numb, Lily repeated, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it.‚Äù  
  
Once it was clear Lily was serious, her foster mother let out a breath of relief before snapping at her again. ‚ÄúOne month from now, the Luke family will register your marriage with their eldest son. They have decided on that day, and it's final. Someone will come to pick you up for the wedding that day. I‚Äôve already accepted the bride price from the Luke family. It‚Äôs what you owe the Ginger family, and I‚Äôm not giving it back. If you dare go back on your word or stir up trouble, I will...‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI won‚Äôt,‚Äù Lily cut her off coldly.  
  
‚ÄúThe Luke family is rich. I trust the bride price was generous. You took me in from the orphanage and raised me for sixteen years. Now I‚Äôll take your daughter‚Äôs place and marry into the Luke family. That settles my debt to you and the Ginger family. From now on, we owe each other nothing.‚Äù  
  
With that, she hung up.  
  
Sitting quietly at the dining table, Lily couldn‚Äôt help but reopen the news article she‚Äôd just seen.  
  
It was everywhere‚Äîvideos of John and Elsa Quinn‚Äôs wedding flooded the internet, dominating the trending charts.  
  
In the video, he and Elsa stood hand in hand, surrounded by their friends, vowing to spend their lives together.  
  
The entire internet was offering their blessings, rejoicing that the two had reunited and wishing them a lifetime of happiness.  
  
Everyone except Lily.  
  
Because John was her boyfriend‚Äîthe man she had loved with all her heart.  
  
Four years ago, he‚Äôd been paralyzed in a car accident. The cold-hearted Jones family had abandoned him, and Elsa had gone abroad and married someone else.  
  
Back when Lily was being bullied, he was the one who had pulled her out of it.  
  
She had loved him in secret for so long. On that freezing, snowy night when he had tried to end it all, she brought him home.  
  
She did everything she could to take care of him, to lift him out of the darkness one step at a time.  
  
She‚Äôd heard about a hospital overseas that could help him walk again. To raise the money, she sold her blood, became a punching bag for rich people, ending up with three broken ribs‚Ä¶  
  
She suffered endlessly, but finally, two years ago, she scraped together enough for the surgery.  
  
It was a success. He could walk again. He kissed her and promised he would treat her well for the rest of his life, that he would never let her down.  
  
She had believed that everything they‚Äôd been through was finally behind them, and from then on, it would all be smooth sailing.  
  
She never expected things to fall apart the moment Elsa came back.  
  
Word had it Elsa was gravely ill and only had six months to live. Her last wish was to marry John.  
  
He couldn‚Äôt bear to see the woman he once loved suffer, so the wedding Lily had spent six painstaking months preparing became Elsa‚Äôs.  
  
The wedding dress Lily had sewn with her own hands‚ÄîElsa wore it.  
  
The diamond ring John had custom-ordered for her‚ÄîElsa wore it on her left ring finger.  
  
Through blurred vision, Lily saw a pendant around Elsa‚Äôs neck.  
  
She recognized it instantly.  
  
It was the keepsake her parents had left her.  
  
She had lost it while trying to save John.  
  
He had once told her he found it and would give it to her on her birthday.  
  
But now, just because Elsa had said she liked it‚Ä¶ he gave it to her instead.  
  
Suddenly, Lily realized there was no point in loving someone like John.  
  
She didn‚Äôt call him. Didn‚Äôt beg him to come back.  
  
She simply lit the candle on her birthday cake and stared blankly as it slowly burned down. The whipped cream cake melted into a mess‚Äîjust like her love for John, which had burned to ash overnight, leaving not a trace of warmth.  
  
It was nearly dawn when John finally came home.  
  
When he saw her sitting at the dining table with red eyes, clearly having stayed up all night, his brows furrowed tightly.  
  
‚ÄúWhy haven‚Äôt you gone to bed?‚Äù  
  
Lily ignored his question and said calmly, ‚ÄúJohn, let‚Äôs break up. And tell Elsa to return my parents‚Äô keepsake as soon as possible.‚Äù  
  
John immediately understood‚Äîshe must‚Äôve seen the news about his wedding with Elsa and was feeling jealous.  
  
He didn‚Äôt like it when women got jealous over nothing, but he had never once thought of leaving her. So he softened his voice.  
  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be mad. I didn‚Äôt forget your birthday. This is your gift.‚Äù  
  
He opened a sleek burgundy velvet jewelry box in front of her.  
  
Inside lay a pink diamond necklace.  
  
The exquisite gem shimmered under the light. The centerpiece‚Äîa pink diamond the size of a pigeon‚Äôs egg‚Äîsparkled brilliantly.  
  
It was far more expensive than the pendant her parents had left her. But it wasn‚Äôt what she wanted.  
  
Just like how she no longer wanted him.  
  
John knew better than anyone how deeply Lily loved him, how she couldn‚Äôt live without him.  
  
When she stayed quiet, he thought it meant she was done throwing a fit.  
  
He reached for the necklace, intending to put it on her.  
  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want this necklace! I just want my parents‚Äô keepsake!‚Äù  
  
Lily slapped the necklace away and said stubbornly, ‚ÄúThat pendant was left to me by my parents. How could you give it to Elsa? I only want that pendant!‚Äù  
  
*Still throwing a tantrum...*  
  
John‚Äôs patience snapped.  
  
His chiseled face turned cold and hard, like it had been carved from ice, filled with a sharp, suffocating pressure.  
  
‚ÄúElsa really likes that pendant.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs so sick‚Äîhow much longer do you think she‚Äôll even get to wear it? Why must you fight over something with someone who's already dying? Lily, when did you become so selfish and heartless?‚Äù        

**Chapter 2 She Bloomed Like a Rose and Entangled Him Without Mercy**



*Selfish. Cold-blooded. Fighting a dying woman over a pendant‚Ä¶*  
  
But that pendant was hers‚Äîleft to her by her parents. What was so wrong about wanting it back?  
  
Did he really expect her to keep sacrificing everything for him after being betrayed so completely? Was she supposed to grovel after being humiliated like that?  
  
*She wasn‚Äôt that pathetic.*  
  
Before she could even say a word, John‚Äôs phone rang shrilly.  
  
It was a call from Elsa.  
  
Her voice was weak and pained. ‚ÄúJohn, I just threw up blood. I feel awful‚Ä¶ Can you come be with me?‚Äù  
  
John paused.  
  
He hadn‚Äôt even managed to calm Lily down yet.  
  
But he figured Lily would never really leave him, and Elsa was already seriously ill. So he made his decision.  
  
‚ÄúElsa, don‚Äôt cry. I‚Äôm on my way.‚Äù  
  
Hearing her choked sobs, he didn‚Äôt bother explaining to Lily anymore. He turned around and left the room without looking back.  
  
As the front door slammed shut, Lily let out a cold laugh and kicked the diamond necklace into a corner.  
  
It had been like this ever since Elsa came back a month ago.  
  
Every time Elsa felt a little uncomfortable or upset, he would drop everything to run to her.  
  
Rain or shine, day or night‚Äîhe was always there for her.  
  
It was like all those sweet whispers he‚Äôd once murmured to Lily, all those promises of eternal love, had been nothing but a dream.  
  
But luckily, it was all about to end.  
  
In one month, she‚Äôd marry James.  
  
Then John could stop worrying about her clinging to him, and go be happy with his precious crush. What a perfect outcome.  
  
Funny thing was‚Äîher wedding day would be on John‚Äôs birthday.  
  
His birthday, her wedding. Two celebrations on the same day. *Poetic, really.*  
  
As far as Lily was concerned, once she broke up with John, he was no longer her boyfriend. She had no reason to stay in his villa.  
  
And it just so happened to be a Sunday. She spent the whole day packing everything she owned.  
  
She sold what she could, tossed the rest.  
  
She‚Äôd contacted the biggest luxury resale company in Capital City. The staff came straight to her door, and her used bags and jewelry sold for a total of twenty million.  
  
She didn‚Äôt transfer a cent to John. She kept it all.  
  
She earned that money. It was hers.  
  
As night fell, Lily shredded the last tie she‚Äôd ever made for John, threw it away, and returned to her room.  
  
She was just about to leave with her suitcase when she noticed the photo on her nightstand.  
  
In the picture, she leaned against John‚Äôs shoulder, smiling brightly. He was gazing down at her with what looked like affection.  
  
John had always hated taking photos.  
  
This one was taken on her birthday last year, after she begged and pestered him nonstop. It was the only photo they had together.  
  
She had treasured it like gold.  
  
As soon as it was printed, she placed it on her nightstand and looked at it every single day. Even on business trips, she would take it with her.  
  
Now, all she felt was mockery.  
  
She smashed the frame against the floor and tossed it in the trash.  
  
‚Ä¶  
  
By the time John came home, it was late at night.  
  
He parked in front of the main house and immediately noticed the living room was dark.  
  
The sight made him vaguely uncomfortable.  
  
He often came home late from social events.  
  
But no matter how late it was, Lily would always leave the lights on for him.  
  
That single light in the night had always guided him home. So before Elsa returned, he had never once stayed out all night.  
  
He figured Lily was still sulking.  
  
Knowing her, she was probably curled up on the couch waiting for him to coax her.  
  
‚ÄúLily.‚Äù  
  
He snapped out of his thoughts and walked quickly into the living room, flipping on the lights.  
  
To his surprise, she wasn‚Äôt there.  
  
She wasn‚Äôt dozing on the couch like usual, struggling to keep her eyes open after waiting so long, ready to stumble into the kitchen and make some ginger tea for him.  
  
The living room felt‚Ä¶ emptier.  
  
He couldn‚Äôt quite put his finger on what was missing, but it felt cold.  
  
‚ÄúSir, you‚Äôre back.‚Äù  
  
Hearing him, Mandy rushed out of her room. ‚ÄúDid you drink, sir? I‚Äôll make you some ginger tea.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúNo need.‚Äù  
  
John wasn‚Äôt in the mood. He rushed upstairs and headed straight to Lily‚Äôs room.  
  
She wasn‚Äôt there.  
  
The room itself was empty.  
  
The potted plants by the windowsill were gone. Even her pillows and bedding had vanished.  
  
The space used to be so cozy‚Äîplush toys, crystal bead curtains, whimsical wall stickers‚Ä¶  
  
Now, it was nothing but cold black and white.  
  
The sterile atmosphere irritated him.  
  
He turned around and asked Mandy in a chilling voice, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Lily?‚Äù  
  
His presence was so cold, it made Mandy shiver.  
  
She drew in a deep breath before answering honestly, ‚ÄúMiss Lily said‚Ä¶ she broke up with you. And that she‚Äôs not coming back.‚Äù  
  
John was stunned into laughter by the nonsense Lily had left behind.  
  
*So she was still throwing a tantrum?*  
  
*Running away from home?*  
  
*She really thought she had guts now, huh?*  
  
‚ÄúMandy, leave.‚Äù  
  
Once she was gone, John dialed his assistant Wayne, face still cold, and ordered him to find out what hotel Lily was staying in.  
  
She had no family in Capital City. In such a rush, she couldn‚Äôt possibly have found a proper place to live.  
  
Running away in anger‚Äîshe could only have gone to a hotel.  
  
Wayne worked fast. It didn‚Äôt take long before he confirmed she was at Capital City First Hotel.  
  
‚ÄúLily, how long are you going to keep this up?‚Äù  
  
John typed the message into the chat app‚Äîbut then he stopped.  
  
And deleted it.  
  
Because he realized the photo frame on the nightstand was gone.  
  
He knew better than anyone how much Lily had treasured that photo.  
  
Even if she was throwing a fit, she must have taken it with her. No way she‚Äôd just walk out for good.  
  
He didn‚Äôt need to message her.  
  
Four years ago, the Ginger family kicked her out. Her biological parents had died when she was six. She‚Äôd had no home since then.  
  
If she didn‚Äôt come back to him‚Äîwhere else could she go?  
  
Since Elsa returned, they‚Äôd argued countless times.  
  
And every single time, she was the one who apologized first.  
  
*This time would be no different. It was only a matter of time.*  
  
‚Ä¶  
  
In the month since Elsa came back, Lily had been plagued by so many negative emotions that she hadn‚Äôt had a good night‚Äôs sleep.  
  
But now that she was free of that cage, she slept like a baby.  
  
Packing up the day before had drained her energy. Her calves were sore and aching‚Äîshe really wanted to stay in bed.  
  
But it was a weekday. She had to go resign from Jones Corp.  
  
All those years with John, she‚Äôd built her life around him.  
  
When he was struggling, she worked herself to the bone to pay for his treatment. After he became successful, she became his personal assistant and cared for him in every detail.  
  
Now that she was done with him, there was no reason to keep that job either.  
  
She wanted to chase her childhood dream‚Äîto become a great voice actress.  
  
‚ÄúLily, my stomach hurts so bad, I can‚Äôt hold it anymore!‚Äù  
  
Lily had just arrived at the secretarial department when the new girl, Yulia Xander, ran up to her in a panic.  
  
Yulia looked absolutely pitiful. ‚ÄúMr. John needs this file urgently. Can you please bring it to the CEO‚Äôs office for me?‚Äù  
  
She was clearly in crisis mode.  
  
Before Lily could even agree, Yulia had already dashed off toward the restroom in a very awkward pose.  
  
Lily didn‚Äôt want to see John.  
  
But it was obvious Yulia was desperate.  
  
She had a good impression of the girl and didn‚Äôt want her getting chewed out by the boss. So she took the file and headed for the CEO‚Äôs office.  
  
The door was slightly ajar.  
  
Lily raised her hand to knock‚Äîthen froze.  
  
She heard Elsa‚Äôs coy, flirty voice.  
  
‚ÄúJohn, my ankle suddenly hurts so much!‚Äù  
  
Her hand hovered over the door, then lightly pushed it open a crack.  
  
Through the narrow gap, she saw Elsa‚Äôs body suddenly go limp‚Äîand fall into John‚Äôs lap.  
  
‚ÄúElsa‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
John seemed startled and instinctively grabbed her waist, probably afraid she‚Äôd get hurt.  
  
But even after regaining her balance, Elsa didn‚Äôt move.  
  
She hooked her arms around his neck, bright and alluring like a rose in full bloom.  
  
‚ÄúJohn, I suddenly want to kiss you. What should I do?‚Äù  
  
As she spoke, her dewy red lips slowly pressed toward his‚Äî  
  
And John didn‚Äôt move away.       

**Chapter 3 Spiraling, Unraveling, Lost in Her Wake**



""Lily...""  
  
Wayne Hunter had come to the CEO's office to give his report.  
  
Most employees at Jones Corp had no idea about Lily and John‚Äôs relationship.  
But Wayne, trusted by John for years, knew everything.  
  
Seeing Lily, he instinctively greeted her‚Äîonly to catch sight of what was happening inside the office.  
  
He froze, horrified.  
  
Then quickly slapped a hand over his mouth.  
  
He looked at Lily, his eyes full of awkwardness and sympathy.  
  
""Elsa, I‚Äôm sorry.""  
  
John had been momentarily distracted, stunned for a good ten seconds before he quickly pulled away from Elsa.  
  
""I'm not blaming you,"" Elsa said coyly, cheeks flushed. ""My shoelace came undone.""  
  
Hearing that, Lily‚Äôs dull gaze dropped to Elsa‚Äôs shoes.  
  
Elsa was stunning.  
  
Bright, bold, beautiful in an almost aggressive way.  
  
Today, she wore crisp designer white sneakers, paired with a white blouse and a pleated pink skirt. Youthful and radiant, she looked exactly like a campus sweetheart.  
  
John didn‚Äôt say anything.  
  
But his actions spoke louder.  
  
He gently lifted Elsa onto the desk, then knelt to tie her shoelace. His movements were so careful, they almost looked reverent.  
  
Watching his long, elegant fingers slowly and intently tie the lace, Lily couldn‚Äôt help but remember something.  
  
Back then, when their love was still new, he had once said to her, *‚Äú*Lily, meeting you is the happiest thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me. I‚Äôll protect you, treasure you, never let you suffer. Never betray you.‚Äù  
  
She had believed him with all her heart, like a fool, thinking she was the luckiest girl in the world.  
  
One day, while they were walking hand in hand, they saw a guy bending to tie his girlfriend‚Äôs shoelace. She‚Äôd snuggled into John‚Äôs arms and teased, ‚ÄúWould you tie mine if it came undone?‚Äù  
  
He had answered that it was pointless to compare things like that‚Äîtoo childish.  
  
It was obvious what he meant: no, he wouldn‚Äôt.  
  
John was like a cold, distant mountain capped with snow. She thought his aloofness made sense‚Äîit wasn't in his nature to stoop for something so small.  
  
As long as she had a place in his heart, it was enough.  
  
But now, seeing him so tenderly kneeling for Elsa, Lily finally understood. Love could win anyone over if their love was with the right person.  
  
All his so-called principles, all his ‚Äúcan‚Äôts,‚Äù were never about principle.  
  
*He just didn‚Äôt love her.*  
  
And that was fine. They would both start new lives.  
  
It was fine.  
  
She stood outside the door, quietly watching as he tied Elsa‚Äôs laces, then began to massage her ankle.  
  
Watching the way they looked at each other, the unspoken affection sparking between them...  
  
She watched as the boy she had once loved so deeply blurred into a vague, unfamiliar shadow.  
  
When Elsa threw herself into John‚Äôs arms again, Lily didn‚Äôt linger.  
  
She turned and walked quickly toward the stairwell.  
  
""Ms. Lily!""  
  
Wayne had seen everything Lily had done for John over the years.  
  
The moment she turned to leave, he ran after her, worried.  
  
Normally quick with words, he found himself at a loss. That scene just now had been too damning. He didn‚Äôt know what to say to comfort her.  
  
Pushing his gold-rimmed glasses up his nose, he finally spoke awkwardly. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt read into it. Honestly, the boss still really loves you. The last time you two fought, he got drunk and kept calling your name. He‚Äî‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWayne, I‚Äôve already broken up with John.‚Äù  
  
Lily knew Wayne meant well, but she didn‚Äôt let him finish.  
  
Ignoring the shock in his eyes, she continued, ‚ÄúHe loves me? He loves me, so he married Elsa on my birthday? He loves me, so he‚Äôs tangled up with her like that, unable to let go? That kind of love‚ÄîI don‚Äôt want it. Wayne, I‚Äôve already written my resignation. Please sign it when you have a moment.‚Äù  
  
Wayne was the head of the secretary department. Lily didn‚Äôt need John‚Äôs signature to quit‚Äîbut she did need his.  
  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really sure about this? Does the boss know?‚Äù  
  
Wayne had always been loyal to John.  
  
He didn‚Äôt want John getting back together with Elsa, not after she abandoned him when he was at his lowest.  
  
But after Elsa came back, he saw how John had treated her, and he knew it wasn‚Äôt fair to Lily.  
  
Deep down, Wayne understood‚Äîleaving John might actually be the best thing for her.  
  
That night, John got drunk after arguing with Lily; he hadn‚Äôt just called her name. He‚Äôd insisted she was his wife. When Elsa came in, John had pushed her away.  
  
Wayne knew John felt guilty that Elsa was dying.  
  
But somewhere along the way, he‚Äôd fallen for Lily too.  
  
Still, not wanting to make a move without permission, Wayne decided to speak with John before signing anything.  
  
‚ÄúMs. Lily, you‚Äôre giving this directly to the boss? I‚Äôll bring it to him. I‚Äôll talk to him first. If he agrees, I‚Äôll sign it.‚Äù  
  
Lily had wanted to finalize her resignation as soon as possible.  
  
But she didn‚Äôt want to make things difficult for Wayne. She handed over the file and returned to her office to wait.  
  
Even if John didn‚Äôt approve it, she wouldn‚Äôt be coming in tomorrow.  
  
She liked finishing what she started, but there was no point dragging out something that no longer mattered.  
  
‚Ä¶  
  
That afternoon, after confirming Elsa had left, Wayne went to John‚Äôs office.  
  
As soon as he stepped in, he saw John‚Äôs face was thunderous.  
  
‚ÄúBoss‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWho made this coffee?‚Äù  
  
John glared at the cup on his desk like it had personally offended him.  
  
Wayne instantly understood what was going on.  
  
He hadn‚Äôt signed Lily‚Äôs resignation yet‚Äîbut she‚Äôd already given up and stopped working.  
  
The coffee John used to drink was always brewed by Lily herself.  
  
Wayne had tasted it before‚Äîso good that even top baristas would struggle to replicate it.  
  
Compared to hers, anyone else‚Äôs brew might as well have been sewage. Of course John hated it.  
  
Wayne swallowed hard and said honestly, ‚ÄúBoss, it wasn‚Äôt Ms. Lily. She just‚Ä¶ she submitted her resignation. Should I sign it?‚Äù  
  
*Resign?*  
  
John‚Äôs expression darkened even further.

A man's resonant tone pierced the stillness of the room. ""Does it h\*\*t?""  
  
Heavy, uneven breaths thickened the air. He loomed above, every muscle tense as he struggled to coax a response from the woman pi\*\*ed beneath him. She resisted, her body stiff and unyielding, forcing him to try again and again.   
  
Maybe it was the liquor dulling their senses, but his hand slid to her narrow waist, gently steering her closer, trying to ease the tension between them.   
  
Only when the first light of dawn spilled across the tangled sheets did the two figures finally fall silent, ex\*\*ustion overtaking them both.   
  
The hush was broken by the hiss of water in the bathroom. Evelina Quinn stirred, emerging from the depths of sl\*\*p. Wrapped tightly in the blanket, she hugged herself, mind racing to piece together the fragments of last night.   
  
Yesterday, she had celebrated her engagement to Cole Dawson.   
  
Their families had gone all out for the event, hosting a lavish party crowded with powerful business associates from both sides.   
  
Night had already settled in when Cole's friends gathered for drinks. Evelina, unable to voice her refusals, kept accepting glass after glass until the room blurred.   
  
The last thing she remembered was Cole gently steering her toward the presidential suite at the very top.   
  
The rest vanished in a haze of al\*\*hol--except for the fragments that surfaced now and then: heated touches, uneven breaths, and a night of passion.   
  
A sudden hush fell as the water in the bathroom cut off. The door swung open, sending out a warm rush of steam. A man strode out, a towel slung low on his hips, his powerful build unmistakable--broad shoulders tapering to a lean waist, beads of water tracking over sculpted muscle.   
  
Evelina, recalling her first in\*\*mate experience with her fianc√© from last night, flushed and quickly looked away, her heart pounding as she struggled not to relive the intense moments that had unfolded in the dark.   
  
""You are awake."" Andreas Wright tilted an eyebrow, his gaze locked on Evelina curled beneath the covers. Even now, a faint blush lingered on her soft cheeks, her skin so flawless he imagined a single touch might leave a mark. He looked utterly enthralled, eyes glinting with a predatory satisfaction.   
  
A chill threaded through Evelina as his voice broke the silence. That was not Cole's voice!   
  
She jerked her head up, locking eyes with the man--and was instantly met with a stormy, penetrating stare that radiated raw dominance.   
  
Shock drained the color from her face. The moment she recognized his features, her breath caught and her thoughts scattered, panic rising in her ch\*\*t. Tears slipped silently from her wide eyes, staining the tangled bedsheets.   
  
The truth struck Evelina all at once--every trace of warmth and happiness from the previous night had come from a man she'd never even met.   
  
Her whole body shook as silent sobs racked her frame, tears spilling down her cheeks. Panic and despair swallowed her, leaving her grasping for answers. Her trembling hands flew through the air, signing again and again.   
  
""Who are you? Why are you here? Were you really the one with me last night?""  
  
Andreas blinked, a flicker of surprise crossing his face when he noticed she couldn't speak.   
  
Now it made sense--her soundless cries and silent suffering from the night before.   
  
He stared at her, eyes dark and impossible to read, the tension in the room thickening with every heartbeat.   
  
Dragging in a heavy breath, Andreas pressed his fingers to his temples, fighting a throbbing headache and a wave of anger that burned in his ch\*\*t. He'd barely set foot back in the country before his old friends cornered him at a bar, drowning him in drinks and shoving a hotel key into his hand as some sort of comforting gift for his breakup.   
  
The room was heavy with shadows, the air thick from too many drinks. He could still recall how she had leaned in, stealing that first, unexpected k\*\*s. The thrill had swept him along, and in his intoxication, he'd never bothered to check who she was before giving in to the allure.   
  
Now, seeing her wide-eyed and shaken, he couldn't fathom her sudden panic--especially after she'd made the first move.   
  
Andreas dragged a hand through his hair, lips twisting into a scornful half-smile. ""Whatever you're trying to say, I don't get it. Just get dressed and go.""  
  
Evelina realized she couldn't stay hidden beneath the covers forever. She hurried into her clothes, fumbling with her torn underwear and settling for whatever she could manage.   
  
At last, she forced herself to stand tall in front of him.   
  
Andreas lingered near the window, caught off guard by the sight before him.   
  
In the quiet glow of morning, Evelina stood there--her features delicate, eyes hauntingly luminous, lips bitten and faintly swollen. Her dark hair tumbled in wild tangles down her back, mascara smudged beneath eyes still rimmed red from crying. Even disheveled, she had an inexplicable allure, vulnerable yet breathtaking.   
  
The bed behind her was a chaotic mess, white sheets twisted and stained with a vivid red mark that drew Andreas's gaze, tightening something in his ch\*\*t as the truth hit him--last night had been her first time.   
  
Seeing her standing there, unwilling to leave, Andreas understood why. Without a word, he pulled out a stack of cash and forced it into Evelina's hand.   
  
He didn't bother to hide his contempt. ""Will this cover it? Or do you want more...""  
  
Before he could finish, Evelina hurled it straight at his ch\*\*t, her eyes flashing with silent fury.   
  
His expression twisted into a dangerous smirk. ""What's wrong? Not enough for you? My buddy already paid the middleman a fortune just to set this up. Didn't you check the going rate before selling yourself? Or are you trying to squeeze out a bigger payout? Keep dreaming...""  
  
Evelina's slap cracked through the room, stopping Andreas cold. He staggered, wiped the bl\*\*d from his mouth, and shot her a look that could have ki\*\*ed. For a moment, it seemed like he might lunge at her. His voice dropped, rough and seething. ""I don't care how you managed to get in here. But you're the one who threw yourself at me last night, so drop the act‚Ä¶""  
  
Evelina couldn't stand another word. Choking back tears, she bolted from the room, her shoes crunching over the scattered money as she ran.   
  
On the curb, she waved down a taxi with trembling hands, switched her phone back on, and was instantly flooded with missed calls and frantic messages.   
  
She tapped her destination into her notes app and held it up for the driver to read.   
  
City lights blurred past the window, but Evelina barely noticed. Her mind spun, replaying the man's harsh words on an endless loop. None of it made sense. The stranger she'd woken up beside--how had her life unraveled so completely overnight?   
  
The taxi finally pulled up in front of an imposing villa. Evelina paid and darted inside, desperate to retreat to her room, to scrub away every trace of the night beneath a hot shower.   
  
But her hopes were dashed the moment she entered the villa. The living room overflowed with guests.   
  
Every pair of eyes locked onto her: tangled hair, mascara streaked down her cheeks, swollen eyes, her dress wrinkled and twisted, red marks scattered along her neck--a silent confession no one could miss.   
  
An icy hush fell. Then, with a theatrical sigh, her adopted sister Tessa Quinn broke the silence, lips curled in a smug little smile. ""Evelina, where have you been? We've all been worried sick. Cole nearly called the police looking for you.""  
  
Cole's expression darkened as his gaze lingered on the hi\*\*eys along Evelina's neck, his eyes turning icy. ""Where were you last night? What did you do?"" he demanded, his voice low and dangerous. Every head swiveled toward Evelina, the Quinn family included. They glared at her like she was something rotten dragged in from the street, their gazes brimming with contempt as they studied every shameful detail.   
  
A storm of humiliation, bewilderment, and dread crashed through Evelina. Her hands shook as she signed the same question over and over, desperate for an explanation from Cole. ""Why did you abandon me at the hotel?""  
  
Cole knew perfectly well what she was saying but feigned ignorance, choosing instead to weaponize his words and pin every accusation on Evelina, who was mute and cornered.   
  
""We're engaged, Evelina. And you vanished for an entire night--now you come back covered in someone else's marks. Have you ever once thought about how that makes me feel?"" His accusations lashed out with the practiced pain of a master manipulator, veins bulging in his forehead, every inch the picture of a wounded lover.   
  
Everyone felt sympathy for Cole, their eyes full of pity.   
  
""Look at what she's done to poor Cole--how could she betray him, despite all the love he's given her?""  
  
""What kind of upbringing did she have? No shame, no sense of decency. She's engaged to Cole, but she's out all night with another man. There's no way she could ever make a good wife.""  
  
The room buzzed with cruel whispers and barely contained contempt, accusations ricocheting through the crowd, some laced with biting insinuations.   
  
Stunned and lost, Evelina stood frozen amid the barrage of insults. The memories from last night were a haze of al\*\*hol and confusion, but she remembered, with absolute clarity, that Cole had personally escorted her to the presidential suite.   
  
Mute and defenseless, Evelina's frantic attempts to communicate were met with nothing but cold indifference.   
  
With desperate motions, she tried to explain, ""It's not like that at all. Let me make it clear!""  
  
Cole seized the moment, his voice slicing through the noise, more eager to wound than to listen. ""We just got engaged, and you vanished to spend the night with another man. Evelina, I never thought you could be so shameless.""  
  
The motion in Evelina's hands faltered, her arms falling limp as tears shimmered in her wide, wounded eyes.   
  
His tone icy, Cole pressed on. ""I won't marry someone who betrays me. This engagement is over. Let's end things here.""  
  
With panic rising, Evelina's gestures grew frantic. ""I didn't betray you. Did you set me up?""  
  
Grabbing the front of his shirt, she tried to force him to look at her--only to spot a fresh k\*\*s mark blooming on his neck. The realization barely registered before a brutal slap landed across her face.   
  
Her father, Albin Quinn, stood over her, hand trembling from the blow, his rage burning through every word. ""Shameless s\*\*t! Have you lost all decency? Where is your sense of honor?""  
  
  
**Chapter 2 Who Truly Belonged In This Family**  
""Albin!"" A gray-haired elder's voice cut through the room like a whip, his cane slamming against the floor with a resonant thud.   
  
Slowly pushing himself upright from the sofa, he fixed Albin with a piercing glare, his features carved in stone. ""By now, don't you think it's time you gave me an explanation?"" he demanded, his tone heavy with authority. ""I've long kept my distance from the private matters of the younger generation, but this--this is not something I can overlook. Our family has stood firmly behind you all these years. Without the financial lifeline extended by Dawson Group's bank, your family would've crumbled into bankruptcy long ago.""  
  
Albin's complexion went ashen with fury, but the weight of the situation forced him to lower his head in bitter submission. ""We'll always remember the Dawson family's generosity, but...""  
  
His eyes darted to Evelina, burning with silent blame. If looks could k\*\*l, she'd have vanished on the spot. She was the one who'd ruined everything.   
  
With no other option, he had to swallow the humiliation of being the one to end the engagement.   
  
But Gerald Dawson, Cole's grandfather, slammed down his decision before Albin could speak. ""The engagement will not be dissolved,"" he pronounced, his tone final--leaving no room for debate.   
  
Worried Gerald would coerce him for the family's benefit, Cole blurted out, ""Grandpa, I won't marry a woman who's betrayed me. She's mute and has sl\*\*t with someone else. How am I supposed to face anyone after this? Everyone will think I'm a joke.""  
  
At first, Cole had only agreed to the engagement because Evelina's beauty was unmatched in all of Uclard--no one could deny that.   
  
Still, every time he remembered her muteness, a wave of discomfort rose in his ch\*\*t. The idea of a wife who couldn't even g\*\*p his name in bed unsettled him in ways he hated to admit.   
  
What gnawed at him most was his obsession with Tessa, who was bold and free-spirited where Evelina was guarded and distant.   
  
Tessa was the girl he'd grown up with. That reckless night when he finally gave in to te\*\*tation and sl\*\*t with her had left them both reeling--Tessa had sobbed in his arms, insisting he take responsibility for what they'd done.   
  
Cole relented at her pleading and agreed to marry her.   
  
If marriage was inevitable, he'd rather settle for someone less striking but easier to control than Evelina, who always seemed impossible to please and kept everyone at arm's length.   
  
The night before, he'd orchestrated the whole fiasco himself, scheming for a way out of his engagement to Evelina.   
  
If only Tessa hadn't been keeping an eye on him, he would have spent a pa\*\*ionate night with Evelina himself and made it look like she'd betrayed him--instead of letting another man sl\*\*p with her.   
  
Now, he had no idea which lucky man had gotten her laid.   
  
His gaze slid shamelessly over Evelina, taking in the curve of her bare shoulder. His mind drifted, imagining her groaning and mo\*\*ing beneath another man, wishing he were that man.   
  
Catching the direction of his thoughts, Tessa's lips twisted, jealousy and resentment flashing in her eyes. Deep down, she vowed she'd see to it that Evelina's reputation was shattered for good.   
  
Suddenly, Tessa's honeyed tone pierced the tension, yanking everyone back to the present. ""Evelina, hurry up and apologize to Cole.""  
  
A deep shadow settled over Gerald's features. He finally spoke up. ""The engagement stands. The Quinn family, after all, has more than one daughter to offer.""  
  
Instantly, all eyes in the room drifted to Evelina and Tessa, who stood side by side.   
  
The defiance on Cole's face evaporated. He clamped his mouth shut, suddenly as docile as a scolded child who'd been handed a treat.   
  
A rosy flush crept up Tessa's cheeks, and she shrank behind her adoptive mother, Joanna Quinn. Her gentle, bashful act only heightened the guests' disdain for Evelina's supposed shameful behavior.   
  
Evelina, rooted in place, felt all color drain from her face. She watched helplessly as Cole's gaze lingered on Tessa, the two exchanging sly, knowing glances that spoke volumes.   
  
Low murmurs rippled among the guests.   
  
Years ago, the Quinn couple's world had shattered when their daughter vanished. Joanna's grief had nearly broken her, until the family adopted a girl from an orphanage--a gentle, timid child who quickly became the new center of their lives.   
  
That girl was none other than Tessa.   
  
After a decade, the police had shown up out of the blue, clutching a DNA report--a perfect match for the long-lost Quinn daughter.   
  
Whispers swept through the city, fueling speculation. Desperate to protect their reputation, the Quinn family publicly welcomed back their biological daughter, Evelina, a girl who had weathered years of hardship. They even declared both Evelina and Tessa part of the family, refusing to send Tessa away even after finding their lost child.   
  
Yet, Evelina's life in the past few years had been anything but charmed.   
  
At seventeen, she'd lost her adoptive mother in a devastating car crash, and the shock had stolen her voice--leaving her with a silent world she couldn't escape.   
  
In every way--her grace, beauty, and bearing--Evelina eclipsed Tessa, save for one cruel detail: she couldn't speak.   
  
A few years ago, when the Quinn family's business teetered on collapse, the Dawson family's bank swooped in with a lifesaving investment.   
  
Their help had resurrected the Quinn family's fortune.   
  
Business ties had pulled the Quinn and Dawson families closer, making a marriage alliance feel almost inevitable. The families' elders soon settled on the idea, seeing it as the best way to secure their mutual interests for years to come. At first, the plan was simple: Tessa, raised in the Quinn household, would marry Cole, her childhood companion.   
  
But stability mattered more than sentiment. The Dawson family insisted on Evelina instead.   
  
After all, she was the Quinn family's true daughter by bl\*\*d. That way, there could be no question of loyalty, no last-minute denial of the connection.   
  
With Evelina's reputation now in ruins, her chance to marry into the Dawson family vanished overnight. Yet family interests still took priority. Gerald reluctantly accepted Tessa as Cole's new bride, seeing no other way to keep the alliance intact.   
  
""Maybe we can talk about this another time. I'd rather not rush Tessa into marriage,"" Joanna burst out, breaking her silence as she tried to shield Tessa from the marriage plans.   
  
Evelina watched the scene unfold with a numb, frosty detachment. No one had bothered asking if she wanted this marriage. She'd only ever been a bargaining chip--nothing more than a pawn for the Quinn family to trade away for profit. If marriage was possible for her, why was Tessa any different?   
  
Her lips twisted in a bitter, mocking smile as she glanced around the room, searching for a single sympathetic face. None met her eyes. Even her own bl\*\*d family regarded her as a burden, treating Tessa as if she were the trueborn daughter.   
  
To those who didn't know any better, it seemed that Tessa belonged here, not her.   
  
Evelina's icy gaze lingered on Tessa. She remembered those first days after being brought home--the careful way everyone tiptoed around Tessa's feelings, the endless gifts, the gentle reassurances, the way the Quinn family poured all their warmth into a girl who wasn't even theirs by birth.   
  
In contrast, the Quinns had not shown even a trace of affection toward their biological daughter, Evelina.   
  
Tessa was bright and charming, a natural favorite, while Evelina's silence made her easy to overlook. Seventeen years old and thrust back into a house that never truly welcomed her, Evelina learned quickly that her parents had no love left for her since Tessa absorbed all of it.   
  
At the Quinn family estate, Evelina's bedroom was barely more than a broom closet tucked beside the maid's quarters, cramped and windowless, while Tessa's was a sprawling, sunlit suite fit for a storybook princess.   
  
Evelina's monthly allowance was a meager five hundred dollars--barely enough to cover necessities. Each day, she squeezed onto a crowded bus just to get to school.   
  
Meanwhile, Joanna fussed endlessly over Tessa's safety, insisting on a private driver and assigning a dedicated maid to serve up elaborate meals. If Tessa grew tired of home-cooked meals, she could simply call for a reservation at any luxury restaurant in the city. Her spending money? An unlimited credit card.   
  
While Evelina packed her bags for a crowded public boarding school, Tessa was chauffeured each day to Uclard's most elite academy.   
  
Evelina rotated through the handful of worn clothes she'd salvaged from her old life. Meanwhile, Tessa's closets overflowed with dazzling dresses and luxury handbags, every item carefully curated and never worn twice.   
  
When Tessa turned eighteen, the driveway sparkled with a cherry-red sports car topped with a velvet bow. Evelina's own eighteenth birthday slipped by in silence--no cake, no cards, not even a whispered acknowledgment.   
  
Their birthdays were only two days apart, but each year Evelina stood at the edge of Tessa's lavish celebration, watching from the shadows as the family gathered to shower Tessa with gifts and affection.   
  
No one ever seemed to notice when Evelina's day arrived, let alone mark it with a simple wish.   
  
The family worried constantly about Tessa, terrified she'd be sacrificed in some marriage alliance, but not once did anyone pause to wonder what Evelina wanted--her engagement to a total stranger decided without a whisper of concern for her.   
  
Sometimes, Evelina questioned who truly belonged in this family.   
  
She stood invisible in her own home. Ignored by her parents, betrayed by the man she was supposed to marry and her adoptive sister, she was left with nothing but silent humiliation.   
  
Her entire life felt like a twisted punchline to someone else's joke--her very existence a mistake no one wanted to acknowledge.   
  
  
**Chapter 3 Harold's Birthday Banquet**  
Evelina barely remembered how she'd left the Quinns' house that day, her mind shrouded in a fog she had no interest in clearing. She wanted nothing more to do with their lives, yet Tessa managed to shove her new reality in Evelina's face at every turn--never passing up a chance to parade her engagement for the world to see.   
  
Evelina found refuge in a cramped apartment near her office--forty square meters of solitude with bare white walls, a partitioned bathroom, and secondhand furniture that rattled when she brushed past. But it was hers alone, a fragile boundary the Quinn family couldn't cross.   
  
On a rainy evening, Tessa's barrage of Instagram updates finally pushed Evelina past her limit. She intended to block Tessa, but her finger slipped and opened the latest post instead.   
  
Tessa had outdone herself: a glossy photo of the Quinn family's sunlit living room, glittering with a rainbow of jewelry and a proud heap of property deeds fanned out across the coffee table.   
  
Her caption screamed across the screen: ""This is what my parents gave me: wedding gifts that arrived early, worth over ten million!""  
  
Scrolling through Tessa's feed felt like wading through a fever dream of luxury--sleek sports cars lined up like trophies, designer handbags scattered across tufted beds, rows of couture dresses and diamonds sparkling in the light. Even the family group chat screenshots stung: Albin, usually all sharp edges, joking and affectionate; Joanna, who had never spared Evelina a kind word, oozing warmth and doting on Tessa.   
  
To the world, they looked like the perfect family--close-knit, glamorous, and overflowing with love. Who wouldn't be jealous?   
  
A bitter, lopsided smile tugged at Evelina's lips. The family chat group consisted of only three members--she hadn't even been added.   
  
The last time Albin and Joanna messaged her, it was to strong-arm her into that arranged marriage, all while feigning concern as they discussed wedding gifts.   
  
""We'll keep the wedding gifts here for you,"" they had insisted. ""Otherwise, the Dawson family will just take everything once you move in. But don't worry, we ordered some lovely silk blankets just for you.""  
  
Looking back, she almost laughed at how na√Øve she'd been to feel even a flicker of gratitude.   
  
For Tessa--who wasn't even related by bl\*\*d--they handed out houses and flashy cars, filling the mansion with glittering jewelry and luxury gifts, terrified their precious girl might suffer after marrying into the Dawson family. For Evelina, though, their only worry was whether she had enough blankets.   
  
With a single decisive tap, Evelina blocked her parents and Tessa. Her reputation was already in ruins; they probably wished she would vanish for good, sparing them further embarrassment.   
  
She took a steadying breath, smoothing down her nerves for the workday ahead. Pulling on a high-necked undershirt beneath her uniform, she hid the fresh marks that mottled her skin--especially the dark, unmistakable hi\*\*eys scattered along her neck.   
  
Evelina held a key position at Rise Bank, one of the country's top private banks with branches scattered across every major city skyline.   
  
She specialized in credit operations--scrutinizing and approving every loan application before landing in the hands of the department director, Jordy Bailey. The department couldn't process a single case without her sign-off.   
  
Yet, Evelina's aphasia complicated daily life. She couldn't use sign language during client meetings; no one else in the room would understand her.   
  
Still, her impressive r√©sum√©--dual degrees in finance and business management--had prompted Rise Bank to bend their usual rules to bring her on board.   
  
Of course, her entry into the bank hadn't relied solely on credentials. Her schoolmate, Jordy, had put in a good word for her at just the right moment.   
  
One afternoon, Jordy swept into her office with his trademark easy charm, placing a thick folder on her desk. ""Wright Group's credit documents--dig in as soon as you can. Leadership wants us to nail down a relationship with them. Their annual cash flow hits the billions. If we lock in this partnership, year-end bonuses will skyrocket.""  
  
His gentle manner and bright smile made him a favorite among the younger women in the office, though he seemed oblivious to his own popularity.   
  
Evelina inclined her head in silent agreement, her practiced composure betraying no hint of nerves. She had managed credit cases so often that the process felt as natural as breathing.   
  
Jordy leaned in, his tone casual but eyes intent. ""I'll be out of town on the third--flying to Otresh for meetings. You'll need to go in my place to Harold Wright's birthday banquet.""  
  
With that, he slid an ornate, crimson invitation across the desk.   
  
A flicker of confusion crossed Evelina's face as she glanced at the invitation.   
  
""I've already arranged for your dress,"" Jordy continued, offering a reassuring smile as he reached over to ruffle her hair--a gesture that lingered a second too long. ""All you need to do is deliver the gift I picked out and show your face at the banquet.""  
  
That brief, affectionate touch unsettled her, but Evelina chose not to dwell on it. She quickly lifted her hands, signing her question, her brows knitted with concern. ""Me?""  
  
Catching the hesitation in her eyes, Jordy's expression softened with genuine concern. ""All you have to do is show up, use my invitation, and hand over the gift. You don't need to mingle with anyone,"" he said, his voice low and reassuring.   
  
A knot of anxiety tightened in Evelina's ch\*\*t. She dreaded the thought of stumbling or making a scene--anything that might embarrass Jordy or jeopardize his trust in her.   
  
Sensing her unease, Jordy leaned in, his tone gentle but insistent. ""Landing this Wright Group deal is crucial for us. My dad pulled some strings to get this invitation--it wasn't easy. Please, Evelina, just this once.""  
  
He had opened countless doors for her over the years. She owed him more than she could ever repay, and this--walking into a banquet with the city's elite--was a small price compared to all he'd done. Plenty of people would die for a chance to mingle with the Wright family; she'd be a fool to turn it down.   
  
Evelina drew a steady breath, steadied her nerves, and signed her agreement, a grateful smile lighting up her face. ""Alright, I'll go.""  
  
A month slipped by, and the Wrights' house erupted with activity--valets darted between a parade of high-end cars stacked along the roadside.   
  
Evelina exited her taxi at the curb, cradling an ornate wooden gift box against her side. Rather than mingle with the fleet of luxury vehicles, she slipped quietly down the sidewalk, preferring to approach on foot and escape notice.   
  
Even so, her graceful figure and composed presence drew more than a few sidelong stares through the crowd.   
  
As the line of high-end cars came to a standstill, heads in designer interiors swiveled to follow her.   
  
The apricot dress Jordy had chosen hugged her silhouette with subtle, sculpted lines, the neckline and slim waist artfully showcased by intricate tailoring. She wore her hair in a simple, low ponytail, no jewelry gleaming at her throat or ears--yet something about her air made her impossible to overlook.   
  
An attendant, waiting by the door, ushered her briskly inside.   
  
Just as she crossed the threshold, a jet-black Bentley glided to a halt at the front of the drive, calmly claiming the best spot as the waiting crowd parted in quiet recognition.   
  
Reclining in the backseat, Andreas lounged in a perfectly fitted suit, his long legs casually crossed. His expression betrayed nothing but boredom as he glanced out at the commotion beyond the tinted window.   
  
Without moving, he flicked his gaze toward the butler standing beside his car. ""So Grandma's finally back from her spiritual retreat?""  
  
The butler, ever composed, replied, ""Your grandmother notified us two months ago. She wanted you to start immersing yourself in the company's business. Her plan was to return right before your grandfather's birthday--just in time for the family reunion.""  
  
Without waiting for the rest of the line to move, the butler opened Andreas's door with practiced efficiency, ignoring the annoyed drivers in the luxury cars behind them, all desperate to attend Harold's eightieth birthday banquet. For Andreas, though, this was just a reluctant homecoming.   
  
After five years away, the Wrights' house felt both familiar and alien. Staff hustled through the courtyard, assembling a lavish dessert display while elegant guests mingled beside the music-flecked fountain. Andreas strode inside, his composure unshakable, his presence commanding attention without a word.   
  
He cut a striking figure in his immaculate suit, angular jaw and cold, mesmerizing eyes drawing lingering glances from everyone he passed--yet his demeanor remained distant, untouched by the celebration swirling around him.   
  
His striking good looks drew a flurry of furtive glances from the city's privileged young ladies, yet none dared approach--his presence radiated an icy confidence that kept everyone at bay.   
  
Evelina, uncomfortable amidst the chatter and bright lights, quietly handed the gift for Harold to the attendant and slipped away to the edge of the crowd. She pressed a hand to her temple, a wave of nausea rising as the sweet scent of desserts mingled with the sharp tang of champagne.   
  
Her stomach had been unsettled for days, each bout of nausea arriving without warning.   
  
A familiar voice suddenly cut through the noise. ""Evelina--what brings you here?""  
  
Tessa swept in, somehow armed with an invitation, peacocking through the crowd in a dazzling dress. Every gesture was staged for effect--the way she swirled her w\*\*e, the tilt of her chin, the flash of the diamond ring on her right hand.   
  
The same ring, Evelina realized, that the Dawson family had chosen for her own engagement party--now glinting shamelessly on Tessa's finger, barely two months later.   
  
Evelina's patience frayed. She had no desire for drama and moved to slip away, but Tessa, with a practiced turn, blocked her path, refusing to let her escape so easily.   
  
Tessa's voice dripped with mockery. ""Evelina, everyone's talking about your little scandal. If I were you, I'd have the decency to stay home instead of further tarnishing our family's name.""  
  
Evelina barely spared Tessa a glance, the corners of her eyes cold and sharp with quiet disdain. She watched Tessa's theatrics, easily reading the script--provoke her, stir up a scene, then pin the fallout on her for the whole Wright family to see.   
  
She refused to play into such an obvious ploy. With an icy composure, Evelina turned to leave, ignoring Tessa entirely.   
  
But just as she took a step, someone's foot pinned her elaborate gown. The heavy skirt snagged, and Evelina pitched forward, unable to catch herself.   
  
Glass crashed spectacularly against the manicured lawn as an entire pyramid of champagne flutes toppled with her, the shattering echo cutting through the party and snapping every head in her direction.   
  
  
**Chapter 4 Are You Pregnant**  
Shattered champagne flutes and toppled dessert trays littered the grass, the once-perfect refreshment station now a chaotic wreck. Guests clustered in the courtyard, murmuring and craning their necks to witness the spectacle.   
  
Lounging on the chair, Andreas barely listened to his grandmother, Ruby Wright, as she pressed him--yet again--to settle down. His attention drifted, distracted, until a surge of noise outside drew him from his reverie. With an air of idle amusement, he tipped his head to one side, narrowing his eyes as he sized up anyone bold enough to challenge the Wright family gathering.   
  
For Andreas, petty power plays were standard fare among the privileged. He assumed this was just another desperate bid for attention and felt no urge to get involved. Instead, he stretched, then rose from his seat, determined to escape upstairs from his grandmother's nagging.   
  
The Quinn family's drama was an open book to everyone present. Their tangled household--one biological daughter, one adopted--was notorious for its constant friction.   
  
Rumors had swirled since the engagement fiasco--Evelina, the Quinn family's legitimate daughter, had supposedly been caught cheating on the very day of her engagement. The Dawson family was furious. To prevent their carefully arranged marriage alliance from falling apart, the Quinns' adopted daughter Tessa took Evelina's place to get engaged with Cole.   
  
Now, the courtyard was a stage for fresh humiliation. Evelina sprawled across the grass, her dress soaked with champagne, a glaring stain blooming across the delicate neckline. Dozens of guests hovered nearby, their faces alight with anticipation, as whispers rippled through the crowd.   
  
Erick Watson, a friend of Andreas, spoke up as he spotted Evelina on the ground through the floor-to-ceiling window, her hands flashing in frantic signs. ""Hey, is she mute?""  
  
The question snapped Andreas out of his apathy. He turned from the staircase, gaze sharp as he peered through the window. When he recognized Evelina, a storm of emotion swept over him--his jaw tightened, bl\*\*d icing over as his hands curled at his sides.   
  
Oblivious, Erick continued with a mocking snicker, ""Did she get shoved by that woman next to her? Talk about misery--she can't even yell for help.""  
  
Although Erick hadn't meant any harm, his careless words yanked Andreas straight back to that morning after their pa\*\*ionate night.   
  
Evelina had been seething with unspoken grievances, her hands flying as she tried again and again to pour her heart out in sign language.   
  
Now, wincing through the sharp throb in her ankle, she forced herself upright and stared at Tessa. ""Did you deliberately step on my dress to make me fall?""  
  
""Let go of me!"" Tessa hissed, wriggling to break free, her eyes burning with spite.   
  
This time, Evelina refused to play along. With her grip tightening on Tessa's wrist, the last shred of politeness shattered, her expression stone-cold as she held her ground.   
  
Although Harold had officially retired, his authority still loomed over the city, untouched by age or absence. The Wright family remained the pinnacle of Uclard's elite--an old-money dynasty with tendrils in every corridor of power.   
  
Andreas' father, Millard Wright, had transformed Wright Group into Uclard's financial juggernaut. Their empire spanned everything from gleaming high-rises and tech startups to private hospitals and luxury hotels, making the Wright family untouchable and their coffers bottomless.   
  
Despite years of being spoiled by the Quinn family, Tessa had never experienced a grand party like this one. Underneath her polished fa√ßade, she nursed a deep-rooted insecurity--something that even their constant indulgence couldn't cure.   
  
Terrified of losing her place, Tessa had clawed her way to the Quinn family's affection, manipulating every advantage she could. She'd gone so far as to seduce Cole, desperate to keep Evelina from taking the spotlight.   
  
Tessa always felt Evelina's shadow looming behind her, threatening to unravel everything she possessed. That was why she seized every opportunity to sabotage Evelina, hoping the woman would be despised and abandoned by her own family.   
  
Whenever petty quarrels broke out, the Quinn family inevitably excused Tessa's cruelty toward Evelina. Still, she understood Albin better than anyone--he was calculating and ruthless, and if her antics ever threatened the family's standing, he'd cut her loose in a heartbeat.   
  
Offending the Wright family was a risk the Quinn family couldn't take. ",1,1756239146.0,NovelNexus,2,1.0,False
