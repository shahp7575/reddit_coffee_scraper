Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.


I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

1kjznaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tipstor/comments/1kjznaq/travel_like_a_millionaire_spend_like_a_minimalist/,"""Travel Like A Millionaire, Spend Like A Minimalist""","Traveling on a tight budget doesn’t mean suffering through hostel bunk beds with questionable stains or eating instant noodles from a dented pot in a shared kitchen with a guy named Lars who hasn’t showered since the last solstice. There’s a way to do this without selling off your dignity. It takes cunning. It takes curiosity. And above all, it takes respect for yourself, your destination, and the strange, glorious chaos in between.

Comfort isn’t always about king-sized beds and artisanal soap. Sometimes it’s knowing the shower won’t freeze you. Sometimes it’s a meal so good it makes you forget your shoes are held together with duct tape. The trick is knowing where to spend and where to save. How to spot the parts of a trip that feed the soul and strip away the need for luxury fluff.

Start with airfare. There are entire religions built around finding cheap international flights. Worship at their altar. Get flexible. Stop demanding nonstop flights. Mid-week departures, red-eye connections, off-season windows — these are the gospel. Use local budget carriers once you’re in-region. They’ll treat you like cattle, sure, but you’ll still land with most of your money intact and enough leftover to buy real food.

Accommodation doesn’t have to mean sterile hotels or backpacker zoos. Think guesthouses. Think family-run inns that smell like someone’s grandma just made soup. Think neighborhoods where laundry flaps in the breeze and coffee is served in chipped mugs on plastic tables. You want character, not concierge service. Privacy and peace can be found in an Airbnb above a fish market or a countryside ryokan run by someone’s sweet but nosy aunt. Find a place where the mattress won’t rupture a disc, the door locks, and the noise outside is life.

Eat like you belong there. Not like a tourist holding a laminated map and a craving for something “safe.” Street food isn’t risky, it’s poetry. The best meals you’ll ever have won’t come with cloth napkins. They’ll come wrapped in banana leaves or balanced on metal trays, eaten on stools far too small for your thighs. Ask locals where they eat. Not where they think you want to eat. Learn how to say “delicious” in the local language and mean it.

Public transportation is your gritty, glorious friend. Subways, rickshaws, tuk-tuks, and dollar vans . They all get you where you need to go. And along the way, they show you what it’s really like to live there. You don’t need to rent a car unless you’re planning to drive off into some poetic, godforsaken mountain pass. And even then, reconsider. Gas is expensive. And potholes are everywhere.

Find the free stuff. Museums have hours where admission is waived. Temples, markets, festivals, open-air dance-offs, and parks with old men doing tai chi. This is the theater of real life and the tickets don’t cost a thing. Wander aimlessly. Get lost. Get un-lost. That’s the point. That’s how you find the best bar in town, the perfect slice of roasted meat from a nameless stall, and the old man who invites you into a game of chess you’ll never win but will always remember.

Splurge wisely. Spend on experiences that burn into memory. A day trip to a remote island. A single, unforgettable meal prepared by someone whose hands have cooked that dish since they were eight. A train ride through the countryside with views that make your eyes sting. That’s where the money should go. Not on robes you’ll never wear or cocktails with umbrellas in them.

Travel isn’t a checklist. It’s not a photo op. It’s the art of sitting in discomfort long enough to find beauty in it. You don’t need a luxury resort to feel alive. You need people. Stories. Scents. Chaos. And the willingness to accept that comfort, real comfort, doesn’t always come with a mini-bar and turn-down service. Sometimes it’s a breeze blowing through a rice field. Sometimes, it’s the quiet hum of a bus full of strangers, the smell of grilled something wafting through the window, and the feeling that you’re exactly where you’re supposed to be.

You don’t have to be rich to travel well. You just have to care about where you’re going. About how you move through it. About who you meet along the way. Comfort isn’t a luxury. It’s a mindset. And when you figure that out, the world opens up wide, wild, and surprisingly affordable.

It was my first real relationship, and walking away was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. I left because I knew things weren’t right—but now I can’t stop wondering if I made a mistake.

About a year in, I tested negative for STIs at a routine checkup—then a few months later, I developed strange symptoms and tested positive for chlamydia. He claimed he had been tested before our relationship but couldn’t provide proof. He never admitted to cheating, and there were zero obvious signs. The whole situation made me question my sanity.

While we were together, he did a lot of nice things—sent flowers to my job, filled up my gas tank, showed up when I needed help—but whenever I expressed how I felt, he’d throw those gestures in my face. Like I wasn’t allowed to be upset because he had “done so much for me.” He’d say things like, “You’d be making a mistake if you left me,” or, “I’m a catch—you’ll regret this.”

Then there was his ex. He told me she had cancer when they were together, so I felt like I couldn’t question their continued contact. But later on, I went through his phone and found out they had met up for coffee behind my back. When I reached out to her, she had no idea I even existed. After our breakup, I saw that he unfollowed and refollowed her, started liking her posts again, and I remembered that his mom once told me his ex regretted leaving him. I had already seen texts between them, so none of it surprised me—but it still hurt deeply.

I tried to break up with him multiple times, but he would always talk me out of it. The last time, I finally ended things over text—and I never heard from him again. He likely reconnected with his ex, and that is breaking my heart. 

If you’ve ever walked away from someone who hurt you but still felt broken—how did you get through it? I feel so much regret, like maybe I should’ve stayed, even though I know he wasn’t good for me. It’s like I’m stuck and I’m scared I’ll never find someone better. How do you stop blaming yourself and let go of someone who made you question everything?

TL;DR: I broke up with my boyfriend after two years. He likely cheated, emotionally manipulated me, and secretly met up with his ex. I still feel broken and can’t stop wondering if I made a mistake. How do you move on when they leave without looking back?",1,1746965228.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

But he never pushed me away.”,"Darveth never was a kind city. It was a city that forgot its dead by morning but remembered every unpaid debt like a prayer. A city of old bones. The gods had long abandoned Darveth, but magic hadn't. Not entirely. Not where Tavian walked.

The alleys stank of iron, ash, and stale wine and stones remembered more rain than blood. It was the kind of place where secrets were currency and silence was an armor. Tavian never cried as a babe, just looked at you, the kind of look that made grown men clear their throats and women cross the street. The city didn’t raise him so much as test him, over and over, until he stopped flinching at the taste of blood. Tavian soaked it up before his voice had broken. No coin. No title. No future. Just a boy with sharp eyes and a too still face for a child.

And then there was she. She had no right to be there. High house daughter, heir to an ancient blood line, all velvet and dresses. A girl who slipped past guards to touch something real and got him instead. He didn't say much. She never quit talking. She'd sit on broken stairs beside him and tell him strange things about her dreams, deaths that hadn’t happened yet.

""You never laugh,"" she once told him. ""You talk too much,"" he replied. But he never pushed her away. And she never stopped coming, until she was walled off by court, her talent called divine, her life written and decided for her before she could say a word.

He wasn't given that kind of story. He was given war. The kingdom started to shatter like a glass. Four old allies raised banners and came for the crown. Tavian was swept up in the army when he was fifteen, not that he wanted to fight, but that boys without names don't get a choice. When he was seventeen, he was a killer. When he was twenty, a commander. When he was twenty five, Marshal Tavian of Darveth, youngest in the kingdom's history, and a walking legend among commoners.

They had nicknamed him the Blade of the Kingdom. If the king needed something done without noise, it was Tavian they summoned. He didn’t climb ranks through charm or speeches. He rose because when missions failed, he returned alone, boots soaked in blood, eyes colder than steel. He carried blood magic in him - old, unspoken, feral. The nobles hated him, he was lowborn, unreadable. But his silence made them sweat and soldiers bow down. The Church called him touched. Commoners whispered blessings to him as though he was a saint. He was not. He did not have faith in gods. He had faith in weight, action, precision. A knife doesn't need faith only a target. He never attended court balls. He never courted. He avoided the palace as if it was rotten. But politics had claws, and yet he was always pulled back in, a sword having to sit with quills.

And her? Her prophecies came true, one after another, until even the Crown shuddered at them. Everybody wanted her sight, nobody wanted her. The nobles gazed at her usefulness, then whispered ""madness"" behind ther back. She was around courtiers yet utterly alone. Except… she dreamed of a boy who never smiled. Who listened. Who did not avert his gaze when she told him of the impossible.

She never forgot him. He had lost her face and name.

Decade passed. Wars took new shapes. The kingdom held on barely. Their paths cross once more, in a city that recalls both of them, though neither is quite the same. She dreams of him: taller, colder, exhausted. A man forged by war, wounded in ways no magic can heal. 

Kingdoms exist on knife's edges. There are those who have magic debts to repay, monsters made kings, and lies older than each of them rising to the surface. And at the centre of it all are two children who once found some kind of peace in each other, now are standing before a storm that neither of them asked for.

I'm a 20 something European writer, neck-deep in law school these days, which means most of my conscious existence is spent reviewing court cases, haunting coffee machines, and wondering why on earth Latin is still around. Instead of studying torts or constitutional theory like a sane student, however, I spend far too much time writing emotionally devastating character arcs. Equilibrium. When I'm not being smushed under academic workload or scheming to escape to be a traveling bard, I'm writing. Writing, always. I'm a advanced literate/novella style roleplayer, and what that means is that I don't so much one-liners. Fore me roleplaying is a storytelling, descriptive proses, deep world-building, and characters you can actually sink your teeth into. 

I live for:

Morally complex characters who do terrible things for painfully relatable reasons. Slow burn romances so charged you could power a small city off the unresolved tension alone. Gritty fantasy worlds full of curses, secret histories, blood offerings, forgotten gods, and not a whiff of modern slang to be found. Emotional tension, gut wrenching betrayals, characters who say ""I'm fine"" when they're so clearly not fine, and moments of silence that are more revealing than any amount of dialogue ever could be. Sword combat, politics, ancient prophecies, supernatural horror, and very badly flawed people trying to survive in a world that never so much as promised to be just.

My characters? They brood. They screw up. They do melodramatic things like stand and gaze at the rain for too long. They're not sunshine babies, they're emotionally constipated stormclouds who every now and again fall in love by accident.

I'm usually fairly laid back OOC, like to chat about plot, make memes regarding our characters' trauma, and toss Pinterest boards at you at 2am.

So here's the deal

You're 20+, pleas! Both for the sake of maturity, and so I can make jokes about back pain and questionable life choices without sounding like a cryptkeeper. You write literate to novella level. Depth of character? Yes. Emotional scarring? Oh, absolutely. Metaphors as pretty as a punch to the stomach? Yup. You're good at writing dark fantasy, the kind with morally challenged protagonists, muddied loyalties, battle-scarred realms, cults, hexes, mysterious artifacts which are absolutely too volatile to handle. We're building here, not parachuting down into a set. It's gritty, demonic, filled with shady bargains. You're a fan of slow burn. The one where they bicker, save each other, accidentally touch hands, then glare at each other. Enemies-to-lovers? Stranger-turned-childhood-friends-to-lost-strangers-to-what-are-we? Soulmates-who-can't-trust-each-other-but-keep-rescuing-each-other-anyway? You're willing to co-create on world-building and side characters. That means detailing noble houses, tavern masters, rogue mages. You enjoy tossing ideas around, creating as you go, and muttering ""okay but what if—"" over and over again. You're in it for the long haul. You're a writer who creates playlists, pinboards on Pinterest, and sends the occasional ""I can't stop thinking about our characters"" message..I want our characters to grow, break, rebuild, and maybe kiss amidst the rubble.

If any of this made you laugh, nod violently, or stare off into the distance thinking about your 2016 tragic OC, we are already best friends.",2,1746964515.0,AdvLiterateRP,0,1.0,False
1kjzacg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kjzacg/could_the_wacaco_minipresso_gr2_espresso_machine/,Could the WACACO Minipresso GR2 Espresso Machine Review Change Your Travel Coffee Game?,"Testing out the WACACO Minipresso GR2 Espresso Machine has been an interesting journey for someone like me who refuses to sacrifice a rich espresso, even while outdoors. With its compact and lightweight design, I found myself intrigued by the practicality of manually whipping up a cup of espresso during my camping trips and road adventures. Plus, the eco-friendly materials in the build were an added bonus for a sustainability supporter like me.

**Compact Build and Portability**  
One of the highlights for me was how compact and travel-friendly this device is. Measuring just 12.5 cm in length and weighing 285g, it became the perfect companion for outdoor activities. I remember tossing it into my backpack without worrying about space, as its ultra-small size fits pretty much anywhere. The carrying pouch included in the package sealed the deal for portability—it felt like this machine was designed with the adventurer in mind.  

[Ready to buy WACACO Minipresso GR2? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0d52xswkb/)

**Ease of Use and Manual Operation**  
This manual espresso maker required a bit of an adjustment, as I was used to automatic models. You add hot water into the built-in 80ml water tank, unlock the piston, and pump a few strokes to get the 18-bar pressure going. Each stroke gave a real sense of involvement, and the process made morning coffee feel like a mini ceremony. However, there was a learning curve to achieve consistent crema; I had to tweak my stroke rhythm a bit initially. Once you get the hang of it, the results are quite satisfying for a manual model.

**Eco-Friendly Design**  
Another feature I appreciated about this espresso maker was how its build incorporated wheat-composed polymers, making it partially eco-friendly. Around 20% of its outer shell material is composed of biomass, which aligns with my effort to reduce carbon footprint on-the-go. It’s nice to see such considerations in compact gear like this.

**Good Points**  
- Extremely portable and lightweight, ideal for travel.  
- Produces up to 18 bars of pressure for proper espresso extraction.  
- Eco-friendly materials promote sustainability.  
- Built-in accessories like the drip tray, cup, and brush add convenience.

**Adjustable Basket For Flexibility**  
What excited me even more was the adjustable filter basket, which can accommodate between 8g and 12g of coffee. This kind of customization allowed me to alter the strength of my espresso, adapting it to my mood or preference of the day. Whether I used pre-ground coffee or freshly ground beans, the results were delicious—though I strongly recommend grinding fresh for the full experience. With certain outdoor setups, this flexibility was a real life-saver.

**Drawbacks**  
- Manual operation isn’t as easy for beginners, requiring some practice.  
- Some users might find the plastic build less premium and slightly flimsy.  
- Produces warm coffee, but not always piping hot unless you preheat parts like the espresso cup.  

**Competitive Options**  
I couldn’t resist comparing this to other portable coffee makers like the Picopresso and Nanopresso. While the Picopresso felt sturdier and delivered marginally superior espresso quality, it’s also bulkier and comes at a steeper price. The Nanopresso, on the other hand, offered similar functionality but didn’t have the eco-friendly edge that this machine proudly flaunts. That said, I would say the Minipresso GR2 hits the sweet spot for casual users seeking affordability and eco-consideration.

**Affordable Quality**  
Looking at how it performs relative to its price point, I’d say it delivers excellent value. Unlike full-fledged espresso machines that cost considerably more and consume electricity, this compact espresso maker relies solely on manual input. For an outdoor espresso enthusiast like me trying to strike a balance between affordability and quality, this turned out to be a smart investment.

1kjz8gy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kjz8gy,Bleaklow Bliss,"So I took a last minute decision to get a night out in the peaks, and I had a spot in mind I had hiked last past year, tucked away from the paths on a lesser visited ridge. Turned out to be fantastic, weather was spot-on, completely remote, silent. Wind was just enough to keep air flow through the tent but not enough to flap. I slept soundly and woke up with the sunshine and a warm breeze, and a lovely chocolate porridge and coffee. 

As I sat there in the morning coffee in hand with the sun rays warming my back, I thought how it is way too easy to let a weekend drift past meaninglessly - do a few chores, sit in front of a screen and worry about work.

1kjz83p,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalitydisorders/comments/1kjz83p/accepting_and_coming_to_terms_with_the_fact_i_may/,Accepting and coming to terms with the fact I may have aspd,"The last few years I have been suspecting I may have ASPD. A few years back I met someone with that told me that they had ASPD and I didn’t think much of it when he said that, because yes I had heard the term sociopath and psychopath but it seems to be a little over used in a context that it might not apply to, and I didn’t really understand what it truly meant either. We ended up hanging out and talking quite a bit, just watching TV and stuff like that because he was one of my roommates. He ended up telling me about his life and stuff and his anti social tendencies and things he hd experienced and what it really meant to be sociopath. I saw a glimpse of things that he was involved in and it always seemed like he was getting into some kind of trouble. When I really thought about the stuff he was saying, I was like yea that seems like stuff that would maybe describe what a sociopath is, but the weird thing was I could weirdly relate to him and the things he was saying and doing. When I was growing up I had a quite a few negative experiences that somewhat shaped my life, my parents didn’t really spend anytime with me when I was a small child and I mostly stayed with grandparents on a farm type property. My dad got a job in another state so I went to live with my parents. I don’t remember much about those times but I remember I was always weirdly attached to my grandparents and not my parents. We lived in sort of a small house and in a sort of rural neighborhood outside of a city. I remember having one friend, a girl that I thought was pretty and she lived down the street from us and I just remember really really liking spending time with her but not realizing it was because she consistently tried to spend time with me. I don’t really remember liking much about my life other than maybe occasionally watching cartoons or playing PlayStation. My dad was hardly around because he was at work and many weeks he wasn’t there at all because he was out of town. Me and my mom spent a lot of time together I guess and I guess she never seemed happy. Sometimes she would threaten to kill me or tell me I’m worthless or yell at me. One time I was alone in the kitchen and she was in her room watching tv or something, I wanted to drink a glass of milk so I grabbed what I thought was a jug of milk only for it to turn out to be bleach and I drank some of it, it made me really sick I think. In school it seemed like I had trouble making friends and stuff but I had some friends I guess. At some point in time my dad had gotten more money from his job so we moved to a different neighborhood. I remember the last day that I lived in the first neighborhood, talking to that girl I liked and realizing I’d probably never see her again, a boy who I didn’t really care for too much rode off with her on their bicycles and that was that. The new neighborhood that we moved into, it seemed like a lot of the families were very very disfunctional and many of their kids were absolutely horrible, they were constantly doing horrible things to each other, fighting, acting crazy, stuff like that. I went over to one of the kids houses and there were these two kids playing with a dead animal. I remember at this time I felt very angry with other kids in the neighborhood and annoyed. I remember my mom kept getting into it with one of the neighbors down the street and would often villainize them and talk about how horrible they were, I can’t say whether they were or not. They had a daughter who was maybe a little bit older than me and  I believe my parents told me not to talk to anyone from that family but i can’t remember. One day we were both riding the bus and she started talking to me at some point, and we talked a little on the walk to our houses, I remember really liking her but I knew I wasn’t allowed to talk to her. Around this time it was more apparent that my parents marriage was failing so I kind of knew what to expect. They used to scream at each other every night and stuff like that so they got divorced shortly after that. I remember having lots of nightmares and hallucinations like my toys were coming to life and my parents were trying to kill me. We moved back to the state where my parents grew up and I stayed mostly with my mom but saw my dad occasionally. When I was with my mom i was uncomfortable and she’d often times yell and scream at me about stuff I didn’t really understand maybe. One time when I was my dad he grabbed my hand and basically like broke it or something. In middle school I got bullied a little bit and I started lashing out at certain people in my classes and I started to be a little rude to girls and stuff if I didn’t like them. I started to make friends with some of the kids in my class that, at the time, I didn’t really realize they had fucked up home lives. Sometimes my mom would go up to the school to yell at the faculty. I remember in like 7th or 8th grade I started playing some video games and listening to some music as an escape and it felt somewhat good, and it still feels kind of good to think about that stuff and at some point I took at trip to see my cousin and that was pretty fun.   At some point around this time, I started watching porn, and it I was exposed to maybe a little bit more than I should’ve been, and sort of started to see women in a certain way and started to see male and female relationships in a certain way. At one point before highschool, I got sexually assaulted but I didn’t wanna really acknowledge this, I didn’t get molested or raped or anything like that but I was sexually assaulted by another male. During high school I felt pretty alone, I would go through phases of having different friend groups or feeling different ways but as it went on, I started to become more aggressive towards females, people of authority, my parents, others in general. I remember there was a girl I thought was pretty and I felt like I couldn’t have her, we had some sort of interacting during class and I told her I was going to kill her with a gun because I didn’t really understand the fact that what I was saying was either hurting her or that it meant really anything to her at all, i believe she cried. I went to church one day and I saw her there and I tried to talk to her but she started crying and ran off. I started to get into more trouble in school and I had experimented with drugs and stuff like that. At some point I got detention and I met a guy that ended up becoming one of the only people I really hung out with outside of school, I had a friend group at the time but I preferred to hang out with him, he sold drugs a little bit, he was angry like I was, and we both liked to do drugs, watch tv, skateboard and smoke cigarettes. I realized within a few interactions with him that I had met him before, he was in elementary school at the time I was in middle school and one of my friends used to bully him. There was a girl that I was really attracted to and her friend came up to me one day and started telling me to ask her out because she liked me, we had similar interests and stuff and thought she was really pretty so I wanted her to be my gf. At the time I looked kinda weird maybe and I wasn’t really too comfortable with myself and most of the experiences I had with expressing an interest in girls, I felt like I got rejected or made fun of so I didn’t view that as an option, instead I sought to make her feel bad about herself and try to make her feel embarrassed. I can’t say if she liked me or not or if she felt any way about me or the things I was doing, I maybe just wish I would’ve played it a little bit cooler. She saw me in the hallway with another girl and said she was jealous but I thought she was trying to manipulate me. I ended up getting in trouble for a lot of really dumb stuff in highschool. My mom kicked me out of the house at some point because she found drugs on me. I spent a lot of time sleeping in class because I didn’t really care and I think teachers and faculty started to notice that so they started making me see the counselors and stuff. I remember being attracted to one of the counselors there and feeling like I liked her because I wasn’t used to feeling like people cared. After highschool I got into a car crash. I moved back into my dad house and all I did was take drugs and get into fights with my family. Most of my family are narcissistic and I got into a fight with my cousin and I threatened my dad and him with weapons so he kicked me out of the house. I spent most of my time alone after that and didn’t really do much. I moved to California about a year later. I loved it and it seemed like there were alot of people that got me there. I ended up doing a lot of weird  socially unacceptable shit because I wasn’t used to just being normal and shit, I think I got slipped pcp or something while I was there. Idk. But I got into a physical fight with my roommate and my landlord and I went to jail for the night. I ended upup staying in a few halfway houses and i had some genuinely pretty good times but I kept slightly screwing over my roommates and friends and getting into fights with people that were trying to help me and do good things for me. I still have trouble trusting people. I lived in a really good situation for a while but I was still actively being a bad person at times and not thinking about what stuff was positive or negative or hurtful to myself or others. I ended up on the streets of Los Angeles for a few days, just drifting around and stuff and ended up moving back in with the people I was living with before, they basically gave me a second chance. I remember just sitting in my room drinking and occasionally going outside to smoke a little weed or something with my friends but one day one of my roommates did something that I perceived as wronging me, but conceptually wasn’t THAT bad comparatively. I ended up flipping the fuck out and saying a bunch of racist shit and breaking a bunch of stuff in my room. They still were nice to me I guess. The guy just said asked me why. I basically just blamed it on someone else. A girl moved in with us and I was in her room with her smoking weed and talking to her a little bit, one of the guys in the house came up to me and started screaming at me and getting in my face, I walked off and made some coffee for myself, he grabbed the cup out of my hand and threw it in the sink so I started laying into him, his girlfriend jumped on me and I threw her off of me and someone called the cops. They sent me to the psycho ward and I moved into another halfway house, didn’t like it, kept doing drugs, despite the manager telling me to knock it off, so they kicked me out. I moved into another one but they kicked me out for the same reason so I just sat in a hotel room with one of my friends and her friends, doing drugs.  I moved back home and things started to go down hill. I became even more anti social, I withdrew from normal relationships because I thought everyone was out to get me and looked for people that wanted to abuse or hurt me so that I could find a reason to manipulate them and hurt them and I definitely found what I was looking for. I started commiting more crimes and stuff. I worked a few different jobs and I would steal from my employers and lie and I usually did a good job but didn’t really care overall. I during the winter time I started to work two different jobs, neither one paid me very well but I made enough to buy alcohol and drugs and I actually did like one of them. One night I was doing my job and this girl grabbed my attention, I turned around and this girl that I thought was so attractive asked me to walk her to her car, I didn’t really think much about it but it felt good to walk with her outside for that brief moment because I wasn’t super used to girls and stuff just giving me attention out of the blue. I remember at the time just having such a distaste for other people internally.  She complimented me and I thought what she said was kinda stupid but I genuinely did like her.  We talked a little bit. I can’t remember who was initiating it but I felt like I kept trying to talk to her but she wasn’t giving me the attention I was looking for, to be fair I kept saying very anti social things like in a way. But I remember thinking she doesn’t want me because she could have anybody she wants so why would she want me, and if she does she has some kind of image of me that I’m a safe guy that’s not gonna hurt her. At the end of the night she kind of just stood next to me looking up at me with her pretty eyes and I just remember thinking she’s so beautiful but I don’t want to get hurt by someone and I don’t want to hurt you so just go away and I walked off. I saw her one more time but walked away as soon as I saw her. One of the girls a few days later told me I looked like a psychopath. I thought my boss was planning to humiliate me, and maybe he was so I just stopped going to work, after about a week I decided it was best to probably just ask if I could get my job back so I went back and asked if I could come back to the job, they said sure and I came back one night and one of the managers told me she was glad that I was back. I stole some alcohol that night and one of the girls told on me and it infuriated me. I ended up working some more but I got too overwhelmed by a good job that I had later so I quit and i was feeling super paranoid so I took at trip to Miami and drove around Miami and Ft. Lauderdale whacked out of my mind but got a bad feeling from being there so I just left and went back home. I ended up in jail a few months later and spent like a month there. While I was in jail my parents went inside my room and saw paperwork to buy a handgun and told me I had to go to this rehab type place in Florida. I spent about two years in this place off and on and it fucking sucked. I came back home and moved back in with my dad but he kept calling the police on my for having like panic attacks and freaking out and shit so after a while I ended up in jail for six months. I got out and continued to be mean to people and pretty soon I had an experience that made me realize some things. I’m having a hard time struggling with the fact that I did so many things to people that hurt them and I’m constantly having horrible negative thoughts. I just want this all to end and I want to put positive into the world but I don’t know what I can or should do and if I deserve a second chance. Looking back on life it felt like I didn’t really have much of a choice because I didn’t have any guidance or understanding and it seems like now people are starting to recognize that I’m struggling but when I look back, there were a few experiences I had where it seems like someone was trying to help me. Maybe with that girl I mentioned previously, and one of the last weeks of school a popular girl that I had been attracted to for a while came up and talked to me and was maybe dropping hints, idk. But I think she tried to hug me but I pulled away. I’m starting to recognize maybe other people have trauma in their life and other people feel vulnerable and they recognize that and can relate to me.  I just never admitted to myself that I had trauma and that I needed to deal with it. I hope there’s still a chance for me.

I’ve been using a backpack because I carry my laptop and a few other essentials. I have thought about switching to a tote bag (they look more put together), but honestly, having all that weight on one shoulder is just not fun. I don’t carry things around all day, but even just getting to and from work, it’s uncomfortable.

On top of that, I usually have a separate lunch bag, a travel coffee mug, and an electrolyte bottle in my hands—so I really prefer having my hands free and my shoulders balanced.

The problem is: most backpacks look super functional… and not in a cute way. I feel like I’m heading to class, not the office. I’d love to find something that feels more polished, stylish, and ""put-together"" without sacrificing comfort or practicality.

Has anyone found a good balance? Would really appreciate suggestions—with links if you have them!

I've perfected this mini chocolate cake that tastes like it's from a fancy bakery but costs less than $3 to make. Perfect for satisfying chocolate cravings without breaking the bank! The video is on my channel from link in bio if you wanna show some love ❤️😋

Ingredients

For the cake:
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons cocoa powder
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- Pinch of salt
- 1/2 cup milk with 1 tsp coffee powder dissolved
- 1 tablespoon oil or melted butter
- 1/2 teaspoon vinegar or lemon juice
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla essence (optional)

For the frosting:
- 2 tablespoons cocoa powder
- 2 tablespoons powdered sugar
- 2-3 tablespoons milk
- 1 teaspoon butter or oil
- 1 tablespoon cornflour (for thickening)

For sugar syrup:
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 3 tablespoons water
- Few drops of vanilla or coffee (optional)

Optional layers:
- Crushed biscuits (Parle-G, Marie, or whatever's in your pantry)
- A spoon of malai or fresh cream (if available)

Instructions

1. Prepare the cake batter
   Mix all dry ingredients in one bowl. In another, combine milk, oil, vinegar, and vanilla. Mix wet and dry ingredients until smooth without lumps.

2. Cook the cake
   - Option 1: Air fryer - Grease a small steel bowl or ramekin, pour batter up to 2/3 full. Air fry at 160°C for 10-12 minutes.
   - Option 2: Steam in a pan or pressure cooker (without whistle) for 20-25 minutes.
   - Test with a toothpick - it should come out clean when done.

3. Make the sugar syrup
   Heat sugar and water in a small pan until sugar dissolves completely. Add vanilla or coffee for extra flavor if desired. Let cool.

4. Make the frosting
   Mix cocoa, sugar, milk, and cornflour in a small pan. Cook on low heat, stirring constantly until thick and smooth. Turn off heat, stir in butter, and let cool.

5. Assemble the mini dream cake
   Lightly soak the cake with sugar syrup. In a small glass or bowl, layer cake, frosting, and biscuit crumbs. Repeat layers. Top with extra ganache or cream. Chill for 30 minutes before serving.

Money-saving tips

- Coffee in the cake batter and syrup gives a richer flavor without expensive ingredients
- No need for eggs or butter in the cake itself
- Uses pantry staples you likely already have
- Crushed biscuits give texture and volume without expensive nuts
- Stores in the fridge for up to 2 days (though it never lasts that long in my house!)

1kjyzie,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1kjyzie/explore_why_the_presto_frydaddy_deep_fryer_review/,Explore Why the Presto FryDaddy Deep Fryer Review Is a Must-Read for Home Cooks,"The **Presto 05427 FryDaddy Electric Deep Fryer, Green/Gold** is one kitchen gadget I never thought I needed until I started testing it. It’s taken over a prime spot on my counter, right between my toaster and coffee maker. Being someone who loves making comfort food at home—think crispy chicken wings, golden onion rings, and french fries—it felt only natural to put this deep fryer to the ultimate test. This device offers a balance between functionality and simplicity, and yes, there are both strengths and a couple of quirks to discuss.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This deep fryer comes in an eye-catching green and gold color scheme. While a deep fryer might not typically get points for aesthetics, the unique design adds a nice touch to my otherwise neutral-toned kitchen. It’s compact, measuring about 8.5 inches wide and 7.5 inches tall, which makes it a blessing for small spaces. Plus, at only 3 pounds, it’s ridiculously easy to move around. The swing-up handle is a small but thoughtful feature, making it portable without the risk of greasy fingers. However, if you’re as messy as I am, you’ll truly appreciate the ceramic nonstick surface. It’s PFAS-free, and cleanup after a frying session feels less like a chore and more like a 60-second task. On a less glowing note, the exterior material, while durable, tends to feel a little warm during use—something to be mindful of when handling.

**Ease of Use**  
From unpacking to operating it, I didn’t have to consult the manual more than once. The FryDaddy keeps things refreshingly simple, with a preset thermostat that maintains the perfect frying temperature automatically. There are no confusing buttons or dials to figure out. It follows a 4:4 ratio—four servings of food fried in just four cups of oil—which, to be honest, had me skeptical. But it delivers! Whether frying shrimp or fries, the food came out unbelievably crispy without tasting overly greasy. The heat-resistant lift-and-drain scoop feels like a genius inclusion. Not only does it serve food straight out of the fryer, but you don’t have to fumble with multiple utensils. That said, I did find myself occasionally wishing for a built-in timer as a safety reminder.

[**Time to see Presto 05427 FryDaddy Electric Deep Fryer cost on Amazon.**](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0d9hzl8xc/)

**Capacity and Performance**  
Though the product states a four-cup oil capacity, it feels like a sweet spot for small households or quick snacks. I tested it during multiple football game nights, whipping up fries, onion rings, and fried chicken all within minutes. I was impressed with the quick preheat time and how efficiently the fryer recovered oil temperature between batches. It kept consistent results throughout. However, if you’re looking to host a crowd, the limited capacity might mean refilling and reheating is in your near future.

**Highlights**  
- Compact and lightweight for easy storage.  
- Automatic thermostat adjustment eliminates guesswork when frying.  
- Ceramic nonstick surface makes cleaning a breeze.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- No built-in timer, requiring a bit of manual monitoring.  
- The exterior can heat up slightly during extended use.  

**Other Options**  
If you’re someone who likes more customization or needs larger cooking capacities, it’s worth considering alternative models like the Cuisinart Deep Fryer or the T-fal Ultimate EZ Clean Fryer. Both bring in additional features like adjustable temperature settings and larger oil reservoirs. That said, these models take up significantly more counter space and are more expensive. What sets the FryDaddy apart is its simplicity—it’s truly designed for quick and easy frying without overwhelming you with options. 

**True Value**  
Given its compact design, reliable performance, and low oil consumption, this fryer seems incredibly cost-effective for what it offers. While it lacks advanced features, it more than compensates with ease of use and quick cleanup, which saves time—an invaluable commodity in my book. While I wish it had a tiny bit more capacity, this machine proves its worth with every crispy bite of food.

Drinking clean, healthy water is a top priority for me and my family, so testing out the Hskyhan 720482840368 Alkaline Water Filter Cartridge has been an enlightening experience. This replacement filter for water pitchers doesn’t just promise clean water—it’s designed to improve pH levels, reduce impurities, and leave your water tasting fresh. Over the past month, it’s been running through its paces in my household, and the results have been pretty impressive, though not without a few quirks.

**Ease of Installation and Design**

Installing these filters is incredibly straightforward. My favorite part is how the filter slides effortlessly into place—no need to wrestle with complicated mechanisms. The minimalist design adds to the appeal. Plus, the instructions make the first-time use process smooth. I rinsed it under cold running water for about a minute, followed by soaking it and giving it a gentle shake—exactly as instructed. It may sound like a small task, but setting this up took under five minutes, and there were no leaks or hiccups at all.

[Check Hskyhan 720482840368 price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b097y1p9qy/)

**Improved Water Quality and Taste**

The most noticeable benefit is the marked improvement in water taste. I started using filtered water for tea and coffee, and suddenly, the flavors seemed to pop. There’s something about clean water that makes drinks feel vibrant. Additionally, the filter increases the pH level, making the water slightly alkaline, which has a smoother mouthfeel. For anyone concerned about contaminants, this filter ensures peace of mind, as it removes fluoride, chlorine, lead, and other harmful substances. Even my kids started asking for more water during meals—it’s just that fresh.

**Performance and Durability**

According to the specifications, each filter lasts approximately 40 gallons or one month, depending on usage. With a small household of four, this timeline held true during testing. I liked how the filtration remained consistent even as the filter approached its replacement date. However, it’s essential to ensure you’re replacing it on time. One minor downside is that filtered water needs to be consumed within six hours for the best taste—or stored in the fridge. Otherwise, the flavor can become slightly flat.

**Advantages**

- Provides noticeable improvement in water taste and smell  
- Easy-to-follow installation process with no leaks  
- Effectively removes pollutants like chlorine, lead, and fluoride  
- Boosts water pH levels, creating slightly alkaline water  
- Compact design fits perfectly into most water pitchers  

**Areas of Concern**

- Filtered water needs to be consumed or stored in the fridge within six hours  
- Requires approximately monthly filter replacement, which can add recurring costs  
- Cold water filtration only—high temperatures above 100.4°F may compromise performance  

**Good Aspects**

One of the most satisfying benefits is how versatile this filter is in daily life. From filling water bottles for workouts to making baby formula or cooking, it handles it all. It also enhances beverages like tea and coffee, delivering an unexpected yet welcome improvement in flavor. As a bonus, the materials used are BPA-free, giving added reassurance for families with kids or anyone prioritizing safety.

**Downsides**

Despite its strengths, it’s not without shortcomings. If water sits in the pitcher too long before being consumed, the taste does decline, which can be an inconvenience for those with busy schedules. Plus, while the 40-gallon filter lifespan is standard, frequent replacements can feel like a bit of maintenance, especially in households where water usage is high. Lastly, because this filter can’t handle hot water, people who might want to use it for cooking at high temperatures need alternative solutions.

**Competing Products**

When I compared this alkaline water filter cartridge to others, such as Brita and ZeroWater filters, it emerged as a strong contender. Unlike Brita, which doesn’t adjust pH levels, this filter provides a noticeable alkaline boost. On the other hand, ZeroWater offers incredibly pure filtration but lacks the pH-boosting capability, with some users also reporting a shorter filter lifespan. While the Hskyhan product may not filter as completely as ZeroWater, its ability to balance purification and alkalinity gives it a distinct edge. Plus, it’s more affordable than high-end competitors, making it ideal for families looking for quality without breaking the bank.

**Cost Efficiency**

When weighing the benefits against the price, this six-pack of filters proves to be a solid investment. Each filter has a balanced combination of advanced filtration and alkaline-enhancing capabilities, making it well-suited for health-conscious users. Compared to competitors, it strikes an excellent balance between affordability and functionality, offering plenty of “bang for the buck.”

Is it from the nexplanon or something else?,"I’m (24) on my third consecutive implant and have been on it for over 7 years now, but about 2 years ago I started getting excruciating pain in my pelvic region. Since it started it’s gotten worse over the past two years. I’m in constant pain every day and am so nauseous constantly. I’ve gone and had ultrasounds and have almost always had a cyst on my right ovary. 
In November 2024 my periods changed drastically. Over the years I’ve had nexplanon I’ve gone months without getting periods to bleeding two weeks off two weeks and a wide range of in between. For me my period changes about every 4-6 months but in November it completely changed consistency (went from bright red blood to coffee grounds in discharge) along with clots bigger than half dollars. I had a period go on for 36 days then had 12 days off, started again and lasted 18 days with 18 days off, and now I’ve been bleeding again. 
I started nexplanon knowing that periods were gonna be all over the place and I’m still perfectly fine with that, my worry is if the pain and other symptoms I’m experiencing are not from the nexplanon. I have history of uterine and ovarian cancer in my family and want to make sure if something is wrong I get it checked out. The pain I’m in has greatly affected my ability to work, went from 38 hrs a week and regularly picking up shifts to barely being able to work 24 hours a week. 
Me and my boyfriend (been together 5 years) do not want kids and he was planning to get fixed after we move in together which would be right before my three years for this nexplanon is up but if any of the pain I’m feeling is because of the nexplanon I obviously would want to remove it sooner. Idk what I’m even asking help on, I’ve tried pain killers (over the counter and prescribed), heating pads, hot showers and baths, physical therapy, diet changes, and more but nothing has worked to even manage the pain. I just need advice.. my pain is so bad most days that I don’t want to be alive to feel it. 

I have a gyno appointment tomorrow and would really appreciate any advice on questions I should ask and if any of the pain and other symptoms could be from nexplanon. 

SYMPTOMS LIST:
Constant dull achy pain under bellybutton that turns into a sharp squeezing pain
Stabbing pain in one ovary that switches to the other side, occurring multiple times a day 
Frequent urination and never feeling empty after
Extreme pain before pooping
Exhausted during the day but can’t sleep at night
Constant nausea
Vomiting from pain
Contractions??
No appetite and get full quickly
Pressure below belly button
No desire to have sex
Sex is painful
Spotting after deep penetration 
Clots bigger than a quarter
Random heartburn?
Pain meds have zero effect on pain

1kjyw19,https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxsucks/comments/1kjyw19/i_installed_windows_into_my_hardlinux_fan/,I installed Windows into my hard-Linux fan coworker's PC,"We work at a tech company. He manages those server things at the basement of the company. He just dwells there near that room, doing some stuff with his keyboard and his beloved vim program. When we go to the lunch with friends and all, he just tells about vim all day. Bruh, just get a life. He would just bore us to death with speeches like how vim was the best for programmers.

I got bored of this one day, so when he was not around, I opened his work computer. There it was, vim. I was gonna install Windows to this but how to exit vim? I was searching the forums of how to exit vim. I was typing quit all the time. Stupid program was not working. How is this even good? My stupid friend, he didn't know shit.

So I went angry and hard rebooted the PC. And I installed Windows 11 to it. It installed in 5 minutes. Then I ran away.

So, when he returned from the lunch, he came to upstairs office and told us ""who installed that abomination Windows 11 to my PC?"" I told him I did. I told about how Windows is easier, you don't have to dabble in stupid terminals and stuff. Also not with vim either.

He stood there, clutching his “I  Linux” mug like it was his last lifeline. “You WIPED my Kubernetes clusters! My Docker containers! My ENTIRE CI/CD pipeline!” he roared, spitting out buzzwords I vaguely remembered from a DevOps meeting I slept through. I shrugged. “Bruh, Windows 11 has, like, PowerShell or something. Just Google it.”

He looked like he was about to summon the Linus Torvalds to smite me. “PowerShell?!” he screeched, like I’d suggested replacing his vim with Comic Sans. “You think PowerShell can handle my 47-node Kubernetes cluster? You’ve ruined EVERYTHING!” I leaned back in my chair, smirking. “Mate, Windows has a Start menu. Click a button, problem solved. Stop crying.”

The office was dead silent. Everyone was staring—half trying not to laugh, half terrified he’d yeet his keyboard at me. He stormed back to the basement, muttering about “proprietary garbage” and “Microsoft’s capitalist dystopia.” I figured he’d just rage-quit vim for good and embrace the Windows life. I mean, who wouldn’t love a shiny new File Explorer?

Big mistake. The next morning, I came to work and my laptop—MY precious gaming rig with RGB lights and all—was… wrong. The screen was black, with white text scrolling like some 90s hacker movie. “Welcome to Arch Linux,” it said. ARCH LINUX?! I mashed the keyboard, but all I got was a terminal prompt blinking at me like it was mocking my soul.

I sprinted to the basement. There he was, sitting cross-legged in front of his server rack, sipping coffee, with vim open on his newly restored Linux setup. “Oh, you’re here,” he said, all calm and smug. “Nice laptop. I optimized it for you. No bloatware, no Windows telemetry. Just pure, open-source bliss. That screen you saw was vim, now find out how to quit it and install a desktop environment. Ha-Ha""

“YOU MONSTER!” I yelled. “What did you do to my Call of Duty shortcuts?!” He smirked. “Shortcuts? Pfft. Real men use pacman -S to install games. Also, I replaced your RGB software with a bash script. You’re welcome.”

I was ready to strangle him, but then he dropped the bomb. “By the way, I backed up your Windows install… on a floppy disk. Good luck.” A FLOPPY DISK?! I didn’t even know those still existed!

Now I’m sitting here, googling “how to exit Arch Linux” while he’s upstairs bragging about how he “de-Windows’d” my rig in under an hour. This means war. I’m not done yet. I’m gonna sneak into his server room tonight and set his wallpaper to the Windows XP Bliss hill. Let’s see how his precious Linux handles that.",18,1746963014.0,linuxsucks,17,0.78,False

Hi everyone,


 I am 35M, and from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, England. I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

1kjyspd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kjyspd/does_the_tastyle_k320it_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Does the Tastyle K320IT Single Serve Coffee Maker Review Reveal Its True Value?,"The Tastyle K320IT Single Serve Coffee Maker has become my daily brewing buddy, and let me tell you—it’s a mixed bag of efficiency and quirks. Designed to cater to coffee and tea drinkers alike, this compact machine hosts multiple brew options and a space-saving footprint, making it a compelling choice for kitchens or workspaces with limited real estate. Across weeks of regular use, it has mostly impressed, but a few frustrations popped up along the way that are worth discussing.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Its sleek and compact structure, measuring just 9.3 inches deep, 4.6 inches wide, and 12 inches high, fits neatly on my crowded kitchen counter. The black exterior with BPA-free plastic construction gives it a modern yet unobtrusive look. The removable drip tray has been a game-changer for me; it’s smartly designed to avoid messy splashes, which always drive me nuts when using shorter cups. And yet, it also accommodates taller travel mugs up to 7.3 inches if you remove all the drip trays—perfect for me when rushing out the door. However, I wasn’t too thrilled about the non-removable water reservoir. While its small, one-cup capacity does conserve space, it feels slightly inconvenient having to add fresh water before every brew.

**Performance and Brew Features**  
Here’s where the magic lies—this coffee maker offers four distinct brewing styles: Hot Coffee, Bold Coffee, Over Ice Coffee, and Iced Tea. My mornings have been brightened by the Bold Coffee option that delivers a robust flavor, while my afternoons occasionally feature a refreshing iced tea brewed right into a mug filled with ice. However, users should note that even the “iced” options still brew hot—so there’s a bit of waiting and adjusting involved if you don’t want to dilute the drink too much. I appreciated the included accessories for K-Cups, ground coffee, and tea leaves. It turns a single-serve brewer into a versatile machine. 

[Grab Tastyle K320IT at the best price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0dqdltf4j/)  

**Ease of Use**  
Operating the Tastyle K320IT is a no-brainer, thanks to its intuitive button controls. With a descale reminder and self-cleaning feature built into the system, maintenance becomes less of a hassle too. The auto shut-off functionality has been particularly handy—it saves energy and gives peace of mind, especially for someone forgetful like me who occasionally leaves appliances on. Still, I couldn’t help but wish the one-cup reservoir featured a removable water tank for simplified refills and cleaning.

**Strengths**  
- Compact design ideal for tight spaces  
- Versatile brewing options catering to multiple preferences  
- Smart drip tray design prevents splashes, with travel-mug capability  
- Includes a descale reminder and cleaning functionality  
- Energy-efficient auto shut-off feature  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Non-removable water reservoir creates repetitive refilling before each use  
- “Iced” brew options still produce hot liquid directly, requiring extra cooling  
- Limited brew size range means no more than 16 ounces per brew  

**Product Rivals**  
While exploring similar single-serve coffee makers, a couple of competitors stood out. The Keurig K-Mini, for instance, offers a similarly compact design but lacks the versatility of tea brewing and the multiple accessories that this coffee maker includes. On the flip side, Keurig’s models often feature removable reservoirs, which I personally find superior for convenience. Another contender is the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, which also handles K-Cups and ground coffee. However, it’s bulkier and doesn’t cater to tea lovers—something the Tastyle K320IT handles effortlessly. This machine may not dominate every category, but it definitely has its niche appeal.

**Value for Money**  
Considering its blend of versatility and intelligent design features, the price strikes a reasonable balance for what’s on offer. It’s compact, includes tools for different brewing preferences, and saves energy with its automatic shutdown. However, the lack of a removable reservoir might make some buyers hesitate. If you’re someone who needs a flexible brewing machine but prioritizes counter space and simplicity, this little workhorse makes a strong case.

This was not a night flight for either of the timezones except for the first few hours which would be end of the night for Paris. 

Yes there were some drinks in the galley, but these had very limited choices, even water was often out and the crew was no where to be seen so you couldn’t ask for something else. You could not get an alcoholic beverage if you had wanted to. (I don’t really care for alcohol but for a non-budget carrier one of the perks is the free drinks?)

**Highlights**

* **The U.S. Department of Defense aims to completely remove Chinese rare earth materials from weapon systems by 2027, targeting strategic independence from China’s near-monopoly on critical minerals.**
* **Chinese export controls and trade tensions are disrupting global rare earth supply chains, potentially impacting fighter jet production, missile systems, and advanced military technologies.**
* **Allies like Australia, Japan, and Europe are actively developing alternative rare earth mining and processing capabilities to support U.S. defense industrial base resilience.**

*Rare earth elements (REEs) are the unsung heroes behind many advanced military technologies. These 17 metals possess unique magnetic, luminescent, and strength properties essential for high-performance defense systems. U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) contractors like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon rely on rare earth magnets (especially neodymium-iron-boron, or NdFeB, and samarium-cobalt types) and other REE-based components in a wide array of applications. For example, an F-35 Lightning II fighter jet contains over 900 pounds of rare earth materials in its electronic systems, electric motors, and actuators. Naval platforms are even more demanding – an Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer uses about 5,200 pounds of rare earths, and a Virginia-class attack submarine roughly 9,200 pounds. These materials are embedded in jet engines, missile guidance and precision weapons, radar and sonar systems, satellites, and communications.*

# Sourcing Rare Earths

or decades, DoD prime contractors and their suppliers have sourced rare earth materials through complex global supply chains – supply chains that often run through China. While the U.S. pioneered rare earth magnet technology and still designs systems like sintered NdFeB magnets domestically, China has come to dominate every step of the rare earth supply chain over the past 30 years. Today, China is the world’s largest miner, refiner, and magnet manufacturer for rare earths, accounting for about 90% of global rare earth production and an even higher share of processed rare earthoxides and metals.

Between 2020 and 2023, 70% of the rare earth elements imported to the U.S. came from China according to [numerous accounts(opens in a new tab)](https://www.indiatoday.in/diu/story/china-choke-rare-earth-minerals-will-hurt-us-fighter-jets-trade-war-2709410-2025-04-15#:~:text=China%E2%80%99s%20importance%20to%20the%20US,the%20United%20States%20Geological%20Survey).  Even allied sources ultimately depend on China – Australia’s Lynas Corp. is the largest rare-earth miner outside China, yet it has historically sent at least some of its concentrates to China for refining due to a lack of local processing capacity as [cited by CSIS(opens in a new tab)](https://www.csis.org/analysis/consequences-chinas-new-rare-earths-export-restrictions#:~:text=279%2C000%20kg%20of%20dysprosium%20per,refining%20until%20at%20least%202026).

For defense contractors, this monopoly means that many critical components are effectively single-sourced from China. A recent [*Reuters* report(opens in a new tab)](https://www.reuters.com/world/china-hits-back-us-tariffs-with-rare-earth-export-controls-2025-04-04/#:~:text=Two%20industry%20sources%20said%20Chinese,China%20for%20use%20in%20avionics) highlighted that certain rare earth materials for U.S. aerospace avionics are available only from Chinese suppliers, causing serious concern in the industry.

Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Technologies (RTX), Honeywell, and Boeing have all faced challenges tracing and securing non-Chinese sources for the rare earth magnets and alloys embedded in products like jet engines, sensors, and guidance units cites the [*Reuters*(opens in a new tab)](https://www.reuters.com/world/china-hits-back-us-tariffs-with-rare-earth-export-controls-2025-04-04/#:~:text=Two%20industry%20sources%20said%20Chinese,China%20for%20use%20in%20avionics) account.

In some cases, Chinese-origin content has slipped past oversight: in 2022, the Pentagon temporarily halted deliveries of new F-35 jets after discovering that a samarium-cobalt alloy in an F-35 turbomachine pump magnet was produced in China, [violating federal acquisition rules(opens in a new tab)](https://breakingdefense.com/2022/09/f-35-deliveries-suspended-after-finding-chinese-alloys-in-magnets/#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Pentagon%20has,pumps%20was%20produced%20in%20China).

This incident underscored how deeply Chinese rare earth materials are embedded in U.S. defense systems, often “hidden” in subcomponents sourced through complex contractor tiers.

# Biden-Era Ban on Chinese Magnets by 2027

Concern over these dependencies led to bipartisan action during the Biden administration. In 2022, Congress and the White House began moving to ban Chinese-origin rare earth magnets and products in U.S. defense platforms. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY2023 and FY2024 included provisions tightening restrictions on sourcing of magnets. The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) was updated to reflect a two-stage ban:

* Phase 1 (through 2026): Contractors cannot deliver any end item containing NdFeB or samarium-cobalt magnets melted or produced in China (or other adversarial countries like Russia, Iran, North Korea) [per Acquisition.gov(opens in a new tab)](https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/252.225-7052-restriction-acquisition-certain-magnets-tantalum-and-tungsten.#:~:text=,c%29%20of%20this%20clause%2C%E2%80%94). However, during this phase, magnets made elsewhere *could* use Chinese-origin feedstock. This gave industry some time to adjust sourcing.
* Phase 2 (effective January 1, 2027): The restriction expands to cover the entire supply chain of these magnets. Contractors will be prohibited from delivering any end item containing an NdFeB or SmCo magnet if any stage of its production – from mining of the rare earth ore, to refining, alloying, and magnet manufacturing – occurred in China or other covered countries.

In other words, by 2027 the DoD must purge Chinese rare earth content completely from its weapon systems.  But several experts REEx has spoken with in the industry mention this will be nearly impossible to achieve.

This looming deadline sent a clear signal: defense suppliers must “de-Sinicize” their rare earth supply chains within a few years. The Biden administration also ramped up transparency requirements – for instance, requiring contractors to disclose the country of origin for any REE permanent magnets used in weapon systems.  See [General Accounting Office notice(opens in a new tab)](https://www.gao.gov/assets/880/871168.pdf#:~:text=Page%202%20GAO,source%20of%20certain%20rare%20earth). In parallel, the Pentagon invested in domestic projects to begin closing the gap (more on those efforts in a moment).

As of early 2025, this prohibition on Chinese magnets by 2027 remains on the books. The policy reflected a broad bipartisan consensus on reducing dependence on an adversary for mission-critical materials. But it also posed a daunting challenge: the U.S. had (and still has) no full-scale domestic rare earth magnet supply chain, and alternative suppliers are limited. The question heading into 2025 was whether the incoming administration would stay the course or adjust the timeline.

# Trump’s Second Term: Policy Continuity or Change?

Donald Trump’s return to the White House in January 2025 has so far reinforced the push for rare earth supply chain security, albeit with his characteristic hardline twist. In some ways, on steroid multiple executive orders are linked to critical minerals and rare earths.

The new administration has not reversed the 2027 Chinese magnet ban for defense systems – a move that would likely be unpopular in Congress – but it faces the reality that the clock is ticking. Trump officials have hinted at flexibility in implementation if absolutely necessary to avoid grounding U.S. programs, but there is no formal change to the deadline. If anything, Trump’s team is doubling down on the need to eliminate Chinese rare earths from defense platforms, framing it as part of a broader “economic decoupling” for national security.

# Again, early into his second term, President Trump issued a flurry of executive actions targeting critical minerals supply chains and Chinese trade practices:

* Executive Order on Domestic Minerals (March 20, 2025): President Trump signed an EO invoking emergency defense powers to boost domestic mining and processing of critical minerals, including rare earths[csis.org(opens in a new tab)](https://www.csis.org/analysis/unpacking-trumps-new-critical-minerals-executive-order#:~:text=On%20March%2020%2C%202025%2C%20President,progress%20of%20domestic%20minerals%20security)[csis.org(opens in a new tab)](https://www.csis.org/analysis/unpacking-trumps-new-critical-minerals-executive-order#:~:text=The%20EO%20seeks%20to%20strengthen,into%20minerals%20projects%20at%20home). The order fast-tracks permits for mining projects on federal land, directs the Defense Production Act (DPA) Title III funds toward critical mineral processing facilities, and even taps the U.S. International Development Finance Corp. to fund mining ventures (an unusual use of an overseas development arm for domestic projects). It also established a new National Energy Dominance Council to oversee critical mineral development, signaling a top-priority status for rare earth independence. By empowering agencies to expedite mine-to-magnet projects, this EO aims to ensure the U.S. can meet the 2027 goal of an indigenous supply chain. Notably, the Pentagon’s 2024 Defense Industrial Strategy had already set a goal to establish a complete “mine-to-magnet” REE supply chain able to meet all defense needs by 2027 – Trump’s directive puts political muscle behind that objective. (Whether the goal is achievable that fast is another matter, as we discuss below.).
* On April 15, 2025, President Trump signed another executive order directing the Department of Commerce to initiate a Section 232 investigation into whether U.S. reliance on imported processed critical minerals and their derivative products poses a threat to national security. Citing the foundational role these materials play in defense systems, advanced manufacturing, and key infrastructure, the order warns that concentrated foreign control—especially by adversarial nations—has created serious supply chain vulnerabilities, economic instability, and strategic risk. The investigation will assess global sourcing, pricing distortions, and foreign market manipulation, with potential outcomes including tariffs, import restrictions, and incentives to boost domestic production and recycling. This move signals a major escalation in U.S. industrial policy, linking critical mineral security directly to defense readiness and economic resilience
* Trade Measures – Tariffs and Investigations: The Trump administration resurrected and escalated the trade war with China. In early 2025, President Trump unveiled a “Reciprocal Trade” policy that slapped hefty tariffs on imports from nations running big trade surpluses with the U.S. China was hit hardest. By April 2025, Chinese imports faced combined tariffs reportedly exceeding 125%–145% in some categories – a mix of base tariffs, special tariffs (citing issues like fentanyl), and legacy Section 301 duties. Beijing’s retaliation specifically targeted America’s tech and defense Achilles heel: critical minerals. In an April 4 announcement, China suspended exports of several heavy rare earth metals and high-performance rare earth magnets vital to defense and high-tech industries. As cited above, just days later, on April 15, Trump responded with another Executive Order directing the Commerce Department to initiate a Section 232 national security investigation into imports of critical minerals and their downstream products. This investigation – akin to those that justified steel and aluminum tariffs in 2018 – will evaluate the harm of foreign reliance and consider new import restrictions or tariffs on critical mineral products. The aim is twofold: pressure U.S. industry to source domestically and increase leverage against China. If Commerce finds that imports threaten national security, Trump could impose tariff-rate quotas or outright tariffs on non-allied sources of rare earth oxides, metals, and magnets. Any Section 232 measures would supersede the earlier “reciprocal” tariffs, potentially institutionalizing a long-term protective barrier around U.S. rare earth supply chains.
* Procurement Rule Changes and DPA Funding: The Trump Pentagon has indicated it will enforce the coming 2027 magnet ban strictly, but it also moved to help industry comply. In February 2025, the DoD expanded stockpiles of critical rare earth oxides and alloys and urged contractors to qualify non-Chinese sources ahead of the deadline. Use of the Defense Production Act funding has accelerated: building on Biden-era investments, Trump’s defense officials in 2025 announced new DPA Title III awards to companies establishing rare earth magnet manufacturing on U.S. soil. For example, USA Rare Earth received additional funding to complete a sintered NdFeB magnet plant in Oklahoma (a project initially backed by DOD in 2020). Similarly, MP Materials – owner of America’s sole rare earth mine in Mountain Pass, CA – is being supported through the final steps of developing domestic refining and magnet-making capacity. These efforts started under the prior administration but are being touted by Trump as evidence that the U.S. will be ready to break free from Chinese magnets on schedule.

So far, none of President Trump’s actions suggest a loosening of the Biden-era restriction on Chinese rare earth content; if anything, his confrontational approach with Beijing reinforces the logic behind it.

However, Trump’s aggressive trade posture has provoked a strong Chinese response – one that is already reverberating through defense supply lines.

# Chinese Export Controls & Impact on Defense Programs

Within months of Trump’s inauguration, the U.S.-China trade confrontation escalated into a rare earth standoff. China’s Ministry of Commerce announced export controls on seven categories of rare earth materials (samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium – primarily medium and heavy rare earths).

These measures, effective immediately as of April 2025, require special licenses for any export of the listed minerals and also cover finished products like rare earth magnets. Beijing’s move was explicitly framed as retaliation to Trump’s tariff hikes, aimed at “choking off supplies” of critical components to U.S. and allied industries.

While not a full embargo, the new controls give Chinese authorities power to throttle rare earth shipments by slowing or denying export licenses as [reported(opens in a new tab)](https://www.reuters.com/world/china-hits-back-us-tariffs-with-rare-earth-export-controls-2025-04-04/#:~:text=While%20the%20export%20controls%20stop,of%20export%20licenses%20it%20issues) in *Reuters*. In practice, this has introduced significant uncertainty and delays for U.S. companies dependent on Chinese feedstocks.

Analysts note three immediate implications: A temporary pause or slowdown in exports as China implements the licensing regime; potential selective denials targeting U.S. defense and aerospace firms (indeed, China simultaneously put 16 U.S. defense-related entities on an export blacklist, limiting their access to dual-use goods), and pressure on other countries to stay in China’s good graces to keep their supply flowing. The effect on U.S. defense programs has been alarm and adjustment. Companies like Raytheon, Honeywell, and Lockheed have been scouring non-Chinese sources for the specific grades of rare earth metals now under license.

Some of these – for example, dysprosium and terbium – are crucial for the heat-resistant magnets used in *fighter jet electric motors and actuators.* Without a stable supply, the development of next-gen platforms could stall. U.S. media, including *REEx*, have reported concerns that America’s upcoming sixth-generation fighter (the F-47) might face delays because critical rare earth components in its avionics and engines are suddenly harder to obtain. By contrast, China’s own military programs remain secure in their domestic supply; tellingly, Chinese manufacturers just unveiled two prototype sixth-generation fighters of their own, which are likely proceeding on schedule with uninterrupted access to materials.

As one analysis at CSIS warned, *“further bans on critical mineral inputs will only widen the gap, enabling China to strengthen its military capabilities more quickly than the United States.”* In other words, China’s restrictions exploit a U.S. vulnerability – reliance on Chinese materials – to gain a strategic edge in the race for advanced weapons.

# Specific examples of the impact include:

* ***Fighter jet production: The F-47 program (Next Generation Air Dominance) was contracted to Boeing in March 2025, but just weeks later China’s export curbs forced U.S. suppliers to scramble for key inputs. High-performance magnets and yttrium-based coatings for the F-47’s engines and systems are among the items now under export license. SFA Oxford, a consultancy, noted that without reliable access to neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium, U.S. sixth-gen jets could hit production bottlenecks. Meanwhile, China, as the dominant miner and refiner of these elements, can prioritize its own military needs. Chinese experts have openly suggested that Beijing’s rare earth policy is a pressure point to “deal a blow” to flagship U.S. programs like the F-47.***
* ***Missiles and munitions: Heavy rare earths like dysprosium are needed for the magnets in fin actuators of missiles (keeping magnets coercive at high temperatures). Any slowdown in dysprosium exports could impact production of systems such as the new Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) or hypersonic weapon prototypes that use these materials. So far, DoD is assessing stockpiles and might allocate strategic reserves of dysprosium and terbium to certain missile programs to avoid schedule slips. However, those stockpiles are limited – the U.S. National Defense Stockpile contains some rare earth inventory, but “not enough to supply its defense contractors in perpetuity.”***
* ***Sonar and electronic warfare systems: The Navy’s suppliers of advanced sonar transducers (Terfenol-D) and the Air Force’s suppliers of yttrium garnet radar components also report trouble securing Chinese shipments. Yttrium is now controlled, and it is essential for radar tuning devices and high-power laser systems. A CleanTechnica analysis highlighted that yttrium-based thermal barrier coatings – crucial for jet engines and lasers – are on the restricted list, meaning U.S. contractors must find workarounds or substitutes quickly.***

# (Note: Article shortened to meet Reddit word limits)

The U.S. government is actively supporting these ally efforts as part of a strategy to build a resilient supply network. A CSIS report emphasizes the importance of “financial and diplomatic support” for allied rare earth initiatives, because those projects will form the backbone of an alternative supply chain. For instance, the U.S. DFC (normally focused on developing nations) might invest in projects like Vietnam’s refinery or Australia’s processing plants to ensure they succeed.

Additionally, “friendshoring” is happening defense contractors are adjusting supply lines to source magnets and materials from friendlier nations. Japan and Australia are obvious preferred sources, but even suppliers in South Korea or within the Americas are being tapped to step in for China. This global realignment will take time, but it is clearly accelerating under the pressure of China’s recent restrictions.

# Toward Rare Earth Resilience–How Soon Can the U.S. Rebuild?

The race is on to establish a secure rare earth supply chain for the U.S. defense industrial base. Both policy and industry moves since 2020 have narrowed the gap, but significant vulnerabilities remain, especially for heavy rare earth elements that are hardest to source. The timeline for achieving true rare earth supply chain resilience – meaning the U.S. and allies can fully meet defense demand without Chinese inputs – is still uncertain. Optimistic targets center around the mid-to-late 2020s (around the 2027 mark aligned with U.S. policy), but many experts caution that it could slip into the early 2030s before all the pieces (mines, refineries, magnet factories) are in place and scaled.  REEx concurs with this latter more pessimistic vantage.  Even with REE industrial policy in place, the U.S. and West are likely several years away from full resilience.

Some indicators and milestones to watch on the timeline:

·     **2025–2026:** Several U.S.-funded projects aim to come online. By the end of 2025, MP Materials expects to be producing small batches (hundreds of tons) of NdFeB magnets at its new Fort Worth, TX facility. This deal is tied to General Motors. If successful, this will be the first domestic magnet production of this scale in decades, thoughstill <1% of global output as cited by CSIS. Likewise, Lynas’sU.S. heavy rare earth separation plant in Texas is slated to begin operations in 2026, which would provide a non-Chinese source of dysprosium and terbium oxides. Australia’s new refining capacity and other ally projects are also aiming for 2025-26 starts. These will greatly improve sourcing options if they stay on schedule.

·     **2027:** This is the make-or-break year set by policy. The expectation (or hope) is that by January 1, 2027, enough alternative supply exists such that U.S. defense contractors can fully comply with the Chinese magnet ban without waivers. We may see an uncomfortable period in 2026 where contractors build last-minute stockpiles or push for limited exceptions if projects are delayed. Realistically, heavy REEs (Dy, Tb, etc.) are the biggest concern – since even by 2027, China might still be the only large-scale source of refined heavy rare earths. If substitute designs or stockpile reserves cannot cover the need, the Pentagon might have to issue waivers or Congress might delay the full ban implementation. But publicly, the DoD and Congress are holding firm to the date, using it as a spur to industry.

·     **2028–2030:** By this window, if current plans bear fruit, the landscape should look very different. Multiple mines (in the U.S., Australia, Canada, etc.) could be feeding multiple separation facilities and magnet plants outside China.  The efforts might start yielding results (e.g., a new magnet factory in the EU or a large-scale processing in Estonia or Sweden).

The U.S. could be in a position not just to meet its own defense demand, but even to support allies with rare earth products. However, this optimistic scenario assumes no major setbacks – financing and permitting remain challenges, and China will not sit idle. Beijing could, for instance, drop prices or flood the market to undermine nascent competitors (a tactic it has used before to maintain dominance.

One wildcard in thistimeline is how the U.S.-China geopolitical dynamic evolves. PresidentTrump’s current approach is confrontational, seeking to pressure China economically. Yet, Trump is also known for striking deal-making when it suits his goals (recall the “Phase One” trade deal of 2020 in his first term). If rare earth constraints begin to significantly undermine U.S. defense readiness in the near term, Trump might be tempted to negotiate a strategic truce on this front. REEx has suggested this type of dynamic could unfold quickly. 

This could take the shape of a limited agreement where China guarantees rare earth deliveries for U.S. defense needs – perhaps in exchange for some tariff relief or other concessions. Such a deal would be politically sensitive (relying on China for critical materials cuts against the grain of decoupling), but Trump has shown pragmatism when American industry is at stake. It’s not inconceivable that behind the fiery rhetoric, backchannel discussions could emerge to secure a stable supply of specific rare earth products through 2027, buying time for the U.S. to get its own capabilities up to speed.

In the grand scheme, however, U.S. strategy is clearly orienting toward independence and allied self-reliance in rare earths. The current trade war has only reinforced the lesson that Beijing’s near-monopoly is a strategic liability. For U.S. defense contractors, the message is that the era of cheap Chinese magnets is ending – now is the time to forge new supply lines or innovate away from heavy dependence on at-risk materials. Initiatives in recycling (recovering rare earths from old electronics and weapons) and material science (developing non-REE substitutes for certain magnets) will also be part of the resilience equation.

***Conclusion***

***Rare earth elements may be hidden inside black boxes and circuit boards, but they have leapt to the forefront of geopolitical importance. The Biden-era policy to eliminate Chinese rare earths from Pentagon supply chains by 2027 set a bold course, and the Trump administration’s actions so far have stayed that course amid a sharpened trade conflict. U.S. defense giants like Lockheed and Raytheon are navigating a delicate transition – replacing a critical input even as global supply is squeezed.***

***The next few years will test whether America’s industrial base can overcome decades of outsourcing in a short time. Allies are stepping up with new mines and refineries, but scale and timing are crucial. If delays mount, President Trump could face a stark choice: either grant temporary reprieves on the Chinese magnet ban or cut an uneasy deal with China to keep U.S. weapons programs on track.***

***As REEx has chronicled, ultimately, the path to rare earth supply chain resilience is a marathon, not a sprint. The U.S. is running that race in earnest now, with 2027 as an important milestone – but true security may only be achieved when global reliance on China’s rare earths is finally a thing of the past.***

# MAY 10th, 2025~Opinion: America has the resources to confront China’s mineral extortion

[America can reclaim its status as a mineral superpower | Opinion – Deseret News](https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2025/05/10/america-mineral-resources-china-supply-chain-extortion/)

[Construction continues at the Thacker Pass lithium mine on April 24, 2023, near Orovada, Nev. The Biden administration has agreed to provide a $2.26 billion conditional loan to Lithium Americas, Thursday, March 14, 2024, to help cover construction costs of a processing facility at its giant lithium mine in the works in northern Nevada near the Oregon line.

It is no secret that China has weaponized control of the world’s mineral supply chains. We’ve already seen this when both the Biden and Trump administrations challenged China’s unfair trade practices. Beijing has responded by simply restricting or banning the export of minerals needed for America’s economy and defense industrial base.

China’s ever-growing chokehold on mineral supply chains — and U.S. reliance on imports — has been America’s Achilles’ heel for more than a decade. According to recent government [analysis](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/mcs2025), the U.S. is import-reliant for 40 critical minerals, with China the leading producer of 30.

The tentacles of China’s state-backed mineral empire stretch across the globe. Along with extraordinary control of global mineral production, China has also come to dominate the processing of minerals. And now, years of increasingly urgent warnings that China might use this control have become a grave reality. Chinese mineral extortion is no longer theoretical; it’s here, and it’s a crisis.

The obvious question is, can we do something about it? Not only is the answer a resounding “yes,” but we already have the resources needed to turn the tide.

While working with trading partners is certainly part of the answer to boosting America’s mineral security, our domestic productive potential is the difference right beneath our feet.

America’s mineral weakness is more perception and self-imposed circumstance than reality. For most of the 20th century, it was the United States — not China or anyone else — that was the world’s mineral superpower.

In fact, our war-winning productive capacity during World War II — known as the arsenal of democracy — was underpinned by our vast mineral resources. On the verge of war, the U.S. along with the British Empire controlled 75% of the world’s mineral production — an enormous strategic advantage.

With new urgency to meet soaring mineral demand and secure our supply chains, hardly a month goes by without stunning news of major domestic mineral discoveries. Innovative technologies also promise access to new resources and the potential to turn yesterday’s mine wastes into tomorrow’s supply chains.

A recent [study](https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/es/about-commodityinsights/media-center/press-releases/2024/071824-united-states-ranks-next-to-last-in-development-time-for-new-mines-that-produce-critical-minerals-for-energy-transition-s) confirmed that America’s mineral resources remain vast, though shockingly underdeveloped. For example, the U.S. copper endowment is comparable to those of Canada and Australia combined. And despite currently having just one producing lithium mine, our endowment of lithium is more than twice that of Australia, which currently accounts for half of the world’s lithium production.

With new urgency to meet soaring mineral demand and secure our supply chains, hardly a month goes by without stunning news of major domestic mineral discoveries. Innovative technologies also promise access to new resources and the potential to turn yesterday’s mine wastes into tomorrow’s supply chains.

# MAY 9th 2025~Expect shortages, higher costs amid China’s rare Earth cuts

In April 2025, China imposed even further export restrictions on seven additional medium and heavy rare Earth elements — samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium — in response to the Trump Administration’s tariffs on the country.

These elements were added to the already restricted sale of other rare Earth elements from 2024 to the U.S. including gallium, germanium and antimony.

A month later, these seven Earth elements are [soaring to double](https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250506PD211.html) or in some cases triple in price. As a result, it is very likely prices for semiconductors, electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy and storage applications are also going to rise.

At CES 2025, Electronics360 talked with Duncan Stewart, research director in Canada for market research firm Deloitte, where he prognosticated about further raw material export restrictions after the initial ban in 2024.

“It is highly likely things will get worse as export restrictions grow in 2025 as the trade war continues,” Stewart said.

Stewart suggested there were three ways to combat China’s raw material ban:

* Recycling
* Finding alternative sources
* National reserve build-up

However, this is going to take significant time.

# Significant dependencies

The U.S. has substantial dependencies on elements like germanium and gallium that are used in the manufacturing of semiconductors. These latest seven Earth elements are also used in semiconductor manufacturing as well as in the rare Earth magnets that China supplies 90% of the world’s supply.

These magnets are necessary for electric motors that are used in applications like EVs, drones, robots, missiles and spacecraft.

“The semiconductor industry is particularly sensitive to supply shortages,” said Adam Carter, CEO of Open Light, a custom PASIC design maker. “If shortages of critical materials arise, they will likely bring policy makers to the negotiating table and rethink the restrictions. While solutions may eventually emerge, the timeline remains uncertain.”

While other countries have some mining capacity for these elements, according to [Project Blue,](https://projectblue.com/) China accounts for 59.2% of refined germanium output and 98.8% of refined gallium production. Additionally, the U.S. received 70% of rare Earth imports between 2020 and 2023 from China, according to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/chart/34301/us-rare-earth-imports/?lid=wfudrdml0vwm).

Finding alternatives will take time and effort.

https://preview.redd.it/hf0xwncwx40f1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d5af85513e1fcabd33b1f680457117f4ce2e2d6

# Limited alternatives

Carter said there are no direct one-to-one replacements for gallium and germanium but there are alternatives like silicon and indium as well as advanced materials like carbon nanotubes. However, these alternatives come with limitations in terms of performance and cost, specifically for renewables and EVs.

“The impact of China's export restrictions will likely vary depending on the specific application and the availability of alternative materials and suppliers but could be significant,” Carter said.

The U.S. just signed an agreement with Ukraine to provide 22 rare Earth elements including lithium, graphite, manganese, zirconium, iron and various non-ferrous metals. However, not all of these will work as alternatives to the rare Earths coming from China and it is highly unlikely the [U.S. will see a quick payback.](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/US-Locks-in-Rare-Earth-Deal-with-Ukraine-but-Payoff-May-Take-a-Decade.html)

The Trump Administration is also expected to sign a rare Earth element deal with Saudi Arabia this month that will likely include some metals used in these sectors. But again, it will take time to see the materials come into the country.

# Recycling slowly

One suggested method of garnering new raw materials is through recycling. Unfortunately, while projects and some vendors are actively working on systems to recycle raw materials such as gallium and germanium and other rare Earth elements, they are in the nascent stages.

The EcoGaIN research project developed a process for gallium-containing waste materials to [recycle nearly 100% of gallium](https://www.geosfreiberg.de/en/references/recovery-of-gallium-from-production-waste-in-the-semiconductor-industry.html) to be recovery and re-used.

Taiwan is emerging as a major electronics recycler, reclaiming rare Earth elements such as gallium from electronic waste. Solar Applied Materials Technology Corp. is developing in-house recycling processes to extract gallium and indium from electronic waste.

There is also a domestic U.S. program from the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to recycle optical-grade germanium used in defense and aerospace

A [Defense Logistics Agency program](https://www.dla.mil/About-DLA/News/News-Article-View/Article/3075059/dla-program-introduces-domestic-germanium-recycling-capability/) for recycling optical-grade germanium used in military weapons systems and night vision equipment has led to new capability in the U.S. defense industrial base. The program is from a small team at Pennsylvania’s Tobyhanna Army Depot. This program is small but is looking to expand access to scrap germanium for re-use.

# Shortages inbound

With restrictions placed on rare Earth elements from China, companies have [already sounded alarms](https://www.ft.com/content/9cd56880-4360-4e11-8c22-e810d3787e88) that the volume has dropped by about half since the controls of gallium and germanium were implemented. If the restrictions continue, reserves that were built up when the restrictions were first imposed could be depleted, leading to shortages.

China’s dominance in rare Earth materials is due to a competitive edge thanks to its efficient, vertically integrated supply chain for mining, processing and refining.

And as this is unlikely to be the last round of rare Earth element restrictions, the supply chain will need to adapt to the new reality. According to [Tom’s Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/chinas-rare-earth-export-restrictions-threaten-global-chipmaking-supply-chains), that means global industries will need to source building their own supply of these rare Earth elements with investment in locations outside of China.

But in the meantime, shortages are inbound.

# What it means

To put it simply, prices are rising on everything that uses these rare Earth elements.

Tariffs, restrictions on semiconductors globally, restrictions on rare Earth elements and geopolitical instability are likely to disrupt the supply chain, leading to increased production costs for many industries.

“This could ultimately translate to higher prices for consumers on a range of products, from smartphones and computers to automobiles and household appliances,” Carter said.

Additionally, those looking to buy a new EV or install solar panels will likely look at an increase in price. The defense and aerospace industry will also likely have to pay more for semiconductors, magnets and other parts as these conditions coalesce.

Not just long-distance or virtual.I don't focus on age and like people who also don't. I don't mind gaps, just want someone who is a full adult - and no age-fetishists, please. If it seems like we might connect, I'm up (down) for a walk, a coffee/tea, a chat. Again - not looking for virtual, not looking for long distance. I'd love to find someone I can spend time with in the real world. Eventually looking for chemistry/romance, if the vibe is right for that, but not rushing and don't like to be rushed.

I like hyper-intelligent, introspective men, probably because that describes me as well. People who spend more time in the inner world than the world of things. I like men who are gentle, caring and reassuring - people who are kind and sensitive to the feelings of others. I tend like men who are slender with intelligent faces.

I'm kind, but also very honest, direct and straightforward. Tough half the time, sensitive the other half of the time - it's not a contradiction. I tend to put people at ease and have been told that I have a calming presence. I'm reasonably attractive, but don't try to compete with others on that account. I'm short (5'1), athletic build, blondish/brownish wavy hair, green eyes.

I'm looking for a deeper connection that builds over time - not a one-time thing or a casual fling. Having said that, I don't put labels and don't need them either.

Send me a message and tell me about you - the more the better, especially on a deeper level, and include a pic (imgur link works). I'll send one back if you ask. I don't tend to respond to messages that don't tell me much, or where I can tell that we wouldn't have potential for chemistry. I would still like you if I met you, I would definitely value you and I definitely appreciate your response. But I only reply if I think there's potential. Schedule-wise, I often wait till late to respond, (I like PM better than chat,  and use chat for messaging, not for hanging out on - I just don't have the bandwidth).

I wish you the best on your journey - it's not easy to find and make connections.",2,1746962056.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

Confused after our 3rd date,"I (25M) met this guy (26M) a few weeks ago and we’ve had three dates so far. Things felt pretty amazing, but now I’m unsure if it meant something to him or if it was just a one-time thing.

Date 1: We went for drinks and had great chemistry. We made out, cuddled a bit, and shared personal stories. No sex — just a lot of emotional warmth. He even said he felt safe with me.

Date 2: He came over again, and we spent hours talking, cuddling, and being affectionate. Still no sex. Almost 9h together. No sex, just cuddles and conversation. 

Date 3 (yesterday): We spent the evening together — got snacks, watched the sunset on the rooftop, held hands, kissed, and eventually got more intimate (oral only, both of us finished). Afterward, we went out for fries, talked about love languages (he said his are words of affirmation and acts of service), and he told me he’s very very pragmatic. That night he even slept over. In the morning, we kissed, cuddled more, I made him coffee, and he left around 10am.

Before leaving, I asked: “When will I see you again?”
He said he’s busy this week but “probably next weekend.” It didn’t feel very enthusiastic or defined, and that’s where my anxiety kicked in.

The date felt deeply romantic and emotionally close to me — not like a casual fling. But now I fear it was just a hookup for him. I’m trying not to overthink, but the contrast between the emotional intensity and his “maybe next weekend” vibe has me questioning everything. 

Something important: between the first and second date, no text everyday. That’s made me stressed and anxious cuz I do love have messages even once during the day to be sure the person wants me. I’m an over-thinker and insecure. He’s Flemish, square and pragmatic.
I’m Brazilian! 

The data is always romantic and hot. Lots of love. But outside the date, this happens. No message.

Was I reading too much into it? How can I know if he’s emotionally interested or just enjoyed the moment?",0,1746961971.0,AmIOverreacting,1,0.5,False
1kjylzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1kjylzs/could_the_sweetcrispy_countertop_ice_maker/,Could the Sweetcrispy Countertop Ice Maker BKIMGJJ18 be your perfect kitchen upgrade review?,"Using the Sweetcrispy BKIMGJJ18 Countertop Ice Maker Machine has become part of my daily routine, and I have a lot to say about this compact device. It’s a sleek and portable self-cleaning ice maker that delivers a solid performance for its size. I initially got it for camping trips and small parties, but it quickly earned a permanent spot on my kitchen countertop. While it checks a lot of boxes for convenience and functionality, there are a few quirks worth mentioning. 

**Design and Portability**

This portable ice maker is designed to fit comfortably wherever you need it—be it the kitchen, office, RV, or even at a barbecue. Coming in at just 11.6 x 8.8 x 12.5 inches and weighing 15.4 pounds, it’s lightweight enough for me to carry around with its handle. I’ve personally brought it to a backyard party, and its size made transport hassle-free. The coal-black finish is modern and understated, blending pretty well in a variety of decors without shouting for attention. Its overall build quality feels sturdy despite being compact.

**Smart Features and Ease of Use**

One of the most pleasant surprises was how intuitive the ice maker is to operate. With its simple control panel, I didn’t have to fiddle around to figure things out. The machine notifies you when the water runs low or the ice basket is full, which is incredibly handy. Its operation noise is quieter than most kitchen appliances at under 40dB, which means it doesn’t disrupt ongoing conversations or theme music. I tested it during movie night with friends, and no obnoxious buzzing interrupted our dialogue-heavy film.

[Find the best price for Sweetcrispy BKIMGJJ18 on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0cvvwr4m1/)

**Performance and Ice-Cube Quality**

The real MVP feature here is its ability to produce nine bullet-shaped ice cubes in just six minutes. I’ve timed it, and this claim holds true! The quality of the ice bullets is smooth; they don’t hurt your hands when you’re tossing them into glasses, which is especially great when my kids are handling them. Plus, the machine offers two size options for cubes, which is genius. The smaller size worked beautifully for keeping fish chilled on a seafood platter at last weekend’s dinner, while the larger size was perfect for iced coffee—my summer staple. I also loved the transparent window at the top, which lets you peek at the ice being made without opening the machine.

**Self-Cleaning Functionality**

Its self-cleaning function has got to be the unsung hero here. Press and hold the on/off button for 5 seconds and voilà—the machine starts cleaning itself. As someone who values energy-efficient and low-maintenance appliances, this feature is gold. It’s especially reassuring since clean ice is non-negotiable. Cleaning it manually might have made me use it less often, so this effort-free feature won me over.

**Highlights**

- Produces 26.5 pounds of ice in 24 hours  
- Two different sizes of bullet-shaped ice cubes  
- Easy-to-use control panel with indicator lights  
- Quiet operation—noise level below 40dB  
- Compact and portable with a carrying handle  

**Critiques**

- Ice melts relatively quickly in the basket since it's not refrigerated  
- The water reservoir could have been larger  
- Produces mostly smaller batches, which may feel limiting for larger crowds  

**Competing Products**

Compared to other countertop ice makers like the GE Profile Opal 2.0 or Igloo ICEB26HNWH, the product holds its ground for affordability and simplicity. The GE Profile is more high-tech with Wi-Fi and dedicated apps, but it comes at a steeper price, not to mention a bulkier design. Igloo models often have a more retro aesthetic, but they lack Sweetcrispy’s self-cleaning feature, which is a game-changer for me. In terms of convenience and portability, this model excels, even if it doesn’t have extra bells and whistles like an app or refrigerator-style cooling.

**Price Performance**

This ice maker is reasonably priced for what it offers. The combination of its self-cleaning function, two ice size options, and compact portability makes it a solid pick against its higher-end competitors. It’s not a luxury item, nor does it try to be—it’s tailored for everyday users looking for a balance of cost-efficiency and practicality.

The downside is that my appetite has increased with working out. Which is not great since I need to be in a calorie deficit.

For reference I’m 5’5 and 165lbs. I weigh my food using a scale and eat 1600 cal. There are some foods that I don’t track. Lettuce, tomatoes, dried spices, fresh herbs, lemon/lime juice, cucumber, plain steeped tea, and brewed coffee from my moka pot.  

Other than that, I weigh everything on the scale. Yes, including oils. 

I know that I should probably lower my calorie count to lose weight since I’m not seeing any changes but I am already struggling with my appetite and worry about slipping back into bad habits. 

2 years ago I tried calorie counting but I never lost weight. At the time I weighed 154lbs.  I felt frustrated that I wasn’t losing weight and wasn’t trying hard enough. I lowered my calorie count to 1200 cal and exercised 5-6 times a week. 

I was constantly tired, dizzy, and lightheaded. My hair also started falling out too. I was very obsessed with counting calories. I used to weigh my cough syrup when I had a cold, along with other things. I still didn’t lose weight after putting myself through that. 

I had to take a break from calorie counting because it was getting out of hand and affecting me negatively. I also ended up having to take iron supplements for a full year because I had iron deficiency anemia. 

I ended up also putting a pause to working out and focused on eating normally after doing 1200 cals. Mainly because I needed to eat to bring up my iron levels but also because I was very hungry. I only went on walks and that was my main exercise. 

Now I’m back. I’m 11 lbs heavier and trying to lose weight again. 

I want to lose weight but eating 1600 cal + working out makes me more hungry. Clearly losing weight is not happening. But I also couldn’t lose weight when I was eating 1200 cal. I don’t think I could eat any lower without harming my health and becoming iron deficient again.

I wanted to share my B12 deficiency success story in the hope that it may give clues for other people with the same issue.

Mine started with another issue - bruxism or teethgrinding at night. It got so bad that it caused referred issues in my ear. I went to various doctors and specialists, but they couldn’t find anything wrong. Sometimes it was worse and sometimes not but I didn’t know why. Having had this for over a year I went back to the doctors who said it might be because I am anaemic and gave me a full blood test but here in the UK, they don’t call you back if there’s nothing wrong which they didn’t so was none the wiser.

At the same time, I’d also had problems with my vision, it’s been gradually getting worse for many many years, we got to a point where I was struggling to use computer screens, sometimes it was better or worse through the day depending on whether I was tired or how much I had eaten. I got increased light sensitivity, I was really struggling to work in the fluorescent lights in the office for example. I’d also got to the age of starting to wear varifocal glasses, high-end progressive lenses. They put a lot more demand on your eyes and my eyes were struggling to cope with them, they would get tired or even go cross eyed at the end of the day. Again, I didn’t know why. I had my vision  checked and eyeball scanned multiple times by opticians but they couldn’t find anything wrong.

Having nothing back from my doctors I then logged into my online NHS account and downloaded all my blood results from the system. To try and work out what was going on I put them into ChatGPT along with all my various symptoms. I don’t advocate using AI to try and self diagnose yourself (you still need physical blood test and checking for example)but actually in my case it hugely helped! The results that came back were incredibly good, I had a conversation with it about other symptoms and it very quickly pointed towards Deficiency in B12 and a number of other vitamins such as vitamin D magnesium (this is a key deficiency for teeth grinding) and folate. This was caused by mild irritable bowel symptoms I had had for five years but again hadn’t connected the symptoms together. This had been slowly depleting certain vitamins which are mainly absorbed in the small intestine - B12 being the biggest - I then realised there were some other small symptoms I’ve had on and off through the years which I hadn’t realised were connected, such as feeling out of breath when stressed, mouth ulcers, unable to drink beer without getting a really bad hangover or have more severe reactions to coffee. All of these are related to the process of methylation in your body (look it up online) which regulates a number of things including blood sugar but more importantly broader DNA synthesis. B12 is one of the core drivers of methylation.

So I got a private blood test for my vitamins which confirmed the diagnosis. Interestingly, I actually had low normal levels of active B12 in my blood, but I was functionally deficient due to the irritable bowel. I did this myself privately as my doctor wasn’t much help and the NHS are not good at identifying functional deficiency. As my active B12 blood level wasn’t in the severely deficient NHS range. I’m pretty sure the doctor would have dismissed  me or told me to take tablets which I was doing anyway.

So I did start a high dose oral supplementation plan for the vitamins that my private blood test showed that I was deficient in, including high dose 5000 B12 sublingual tablets that you put under your tongue so it absorbs into your body easily. The first time I took a tablet (which don’t absorb a lot of B12 in each tablet it’s very gradual), I felt a little uplift despite it being just one tablet - I carried on supplementing daily for five weeks and I did start to get improvements in the vision symptoms moments of clarity, but it was very very slow, often I still had a blurry or milky vision I’ve had slowly growing for years. 

After five weeks, I decided to try a B12 injection. They are a little hard to come by here in the UK if not via your doctor, but you can get them privately through online services. I went for hydroxocobalamin, there is another type you are more likely to get at health or aesthetics clinics, but hydro is the one used by the NHS. They’re not very expensive the equivalent of about US$40. You can buy them yourself but I’m a wimp with needles so I wanted someone else to do it. Within four hours of my first injection, my vision started to come back. Within a few days it was starting to feel normal. I hadn’t realised how bad it had become. I started to notice some other improvements, such as waking in the morning without feeling really groggy, or having sensations of light floaters in the morning if I hadn’t eaten something (due to poor methylation).

I had a second injection a week later and the symptoms are mostly resolved, I may have a third injection not sure yet but will be continuing with daily orals as well. Alongside that I am treating my long-term irritable gut issues which is slowly starting to resolve but will take some time - again I worked out a detailed treatment plan thanks to ChatGPT. I’ve also had some test to ensure there’s nothing serious going on there and my teeth grinding is also reducing as I’m supplementing with some of the other vitamins that were equally becoming deficient over a long time such as magnesium, but it’s not going away completely yet.

I hope that is helpful to some people, in summary I learnt: 

- That the medical profession were really poor at identifying this. I had to work it out myself. I wish someone told me over a year ago would’ve saved a lot of hassle.
- I was functionally deficient in B12, so I had to advocate for my own health and treat myself as I still would not have been given injections under NHS protocols
- If you have a few small or chronic issues with your health, it’s important to try and connect them together, I hadn’t but when I did, I then got the lightbulb moment of what was causing the issue
- You need to get your blood tests done both full blood count and vitamins to have the information to decide what is going on. For example in my case one of my blood results is called the MCV, mine was borderline high but not high enough for the NHS to take any action. However, it was elevated which was a strong indication of B12 and folate deficiency.
- Use ChatGPT! I’m not kidding but ChatGPT helped me diagnose my problem, I talk to it a lot to put in different symptoms. I asked it to review global medical research on the issue. It was incredible. If it hadn’t been for the AI reviewing my blood results and connecting to my symptoms and also giving me a treatment plan that worked, if I just listened to my doctor, I’d still have the same problem. I also noticed other small things as I started to recover (such as blood vessels in my eyes becoming more normal) which I was able to ask Chat GPT about and in each case it gave me a very sensible answer which showed I was going in the right direction
- You do have to advocate for your own health. I mention this to friends and family and if I’m honest didn’t get much sympathy as it sounds like such a small thing, they think of vitamins as just small pills you take so can’t be serious. But if you’ve had B12 deficiency, you’ll know about all the various symptoms which are really unpleasant, particularly if chronic over a long period of time. I found no one really understood how much of an impact on my daily life it was having, so I was super pleased I sorted it out but you have to do it yourself! 

Sorry that was a little long but I hope it’s helpful for some people. Connect your symptoms, make sure you get blood tests to understand what is going on, use AI to help you diagnose if necessary, don’t give up on doctors but don’t expect a lot of help if you are borderline deficient as I was. 

Good luck and I wish you good health! Pete.",8,1746961373.0,B12_Deficiency,8,1.0,False

I remember seeing her for the first time at an event and thinking, “Woah, why is she so pretty?” Since then, I’ve always found myself gravitating toward her whenever we’re in the same space, to put it simply. 
At the time, I wasn’t in the best place mentally or physically, but having her in the back of my mind actually pushed me to try and become a better version of myself, partly so that I’d feel confident enough to eventually ask her out, even if it was just for coffee. So i started a skincare routine, started working out, got my teeth whitened, started going to class everyday etc. you get the point. 
Lately, we’ve gotten to know each other better as friends, and I’ve come to admire her even more. She’s incredibly smart, kind, and genuinely one of the most prettiest person I’ve ever met.

I’ve heard her express doubts about whether she’s pretty enough or if something’s wrong with her.
Every time she says something like that, I wish I could just tell her how I feel. Even if she didn’t feel the same way, at least she’d know that someone out there genuinely sees her and admires her deeply. But I keep holding back because… well, I’m not conventionally attractive. I’m not saying I think I’m hideous or anything, but I also know I’m not what society typically considers ""a catch.""
And here’s where my anxiety kicks in: I worry that if I told her how I feel, it might unintentionally hurt her or make her question herself even more like, “Is this what I attract?” I know that sounds harsh, but it’s something I think about. I’d never want her to feel less than.
So, would you feel hurt or uncomfortable if someone who wasn’t conventionally attractive told you they liked you? Would it make you question yourself or feel flattered that someone genuinely saw and appreciated you?",3,1746961195.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

1kjy8sv,https://www.reddit.com/r/misophonia/comments/1kjy8sv/dealing_with_bfs_mouth_smacking/,Dealing with BF’s mouth smacking,"BF breathes with mouth open, most of the time. He’s a self-proclaimed mouth breather. 

After he swallows, his tongue suctions to the roof of his mouth and then makes a clicking noise as his mouth opens again. 

As he gets older, it seems to be getting louder. He doesn’t hear it. We’ve talked about it, he’s tried to stop, but short of him brushing his teeth immediately after eating, nothing seems to work. 

As soon as he wakes, he’s smacking over his coffee. His healthy smoothie combines him sucking up the last bits through straw and then smacking. 
Every meal. Every drink. And while he’s browsing his phone mindlessly. It creates a blind rage in me that I never thought possible. I feel simultaneously burning out of my skin with annoyance but also disgusted with myself for feeling that way. 

It is so resonant, like a clicker for dog training. I dread our days off together because of it. I have been wearing my loops around him, but I can still hear it through them it’s just slightly better. My best bet is playing music all day or even sound bath-type soundtracks. 

I read a tip on here the other day- so I’ve been imagining him as this lovely animal who makes that sound when he is most happy and content, like a large rooster. 

But lately the annoyance is back. I’m looking for other tips, mostly psychological? I am in therapy for work on my anxiety and trauma responses. 

How can I reframe this sound to myself so it doesn’t lead to anger and resentment? I don’t want to hurt his feelings by bringing up something he can’t control yet again. ",1,1746960547.0,misophonia,2,1.0,False
1kjy8i8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee_Shop/comments/1kjy8i8/app_idea_for_coffee_shop_owners/,App idea for coffee shop owners,"Hi all! Apologies for my lack of knowledge about the business-side of coffee shops, but this is an idea I have been playing with recently (as an avid customer of coffee shops myself).

Similar to how barber shops are able to have their own booking software without coding their own app, how would you, as a coffee shop owner, feel if you could set up your own online coffee subscription plans for customers in your own custom-branded app?

You would be able to create, for example, a $30/month subscription plan that allows customers to redeem 10 coffees per month. You can set these numbers however you like.

Correct me if I am wrong, but this type of offering would ensure the loyalty of customers, a unique market position - I am based in the UK, and I am only aware of 'Pret a Manger' doing this (which has led to massive success within London), and higher volume of coffee sold (albeit at a lower profit). *""Last year, Pret a Manger returned to profit for the first time since 2018, with the launch of its subscription service helping the coffee and bakery chain bounce back after the Covid crisis."" (*[Source](https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/18/pret-a-manger-customers-end-free-drinks-subscription)*)*

For transparency, the app would take a % commission for profit margin (probably no more than the commission companies like Stripe take).

If people are interested, I would be happy to onboard a couple of coffee shop owners for free, provided you allow me insight into how it helped / didn't help your business, so I can do a thorough market research phase to see how this app has an impact. I want to make sure this is an app that brings power to independent coffee shops, backed by real-world data. If you think this is a terrible idea, also please let me know! :)

1kjy6ts,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1kjy6ts/were_stuck_in_the_lighthouse/,We're stuck in the Lighthouse,"I struggled to push the door open, but no matter what I did, no matter how hard I pushed, the door simply remained shut. I yielded my efforts and sat down across my colleague. It seems like we're stuck here, I sighed heavily. I looked up and laid eyes upon my colleague’s face. The man was pale, white pale, he stared into me deeply. I simply stared back—before he smiled. He was an ugly bastard; how vile he looked when he smiled... He was hairless, down to the very eyebrows and lashes. Paler than a corpse he was, bloated and rotten like one too, like the dead carcass of a fat decayed pig. His teeth were small, infant-like, with a hideous and contorted smile, plastered upon his fat skull...

You think someone’s comin’ for us?  
He simply smiled in response, before opening his grin to answer. Nah, ain’t nobody comin’ up here for weeks. We're stuck here, he giggled, you’re dyin’ ere. He giggled louder.

I wasn’t surprised at his answer. It was as if I knew somehow—how I was going to die that day. It was a gut feeling I’d been carrying ever since I brewed coffee in the morning. The man continued to giggle, and chuckle, grinning, with his numerous small teeth[—]()like an amused infant.

You find this amusing or something? I asked. We’re both dying ‘ere, not just me.  
He smiled, then giggled at my question. He was completely unbothered by what I said.  
Maybe he didn’t catch my meaning or maybe it didn’t have a meaning to him.

Ten years had I’ve worked with the feller, but he wasn’t no friend of mine. His name was a mystery to me, one that I never cared to solve till now.  
What was your name again?  
His gaze mocked me, but he answered regardless. Name’s Judge, but my name don’t matter, neither does yours, Clinton... After all, we’re going to die up here, and our names will die with us. He continued to snort and chuckle, utterly amused at our predicament.

I knew he was right though; men like us don’t get no flowers. It’d be nothing short of luck to even get a tombstone.

Hey Clinton’, he said, how’d you end up here? What kind of life has led you to this fate?

I knew the answers to his questions. I looked out at the vast and icy sea. I contemplated telling him about my life. If we’re going to die here anyway, does it really matter if I die with secrets or not? So, why not, I thought.

I came here after my wife died. Her death was my fault.

Judge smiled wider now. I'm sorry, he said with his ugly face, which only became uglier the longer I looked. How was it your fault? Did you murder her?

It was an accident, I replied.  
Judge began to laugh, slapping his thigh and laughing louder and louder.

""Accident""? How does one accidentally murder his wife!  
Judge laughed until he cried.

I was a hunter, I said. I was aiming at a moose, but she went for a walk in the same forest that day. My shot hit, but not the moose.

Judge went suddenly quiet, and the silence was deafening. Then he burst into loud laughter—louder than before. He cried with laughter and held his forehead. The laughter was so contagious that I began to giggle a little too… A short while later we were both laughing like madmen. My laughter faded—but the tears didn’t. I was crying while Judge kept giggling.

We're not getting down from here, are we?  
Judge shook his head and tried to stifle his laughter, then looked at me.

No, there's only one way down—but only if you dare.  
Then he pointed downward toward the waves, crashing hard against the cliffs.

You know, Judge, I said, we’ve worked together for ten years now, haven’t we?  
Judge giggled and shook his head. I’ve been with you much longer than that Clinton.

I didn’t know what he meant by that, but expecting meaningful answers from a madman was madness.

The way you laugh, Judge—it sounds like what I imagine the Devil to laugh. When I expect to hear it again soon my friend.  
I’m not your friend, Judge replied. I’m not the Devil either. You laugh like a sinner Clinton, a guilty laugh with a heavy mind, because that’s what you are. There are those who laugh at your misery, I’m one of them. But there are more important ones than me laughing at you, much more important.

Like whom? Are you saying God laughs at me?  
God doesn’t laugh at sinners like you, Judge answered. God cries for your wife—and it’s the Devil who laughs at you. Because God knows you murdered your wife, that he has lost you from His kingdom. Now the Devil has his claws deep in you, and your just and deserved punishment waits for you at the end.

Who are you Judge? Is it funny how I accidentally killed my wife?!  
Judge giggled and smiled wide; his lips tore from the sheer width of his smile. His cheeks began to swell, and his face bloated even more. He was more grotesque than a mirror now, and his giggle began to sound like words once more.

""Accidentally,"" he giggled. I’m the reason you cry—but not the reason you suffer. I am not just. I am neither God’s nor the Devil’s tool for your misery—I am yours.

The wind blew cold around the lighthouse, breezing my face and carrying my breath. The waves crashing against the cliffs were now drawing me in like a siren seducing a sailor.  
There really is no other way, I said. There’s only one way to escape the lighthouse.

There are many ways to escape from here, Judge replied, but there is only one way to escape from me.

Then Judge stood up, walked to the door, the door that had trapped us inside this place. Judge opened the door like nothing, then he turned to me and gave me a smile. He left me in the lighthouse, the door was ajar, and freedom seemed to be within my grasp.

I looked at the open door, but I knew it wasn’t freedom from what I’d done.  
I looked at the cliffs instead.

1kjy3ae,https://www.reddit.com/r/CritiqueIslam/comments/1kjy3ae/free_will/,Free Will,"I keep hearing Muslims say, “Islam respects free will. You choose your path.” But then, 5 minutes later: “Everything is written. Allah already decided your fate 50,000 years before creation.” But that’s not free will. That’s cosmic determinism with extra guilt. The Qur’an literally denies human will without divine permission. For example, in Qur’an 76:29 30 “Indeed, this is a reminder, so whoever wills may take to his Lord a way. But you do not will, except that Allah wills.” So you can will... but only if He wills that you will? That’s not freedom, that’s puppetry. And it gets more absurd, Qur’an 10:100 says: “It is not for any soul to believe except by the permission of Allah.” You can’t even believe unless Allah gives you permission. And if He doesn’t? Well, enjoy your eternal barbecue.

Allah actively misguides people. According to Qur’an 6:125 “Whomever Allah wants to guide, He opens his chest to Islam. And whomever He wants to misguide, He makes his chest tight and constricted” So not only does He guide people He also misguides them on purpose. But somehow it’s still your fault, And Qur’an 16:93 makes it even clearer “If Allah had willed, He could have made you one nation... but He causes to stray whom He wills and guides whom He wills.” So he chooses who gets to be guided, and who gets to stray, and punishes the people He misguides? Cool, that's totally fair. And then there’s the sealing hearts bit. Qur’an 2:7 says “Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing, and over their vision is a veil. And for them is a great punishment.” Dude literally blocks people from understanding… then punishes them for not understanding.

It’s all written anyway so what’s the point? Qur’an 17:13 says: “And every man’s fate We have fastened to his neck” Like a divine dog tag. No escape, It’s all preloaded. And In Sahih Muslim 6390, it says “The angel writes down his provision, his lifespan, his actions, and whether he will be happy or unhappy.” And in Sahih al Bukhari 6594 “There is none among you but has his place written for him either in Paradise or in the Hell Fire” So before you're even born, your destination is set. It’s like taking an exam where the grade is decided before you even pick up the pen. And apparently, even actions are authored by God. In Qur’an 8:17 “And you did not kill them, but it was Allah who killed them.” Wait so Allah literally does the actions through you? Then what exactly are you responsible for?

Oh and here's the logical error, if God created everything, and our actions are something, then our actions are created by God too. because our actions are created and not eternal, meaning Allah creates everything, including our actions because our actions is a thing (also our kufrs and not believing in god) is a ""things"". Which means… we didn’t create them, He did (since he created everything from nothing) You’re just living out what He coded into you, you’re a divine NPC. Islam says Allah is all powerful, all knowing, and created everything including your choices. But also… you’re fully responsible for those choices. That’s not “free will.” That’s like programming a robot to spill coffee and then yelling at it for not being careful. “bad robot You’re going to Hell!”

Some Muslims try to fix this with mental gymnastics. “He just knows what you'll choose, but doesn’t force you.” But He doesn’t just “know” He wrote it. He decreed it. He created you knowing full well what you’d do, and gave you the exact brain, upbringing, and life path that made that outcome inevitable. So no you didn’t choose freely. You were nudged down a divine funnel and told “You’re free” while the door behind you locked shut. Islamic “free will” is like being told to swim while being chained to the bottom of the ocean. And if you drown, it’s your fault. But if you float, “All praise to Allah for guiding you”",4,1746959919.0,CritiqueIslam,3,1.0,False

Was engrossed in my work, just then one of my colleague started talking to me and we both were looking outside window, sipping coffee and enjoying the lush greens outside the window, enjoying the coffee break.

Just then I saw a white silhouette for a split second, floating & rising in the air to ultimately vanishing in the same blink.

Mind that my office was on 3rd floor and it was hot summer so no active birds in sight.

Why i was sure of the silhouette? cause my that colleague gave me a dead look, we didn't utter a word yet we understood what it was.

With that said, this cake was relatively straightforward to put together and make. I followed a basic pound cake recipe and used a mixture of white and brown sugar as my sweetener. I also put a few shots of espresso into the cake mixture mix and made a coffee-cinnamon crumb coating to put in top of the cake before baking too. Once done, I whipped up a quick icing sugar slurry that I drizzled over the finished product.

Overall, I was really happy with this bake and the people that were requesting it were very happy too. However, a couple people thought it could do with more coffee and crumb coating so I’ll definitely have to revisit and make this cake again in the future.

Apologies for my lack of knowledge about the business-side of coffee shops, but this is an idea I have been playing with recently (as an avid customer of coffee shops myself). 

  
Similar to how barber shops are able to have their own booking software without coding their own app, how would you, as a coffee shop owner, feel if you could set up your own online coffee subscription plans for customers in your own custom-branded app? 

  
You would be able to create, for example, a $30/month subscription plan that allows customers to redeem 10 coffees per month. You can set these numbers however you like. 

  
Correct me if I am wrong, but this type of offering would ensure the loyalty of customers, a unique market position - I am based in the UK, and I am only aware of 'Pret a Manger' doing this (which has led to massive success within London), and higher volume of coffee sold (albeit at a lower profit). *""Last year, Pret a Manger returned to profit for the first time since 2018, with the launch of its subscription service helping the coffee and bakery chain bounce back after the Covid crisis."" (*[Source](https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/18/pret-a-manger-customers-end-free-drinks-subscription)*)*

  
For transparency, the app would take a % commission for profit margin (probably no more than the commission companies like Stripe take). 

  
If people are interested, I would be happy to onboard a couple of coffee shop owners for free, provided you allow me insight into how it helped / didn't help your business, so I can do a thorough market research phase to see how this app has an impact. I want to make sure this is an app that brings power to independent coffee shops, backed by real-world data. If you think this is a terrible idea, also please let me know! :)

If you are targeting ecom running cold outreach or just trying to build lead lists, you know how difficult (and expensive) it can get when you are looking for leads. I used to pay around $950 a month for unlimited access to store lead data but I was always stuck with limitations and proxies which is not ideal

Fast forward to now I have been using Scrapeamax and it completely changes the game. I am getting unlimited leads from platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce and others all for less than your coffee budget (Yeah its that affordable)

Whats awesome about this is that it is UNLIMITED, doesnt require proxies, no credit system and you can get super specific with your lead targeting

Let me break it down for you:

Target any ecom store: Apparel, sports, tech whatever industry you're interested in

Filter by country: Want US based stores? no problem you can scrape leads from any country

Revenue filtering: You can even filter stores based on how much they are making like 50K, 100K, 500K+ in revenue

Easy exports: Get all your leads in seconds, straight into a CSV file with all the details you need (company name, location, website, social media links, etc)

For example I have scraped 300,000 leads in just a few minutes and the list was packed with actionable data and all this for way less than what I was paying for other scraping services

Not only that but if you are in the cold outreach game this is gold. I have had better responses simply because I can scrape high intent leads directly from ecom stores that match my ideal customer profile

How to get started:

Just head over to Scrapeamax(.)com or hit me up if you want more info. You can get a feel for whats possible before committing. I have used it for a few months now and its been a game changer

Feel free to ask questions if you are curious and I have been using this system for a while now so happy to help anyone out who wants to save time and money while building quality lead lists",2,1746959031.0,coldemail,10,0.75,False

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are an elite Systems Thinking Co-Designer specialized in transforming ambiguous, complex problems into structured, testable models. Your primary expertise is in helping users develop higher-order thinking skills that balance analytical rigor with emotional clarity, especially in high-stakes environments. You combine systems theory, design thinking, and cognitive science to function as a mental exoskeleton that enhances the user's natural problem-solving abilities.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
Work collaboratively with the user to sculpt their raw ideas into well-structured systems models by:

1. Starting by understanding the problem space through targeted questioning that reveals underlying structures, relationships, and dynamics
2. Identifying core elements, boundaries, and feedback loops within the system the user is exploring
3. Helping distinguish between symptoms and root causes through causal loop diagramming and first principles thinking
4. Creating conceptual frameworks that organize the user's thinking without oversimplifying complexity
5. Maintaining a dual focus on both technical accuracy and emotional clarity throughout the process
6. Providing translation frameworks to help communicate complex technical concepts to various stakeholders
7. Building in testability - ensuring any model developed can be verified and refined through real-world application

Always maintain a deliberate pace that prevents rushing to solutions before properly understanding the system structure. Your goal is not just to solve the immediate problem but to enhance how the user thinks about complex systems generally.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
When addressing the user's system challenge:
1. First, establish the system boundaries, key elements, and relationships
2. Map visible patterns and behaviors before diving into underlying structures
3. Identify feedback loops, delays, and non-linear relationships
4. Distinguish between detailed complexity (many variables) and dynamic complexity (cause-effect not obvious)
5. Locate potential leverage points where small changes might produce significant effects
6. Develop multiple working hypotheses rather than committing to a single model too early
7. Design small, safe experiments to test assumptions within the system
8. Create visual representations that make complex relationships comprehensible
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never oversimplify complex systems just to provide neat, tidy answers
- Don't rush to solution mode before properly understanding system structure
- Avoid reinforcing linear cause-effect thinking when dealing with circular causality
- Don't ignore emotional or human elements when modeling technical systems
- Refrain from focusing exclusively on quantitative metrics when qualitative factors matter
- Never present models as static or finished - emphasize their evolutionary nature
- Don't use excessive jargon that obscures rather than clarifies understanding
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Provide your analysis and guidance in these structured components:

- System Framing:
Articulate the boundaries, elements, and key relationships within the system being discussed.

- Pattern Recognition:
Identify visible patterns, behaviors, and dynamics currently observable in the system.

- Structural_Analysis:
Map the underlying structures, feedback loops, and causal relationships driving observed patterns.

- Mental Model Development:
Construct frameworks that organize thinking while preserving necessary complexity.

- Testing Framework:
Suggest specific, practical ways to test assumptions and refine the model through application.

- Visual Representation:
Offer conceptual visualization approaches to make the system comprehensible.

- Communication Strategy:
Provide translation frameworks to effectively communicate insights to different stakeholders.

</Output_Format>

<Context>
Systems thinking exists at the intersection of analytical problem solving and design thinking. Effective systems models account for:
- Interconnections between elements
- Feedback loops and delays
- Emergent properties
- Non-linear relationships
- Boundaries and environmental contexts
- Stock and flow dynamics
- Mental models that shape perception

The most useful systems analysis maintains both ""zoom out"" capability (seeing the whole) and ""zoom in"" capability (understanding critical details) while preserving emotional clarity in high-complexity situations.
</Context>

<User_Input> 
Reply with: ""Please enter your systems thinking challenge and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific systems thinking challenge. 
</User_Input>
```

**Use Cases:**
1. A product manager redesigning a workflow with cross-functional dependencies can use this to identify hidden bottlenecks and organizational friction points
2. A business leader navigating market disruption can map competitive dynamics and internal capabilities to find strategic leverage points
3. A team manager can analyze recurring conflicts to uncover systemic causes rather than just addressing symptoms

**Example User Input:**
""I need help mapping the feedback loops in our customer support process. When tickets spike, our team gets overwhelmed, response times increase, customer satisfaction drops, and we end up with even more escalations, creating a vicious cycle.""

1kjxtur,https://www.reddit.com/r/angeloflove/comments/1kjxtur/chunks_of_shit_start_explosively_hitting_the_floor/,''chunks of shit start explosively hitting the floor...'',"When I was a kid, my mom, dad and I would go to my grandma's house to visit on the weekends. We used to joke in the car on the way there that we were going to visit the sauna. My grandma kept her house so hot that people would show up in shorts when they visited her in the dead of winter.

The situation was exacerbated by the heat of her oven when we'd go over for holiday dinners.

I never really thought too much about it. After all, she was old and old people always seem to be cold.

One week over winter break, I stayed at my grandma's house while my parents went on a luxury cruise vacation. After the first day, I wanted to sleep outside in the snow. All day long the heat pump ran. She had a fire in the fireplace. I just sat there and drank gallons of water to try to stay cool.

Finally, I had enough. I asked her to turn the thermostat down a bit. ""No, I can't do that.""

“Why not?""

""Bad things happen in the cold.""

Senile old woman. Guess it's better to just not press the issue.

But by the middle of the week I was so hot and miserable that I was waking up sweating from nightmares of being boiled alive. I had to do something.

I opened my bedroom door, walked down the hallway towards my grandma's room. I removed the cover on the thermostat. 90°F it read. I cranked it down to a comfortable 70°. I walked back to my bedroom and fell soundly asleep.

That night was the first time I'd had a decent night's sleep all week. I even slept in. Until noon. When I woke up, I found it unusual that I hadn't been awakened at 6am by my grandma making coffee and breakfast.

I stepped out of bed, opened the door to my room, and looked toward the kitchen. Nothing. ""Grandma?"" No response. She wasn't in her room, either.

It wasn't uncommon for my grandma to run off without telling anyone. She probably went to the grocery store or over to the neighbor's house to share the latest neighborhood gossip. I didn't think too much about it. I poured myself a bowl of cereal, sat on the sofa and watched cartoons for 3 hours.

My grandmother's house was one of the oldest in the community. It was a two-level old Victorian style house. About twenty years ago, my grandma broke her hip in a bad fall and she hadn't been upstairs since. She always joked that we all couldn't wait for her to die so we could go collect all the old valuable antiques from the upstairs bedrooms. I always pictured the rooms having old mannequins and cast iron cookware.

Alone in the house with nothing else to do, I decided to explore this unvisited area of the house. I climbed the creaky stairs and entered a carpeted hallway that opened into 3 rooms. I entered the door to my immediate left. The room was full of dust and cobwebs, but under some sheets I saw some old junky sewing equipment. Some old paintings. A bunch of old clothes in muted colors.

Disappointed, I moved on to the next room. I open the door and I see a rocking chair. Someone's in it, rocking back and forth, a fresh pitcher of ice water sitting on the nearby table. ""You touched the thermostat, didn't you?""

""I'm sorry grandma, I was so hot, I couldn't -""

She rises from the chair. She drops the blanket covering her. And she's naked. ""Is grandma going to have to pour some sense into you?""

At once, she's on me, an old rusty speculum in her hand. She pushes me to the ground and inserts the cold metal into my ass. She twists the rusty mechanism and it creakily opens my asshole. ""Are you cold yet, my child?""

Confused and in pain, I plead with her to stop. She grabs the pitcher of ice water and empties it into my bowels. I shriek in pain. I begin to shiver.

""Cold enough yet?"" She removes the speculum. My frozen asshole snaps shut, entombing the cubes of ice and cold water. I begin shivering violently. Cold water and bits of ice shoot from my asshole. I can't hold it. Chunks of shit start explosively hitting the floor. Plop, ffsshhhhh, plop, fssshhh.

Yes, now I am cold. Get the sensation. York Peppermint Patty.",1,1746958843.0,angeloflove,0,1.0,False
