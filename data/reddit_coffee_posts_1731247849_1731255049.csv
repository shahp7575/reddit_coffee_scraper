1go4049,https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomAmazonReviews/comments/1go4049/finally_found_the_perfect_braided_rug_for_my/,Finally found the perfect braided rug for my living room! [Review],"Hey everyone! Just wanted to share my experience with this 8 by 10 braided rug I got from Super Area Rugs on Amazon. After weeks of searching for the perfect rug (and driving my partner crazy with endless options), I finally pulled the trigger on this one, and I couldn't be happier.

First off, can we talk about the quality? I was honestly skeptical about ordering a woven rug 8x10 online - we all know how those ""looks great in photos"" things usually turn out. But this one actually exceeded my expectations. It's handmade in the USA, which was a nice surprise given the price point (paid $134, which feels like a steal now).

The braided area rug 8x10 I got is in Spruce Green with natural multi-colors woven through it. The photos online are pretty accurate, but it looks even better in person. The colors are rich but not overwhelming - think forest vibes but make it living room friendly. I love how the different shades (light green, dark green, with hints of rust and beige) catch the light differently throughout the day.

Find a more detailed review here [https://athometouch.com/8-by-10-braided-rugs/](https://athometouch.com/8-by-10-braided-rugs/)

Some practical stuff you might want to know:

\- It's reversible! This basically means double the lifespan, which is pretty sweet

\- Super easy to clean (I have two cats and a clumsy partner who spills coffee regularly)

\- Works both inside and outside (though mine's staying firmly in the living room)

\- The braided oval rugs 8x10 size fits perfectly in my space without overwhelming it

What surprised me the most?

\- The thickness is just right - not too flat, not too bulky

\- It doesn't shed like my last rug

\- The edges lay flat right out of the box (anyone who's dealt with curling rug corners knows this is a big deal)

One thing to note - if you're looking at the 8 x 10 braided area rugs from this brand, they come in several colors. I spent way too long debating between this and the charcoal version, but I'm glad I went with the Spruce Green. It adds just the right amount of color without being too ""look at me!""

The only tiny con? The new rug smell took about a week to completely disappear, but that's pretty standard with new rugs.

here are few images I took:

Should I give up. ,"Hi all, I’m new to Reddit so apologies if this isn’t the right place to post this. I (24F) am currently a grad student that just started my third year. I moved to this new city and school when I started my PhD program so making some friends and surviving grad school has been the main priority, and it’s been super tough so far. Now that I’m in my third year I finally feel like I have a little bit more a handle on things and am in a place where I can realistically see myself getting into a relationship. I’m getting a little ahead of myself here. I am someone who can get a crush at the drop of a hat and they’re generally harmless and I keep it close to the chest (for me to even tell a friend is a big deal). Crushes generally come and go for me, but I’ve had a fairly consistent crush on one of the other grad students in my program. He is a bit ahead of me, he was a third year when I was a first year. I’ve never done anything about it for a plethora of reasons (not wanting to get rejected, not wanting to make the vibe in the department weird (my subgroup in the department is rather small so anything bad would make a big impact) etc). I feel like I’ve been telling myself over the past few months to just let it go bc it’ll never happen and be probably doesn’t like me (I.e. he would have probably done something by now if he did). Recently, after hearing some therapist advice, I decided it does me no good to just sit here alone with it without acting on any of it. So I asked him to grab a drink/coffee last weekend and we did. We went to a local place and had a nice conversation for about 2hours over drinks. This entire process was nerve wracking enough, and I thought it’d be the final nail in the coffin of whether there was something there or if I would get the definitive no I needed to actually move on. Getting drinks was never explicitly a date though. I just asked to grab drinks we never defined it. And while it gave me hope in the moment, nothing has changed since then. We haven’t made any additional plans. Is it time to just force myself to give up and try to move on? What should I do next? Happy to give more insight if you guys have questions. I’d love any advice.

First, Karens on TikTok and Instagram kicked off the 4B movement, refusing to marry, have children, date, or have relationships with men. They started wearing blue bracelets and getting blue heart tattoos to recognize each other in public as Harris voters, and this soon evolved into the MATGA movement. WTAF?!!

Comments: Feminism is a cult.

  
These women should be put on a list and if ANY man dies around them, they should be charged. Where the live, where they work, where the play.

“If I were married to you, I’d put poison in your coffee,” Lady Astor once famously remarked to Winston Churchill. “If I were married to you,” he replied, “I’d drink it.”

If this type of video had been posted in 2020 to be used against liberals, YouTube would have shut it down immediately.

Yup. But I don't want it shut down. I want these wackos to expose their crazy agenda themselves. Saves us the time and effort.

I met Noah when I was fourteen, and he was sixteen—a boy with a crooked smile, a gentle voice, and eyes that seemed to see me in a way no one else had. We were young, and love was something new and thrilling, an adventure we thought would last forever. He had a kindness that wrapped around me like a warm summer day, the kind of warmth that could make you feel like you were home no matter where you stood.

Our friends would laugh at how we were always together, whispering under the stars, walking barefoot through fields, or talking about anything and everything. He was good to me in a way that went beyond words. I’d never known anyone so sincere, so endlessly patient. Every look felt like a promise, and for a while, I believed I could hold onto him forever.

But then came whispers, those poisonous little seeds planted by a friend I thought I could trust. She saw the way I loved him and how he loved me, and with a sly grin and a calculating look, she started filling my head with doubts. “You know, he’s just a boy,” she’d say, her voice low and full of insinuation. “Boys only want one thing, you know that, right?” I shook my head, but she just leaned in closer, her words dripping with venom. “He’ll get what he wants and leave. Don’t be naive, don’t let him make a fool out of you.”

The more she spoke, the more the trust I’d built began to crack. I saw things in his words that I’d never noticed before, started questioning his intentions and every gentle touch. Instead of asking him, instead of trusting him, I let her words poison what we had. I let suspicion take root in my heart until all I could see were shadows and doubts.

One night, without explanation, without letting him defend himself, I ended things. He tried to reach out, his voice raw and pleading, but I didn’t listen. I didn’t think twice. I left him standing there, his face pale, his eyes wide with confusion and hurt. And that friend of mine? She spread every detail around our small town, twisting the story until it sounded like something ugly, something cruel. Soon, everyone knew, and the gentle boy I’d loved turned cold. Noah avoided me after that, and when he did look at me, his eyes were filled with a mixture of sadness and anger that cut deeper than any words could.

I threw myself into the next thing that came along, thinking I’d moved on, thinking I’d find someone who’d fill the hollow place Noah left behind. It didn’t take long before I fell for someone else. This boy, though—he was nothing like Noah. He had words that were sweet on the surface but sharp underneath. His promises came easily but never lasted. And I, so desperate to feel that spark again, ignored the way his words left bruises on my heart. I clung to him, hoping he’d change, that maybe he’d turn out to be someone better, kinder. But in the end, he broke my heart in the same way I’d broken Noah’s.

When he left, I was left shattered, picking up the pieces of what I thought I knew about love. It was then, standing in the ruins of that second heartbreak, that I realized the weight of what I’d done to Noah. How I’d let someone else’s words cloud my vision, how I’d hurt someone who’d only ever been good to me.

With my heart in my throat and regret hanging heavy, I reached out to him, to Noah, hoping he’d listen. I wanted to tell him how sorry I was, to explain that I’d been wrong, that I’d been a fool. I found him in that same old place we used to meet, and when he looked at me, I saw the walls he’d built to protect himself.

“I don’t know if you’ll ever forgive me,” I began, my voice breaking. “I was stupid and young, and I let someone else tell me who you were. I never should have doubted you. I let you go, and I know I broke something we can’t ever get back.”

He listened, silent, his expression unreadable, and when I was done, he nodded, a slow, careful nod. “I forgave you a long time ago,” he said softly, his voice steady but guarded. “But forgiveness doesn’t mean everything can go back to how it was. I thought you were my forever, and you threw that away without a second thought.”

I looked at him, feeling the weight of his words settled in my chest. But I couldn’t let go, not again. “I don’t expect you to forget, but I wish you’d let me show you how much I’ve changed, how much I’ve learned. I was stupid, and I was wrong, but I’m here now. If there’s any chance we can make this work, I want it. I want you. I’ll be better—I promise.”

He looked away, his gaze falling to the ground, and for a moment, I thought he’d turn me away. But then he sighed, a long, weary sigh, and looked back up at me. “I don’t know if I can give you that chance right now,” he said. “But maybe, someday.”

It wasn’t the answer I wanted, but it was more than I deserved. I knew then that some things take time, that forgiveness isn’t a quick fix, and that love isn’t always enough to heal every wound. But as I walked away that day, I carried a sliver of hope, that maybe, just maybe, time would soften the edges of our past and leave room for a new beginning. 

A few months later, we crossed paths again. This time, there was something different in the way Noah looked at me—a warmth, a quiet intensity, as if I were the only girl in the room, the only one he saw. His eyes sparkled, alive with a light I hadn’t seen in so long, and in their reflection, I could see myself, the way I’d been back then, young and full of hope.

Every time our eyes met, I felt those same butterflies, that same thrill I’d felt when we first fell in love. But with every passing second, the feelings were stronger, deeper, and I knew that what I felt for him had only grown. And yet, even with that spark in his eyes, there was a distance in him, a hesitancy that felt like a wall between us.

Finally, as we were about to part, I gathered the courage and asked, “Maybe when you’re back in town, we could grab a coffee sometime?” My heart was pounding, waiting for his answer, and a million possibilities swirled in my mind.

He paused, and then, with a soft smile, nodded. “Yeah,” he said, “I’d like that.”

It wasn’t a promise, but it was something—a chance. And in that moment, I realized that maybe, just maybe, our story wasn’t over yet.

Every Dutch Bros I’ve been to has always had a sign that says pick the shortest line, and that is what I have always done and never had a problem. Today, one of the lines was backed up into the parking lot so I chose the other line that was shorter. Apparently that pissed people off because four cars went by and did not let me merge, and a man physically got out of his car, came up to me and started yelling at me for not going to the back of the line. When I pointed to the sign and explained that I picked the shorter line as I was supposed to, he mocked me and continued yelling until I drove away, without my coffee.

Should I be getting in the longer line, or using the empty line? Like I said, I’ve never ever had a problem using the shorter line but apparently I pissed off a lot of people today.

I'm looking to upgrade my grinder. I currently have the Breville BCG820BSS I had for free from a friend. I'm mostly drink espresso and Latte. I'm considering the follow grinder and I believe that anything listed below will be an upgrade from what I have right now. Note that I'm based in Canada so anything in US a a bit more expensive considering the currency. I have a Lelit Marax v2. 

Timemore 064s : 679$ cad
Timemore 078s : 999$ cad
I like the design and the small form factor. Also the fact that its is less noisy. Just nore sure if the upgrade from the 64 to the 78 is worth for the money. Also, I heard a lot that it require a lot of seasoning. 

Turin DF64 Gen 2: 550$ cad
Heard great thing around it but some people complain on the build quality. The design is less nicer and a lot more noisy. 

Eureka Mignon Specialita: From espresso coffee shop should be around 600$ cad
I like the design but there is no retention. 

Niche Duo: A little bit more than 1000$ cad
So far seem a great grinder but a bit more expensive. 

This what I was looking for but if you have other recommendation feel free to post your suggestion. Right now I'm more inclined for the Timemore.

1go3rg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1go3rg7/i_inherited_my_grandmothers_lakeside_house_but/,"I inherited my grandmothers lakeside house, but she never properly warned me.","My grandmother, when she was alive, lived on an old farm on the side of a hill in a remote village in northern Sweden, right next to a beautiful lake surrounded by mountains. Whenever we were there, we would spend all day swimming or fishing for perch and crayfish. Grandmother was however always very assertive that we must never get out on the lake during the night, though she never gave us any reason. I always assumed she worried that something would happen while no one was around to help.

Of course, time passes, and last year so did my grandmother. My grandfather died when I was very young, so my grandmothers passing left the house empty, and neither my mother nor any of her siblings were interested in moving out to the middle of nowhere. I, on the other hand, work remotely most of the time, and even though I don't really expect to work the land, the solitude sounded quite appealing. Along with the house itself, I inherited furniture, a tractor, some old farming equipment, and, of course, the small wooden rowing boat we would use whenever we were visiting.

I had a single neighbour, a strange old man named Lennart, who lived in a small cottage further up the hill across the road from me. He mostly liked to keep to himself, but I had offered to let him use the boat if he wanted to do some fishing, and to help out with clearing snow during the winter.

One night after I had finally settled in, and was mostly unpacked, I stood by the window in my bedroom looking out over the lake. The moon was peaking out over the mountain opposite, and cast a beautiful glow on the still water. Suddenly, I was reminded of my grandmothers warnings not to go out on the lake during the night. Curiosity got the better of me, and I made my way down to the boat house.

As I made my way down to the lake, I heard footsteps, and a voice calling out behind me. Startled, I turned around to see Lennart. He seemed flustered and asked me, almost accusingly, why I was going down to the boat house at this hour. Confused, and a little annoyed at his sudden intrusion, I told him that I felt like taking the boat out for a little midnight trip since this was such a beautiful night. He insisted that going out on the lake during the night was unsafe! Had my grandmother not warned me?

In hindsight, I feel extremely childish about this, but his insistence just made me more motivated. I told him that I was fully aware of the risks of taking a boat out at night, but that I was a grown adult and capable of making my own decisions. Lennart grumbled, and I could tell that he was still very agitated, but he relented and with a grunt and a dismissive wave, started making his way back up the hill.

I pushed my boat out on the water and jumped in. The water was very still, and the combination of the moonlight, and almost complete absence of any sounds made for an incredibly soothing experience. I settled around the middle of the lake, perhaps 300 meters from the shore. At this point, I could see most of the houses in the village, and the neighbouring village. Looking over toward my house, I suddenly realised that Lennarts cottage was entirely dark. He usually had some lights on in the windows, so that was certainly odd, but I could only assume that he had blown a fuse. 

Around me, the stillness of the water was disturbed by bubbles. Before I knew it, the water was filled with frenzied activity, and with a lurch, the boat suddenly started moving back toward the shore. I was moving significantly faster than my rowing had taken me out onto the lake, and I was holding on for dear life. I worried I would crash into the boat house, but whatever pushed my boat along navigated it safely back to  the spot where I would normally keep it moored and it slid softly back on to land. I stood up, scared and confused, and looked around.

Three dark and bloated silhouettes emerged from the water. In the moonlight, they looked almost like soldiers in gillie suits, but they clearly wore no diving equipment. They approached swiftly, and grabbed me. The creatures smelled vaguely of fish and decaying vegetation, and they spoke in a language I could not comprehend. I managed to make out a single word that was repeated multiple times: ""mermolgard.""

They dragged me inside the boat house. One of them looked me dead into the eyes and covered my mouth as it made a gargled hushing sound. It's face was clearly not human, with bulging eyes without eyelids, two slits in place of a nose and no visible ears. I realised it was in fact not wearing anything. However, its leathery dark brown skin seemed to mimik the appearance of decaying leaves. Of course, I was scared nearly out of my mind at this point, but for some reason I didn't attempt to flee. The creatures seemed almost as scared as I was. So, I complied and kept quiet. They turned off the lights and settled down around me.

We waited in there for what felt like an eternity, but was most likely only a couple of minutes. The silence outside was suddenly broken by a loud splash and the sound of wood splintering. I could hear that something was emerging from the lake, followed by heavy, damp footsteps. From what I could tell, it seemed to be moving up the hill as the footsteps were getting more and more distant. As I sat in that boat house, my senses tuned to max by all of the adrenaline coursing through my body, the sounds of breaking glass and splintering wood reached us. Eventually the footsteps returned, and whatever had come after us out of the lake made its way back into the water.

A couple of minutes later, the three creatures that brought me into the boat house quietly exchanged a few words. The one that had hushed me earlier gestured that I was free to leave, and then they left. I could hear them going back into the water. I fell back against the wall and slid down to the floor as my adrenaline abated and the fear truly set in. I didn't move from that spot until the following morning.

My house looked like a crime scene. The front door, along with its frame, had been torn out of the wall and lay several meters away on my lawn. Most of my windows and furniture was in pieces, and pools of water dotted the floor throughout the house.

Lennart clearly knew more about the creatures that live in the lake. I resented that he hadn't been more forceful in stopping me from going out with the boat. However, logically I knew I wouldn't have believed him if he had started going on about monsters, and what was he supposed to do? Nevertheless, I marched over to his cottage and banged on the door until he eventually opened it. He seemed both surprised and relieved that I was standing there and he offered me a cup of coffee and an explanation.

The lake is inhabited by a creature known as Mermolgard and creatures known as the Vattnora. Generally, they live together in piece, but they have very different opinions on us humans. Lennart and my grandmother used to spend time with the Vattnora, and they understood some of their language. Their word for human roughly translates as ""foolish ones."" They say that humanity are not mature and they mostly settle with observing us. Mermolgard is an ancient creature that sleeps during the day and hunts at night. He is resentful of humanity for settling around his lake, eating his fish, and disturbing the darkness of the night with artificial lights.

I still live in my grandmothers old house, Lennart has promised to introduce me to the Vattnora, in their own time. I feel an obligation to thank them, and to protect others from Mermolgard. I will never go out on the lake during the night again, but I feel strangely safe to do so during the day.",2,1731254279.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

With his game face on, Zachary said, “Back to the meeting.” 

Sitting nearest to Zachary was his cousin, Callum. Among the cousins within the same age range as Zachary, Callum ranked second.

Callum drew close and whispered, “Zack, I overheard your conversation with Nana. Did you really marry that Ser- girl?”

Zachary shot him a glare. 

Scratching his nose, Callum straightened his back and ended the probing. 

Even so, Callum had nothing but sympathy for Zachary. 

There was no need for the York boys to secure social and financial standing through marriage, but Zack and his new bride were not a match in every single way. Poor Zack. He merely married the girl because Nana took a liking to her. 

Once again, Callum offered Zachary his deepest sympathy through his thoughts. 

Thank goodness Callum was not the oldest in the family. Otherwise, he would have to step up to the plate and marry Nana’s lifesaver. 

Unaware of all that, Serenity got the location details and was busy dragging her suitcase to get to her new home.

She opened the door only to step into a spacious house. The place was bigger and more decked out than her sister’s house. 

Putting down her suitcase, Serenity started by looking around the place. This was her home from now on. 

It had two living areas, four bedrooms, one kitchen, two bathrooms, and two balconies. Each space was broad and wide. Serenity estimated the entire house to be at least two thousand square feet. 

The place was barely furnished as there was only a sofa set with a coffee table, and a wine chiller in the living room. Two out of four bedrooms were equipped with a bed and wardrobe while the other two were empty. 

The master bedroom had en-suite facilities, complete with a walk-in closet, study, and bathroom. Despite the divided space, the master bedroom remained huge like the living hall. 

This must be Zachary’s space. 

Serenity chose to live in the other room with a bed. The sunlight that came from the balcony brightened up the room. There was a room in between the master bedroom and the bedroom Serenity chose. This way, the newlyweds could enjoy their personal space. 

Although they were married in the eyes of the law, Serenity would not propose spending time as a married couple unless Zachary asked for it. 

After dragging her suitcase to the bedroom, Serenity went into the kitchen. 

The kitchen was squeaky clean without kitchenware in sight. Both balconies were also bare but gave a roomy feeling due to the vast space. Serenity intended to spruce up the balcony with some plants and a swing. Nothing beat reading a book and taking in the botanic view on a swing during her free time. 

It appeared Zachary was rarely home for dinner. 

Now that she was occupying the space, home-cooked meals were a must. Serenity started with the kitchen by purchasing kitchen utensils online. As for plants on the balcony and other furniture, she wanted to get Zachary’s take on it when he got home from work. 

It was his house after all while she was simply crashing here. 

After placing an order on kitchen tools, Serenity looked at the time and needed to return to the shop. 

Picking up the keys, she grabbed her phone and rushed down the stairs. 

Serenity made it back to the shop in time for the afterschool rush. 

Her best friend, Jasmine, inquired out of concern. “What were you up to in the morning, Seren?” 

“My sister and brother-in-law have been in constant argument because of me. I thought about it and decided to move out.” Serenity shrugged. “So I moved out this morning.” 

Her best friend’s brother-in-law was something else. Jasmine sighed. “Men love to tell women that they would take care of them, but when it comes down to it, they’re the ones nagging and finding faults. After marriage, we, women, have to put family above all while grinning through misunderstandings. It’s so unfair. I think your sister should find a job! Women must always be financially independent so we have a say in the household.”

While speaking, Jasmine suddenly furrowed her brows and gave Serenity a confused look. “I can’t believe your sister let you move out.” 

“I got married.” 

“Oh… What? You got married? You don’t even have a boyfriend. Who did you marry?” Jasmine’s mindless nodding was ensued with shock as she stared at Serenity wide-eyed. Her voice went high-pitch too. 

Knowing that she could not keep the news from Jasmine, Serenity came clean about the whole thing. 

Jasmine glared at Serenity for a while before poking the latter’s forehead. “I don’t know where you find the guts to marry someone you met for the first time. You could’ve stayed with me if you couldn’t find a place. I have extra rooms at my place. You could’ve also picked my cousin if you were looking for a husband.”

My parents are separated (on extremely bad terms) and I live with my mom, my father and i haven’t talked in years and my bf is actually one of the very very few people in my life who’s aware of that. Inspite of knowing that, he made some comment saying i’m sure your dad’s house is empty and we could go there. I was baffled for a second and i was sure i heard something wrong and i asked him to repeat it- he said the same thing again. i felt a gulp in my throat and was frozen, how could someone so close to me make such an insensitive comment. i was so off atp but long story short, he kept saying sorry and somehow convinced me to stay.

We ended up booking a place for a couple of hours and went there. Again, he behaved really weirdly- kept asking me to suck him off, do stuff to him (which i’m completely fine with) but it just felt like we’re here for his pleasure and i felt extremely sidelined. i kept having to ask him to go down on me which is a kind of common occurrence cause idts he likes going down and i always have to point it out to him to do stuff to me as well. we barely had sex, he came, we cuddled a bit- i faced the other side for some time and he just suddenly went on his phone for like 20 minutes. i felt kind of bad but i tried to take his hand and put his fingers inside me but he just shirked off my hand saying his wrist hurts ???? i was so taken aback and just felt so fucking dejected and used cause we just stopped having sex in the middle because he came and he just had no consideration for me or my needs and when i was trying to start something he started giving excuses. i just started packing my stuff and threatened to leave but somehow AGAIN he convinced me to stay. 
we checked out and went home, i texted him later saying i felt really weird and incomplete after our thing today and he became extremely defensive, gaslighty and kept bringing random stuff up to change the topic- kept saying im accusing him of stuff, always complaining. i just backed out and felt it wasn’t worth bringing it up.

My first deck prototype had like 80 cards and some of them were really unsavory (do I really need a card for *Late*?) and wasn't in overall great. The second prototype had like 60 and once again some of them weren't making a lot of sense the more I thought about it. Because I don't like having so much stuff going on, I tried to reduce even more the amount of cards that were unnecessarily specific or I could fuse together and that's how (all roads lead to Rome) I ended in Lenormand again.

.  
Name still in progress.

Why changing Lenormand?

1. Because this is a personal deck, not a whole brand new revolution.
2. Lenormand is not ignorant to changes. It has substancial changes from the coffee ground pack it was inspired, we don't have the ""Green bush"" or ""Bugs"" cards and Scythe became more of a threat than the harvest and rewards of effort.
3. I really put my whole cartomanussy into reducing all my extra cards into the fewest possible number, based only in meanings already present in other fortune telling decks in order to respect its minimalist and conceptual identity.

# Minor changes:

My biggest problem with Lenormand is that it's too european. Of course that's not inherently that big of an issue, is more of a personal pet peeve but still, I want to change some cards to help me flow better:

1. The Fox **→** The Mask

I said it in the previous post but they basically carry the same core meanings (cunning, untrusty, falsehood, scheming, double-faced, etc). About the physical characteristics like ginger or the animalistic traits like hunter/thief the drawing of the mask itself will be fox-like so it's not thaaaat far away.

2. The Bear **→** The Lion

Before you jump from your seat, this used to be symbol in the card. Same meanings without the ones exclusive to Bear like hibernation.

[From The Diversions of the Court of Vienna: https:\/\/www.britishmuseum.org\/collection\/object\/P\_1982-U-4637-1-32. ](https://preview.redd.it/ptzqu9yf930e1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=2151977b1c1da1ff38ed1e45807c88ece5123887)

3. Moon

I don't like that Moon is the symbol for recognition and fame because it makes no sense for me, specially when the seconday meanings revolve around night and the emotions.

In my second prototype I added the **Butterfly** as the symbol of **Inconstancy**, common in many decks like la Sibila Italiana, le Livre du Destin, la Sibylle des Salons, etc because the butterflies are light and whimsical, flying from flower to flower pushed only by their impulses and the need of nectar.

It was about to become part of the extra 4 cards when I remembered this scene from Romeo & Juliet:

*""O, swear not by the moon, th'inconstant moon,*  
*That monthly changes in her circled orb,*                        
*Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.""*

The Moon is not an uncommon symbol for Inconstancy, with her changing face and effect on tides. And don't forget the aspects of madness, night and ""moony"". Even in the Divine Comedy we the first sphere of Paradise (the Moon) is the Heaven of the Inconstant, the good people that neglected their vows.

I'm still not sure if Moon actually contains the ""volubility, whimsical, driven only by impulses and desires"" meanings of the Butterfly but one thing is sure: Is a very good symbol for inconstancy, what is always changing, mood swings, inestability, madness, being moody, moony, the night, etc.

# The 4 extra cards:

1. Private room / Fireplace

Equally common in a lot of fortune telling decks as Living room (sometimes the Study or Bedroom), is the opposite card to the extrovert and public social life of the Park and different from the concepts of home, family and facade of the House. It represents the inner, introvert and private life. The intimate meetings, what happens behind closed doors, rest, comfort, even sex (a better alternative than the sadist Rod and the contradictory Lilies hahahsa /j).

2. Wine / Bottle

Equally common as well, sometimes as Wine itself, the Bottle, Joy, etc this is the card of indulgency, liquor, drunkness, parties, excess, adiction and chaos.

3. Medal

Substitute to the Moon: Card of honors, recognition, pride, being in the public's eye, fame, popularity, reputation, success and vanity.

4. I still haven't decided on the symbol :3 but is the card for Work.

You can torture me but I'm not choosing between Moon, Fox and Anchor. This is the card for work, labor, effort, industry (as a virtue and industrialization), coworkers, teamwork, projects, chores, anything that requires dedication.

1go3n5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1go3n5n/feeling_confused_and_used_after_a_close_friendship/,Feeling Confused and Used After a Close Friendship,"Hello all, first time posting here and I tried to shorten this as best as I could. I really appreciate any insight you may have.  
  
Earlier this year, I went through a tough romantic breakup, and shortly after, a female co-worker started chatting with me and asked me to go on a walk after work, which ended up being us talking late into the night. I genuinely thought we both enjoyed each other’s company and maybe I started then to develop some feelings in the back of my mind. I’d go places with her that I didn’t care much for to make her happy and be supportive. I think she also did the same for me. She even wanted to cook for me, and I made her coffee one night, which she loved. We shared jokes, exchanged small gifts, and had heartfelt conversations. For a while, it felt like we both needed each other’s friendship. She even started to take interest in my hobbies and the things I really liked.

After a few months, she told me being social with me was exhausting, mentioning her struggles with ADHD and her limited social battery. I respected this and let things slow down. But every time we were together, it still felt like there was a deep connection. We’d even hold each other when we walked, and every time we did so, she would have this infections smile and say how much taller I was than her and that she never realized it. I smiled back, in that moment it was like we were in love or something, and I enjoyed it.

One week, I barely heard from her, and I decided to give her some space incase that was what she needed. When I noticed she didn't seem like herself during a work meeting, I reached out and asked if she was ok, to which she told me she hasn't been and has been struggling due to a family situation. Previously she had helped me get over something emotional in my life by just being a friend, so naturally I wanted to do the same. I was sick at the time and had a limited voice, but I talked with her over dinner (because she stopped eating, something she does often when upset and a lot during our friendship). I offered her great advice on how to navigate the situation. She messaged me after she put the advice to use and thanked me for the push. I felt so happy for her.

Two weeks ago, we had dinner and told each other how much our friendship meant to each other because we both did not have any other good friends like us. We teared up. She later held my hand that night for the first time for a little bit in the car before leaving. This was when it started to click in my mind that maybe I really like this person more than I realized, and maybe she felt the same. 

Recently, she started talking with a ten years younger than her co-worker at another job who’s not really her type—drinks, smokes, smokes weed, “lost in life” she told me, and that he asked her out to which she declined due to these reasons. But then continued to talk with him and did so one night until 1:30 AM, later than she has ever hung out with me. I was still supportive and telling her to set boundaries so she wouldn’t lead him on by mistake, which she said she set them and wouldn’t lead him on and he was just nice to talk with. Very recently, she told they had a real date, and I felt so crushed by hearing this, my heart sank. I was still supportive and told her I was happy for her because she is finally dating (something she also struggled with). She explained to me they had similar personalities, both have ADHD, that they can have fun but not sexual fun (she wants to wait until marriage), and she can be her “autistic self” around him. I asked her if she thinks he would accept the boundaries she set especially for sex as he’s at a young age, but she got defensive and said I was acting like her dad by lecturing her, to which I told her I was sorry and just was being a supportive friend. After that, she began withdrawing from me.

In the days that followed, my anxiety spiked. I wondered if I’d missed signs she liked me, that maybe I’d focused too much on being a “friend” when I felt more. I decided to call her and ask. I brought up our long talks, hand-holding and holding each other, intimate conversations, gift giving, but she told me it was all just friendship and regretted the hand-holding. She also listed reasons we couldn’t work as a couple: she doesn’t believe in male friendships while dating (where as I can have female friends while dating), we have different family values and financial views, she wants to wait for intimacy until marriage (she’s religious), and what hurt the most was when she listed things I've said to her in the past and picked them apart to me like I was criticizing her or being rude to her. I explained that was never my intention and I was only being a good friend trying to uplift her at times to boost her self-confidence and that she enjoyed when we joked around, to which she said yes we were joking. I said I didn’t know those things bothered her because she never told me. She never said anything to me about this until now.

I felt overwhelmed, and in trying to explain myself, I got flustered and mixed up some words which didn’t help at all. I did tell her that the right person can make you want to adjust and how I truly don’t mind waiting for intimacy, but she dismissed it, saying I shouldn’t change for her. She called this a “learning lesson (pause) for both of us” and ended by saying we’d stay professional but wouldn’t talk or hang out as before, and that she isn’t mad at me. She further stated that the perfect girl is out there for me and I need to find her. I told her I respected her decision and meant it when I said I was happy for her in her new “go with the flow, not a big deal” she told me, just starting relationship with this guy ten years younger than her.

This has been incredibly hard for me, as she’s the first close friend I’ve had who I connected with on so many levels. I appreciated her quirks, the way she dressed and style, her advice at work, her hobbies. I feel like I may have been just a placeholder or even a way for her to fill time until something else came along. Perhaps she said those things to make it easier for her to push me away? I still care deeply about her and wonder if there’s a chance she felt something more but just didn’t want to admit it. Questions I won't have answered yet, I’m trying to come to terms with letting go and be at peace. The other day we passed each other at work and locked eyes, and she waved to me. I know she still cares about me.",1,1731253953.0,Adulting,1,1.0,False

Admittedly I run an aeropress at work and that’s my primary workflow but I wanted something a) cheaper and maybe b) simpler for my home rig (I don’t drink as much coffee at home). 

So instead of trying the V60 route, low cost but high skill barrier, I grabbed the Mugen and after about 6 cups and screwing around I think I’ve hit a ‘damn I’m happy with this point’ 

With an ok Huehuetenango, 14 clicks on C3, 16g:250ml, Cafec T90, one pour about 95C and walk away. 

Drawdown is just shy of 2 minutes which feels uncomfortably fast but the cup is decent. Grinds leave the classic ‘Mugen Cone’ sticking to the sides with nearly no bed on draindown. 

The first few cups I ground 12-13 clicks, aiming for longer drawdown around 3min and got good cups but leaning rich and  bodied with lower acidity. Not bad but I know from the aeropress brews I can get more brightness. 

So dropped brew temp a little, waiting off boil for eh 95c might go lower, went up to 14 clicks and suddenly hit the slot where the brightness came back in a big way. It also doesn’t seem to like batches much off the 14-16:250 recipe I might fuss around I like a 200ml mug sometimes. 

 So nothing revelatory but I really like this little thing. After minimal prep I can pour and get to making toast without giving it a second thought. Though this is at the cost of having fewer variables to tweak.  I mean on the AP full immersion brew pour hardly matters it’s just temperature and grind but I also have full control over the exact brew time.

1go3jl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1go3jl1/caffeine_withdrawal_after_10_years_of_daily_use/,"Caffeine withdrawal after 10 years of daily use (Symptoms, and Therapeutic Sharing)","I wanted to share my recent crazy experience with caffeine.  My intent is to document my progress for myself and also help someone else who may have experienced similar issues to feel better about the whole ordeal of detoxing from coffee.

**Background:**  42yo M, 2 kids, athletic and involved in sports basically my entire adult life.  I swim and/or go for daily walks now that I'm in my 40's but I'm a reasonably healthy middle aged guy.  Light to no alcohol use.  No smoking.

We have 2 kids, a toddler and a 6 month old.  When the 6 month old got to about 5 months, she hit a major sleep regression and I was on probably 2-3 weeks straight of sleep deprivation and just overall shit sleep/fatigue.  Because of this, I had been mixing pretty heavy coffee in my pot.  Somewhere between the 4 and 6 lines on the pot and increasingly stronger as time went on, to the point that the coffee started to taste bad because of how potent it was.  This is in the overall larger context of having drank coffee for at least 10 years straight every day to varying degrees.

**Start of problem:**  This is when the problem started.  One day about 6 weeks ago, in the middle of this baby sleep deprivation craze, I took a nap at 2pm, woke up at 3pm and while I was laying there, my muscles all over my body were twitching, analogous to fire flies lighting up and disappearing in random places.  It didn't hurt, but it was of course alarming.  I wasn't sure what to make of it, so I took note that it died down a little bit at night (but not fully), and then within about an hour of having my morning coffee the following mornings, got reliably worse.

I remember driving home from the gym about 1.5 hours after polishing off my morning coffee and feeling dizzy, like I was going to have a panic attack while driving.  It also felt like I couldnt trust my legs to drive properly.  My right leg in particular had an ""energized"" and weak feeling simultaneously, running down the backside.  As if you wanted to stretch it but there was no move that actually helped it.  I could also feel my pulse down in my right foot arch.

After a few more lousy mornings of this situation repeating, mixed with some denial, I realized I had to quit the coffee.  I think the combination of being in my 40's, soul crushing baby-related fatigue, and high mg's of caffeine simply blew a circuit out in my nervous system.  My body can't handle this combination of inputs any longer.  I cut down for a week, and then cold turky-ed it.

**Withdrawal symptoms weeks 1-2:**

\- Rough headache

\-Twitches all over body, rib cage, left arm, stomach, (concentrated in calf muscles, feet, eyes)

\- Mild to moderate dissociation (for example being out to dinner and not feeling present for the conversation

\- Goofy feeling right leg that felt like it was ready to party or ""do something"", while the rest of my body was relaxed.  Goofy leg feeling goes away for a day or 2, then comes back for a day or 2, as if it is some sort of cycle related to withdrawal.  Going for walks relaxes it nicely.

\-Going to bed at 10:30, waking up at 1:30am, then 5:30am, being tired the rest of the day

\-Somehow managed to pull a back muscle while not doing anything strenuous.  As if my lower back were in a compromised state, and then normal day to day use just pushed one of the muscles too far.  I never yanked a back muscle before in my life, but here we are.

\-Tingling in face and head, left corner of mouth

\-Pooping normal again (this was nice!)

**Withdrawal Symptoms weeks 3-4:**

\-Headaches have mostly died out but still some small ones

\-Still feel anxious for no reason, usually when talking to people.  I sometimes feel like the muscles in my jaw and face are tired, it makes me self conscious that my face looks weird (even though it doesnt in the mirror), then I start becoming distracted from the person I'm talking to.

\-Goofy right leg feeling persists on the 2 days on/2 days off cycle but its not as bad as it was in the first 2 weeks.

\-Low key calf twitches while laying in bed after waking up, that mostly go away during the day

\-Heavy feeling in legs once per week or so, as if walking is a burden.  Interestingly as soon as something positive happens (having sex for example) the symptoms completely vanish.

\-I wear contacts, and they tend to dry out and lose focus in the middle of the day when I'm tired.  If I put my glasses on everything is fine.

\-The lower back ""strain"" or whatever it actually is, spread up to my shoulders and landed right in the middle of my back.  Been using a heat pad on that to settle it.

\-I notice if I have even 1 drink of alcohol, for example a can of white claw, It makes a lot of the neuro type symptoms worse for an entire day, so I'm completely avoiding alcohol for the rest of this year.  


\-Vivid dreams!  Some very nice ones in fact almost every night. Also sleeping to 6:30 now which is a major improvement

**Future Plans:**

I'm currently on day 30 of absolutely no caffeine.  I'm going to bookmark this post, come back and make another update in a month or 2.  After seeing this absolute shit show of symptoms, I will likely not be touching caffeine in any form for the rest of my life.

As of day 30, I generally feel better overall, in the morning, and during the day, and about myself in general.  I just need these symptoms to die out in the coming months and like I said, no plans of turning back.  I can see the light!  I didn't realize how far I had fallen drinking coffee every day.  But I'm confident that I'll be a better man a year from now.

Tl;dr I (26M) am interested in my coworker (38F). Awkward first interaction (my fault) turned into the ""married"" couple at work. We both went out for after work drinks recently, both got drunk, and I admit my feelings and I would like to give something more official a try, she thinks our age gap is significant and I should be dating closer to my age or younger. We then drunkenly make out before sharing my bed to sleep the drinks off. Nothing at or outside of work feels like has changed. We haven't really spoken about that night other than reminiscing about the drinks and people we saw. Thoughts and advice?

Context:
I (26M) really enjoy the company of and like my coworker (38F). We work in different departments but our departments interface with each other on a daily. We were also almost always pushed together for collaborative projects or just being paired up at work events.

Somehow, despite me starting off on the wrong foot with her (said something about her looks, major faux paus) we have become the ""married"" couple at work. We have spent quite abit of time together outside of work, agree on alot of topics (and if we don't, we're both open to having a debate), and are each other's +1 to most work or mutual social events (for her it's ""I'm only going cause you're going""). And there's alot more that has more or less been the building blocks of our connection (family, previous dating history, etc etc).

We recently went out for drinks after work (we have never done drinks after work since we each live in different directions, with her being much further away). We both got drunk and somewhere along the night I admitted my feelings. She paused to process the info, and in the moment I asked if she trusted me, she said yes and next thing, we were making out (I initiated). She then pulls away cause she thinks we shouldn't be a thing because of our age difference and I should be dating closer to my age or younger. We stayed for abit more, had a few more drinks and being abit more flirty with each other, making out abit more (her initiating here and there this time) before we ended the night heading back to my place since it was closer and sharing my bed to sleep the drinks off. Morning comes, we get some post drinking/hangover coffee before she leaves for her place.

We haven't really spoken about that night other than reminiscing about how much we drank and people we saw. Things at and outside of work to me have felt relatively the same. We still hangout and do things together. Thoughts and advice?",1,1731253683.0,dating,2,1.0,False

She said she never fought with any one the amount of times she fought with me. 

But she was always pushing my boundaries. I always tried to remain calm. We dated for 9 months and although we had Disagreements we only ever yelled at each other once.

She was friends with her ex (she knew him for 8 years but only dated for 6 months) they shared a bed a few times but never had sex as they had her dog sleep between her. (I believe her but still never made me feel comfortable)

She always made me feel like I was the problem. Like I didn't do enough. She had epilepsy so she couldn't drive at night (sometimes even during the day) she lived 40 minutes away from me but i always went to visit her. I always tried to make plans with her but she'd rarely make plans with me.

She'd teased me all the time but would never make the first move to initiate sex. And almost every time I did she wasnt in the mood for it. But id spend almost all of my free time with her and all her free time was with me. (She works a full time job)

She was the nicest person i knew but sometimes also the meanest. Sometimes i felt like i was there for her entertainment. We'd talk on the phone for hours. Some times to the point where she'd highjack my study time.

She'd do her own things at her apartment but if i tried to do my own thing while i was with her she'd complain about me ignoring her.

She said i made her feel crazy bc I gaslighted her all the time. I felt crazy tbh bc idk if i was doing it unintentionally but I swear I was only ever trying to be honest with her.

With her condition sometimes she would belittle my struggles. (I was working part time but going to school full time) and she'd say do more bc she's sick and she does a lot. So her argument was im not sick so i can do more than her. And while sometimes it was motivational other times i began to feel guilty for being healthy. For not doing more. I get she was trying to push me but sometimes it really sucked the life out of me. To tell her about my hardship only to have her tell me she has it worse.

When it came to the small things she was always the best. Made sure i was hydrated. She alwsys handed me waters and she always made sure i was fed. She alwsys had long meaningful conversations with me. Her and i laughed sometimes so hard that my stomach would hurt. We would watch her favorite shows and bond. We wouldn't give her dog baths together and go to the park with her dog almost every day.  Her and i would get coffee every morning and just talk.

We would talk for hours. For days without ever running out of stuff to say. She was my best friend. But somehow we could not make it work as partners.

I'm not perfect. I have flaws. Sometimes i felt like i was perfect other times i felt like she stole my self confidence. Like i could do nothing right. 

I wish I was just her friend. I dont regret dating her but now someone who i knew for 10 years is gone. I miss her smile and i miss her eyes

No one looked at me the way she looked at me. I know for a fact that this break up was for the best but i miss her. I miss all the good times we had. I wish I knew what went wrong. I wish we just sat down and talked it through. Which I guess we did try multiple times.

I was ready to break up with her at times with how frustrated i was getting. I always wanted to run away instead of dealing with stuff head on. Some times I needed a break but I genuinely did want to work things out I never felt like I was given the opportunity to collect my thoughts though. 

She probably saw that and it's most likely why she broke up with me. Someone had to be the adult and end the relationship bc deep down I think it began to be toxic.

I still miss everything about her though.
I hope she finds peace and has a happy life with her dog ",1,1731253528.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

She draws her knees to her chest, then reflexively draws them back down before her mother has the chance to protest. Jude had finished her shift early today and, being faced with the grueling dilemma between arriving at her mother's prematurely and doing something productive, like her shopping for the week, had instead opted to walk in circles in the parking lot in front of the entrance. When the time had finally arrived, she slowly climbed up the stairs to the third floor, taking a break at each landing to collect her breath, that she had tried to pointlessly reason with herself was still within the spirit of wasting time. Now it's been about 20 minutes since she got there, and the two of them are sitting in silence, only occasionally interrupted by the sound of the air humidifier. Her mother is wearing a turban and comically oversized dangling earrings. Staring at them for too long, coupled with the overwhelmingly powerful scent of lavender that is engulfing the entire room, is making Jude queasy. She wishes the two of them could have met somewhere in a neutral territory, like a coffee shop. She picks at a loose piece of leather hanging from the couch, then realizes she shouldn't be doing this in someone else's home and abruptly stops. 
""You look healthy,"" her mother says in a tone that indicates what she really means is she's gained weight. Jude smiles sheepishly in response. Briefly considers what the appropriate amount of pleasantries is before she can get to the point of her visit - asking for money. ""It's nice seeing you,"" she says instead. Her mother furrows her brows. 
""Are you indicating that seeing me is somehow a surprise?"" 
""I didn't mean that as a jab, I'm just saying I hadn't seen you in a while and, well, here you are."" Jude pauses and adds ""It's nice."" 
Her mother seems to be pleased with that. She nods in reconciliation, seems pensive. She likes to hold on to for grudges longer, Jude thinks and immediately knows the question she's, in turn, holding back. She notices her mother drawing circles with her finger along the rim of her teacup, a clear sign it's requiring her a great deal of effort to subdue it. After all, that effort proves too much for her and she drives the conversation to its logical conclusion: ""Have you bought it for me?""
Jude shakes her head, makes a noise not entirely too dissimilar to one a wounded animal might make. 

The rest of the visit doesn't stray much from its typical routine, small talk and half smiles, that ultimately lead nowhere. The conversation equivalent of going to the supermarket and reading the first line of every greeting card. A back and forth of pleasnatries, a dance around the edge of the abyss that is having to comfront the fact that outside of twenty or so years of cohabitation they hardly have anything to discuss. Jude had tactfully avoided answering any questions regarding her personal life because that'd inevitably lead to her explaining she has resorted to keeping the lights off to save on the electricity bill, and that's not a conversation anyone's particularly eager to have on a Tuesday evening. After another 15 minutes or so of sporadically eyeing the clock, Jude had decided it's time to go. This stay, as they tend to be, is rather short-lived. 
Jude's mother is what they call a nutcase in no uncertain terms. When her interest in the occult began it was almost endearing in a way, if not to say comical. Listening to her describe the apparent abundance of healing properties of whatever new gemstone she got her hands onto that week turned into a family ritual of sorts, polite smiles and patient nods, the way you do when a child is talking to you about their favorite dinosaur. Her obsession with the occult is one that has always irritated Jude, not for any reasons of personal distaste for the matter, but rather how out of place it had always seemed for a person such as herself. It's not, Jude had often thought, a good look on her. The dissonance between someone as stern and sensible as her mother and the child-like infatuation she has with what is essentially magic tricks for adults has and continues to perplex her. Her fascination with the occult, much like any passion grown too substantial in one's life, is one that appeared suddenly and with little warning signs. It's easy, of course, to pinpoint her repetitive nightmares as the source of her need for some kind of miracle, but they themselves are the direct consequence of something greater that precedes them, something that has perhaps always been there. Be it an underlying need for attention or some kind of phobia, the simple fact is this passion is now an unshakeable part of her (and by extention Jude's) life. After countless visits to medical professionals and diagnoses with various degrees of accuracy, her mother had turned her attention to the methods of alternative healing. They, of course, had been about as helpful as those of regular old medicine, which is to say completely futile. I feel like I'm getting close to finally figuring it all out she had told Jude on more than one occasion, and Jude had remained silent. She'd wanted to ask ""Are you really sure you're seeing all that? I mean, how can you really know you're not making it up?"" Her own dreams, if they can be called that, mostly consist of sounds, ones so muffled, as if coming behind some great invisible barrier. The visual element of dreams, for some reason, has always been completely absent for her. Any time she'd tried to imagine what it is her mother was seeing, her mind had come up to a blank. Now going down the stairs she had so laboriously climbed, Jude considers once again the logistics of mutually beneficial exchange. Knowing her mother is an avid supporter of the ""What am I, a banker?"" mindset, she wouldn't be willing to give out her money unless she got what she wanted first. Jude lets out a sigh in an act of exasperation, then pulls out her phone and goes through her bookmarked pages. She quickly scrolls past several searches reading ""why back hurt"", ""cheap pool memberships near me"", ""how to save $400 in 30 days?""  and comes to a stop when she finds the one she's looking for. It's the address of a shop bearing the name ""Shop of oddities"", its tagline: ""The Secrets of the Eastern Mysteries: Personal Rituals - Creating Sacred Spaces"". She sets a route. The shop is about half an hour away from where she lives by car. For now she'll go home, take her time rehearsing exactly what she'll say when she presents her mother with this time's curio, a prerequisite to making the dreaded request. She'll return in a week.

The week, like all weeks spent rotating between monotonous work and unfulfilling hobbies, goes by rather quickly. Jude is finishing her coffee in her car as she's taking in the storefront across from her. The welcoming sign offers no clues as to what one might expect to find inside. It's so faded and scrunched, it might have been trampled by horses. The windows are tinted black as if to amplify the mystery. Her head hurts. She's contemplating whether this shopping trip feels her with vexation or curiosity, thinks it's hard trying to predict her reactions proportionally to the inconvenience causing them. She lights up a smoke, a sort of precautionary measure against the irritation she feels building up. As she gets out of the car, she catches a glimpse of her reflection and comes up closer to study it. Long tired face, clothes one wears when visiting a parent, which is to say a semi-elegant gold-plated collier on top of her usual black shirt and baggy jeans. For a moment Jude contemplates taking out her phone in a last-ditch effort to procrastinate, but thinks better of it and finishes her cigarette, then walks in. The interior of the shop is so dimly lit, Jude has to stand motionless for a few seconds to let her eyes adjust. She quickly studies her surroundings, glass bowls full of polished gemstones, imitation bonsai trees, imitation gold Buddha statues; a curious mix of cultures that seems to have little regard for cohesion. Jude tries to find something to set her eyes on, seems to notice a woman behind the counter about the same time the woman notices her. The woman looks at her bewildered, as if a customer walking in is the last thing that she expected. She sets down her phone and gets up to face her, proceeds not to say anything. Jude takes a not so discreet look at her phone. It's open on a search query reading ""Craveri's murrelet"". Below it is a picture of a bird entirely too bland to be deserving of that title. Jude looks back at her, says "" Do you have one of those dream catchers, you know, the ones that protect you from shitty dreams or whatever?"" 
""What?"" 
The woman is significantly shorter than Jude and is of plump build. That, coupled with the somewhat reticent look her face exudes reminds Jude of the women one would see in medieval art. She tries and fails to recall the name of such a painting she had seen during her first and only ever visit to an art gallery. As she'll later remember, it was aptly named ""Portrait of a lady"". The woman's eyes are almond-shaped, intelligent, they attribute her face a kind of mysterious quality. Jude feels weirdly compelled to leave a good impression on this complete stranger, she needs to let her know upfront she doesn't believe in any of this hocus-pocus. She clears her throat, starts over ""Like dream catchers, you know, you're supposed to hang them above your bed and they stop bad dreams from seeping in. I think they come from some Native American tribe, right? So they are kind of like a filter for your dreams if you think about it, only letting the good ones through. Or so I've heard.""
""Oh.""
""Not that I need one, of course, my dreams are perfectly fine. It's for my mother, she's a bit of a - here Jude points a finger to her head, makes a circular motion - a bit of a fruitcake."" 
""Ah?""
""Yeah, she's very into the whole esoteric thing. Not me though.""
""Hm.""
""So yeah, one dream catcher please. For my mother, that is. Not me.""
The woman nods thoughtfully. She shows no signs of caring what Jude's stance on the supernatural is, only looks around as if it's her very first time in the establishment. She sucks her cheeks in, then starts methodically going through every raft, ducks behind the counter, carefully scrutinizes every shelf, looking at its contents as if she's just now discovering their presence. She makes a little ""hm"" sound every subsequent time her search proves futile, then stands still for a few seconds as if in thought, and then moves on to the next shelf. The notion that she must've only recently started working here passes through Jude's mind. She hesitates, then joins her in her search. The two circle the shop a few times over working as a tandem, passing back and forth boxes filled with all sorts of curious objects, none of which a dream catcher. With this stranger now closer to her, Jude takes notice of the name tag pinned to her chest. In a font so convoluted as if specifically handpicked to be rendered completely illegible from any distance greater than a meter: Hello! I will be your spirit guide for today. You can call me: (here handwritten) Nelly. The rims of the name tag are decorated with low resolution stock images of flowers, like the ones elderly family members might send you on a holiday. Nelly. Jude repeats her name in her mind a few times, finds it odd she didn't write down a surname to go with it. She can't decide whether the name is fitting or not taken out of context, but then again the entirety of her seems to be taken out of context. A girl-anachronism, as if someone took a pair of scissors and neatly cut around her edge, then glued her on to the present. Jude doesn't notice when Nelly puts an end to her search and faces her once again, shrugs apologetically. This shopping trip, like the rest of them, has proven fruitless after all. Jude is about to say her goodbyes and walk out when Nelly bites her lips and says ""I might have something else for you"". There's a playful twinkle in the corner of her eye. Jude lifts her eyebrows, steps aside to let her go back to the counter. There, Nelly spends a considerable amount of time shuffling in her backpack that had been obstructed out of view up until now. The object she ends up pulling out is one Jude can't immediately put her finger on. It does resemble a dream catcher in that its shape is that of a circle, and it's got dangling feathers on its underside, but that's where the similarities stop. Instead of being a net, the inner part of the circle consists of a tree made out of string, its branches connecting it to the rims. Seashells are glued on to the outer side of the circle. Jude stares at it and tries to gauge at her mother's reaction upon seeing it, knowing how particular she can get about her gewgaws. It's hard to imagine she'd have anything particularly amiable to say, but then again Jude's already put in way too much effort to come all the way here just to go back empty handed. She decides that she'll deal with her mother's near inevitable sulkiness when she comes to it, shrugs, realizes Nelly can't hear her inner monologue and feels embarrassed for shrugging. 
""Alright, I'll get it. How much?""
Nelly frowns as if the prospect of accepting money for the goods she's selling hadn't occurred to her up until now. She chews it over for a moment then says
""Free of charge."" 
She notices Jude's confused expression and clarifies: ""It was for an art exhibition, but I have no use for it now. I don't have the space to hang it at home, so you can have it.""
In her car, Jude takes a closer look at the thing. She hadn't wanted to inspect it up close in the presence of Nelly, its maker, out of fear of appearing rude. Now, in the safe haven of her car she turns it over in her hands a few times, holds it up close to her eyes. It wouldn't be sufficient to say it's crudely made, but it retains that charm that DIY home projects tend to carry. It's evident it had been made entirely out of spare materials lying around, a detail Jude is certain won't go unnoticed by her mother. She tries to imagine her reaction once again, squints her eyes at the very real possibility she ends up making a fuss about it. She will find out, she supposes, soon enough. Being alone this time, she shrugs to no one in particular, starts her car and sets off.
By the time she arrives in the familiar parking lot, the pain in her head has amplified, as if in full collaboration with the chilly weather outside. She feels tired, rests her head against the car window, the warm sun beams serving as a sort of remedy. She checks the time. Thirty minutes too early. Thirty minutes until she has to make the dreaded request. Jude purses her lips. She'll be damned if she doesn't make the most of this respite, no matter how little it is. She reclines her seat and readjusts her body in a more comfortoble position. In doing so, she catches a glimpse of the feathered amulet once again. Against the backdrop of the warm sunshine and the exorbitant amount of dust particles floating in the air, it seems prettier to her now, its edges softer. She reaches a hand to it and for some unknown reason decides to hang it up on her rear-view mirror. She stares at it for a couple of seconds, then closes her eyes. 
Jude sits on the bench across from her mother. She draws her knees to her chest, then reflexively draws them back down before her mother has the chance to protest. No one seems to be particularly bothered by the fact the comfortable leather sofa has been exchanged for a park bench or that their surroundings are entirely in monochrome. Her head still hurts. 
""Have you bought it for me?"" 
Jude looks down at her lap. As she had half-expected, she finds the already familiar amulet. Her mother reaches out an impatient hand for it. No, on second thought it's not her mother's living room they're currently in. This room has been so stripped of its ornamentation, it's about as homey as a bunker. Bare walls, deprived of any pictures or shelves to create the illusion of comfort. The room appears narrower on one end, though that may be just the uneven placement of the lights or Jude's own sense of unease rearing its head or both, working in unison to push her claustrophobia into overdrive. Her mother is stating at the amulet greedily. She opens her mouth.
""The importance of dreams is not one that should be understated, nor should reoccurring themes within them be dismissed. Though some may slip away from our grasp like minnows when we try to recollect them, the simple fact is our unconscious mind is not a locked vault and nothing we store there can ever truly remain hidden.""
She talks and water pours out of her mouth. Jude notes with a dull kind of horror her own lack of reaction.
""Dreams are the stars' way of communicating with us, they kindly lend us clues to areas of our lives which require attention. For everything that's yet to happen has already been decided, oh yes, there's an order to it all. The stars and the planets are what determine it, and the sky is their stencil, on which our life unfolds.""
The water is beginning to pool at Jude's feet. She keeps her eyes fixed to the ground. She isn't really listening to her mother's rambling, but then again it's not really meant for her. A recited speech she's heard many times over. Her mother keeps on babbling.
""Night in and night out, I lay, and I listen. In the morning, I pull out my natal chart I and diligently write everything down, and then I sit and I analyze. I've compiled enough empirical evidence to see the patterns. Everything matches up like clockwork. Retrograde mercury coinciding with a particularly bad dream. Knee joint pains being foretold by а Pluto square Sun transit. Every day, I get a little closer to figuring it all out. ""
The water level is rising, it's now past Jude's ankles and steadily going up. Jude hysterically thinks if it keeps going this way she won't have any dry clothes to wear to work tomorrow. 
""Of course, not everyone is this fortunate.
People who are sleep deprived also tend to be dream deprived, spending less time dreaming and perhaps not remembering dreams as well. Why can't they see it's their own cynicism that's clouding their judgment? To downplay the importance of dreams is to refuse the messages send uniquely to you. If only they were to pay less time squabbling over their own trivial matters, maybe they'd see the ties that bind us all."" 
The pace at which the water is pouring out seems to be growing increasingly relentless, its tidal surge pushing away the bench her mother is sitting on as Jude watches. She remains motionless. Wants to say ""hey, I don't think your mouth should be doing that"", a useless kind of remark, entirely too unhelpful and entirely too late. Registers sheer frustration at her own uselessness.
""They are so caught up in their own routine, they remain ignorant to the clues all around them. That's what keeps them so miserable, they don't have an ounce of spirituality in them, it's all work, sleep and eat with these people. Then, at the end of the day they ask themselves why they feel so empty, so malcontent, never to stop and think outside of the bounds of their own presumptions. Is their pragmatism an expression of their own perceived intellectual high ground then, or is it really defiance for the sake of defiance? If the material world is the only one that trully exists, why do they persist, knowing it serves no greater purpose than that of temporarily satisfying their needs until they have to do it all over again?""
The water level is now so high her mother is almost entirely out of sight. Jude remains fixed to her bench. She wants to reach out, do something. A sudden swell of the water shakes up the room, a giant wave towering over her. What follows next. A series of flashing images; her mother with earrings so big, they're threatening to topple her over. Lottery tickets scattered on the kitchen table. Nelly with her serious face in the dimness of the Shop of oddities, surrounded by disproportionately sized birds. Their eyes all set on her. Her own dark eyes staring, her gaze unclear.
Jude jumps up in her car seat, the sudden all at once motion of a coil spring released. She puts her head in her hands and gathers her breath, much like a movie heroine. The feathers of the amulet gently sway back and forth from the air movement, but otherwise everything is perfectly still. The parking lot is as empty as always. She checks her phone once again. She has been asleep for a little over forty minutes, rendering her late for her visit. She reluctantly grabs the amulet, exits her car and makes her way up the loathsome stairs. This stay is even shorter than usual. Coming as no surprise, her mother is displeased with the amulet, something about the seashells being completely out of place in a preposterous act of disrespect for the craft. A 15 minute monologue ensues about the importance of the conventions of dream catcher making, far from the favorable conditions needed for Jude to finally make her request. She doesn't make it after all, perhaps too distracted to remember it or too tired or otherwise too something else preventing her from looking after her own financial well-being. She'll manage on her own, she read somewhere that listening to the radio rather than watching cable as a past time is better for the mind anyway. If worse comes to worst, she might even consider picking up a book. 
The very next day as soon as she finishes her shift, Jude gets in her car and heads straight to the Shop of oddities at a pace that should've probably warranted a speeding ticket. When she arrives, she crosses the distance to the door in a half-jog and freezes with her hand on the handle. She hadn't really thought about what she'd say to Nelly and now she's weighing her options. Throwing accusations is unlikely to get her anywhere, but turning back and leaving would be unthinkable. She stays motionless by the storefront, looking vacantly at her own reflexion, pondering just how many reoccurring patterns seemingly exist in her life. While at her mother's the previous day, she had felt a strong compulsion to bring up the topic of her own dream. Doing so would've probably paved the way to a more substantial conversation. A seldom act of reaching common ground, that for some goes by unfulfilled. All this thinking quickly proves entirely too onerous for her, it always does, so she does the most sensible thing and just walks in. She doesn't account for the stark difference in the lighting level and stumbles her way to the counter, bumping into several inordinately sharp edges along the way. The woman behind the counter she locks eyes with is tall, fair-haired. She's not Nelly. Jude stares at her stupidly, she hadn't considered the possibility of encountering someone else in her place. She feels a wave a disappointment wash over her. Without even letting the other woman say her hellos, she silently walks out of the shop and back to her car. She could return the next day, of course, or the day after that in hopes of encountering Nelly, but what question is there really to ask? Isn't she blowing this whole thing out of proportion anyway? Perhaps having narrowly missed that brief window of inspiration that comes after a disquieting event, her mind is already drifting off to something else. Something funny a coworker once said, a particularly bad haircut a customer had the other day. The words spoken in the dream growing less certain. For now she'll return home, where she'll microwave canned ravioli for dinner and sit on her own ragged sofa. She'll throw away that feathered amulet, she has no use for it after all. Then she'll turn on the tv and watch cable, since the end of the month hasn't arrived yet. She'll scroll all the different programmes a few times over until she finally settles on one she likes. Preferably one that doesn't make her think too hard. ",1,1731253518.0,u_Nooby246,0,1.0,False

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I’m looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I’m not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I’m very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific “type” of person! I’m looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn’t be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I’m not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn’t?) - I’m definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I’m a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I’m very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you’d be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I’ve mentioned in my post, it’s up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on “hey” or smalltalk responses.

I am 41/f and was diagnosed with MVP a couple years ago when I was referred to a cardiologist for heart palpitations. He made it sound like one big nothing, and to carry on as usual. All my tests were excellent, and I had an incredibly low chance of having any type of cardiac event.  I almost thought I won't bother coming back to be tested yearly - there is nothing wrong with my heart.

Subsequently, I decided to finally medicate at age 40 for lifelong anxiety issues. Tried Lexapro, Wellbutrin, Prozac, Buspirone and occasionally Propranolol. That led me down a path where I eventually received a ""soft diagnosis"" from a nurse practitioner of ADHD.  Started Vyvanse a few months ago, currently taking 40mg. Also a low dose of 25mg sertraline (Zoloft). Don't really care for the Zoloft, but absolutely love the Vyvanse.

I went for my yearly appointment yesterday. I had noticed my blood pressure was high and they confirmed it. I assume this is from the Vyvanse. But the doctor also said I now have moderate regurgitation, which would eventually likely require surgery. I was shocked! Never knew this could happen. He could not say if the Vyvanse caused this. Chicken and egg situation. Basically, I was told I was born with this and there is nothing I can do about it lifestyle or diet related.

So naturally I went home and googled. Eventually coming across Magnesium deficiency - therefore megadosing as a supplement -  as something people claim fixed their MVP.

So in the end I'm totally overwhelmed with what to do. I immediately thought I will stop the Vyvanse & Zoloft, no longer indulge in my beloved coffee, while starting to supplement magnesium. But if it improves, I won't know what actually helped, and possibly suffering without something for no reason.

It was like looking into a mirror. She had the same eyes, hair, body, and everything similar to me. She stared at me with an angry scowl. Before I could say anything, she began walking away.

I chalked that encounter as something my tired mind imagined. Clubbing late must have taken a toll on me. That was until I came home later that day to find my bedroom ravaged, and some of my clothes had been stolen.

I reported the break-in to the police, who told me they'd investigate further to find the culprit.

Then I saw her at the grocery store. I quickly stopped at the dairy aisle to pick up a milk carton. As I examined it, a hand suddenly clasped my wrist. ""Hey-!"" I shouted but was immediately shocked to see her again. Not only did she have a smug grin on her face, but she was also wearing one of the clothes stolen from me.

She let go and I quickly pushed my cart along. That grin was still ingrained in my head as I was at checkout.

Two days later, a friend texted me. But what she sent confused me, I read it repeatedly, and I still couldn't understand it.

""I gotta tell you, you went WILD during that party last night! You killed it on the dance floor and everyone loved you!""

I didn't go to any party, at least not recently. 

I asked her to clarify what she was referring to, and she sent me a video. Upon playing it, I immediately recognized the woman on the dancefloor. It was the woman who looked exactly like me and who I saw at the coffee shop and the grocery store.

This wasn't making any sense.

One faithful evening, I returned home and discovered a message painted in what I later learned was pig blood smeared in my living room. ""THIEF"" was what the message read.

As I tried scrubbing the message off, I received a text from an unknown number. The text revealed a photo.  It was her again, and she was cuddling with my boyfriend in his house.

Hot tears poured as I sat on my living room couch, hands clasped around my head. Why was this happening? 

I couldn't understand any of this, but then it clicked. I finally understood. 

At first, I thought being an identical twin sucked, I thought I would never be as popular as she was. I thought no one would ever acknowledge me as me, just another clone of *her.* But then I had an idea.

It was wrong, but it was the only way people would adore me.

Unfortunately, she's back and trying to take what's rightfully hers.

1go2yjs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1go2yjs,Include grapefruit in your diet 🍽️,"Grapefruit - a secret weapon for improving insulin sensitivity, energy production, thyroid function, sleep and glycogen storage 

The reason is a compound called INOSITOL

Here's what you need to know about INOSITOL⬇️⬇️

Inositol is something our body synthesizes from glucose

Inositol makes up every cell membrane as phosphatidylinositol and thus is important for cell membrane structure, function, and hormones

It’s considered a non-essential nutrient, but we don't make enough for optimal health

Here are the benefits of inositol:
- glucose oxidation
- glycogen synthesis and formation in muscle
- drives creatine into muscle
- drives calcium into bone
- improves insulin signaling
- Breaks down fat
- hormone signaling
- energy production 
- sleep and neurotransmitters

Many factors deplete the body of inositol including:
- Magnesium deficiency
- Manganese deficiency
- Coffee/caffeine
- Elevated glucose levels
- Insulin resistance
- Lack of salt

As a result, your insulin sensitivity and glucose levels will suffer

Supplementing with inositol has been found to have insulin-sensitizing effects (PMID: 23340885)

Diabetics exhibit depleted intracellular myo-inositol, and they excrete more myo-inositol in the urine (PMID: 8392181)

High blood glucose inhibits myo-inositol uptake by competing with myo-inositol transporters (PMID: 2108731)

I saw this on-sale yesterday, and I decided to share this deal for you, and the best price as I found so far is sold via Bed Bath & Beyond.

With this machine, you can make cashew, peanut, almonds, pecan, walnut, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and coconut milk within 8-16 minutes (1 or 2 cups at once)

I like to pour about 3/4 cup of cashew to make 20 OZ cashew milk to make nut milk coffee, and add a filter or tea infuser into the pitcher. Once the milk came out, I use a spoon to stir or It is pretty tasty. If you like to be more tasty, you can add some organic milk to the coffee,too.

MOST IMPORTANTLY, YOU CAN AVOID DURING CHEMICAL ESSENCES AND SAVE MONEY WHEN YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN COFFEE AT HOME, AND SAVE MONEY ALSO. IF YOU ARE WORKING FROM HOME, THIS IS A GREAT MACHINE FOR YOUR KITCHEN COUNTER.

I know that all of the information I need is available through searching but I feel like I have read so many reviews and posts at this point that my head is spinning.

I am in the US (DC area, IDK if that's relevant), and my budget is $3000. I'm really hoping to buy something that lasts 15+ years. My parents had a 2003 Jura Z-series that they gave me a few years ago and I fell in love with it, but then it finally bit the dust and it costs so much to fix I decided I'd rather just buy a new one to last me another 15-20 years. 

I mostly drink regular coffee. I love that the Jura I used to have made really good ""regular coffee"" with a great crema, so that's my top priority. However, I would like to be able to to make the occasional weekend latte or cappuccino without having to do much work to froth the milk myself. The milk is where I keep getting caught up in the reviews, with some people saying Jura's milk features are terrible. 

I am the only person in my family that drinks coffee so I don't need multiple settings, 2 cups at once, etc. I don't care about using my smartphone or any tech-y features like that. I would give a slight edge to smaller models, because my kitchen isn't huge, but that isn't my main priority.

I primarily used Professor Messer's videos and practice exams, supplemented with **""**CompTIA Security+ Get Certified Get Ahead: SY0-701 Study Guide"" (a $9.99 Kindle book). 

PM's practice exam bundle ($50 I think) was money well spent. You get three practice exams, and they're pretty thorough. The only slight issue I noticed was that with PM's multiple choice answers, two, sometimes three of the choices had no relevance/similarity to the correct answer. This often made it easy to determine the answer or at least narrow it down to two choices by simple process of elimination (especially if you know your acronyms inside & out).

The actual test, at least for me, did not do that. For most of the questions, all multiple choice options were similar or related to each other as far as the domain they belonged to. For many of them, two or three of the answers were technically correct, and which was the ""best"" solution could really be up to the person taking the test based on their real-world experience. So that made it a little more difficult. I might try Dion's practice tests when I tackle Network+, but I still highly recommend Professor Messer's, they were extremely helpful and very well laid out. 

Now for the WAY TOO MUCH INFORMATION portion of my post. 

I have a pretty standard pre-test routine. Light dinner the night before, no late-night snacking, good night of sleep. An hour & a half before the test, a couple of eggs, maybe a yogurt, and a cup of coffee - similar to my work-morning routine, so nothing my stomach says, ""Hey, wtf is this?"" to. Did the same yesterday. 

Well, my tummy didn't like something. Had a huge poo just before signing in, which I thought ""Great, don't have to worry about that"". Boy, was I wrong. About 20 questions in, my stomach started gurgling. I was like, ""Oh boy"". But I clenched up, and it seemed to pass. But it returned around question 50, and this time I was in trouble. I signaled for the proctor and asked what happens if I have a bathroom emergency, and was told ""No bathroom breaks"" and that if I left the view of the camera the test was over. So I clenched up again, and started plowing through. By now it was so bad I was barely reading the questions. But I got through the multiple choice, then returned to the scenario-based questions (I always save those for the end). Got through two of the three, but that was when I had to give up: y'all, I was starting to poop in my pants. 

I ended the exam, but of course, they make you answer a bunch of survey questions at the end, so it was becoming a nightmare situation. But I got through, saw that I passed, and was able to get to the bathroom before it got too out of control. Whew. 

So why am I sharing this horrifying experience? Mostly just to gross you out. But also to reinforce doing whatever you can to make sure you're as gastronomically prepared as possible, however you're able to. I thought I'd done that adequately, but looking back realized I'd tried a new kind of yogurt my wife had bought, completely different brand & type than what I ate every day. Did that cause it? I'll never know. But I know I won't make that mistake again. 

Hope this is somewhat helpful to those of you preparing to take the test. If nothing else, if things don't go well, at least you can say, ""Well hey, it could always be worse, at least I didn't sh\*t my pants like that one guy"".

1go2qep,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1go2qep/novice_overwhelmed_by_options_grinder_machine/,Novice overwhelmed by options - Grinder & Machine [400-450 EUR],"**Background**  
I started making my own coffee when I got married to my wife five years ago, and since then, I’ve been making it for both of us. We went from the terrible instant variety to pre-ground coffee for a moka pot, then received a Dolce Gusto machine as a gift, got a blade grinder that we used for filter coffee and French press, and finally invested in a budget ceramic burr grinder with an AeroPress (for a stronger, espresso-like coffee). Now, I’d like to try making espresso and espresso-based milk drinks at home.

**Use Case**  
I’d like to make 2–3 espressos a day, mostly for lattes. I don’t have a lot of time in the mornings, so I’d prefer a stable routine after I get my preferences and settings dialed in. My palate isn’t particularly refined, so I’m not sure I’d notice subtle differences—marginal gains aren’t worth significant extra effort or expense for me. Also, I suspect that milk would likely mask minor flaws in the espresso that might otherwise be noticeable. I’m an electrical engineer, so tinkering with machines and modding them is an option. I live in the EU (Croatia), where certain brands are less accessible, and the used market isn’t very active. I’ve decided to invest in a good grinder and espresso machine. I would prefer if they would last (I don't believe I will be upgrading in a few years). I’m just overwhelmed by the options and the costs involved, which are a considerable investment for my family and me. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

**Grinder**  
I have been leaning toward the Baratza Encore ESP, as it can handle both espresso and occasional filter/AeroPress brews. However, I’ve read that it might have longevity issues and that the SK40 and DF54 might be better choices. My grinder budget is around 200 EUR, and I’d prefer an electric grinder if possible for the sake of time and convenience. But if you think a hand grinder would be a better value for my limited budget, I’m open to suggestions.

**Machine**  
I’m even less certain about which espresso machine to choose. Here are the options I’m considering:

* I could get a Dedica (EC685) for around 170 EUR, but I’d probably need to buy a bottomless portafilter for the best results, which would likely be another 50 EUR. There are many DeLonghi machines available in stores and consequently, a lot of them are available second-hand (saw a good condition Dedica EC680 for 50 EUR).
* There’s a second-hand, modded Gaggia Classic with an added PID available for around 280 EUR. It seems to be in good condition, but this would be at the high end of my budget.
* I also found a second-hand Gaggia Espresso Color for around 50 EUR, which I could potentially mod with a PID, change the OPV spring, etc.
* I could get a Flair Neo (not the Flex) for around 150 EUR, but it doesn’t have a steam wand. It might also be challenging to pull back-to-back shots if I want to make multiple espressos. However, I’m considering that the lack of a pump might mean better durability.
* The Bambino isn’t very accessible here, and Sage machines in general are hard to find (aside from the Barista Express).

Is it so wrong to lie to your wife when you're trying to give her one perfect morning?

Sarah’s hands trembled as she poured her coffee. ""That's strange,"" she said, staring at her fingers. ""Maybe too much caffeine.""

No matter what, I couldn’t let her know.

""You’ve been working too hard,"" I lied, taking the pot from her. ""Sit down. I’ll make breakfast.""

""My hands don’t shake like this,"" she murmured, frowning at her reflection in the window. ""And my eyes look… off. Maybe I should call Dr. Mitchell.""

No matter what, I couldn’t let her make that call.

""The light’s just strange in here,"" I said, casually unplugging her phone. ""Hey, remember how we always talked about a real breakfast together? No phones, no rush?""

I made her favorite—blueberry pancakes with real maple syrup, the expensive kind we’d saved for our anniversary next month.

There wouldn’t be a next month.

“What’s the occasion?” She smiled, but her pupils were already starting to dilate. Stage two.

“Just because I love you.” That, at least, was true.

She tried to stand, then stumbled. “I feel dizzy.”

“Probably low blood sugar. Sit. Eat.” I caught her arm, guiding her back. “Remember our first date? That awful diner with the burnt coffee?”

She laughed, but winced at the sound. Sensitivity to noise. Stage three. “You drank it anyway.”

“Because you looked beautiful in the morning light.” I touched her cheek, checking her temperature. Too warm.

No matter what, I couldn’t let her see the news.

They’d announced it last night. The coffee fungus that had jumped species. No symptoms for 24 hours—then tremors, dilated pupils, sound sensitivity. Death within hours. Ninety percent of coffee drinkers were already infected.

Sarah had her last cup yesterday morning.

""Tell me about your dreams again,"" I whispered, holding her as the tremors worsened. ""The ones about our little house by the sea.""

She did, her voice fading, describing waves against a shore she’d never see. Her words grew fainter until she fell asleep in my arms. One last time.

I looked at the half-empty coffee pot.

We’d always planned to go together someday, in a distant future we thought we had. The house by the sea. Watching the sunrise. A quiet, shared end.

I poured myself a cup, letting its warmth seep into my hands.

1go2odn,https://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/1go2odn/thoughts_from_a_newbie_in_melbourne/,Thoughts from a newbie in Melbourne ,"
So it’s been about a month since I moved to Melbourne on a working holiday and I know that I’m supposed to be ranting with this flair so here goes:

- I’ve been having a fark of a time getting a decent job (or any job at all)

- myki system is super weird and way too expensive (and some AOs act like they peaked in grade school

- eating out costs 2 legs and a nipple

- sometimes scary junkies who want to eat my other nipple after the aforementioned meal while walking on Elizabeth st

- too windy sometimes

But at the end of the day, I really, really enjoy this city. I’ve been to 50 cities maybe and Melbourne is comparatively still dope as. I know a lot of you like to shit on yourselves, but a Melbourne local once taught me a term years ago in a land far, far away, and that term is ‘good kunt’.

So far, I’ve met a whole lot of good kunts gallivanting across the city. Great ones, even.

You have a beautiful city, nice big parks, thriving alternative niche scenes, great street art, dope food and coffee, cool museums, decent beaches, public transport that works (for the most part) and also, a bunch of good kunts. Pretty cool if you ask me.

I’m obviously new and maybe I’ll be jaded in a year or two, but I’ve traveled a fair bit and it’s always interesting to go back home with a new perspective, so here’s a perspective from an outsider that maybe makes you feel better about living here (I know most of you love living here but sometimes we forget to appreciate things when we’re stressed with every day life) 

So don’t forget to walk outside tomorrow and smile at all the good kunts walking around you (and even at the not so good kunts because they may need it even more)

You’re a legend. Thanks for having me and being so welcoming and friendly! I know immigrants are creating a lot of problems, and I want to contribute to that as little as possible, but man I’m already thinking of actually moving here. Don’t hurt me! 

Melbourne really wasn’t what I expected.

It’s way cooler.

Recently spent four days in New Orleans and didn't love it. On paper, it's everything I look for in a city. Walkable, cool architecture, restaurant scene, a unique vibe. However, just sharing some thoughts:

The French Quarter was quite dirty, and there were a lot of homeless. Most research online mentioned to 'avoid Bourbon street', but I actually found the majority of the area to be dirty. People recommended to explore Royal Street and Chartrese for less party and more galleries/shops, but it still didn't feel that...special? The gas lamps were very pretty. 

Tons of restaurants - some were good, some were not. The food in New Orleans is quite heavy and I found it difficult to find diverse options beyond cajun & creole. I know that there is a large Vietnamese population - I google'd some highly ranked Vietnamese restaurants and went to one in the Lower Garden District that was super meh. I love a good southern biscuit in the morning and kept striking out! I had a nice drink at Cane & Table (recommend) and spoke with the bartender about having trouble finding good breakfast. He mentioned that NO isn't a great breakfast town - too many people hungover to really care about breakfast, and hard to find good service jajajaj - I would say that my experience coincides with his thoughts.

The tree canopy is gorgeous - however, I wouldn't say that the gorgeous neighborhoods of NO are any more gorgeous than other neighborhoods I've seen in US cities. The streetcar down St. Charles IS awesome and beautiful.

On a personal note, I love coffee and there weren't many cool, 3rd wave coffee shops like you'll find in Portland, LA, Seattle, NYC, etc.

In general I don't love a party atmosphere - you can get away from most of the party if you leave the FQ, but it is still a vibe that permeates the city. 

Always glad to experience new places - but of the more dense, walkable cities in the US, New Orleans is toward the bottom of the list for me. What are your opinions on the city?",7,1731251047.0,travel,23,0.59,False

I am 15 weeks out from my Marathon, and 4 weeks out from my Half.  My long run today was 10 miles.

I got 2 miles in and felt like something wasn't right, I could feel my left ankle starting to stiffen up.  I figured it was just from early start or not warning up properly and that it would loosen up.

At 2.5mi though something clicked and I decided I would loop back, if I got home and felt okay, I would do the same Out n Back again to finish the run.

Boy howdy, I am glad I turned around when I did.  I was able to run the whole 5 miles, and even another .5 juuusst to check.  But the ankle was really bugging me and so I called it.

Once I stopped running, I stretched out and went inside poured some coffee and sat down.  When I stood up 5 minutes later, I could barely walk, that calf and ankle are just super seized up. 

I am icing and rolling it gently. It's getting better.  But man am I glad I bailed on the run when I did.  It was worse than I knew, but hopefully I will be able to resume training after a few days off and stick to my goals.

**Training**

I started preparing on June 1st this year. In June, I ran a 10 km race to assess my fitness and prepare for a half-marathon in September. I didn't have a strict plan, just tried to stay in shape by training 3-4 times a week.

In August, I reviewed several plans online and created my own, adding specific distances for long runs on Sundays. The half-marathon helped set benchmarks for the marathon. I also participated in a 10 km race at the end of September to gauge my progress. The key for me were three long runs of 30, 32, and 34 kilometers.

In October, I completely gave up coffee, cola, and alcohol. I decided to run in new Vomero 17 shoes, breaking them in beforehand.

**Pre-race**

The night before, I had a pasta feast and went to the hotel early to prepare my gear and relax. However, I still fell asleep quite late.

I woke up early to the sound of rain. Despite the lack of sleep, I felt good. I had oatmeal, black tea with sugar, and a biscuit for breakfast, then headed outside. The rain had almost stopped, but I kept my raincoat on for warmth.

At 7 AM, a ferry took us to the starting point, which began at 9. Half an hour before the start, I took L-carnitine for moral support due to a minor heart issue. Fifteen minutes before the start, I ate an SIS gel.

My cluster was C. I found two pacemakers for 3:45 and 4:10. The pacers were standing randomly, but they were easy to spot.

**Race**

At the beginning, there was a bridge that became slippery due to the rain. Strong gusts of wind tried to tear off our bib numbers, so we had to hold them. The first five kilometers were run on adrenaline and were more hilly.

It was hard to pick up speed. Several times, the 3:45 pacer caught up with me, and I had to speed up. Once my legs got used to it, I watched my pace to avoid running too fast. I planned to maintain a pace of 5:10 per kilometer.

I decided to take gels every five kilometers, carrying seven in total. Towards the end, I didn't feel like eating, only drinking water from the volunteers.

At the 13th kilometer, I matched pace with a runner who had a steady 5:05 pace, and we ran together for 7-8 kilometers. At the 27th kilometer, my ankle started to hurt, so I tried to shift the load to the other leg. After the 30th kilometer, a strong headwind began, slowing my pace to 6 minutes per kilometer.

At the 39th kilometer, I realized I wouldn't make it in 3:40, but I tried to stay positive and enjoy the run. The last kilometers were uphill, and I focused on not stopping. Towards the end, markers appeared every 100 meters. When the course leveled out and there were 150 meters left, I pushed my speed to the maximum.

**Post-race**

Removing the chip was tough, but not painful; my legs didn't want to bend. In the finish area, they offered free massages, but I headed to my hotel and used a massage ball on my legs. The next day, my foot hurt a bit after a long walk, but overall, I felt good.

I enjoyed the experience, despite a few minor mistakes. The main goals were achieved: I ran the marathon at a good pace, didn't walk, and didn't feel exhausted at the finish, breaking the sub-4-hour mark.

In the future, I want to run another marathon, but for now, I'll focus on training to improve my endurance and speed.

I’m wondering if anyone else has done anything to help “keep an eye” on their parents and know that they are ok?

As an additional point, yes we did get a proper “life alert” kind of system for her with professional monitoring so if she has an issue she doesn’t have to depend on just us and HomeAssistant (because maybe we’re away on vacation in a completely different time zone).

Looking for other ideas of things to instrument which can basically “passively” monitor normal activity levels.  So, for example, there is one mmWave sensor in her main family room she hangs out in, a PIR at the entry to her kitchen, and a PIR near the stairs in her home.  Each has a corresponding countdown timer helper that is restarted with every trigger of the sensor and if the timer runs down to zero, we start getting alerts.

I’ve also thought about doing this with Zigbee bulbs, and how HA would be able to see them going from Unavailable status to On whenever she turns on a light switch.  I’d also thought about a water flow monitor as being a great way to passively monitor activity as well because everyone needs water - to make coffee, brush teeth, flush a toilet, etc.

Any other interesting “passive” monitoring ideas anyone can think of?  We deployed the mmWave/PIR setup in July and so far it is working very well.",7,1731250121.0,homeassistant,11,1.0,False

* Paint the wall behind the tv unit a burgundy color 
* Add a ladder bookshelf or a fancy plant shelf that frames the tv unit?
* More burgundy-ish throw pills (unsure whether to go for a design-y one, or more velvet solid)

Questions:

1. What sort of coffee table should I go for? I'm thinking a **glass tabletop** so it doesn't look so busy and opens it up, and also a **round/oval** one to cut down on all the lines and straight edges and improve flow whilst walking between the tv and couch

2. Any ideas how I can incorporate end/side tables with my couch and rug? The couch is 11ft long, and the rug is 12ft, so the end tables would be half on/half off the rug. I could go for super thin ones, but I think those would look too ""space saving-y"" when the only reason I'm ""saving space"" is to fit onto the rug. I don't think moving the couch such that one side is fully on and the other fully off would look good, as the tv unit is centered with the couch and rug. I could go for some end tables that allow leg adjustments, so one leg is shorter than the other?

People often ask me if you can visit loved ones on the other side if you have control over the spirit walk. The short answer is yes. I have visited the dead on many occasions. 

Now come all the questions:

No I have never visit someone else’s loved ones. I don’t have medium like abilities. I’m not entirely sure if I believe that mediums can do any of that as I am fully aware of cold reading and that this is a subject with a lot of fakers. But honestly who am I to talk being someone claiming the things I do. 

The dead are still there and maybe some people connect with them differently than I do. Me personally I can’t do things on the other side that don’t have powerful meaning and intent on my part. I would never be able to seek out someone else’s loved  one unless I let was part of something much bigger than I.

What’s it like? 

Well you have to remember that once you leave your body you are pure consciousness imprinted on a field of sorts. Even the concept of something being visual is simply a habit we have from physical life. It’s necessary because it puts things into context for us. This is why everyone is a little different. But you will notice that themes become objective as they are experienced in similar ways by many people. 

The sequence.

Upon death, you will experience the typical OBE. You will float out of your body and be observing your surroundings. Just as we do projecting. 

The next few typical occurrence don’t seem to have a particular order, but maybe they do. I have never died, so I don’t really know. But all that I have talked to have the same themes.

Loved ones and beings of light come to make the transition more tolerable. There is often a bright light and a feeling of incredible warmth. If you read my other entry. “My origin story” you will see I had this experience when I was a boy. Though I wasn’t dying. But many thousands of people that have had NDEs report it. 

Tunnel. The light is usually at the end of a tunnel of some sort and sometimes the light can look like a deity to some people. It depends on expectations and culture. Secular people usually just see light.  The tunnel represents transition and moving to another state.  

There is a life review. “My life flashes before my eyes.” This is a common saying upon being close to death because it happens. You review your entire life and it happens in what seems like moment. 

The infirmary. This is where it gets interesting. If you read some of my other entries, I have been to the infirmary a number of times.  I must warn you. The infirmary is the inspiration for Hell or purgatory. Of course it’s neither of those things, but it can seem awfully close for some people. 

The infirmary is a state. Now I and many others see it as a building or a place, but you have to remember these are not real buildings or structures in that sense. It’s our minds again placing It into context. Being a sate, you don’t have do be dead to have part of yourself residing in the infirmary. I know weird right? I’ll get to that some other time, but I have an example in one of my teller entries where I was given a task. 

The infirmary is where we all…well most of us go to deal with our internal conflicts and part of that for most people also includes the fact that they just died. All
of us have things that we struggled with, and won’t accept or that we have done and have to come to terms with ourselves. When the veil drops away and we are left with our true self it can be quite disturbing. 

Thar disturbing reconciliation is manifested as reality in the infirmary. The Veil of your ego drops away and your environment manifests it in ways that can be quite disturbing. You can imagine having lived a bad life and being forced do come to terms with it. Some people stay in the infirmary for a very long time and do manifest hell for themselves. 

You can also imagine being elderly and being in a mental state where death is welcomed and natural and you have already come to terms with your conflicts and you are ready for what comes next. These people spend little or no time there.

Incidentally you can experience the veil dropping here in the Physical. some Mushrooms and some cactus’s can get you there. Wink wink. There is a reason magic mushrooms are now used as thereby for the dying. 

Regardless of whether you get the work done here or there. You will have to get it done. You can’t be free floating around the other side until you do. It’s not something you can avoid. You will sink there eventually.

But not to worry. No one is stuck there for ever. Even the worst people will eventually reconcile with their life. It may take thousands of years, but as I  am told, they will eventually work it out. 

Your next questions should be who is telling me this? 

Well there are beings of light there. Angels if you will. They seem to be agents of the light.  They are not human. I see them as beautiful humans. But they are tall. Elf like. They wear white robes and have a soft glow about their face and head. Yes they have halos! No shit! Their faces are beautiful but a little distorted. I can’t really explain it, but it’s like their forehead is to big and their eye are a little to far apart or something. Anyway these are just my visuals. It’s how my personal context distinguishes between human and not human. Most non human entities that appear human to me that don’t have physical representations somewhere have this small distortion. 

They assist in the in the infirmary. So if you can spirit walk with some proficiency. You should never go to the infirmary without an invite. Again read some of my other entries. The souls there are self tormented and they will reach for you and attach to you because they are seeking relief and don’t know how to find it yet. Imagine the worst kind of old folks home where elderly people are screaming for help and trying to reach you. It’s like that. 

They are in a state of psychosis and it can be very very disturbing when they come for you if you are not prepared or have an invite from the beings of light. The beings of light (BOL) have a way of keeping them off you if they want you to be there and visit. 

Experienced shaman have ways of navigating this place and they can come and go, but unless you have those skills, it’s not a place to visit unless invited. 

What next?

Most infirmary visits should be fairly short the BOLs are there helping people and your manifested internal conflicts will solve themselves.

You are free. 

After that you are free to manifest what ever you want. Visit whoever you want. You can love a lifetime with your true love in a cabin by a creek. Have coffee with old friends. etc etc. He’ll have a party if you want. 

When I used to visit my father he was always fishing with an old friend or hanging out with his first wife. ( Not my mother). I was surprised to no see my brothers (both passed), so i asked about them. One was still working on things in the infirmary and the other had moved on. It is a shame but it seems the timing isn’t always right to hang out with everyone. We are all on a journey and even after we are dead sometimes those paths don’t cross anymore. At least on this level.

The Beyond. Just like in the infirmary after being free for a while people decide they have lived everything they wanted in total freedom, and they decide to take the next step. 

So this is where my investigation ends. I can speculate as to what happens next, but I don’t know. Up until this point what i am writing about comes from direct experience and inquiry. Not even the  BOLs know what is across that ocean. Somehow, at some point, everyone seems to feel a calling and then cross. 

I was there with my father. He summoned me there at the shores of the ocean and we didn’t talk, but I knew I was not going to be able to follow him to see what comes next. then he started walking. Being stubborn I started walking with him. He somehow just walked faster than I could. He just sort of moved away and disappeared on the horizon. I stoped walking and flew after him. But the ocean just kept going. It goes on forever. I can’t find an end to it. 

I have been back several times and I can’t figure it out. 

What is in the other other side? Reincarnation? Unification with the source and the light? Melding into the bulk? I just don’t know. It’s beyond my pay grade. 

That’s it. That’s what happens when you die. I’m as sure about as I am anything else. To me it’s not a mystery until the ocean.

A woman passed by and stopped for a moment. She walked over to my window, and I thought, ""*Here we go again, the god squad.*""

She smiled at me and said, ""I'm going to Quartier Poutain for breakfast. Can I get you anything?""

Wow. Honestly, this simple act of kindness lifted me to the fucking heavens. I said yes. I tried to hand her money, but she shook it off. I was even pushing twenty euros in her face, and she wouldn't take it. 

She came back with a coffee and a toasted cheese sandwich. Her kindness overcame me so much that I didn't even get her name.

Everytime she's going to her friends for a coffee I get a feeling of jealousy which I haven't had in previous relationships.

She's on her phone a lot but only watching reels and messaging friends I  know her passwords also if I ever wanted to check messages and stuff but I dont because I trust her, but recently she's hid her active status on instagram just after we had a falling out a couple of weeks ago.

Like I said something just feels off, I have brought up her been on her phone a lot before and she gets defensive saying she's always been like it and I'm making her feel guilty like her ex for saying she's in her phone(her ex was a cheating manipulative arsehole) and I feel shit getting compared to him so I don't bring it up anymore.

I just don't know what to do I want to stay with this girl because I love her so much but at the same time the feeling of jealousy and uncertainty gets too overwhelming sometimes.

1go1zga,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1go1zga/incredibly_depressed_lately/,Incredibly Depressed Lately,"Hi All,

I'm writing this as a way to get a lot off my chest. I'm sitting here in a coffee shop enormously depressed; I'm surprised I even found the energy to get to the coffee shop this morning, but I couldn't sleep a lick last night so I figured I'd get up and do something as opposed to laying in bed tossing and turning while not sleeping.

To give you some background, I'm a 35-year-old single male, never married, no kids. I grew in a wonderful household, with great parents and an amazing younger brother. My extended family is incredible as well. This is all to say that I have a great support system, and am fortunate that I avoided any sort of dysfunction that some families have. But along these lines, I'm wondering where I went wrong, and where I go from here. The rest of my cousins are married with kids, and I just went to a beautiful wedding last night of one of my younger cousins. I put on a happy face, but deep down inside I was absolutely miserable.

On the outside, I have a good amount going for me. I pursued multiple degrees and postgrad, and today have a coveted job where I make over $500k a year. But it all feels empty anymore, I wake up with literally zero motivation to live out the day ahead.

Growing up through high school, I was very shy and introverted. I broke out of my shell in college and loved it. But it wasn't until right after I graduated that I started getting any attention from girls. I was a virgin until the year after I graduated college. Mostly because of a lack of interest from girls, but the other force at play was my Catholic upbringing and my extreme fear of having sex and getting a girl pregnant at a young age whilst not being married. It was an irrational fear, but that didn't make it any less in my head. In fact, my first year out of college I began hanging out with a popular group of people I knew from a few friends and ended up dating one of the girls in the group who I believed to be out of my league. It only lasted a year but it completely devastated me when she broke up with me basically because I was too scared to have sex with her. Crazy, I know, but my parents, especially my dad, are incredibly important to me and I always operated in a way to never disappoint them; they mean the world to me.

Fast forward after that, I took a few years to concentrate on my career and pursue postgrad, and then have basically been single ever since with brief periods of girlfriends. Throughout my mid-to-later 20's I got a lot of attention from women, something I had never been used to. But for some reason, I would never date for a while. I am at heart, introverted, so I think my lack of communication really ruined a lot of potential relationships. In high school, I was painfully shy, and I think that really had a traumatic effect on me. I think deep down, I have a very poor opinion of myself because of those years and intrinsically find a woman to be less attractive if they are attracted to me. Which brings me to the latest.

A year ago, my company let me work remotely so I moved 1,000 miles away to a city I had visited a lot during COVID that I really liked. Basically a much warmer place than where I'm from. I wanted a fresh start. I think in a way I was running away from responsibilities to a certain extent. I have a large network of family and friends in my home city, so there would often be a lot of events that I would feel obligated to attend. Attending these got to a point where it was excruciating; I would be the old single guy whereas all my family and friends would be there with their wives and kids. I felt like people looked at me as if I had three eyes. It just was incredibly awkward and I did not enjoy it one bit.

Fast forward to today, and while I love the new city where I live and how physically active I am, I'm learning that the same issues have followed me, and even worse I hardly have any family or friends there so dating is tough as I don't have a rich social life here.

During this time, I have been keeping in touch with a girl from back in my home city that I didn't realize how much I truly liked. I had asked her to coffee this weekend as I'm back in town for my cousin's wedding but she told me she now has a boyfriend; I was absolutely crushed. My stomach has been in knots the whole weekend. I feel truly alone.

At the very least, I'm starting to realize I need to grow up. Like I said, I have a good job, but I've stopped going out and drinking and have given up gambling, something I have used as a crutch the last few years. During the last few years when I have been drinking heavier on the weekends and gambling, it really didn't bother me being single as I was preoccupied with these vices. I'd work all week, and then when I had the brief amount of free time that I do, I'd fill it with these vices. Now, I'm realizing that I truly need to get my act together. This realization has really weighed on my mental pysche as I've realized the time and opportunities I've wasted. Losing the woman recently that I had thought I would eventually start something with hit me like a ton of bricks. But I need to grow up and really act like a man, instead of waiting for the woman to really initiate. I have been too immature and I think it all relates back to my elementary/high school years when I was short and scrawny and felt nothing like a real boy. I have always felt inadequate.

ChatGPT said:



In the quiet hours, past midnight's mark,

A programmer codes in the dim and dark.

With eyes that gleam and fingers that race,

They work in silence, lost in the trace.



The world asleep, but their screen aglow,

In lines of logic, they come to know

How loops and queries, functions and strings,

All weave together like living things.



The coffee's cold, the clock ticks on,

As code cascades until dawn's first yawn.

Bugs emerge like shadows to fight,

But they soldier on, deep into night.



At 3 a.m., there's progress at last—

The code compiles, the errors pass.

But new ideas spark, unplanned, unbidden,

A puzzle found where none was hidden.



By 5 a.m., they're weary, worn,

Eyes bloodshot, soul battle-torn.

Yet passion fuels them, line by line,

In algorithms they find the divine.



And finally, as morning breaks,

The code complete, no more mistakes.

They lean back, drained, but satisfied,

With dawn's pale light their silent guide.



At 8 a.m., they close the screen,

A weary victor, seldom seen.

In code, they lived through the night alone,

A quiet world they'd made their own.

​It is hard where to begin writing after three intense weeks in the southwestern United States.

I could write about how America is a paradise but with profound problems, such as tragically crazed people walking the streets in Los Angeles and San Francisco – not just talking to themselves but shouting. We have homeless people too, but on nothing like the same scale re gravely mentally ill people on the streets.

I could write the US still being the world’s technological capital and the driverless cars that taxied me to places. This was the most hi-tech assisted trip I have ever made. I did almost everything on my smartphone: ordering Uber rides, meals, booking hotels, flights and paying for my coffees. I say that as someone who found setting up smartphones and downloading apps so tedious and at times complex that for years I didn’t even bother trying to grapple with methods of communication that I now find indispensable such as WhatsApp.
I could write about the weather, 20 Celsius to 26 C (70 to 80 Fahrenheit) daily with blue skies everywhere I went in California, Nevada and Arizona. But in high summer these places are becoming dangerously hot (Phoenix Arizona had 70 days this year over 110F, with regular July highs of 118F, approaching 50C).

I could talk about infrastructure and resulting productivity in the US that puts it far ahead of ​Northern Ireland (where barely a politician seems to consider that NI might only need one major hub airport, linked to by motorways, as a minor counterpoint to Dublin instead of our all-things-to-all-men three airports, including now permanent subsidies for City of Derry).

I could write about how much of the older America that I remember with such happiness as a young child in the 1970s is still there. And how much of it is gone.

I could expand on how being in America reminds you of its phenomenal ongoing and enduring entrepreneurial spirit, yet how even America is falling prone to work-shyness and a culture in which managers are afraid to manage.

And I could write about how this trip reminded me of the enduring, but subconscious and almost forgotten, cultural links and similarities between Ulster Protestants and the Scots Irish – both the good side of its individualistic Protestant spirit and the increasingly evident dependent, bad side.

I could examine multiple aspects of the return of Donald Trump, who as I said in columns on Monday past and on Saturday October 19 was favourite to win this contest, even when Kamala Harris was ahead.
About how foolish the Democrats were to endorse a diversity hire for president – chosen as a woman of colour – when the party needed to connect with an anxious and shrinking white, middle America that deeply resents so-called ‘positive discrimination’.

About the staggering hypocrisy of Mr Trump who was implying fraud against him in the election campaign but now says not a word about cheating, a man whose refusal to concede the last election contrasts with the grace of Mrs Harris in defeat.

But in the space I have left in this column I want to draw open some lessons unionists can draw from Mr Trump’s win.
The first is that unionists can be more assertive, and less apologetic, without aping Trump’s unique style.

We are not in the same situation as Mr Trump in that a 50%+ unionist share of the NI vote is now hard to imagine. And we have a system of mandatory coalition about which the NI unelected elites are only concerned insofar as unionists might ever block things, never about the disastrous fact that a party committed to the destruction of NI has to be in power at all times. A party that is never properly challenged by successive UK governments.

But being nice is not working. It is making unionists seem weak. Being nasty won’t work either, but confident critiques can be built of of things that we might not be able to stop, such as the increasingly sectarian use of Irish.

We should also to know when displays of controlled outrage might be effective. I can think of no more obvious topic than the IRA still enjoying legacy largely on its own terms. Could you imagine America accepting for five seconds Islamist extremists and their helpers being allowed to drag through US police and military through the courts at US taxpayer expense for their far tougher response Muslim terror than our own fair-to-the-point-of-lily-livered Troubles response to the IRA?
We could consider how the woke extremism that is so embedded in the liberal consensus at Stormont and the NGOs has been rejected by American voters. There were signs of its rejection in NI in the Westminster election too when a noticeable chunk of voters edged away from Alliance in East Belfast and North Down, and the unionist overall vote pulled back ahead of nationalists.

We might reflect on how Trump’s jump in support among Hispanics and blacks shows that decline is not inevitable, no matter how many times the BBC publicises the republican ‘new Ireland’ project. New Ireland? I’ll take the old one thank you, which would not have indulged the increasingly mainstream Ooh ah up the Ra chants.

Meanwhile, Ireland has again placed itself on the far side of a cultural divide to America on global affairs, above all Israel. Unionists, like much of the UK establishment, are closer to Washington’s thinking post the October 7 mass murder of Jews by Hamas.

Unionists can, alone as seems likely, argue against the cultural problems with out-of-control immigration and multiple hotels being used to house the influx at a time of public services shortages.

Unionists have to be careful how this is done as not to alienate groups potentially sympathetic to unionism. But they will win respect for being firm if they are also friendly.
In my reports from Trump rallies, I tried to convey how he has a certain charm that lets him get away with outrageous rhetoric. ​I still don’t like him. But he has zoned in on fraught issues where naive liberals have failed badly.",0,1731248669.0,northernireland,10,0.1,False

This is the first time we went there with my parents who just turned 60. It was my father's bday and we planned to celebrate his post bday there and one of the places we visited was in Botanical garden and had some coffee. I gave his senior citizen discount for his coffee and to my surprise they do not want to honor the discount. Their reason was something about their coffee was outsourced which exempts them to give senior citizen discount. It was so frustrating, but decided to let it go since it was a small discount and the 20% discount is not worth the fight. 

After finishing our drinks, we left the place and tried again to ask if they have senior citizen discount/benefit for parking. I was surprised that they don't offer it as well. The parking attendant gave excuses that it is only available for the driver citizen of Baguio which got me a little bit frustrated. 

I would have understood if they just said they're a small business and can't afford giving discount instead of making up excuses.

I started this crazy idea back in 2020. My friend was going through some issues, and since I couldn't be there with him, I wanted to cheer him up. So, we played 100% survival mode for the first time. After months, I jokingly suggested building a city. That was 4 years ago... I only play when I have the time, so I think I might have finished by now if I played more.

That said, I was inspired by Floor 1 of Sword Art Online and decided to name the city Arcadia. Some friends have been nudging me to share my work, so here it is.

Currently, I'm working on the interior of the Black Iron Palace, which was largely inspired by an old SAO project that was canceled (credits to Zekern0001 and Myshowbro2508).

Here are the current builds: (The walls Square Central square Sugar cane farm Leblanc Coffee Black Iron Palace)

I still have quite a few ideas to add, including: (Iwatodai Dorm, Paulownia Mall, Mooney's Bookstore, commercial square and a church)

My friend helps me gather materials whenever possible and I'm just the one placing the blocks. Honestly, I don't think it would be possible without him. We've been through so much together in-game, always working on this labor while laughing through it, despite life's challenges. I genuinely want to finish this map.

# Morning: Starting Together

You wake up slowly to the warm sunlight filling the room, wrapped up in the cozy layers of your bed. As you stretch, you feel your partner gently pull you closer, both of you lingering in this quiet, comfortable moment. These soft, slow mornings have become a favorite part of your routine together—a few minutes to just be close, talk about the plans for the day, and exchange sleepy smiles and laughter.

After getting up, you both head to the kitchen to make breakfast together, moving easily around each other in your modern kitchen, familiar with each other’s habits and rhythms. You whip up a smoothie bowl while your partner makes coffee, and you chat about the day ahead. You both have your routines, but you enjoy starting the day this way, setting a positive tone before heading into your separate tasks.

Before you leave for the gym, your partner gives you a quick, encouraging hug, saying, ""Have a good workout—I’ll see you for lunch later!"" This small exchange energizes you as you set out.

# Mid-Morning: Your Personal Time and Productivity Boost

At the gym, you dive into a 45-minute workout, feeling stronger with each session. You’re working on building muscle and endurance, so you push yourself a bit further today. The workout is both challenging and rewarding, and you leave feeling accomplished, energized, and ready for the day.

After a quick shower, you stop by a cozy, familiar cafe to get some work done. Sitting by the window, with a warm cup of tea and your laptop open, you lose yourself in your project. You’re developing a new communications strategy for an exciting client, and your focus flows naturally. This kind of productive solitude is something you’ve come to love—it’s calming yet purposeful, allowing you to channel your creativity.

As you work, a message from your partner pops up: “Can’t wait to see you for lunch—thinking about a little Italian place we haven’t tried?” You smile, knowing they love finding new spots for you to explore together. You respond with a simple, “Can’t wait!” and refocus, knowing you’ll soon be enjoying a shared moment.

# Lunch: Quality Time and Connection

At lunchtime, you meet your partner at a charming Italian cafe tucked away in a quieter part of the city. They’re already waiting at a table, looking up with that familiar, warm smile as you walk in. As you settle into your seats, the conversation flows effortlessly, a mix of jokes, interesting thoughts, and little stories from the morning.

You each order something different so you can share—your partner loves to try everything, and you’ve adopted that habit over time. The food is delicious, but the real highlight is the way you both laugh and lose track of time, talking about everything from plans for the weekend to a funny memory from your first dates. They reach across the table and take your hand for a moment, giving it a gentle squeeze. This small gesture reminds you of how connected you feel to each other, how these moments feel like your own little world, carved out of the busy day.

# Afternoon: Fulfilling Work and Little Check-Ins

After lunch, you both head back to work, energized by the time spent together. You dive into a few more productive hours, feeling focused and motivated. Your partner texts you a quick note about a funny thing that happened on their end, and it makes you smile—these little check-ins throughout the day keep the connection alive, no matter how busy life gets.

Later in the afternoon, you take a brief walk to clear your mind and stretch your legs, something your partner encouraged you to do for a little midday reset. You pass by a bookstore and think of a novel you’ve been meaning to share with them, so you pop in and pick up a copy. It’s a small surprise, but you know they’ll appreciate the thoughtfulness.

# Evening: Shared Rituals and Relaxation

You both wrap up your workdays around the same time and meet back at home. Your partner greets you at the door with a hug, as though you haven’t seen each other in days. The warmth in that embrace feels like a small, reassuring ritual—a signal that the busy part of the day is behind you, and now it’s time to unwind.

You spend some time cooking dinner together, moving easily around the kitchen as you chop veggies and season ingredients. The two of you have a shared playlist that you play in the background, filled with songs that have become ""yours"" over time. As you cook, your partner catches you up on their day in more detail, and you share highlights of yours. There’s an easy flow to this routine, a comfortable familiarity that makes you feel completely at home.

After dinner, you settle onto your green velvet couch with a glass of wine or tea, flipping through the book you bought earlier. You share a passage that made you laugh, and they chuckle, leaning in close as they listen. At some point, you put the book down and just sit together, maybe watching a movie or simply talking, exchanging dreams about the future and ideas for things you’d like to do together.

Before bed, your partner gives you a playful kiss on the forehead, and as you both climb into bed, they say something that makes you laugh again. It’s these little, intimate exchanges—small moments throughout the day—that make you feel truly connected. As you drift off, you feel deeply content, knowing you’re building a life with someone who not only supports you but enhances your joy, makes you laugh, and shares in your growth.

How did it go from us being so close, sharing everything, to him telling me it was over Now, it’s been 24 hours, and I’ve cried more in the past day than I have in the last six years combined. I’m at work, trying to keep my composure while I pull shots and make drinks, but every little thing reminds me of him. The way the milk froths, the sound of the coffee machine steaming, even the smell of vanilla syrup takes me right back to all the late-night talks we used to have. I can’t stop thinking about his voice, his laugh, his stupid little habits that I used to find endearing. It’s like my mind is haunted by him. I keep staring at my phone, at the picture of us on my wallpaper. My heart says take it down, it’s time, but I can’t do it. Not yet.

I lost my gay virginity last night. 

I’m M31, dated women and had a few girlfriends over the past 10 years. I’ve been single the past year and have enjoyed experimenting with my curiosities.  Crossdressing (thank you Amazon prime for discreet lingerie deliveries), playing with toys and browsing Grindr. 

Last night it finally happened. I’ve been on 4 dates with a fella from Grindr. Handsome, older, aged 61 and divorced. I like a daddy type.

 Coffee, walks on the beach, dinner. Last night we went out for food and went back to his for ‘coffee’. You know the rest, I won’t go into details (DM me if you want the details lol)

I (35F) work at a convenience store. There's usually only one of us per shift during the day. Always a cashier and stocker at night on each shift because no one is allowed to exit the building alone at closing time (per owner's orders). I normally get relieved by one coworker in particular, we'll call her Susan (58F). Now, every time I come in, there is a note from Susan with a list of things that I need to get done that I supposedly didn't do the day before (ex: fill cigarettes, clean slushy machine, fill coffee cups, etc.) Now, I do complete these tasks on my shift or at least check on these items to see if anything needs to be refilled. I have slight OCD so I could never just not do these things because it'll bug me knowing it was not done.

This morning, I come into work to open the store and there is a note waiting on the register with 5 things that I ""didn't do"", of course signed by Dear Susan (fill coffee cups--I did this twice actually, clean slushy machine because there was a little bit of liquid in the tray--I only sold 2 slushies and I cleaned it right after they left and stocked up some lids & straws, clean cappuccino machine--I did this a total of 7 times and restocked lids, creamer & cups because I was running low and it was a chilly day so I sold more coffee than usual, fill cigar wraps--this was done to the point where I had filled my trash can and instead of dumping it into the bigger trash can like she does, I tied the bag shut and replaced it with a new one. I could have left the full garbage can so she could see that I did it but then she would've complained about that, too. Lastly, my personal favorite, there is a stained drip mark from slushy mix on the counter next to the slushy machine so automatically, I didn't wipe down the counters--that stain has been there since I started working here over a year ago.)

When Susan leaves notes like this, I tell her to pull up the cameras so she can see that I did those things. Her excuse is always that I am younger so I should just get them done. I don't mind pulling my own weight or doing extra cleaning projects (it passes time when we get slow which rarely happens), but when I am constantly getting belittled or told that I don't do anything, I have a problem with pulling extra weight. 

Just a little context: I am currently 5.5 months pregnant and 2 months before I found out I was pregnant, my doctor told me that I have a meniscus injury in my knee (which is very painful especially when it swells but I don't let it stop me. I will still limp around and do my work and never sit down). When I first started this job, the nighttime stock guy told me that they have not been able to keep cashiers employed because of Susan. She has ran everyone off because she doesn't like ANYBODY but doesn't want to work the morning time hours that the other people are working. So, he pretty much was warning me to watch my back around her because she will try to get me fired.

I can't complain to the manager because she just ignores it and does the job she's paid to do. Susan has been here for 10 years so complaining about her behavior and lack of work ethic is just pointless. Even the owner says things like ""Well, everyone has to do their part"" when I say something about being told that I'm doing nothing. It's like even if you give them evidence that you have done the tasks that are expected of you, they still believe her word over evidence. There's a long list of much more but we would be here all day if I wrote it all down lol.


I'm just counting down the days til my fiancé gets his testing done for his business license and I can quit this job.

Thank you for listening to my rant. I just needed to vent and although my fiancé tells me that he's always willing to listen if I just need to vent and get it off my chest, I hate bothering him with my petty job.",23,1731247979.0,coworkerstories,16,0.97,False
