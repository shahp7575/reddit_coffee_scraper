I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills üòÖ But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats ü§§

- Aside from the first trimester when I was in the throes of morning sickness, I had 1-2 cups of coffee almost every single day. Spoke about this with my OB. 
- I took Tylenol PM semi regularly in the 3rd trimester to help with my headaches and get to sleep. Also spoke about this with my OB.
- I gained 47 lbs throughout my pregnancy and constantly got shit for my weight gain from my OB, although my tests were never concerning and I remained very healthy. I‚Äôm currently 25 lbs down just from giving birth, breastfeeding, and stroller walks with my baby. Please don‚Äôt sweat the weight gain (I guess unless there‚Äôs some medical issue.)
- I went in a hot tub when I was on vacation at around 20 weeks, although it wasn‚Äôt very hot. 
- I slept on my back throughout my pregnancy unless it became uncomfortable.

My husband and I will be in Ireland end of September. I want to preface this with while we know this is busy, we‚Äôre coming to Ireland to explore the scenery and mingle with locals - we love a relaxing vacation, but we will save that for another trip. This is our current (very detailed) plan:

Day 1
Land 10am, pick up car, early check into hotel, Trinity College Library/Book of Kells, Guinness Tour, end at Cobblestone

Day 2
Kilkenny Castle, St Canice Cathedral and Roundtower, Rock of Cashel (have been advised to have lunch here also), Cahir Castle (only if we have time), drive to Cork, dinner at Elbow Lane Brew and Smokehouse, Sin E for drinks/music

Day 3
English Market for coffee and snacks for the day, Blarney Castle by 930am, then onto Mizen Head Bridge/walk, Barley Cove beach stroll, Hackett‚Äôs Pub, stay in Schull

Day 4
Ring of Beara - focus on Healy Pass/optional Hungry Hill hike weather/time permitting, Dzogchen Buddhist Temple on the terrace for coffee and cake, Allihie‚Äôs Loop, Eyeries, Ardgroom Stone Circle, end at Airbnb in Tuosist. Undecided on dinner at An Sibin or go into Kenmare, will depend mostly on timing. 

Day 5
Uragh Stone Circle, Gleninchaquin Park. No other in-stone plans, keeping it open. If we have the energy for it, will do Gap of Dunloe. If not, probably chill in Tuosist and maybe go to No 35 in Kenmare for dinner and/ Roughty Bar. 
	
Day 6
Ring of Kerry - focus on Coomanaspig pass, Kerry Cliffs, Skellig Ring, Bray Head then head to Dingle. Dinner at Out of the Blue. Probably Dick Mack‚Äôs after.

Day 7
Coffee at My Boy Blue, then do Slea Head Drive. If weather is good, drive Conor Pass. Reel Dingle Fish and pubs after. 

Day 8
Hike Mount Brandon in the morning, Murphy‚Äôs Pub in Brandon afterward, then Dingle Distillery. 

Day 9
Drive to Cliffs of Moher. Most of the hiking trails are shut down so this won‚Äôt take more than 90 min. Then head back to Dublin. I know this is a long driving day. There‚Äôs no way around it.

Day 10

I (21F) am starting to work at a restaurant here in Sac soon, but it's about a 45 minute commute from home. This is not ideal for days where I have dinner plans in the city after an opening shift (which happens a few times a week). I'm torn between going home, showering, and driving to and from over and over, OR just roughing it and hanging out at a coffee shop and changing in my car... you get the jist. Not a fan of either option. 

I was thinking about getting a planet fitness black card membership so I can shower and change at my leisure, and even lay down in their little massage beds. I just want somewhere to /unwind/ for a bit (and not have to pay for anything like food, drinks, or parking). The problem here is it's sort of awkward to just... hang out at a family fitness for a few hours. I don't think I would super know what to do with myself, and there's not really a lounge. There's the pricey gyms that come with those lounge areas... but I can't afford them. 

I know people are going to recommend libraries, but I don't know the extent of which I could unwind at a library, and they close at 6, which could leave me stranded for a few hours after anyways. 

Any suggestions? A country club for The People I don't know about? A pay-by-the-hour room somewhere that isn't bug-infested? Let me know!

It's 4 in the morning and I feel like I'm losing my goddamn mind.

I've been having the same nightmare every night for exactly five years now. I had hoped the change of scenery might help me get my mind off of everything, but for the past couple of months it's been slowly... deteriorating. Tonight was special. Tonight it was so, so much worse.
Happy Fucking Anniversary.

The most immediate difference from the regular dream is the hardest one to describe. If the original dreams were like sitting alone in a dark, creepy movie theater, these ones had been like having a moldy View-Master fused to my skull. The scene was choppy and stilted, the images in my head looked like they had been covered in bacon grease and deep fried. Everywhere I looked seemed to writhe and twitch as if in agony, and some details kept changing on the peripherals of my vision.

The various cords and tubes almost seemed to be blossoming from the bed, constantly moving and melding together in an ever shifting latticework that seemed to encompass the cramped room. The screens displayed increasingly jumbled messes of numbers and lines, some of the smaller screens skittering around and changing size when I looked away.

Her skin constantly changed color and texture, going from leathery orange to sickly green and all the way back around to deathly pale. Her teeth crowded behind her emaciated lips, moving aggressively past each other like tourists late for their connecting flight, and the number of them kept changing. That I can no longer make out her garbled speech as she claws at an ever larger tumescent, shifting mass of flesh and hairs on her midsection is a blessing these days. This is where the dream usually ends, but tonight my torment had yet to reach its peak.

Suddenly there was a high pitched tone that threatened to split my head in two and the screens started flashing angrily. The cords shuddered and pulsed as distended lumps formed at the edges of the room and traveled down the quivering lines towards the pitiful creature in the bed. Her head slammed backwards into the headboard with a sickening crack as she convulsed in ways that shouldn't be possible for the human body. Her joints constantly shifted positions and angles, and at some points she had more or less than she should.

She sits up suddenly and reaches towards me, her emaciated arms crossing the distance impossibly fast as hordes of spiders with far too many limbs come pouring out of her mouth. Her mouth opens impossibly wide, row upon row of misshapen teeth revealing more of the same. The sounds of scuttling limbs is deafening and I don't even realize I'm awake and screaming until I have to stop to take a breath. The skittering doesn't die out with my voice.

If anything, the maddening scrabble of tiny legs seemed even louder now that I was awake.

I should have known something like this would happen today.

The rumbling, oppressively dark clouds that seemed to hang exclusively over my apartment building were a perfect mirror of my state of mind as I approached the front door. I had considered taking the day off, but the idea of explaining why to my nosy boss seemed too high a mountain to climb today. When I got home, however, I found myself blissfully alone. Ruth seemed to have gotten the message, for now, and Darla seemed to be keeping her own company. Sweet Pea was acting more entitled than usual, I actually had to bring her food bowl into the bathroom since she refused to leave, but she quietly kept to herself in the tub all night.

I stared down at the phone in my hand for a long time. I knew I had to feed myself, but the idea of talking to another person today seemed almost impossible. I relegated myself to raiding the fridge, and when I found the foil wrapped homemade blueberry pie sitting in the back I actually had the gall to think to myself, darkly, *Today must be my lucky day!*

I deserve everything that's happening to me right now.

God only knows what ingredients Ruth might have used, and that was before it had spent weeks at the back of the fridge. I have to admit it was delicious, but before I had even finished I was starting to see things.

I turned to look at a sound I was worried was Ruth unlocking my door, but something made me pause and look back towards the sink. It looked like my favorite mug was sitting precariously on the edge of the counter, the same mug whose shards I had plucked from my heel last night. I rubbed my eyes in disbelief, but when I looked again the counter was bare.

At the time, I thought I was just having a bad day. I always do on this particular day. I thought the guilt over losing the mug had been the straw that broke my back, and I had finally lost my mind. I thought about knocking on Darla's door and seeing if she wanted to wipe out the rest of the day together, hell we could even just go out to the movies. God help me, I even thought about going and talking to Ruth. Just unburdening my soul and dumping all of my woes at her feet.

Ultimately I decided none of it was worth the effort, the quicker I could sleep through the day the quicker it would be tomorrow.

The scuttling, skittering madness was so loud when I woke up I couldn't hear anything else. Clutching my hands tight to my ears to try to drown it out I stumbled towards the door to the bedroom. The moment my hand made contact with the doorknob the scratching cut out, leaving only the agitated grumbling of a looming storm. I don't even hear any of my neighbors through the paper-thin walls.

Stepping into the hallway I strained to hear anything over the sound of my own pounding heartbeat in my ears. I don't remember even turning the TV on today, yet the living room was once again awash in a cold blue glow that only made it seem lonelier, more claustrophobic. The piles of trash and sad, disheveled furniture seemed to be crowding me in, crushing me under the weight of so many nights spent circling the drain. I couldn't put my finger on it but something just seemed wrong, my home for some reason ringing false in my eyes. Unfamiliar. Unwelcoming.

My heart almost leaped straight up into my throat when my eyes locked onto the small ceramic cup sitting on the edge of the sink. It can't be the same mug that had gone down the trash chute before its time, but I don't own any others. The more I stared at it the more sure I was that it couldn't be the same. The handle on this one was a little smaller, and sat a bit too high. The text, which had fooled me on a quick glance, no longer said World's Greatest Dad. It no longer said anything, really, as the strange symbols only bore a passing resemblance to english letters. I had picked it up to get a closer look when suddenly it sprang to life in my hand.

It's hard to describe, but it kind of looked like the mug was a foil balloon that had been suddenly and violently deflated. The smooth, round ceramic slumped into hard edges and sharp points. It very briefly resembles a small, white tumbleweed before the center blossomed into innumerable thin, white needles that sank deep into the fleshy pad of my palm.

My favorite coffee cup had fucking bitten me.

I whipped my arm around reflexively, thankfully before it had gotten a good grip, and I felt a strip of skin tearing off as the little ceramic freak went sailing across the room. The sound it made when it smashed into the wall was absolutely exquisite, sending far more twitching ceramic legs than should have been possible spraying in all directions like a popped boil full of white-gloved fingers. That's when all hell broke loose, just as a flash of lightning from the kitchen window gave me my first good look at the room.

Suddenly, the apartment erupted into life, furniture and piles of trash shifting and twitching as the deafening sounds of tiny scurrying appendages swallowed me whole. The wallpaper almost seemed to be bubbling and popping, until I saw the hundreds of small insects doing a poor job of imitating moldy paint chips. Another couch, just like the one on which I had spent so many nights trying to just fade into oblivion, came crawling out from behind the coffee table, blocking the light from the TV as its cushions parted like a fat bulldog's jowls to reveal hungry rows of gnashing leather-bound teeth. A second coffee table emerged from underneath the first and lurched between me and the front door, seeming to almost grow towards me as one of it's legs split in two and the top morphed into a pentagonal shape.

Backing towards the hallway I grabbed one of the dining room chairs to defend myself, but when my fingers slip into the pattern carved in the back the holes suddenly constricted, burying rough wooden needles into my fingers from all angles. Gritting my teeth so hard I tasted blood, I hoisted the chair-thing above my head and savagely smashed it against the table, sending strangely soft chunks of twitching wood and particle board flying.

Whatever fleeting moment of hope I felt at my barbaric victory against the dining room set was swiftly dashed when the couch took its place at the entrance to the hallway. I was considering an escape through the bedroom, the window slats should open just wide enough to squeeze out, when I heard a mournful cry from behind me.

Sweet Pea was still in the bathroom.

No time to think, I immediately went charging around the corner and came to a stop so hard I could swear I slid a little on the floor. I didn't even notice at first that the bathroom door was closed. I finally saw the source of the flood of tiny insect-like things infesting my apartment. The closet door was open again. A small, unremarkable cardboard box lay across the threshold, upturned slightly as a writhing mass of old clothes that should have been donated or thrown away years ago spilled out into the hallway. The permanent marker scrawl on the side was mostly legible, and it almost spelled her name correctly.

I realize I've stepped back into the corner of the hallway when I hear the couch redouble it's efforts to reach me. Turning my head to look I see it stuffing itself into the hallway, bulging and morphing as it slowly oozes down the hallway. I find myself frozen staring at it as hundreds of tiny, square couch legs sprout from its sides and dig deep into the plaster of the walls. The frantic scraping of the couch's thick wooden legs is deeper than the low buzz of scrabbling legs from before, more urgent and powerful, as it desperately dragged itself towards me.

I definitely won't be getting out through the bedroom.

Sweet Pea let out another small, muffled cry and I don't even realize I'm moving until I feel the impact of the box against my foot and the cool metal of the knob mixed with a burning itch in my palm as I slam the closet door shut. The pile of clothes crushed under the door squealed in a chorus of pain and rippled as dozens of fabric fingers shot out, tapping frantically on the floor like a piano concerto.

Dazed, I looked down at my hand to see a large wooden splinter with three joints sprouting from my palm, twitching and writhing like a severed roach leg or lizard tail. Without stopping to think about it I ripped it out with my teeth and spat the wriggling hunk of wood to the floor, wrenching my foot away from the gradually slowing fabric appendages as I closed the distance to the bathroom. The moment I opened the bathroom door Sweet Pea bolted between my legs and through the closet door that had reopened behind me when I wasn't looking. Before I could even think of giving chase the bulky, misshapen form of the couch came lumbering around the corner and I swiftly locked myself in the bathroom.

That's where I've been for the past half an hour or so while the thunderous pounding of rain intensifies against the window, typing this up with bloody toilet paper wrapped around my arm while a couch tries to fit through a quarter-inch thick gap between the door and the floor. The worst part is, it's starting to get somewhere. The old lady who lives next door might have drugged me, and that was the best case scenario. A part of me is sure this is just a bad dream, a terrible reaction to the wrong kind of ""special"" dessert from an out of touch old bat who probably meant well. A bigger part of me wants to accept it, to just sit here and wait while my sad, empty apartment gets sadder and emptier, to let the couch swallow me whole. Something stronger rising from the deepest depths of my soul can still hear Sweet Pea calling from down the hall, and thinks the heavy porcelain toilet tank lid could probably do a lot more damage than a wooden chair. Ruth's going to be pissed, she just installed it last week.

If I don't make it... shit, I don't know. I have nothing to give and nobody to give it to. Just take my advice. Go wash your damn dishes. Go hug your loved ones. Go tell her you're sorry.

We have been planning to have family over once we are settled, but aren‚Äôt sure how we should handle inviting his dad‚Äôs wife/her kids.

For context, my partner and I just met her less than a year ago. Our communication with her has been extremely minimal considering she only speaks Spanish and we can‚Äôt communicate very well in Spanish (we‚Äôre slowly learning but it‚Äôs not good enough to really hold any type of conversation). Anyways, it‚Äôs not really the fact that we don‚Äôt know her as much as it is the fact that we find her to be a bit disrespectful.

For example, on multiple occasions, she would not acknowledge me, but would acknowledge my partner (saying hi/bye to him, but not me, offering him a plate of food during gatherings but completely avoiding me) The first time she somewhat acknowledged me was to ask me if I was interested in purchasing anything from this website (makeup, coffee, etc). She was having my partners grandma relay this to me, and even had her send me the link. It was basically one of those storefront links. I buy, and she gets commission off of it. I‚Äôm all for a girl getting in her bag, but this just seemed sooo distasteful because it just felt like she saw me as someone that she could potentially get money from??

Prior to this, she had my partners dad text him a picture of something she made to ask if I liked it, and said it was $30 if I was interested.

However, the first, and biggest indicator that she had no shame/care, was BEFORE we had even met her. My partner was living across the country, and was planning to move back to our very expensive state. His dad was living in a studio w his wife/her kids, so my partner decided to ask if he would be interested in renting out a house since we could combine income and it would benefit all of us.

His dad told us that she could only pay $600 for rent. My partner and I found multiple houses that could fit us all, with all of us being able to pay the same amount ($600), however each one of these houses, she had a problem with (too close to the Main Street, didn‚Äôt like the layout, location was ‚Äútoo ghetto‚Äù). Her choices? Houses that would require everyone else to pay around $800-$1000 while she would only stick to paying $600. We didn‚Äôt end up moving in with them thankfully, but considering this was our first introduction to her, and then everything else up to this point has just made it extremely hard to like her.

It‚Äôs our space, and I know we decide who is welcome, but neither my partner and I want to come off rude. My partner is worried that his grandparents will be upset if we intentionally disinvite her, as we are planning to have them over for dinner as well.

1nc74qw,https://imageditingai.com/,I Built an AI Tool to Finally Make Editing Text in Images Easy! (No More Text-on-Image Headaches!),"If you've ever tried to generate an image with text using current AI models, or even just edit text on an existing photo, you know the pain. Typos, weird fonts, text in all the wrong places, impossible to align... it's a nightmare. I got so fed up with these limitations that I decided to build a solution.

[https://imageditingai.com/](https://imageditingai.com/)

  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_HPfzCz7Q00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HPfzCz7Q00)  


**So, what does it do?**

My tool uses a conversational interface to give you incredible precision over both your images and any text you want to put on them. Think of it like having a super-powered graphic designer you can just chat with.

Here's how it generally works:

1. **Start with an Image (Yours or Mine):** You can either upload an image you already have, or you can generate a brand new one using a detailed text prompt. Want a ""dark, moody background with a coffee mug and steam""? Just ask, and it'll create it.
2. **Edit Images with Simple Commands:** This is where the conversational magic truly begins. Want to ""move that coffee mug to the bottom right""? Done. Need to ""remove that watermark from the corner""? Poof, it's gone. No more fiddling with selection tools or cloning ‚Äì just tell the AI what you want.
3. **Add Text with Unprecedented Control:** This is the game-changer.
   * **Draw a Box:** You physically draw a rectangle on the image where you want your text to appear. This tells the AI exactly where to focus.
   * **Speak Your Text & Style:** Then, you simply tell the AI what words to put there, and how you want them to look. ""Add the words 'Daily Grind Cafe' in a bold, white, sans-serif font, centered in that box."" The AI understands and places the text perfectly.
   * **Refine Iteratively:** Want to change the font to Times New Roman? Or make the main headline yellow and the prices green? You just keep chatting with it, and the AI makes the adjustments in real-time. It handles complex layouts too, like creating a neatly formatted menu or a list, just from your conversational input.
4. **Download Your Masterpiece:** Once everything looks perfect, you can download your image in high quality (PNG, PDF, etc.) ready for whatever you need it for.

1nc72yd,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nc72yd/fingers_of_god/,Fingers of God,"*April, 1897*

Was gifted this nice journal by a rather strange gentleman I met on my way out of town. He shared his fire and a fresh pot of coffee with me and aside from basic pleasantries, all he told me was he was over in this part of the country for the spring. A man of few words, I guess, and I reckon since we share that in common neither of us were too bothered by the lack of conversation. It was nice to have the company, odd as he was, at least in this bit of country he was. Looked like he just stepped off a train from New York, or Chicago, or one of them places. 

He may have.

When the sun was a bit higher in the sky he broke the long silence - it was time for him to move on - to only him and God knows where. Aside from the old livestock town full of drunkards and lowlifes I'd just ridden out of, there was nothing but harsh, wild country for weeks. 

I helped pack his wagon and in return got this journal, then watched the man slowly shrink into the brightening horizon, though I thought I saw him turn and tip his hat one last time before disappearing.

Something about him felt familiar yet I cannot quite put my finger on what.

 \- 

It's been a couple weeks since I met that strange man and still he lingers in the back of my mind. Plain idiot or just naive, more likely a combination of the two, he was certainly out of place with his fancy clothes and wagon and I often find myself worrying that he's only gone and gotten himself lost or killed in this harsh land. But some small part of me gets the feeling that he is more than fine, and that is enough to keep me from up and risking my own life trying to track down the fool. 

I haven't wandered too far from the old livestock town since leaving that day, moving my camp around when and wherever I pleased. Always far enough from the drunken scuttle of life there but close enough to stop in for supplies or odd end jobs to make what little money I need. So far, life has been nice and comfortable here.

Except for the sky.

Back in Wyoming where I spent the majority of my life I saw all manner of weather, all that Mother Nature had to offer, so I thought. But the skies here - some stretch of wild between Cheyenne and Oklahoma - they are bigger, almost towering over you in a way that makes men feel small. Like an old force too great for understanding. 

At first I was in love with this heavy, imposing blanket of blue and stars that the mountains back home would in parts obscure. Now I find myself longing for those great mountains, those old, earthly protectors of Cheyenne. 

In the plains, nothing can protect you from the fingers of God.

The Shawnee and Caddo tell legend of the Cyclone Person - some sort of being with long, thrashing hair that twists and devours what land it touches. I've only ever heard tell of 'cyclones' since coming down to these parts, and from what little the locals feel like sharing, it sure ain't nothing good. 

If it weren't for my own eyes, I'd say they were all full of horseshit.

I‚Äôve had this issue since I was a boy but if I overeat or eat specific foods such as bananas, yogurt, ice cream, etc I feel it getting stuck in my esophagus and it‚Äôs the most uncomfortable feeling. I started inducing vomiting at a young age & grew up thinking it was normal. It got worse in high school & I was vomiting almost every day. I don‚Äôt vomit every meal it‚Äôs mainly when I overeat. 

I still induce vomit about 5x a week. Not sure if it‚Äôs an esophagus or stomach issue. Food feels stuck, bloated, burning sensation, feels like food is being pressed or pushing stomach / esophagus. The pain and discomfort goes away right after vomiting. 

The only meal I don‚Äôt vomit is breakfast & it‚Äôs because breakfast is light. Two waffles, an egg, & water. I used to drink coffee but it caused burning and cramping. 

Dinner is mixed throughout the week but mainly baked fish with rice. Some days curry. I also eat a lot of fried foods which I know I should probably stop. 

I‚Äôve visited multiple GI docs and they all do the same things; endoscopy & omeprazole. My last recent endoscopy came back normal. The esophagus was inflamed from the vomiting, but normal. The last treatment i received was dupixent and an oral medication that‚Äôs supposed to coat my esophagus. The doc thinks I have food allergy. I stopped the dupixent since I was having allergic reactions (mostly boils on body & itching), those all went away once I stopped dupixent.

Does anyone else have this issue? I still continue to vomit & sooth my stomach with waffles or bread. Not sure why that helps but it does. Not sure how I can fix this issue.

Back in April, our printer started making a horrible grinding noise and displaying an error code. Everyone's freaking out, calling IT, and IT's like ""yeah, we'll be there sometime this week,"" which obviously means never.

I literally just googled the error code on my phone while everyone else stood around panicking. Took maybe 30 seconds. Turns out you just had to adjust this one paper tray thing. Fixed.

Now somehow, I'm the unofficial IT support for literally everything. ""Hey, can you look at my computer?"" ""My email's being weird."" ""The coffee machine is blinking - you're good with technology, right?""

Here's the thing - I know absolutely nothing about technology. I'm in MARKETING. I write Instagram captions and plan events. But apparently being the only person here under 40 who's willing to try turning something off and on again makes me some kind of wizard.

The worst part? Last week, our actual IT guy showed up to fix something and asked me how I solved all these tech issues so fast. I wanted to be like ""dude, I just Google everything,"" but instead I said some nonsense about ""systematic troubleshooting,"" and he nodded like I was a genius.

Now management's noticed. They're talking about adding ""IT responsibilities"" to my job description in my next review. I coordinate marketing campaigns! I don't know what a server is! But apparently I'm about to become responsible for keeping our entire digital infrastructure running.

I keep meaning to tell everyone I'm just googling stuff, but... everyone's so grateful when I fix things. And honestly, it's kinda nice being the person who solves problems instead of the person who creates them (looking at you, quarterly budget presentations).

I'm just dreading the day someone asks me to do something that can't be solved with ""Did you try unplugging it for 10 seconds?""",5,1757384357.0,confessions,1,1.0,False

I want to know if you have promoted me
from the margins of your notebook

Little black book
which number am I?

My eyes ask,
but your gaze is lodged 
between my thighs


What a scene! 

Your eyes scald my skin 
and I‚Äôm still so vulnerable 

But you‚Äôre too busy fantasizing 
too busy to care,
busy with shoddy dreams and 
a performative heart 
pressed against my beating chest


You beg to share a bed with me,
then condemn mediocrity 

And I‚Äôm still standing here
naked and vulnerable 

You didn‚Äôt even offer
a departing cup of coffee 

Just your withdrawn gaze
that feels worse 
than the brands your eyes
left on my skin 

you reached your peak 
Is that all you need?



Still, all I want to know:

Did you scribble my name in a hurry? 
Did you write me in ink?
Am I completely erased?

But when I take my meds, I basically can go the whole day without water.

Hi everyone! I (41F) am currently going through a divorce after a 9-year marriage. The first few years were passionate, but my ex quit his job, claimed neurological problems, and never worked again. Instead, he spiraled into addictions (gaming, smoking, energy drinks) and became emotionally abusive. He never hit me, but screaming at me hours before surgery because I asked him not to smoke indoors while I recovered‚ÄîI count that as abuse. After years of neglect, I left. Now he‚Äôs suing me for alimony.

I asked for separation in Jan 2024, he moved out in May, and by then I knew I hadn‚Äôt loved him for a long time. Classic ‚ÄúWalkaway Wife Syndrome‚Äù: I fought, grieved, and let go. Since then, I‚Äôve been in therapy, working out, exploring new things (techno and raves have been life-changing!), and finally started to bloom. I had no interest in dating, almost no libido‚Äîuntil this year.

At work, I occasionally deal with our IT lead (41M). We always had a good rapport, but last December he helped found our Workers Council, and I suddenly saw him differently‚Äîbrave, principled, with a good heart. In March, I ran into him on the balcony and we chatted for 15 minutes. Something clicked‚ÄîI was intensely attracted. Later, he joined me for coffee in the kitchen, and I realized how rare it felt to have an uninterrupted adult conversation, something my ex never gave me.

Since then, he‚Äôs welcomed me into his circle. We‚Äôve played billiards after work, shared drinks, and had long conversations that sometimes stretched until 4am. He‚Äôs funny, kind, open-minded, culturally curious (I‚Äôm Mexican, he drops little Spanish phrases for me), respected at work, yet very private. He‚Äôs my age, single, never married, and has said past relationships never reached the stage of marriage. My crush was overwhelming at first, but now it feels like a genuine curiosity and connection. I don‚Äôt know if he feels the same but last week, he stayed up late after work to help me cook for a work gathering.

The thing is, I‚Äôm also enjoying my independence. I want to travel, I‚Äôm handling debt, and I‚Äôm under huge stress from the divorce and possible alimony. My BFF and neghbor tells me to wait until I‚Äôm fully divorced and healed, but I hate how he phrases it as ‚Äúwomen can‚Äôt be alone‚Äù or ‚Äúyour life revolves around a man.‚Äù I still go to the gym, therapy, explore new things, and I even had a casual fling this summer. But I admit: sometimes I think too much about my crush and neglect stuff I need to do.

Divorce in Germany drags on‚ÄîI might be 44 by the time it‚Äôs over. I don‚Äôt want dating apps, but I don‚Äôt want to miss out on a real connection either.

So my question is: is it too soon to date? Should you always ‚Äúheal‚Äù first, or is it okay to slowly open up to someone while still figuring things out?",3,1757383849.0,AskWomenOver30,3,1.0,False

I've included a voice note at the end of this post. The subject isn't relevant anymore but I'm including it so you can hear my voice. 

I'm looking for someone local but maybe you could persuade me if you're somewhere else in the USA and check off all my boxes. I'm in northern maryland and I'm close enough to PA + DE. 

I'm 5'11. Bigger. And I wear glasses. Some say I'm cute. If you're attracted to bigger women, you may find me hot in some ways lol. But I'm def not everyone's type. 

I have a nice voice so that's something you can look forward to. I do enjoy voice chatting to get to know you. Let me know if you could do a short call tonight. 

Other things to know about me is I'm pretty ambitious. And I like ambition in my partner. I especially like entreprenurial men as I have my own plans and I've been freelancing for over 8 years now. My passion project is self improvement coaching for women. I'm currently doing this for free to get some case studies. I'd like to turn this into something one day. 

I work a sucky sales job. I'm actually trying to improve my performance so I'm working long hours. But I'm still making time for romance in my life. Which is why we can have a quick call tonight. I'll be working late. 

I like smart and nerdy men. It's probably a weakness of mine along with guys that can give me instructions and rules. We can have some fun ones. And some helpful ones. I'm open. I actually teach women how to be more disciplined but I could always use some extra accountability. 

I'm looking for men 25-35 years old. Bonus points for those that send a short voice note as well. 

I don't have hobbies. I work and relax. And I make time for men to ruin my life apparently. I really like the Hormozi's and David Goggins. If this bothers you a lot it's probably not a good fit lol. I'm also childfree which means I don't want kids. 

I'm like really into us growing together...so I do enjoy coworking together but also I like relaxing and watching cute movies too. Or reading something together is very cute too. Maybe we can hang out at this coffee shop near me sometime? :P

My husband and I are arriving in NZ next week. This is my dream trip and I can‚Äôt wait. 

We are visiting both islands over two weeks and heading to Australia for some time afterwards. 

I have some questions if you don‚Äôt mind. We aren‚Äôt driving at all (for your safety and mine, lol) we have some tours and coaches taking us around. All hotels are booked as well as excursions and we‚Äôve actually already paid for it all so that‚Äôs kind of nice. We will be bringing cash for coffees and smaller purchases. 

1. Tipping. Because Canada pretty much follows the US, our tipping culture is out of control. I have a guide book that says 10% for good service? Is this even at nicer restaurants or is this frowned upon? I don‚Äôt want to be rude or cheap, and want to do what is customary. 

2. We have tours booked and is it ok to give the tour guides a cash tip or is this frowned upon? What about uber/taxis?

3. If we use our credit card, is it best to put the pin in and not use paywave? Not sure if this is even a thing with a Canadian credit card. 

4. Anything else I should know?

Thanks so much everyone. I‚Äôm super excited to respectfully visit NZ.

My partner and I just moved into a bigger apartment nearby family/friends and have been super excited because now we can host little dinners and gatherings. We have been planning to have family over once we are settled, but aren‚Äôt sure how we should handle inviting his dad‚Äôs wife/her kids.

For context, my partner and I just met her less than a year ago. Our communication with her has been extremely minimal considering she only speaks Spanish and we can‚Äôt communicate very well in Spanish (we‚Äôre slowly learning but it‚Äôs not good enough to really hold any type of conversation). Anyways, it‚Äôs not really the fact that we don‚Äôt know her as much as it is the fact that we find her to be a bit disrespectful.

For example, on multiple occasions, she would not acknowledge me, but would acknowledge my partner (saying hi/bye to him, but not me, offering him a plate of food during gatherings but completely avoiding me)
The first time she somewhat acknowledged me was to ask me if I was interested in purchasing anything from this website (makeup, coffee, etc). She was having my partners grandma relay this to me, and even had her send me the link. It was basically one of those storefront links. I buy, and she gets commission off of it. I‚Äôm all for a girl getting in her bag, but this just seemed sooo distasteful because it just felt like she saw me as someone that she could potentially get money from?? 

Prior to this, she had my partners dad text him a picture of something she made to ask if I liked it, and said it was $30 if I was interested.

However, the first, and biggest indicator that she had no shame/care, was BEFORE we had even met her. My partner was living across the country, and was planning to move back to our *very expensive* state. His dad was living in a studio w his wife/her kids, so my partner decided to ask if he would be interested in renting out a house since we could combine income and it would benefit all of us.

His dad told us that she could only pay $600 for rent. My partner and I found multiple houses that could fit us all, with all of us being able to pay the same amount ($600), however each one of these houses, she had a problem with (too close to the Main Street, didn‚Äôt like the layout, location was ‚Äútoo ghetto‚Äù). Her choices? Houses that would require everyone else to pay around $800-$1000 while she would only stick to paying $600. We didn‚Äôt end up moving in with them thankfully, but considering this was our first introduction to her, and then everything else up to this point has just made it extremely hard to like her.

It‚Äôs our space, and I know we decide who is welcome, but neither my partner and I want to come off rude. My partner is worried that his grandparents will be upset if we intentionally disinvite her, as we are planning to have them over for dinner as well. 

AITAH for not wanting her in our home? Is this one of those things you just kinda accept, and play nice to keep the peace??

Anyways, it‚Äôs not really the fact that we don‚Äôt know her as much as it is the fact that we find her to be a bit disrespectful.

For example, on multiple occasions, she would not acknowledge me, but would acknowledge my partner (saying hi/bye to him, but not me, offering him a plate of food during gatherings but completely avoiding me)
The first time she somewhat acknowledged me was to ask me if I was interested in purchasing anything from this website (makeup, coffee, etc). She was having my partners grandma relay this to me, and even had her send me the link. It was basically one of those storefront links. I buy, and she gets commission off of it. I‚Äôm all for a girl getting in her bag, but this just seemed sooo distasteful because it just felt like she saw me as someone that she could potentially get money from?? 

Prior to this, she had my partners dad text him a picture of something she made to ask if I liked it, and said it was $30 if I was interested.

However, the first, and biggest indicator that she had no shame/care, was BEFORE we had even met her. My partner was living across the country, and was planning to move back to our *very expensive* state. His dad was living in a studio w his wife/her kids, so my partner decided to ask if he would be interested in renting out a house since we could combine income and it would benefit all of us.

His dad told us that she could only pay $600 for rent. My partner and I found multiple houses that could fit us all, with all of us being able to pay the same amount ($600), however each one of these houses, she had a problem with (too close to the Main Street, didn‚Äôt like the layout, location was ‚Äútoo ghetto‚Äù). Her choices? Houses that would require everyone else to pay around $800-$1000 while she would only stick to paying $600. We didn‚Äôt end up moving in with them thankfully, but considering this was our first introduction to her, and then everything else up to this point has just made it extremely hard to like her.

It‚Äôs our space, and I know we decide who is welcome, but neither my partner and I want to come off rude. My partner is worried that his grandparents will be upset if we intentionally disinvite her, as we are planning to also have his grandparents over for dinner. His dad has already mentioned wanting to come over and we just aren‚Äôt sure how to handle this. 

Is this one of those things you just kinda accept, and play nice to keep the peace??",1,1757383135.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

we were never gonna get married, we were barely even serious, but i'm scared I liked her more than I thought.
part of me feels like I fucked something up, and she's basically haunting my dreams(I slept like shit last night cause I dreamt about her...) but the bigger, logical part of me has its foot down that it was the right decision.
I hate lesbian yearning. I don't want to get back into a relationship with her, I just want to be transported back to those moments with her when everything was perfect.

A bit tight for cash right now, which Isn't Great because I need cash to webhost shit (because that's how it goes). Today I nominally had class but it's

1. online; and
2. lacks formal class times in lieu of scheduling meetings with your professor

so it's basically just an extension of the weekend. I would've gotten some work done on my capstone but, in the immortal words of Doc Ock, ""*We need money.*""

Also I have partially purposefully been looking at things that I find titillating, which is probably a bad idea so I should probably stop.

Also, while looking up The Coffee Zone on Soundcloud (because of the YouTube boycott), you'll never guess who showed up on the ""artists you should follow"" sidebar. One hint: They're pretty infamous in the Friday Night Funkin' community.

*By The DataSkrive Oracle of Run Expectancy*

**Parsing the Odds: A Math Class You Didn‚Äôt Sign Up For**  
The Marlins (-135) are the slight favorites here, implying a 60% chance to win (thanks, math: 150/(150+100)). The Nationals (+115) offer a 47.6% implied probability, which is basically the sportsbook‚Äôs way of saying, ‚ÄúWe think Miami‚Äôs better, but we‚Äôre not *that* sure.‚Äù The total is set at 8 runs, with the Over/Under lines fluctuating like a first-dater‚Äôs confidence.

Key stats? Let‚Äôs break it down:

* **Janson Junk** (Marlins): 4.09 ERA, 61 Ks in 88‚Öî IP. He‚Äôs had four consecutive starts where he allowed exactly 3 runs. Statistically, he‚Äôs the MLB version of ‚Äúmeh, but consistent.‚Äù
* **Cade Cavalli** (Nationals): 4.85 ERA, 3.5 K/BB ratio (yikes), and a 1.483 WHIP. His last start against this lineup? 2 ER in 5 IP. He‚Äôs like a toaster that occasionally sparks but never burns down the house.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Rivalries, and Home-Run Happy Clowns**  
The Marlins are fresh off a five-game losing streak, including a three-game sweep at the hands of the Nationals. Revenge is a dish best served with extra innings and a side of humiliation. Meanwhile, the Nationals have won their last six of ten games, but their offense has regressed to 3.8 RPG‚Äîthink of it as a slow-cooker set to ‚Äúsimmer, not explode.‚Äù

Offensively, the Marlins are a bunch of home-run clowns: 7 HRs in 10 games, led by Otto Lopez‚Äôs three bombs and Kyle Stowers‚Äô triple-crown threat. The Nationals? They‚Äôre hitting 9 HRs in the same span, but their .229 BA feels like a typo from a spreadsheet that‚Äôs had one too many coffee breaks.

I recently moved to Tokyo from the US earlier this year and attending Japanese language school. I‚Äôm looking to meet some new friends in the Tokyo area where I can practice Japanese or just explore bars and izakaya's. I live near Koto City, so if anyone‚Äôs around that area, even better!

I enjoy concerts, anime, card games (like One Piece TCG), and exploring new caf√©s. I go to a lot of concerts my music taste is wide spread like Ultra Japan this weekend and saw Ano last week.

If anyone wants to hang out for coffee, language exchange, or a concert buddy, feel free to comment!",2,1757381970.0,tokyoirl,2,0.75,False

I nodded, and silently continued adding and subtracting fractions on the worksheet in front of me. My pace through the work was brisk, and in just a few minutes I was finished.¬† My brother took advantage of my pencil‚Äôs rest to ask me a question.

‚ÄúHow do you do multiplication?¬† Nine times eight takes too long.‚Äù

I glanced over at my father, laid across the couch. He shifted, he mumbled ‚Äúshut the fuck, you two. Go outside.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not done with my homework yet, dad‚Äù my brother said. Nick never did know when to be quiet.

‚ÄúGet the fuck outside,‚Äù my father said, his foot lashing out to kick the coffee table. The French onion dip that had been sitting on it burst open on the carpet. ‚ÄúClean it the fuck up!‚Äù he screamed. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt get a fucking minute to myself in this fucking house!‚Äù he bellowed, shifting himself from the lying position to a standing one. Apparently, being the manager of an arcade was exhausting work.

My brother and I ran for the door, the clatter of the screen door making note of our escape into the summer sun as my father‚Äôs ire turned towards our mother. I knew she‚Äôd clean up the dip‚Ä¶ and I knew she‚Äôd need new eyeshadow before the day was out.

The backyard was inhabited by imaginary fairies and teeming with adventure. The heroes and villains in the backyard were easier to define, and our time there was the highlight of our years at that house. The grapevines crawling across the trellis, the shed where we waged imaginary wars against fictional armies. The garden, where lola was master and commander of all things growing.

I walked over to the garden, breathing a bit heavily from the sprint out the door. Lola was hunched over, pulling weeds with a vigor that belied her wizened appearance. She spoke no English, and my Tagalog was very poor. ‚ÄúLola, can I help?‚Äù I said, mimicking the weeding motion she was making. She nodded and smiled. We could still hear the bursts of rage coming from the house. I know she heard it, but she just motioned for my brother and I to start pulling weeds. I pulled, and a dandelion snapped at the soil line. Lola smiled at me, and gently took my hands and showed me how to dig deeper, and pull the roots of the invasive plant from the earth. She threw her hands up and re-illustrated how to properly weed after I made the same mistake with the next one. Once I‚Äôd mastered the technique, she motioned to the green peppers and gave a thumbs up and a smile. I think she was telling me that the weeding made the green peppers happy. In my mind, we were stopping the yellow-crowned orcish invaders from destroying the peaceful green pepper tribe.

The memories of lola all followed the same script. I wish there was some nuance to make this story hit harder, but the truth of it is that she was the kindest and most patient human God ever put on this earth. She taught me to pray. Taught me to care for things that can‚Äôt care for themselves. Like green peppers. Her brightly colored headscarf has been a totem throughout my life; beauty in the face of pain. It wasn‚Äôt until I was in my 30s that I even knew she had been fighting cancer in those years. I still don‚Äôt know why her lack of hair never stood out to me then. ¬†

One night, I woke up suddenly. The moon was streaming through the window, washing the room in a relaxed luminescence that felt calming. At the foot of my bed, lola was standing. She looked at me with her head scarf, and wrinkles, and serene smile. She held her finger to her lip and mouthed something I could translate this time. She told me that everything would be ok.

I found out the next day that she had died the evening prior. She wasn‚Äôt even at home, she had been at my cousin‚Äôs brownstone thirty minutes away. I never told anyone about her visiting me that night. And no matter what life took or gave to me, no matter how far I drifted from spirituality or wonder, I have never once doubted that this beautiful woman, my lola, had come to say goodbye that night.",2,1757381936.0,Ghoststories,0,0.75,False

If your time and energy allows, I hope you can offer me some guidance too. It will be a very long post, forgive my Mercury ruled chart. 
If anyone from the community is happy to contribute a comment, I'd greatly appreciate it. 


My life went into a full tail spin not long before noon London time, on 27th November 2023. I'm not going to elaborate or we both might need tissues. Nearly everything in my life has changed since - got a new kitten, got broken up with, or more like discarded, shortly after (good riddance), moved, I cut all contact with my friends, job relocated me etc.). It really feels like a one never ending exhausting year since. I feel like I held up through the biggest battles, but at the moment I'm running on fumes to keep my life together, energy wise, both mentally and somewhat physically.
I am single and have not recovered my trust in romantic relationships yet, so plan to stay this way for foreseeable future. My orange cat is everything to me, he's been with me through it all, little guy is about to turn 2 years old next month. 
I turned into an absolute hermit these two years and despite by nature being rather delusionaly optimistic about the future, I just feel so very tired. 

At the same time I also feel like the clock is ticking and it's the right time to unapologetically go after what I want, since everything and every close relationship I used to put my hopes in has already crumbled. But I'm not ready, I'm still bleeding, even my house is an absolute mess and the cleaning progress to organize it is slow. 

Technically, I have no logical reason to be worried about my job (coffee shop, same company for 8 years or so, atm paycheck to paycheck more or less, but nothing to complain about nowadays) or about the place I'm renting, but I feel somewhat unsettled about stability of these lately. I know that as long as me and my cat have somewhere we can afford to live on our own, we'll be fine. I'm not the kind of person to worry too much, except this one thing seems to be an exception when I'm feeling irrationally anxious. I lived with some extremely troubled people in the past and it was a special type of hell. 
Not sure if you can ease my mind here anyhow or maybe just tell me if I need to brace myself for sudden change I don't want to face? Not sure what's going on. The eclipses of this month are making me nervous, send help. 

I am quietly ambitious, always was, but only outside of any existing corporate structure (which prioritize profit over human wellbeing and I struggle to conform), so there's inevitable career change ahead of me, I suppose. I hope to slowly establish myself online and gradually grow a business, but I'm still trying to refine my idea into something truly good and useful to others. I'm quite skilled as a painter, I have a strong interest in psychology and mysticism. The occult calls to me louder each day, is it because of my Part of Fortune? Or the Saturn transit?

1nc5dsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1nc5dsw/post_wedding_blues_and_regrets/,Post wedding blues and regrets,"Feel like there‚Äôs one of these types of posts every week, but wanted to vent about my wedding this past weekend, since it keeps occupying my mind.. And maybe get some solidarity from other brides who have maybe felt similar about their wedding day. 

It‚Äôs been tough to think happily and fondly back on my wedding day. There was just so much anxiety and feeling overwhelmed the week leading up to it, and I felt so frazzled the day of that I missed a lot of it.

I regret not soaking in the day, admiring and appreciating every detail, and missing out on so many things because I was feeling stressed.

There were also so many things that went wrong that I felt like I could have planned better for. Or if I took a pause, could‚Äôve been fixed.

Everybody said our wedding day was awesome and beautiful and if there were any hiccups, they didn‚Äôt notice. But to me, it felt like such a large thing because I primarily planned the wedding and spent a lot of time and effort DIY-ing.

I DIY-ed large faux floral arrangements for the altar and had a vision for them and labeled them for our coordinator. Unfortunately, they placed them out of order and backwards, and I wasn‚Äôt able to notice before ceremony started.

The venue put on drapes around the poles in the venue space that we specifically did not want. It obstructed the view for many of our guests.

Our photographer told us the day before the second photographer couldn‚Äôt make it. We were rushed for photos throughout the day that I missed out on a lot of photos I wanted. 

The bustle took so long that I missed cocktail hour on the garden rooftop that I was looking forward to so much. We couldn‚Äôt grab a coffee from the coffee cart vendor I booked in the way beginning of wedding planning.

Felt like I couldn‚Äôt spend as much time with everybody and greet them.

I‚Äôm so lucky to be married to my best friend and my husband is so supportive. But I just can‚Äôt help feel extra regret about how the wedding day went, especially since I put so many days and hours into DIY-ing and wanting our wedding day to be beautiful. Only for the vision to not be executed and forgetting to soak in the day. 

Trying to just focus on how now I am married and that there‚Äôs more to life, but it just feels tough right now and hope there are other people who may feel similar to me.. Everybody just keeps saying the wedding went great, but as the only one who knew how it was ‚Äúsupposed to go‚Äù, I feel a bit sad and regretful.

I‚Äôm usually not the type to post like this, but I am going through a  depressing time alone and want companionship, someone to cuddle, hug, chill with, and share some intimacy.

Privacy is non-negotiable. I want both our identities to be respected, no matter what the consequences are.

Prefer lean/slim/normal bmi guys (age 22-27), taller than 5‚Äô7, introvert/ambivert type, and someone who has been in serious relationship before (experience & understanding matters). I dislike arrogance or fights and instead value calm, respectful, diplomatic conversations.

I extremely dislike cheaters and ghosters ‚Äî if you have those traits, respectfully please don‚Äôt bother. Clarity and maturity is one thing I appreciate along with intelligence.

I‚Äôm a college student at a prestigious institute, and would prefer someone along the same line (prestigious institute/job). I am chubby, working on myself, a little shy at first but talkative once I open up. I'm open to listening about your life, your quirks, interests, problems if you‚Äôd like to share. I enjoy deep discussions and comforting people. I love cooking for people I care about. My hobbies are theatre arts, dance, movies (psychological, mystery, thriller, historical), anime, chess, swimming, basketball, art, wall painting, fashion design, embroidary, piano & tabla (noob), diy projects etc. I have some national and state level awards. Can‚Äôt spend right now, so would appreciate if you cover for food/coffee.

I had a very long day today and just need something to bring me an ounce of joy, well I guess 16 ounces. I wish I could just drink coffee and binge watch Gilmore Girls for the 18th time, but instead I have to go upstairs and watch my toddler after coming off a long day of work.

 My mentee just can‚Äôt seem to get his act together. He has yet again another performance review that ran late due to his inability to due the job correctly. I really need to stop scheduling his calls on Friday afternoons. They always seem to run late. Sometimes I wonder if my job is worth the money. It pays for my life style, but the people can sometimes be too difficult. 

I log off my computer and turn off my home office light of my cheetah print covered office. The last owners decided that they needed fuzzy wallpaper. I walk out nearly tripping on the pile of toys my two year old left on the ground. He has so many toys everywhere. I don‚Äôt know how many light up singing toys are possible to make, but Fisher Price is working towards answering that question. I think the only difference between his toy remote and toy controller is the shape. They all seem to only know how to count to three or stop at the letter c. 

I stumble on the toy box of legos. The same box of legos has been here almost a week. Someone should really pick it up. We keep tripping on it yet no one seems to do anything about it. At least they remain in the box for now and  don‚Äôt have to hop around them individually. 

I walk up the stairs to get greeted by my son running towards me with a big smile yelling ‚Äúmaaaa.‚Äù 

Do you want to go to the coffee shop I ask? We can take a car ride. He loves car rides. 

‚ÄúBroom broom‚Äù he says and runs to the door putting his shoes on the wrong foot. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to the coffee shop with Sonny.‚Äù I tell my husband. ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs late but I just need to enjoy something. It was a long day at work.‚Äù

‚ÄúI like when you enjoy things have fun!‚Äù He reassures me. 

He has always been supportive of me finding things I enjoy. We are new to this small town and he has been encouraging me to find friends. Our town is a small town that gives me a reminder of Stars Hollow from Gilmore Girls. The show always brings me comfort and I wanted to move out of the big city. We looked at towns surrounding us and found this charming area. I love all of the small businesses and being able to support local. I especially love the coffee shop. 

His encouragement can get a bit overwhelming though. Sometimes it feels a bit of a nag when he mentions that I shouldn‚Äôt keep skipping my gym classes or that I should find a hobby. I am balancing a full time job and raising a two year old. It‚Äôs difficult to find time to do things for myself. Doing burpees to old pop songs just doesn‚Äôt seem exciting after working all day. 

I grab my keys to my suv. It‚Äôs brand new, I got it when Sonny was first born. I wanted a mini van, but they were sold out everywhere. The suv is fine but I wish it were a minivan. It‚Äôd be nice if the tvs were built in to the car and I didn‚Äôt have to pray Bluey autoplays on long car rides. Instead I have to lean over the passenger seat while my husband drives 80 on a 55 reaching for the next episode button on our road trips. 

I pick up Sonny and take him outside to the car seat. I buckle him into the car seat and hand him his Paw Patrol story book comfort item. I get into the car and head to the coffee shop. 

We arrive at the coffee shop and I can smell the beans as I poorly parallel park my car in front. I shuffle through some coins to find two quarters for the meter out front. I put the  coins in and grab Sonny from his car seat and head inside.
 
Once we get to the coffee shop Sonny immediately points to the muffins saying ‚Äúmuff muff‚Äù 

The muffin display looks a bit empty today. Probably because it is a Friday night. There is a man playing a guitar in the corner of the shop. It must be band night. The guitar is a bit loud but Sonny seems to enjoy it. 

‚ÄúI think he wants a muffin‚Äù the lady in front of me says while giving out a laugh. 
‚ÄúYes he loves his muffins.‚Äù I responded. I look at Sonny and ask ‚Äúwhich muffin would you like?‚Äù

He points to a blueberry muffin. He reaches towards them while we wait our turn. I hold back all 30 pounds of him as the lady in front of me decides if she wants a medium or a large. I patiently wait trying to hide the defeat of the day on my face. 

Our coffee shop has the small town charm of being an art gallery as well. The walls are covered in paintings by local artists. It adds a unique touch of colors to the walls. I admire the paintings as I wrangle Sonny in. 

Once it‚Äôs my turn I order and let Sonny pay. He takes my card and taps it against the machine. We sit at a table and I do my best to enjoy my latte as he drops muffin crumbs all over the floor. I chase his escape attempts around the shop in between sips.
The sugar from the coffee seems to be the sweetest part of my day. 

Eventually we head home for bed time. I hope the coffe shop running is enough to get him to sleep. It‚Äôs wishful thinking as he pulls me in tight whenever I try to leave. Sometimes he is so stubborn when he is trying to sleep. I wish he would just let me leave the room. He doesn‚Äôt understand that I am just one room over and will be back in the morning. 

I lay next to him wondering how I can be so stressed out. I can‚Äôt help but feel like something is off. I have a perfect son, a supportive husband, a warm house, a dependable car and a flexible job that supports my life. I have what others dream of. It‚Äôs more than I could dream of. Despite what I have I still feel incomplete. I can‚Äôt figure out what could be wrong and eventually dose off. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

As I wake up I look for Sonny and realize he‚Äôs not there. He never was. It was all a dream. 
The tv startles me as I hear Rory raising her voice at Dean on the tv. I should probably turn the volume down before it wakes someone. 
The glow of the tv gently lights the room. I see my sister laying in the bed next to mine. She‚Äôs wrapped in her brand new matching bed set she got. I tell her to take care of it because I have somehow lost the sheets of my bed in the mess of our house. 

I have no idea what time it is but I can see the full moon outside of our curtainless window. The moon brings attention to the half filled plastic bottles of mystery beverages. Their odor fills the room. 

I have to use the restroom but fear going as the flush may wake my parents. 
I look at our door propped open by dirty clothes and broken toys and determine I can‚Äôt hold it. 

I tip toe across the hall, careful not to trip on anything lying around. I make it to the bathroom without making a noise. I use the bathroom unable to shut the door with the pile of mildew scented towels in front of it. The bathroom trash is overfilled. The toilet has the stains that just don‚Äôt seem to go away.
I use the bathroom, grateful there is still toilet paper on the roll. I don‚Äôt dare flush until I‚Äôm ready to sprint back to my room. I stream the water at the lowest trickle to wash my hands. I dry them on my shirt as there is no hand towel.

I flush the toilet and run back into my bed. 
As I land in my bed I hear my father shout ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs up?‚Äù

My heart races as I don‚Äôt dare answer. I try to listen over the pounding beats to the tv and escape into Stars Hollow.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I wake up and my heart is still racing. I feel a pressure on my back. As I start to escape my sleep I realize it‚Äôs just Sonny kicking my back. I take in the scent of Febreeze and feel the warmth of the fleece blanket on his bed. 
I tuck him in carefully so as to not wake him and leave the room. I look at my watch and realize it‚Äôs 2 am. 

 As I leave the room I do a quick clean up of his toys. I am quiet because I don‚Äôt want to  wake my husband. It takes double the time as I am gently placing the toys in one by one. Once I finish I use the restroom. I take an extra minute drying my hands to admire the fresh towel. 

I crawl into bed noticing my sheets have once again fallen off the corner. I am too tired to deal with it and crawl in next to my husband into my half made bed. I switch on Gilmore Girls hoping that I don‚Äôt have another nightmare and instead escape into Stars Hollow. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

‚ÄúRuby get your ass out here now,‚Äù I hear my father shout. 
I lay confused as I can still feel the satin sheets from my dream although my bed remains unmade. I hang on to the pretend scent of Linen Fresh. 

I know I‚Äôm in trouble for something I didn‚Äôt do, but I‚Äôm not sure what for. I hesitatingly walk out into the living room. I stomp through piles of garbage and dirty laundry on my way. 

‚ÄúI thought I told you to clean the kitchen yesterday!‚Äù He yells. ‚ÄúI just want a glass of water and I can‚Äôt get one because the kitchen is a disaster. I want you to go in there and get me some water and then go back in there and stay in there until it is spotless.‚Äù 

I wanted to ask to go to the mall with my friends today but I don‚Äôt dare ask now. 
I look into the kitchen and there is a pile of trash up to my knees. The sink is fulll of dirty dishes that likely have maggots under them. I‚Äôm not certain how to even start. 

I see a package of plastic cups. Thank goodness they are clean. I take one out and bring him some water. I am careful not to spill any. I‚Äôm not sure if my hands are slippery from sweat or condensation. He doesn‚Äôt seem to notice as I timed the hand off well making sure I got to him before the commercial break. 

He blares his Fox News in the living room as I stand in fear in the kitchen. I look at the clock it‚Äôs 7 am. It‚Äôs a Saturday and I wish I could just sleep in. I grab a trash bag and carefully pick up a few pizza boxes and old take out containers. I fear with each item what might be under them. It‚Äôs 8am and I hear him get up to leave the house. Once his truck drives off I sneak to the living room. I don‚Äôt dare change the channel in case he notices and take a nap on the couch. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

I wake up to the neighbor‚Äôs truck revving it‚Äôs engine once again. I look at my watch it‚Äôs 7 am. I don‚Äôt understand why they can‚Äôt just get a new car. I think they‚Äôve had that beat up diesel longer than we had our tv. 
I turn over to see my husband still sleeping next to me. Gilmore Girls auto shut off at some point since I came back to bed. 
I see the sun starting to shine through the thin curtains covering our windows. I should probably get black out curtains. 
I debate getting up for the day or getting just a few more hours of sleep. I can feel the drowsiness in my eyes, but I fear the inception I may once again fall into. My dreams have felt so real, I feel I can taste them.
