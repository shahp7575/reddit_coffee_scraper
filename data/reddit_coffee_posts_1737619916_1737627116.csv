Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie for sh*ts and giggles. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

This isn't for everyone but Ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-34 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

Normally, when I'd take Ritalin, it wouldn't come with any drastic manifestations. I'd feel calm, cool, and on a roll and in my flow state. This time feels different.

What could this mean? Added context, I heard Ritalin synthesizes(?) better with higher protein intake, and I did take my Ritalin today with a protein shake. Not sure if that made the dose *feel* stronger. I'm also not sure, the racing thoughts made it seem as if I was unmedicated, but looking past the jitters, I was able to initiate tasks. I'm just surprised it felt like taking coffee this time.

I want guidance about it how to learn how to make coffee and how to make ut successful, i come from a middle class family so my investment would be low( dads money). 

Back story- i was making 4 lakhs a month in Australia doing labour jobs which is good imo in indian terms but i was having the feeling that i am wasting my life doing labour shit and uber eats, also partly homesick so came back after 3 months.

Acc to me- Starbucks and big chains (tim hortons) are a failure in our city because aside from the initial hype and lifestyle consumers they generally do not have a customer base. Moreover our city is very rich almost metro in every sense but it has little to no corporate jobs, therefore, not the target market i want to sell it to.

The things i have in mind is-
1. Learning how to make good coffee( a barista course).
2. Sourcing high quality coffee in bulk,flavours and syrups.
3. Branding and marketing the coffee brand.

I think it would be greatly beneficial if people share one or two (or however many you wish!) thigns that are in their research arsenal in terms of methods or tips that may not be so commonly known. For example, always do X to a variable before regressing or only work on cumulative changes of x_bar windows when working on intraday data and so on. 

I think I'm too early on in my career to offer anything material to the more expericed quants but something I have found to be extremely useful is sometimes first using simple techniques like OLS regression and quantile analysis before moving onto anything more complex. Do simple scatter plots to eyeball relationships first, sometimes you can visually see if it's linear, quandratic etc.

Does it ignore how difficult running a business and investing is (despite criticisms from Anarchists, leftists and the general populace)?","These two posts should explain much of what I have to say.

https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7qx0as/how_come_biographies_interviews_etc_nonfiction/

https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/7qxo6j/how_come_famous_stock_brokers_businessmen/

Be sure to read the above links (at least read the first one!) before reading the rest of my post.

Growing up I always seen criticism from many leftists- in particular American liberals, Communists (especially those from Russia or descending from former upperclass Soviets), Anarchists, and other political groups leaning towards lefty fiscal economics about how its unfair businessmen like Trump are successful because they already inherited the wealth and profitable company of their parents or they came from upper middle class background and have outstanding education like Bill Gates.

This criticism goes beyond people involved in politics. I cannot tell you how many poor people often scoff at the rich business owners because they are just lucky to have been born from wealthy parents. Hell I even see middle class people who are well off attacking the Bill Gates and other successes as lazy imbeciles who are just ""sitting on their butts all day long"" and they are hoarding wealth so it should be distributed. I seen from the general populace, both poor and middle class, attack the capitalist system because business men aren't really doing hardwork nor are they producing anything of value.

I will admit just for the sake of what I will say in a minute that I am not a conservative. I've been raised in a minarchist household that favors neither leftist nor rightest view but merely view government should have minimal interaction in everything from what movies you watch to visiting a brothel to AK47 owndership. So yes I already have views that are contradictory to conservative idealism.

Yet I could never understand the criticism ""business men are lazy because they inherited their richness"" and ""running a business is as easy as 123!"". Even before I started going into the stock market, I already had first hand experience of how running a business would be like via stays at my auntie (who I mentioned in one of the above reddit links, owns a restaurant). In addition to seeing the dangers and difficulties of kitchen cookings, everytime I stayed over I would always hear her at night getting enraged as she spoke on the phone as she was speaking with employees, partners, and other business associates about so many complex subjects such as paying the bills, trying to get a new insurance company's support, difficulties with kitchen equipment, etc. I could always see how stressed my auntie would be everytime she woke up before she drank coffee and took a bath.

Mind you my auntie is actually quite a successful business owner. At the time she already had a $1,000,000 (I was 14 when she had that amount) in one of her bank accounts and when I talked to her which was weeks before I tried to get into stocks and bonds recently, she told me she had amassed a little over $10 million in that specific bank account. This is not counting assets, her other bank account savings, etc. But I can see despite being merely 46, she's already full of gray hair (I'm only 22 just to put this into perspective).

So I was not naive to believe I'll get rich quick when I tried to enter stock market recently as I already know first hand how hard business can be. Yet even I was caught off guard at how simplistic stuff such as comparing different stocks in chart analysis could be.

So it makes me wonder why the politically left and anarchist as well as poor and many middle class people think running a business and investments is a cakewake? And why many of them think just because Trump was given a lot of cash to start business by his already rich dad that it was easy as playing video games for him to run his enterprises?

I mean has any one seen how Tom Kalinske left his job as CEO of Sega of America with grey hair just because the stress of company politics got him? Or how medical analysts are saying Steve Jobs had a relatively young death because of his diseases which they theorized was probably caused by being overworked running Apple?

After matching, we started talking and immediately hit it off. I asked her out for coffee one evening, but she declined, saying she had a flight to her hometown the next morning and needed to finish her work before that. Initially, I thought it was the same old story and that she might ghost me, but surprisingly, we kept the conversation going.

After a while, I asked for her Instagram, and we agreed to meet once she was back in town. We did meet, and since then, we‚Äôve met 4-5 times and talk to each other daily.

The problem is, she recently got selected for an opportunity in another country, and she‚Äôll be leaving in the next 4-5 months. So far, we‚Äôve vibed well as friends and haven‚Äôt defined anything between us. Neither of us is ready for a commitment, and we both agreed to keep things as they are. However, as our conversations grow deeper day by day, there‚Äôs a sense that we should consider taking things more seriously.

Knowing that she‚Äôs leaving soon makes me hesitate to take that step. She did mention once, casually, that she‚Äôs okay with long-distance and can manage it, but I‚Äôve had bad experiences with relationships in the past. I really don‚Äôt want to commit or develop serious attachments right now.

With Valentine‚Äôs Day coming up, I‚Äôm thinking of asking her out. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll say yes, but I‚Äôm unsure about what kind of outing would be ideal. Should I plan something special to show her I‚Äôm more into her, or should I keep it casual, like a simple dinner date, and just part ways afterward? Can you all suggest ideas for both? What special thing could I do to make it memorable, and what would be a good plan for a normal, casual date?

Also, before she leaves, I want to give her something special so she remembers me, even if we lose touch. What would you suggest as a meaningful gift for her?",1,1737624761.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I will start this by saying that, I had a pretty fucked up and dysfunctional childhood, the perks of being in a fucked up and dysfunctional family. I've witnessed some pretty insane fights for as long as I can remember, and I don't think I ever remember a time when we genuinely enjoyed each other's company. I have three older brothers who have all responded and reacted to these experiences in different ways and then there's me. 

Sufficed to say, I'm my mom's biggest support system right now. Which has been a huge bag of mixed emotions and trauma that I haven't had the time to deal with. Life hasn't been kind to us, and there always seems to be a new problem after another; right now it's another batch of crazy relatives that are stirring shit up and demanding for money that doesn't exist. My mom has almost always had to face these battles alone, and add that to our financial struggles, my anxiety has just gotten worse over the past couple of years. 

I've seen her go through so much over the years, but I also can't forget how she treated my brothers and I. The physical, verbal and psychological abuse-there's no other way to put it-that has only calmed down in recent years as we weren't children anymore. My brothers have all dealt with their trauma differently, but mostly not for their own good. Two of them are still unemployed and depend on my mother, and she's also my primary provider right now. She's also taking care of my dad, who's isn't as sharp or really there as he used to be. So, there lies the dichotomy: she is both my saviour and my tormenter. 
 
However, I can't bring myself to leave everything behind and start healing. My mom needs me, and seeing her struggle with this situation, while also facing some health complications she hadn't had checked up cuz something else always has to come first, has made me anxious. It's made me anxious to graduate faster, to not slip up, and be another burden on her list. 

Over the years I realized that I loved my mother more than I hated her; more than my own desire of freedom and wanting a better life for myself. As much as I resent her and what she's done, she's right: my brothers will pay her dust and I'm the only one she can rely on when she's older. And she's already reaching that point. 

They had me really late, like around their middle ages (40s-50s) so that's another stress of having older parents who you still can't properly support because you're barely an adult yourself. 

So yeah, I've been feeling anxious and really depressed for a while, but somehow this feeling of emptiness has stayed longer than the previous ones. It's not that I'm actively trying ways to see if god exists or something, but, I would also prefer just turning into dust, or I wouldn't mind being hit by a truck right now. It's hard trying to pretend that I'm not internally dying when I'm in school or in social situations. I'm tired of constantly performing normality in my everyday life, and overthinking all of my actions afterwards.

But I can't leave. Because my mom needs me, because my dad needs me, because without me, there will be no one for them. Because I can't really trust my brothers, who have never trauma bonded with our mother as closely as I have. They won't care for her now and they won't in the future. So I can't leave her now, not ever. Not like this. 

When I saw how her eyes lit up after I told her that I'd have my internship next year, I got scared; I can't ever fail and I can't make the same mistakes my brothers have done repeatedly in the past. They've made so many errors that now I can't afford to have one.

That really fucked me up. So when class ended early, I decided to walk around the city. I bought myself a coffee and burger, and I walked towards my favourite thrift spot and got myself clothes (less than a dollar deals, like around Php20!!) because fashion was one of the few things that brought me joy and lately I found that I've lost joy in that too. I'm trying to distract myself as much as possible from my own inner sense of dread and misery, by trying to mimick what living felt like. 

I don't know if I'll ever get out of this; I hope I do. I think I will. I like to think that there's still more life ahead of me; that one day I might find that healing and be at peace. That I'll look back at this, and laugh or slightly cringe at how inconsequential this all actually is. For now, cheap iced coffee will have to do.

If you've read this far, I'm sorry for the rant and thank you. I've just been keeping these feelings locked up for so long and now it's just bursting all out. I hope you had a better day than I did!! :))

But stopping short of ""mindfulness"" + keeping as much focus on building positive interests and lifestyles around oneself is kinda the vibe I am looking for. I had a wonderfully over detailed overshare written but I let my phone hit 1% so now its all business and no fun. I'll bring this to my therapist tomorrow as a topic and skill to explore and work on.

If anyone can relate, I'm very confident about how I interact with some of my more difficult moods, sticky thought loops and just generally hard life circumstances. Its ongoing practice, but over the past few years I decided to open up to key friends and family (my mom is my rock, she cant relate, but is a perfect listener) about well for most just confirming I'm taking the idea of BP2 seriously.

No regrets about that really, although I could sense some folks trying to place the ""illness"" somewhere passively. Generally doesnt bother me, but it turned into a pretty sneaky way to ruminate - suddenly had the wherewithal to consider including my fiance, my mother and therapist into some of this ""work"" or positive set of practices I would like to develop.

Admittedly it is necessary to suggest an awareness of the more benign but harmless tells like pressured speech etc. But I genuinely feel that will be an afterthought once I get some directed momentum in my bones that doesnt have me passively checking in with everyone about if I'm being a good boy / human intrinsically.

I'm not threatening and I don't disparage people to the best of my ability, so I feel authentic in those regards. However I work in the entertainment industry, and while COVID brought some nice opportunities for work - 2 years on after the strike has left some openings. It is what it is, but I'd like to offload some of these \[what I perceive to be\] accelerating habits that seems hard for the collective consciousness of our broader society / social groups to shake - the endless sea of ""opinion sharing"" that now feels attached to the hip with ""fact finding"" missions nobody really is deeply invested in yet appears to manifest itself into a stasis of turnt behaviors and mindsets (I speak for myself), which I suppose the chronically online youth and old-youth would consider ""debate brain""

I could point this out as a conversation topic to a good friend and almost guarantee an 80% chance that someone will feel that irresistible pull towards putting the button on a topic - you know the one's like ""did you hear about the thing that happened"" Honestly,  im not really wanting to moan about it, just calling out this abstract complaint as one of the bad habitual perspectives I've let kinda morph into a negative worldview. Reminds me of other weird thinking patterns I've noticed and had to work through after simply understanding the concept of rumination.

So ... Any Chance there are Educational, Non-Fiction Resources & Tools for Developing and Practicing Healthier Habits for Hypomania? Positive attribute building without poo-pooing the world around me would be the vibe. I dont think getting caught up in say ""clarifying"" with a person mid conversation if they are seeking out facts or just spitting personal facts and truths into the wind with conviction ... only to then probably never actually return to thinking about the topic too deeply again. That fiery passion is likely turning vapor before their next dinner and certainly its a cloud of invisible gas pairing perfectly well with one's morning coffee and routine toilet painting session.

One innovative way to enhance the work environment is by introducing a [micro-market](https://ace-vending.biz/micro-markets/). These modern, self-serve markets offer a wide variety of snacks, beverages, and fresh meals, turning an ordinary breakroom into an inviting hub for employees. Here are some actionable tips on how to use a micro-market to make your workplace more welcoming.

**1. Offer a Variety of Food Options**

A key feature of micro-markets is their ability to provide diverse food and beverage choices. Stock your micro-market with items that cater to various tastes and dietary preferences, including:

* **Healthy snacks** like fruits, nuts, and protein bars.
* **Specialty items** for dietary restrictions, such as gluten-free, vegan, or keto-friendly products.
* **Comfort foods** for those craving traditional snacks or hearty meals.

By offering a range of options, you show employees that their preferences and needs matter, making them feel valued.

**2. Create a Comfortable Space**

The design of your micro-market and surrounding breakroom plays a significant role in creating a welcoming atmosphere. Consider the following:

* **Seating arrangements:** Provide comfortable chairs and tables where employees can relax or collaborate.
* **Lighting:** Use warm, inviting lighting to create a cozy environment.
* **D√©cor:** Add plants, artwork, or inspirational quotes to make the space visually appealing.

A well-designed micro-market area encourages employees to take meaningful breaks and recharge, contributing to a positive work culture.

**3. Integrate Technology for Convenience**

Modern micro-markets come equipped with self-checkout kiosks that accept cashless payments, including mobile wallets and prepaid accounts. This streamlined system makes transactions quick and easy, reducing stress and wait times for employees.Additionally, some micro-markets offer loyalty programs or mobile apps for tracking purchases and earning rewards, adding an extra layer of convenience and engagement.

**4. Promote Social Interaction**

A micro-market can serve as a central hub where employees gather and interact. Encourage team bonding by hosting events like:

* **Snack tastings** to introduce new products.
* **Coffee chats** to promote casual conversations.
* **Wellness challenges** where employees can track their healthy choices.

By fostering a sense of community, your micro-market becomes more than just a place to grab food‚Äîit becomes a space that builds relationships and camaraderie.

**5. Showcase Employee-Centric Values**

The presence of a micro-market signals that your organization prioritizes employee well-being. When employees see that you‚Äôve invested in a convenient, diverse, and inviting space for them, they‚Äôre more likely to feel appreciated and engaged.

**Conclusion**

A micro-market is more than just a vending solution‚Äîit‚Äôs a tool for transforming your workplace into a welcoming and supportive environment. By offering variety, creating a comfortable space, integrating technology, and fostering social interaction, your micro-market can enhance employee satisfaction and productivity. Investing in this modern amenity is a small step that delivers significant rewards for both your team and your organization.

I, 26F, and my husband, 30M had been married for 3 years now. my husband isn't the most affectionate man you could find, and he's a bit distant. for concept, he's in military as a lieutenant so he gets deployed a lot, which makes it harder for us to spend some time together. so, last month, he came back after a long deployment that lasted for 6 months. and of course I was excited to have him back and he was gonna be home for a whole month. last night, we were having intimacy and the middle of it, someone called him and he paused to answer it. it was one of his sergeants, whom he is close with. let's call him Arthur for this post (not his real name). Arthur asked my husband if he'd like to come to the bar with him along with some other teammates, and my husband agreed. it was around 11 p.m., and I wasn't expecting him to leave me in a moment like this.

this morning, I woke up to find my husband making some coffee for himself, and he walked over to hug me but I didn't hug him back, which confused him. he asked me about it and when I told him that I was mad at him about what happened last night. we got into a argument and he told me that I was overreacting and he had every right to go out with his teammates, but he sees them almost every day since they go to those deployments together. he haven't talked to me since this happened and I don't plan on going to bed with him tonight. so, AITA?",12,1737623036.0,AmItheAsshole,34,0.88,False

**I (30F) am breaking up with my (30M) fianc√© to give him the chance to have kids with someone else.**

**Relevant Backstory:**  
I‚Äôve had PCOS for about seven years now. I stopped taking pills to regulate my menstruation on the fifth year. As a result, I no longer get my monthly cycle, and I haven‚Äôt been able to address it yet since I‚Äôm working day and night to provide for my family and my 10-year-old son. I am a breadwinner and a single mom.

I am his third girlfriend, and he has never had a child of his own.

**Here‚Äôs the story:**  
We met on Tinder, and after matching, we chatted on Facebook for months. That‚Äôs also where he courted me. I found him charming and loved how good he was with kids, as he takes care of his ten nieces and nephews. He was jobless when we met, but that didn‚Äôt bother me. As long as he was loyal and treated me with respect, I was okay with it.

Before I agreed to be his girlfriend, I told him about my PCOS. I explained that I might not be able to get pregnant again. He assured me that it was okay, saying I already had a son or that he could just treat his nieces and nephews as his own.

I reiterated this many times, sometimes creating scenarios where we might not have kids at all. Every time, he said it was fine and that if it was God‚Äôs will, he would accept it.

A few months ago, I started noticing him becoming distant. We live together, but we barely talk because I‚Äôm always working (I work from home). When I log off from work, I often find him already asleep. When he wakes up at night to prepare for his job, he wakes me up too, makes coffee for me since I‚Äôm about to start my night shift, and then leaves.

My work hours are from 10 PM to 3‚Äì4 PM the next day, Monday to Friday. I have Saturdays and Sundays off, but I usually spend them catching up on sleep. I still try to make time for him, but lately, he spends most of his time smoking or playing mobile games outside the house. He only comes in when he feels sleepy, so we barely have conversations anymore.

Recently, he admitted that the reason he‚Äôs been distancing himself is because he really wants to have his own child‚Äîsomeone who will call him ‚ÄúPapa.‚Äù I reminded him that I really can‚Äôt have another child, at least not right now. To reverse my PCOS, I‚Äôd have to stop working nights, exercise regularly, and give up sleep deprivation and coffee‚Äînone of which are currently possible given my responsibilities.

So, I told him we should break up. At least this way, he‚Äôd have the chance to meet someone who could give him what he truly wants.

But if I could be selfish and ignore what he wants, I wouldn‚Äôt want to break up. He‚Äôs the best guy I‚Äôve ever had. He‚Äôs never cheated or given me a reason to doubt him, which has allowed me to focus on work. However, staying with him, knowing I‚Äôd be holding him back from his dream, breaks my heart.

First of all: No kids!!   

Why don‚Äôt other lines do this?  I mean, that alone, was amazing.  

The embarkation and debarkation was a breeze, unlike anything I have experienced before.

The ship was SO clean!  They clean nonstop.
I think if I had dropped a crumb, they would have cleaned it within seconds.

The shows are far superior to other lines.

The activities are terrific.

The ship seemed uncrowded, which I loved.

The only thing that I feel they should work on is getting better food.  (I am a serious foodie and Michelin star collector, so I am pickier than most.)

With that said, I loved the pizza and the food at Pink Agave was great.

The little touches, like mood lighting, really make the ship fun.  

They also include many things that other lines don‚Äôt - gratuities and free WiFi. 

And as a serious coffee drinker, their coffee is 10/10.
Better than most coffee in my large city.

I wish VV had more sailings.   I cannot wait to go again!!

**Relevant Backstory:**  
I‚Äôve had PCOS for about seven years now. I stopped taking pills to regulate my menstruation on the fifth year. As a result, I no longer get my monthly cycle, and I haven‚Äôt been able to address it yet since I‚Äôm working day and night to provide for my family and my 10-year-old son. I am a breadwinner and a single mom.

I am his third girlfriend, and he has never had a child of his own.

**Here‚Äôs the story:**  
We met on Tinder, and after matching, we chatted on Facebook for months. That‚Äôs also where he courted me. I found him charming and loved how good he was with kids, as he takes care of his ten nieces and nephews. He was jobless when we met, but that didn‚Äôt bother me. As long as he was loyal and treated me with respect, I was okay with it.

Before I agreed to be his girlfriend, I told him about my PCOS. I explained that I might not be able to get pregnant again. He assured me that it was okay, saying I already had a son or that he could just treat his nieces and nephews as his own.

I reiterated this many times, sometimes creating scenarios where we might not have kids at all. Every time, he said it was fine and that if it was God‚Äôs will, he would accept it.

A few months ago, I started noticing him becoming distant. We live together, but we barely talk because I‚Äôm always working (I work from home). When I log off from work, I often find him already asleep. When he wakes up at night to prepare for his job, he wakes me up too, makes coffee for me since I‚Äôm about to start my night shift, and then leaves.

My work hours are from 10 PM to 3‚Äì4 PM the next day, Monday to Friday. I have Saturdays and Sundays off, but I usually spend them catching up on sleep. I still try to make time for him, but lately, he spends most of his time smoking or playing mobile games outside the house. He only comes in when he feels sleepy, so we barely have conversations anymore.

Recently, he admitted that the reason he‚Äôs been distancing himself is because he really wants to have his own child‚Äîsomeone who will call him ‚ÄúPapa.‚Äù I reminded him that I really can‚Äôt have another child, at least not right now. To reverse my PCOS, I‚Äôd have to stop working nights, exercise regularly, and give up sleep deprivation and coffee‚Äînone of which are currently possible given my responsibilities.

So, I told him we should break up. At least this way, he‚Äôd have the chance to meet someone who could give him what he truly wants.

But if I could be selfish and ignore what he wants, I wouldn‚Äôt want to break up. He‚Äôs the best guy I‚Äôve ever had. He‚Äôs never cheated or given me a reason to doubt him, which has allowed me to focus on work. However, staying with him, knowing I‚Äôd be holding him back from his dream, breaks my heart.

I spent nearly two years begging countless doctors to find what was wrong with me. I was consistently being dismissed & given antibiotics for UTI‚Äôs that never existed. 
In August of 2024, I had a mental breakdown to my gyno who kept insisting I ‚ÄúMUST have something like chlamydia that we‚Äôre missing‚Äù even though I was already tested for the ‚Äúroutine‚Äù STDs multiple times & was NOT having sex (as it was unbearable to attempt). Finding out it was Ureaplasma Parvum was the biggest weight lifted, but little did I know how long the journey would be. 
This was the WORST experience of my life & I wish that was an exaggeration. I would not wish this on my enemies. The constant burning in my urethra & bladder was unbearable. I couldn‚Äôt pee without feeling like something was trying to come out of my urethra (which was horrible because I always felt like I had to pee). I was not able to date anyone for long periods of time because I physically could not take ‚Äúthe next-step‚Äù without bleeding & crying in pain. 
My first round of just two weeks of doxycycline failed. I then saw an infectious disease specialist who put me on a 3 day round of doxy and two weeks of azithromycin.  We did it this way because the doxy was making me feel very sick & the doc didn‚Äôt want to make me feel worse than I already did. During this cycle of meds I experienced my already unbearable burning systems x10000 due to herx reaction. I quite literally thought I was dying. BUT!!!!!!!! I FINALLY AM NEGATIVE AND GETTING BETTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (After being tested for it a month after my meds and that test being ‚Äúlost‚Äù, üôÑwhen does it end lol!!!!)
Once I finished the meds, it took 1.5 months to finally START feeling normal. For the first 3 weeks after meds, the residual systems were just as brutal. I was convinced I still had it. I think for me it just had to run its course. The only two notable things I could imagine have brought relief from the residual symptoms would be that I do Pilates regularly & that I would insert a boric acid suppository a few nights a week to combat the lasting symptoms for the first few weeks (not saying do this but it was the only way I could sleep night, ask your doc). I notice my biggest flare ups now are when I‚Äôm dehydrated (typically in mornings, after a night of drinking alcohol, or after coffee).

There is an end in sight and it becomes so much more manageable as time goes on!!!! I really feel like I lost a portion of my life because of this but I‚Äôm SOOOOO relieved to have it back! You are not alone and you got this!!!!!",2,1737621395.0,Ureaplasma,1,1.0,False

But have you ever wondered what would happen to your body if you gave it up completely? No more cookies, sodas, candies, or even that sneaky spoonful of sugar in your coffee. It sounds terrifying at first, but the results might just be sweet enough to convince you to give it a try. Let‚Äôs take a fun, week-by-week look at how your body reacts to living without added sugar for 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and even 1 year. Spoiler alert: you might never want to go back!

# [1 Week Without Sugar: The Tough Start](https://medhouse.info/en/quit-sugar/)

Welcome to the sugar detox! The first week is often the hardest. Why? Your body is addicted to sugar, and it‚Äôs not going to let go without a fight. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening:

* **Day 1-3:**¬†You might feel tired, cranky, and perhaps even a little foggy-headed. This is your brain throwing a tantrum because it‚Äôs not getting its regular dose of sweetness.
* **By Day 5:**¬†Cravings start to subside. You‚Äôll notice your energy stabilizing throughout the day without the sugar highs and crashes.
* **Benefits:**¬†Improved focus, less bloating, and better digestion. Your body is already thanking you!

Fun Fact: Sugar activates the same brain pathways as drugs like cocaine. No wonder it‚Äôs hard to quit!

# 2 Weeks Without Sugar: The Breakthrough

Congratulations! You‚Äôve survived the hardest part. At the two-week mark, some real changes start happening:

* **Clearer Skin:**¬†Bye-bye breakouts! Without sugar causing inflammation, your skin begins to glow.
* **More Energy:**¬†Instead of sugar spikes, your energy is steady and reliable. You might even notice you‚Äôre waking up feeling refreshed.
* **Reduced Cravings:**¬†Sugary treats don‚Äôt seem as tempting anymore. In fact, an apple might taste just as sweet‚Ä¶ weird, right?
* **Mood Boost:**¬†Those emotional swings caused by sugar crashes? Gone. Hello, happy you!

Pro Tip: If you‚Äôre still struggling, load up on naturally sweet foods like berries and sweet potatoes to curb cravings.

# 1 Month Without Sugar: A New You

After one month, the benefits are undeniable. You‚Äôve officially kicked the sugar habit, and your body is thriving. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on:

* **Weight Loss:**¬†Cutting out sugar often means cutting out empty calories. Without even trying, you might find your pants fitting looser.
* **Better Sleep:**¬†No more tossing and turning at night. Your stable blood sugar levels help regulate your sleep cycle.
* **Improved Heart Health:**¬†With less sugar, your triglyceride levels drop, reducing your risk of heart disease.
* **Stronger Immune System:**¬†Sugar suppresses your immune system, so without it, your body can fight off colds and infections more effectively.

Fun Fact: Sugar feeds the bad bacteria in your gut. Without it, your gut microbiome starts to heal, improving digestion and overall health.

# 3 Months Without Sugar: Transformation Mode

By now, quitting sugar is no longer a struggle. It‚Äôs your new normal, and your body is LOVING it:

* **Sharper Mind:**¬†Studies show that cutting sugar can improve memory and cognitive function. Your brain fog is a thing of the past.
* **Better Metabolism:**¬†Your body‚Äôs insulin sensitivity improves, making it easier to process carbs and fats efficiently.
* **Fewer Aches and Pains:**¬†Less sugar means less inflammation, which can alleviate joint pain and chronic conditions.
* **Healthier Skin:**¬†Your collagen production gets a boost, reducing wrinkles and keeping your skin youthful.

Pro Tip: At this point, it‚Äôs safe to reintroduce occasional natural sugars like honey or maple syrup if you crave something sweet‚Äîin moderation, of course.

# 1 Year Without Sugar: A Life-Changing Decision

Quit Sugar You‚Äôve done it. An entire year without sugar. What‚Äôs changed?

* **Weight Management:**¬†Your weight has likely stabilized at a healthy level. Plus, your body composition has improved, with more muscle and less fat.
* **Disease Prevention:**¬†Your risk of type 2¬†[diabetes](https://medhouse.info/en/how-to-reduce-the-risk-of-diabetes/), heart disease, and even certain cancers is significantly lower.
* **Enhanced Taste Buds:**¬†Food tastes better. You‚Äôll be shocked at how sweet fruits like bananas and strawberries are now.
* **Longevity:**¬†Without sugar aging your cells, you‚Äôre setting yourself up for a longer, healthier life.

Fun Fact: Many people report feeling 10 years younger after a year of living sugar-free. Who needs a time machine when you can just quit sugar?

# The Global Sugar Problem: Stats from the U.S. and Europe

Did you know that the average American consumes about¬†**17 teaspoons of added sugar per day**? That‚Äôs nearly¬†**57 pounds of sugar annually**, far exceeding the American Heart Association‚Äôs recommended limit of¬†**6 teaspoons for women**¬†and¬†**9 teaspoons for men**¬†per day. This overconsumption is linked to rising obesity rates, with approximately¬†**42% of adults in the U.S. classified as obese**.

In Europe, sugar consumption varies by country but is still a concern. For example, the average German consumes around¬†**103 grams of sugar daily**, while the average Brit consumes about¬†**93 grams per day**. Both figures exceed the World Health Organization‚Äôs recommended limit of¬†**50 grams per day**¬†(or about 12 teaspoons).

The impact of excessive sugar isn‚Äôt just personal; it‚Äôs societal. In the U.S., the annual healthcare cost associated with sugar-related conditions, such as¬†[type 2 diabetes](https://medhouse.info/en/symptoms-of-diabetes-what-you-need-to-know/)¬†and heart disease, is estimated at¬†**$1 trillion**. Similarly, in Europe, the economic burden of obesity‚Äîclosely tied to high sugar intake‚Äîis projected to reach¬†**‚Ç¨70 billion annually**.

But there‚Äôs good news! Studies show that even a¬†**10% reduction in sugar consumption**¬†could lead to significant improvements in public health and reduce healthcare costs dramatically. By choosing to go sugar-free, you‚Äôre not just benefiting yourself; you‚Äôre contributing to a healthier global trend.

# Bonus: The Emotional Transformation

It‚Äôs not just your physical health that benefits from ditching sugar. Your emotional well-being gets a major upgrade, too:

* **Confidence Boost:**¬†You‚Äôve accomplished something many people only dream of. That‚Äôs worth celebrating!
* **Positive Relationships:**¬†With fewer mood swings, you‚Äôre likely a better partner, friend, or parent.
* **Mindful Eating:**¬†You‚Äôve learned to listen to your body and give it what it truly needs, not just what it craves.

# Tips for Success

1. **Start Small:**¬†Don‚Äôt quit cold turkey. Gradually reduce sugar intake to avoid withdrawal symptoms.
2. **Read Labels:**¬†Sugar hides in unexpected places like bread, salad dressings, and sauces. Watch out!
3. **Find Alternatives:**¬†Use natural sweeteners like stevia or monk fruit when needed.
4. [**Stay Hydrated**](https://medhouse.info/en/signs-of-dehydration/)**:**¬†Sometimes cravings are just your body‚Äôs way of asking for water.
5. **Celebrate Wins:**¬†Treat yourself to non-food rewards like a massage or a new outfit.

I lived a very unhealthy lifestyle. But then when we went on a trip, I saw my photos and I really looked unhealthy, I was obese. 

I then saw a youtube video by ""easy, actually"" on losing weight. I decided to finally lose weight when I was dating someone.

I drink about 3-4 liters of water everyday

This is my diet plan+routine usually- 

Wake up at 3:30 Prepare a nice cup of black coffee and do some light cardio and meditate

Take a cold shower and do my skincare(I have also started skincare since august I did not care much before this)

Have a bowl of high protein oats about 40-50g with skimmed milk.

have a protein shake by me while I start doing my exercise(pushups, planks, tricep extension, squats, mountain climbers, crunches, flutter kicks etc)

lunch: grilled chicken with steamed veggies

do my usual work and go for a nice walk at 5pm and return by 6 have a snack in between, mostly popcorn.

prepare my dinner which is usually boiled egg whites about 4 and steamed cabbages and broccoli. sometimes I just make salad and eat it at once.

meditate for 10 mins and sleep by 8:30.

Today‚Äôs a big day for me, and I wanted to share my journey with all of you. I‚Äôm thrilled (and a little nervous) to introduce [**TabQuest**](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/tabquest?utm_source=other&utm_medium=social)‚Äîa productivity and organization-focused browser extension I‚Äôve been building with so much love and late-night coffee over the past few months.

TabQuest started as a small personal project. I always struggled to keep my online life organized‚Äîjuggling bookmarks, tasks, notes, and random tabs felt chaotic. I thought, ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt there something simple, elegant, and focused on helping people like me?‚Äù So, I decided to create it myself.

The idea grew into something bigger as I realized that this isn‚Äôt just a problem for me but for so many others‚Äîstudents, professionals, creators, and developers who want their browsers to work *with* them, not against them. That‚Äôs when TabQuest evolved into what it is today:

‚ú® **Key Features:**

* A clean, customizable UI that feels premium.
* Tools for managing bookmarks, tasks, and notes, all in one place.
* A built-in search that lets you find what you need instantly.

Security and privacy are super important to me, so TabQuest doesn‚Äôt collect unnecessary data. It‚Äôs also free 100%.

I‚Äôd love for you to check out TabQuest and share your feedback! It‚Äôs live on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and other browsers. If you‚Äôve got ideas or suggestions, I‚Äôm all ears‚ÄîI want this to be a tool that genuinely helps people.

Thanks for reading and for being such an inspiring community. Let‚Äôs keep building cool stuff together! ‚ù§Ô∏è
