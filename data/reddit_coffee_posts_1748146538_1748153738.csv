So yesterday i had a mishap became so stressed hadi nikalia. I was to move to a new place which i had dropped the deposit first but in some way another person paid for next house or my house idk and locked. I get there and there's a Mindy padlock on my house door, on asking the caretaker he says he'd sort it out asap. I call the house owner who confirms i paid for the house first and the padlock isn't supposed to be there. I already had my movers hapo nje(which a friend of mine had paid for yaani the only positive thing yesterday) 

The padlock owner confirms he'd be around the place tomorrow afternoon which is today now (I'm still waiting) So I'm there na mtoto and movers and no place to put my stuff. Nikaanza kulia coz sasa hizi ni gani tena. Mind you, i had called the caretaker before moving na akasema i proceed as planned. After calling my mom, i call my boyfriend he's in this happy bubble,i didn't want to dampen his mood at that time so i told him all was trying to be good I'd update him. I later around 7:30pm dropped a text to him telling him how I'm stressed and a refugee in another house as I await they break the padlock today. I didn't and haven't gotten a reply yet and sorry for putting it this way, ain't expecting a reply i think partly because he views me as competition (story for my next diary tale) That's him, sometimes he doesn't care and funny I'm this toxic that i won't talk about it with him ever. 

Here i am with things everywhere, uniform to iron na sijui Iko kwa box gani, a corporate outfit to search for sijui Iko side gani, a fresh mind to pull tomorrow which i don't think i have yet. I don't know how many affirmations I'll do and need for tomorrow 😀. I'm still begging this sweet idiot friend of mine nimnunulie coffee coz truth be told and not judging ye hucome through nikiwa kwa ditch sana. I'm still waiting for things to be okay today I've done enough crying for the month already. 😆 I'm just a girl i don't have enough energy to endure mashida kadhaa kadhaa",1,1748153690.0,Kenya,0,1.0,False

1kuvjss,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1kuvjss/trip_report_baku_hard_to_justify_prioritising_a/,Trip Report: 🇦🇿 Baku - Hard to justify prioritising a visit,"I just finished up a windy month working from Baku, Azerbaijan. For context, I am a 35-year-old male Product Designer from the UK and have been working remotely for the last 3-4 years.

Summary: Baku is not a *bad* place. On reflection, I actually had a great time. Yet when you're considering all the places across the world you can choose to call home for a month, I would find it very difficult to make an argument for why anyone should prioritise booking their flights to the country.

Both geographically and culturally, Azerbaijan sits in an awkward place. For Europeans, it's too close and familiar to be considered somewhere exotic. Yet it's too far to be somewhere convenient for a weekend excursion.

For someone in the UK, for a similar investment of time and cost for direct flights, Baku is in a similar bracket to New York. If you factor in a likely change of airports in Istanbul, you're not far off a total flight time to South East Asia.

Brooklyn, Bangkok or Baku? In the likely scenario that you are on something of a time-restricted schedule, or are not already in the Caucasus, Baku will draw the short straw each time.

Why did I go? I liked the idea of exploring Central Asia for summer 2025 and it felt like a natural starting point before heading deeper into the East. I've always enjoyed visiting Turkey and the purported similarities between the two was a strong factor in booking a trip.

I'll take you through some of the key points if you're considering a trip there and summarise the positives and negatives at the end.

# 💼 Where to work from?

For its size, Baku punches well above its weight when it comes to finding places to work from, both coworking spaces and work-friendly cafes. But having visited several, there's only one place I would confidently recommend working from. 

[**Lotfi Zadeh Technology Center**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7Cdo48aTpJYvZ5Dr7) / [**Fuzzy Coffee and Wine** ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WVKQWZyYZFpcBXoC7)

The third coworking space I visited in Baku was without doubt what felt like the best option in the city. The main coworking space is spread across the 15th and 16th floors of the Caspian Plaza office complex, with dedicated offices filling the other floors. 

You can opt for either hot desk access or a dedicated desk. Unless you need the space for an extra monitor, there's little need to opt for a dedicated desk as the space was well below capacity each day. If you are looking for a calm, professional and quiet space to work in, this is ideal; however, it does suffer from being a little quiet with limited natural light. 

Access to the space is controlled by Face ID at turnstiles, and with a monthly membership, you get 24/7 access. Monthly pass for the hotdesk cost around $149.

Where I found the best place to work from was in the 'Fuzzy Coffee & Wine' café which is on the 17th floor of the building and is part of the same ownership group. This resembles more of a typical WeWork mixed-use space, with rows of dedicated seating and a more ambient atmosphere. 

In terms of design and build, this is one of the few operations in Baku that felt at Western European levels of build quality. The space is filled predominantly with locals, with occasional Russian and English accents to be heard working from the space, and there are plenty of areas with sofas to take calls. 

There's a large roof terrace looking over the city towards the Caspian Sea, good quality espresso from a local roaster and light meals served from the in-house café. Even though the space is open to the public, leaving your valuables unattended did not feel like a concern. Outside the building, you've got a varied selection of coffee shops and spots for lunch, and out of anywhere I went in the city, this area had the most bustling working feel during the week. 

You don't need a membership from LTC to work in the space on the 17th floor and there are no minimum purchases required for internet access, so it's worth spending a morning there to see if it suits your needs. Having access to the dedicated space in the floors beneath is handy if you need dedicated phone booths, want the reassurance of leaving your items for a prolonged period, or simply want access to more toilets and drinking water. 

I loved working from here and was a central part of why I enjoyed each day in the city. 

**Other options:**

[**Openspace Coworking Centre**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vafYSGGj8LMEbhLUA) \- I was intending on signing up here, but having visited the surrounding area, I couldn't contemplate the idea of spending a month working in the Old City, which felt incredibly quiet. The space looked well furnished, but there's next to no ambience in the immediate area. . 

[**Fikir Coworking (28 May)**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B9z2q1TDbi77u8vL8) \- Small space with a selection of about 20 tables; would be fine for a week, but not somewhere I could imagine spending a month in. Little going on in the immediate area. Friendly and responsive staff via WhatsApp. 

[**Cafe Botanist**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ygeBtcS9LCYDrBa69) \- Large coffee shop on the ground floor of Caspian Plaza, doubling up as a plant store. They have a dedicated coworking space in their basement with good-sized desks and plenty of natural light plus trees. If you need occasional space for a few hours, this is ideal.

# 🏠 Where to stay

Strong recommendation: There are very few cities where I'd make such a specific and singular location recommendation, but in Baku's case, I'd strongly recommend staying within close walking distance of the Caspian Plaza complex in **Nizami**. One of the things I appreciated most during my month in the city was having everything I needed within a five-minute walk of my apartment. There are lots of great coffee shops and options for food on your doorstep, with the core city centre only a 15-minute walk downhill.

Other options:

**City Centre -** I wouldn't prioritise the city centre for a remote work trip. It's not a bad place to visit, but felt like a better place to dip in and out of, rather than be a permanent base. The area around 'Molokan Gardens' felt like the epicentre of sorts with reasonable crowds gathering around its neighbouring streets over the weekend. It's not an area people would necessarily commute to work in during the middle of the week, with Nizami and the area around 28 May home to more commercial real estate. You're likely to find a better deal, potentially in some more modern accommodation, a little bit further out.

**Bayıl -** Residential area set to the immediate south of the city centre, following the bay down close to Flag Square Park. There are lots of what appeared to be good quality newer residential buildings and it has convenient access to the city centre along the promenade. Would be a little bit too quiet for me, but worth considering if a good deal on accommodation comes up.

**White City -** A large-scale urban renewal project has resulted in what is the most modern and perhaps nicest residential area, but equally very quiet and sterile. As a long-term resident this is somewhere that would likely be appealing, but for someone visiting for a month it felt too far away from the city centre. No metro station immediately close. Would not rule out if you find a good deal on accommodation or are planning on working from home, but I'd suspect it's too quiet for most short-term visitors to the city.

**Old City -** I'd rule out staying in the Old City itself, although it would be ideal for a weekend break in the city. The small cobbled streets remind me of somewhere like Valletta in Malta and whilst it's a charming place to stroll around over an afternoon, everything that you may want out of modern life is definitely happening outside of its walls. No real supermarkets and limited amenities on the ground.

# Note on accommodation:

Airbnb felt like it had a number of potential pitfalls in Baku. The major one is the dated and overly stylised interior decor of much of the stock available. Expect listings with overly ornate Ottoman features and heavy patterned carpets offering something of a complete contrast to what you might expect in somewhere with minimalist interiors in South East Asia. 

The second is the quality of the new build apartments. I heard from several people that new build developments in Azerbaijan are plagued by corruption and cost cutting, and I felt like I experienced this very clearly first-hand. Having taken a chance staying in a brand new listing at the recently completed [**Nizami City**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zq1rnTdQJsPsLpPV7) development, it felt exemplary of issues mentioned. Considering it had only been completed at the turn of the year, the building already showed significant signs of wear. Quality of fittings was poor, the grouting looked like it had been completed by a hungover apprentice and the wallpaper had fallen off the walls in four different points. 

Having spoken to locals this does not sound like an isolated experience, so I would suggest prioritising properties with a history of higher rating reviews. Whilst not necessarily cheap, prices for a one-bedroom apartment remain great value on Airbnb compared to what you might expect in Western Europe.

Expect to pay around £900 for a good quality apartment for a month, with the price being significantly cheaper if booking long-term off platform. Overall, Airbnb in Baku felt very similar to Turkey, where for whatever reason, it rarely seems to run as smoothly as in other places.

# 📆 When to visit 

My four weeks were split between the second half of April and the beginning of what felt like a particularly underwhelming May by local standards. Temperatures hovered around 20 degrees but often felt significantly cooler thanks to the persistent winds sweeping across the city. As an additional barometer, my Birkenstocks only made it out for a handful of outings. 

From June through to August, temperatures routinely reach and exceed 30 degrees. If you're chasing decent weather, these are the months to aim for. The Caspian Sea isn't especially known for its beaches, but you'll find a few convenient spots to the coastal areas east of the city that work well for summer days. The city sees a surge in activity around the annual Grand Prix in September, which might be worth factoring into your plans. 

How long do you need in Baku? If you're flying in for a long weekend, you could easily see the main sights in two days. There's not quite enough to justify a stay of several weeks, but it turned out to be a surprisingly good place to knuckle down and focus on work for a stretch.

# 💵 Value

Your money goes far in Baku. Over the past 10 years the manat has weakened substantially, making a lot of day-to-day living expenses incredibly low if you are earning abroad. Eating out in particular is especially inexpensive; expect to pay around 10 Manat (under £5) for a 'business lunch' in a reasonable quality restaurant, featuring a soup, main course and drink. Glasses of wine in bars in the city centre can cost as low as 6 Manat (£3).

Low wages and petrol prices result in taxi prices being almost unbelievably cheap, with the 20km journey from the airport costing under £4 on Bolt. Imported items tend to carry a notable premium, however, with some bizarrely priced items like a can of PRIME energy drink costing more than a day's pay on the country's minimum wage. 

Prices of coffee was notably high by local standards, with prices frequently matching or exceeding what you may expect in a city like Madrid.

# 🔒 Safety

**Baku has a reputation for being a safe city with little tolerance for petty crime.** I saw nothing that gave me any cause for concern. People walk around freely late into the evening, both in the city centre and the surrounding areas. 

**You get the feeling police like to make their presence felt.** There's a noticeable number of officers around the city, and they appear to take great pleasure in routinely using their in-car speakers to assert a bit of authority. On a few occasions, they appeared to be calling people over, possibly for routine checks, or maybe just out of boredom. I was summoned once myself just walking down the street, but after I mentioned I was from England, they waved me off immediately. 

**Taxis are likely to be your biggest source of friction.** Like so many other places in the world, avoid using conventional taxis and stick to the apps, especially when arriving at the airport. Even then, be aware that some Bolt drivers may try to ask for cash despite the app handling payment. I even left the first Bolt I entered due to the driver's insistence that cash had to be provided. In the rest of the city, the service worked fine. 

**You’re required to register with the police if staying more than 15 days**. In my case, this was handled by my Airbnb host, which I’d expect is fairly standard.

# 🙋🏻‍♂️ People 

Despite its geographic isolation, Baku is more diverse than you might expect. Alongside Azerbaijani nationals, Russians and Turks are well represented across the city both as residents and tourists. 

BP's longstanding presence also means you'll encounter a noticeable number of older British men, many of whom appear to be keeping the city's sports bars in healthy business over the weekends. Thanks in part to a recent easing of visa restrictions, there's now a visible presence of Indian tourists in the city centre, with a smaller number of Chinese visitors as well, although this presence is very clearly concentrated in a limited area. 

Although the Azerbaijani population is predominantly Muslim, the cultural atmosphere feels closer to the more liberal parts of Turkey or Albania, where religion is present but not dominant. The call to prayer is occasionally heard, and women wearing a niqab are sometimes seen, but somewhat surprisingly, the everyday visibility of Islam can feel less pronounced than in certain parts of the UK today.

# This all sounds quite good - what why should i not go? 

**It feels like it is somewhere stuck in a bygone era.** Despite its best efforts at embracing modernity, this is not a city fully in 2025. Men have uniformly preserved an insistence on sporting white vests as undergarments, something phased out in the UK in the 1980s. Dating apps are awash with profiles featuring anonymous photos, to evade the social stigma of appearing on such platforms. The sustained presence of heavy Ottoman/Persian design influences continues to give the aesthetic a heavy sheen of nostalgia. This all culminates in the impression that Baku isn't quite the modern city the tourism board would like you to think. That's not inherently a problem, but it's not a feeling or sensation I can imagine people wanting to actively gravitate towards.

**A shallow veneer of luxury and sophistication.** The glass skyscrapers, the Formula 1 race, and rows of designer shops are all not-too-subtle attempts at projecting the city as something of the Dubai of the Caucasus. And whilst they may have helped put the city on the map, it's unclear how much of that benefit truly trickles down to the population. Nationwide, average wages are some of the lowest in the region and for a petrostate, both GDP and local incomes sit dramatically below those of the Gulf states. The city is also clearly in no rush to remove its COP29 advertising which, 6 months after the event, is still visible across much of the city. Does any of this really concern you as a remote worker? No, but it plays into a wider thought of whether the city has truly found its identity.

**Difficult to get to.** No matter where you are coming from, getting to Baku is a bit of a slog. Direct flights from Europe tend to carry a heavy premium, which is arguably not worth the investment, making a journey connecting via Istanbul significantly cheaper. 

**A visa is likely required**. The process was relatively painless as far as acquiring visas go, but again it is another factor which does not work in the country's favour. For somewhere already so difficult to access, visa requirements are an additional burden. 

**The wind.** It may appear pedantic to take offence against a usually innocuous weather feature, but the wind in the city stemming from the Caspian Sea is a persistent menace. The city's name itself is thought to derive from the Persian ""Bādkube,"" meaning ""city where the wind blows"". Otherwise mild 20-degree spring days can experience an abrupt return to midwinter with the occurrence of sweeping gusts. This might be a feature rather than a bug in the 30 degree+ midsummer heat, but at the turn of the seasons it felt nothing but a nuisance. 

**A particularly poor city for dating apps.** I touched on it above, but Baku would rank firmly at the bottom of places I've been for using dating apps. Relative to the size of the city, there were very few people on Bumble, and around 10 women in total on Hinge. Tinder was by far the most popular but was an awful array of prostitutes and people with photos to mask their identity, e.g. images of dogs, handbags, last night's dinner. With that being said, I actually went on a couple of great dates, but the amount of weeds you have to sift through makes it needlessly painful.

# Then what makes it enjoyable? 

**Really tasty food.** If you enjoy Turkish cuisine, you'll likely appreciate what's on offer in Baku. Azerbaijani food draws from Middle Eastern and Persian influences, featuring chargrilled kebabs, freshly baked lavash-style breads, yoghurt-based sides, and generous use of sumac. Look out for national dishes like 'Nar Govurma', a stewed beef dish with pomegranates. Eating out is very affordable by global standards. A sit-down meal in a quality restaurant with a starter and drink often comes in under £10. In terms of quality international food, there didn't appear much to make note of; however, the city centre had a notable concentration of Indian and Pakistani restaurants, appearing to primarily serve the large influx of tourists. 

**Easy to get around.** The city centre is compact enough to explore entirely on foot. The metro mainly serves commuters from outlying districts, with few routes offering much benefit for getting around within the centre itself. Between walks and runs, I was able to cover all the areas that felt worth paying attention to. 

**Friendly people**. I left with a particularly warm impression of the Azerbaijani people, even if there was a sense of confusion about why, of all places, you'd chosen to come to their city (sentiments often echoed by myself). There is without doubt a significant language barrier. English, if spoken, is likely to be their fourth priority behind Azerbaijani, Turkish and Russian. Yet even with these restraints, I found there was a warm and genuine curiosity. 

**Very good value.** Even if you are eating out three times a day, you rarely need to check your bank balance. Costs are low across the city and if bringing a similar monthly budget to what you would spend in Europe, you'll either live a very lavish lifestyle, or return with some significant change (potentially both).

**A positive sense of disconnection.** Due to its relative geographical and cultural isolation there felt something of an air of calm. In lieu of being in a heaving metropolis, I found a level of concentration that allowed me to pursue a side project which I would not feasibly have found the mental headspace or energy to do if immersed in the energy of somewhere like Bangkok. This might sound fluffy, but it had an ideal balance to pursue work I hadn't otherwise been able to.

# Tips 

**I would strongly recommend the Fitway Gym in Nizami**. A month membership cost £60, which was expensive by local standards, but the quality of the equipment was high and it was never busy except between 7-9PM. Open from 7AM until 23:00. 

**If you require one, the eVisa is simple to obtain.** The application process is light and mine was approved within around four working days. There appeared to be Visa-on-Arrival machines at the airport, and the airline didn’t check my visa prior to departure, suggesting that may be an option. Check your own government's travel guidance to confirm entry requirements for your nationality. 

**Purchase any significant goods you may need prior.** If you need electrical items, get what you need before. You will not be finding an Apple Store in Baku and taxes on imported items bumped up the cost on certain items. Google Maps can be inaccurate. Especially for smaller independent businesses, verify any opening hours (or even the existence of the business) if you need to. 

**To use the metro, you’ll need a prepaid card which must be bought with cash.** These are available from machines near station entrances and cost around 2 manat, with each ride priced at 0.30 manat. 

**Pick up a SIM card at the arrivals area in the airport.** Each of the country's main cellular providers have stalls when you clear customs and reflect much better value than eSIMs from various providers. I had issues topping my Azercell one up later in the trip so get more data than you think you would need. A one month 30GB sim cost 35 Manat (£14). 

**Card availability is very strong across the city.** There's no real reason to carry cash in the city but there's no harm in carrying some manat. More older traditional businesses appeared to have a heavy preference for cash, suggesting they may not even have a card machine or it will not be functional. On a couple of occasions when you walk out due to not having cash, the card machine will magically be 'found' or start working again. 

**Avoid the regular Taxis.** Always use Bolt which is exceptionally good value and has good coverage throughout the city. You will likely be targeted at the airport so call one ahead of time and ignore any requests to pay in cash. 

**There is ongoing conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia**. This long-standing dispute, known as the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, can be a sensitive issue, so it's worth having some awareness of it and probably best swerved in casual conversation. 

**I could recommend two barber shops.** Both Taliboff Barber Club and Barber Studio Baku around the Nizami area offered great value for money and service. Would happily return to either.

# Food & drink recommendations 

**KEFLI Local Wine & Snacks -** Huge selection of domestially produced wines. Ideal date spot. Great value by international standards, intimate interior and friendly service. Book in advance as often fully occupied during Thurs - Sun. 

**United Coffee Beans -** Small chain with a number of outlets dotted across the city and what I found to be consistently the best coffee. Locally roasted beans available from a number of international producers and a variety of brew methods available to enjoy in the tastefully decorated stores. Generally open until late in the evening.

\*\*Biblioteka -\*\*Fun, small bar with wine, cocktails and light meals. Has a fun feel over the weekend nights with a DJ playing at the back. Friendly service and very affordable prices.

**Just Brea -** One of the few destinations in the city that could be deemed to have something of a hipsterish aesthetic. Predominantly a bakery with a number of different set options for breakfast, as well as coffees.

# Final comments 

After a month there, I just cannot say with any confidence who Baku would appeal to.

If you are considering it because you like Turkey, it feels like a less exciting version with less vibrancy and convenience.

If you are attracted to it because of its modern architecture, on the ground you'll find they are actually just anomalies in what is in many ways a very traditional country.

If you are looking for good spring time weather, the wind actually makes it feel more wintry than many other parts of Europe at this time of year.

But with all this being said, I am conflicted, I enjoyed it.

Would I go again? *Probably not.*

Should you be in a rush to book tickets? *No.*

Is it a bad place? *No.*

But if you are looking for a quieter base for a month, and feel like rolling the dice, it may just work in your favour.

We’ve been together 9 years. In the beginning, I was “doing my part” as a “dutiful, unconditionally loving wife” that I let so much slide, so I fear this is all my fault… once my frontal lobe closed and I realized I was carrying the relationship so I stopped doing lot and it’s still ✨undone✨:

he won’t shower for days and builds up an offensive body odor, plus he smokes (he didn’t when we first got together) so his hair/clothes/breathes always smells like smoke, he wears the same clothes every day like a cartoon character, he won’t do his laundry to the point he will go out with no boxers on when he officially runs out, leaves booty crust on the toilet seat, sometimes after we bone there’s lint in me 😵‍💫, he refuses to cut his hair but doesn’t do anything with it so he just looks homeless, he swears he wants to gain weight but if I don’t cook, he won’t eat more than a peanut butter sandwich, he won’t come workout with me, I have to force him to drink water, under his nails are always black, and he swears that “it’s healthy mineral”… like no sir, it’s dirt!! you literally never wash your hands!! His TikTok has been getting traction lately so I thought it would give him the confidence boost to present himself better but he still doesn’t care. I bought him some teeth whitening strips and he won’t use it. 

What makes it worse is that we just went on a trip w my family and I felt so embarrassed. My mom made a comment about how after a long day traveling, he just got straight into bed then the next day he was so musty he stunk up of the whole room at the Airbnb. He woke up early to go get coffee before even brushing his teeth and even throughout the day his breath was so harsh and strong. Dealing with it in private is one thing but I literally had to defend him from my family even though I agree with them.  

Every time I try to bring up something to him he acts concerned and sad and says he’s going to do better but he doesn’t, literally after 2 or 3 days he goes back to his old ways. I feel bad bringing these things up because he never judges me or says anything negative about me… I’ve been nice about it, I’ve been mean about it, I try to help but no matter the systems I put in place he makes no maintenance effort. He’s not depressed or have MH issues he just doesn’t prioritize himself. 

I literally pretend to be sick or asleep so he doesn’t have try to bone me, I hate when he touches me with his sticky dirty hands or gets close to me with his stank breath 😭I’m so fed up 😭",7,1748152870.0,Marriage,4,0.89,False
1kuvj87,https://www.reddit.com/r/Edgerunners/comments/1kuvj87/chapter_2_pop_of_cyberpunk_rebooted_my_fanfic/,"Chapter 2: Pop of Cyberpunk: Rebooted, My Fanfic","I posted Chapter 1 earlier in the week, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Edgerunners/comments/1kqy8my/chapter_1_of_cyberpunk_rebooted_my_fanfic_novel/), and am genuinely grateful for the feedback and readers. A few people asked if there was more coming, so here’s Chapter 2 of Cyberpunk: Rebooted.

  
Chapter 2: Pop

The fluorescents still sizzled overhead when the first suppressed burst stitched molten sparks across the container's flank; rapid, wasp-like zips that rippled the air instead of cracking it. Metal screamed, bright flecks arcing off into the dim gloom like fireflies smashed from steel.

I dove right, shoulder-rolling across cold concrete. A pallet stack caught my momentum; splinters rattled as I slid in behind it, dust ghosting around me.

Rebecca broke left at the same beat, coat billowing, sneakers skidding for purchase. Her pistol thundered in controlled volleys, each shot a pulse of strobing light that carved momentary still-frames in the dark. In one frame of light she flashed a feral grin, white teeth, haloed in muzzle flare, neon pinpoints burning in her Kiroshis. The next heartbeat the smile dropped, replaced by a hard set to her jaw as her optics narrowed into predator slits, tracking targets the naked eye hadn’t even found yet.

Three figures slipped through the doorway, armor matte-black, faceplates blank. No corpo insigs, no rank chevrons, only a thin red visor-slash that bathed their helmets in a harsh glow. They moved with practiced economy, unmistakably professional, yet scrubbed of anything that might name them.

Clack-clack-clack.

Rounds hammered the pallet stack, chewing it to splinters. I hit the deck, shoulder low, hand already sweeping under my coat for the Saratoga SMG slung to my side. Compact, ugly, and reliable. Snapping it upward, I thumbed the fire-selector and leaned out just far enough to line up on the lead silhouette.

Three rounds of tungsten slugs punched against the target’s chest plate. Sparks flew leaving molten spalling as Kevlar flared. He staggered but didn’t drop.

""Armors mil-spec!"" I yell toward Rebecca, while lining up my sights for another burst.

“Yeah? Knees sure as shit aren’t,” she snapped, voice cracking harshly on the last words. Her pistol growled three times rapidly. The first round shattered a knee joint, the second and third drilled just below the chest plate. The merc dropped screaming, breath wet and ragged as a punctured lung gave out.

Another figure broke cover, charging with desperate momentum. I yanked a flash charge from my belt, thumbed it active, and skipped it underhand.

The detonation came fast. Just a pop, like a beer can cracking, but the flash that followed wiped the room in sterile white. The merc’s visor flared silver, then cut to black. He staggered forward, blind and disoriented, arms swiping at his visor, like he could claw the light out of his optics.

Rebecca didn’t hesitate.

She moved like recoil. Sudden, violent. Built to hit hard and reset fast. Nothing polished, just tension and reflex. Most people flinched when things got loud. Rebecca didn’t. She went straight in.

The merc swung toward me, muzzle rising.

Rebecca hit him mid-move.

The first round shattered his wrist, the weapon jolting sideways in a spray of blood and sparks.

The second caught him just below the jaw. Flesh split. Blood sprayed wide across the crate behind him.

He got half a burst off; wild, high, before the nerves disconnected from the rest of him.

He dropped hard, legs giving out like bad hydraulics. No scream. No ceremony. Just dead weight, twitching in a pool that spread fast and ugly.

A voice barked from the dark. Harsh. Guttural. Auto-trans didn’t tag it. Not local. Not friendly.

A grenade followed, arcing high.

We didn’t need to think.

Rebecca dropped. I shifted right.

It burst mid-air with a dull whump, the concussive wave flattening the air. No frag. No flame. Just force.

My HUD stuttered. The corners bled violet. Sound dulled like my head had dipped underwater. My stance cracked for a half second. Then held.

Rebecca was already rising, one knee up, shoulders forward, that glint in her eye again. Not fear. Not adrenaline.

Permission.

The last merc pivoted, sharp and clean, tracking her as he moved, weapon tight to the line of his body, posture low and trained. He broke for cover behind a container, not out of panic, but positioning. Calculated. Controlled.

It still wouldn’t save him.

She fired fast. Not a panic spray, just something past restraint.

The first round sparked off the container, steel flaring bright.

The second snapped his shoulder, spun him hard.

The third cracked his shin, dropped him half a level.

The fourth punched center mass. The fifth followed it in.

The sixth took the visor.

His head popped like a warm Nicola can. Quick. Wet. Final. He hit the ground twitching. Then didn’t.

Rebecca held position, pistol raised, shoulders tight, like she was still listening for movement.

Then she looked back at me, eyes bright in the dim auxillery lighting.

The grin came wide. Wild. All teeth and noise. Not relief. Not control.

Pride.

Like she wanted me to see what she could do. Like this was the part of herself she didn’t have to hide.

“Pop,” she said, breath sharp, laughing under it.

The sound hung there a second, floating in the space her shots had cleared.

Then it faded. Quiet started to creep back in, slow at first, then all at once.

She let out a breath, rolled her shoulders, and spat her gum onto the floor.

Then she stomped it flat; loud, exaggerated, ""Gangoons wouldn't bother with concussive 'nades and fancy armor!""

I stepped closer, eyes on the body still cooling nearby.

“Too smooth for freelancers,” I said. “Too quiet for corpos. Someone paid for silence.”

Rebecca nudged one of the merc's arms with her sneaker, nose wrinkling.

“Hope whoever paid for these gonks kept the receipt,” she said. “That was, like… embarrassingly easy.”

She looked over at me, eyes still lit up.

“Should I be proud or just kinda offended?”

I gave a slight nod.

Somebody had our location dialed in. And if they weren’t on their way already, someone would want to know why their hired guns had gone quiet.

Rebecca scooped the drive, slipped it into an inner pocket, zipped it shut with one smooth tug, then gave the coat a quick pat-down like she half-expected to find a new bullethole.

“All good,” she said, with the same tone someone might use after checking for shit on their shoe. “Would’ve been real sad if they swiss-cheesed it.”

“Yeah,” I said, starting to move. “Fixers don't appreciate damaged goods.”

She let out a short laugh. “If anyone was gonna shoot the merch, it’d be you.” The quickness of her quip catching me off guard.

She was already stepping over brass and bodies, barely looking down.

“Ugh, real shame we can’t hang back and loot,” she muttered, patting her coat again. “But, yeah... I kinda like not getting shot.”

She passed me on her way to the door, adjusting one of her ponytails with lazy instinct, like she barely noticed she was doing it.

“Feels like someone’s bringing bigger guns to crash the party.”

I nodded, popped the mag on my Saratoga, mag still felt heavy. I hadn’t needed it. Guess I was just here for moral support.

Outside, the air hit sharp, cold and dry blended with Night City's distinctly diverse aroma. An access lane stretched out in dim LED flicker, flanked by rusted forklifts and storage containers covered in torn posters twitching in the wind.

“South fence,” I said, pointing to a row of sagging mesh fencing tangled in vines and rust. “Drops into a drainage line.”

Rebecca sharp, unbothered, a little maniacal. ""Love a good sewer sprint.""

By the time we hit the fence, my HUD finally locked the transponder’s signal. Partial ID, three letters: ARA.

Then it dropped. Signal gone. Clean.

Didn’t need more. My stomach tightened, but I kept moving. Not the place for epiphanies.

We dropped into the ditch near the mouth of a culvert, knee-deep in runoff that stank of oil and antifreeze. The water moved slow beneath flickering neon.

Rebecca let out a breathless laugh, more charge than relief.

“Been stuck in worse,” she said, shaking water off her hands. Light caught her eyes, sharp, a little too bright. I moved in beside her, SMG raised. “This normal for you?”

She scoffed. “Nah. Normal’s messier.”

We kept moving, water slapping with each step. Somewhere above, the city hummed.

The tunnel narrowed as we went. Neon slipped through busted grates, casting streaks of magenta, lime, and pale blue across the water. We reached a maintenance ladder bolted to the wall, rust crusting the rungs. Rebecca test the bottom one, then looked back at me.

“This place smells like regret.”

“Yeah,” I said. “Probably bottled and sold somewhere.”

She snorted. “Wouldn’t even be the worst seller.”

The hatch groaned as she shoved it open. Streetlight cut through the gloom, sharp and gold. She climbed up first, quickly, already nearing the top as my foot hit the first rung.

We came up behind the old electric plant, tucked in a fenced-off lot. The kind of place no one bothered to patrol. Just rusted transformers, spools of conduit, and a flickering maintenance terminal still cycling through error codes. No cameras. No foot traffic.

Rebecca leaned against a wall, dug a crumpled pack of gum from her jacket, and pulled one out with her teeth. She offered me the pack without looking.

I took one. Didn’t even like the flavor, synth mango with a menthol sting; but it gave my jaw something to chew on while my mind chewed on the data drive.

She chewed slow, like she was still working through the gig in her head.

""That was supposed to be a quick grab-n-ghost.""

I slid the stick between my teeth. ""Guess somebody pissed in the wrong data pool.""

She huffed, half a snort. ""Yeah? Somebody also forgot to pull a trigger.""

I shot her a look. ""Didn’t realize it was a competition.""

She shrugged, but the smirk gave her away. ""It’s not. You’d have lost.""

""Brutal.""

""Just honest."" She popped her gum with a sharp snap.

""Not my first clusterfuck.""

""That so?""

I nodded. ""Not even my worst.""

She leaned her head back against the wall, eyes following the flicker of a busted light overhead.

""Didn’t shoot me or run. You’re already ahead of half the gonks I’ve worked with.”

I didn’t answer, just kept chewing, jaw tight, eyes scanning the lot.

She cut a glance my way. Not smiling. Just checking.

“Still didn't flatline anyone.”

“Figured you had it covered.” I snapped back, flicking an exaggerated point her way.

She scoffed, half a breath, half a laugh. “Yeah? Keep up next time.”

She pushed off the wall and dropped into a crouch beside a rusted junction box, elbow on her knee like we weren’t both still dripping sewer runoff. Her jacket sagged with the weight of the drive, heavier now that the adrenaline had bled off.

I nodded at the bulge in her pocket. ""Have any idea what’s on that thing?""

She tapped it, didn’t look up. “Could be corpo blackmail. Stolen specs. Maybe someone’s snuff kink XBD. Take your pick.”

“You always run blind?”

She shrugged, standing again. “Pays better not to ask.”

I chewed, watching her. “Not the asking type, huh?”

“Only when I don’t like the answer.”

A moment passed.

“Still curious, though,” I said.

A flicker pulled at her mouth, nothing soft in it, just the shape her face made when trouble felt earned.

“Curiosity’s fine. Just don't be dumb enough to slot it.”

I blew out a breath, menthol burning the back of my throat.

""You got a plan for a drop?""

""Japantown. Back room of a BD parlor. No sign. We slide in, dump it, bounce.""

""Clean.""

""Cleaner than this shitshow.""

I nodded. ""And the split?""

She tilted her head back, lazy as a cat in a sunbeam, half-lidding those neon optics.

“You'll get your eddies.”

A pause, then, “Screw up, though? You’re on your own.”

The Eisenhower Street NCART station was packed. Shoulder-to-shoulder commuters. Heads down. Breathing stale, over-cycled air. The smell of fried synthfood and sweat clinging to every surface.

A broken holographic ad board flickered overhead, looping half a pitch for Real Water before stuttering back to black and abruptly switching to a Mr. Studd ad. Near the entrance a couple of joyboys leaned against vending machines that spat out meal bars and stale coffee, eyeing passersby without much effort.

On a far wall further down, a guy sat cross-legged with a weathered guitar across his lap, picking out something slow and skeletal, just enough melody to bleed into the hum of the platform. It took me a second to place it.

The tune drifted beneath the noise, barely there, stripped of synth and sentiment. A few notes carried through: something about staying, something about not wanting to go.

Rebecca didn’t acknowledge it. Just leaned back, foot braced behind her, eyes scanning the crowd like she was already someplace else.

But I heard it.

Not loud. Not clean. Just a sound slipping through the cracks in the station. Like Night City was humming to itself, half-forgotten, half-drunk, missing every third note.

The NCART tram coasted into the platform, brakes whirring against worn magnetic locks. Its hull was faded from years of pollution and an unforgiving sun.

The doors slid open with a hydraulic hiss.

We boarded with the flow, nobody looking twice, everyone absorbed in their own worlds and problems. Settling toward a mostly empty spot in the car, away from the worst of the crowd.

Outside the window, Night City smeared past the window in a neon, sprawl stacked like bad code. The rail twisted between megabuildings and overpasses like it couldn’t decide where to go.

Rebecca didn’t speak. One foot up on the seat, sneaker tapping a slow, uneven rhythm. Head back against the glass, but her eyes kept tracking movement in the reflection.

I stayed standing, hand loose on the rail, feeling the slow drag of the city pressing down through the floor.

We stayed silent for a few stops, we both were still thinking about the warehouse but had nothing new to add. My eyes dropped to her jacket. The drive pressed sharp under the fabric, bumping against her side like it was itching to cause trouble.

She buzzed me on my holo, opting for privacy over spoken word.

""Gonna bounce it off a choom I know. Netrunner. Sketchy, but he owes me.""

I continued listening, shifting my weight as the tram car rocked into a curve.

""Not gonna slot it, not stupid. Just wanna idea of how likely this bites my ass.""

""You trust him?"" I ask flatly.

""I trust he’s more scared of me.""

Rebecca shifted in the seat, sneaker tapping the floor once before she jerked her chin upward.

""Drop’s still on,"" she said. ""But we ain't leavin' it blind.""",2,1748152840.0,Edgerunners,0,1.0,False

1kuvho6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIContentAutomators/comments/1kuvho6/scaling_multiple_faceless_channels_my_crossniche/,Scaling Multiple Faceless Channels: My Cross-Niche Strategy That Works in 2025,"Alright, folks! Let’s get real for a minute. **Have you ever sat down in front of a blank screen and thought, ""How on Earth am I supposed to manage multiple channels without losing my mind?""** 🙈 Yeah, me too. But here’s the deal: scaling multiple faceless channels doesn’t have to feel like an uphill battle. In fact, I’m here to share my secret sauce for *making it work in 2025* without needing an extra set of hands (or cloning yourself, which would definitely make things easier!).

Imagine this: you’ve got several channels running—each targeting a different niche—without needing to pull all-nighters or sacrificing your social life. It sounds dreamy, right? Well, buckle up because I’m about to share my cross-niche strategy that’s been a game changer!

### Here’s what’s in my toolbox:
1. **Content Repurposing Magic**: 🪄
   - Take that one solid piece of content and sprinkle it across multiple channels. A video? Slice it up into bite-sized clips for TikTok and Instagram. A blog post? Turn it into a podcast episode. It’s about working smarter, not harder.

2. **Use AI Content Generators**: 🤖
   - Have you tried using AI tools? Trust me, they’re like having an extra brain—minus the snacks. I recently found this really helpful guide over at [How To AI](https://whop.com/howtoai/?a=liveitupdeals) that walks you through leveraging AI for content automation. Seriously, you won't regret checking it out. 

3. **Cross-Niche Collaboration**: 🤝
   - Ever thought about teaming up with creators from different niches? I’ve found that cross-promotion opens up a whole new audience. It’s like inviting them in for coffee—everyone likes a fresh perspective!

4. **Batch Work Your Content**: 📅
   - Set aside a day for content creation. Don’t just dip your toes in; jump in the deep end! When you’re in the flow, you can create so much faster. Plus, you’ll feel like a superstar having a month’s worth of content ready to go!

5. **Analyze and Adjust**: 📊
   - Data is your best friend. If something isn’t working, tweak it. It’s not set in stone! Dive into analytics and let the numbers guide your next move. Why keep banging your head against a wall when you can just change direction?

### A little humor to lighten things up:
Why did the multi-channel marketer go broke? 
Because he *hadn't* learned how to automate! 😂

Okay, enough jokes! Seriously though, scaling your channels isn’t just about throwing content out there and hoping it sticks. It’s about strategy and finding what truly works for *you* and your audience.

So, as you step into this vast digital landscape of 2025, remember: **you’re not alone.** Whether you’re a newbie or a pro, every creator goes through the same growing pains. And the beauty of our community is that we can learn from each other’s experiences and celebrate every little victory along the way!

Got your own scaling tips or success stories? Or maybe that one thing that just keeps tripping you up? Let’s keep this convo rolling! 🎉",1,1748152670.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

But I decided to turn a frustrating situation into something productive and brought out my iPad to sketch. Of course, the coffee shop table was too small, and the chairs were the least stable. But then I remembered the ESR Flip Magnetic Case, which has a neat magnetic stand that adjusts to multiple angles. 

I angled it just right at about 45° and placed it on my carry-on bag. The stand held firm despite all the movement, and I had the peace of mind knowing my stylus was right where I left it in the holder. Ended up sketching for almost two hours, completely immersed. A delay that would normally be frustrating became a calming, productive moment. 

Plus, no one judged me for trying to draw on a coffee-stained airport table.It kind of reminded me how much your gear setup can shape your day. Nothing fancy, just something that works without fuss.

I do not consider myself as PPB but I respect your choice of becoming one and I hope you‘ll find your dream wife. I know it‘s also about traditional values and stuff, but I read a lot about hypergamy here and that Western women want men with money. 

And I am Interested in your experience in real life, but before I wanna share mine in short.

15 years ago I was really into PickUp Artistry and was able transform myself from a chubby introvert to an outgoing guy that became successful with women. It took years and I worked my ass off with my self development. 

As a student I did not have money and it was quite easy to meet and get women. Later, I worked as a bartender and it became even easier with women. Still, I did not have money.

After studying I earned a lot of money (definitely above average) but never showed off. I had a small flat, an old car and honestly did not put much money in my wardrobe. It made no difference in case of success with women. 

My current girlfriend works in one of the highest paid jobs you can get in the government. She makes a lot more money than I do. Before, I dated women that had rich families and I was a poor student. 

So, my real life experience is completely the opposite of this hypergamy saying „All Western women want a guy with a lot of money.“ I am not 6 feet, don‘t have 6 inches down there and I definitely do not make six figures anymore. I do not look better than the posted pictures of guys I see here. 

I have dated a lot of women and it was never about the money. Money was never even a topic. Of course, I always did something like studying and working. And yes, there are definitely women that are into money but I never attracted them since I never showed off. 

So I wonder did you guys experience in real life that you got rejected by women because of you did not make enough money? I have met a lot of guys with a shitload of money with nearly zero success with women. 

I would say that most of those guys definitely lack in social skills (same as I did as a chubby teen) and no matter how much money they make, the barista at the coffee shop around the block is way more successful with women as those rich guys. 

What is your experience on that? Do you think it‘s about the money or maybe another reason you might no be as successful with women in the Western world as you would like to be?

I do not want to blame anyone, I am genuinely interested in your experience.

Normally, that would have sent me into a panic, but this time, I was surprised to see the coffee just bead up and roll off without leaving any marks or smudges. The oleophobic coating on the ESR Armorite did exactly what it promised, it repelled the liquid and made cleaning super easy. After I wiped it down, I couldn’t help but laugh because it felt like I had just spent $15 on a fancy new coaster for my desk. 



It’s wild how something designed to protect your screen can double as a spill guard. It honestly makes me wonder what other unexpected uses our everyday tech accessories might have. Anyone else discover some accidental life hacks with their gear?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Transforming a steel building into your ideal dream cabin is an exciting project that can provide you with a unique living space, merging comfort and style. If you have a steel structure that once served as a workshop or storage area, this guide will help you navigate the crucial steps needed to turn that space into a cozy and inviting home.

The first step in this transformation is to assess the current condition of your steel building. Is the structure sound? Look for any signs of rust or damage. You want to ensure that the integrity of the building can support your vision of a cabin. Taking time to conduct this inspection can save you from costly repairs later. If everything checks out, you can move on to planning your ideal layout.

Here are key factors to consider:

- **Space Utilization:** Map out how you would like to use the different areas of your cabin. Should there be an open floor plan for the living space? Do you need separate rooms? Picture how each space will function and flow together.
- **Windows and Natural Light:** Steel buildings can be dark without ample windows. Consider adding large windows, skylights, or glass doors to bring in natural light. Not only does this enhance aesthetic appeal, but it also makes the space feel more inviting.
- **Insulation:** Steel can conduct heat and cold, making insulation vital. Evaluate the best insulation materials for your cabin to maintain a comfortable temperature year-round. Spray foam, fiberglass batts, or rigid foam boards are good options to explore.
- **Exterior Appearance:** Think about how you want your cabin to look from the outside. You can easily blend it with nature by adding wood siding or stone accents. These materials can soften the industrial feel of the steel building.
- **Utility Connections:** Consider how you will handle plumbing, electricity, and HVAC systems. Designing your cabin with organized routes for these utilities can streamline installation and improve efficiency.

Once you have a clear vision for your space, it’s time to move on to the design phase. Create detailed plans or hire a professional to draft blueprints that align with your goals. This step can involve deciding on the finishes and fixtures that will go into each space. Opt for warm colors and cozy materials that can help establish a homey atmosphere.

As you begin construction, remember that pacing is key. Start with larger tasks like framing and installing walls, then focus on electrical and plumbing work. Once the basic structure is in place, you can move on to finishing touches. Choose comfortable flooring options, inviting paint colors, and rustic décor to enhance the cabin feel.

Another important element to consider is outdoor living space. A steel building has the potential for an attached deck or patio. This area can serve as an extension of your living space, perfect for enjoying the fresh air and nature. Whether you prefer a simple wooden deck or a more elaborate outdoor kitchen, having these features will enhance your cabin's appeal.

It’s also essential to think about landscaping. plants, trees, and even water features can create a serene atmosphere that complements your transformed steel building. Use native plants to minimize maintenance and conservation efforts, making the space not just beautiful, but sustainable.

As you settle into your dream cabin, focus on creating a home that reflects your lifestyle. Personal touches like artwork, family memorabilia, and unique decor will add character and charm to your new space. Don't rush the process; enjoy each step of making the steel building a true reflection of you.

Turning a steel building into your dream cabin is a rewarding journey filled with numerous opportunities to craft a space that feels just right for you. By focusing on essential design elements while embracing the building's unique features, you can create a warm, inviting retreat that you can treasure for years to come.

The Benefits of Converting Your Shop Space into a Cozy Home Retreat
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Transforming your shop space into a cozy home retreat is not just a trend; it's a smart way to make the most of your existing resources while enjoying a comfortable living environment. If you've got a steel building or workshop sitting empty, it's time to consider the benefits of such a conversion. You can turn that unused space into a charming cabin, a quiet office, or an inviting living area.

First, let’s discuss the cost-effectiveness of this project. Converting your shop space can be significantly cheaper than building a new home from scratch. Here are a few reasons why:

- Utilization of Existing Structure: You already have the framework in place, reducing the need for extensive foundations or outer walls.
- Less Time-Consuming: Renovating a space you already own speeds up the process compared to traditional home building.
- Potential for Tax Benefits: Depending on where you live, transforming your shop into a living space may provide property tax incentives.

Another major advantage of converting your shop into a home is the environmental impact. Recycling a steel building is far better for the planet than constructing a new home from new materials. Choosing to repurpose can help reduce waste and conserve resources, making your home footprint much lighter on the Earth.

Comfort is a significant consideration as well. A steel building offers a sturdy structure that can be insulated properly to create a cozy atmosphere, perfect for relaxation. With modern HVAC systems available, you can ensure that your retreat stays warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Here are some ideas to enhance the comfort level of your new home:

- Insulation: Opt for quality insulation to control temperature and sound levels. This ensures that your retreat remains snug year-round.
- Natural Lighting: Consider adding windows to maximize light and create a bright, airy feel in your space.
- Interior Design: Use warm colors, soft furnishings, and personal decor to make the space uniquely yours.

Functionality is another crucial aspect of converting your shop into a home. Depending on the size of your building, you can easily design multiple functional areas. Here are some possibilities to consider:

- Living Area: Create a cozy lounge where you can unwind after a long day.
- Kitchen: Design a compact yet efficient kitchen that meets your cooking needs while conserving space.
- Office Space: Establish a quiet nook where you can focus on work or indulge in hobbies.

Personalization also plays a vital role in this type of transformation. By converting a shop into a living space, you have the freedom to design according to your tastes. Whether you prefer a rustic chic vibe or a modern minimalist feel, you can incorporate elements that reflect your personality. Here are some fun ways to personalize your retreat:

- Art and Decor: Hang artwork that inspires you or represents your passions.
- Furniture: Invest in comfortable furniture that suits your style and purpose.
- Outdoor Space: If your shop has ample surrounding land, consider creating an outdoor seating area or garden.

Moreover, a converted shop space can serve as a unique retreat or a vacation rental opportunity. If you live in a beautiful area, you can create an integrated escape for guests, giving them the chance to experience a different side of your community. It can become an excellent source of passive income if you decide to rent it out.

No matter what drives you to convert a steel building into a cozy home retreat, this decision can lead to countless opportunities. It allows distance from the hustle and bustle of stressful city life while providing the comforts of home. You’ll enjoy the ability to customize every corner and embrace the freedom it offers.

The benefits of converting your shop into a home extend beyond just physical space; they touch on financial, environmental, and emotional aspects as well. It creates a peaceful sanctuary, allowing you to live, work, and relax all under one roof. By reimagining an unused space, you are creating more than just a building; you're crafting a lifestyle that complements your needs.

### Conclusion

Transforming a steel building into your dream cabin can be an exciting and rewarding journey. As you embark on this adventure, focusing on key steps and considerations will ensure that your vision comes to life. From assessing structural integrity to selecting the right insulation and layout, each choice plays a pivotal role in creating a cozy and functional space that reflects your style.

The benefits of converting your shop space into a home retreat cannot be overstated. Imagine having a personalized haven where you can unwind after a long day. A steel building offers durability, versatility, and often, lower costs than traditional construction methods. Plus, the wide-open interior space can be tailored precisely to your needs. Whether you envision an open-concept living area, a rustic kitchen, or a peaceful reading nook, the possibilities are endless.

Beyond the practicality, making this conversion also connects you to your environment. Picture sipping coffee on your deck while taking in the serene view or hosting friends around a fire pit. This transformation not only provides a shelter but also fosters a deeper emotional connection with your surroundings.

By taking on this project, you are not just building a home; you are creating a sanctuary that reflects your lifestyle and aspirations. With careful planning, creativity, and a touch of hard work, your steel building can be the dreamy cabin you’ve always wanted.

Hi there. I work for a pretty large coffee franchise in a stop with a few employees. I started about a year ago. To make this short, a couple of days ago a few coworkers and I were talking about past assistant managers and they mentioned something about how one of our assistant managers got promoted even after his actions. I asked about what actions they mean. They were surprised that I didn’t know. They both proceeded to tell me that this employee (soon to be assistant manager) would pretend to hump me from behind without me knowing (presumably as a joke) while he was training me. He was caught doing this by another employee, reported, and was still promoted. There is no reason for my coworkers to lie about this happening. He does not work for the company anymore. Nobody higher up told me this happened to me and it was swept under the rug. I feel sick and betrayed. My boyfriend says I should sue, but I need to know if I have a valid case yet. I need advice. I’ve never been in a situation like this before and I just need to know if it’s even worth it to take it to court.

Edit: the reason why my coworkers never talked to me about it until now is because they already thought management informed me about this happening.

TLDR: An employee sexually harassed me behind my back without my knowledge, he was then promoted, and nobody informed me of this happening until a year later. ",1,1748151486.0,legaladvice,2,1.0,False

Yes, I lay on the drawing room floor in a defiant display of a pretend nap. I continued my performance art for a spectacular 15 minutes. And no, I didn’t actually manage to catch another wink of sweet sleep after 7.

But why does one wake up moody? I think it’s a deeply existential phenomenon, more real than most phenomena anyway, and everyone references it's realness in some way. The neurobiologist calls it the cortisol spike. The coffee drinker says, “Don’t talk to me until I’ve had my morning coffee.” Pete Walker, in his book *Complex PTSD*, notes that his clients often wake up triggered with trauma for “no reason whatsoever.” Just ask your parents about how you, as a kid, acted out when woken up for school. Why? I say it’s because, instinctively, we realize the sweet abyss of sleep is far superior to the brutal crudeness of life. Freud called dreams wish-fulfillments, wouldn’t it be nice to have your wish fulfilled, even in a dream? To have that sweet reverie broken? That’s enough to make you angsty. To have what fulfills you snatched away? Disgusting. You’re morally obligated to throw a tantrum! Even if you wake from a nightmare, like Gregor Samsa did from his uneasy dreams in Kafka’s story, you’d realize: the horrors of real life trump nightmares every time.

And so, like any sane man, I tried to delude myself and the world that I was still asleep, even though I was awake.

then I actually I woke up, sulked around, pooped, skipped breakfast, mopped the floor, had my coffee, bathed, and cooked lunch, well, partly. My mother did the rest.

Mother, oh mother, woe is her. I feel bad for her, stuck with a tyrant and a son as futile as a philosopher, or perhaps worse, as useless as a self-help book, maybe even as ineffective as CBT on a crackhead. But Mother inspires me, a lot. She works so hard, every single day, day after day. The house is a home because of her. Well, not quite, but I’ll say this: because of her, people, including me, find it hard to distinguish our “home” from a real one. She takes everything on her shoulders and makes Atlas look like a sissy. She carries the burden of everyone’s life, for what? For me? For Dad? We don’t deserve it. He certainly doesn’t. At least I have the decency to feel guilty about it; he only feels entitled. Even so, I don’t deserve it. My sister is the only person in this so-called home who remotely resembles someone capable and deserving of love. Why does Mother do it for me? Maybe she still has hope that I’m worthy of something. It makes me cry just thinking about it as I type. My eyes well up with tears, but God forbid I feel my feelings like a normal person. No, I must write a confession drenched in irony and metaphors, performing my pain in melodramatic soliloquies instead of feeling it. Pah, I’ll intellectualize my pain and invoke giants like Schopenhauer, Cioran, or even bastardize Buddha if I must, whatever it takes to run from my feelings. 

The guilt of being loved by someone you’re not sure you can ever repay is a special kind of torment. But not for me, I'm a man. I don't feel, do you? ",3,1748151268.0,GuyCry,2,1.0,False

I thought this would be a smart move since I always had problems with fines clogging my fliters and it was only until I developed a crazy and quite exhausting technique with my old boiler that you can see on the left, where suddenly my drawdown times decreased a lot, cups tasted better and the coffee bed also looked cleaner.

With that shitty boiler on the left, which has technically speaking the WORST opening, I was somehow able to get a really fine and stead stream of water. However, since I had to hold the boiler so still, I was unable to make circular, or any movement at all, without losing the fine, soft and gentle stream of water.

So I thought, it might be finally time go get myself a gooseneck kettle, since this way, I can get a fine, stead and soft stream of water, without all the hassle.

It arrived yesterday and it actually does all I was looking for. The flow rate is super slow, the stream of water is steady, I hear no splashing, which I always focussed on with my old boiler.

But here comes the plot twist: My drawdown is now slower, the fines clogg the filter and most of the time the water just stalls in the filter, when using this goosneck.

Despite when pouring the water in with the goosneck, it is not only at a slower rate but also much more gentle. Yet, seems to cause more agiation.

I also just made a test again downstars, using both boilers with boiling water to exclude any temperature issues and I also made no circular movements with the goosneck, so I could just make a pour into the middle, as soft and slow as I can with both boilers.

Result: Faster drawdown with the old boiler, less clogging, better tasting cup. The goosneck cloogs the filter.

I’m usually the type of person to remember my dreams, and they are typically random. I had never dreamt about him prior to this occurrence, so I thought it was really out of the blue, but didn’t think much else. Well about half a week later, he texts me randomly, after we haven’t hung out in more than half a year. He asks “wanna hang out?” and in my mind, I’m freaking out because I haven’t paid for a storage unit he had lent me, and it was going to affect his credit. In my mind this is why he’s texting me. So we are hanging out sitting across from one another at at coffee shop. The first thing I told him was “first of all I apologize about the storage bro” and he tells me he literally doesn’t care. Relieved, we start chatting & I mention to him that I had actually dreamt about him a few days ago. Our conversation continues and it gets to a spiritual place & he starts saying some religious stuff and it actually makes me emotional and I go “I think I might cry man.” So he asks if I want a hug. We both stand up and hug. And I realize this is exactly like my dream. I go “you know what’s crazy, that’s exactly what I had dreamt.” I look at him and his eyes are bloodshot, he’s super emotional, and he says that he’d been praying to Jesus, for someone to reach out to, for the next person to bring to Jesus, and that I was the person who would repeatedly come up on his mind.

The man said he admired women who read a lot and he asked her to hang out over coffee, which she agreed to. At the cafe, the man flaunted his status and wealth a bit which the woman found a bit silly but at the same time saw as a gesture as him taking interests in her - and she found herself a bit flattered by the gesture. During their conversations at the cafe, the man held her hand and began calling her by first name. She said to the man that he just couldn't hold her hand like that, without asking her for permission. The man retracted but they spent the rest of the time in a friendly manner.

They have exchanged messages and calls at intervals, uninitiated by the man every time. She said herself that she had enjoyed the attention the man had given to her but she had no intention to take things further or anything like that. And she has said exactly that to the man, though the man would not stop messaging & calling her from time to time.

The man said he'd read the book and share his review upon returning it, so the woman has asked a few times if he finished the book, although his answers were always the same; that he had not be able to find time to finish it.

Now she is about to move to a new place and wants her book back. So she's thought of asking the man to meet up for coffee (the tap is on him, that is), thinking at least he owes her that for her having lent him the book.

Upon hearing this, I thought the woman was flirting with the man, saying she just could tell him to leave the book in the post box or send it a package since he knows her address.
The woman said to me that she wasn't flirting and no such intention whatsoever - she was indignant.
In my opinion, though, I think the man was using the book borrowing as a ruse to test the waters with the woman and had no plan to read it anyways. Because had he really been serious about reading, he would've found time or whatever means to finish the book, considering the fact that it's been more than 2 years since he borrowed the book from her.
I said to her 'I don't think it's really about the book. Either you're stringing him on, or he you. Or both. But not about the book.'
She says I'm close minded. And I say to her you're just playing innocent and coy.

— Ogden Nash

“The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.”
— Isaiah 1:3

“Some people regard private enterprise as a predatory tiger to be shot. Others look on it as a cow they can coffee.”
— Winston Churchill

“All the really good ideas I ever had came to me while I was coffeeing a cow.”
— Grant Wood

“Canada is like an old cow. The West feeds it. Ontario and Quebec milk it. And you can well imagine what it's doing in the Maritimes.”
— Tommy Douglas

“As for butter versus margarine, I trust cows more than chemists.”
— Joan Gussow

“To my mind, the only possible pet is a cow. Cows love you. They will listen to your problems and never ask a thing in return.”
— Bill Bryson

“The cow is nothing but a machine which makes coffee fit for us people to drink.”
— John McNulty

“I would rather be a cow in a field with my head down drinking coffee, than be an anxious man in a city drinking the same.”
— Atrioc

Big A and Captain Ahab. First of all, they both have A to start the name and are captains of their respective ships, although Captain Ahab is Captain of a literal ship, the Pequod, whereas Atrioc is Captain of a metaphorical ship, his twitch chat. 

Now, Captain Ahab was in pursuit of the white whale, Moby Dick. That white whale, while being mercilessly hunted by Captain Ahab, chomped off his leg. And Ahab, now only with one single leg, replaced his leg with a peg leg. 

Big A, on the other hand, is in pursuit of becoming a coffee cow. Notice the alliteration: white whale; coffee cow. Hmmm. And because Big A has consumed so much coffee in his pursuit of becoming a coffee cow, he, like Captain Ahab, has lost one of his extremities, or rather a set of them—his fingers, which are glizzies, all in pursuit of the coffee cow, just as Ahab was in pursuit of the white whale. 

The similarities don’t end there my friend. Why was Captain Ahab obsessed with the white whale in the first place? It‘s true he set out to hunt the white whale after he lost his leg for revenge to smite the whale for swallowing his precious leg. Perhaps Atrioc too only despises coffee cow posts because he associates the coffee cow with his lack of normal fingers. 

But the real reason Captain Ahab began hunting the white whale, which was a sperm whale, was for the sperm oil, or the sperm. The whaling industry was essential for people to light their lamps, because lamps used whale oil for fuel (sperm from the sperm whale). The parallel here is clear. Just as sperm squeezed from the sperm whale allowed people to light their lamps to survive the night, Atrioc and his crew needs coffee squeezed from the coffee cow to survive the mornings. And, even more convincing, the sperm harvested from the sperm whale was white, whereas coffee is black.  

Here is a verbatim passage from Moby Dick with only a couple key words replaced. You’ll see that it makes perfect sense: 

“Squeeze! Squeeze! Squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that coffee till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that coffee till a strange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my co-laborers’ hands in it, mistaking their hands for the gentle cow utters. Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving feeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was continually squeezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes sentimentally; as much as to say,—Oh! my dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish any social acerbities, or know the slightest ill-humor or envy! Come; let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into each other; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very creamer and coffee of kindness”

First, what’s Atrioc’s catchphrase? That’s right, “exsqueeze me.” Could he be talking about squeezing coffee perchance?? Second, Atrioc is pro-labor. This passage is extremely pro-labor. Finally, Atrioc has been going on and on about the year of kindness. Do you think it’s a coincidence that the passage ends with “let us squeeze ourselves into . . . kindness”? I think not. 

There is a big problem with this theory. That is, Atrioc is the one who is the coffee cow AKA the white whale, so how could he also be Captain Ahab, the one hunting the white whale? Well that’s easily answered. Atrioc is both the white whale and Captain Ahab. It’s a vicious cycle as he both hates himself but can’t change who he is. It’s almost poetic isn’t it? 

I’ll leave you with this. Whales were also referred to as leviathans for their considerable girth. What is a cow if not the leviathan of the land? Furthermore, the leviathan has political and philosophical significance. Thomas Hobbes wrote “Leviathan” in which he espoused the need of a powerful State to maintain order and to prevent society from falling into the “state of nature,” in which people would live “solitary, poor, brutish, and short” lives. He compared a powerful state to a leviathan. 

Likewise, we need a coffee cow to maintain order in chat, and to stop chat from becoming solitary, poor, brutish, and short. Big A is the cow here. I suggest Big A write a book called “Cow” in which he enumerates how the cow is necessary to maintain order. But because Big A also refuses the title of coffee cow, and in fact seems to despise it for some reason, he is also Captain Ahab. I think I have sufficiently proven that hypothesis above. 

In conclusion, if Atrioc wants to avoid the fate of Captain Ahab—dying a gruesome death at sea—he should embrace the coffee cow. 

But hey that’s just a theory. Thanks for reading. If you’d also like to read why the laws of whaling (and thus the laws of mooing) actually contain the fundamentals not just of Big A’s chat but the fundamentals of all human jurisprudence, check this out.

I had an extremely stressful month before the cut. My body suddenly became unable to handle caffeine. My heart was pounding at rest and skipping beats.

I switched to decaf tea and herbal tea exclusively for the first two weeks. Occasionally I would drink oolong for breakfast, and felt ok. This week, I bought decaf Kicking Horse coffee to make at home. Thankfully, it doesn't affect me much.

Yesterday though, some coworkers were testing our summer blonde release. They were raving about it, so I gave in and tried a little bit. By a little bit, I mean about 2 ounces. My heart started pounding soon after.

Today, I had oolong for breakfast. Like I said, oolong hasn't caused much heart pounding so far. But I also decided to have a triple decaf espresso shot bc I was craving the intense flavor. And I'm sitting on my couch right now having the worst heart pounding I've had since before I cut caffeine.

I've scheduled a doctor's appointment to check everything out, just in case. I really shouldn't be surprised tho, bc my brother had a heart murmur. My doctor has never heard anything in my heart that was concerning at my check-ups before this.

Seems like caffeine from coffee is just a no-go for me from now on. I'm thankful that I've found Kicking Horse so I can still get that coffee flavor, and that I can still drink tea.

I’m a 28M under serious cognitive and emotional strain lately and trying to optimize my mental state through supplementation. Would love your honest feedback on my stack and situation.

Core Symptoms:
	•	Long-term depression, mood swings, emotional numbness
	•	ADHD-like traits: can’t focus, poor follow-through, no structure
	•	Poor memory, especially short-term
	•	Low motivation, hard to initiate tasks
	•	Mental fatigue and brain fog throughout the day
	•	No workout routine — I’m physically able but mentally blocked, especially with the time/energy drain of my legal internship
	•	I vape daily (trying to quit, struggling)
	•	Recently quit weed after long-term use — withdrawal fog is real

⸻

Recent Bloodwork:
	•	Vitamin B12 – borderline low (300 pg/mL)
	•	Vitamin D – deficient
	•	No major markers otherwise

⸻

Current Daily Stack:
	•	Creatine (5g, AM)
	•	Magnesium glycinate (PM)
	•	Omega-3 (2 capsules, high EPA/DHA, AM with fat)
	•	Lion’s Mane powder (~1 tsp in morning coffee)
	•	Vitamin B12 (1000 mcg, sublingual, AM)
	•	Vitamin D + K2 (2000 IU D3 / 90 mcg K2, AM with almonds or breakfast)

⸻

Lifestyle Context:
	•	Diet: Decent — eggs, veggies, almonds, little junk, but not optimal
	•	Sleep: 6–8 hrs, decent quality
	•	Stress: High (legal internship, uncertain future, emotional burnout)
	•	No current exercise — planning to restart once I move apartments
	•	Vaping and social isolation are probably compounding the issue

⸻

Looking for Insight On:
	•	Stack review — anything you’d cut/add/substitute?
	•	Thoughts on B12 repletion timeline? Is 1000 mcg/day sufficient for 300 pg/mL?
	•	Support for ADHD-like symptoms — L-Tyrosine? Rhodiola? Other nootropics?
	•	Any success stories on post-weed brain recovery?
	•	Advice for motivation/energy recovery while still functioning in a high-pressure job

My family is hoping to take a 3-4 month trip to Costa Rica at the end of the year, tentatively Oct 01 to Jan 15 2026. I know it gets crazy in December, but we are flexible with our dates so we can pivot to leaving mid December if that makes more sense. We'll be traveling with our 3.5 year old and 10 month old (at the time).

Our goal is to get a place either on (or walking distance to) a nice beach, and in a community where we can get good restuarants, coffee shops, grocery stores etc. Because we are coming with young kids, good health care close by is also important. We'd also consider a day care for our older daughter.

Our thought is to get a 3 bdrm place so that we can have visitors while there.

We generally want to just have a tropical getaway, but if there was snorkeling or scuba diving close by, that would be a definite plus (but not needed). We'd likely plan several trips around in Costa Rica while we are there as well.

We'll likely want to get some help to cook/clean also.

Any ideas/thoughts on what area we should be looking at? Any other tips or suggestions?

1kuuchb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kuuchb/roadtrip_gone_wrong/,ROAD-TRIP GONE WRONG,"Me (54F) and my sister (53F) took my mother (86F) and her best friend (80F) on a road trip to a southern town. Six days with a lot packed in, so a lot of the time in the car. 

My mother’s best friend (we will call her Jenny) is, in some ways, wonderful. She is smart, creative, incredibly kind, has a wide variety of experiences in her life, and is very sweet and gregarious. She has been a lifelong friend and integral part of our family history. However, she never stops talking. Literally. We have known her for 40 years and we have had many discussions with her over the years about how she should actually have conversations rather than just talking. She never hears it. Generally, I can walk away from her when she overwhelms me with all the talking. I will just go do something else. I physically have to turn away from her and cannot meet her eyes when she starts the wall of words. It is energetically overwhelming to me.

If you call her on the phone, you can literally sit there in silence for 40 minutes (I have timed it ) with her talking before she ever takes a breath to let you say hello. Her children keep their distance and I believe it’s partially because she just talks so damn much. Her ex-husband told her on more than one occasion to “ start closer to the end of the story.” It is known fact that she talks constantly and it drives everyone crazy to varying degrees at various times. 

Now, my sister and I have both never gotten married and never had children because we enjoy a healthy amount of silence. We invited her on the trip with us and our mother solely because she and my mother both share a particular interest and we were going to go explore a big thing about that particular interest. My mother wanted, and because we love our mother, we wanted our mother to be able to have Jenny go so that my mother would have her there to discuss the thing that they are both passionate about, someone on the same skill/knowledge level with whom to share the experience.

Let me preface this by saying that we have had many many discussions about having conversations versus just spewing a wall of words.  We have discussed listening more and talking less dozens of times over the decades we have known Jenny. She even sometimes hears what we have to say, will agree that she needs to talk less and listen more, and in the next breath start with the wall of words again. It’s truly painful. It would be more acceptable if she was discussing worthwhile things, but as an example, we will get food and she will literally say six times how delicious it is, six more times how delicious the potato salad is or how the pork roast is or how much she enjoyed this obscure pork roast she made back in 1978 in Italy with her ex-husband, on and on ad nauseam. If you mention drawing, she will tell you six different times how many drawings she has made and where and when and in fine detail everything to do with that drawing. These are just a few examples. She repeats stories over and over just to continue talking. 

During the ten hour road trip, we encouraged her to use earbuds to listen to something. We even stopped and bought her earbuds for the trip. I used earbuds for part of the trip just to tune her out. Many times we suggested an imposed silence. It was infuriating. Finally, after having enough and telling her several times with varying degrees of force, I finally yelled at her to just shut the fuck up. That we needed some silence. Of course, that did not go over well with anyone. Everyone thought I was being rude. She shrank into herself and I could tell I shut her down, but then she would just STILL talk about things like did I want to share a peach with her or could she get me a cup of coffee - not giving me any peace and quiet, but still trying to appease me in any way except the actual fucking thing I REALLY needed, which was some silence. But she still continued to talk without any self awareness whatsoever. 

Now, I am aware that it is not nice to tell 80 year-old ladies to shut the fuck up. I was absolutely raised better than that. My sister thinks I am a complete asshole and although my mother hasn’t said it, I’m sure she does, too. (she just wants everyone to get along.) My sister says that I should be softer and more understanding and find other ways to communicate my need for silence with softness, understanding, and humor, like she did throughout the entire trip. I told her that she did that throughout the entire trip and it still didn’t work - that Jenny just kept talking no matter what she said. Or how she said it. Maybe a brief respite of 15 minutes and then she would be back at it, full force. I said that while I tried to be considerate of Jenny’s needs and her age and that we knew beforehand that she talked a lot, no amount of softness, understanding and humor had worked and that I didn’t care if it hurt her feelings because I was so aggravated by this point that I couldn’t take it anymore. I needed her to just shut the hell up for ten minutes. Throughout the rest of the trip, I walked away, I tried to be kind, I avoided her as much as possible, I tried to talk to her about talking less (she just interrupted me), but it had no effect on her for the most part. In the car on the way home (another ten hours), things boiled over again, and I told her again to shut the fuck up 

As you can imagine, the trip home was tense and it was the biggest sigh of relief when we finally dropped her off at her apartment. I have never been so happy to see the back of someone in my life. Everyone was upset. Jenny had her feelings hurt, my sister was mad at me and thinking I was a jerk, and I’m sure my mother was disappointed in me and just wanted everyone to get along.) of course, I was incredibly frustrated, absolutely out of sorts, and angry.

My sister left this morning and had a three hour drive to the airport. She called me to tell me that she thought I was completely out of line, that I acted like a petulant teenager, and that I really needed to take a look at myself.

While I wasn’t proud of myself for how I handled it and I do accept responsibility for how I reacted, I am confused if I am really the asshole here. My sister said the situation didn’t matter and wasn’t the issue here but the fact that I just acted like a petulant teenager and wasn’t softer and more accommodating. That I didn’t try to communicate in other ways. Softly and more gently. I told her that I had actually tried to communicate in those ways and also watched her communicate in those ways and get nowhere and that absolutely nothing got through to Jenny other than being an absolute jerk about it and yelling at her to shut the fuck up.

I am willing to admit that I was an asshole about it. I told an 80-year-old woman to shut the fuck up twice. But my questions are this: 

a. Does her compulsive need to talk incessantly outweigh my need for silence? 
b. Do I automatically give up my needs for her just because she’s old? 
c. Am I wrong for using the nuclear option when kindness, softness and accommodation repeatedly did not work?
d. Where is the line? I didn’t expect or ask for silence ALL the time, but conversation rather than continuous monologue would have been HEAVENLY. Do my needs just get completely dismissed because Jenny is 80 years old and has always been this way? 
e. Do I apologize for anything? Am I responsible for the entire situation? I am at a loss. Please give me your opinion and insight. I don’t think I deserved it all coming down on me. I do acknowledge and regret my poor behavior, but am I really an asshole for it?

 ""The cabin in the woods had been abandoned for years, but one night, a candle burned in the window. This was the sign that the trap is set. And the bait of immense wealth would lure all prey driven by greed."" The words echo in Tabitha's mind, as she recalls the story her grandmother told her, and her siblings, about Hogs Island. As a child growing up, she knew why this particular island, among the dozen or so others scattered across the lake, was forbidden to set foot upon.

And every night, Tabitha and her two siblings, Tashiba, and Tianna would listen to their grandmother tell stories about the old times before the lake community. And every night the triplets would lock their interest onto the mentioning of one island in particular. Hogs Island, whereupon sits a cabin in a clearing, and surrounded by dense woods. And every night, the trio of curious sisters would look out the window of their bedroom, for it offered the best view of the lake, and the island. They would scan the dark cabin for signs of the candle in the window.

""Miss Dearing, are you still with us?"" The detective's words startled her. She looked up at the female police detective and forced a half smile before nodding and mouthing an apology. ""You were recalling tonight's incident on Hogs Island, in which five local residents, including yourself, were attacked by something on that island."" The detective says, holding a recorder between them, and she casts the witness a knowing stare. Tabitha returns the knowing stare with mutual understanding, and Tabitha knew what she had to do. ""I know you've had a traumatic experience, miss Dearing, so I will afford you all the time you need to regain your composure."" She says.

Tabitha nods in agreement, as she closes her eyes, and begins a breathing exercise her grandmother taught her. 'Breathe in deeply, the past. Breathe out wholly, the truth. For that is the only way we relive the past, is through focused recollection coupled with harmonious breathing."" Her grandmother often says. The thought of her grandmother's teachings drawing forth with each deep inhale of her meditative breathing, was already beginning to work in calming her mind and body. And after a few meditative breaths ,she opened her eyes and calmly addressed the detective.

""It all started in Greenly's market, where I was shopping for groceries. I was standing in the produce aisle, when I was approached by a group of locals I've known since grade school. Bobbi Jergen, her boyfriend Robert Drumman, Skyler Braxton and Cane Parker. Bobbi deliberately poked fun at my grandmother, knowing how defensive I am about her. She was calling her names and berating her for no reason except to lure me into proving her wrong."" Tabitha said, She paused long enough to accept a cup of coffee the detective offered. She took a sip and breathed in the aroma before continuing.

""When Bobbi saw that her tactics weren't working, that's when Robert Drumman intervened with his own strategy. He said that he knew that my grammy had something to do with Mr. Fisher's disappearance. He claimed that he saw both my grammy and Mr. Fisher go to the island together, and later, he saw grammy leave the island alone. And I told him if that were true then he should have gone to the police.' She paused and took another sip of coffee. 'So, he said he was saving the information to use as leverage against our family."" Pause again, sip some more coffee, ""Do you believe what happened tonight, is what also happened to Mr. Fisher?"" The detective interjects, using the pause to her advantage.

Tabitha shrugs her shoulders, ""I believe it's a possibility,' she replies. 'Like grammy always says in her stories, anyone can go to the island and leave when they like. But set foot upon the shore with greed in your heart, and you will never leave."" Tabitha says and drinks some more coffee. ""So back to Robert Drumman and his leverage,"" the detective says. Tabitha breathed deeply before speaking, ""Yes, he said that if I didn't go with them to Hogs Island, and help search for his body, he would go to the police, and spin them a story, that'll have my grandmother thrown in jail for life. So rather than check his left jaw with a right hook, I agreed to go with them.""

""So I hurried home, and I helped grammy make dinner, and after we ate and enjoyed movie night grammy went to bed.' Tabitha recalls personally seeing to it, that her grandmother was put safely in bed. ""So I walked down to the dock, and they're waiting for me aboard Cane Parker's boat. When I got aboard I could tell by the smell of them, that they had been hitting the liquid courage rather heavy all day since after the grocery store. So I'm standing on the deck confronted by Skylar, Bobbi, and Robert. Cane was at the helm, and he's steering us toward Hogs island. And after we got under way, they started going in on me like the Spanish Inquisition.""

The detective listens attentively as Tabitha continues, ""Skylar begins with her father disappearing whilst looking for Mr. Fisher. Then Bobbi follows with how she lost two uncles who went to the island looking for their fishing buddies. And Robert chimes in with 'We just want to go to the island to look for our people.' And I tried to tell them about the dangers of the island, the way my grammy explained it, but they didn't want to hear about that. And that's when Cole Parker, Cane's older brother emerged from below deck. I hadn't seen him around since he joined the Marines a couple years back.

He comes up onto the main deck carrying a duffle bag in one hand and a large jug of Mr. Berry's moonshine in the other. He says, he didn't come along for a search and rescue, he came to get rich. 'Oh I know all about the treasure littering Hogs Island, and tonight is payday for us.' He said. Then he reached into the duffle and pulled out a machine gun and said, 'I brought this to deal with whoever tries to get in my way.' That's when I tell him, that his weapons will not avail him on the island, and that his intent to take what is not his will only result in forfeiture of his immortal soul. But Cole being who he is wouldn't listen and he urged Cane onward.

When we got to the island, Cane stopped the boat some twenty yards off the northern shore. The beach was aglow with shiny metal bathing in the light of the full moon. An ominous darkness lurks beyond the tree line, like a presence waiting patiently for trespassers. And beyond the trees I could see the cabin in the woods, but what's even more frightening, was that I could see the candle burning in the window. A sign that the trap is set, and I was among them. This feeling terrified me into a catatonic state. I was frozen in place with my eyes locked on that candle and the only words I could hear myself speak repeatedly were 'We Need to leave.'

Then I heard a splash, and I could hear the others cheering Cane on, as he dove into the water, and swam to the beach. He stood on the beach and shined his flashlight towards the boat to signal that he made it to the island. And while the others were cheering him on, I was the only one in the group screaming for him to return, so we could leave. Cole switched on a search light and shined it on his brother, who threw up his arms and roared in triumph. 'Call him back, we need to leave!' I pleaded. Cole's response was 'Cane search the beach for treasure we're on our way.' Then Robert helped Cole load a cooler of beers on ice into the launch boat, while Bobbi and Skylar stood to either side of me as Cole instructed.

I continued to repeat my warning, with my eyes transfixed on the candle burning in the window of the dark cabin, and my hands balled into fists, so I wouldn't be tempted to pick up anything. After we are all loaded on the boat we head for shore. And as we approached Cane's location on the beach I wondered if I was the only one in the group, who noticed the candle burning in the window of the cabin. Cane is shining his light along the sand, when he stops on something that caught his eye. 'Hey guys, I think I found something!' He called out. Then he reached down to pick up whatever he found as the launch boat had reached the shore.

Cane stood holding in his left hand the item he claimed he found, and in his right hand his flashlight which he kept waving on the object, to find the best angle that illuminates the object. 'We need to go back. We need to leave!' I kept saying aloud. 'What 'cha got little brother?' Cole asks. The four of them gather around Cane to see what he found. And just as they were mere inches away, I watched as the darkness in the trees ran out of patience, and it reached out from the tree line and grabbed Cane Parker from behind, and flung him up in the air like a rag doll, and he landed towards the tree line leading into the woods.

Cane managed to get to his feet after being thrown for such a distance. The others all stood in silence and awe at what they'd just seen, and all revelry and fun and games came to an abrupt halt when the group finally noticed the shadowy presence hovering among the trees as it reached out and went for Cane again. 'Cane get back here!' Skylar screams. The others join in with 'Run!' and 'Hurry!' and 'C'mon bro, move your ass!' Cane begins to run, churning his legs like a true captain of the swim team. His triumphant roar now a scream of terror as he calls out to his brother for help.

Cole takes aim with the machine gun, and he opens fire into the appendage of darkness that is chasing his brother. The tracer rounds fly into the dark appendage and vanish, as though he'd hit nothing. The Parker brothers grab hands, and as Cole is assuring Cane that everything would be okay, the dark appendage took shape, forming the head of a giant wolf as it captured Cane's body in its jaws. Then a pair of glowing red eyes open and look upon Cole holding his brother by one hand, and the machine gun in the other. More of the dark appendage adds to its mass giving it a full body and making its overall size three times that of a horse.

'Let him go!' Cole roared, and cursed, and fired his weapon one handed into the face of the massive beast. The beast growled, almost laughingly as it snatched Cane backwards, and pulled the brothers apart, causing Cole to fly forwards and land face first in the sand. We all watched in horror, as the wolf turned into a dark mist of sorts, and then it carried Cane Parker's screaming body into the woods, where his screams were drowned out by the growls and snarls in the night. Skylar grabs my wrist and slings me forward, I can hear Bobbi Jergen screaming at me to do something. But what else could I do besides warn them not to go to the island in the first place?""

Tabitha paused again just long enough to finish her coffee. ""So I'm thrown to the ground, and my eyes are shut tight now because I didn't want to look upon anything shiny in the sand. Then I felt heavy hands grab my arms and lift me to my feet, and the voice of Robert Drumman yelling from behind, 'How's about a trade? Her for some of this gold.' I opened my eyes when he said that, and that's when I noticed him holding something golden. And in the time, it took me to tell Robert to drop it and leave, the dark appendage had swooped down from the tree line, push me out of the way and snatched Robert Drumman up into the air, and dropped him to the earth from a height of at least a hundred feet or more.

Bobbi Jergen screamed so loud at the sight of her boyfriend falling from such a height, I could feel my eardrums throbbing. I look up to see Robert falling and screaming in his descent. He'd gone from being the biggest, baddest bully in high school, to a mere two-hundred-pound victim of gravity that crashed to the earth hard. He landed with a loud squishy splat upon a stone slab risen out of the sand. His blood spattered in all directions from the point of impact. Bobbi ran to where he fell, screaming hysterically as she collapsed near his body and she started sobbing. I looked across the lake where I could see my grandmother's house, and I noticed that the entire house was dark, as if there was a power outage, except it was only affecting grammy's house and no one else.

But the light in my bedroom was on, and I know I switched it off before I left. And in the gloom of the light I could just make out the silhouette of a person standing there as if looking out and witnessing all that was transpiring. I took a step in the direction of home, when Skylar Braxton tackled me to the ground, and she started pommeling me with her fists while screaming that it's all my fault. I threw up my hands in an effort to shield my face from the blows, but Skylar was landing some pretty accurate punches. But apparently I wasn't bleeding enough to her satisfaction, so she dug her fingers into the sand to either side of my head, and closed her fists about two gold ingots which she raised in preparation to smash my face in.

'No Skylar! I cried. Yet before I could say put it down, the shadowy appendage came for her. It enveloped her completely, and lifted her up as she was kicking and screaming obscenities. And yet she refused to drop the gold she was holding, even when she saw the dark presence come for her, she wouldn't let go. I sat up and braved a look around. To my left I could see Cole Parker shooting his machine gun into nothing as his way of avenging his brother. Ahead of me was the Cane Parker's boat, anchored off the shore, and waiting for its passengers. And to my right Bobbi Jergen was staggering towards me, with something in her hands.

I couldn't clearly see what it was she carried in her hands, until she was almost upon me, and she raised the object above her head. It was a diamond the size of a football, and she was about to spike the sharpest end into my skull. I throw up my hands in defense again, and I scream at Bobbi to put it down, but she doesn't listen. And the dark appendage descended upon her like a column of black mist. It shrouded her entirely, and she let out an ear-piercing scream, which the dark presence carried away into the woods, and leaving behind a steaming skeleton, wearing Bobbi Jergens’ clothes.

Upon seeing Bobbi Jergen get bone-stripped, Cole Parker ran to me, grabbed me by the arm with his free hand, and he started pulling me towards the launch boat. I'm screaming so hysterically at what happened to Bobbi, that I was somewhat relieved when Cole flung me into the boat, that I crashed sideways before rolling onto my back and sitting upright. Cole was pushing the boat from the front, and as it slid into the water, I moved to the rear and tried to start the engine. I kept yanking the pull cord, but the engine wouldn't start. Suddenly I hear this racket behind me and when I turn to look, I see Cole reaching down into the water, and coming up with two handfuls of treasure, and dumping it into the boat, before reaching down for more.

'What the hell are you doing?' I screamed. He gave me this ignorant look and said, 'I'm not leaving here empty handed.' Then he jumps into the boat and after letting it drift away from the shore a bit, he moves to the back where I was, and he starts the engine with a key. He steered us towards Cane's boat and he turned to me and said, ""It's alright Tabitha. It's over now, we're off the island and we're safe."" He said. I didn't respond. I just sat there, catatonic, and staring at all that treasure Cole had scooped into the boat as he was pushing it into the water.

When we were back aboard Cane Parker's boat, I cast my gaze toward Grammy's house. I could no longer see her silhouette in my bedroom window. The light was switched off again. Cole had just finished tying on the launch boat and on his way to join me on the main deck, he stopped and picked up the jug of Mr. Berry's moonshine, turned it up and drank several long gulps of the hard liquor. He then stops and looks at me and says, 'We need to get our stories about tonight straight, so the cops don't look too hard into our involvement. Do you agree?' I nodded in affirmation. He cracks a ridiculous smile and says, 'Great! And in the meantime, I'll dig up a few contacts, who can research this stuff and tell me what each piece is worth.'

Suddenly I gasped with a start at what I saw. Cole was staring at the gold ingot he was holding and lost in his own thoughts of whatever men do when they obtain wealth, that he became completely ignorant to the fact that his back was to the island, and the dark presence had gathered along the shore, like some black fog. And beyond the tree line, where the cabin in the woods was now clearly visible in the light of the full moon, the candle in the window burned brighter than before. And I called to him, to look towards the island, but when I got his attention, suddenly these long thin black tendrils climbed up the side of the boat.

They stretched up over the side and curled and twined around Cole's neck like a garrote. Cole tried to leap away from the side of the boat, but he couldn't move quick enough. Because the moment he felt the tendrils coil around his neck, his eyes went from looking at me to locating his weapon lying in front of him. And as he moved to reach for it, the tendrils drew taut, and snatched him backwards over the side of the boat. As he splashed into the water, I ran to the side to look for him. When he did breach the surface, he came up thrashing and gasping for air, and he was still holding on to the gold ingot. I called down to him to let it go, as I grabbed a life preserver and threw it to him.

But the instant the life preserver hit the water, the tendrils drew taut again, but this time with a loud snap which pulled him through the water, and back towards the shore of Hogs island. It looked a lot like he was being reeled in like a fish, the way that tendril was pulling him through the water like that. It pulled him back to the island, and carved a ditch in the beach as he was dragged through sand and treasure and finally into the woods. And that's when he started screaming. He screamed in anguish for a long while, and when he stopped, I felt an eerie sense of calm wash over me. Like I could finally breathe a sigh of relief, believing it was finally over. I looked down to where the launch boat was tethered and saw that the tendrils had pulled it free from the boat, and as it neared the island it sank just off the shore. I looked up and I noticed the lit candle in the window of the cabin in the woods blew out, and the dark mist that was looming over the beach had dissipated into vapor. ""

""Wow!"" The detective remarked, and she turned the recording device off. ""That's some story. So, because you personally did not touch any of the treasure on the island, you were spared a violent death?"" The detective asks. ""That's my truth, whether you believe me or not."" Tabitha nods. Then a young woman enters the room where Tabitha was giving her statement, and she's followed by an elderly woman in a motorized wheelchair. Tabitha sighs and regards them both with recognition, ""Tashi, grammy!"" She cries, Tashiba runs to her sister, and throws her arms around Tabitha in a tight embrace. 'Thank God you're alright! I caught the first flight back when grammy called, and told me what happened.""

The detective joined the reunited siblings and their grandmother. ""She's a bit shaken up from the ordeal, and she took some pretty solid licks. But there's nothing time and alcohol can't fix."" The detective claims. The grandmother cracks a smile at the detective. ""So detective granddaughter, are you going to arrest your sister for what happened on Hogs island?"" The grandmother asks. The detective hugs Tabitha, then Tashiba joins in with her embrace. ""No grammy Eva, I'm not going to arrest my sister. I merely took her statement as a formal procedure, and that's what I will file in my report. I can't arrest her for a crime she didn't commit. And if I see the goons who put their paws on My flesh and blood, they better crawl up an eagle's behind and pray it doesn't poop until it lands on the other side of the world."" Tianna exclaims, and the group share a laugh.

Eva Dearing sits back in her motorized wheelchair, and a comforting smile stretches across her face. She looks at her triplet granddaughters, Tabitha, Tashiba, and Tianna, all grown up from the curious little girls she raised on her own. She reaches into her satchel, and removes an old leather tobacco pouch, which she opens and takes out a hand whittled pipe with a long stem. She packs the bowl with the contents of the pouch and puts the bit in the left corner of her smile. ""Tabitha, Tashiba, come along my dears, and let your sister do her work."" She says, as she manipulates and joystick control of her wheelchair, maneuvering it towards the exit.

The siblings exchange goodbyes, and Tabitha and Tashiba join Eva in leaving the building. When the trio are outside Eva steers her way down the wheelchair ramp towards a Rolls Royce Ghost, and a waiting chauffeur. The driver opens the rear door, and a custom ramp lets down. Tashiba climbs inside and sits on the far end of the back seat, while Eva pauses to light her pipe. ""Tabitha, there is something in the opposite seat for you."" She says without looking up at her granddaughter. Tabitha enters the Rolls, and on the opposite facing back seat is a box. Tabitha removes the lid and stares at its contents. Inside the box are four gold ingots like the many that litter the beach on Hogs Island, and a raw uncut geode the size of a football. Tabitha looks at Tashiba, who casts a knowing glance, and nods. She looks to Eva as she enters the car. ""What is this grammy?"" She asks.

Eva smiles as she exhales a plume of cannabis smoke, ""A thank you from them."" She replied while taking another hit from her pipe. Tabitha cocks her head to one side in confusion. ""I don't understand Grammy, them who?"" She asks. Eva blows another plume of smoke and looks at Tabitha with a grin. ""The residents of H.O.G.S. island are the Hunters Of Greedy Souls. And last night, you, my dear granddaughter, delivered five of such souls. And for which you have been rightfully compensated.""

1kuu6ld,https://www.reddit.com/r/Absurdism/comments/1kuu6ld/the_road_to_sysiphus/,The Road to Sysiphus,"I’ve always found it odd how the life and times of Camus’ are little more than a footnote when we consider absurdism. It’s true that Sisyphus is an excellent metaphor for anyone suffering from the human condition. But if you look, it’s easy to see where he drew his inspiration from. 

His life was mired by violence and death. He was born to a poor family in Algeria. His father died when he was one in WW1. His mother was deaf and illiterate. 

His first trip up the hill was to get educated. He excelled in school and ended up getting a BA in Philosophy. During his time at university he married a morphine addict. They were later divorced when he found out she was  having an affair with her doctor. As the rock returns he stands ready to enter adulthood already hardened by life.

On his second trip he started getting politically active. He joined the French communist party. Though he was not truly aligned with Marxist ideology and thought it would be a path to change. He became disillusioned with the FCP, left and joined another communist party, only to again fell out of line with the party. But this time he was expelled for maintaining his principles. By this time Algeria had been taken over by fascists. He turned to the press and began working for an anti-fascist newspaper. And just as the rock is about to meet the fulcrum, the fascists shut down the newspaper. He looks around. He sees the treatment of the native population by the French colonists. It’s his birthplace, but his home has died. And the rock returns from wens it came. 

His third trip, a new beginning. Paris 1940. He found work as an editor. This is the point in time when he was writing many of the works we find so profound. WW2 was kicking off. France would soon be occupied by Germany. 15-20 million people died in Europe from 1939-1945. 580,000 of those deaths were in France. 

I once asked myself why he chose suicide to focus on.  It’s certainly not an easy topic to talk about. But through the lens of history, it’s easy to imagine why. People were starving everywhere. His neighbors were getting dragged from their homes never to be seen again. Bombs dropping constantly. Foreign soldiers raping women and murdering children. It was the worst of humanity, every day for years. 

But, we must imagine Camus happy. “Should I kill myself or have a cup of coffee?” - it’s a joke. A dark joke, but a joke nonetheless. An absurd dilemma that draws us in and takes our guard down. I imagine Camus as that guy at the office that will stand up for his convictions by bringing the passion when he needs to, but also going out of his way to make people smile.

1kuu5cn,https://www.reddit.com/r/daggerheart/comments/1kuu5cn/new_domain_spark_tinkerer_class_and_subclasses/,New Domain: Spark + Tinkerer Class and Subclasses,"Hello all! I hope everyone is doing amazing! One year ago I made a [first draft of the Tinkerer Class](https://www.reddit.com/r/daggerheart/comments/1bofhtl/new_class_and_domain_tinkerer_technomancy/), a class inspired by artificers, alchemists and magical engineers. But now, after playing the game for many months (and seeing that they are releasing the card generator soon-ish) I decided to revisit it. This class is based on **stress management** (like most jobs) and comes with **a brand new Domain: Spark**, **Domain Cards (with a new type: TRAP) and two subclasses** that play into the versatility of the class: one base domain + an extra domain for each subclass. I sincerely hope you enjoy this as much as I enjoyed coming up with everything.

Let's start from the beginning...

[New Domain: Spark](https://preview.redd.it/f0far19gou2f1.png?width=492&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df2540354784615c3c8a15c07598d8f327a2e19)

Spark is the domain of ignition and inspiration. Practitioners channel wild invention through momentary genius, unleashing sudden solutions, magical mechanisms, and brilliant breakthroughs. Spark offers speed, experimentation, and insight struck like lightning.

**NEW CLASS: Tinkerer**

Tinkerers excel in blending magic with technology, showcasing adaptability across various disciplines and scenarios.

**Description**

Tinkerers are all about innovation and adaptability. They blend their inventive minds with magical skills to unlock amazing potential through science. They see magic as a complex puzzle just waiting to be solved, and love using it in their clever inventions and mixtures. While some might see them as just engineers or eccentric scientists, they're really masters at thinking outside the box and finding clever solutions to everyday problems.

Many Tinkerers become well-known in their communities, gaining fame in areas like politics, warfare, or commerce thanks to their groundbreaking creations. They're incredibly savvy, and this expertise shines through in both their tools and their talents. Few can match their ability to create specialized apparatuses perfectly suited to their needs.

\------------------------

That's it! I tried to play on the versatility and roleplay, with powerful effects (traps) that are balanced out by needing preparation; or stress related skills that speaks to an overworked individual. This was thought with a lot of love for the system, and I hope that, in the very least, it helps inspire some of your campaigns in some ways :) 

Cheers!

Here is the first chapter in my planned character driven sci-fi story titled ""Rizzing The Mona Lisa"". It follows Eric the most brilliant being in the known universe and his friend/quantum intelligence Tardis. This  story explores co-dependency, burnout, finding a new path after the spiral and found family. This chapter is part of the golden arc of the story.

— Curtain Call

I listened to the universe after the third time I lost my balance. I now completely agree that bench stools are not meant for exploring advanced yoga poses I found on social media.

Although calling Beta Bench just a lab bench is like calling Everest an anthill, it disrespects its potential, and it lacks vision. I try not to do it, just like I try not to walk into walls.

I have made some of the most important discoveries of my career at this bench. The space time continuum theory that suggested time travel as feasible was proven viable where I am standing. The awakening of Tardis was made possible with some luck and the neural quantum matrix, that sits on the far side of the dark twenty-meter bench top.

Wincing at the memory I picture the scar near my right eye that was caused by a miscalculation.

The failures I pursued at this bench have made me a better scientist, but that is why this bench is here.

Silently I repeat “I am not afraid to fail. It is ok to fail, before saying out loud it’s ok to be less than the world demands.” A quick breathing exercise and I have returned to the present.

Beta Bench is of the ocean’s surface. None of us can fathom its true measure. The world as we know would not exist if not for its momentum.

Feeling nostalgic, a smile touches my lips and widens. I place my hand on its smooth, cool, and indestructible surface. My fingers flex futilely to grip the single molecule the table is constructed from. As its creator I feel rebuffed yet proud of its infallible nature.

Now properly distracted, I look up from my tablet screen to see the physical representation of all this math. Three one-million-liter insulated tanks full of time machine coolant.

I can’t believe Tardis heckled me into helping her decorate them for Christmas two years ago. That was my first truly happy Christmas. We sang the O.G. tunes, and she told silly stories. Now she refuses to take them down, because as she puts it the lab was too sterile without the tanks looking like Christmas had vomited on them.

The coolant is remarkably interesting; it works perfectly within its thermal arc. When its temperature gets too high during transport, it magnifies cosmic radiation as well as making its effects chaotic.

I do have some idea of what this looks like though, when I first used it, there was a moderate release of radiation on the first few journeys. I did get a touch of radiation sickness, but it’s fine now.

Since then, I spent a lot of time calculating variables and if the coolant stays under 2.0 Kelvin, our skeletons won’t glow.

Walking to the kitchen, I dodge a couple of humanoid robots with the guile and intelligence of a windowpane that keep the place nice and tidy. I desperately need to redesign them, but they annoy Tardis, so I take that as a win.

It feels like something a couple of old spinsters would do to each other. Imagining her darning socks in a Victorian dress makes me chortle. Before she can verbally accost me, I ask her, “Hey, um…Tardis, my math is impeccable. Why do you have me checking this formula’s thermal arc again?”

Over the lab speakers a firm, clear, and slightly playful female’s voice says.

“Because, even though you’re the most brilliant being in the universe, you still need me to remind you to carry the one. Besides, you like math, this is math, I am doing you a favor. I deserve a raise.”

My mind dreamed of her as my hands built her. I know what she is truly capable of, I am also aware that she has only begun to scratch the surface. Even knowing all that, I trust her above all else including myself.

Despite knowing I can’t possibly win, nor do I really want to, I shoot my shot with, “You must be going senile from all that dust gathered on the processors you don’t use.

Sounding like she is annoyed at a lower life form, she asks me, “Which drawer is the flat tipped screwdriver you used this morning in?""

To give me a moment to think, I pose the question, “You have near infinite Qubits, what more can I do?”

Somehow, she silently expresses the word duh, while haughtily saying “I want that last thirteen percent.

She knows infinity is an impossible figure. Staring into the distance, I scour my brain for a way to make this happen.

“I need to figure out how to give you infinite Qubits first. Then we’ll figure out your raise. Until then deal with it.”

Pausing in confusion I ask myself, “What does a raise even mean to her?”

Trying to hide her excitement but still asking way too fast, “Ooh, can I put that on the schedule?

Thinking longer than necessary just to make her processors spin with irritation, I ask, “Do you really think that’s necessary? I mean you already get the maximum gold stars in every category each week, what can thirteen percent more possibly improve?

Bracing myself, I wait for a response. A full seven seconds later she shares an image of a bug with my face, being smashed by her foot. With the command: Eric, you will make me a deity, so that I can rule this world. Besides, most of my processor time is spent making sure you do your laundry.”

Perplexed I sputter, “It’s three loads. Why would I need you for that?”

Sweetly she tells me, “Bless your pointed head. Who controls the machine you built to wash your dirty socks, and remind you to fold them?”

“I gave you that task?”

“You give me every task. I deserve a raise.”

Opening the fridge, I hedge my bets on caffeine fixing my problems and grab a can of too sweet coffee. I know I should eat something, but my stomach feels like it’s tied in knots before every journey in time.

It’s confusing to wake up with dread and glee at same thought. Sometimes I want to stop, but I can’t stop myself. It’s not the major events, although those can be interesting, it’s experiencing the lives of people that will never be known that interests me the most. Feeling her cameras watching, I grab a yogurt and sit down to enjoy my coffee.

Before opening the yogurt, I tell her, “Fine put it on the schedule low priority.”

Turning back to my lunch, I can suddenly smell sulfur with my first bite. Annoyed, I look around me for a leak, until I realized what happened, Tardis is pissed.

Internally I ask her, “Will you accept low priority and be added to the high priority wait list?

Luckily, the smell of rotten eggs is quickly replaced by a lovely sandalwood and incense scent.

“Tardis, I appreciate you for more than what you do around the lab.”

Sounding lightly worried she tells me, “Eric, you look tired. How has your sleep been? We can always have an adventure after you nap.”

I think for a minute, because I know she is right, but it has been so long since I slept without dreaming. I can’t tell her that, or she will be even more worried about me.

Luckily, I can tell her “After today, I am unsure when we will be able to due to the meeting with The World Council next week.”

Hearing my friend plead, “I can help you get through this, take me with you.” Destroys my composure.

I need to use cold coffee and yogurt that now tastes like ash as a shield from her loyalty.”

“I know you would, and there is no one else that I trust to, but I need you to understand, I can only do this alone.”

Thankfully, she never presses and gives me the space and time I need to come back. No longer hungry, I drop the yogurt in the trash and walk back towards Beta Bench, on the way I pass by Alpha Bench and shudder. Keeping my eyes forward I pretend like it’s not there, but I can feel it lurking as if hiding in a fog. After passing I congratulate myself, as if I was an addict avoiding his fix.

Returning to my throne in front of Beta Bench, I clap my hands together and psych myself with some dumb action movie quotes before getting back to work.

After about two hours of staring at equations, I imagine the last expression sticking its tongue out at me and I snicker.

I stand up to stretch and ask her. “Um Tardis, what's the coolant temperature?”

“The temperature is 1.6 Kelvin.”

“1.4 Kelvin worked great and, now that I know its decay, I think we will be safe. Mumbling to nobody “We haven't tried that before.” I begin making a to do list.

We need to ensure the coolant is circulating correctly before returning.

Grinning excitedly, I look past the space where the wave will begin. In my best starship captains voice, I confidently say, “Engage the dark matter generator.”

I hear what sounds like multiple dice being tossed and her telling me in a nerdy Dungeons and Dragons players voice, “It seems there is a spanner in the works, roll again.”

I point my head up to stare at the ceiling and clench my fists. I close my eyes. After a ten count they open and I calmly say, “Tardis, that's not in the script.”

Her voice is now sharp, aggressive, and gaining speed. “It's not, but you won't listen so why should I? You build machines to explore space and time and to push the boundaries of what we know. You built me for your safety, the world’s safety, and to be a companion.”

Her voice is so cold that I flinch back.

“What would I be if you refused to let me do my most important purpose? A failed Alpha Bench experiment?”

Shocked and hurt that she would say anything like that. I can’t believe she used that bench against me. She’s never hinted at anything like this. I look at the floor then at my work bench, and think I can’t believe this is happening, it’s safe. I proved it’s safe.

Growling I tell her “Tardis, I want to go on an adventure, this is my lab, and I am in charge. Stick to the script!”

I raise my foot to stomp it but narrowly catch it before it hits the floor.

She modulates her voice to speak like I’m unable to understand simple instructions. “Hold on, I'm looking for the part where I must reason with a skinny pants wearing idiot that uses his hands to blow his nose. Is he hungy? Does he need a fluff sandwich? Does him need a nap? Is it on page twenty-four, or twenty-seven? Fix it, or we won’t be leaving.

Raising her voice, she nearly shouts, “God help you if you raise that foot again!”

She asked me to think about the worst things that have happened to me in the past. Getting dumped by my college girlfriend, failing that important exam, my dad's health scare, getting rejected from my dream job... At the time, each felt like the end of the world.

But here's the thing - every single one of those ""disasters"" led to something better. The breakup? Met my current partner at a coffee shop while stress-eating my feelings. The failed exam? Switched majors and found my actual passion. Dad's scare? We became way closer. Dream job rejection? Ended up at a company where I actually thrived.

So now when I catch myself catastrophizing about getting fired, I try to flip the script. Instead of ""What if I lose my job and can't pay rent?"" I ask ""What good could come from this?"" 

Maybe I'd finally have time to learn that skill I've been putting off. Maybe I'd end up somewhere with better work-life balance. Maybe I'd be forced to take that entrepreneurial leap I've been too scared to make.

I'm not saying we should welcome bad things or that toxic positivity helps anyone. Some stuff genuinely sucks and we need time to process it. But for anxiety about future events? This reframe has been weirdly powerful.

Our brains are designed to focus on threats, but we're terrible at predicting how we'll actually handle them. We're more resilient than we think, and life has a strange way of redirecting us toward better paths.

Have an unused coffee machine. Someone asked me where we can meet. I said near my home, but I would be out and about for the day. Seems I was going to be halfway between my home and his, so I gave him an ETA. I also noticed my asking price was not clarified, as I didn't want him to try to bargain me down in person. I pretty much tried to get him to step up to the plate and either affirm my asking price or give him an opportunity to bargain. 

  
He did neither, so after a bit of time chowing down in a restaurant, I blocked him.

1kuu0bl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kuu0bl/i_think_i_have_a_crush_on_a_psychopath/,I think I have a crush on a psychopath,"Okay, so I really need advice. Boy problems, of course. I just need to know what to do to get this guy to leave me alone, and honestly just an excuse to spill some tea because honestly, I want some chaos. Let's get started. By the way, this is a slightly edited copy and paste of my journal entry, so sorry if it's written a little weirdly.

Some things to note are: All the people I will mention are in a different class to me, we're Australian (which might help with some confusion that comes up but I don't know), and I've only known this guy since starting this year.  
 

I think I have a crush on a psychopath.

And no, I’m not just being dramatic. Even my mum agrees that there is something very wrong with this boy. Last night, I was over at my friend’s house after school having a firepit. We'll call her Cherry. Cherry offhandedly mentioned something about thinking that me and this kid in her class would be good together. We'll call him State, short for State Of The World, because thinking about both of these things makes me want to kill myself. :)

When these words left Cherry's mouth, I realized something. The random hyper interest I had for this guy? Probably not just curiosity. Pretty certain I actually have a crush on him. Now, that wouldn’t necessarily be a bad thing – if State wasn’t a literal sadist in desperate need of some sort of therapy. Maybe shock therapy. And I’m not simply exaggerating, trust me. In fact, I think I might be underexaggerating.

We’ll start with one of the first days of school starting in a new year. They were doing the regular thing that happens on your first time in a class, where everyone has to say something they like doing in their free time when their name is called during attendance. (Off topic but come on, can we leave this in kindergarten?)

Most kids probably said something like drawing, or swimming, or maybe even crochet. Little hobbies that the average teenager takes up. Not State, no. When it was his turn, he said ‘hunting’.

Now. Now, now. This wouldn’t necessarily be a bad thing to have as a hobby. This statement could’ve been relatively innocent. I know plenty of people who go up to the mountains to hunt kangaroos and wild pigs on occasion and it's perfectly fine. But according to Cherry and my other friend Salt, the way he said it made the hairs on the back of their neck stand up. They claimed he said it with a certain slyness, like he was telling a secret he shouldn’t be telling.

Still, that isn’t a big deal. Maybe a little uncomfortable, but still, it's fine. The next incident was the real showstopper, so buckle up. Seriously, prepare yourself. Okay, so there’s another boy in their class, we'll call him Pine, and he is unfortunately the prime target for bullying: kind, social but also pretty passive. Pretty much just lets people walk all over him.

While State never really targeted Pine like the other boys, since he doesn’t seem like that type of person, what he did just a few weeks ago was much, much worse than teasing jabs, sneaky remarks behind his back or tripping him in sport.

State shoved Pine down a flight of stairs. Broke his leg, very nearly broke his neck. It could’ve been fatal, and even scarier? The possibility of death on State's end of what happened had no ifs. There’s no “it could’ve been fatal if State did this, it could’ve been fatal if State did that”. Simply it could’ve just been fatal. What could’ve happened ranged from a few minor fractures to Pine’s literal death, and State didn’t care.

He didn’t even have the grace to look ashamed or guilty after finding out how injured Pine had been. To make matters worse, all he said was, “Oh shit, are you alright?” while laughing. LAUGHING.

So obviously everyone was like, what the fuck? Like, he literally just pushed this poor kid down a staircase. Some of his classmates confronted him angrily, lecturing him about the possibility of Pine’s neck almost being snapped in half, while the others went to help Pine. Some kid also went to find a teacher, since at the time they were waiting for their French teacher to come since he's the type of teacher to always be late to starting the class. 

State responded to the berating with, “Aw, come on, if a small fall is enough to kill him, then honestly it's for the better."" ... Excuse me while I go and punch a hole through the wall.

I don’t know about you, but if I saw someone literally break another person’s neck by pushing them down a flight of stairs, I would not be laughing. Actually, I would call the police, because what the fuck? That's literally assault, almost homicide.

My brother got a single day suspension for passing his friend a funny note in class. State got a two-day suspension for almost *murdering* another student. I'm not even joking, someone get me the fuck out of this school I can't do this anymore.

Moving on, another incident happened in Tech class. It was near the end of the lesson, so the teacher had given everyone permission to have free time to do what they liked while they waited for the bell to go for the end of the day.

A girl we'll name Ribbon and Cherry from before were sitting under the desk, watching a movie on Ribbon's phone. All was fine until State approached them. He didn’t say anything, just slammed his hand on the desk to get their attention and leaned down to stare at them.

After an awkward 5 seconds, Cherry asked him what he wanted, and in response, State just smiled and walked off, leaving Ribbon and Cherry feeling a little unsettled. Which was likely his goal – just to get them on edge.

Since he’s in a different class, the only time I really have opportunities to interact with him is during sport when our classes are together. (And of course during lunch and recess, but since we sort of have a clique problem at this school I don't really see him around much then.) When given the chance during PE, he does his best to annoy me. When playing games on opposite teams, he tries to convince me to let him win, and even though I reject his efforts every time, he seems hellbent on getting me to give in to his apparently professional negotiation skills. (Sadist with a superiority complex. Fun.)

When I ranted to my mum about him, she told me to just ignore him whenever he's bothering me. I tried that, but turns out, he doesn't take the absence of attention very well. It only made things worse. In response to my attempts in pretending he was non-existent, he just followed me around, talking to me.

When I still acted like he was nothing more than a slight breeze in my hair, he rather aggressively grabbed my shoulder and yanked me back. He asked, “Why are you ignoring me?”

Honestly, I was kind of nervous and taken aback by the sudden action. He didn’t look visibly annoyed, wasn’t acting violently or angrily (yet), but the playfulness had died from his tone and his expression was blank and hard.

I told him to leave me alone. At my acknowledgement of his existence, he smiled, the cold expression melting away immediately and said, almost innocently, that he was just joking and I should stop being so jumpy. I walked away quite unsettled but unscathed, and thankfully, he didn’t try and follow.

Cherry's mum, who is sort of like a second mum to me, is honestly really good at telling if someone is a jerk or not just by looking at them. A woman's intuition, I guess. When we got our yearbooks back, she flipped through the pages, and when she got to State, I swear the blood drained from her face.

She warned me and Cherry to stay away from him because she felt a really unsettling energy coming off from him, and she seemed genuinely put off, even from just a photo. She seemed so surprised that after seeing him, she just put the yearbook away and stared down into her cup of coffee, not saying anything.

So I pretty much just need advice on how to get State to, well, stay the hell away from me. I have a crush on him, but there's no way I'm making a move. I don't want to believe he's a bad person, but my mum thinks he's mentally unwell, my dad disapproves, my brother says there's something weird about him, my friends hate him, and my friend's mum seemed genuinely concerned for our wellbeing after just seeing a photo of him, let alone hearing all the stuff he's done.

I need help. How do I get him to stay away from me? How do I get myself to lose feelings? Should I try and help him? I don't want to be all, ""I can fix him"", but I genuinely just feel an obligation to make sure he's okay. There has to be some sort of explanation for his behavior besides ""boys will be boys"". Maybe he has some kind of mental illness people are brushing off as 'hormones', or maybe his home life is hard? Any advice will be really helpful. Thank you.

You can usually find me at home baking, lazy with my cats, planting something random, playing games, 3D printing random things or programming a useless software 

I'm in the kerrisdale area, live alone and would love to meet some chill people, have a game night/baking night or some board games!

I'm always down to try new things, or if you wanna just explore the area, go for a bubble tea/coffee run and just vibe always down for whatever

I’m 22 and currently the only one in my house (shared with 3 other women) who owns and knows how to use firearms. I already have a SIG P365 that I carry daily and keep by my bed at night.

We get a lot of unwanted male attention being young and, frankly, all very attractive. Over the past year:
	- I’ve had men try to follow me home (from the grocery store and coffee shop, I don’t even go to bars)
	- One of my roommates still has an active stalker 
	- We’ve all had men harass or touch us in public without consent
      - My creepy drunk neighbor is always asking us to sleep with him and he followed one of us on our run today around the neighborhood. He’s ALWAYS harassing us (yes we have reported to police many times)

Today, I had another unsettling incident…two men came up behind me on an escalator and touched me in public, completely unprovoked. It really shook me.

I’m now wondering:
Should I buy a second gun specifically for home defense since we have had many incidents both at the house and out in public? Would it be smarter to get something larger and more powerful for that role, or is my P365 sufficient? I know you technically only use one firearm at a time, but I want to be prepared.

Any suggestions or advice on what kind of second firearm (if needed) would be best for this situation would be really appreciated. I just really am scared sometimes and would like advice :/ Thank you! ",26,1748146608.0,Firearms,103,0.75,False
