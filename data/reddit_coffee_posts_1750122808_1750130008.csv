My awesome coffee grinder died. Loved it so ordered another. To save a few bucks chose the used but like new. It arrived and looked pretty good but a critical component was broken making it unusable. The simple answer is send it back since it's unusable and  Amazon will toss it.

I can replace the broken part which is the bean hopper that feeds the coffee into the grinder, from my old unit, so is there any way to negotiate with Amazon to get a price reduction and salvage this grinder that they will be tossing in the garbage?

If they need a complete unit I can send back my old one which is in mint condition duction with the broken hopper but guessing there is no one that can authorize that.

I think I know the answer but it drives me crazy that a new appliance will get trashed and I can't figure a way around this that is ethical.

1ldcloh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIContentAutomators/comments/1ldcloh/top_ai_tools_every_new_content_creator_should_try/,Top AI Tools Every New Content Creator Should Try,"Hey AiContentAutomators fam! 🎉

So, let’s talk about something that’s been buzzing around lately: **AI tools for content creation**. We all want to work smarter, not harder, right? 😅 I mean, who has the time to spend hours fiddling with content when there are super cool tools that can do half the heavy lifting for us? Recently, I dove into a few AI tools and wow, it transformed my creative game. So, if you’re just starting out on this content creation journey, here are some gems you definitely want to check out!

**1. ChatGPT (yep, I went there!)**  
If you haven’t tried ChatGPT yet, are you even living? It’s like having a brainstorm buddy who’s always awake. Need ideas for a blog post? Check! Want help with SEO-friendly titles? Double check! Oh, and the banter is pretty solid too.

**2. Canva with Magic Write**  
Canva has been around for a while, but the addition of Magic Write is truly a game-changer! It can create captions, brainstorm designs, and even help you write newsletters. I once turned a blank screen and a vague idea into a killer graphic in about twenty minutes — no lie!

**3. Grammarly**  
Let’s be real: we all need a second set of eyes when it comes to editing. Grammarly is like that friend who isn’t afraid to tell you when you’ve made a typo (even if it hurts). Plus, it helps you enhance your writing style. I saved myself from some major ‘facepalm’ moments with it.

**4. Jasper AI**  
Looking to pump out content faster? Jasper basically acts like your digital writing assistant. Need a catchy intro? Bam! Just like that. It saves you time and helps you explore different tones—since we all know not every post is meant to sound like a corporate blog, right?

**5. Descript**  
If you are into podcasting or video content, Descript is a lifesaver. This tool transcribes your audio and video, allowing you to edit it just like a doc file. Did I mention the overdub feature? Pretty insane, huh? I once edited a 30-minute podcast into bite-sized segments and felt like a wizard.

**6. Lumen5**  
This is for all the visual storytellers out there. You can turn your blog posts into videos with minimal effort. Imagine automagically creating engaging content without having to go through a lengthy video editing process. Less time behind the screen= happier you!

So, here’s the thing. These tools aren’t just about automation; they can actually amplify your creativity and help you focus on what really matters: your *unique voice* and vision. 🌟

Now, I know some of you might be skeptics and say, “But isn’t AI just going to take over?” Well, here’s the kicker: it’s here to *assist*, not replace. Think of it as your trusty sidekick. Batman had Robin, and now you can have AI. Can you feel the power? 

Whether you're a blogging newbie or a seasoned YouTube star, these tools can seriously elevate your game. So, what’s your take? Are you team AI or team “I’ll stick to my 3rd cup of coffee”? 🤔 Let's chat about it!",1,1750129676.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

**STORYTIME:** Like many recent grads, I left college unsure of what I wanted to do and entered a pretty unforgiving job market. I graduated during the pandemic. I ended up tearing my ACL, without health insurance. I finally did get covered and was able to have surgery. It was one of the hardest things I’ve gone through. I never got the opportunity for career exploration. 

Eventually, I landed a job in finance, but I hated it. It wasn’t aligned with who I was or what I wanted long-term. I knew I wanted to pivot into tech, specifically in the clean energy space, but I had no idea how to break in. As a first-gen, low-income college student, I didn’t grow up with people who could teach me how to network, negotiate, or even approach a corporate job. My school’s career center didn’t help much either. So I had to figure it out myself.

I’m a very structured thinker, so I started documenting everything I learned about job searching, networking, resume writing, interviews, coffee chats, salary, benefits, and more. Over time, I built a guide to help others avoid the same confusion I faced. This was originally made for my friends and family, but they’ve used it to land jobs in under a month, and that’s when I realized it might be worth sharing more widely.

There are overpriced career courses out there, and I don’t think anyone should have to pay hundreds of dollars to learn how to apply for a job (given that they have a degree). So I’m putting this out there for *free.* It’s not perfect, it has some AI help, a few typos, and it’s a bit scrappy in places. It’s practical. It’s built from lived experience. I'm not a career expert, just wanted to share a resource. I can't bring myself to make a linkedin post so it's on reddit. 

I made it because I was drowning, and I don’t want anyone else to feel that alone in their job search. It shouldn’t be this hard to get a job. It was tough on my partner to watch me go through this process. So if you’re in it now, I hope this helps you move forward, because you deserve a fair shot.

 I’m happy to share the link. 💛 I have more guides on other industries 

Happy to share, I landed multiple job offers and am employed!",1,1750129440.0,jobhunting,0,1.0,False

I'll just post it anyway! !Many spoiler from up to 150 or so chapter to 217! And perhaps a few dumb ideas in others' eyes! Also I put it as fan art cause I didn't know what to put it as.,"Not fact checked much cause the wiki has so little info and I kept having to go through chapters to remember info, and I'm sure I'm still wrong in some areas, also, I didn't name the titles, just didn't wanna delete it.

Context for future use: The Discovery
• Anthony told Kate the truth behind the new ""Christopher.""
• The current ""Christopher"" is a fake, a shadow molded by Anthony to resemble the original, who died by suicide.
• Anthony admitted to Kate that all the choices she made—every obstacle—were deliberately planted by him, believing it proves he controls everything.
Act II: The Belle Crisis
• For context: One of the Belle twin dolls (faces) dies due to illness and starvation, stemming from a punishment Barbie gave months ago (cleaning the soot room with clingers).
• The surviving Belle is depressed and withdrawn. Unknown to most, Emilyko comforted her in secret, sending letters and giving her a handmade doll resembling her dead twin.
• Belle went missing and possibly being held hostage. This is suspicious and threatens the fragile trust among the children.
• Belle left behind a letter—meant for Emilyko— only she could find due to trusting Emilyko to care enough to investigate her room, see the doll, and reminisce on where she is, touching  the handmade doll she put the letter in and feeling it.
○ The letter contains:
○ A heartfelt message to Emilyko.
○ Evidence and accusations against Anthony.
○ A failsafe warning that if Belle disappears, it's Anthony’s doing.
Act III: Emilyko Acts Alone
• After a strategy meeting ends, (or so she thinks), that was disussing Belle's disappearance, how to find her, and also telling Mirabelle and Isabelle about many truths about the manor, Emilyko leaves without telling Kate and brings Belle’s letter to Barbie.
• Barbie is surprised and reflective upon receiving this, remembering the past punishment that led to one of the Belle twins’ deaths.
• Emilyko had never revealed that she was the one who supported Belle privately during her grief, giving her a stuffed doll resembling her twin and comfort letters, but Barbie very much finds out and understands from the letter alone.
• She had instinctively trusts Barbie, who’s been mentally strained from taking care of Barbara since ""Christopher"" returned.
• Barbie lets Emilyko into Barbara’s room, a rare show of trust. Emilyko confronts her:
• Asks, “Would you trust your friends or someone you haven’t seen in years?”
• Promises to tell her everything if she chooses her friends.
• Holds both Barbara and Barbie’s hands as she tells them:
• Christopher is dead.
• The current Christopher is Anthony’s puppet.
• Anthony is manipulating them all.
• Everything—from past suicides to manipulative systems—was orchestrated by him.
• All the pain—Maryrose & Rosemary’s deaths, divisions between children—was inadvertently caused by Anthony.
• She believes Anthony's control is not absolute. He made problems, but they built the real connections. (Cheesy, ik)
Act IV: The Turning Point
• Emilyko insists that Anthony only thinks he controls everything. She and Kate have earned trust, created unity, and built hope despite him.
• Barbara and Barbie are shaken but listen.
• Emilyko brings them to the star bearer meeting room, unaware the meeting hadn’t ended—just paused.
• Everyone is surprised by her sudden return with Barbara and Barbie.
Act V: Reunion & Realizations
• The meeting included the star bearers, the former star bearers, the main crew, and the shadow Belle twins.
• Since Emilyko, and by extension Barbara and Barbie, they reannouce that Susie is Shaun’s older sister, This was confirmed via memory recovery and family detail connections, triggering a soft emotional moment. And Emilyko excitedly says she suspected it all along:
“You guys feel alike! You’re both kind in that serious, thoughtful way—and you look SO alike!”
• Emilyko, in her usual chaotic warmth, says if Susie and Shaun are siblings, then John and Susanna must be too (Shadow logic! Not how it works—but the logic follows the Belle twins being shadow-siblings).
• Susie is flustered and touched by Emilyko’s earnestness.
Act VI: Fate
• After the meeting ends, Emilyko helps Kate prepare for bed and tells her what she told Barbara:
• That Anthony is wrong.
• That Kate didn't just react—she built something real.
• That their journey was full of fateful moments too specific to be chance.
• Emilyko recaps how everything began:
• She met Kate after arriving on soot Island while exploring, and couldn't get her out of her mind, making a doll of her, but the ring master sees it and tells her she met a ""face eating fairy""
• After she failed after having so much on her mind including the ""girl with no face that might eat her face"" she met she got kicked out.
• How being kicked out of the circus led her to cry on the street and beng found by her now best friends.
• How Shaun, Lou, Ricky, and Rum found her and offered help.
• How she met Kate again, and cleared things up, and found Kate a black cloak and received clothes in return (with Kate’s name stitched in), at first she refused cause of how high quality the clothes were, but Kate saw the doll Emilyko made of her, took and said the doll plus the cloak sounds like a fair trade to her.
• Kate's clothing gave her her own clothing and name for the Selection when Shaun and the others told her she could go with them to the selection.
• Due to the selecteds' names being given to the shadow once the mimicking is complete, Kate’s name circled back to Kate, and gave Emilyko her first real name in return, ""Emilyko"".
• How every single event was built on choice and kindness, not manipulation.
• Their connection began long before their entrance to the manor and shaped everything that followed.
• She declares with full certainty:
“It's like we’re fated to take Great Grandfather down! Even if we have to go through Anthony first.”
Current Status
• The Belle recovery mission is now organized with almost all major characters on Kate and Emilyko’s side.
• Barbara and Barbie are likely aligned, if still processing.
• Emilyko and Kate remain the central duo in a growing network of allies, continuing to act with strategy and heart.
• Kate and Emilyko are working on spreading the antidote to the brainwashing coffee in secret with the help of others like Oliver, Douglas, and Evelyn.
• The rebellion is no longer isolated. The children are waking up—and the ""war"" is turning.


Next arc Timeline Context
• Kate and Emilyko now reside in the Star Bearers’ leader room, and Barbara and Barbie moved into Kate and Emilyko's old room in the children's wing (to Emilyko’s recommendation) so they can have a clear view of the bridge connecting the two buildings.
• Maryrose and Rosemary, long thought dead, have secretly survived and are hiding near yet far from the manor for the last half year, but now recently with Edward, Gerald, and Eileen (who were demoted and moved to where they were staying, in a abandoned remote village near the coal mines).
Current Story Arc
1. The Letter from Maryrose
• A letter from Maryrose, addressed to Emilyko, is delivered to the children's wing.
• Barbara is the one who receives it, not knowing Maryrose survived. This shocks her deeply, as she had witnessed their “death” firsthand and was never given closure.
• She spirals into stress and paranoia, thinking it might be a trap, especially since it's addressed to Emilyko—someone she now trusts deeply.
• Meanwhile, Barbie is in the bathroom brushing her teeth and doesn’t immediately know what’s going on.
• Soot builds up in the room due to Barbara's emotional distress, making Barbie quickly aware something is wrong when she comes out.
2. Barbie Reads the Letter
• Barbie reads it after cleaning up and recognizing Rosemary’s handwriting.
• Despite her past resentment toward Rosemary, memories of their past relationship and possible reasons for their sudden distance (like Christopher’s death) flood back.
• She begins reflecting on the betrayal and hurt, realizing Maryrose and Rosemary might’ve kept the truth from them out of guilt or fear, but it doesn't change the fact they kept it from them.
3. Emilyko’s Reaction & the Letter Back
• Emilyko is overjoyed to learn her friends are alive and cries while clinging to Barbie.
• She writes a long reply recounting everything that happened:
• Gaining the children’s trust.
• Finding out Rum and Shirley weren't ""disposed of"".
• Helping many others, gaining them an amazing reputation.
• Becoming Star Bearer leader through Barbara stepping down and letting everyone vote on whoever should become the next after having a heartfelt talk with Kate and Emilyko and finding out most don't trust her so it's for the better, and cause Barbara knew who the chlidren would vote for as the new leader.
• Rescuing Louise and Lou after they got invited and almost unified.
• Kate’s leadership and rising support from others.
• Barbara and Barbie's redemption arc and growing trust.
• Sarah and Mia’s falling out with them.
• Antidotes being distributed to living dolls to restore memories.
• Sarah’s current position in the adults' wing under Edward.
• Ominous concerns for Sarah’s well-being.
• Candy (a new debutant) is mentioned as a topic too big for this letter.
• She ends the letter warmly, saying everyone misses them—even if Barbie won’t admit it.
4. Maryrose & Rosemary’s Reaction
• They initially panic when they see so much writing, thinking something terrible happened.
• Their emotions swing between relief, pride, and deep worry.
• Maryrose nearly yells “That’s my girl!” multiple times, only to be hushed by Rosemary to avoid alerting the Edward and his friends.
• They learn from the letter that Kate may know why Sarah and Mia changed—Emilyko suspects something but doesn’t know the full truth.
5. “Midnight Visit” Mishap
• Wanting to see them again, Maryrose grabs Rosemary and uses the Phantom to sneak into the manor at night.
• They first check Emilyko and Kate’s old room—now occupied by Barbara and Barbie—and realize too late that they've moved.
• They sneak into the Star Bearers' building and peek into what they hope is Kate’s room…
6. Caught by Barbie
• Barbie hears them outside and suddenly throws open the curtain, covered in soot and glaring.
• Inside, the shadow -belle twins are sleeping in Kate’s bed with Emilyko sprawled over them (Kate is in the bathroom).
• They’ve been hiding to avoid being seen without their living doll, and had been staying there for a while.
• Barbie lets them in but won’t let Maryrose and Rosemary get near much after letting them inside, standing guard to protect Emilyko and Barbara.
• Rosemary almost speaks out bitterly, thinking Barbie hasn’t changed, but keeps it in—just like she used to when enduring Barbie's harshness before their escape.
• Tension is thick. Barbie doesn’t trust them yet, regardless of Emilyko’s heartfelt letter.
Key Themes & Emotional Threads
• Barbie and Barbara’s trauma from betrayal, abandonment, and guilt.
• Emilyko’s hopefulness and how her genuine warmth doesn’t erase past damage.
• Maryrose and Rosemary’s guilt, desperate to reconnect but unsure how.
• Strained relationships don’t magically heal with time or one letter.
• Sarah and Mia’s defection, and Sarah’s unknown fate in the adults' wing, raise alarm.",1,1750129363.0,ShadowsHouse,0,1.0,False

The Democrats have an instinctive reaction to resist anything President Trump does. Their opposition is often poorly considered and only serves to reduce their credibility in the eyes of US citizens and the world.  
  
Even with a very rudimentary understanding of costing you would know that you have to differentiate between fixed and variable costs. Fixed costs cannot be changed, and only variable need consideration.  I would estimate that the actual cost was only 5% of the costs put forward by the Democrats. Nearly all the people participating or setting up the parade where government employees. Whether they were drinking coffee at a base or participating in the parade, the cost to the US taxpayer would be the same.  
  
One of the **most critical success factors for an army is logistics**. The ability to move troops and equipment to and from the battlefield. The parade provided an excellent real world training exercise while **simultaneously building national pride**. That is the **ultimate win - win** in my books.  
  
If I was to offer **a criticism**, it would be this. The organisers tried to be **too frugal with expenditure**. There should have been at least one 5 min segment where the US military demonstrated the **absolute and devastating ""Shock and Awe"" that the US military can unleash** should anyone be **foolish enough to poke the ""LION"".**  
  
The Democrats make it hard to be proud to be American, but I think Trump managed to demonstrate **how much US citizens have to be proud of.**  
  
If you watched the parade from beginning to end, it was obviously not about President Trump's birthday which was purely coincidental.

She thanked me a lot but that was it. I mean,I would probably offer buy next sandwich, a cup of coffee, a glass of wine, a pack of chocolate digestives, or whatever to repay, if that was me, but she never offered.

I was able to report him for other inappropriate behavior to a manager since he made some gross remarks about my self harm scars that weren't sexual, but never told the fullest extent of what happened till today. He also used to have a habit of telling female employees to ""smile"" before he was told off for that. He openly verbally harassed me by commenting on my appearance in a highly suggestive way when I mentioned I had horrible self esteem on a night where I was really down, and I stood there feeling undressed and violated by his words. I just felt nothing but disgust. Need I mention that he's also married and nearly twice my age. I had to shoot him down twice when he tried to ask me to coffee outside of work, the first time I kindly refused and the second I aggressively refused. It now feels like the false ""concern"" he showed over my mental health/refusal to smile I guess was just a way to objectify and pervert upon me, not geninune. He's also an annoying prick who forcefully drags a service dog along with him at all times despite not really needing the dog (who's nice, but depressed) and upsells every customer on VCP which holds up our lines to hell. He refuses to catch animals, won't help customers w setups, won't merchandise, or do much in the way of duties that don't include front reg and training. Lazy. All around he is a wretched worker. I'm sure there's a ""mental"" reason he has the dog but he seems ""physically"" capable, bosses infantalize and baby him making him do no work, which only furthers the gripes I have with him beyond his perversion. 

Management kept me distanced from him for reporting he weirds me out... not the harassment when I still omitted it, but he makes me very uncomfortable and I'm hesitant to report him to HR considering how long it's been since this started. He hasn't persisted but he now shows clear pettiness and resentment towards me- he mocked my lack of VCP yesterday to my face- and still says creepy shit to my colleague. I don't have any blatant proof because it's not like I'm just recording everything. he gets a lot of VCPs and extra hours for the store after we were barren in dog training for ages. So the manager tends to favor him in a very unfair way. Besides me and another coworker, he allegedly had an encounter with a young female customer where he made at minimum an inappropriate joke. The girl, who had to be young, told her mom, and the mom called the store enraged. But nothing was done. My manager seemed to dismiss it. I don't know how he keeps falling upward, but in my best efforts to avoid my discomfort w him I almost always ask someone else to speak to him. My female manager kinda cornered me today and I had to admit to a lot of what I've been hiding. 

I've been stalked/harassed/abused by men before and had an older male stalker that this makes me incredibly disconcerted and while I tried my best to deal with it, I fear that in the end, like he did before my manager won't GAF. The second female manager I had just transferred stores and I'm really at a loss. I want to quit so badly because every shift I cross paths with dog trainer is miserable and just being in his presence makes my day worse. If I could afford or handle the mental pain of unemployment I would... I don't know how to deal with this. As a woman and survivor of abuse and someone who's dealt w harassment and stalking several times in the past- I'm used to not being believed and I don't think HR will take my side. What should I do now that more people know and I feel like I'm gonna be forced into that?",2,1750128791.0,petco,0,1.0,False

I’m hoping to build a community of friends when I’m down there, given I won’t know a soul. Can you recommend some things to do/visit/see or eat?

A little about me: 
• half Guatemalan / half Mexican 
• competitive runner here in Chicago on a sub elite team.
• I’ve been racing bikes since I was 16 (track, road, gravel and cyclocross)
• I love seafood and bagels. 

I’m excited to move and be surrounded by nature. Thank you in advance for the recommendations! DM if you’d like to hang for coffee.",5,1750128727.0,bentonville,0,1.0,False

1ldc8n4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ldc8n4,"[self] Big Red (my biggest sculpture I’ve done, for my first exhibition!)","My explanation from the gallery guide:

“Most people familiar with the tale of Little Red Riding Hood might remember it ending with a woodsman coming to the rescue of Little Red and her grandmother. He uses his axe to cut open the wolf’s belly, and then the story just...ends. This is from a later edition of Grimms’ Fairy Tales (the Grimms released 7 editions). The first edition has two major differences: first, the woodsman uses a set of the grandmother’s scissors to cut them free, and second, the story doesn’t end there. Some time later a new wolf shows up, and Little Red and Grandma outsmart and defeat the wolf on their own.

The scissors were a symbol of what would be considered ‘women’s work’, and were replaced with something more ‘appropriate’ for men. I prefer the imagery of the woodsman using the scissors. There is a delicacy and a precision that is lost without them. My use of hand sewing, beading, and embroidery is in recognition of the erasure of crafts traditionally considered feminine.

In those later versions of the story, we also lose out on seeing Little Red learn from her experiences. I imagined her growing into a person for whom a wolf is no longer a problem.

Big Red is a love letter to getting older and wiser.”

But the 40 pack of coffee capsules on the right are now discontinued and were selling at $22. After a new layout recently I noticed this new product of the 30 pack selling for $20. So for a difference of $2 between both products you get 10 less capsules. Really only a difference of like 30 cents a capsule, if my maths is correct, but still, not surprising or new info I guess really. How things are gonna be now. And ofc could just be due to brand decisions, like maybe the 30 pack will sell better?? 

TL:DR

tomorrow, i wanna try this cute local coffee shop that sells homemade cookies !! i've asked them if they had the ingredient list or something for some of the cookies and they sadly don't, so i'm turning to reddit lol. 

their flavours range from ube to biscoff yo matcha white chocolate.. obviously i won't be able to get precise window, but i'm wondering if these are in the 300-500 range or the 700-900 range. they're pretty big, but definitely don't compare to crumble sizes (maybe 2/3rds of their size ?) and they seem somewhat lighter ",2,1750127959.0,caloriecount,2,1.0,False

I don’t have any bad feelings toward my birth mom, but this whole situation has me feeling so lost.

I was adopted at birth. My birth mom was 18 when she had me, and I never knew much about her growing up. My adoptive parents were open about the adoption, and I always wondered about my birth parents—who they were, what they were like, why they gave me up. I think part of it was because I never fully felt like I “fit” with my family, even though they’ve always loved me and I call them mom and dad. I’m 20 now, in my second year of college in NYC, going to a state school. It’s not a fancy place, and I’m paying for it with student loans and a part-time job+ my parents are helping me. It’s stressful, but I’ve been making it work.

Then, a few months ago, my birth mom found me. A few months ago my birth mom reached out to me. Shes a successful business woman (also came from money). She’s married to some finance guy, has an 8-year-old daughter. Got pregnant with me when she was 18, still in high school. Also when i say rich I mean penthouse in manhattan rich + cartier rich. So (youll understand why this matters) money is NOT an issue or sacrifice for her.

When we met for the first time, I was so nervous I could barely think straight. We got coffee at this fancy place near her apartment, and she started crying the second she saw me. I didn’t know what to do. While shes pretty and rich and all I genuinely have no feeligd towards her. But It was a lot. Since then, we’ve been texting and meeting up every couple of weeks. She’s been really open about wanting to have a relationship, and she’s even offered to pay for stuff—my tuition, my rent, even random things like new clothes. She says she wants to “help” because she knows college is expensive.
Here’s where I’m struggling: I don’t feel comfortable taking her money. I’m scraping by, yeah, but I’ve always been independent, and accepting her help feels… wrong, somehow. Like she’s trying to make up for giving me up for adoption when she clearly had the means to raise me. But at the same time, I’m drowning in loans, and the idea of not stressing about money is so tempting. I just don’t know how to navigate that without feeling like a charity case.

I was severely anxious going out in public, I always had to know where the bathroom was. I knew every morning I would have diarrhea 2-3 times while getting ready and stomach discomfort up until the afternoon. Usually would feel “better” in the evening but my gut never felt normal. Always bloated, always feeling pressure and urgency. My stomach would rumble like it was starving for food almost 24/7. I’m still in disbelief but apparently I am just extremely sensitive to caffeine 

It almost seems too good to be true but I just eliminated caffeine. That’s it. I wasn’t even having that much caffeine. I would have one cup of coffee every morning and apparently over time my gut just couldn’t handle it? 

Anyways, if you haven’t done so yet, just try giving up caffeine for at least 30 days. I actually made an attempt at this before but only last about 2 or 3 weeks and I didn’t feel better so my attitude was “well if this isn’t working then I at least want my cup of coffee back”. Even this time, i didn’t start to feel better until about day 25 and each day after that I felt better and better and my stools got firmer and firmer and was going less and less.

I encourage it to try it if you haven’t before! My withdrawals weren’t too bad honestly. Lasted about 10 days for me. I would become super tired in the late morning and definitely had some brain fog but I am feeling back to normal finally after 2 years!",4,1750127721.0,ibs,0,0.83,False

Without stops, it was about a 6 hour ride. But, since it was raining the whole time and all I had on was a leather jacket, it took maybe 8 hours or so. I ended up getting a motel and stopping every hour or so just get some warm tea or coffee to stop the involuntary, convulsive shivering. Never in my life did I imagine myself being so happy seeing a McDonalds sign on the highway. I love riding but this was not only not enjoyable, but also dangerous. 

So, those of you who’ve dealt with the elements for years, what have you found to be the best solution to protect yourself from the rain? 

Would you recommend getting a dedicated waterproof motorcycle jacket? Or would it be a combination of using your regular jacket (e.g., leather jacket) and a poncho-type cover with a hood? Or are there other alternatives out there that have worked in the past?

I’ll try to make this as short as possible. Just know that I’ve made this home a safe place for my son. I’ve remarried and have a wonderful husband and family since 2012.. But I’ll start here..After an abusive two year relationship that spurned a volatile two year divorce, I was never able to move completely on. (Yes, it was a two year relationship and ALSO another two years to get divorced. The ex wouldn’t sign the papers.) He’s a control freak. He prevented our son from attending school until past kindergarten; which significantly stunted his education. HE wanted more time to have 50:50 visitation. When our son was diagnosed with ADHD at 8; HE said that the child didn’t need medicine. When our son needed glasses at 9; HE said he could see just fine. When our son needed BRACES because he had a secondary incisor growing by his molar at 11; He said “that’s not possible”. My ex refused to pay for ANYTHING that was covered as “uncovered medical expenses” even though he was supposed to pay half. He made my life hell trying to co-parent. I’d rather chew sandpaper than have a conversation with this man. Finally, in 2018 the bast*rd went to jail. He showed his true colors to his family and friends and people were coming out of the woodwork to apologize for when they didn’t believe me. When I was getting hands put on me during our divorce and relationship. I finally felt seen. Our son was 12 when he went to jail for 18 months and was 14 when his father got out. Little did my ex understand that our son, felt abandoned. He no longer wanted a relationship with his dad. And although I hated this man with every ounce of me, I was sad our son didn’t want his own dad in his life. I always asked our son to go and he said “no.” (This lasted for nearly two years.) So I asked them to go to counseling together and my ex is the one who refused. Fast forward to Friday, 13th of June. The judge granted me full custody of my son in lieu of his father paying support. We are no longer bound by any visitation agreements and his father has no rights. And before anyone feels bad about it; I want to let you know that our son wanted this more than anything. He wants his stepfather to adopt him. I have never felt more free in my meager existence. I no longer have to worry about leaving my house and being followed (yes, that’s happened.) I don’t have to worry about a fight for weekend visits or his condescending attitude. And I damn sure don’t care if he falls off a cliff somewhere. Who knows..it might not be over.

What: We all must make a point to drive to the office on July 1st and arrive between the hours of 7:30 am -8:30 am.  My Dept is being told to “figure it out” if there’s no parking when we arrive. Cool cool.

How: We must make it clear that it’s going to cause chaos and a breakdown of traffic in not just that area but all connecting areas. We have to demonstrate there’s a clear issue with not just parking but getting there in general. We want to create a traffic jam to demonstrate how ridiculous this is. Grab your coffee and pump your music. Protesting is not just standing outside holding a sign.

Why: The Agency is trying to get an exemption but King Newsom doesn’t think we have a problem. Everyone can take public transit or ride share or car pool is his response. There’s not even enough carpool parking! Let alone light rail station is closed through next year, no one can afford to uber to work everyday.

We need to bring as much media attention to this issue as possible. We can get the exemption for our complex but we need to show we have a HUGE problem. Gavin hates bad media attention so let’s use that. I will personally be contacting as many news outlets as possible. Invite anyone you know.

If you want to assist the Agency to get an exemption then share this information with as many of your MSLOC colleagues as possible. Let’s show the state of California and the people what the governor’s refusal to act reasonable looks like.

At the time (more than 1 year ago) I went for a P72 Xeon 2186M, Quadro P5500, 80GB of RAM, 2x 2TB 970 Evo plus and 4k screen (and smart card reader, fingerprint reader, infrared camera) for... 720€ simply best deal of my life. Best machine I've ever had (and I went through a lot of marchines of that class) especially considering I've been able to consistently undervolt it and was the only one in which I've been able to use an old (and still much used) Emu 1616m PCI/PCIe card through thunderbolt.

After a few months I've seen an even better deal: someone on ebay was selling what the title said to be a T16 but photos where a mix of T16 (official Lenovo photos) and P16 (no official photos, seemed like just pphotos by the seller). Got it at 900€ with i7-12850HX, 1x32GB, A3000, FHD screen, 1TB NVMe. I very much preferred the P72 (except for the hube bezel and 16:9 screen) but for all the rest even the gorgeous P72 couldn't keep up so I sold it.

Fast forward to this post: great machine but don't want (because of weight and oissible damage) to bring it to pubs/coffees/meetings so I started my quest to identify a thinkpad (oh, did I mention that the keyboard on the P16 is way worse than the P72 and older thinkpads?) with a great balance of weight/battery life/screen (modding) options and purchased:

* X280 i5-8250u 8GB, 12.5 FHD, smartcard, fingerprint 126€. Purchased new battery, added NFC. Replaced the screen with a 13"" 16:10 2160x1350 panel\*
* X390 i5-8365u 8GB, 13.3 HD 89€ as sold for parts. The machine would shut down under windows because battery temperature sensor reports 100-105° C without the battery. Works find under PopOs, will retry windows when I get the new battery
* X13 Ryzen 5 Pro 4650U, 16GB fullHD for 47€: machine sold for parts. Wouldn't power up. Took me 1 week to diagnose and fix the problem: bricked BIOS that I reflashed with a CH431 and now working fine
* T480s: i5-8350u 16GB, FHD screen. 140€. Super dishonest seller as when I told him that I wanted 90€ back or I would return the item, he said I could send it back and that I was missing a great deal. This was the great deal (breaker):

[TB3 port destroyed so they've put glue to prevent its usage](https://preview.redd.it/12zfyrhyce7f1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9ba3400b5dc6dc4fec666223641912a04e10b96)

I'm super annoyed with the T480s. It would be interesting for the SD card reader and bigger battery but too much wasted space (keyboard/screen bezel). I've recently worked on a Dell Latitude 7440: 313x220mm (331x226 for the T480s). I know the comparison is unfair (latitude being super recent) but I just don't like those huge borders of wasted space.

The X13 Gen 1 is undoubtely the best in terms of performance (especially given what I pad for it) but when idling it consumes much more than its Intel counterparts. Given I will be using it mostly in idle (reading mail/web, writing ails/docs/presentation) that's important. And it shares the main no-go with the X390: impossible to mod and put a 16:10 screen: taller ones whouldn't fit, smaller ones would leave empty space on the sides if I fit a panel similar to the on one I've put in the X280. Same ports as the X280. So at the end of the day, I decided I'll stick to the X280: best battery-life (more than 36h without sleep with the lid closed so screen off, but no sleep), most compact and light, max real-estate with the 13"" 16:10 and at +180ppi. I'm only super annoyed by the fake SDcard: so what if you put a simcard and need to swap the SD-card? I get the X280 is small but still, it's not a smartphone! Perhaps one day I'll swap the motherboard if I find a 16GB version for super cheap.

I hope this can help others that I often see questioning here on what should they buy. A super big thank to the community for your help in troubleshooting issues I've fixed on these babies that now can keep serving ;)

Feel free to A.M.A. possibly before I resell the ones I won't keep now that they have new batteries and are repasted with PTM7950 and other treats ;)

1ldbogv,https://www.reddit.com/r/SnarkyRecapsBySwiss/comments/1ldbogv/live_shows_from_eeworld_attraction_6_coming/,Live Shows from $eeWorld: Attraction 6 Coming Soon/Summer Hours of Operation | Baby #6 Q&A + My Morning Routine!,"Hello, hello Snarkers. I overextended myself this weekend and now my pain is literally your gain. I’m fine, I just need to rest up a bit this week, which means I have time on my hands and a keyboard to pass the time. Today it’s J’Blessa’s turn under my snarky lens, so let’s get to it.

J’Blessa starts out her morning routine cozily propped up in bed, reading a book that isn’t the Bible. She then reaches over and sips an iced coffee drink that sits on her nightstand. If Bin appears in livery like a Downton Abbey footman with a croissant served on a doily, we need to reassess the dynamics of $eeWorld. The camera is moved closer to her as she whispers to us that her new life plan has been to get up before her kids, despite being a Duggar basically raised on a second shift schedule from birth to adulthood. The book has been set aside as she sits cross-legged on her bed as she explains that she now wakes up at 6 am and the kids wake up at 7:30. The “younger three” have a clock in their room that turns green when they can come out of their rooms. She has surprisingly not linked it to an Amazon listing. S. Elliot and Hank can read a clock well enough that they no longer require a color-coded clock. By stealing these morning hours she has gained some really really, *really* special time. She has quality time to read, she doesn’t have to steal time at naptime or after bedtime anymore. $eeWorld Attraction 6 will be here in a few short months and wreck her fine tuned routine, as usual. J’Blessa is aware of this and assures us it takes several months to get back to her regularly scheduled life of leisurely morning reads. She picks up a book and as she brings it closer to the camera to start telling us about the tome that she was reading. Before she can start her spiel, a cry erupts from a child. J’Blessa looks toward the door of her room, just barely contains a sigh and slowly gets out of bed after identifying the crying child as Pastor GAS.  

J’Blessa loads up the camera and opens the door to see Pastor GAS’s pack n play in the laundry room, crying as J’Blessa channels Perm’s saccharine voice. “Good Morning, did you have a good sleep last night?” In her normal voice she tells us that he is usually the first one up in the morning, adding in a kiss and a “love you” to her 5^(th) child. She turns his light on, the first step in his routine. He sleeps in the closet because he is still young enough that he wakes up in the night. By the 7^(th) kid, the Greenhouse the Plants sleep in will be the new version of the Girls’ Room at TTH. She then gives him a bit of toddler puffs in a cup and a sippy, a couple of toys to entertain himself and then gets back to her reading time. This system usually nets J’Blessa 20-30 more minutes of reading time. She shows us her iced coffee, she keeps it in the fridge and microdoses it throughout the day. Next, we are informed of how she has been reading the Bible straight through and just finished the Old Testament a couple of days ago. All that effort and she’s not going to use any critical thinking to translate the words she read into anything that adapts to modern day life. She’s going to be running up on the Golden rule and the Beatitudes pretty quick and not see she isn’t the meek, nor the righteous. She states she’s been able to dig deeper when she follows her own pace, which I guess? We finally get to the book plug and this one does come with “a link down below”. It’s titled “Consider the Lilies, Finding Perfect Peace in the Character of God”. Even my extensive fluency in parochial-ese is having trouble with the phrasing on that last bit. Oh, it’s recommended by her crush’s mentor, John MacArthur. No wonder it’s escaping my ability to translate, it’s patriarchal word salad with some Keep Sweet dressing and Have Faith, not Anxiety croutons. “Super helpful” claims J’Blessa.

Moving on to the next item of business, J’Blessa also fits a workout routine in before letting the Plants out of the GreenHouse. This is the first time she’s exercised while pregnant and who wants to bet that’s Kath!s influence? J’Blessa stops to shill a workout app. Someone was customizing her plan for the day, likely AI. A couple of quick barbell pumps and J’Blessa scoots her way over to the Windex-speckled mirror in her bathroom. After lamenting that she only notices how dirty the mirror is when she’s filming makes me think that the mirror loves to see that camera get carried in. She misses a few spots and starts to extoll the values of stretchy black leggings, that she calls “joggers”. She shows off a maternity tank (3 pack on Amazon, no link) and then begins to apply her makeup. J’Blessa is who every fertility cult little girl hopes to be. Somone who doesn’t have super difficulties with pregnancy symptoms, and once she survived her near death birth experience with S. Elliot she seems to have straightforward deliveries. J’Blessa goes on to state that her main priority is sleep in “this season”. She’s not rigid about it, she’s just rigid about waking up at 6. With that in mind she usually calls it a night at about 9 or 10 and feels so much better when she gets 8 hours. Again, she knows that a new baby is the antithesis of routine and sleeping through the night. J’Blessa says sleep, activity and nutrition are her key focuses. With that in mind, she grabs the bottle of prenatal vitamins to link those too but Pastor GAS interrupts her again. Her eyes close in frustration at the second instance of Shill-us Interruptus and turns to leave the room because Pastor GAS is getting unhappy. He appears on her hip as she goes back into her spiel. This was a Jingle recommendation, and she’s used it for the last 3 pregnancies. Pastor GAS gets a front row seat to J’Blessa’s GRWM, and she asks what he thinks of her basic makeup routine. She flashes her liquid foundation, powder and CoverGirl blush. We aren’t supposed to judge her for using a CoverGirl blush she’s had forever and like, what do you mean forever? Like it was discontinued 15 years ago and she’s still got some left in the blush or what? She then goes after her eyebrows and a drugstore mascara, that “again, don’t judge”. No one cares what mascara you use, J’Blessa. You’re not Bailey Sarian. J’Blessa doesn’t apply eyeliner or eyeshadow anymore and the final piece de resistance is vanilla Burt’s Bees.  After letting her hair out of the bun she had it in, she brushes out yesterday’s curls and offers to brush Pastor GAS’s hair. After nixing his bed head in the back, she watches as he smacks the mirror. Probiotics are up next, declares J’Blessa as she sweeps her hair off the floor with her hairbrush.

The hashtag with seedpartner appears and she starts her spiel about pre and probiotics telling us which specific item she takes. The disclaimer pops up that you should always consult a doctor before starting a supplement in pregnancy. Well at least she’s not being reckless there. I’m sure the shill tells them to write the disclaimer. She goes on to say it’s helped her bloating and constipation issues. There we have it folks, don’t put your kids in the public eye. They end up being insufferable oversharers who think everyone wants to know every little thing about their lives. Pastor GAS sits on the edge of the counter and watches his mother flash her powder packets and pop her pills with a water bottle.  He’s up next, getting the kid’s version. It’s a smaller packet and she puts it in kefir. Jesus, it’s probably like the Ken battle from Barbie in that kefir. You should use probiotics to make kefir but premade kefir (she clarifies she doesn’t make her own) isn’t guaranteed to have much effect from adding the probiotics. She empties half the packet into a plastic cup and adds blueberry kefir with a straw. Pastor GAS is “eager” she says to slurp down what is essentially blueberry yogurt. Pastor GAS lifts his hand to the camera in a wave, J’Blessa says he puts his hands up when he’s done eating. Girl, please. He’s making eye contact with the camera. Well, so is she so maybe she’s just guessing. Who knows. After putting the product in front of her current youngest’s face, she promises to put the link below and flashes a 25% discount. That caps off her morning routine. Someday the Plants will write what they did with their early morning hours before the clock turns green.

It's 7:28 and she expects the other $eeWorld Attractions any moment. They are allowed unlimited reading time and a late night might cause them to sleep in a bit. Breakfast is late anyways because “that’s the way we roll.” Cute. While we wait, she’s going to read to Pastor GAS. She says about half wake up on their own and the other half she has to go and wake up. The camera is set on a side table and we are treated to J’Blessa reading to her current youngest. This is a book called “I’m a Big Brother”. Obviously he couldn’t use the Plants’ Big Sister version after all. Pastor GAS attempts an escape and gets tickled like the kid in the book. J’Blessa says since it’s still quiet she will attempt her Q&A that no one asked for. Pastor GAS fusses before J’Blessa returns and savors her iced coffee as she settles into the couch.

Question 1- Jinder Reveal. Nope, they find out themselves and then let the baby reveal it’s jinder itself. It’s their tradition. The Plants and Pastors have begged to be let in, and are told first so they are the ones who announce it to the grandparents and general public.

Question 2- Birth Plan. Talks about her first three homebirths, how much she loves them, how she had to be transported twice, and how they decided in hospital was wiser. She thought she would be a water birth and said she had done that already so she’s doing a full hospital birth now. She goes on about the epidurals she had, and says a sister-in-love told her about a tincture or something (place your bets below on who and or what that was) that eliminates after birth cramps, her least favorite part. Apparently, with Pastor GAS she needed to push him into a lower and better position and had them turn the epidural off. All in all she seems to like the homebirth idea more. She did like turning the epidural back on but she plans to labor at home as long as possible. We get each child’s time listed, with S. Elliot taking 2 days, Hank taking 5 hours, Plant 1 taking 3 hours, with Plant 2 and Pastor GAS both coming in at 21 hours. Hank and Plant 1 had water break at the beginning of their labors, while the other three had their bags broken right before birth. This is not a Q&A, this is a public baby book. A bespectacled Hank gets his mother’s attention. J’Blessa tells him she’s making a video and asks if he has his camera. He says yes, climbs behind his mother and then comes out to show his digital camera. According to J’Blessa, Hank saved up his own money for the camera. Hank shows the camera a video of Pastor GAS sitting on the back porch. J’Blessa said Pastor GAS will sit there for 10-15 minutes.

Question 3- Which kid number transition was hardest. Most people say from 2 kids to 3 and she explains that they say so because of not enough hands if they’re out with all the kids. She thinks each transition is it’s own unique struggles. Did she pad out her SOTDRT essays this bad? For her part, she thinks it’s 0 kids to 1 kid. The loss of the carefree life to having to pack diapers and bottles etc. J’Blessa tries to understand having a break where all the kids were out of diapers as she probably won’t be in that “season” for a good 10 more years. She gathers her thoughts and continues bather on about raising a pack of children. The challenge, she posits is finding time to “know their heart” and “spend quality time 1-on-1”. Gee, you’d think she’d be more mindful about giving her children more emotional availability than she herself had. Bin works 5-6 days a week, and so he has to be more intentional about making time for the kids. Which raises the question. Where is he? What pastor has to be up and out of the way before 6:30 am? Not once has Bin been mentioned until now. He’s not any part of her morning routine to hear her tell it. Two kids get breakfast or lunch dates with Bin per week, and he plays in the yard with them at night. She thinks it’s important regardless of having one kid or 19. We get a refresher that she is one of 19 kids and Bin is the oldest of 7 and so they both know how important it is. J’Blessa says her parents in particular were so good at this aspect of having a lot of kids. They would even take a whole Saturda               y to have a 1 on 1 chat with each child. Sounds like some real quality time going on. She uses air quotes to denote how she thinks spontaneity isn’t important to parent-child relationships and goes on to say how thankful she is for that example. If only Sperm cared enough to pay attention to her brown nosing.

Question 3 A- How do you deal with negativity about having a big family? \*cracks knuckles\* J’Blessa gets her whole chest ready to state that they only live for the approval of God, not others. I don’t know that I am necessarily negative about her having a large family as much as I think they are perpetuating a harmful belief system on children and educationally neglecting them. The amount of children you have doesn’t necessarily dictate how well you will or won’t parent them, but following a system that your parents used to basically clip your wings so that you couldn’t achieve anything greater than they did doesn’t bode well. Anyways, she says they aren’t at the 1-2 extreme nor the Sperm and Perm extreme, she thinks they mentioned 7 at one point. They have no problem spacing their kids out or saying their family is complete but that they don’t know. After a new baby arrives, J’Blessa says she’s not in a space to make decisions about future children and Bin cares most about her health and capacity to love and care for each one. Cue incoming vlog about their crowd-sharing Christian insurance. Their “ultimate goal is seeing each one come to love the Lord.” See what I mean? Each child’s free will is their enemy. Each child is being raised with that expectation. And again, I get it to a point. Religion is a major pillar of most cultures, belief in a deity and raising your child to believe the same stretches back to antiquity. In my family one side is super Lutheran, like 500+ years of direct lineage through church records, continuing to the US in the mid and late 1800s. That doesn’t mean you should force your kids to do something they don’t want, or limit them so they don’t even consider another option. If Baby Swiss had ever said “I don’t want to get confirmed,” I would have stopped taking her to the Confirmation classes. No guilt trip, no nothing. She made her own choice. The various Duggalos and Duggalettes tell on themselves that they place having the same religion as the main thing they are worried about. J’Blessa finishes up her comment about how she and Bin trust in the Lord and rely on him to tell them how many they should have. They have to lead them to Christ, and pretend to extend the “personal decision” lie again before rolling into the negative comments. She says they’re online, not to her face. And to that I have to say “don’t make vlogs announcing how many kids you have now and no one will comment on your sex life”. I would have no content if they just all shut up and got off the internet. But they persist and so must I. J’Blessa stops to drop in a Perm love note after saying she definitively won’t have 19, but that Perm is her hero, she loves her, she adores her. The virtue vomit keeps flowing as J’Blessa lists her favorite things. Her answer to if she wants to be like her mother is “Yes, please Lord.” She does think that if it wasn’t just on social media it would be way harder to put up with. J’Blessa blathers on about setting the tone for when we give news. She says they use “we’re so blessed” instead of “we’re expecting”. She goes on to say that “we weren’t expecting to be expecting” or “it was a surprise” isn’t “catering to how other people might think.” She gives a play by play for how to give information to keep people from judging them, including backpedaling information. She finishes up with “we don’t want other people’s approval”. Suuuuuure you don’t. OH MY GOD she won’t shut up about how much she doesn’t care. This is *literally* the lady protesteth too much. Pastor GAS is even tired of it and brings over a tattered red, white and blue volleyball. He gets situated behind his mother on the couch as she says she is going to go pretty quickly. I’ll believe that when I see it. There’s 3 and a half minutes left in the run time.

She doesn’t even have another question, just goes into a blog (linked in the description box, natch) that she likes talking about rest time throughout the whole house. Y’all, she’s discovered the concept of a siesta. This is why her homeschooling is borderline negligent. Anyways, she likes it because the rest of the kids are running around all day and the younger kids are the only ones napping. Gee, it’s almost like there are 5 kids running around a ranch style house. Luckily she wraps up homeschool around 1 then can institute the $eeWorld Siesta until 3 pm. Books, nap, and art are allowed. Each child has access to a book case in the two bedrooms and art supplies. She uses the time for a pregnancy lie down or loading the dishwasher etc. Pastor GAS squirms out of his mother’s grasp and looks out the window as J’Blessa’s laser focus informs us that she likes to also weed the flowerbeds or read, pre-cook and prep ground beef, plan activities or menus or visitors.

Mercifully, finally J’Blessa runs out of steam and signs off. This one was a marathon y’all at almost 32 minutes but I got it bashed out of these little gamer lighted keys. I’ll try to keep the momentum going and I hope y’all have a great night and a better tomorrow!  ",1,1750126872.0,SnarkyRecapsBySwiss,0,1.0,False

1ldbn0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/IslaMujeres/comments/1ldbn0k/full_review_of_almare_adults_only_allinclusive/,"Full Review of Almare, adults only all-inclusive resort in Isla Mujeres","We just returned from a fantastic 4-night stay at Almare Isla Mujeres, a Luxury Collection Resort by Marriott. All-in-all, this is one of the best resort experiences we’ve had so far! For context, this is our 10th adults only all-inclusive resort. This was our second trip to Mexico and our first trip we split between Privilege Aluxes in Isla Mujeres and Secrets the Vine in Cancun. Almare blew both of those resorts out of the water.

ARRIVAL: The trip to Almare was a great first impression. They partner with Renaissance Resort & Marina (another Marriott property) and the Almare maritime transfer picks you up from the dock there. Renaissance is a gorgeous, very luxe resort. The boat to Almare leaves every 2 hours and we were able to time the arrival of our flight perfectly so we weren’t waiting at Renaissance for very long. The boat ride is beautiful and is only about 20 minutes long so we arrived at the resort at about 9:00am. The views are gorgeous and we were on the boat with some of the employees so we were able to chat with them a bit. Upon arrival at the Almare dock, we were greeted with a delicious signature passion fruit drink and cold towels. Check-in was very easy and the young man working the front desk was just the sweetest! We were SO impressed when we were told our room was already ready for us! We went and freshened up quickly before getting a resort tour and heading off to breakfast.

SERVICE: This is honestly where Almare shines the most. The service was absolutely exceptional. By far, the best service we’ve received at any resort. It is clear that the management has high standards for their employees and everyone was fantastic. The beach service was impeccable! We had two main beach servers during our stay: Karen and Alejandro and both of them were absolutely amazing. Checking in with us frequently, quickly learning our preferences and tastes, and providing speedy service. They are both so kind and friendly! We really enjoyed getting to know them. We had two restaurant servers who stood out to us, as well, Ivan and Edgar. Both were very helpful, courteous, and friendly. Service everywhere we went was speedy and efficient. Outside of our first dinner and one of the mornings at Boga for breakfast, it never took long to be served our meals. It was obvious that of our meals were served as soon as they were ready because everything was hot and fresh. Even room service was surprisingly quick!

FOOD: Almare prides itself on having a focus on “gastronomy” which means the menu offerings are quite gourmet and a bit complicated. All restaurants are a la carte only and there are no buffets. Our meals were all delicious, well cooked, and high-quality. We especially loved the lunch menu for the pool/beach and oftentimes had a difficult time deciding what to order! Our favorites were: the rib eye tacos, ceviche, poke bowl, and hamburger. We both agreed that the burgers at Almare were easily the best burgers we’ve ever had at an AI resort and the fries were always fresh and crispy. The food truck offered some great lighter and healthier lunch/snack options. Even the room service food was outstanding! We ordered room service for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and every time the food came in a timely fashion (usually around 30 minutes) and it was all fresh and delicious. We didn’t notice any difference in the quality or selection of food for the room service compared to the other restaurants. The coffee offered at the cafe is high-quality and the specialty coffees were delicious. As far as food goes, our only complaint is that due to the focus on having more of a “gourmet” menu, we had a difficult time finding dining options for dinner that offered what we were looking for. Much of the food was saucy, buttery, and heavy and we found ourselves looking for something a little lighter by the end of the day. Even the pizzas offered at Seasalt are very gourmet with lots of toppings and flavors. On our last night, we both wanted just a simple cut of meat with maybe some side vegetables so we ended up ordering salmon and New York steak for room service and really enjoyed our meal. The steak was perfectly cooked and tender, but it was covered in a thick sauce which was tasty but heavier than what I was wanting. My only other criticism is that I have a big sweet tooth it was hard to find something I wanted for dessert. The a la carte desserts didn’t really offer what I was looking for and even though there was ice cream on the online menu for the cafe, they didn’t have any. They had some pastries in the cafe but there were only a couple options I was interested in and they didn’t quite hit the spot. One day they had little cheesecakes in the cafe but they ran out of them early and I didn’t get a chance to try one… they did look delicious! They also had cheesecake on the room service menu but it wasn’t available when I tried to order it.

DRINKS: All of the drinks we had were high-quality and strong. The bars offered a great selection of alcohol, including some top shelf brands. They have a great menu and I was able to try quite a few drinks that were unlike anything I’ve ever had! I particularly liked the Red Sunset, Haunted Jungle, and Full Moon.

ROOM: We stayed in a Deluxe Oceanfront room with a king bed and a double jacuzzi-style tub. The bed was the best we’ve ever had at a resort and was incredibly comfortable. The room was beautiful and the location was fantastic. Housekeeping was great and consistent. My only criticisms are these:  
\- The room never got below 20 degrees celsius which was just a bit too warm for our taste.

\- The ceiling fan didn’t appear to have different speeds… Or if it did, the switch wasn’t working because it would only turn on/off. I checked with the front desk and they weren’t sure but we didn’t want to have to deal with maintenance so we just let it be.

\- There is very little storage in the room type we were in. The closet is small and there aren’t really any drawers. We ended up with our stuff sitting around on top of counters, benches, etc, which made the room feel messy. An extra set of drawers would be amazing! I toured other room categories which had more closet space and storage, but the smaller rooms need some additional storage for sure.

\- There are SO many light switches and none of them are labeled. It’s great because you can really customize the lighting in the room but it’s frustrating to have to try all of the switches to figure out what each one does. There were a couple of nights when my husband had fallen asleep and some lights were on but in my attempt to turn them off, I accidentally used the wrong switches and turned additional lights on which woke him up.

BEACH: The beach is beautiful and the workers kept it clean. It is very small, but it never felt crowded and we had no issues getting shaded chairs every day. The water is beautiful, clear, and calm with no sargassum issues due to its location on the island. My only complaint with the beach is that there are a lot of rocks, especially at the waterline, and a decent amount of sea grass. I recommend bringing water shoes to make it more comfortable to enter/exit the water. During the afternoon, the beach is not particularly quiet. There are two beach clubs on either side of the resort and they do have music starting in the afternoon. There is also a very busy dock that has lots of boat traffic with people staying at the beach club. Sometimes the boats would be playing music as well. We didn't find any of this to be particularly bothersome and it didn't prevent us from enjoying the beach, but it is worth noting.

POOL: There are two pools at this resort. One main pool with a swim-up bar and then a rooftop wading pool with gorgeous ocean views. The main pool is where most of the daily activities were hosted and that’s where the majority of the guests hung out throughout the day, but there were always chairs available. The rooftop pool was pretty quiet because the bar and lunch time menu weren’t running during our trip due to low occupancy. We enjoyed going up there to enjoy some quiet, more secluded time and the beautiful views.

ACTIVITIES: This is a very quiet and laid back resort. There were usually a couple activities throughout the day, but they were all more low-key or fitness-focused. Things like yoga, stretching, trivia, Lotería, or guided walks. We went on the guided walk to the local cemetery with Julian and he was fantastic! So informative and the experience gave us a great taste of the local culture there. We also went on the guided walk to Punta Sur with Noe and loved him, as well! He was very friendly and shared a lot of interesting information about the Mayan culture on the island. The walk was gorgeous and we got some great pictures!

SUMMARY: Almare is a fantastic resort and is only going to get better as it ages. It’s a great option for honeymooners looking for something relaxed and intimate, small groups of adult friends or families looking for a luxury group trip, destination weddings, etc. I wouldn’t recommend it for anyone looking for something super lively or energetic.

Recommendations for management to consider: Outside of the recommendations I already listed for the room… some other things to consider include:  
\- Rotating menus for dinner since dining options are limited.  
\- Having a lunch option for guests leaving on the 11:30 departing boat transfer to the airport since lunch doesn’t technically begin until 11:30/12:00. We were extremely grateful to Alejandro for putting in a to-go order for us to take with us on the boat.  
\- More quick or simple dessert options like ice cream

1ldbkn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1ldbkn1/end_game_by_david_baldacci_it_was_seven_thirty_am/,"End Game by David Baldacci: It was seven thirty a.m. local time when he finally exited the airport. Robie rode in a multicolored taxi into the city, which, with traffic and the rainy weather, took well over an hour. He was dropped off at an address near Marylebone Road. It wasn’t a hotel, but.....","AS WILL ROBIE STARED out the plane window, he knew the next twenty-four hours could possibly be his last ones on earth.  Yet that was simply another day on the job for him.  The undercarriage of multiple reinforced wheels touched down and grabbed the tarmac, and the thrust reversers engaged. The world’s largest commercial airliner taxied to a stop at the gate. The doors, both forward and aft, on the upper and lower cabins opened. The passengers trooped down the Jetways and into Terminal Five at Heathrow Airport.  The English skies were slicked with fat, darkened clouds and the rain was falling. It was weather familiar to any Brit.  Robie, wearing a navy blue two-piece tailored suit and fitted white collared shirt, was among hundreds of passengers deplaning the British Airways jumbo A380 just landed from Washington, DC.  The flight had become a little bumpy midway over the Atlantic. However, Robie hadn’t noticed. With his flat business-class seat, he’d slept pretty much the whole ride.  He cleared Customs, informing the border officer that he was there solely on business of an academic nature. He had carried on his single small bag and thus had no reason afterward to go to Baggage Claim. Everything he would need was already in London. And none of it was anything he could reasonably have carried on a plane.  It was seven thirty a.m. local time when he finally exited the airport.  Robie rode in a multicolored taxi into the city, which, with traffic and the rainy weather, took well over an hour. He was dropped off at an address near Marylebone Road. It wasn’t a hotel, but rather a nondescript private row house near the juncture of Marylebone and Baker Street. Robie punched in a code on the electronic box set next to the front door, and the fortified portal unlocked. He walked in, secured the door behind him, and headed upstairs.  He exchanged his two-piece suit and dress shirt for more casual wear. He popped open a wall safe in the closet and took out the flash drive. His Agency used cloud computing, but the leadership didn’t fully trust that it couldn’t be hacked, since clearly anything could be hacked. He pulled out his laptop and inserted the drive in the USB port. He tapped some keys and up on the screen appeared the only reason he had come to London.  It was a read-only document, and it was not remotely business of an academic nature.  
  He absorbed the information on the screen. It ended with a note from Robie’s superior, Blue Man. His real name was Roger Walton. The term Blue Man came from his exalted position at their Agency. The note, written more than a week earlier, was brief and to the point, just like Blue Man always was.  
  
  You can do this for one simple reason: You’re Will Robie. I’ll see you when we both get back. Onward.  
  
  Robie understood that in those few words was a volume’s worth of meaning.  
  
  I am Will Robie and I’ve been through hell and back. And I will survive this.  
  
  Onward.  
  
  He next performed an NSA-level wipe of the flash drive, tantamount to smashing it flat with a brick then setting it afire. The ones and zeroes were permanently gone, now existing only in his memory.  
  
  He stretched out on the bed and stared up at the ceiling.  
  
  Mississippi seemed a long time ago.  
  
  His father seemed a long time ago.  
  
  Everything seemed a long time ago.  
  
  He was back in harness and glad for it, because all other elements of his life sucked.  
  
  Stop the bullshit. This is your life.  
  
  Like the NSA cleanse on the flash drive, he shed these thoughts and closed his eyes. Despite his rest on the plane, he needed sleep. He would not be getting any later tonight.  
  
  He rose in the early evening and checked the sky. Still cloudy, but no more rain. Since this was London, that could change at any moment.  
  
  He ate at a nearby pub and walked the pavements. His swift gait carried him past many buildings and hundreds of people walking along in what he knew was a blissful ignorance of another possible attack on London. Then again, full knowledge might have started a panic. And they couldn’t have that, could they? Londoners had endured several recent terrorist attacks. Evil driving in cars had smashed into innocent pedestrians on both Westminster and London Bridges. Yet with enviable courage and calm, the town’s citizenry were carrying on with their lives. But something else was up now and it had to be dealt with.  
  
  So they had sent Will Robie.  
  
  He returned to his row house, made some calls on a secure line that bounced off one particular bird in the sky, and was told that everything was a go for the moment. As with the weather, he knew that could always change.  
  
  It was like a false start in the hundred-meter dash. Cocked and locked and fired and then called off. It could be unsettling.  
  
  It was a wonder he wasn’t messed up from it.  
  
  Well, maybe he was.  
  
  Robie sat by the window for two hours, like a sentry on watch, missing nothing. This place was heavily—though discreetly—fortified and monitored 24/7 by eyes on another continent. Still, his stone-cold rule was to rely on himself and no one else. He was the one who would die if everything went to shit. The eyes on the other continent might simply get a memo on how to fix the mess in the future.  
  
  A little too late to do him any good.  
  
  Darkness had come as the globe spun on its axis, and another part of the world got to see the light.  
  
  He checked his phone. The solitary bird in the sky told him that his mission was still a go.  
  
  Later, Big Ben chimed midnight. It was a soothing, familiar melody to most Brits. To Robie, it was like the sound of a time card being punched.  
  
  He donned a customized, lightweight, black one-piece waterproof motorcycle suit and left by the back door. He opened the locked door of a garage in the mews and climbed astride the black Ducati XDiavel parked there and key-started it. The big engine bled noise and power through its stacked twin oval exit pipes. He slipped on his helmet, popped the kickstand, gunned the throttle, and blew out of the garage riding a power plant that displaced more than twelve hundred ccs cranking at a max rpm of 9,500. Its Bosch fuel injection system was a full ride-by-wire package.  
  
  For most, this was an expensive toy that, fully racked out, would set you back about twenty grand.  
  
  Tonight, it was simply Robie’s ride to work.  
  
  He headed northwest.  
  
  The bike’s tires gripped the asphalt firmly and threw up rainwater as he flashed through nearly empty streets. A bit later his destination was up ahead. Well, it was the first of his destinations tonight. He thundered into an alley and quickly slowed.  
  
  He cut the power to the bike, hopped off, and used a tool hidden behind a dustbin to lift the manhole cover located there. This was Destination #1. He used the metal rungs to clamber down about a hundred feet.  
  
  He kept his helmet on for one reason only.  
  
  He hit a switch at the back of the headpiece, and his helmet became the latest-generation panoramic night-vision optics, the same platform used by American combat pilots. It enhanced the visuals in the darkened utility tunnel to such a degree that it was almost like he was on the surface of the sun, minus the heat. Researchers were now working on contact lenses utilizing a thin layer of graphene between slender layers of glass that could take the place of the current bulky devices. The percentage of light pickup was not yet where it needed to be to make the innovation viable, so for now, Robie wore a bulky helmet to see in the dark.  
  
  High-tech to kill.  
  
  But it wasn’t like the other side came to the battle with six-shooters and WWII-era optics.  
  
  He looked at his watch. He was one minute ahead of schedule. He slowed his pace. Early in his line of work was never a good thing.  
  
  He was forty-one years old, six one, a buck-eighty, and physically ripped because his job required i  
t. His endurance levels and pain tolerances were off the chart—again, because they had to be. He had been selected for this line of work with the basic requirements already in place: He had a body, he had a mind, and he feared basically nothing.  
  
  Then over the years they had ground into him a whole other being, still possessing the basics plus a spectrum of skills that most people could never imagine, much less achieve.  
  
  Some days it was hard for Robie to see where the machine ended and the human began. If the human was in fact still there. In Mississippi it had shown itself. Now? It had receded.  
  
  Maybe forever.  
  
  His face was lean and weathered, and his eyes deep-set and alert. His hair was always cut short because he had no time to bother with it. He had old wounds and scars over his torso and limbs; each told a story of near-fatal results he would rather forget.  
  
  As he walked along he moved his right arm in a slow circular motion. All surgically repaired, scar tissue removed, tendons and ligaments all tidied up, as the Brits would say. It was 99 percent of what it used to be, the docs had assured him. That was really good. But really good rarely cut it in Robie’s world.  
  
  They rebuilt me. But am I as good as I was? Or am I a slightly lesser version?  
  
  He would find out tonight if the missing one percent made the key difference between his walking away from this or remaining behind as a corpse.  
  
  Destination #2 was just up ahead.  
  
  If the Ducati had gotten him to Destination #1, what was coming up would get him back.  
  
  Alive.  
  
  He used a key to unlock a door set in the wall of the tunnel he was in.  
  
  Inside the small storage room revealed behind the door, he gunned up and put on his protective gear, which included the newest generation of personal armor.  
  
  His main arsenal consisted of an H&K UMP chambered in .45 ACP with a thirty-round box mag. He checked all working parts of the weapon and slung it over his shoulder. He slipped two extra mags into long pockets on his one-piece designed for just this purpose.  
  
  He figured if he couldn’t do the job with ninety rounds he didn’t deserve to come back. But just in case, there were twin M11s, each chambered in ten-millimeter with a laser sight built under the barrel. Where the dot hit so did the round.  
  
  He slipped the gun belt around his waist. Both pistols rode on the left side so he could pull with his dominant right hand, though if it came to it, he could kill ambidextrously with great efficiency.  
  
  A German-made KM2000 combat knife in its holder was attached to his belt.  
  
  Two M84 stun grenades were cradled in pockets on the rear of his belt.  
  
  Robie closed the door behind him and walked on.  
  
  Destination #3 was a quarter mile away.  
  
  In a fairly short time, Will Robie would know if he would get to see another sunrise or not.  
  
  Chapter  
  
  2  
  
  OXFORD CIRCUS.  
  
  It was one of the busiest stations on the London Underground, vying with both Waterloo and King’s Cross in a back-and-forth annual battle for the statistical title. It was in an upscale part of London with pricey and fashionable shops and buildings resting above it. The Underground carried nearly a billion and a half passengers per year and nearly a hundred million of them came through the Oxford Circus station annually.  
  
  The Underground had suffered a terrorist attack on July 7, 2005, when terrorists had blown themselves up on three separate train cars. A fourth device had been detonated on a London bus. In all, fifty-two victims were killed.  
  
  The explosive devices used that infamous day were powerful, but not nearly so powerful as what was currently being planned.  
  
  A cobalt bomb was at the center of this. One had never been detonated before. Also known as a salted bomb, it was a thermonuclear device designed to maximize the radiation fallout, leaving a large area contaminated for a hundred or more years.  
  
  Fortunately, it was a very difficult thing to accomplish.  
  
  Unfortunately, it was not impossible.  
  
  Even more unfortunately, one was now in London.  
  
  The speaker in Robie’s helmet relayed information to him as he walked along.  
  
  His final destination was just up ahead.  
  
  As he walked along he spun a suppressor onto the barrel of the UMP, then did the same for the twin M11s.  
  
  Stealth was called for tonight.  
  
  Until it wasn’t.  
  
  He reholstered the military-grade pistols and touched his chest. What was underneath there might end up saving his life tonight. He had the same protection on both thighs. Right below these shields were his femoral arteries, twin pipelines of massive blood flow. If those got pierced, he was a dead man. The bleed-out from a punctured femoral was almost never survivable.  
  
  Four people had given their lives in order for the intel leading up to the mission tonight to make its way to the Americans. The intelligence agencies had then shared it with the British, who remained one of the United States’ closest allies, regardless of who was in charge of the government at any given time. That had been the case ever since the English redcoats had burned down the American White House, which showed that strong friendship could indeed bloom from previously infertile ground. According to the information, the planned London op was merely a dress rehearsal for what would come later, in the United States.  
  
  Just like a manufacturer did in trying to commercialize a new product, terrorists needed to work the kinks out, too.  
  
  The kink was why Robie was now ascending a hundred feet to the surface.  
  
  His final destination was not another alley. It was a basement.  
  
  Of the four people to die in this operation so far, the third person had sacrificed her life to maneuver the target to stay in this building. Situated on the outskirts of London on a lonely street of a few modest residences, the structure had been used during World War II as a safe house and an operations center for senior government personnel. An escape tunnel and a bomb shelter had been paramount, and so they had been added. Over the last seven decades a floor had been put over the basement concrete and the trapdoor covered.  
  
  And forgotten.  
  
  It was no longer covered. And it was no longer forgotten.  
  
  London was an ancient city, and no one truly knew or understood all the passages and tunnels and labyrinths that lay underneath it, or how they all connected. A series of tunnels beneath that basement eventually intersected with a concrete pipeline that, with some minimal wall piercing, would allow one eventually to reach an equipment storage room under Oxford Circus Station. In that room the cobalt bomb was to be planted and detonated at the busiest hour of the day for the tube stop, when over a hundred thousand passengers would be in the station, with at least another hundred thousand pedestrians and vehicles immediately above. In all, over two million persons would be affected by the detonation as well as over a thousand buildings.  
  
  The place would be uninhabitable, for a century or two, at least.  
  
  Some dress rehearsal, thought Robie.  
  
  He didn’t want to see a far larger encore on American soil.  
  
  The terror cell he was targeting tonight planned to use the tunnel to their advantage.  
  
  Robie planned to use it to their supreme disadvantage.  
  
  The reasons that an army of police and special forces was not descending on this terrorist plot instead of one man were complicated but, distilled to bare essentials, easily understood.  
  
  Panic.  
  
  When an army moved, it could not be kept a secret.  
  
  But when one man moved, a secret could be maintained.  
  
  And to avoid revealing what had been planned to the world and causing just such a panic that the terrorists no doubt would have rejoiced over, they had sent Robie in to have a shot at taking the terrorists down. Alone.  
  
  The Brits had special-ops people who could have performed this mission. But the higher-ups had concluded that if things went sideways, having a non-Brit involved gave the home team the best grounds for plausible deniability.  
  
  However, nothi  
ng was being left to chance. There was a hidden army surrounding the home. If Robie failed, the army wouldn’t, panic be damned.  
  
  There were two homes on either side of the target. The residents in them had been prevented from returning home that night, so Robie had a bit of a buffer in which to operate and try to keep the mission out of the morning news broadcasts.  
  
  Hence the trio of suppressors on his gun barrels.  
  
  He finished climbing the rungs to the trapdoor. Though the people inside had no idea their mission had been compromised, they had taken standard protection procedures. The trapdoor was securely locked and also alarmed. But using three different tools provided to him, Robie ensured that it no longer was locked or alarmed.  
  
  He received one more communication in his headset.  “Vee-one.”  
  
  It was the same call-out used by the aviation industry. Vee-one meant the aircraft had reached sufficient takeoff speed and there was no going back.  
  
  Robie acknowledged that command and turned his comm pack off. From now until either he or his opponents were dead, there would be nothing more said.  
  
  His helmet was fitted with a wireless camera so that his handlers could see everything that he could. They would either watch Robie win, or else see the bullets coming that would kill him.  
  
  An M11 in his right hand, he opened the trapdoor and looked around.  
  
  Nothing.  
  
  He climbed up and quietly set the trapdoor back into place. The basement was what one would expect in an old, crappy house in a tattered neighborhood—it was dirty and smelled of mold.  
  
  But there was one element of interest. In a far corner was a metal box about six feet in length. He slipped over to it, squatted down, pulled an instrument from his belt, and ran it over the box. He looked at the readout meter.  
  
  Cobalt bomb confirmed. It wasn’t armed yet. They wouldn’t do so until they moved it to Oxford Circus.  
  
  And Robie also knew that he would keep himself between them and the bomb at all times.  
  
  He holstered his M11 and readied his UMP.  
  
  He rose and moved to the wooden stairs. From his intelligence briefing on the house he knew that the fourth riser up squeaked, so he went from the third to the fifth.  
  
  In addition to him, there were currently seventeen people inside this place.  
  
  Robie’s goal was to kill sixteen of them.  
  
  The fire selector on his UMP was set to two shots. One shot was enough to kill any man if placed properly, but Robie had left no room for chance.  
  
  The basement door was partially open.  
  
  He peered through it into the kitchen.  
  
  Two men sat at a table drinking what looked to be cups of coffee. They apparently needed a stimulant at this late hour.  
  
  He looked at his watch through his panoramic goggles.  
  
  The second hand was just sweeping to twelve.  
  
  Four…three…two…  
  
  On cue, the lights in the house went out as the power was cut.  
  
  Through his helmet Robie saw the two men clear as day jerk forward and then stand.  
  
  Then he watched them fall from suppressed UMP bursts delivered to their chests.  
  
  Two down, fourteen to go.  
  
  Robie was through the kitchen in three seconds and then hit the hallway.  
  
  His finger nudged the shot selector to full auto.  
  
  He did so because darkness tended to make people congregate closer.  
  
  Sure enough, coming down the narrow hall were three men, all with guns.  
  
  They opened fire. With pistols.  
  
  Robie pulled the UMP’s trigger, and two seconds and twenty-six rounds of concentrated fire later there were three more dead men on the floor of this humble abode. The UMP’s ejector sent the spent casings tumbling to the floor, where they sounded like metal pearls cascading from a broken necklace.  
  
  Five down, eleven to go.  
  
  He ejected the mag, slapped in a fresh one, and turned and rolled to his right as more gunfire came at him.  
  
  He counted two heads through his goggles.  
  
  He emptied half his UMP mag at them.  
  
  Seven down, nine to go.  
  
  Two more men appeared at the head of the stairs and fired down at Robie.  
  
  He could see that they had on NVGs as well, so his tactical advantage had lessened.  
  
  He pulled a stun grenade, released the pin, and threw it up the stairs at the same time he looked away.  
  
  The stunning flash of light did not blind him, nor did the concussive sound paralyze him, since his helmet cushioned him from this effect.  
  
  The two men at the top of the stairs could not claim the same.  
  
  One tumbled down and landed at the bottom of the stairs.  
  
  One slash across the neck from the KM2000 severed two critical arteries, and Robie added another to his tally.  
  
  He reholstered the bloody blade.  
  
  Eight down, an equal number to go.  
  
  The other man slowly rose at the top of the stairs, but was obviously concussed. He then fell back down and lay unconscious. That was the only thing that saved his life.  
  
  That and two men attacking Robie from his right and left flanks.  
  
  The M11s came out, one in each hand. Robie aimed an M11 in each direction simultaneously and then trigger-pulled ten shots from each gun, sweeping up and down from chest to thigh, the arc of fire evenly spaced over a ten-foot radius. A kill zone field of fire delivered with max efficiency.  
  
  Jacketed rounds tore through flesh. These sounds were followed by two thumps, as corpses hit carpet.  
  
  Ten down, six to go.  
  
  Since the cat was definitely out of the bag, he sprayed the stairwell using the rest of his second mag on the UMP. He then raced up the steps, after reloading his M11s.  
  
  A bullet, fired from above, struck him in the abdomen.  
  
  The liquid armor vest he had on hardened within a millisecond, catching the round and wringing out virtually all of its kinetic energy by forcing it to be displaced along the breadth of the vest.  
  
  The armor then lost its rigidity and became flexible once more.  
  
  Robie had no idea who had invented this stuff, but if he survived tonight, he would buy the person a drink.  
  
  His second stun grenade flushed out the shooter. Robie shot him once in the knee with an M11 to incapacitate, then performed the kill shot to the head on the upper stairwell.  
  
  Eleven down, five to go.  
  
  He reached the upper hall, reholstered the M11, and reloaded the UMP with his final mag just as someone blindsided him. They tumbled back down the stairs. His attacker had a gutting knife and he managed to strike Robie in the thigh. His liquid armor once more seized up, and the knife didn’t even penetrate to the skin.  
  
  Robie’s right hand clamped down on the wrist with the knife. He torqued himself around so that he was on top when they slammed into the floor at the bottom of the stairs. The man beneath him was stunned by the impact but for only a second.  
  
  That was still a moment too long for survival.  
  
  Robie had used the man’s own knife to slit his throat. Arterial spray danced across his visor.  
  
  He hoped the handlers back in their safe space were enjoying the show.  
  
  It wasn’t nearly as much fun on his end.  
  
  Twelve down, four to go.  
  
  He rose, turned, and rolled out of the way as a volley of machine-gun fire blew down the stairs, ripping off part of the handrail, shredding the wall, and exploding a slew of the risers.  
  
  With his night vision, Robie could see where it was coming from.  
  
  Instead of trying to attack back up the stairs, he moved to his left, where the upper part of the stairway was partially covered by the wall rising from the lower floor.  
  
  He pointed the UMP at a forty-five-degree angle up and five clicks to the left. He pressed the trigger and fired half his mag. The ACP rounds blasted through the cheap drywall. Robie counted to three and watched as the shooter’s body rolled down the stairs and landed at the bottom and on top of the gent who’d had his throat slit by Robie.

[https://openai.com/chatgpt/search-product-discovery/](https://openai.com/chatgpt/search-product-discovery/)

Users come to ChatGPT with all kinds of questions, and one common topic is researching and buying products. Now, when a user query suggests shopping intent (e.g., “I’m looking to buy costumes for my two dogs”), ChatGPT can display relevant product options in visually rich carousels, provide additional product details, and link users to websites where they can learn more or make a purchase - available in GPT-4o and 4o-mini.

ChatGPT now includes product recommendations as part of its search experience. When a user query implies shopping intent, such as “gifts for someone who loves cooking” or “best noise-cancelling headphones under $200”, ChatGPT may surface relevant products.

*Product results are chosen independently and are not ads.* [*Learn more.*⁠(opens in a new window)](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11128490)

Any website or merchant can appear in ChatGPT search. To help ensure your content can be discovered, surfaced, and clearly cited and linked, follow these guidelines:

# 1. Ensure you haven’t opted out of OpenAI’s search crawler.

Like search engines, ChatGPT uses a web crawler called `OAI-SearchBot` to find, access, and surface information in ChatGPT search. For your site to be discoverable in ChatGPT, make sure you aren't blocking OAI-SearchBot. If necessary, you may need to update your `robots.txt` file, to ensure OAI-SearchBot has access.

Publishers who allow OAI-SearchBot to access their content can track referral traffic from ChatGPT using analytics platforms such as Google Analytics. ChatGPT automatically includes the UTM parameter `utm_source=chatgpt.com` in referral URLs, enabling clear tracking and analysis of inbound traffic from ChatGPT search results.

*OAI-SearchBot is for search. OAI-SearchBot is used to link to and surface websites in search results in ChatGPT's search features. It is not used to crawl content to train OpenAI’s generative AI foundation models.* [*Learn more*⁠(opens in a new window)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/bots)*.*

Products are selected by ChatGPT independently and are not ads.

# How Product Results are Selected

A product appears in the visual carousel when ChatGPT perceives it’s relevant to the user’s intent. ChatGPT assesses intent based on the user’s query and other available context, such as memories or custom instructions.

*Learn more about memory* [*here*](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8590148-memory-faq) *and custom instructions* [*here*](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8096356-custom-instructions-for-chatgpt)*.*

For example, if a user asks ChatGPT for help finding goofy costumes for their two large dogs, ChatGPT will consider general factors, such as price, customer ratings, and ease of use, as well as specific criteria provided by the user, like sizing and the desired costume vibe. If the user had previously indicated a dislike for clowns, the model might also consider that and leave out clown costumes.

Since the model interprets user intent, it can occasionally make mistakes—for example, maybe the user would have been open to clown costumes after all. Users can clarify their preferences and ask ChatGPT to adjust its response.

When determining which products to surface, ChatGPT considers:

* Structured metadata from third-party providers (e.g., price, product description) and other third-party content (e.g., reviews). [Learn more](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9237897-chatgpt-search).
* Model responses generated by ChatGPT before it considers any new search results. [Learn more](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7842364-how-chatgpt-and-our-foundation-models-are-developed)*.*
* OpenAI safety standards. [Learn more](https://openai.com/safety/).

Depending on the user’s needs, some of these factors will be more relevant than others. For example, if the user specifies a budget of $30, ChatGPT will focus more on price, whereas if price isn’t important, it may focus on other aspects instead.

Keep in mind that not all available products will necessarily be shown (there are a lot of dog costumes out there). We recommend verifying that products meet your specific needs before purchasing.

# Product Descriptions, Labels, Reviews, and Ratings

ChatGPT may generate simplified product titles and descriptions based on information it receives from third-party providers to make results easier to read, since merchants often use varying titles and descriptions for the same product.

Some product images may include feature labels, like “Budget-friendly” or “Most popular.” These labels are generated by ChatGPT based on information available to the model, which may include third party data. They’re not guarantees or verified statements, and may not reflect all available market data. For example, a “Budget-friendly” label might mean that reviewers frequently mention good value, not necessarily that it’s the lowest price available.

ChatGPT may also display product review summaries. These model-generated summaries are based on reviews from public websites and are intended to highlight common user likes and dislikes about a product. Some products may include a star rating and counts, which are provided by third party providers and may be aggregated into an overall rating that does not match the rating available on any particular website. Users can click provided links to view certain sources of these ratings.

Reviews and rating are not verified by OpenAI.

# Pricing

Product listings shown by ChatGPT may include prices, which we receive from third-party providers. After clicking on that price, users may see additional pricing options from other merchants who also offer that product.

Prices shown in ChatGPT’s initial response typically reflect the price from the first merchant listed, which may not be the lowest available price.

When merchants update their pricing or shipping terms, there may be some delay before it is reflected in the information you see, and sometimes estimated taxes and delivery fees may differ from what they ultimately are. We apologize for any inaccuracies and are actively working on faster methods to update this information. If you spot an error, please let us know by submitting feedback (instructions below).

# How Merchants Are Selected

When a user clicks on a product, we may show a list of merchants offering it. This list is generated based on merchant and product metadata we receive from third-party providers. Currently, the order in which we display merchants is predominantly determined by these providers. We do not re-rank merchants based on factors such as price, shipping, or return policies. We expect this to evolve as we continue to improve the shopping experience.

To that end, we’re exploring ways for merchants to provide us their product feeds directly, which will help ensure more accurate and current listings. If you're interested in participating, complete the interest form [here](http://openai.com/chatgpt/search-product-discovery), and we’ll notify you once submissions open.",1,1750126422.0,ThinkingDeeplyAI,0,1.0,False
1ldbime,https://www.reddit.com/r/vce/comments/1ldbime/til_you_shouldnt_down_20_bottles_of_dare_iced/,TIL You shouldnt down 20 bottles of dare iced coffee before attending the GAT,"Today i learned you should never down 20 bottles of Dare Iced Coffee (Specifcally Double Espresso) before attending the GAT.

I decided to stop by woolies in the morning before walking to school, and grabbed about 30 bottles of iced coffee to hand out to everyone before the GAT actually starts.

Anyways, i got to school, handed out about 10 bottles before being left with about 20 giant bottles of Dare in my school bag. I, being the incredibly intelligent individual i am, grabbed every single one of them out and downed them all in one sip each. I did so very orderly, very intense, and i felt incredible afterwards.

I walked into the room where the GAT was to occur, sat down at my seat, and waited for writing time to begin. During reading time, i could feel my heart racing, like it was going to literally jump out of my chest and run around the room. Pretty weird feeling, if im being honest

So then writing time began, and before the nice old VCAA lady could explain anything else, id already finished writing about why that community centre could benefit from a jewellery making workshop, and before anyone could really pick up their pens and start actually writing anything, id already sent my application for volunteer work at the community centre...and started a fire.

The friction of the pen i was using was so much that it literally set my paper on fire, and had spread to the carpet of the floor. i was too locked in on those multiple choice questions though, and carried on while about a hundred poor souls ran past me in fear.

i ended up finishing the whole thing with about 25 minutes until i was able to leave, in which case the fire had already spread to the rest of the building which had already lost a lot of its essential structural integrity.

I walked out, as anyone would, went down to the library to wait for section B to start, and then got called in by the cops.

Long story short, im gonna be appearing in the supreme court in september for about 30 charges of arson. Good thing i do legal studies.


tl;dr i burnt down a whole section of my school and am facing about 25 years of imprisonment",14,1750126390.0,vce,3,0.94,False

I don’t know what to do,"I work in an Art Gallery / Cafe. It’s just me. There is a Saturday girl but she is in school so can’t work weekdays. I started this job and it was fine, fun almost. Now 6 months in I don’t know how I feel or if I’m right to feel this way.

I cannot take weekdays off at all, sometimes not even weekends, as there is nobody to cover me. My boss runs another business and travels a lot. I took this job on knowing that but not fully realising the full capacity of it. I can’t take a week off to visit people/travel, ONLY weekends. I need to pick my friend up from airport next Thursday, but probably can’t as the store cannot close. 

I’m expected to run the gallery: Plan exhibitions, find artists and deal with all artists, organize payments, organize all social media’s, etc etc etc. everything from admin to planning to physical, all of it plus the extras my bosses decide they want. My boss will get the general idea of the exhibition, tell me, and I do the rest. Literally all of it. 

I do the cafe, work it myself everyday. Make all coffee/food, order for it, keep it clean, etc. 

By themselves it’s fine, trying to run a gallery while a morning coffee rush is happening is chaos. Not to mention I’m ONLY pay for 6:00am - 12:00pm. NO overtime ever. I get an extra 2hr each week to make up for working 1 Saturday a month & 1 art opening night a month. 

We just had a HUGE show, the planning that went into it was crazy. I spent maybe 12-15 hours of overtime on it in 1 week. No payment. I ran myself to the bone. I can never ever stay on top of everything and something is always behind and I am always reminded of what’s behind. If I want to truly stay on task 24/7, I need an extra 1-2hr a day. But I won’t be paid. 

My bosses are quite good though in terms of getting along. They’re super nice and funny, and they give me lots of free rein.

I make $700aud a week to do all of this ($450usd) I do ANOTHER job on top to help bills and it’s just running me dry.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I’m just in a mood and burnt out and being unreasonable, or if it’s genuinely a lot. Help and advice pls lol

1ldbdoc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ldbdoc,"Book Review: Guide Book/All About Them 2, 3 and 4.","No, I haven't been able to find #1. These buggers are elusive xD

Unlike most other of the books, these aren't pocket format. They are full on A4 sized. Almost the same as the original comics. Except the outer parts are plastic, not paper. Like a pocket. They contain a mix of unique, original art made for these specifically. And comic art. But they have a surprising amount of unique art.

Anyhow: These are basically a mix of everything. They have information on each girl. They have short stories from each girl's perspective. They have random horoscopes and such. They have random DIY tips like the magazines. It references events from the comics. And... it has random mythology stories. It's a rather peculiar mix.

Guide 2:

1: The Aurameres braclet. This is the story of the nymph Xin Jing. Told from the perspective of Hay Lin's mom telling it to her. Ending with her giving her a bracelet with the auramere symbols.

2: The leather hat. A story about Taranee and her brother. Taranee complains that Heatherfield is much colder than where they come from. Peter wanders around town, and as he is about to purchase some new pants, he spots a very specific hat. And decides to ""protect his sister"" by getting it for her. This is the red one with ""ears"" we see her wear. Amusingly, this specific type of hat is known as a "">!bear pussy!<"" in Scandinavia.

3: Hay Lin (An entire page about Hay Lin. This is what I expected in the ""All About"" books.)  
""What is strongest in the storm? The mighty oak, or the humble reed?"" - Hay Lin  
Hay Lin has long, dark hair. A smiling face, beautiful almond shaped eyes, and she is slim and slender.  
She is born the 4'th of june, she is a twins. Hay Lin is friendly and empathetic. She is a dreamer and has a tendency to be ditzy. It's why she often uses her hands as notepads.

She has a very special look. She combine the feminine with the original. She loves to spiff up her clothes with personal accessories. She is CRAZY about glasses. She prefers them a bit oversized and a bit different.  
She LOVES sci-fi and dreams about meeting an alien ""with antennas and everything!"". It's also why she says ""Spaced/Spacious!"" about things she likes. (Spaced out on what her term is in english, pun intended.)

She's in the same class as Taranee and Irma. Her favorite class is arts and crafts.  
Hay Lin has lived in Heatherfield her entire life. She is an only child, and lives with her parents in an apartment above her family's restaurant ""The Silver Dragon."", where she often helps out.  
She has a great relationship with her parents. And a VERY special friendship with her grandma, who currently ""lives"" at a very inaccessible place.

Hay Lin is the guardian of air. She can even fly! Her grandma was once the air guardian before her. She entrusted her with the map of the twelve portals.

4: Taranee.  
""It protects you from all the cold in the world, the heat from the sun... the heat from the fire... the heat from your heart..."" - Taranee  
Taranee Cook is born the 23'rd of march, she is an aries. She has dark, short hair and likes to decorate it with colorful pearls and straps.  
She is the most calm and shy of the girls, and she is very thoughtful. She has an incredible ability to tell what people in her vicinity needs. But look out! Behind her humble eyes \[concealed by her round glasses\] hides a fiery soul!

She is skilled at basketball, but her passion lies within photography. She sees her camera as part of her and she has real talent. She's scared to death of insects. Yet, still tries to catch them... on pictures.  
She's in the same class as Irma and Hay Lin, and her favorite class is math.

She loves warm colors and dresses very ethnically. Her room is filled with fun things. Cacti for example. And a giraff made out of coconut wood named Zu, a gift from her grandpa. She is very attached to it.  
She lives with her family. Big bro Peter, supersurfer. Her mother Theresa, a judge. And her father Lionel, former lawyer, currently prison psychologist.

Taranee can make anything smolder. She actually controls fire, the most unpredictable element. And just like fire: Taranee is calm until something **ignites** her. Then, she explodes and forgets all about being shy.

5: D as in Bad Grades  
Will and Irma offers advice on how to handle bad grades.  
Will's method: Wait until your mother is in a good mood, then STRIKE!  
Irma's method: Exploit their weakness of societal conventions. Wait until the neighbor is over or family visits. Since it's not acceptable to argue in front of guests, you are safe!  
Will's tips: Offer a list of things you can do to make up for it. Like: Clean your room for 3 months. Do the groceries for 4 months. Set the table for 5 months!  
Irma's strategy: Find someone your parents respect. Some elder, friends of the family. Then confess about how you don't know how to address the issue, and let them handle it. Just be aware that you'll generally need to offer some ""payment"" for their services. Such as chores or errands.  
And remember: Don't get angry if you get scolded. Show you are willing to learn. And be prepared to study more.

Some advice on how to help your friends if they are depressed. As well as a ""Depression First Aid Kit"", and how to judge if it's mild or serious. The advice is pretty superficial. But some of it is pretty good. Though, the ""extreme cure"" is bad. As it suggests giving them a literal pet.

8: T as in Tea  
A lot of tea talk. Including some magic talk (As in: Literal magic, how the WITCH girls like to use their powers to make tea, fun little flair.) And how to wash your hair with tea. How to scry with tea. How to make iced tea with whipped cream. And notably: Each girl's favorite tea:   
Hay Lin: Jasmin Tea, a chinese classic. She drinks it out of the literal fine china.   
Will: Spiced Tea. She adds a dash of cinnamon, vanilla and carnation. When it boils, add the tea and wait five minutes.   
Taranee: Green Tea. It should only cook for 2-3 minutes. It's very stimulating and relaxing. Can also be drunk at night.  
Cornelia: Mint Tea. TEA most refined of the girls, prefers this tea. It can be bought in bags or as dried leafs. Can be served in tea glasses.  
Irma: Orange Tea. Can be bought in bags. Irma drinks it by drowning it in sugar and dipping cookies in it.

9: B as in Bath  
Several tips of types of baths to take. Primarily from Irma. And specific advice from Irma: Find the right moment. Which is always. But THE best is before supper. Light some incense. And lots of white light. Soak in the positive energies. The water should be HOT. But not TOO hot. After the bath: Wipe yourself with a more coarse, rougher towel. It's almost like a massage. Helps you exfoliate. After that: Use a body lotion. But NOT if you have a fat complexion. Use face wash instead if so.

10: K as in Kandrakar's Heart  
It goes over the heart more. How it's Xin Jing's essence after her sacrifice against the Jade emperor. How Will is the current keeper. The powers that gives them ""cool outfits"", wings, able to turn invisible and empower the elemental magic. The weakness that like other hearts, it can break. And if they are far away or mad at each other, their powers vain. The secret power of the heart is friendship.

11: J like in Jeans  
They talk about jeans. The origin of jeans. How to decorate your jeans. Did we mention Cornelia is the most trendy?

More of the same.

14: The light of the night  
A story about some boy named ""Ainuk"". (Lowkey homoerotic... Has boys talk about how they wanna look at their reflection in their bro's oiled up abs.) It's a story of how earth got its moon.

Guide 3:

1: A belt that smells vacation  
A short story about Irma finding a belt she really likes. But, she has to modify it a bit with the help of Hay Lin to **really** like it. (The belt loops were placed very badly) And now, every time she wears it, she remembers the trip she found it on.

2: A new look for Will's cellphone  
A short story about how Will's phone (Nicknamed ""Backup mom"") complains about being neglected. The final straw being Will leaving the phone at the bottom of her bag with her wet underwear. Will then agrees to catsit Napoleon for a few days. And Napoleon does a 12 hit combo on Will's room when she's away. ""Murdering"" one of Will's frogs. Her phone then asks Will ""Would you love me if I was a frog?"" and Will then has a bright idea, and takes out  thread and needle, and makes a phone case out of the frog. And this makes Will able to care about her phone's feelings.

3: Irma  
""Your destiny was created written in water. Between raindrops and hidden tears."" - Irma  
Irma Lair has thick, chestnut colored hair that perfectly frames her slightly chubby face.  
She was born 13'th of march, she is a pisces. And she has a great sense of humor.  
She is unpredictable and acts on instinct, and sometimes goes too far as she doesn't consider the consequences of her actions. \[Or witty retorts\] But, her generosity and spontaneity has nearly anyone forgive her for anything. 

She is heavily affected by the weather. And when she's feeling really down, she tells Lettuce all of her secrets. Her beloved Lettuce, a turtle that lives in an aquarium in her room.  
She loves spending her afternoons lounging in her room and listening to Karmilla, the singer in her favorite band. She can become very desperate over her fashion style. \[Or lack thereof\] She can often be found in front of her wardrobe going ""Help! I have no idea what to wear!"".

She is in the same class as Taranee and Hay Lin. She **hates** all classes equally. Except **geography**.  
She lives in a small house with a garden with her family: Her father Tom, her mother Anna and her disgusting, irritating little shit of a brother. \[Cristopher\]

Irma has power over water! She can an amazing ability to control liquids, and she can control the waves of the ocean to her will. AND she can lay in water for hours without getting pruny.

4: Yan Lin  
""There are questions awaiting answers. And answers that do not care about the question."" - Yan Lin  
Her name is Yan Lin. Her age is unending. She is Hay Lin's grandma. She was a very devoted and protective mother to her son Chen, and she loves her grandchild deeply and sees a young version of herself in her.  
Her hair is white and long, like Hay Lin's. And her gaze is lively and sweet at the same time. She is intuitive and intelligent and has the gift of prophecy.

She dresses traditional chinese garbs that reach the floor. Comfortable socks, sandals and small, circular earrings. When she was young, she was a guardian. Together with Nerissa, Kadma, Halinor and Cassidy, she was part of the chosen group.  
She highly values memories and often said: ""Without memories, you are nothing."".  
She says that to withstand adversity, you must be flexible and docile. It is why she often repeats an old riddle: ""Which is stronger in a storm? The reed or the oak?""

Before she ""left"" this earth, she told WITCH about their mission. She entrusted the heart of Kandrakar in Will's care, and left Hay Lin the map of the twelve portals.  
Now the ""honorable Yan Lin"" lives in Kandrakar. And the Oracle keeps her in high regard. She keeps herself hidden in the chamber of memories.  
She still has contact with her grandchild, who often comes to visit in Kandrakar. She is WITCH's spiritual guide and is very happy that there is unity and solidarity between the girls.

5: S like in Slippers

7: S as in Swimming  
Random trivia and tips from Will about swimming and the sea. Like, the largest swimming animal. The (at the time) best swimmer in the world. And most importantly: What exercise to do to get a **tight** butt.

8: V like in wrath  
Talks about rage in general. And a personal advice from each girl.  
W: When I need to ""cool down"", the best I know is to go for a bike ride in the park. I keep going until I can barely breathe, and thus: Have no energy to be angry. Going for a dip also works. Twenty laps is usually enough.  
I: Some say when I get mad, I eat like a horse. Nonsense. The fact is: I ONLY eat a SINGLE packet of chocolate chip biscuits dipped in whipped cream. And AFTER, I go out and purchase some cookies. And when I come home: I tell my dairy everything that happened today... And THEN I use the most vile slurs and insults I can think of to describe the people that pissed me off!  
T: Everyone always says that I'm the pinnacle of calm. But: Once I ACTUALLY get mad: I go nuclear. I lock myself on my room and turn up the heat. One time I was so angry that I tore several pictures to pieces. I'll never forget how hard it was to find similar ones.  
C: When I get mad, I lock myself in my room. The SLAM is a clear sign I do not wish to talk. Then, once I calm down: I go out shopping. ALONE.  
H: When someone makes me lose my temper: I doodle very unflattering sketches of them. And put them up at strategic locations where everyone can see. One time I was mad at the waiter, so I put his caricature on the kitchen doors.

9: T like in bags  
Just the girls talking about bags. Like how Corny loves her shoulder bag. (One huge weird choice, is that Taranee is the one talking about backpacks in this one. Granted, she mentions how you can ""make it yours"" with DIY and accessories. But Will is left to talk about how she loves belt pouches. Which: A recurring thing in the ""Secret WITCH books"" is how Will LOVES to talk about how pants and backpacks are our lord and savior. And also how she HATES bras.)

10: P as in pushy boys  
Primarily Irma ranting about Martin. With... some unethical advice. As the two advice's are literally ""Use him for dinner. Once you make him pay a few times without reward: He should cool off."" and ""Tell him you're busy, that your mom won't let you go until you've done chores. And: If he offers to help: Jackpot... put him to work and lean back.""

11: F like in moving  
Some advice on how to deal with having to move to a new town. (There is a funny ""PS"" that: Despite never having moved. Irma INSISTED on adding her two cents. Which is the following: ""A bonus of no-one knowing you, is that you can change your style. Become more of a fem fatale, add some nail polish\~""

12: B like in Glasses  
The girls talk about glasses. And whether you are a ""M"" (wears ""glasses"" due to fashion) type or a ""P"" (wears glasses due to necessity) type.

13: Breath of the wind | Love magic  
Some more wiccan stuff.

14: Year of the WITCH  
Same.

Last page has a cute picture of Will with some frogs and her phone. (Not the frog phone, sadly)

Guide 4:  
1: A work of art  
A story on how Irma is a messy glutton. And her mom gets so tired of Irma being a slob, so she gets plastic covers for the table. As Irma always goes ""I'll fix it when I get home!"" and never does. This upset Irma, and she did her best to stain the covers each morning. Writing slurs and curses on them. After weeks, Irma turned to Hay Lin for help. And she covered the covers with drawings. (This fixed everything for some reason.)

2: A present with... gloves  
Hay Lin is wondering what to get her parents for their anniversary. It's snowing and she has an idea of a drawing... And Irma is also here for some reason. (Yes, it literally specifies that xD)  
It's cold, so Hay Lin has issues drawing. Irma suggests that she ""dips her tiny sausage fingers in her warm tea every now and then"". Hay Lin fails to draw. Irma starts to scheme. And gets the other girls ""save up"" (lowkey implied to take time, yet is the next day?) to purchase ""special gloves"" for Hay Lin. (They are specified as ""allowing finger movements"".) Then, Irma hands her a gift of the gloves, Hay Lin manages to draw. And everything worked out.

3: Elyon  
""Meridian's light shines once again upon us, and no-one will ever snuff it out again!"" - Elyon  
Elyon was born the 31'th october, she is a scorpio.

After many setbacks and suffering, and with the help of WITCH, especially Cornelia, Elyon managed to defeat Phobos. And now: As the daughter to Meridian's last queen, it is her turn to rule.  
She goes dressed royally and wears Meridian's Light with reverence,  and she has brought peace and prosperity to Meridian's citizens.  
Elyon has strong magical powers: She can control materia along with releasing strong energy bursts.

Eric has dark eyes filled with life and are very deep... like a night sky full of stars! He has a very open and sympathetic face, framed by a black and wild hair.  
He isn't especially muscular, but he is cute and smart. And he has an adorable smile. He doesn't have any troubles making friends.

Behind his reserved and shy exterior, hides a pure genius. He knows the names of all stars and planets, plays basket and is multilingual.  
He dresses very relaxed like all smart people, he doesn't care about fashion! He prefer to wear jeans and sporty shirts.  
His best friend is his grandpa, Professor Zacharia Lyndon, a very distinguished astronomer. It is from his Eric got his fascinations with celestial bodies.

Eric has moved several times. You could assume that he is just visiting Heatherfield temporarily, but... it seems as if his parents plan to stay long term.  
He met Hay Lin a summer afternoon. You could say that she was his carry-on. Her bag-strap got caught at the luggage space of his moped, and when she fell, she spilled ice cream all over his t-shirt! The aftermath? Love!  
Their first... almost kiss? It was a night with a thousand shooting stars! How romantic can it be?

5: F like in shocking remarks  
""Irma, our local pest. We mean: Jokester.""  
It's two pages of Irma's PG rated burns and remarks. (It's similar to ""WITCH cackle"" from the secret books. Though honestly, none of them are very good. Like, one specifically aimed at her friends is ""So... wanna forgive me or kill me? Either way, get it over with."")

6: B as in brother  
Taranee discussing the pros and cons of having a brother. Ending with ""Everyone likes him. **Especially** Cornelia.""

7: K as in correct cellphone behavior  
Basically a short ""cellphone etiquette"" section. Amusingly relevant to chatting today.

8: T as in T-shirt  
Short history of the t-shirt, and discussing shirts. And a DYI on how to stylize your own.

9: H as in best friends/""lovefriends"" (Basically a ""I'll always keep you in my heart.)  
They talk about Elyon and Cornelia. And give basic advice on ""Do's and dont's"" with close friends.

10: M like in breakfast  
They talk some about the origin of breakfast around the world. Give some ""suggestions"". Along with list what each girl normally eats.

Magical müsli à la Irma: If you want to murder your teeth, here is my special recipe: Rolled oats, grain kernels, cornflakes, rice crispies, hazelnuts, almonds, walnuts, raisins, pineapple, apricots and shredded coconut. Mix with orange juice or milk, add some slices of banana, kiwi, apple or pear and sugar or honey. (This may be the worst crime Irma has done to date.)  
Sugaregg à la Will: Take an egg \[WITHOUT salmonella\] and whisk it with sugar until it becomes fluffy. Then, add a dash of coffee\~ (It is implied Will is too lazy to make this herself.)

Morning rituals: Will listens to the news on the radio. Irma turns on music. Taranee gazes out her window. Cornelia does her hair. And Hay Lin plays with bells she's had since she was little.

W: Will starts her day with a glass of milk and a croissant. And if she's feeling down, her mom usually makes her a fried egg on toast. It usually helps.  
I: Irma is bottomess. Once she emerges, she consumes large quantities of cereal, milk and sugar.  
T: Taranee loves crust with cherry jam, that she dips in milk.  
C: Cornelia has a very refined and dignified breakfast consisting of yogurt and fruit.  
H: Hay Lin used to LOVE this breakfast consisting primarily of apple slices... When her grandma was alive. No-one else knew the recipe. Nowadays she mostly has rice crispies with soy milk and honey.

11: M as in mask  
Instructions on how to make a mask. With specific mask tips from Cornelia and Irma. (A sun mask, and a ""silly"" one respectively.)

12: H is for secrets  
A short breakdown about how to treat secrets. And a joke advice on a ""secret concoction to keep secrets"", consisting on stuff such as 1 kg of concentration and 8 liters of restraint.

13: Wish puzzel  
Basically a wiccan DYI puzzle.

14: A tie to earth | Birthday present  
More wiccan stuff. Like, how to plant a flower using the earth from the location you got your first kiss.

Final thoughts: I liked these a lot. Well, the wiccan stuff was a bit weird, even considering the usual astronomy they use. As they never leaned that hard into it until these. Still a good mix of basically all other books. And they **actually** have an ""all about"" section. Though, a bit weird we don't get the astronomy info of the other characters, with how present it is.",6,1750125977.0,GuardiansOftheVeil,0,1.0,False

1ldb9k5,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ldb9k5/foolish_enough_to_do_it_again/,Foolish enough to do it again,"There are days when the heartbreak is so visceral, I feel as though I will never know anything but this pain and sadness. Days where it takes everything in me just to lift my body out of bed. Days when I drive somewhere but can’t remember the route I took. Evenings when I crumble into bed fully clothed, not because I want to, but because I can’t manage to do anything else.

Some days, the tears don’t stop running until I develop a headache so painful, my body has no choice but to shut down into sleep. Other days, I find myself lying on the couch and losing hours to my tiny, glowing screen—watching meaningless clips, one after another, until I am finally numb enough to find the strength to walk upstairs… only to return to my bed.

But then, there are days like today.

Today, my alarm went off at 6:15am. The warm summer air came drifting through my open window. Trigger was already curled up beside me, waiting for affection, as always. And even though I was groggy, I stood up and felt something different. A lightness. A quiet joy. I moved through the house like I belong here.

Because I do. This is my house.

I showered. I made coffee. I played with the pup in the backyard, listened to music, and got ready. And at some point, I paused, looking at myself in the mirror and was reminded. 

Six months ago, I was curled up on a semi-deflated air mattress in my younger sister’s apartment in New York City. I was dressed in clothes I had worn for four days straight. I hadn’t eaten and my eyes were swollen from crying. I was freezing, teeth chattering on and off, trapped in a haze of desperation and disbelief. I thought I was going to die. 

I have come a long way.

I am proud of how far I’ve come… and at the same time, I am consumed by a strange, secondary layer of grief. The reality that one day, even this pain won’t be sharp anymore. I won’t be an exception to the physics of humanity. Everything is cyclical. Time and change will cause this ache to dull. Yet the idea that, one day, I won’t care about this painful experience is, in a way, even sadder than the idea that I always will. Whether I am ready or not, I will eventually move on. These feelings will fade and in some twisted way that makes me want to cherish the sadness that I feel. 

I don’t want to not miss her.  

Not because I want to stay here, but because this ache feels like the only proof that what I experienced was real. That I loved her with a depth I didn’t know I was capable of. That I cared. That I still care. 

I don’t recognize myself when I look in the mirror. I feel like a shell of myself. This ending has shattered everything… and in its wake everything inside me and around me is shifting. It’s terrifying. 

The current of life is pulling me forward. Despite all the pain, grief, confusion, and anger I feel now the truth is-

I will still wake up tomorrow morning

I will still work in my garden

I will still 

I’ll laugh and I’ll cry

And one day, I will even be foolish enough to love someone in this same way again.

1ldb95v,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ldb95v/six_months_or_so/,Six Months or So,"I stopped caffeine in the beginning of January this year. I did it in attempt to reduce sugar cravings as in December I quit loading on dry fruit every evening, which was my drug at the time. Someone told me that caffeine addiction pulls sugar addiction and they are best to be done with together. 

After I quit caffeine, me sleep went down the drain for quite prolonged period. Also my heart rate became elevated, my HRV tanked. My deep sleep became pitiful, often less than thirty minutes. My overall sleep length was shy of seven hours on most of the nights and some nights 5-6 hours. 

Sugar cravings were tamed for the most part, but still hitting me hard once a month so I could not resist eating cake. I got gcm and observed my sugar story and it was not very inspiring. 95% of time I was eating below 20-30 grams of carbs (with once a month cake deviation), some days I fasted. While my sugar looked normal after two weeks of low carb or a day or two of fasting, I observed a crazy reaction to carbs. Seemingly benign things spiked me - carrots, berries. I did not like it. 

Also, my classes of hot yoga had a bad effect on my blood sugar. Hiking was fine. 

I developed a fear of carbs and was consuming nuts, cheese, heavy cream periodically, salads made of raw veggies with olive oil… 

Yes, sleep was garbage. I was five months in but my sleep was worse than ever. Apple Watch reports me %Recovery (primarily based on HRV) overnight and I was consistently seeing 14-20% with 40% on my lucky day. Gone were times of 80-90%! 

And then I developed a satanic craving for any drug! Most of all, I craved alcohol. I was nearing one year sober and this craving hit me like a ton of bricks. 🧱 
I knew I wasn’t going to act on this craving but boy, oh boy - this lasted for longer than a week. Non stop. I wanted also cake, ice cream, whatever drugs there are! After work I used to drive to the park and sit on the bench until the wave of cravings would subside. Did I mention I also craved black tea, chocolate and coffee? I was all over the place!! And then I made one compromise: I drank decaf. Yes, I know there is caffeine in it. But after 8 days of torturous cravings I knew I am not going to last forever. I knew my priority not to drink alcohol. I did not want to eat cake anymore due to blood sugar. So decaf was my drug of choice. How did it go? 

It stopped the nightmare of all cravings. It brought joy to me as I failed to love teas. It did not give me anxiety, palpitations, or any other crazy sensations I used to have when drinking coffee. If I do not drink decaf, I do not have a headache. I do not feel addicted to it and I do not want caffeine. I have zero desire for chocolate. I can drink decaf at 9pm and go to sleep right away. 

Now the crazy part. With decaf back in my life, it became clear to me that I eat too much fat. I do not know how it is connected but somehow it was connected. With decaf coffee back in my life I just tasted too much fat in my diet: all this oil, nuts, cream, cheese… I cut it out. Instead I added berries, more veggies and low cal ice cream for fun. IMMEDIATELY, the same night after my low fat high fiber day I slept like a baby! My deep sleep time doubled if not tripled. It is more than one hour now. My overall sleep time increased from 6.5 hours to 7.5 hours. My %Recovery is again 80-90%! 

And I am losing weight as I got rid of perpetual fat bombing! 

My experience is not what I planned, but I can’t complain. 

Do I qualify as caffeine-free? No. But so far I am problem-free. And I do not observe growing consumption of decaf. Rather the opposite. ",1,1750125617.0,decaf,0,0.67,False

Most days, I’d shuffle to the coffee shop near my apartment, half-asleep, earbuds in, avoiding eye contact. But last week, something broke the routine.

I was in line, zoning out, when the guy in front of me turned around. Older, maybe 60, with a grin like he knew a secret. “You look like you need a coffee more than me,” he said, chuckling. I mumbled something awkward, but he kept talking—about the weather, his dog, how he used to hate mornings too. Normally, I’d brush it off, but his energy was contagious.

When he got to the counter, he paid for my coffee. Just like that. “Pass it on when you can,” he said, then grabbed his drink and left. I stood there, stunned, holding my free latte. It wasn’t just the coffee—it was the reminder that small gestures can jolt you awake, literally and figuratively.

That morning, I smiled at the barista. I held the door for someone. I even texted a friend I’d been meaning to reconnect with. One stranger’s kindness flipped my whole day. Maybe it’s cheesy, but it made me want to be that person for someone else. Anyone else had a random act of kindness shake up their routine?",91,1750125428.0,Life,8,0.98,False

I’m looking for someone witty, grounded, and curious — someone who enjoys banter, can dish it back with a smile, and doesn’t mind if things get just a little flirty now and then. No pressure, no games — just authentic connection and a vibe that feels effortless.

Maybe we swap stories, movie recs, or guilty pleasures (I’ll go first: I judge people by their pizza toppings but I do it lovingly). Maybe it turns into something more. Maybe we just make each other’s day a bit brighter.

Back in 2022, I (f,22) started dating a guy (25) and things were good. I was at his home almost every week, I've met his family, i even went on a mini vacation with him, his sister, and her boyfriend. Around August 2022 I started to become suspicious of him because he would follow random girls from nearby colleges but I never brought it up. Instead, the day before his family members wedding that he invited me to,,, I downloaded tinder with a faceless profile just to see if I saw him on there and guess what, the next morning I went to check and there he was! We got into this whole thing but I ended up going to the wedding with him, and we ended up staying together. After that though is when our relationship started going downhill, I felt like I was always looking for something and that's probably because there was always something to find. I know I shouldve left, I just felt like I wanted to be with him so badly that I couldnt leave. Anyways, fast foward to the month of November 2022 when I found out the biggest secret he's been hiding and that's the fact that he on multiple occasions, was knowingly having sex with 15/16 year old girls. Mind you, this is all taking place in Jersey where the legal age of consent is 16. November 3rd, 2022, I spent the night at his home and we had planned for me to come back the next day once he got off of work. Novemeber 4th I hung out in Manhattan alllll day waiting for him to finish, just for him to tell me that he is throwing up, and that he isnt feeling good so I shouldnt come tonight. At this point I was annoyed because I felt like (now I know my feelings were valid) he was purposefully flaking on me and waited until the last minute to tell me. Now to how I found out. I found out because he had blocked me on instagram (on sunday nov 13, remember this) but then unblocked me but we never followed eachother again. I was able to see the suggested profiles of the girls he was following while I was no longer his friend on Instagram and I noticed one girl had her photos geotagged in Whitehead NJ. That was about an hour from where my boyfriend lived (remember this too). My boyfriend was a chef at mangia toscano in NJ and would always tell me how/when he will be hanging out with his coworkers after work, and he would always tell me when he was leaving work early. We also had eachothers location. Well this Sunday, he didnt tell me he was leaving early and I just saw him driving south. It was around 7:30pm and he texts me and tells me he and his coworkers are going to play pool and that theyre driving to the place. That was an automatic red flag in my eyes because it was getting closer to 8pm and it was a sunday night, and his location seemed too far out of the way just for a place to shoot pool. He kept driving until he reached Whitehead NJ and kept circling around this one area until he stopped. I called him, he didnt answer but he wanted to text me. He told me me he was at his boss's friends home and was waiting for his boss to get in the car so they can go play pool, and that he would call me when he gets back to his car (he wanted me to believe he left his car at work...). I go on instagram to take a look at the one girls tagged location again and this man was on the same street as the tagged location. I immediately started calling and texting him and he eventually blocked my number so I went to text his coworker to ask if anyone has heard from him. Turns out, no one went to go play pool and the reason my boyfriend left early was to ""pick his parents up from the airport'. His parents had been back from their trip for atleast 3 days at this point so that was a lie. I told the coworker what he was really up to and that I need to get in contact with him or his parents will be involved. Sure enough, right after I sent that, I mesaged his mom to tell her what her son was doing and I sent her proof as well. Then he calls me telling me how he wasnt doing anything wrong and how I am taking things too far as if he wasnt just on a dead end street with a 15 year year old for the past 30 minutes. The next day, Novemeber 14th is when I start reaching out to the other profiles that were suggested under his profile and turns out they were all 15/16, in highschool, and were under the impression that he was 17 about to turn 18 BECAUSE THATS WHAT HE TOLD THEM. I've never felt so sick in my life once I started to hear about what he was saying to these girls in order for them to meet. I then made a facebook account with his photos and included all the screenshots of what I knew at the time. I added all of the family members i could remember meeting at the wedding, to this account and I even messaged some letting them know that their cousin was a pedo and that something should be done. Also, while Im doing this, he was still in contact with one of the girls and she wanted to try and set him up but at that point, he didnt trust her. Hours go by and I get a message on facebook and it was a 16yr old girl who told me she was with him the night he pretended to be sick. She said he picked her up, smoked, went back to his home and had sex. She said the second time (a different day) they had sex is when he told her he was 20 and not 18. He blocked her on snapchat shortly after. She didnt find out his real age until a week later when I made that facebook account exposing him and that made me so upset. I was even more upset that I went to the Old Bridge Police Department which was conveniently 3 minutes away from my boyfriends house, and they couldnt help unless the girl came to the station with her guardian but she didnt want her parents to know so nothing happened. I also found out that he was lying about having friends. The friend group he used to be close with stopped talking to him because he was constantly lying to them and he even tried to hangout with a 15yr old back then too. The whole friend group at one point worked at a restaurant and the 15yr old hostess told one his friends the situation and they slowly started to stay away from him. He would tell me how he was going to get coffee with one of these friends (the one i got in contact with) and I just cant help but wonder who he was seeing for real. To this day I still get messages here and there asking if the facebook page is real and why am I doing all of this. I'm doing ""all of this"" because it's what i would want someone else to do when they know someone is an abuser. I'm still so upset about it all, and I dont think ill ever get over it fully and part of me thinks it happened for a reason. I wonder what wouldve happened if Ieft when i saw his tinder account? Why didnt i leave then? IDK i feel like something in me knew that he was off, or maybe thats just what i started telling myslef to cope, idk. He's a chef in Miami now at Mirabella and I'm tempted to reach out to his coworkers there and the head chef but realistically, that wont make things better.",1,1750125211.0,u_seekingsolace27,0,1.0,False

I started with the low dose phentermine and it did nothing. I then went to 37.5, which I split in 2. Once in the morning, once at noon. The first week, I barely slept, completed 30-40 tasks a day, big, small, giant, medium, my brain and body didn’t stop. Now that I’m settled in, my antidepressant is no longer working. The past week, I’ve been getting less and less outgoing and barely noticed. My son asked me what was up (mind you, I was very mentally and emotionally well before I started this round). Anyway, I realized, I just feel sad. I don’t want to go anything, I have no motivation, I’m starting to not care about anything. Today I drank a coffee and ate some almonds. I’m calling my doctor first thing, to discuss going off it and I’m done. My mental and emotional well-being is much more important to me. ",6,1750125074.0,PhentermineTopiramate,4,1.0,False

And a lot more appreciation for the simple blessing of a bed, 4 walls and a roof

Over the weekend I ended up stranded in a big city for reasons with no access to funds other than $50 in my pocket; spent a couple nights on the street. In that short time I learned which coffee shops would let me charge my phone and which would shoo me away, where I could lie down at night without getting hassled and where it's too cold when the wind comes whipping through.   
  
I had a young woman approach me and ask if I had any meth; I am pretty sure if I had said yes she would've offered sex in exchange. We talked a little. She didn't seem ""crazy"" or anything; she's just a person who ended up addicted to a bad substance. I got her something to eat and wished her well. 

An older gentleman had a little tent that he slept in, just outside a kind of fancy-looking restaurant in the plaza. I guess he has some kind of arrangement with them because it's clearly his spot, and when staff showed up in the morning to start prep they exchanged a greeting as he began packing up. I wondered how he came to this situation, and then I wondered when and where he gets to shower. He looked surprisingly not-disheveled. I admired the small ways he has managed to hold onto some outward-facing dignity.

I know I got only the slightest taste of what those without homes live through 24/7/365, and it was one of the most challenging couple nights of my life. And this was in a pretty safe part of town, and I had some money. I could go to chipotle, eat something nutritious and loiter for the rest of the day. Better than some.   
  
I also became keenly aware of the social privilege associated with appearance; I doubt I would have been allowed to do this if my hair was uncombed and my jeans were visibly stained and old--like some of the people who joined me at the one local pizzeria that stays open until 3am. I appreciated the kid who singlehandedly ran the front of house there; despite his youthful appearance, he clearly understood the importance of this space to those who have nowhere else to go, and was as chill as possible about using the bathroom or hanging around for hours after ordering a single $4 slice. These small kindnesses make a big difference when you are out of resources.   
  
Those who have the least do not deserve our condemnation or disgust. They deserve compassion and a second, or third, or fourth chance. If we could be more collectively focused on uplifting the most beleaguered among us, I believe we would all benefit. 

Last night I made it home and slept in my bed again. When my head hit the pillow I just started crying and it took a good while to stop. I'll never take it for granted again.",58,1750125072.0,self,42,0.78,False

I’m originally from New York City. I’ve lived in practically all the boroughs and have grown up in the Church. Although I’ve grown up in the Church, it isn’t untill 10 years ago that I began to diligently seek the truth, give my life to Christ and grow spiritually. My walk with Christ has had it’s up and downs but I’ve now come to a place of full surrender. Also, I feel like I’ve been called to intercessory prayer so if anyone needs help and/or partnership in that area, I know I do, this could be potentially for you. I trust that God will lead this message to the right woman in New York City to sharpen my iron. There’s a lot of Christ and God being plastered around and being spoken about but without the spirit and the power to change. I’m a Christian interested in the seeing that change. Iron sharpens iron and it isn’t easy to build community in the biggest city in the world. If you’re also a Christian woman that believes in the Holy Spirit and also genuinely like to have a good time, join me!

Summer is coming and I’m excited to test my faith by starting this. The mission of this group is to create a faith forward community for Christian women in NYC to grow friendships, experience joy, and explore the city together. Our motto is pray hard, play hard.

Examples of activities I like to do in the city: Floral Arrangement classes, Hot girl walks through the many parks/boardwalks in the city, dance class, tennis, pickle ball, healthy food, sports games, picnics, cooking classes, coffee, kombucha, fitness classes, painting, any art thing, DIY, reading, shopping and/or thrift shopping, creative journaling, and more. I’m open to suggestions on things to do as well!

If you’re interested in joining please register here for our first meet up June 28th!

1ldb0qy,https://www.reddit.com/r/persona4revival/comments/1ldb0qy/what_are_the_changes_and_additions_in_p4r/,What are the changes and additions in P4R?,"What do you hope to see the new additions and changes in P4R?

\- Full Dialogues: 

If we follow the steps in P3R, full dialogue is a good improvement over the original P3. In the original P4, the full dialogues for SL are when they are at final rank or story. But just like in P3R, they given full dialogues to the SL. Not only that, their mouths are moving when they speaking, this is shown great improvement in P3R because it shows some emotions to the characters. 

\- New Social Links

SL for Aika, the delivery food girl. Aika Nakamura was never seen in P4 games, but was seen in P4 animations. Since her character is delivering food and she can be seen anywhere,and she is shown seems expressionless, I am curious to see how they implement her SL to the story. Of course we will be seeing Marie from the Golden as one of the SL. And then Yumi and Ayane, you can only do one of their SL in the game since they both are Sun. So, maybe in P4R we can do both of them now. 

\- Linked Episode

After P3R, I think I like the Linked Episodes more. We no longer need SL for male party members, but instead we will get to have something similar to Linked Episodes. 

\- Exploring in the house

I would like to see that I can explore around the house, going inside his room, hallway, to the kitchen, outside the house, back of the house, etc. And you can do something or maybe find something around the house. 

\- Spending time

In P3R, you can spend your time with your teammates, drink coffee, cooking, gardening, take Kuromaru for a walk. I would like to see that we can spend time with Nanako like playing with her, cooking with her, do laundry with her, and gardening with her. And this spending time, will give benefits to the MC; able to make HP/SP items, stats buff, social stats increase, etc.

\- new game systems

like in P3R, you will have mails notifications, for part time jobs and SL. So I would like that to be added in P4R as well. Quick access or shortcut to locations, a menu that allows us to see who is available for SL, and then internet network access like in the Golden. 

\- New Battle systems

in P3R we have Theurgy, P5 we have Showtime, in Golden we have Combo Moves. I think the combo moves will be still in the game, but they improve it more and add more flare to it. Card Shuffle is a must in the game, its the fundamental of P4. Rise will have skills that is similar to Fuuka, like dungeon search, escape, ailments, etc. At certain points or certain benefits effects, MC will now able to change Persona even when or after you get ""1 More!"" And this is gonna be sound crazy but MC will now able to use 2 personas in battle, meaning he can use persona skills 2 times, but this can be acquired only if certain spending time is done to get the special benefits. And then the dashing for ambush like in P3R is needed to be in the game. 

So I guess thats it for me to hope for. What you guys do hope to see in the game?",2,1750124926.0,persona4revival,0,1.0,False

1ldaxdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepystories/comments/1ldaxdk/the_town_at_the_end_of_route_18/,The Town at the End of Route 18,"It was supposed to be a quick drive. It’s been three weeks.

I’d just finished moving my sister into her new place in Cincinnati and figured I’d take the long way home, scenic route, a little peace, maybe grab a picture of a covered bridge or something old-school.

My Dad used to do that, take new routes home every day. I’d get so annoyed because I just wanted to go, but now I understand why. He was trying to teach me to enjoy the journey I guess.

Anyway I was halfway through a two-lane stretch of Route 18 when I realized I hadn’t seen another car in nearly an hour. No trucks, no semis, no headlights in my rearview. Just gray road, flat cornfields, and the kind of cloudy sky that makes everything feel like it’s been put on pause.

It was so strange because 5:00 is always rush hour. I’ve been stuck in standstill traffic for up to four hours before, but here there was absolutely no one else on the road. I didn’t panic or anything, not then, I just thought it was good luck. Since I was in a new area I wanted to see what it had to offer. I started scanning for a gas station, a diner, something local, no chains. And then I saw the sign. It was small, wooden, and so weather-worn it almost completely blended into the trees behind it.

""Welcome to Bent Bridge.” It had a population count too, but the numbers were too faded to read.

I don’t remember seeing it on the map, but I was mostly driving by the overhead roadsigns at that point, so I figured I'd stop in, stretch my legs, maybe get a snack.

The town looked like it had been plucked from a postcard, but not a new one. One of those washed-out, sepia-toned photos you find in boxes at a flea market. Small main street, angled hanging shop signs, brick buildings with hand-painted windows. Everything extremely neat. The people were the same. Polite. Smiling. Friendly in a way that felt scripted. Like they were reading from a play I hadn’t seen.

A man at the gas station greeted me with a wave and a grin so big I swear it moved his eyes. I pulled over to ask a few questions and he called out

“Beautiful day, isn’t it?”

he said it just like it was something he’d practiced for a high school play. I nodded and mumbled

“Yeah, I guess.”

He didn’t blink. Just kept smiling.

“I was looking for a place to rest and eat a little, you got any restaurants? I’m looking for something local.”

“Well yeah! BB Diner is just down that street on the corner, you can see the sign from here! Best Pan Fried Steak in the county! And you’re in luck too, because right across the bridge is the BB In!”

I said thanks and kept driving. I heard him behind my car say his line.

“Beautiful day, isn’t it?”

""The birds are singing!"" another replied.

Looking down the street I noticed everything was named BB Something. BB Mercantile, BB Postoffice, BB autorepair. It was like the creators of the town really liked shortening Bent Bridge into BB and threw it everywhere. If it ain’t broke, I guess.

In the diner, a waitress refilled my coffee four times without being asked. I never saw her walk over. I’d blink, and my cup would be full and she’d be smiling asking if she could get me anything else. I asked if the BB Inn had rooms. She paused for a really long time, just staring. At first right in the eyes but then they went distant. They came back into focus and it was like she snapped out of a trance.

“Of course! Just past the old bridge.”

“Old bridge?” I asked. S

he looked at me and smiled again. Wide.

“It’s what the town’s named after.”

I don’t know why but I faked putting the pieces together about BB and it made her laugh.

It wasn’t a real laugh.

As I left I noticed the handful of guests in the diner hadn’t moved, one was still in the same place of his lemon pie he’d been when I walked in. He just sat there, staring at the half eaten wedge, fork in his hand. I followed the directions she gave me, left at the courthouse, past the shuttered post office, down the gravel road with no name, until I found the bridge.

It was barely standing. Rusted bolts, sagging beams. One of the handrails had broken clean off. On the other side was the inn. At least, that’s what the crooked wooden sign said. “BB Inn” But it didn’t look like an inn. More like a house someone abandoned and then some other fellow moved in thinking it could be a fixer upper. I would assume this individual was one of those who always start projects and never finish. The windows were different kinds from the frames to the panes. Paint peeling like birch bark, and the front door was wide open. Inside, it smelled like pine cleaner and bleach, but underneath there was something sickly, like old melted candy or rotting fruit.

A woman stood at the check-in counter. She looked young, but in the same way a wax museum figure of a young woman might look young. Smooth face. Hair that didn’t move, and that wide smile everyone seemed to have. It started to unnerve me.

“Room’s ready,” she said.

“Oh… did you know I was coming?”

“Shirley from the Diner called ahead, we got everything ready for you!”

If it weren’t for the circumstances I’d take this chance to start flirting. Everything about this town was so strange I gave staying there a second thought. But I told myself I was tired. That I’d just lock the door and leave at first light.

But the door didn’t lock. And when I tried to prop a chair against the knob, I turned around and it was already back under the desk. I started to actually freak out. I didn’t sleep. I listened.

All night there were voices under the floorboards. Not talking, practicing. Repeating lines over and over again.

“Beautiful day, isn’t it?”

“Coffee’s always fresh here.”

“Room’s ready.”

Over and over. Same cadence. Same exact words. No variation. Like they were warming up for something. A

t dawn, I left. No one stopped me, but the town wasn’t the same. The shop windows were still painted, but the names had changed, now they were just labels.

“FOOD.”

“HARDWARE.”

“SLEEP.”

The people were walking in slow loops, nodding to each other on perfect intervals, as if on cue. And every single one of them looked at me with that awful smile. I hurried back in my car, I tried to drive back the way I came. But Route 18 didn’t curve on the way out like it did the way in. The cornfields were gone, replaced by endless, repeating houses.

I turned around a dozen times trying to find the road I’d taken. But all I passed were the same houses. Not identical, but uncannily close. As if variations of the same design. Like someone had an idea but didn’t have success in making it real. Like someone had studied suburban design and built it from memory, and got 95% of it right. The windows were slightly too tall. Doors too narrow. Mailboxes sitting just a bit too close to the curb. And every driveway had a car with license plates that ended in “111.”

The gas tank never empties. The clouds haven’t moved once. I've started to pick up some of the lines the townfolk use. I found out there might be only a certain number of them, either that or they recycle outfits. It's always a man in a worn sunhat and overalls, or a nice business suit. A woman in a polkadotted pencil skirt or a blouse, sometimes with an apron.

It's always the same clothes with slight variations. When I pass one I recognize I know what they're going to say. I said it at the same time once to see what would happen. Nothing, just the awful uncanny smile.

I saw one woman wearing modern clothes once, but I never saw her again. I don't know where she went.

Sometimes I pass the BB Inn again. Different angle. Different sign. Same crooked smile in the window.

Every time I pass, I feel more like I belong here.

The lines are starting to stick.

And the next time someone says ""Beautiful day isn't it?"","" I think I might say “The birds are singing!”

A few weeks ago she had a flair up on her hands out of nowhere when we were going out. It hasn’t happened before. 

Symptoms:

Sensitive to hot objects (like if you were to touch a hot cup of coffee when you’ve had a blister on your finger or something)

The fingers go really wrinkled when out of the shower

The hands go a bit blotchy - red dots all over palms and fingertips only

The finger skin starts to peel / crack up - especially when using hands 

Things we’ve tried:

Hydrocortisol cream
Nivea restore repair
Cerave ointment 

It’s starting to worry her and I don’t know what to tell her to get it fixed

t dawn, I left. No one stopped me, but the town wasn’t the same. The shop windows were still painted, but the names had changed, now they were just labels.

“FOOD.”

“HARDWARE.”

“SLEEP.”

The people were walking in slow loops, nodding to each other on perfect intervals, as if on cue. And every single one of them looked at me with that awful smile. I hurried back in my car, I tried to drive back the way I came. But Route 18 didn’t curve on the way out like it did the way in. The cornfields were gone, replaced by endless, repeating houses.

I turned around a dozen times trying to find the road I’d taken. But all I passed were the same houses. Not identical, but uncannily close. As if variations of the same design. Like someone had an idea but didn’t have success in making it real. Like someone had studied suburban design and built it from memory, and got 95% of it right. The windows were slightly too tall. Doors too narrow. Mailboxes sitting just a bit too close to the curb. And every driveway had a car with license plates that ended in “111.”

The gas tank never empties. The clouds haven’t moved once. I've started to pick up some of the lines the townfolk use. I found out there might be only a certain number of them, either that or they recycle outfits. It's always a man in a worn sunhat and overalls, or a nice business suit. A woman in a polkadotted pencil skirt or a blouse, sometimes with an apron.

It's always the same clothes with slight variations. When I pass one I recognize I know what they're going to say. I said it at the same time once to see what would happen. Nothing, just the awful uncanny smile.

I saw one woman wearing modern clothes once, but I never saw her again. I don't know where she went.

Sometimes I pass the BB Inn again. Different angle. Different sign. Same crooked smile in the window.

Every time I pass, I feel more like I belong here.

The lines are starting to stick.

And the next time someone says ""Beautiful day isn't it?"","" I think I might say “The birds are singing!”

Symptoms:

Sensitive to hot objects (like if you were to touch a hot cup of coffee when you’ve had a blister on your finger or something)

The fingers go really wrinkled when out of the shower

The hands go a bit blotchy - red dots all over palms and fingertips only

The finger skin starts to peel / crack up - especially when using hands 

Things we’ve tried:

Hydrocortisol cream
Nivea restore repair
Cerave ointment

But we're also good friends too. She's also my crush who's moving away next week and so I felt compelled to open up about some things. However, this made things awkward between us. I don't know why exactly tho. So if you can at least help me understand.

So we met last summer and it was an instant mutual connection. We got along well. We shared same goals and passions. As the months go on, we've hung out a lot and especially recently. We've seen movies together, gone to events and amusement parks. I was for sure her ""film friend"" or film colleague as she posted once.

However, I had feelings for her the whole time. I've never told her. On the other hand, she's had a fiance this whole time and she's never told me directly. Like, she's never mentioned it.

So I brought it up the other day about it and it got awkward. And then she blocked me on Facebook because thats where she tags him. Im good on instagram still. And so, I never care if anyone restricts me in any way on socials but we're really good friends so this hurts me a bit

So I brought it up today when we had coffee and I said ""so about facebook. Will I be blocked forever?"" And she said ""we'll see"". I tried to bargain why we should be connected there and she said ""stop talking about it or I'll get upset"". And admitted me bringing up her fiance also made her upset. But I don't get it, why? I tried to explain that I just wasn't sure, so I was wondering. But she insisted it was just weird that I brought it up.

And then later today, I mentioned something else and she said ""you're getting annoying"". And I stopped. Kept on with our business.

We plan on meeting one more time before she leaves. Regardless of what the future holds for us as friends, i know in my heart that I will let go of my feelings for her. I have to. So i hope I get some peace with that and I hope we end up on good terms.

What do you think? We're still connected but with some restrictions. Should I continue to bargain my way to being unblocked or let it go and be at peace that we'll have some contact?",1,1750124048.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

Coffee tends to put me to sleep but I like the taste so sometimes I have it. Mushroom drinks give me a little jittery buzz sometimes.  

I saw the C4 Jolly Rancher flavors and was like hmm sounds fun let's try it. Mostly because the ingredients didn't look that bad and it didn't have stevia.

I have had ZERO bad side effects. 

1. They really help me focus
2. I experienced no itching, no jitters, and no crash. 
3. They didn't adversely affect my digestion or urine, in fact, unlike supplements urine was normal, and unlike other pre-workout powders, it improved my BM's, and I am less bloated. 🤷🏻‍♀️
4. They don't affect my sleep schedule or make me stressed at all, and I don't feel dehydrated. But I usually drink a lot of water. 

I'm so confused because I am obsessed with these especially the watermelon and green apple. And I'm extremely curious why I would have these effects when everything I see is warning me about kidney and liver failure, acne, depression,  etc. I mean I drink one maybe every other day. And then I take a break because I get curious if I'm just imagining these positive effects, and no, I'm not!

Health background info: I have low blood pressure, hypothyroidism, and PCOS. Not sure if those matter at all. But figure if there's anyone with a medical backround that reads this and has insight or opinion it might be useful.

This happened three days ago and I’m still kind of riding the high and the panic at the same time. 

I’ve been job hunting, but casually. Just a few applications here and there when I feel like maybe I should be an adult and not live off iced coffee and freelance invoices that say “Net 15” but don’t get paid until Net Never.

I applied to a handful of admin assistant roles. Mostly boring stuff. Remote preferred. One of them was through a company called ""Westridge Admin"". I didn’t remember much about it, just that the description said flexible schedule and health benefits.

A couple days later, I got an interview request. The email said “Westridge” and gave me a time, an address, and a contact name. No red flags. I accepted and marked it in my calendar.

The day of the interview, I showed up early. I wore a black blazer, clean jeans, and boots that make me feel like I have my life together. The office was in one of those glass-and-steel mid-rise buildings downtown. I walked in, gave my name at the front desk, and they told me to head to the fourth floor.

I get off the elevator and walk into a really sleek lobby area. Leather chairs. Minimalist furniture. A woman behind a marble desk nods and tells me someone will be with me shortly. The guy sitting next to me is in a full suit. No tie, but definitely business. He’s holding a leather folio and reviewing what looks like printed spreadsheets.

I start sweating.

I pull up the job listing on my phone to make sure I didn’t accidentally apply to some finance role. The listing is gone. The company website just has a logo and a “contact us” page.

Before I can spiral further, a woman steps out and calls my name. I stand. She gives me a firm handshake and says, “So nice to finally meet you in person. We really liked your take on streamlining onboarding for remote teams.”

I freeze for half a second. I didn’t write anything like that. But my body smiles and says, “Thank you, I really appreciate that.”

She leads me into a glass-walled office. There’s a pitcher of water on the table and a branded notepad with the name Westridge Partners across the top. That’s when it clicks.

Westridge Admin Co. was the job I applied to. Westridge Partners is where I am now.

Different company. Different floor. Same building.

But I’m already in the interview.

She starts asking me questions about project management and remote team structure. I say things like “adaptable workflow models” and “clear communication channels.” I reference a team I worked with last year on a freelance basis and exaggerate just enough to sound impressive. She nods a lot and writes things down.

Then she says, “Our CTO really liked your application. He wants to meet you if you’re free to stay a little longer.”

I say sure.

Ten minutes later, a guy walks in wearing sneakers and a button-up. He greets me by name and offers coffee. I say yes, even though my hands are already shaking. He hands me an espresso and sits down like we’re continuing a conversation we never started.

He says, “I really liked your thoughts on internal tooling. How would you approach integration during a transition phase?”

I stall for half a second, then start talking about onboarding audits, documentation gaps, and real-time support systems. I don’t know if I blacked out or channeled the ghost of someone more qualified, but by the end of it, he’s smiling.

He says, “You’re the first person we’ve talked to who actually gets it.”

I leave the building twenty minutes later, sweating through my blazer and clutching a folder they gave me with onboarding info. I check the email again. The interview request was sent from someone at westridge-partners.com. I never applied there. I must have clicked something weird or sent a resume to a third-party recruiter and the wires got crossed.

Today I got a follow-up email saying they’d like to invite me to a panel interview on Zoom next week. Four people. Sixty minutes.

I still don’t know exactly what the role is. I’m afraid to ask. I’m afraid if I do, they’ll realize the mistake. But also, I kind of want to see how far this can go.

As dumb as it is, this has to do with a group chat. The family chat is mostly life updates and fun pictures of people. Whenever I post, which is maybe once/month-6 weeks SIL immediately tries to one up me. I noticed about 2 years ago that whenever I posted a picture she would immediately post something similar. My husband and I joked about it at first but it’s become a never-ending pattern.

Only when I post. When anyone else posts it’s a comment or a heart. But if I post a picture of a holiday meal I cooked she would within the hour post a photo of her making out with BIL. I post a picture of me and husband iceskating she would immediately post a picture of her and BIL kissing. Us hiking in BC. Her and BIL kissing their dog. 

I mean every time I post ANYTHING. She won’t share a single photo any other time or say anything unprovoked but my god I post saying we bought our first house and she immediately posts a photo of her hands holding a fancy coffee. 

What finally did it for me is I shared that an artwork I created was going on long-term loan to a museum and she followed it up by posting a picture of her dog. 

Who does that?!

In the rotation this week:
(1) This [harissa-spiced cauliflower and chickpea salad](https://dishingouthealth.com/harissa-roasted-cauliflower-chickpeas). So, so tasty when topped with that dressing and some pomegranate seeds.

Warning: TJ’s harissa makes this super spicy but it gets balanced out by [Thai red curry coconut biscuits](https://lamag.com/news/recipe-chef-brooke-williamsons-spicy-red-curry-biscuits1) on the side. Recipe courtesy of Top Chef alum Brooke Williamson. This recipe is super easy if you have a food processor AND SUPER DELICIOUS. I doubled it and froze half of the pre-made biscuits for future noms. 

Note: I didn’t have enough lemon juice for the dressing, but had a bunch of fresh orange juice left over from the biscuit recipe. I generally try to maximize all the ingredients I have or find a substitute in the pantry before purchasing more. Most of the time it works out! 
 
(2) [Vietnamese lemongrass beef and mango spring rolls](https://thegourmetgourmand.com/lemongrass-beef-summer-rolls/#recipe) with [peanut red curry dipping sauce](https://abeautifulmess.com/3-easy-spring-roll-sauces/).

These are made with brown rice paper wrappers I found at my local Asian supermarket. Fresh strawberries and cherries on the side.

Note: I halfed the sugar in the sauce since there was plenty of sweetness from the mango. Also pressed and quickly pan fried some medium firm tofu with some sriracha for added protein.

(3) [Asian-inspired noodle soup bowls](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/nourishing-asian-chicken-soup/). I assembled dry ingredients and let the broth cool, then froze. I plan to nuke the broth for 3 minutes in the microwave and pour over the dry ingredients when it’s time to eat. 

I had some beef and sriracha tofu left over from the spring rolls and just added those to the soup. 

(4) Easy yogurt bowls. This week’s mix included creamy plain Greek yogurt, strawberries, bananas, chocolate coffee granola, a little natural peanut butter, and a touch of local honey. 

Colorful foods make me happy. Happy prepping!  ",38,1750122998.0,MealPrepSunday,3,1.0,False
