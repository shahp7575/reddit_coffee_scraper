1oegohm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oegohm,Help with my first plant please!,"First-time poster here! I got this plant from a friend, and she passed down the green thumb to me! Since then, I’ve gotten two others, but I’m very emotionally attached to this one — she even has a name!
Recently, she started developing these white and black dots, and I don’t know what to do to make her better. I repotted her because my boyfriend put some coffee on her to help her grow (with the best intentions!), but she didn’t like it and started to grow mold. So now she has fresh soil and a new pot!
But still, the dots are there, and she doesn’t look like her normal self anymore.
Can any experienced plant friends share some ideas? I’d really appreciate it!
This is a new hobby for me, and I fear I’m not very good at it yet — but I’m determined to learn!

1oegog0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oegog0/aita_for_having_a_guest_live_in_my_dorm/,AITA for having a guest live in my dorm,"My boyfriend (18FTM) and me (18F) have been dating for six months. To put it brief, he has had a rough and complicated family life. When this story started, he lived with his grandparents (one of whom was mildly abusive). They lived in extreme poverty (I come from a wealthy family) and he worked at a coffee shop full-time (dropped out of high school due to bullying).

I am a freshmen at an unnamed public university that is mostly hispanic serving (we are both white). My roommate (18F and hispanic, first-gen) who i will call Ellie is a STEM major (i'm humanities).

My bf (who i will call Mark from now on) had been planning on visiting me over labor day weekend since before school started. he had a friend who lived in this area and the three of us were going to hang out. on the last night right as he was about to drive home, him, ellie, and i were sitting in a restraunt. he got a notification that a job application he had sent it wanted an interview. (he was going to move where i am in late october, as his 18th bday was the 12 of oct and u need to be 18 for a lease). so he got a response way early and it was in-person only. the interview was for next week. i was very hesitant at first, but my roommate enthusiastically agreed that this was a very good oppurtunity for him and he could stay in our dorm until his birthday and move out date so he could have this job.

now, my parents are extremely unaccepting and do not know about my bf's existence bc he is trans. my roommate knew he was and was ok with it. she also knew he had a cat and was ok with the cat living with us too. YES ALL THREE OF US WERE AWARE OF THE POLICY VIOLATIONS OF HIM AND THE CAT BEING THERE BUT SHE AGREED AS OF EARLY SEPT.

ok. so. ellie gets a bf (who i will call jack) and me and mark dont really like him. he's a little agressive, vaguely transphobic, and mean to our cat. but we dont say anything bc we are asking a lot of ellie with mark living there. in early october, mark and i are at the pet store getting stuff for his cat (socks for our purposes). ellie loves socks btw. i see a stray for adoption and love him. i text my roomate about her opinion on having a second cat for a couple weeks until mark moves out and can take both cats. she doesn't respond.

so when i get back to the dorm, i ask her in person and she says she'll think about it. (at this point things had been kinda tense and our once jokey friendship was now awkward bc she was always with the bf and sleeping at his a lot. she was also really busy with school. she NEVER told me she was upset or stressed about ANYTHING). i tell her we're going to a shelter two days from then to look at more cats (bc i have my heart set on a cat of my own now bc i wasnt allowed pets as a kid). i invite her but she says she has class. so she knows we going just cant come.

1oegnyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AugmentCodeAI/comments/1oegnyp/how_im_working_better_than_i_did_with_augment/,How I’m working better than I did with Augment,"I wrote this as a reply on one of the other threads, and thought it might be useful to people if I made it more visible and made a couple of light edits. I’ll also post it over on the Claude and maybe Codex subreddits.

I’m working better now without augment and I have them to thank for giving me a kick in the butt. To be honest, I’m probably a bit more of a power user than a lot of the folks who use augment as individual: my average message was around 2400 of their credits and I was running 2-4 parallel augment processes and on track for consuming at least 1500-1600 messages/month when I ran out of messages this month. Augment’s messaging implied we would have messages convert to credits on the 20th, so, since messages were worth way more than credits, I became more efficient and was operating at 4 parallel tasks once I got into the swing of things. Because I normally work on 2-3 parallel tasks, this may be too OP for you, but if you want to basically add another virtual mid- to sr- level programmer or five to your life, who can code at about 2-5x the speed you can code at, and never takes coffee breaks, my approach might work for you.

I use Claude code with a very robust structure around it (think agentOS, but I created it before that existed and it is different and takes a slightly different approach). I have recently evolved this to the next level, in that I have integrated codex into Claude code, so Claude can use codex in addition to all of its own normal resources. They are peers and work together as such. I have them working on tasks together, problem solving together, and writing code together. They each have things they are better at, and they are the primary driver in those areas.

I came to the conclusion that I needed to do this when I realized that my way of using AI tools meant I would hit my weekly limits for Claude (20x plan) in the first 4 days of each week. I’m not sure yet if I will wind up being able to go back down to Max 5x with GPT pro (I doubt it…I may be able to add an additional concurrent issue/story/feature, though, with both on the top plans, since it’s a 40-60% savings on context and resource utilization compared to just sonnet 4.5), or if my usage patterns are so heavy that I just need the top plan for each to run 2-4 parallel task streams, but my productivity is incredible, and Claude believes it can now run large-scale tasks while I sleep (we will be seeing if that’s true tonight). I’m regularly running 1-3 hour tasks now, and I can run at least 2 coding tasks in parallel, while playing the human role of sanity checker, guiding how I want things done, architecting, and teaching the system how to write code approaching my own level (our system of rules and ADRs is truly making this possible).

I have learned to use subagents and reduce my MCP footprint as much as possible, so Claude doesn’t run out of context window (compacting probably once every 1-3 hours now, instead of every 5-15 minutes).

I run sequential-thinking MCP, my repository management system’s MCP, a git MCP (jury is out on this over letting it use the shell), serena MCP, a documentation distiller MCP, a browser driver MCP, a code indexer MCP, ast-grep MCP for doing complex pattern analysis and replacement, and, of course, codex as an MCP so I can leverage my codex subscription while using all the advantages of Claude code. Sometimes I run an MCP for a web framework or mobile framework I’m developing with, to give the system references and enable it to pull in components.

Custom Claude subagents (subject matter experts) that I’ve built are a massive boon to the process, helping control context growth and improving how good Claude is at sourcing tasks, and I’ve now modified them to be able to work with codex as well (well, I had Claude do that). Claude skills are next on the list (I’m still trying to figure out how they can best add to my workflow).

TL;DR is you can do better than Augment if you are strategic, organized, and have Claude help you optimize your prompting, memory, and context management strategies and systems.

1oegly8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1oegly8/she_made_me_terrified_of_women/,She made me terrified of women.,"So, there's this woman who's 25. She's had several relationships. I'm a 21-year-old guy; the most I've ever done with a girl is hold hands back in 9th grade.

I met her on Reddit. She had made a post in a subreddit about a specific kink she was into and wanted to see if anyone from our country was interested. I looked into it and found it kind of hot, so I messaged her. We talked for two days and she said, ""I don't want anything serious,"" and I felt the same way, so I thought it was a good idea to exchange numbers.

We started talking on WhatsApp and it was nice. I asked her a few times if she had a problem with me being younger than her. Sometimes she said no, sometimes she seemed hesitant. I told her I had zero experience. So I asked her, given my lack of experience, how would this work? She said we'd go to a coffee shop, talk, and see if we had a connection and trust. After that, we would make out. She was extremely, extremely confident, and that kind of intimidated me a little. It's not that I don't like confident women, but it was my first time doing anything like this.

(She had a car; she was the one who picked me up from home and dropped me back off.)

She has a lot going on in her life. She's graduated and works, while I'm still a student. Because of this, I could barely bring myself to talk about intimate things. We talked about religion, physics, math, computers, and artificial intelligence, but I didn't give her a single compliment.

Then, after that, she asked me if I was interested in going to an empty/quiet place. I said, ""Yeah, sure, no problem."" So we went, she parked the car, and she said something casual like, ""So, what's new?""

And I did something a little stupid/awkward: I said, ""Nothing's new anymore,"" and just started kissing her. After about 15 seconds, we stopped and she said, ""Use your lips more."" Then we tried again.

Then we stopped. I asked her what was wrong. She said it wasn't about me, and she said something along the lines of her only being able to do it with someone she has real feelings for, or is truly attracted to (I don't remember exactly what she said, it kind of messed with my head). So I told her, ""It's okay, I don't want to do anything you're not comfortable with.""

Then she started giving me advice, saying that I should use my lips more and give compliments to my partner.

On the way back, I said something because I felt a bit hurt, and it crossed my mind to say, ""I'm sure you'll text me again."" I don't know why I said that.
TL;DR:
21M, almost zero experience, met 25F on Reddit via a shared kink. Agreed on casual, met up, tried kissing. She said she only connects physically with someone she has feelings for, gave me tips on kissing/compliments. Feeling awkward and unsure how to move forward.",1,1761257021.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

AIO that it is unreasonable to expect a tip when you literally do no work other than open a bottle cap? Or is it now expected to tip no matter what?

*“Humans break things, deal with it or go home”*

**Nuk proverb, Author unknown.**

 

“Fire when ready!” Admiral Browner’s command bellowed through the CIC. Standing tall amid the flickering lights, he was once again the domineering figure he usually was.

Karrn understood the admiral. The first days of the fight had been a constant beating for the ship, and the fact that the *Argos* was still able to fight back was a testament to human shipbuilding — and their uncanny fleet coordination. More than a thousand vessels had fired continuously on a single human ship and still couldn’t kill it. Others would have given up, but the humans kept sweeping away enemy torpedoes, wave after wave. And the Batract kept sending them.

Karrn was sure that, in matters of stubbornness, both species were the same. He was also certain this fight — and this war — could only end with one side utterly defeated. Neither would ever accept any kind of status quo.

The vibrations of the capacitors charging were now all too familiar to Karrn. Then the deck shuddered again, and for one minute it kept trembling every five seconds.

After a brief time of confusion, the Batract had adapted to humanity’s new weapon. The enemy squadrons stopped holding stationary positions and began patrolling in irregular patterns around the fleet — still at that infuriating six-AU distance.

It was clear to everyone their goal wasn’t to wipe the humans out — not yet, at least. They were waiting for reinforcements.

And the humans did everything they could to draw them closer in. But it wasn’t enough.

Karrn’s reason for being in the CIC was no longer just to observe the battle; he was observing everyone. The human intelligence officer, Gerber, had told him about his suspicions — that there was either a spy aboard the ship, or something the Batract were desperate to see destroyed.

A traitor. Karrn hated nothing more than traitors. His fur bristled beneath his space suit.

He was glad to have his own suit back finally. The human armory had actually managed to rebuild his old, destroyed one — so he was no longer a stumbling idiot in an oversized human suit, but once again a dangerous hunter.

*And he was on the hunt for a traitor.*

“Pack Leader? Please come to the infirmary — we might have found something.” Gerber’s voice came clear through the radio.

The human maintenance crews were warriors and wizards. Two days ago, the ship had been on the verge of breaking apart — now, everywhere Karrn looked, someone was repairing something, cutting away debris, or replacing entire consoles. They had even managed to fix the intercom repeaters throughout the ship again.

He hurried back to the infirmary, grateful to have his balance again — being able to move his tail freely made the difference between stumbling and hunting. On the way, he checked the gun Gerber had given him.

*The caliber was massive. And the ammunition… protomatter bullets. By the Great Hunter in the sky.*

Every species knew of protomatter — the dangerously unstable substance that accumulated on ships during transition. But only humans would think, *Hey, that stuff eats through metal and explodes violently if you look at it the wrong way — let’s make bullets out of it.*

*Madness. Glorious madness.*

He reached the infirmary. Gerber and Healer Nesbitt stood there; it seemed they had overcome their differences — or perhaps declared a cease-fire. Karrn couldn’t tell with everyone sealed in space suits.

“Karrn, glad you came. There’s something still in the morgue. We thought the thermal cleansing had evaporated everything, but when Dr. Nesbitt evacuated the patients this morning, they noticed some faint knocking from inside. It’s still welded shut.”

Karrn could hardly believe anything could survive seven days in vacuum. Then again, the Batract were a fungal life-form — and fungi were known to endure extreme conditions.

Healer Nesbitt pointed to a screen. “We analyzed some samples from the *Rosalind Franklin* before she was destroyed.” She smirked inside her helmet. “Getting frozen in space makes taking samples easy. This was the first time we’ve ever been able to study Batract fungal growth. They’re fascinating — they act as a neural network, connecting their hyphae together much like a brain. Each cell has thirty-four hyphae.”

“Thirty-four?” Gerber interjected.

“Yes, it’s odd. Usually there’s some variation, but —”

Gerber cut her off. “Please wait. I’ll have to talk to Davies and Lyra — this is big. You might have just solved a mystery.”

Karrn and Nesbitt watched as Gerber stormed out of the infirmary.

“Guess it’s just us two now.”

“And whatever’s in the morgue,” added Karrn.

—————

 

Gerber sprinted back to his quarters — to his office. On the way, he almost ran down two maintenance techs carrying a large piece of deck plating.

*Andrè, be careful! Don’t have a lightbulb moment and run around like a headless chicken!*

The ship was a hazard zone. You couldn’t take two steps without cables sparking, lights flickering, or metal plating and struts blocking entire passageways. And now there was an additional hazard — people fixing the ship again.

Thirty-four connections to each cell — thirty-four is their basis for math. Quite an unusual choice, but rooted in their biology. It’s so far off that every code-breaking algorithm would fail to try it. No wonder we can’t crack their codes.

Reaching his quarters, he stormed in. Davies, sitting at her desk, almost pulled her gun. He noticed she looked like she had dozed off — understandable; everyone was exhausted after days of combat.

Of course she didn’t hear me — no sound in vacuum.

“Good Lord, sir, you startled me! Must have dozed off — sorry, sir.” She looked exhausted to Gerber.

“When did you last sleep?”

She looked at him with an almost defeated expression. “Not since we started using those infernal *Welsh Princesses.* Every shot feels like it’s pulling directly at my brain — almost like a transit, but not that strong.”

Gerber remembered how sick she had looked when they shifted in and later out of transit. He had thought it was her being nervous about the jump itself, but if it was a physical trait…

“Go see Dr. Nesbitt. Chief Ferguson said the projectiles shift inside the barrel. Maybe what you’re feeling is the anomaly forming.”

“Thank you, sir, but I’m fine,” she started to protest. “Just a coffee or three and I’m good to go.”

“That’s an order, Lieutenant. Go check yourself out — I can’t let my adjutant collapse from exhaustion. That would look bad on my résumé.”

“Aye, sir.” Davies looked defeated, but Gerber thought there was a hint of relief in it. He called for a medic to escort her to the infirmary.

While at it, he also managed to finally reach Chief Ferguson and ship security to plan the breach of the morgue.

Then came the main event — planning to breach Batract internal communications.

“Lyra, I learned from Dr. Nesbitt’s studies that the Batract have thirty-four hyphae. I assume it’s their base for math?”

“I just went through the reports, and I concur — thirty-four seems to be a big part of Batract base math.” Lyra’s voice sounded preoccupied. He remembered the situation in the CIC a few days ago when Lyra had obviously lied to them. He made a mental note to check that out as well.

“You said ‘big part.’ Are there other base systems they could have? Humans only have one — base ten.”

“That’s where you’re wrong. Humans have base two for digital computing, base sixteen for digital encoding, base ten for trade, math, and science, and base twelve for timekeeping, music, and color coding. Coincidentally, it’s your oldest known system — because it’s the most natural.”

Gerber didn’t know what to say. He thought he had a breakthrough, only to get served a history lesson.

“But it *is* a fascinating discovery. The other VIs and I are already working on breaking the Batract encryption. It might still take hours or days — but not centuries anymore.”

Gerber sight, he was hoping to read Batract internal memos by the end of the day.

 

—————

 

Karrn was back in the CIC. At first, it seemed like nothing had changed — then he saw movement in the holo tank.

*They’re moving in!*

He checked the latest count. Six hundred twelve ships remaining — still a massive armada, but the odds were now much more in their favor, or at least not so high against them.

“Sensors? Any hint as to why the enemy finally decided to come at us?” Even though it seemed Admiral Browner had been gunning for them to come closer, he was still suspicious of their motives.

“Nothing, sir. Scanning continues, but the residual radiation is hampering our sensors quite a bit.”

“Understood. Keep at it. Comms, get me a status update from the fleet and inform the colony. Tell them we have incoming and suspect some might try a breakthrough to the planet.”

“Aye, sir!”

Karrn studied the map. The admiral was right — the different squadrons formed a spearhead aimed at both the planet and the fleet, their flight trajectories curving around Tor Shornin, the supermassive gas giant Taishon Tar was orbiting.

“Gotta love those gas giants, Karrn — they’re a fantastic barrier in space.” The admiral stood behind him, also studying the three-dimensional overview.

“Fleet reports ninety-five percent operational status. Only damage reported comes from *Argos,*” Comms reported.

Looking through the damaged CIC — one of the tactical overview tables pierced by a steel beam — the admiral dryly answered, “Almost didn’t notice.”

“Sir, first wave reaches minefields in thirty seconds.”

Karrn knew — now they would see if the *Pioneers’* preparations would make a difference.

“Very fine. Inform Captain Carmichael he’s free to engage the enemy at will.”

Karrn focused on the tactical overview again. The enemy was now closing in at two AU, making use of their superior acceleration. Then the update symbol appeared — a *Pigeon* had arrived with data from a spy satellite.

Dots disappeared. The Batract spearhead had entered the minefields at high speed and was almost wiped out.

Five hundred seventy-four remaining.

Without a warning, the ship shook violently. The *Argos* and the rest of their squadron were under direct fire. The googly eyes gave Karrn an overview — one squadron had used the sensor shadow of Tor Shornin to get closer to the human vessels.

For the first time, he could see the enemy battleships. They were slightly larger than the *Argos* — ugly, hybrid-looking ovals of metal overgrown with some kind of biological matter. Probably fungus. Karrn felt nauseous seeing them. The ships looked like they were infected by a sickness; the fur along his neck bristled.

Torpedoes emerged from the ships — hundreds of them. The deck plating of the *Argos* began vibrating in a staccato rhythm, the previously silent point-defense guns sending out streaks of bullets that destroyed scores of torpedoes.

He noticed additional PDG fire interlocking and taking out even more of the incoming torpedoes.

Suddenly, three of the Batract ships were engulfed in white light for an instant — only to vaporize into a cloud of debris.

He changed the viewpoint to another *Googly Eye* drone to see what had happened. *Mirage* had returned fire and unleashed a second volley. At the extreme close distance of only a few thousand kilometers, the torpedoes activated their spirit drives and reached hypersonic speed within seconds.

Moments later, they separated into multiple warheads — always paired to detonate left and right of an enemy ship. Then both went off simultaneously.

Karrn couldn’t believe the readout. Each carried an explosive force of one hundred fifty megatons, crushing the enemy ships between them as if their shields and hull armor didn’t exist.

He had learned to use the shipboard info system and gained access to weapon details. He quickly searched *Mirage*’s armament: 250 Zar Bomba Mk3 multi-warhead torpedoes, each warhead fitted with a variable detonator between 100 and 300 megatons.

*By the Great Hunter,* *the firepower of one of their torpedo frigates was enough to end all life on Burrow!*

The enemy ship counter changed to five hundred forty.

What did he miss? There were so many things happening. He zoomed out.

For a heartbeat he thought the camera was broken  — another squadron of Batract ships had reached the fleet. Some were burning from hull breaches and venting atmosphere, but they all appeared to be inside a cloud.

The cloud he saw was drones. When he zoomed in on the fleet, he saw them — hundreds of thousands of drones swarming the ships, attacking in suicide runs through the hull breaches their predecessors had punched. Soon the first ship erupted — then the others followed.

In the background the Comms gave info updates to the Admiral: “Drone swarms took out Tango 13, Swarm down to 40%”

“Send them to protect the Planet from landing crafts and get another swarm here. The bastards are trying to crush us all at once.”

Karrn saw on the video wall what the admiral meant — the fleet was now being attacked from two sides by scores of ships: eighty from one flank, one hundred thirty from the other.

Over the next half hour, he learned what humans meant when they said they excel at knife fights.

The *Argos* formed a spearhead with the four other ships of her squadron; the rest of the fleet did the same. Instead of forming a defensive perimeter, as the Shraphen Veyr would have done around the planet, they attacked.

The madness of running into the attackers' fire when the enemy was in such greater numbers…

*Argos* fired her main gun — now again with conventional ammunition. Every shot gutted a Batract ship. Scores of missiles swarmed from each of the ships, targeting specific growths on the Batract hulls.

“They’re taking out their weapons,” Karrn realized.

*Mirage* and *Renown* fired their terrible torpedoes again, this time seemingly at maximum detonation. Some of the warheads were intercepted by enemy point defense, but those that got through were devastating. Each detonation erased another ship.

From the rear of the opposing fleet, a living cloud emerged — and ships began to explode. Another drone swarm had reached the battlefield.

Karrn noticed that some ships seemed to erupt without being hit. He changed the wavelength of the feed and saw it: *Trafalgar* was using her microwave lasers to boil the Batract ships. Combined with her four forty-centimeter main guns, she cut through the enemy formation.

At this moment, the *Argos* was inside the hostile formation. Karrn had assumed the humans would veer off — not enter the enemy formation — but he was wrong.

The humans now targeted the opposing ships directly with their PDGs, something he had never seen before — intentionally getting so close to the Batract vessels that Karrn could see the veins pulsing on the biological growths covering their hulls.

*Renown* had been hit hard; one of her magazines had taken a direct hit, and secondary explosions rippled along her hull. But even as she veered out and under the enemy formation, she unleashed her most devastating salvo yet. Karrn assumed she had fired every torpedo left in her arsenal. In doing so, she blew a massive hole in the Batract line.

This seemed to be the moment the drones had been waiting for. As *Argos*, *Mirage*, and *Trafalgar* emerged on the far side of the attacking flank, the drones swarmed through the hole left behind and attacked every remaining ship. *Saratoga* stayed a little behind, delivering kill shots point-blank to every vessel that remained.

Thirty minutes of fighting — and the humans had reduced two hundred ten enemy ships to rubble.

Karrn noticed his fingers hurt. He had gripped the edge of the table so hard that his palms and fingertips were throbbing now.

The whole battle had reminded him of the legendary ancient hunters Frox believed in — cutting down their foes while charging into armies with a sword in each hand. Karrn was about to start believing in them too.

“Status report!” The admiral had coordinated the entire battle, and his voice was now rough and strained.

“Fleet combat strength below sixty percent, repairs ongoing. Three friendlies mission-killed — *Renown*, *Graf Spee*, and *Thratai.* Enemy forces are down to under two hundred and retreating. The first ships have already transitioned out — destination unknown, but deeper into Batract core space. Six ships managed to break through to the planet’s surface and seem to have begun a ground assault on the colony.”

Karrn went over the report again in his head. *We won? How?*

“Well, Old Steelpipe said his ground pounders needed exercise — he’s got it now. We’ll keep the skies clear.”

For the first time since the battle had started, the admiral sat down in a chair.

Karrn looked down at the planet, grateful that his mate Rosha and their pups had evacuated on one of the tenders. *Rish, Tulk, Krun — be safe in the upcoming battle.*

I currently have three worm bins -- one is a takeout container, one very small glass jar, one shoebin with two different species i think (red wriggles and indian blues). Because of that, even if i do a corner pocket feeding, i forget which corner i've put the food in so i purchased these plastic food picks that goes inside lunchboxes. So here are my questions: 

1. Is that safe for my worms, the food picks i mean?   
2. Also, i know not to overfeed, but how do i know if i'm giving the right amount of food. i do maintenance on the worms weekly so aerating, misting, feeding, etc. and every time the food is gone so i'm worried i'm underfeeding.  
3. I've given all three coffee grounds and egg shells. But the glass container got a bit of mold on the coffee grounds, and i don't know how much egg shells to give. I grounded it up using a blender but is that necessary, or can i give it in bigger pieces? I'm worried about inhaling egg shell particles when i grounded finely like sand. Also how often should i give coffee grounds and egg shells?  
4. When do they get settled? i want to eventually move the shoe bin into a fcmp bin and move the takeout to the shoebin. when would be best to do that?   
5. Can i give white paper towels like the brand bounty to the worms?  
6. What extra tools do you think i should have or is nice to have that makes maintaining your bin easier and more fun? Right now i have a tarp, a small hand shove and cultivator rake, a small teaspoon, gardening gloves and nitrile gloves, and a few jars to store feeding supplies. Also where or how do you store your supplies? Do you store the coffee grounds and eggshells inside your fridge or outside with the tools?

There are like 8 pools, a waterpark that looks like it belongs in Orlando, and more food options than my hometown. I ate fresh sushi one night, Cuban sandwiches the next, and somehow still had room for gelato at midnight.

But what really surprised me? It didn’t feel chaotic. Even with thousands of people onboard, the layout’s so smart that it never felt crowded. And apparently, it’s way cleaner on emissions than older ships runs partly on LNG, which I didn’t expect from something this massive.

Honestly? It’s less “cruise ship” and more “floating vacation town you never knew you needed.”

Maybe for advice. Maybe to vent. Maybe to record my experience to remind myself what I went through. 

We've had a tumultuous relationship and it's only after I left that I realised that this man was emotionally (and at the very end physically) abusive. 

Married for 8 years, together for 13. 

I've experienced:

Coercive control when I'd refuse sex. After all the therapy, I came to realise he would only ever offer affection and kindness when he wanted sex, and then would switch it off the moment he got what he wanted. 
He'd stomp around and slam doors and cupboards for *hours* when I'd say no. 

Financial abuse. He'd spend money put aside for direct debit bills. Even after I explicitly tell him, show him, explain to him what the money is for. I changed our bank to one that literally shows the total available for spending, vs the amout put aside for bills. I would then have to rearrange funds, bills, etc just to ensure we paid everything on time. This has happened repeatedly. Even to the point where it caused our house insurance to be cancelled. I had to fix it. 

He would invalidate my feelings. Constantly. My reaction to his actions became the issue. If I'd raise an issue with him He'd get all upset and start self flagellation so that I'd comfort him. 

He would legitimately do the opposite of what we had agreed / discussed. 
We talked about letting our kids have coke (the drink) with dinner. I said no it's got caffeine. That same day he let our eldest have a drink of coke. It was Christmas eve. But i was getting upset over nothing. 

His brother put his hand up my thigh / up my dress at his nan's funeral. When I told him he trashed the hotel room around me. Threatened to leave me. Threatened to kill himself. Threatened to beat us his brother, Threatened to leave me. I was cowering under the hotel room desk clutching my phone too scared to call anyone for help. 

He's chased me down the street while I walked barefoot to get away from him after he threw something at me during another argument. 

He told me whilst I was 8 months pregnant that he searched for prostitutes in my first pregnancy because I didn't have enough sex with him but that he decided not to. Like a hero. 

He would respond to my serious questions with jokes. Constantly. And would then get angry with me when I would get upset that I didn't get an actual answer. 

He would go from 0 to 100 quickly when he got angry. He would wake up because the kids were being too noisy (aka kids) and storm out and tower over them and yell at them that they were being too loud. 

He terrified my eldest so much he had food in his bedroom because he was afraid his dad would get angry and yell if he didn't eat all his dinner. I found it mouldy in his wardrobe. My heart completely broke in that moment. 

He began seeing a therapist last year but would only go when things were bad. 

He has told me his therapist doesn't believe him to be an angry man. 

The day I decided to leave was the day he slapped me. He recently told me he doesn't even remember the incident and constantly minimises the event. 
It wasn't even a fight. Or when he was angry. We were having a good morning. Playful even. Playing the ""i don't want to get out of bed"" game. I'd tickle his feet. He'd pull off the blankets, yadda yadda. 
Then he opened my legs and slapped me on my vulva. I said woah I'm not nearly aroused enough for that. So he grabbed me and pulled me so he could slap my ass. 

Then he put his hand on my throat, slapped my face and kissed me. Then pulled away saying ""awh just testing"". 

I froze. I rolled over and curled in to a ball. He left to get the kids ready. Only when he came back to see me in a ball did he apologise. 

My cheek hurt for over 4 hours. It was not a gentle slap. It was cold. And calculated. And he doesn't remember it. 

Any way. Since the separation, he: 

Within 2 weeks was on tinder and dating. But when I went on an app and planned a date he told me it felt like cheating. 

After I had the best weekend with a friend I hadn't seen in years, about a 7 hour drive away from home, asked if i would go to couples counselling with him, asked if i would consider getting back together with him and told me he had written a goodbye note and was considering suicide. 

My friend heard the whole conversation. 

Has asked for me back 2 more times in that period. 

He was ""official"" with his new girlfriend after 2.5 months of our separation. 

He wants me to meet her for coffee tomorrow. 

I believe this is because he wants to be able to have her around our 2 kids. 

I'm just tired. His constant goading and games have worn me thin. 

I want to be polite and still refuse to allow her near the kids. But I don't want to be petty. 

What do I do? 

I have been raised to always take the high road and to be the bigger person.  And in all truth I am thriving being single. My skin is clear, I've lost 13 kilos. I've been off my antidepressants for months. I genuinely don't care he is dating but just feel he is trying to goad me with meeting his new girlfriend. ",2,1761256220.0,TwoXChromosomes,1,1.0,False

1oeg7f0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1oeg7f0/im_at_my_wits_end_with_my_roommates_dog/,i’m at my wits end with my roommate’s dog.,"my roommate adopted a husky and great pyrenese mix. he’s a massive, very sweet dog, and i do love him. however, he has some behavior issues that i know stem from a lack of attention and care. 

nearly every day, he has gotten into my bedroom trash and absolutely shredded it apart, leaving a disaster in my room. i have told my roommate over and over again to either keep an eye on her dog, or keep him in her room when she’s out. she always cracks jokes about it, which has started to bug me bc it seems like she’s not taking it seriously. i tried to tell her i don’t want him to get sick from my trash, she just joked that “he’d deserve it.” 

i try to leave my door open for my cat, so he can use the restroom and isn’t confined to a tiny bedroom all day. i’ve already spent 20 bucks on a trash can with a lid, and that somehow didn’t stop him. he also came into my room and shit on my carpet the other day because his owner had been out with friends all day. i was standing right there when it happened, the dog didn’t even try to hide it. i wanted to get a gate but apparently he just jumps them, and that would be another 20 bucks of my money down the drain— for someone else’s dog. 

he also keeps getting into stuff left on the counters and stove. his owner left a giant pistachio chocolate bar on the coffee table (i have no clue what she was thinking) and i caught him after he’d eaten the whole thing. he ate a whole pizza someone left cooling on the stove the other day.

the dog also barks uncontrollably, all day long. he’s huge and his bark is piercing— it’s a horrible sound to listen to. i feel bad for him, he’s a working breed that is confined to a tiny townhouse. he never goes on walks, goes potty at most twice a day, and he’s barely played with. i had to take the initiative to feed him and take him potty yesterday because he’d been locked up in his kennel for almost 24 hours, which is a somewhat common occurrence. 

i’m at the end of my rope. he’s a sweet dog, but i feel horrible that he’s being neglected and it’s causing some serious behavior problems that everyone else is left to deal with. he’s not my dog, so idk why i have to clean up his messes, including scrubbing shit out of my carpet. i’m in a STEM field, i don’t have time to care for someone else’s animal on top of my own— i have a cat and not a dog for a reason. 

when my cat makes a mess, i clean it up immediately. when her dog makes a mess, it’s often left for someone else to clean. i make sure my cat has food and water— her dog drinks all my cat’s water bc she never gives him any. i’m worried my cat is going to get a uti (again) because as soon as his water is filled, the dog drinks it all. 

our house is also COVERED in hair because he sheds an insane amount, and she won’t brush his fur frequently. i try to vacuum frequently to combat it, but that last time i cleaned out the vacuum there was enough hair to make a fucking rug. it’s funny, because she has complained about everyone not doing their share of the chores, but i’ve often been one pulling wads of dog hair out of the vacuum and sweeping up all the dander. she also knows i have a mild dog allergy and i cannot count how many times i’ve gotten sick, or my eyes have swollen up, from the dog hair EVERYWHERE.

idk what to do. my roommate and i have been good, close friends since we started college, but i’m getting really frustrated that she 1. got a dog that’s a mix of two extremely hyper, working breeds and didn’t do any sort of research, 2. is leaving me and our other housemates to care for him when she wants to go out all day, and 3. will not take responsibility for the constant messes he makes, nor will she make any changes to fix it. i really, truly don’t want to have to report animal abuse and ruin our friendship, but i’m about to lose my mind.

The hum has persisted for a while.

Sometimes it deepens until the walls vibrate like a struck bell, other times it fades so low I think it’s gone—until silence proves louder. Rourke says the turbine couplers are stabilizing, but I don’t believe it. The sound feels *alive*, breathing through the metal.

Pre Dive preparations started at 0500. South Ridge survey. Depth forty thousand. Quill practically ran to the bay when she heard; her laughter echoed off the bulkheads like someone else was laughing with her.

Rourke’s voice over the intercom: “Mission window: six hours. Maintain tether comms at all times. No deviation from grid path.”  
 He always says that, like reciting a prayer he’s afraid will stop working if he skips a word.



In the dive bay, condensation falls from the ceiling like rain. The suits hang from racks—gleaming carapaces of glass fiber and steel. Quill checks each seal twice, humming under her breath. Mirren kneels beside the *Nereid* submersible, running diagnostics on the ballast systems. Ilyin oversees everything from the observation window, expression unreadable behind the glass.

I monitor the pressure feeds from the console. My station hums with quiet beeps; pale blue bars climb the screen as oxygen lines prime.

Pike appears beside me, chewing on a ration stick. “Bet she pushes past depth limit before Rourke even notices.”

“She won’t,” I say, though I’m not sure.

“She will. Can’t help herself. The deep’s her church.” He grins, teeth flashing in the dull light. “You’ll see.”

Across the bay, Kessler observes from the upper catwalk, jotting notes in her ledger. She doesn’t look up when she speaks. “Behavioral variance pre-dive is elevated. Adrenal response in Quill and Mirren both exceed baseline.”

Rourke ignores her. “Launch in five.”

The air tastes like oil and anticipation.



The *Nereid* drops through the moon pool with a hiss of displaced air. Its floodlights flare, painting the water beneath the Array into a milky cylinder that vanishes almost immediately into black.

I switch my headset to the external channel.

**Rourke:** “Control, status.”  
 **Me:** “Telemetry stable. Depth ten thousand and holding.”  
 **Quill:** “Feels like glass out here. Visibility maybe fifteen meters.”  
 **Mirren:** “No drift yet. We’re good.”

Their voices are muffled by static, as if spoken through thick cloth. Beyond them, only the rhythmic ping of sonar—like a heartbeat echoing through infinite water.

At fifteen thousand, the pressure readings spike. I adjust ballast protocols to compensate. Tiny fractures in sound—the creak of the hull—slide through the feed.

“Copy,” I say. “Maintain descent.”

Outside, nothing but the black and the faint glow of the submersible’s lights flickering through the external cameras. Sometimes a small organism drifts across the lens, translucent and strange, flashes of bioluminescence fading as quickly as thought.

At thirty thousand feet, they pass into the trench wall. The floodlights sweep across towers of basalt rising from the seabed like ruined cathedrals.

**Quill:** “Beautiful down here. Looks alive.”  
 **Mirren:** “Everything’s alive until it isn’t.”



Reyes’s voice breaks in from the comm room, crackling with interference. “Control, I’m getting reflection on channel C—bearing one-two-eight, slope two degrees east.”

I pull up the sonar map. A faint echo blooms across the screen, an irregular shape embedded in the ridge. Not metal. Not vent gas. Solid.

**Quill:** “Visual confirmation incoming.”

The feed adjusts as her camera pans.

At first I think it’s just rock—a boulder fused into the cliff. But the longer I look, the harder it is to see it as random. The symmetry is wrong. Too deliberate.

It looks like something coiled within the basalt, limbs drawn inward, the impression of ribs arcing beneath translucent stone.

**Mirren:** “What the hell is that?”  
 **Quill:** “You seeing this, Array?”  
 **Me:** “Confirmed visual.”

Silence follows, broken only by the soft hiss of their oxygen feeds.

Ilyin’s voice finally cuts in, calm and sharp. “Record all data. Do not approach within fifty meters until spectral scan is complete.”

**Quill:** “Looks fossilized.”  
 **Ilyin:** “It’s not.”

The statement hangs there, unchallenged.



Back on the Array, Rourke leans over my shoulder, eyes narrowed at the monitors. “Could be a rock formation.”

Ilyin shakes her head. “Formations don’t emit magnetic harmonics.”

Indeed, the sensors show faint oscillations radiating from the object—slow pulses, just below audible frequency. I can feel them in my teeth.

Rourke folds his arms. “Mark the coordinates and move on. We’ll review once the samples come back.”

**Quill:** “Captain, the ridge surface around it looks fragile. If it shifts, we lose the window.”  
 **Rourke:** “Understood. We move on.”

There’s static. Then Quill’s voice again, quieter. “Copy.”

Mirren doesn’t speak.

They steer the *Nereid* along the ridge, floodlights sweeping the anomaly one last time. The camera catches a shimmer—just a trick of refraction, probably—but it looks like movement. A ripple beneath stone.

I rub my eyes. “Did you see—”

Pike cuts me off. “Visual interference. Ignore it.”

I pretend to.



The sub ascends in silence. Six hours from launch to dock. When they breach the pool, the deck lights flicker once, twice, then hold.

Mirren exits first, peeling off his helmet. His eyes are wide, pupils blown. “Pressure gradient’s weird. Felt like we were being pushed back.”

Quill follows, face pale beneath her grin. “You should’ve seen it up close. Looked like… glass wrapped around bone.”

Rourke orders decontamination protocols before anyone speaks further. The suits hiss as the sterilizing mist fills the chamber. Ilyin stands behind the observation glass, writing faster than I can follow.

When it’s done, the crew disperses. Ilyin stays behind, staring at the empty suits like they might start breathing again.



I check the logs. The anomaly’s pulse registered only once—then vanished. Yet when I replay the sonar audio, there’s a new undertone beneath the pings: a faint rhythm, almost melodic, syncing perfectly with the station’s hum.

For a moment, I swear it beats in time with my pulse.

The day after the dive, everything sounds slightly out of tune.  
 The engines hum at the same frequency, the vents breathe the same recycled air, yet something in the pitch feels wrong—like a note struck half a key lower. Nobody says anything at breakfast, but I can tell they all hear it. We chew faster. Drink in silence.

Quill keeps tapping her boot under the table. “Tell me someone’s looking at that recording,” she says.

Ilyin doesn’t glance up from her tablet. “Already analyzing.”

Rourke cuts in. “And until analysis is complete, the site remains off-limits. No speculation, no theories.”

Quill scoffs. “We all saw it.”

Rourke’s tone sharpens. “You saw a formation.”

Kessler writes something on her pad, the scratch of pen louder than their voices.



Later, in control, I review the footage frame by frame. The lights of the *Nereid* sweep over the ridge; for two seconds, the fossilized form is clear. Then static corrupts the image.

I slow it again. Beneath the noise, a flicker—one frame only—shows the figure’s arm extended differently, as if it moved between shots. The metadata insists no frames are missing.

When I blink, the screen looks normal.

Pike leans over my shoulder. “Compression glitch,” he says. “Don’t start seeing ghosts.”

“Sure.”

But when he leaves, I run the sequence again. Same flicker. Same impossible motion.



By the second day, tension leaks through the corridors like condensation.

Quill hums to herself, repeating the same four notes. Mirren asks her to stop; she swears she hasn’t been humming.  
 Reyes claims someone’s been using the comm line after lights-out. “Heard breathing on channel A,” he tells me. “Thought it was you.”  
 “I was asleep.”  
 “Then who was saying my name?”

I don’t answer. The hum from the generators drowns out everything else.



Kessler begins nightly evaluations.  
 Small room. Bright lights. Chair against the wall. She records each session onto a physical tape deck—says analog can’t be corrupted the same way digital can.

“How are you feeling?” she asks.

“Fine.”

“Any dreams?”

“Yes.”

“Of?”

“The trench. But… closer. As if the station isn’t above it anymore, just hanging inside it.”

She writes something down. “That’s not unusual. Depth shifts perception.”

“What about the others?”

“Everyone’s adjusting differently.”

When I stand to leave, she stops the recorder, then quietly adds, “If you notice gaps—moments you don’t remember—come to me first.”

I want to ask what she means, but she’s already looking past me toward the door.



The comm line crackles during mid-shift.

**Reyes:** “Control, you seeing this? Channel’s looping again.”  
 **Me:** “Looping what?”  
 **Reyes:** “Ourselves.”

His voice repeats half a second later, identical cadence. Then another, slightly distorted, following behind.

**Reyes (faint):** “Ourselves … ourselves …”

Rourke storms in, kills the feed manually. The silence that follows feels heavier than the noise.

“Fault in the relay,” he mutters, though his jaw is tight. “Run diagnostics.”

I do. The system reports nominal. No fault found.



Ilyin keeps the lights dimmed in the research bay. The fossil scans loop across her monitors: heat signatures, resonance graphs, magnetic patterns.

When I step inside, she doesn’t look up. “You’ve seen this?”

She points to a waveform pulsing on one screen. The signal mirrors the Array’s core frequency—except it’s inverted, a perfect negative.

“Whatever that thing is,” she says, “it’s reflecting us. Mimicking the station’s heartbeat.”

“You told Rourke?”

“He’d call it coincidence.”

The waveform trembles, then stabilizes.

For a moment, I swear I hear a low tone under the machines—faint, like someone humming behind the wall. Ilyin doesn’t react. Maybe she can’t hear it.



When I check the maintenance reports that night, there are entries under my ID from hours I didn’t work:

03:27 — Turbine pressure manually recalibrated.  
 03:44 — Ventilation purge initiated.

The signatures match my own.

I replay the security feed from those hours. The corridor outside engineering is empty. Yet when the log marks 03:27, the camera static ripples—just for a second—as if someone passed too close.

Pike swears it’s packet corruption. “Whole system’s overdue for updates.”

Maybe. But when I sign out, my reflection in the console screen lags half a second behind.



Mirren finds me in the galley at what passes for midnight, nursing cold coffee.

“You notice anything… off?” he asks.

“Define off.”

He hesitates. “Since the dive, Quill flinches when I speak. Says I sound different. Same words, same tone—but not me.”

“Maybe she’s tired.”

“Maybe.” He stares at his hands. “I keep thinking about that thing down there. The way the ridge looked—like it wasn’t rock but skin turned to stone.”

Neither of us speaks for a long time. Then he says, “Sometimes I think the ocean remembers what it swallows.”

I don’t tell him I’ve started believing that too.



Third night after the dive. The hum changes again. Louder, steadier. There’s rhythm now—a double beat followed by a pause.

I run a spectrum analysis on the audio sensors out of curiosity. The waveform matches human cardiac rhythm at rest: sixty-four beats per minute.

For a moment, I can’t tell if it’s coming from the walls or from inside me.



# My final log that night:

“Station integrity nominal. Crew exhibiting mild disorientation. Anomalies in system logs unresolved.  
 The hum has stabilized into pattern. Possibly harmonic resonance from the southern ridge, though the frequency suggests intent.  
 When I listen long enough, it almost sounds like words—like something trying to remember how to speak.”

I stop the recording. The speakers vibrate softly, echoing the last phrase back at me, distorted but unmistakable.

*“…remember how to speak…”*

The power flickers once, then steadies.

Somewhere deep below, the trench answers with a single pulse.



The hum has learned a rhythm.  
 It rises through the decks like a slow pulse — two beats, pause, two beats again — steady as breathing. Nobody mentions it aloud anymore. We all pretend it’s machinery, a background we’ve grown used to, the way sailors pretend not to hear the sea whispering through the hull.

Rourke calls another dive.



We gather in the command room, half lit by sonar screens and the wan glow of the overhead strips. Rourke’s face looks carved from the same metal as the walls.

“Follow-up survey,” he says. “Southern ridge. Confirm stability, collect spectro samples. Standard procedure.”

No one believes it’s standard, but nobody argues.

Quill leans back in her chair, restless energy coiled under the surface. “Copy that, Captain. Routine stroll through hell.”

Mirren studies the display quietly; he hasn’t smiled in days.

Ilyin speaks without looking up from her data pad. “The anomaly’s coordinates shifted point-three meters since the last dive. Could be tectonic creep. Could be something else.”

Rourke cuts her off. “We confirm, not theorize.”

Kessler scribbles something in her book. “Crew cohesion remains adequate,” she murmurs, as if reassuring herself.



In the dive bay, everything smells of lubricant and brine. Condensation drips like a slow rain over the submersible’s hull. Quill suits up with mechanical precision, sealing clasps, testing joints. Mirren checks the oxygen mix twice, lips pressed tight.

Ilyin watches from behind the glass. “Transmit continuous telemetry. Any deviation, you abort.”

Quill gives a half-salute. “If it starts singing, we’ll hum along.”

No one laughs.

I take my place in control. My monitors glow a dull blue, displaying heart rates, pressure readings, internal cabin feeds. Pike hovers behind me, muttering about magnetism and faulty sensors. The hum vibrates through the consoles; it feels like the station itself is listening.



The *Nereid* slides through the moon pool, floodlights carving cones of milky green that fade almost instantly into black. Static rolls through the comm channel — soft, like breath against glass.

**Rourke:** “Depth check.”  
 **Me:** “Five thousand and falling.”  
 **Quill:** “Visibility zero-five meters. Current negligible.”  
 **Mirren:** “All systems nominal.”

The descent feels slower this time. Or maybe the dark has thickened. Pressure murmurs against the hull; the microphones catch faint groans like distant thunder.

At twenty-five thousand, the floodlights sweep a cliff face. Basalt ridges jut like frozen waves. Particles of sediment drift by, glinting like dust in sunlight — except there’s no light here, only the illusion of it.

**Quill:** “Approaching ridge base. Sensors online.”

Ilyin leans close to the screen. “Focus camera two.”

The image stabilizes: the same trench wall, but different. The basalt around the anomaly has softened, edges blurred. The fossilized figure is clearer now — spine bowed, limbs half-unfurled, the suggestion of fingers pressed outward against the stone.

“Temperature?” I ask.

**Mirren:** “Reading two degrees above ambient. That can’t be right.”  
 **Quill:** “The rock’s warm.”

Static hisses.

**Rourke:** “Confirm, Nereid.”  
 **Quill:** “I said the rock’s warm, Captain.”



They hover closer. Floodlights sweep across the ridge. For an instant, a shimmer moves beneath the basalt, like something alive turning over in its sleep.

**Mirren:** “Did you see—”

The feed erupts in white. A single flash — blinding, impossible — bursts from the trench below. Every monitor in control blanks out. The hum spikes so high it becomes a roar.

“Control to Nereid, respond!”

Only static. Then, faintly—

**Quill:** “—we’re here.”

The voice is hers, but wrong. A fraction too slow, a fraction too deep.

“Status?”

Silence. Then Mirren’s voice, strained. “Systems flickered. She’s fine. We’re fine.”

The video feed returns. The ridge is unchanged. The fossil still embedded, motionless.

**Rourke:** “Abort and return.”

**Quill:** “Copy… returning.”

But as the *Nereid* ascends, one of the external cameras catches a reflection along the cliff — another light, dim and moving in the opposite direction, descending deeper into the trench.

I don’t report it. Neither does anyone else.



The sub breaches the pool two hours later. Steam fills the bay. Quill climbs out first, face pale beneath the helmet glass. Her movements are deliberate, too controlled. Mirren follows, unsteady on his feet.

“Radiation spike?” Rourke asks.

“Negative,” Mirren says. “All readings within norm.” His voice shakes.

Quill doesn’t answer him. She’s staring at the moon pool, at the water still rippling though the engines have stopped. “It was moving,” she whispers. “It wasn’t the lights. It moved.”

Rourke’s jaw tightens. “Debrief in twenty. Disinfect and rest.”

He leaves before she can argue.



In those twenty minutes, I discreetly check system logs. During the blackout, every monitoring channel recorded the same pattern: a perfect sine wave at sixty-four beats per minute — identical to the station’s hum.

And buried under the audio, so low it barely registers, a voice-like modulation. When isolated and amplified, it forms a single syllable repeated again and again.

*“Down.”*

I delete the file before saving the report.

The hum hasn’t stopped since.

1oeg6m4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oeg6m4,Fragrance review and recommendations,"Hi!

I’m new to exploring fragrances in depth and I thought I’d turn to this community. After reading posts here for a while, this is my first one!

I generated a panel to analyze my perfume preferences. I shared a few fragrances I own or have tried recently, along with short notes on what I liked or disliked about each. Since I’m still learning the terminology, I mostly described the impressions or associations each scent gives me rather than using technical fragrance language.

When I'd heard word that Howard Skies, founder of High Skies Entertainment, was A. still alive somehow and B. Had turned to making propaganda for the Meier regime, I was pissed.

When he invited me and the Jacket to his old studio outside Portland, Oregon (which had somehow got through the Glassing mostly intact), we were suspicious, to say the least.

However, the letter, on its oh-so-whimsical custom stationary reading ""From The Desk Of Howard Skies"" at the top in fancy, off-beat lettering, never said anything about bringing a +1.

So my darling Katha came along for the ride!

She's a blood-thirsting venpire able to fight her way out of any tight spot, back to back with me and Jacket.

She's my floofy freedom fighter.

She's a rocker, a roller, an outta-controller.

She's the love of my life.

Naturally, I took part in a dark ritual with Katha and Scrymaster to give me a temporary Spider-Man danger sense and to connect the dead man's switch of the old Skalgan nuke we hid in Meier's palace basement to my heartrate, and set off.

*This is either gonna be our deaths, or the funniest shit ever.*

*And if it's the first…*

***I'm gonna make it hilarious!***

MEMORY TRANSCRIPTION SUBJECT: Scorched Jacket (Old Breed revolutionary and freedom fighter)

We three entered the cast-iron and stone gates of the High Skies Entertainment studio campus (although with the fortifications added, it's more a compound now).

**KR-KAM!**

With a final-sounding noise, the gates slammed shut behind us.

*Well, no way out but forwards, and if this kills us Meier is gonna fucking pay.*

It was a snowy winter day, and there were footprints all about, and whimsical-looking, but faded, arrow signs to tell us where to go.

We followed the arrows to a...stage?...which had been set up in a sort of plaza at the base of a set of stairs, carved into rock. One of those temporary outdoor stages used for events back in the before-times.

We could hear whispering behind the curtain.

""If y'all are gonna ambush us, can you at least make it quick? I'd rather get this over with,"" I snarked.

I could faintly hear a voice stage-whisper ""Places, places!""…Then the music started and the curtain rose, and characters I remembered from my childhood began to dance in a synchronized routine, to the tune of the Colonel Bogey March.

""*Ol' Howard*

*He is a great showmaaaan*

*Ol' Howard*

*Entertains the best he caaan*

*He's friends with Meier*

*Survived Fed fire*

*And now he'll help Earth with his greatest plaaaaan!*

I could see The Toyminator from ""Circus Street"" in the background blowing on a tuba, as Anipuppets danced and spun. Peter The Wolf pirouhetted on one claw-toe like a ballet dancer...and wearing the dress too...*What even is this?*

*""Ol' Howard*

*He's really nice you see!*

*Howard*

*Wants to bring back democracy!*

*Isif and Meier-""*

The next few lines were blotted out by Tilly The New Jersey Clown emerging from stage left and bellowing through a bullhorn, ""THAT'S REDACTED, YOUS DON'T GET TO KNOW!""

*""-But one thing that all who are here will agree,*

*He's introduced dra-matically!*

*Well heeeeere he is to talk to yooooou!*

*And hopefully make a deal too!""*

From a trapeze above the stage, an ornate, gold-plated chair descended with a spotlight focused on it.

The chair was empty.

*Wait, wasn't the Colonel Bogey March a song used to mock Hitler? ""Adolf has only got one ball"" and all that? Is he on our side or Meier's? But if he's on Meier's, why are we still alive? What is even happening right now?*

**Click!**

**Creeeeeeeeakkk…**

A rusted iron door creaked open at the top of the stairs.

We three crept up the stairs and went through.

We emerged into a dusty but colorful open room, with cast plastic chairs and tables in primary colors, like adult-sized versions of kids furniture.

**CLANG!**

The door slammed shut behind us.

We could hear distant footsteps from a hallway at the other end of the room, and out of it emerged some kind of humanoid android, with a CRT screen for a head, dressed in Victorian coattails and carrying a cane.

""Sorry I'm late! Betterment Loyalist fan of mine gave me a Paltan fur jacket and I had to make arrangements for 4 funerals and inform the families of the...\*dearly taxidermied...\*and arrange for transport for said families. Betterment, am I right?""

He let out a nervous chuckle.

My thoughts were split between how *fucked up* that gift is and something like ""I guess he *did* upload himself to a digital format and control his company from behind the scenes like Walt's severed head.""

""Well, push me into a sewage facility and call me Nickelback! Who's your ovine companion there?""

Clowny cackled at that. Honestly, I chuckled a little too.

""This is Katha, my girlfriend!""

""Pleased to-""

Howard Skies abruptly stopped talking.

I realized that, as he had been languidly strolling towards us, his cane had gotten left behind in the floor about 5 or 6 steps back, and he was feeling around for the cane's head, like a Looney Tunes character about to fall down.

He slowly tilted forward…

And began to roll.

And on top of this reference to a film from the 1970s, he then mixed it with early-21st century pop culture and began to play *Dark Souls boss music* from the speaker system and holographically project a boss bar from somewhere in the room.

*What is this guy even on?*

Clown was *cackling* like a hyena, Katha looked confused, and I was just kind of ticked off this fella is wasting our time like this.

""Holy real-time holographic gag assistance, Batman!"", Clowny cackled.

Skies rolled upright and pointed a finger.

""Bingo! You won!""

Holographic confetti erupted in a burst around us and gently wafted to the ground as a party horn note rang out, before the ""confetti"" vanished.

""This is all...very funny, but...are we gonna talk about stuff or…,"" I asked, a little irritated.

""Fair enough! To business then!""

Skies knocked some dust off his lapel, real this time.

""Right! Let's get down to business: You are foiling Meier's plans, plans which I kind of need to succeed to restore democracy in the long run.""

*Huh?*

He put his white-gloved hands together.

""I will pay you a very large sum of money to stop *f%#king* blowing sh!t up.""

*Were those cartoon sound effects?*

*Actually, what* is *this guy's play here? What's his angle?*

""...So what's your plan here, Sesame Street? Actually, no, lemme guess, you're gonna answer with 'My plans are beyond your comprehension!' or some other villain crap.""

""My plans? Well, production on 'Rebuilding Circus Street' is wrapping up, I've bought an abandoned railroad on Leirn for long-term kids franchise revival plans, Operation Soup Opera is going great apart from some difficulty sourcing enough rubber lemons-""

*What?!*

""-Project Shark is doing great apart from the part where the meat grinder keeps getting caught on rocks, Project Wall Heater has been foiled by the Feds CO2-cooling certain pieces of critical infrastructure, Project Junkyard Crusher turned out to be trash…""

As he trailed off, I tried to wrap my head around...any of that.

""All other projects, like Dalmatian Coat, Evil Aunt, Jackal, Rhino, Burton-9, and Joker are a go. Project Hunter is going *great* too, finally found some Arnie DNA! Jonathan Hyde still eludes me, though. That particular project has been expanded to include Danko, Kruger, Dutch, and Running Man variants, all on the Arnie frame with Quaid ID partitioning. Lessee... Ooh! I've also got Project Robo-Gadget, Project Flying Monkey, and Project Kevin in the pipeline!""

*...What?*

""...*What?* What does any of that even mean? And why the hell are you glazing the fucked up shit the Meier regime does? Its like you woke up one day and decided to be Joseph Goebbels!""

This *really* pissed him off.

""I'M NOT ANYTHING LIKE GOEBBELS! I'M NOT A F$(KING NAZI! The galaxy is f#cked *beyond all measure*, tyranny is f#cking *everywhere*, and Meier and Isif are the *only ones* trying to make anything better. They've even got a plan to *end* sapient farming and Betterment, and a f#cking *timetable* set up to do it!""

*Oh really? Well now...*

His analog pupils shrunk and he slapped a gloved hand over his simulated mouth.

""F$(kin seriously, boss?""

Tilly The Jersey Clown had poked his head in.

""...You heard nothing. None of the four of you heard anything. You say one word about my slip up to Meier and I'll do you for tax evasion.""

""Not treason?""

""Treason carries the death penalty, tax evasion is just annoying to prove you're not guilty of and carries a hefty prison sentence.""

Clowny nodded.

""So...El Generalissimo and Chief Hunter Isif are planning on ending the whole cannibal lizard Nazi regime? And supplanting it?""

""Yes. And he's agreed that if I help him do so, he will eventually step down and democracy will be restored.""

I snorted.

""And you believed him?""

""I made it clear that I would *kill* him if he didn't, and he just nodded and revealed that he'd named his secretary VI after the Latin phrase for 'You are just a man'.""

*Now that* is *interesting…*

""Anyway, how much money you want to end your bombing campaign? I will pay you to f#ck off with it.""

Clowny chuckled and started to monologue in his best Heath Ledger Joker voice.

""We're men of simple tastes. We like guns, and bombs, and bullets, and gasoline. And you wanna know what the best thing about all of those things is? They're cheap!""

I chuckled, and surprisingly, Skies did too.

""You're not so bad for a fascist bootlicker.""

Skies reared back.

""OK, seriously, what is your guys' deal? I mean, I got the Nolan trilogy reference, but what *do* you guys want?""

""We want opportunities for us Old Breeds, investments in our communities, and most importantly, *an end* to the forced conversion. Otherwise, the Feds fucking *win.*""

Skies ""blinked"" for a few seconds.

""You're...gonna have to explain that one to me.""

Clowny cut in.

""The Feds wanted to kill us all for being 'predators', didn't they? And New and Old Breeds aren't sexually compatible, at least not to my knowledge. Thus, they are of a separate species, technically. Replacing or converting the entirety of humanity into a twisted, predatory *parody* of ourselves is validating both Betterment and the Federation by feeding into the false predator-prey dichotomy. But hey, parody *is* protected under fair use laws. And if what I just said sounded racist, it is. But I've been at the receiving end of much worse. Yes, there's bigotry against Old Breeds, who are seen as a waste of space, a leftover remnant of the past, to be ground into the *dust* in order to build a future. I've been told I'm a waste of space, an evolutionary dead end. I've been told to kill myself. We Old Breeds have been left behind, scrounging fro scraps. We have only three career paths left open to us right now: subsidence farming, Mad Max scavenger of the ruins of the old world, or *our* path. All legit career paths other than the first two? Closed. Even the ones that don't *need* super-enhanced physical strength.""

Skies was silent for a few seconds.

""Let me connect you with Elias, hold on a sec.""

Before either of us could do more than pull out our weapons, Skies had projected a holographic interface from his wrist and made a video call.

The person who picked up on the other end, bleary-eyed, was…

*Oh shit it's THAT Elias. Elias Meier.*

""Howard, it's 4 o clock in the fucking morning on my end. Why the *fuck* did you call?...Is that the Jacket and the Clown? Why did…""

Meier's eyes widened and then he *glowered.*

""If you sons of bitches hurt my friend, annoying as he may be, I'll-""

""Whoa, whoa, calm down Elias! I'm fine! They've...honestly got some good points, apart from the whole 'terrorism' thing.""

*Huh?*

Elias Meier blinked a few times, then pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed.

""And *what* are their 'good points' exactly?""

""I'll just play back what they told me.""

An audio recording of Clowny giving his speech on the topic of Old Breed rights played.

As it went on, Meier's face turned from angry...to thoughtful.

""Hmm...Looks like reforms will be necessary...Tell you what. Howard! If you could set up a list of needed reforms and a timetable to enact them, I'll do them.""

*Huh???*

""...Just like that?"", I said in baffled awe.

Skies cut in.

""In my experience, Elias does his very best to do right by humanity. By ordinary people. And yeah, things fucking suck right now. But things suck even *more* in the Federation, and *way more* in the Betterment-held parts of the United Dominion.""

""Is that why Isif and Meier are gonna overthrow the Prophet?""

Howard Skies gasped in surprise.

""HOWARD! YOU TOLD THEM?!""

""I-it slipped out...I got angry…I'm sorry...""

Meier blinked a few times, slouched back, and sighed.

""I need some fucking coffee…I'm gonna go get some and then we can come up with the start of a list of ideas for improving the lot of Old Breeds when I get back. I might get some bacon and eggs, too.""

*Dammit, Meier, now I'm hungry!*

As Meier got up and walked off camera, I sensed a presence behind me.

*Are we being backstabbed after all?*

I whirled around to see…

A life-size version of Bud-D-Bot, the favorite friendly companion toy of the 2060s, in all its blue plastic glory, pushing a cart full of crackers, that weird liver paste rich people like, and expensive-looking cheeses, alongside a plate of toast and a jar of jam.

""Thanks, Bud-D-Bot, I was getting hungry,"" Skies said.

*Huh?*

I looked over at him to see the CRT screen of his ""face"" break in two like some kind of horror movie monster and reveal a set of uncannily realistic teeth and a gaping hole.

He made an elaborate triple-decker sandwich with intermediate cracker layers and ate it in one bite.

""Oh, sh#t, I forgot about the Clown's girlfriend! Sorry, I'll get a vegan option-""

""No need!""

She spread a huge heap of pate on a piece of toast, bared her sharp, carnivore teeth, and *devoured* it.

Skies reared back in a moment of *fear* before blinking in confusion.

""...Where'd you say your girlfriend was from?""

""I'm from the Black City, the legendary city of darkness on Nightside where Molech, God of predators and brother of Solgalick, waits and dreams in the deep of his tower.""

She pulled a *postcard* out of her wool and handed it to Skies.

""'Song of my soul, my voice is dead, die thou, unsung, as tears unshed shall dry and die in the Black City…Um...okay..."" Skies said, unease in his voice.

Clowny cut in.

""How bout this: That promise you made to kill Meier if he goes full tyrant? If you go full tyrant...Katha and her people will do it to *you*.""

Skies' analog face went from uneasy...to thoughtful.

""Fair enough...I think we'll work well together…I need a drink...""

- Taking ashwagandha, d3, and C supplements


- No physical conditions of note


I smoke marijuana and drink alcohol sometimes but had neither for about a week prior to my blood draw. I drink caffeine daily, not exceeding 2 cups of coffee, but I did not have any prior to the draw either.


I get hormone bloodwork done semi-regularly, 2 days ago was no different except they took twice as much blood. It was done in my left arm. The spot itself still hurts to touch and my arm and hand have been feeling weak. I can still use both but it really starts to hurt and feel numb if I put too much strain, which isn't very much either (I couldn't confidently hold a coffee cup without risk of spilling). I also tried to wash my hair and I couldn't scrub and keep the arm up without the same thing happening. I had a vasovagal response soon after the draw was done and I lost consciousness for about 30 seconds but as far as I can tell I was sitting in a chair so I don't think I injured the arm.

Everything went fine, I've got 2 big stones from the 5 in a jar home with me.
The surgeon wanted me to 2 in the first place for the night, but if I felt oke when I woke up, I could go home with a bunch of morfine.
So after I got some coffee and something too eat and unfortunately extra morfine cuz of the pain i went home.

The operation took 1 hour and 10 min, stayed in recovery for 2 hours and was released!

I uploaded some links with the stones and the bandages wounds.

Just like last week, none of the conditioners made a huge change to the leather’s color. So quit stressing and just use your favorite high-quality stuff. Every pair of Nicks leaves the shop with aNicks Grease sample, and you can grab larger containers on our site. We also carry Smith’s Leather Balm, which is awesome for belts, wallets, and bags too.

Happy conditioning, friends.

You can work during the day and still have mountains, coffee, and great weather right outside your window.

The visa process looked simple at first, but the language barrier was tougher than I expected. Most official emails and sites are in Spanish, and even government offices rarely speak English. I ended up using colombia law connection, and it made things a lot smoother since they actually have native English speakers who helped with translations and paperwork.

1oefr1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Informal_Effect/comments/1oefr1o/single_use_society_from_people_to_plastics/,Single use society: from people to plastics.,"There is a quiet and pervasive mindset that defines our modern era, captured in a single, powerful observation: from people to plastics, everything seems to be single use and disposable. What began as a revolution in consumer convenience has subtly evolved into a cultural worldview, one that is costing us far more than we ever anticipated.
This ""throwaway culture"" was born in the post war boom of the 1950s, sold to us as a life of ease. The plastic water bottle, the single use coffee cup, the shrink wrapped vegetable all were symbols of a clean, effortless, and forward moving society. We embraced the convenience of using something once and simply tossing it ""away."" The problem, we've learned, is that there is no ""away."" Our oceans now choke on 199 million tons of plastic, and our wildlife is entangled in the remnants of our fleeting convenience.
The cost has become even more personal. This plastic waste, never truly disappearing, has broken down into microplastics. These particles are now in our water, our food, and our bodies. The very materials we designed to be disposable have become a permanent and invasive part of our environment and our biology, with researchers finding them in our blood, lungs, and organs.
Perhaps the most profound cost, however, is that this disposable mindset has not remained confined to our kitchen pantries and garbage bins; it has seeped into our social lives. We are at risk of viewing people through the same lens we view products.
We are conditioned to value what is new, fast, and frictionless. When relationships, friendships or romantic partnerships become difficult, require repair, or demand patient, inconvenient work, the throwaway culture whispers that it’s easier to simply replace them. Online, a seemingly endless catalogue of new connections is just a click away, much like a new item on a digital shelf. This can foster a crippling lack of resilience, a tendency to dispose of a relationship at the first sign of imperfection rather than investing the effort to mend it.",3,1761254874.0,Informal_Effect,6,1.0,False

1oefowb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oman/comments/1oefowb/unpopular_opinion_most_coffee_lovers_in_oman_dont/,Unpopular opinion: Most “coffee lovers” in Oman don’t actually like coffee — they like coffee-flavoured milkshakes.,"
Be honest if your “morning coffee” has caramel drizzle, whipped cream, vanilla syrup, and milk that’s 90% of the cup… you’re not drinking coffee. You’re having dessert with a caffeine side quest 👀

Every time someone proudly says, “I can’t start my day without coffee,” I see them holding a cup that’s 90% milk, 9% sugar syrup, and maybe 1% coffee if we’re being generous. Like babe, that’s not caffeine — that’s a melted ice cream with identity issues.

I swear some cafés here could just rename their drinks to “liquid tiramisu” and no one would notice. 

Meanwhile, the few of us who actually enjoy a proper black coffee get side-eyed like we’re drinking jet fuel. Excuse you Ma’am, but our coffee tastes like burnt earth and regret, and that’s exactly how we like it. No sugar, no foam art, no nonsense. You think you love coffee? Try drinking it black at 6 a.m. after 3 hours of sleep, that’s when the universe reveals itself.

So yeah, enjoy your caramel vanilla iced frappé cloud dream rainbow sprinkles. I’ll be over here sipping motor oil and contemplating life. ☕️

1oefm1m,https://i.redd.it/fe3ztwyyhxwf1.jpeg,Community Building Isn’t About Making Everyone Happy; It’s About Making Progress,"There’s a certain point in any good community project where someone crosses their arms, leans back in their folding chair, and declares that you’ve lost your mind.

This, I’ve learned, is the moment you know you’re on the right track. Because if no one’s uncomfortable, you’re probably not changing anything. You’re just passing around casseroles and pretending that togetherness alone solves problems.

I used to think community building was about harmony. I imagined people holding hands in a circle, someone strumming a guitar, and a shared sense of hope floating through the air like the faint smoke from a fair-trade incense stick.

But reality can really have a way of smashing through that image with the subtlety of a supped-up lawnmower. Communities, it turns out, are messy. They are powered by friction, like old engines that need a little grinding to move forward.

The quote ***“If you’re not pissing somebody off, you’re not doing it right”*** has been attributed to various people who were probably good at pissing people off. It’s the unofficial slogan of every successful movement, from neighborhood cleanups to civil rights. The people who never irritate anyone are the ones who hold meetings that end with everyone agreeing to “form a subcommittee” and never speaking of it again.

When you decide to build something real in your community, *you quickly find out who’s truly on board and who just likes the idea of things changing as long as nothing actually changes*.

The woman who loves your vision for a “community garden” might not love it quite as much when the garden replaces her unofficial parking spot. The neighborhood coffee shop, run by ironic hipsters, that praises “collaboration” may lose enthusiasm when collaboration means sharing customers.

Everyone supports transformation in theory. **The problem is that transformation, by its very nature, transforms things; and people have grown very attached to their things*****.***

Every meaningful act of community building pokes at comfort zones. You want to start a time bank? Someone will insist it sounds like socialism. You want to open a free clinic? Someone else will suggest you’re enabling laziness. You could launch a neighborhood recycling drive and someone would accuse you of being anti-freedom because they don’t want the city telling them what to do with their bottles.

The great irony of trying to bring people together is that you must first survive their collective disapproval.

I’ve come to think of irritation as a byproduct of moral physics. **The more force you apply to make the world better, the more resistance you create in return**. It’s not a sign you’re failing; it’s proof you’ve left the shallow end. The key is not to go looking for conflict, but to stop fearing it.

If you’re upsetting a few people because you’re challenging old habits or power structures, you’re probably doing sacred work. If you’re upsetting everyone because you’re just an ass, that’s different. But the line between courage and arrogance is one you can only find by walking it.

Community building is a little like hosting a block party where half the guests bring food and the other half bring opinions. The trick is to feed them all anyway. You learn to take criticism as a sign of engagement. When people start talking (really talking, not just nodding politely) you’ve got momentum. Passion is rarely polite.

So I’ve made peace with the idea that I’ll never please everyone. If my work in the community makes a few people roll their eyes, grumble on Facebook, or mutter under their breath at H-E-B, I take it as a small badge of honor. Progress has always been unpopular in its early drafts. The goal is not to avoid offending anyone; it’s to offend the right people for the right reasons.

If everyone in your neighborhood agrees with everything you do, it’s a sign you’re maintaining the status quo, not improving it. But when someone accuses you of rocking the boat, smile and remind them that boats are designed to move.

So build your community. Start your movement. Annoy the complacent. Disturb the comfortable. If you’re not pissing somebody off, you’re not doing it right; and if you are, you might just be doing something that matters.

[Join us](https://kommunitykoin.com/) in making the world a better place. You’ll be glad that you did.

Cheers, friends.

1oefl1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1oefl1t/day_15_of_fast_with_disability/,Day 15 of fast with disability,"Day 15 of a strict water fast (with electrolytes). I do have to still take my medicines though. I am a newbie, never fasted before. Have some extreme personal life things going on, and figured I would take control of things in my life that I can.

Day 0 -> Day 15

Age: 43

SW: 316

CW: 276  
Height: 6'

BP was \~130/89, now \~105/75  
Creatinine up slightly

Down a few pants sizes at least, but haven't really paid much attention. Clothes aren't as tight at least.

I have a disability that causes my muscles to move pretty constantly, which may actually help in some of the weight loss. It has also shown me that the symptoms have nothing to do with my diet. I was very active before I started down the health degeneration path, but I gained the weight because the disability prevents me from exercising. That being said I don't exercise anymore.

I had to go in for treatments for my condition and was worried I wouldn't make it through them, left me a bit more exhausted but I survived.

How long will I go? I am not sure, just taking day by day so far. Figure I probably have another 100+ days before I start to have issues, so kind of book-ending it with that.

I take the recommended electrolytes and kind of hated it at first, now I imagine I am eating something yummy like a salty piece of steak or something and it becomes my ""meal"". I have to keep them up for my muscles in general so it's nothing particularly new to me.

I just started a few extra supplements to try to make sure I don't cause too many problems.

TUDCA because I started out planning on drinking coffee with a little creamer, but just kind of forgot about it.

BCAA

Calcium / Phosphate powder on the way.

Have had issues with:

Nosebleeds - I dont really understand this one, if anyone has suggestions

Lots of bathroom trips w/ pretty crazy results. Unsure how without consuming food, but here I am!

Dizzy lightheaded a bunch

Sleep hasn't been great, though that could just be personal issues.

I help make food for my son still and have taken him out to eat and things without much of a problem. I find I am enjoying the smell of food sometimes and I can pretend I am eating it or something. Not really hungry that much, but my stomach does still growl sometimes.

I have a few food items I really miss the taste for. Spicy Poke and Kalbi w/ fried rice.

Obviously I enjoyed food, and do miss the flavor is the biggest thing.

A little history for weight.  I was in a point I couldn't walk from disability, and balooned up to 340.  I had surgery and was able to walk, dropped to 280 because I could hike and do the things I enjoyed.  Over 7 years I kept it off and was in the 280-290 range.  Recently in the last year I was back up to 316 because I lost the ability to exercise.

If anyone has any questions I would be glad to answer. Sorry for no progress pics, maybe I will eventually take some.",6,1761254464.0,fasting,3,1.0,False

1oefiog,https://www.reddit.com/r/Edinburgh/comments/1oefiog/sorodough_edinburgh/,Sorodough - Edinburgh,"Hi guys, I started baking sourdough at home and I m thinking about selling homemade sourdough at reasonable prices. Do you guys think it’s something that’s gonna work? I stay in Leith and there is a lot of pastry places/ coffee shops and a couple places that sell sourdough, just not sure about it since I don’t have an actual business. Any thoughts? 

P.S: I m pregnant and a SAHM, it’s more of a hobby that I would like to explore more and would be nice to make a bit of side income while also giving something to the community. 

Thanks 

Hi guys, quick updates to answer your questions and I appreciate everyone who took the time to comment/ get back to me. 

- I have 8 years experience managing different coffee shops around Edinburgh, I also run my own business for a while. So I m aware of the hygiene and regulations related to anything food related. But I m not really looking to make it into a big business or anything tbh which is why I m asking for opinions, i m pregnant at the moment and its more of a hobby, so I was hoping to just run it through word of mouth, friends etc and have a small loyal base. So it’s not something that I want to expand to spend time creating websites/ going to farmers markets for etc. 
Things might change in the future obviously you never know. 

- marketing wise: planning to just use instagram ( faceless ), just post pictures of the daily loafs, the process, and people will obviously get to see where it’s made/ my kitchen/ the space. I m hoping that would create some kind of trust when they can see where their loafs are made. And obviously word of mouth as said above. 
Please not I also made my own sorodough starter that I use and that I would be happy to share with people. I also recently started making wholemeal sorodough since I started having issues with white flour during to pregnancy. 

- how much it cost and what I find reasonable price: the loaf cost me around 70p for ingredients and electricity, not taking into account my time/ mixer/ dishes etc and I’ve invested quite a lot into kitchen aid but that’s more because I’ve gotten really into it and it’s something I enjoyed. 
When it comes to pricing: Aldi half loaf is around 1.75, so around 3.5£ for a full loaf. Most places I know pastries/ coffee shops sell for 3.5/4£. So I would assume that as it stand selling a normal loaf for 2.50£ would be reasonable to take into consideration the time/ effort it takes. Please note that I do slow fermentation as it’s better for flavour and digestive system, so I don’t do the shaping and baking until next day. 

- how many loafs I can make a day: as it stands I can make around 14 loafs but that’s due to the type of tin I use as I make round sorodough. If I was to sell I would invest in loaf tins that are more convenient and standard for slicing/ toasting/ making sandwiches etc so if I was to do that I can make more than 14. 


As I said before it would be more of something I can do while home, I can get some extra income while also providing something to people. 

I might be overthinking this or it’s unrealistic, please let me know if you guys see any flaws or don’t think it’s gonna work. Thanks a lot. ",2,1761254303.0,Edinburgh,9,0.67,False

1oefffv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Habits/comments/1oefffv/im_38_and_finally_cracked_the_discipline_code/,I'm 38 and finally cracked the discipline code after failing for 15+ years. Here's the system that changed everything.,"I've failed at building discipline more times than most of you have tried. Most of what's taught about discipline is bullshit that looks good on Instagram but fails in real life.

After 15+ years of trial and error, here's what actually works:

* The 2-Day Rule: Never miss the same habit two days in a row. This simple rule has been more effective than any complex tracking system.
* Decision Minimization: I prep my workspace, clothes, and meals the night before. Eliminating these small decisions preserves mental energy for important work.
* The 5-Minute Start: I commit to just 5 minutes of any difficult task. 90% of the time, I continue past 5 minutes once friction is gone.
* Accountability is the highest form of self-love. Every time I feel like procrastinating, I get a motivational message from my past self using [this app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/journai-smart-planner/id6744276337). Nothing more motivating than hearing myself beg.
* Trigger Stacking: I attach new habits to existing behaviors (e.g., stretching during coffee brewing, reading while on exercise bike).
* Weekly Course Correction: Sunday evenings are sacred for reviewing what worked/didn't and adjusting for the coming week.

This isn't sexy advice. It won't get millions of likes on social media. But after thousands spent on books, courses, these simple principles have given me more progress than everything else combined.

1oeff0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/incest_sex_stories/comments/1oeff0r/mothers_wet_awakening_repost/,Mother's wet awakening (repost),"My God, you’re so wet.

It wasn’t a question. It was a husky, awe-filled statement, my voice thick with a desire I’d fought for years. The proof was all over my fingers, glistening in the low light of her bedroom.

Mom’s head fell back against the pillows, a ragged sigh escaping her lips. “It’s all for you, baby. It’s always been for you.”

Her fingers tangled in my hair, pulling me back down to her. My mouth found hers again, a messy, hungry clash of tongues that tasted of coffee and desperation. My other hand, the one not slick with her arousal, cupped the incredible fullness of her breast, my thumb circling a taut nipple through the lace of her bra.

I broke the kiss, breathing hard. “I found them. Your drawer. My boxers.”

Her eyes, dark pools of lust and something like fear, went wide for a split second before a slow, wicked smile spread across her face. No denial. No shame. Just a raw, primal honesty that shot straight to my groin.

“Which ones?” she whispered, her voice a low purr. “The gray ones from Christmas? They’re my favorite. The cotton is so soft… and it smells so much like you.”

Her admission, so blatant, so carnal, shattered the last of my restraint.

*

It had started an hour ago. I was looking for an old photo album in her room, something to show a friend. My hand brushed against the back of her underwear drawer, and I felt something that wasn’t silk or satin. Rough, well-worn cotton.

Curiosity, a strange, coiling feeling in my gut, made me push her delicate things aside. There, hidden beneath a pile of scarves, was a small stash of my own underwear. A pair of boxer briefs I’d thought I’d lost at the gym. Another pair, the gray ones, stained with a distinct, darker patch at the front. They weren’t just stored away; they were used. The faint, musky scent of her arousal, mixed with the faded smell of my own detergent, rose from the fabric.

The door creaked open. “Honey, did you find—?”

She froze in the doorway, her eyes locking onto the evidence in my hands. A deep, crimson blush flooded her cheeks, but she didn’t look away. She just stood there, one hand on the doorframe, her chest rising and falling rapidly under her thin blouse.

The air crackled. The confession hung between us, silent and immense.

“Mom…” I began, but words failed me.

She took a step into the room, then another, her gaze never leaving mine. “I couldn’t help it,” she said, her voice barely a whisper. “You’re… you’re everywhere in this house. Your smell on your towels, your laughter in the halls. I lie in bed at night and I can feel you asleep down the hall. It’s agony.”

She was right in front of me now. I could see the rapid pulse at the base of her throat.

“When your father left… this ache just grew and grew. And the only thing that soothed it… was pretending you were there with me. That it was your weight on me. Your touch.”

Her hand came up, trembling slightly, and brushed against the bulge growing in my jeans. The touch was electric.

“Do you hate me?” she breathed.

In answer, I dropped the boxers and grabbed her, crashing my lips to hers. It was the spark that lit the fuse.

*

Now.

I tore at the clasp of her bra, freeing her magnificent breasts. They spilled into my hands, heavy and warm. I bent my head, taking a pebbled nipple into my mouth, laving it with my tongue, sucking deeply. Her back arched off the bed, a sharp cry tearing from her throat.

“Yes! Oh, God, just like that…”

My hands went to the waistband of her leggings. I yanked them down, along with her panties, in one frantic motion.

And there she was.

The most intimate part of her, laid bare. A lush, beautiful thicket of dark, curling hair, drenched and gleaming. It was wild, untamed, and utterly erotic. I’d never seen anything so perfect in my life.

“It’s so hairy,” I murmured against her stomach, my breath hot on her skin. “So fucking beautiful.”

A sob of relief and need escaped her. “You don’t mind?”

“Mind? I’m going to worship it.”

I slid down the bed, settling between her legs. I buried my face in that soft, wet jungle, inhaling her deep, musky scent. My scent is on her, and hers is on my clothes, and we are a circle of want. My tongue found her core, parting her slick folds to delve into her heat.

She screamed. Her hips bucked wildly off the mattress as I feasted on her, my tongue tracing circles around her clit before sucking it firmly into my mouth. Her taste exploded on my tongue—sweet, salty, utterly addictive. I drove my tongue inside her, fucking her with it, as my thumb pressed rhythmically against her sensitive nub.

“I’m gonna… I can’t… don’t stop!” she chanted, her voice breaking.

I didn’t stop. I redoubled my efforts, pressing my whole face into her, drowning in her. Her thighs clamped around my head as her orgasm ripped through her, a violent, shaking tremor that made her cry out my name over and over.

I kissed my way back up her trembling body. I was painfully hard, my cock straining against my jeans. She reached for my belt with frantic hands, fumbling with the buckle.

“I need to feel you,” she panted. “All of you. I need you inside me. Now.”

She finally got my jeans and boxers down, and my erection sprang free, slapping against my stomach. Her eyes widened at the sight, and a hungry sound rumbled in her chest. She wrapped her hand around me, her touch firm and knowing, stroking my length, smearing the precum beading at the tip.

“You’re so big, baby,” she moaned. “I’ve dreamed of this.”

She guided me to her entrance. The head of my cock pressed against her unbelievable wetness, nudging through that soft, damp hair. We both gasped at the contact.

I looked into her eyes, dark with a lifetime of hidden longing. “Are you sure?”

“I’ve never been more sure of anything,” she said, pulling my hips down to hers. “Just… take what’s yours.”

I pushed forward.

The sensation was blinding. An intense, velvety heat enveloped me, drawing me in, swallowing me whole. She was so tight, so incredibly wet, every nerve ending in my body screaming in ecstasy. I sank into her depths until our bodies were flush, until I was buried to the hilt inside the woman who gave me life.

We both went utterly still for a heart-stopping moment, our eyes locked, the immensity of what we were doing hanging in the air. Then a slow, deep smile spread across her face, pure bliss and triumph.

“Finally,” she sighed, her body clenching around me. “You’re home.”

1oefard,https://www.reddit.com/r/GamblingAddiction/comments/1oefard/is_my_partner_a_gambling_addict_crypto/,Is my partner a gambling addict? (Crypto).,"For context we have a 2 year old and we have been together 5 years. When we met he always took very good care of me financially, although I was always working full time and paying my half. But he would take me for dates and buy me flowers etc. 

After pir daughter was born I think he hit some midlife crisis situation where he felt he should have more to put on the table for our daughter and I. He works very hard and his salary is enough to care for us (I also bring in a salary).

However the past two years has been horrible. He used to gamble at casino here and there but nothing I ever noticed as a financial burden and something he enjoyed with his colleagues. The odd scratch card and lottery ticket here and there. 

Then he became interested in crypto and would invest (and lose) a lot of money without my knowledge. 

In February I went away with my daughter and when I came back he sat me down to tell me he had borrowed £2k and lost. He felt so guilty and promised to never do this again. 

We spent until June paying that off (on top off £500 he always pays monthly to pay off a debt he's had for a long time. 

That week we paid it off my mom came to stay with us and he was on his phone 24/7, when she left, he told me he had done it again. 

We were meant to move country and our daughter to start kindergarden and we had to postpone everything yet again. However I still supported him and tried to be compassionate and understanding and he said he'd give me every paycheck and never borrow even £100 again. 

He sends me his paychecks but he borrowed more. £300 here £150 there, and I'm so sick of always paying people back. 

He works a lot and when he isn't working he's glued to his phone ""investing"", desperate to make the money back. He lies. Then he gets a ""good investment"" and tells me to be excited that this can ""hit big"" and it doesn't and I'm being blamed for having ""bad energy"" and ""not believing in him"" and that indirectly it's my fault he lost borrowed money, yet again. Even though he knows he PROMISED to never do it again, and then gaslights me into thinking we're going to be millionaires? 

All at the same time as I am raising our little daughter all by ourselves. 

We have tried him sending me his whole paycheck, we have tried talking about it, I've tried tough love and tears. 

Do I need to get him to professional help? I don't want to crush his dreams but he has completely crushed our finances and plans for the next couple years. I feel betrayed. 

I think he is desperate to make back the money he has lost and he genuinely believe he can make it all back. 

My problem is that I never find out until I question him. I can see in his eyes when he's in obsession mode and literally will spend hours and hours a day glued to his phone ignoring his daughter to the point where I take her out and do things by ourselves to keep her from getting hurt from his neglect. 

Do I try to get him help, do I tell him if he doesn't stop I'll leave, do I create a seperate account to save so I can afford to leave? Do I give up on him? Is there any hope? 

Our relationship is going so bad because im so disappointed and have a hard time even looking at him. I forgive and forget every time but he does the same BS again and again. 

We have a little daughter, which is the only reason I'm willing to try to get him professional help. And because I used to think he was my soulmate. 

**Edit: he now can't afford to even buy me a flower ln my birthday because he ""invested"" it all away because he wanted to surprise me with a lot of money, which he obviously couldn't make. He can't pay for groceries, he can't provide for rent or take me out a single time. He invested every single dime he has and borrows when I keep everything in my account. 

We have tried that he can keep £200 to have some money to enjoy for a couple weeks to take me out for a coffee or our daughter for a date, but he spent and lost that too.",5,1761253771.0,GamblingAddiction,4,1.0,False

So we vibed, and we started talking every day, moved to phone calls at most the nights, shared our days, and we had a lot in commons, it was honestly nice having him in my life. I didn’t even know what he looked like, and I didn’t mind. I respected his privacy and told myself I knew his soul, and that was enough (yeah, I know, the cheesiest thing you’ll hear today hhh).
Weeks went by, we had good days, bad days, just like a normal relationship. Then one day I asked if we could finally meet in a public place. I felt like I’d earned his trust by now; we couldn’t just stay online forever.
He said yes but suggested meeting at my place because he’s introverted and doesn’t like going out. Fair enough. So we planned a weekend together, nothing crazy, just some chill activities. I was genuinely excited. The whole week I couldn’t think about anything else (and no, not in a sexual way hhhh).
Friday comes around. We talk in the morning, and again during my lunch break. Then… nothing. Total silence.
I texted him when I got home, no reply. I wasn’t sure if he’d blocked me, but I was in denial. I kept telling myself maybe something happened, maybe he lost his phone, maybe anything but ghosting. I stayed up until 3 a.m. before finally accepting it. He just disappeared.
The next day, I couldn’t stay home, so I went out for coffee with a friend and posted a story. And guess who viewed it? Yeap, HIM.
I got so pissed. That level of disrespect hurt. I sent him a message on Instagram, which is ghosted of course, unfollowed him, deleted his number… all that dramatic healing stuff. But truth is, I still think about him sometimes. Like, there’s this weird part of me that imagines us crossing paths one day, maybe bumping into each other, saying ""sorry"" and not realizing who the other is. Anyway, that’s my story with my ghost soulmate.

1oef8xt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllHayganeen/comments/1oef8xt/she_made_me_terrified_of_women/,She made me terrified of women.,"So, there's this woman who's 25. She's had several relationships. I'm a 21-year-old guy; the most I've ever done with a girl is hold hands back in 9th grade.

I met her on Reddit. She had made a post in a subreddit about a specific kink she was into and wanted to see if anyone from our country was interested. I looked into it and found it kind of hot, so I messaged her. We talked for two days and she said, ""I don't want anything serious,"" and I felt the same way, so I thought it was a good idea to exchange numbers.

We started talking on WhatsApp and it was nice. I asked her a few times if she had a problem with me being younger than her. Sometimes she said no, sometimes she seemed hesitant. I told her I had zero experience. So I asked her, given my lack of experience, how would this work? She said we'd go to a coffee shop, talk, and see if we had a connection and trust. After that, we would make out. She was extremely, extremely confident, and that kind of intimidated me a little. It's not that I don't like confident women, but it was my first time doing anything like this.

(She had a car; she was the one who picked me up from home and dropped me back off.)

She has a lot going on in her life. She's graduated and works, while I'm still a student. Because of this, I could barely bring myself to talk about intimate things. We talked about religion, physics, math, computers, and artificial intelligence, but I didn't give her a single compliment.

Then, after that, she asked me if I was interested in going to an empty/quiet place. I said, ""Yeah, sure, no problem."" So we went, she parked the car, and she said something casual like, ""So, what's new?""

And I did something a little stupid/awkward: I said, ""Nothing's new anymore,"" and just started kissing her. After about 15 seconds, we stopped and she said, ""Use your lips more."" Then we tried again.

Then we stopped. I asked her what was wrong. She said it wasn't about me, and she said something along the lines of her only being able to do it with someone she has real feelings for, or is truly attracted to (I don't remember exactly what she said, it kind of messed with my head). So I told her, ""It's okay, I don't want to do anything you're not comfortable with.""

Then she started giving me advice, saying that I should use my lips more and give compliments to my partner.

On the way back, I said something because I felt a bit hurt, and it crossed my mind to say, ""I'm sure you'll text me again."" I don't know why I said that.",2,1761253649.0,AllHayganeen,9,1.0,False

Basically, a post-doc in my lab decided they don't like me at first sight (literally). Our research topics barely overlap, so we never even talked virtually until I actually arrived in the lab. The first time I tried to talk to them was during a coffee break; they just talked to another person non-stop and didn't leave any chance for me to engage. I stood there like an idiot for more than 5 minutes (it could have been longer, but I finally just gave up and went for some cookies lol).

Then one day, during an informal group discussion with just the three of us, they started speaking to the third person in a language that isn't our common workspace language. The third person apologized to me twice for it. 

All these incidents only happen when our PI isn't around.

I've experienced similar microaggressions before and I always regret that I did nothing for myself back then. Since their topic doesn't overlap much with mine and I'm pretty happy with my research, I am not going to give up my position over this bs. Currently running to my PI over who sits with who at lunch seems not a good use of everyone's time. But I think it would be smart to keep some form of evidence, although I know how hard it is to gather proof on this kind of non-written misbehavior, just in case things escalate.

For anyone who's been through something similar, how did you handle it? Any advice on how to keep some evidences on this kind of stuff? Appreciate any insight, thanks.",0,1761253641.0,PhD,12,0.22,False

We were both in relationships. We went to the gym together once or twice and met for coffee two more times. After that we kind of just went our ways and only sporadically texted, but both basically went MIA for two years. My relationship ended last year and his ended 4 months ago. When we first got into contact again, he was very much still shaken up by being dumped and they were still living together. I noticed how he was looking for distractions left and right (seeing friends, going out, lost of sports etc.). He pursued me in fairly obvious ways (sexual remarks/texts) and I responded with different renditions of a cheeky ""you're gonna have to wait"" or ""let's see if you earn it"", because I genuinely like him and didn't want to be a simple rebound, but was also obviously enjoying the attention. I refused to act on my attraction to him for several reasons. 1. being a rebound 2. being a distraction (I told him he needed to deal with himself for a while and there's no way I would want him to jump into anything so soon) 3. I thought he would be more relationship material and I didn't want one (still don't really, I think?) 4. I had gone celibate and lowkey anti-relationships to weed out shallow and consequently toxic ""encounters"". So what did I do? For a month we met every few days- playing sports, going on bike rides, swimming, pub quiz, hanging out in a park till midnight talking etc.- In this time I had met his friends and was welcomed into the group. When this happened, I noticed his attention towards me dropped off and I got frustrated, because it confirmed what I was afraid of - just being desired for sex. So after fuming for a couple days without contact, I invited him over for dinner, we cooked, talked, hung out on the couch, ""watched"" a documentary and well...   
Since then we've talked about what we want and don't want. Want: sex, good talks and fun. Don't want: dates, a relationship, expectations. He said he wasn't comfortable with affectionate touches yet, which I fully respect. For two months now it's been good the way it is. We can both focus on our lives (jobs, studying, learning to be alone, friends and just figuring life out for ourselves). It feels easy, comfortable and exactly what both of us need currently. So now with that context:  
We only texted a bit, either to sext or plan our next ""session"". It mainly revolved around that. In the last two or so weeks, I've noticed he's been texting more frequently (almost on a daily basis at this point) asking what or how I'm doing. We joke around a lot, send voice notes and are simply in contact. It doesn't feel forced, bad or confusing. It makes me happy that he thinks of me and I think it goes vice versa. The last two times we saw each other I felt a very subtle shift in energy. He was softer, sought out physical touch without the sexual tension and his kisses were deeper. We talked and laughed more and made plans to go out dancing next weekend. He's forcing me to watch anime (I've never been a fan and he certainly is) to pregame and asked to sleep over when we come back. The last goodbye hug was longer and tighter. Also mans makes many a random sound and I have echolalia so we went back and forth meowing while he descended the staircase in my building.  
I'm enjoying all of it. The attention, his touch, talking and joking, I also don't care that we normally don't spend more than 2 hours together per week. I enjoy being present with him in that time and am totally fine when he leaves again. I still don't feel the limerence I normally would (audhd here btw), which is kind of bizarre ngl. Now I'm trying to figure out what change is happening and if I need to decompatmentalize my feelings towards him. I also don't want to ruin what we have going on by thinking about this too much. So, please reddit, give me your opinions and interpretations so I don't have to do it myself. I'm not totally opposed to a relationship anymore, but I'm also not seeking one if that makes sense. I am fully comfortable being by myself and doing my thing, but I feel like we could have a good thing going at some point. Am I being delusional?

1oef4y9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oef4y9,Finally hit the 80's on time for my honeymoon,"**Finally allowing myself to celebrate a little 🎉**  
Last week I reached ***Onederland***, but I decided to wait another week to officially step into the 80’s (***under 90kg***) zone. I’d really hoped to hit this milestone before my delayed honeymoon to Japan next week — and I did it!

**My Journey:**

Started on June 2nd. Went for the initial 4 weeks on 2.5mg and then moved to 5mg. My healthcare provider said I am a super responder to the medication. We decided together that unless I stall for a long period we will not increase further. That was also something I pushed for to make it easier to get off the drug once I reach my goals. I have been trying to focus on building habits that I can sustain after the drug as well.

Taking my injections on Monday evenings makes Monday's more fun. 

**Food:**

At the start of the medication as well as on the transition to 5mg - I didn't feel hunger for like 2 weeks and had to force myself to eat. After that I still usually don't feel hunger a day and a half after injection but return to feeling hunger for the rest of the week.

On the first month and a half I tracked calories, but eventually stopped when I realized that it isn't an effort for me to eat below my daily limit. Me and my wife (who also lost a bunch of weight on her own without medication) make healthy meals. I do eat one barbell a day with a liquid IV packet, it's my daily healthy snack which I really enjoy.

I also try to practice intermittent fasting. I eat after 12:00 and finish eating before 20:00. 

While I have these guidelines I allow myself to not be perfect, it's one of the things I learned from my previous weight-loss journey - being perfect 100% of the time will lead to failure. So if I want to go to a coffee shop in the morning with my wife and dog to enjoy some pastry here and there - I allow myself although it's not exactly on my diet or at the time I eat usually. I feel that this flexibility will allow me to continue healthy habits in the long run. 

**Fitness**

In the first 3 months I went to the gym, the problem is I get really bored lifting weights and started noticing that I ""slack off"" because of that. So once I reached 220 pounds I decided I am now good to go back to climbing which I missed. Since then I have been going 2-3 times a week to climb and also try to do more walks and roller skating for cardio. 

**Side Effects:**

I can't say I have had any major side effects. I do have constipation now and then when I don't drink enough water. And I did throw up twice in the first week on 5mg. Other than that I am rather lucky.

**Other:**

All my large clothes don't fit me anymore, I am lucky that I kept some of my old clothes but I am currently living basically on 2 outfits (glad to be half a remote worker).

I am planning on buying many clothes in Japan where prices are almost half the New York prices.

**Future plans and goals:**

I assume that the second part of my journey till my holy grail of 150 pounds will take twice the time it took me to reach this milestone. I am not rushing it, and it is more important for me that the habits stick so that hopefully I won't regain the weight back this time.

I am really trying to enjoy the journey. Be grateful for things I missed (Climbing, wearing nicer clothes). And I am optimistic for the future and can't thank this tool I was blessed with.

1oef4b8,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1oef4b8/cdmx_vs_são_paulo_some_thoughts/,CDMX vs São Paulo - some thoughts :),"I recently visited CDMX & São Paulo - a week in each. Just wanted to share my thoughts (male, mid 30s, healthy budget, English & Spanish fluent, a bit of Portugese)

**Food**: CDMX - from street food, to casual dining, to fine dining. CDMX won for me in price, taste, and service. I also found CDMX much more affordable regarding food in general - from coffee, to bakeries, to a nice bistro. São Paulo doesn't have the street food culture that CDMX does. They do have 'botecos' which are cool corner bars with great atmosphere. However, I found a lot of the food to be fried and a bit heavy. In CDMX, I was often able to sit an have a nice cocktail and a main dish for about $30-35 USD. In São Paulo, I found it more to be about $50 USD.

**Accommodations**: CDMX. Tons of nice boutique hotels ranging from $150-200 a night. I did not find those options in São Paulo - some of the more corporate hotels were like $200 a night, and some of the nicer hotels were going for like $500-700. I did not see a ton of nice midrange options in São Paulo.

**Convenience**: São Paulo. Totally impressed with how much you can do on your phone. I could order & pay on my phone at many restaurants. Street stands and small businesses ALL take cards. I was actually reading that Brasil is one of the most cashless societies and I found this to be true.

**Public Transportation**: Tie. Both metros are easy to use and inexpensive. São Paulo's was more modern and much cleaner. One downside is that as a tourist you have to buy single trip tickets, which is a hassle. And, in contrast with what I said above about everything being cashless, at some metro stations you can only buy the single trip tickets in cash!! Haha. The bus rapid transit in both cities was great. I felt safe using transportation in both cities, though it did feel less grimy in São Paulo.

**Cost:** Kind of mentioned above in food and accommodations. I found CDMX to be much less expensive than São Paulo in almost every regard (except for Uber - those were the same price, most of my rides were $5-10) Domestic travel is also less expensive from CDMX (airfare and first class buses) for visiting other parts of the country.

**Neighborhoods:** Both cities have fabulous neighborhoods with great 'vibe'. My favorite in CDMX are Condesa & Coyoacan. In São Paulo, I loved Pinheiros & Higienopolis. The architecture, art, and sidewalk culture are great in both. I prefer Chapultepec Park to Ibirapuera. Excellent museums in both. Avenida Paulista (São Paulo) and Avenida Reforma (CDMX) are pretty similar - big city vibe, closed on Sundays for biking and walking.

**Friendliness**: I found people in CDMX to be much friendlier.

**Overall:** Both awesome cities with an endless amount of options. If you are a big city fan, you can't go wrong.

likes . . . 

general﹕cold and windy weather , black coffee , black tea , horror , psychological horror, music , reading , books , dark fragrances , typology , turtlenecks , STEM , astronomy , philosophy, mountains , Kyoto , dark academia , learning , and thrillers. 

\- I critically examine societal constructs, rejecting beliefs based solely on tradition or conformity. I objectively and openly express my opinions.

\- In groups, I usually take on a leadership role. I crave structure and competence, and I get frustrated when those goals aren’t met. I’m very direct and judgmental, even when I see people trying their best. Still, I want my select group of people to improve (I desire friends who can motivate me rather than lead me astray). I have internal ideas about how I see people and how they could be, and I judge based on those.

\- I quickly categorize and judge people using a few words.

\- I set intense goals that might seem unrealistic to many.

\- I dislike nostalgia and find reminiscing uninteresting. However, I do aim to learn from my past mistakes.

\- I've been told I'm well-spoken.

\- Financial and intellectual freedom are rather important to me. In fact, I couldn't be tied down to a relationship (romantic or platonic) that doesn't allow me independence.

\- My life plan is to build momentum toward financial freedom, knowledge, and impact. I would like money so I can INVEST in organizations, think tanks, and things that benefit the future.

\- If an authority figure or system shares my values and proves to be competent, I follow it for order and structure. But if I see incompetence, corruption, or irrationality, I will ALWAYS choose my autonomy over authority. 

\- I crave external validation for my academic achievements, even if I don't like to admit it.

\- I'm a Slytherclaw.

\- I value my boundaries, future, and safety, but I can be brutally honest and challenging in arguments.

\- When I’m in public, I’m very direct, critical, and fast to think and move. I like to get in and out of public places.

\- I can be rather assertive and convincing. Ever since I was young, I understood the world beyond that of a child (which is a good and bad thing). I was good at asserting myself, maintaining self-regulation, and being rather ambitious and 'fast'.

\- Around close relationships, such as my family, I can be seen as overbearing, judgmental, narcissistic, and controlling, which is something I realize I need to control.

\- I enjoy socializing at the library, especially engaging in intellectual conversations with others, discussing plans, education, books, and sharing my witty and dark humor. I also often talk to myself and laugh at things others might find inappropriate. I am not likely to try to fit in or try to make others comfortable; that isn't my priority.

\- For the past five years, I've attended online school and work asynchronously. I quickly grasp new concepts and continuously refine my study habits, especially in math and science, to build a strong foundation for future high school and college coursework.

\- At my best, I am a hardworking, helpful, independent, intelligent, and creative individual who is eager to share knowledge, quick-witted, and self-motivated.

\- At my worst, I am critical, provoking, prone to justify myself, smug, challenging, brutally honest, and prone to burnout, with a sassy, selfish, anxious, and easily annoyed disposition.

\- I am goal-oriented and thrive on setting and achieving ambitious objectives.

\- I have a sharp sense of humor, often leaning toward sarcasm or dark wit.

\- I am a perfectionist, holding myself and others to high standards in all areas of life.

\- I have a superiority/inferiority complex that fears vulnerability. 

\- I value honesty and transparency, even if it means being blunt or direct.

\- I enjoy being a part of intellectually stimulating conversations and giving my opinions. 

\- I am ambitious, always seeking ways to improve and expand my horizons.

\- I highly value my personal space physically and mentally; therefore, if someone were to disrespect my boundaries, I can become short-tempered and annoyed.

\- I often find it challenging to manage my impulses, especially regarding food, to the point where I struggle with bulimia.

\- Effective execution is crucial in establishing mood beyond just music or aesthetics. 

\- I consider myself a selfish person. 

\- I tend to be the type of person who makes others feel their perspective is flawed rather than admitting my own mistakes. I often say things like, ""Oh, of course you would think that,"" or ""I didn't expect you to comprehend differing opinions."" My mother says I can be quite stubborn and resistant to hearing others' views. 

\- I value habits, traits, and opinions that others might perceive as selfish, rude, or unkind.

\- I have no desire to be greedy to the point of ignorance. 

\- I focus on the bigger picture and future possibilities rather than small details.

1oef196,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1oef196/my_mother_used_to_say_that_houses_are_alive_she/,My Mother used to say that Houses are Alive. She wasn’t wrong.,"I moved back into my mother’s house two months ago.

It wasn’t part of the plan. The plan was to rent somewhere small, get my bearings again after she died, and maybe try to rebuild the pieces of my life that fell apart with her. But when I went to collect her things, I couldn’t leave. There was something about the house, something that felt like unfinished business.

It’s the same old two-story I grew up in. White siding, creaky porch, the faint smell of dust and lavender.

My mother loved that smell. She said it calmed the house down.

Even as a kid, though, I never felt calm here. I used to tell her the walls made noises when I was alone, little groans, sighs, a kind of hum when I cried.

She’d laugh and say *“Old houses settle, Clara. They creak because they’re alive in their own way.”*

I thought she meant it metaphorically. I don’t anymore.

The first few nights back were normal enough. Lonely, yes. Too quiet.

I couldn’t sleep in my old bedroom, it still had those faint outlines on the wall from where I’d taped up posters, like ghosts of teenage years I’d rather forget. So I took my mother’s room instead. Her perfume lingered on the curtains, and the bed still dipped on her side, as if she’d only just gotten up.

I started cleaning during the day. Sorting through her things. Trying to make the place feel like *mine*.

That’s when it started, small things, things I told myself were coincidence.

One afternoon I caught myself thinking *this dresser would* look *better by the* window. The next morning, it was. I laughed it off, assuming I’d moved it and forgotten.

But then it happened again.

I was reaching for the hallway light switch, but the switch wasn’t there. Instead, it was on the *other* wall, right where my hand had hesitated a moment before.

My stomach dropped, like missing a step on the stairs.

I told myself I was misremembering, that grief makes people fuzzy. That night, I walked through the house taking pictures, of the layout, of where everything was, so I could prove to myself it wasn’t moving.

The next day, the photos didn’t match.

It wasn’t dramatic, not at first. Doors an inch off, stair count one higher. The kitchen window slightly taller. I thought maybe I was going insane. I even scheduled an appointment with a therapist. But then, the house started… helping me.

When I’d think about coffee, I’d find the mug already waiting on the counter.  
When I’d feel cold, the heat would hum to life without me touching the thermostat.  
One night, I couldn’t find my phone, I whispered, “Where did I leave it?” and the bedroom light flickered, like a nod. I found it glowing on the nightstand.

It felt like the house cared.

It was subtle, intimate, almost maternal. Like it wanted to take care of me the way she used to.

I told myself that was comforting.

But comfort doesn’t last here.

The first time I got angry, I felt it breathe.

I was trying to open a jammed drawer, my mother’s old jewelry box, the one with the music that never worked, and it wouldn’t budge. I yanked harder, muttering under my breath, *“For God’s sake, open!”*

Every door in the house slammed at once.

The windows rattled. The air pressure changed, like before a storm. And then… it was still.

I stood there shaking, trying to laugh it off. *“Old houses,”* I whispered. But I could feel something watching me, not from a corner or doorway, but from the walls themselves.

After that, I started testing it.

When I felt sad, the lights dimmed.

When I panicked, the hallway stretched, I swear to you, it elongated, the end of it sliding further away as I ran. When I calmed down, it shrank again.

I told myself it was grief. Stress. Trauma. All the buzzwords therapists love to use.

But then, I started noticing something worse.

The house wasn’t reacting *to* me anymore. It was *anticipating.*

I’d reach for the faucet, it would turn before my fingers touched it. I’d think about checking the mail, and hear the front door unlatch on its own. I’d dream about my mother, and wake up to find her perfume thick in the air, as if she’d been standing right over me.

The final straw was the basement.

I’ve always hated that basement. As a kid, I refused to go down there. My mother kept the door locked most of the time anyway. Said it was for *storage,* though I don’t ever remember her storing anything.

Last week, I was sitting in the living room when I heard something moving beneath the floorboards. Slow, deliberate, like someone dragging furniture.

I froze. Then, I heard a whisper:

*“Come see what I’ve made for you.”*

It was my mother’s voice.

I wanted to run, but the hallway had already shifted, the front door was gone. Only one door remained open. The basement.

I don’t remember walking down the stairs. I just remember the smell, wet earth, lavender, and something metallic underneath.

The basement was larger than it should’ve been. The floor sloped downward, the walls bending in impossible curves. The wallpaper from upstairs bled into concrete, as though the house was *growing downward.*

At the center was a new door. One I’d never seen.

It was painted white, but wet, like the paint hadn’t dried. I touched it, and the door *breathed.*

The wood expanded against my palm, warm and pulsing. I stepped back, trembling.

The whisper came again, closer this time:

*“You’ve been thinking so loudly, Clara.”*

*“We only wanted to help.”*

I screamed and ran back up the stairs, but they wouldn’t end. The steps kept repeating, looping like an optical illusion. The house was folding in on itself, reconfiguring. Every thought I had became a direction.

*Don’t close in:* the ceiling lowered.  
*Don’t lock me in:* the door vanished.  
*Stop stop stop:* the walls pulsed harder, almost shuddering.

I blacked out.

When I woke up, I was in bed. Morning light filtering through the curtains. Everything normal again. The furniture in its place.

For a while, I convinced myself it had been a nightmare.

Until I saw the note on my dresser. My mother’s handwriting.

*“Don’t leave again. The house gets lonely.”*

The note was written on wallpaper, wallpaper that matched the basement.

I’ve tried leaving. I’ve *tried.*

Every time I pack my bags, something goes wrong. The tires deflate. The front door locks itself. My phone refuses to dial anyone but *“Mom.”*

And she answers.

Sometimes I hear her humming through the vents at night, the same lullaby she sang when I was small. Sometimes I smell that lavender perfume, and the walls ripple softly, as if pleased.

I think the house is keeping me safe.

No...

I think it’s keeping me.

Because last night, I dreamt of that white door again. I could hear breathing on the other side, slow, steady, in sync with mine.

When I woke up, there was a new door in the hallway. This one red. Wet. Waiting.

I think it wants to make me part of it.

Maybe that’s what happened to her.

Maybe that’s why the house always felt alive.

If anyone reading this knows anything about old homes, foundations that shift, blueprints that don’t stay consistent, please tell me if this is possible. Tell me there’s a reason.

Because I looked up property records.

This house has stood here since 1913. It’s been sold sixteen times. Every owner listed as “deceased on property.”

But there’s one detail that makes my skin crawl.

Each record lists a different floor plan.

And the most recent one, the one dated this year, has a new room added.

A bedroom.

With my name on it.

And instead of feeling embarrassed, I felt proud  like I just beat the system somehow. I’ll spend 10 minutes figuring out how to reuse a jar, but I won’t spend $3 on a coffee anymore. It’s not even about the money now it’s about not giving in to dumb convenience.

1oeeyhp,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1oeeyhp/urdu_class_5_pdf_based_on_single_national/,Urdu Class 5 PDF Based on Single National Curriculum - Punjab Textbook Board,"Hey everyone! I just finished a book that really stuck with me, and I wanted to share my thoughts, almost like chatting over coffee with a friend. The book is called *Echoes in the Deep* by [Fictional Author Name], and it’s a compelling journey into the mind, blending elements of a psychological thriller with a subtle touch of the fantastical. It's about a young architect who starts experiencing vivid, unsettling 'echoes' of past events and forgotten memories within the very structures he designs. As these echoes intensify, he uncovers a hidden history that threatens to unravel his own sanity and the foundations of his world. It’s a real page-turner that keeps you guessing, much like how exciting it can be to discover new learning materials, such as this [Urdu Class 5 PDF Based on Single National Curriculum - Punjab Textbook Board](https://pdfhive.com/urdu-class-5-pdf-based-on-single-national-curriculum-punjab-textbook-board/), if you're exploring new subjects.

What truly captured my attention in *Echoes in the Deep* were the characters. The protagonist, Alex, felt incredibly real and relatable. You genuinely root for him as he grapples with these strange occurrences. His struggles with self-doubt and the blurring line between reality and illusion are depicted with such nuance that you can't help but feel invested in his journey. The secondary characters, while fewer in number, are also well-developed, each playing a crucial role in Alex’s unfolding mystery.

The author’s writing style is another highlight. It’s descriptive without being overly verbose, painting vivid pictures in your mind without bogging down the pace. There’s a beautiful rhythm to the prose, and it truly shines in the moments of psychological tension. I found myself highlighting passages, not just for the plot points, but for the sheer elegance of the language. The pacing is excellent; it starts with a slow burn, building suspense gradually, then accelerates into a gripping conclusion that left me thinking long after I'd turned the last page.

Now, no book is perfect for everyone, and I do have a small note on something that might not appeal to all readers. While I appreciated the subtle fantasy elements, some might find them a little too ambiguous, perhaps wishing for a clearer explanation of the 'mechanics' behind the echoes. It wasn't a deal-breaker for me, as I enjoy a bit of mystery, but if you prefer your fantasy systems clearly defined, you might find yourself wanting just a touch more concrete detail. It’s a very minor point, though, and it ultimately adds to the book's haunting atmosphere.

Overall, *Echoes in the Deep* is a really impressive read. It delves deep into themes of memory, identity, and the weight of history, all wrapped up in a compelling narrative. I found it to be a genuinely thought-provoking and emotionally resonant experience. If you enjoy books that make you question what's real, and you appreciate intricate character development alongside a suspenseful plot, then this one is definitely worth picking up.

I would absolutely recommend *Echoes in the Deep* to anyone who loves psychological thrillers, especially those with a hint of the supernatural or speculative. It’s also a great choice for readers who appreciate well-crafted prose and a story that lingers in your mind. It might be a bit intense for very casual, light readers, but if you're up for a deep dive, you'll find it incredibly rewarding.

For those of you who might be new to this genre or even just new to reading for pleasure, don't let a book like this intimidate you! Reading should be an enjoyable journey, not a chore. Here's a little step-by-step guide to help you find your rhythm:

1.  **Start Small:** Don't feel pressured to tackle a massive tome right away. Shorter books or novellas can be a great way to build your reading stamina.
2.  **Find Your Niche:** Experiment with different genres. What TV shows or movies do you like? Chances are there’s a book genre that matches. Are you interested in learning new things, like with resources such as [Urdu Class 5 PDF Based on Single National Curriculum - Punjab Textbook Board](https://pdfhive.com/urdu-class-5-pdf-based-on-single-national-curriculum-punjab-textbook-board/) to broaden your knowledge? Then maybe non-fiction is for you!
3.  **Set Realistic Goals:** Even just 15-20 minutes a day can make a huge difference. Don't worry if you don't finish a book quickly.
4.  **It's Okay to Quit:** If a book isn't grabbing you after the first few chapters, don't feel obligated to finish it. There are so many amazing books out there waiting for you!
5.  **Join a Community:** Talking about books, like we're doing here on Reddit, can make the experience even richer. It's a great way to discover new titles and share insights.

Remember, reading is a wonderful adventure. There's a whole world of stories waiting to be discovered, whether it's the latest bestseller or an invaluable resource for learning. If you're looking for more educational content or just curious, you can find various materials online, for example, the [Urdu Class 5 PDF Based on Single National Curriculum - Punjab Textbook Board](https://pdfhive.com/urdu-class-5-pdf-based-on-single-national-curriculum-punjab-textbook-board/) provides insight into educational resources available.

There is no drama, I act natural and I barely see him. But I still need to talk it out with random strangers lol.

So 2 months ago I hooked up with a guy I met randomly. 46, recently divorced. Tall, attractive, intelligent We had drinks in the bar, he told me how he divorced his wife after 15 years of an unhappy marriage. How his marriage is his biggest regret and how he only married her because the love of his life got married to someone else. He said his life is a bad joke. And I was in a good mood and I let him do anything he wanted.

And 2 months later I got a job at a big plant. A low position job, accounting support. And he is the manager of that place. There are around 400 people there and many, many layers between us. But he is somewhat thyranical, authoritative, mean to people, has very high expactations, raises his voice, belittles, dominante. Always in tie, always in button up shirt, always unhappy.

3 days ago we crossed paths for the very first time. At the plant's coffee shop. He recognised me, he almost spilled his coffee. But didn't say anything. Later that day he came to our offices to talk with the manager of my manager and I pretended I don't see him.

I will not tell anyone, I will not make a drama about it. I am here to work and not cause him or myself any problems. I need this job a lot. I live in a 400k city, so not a small town but not endless opportunities. And this is a job I like. I am qualified for it. Should I try to tell him anything? Or to keep my mouth shut - I meant like to tell him I will never tell anyone anything. What worries me most is not even that we slept together but the fact that he told me what a miserable life he has and what a coward he was with the love of his life and how he feels hopeless and depressed.

I’ve always hated that basement. As a kid, I refused to go down there. My mother kept the door locked most of the time anyway. Said it was for *storage,* though I don’t ever remember her storing anything.

Last week, I was sitting in the living room when I heard something moving beneath the floorboards. Slow, deliberate, like someone dragging furniture.

I froze. Then, I heard a whisper:

*“Come see what I’ve made for you.”*

It was my mother’s voice.

I wanted to run, but the hallway had already shifted, the front door was gone. Only one door remained open. The basement.

I don’t remember walking down the stairs. I just remember the smell, wet earth, lavender, and something metallic underneath.

The basement was larger than it should’ve been. The floor sloped downward, the walls bending in impossible curves. The wallpaper from upstairs bled into concrete, as though the house was *growing downward.*

At the center was a new door. One I’d never seen.

It was painted white, but wet, like the paint hadn’t dried. I touched it, and the door *breathed.*

The wood expanded against my palm, warm and pulsing. I stepped back, trembling.

The whisper came again, closer this time:

*“You’ve been thinking so loudly, Clara.”*

*“We only wanted to help.”*

I screamed and ran back up the stairs, but they wouldn’t end. The steps kept repeating, looping like an optical illusion. The house was folding in on itself, reconfiguring. Every thought I had became a direction.

*Don’t close in:* the ceiling lowered.  
*Don’t lock me in:* the door vanished.  
*Stop stop stop:* the walls pulsed harder, almost shuddering.

I blacked out.

When I woke up, I was in bed. Morning light filtering through the curtains. Everything normal again. The furniture in its place.

For a while, I convinced myself it had been a nightmare.

Until I saw the note on my dresser. My mother’s handwriting.

*“Don’t leave again. The house gets lonely.”*

The note was written on wallpaper, wallpaper that matched the basement.

I’ve tried leaving. I’ve *tried.*

Every time I pack my bags, something goes wrong. The tires deflate. The front door locks itself. My phone refuses to dial anyone but *“Mom.”*

And she answers.

Sometimes I hear her humming through the vents at night, the same lullaby she sang when I was small. Sometimes I smell that lavender perfume, and the walls ripple softly, as if pleased.

I think the house is keeping me safe.

No...

I think it’s keeping me.

Because last night, I dreamt of that white door again. I could hear breathing on the other side, slow, steady, in sync with mine.

When I woke up, there was a new door in the hallway. This one red. Wet. Waiting.

I think it wants to make me part of it.

Maybe that’s what happened to her.

Maybe that’s why the house always felt alive.

If anyone reading this knows anything about old homes, foundations that shift, blueprints that don’t stay consistent, please tell me if this is possible. Tell me there’s a reason.

Because I looked up property records.

This house has stood here since 1913. It’s been sold sixteen times. Every owner listed as “deceased on property.”

But there’s one detail that makes my skin crawl.

Each record lists a different floor plan.

And the most recent one, the one dated this year, has a new room added.

A bedroom.

I enjoyed the v8 energy drinks for the longest time, but I've recently started to get terrible stomach aches from the artificial sweeteners, sugar alcohols, etc. I seem to be able to tolerate fruit juice or cane sugar just fine. 

My partner can't drink carbonated beverages because she can't burp. They cause her great discomfort if she even drinks ""lightly"" carbonated, so those are out. 

I don't like coffee, so that's out as well.

Now I’m Terrified to Wake Up.,"[](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/?f=flair_name%3A%22Fan-Made%20Story%20%F0%9F%93%9A%22)I’ve always been a lucid dreamer, but it didn’t start as a gift. It started as an escape.

I was fourteen when my parents divorced. Their arguments had been constant, walls shaking, doors slamming, glass shattering. I learned to hide in the corners of my room, headphones blaring, trying not to notice the hollowness growing in my chest.

My mother moved out, my father retreated into work, and I was left in a fractured house that smelled of bleach and old coffee, echoing with absence. It wasn’t just the loneliness; it was the feeling that life was broken and that I was powerless to fix it.

That’s when I discovered lucid dreaming. The first time I realized I was aware inside a dream, I felt a surge of control I had never known. I could bend the world to my will. Anything I imagined, it would come true.

For the first time, I could create happiness, create worlds where pain didn’t exist, where I wasn’t an observer to suffering.

I was God.

At first, I started small.

I walked through forests that glowed in shades I had no names for. I could summon rainbows that arched across violet skies. I made friends in these worlds, creatures that spoke with humor and kindness, always ready to listen, always ready to understand. I relived moments of joy I hadn’t had, moments of safety and warmth that never existed in real life.

I even conjured, what I deemed perfect, my own home. The divorce never happened. The resentment my parents had in reality was hidden by the loving joy that I created.

We could be a family.

But it wasn’t enough. My control became more deliberate, more urgent.

I wasn't satisfied. I needed more.

I experimented.

I created cities that pulsed with light and sound, alive like music made manifest. I created beings who adapted to me, who grew and learned from me. I rewrote history, making impossible things happen, mountains sprouting overnight, rivers folding in impossible loops, stars that danced to the rhythm of my thoughts.

I was addicted.

As I built society further and further, I couldn't differentiate if it I was in reality or asleep. It didn't matter. I didn't want to wake up.

The more I created, the more my waking life seemed hollow, gray, insignificant.

What felt like days, even weeks, were merely only hours of sleep. I'd even mastered to bend my created beings with their own self thought. Their free will in my dreams. Oh how they dreamt and I, their God, could see their own dreams. Their own thoughts and ambitions.

Then I made a decision I will never forget.

I wanted to see what would happen if I stopped interfering, if I left my creations to their own devices. If I, their creator, were to disappear.

Within the dream, I closed my eyes and fell into a dream within a dream, drifting deeper than I ever had.

I left my creation running, untended, leaving it to course as it would without me.

At first, it seemed fine.

The sky remained impossibly vibrant. Oceans of liquid crystal rippled beneath my feet. Cities thrived, creatures and people roamed, oblivious to my absence. But subtle changes began. A tower leaned slightly, though I hadn’t touched it. A river hesitated mid-flow, as if uncertain where it wanted to go. The citizens paused, glancing around with expressions I had never taught them, curiosity, doubt, even impatience.

Then came the worse. A nightmare scenario.

The sky was red. And fire began.

I watched in shock as my world, that I have spent a millennia creating in my head burn. The people, the wildlife, the world itself ate itself.

Greed, hunger for power, the vial vines of corruption overtook my world, and I sat and watched.

What seem to be red liquid fell from the skies, putting and end to the flames.

When it was it over, I returned to my world, imagining that my presence would restore order. But the moment I stepped back, I realized it was already gone.

The survivors of my world looked at me with such anger. I could see how vile in their heart had become. Their being was split from me. From my control.

My world was no longer mine.

I awoke. The morning sun streamed through my curtains, but it felt alien. The apartment, familiar for so long, seemed different.

How long was I asleep?

Shadows stretched at impossible angles. The floorboards creaked where they never had. I told myself it was paranoia, that I had been dreaming too much, but deep down I knew something had changed. Something I had made had learned to exist without me.

That night, I returned.

I didn’t interfere. I simply watched.

The rivers were gone, the mountains were restless, buildings destroyed, and the citizens, my children, my creations, still tore at one another like a society that no longer needed its God.

And I realized, as I observed them, that I had indeed made a mistake.

The addictive thrill of creation, the power I had abused for joy and control, had given birth to something that might outlast me, something that might never remember me.

I woke, trembling. The air in my apartment felt heavy, as though weighted by expectation. I could almost hear the pulse of my dreamworld behind my eyelids, faint but insistent. A world I had built, one that no longer needed me, one that might thrive, change, and evolve beyond my comprehension.

I have not closed my eyes since. I fear what I might see. I fear what might remember me.

I fear that if I sleep again, I will discover a truth I cannot bear.

1oeesoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1oeesoy/aio_husbands_entitled_brother_breaking_and/,AIO husbands entitled brother breaking and throwing things away including my belongings,"I don't know my husband's brother very well. When I first came to the UK with my husband, and stayed at his parents house, his brother was 16-17 years old. I'd heard stories from my husband of him taking things, like my husband's phone charger, and refusing to give it back which led to a massive fight that turned psychical, supposedly. He also took my husband's expensive mattress and swapped it with his. Their mother seemed to dismiss this and never held him accountable for this behavior. I learned that he not only took things without asking, he also threw things away. Everything from cardboard boxes in the attic to pots and pans in the kitchen. 

It was considered one of his quirks, possibly related to OCD, and wasn't taken very seriously by anyone. As he's gotten older, he's continued to do these things. He's now in his early 20s. On several occasions he has asked for my husband's car key under the pretense he was going to move it. Instead, he drove off in it each time, without asking, and without knowing if the car was needed. He brought the car back in a bad state eventually. The window wouldn't go completely up and there were other things wrong with it. My husband mentioned this to his mother and she dismissed it, as always. His brother wasn't confronted about it. 

It happens with money, too. My husband canceled his Netflix subscription, which his brother also used, and it was reactivated shortly after he canceled it. His brother was the one who likely did it. He went to his mother over this and she told him that it was most likely an accident. His father acts the same way. He takes the car without asking, or takes it longer than he says he needs it for. He's taken the charger out of the car several times without asking. When I've criticized this my husband has minimized it or has said that he doesn't want to complain because we live here for free. When we were away visiting my family in America his car was left uninsured in a parking lot. When his father offered to insure under the guise he was going to use it. 

He wasn't told whenever he didn't use it that it was left there. This was treated like it wasn't a big deal. His mother has done similar things albeit less than the others. She has, more than once, scratched his car. She offered to get it fixed but my husband let it go. Then it happened again. She recently broke and lost a button for the window. When I commented on this my husband said the panel was already loose. A few weeks back my husband insisted on putting my Nespresso coffee machine, the one he gifted me a couple Christmas's ago, in the kitchen. He said we weren't using it and maybe they would. I told him not to. I said that it would get broken, go missing, or be thrown out. He said it wouldn't be and acted like it wasn't a possibility. 

He went downstairs earlier and it was gone. He asked his mother about it and she said she never saw it, and didn't know it was down there. He went outside and discovered the pods in the garbage. He didn't locate the coffee machine. He said his brother must have thrown it away. He told me he messaged him about it since he's not here, though I am doubtful he'd go to him if he was. He said his mother told him to leave her out of it. That she is tired of him going to her about problems he has with everyone else. He said they are two grown men now. I said that this is something she should be involved in. That he needs to be held accountable. That nothing will come of this and he will ignore his message. When I went to post about it, which he knew I was doing, he told me not to. 

He said there was no point getting anyone else's opinion. He said the coffee machine sat there for days being unused and that's probably why he threw it out. I am concerned that other belongings of mine could be tossed eventually. My first instinct when I learned the coffee machine was thrown out was to message his brother myself, but my husband stopped me from doing so. I have never dealt with something like this before. The entire situation feels toxic. I don't think his brother will ever change. Not with his mother and everyone else enabling him and letting things slide. They all seem to cross boundaries and not respect each others belongings and its frustrating, to say the least. 

Whenever I criticize them to my husband, he gets annoyed. Especially when it's been his parents, his mother in particular. He seems to think because I live here rent free, I shouldn't be able to complain. I criticized his brother a bit more and he said he didn't know why I was, that his brother didn't do it intentionally, and that it wasn't aimed at me. That he didn't know it was my coffee machine. That he probably thought it wasn't being used and way in the way. I said his entire family dynamic is toxic and they all enable each other, and evade accountability, and he got angry with me saying this.

1oeephm,https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome_extensions/comments/1oeephm/just_built_a_chrome_extension_that_compares/,Just built a Chrome extension that compares products across different websites and rates deals with sweet/sour/meh ratings. Anyone seen something like this?,"When I was a kid, my dad drilled one habit into me: a dollar saved is a dollar earned. Not about being cheap but about being smart, so there’s more left for the good stuff in life. Gifts. A weekend away. A little breathing room.

Fast forward: I became the unofficial “deal person” in my friend group. “Is this a good deal?” “Where should I buy this grill I want?” “Is there a better model I should look out for?” I loved doing the homework, and they trusted me.

So I packaged what I know into a Chrome extension called **Sweet Dill** 🥒. The goal: make it dead simple to know if the price in front of you is actually good.

https://preview.redd.it/f7kv5vl8bxwf1.png?width=426&format=png&auto=webp&s=51d1799db8281cbc8cdb1d80b56b391eeb79f77e

**What it does (right now):**

* When you’re on a product page, it uses an AI agent to figure out the exact product (model/SKU/specs) Then, in real time, it searches **across multiple retailer websites** for the same item (not “kinda similar,” the same thing)
* It pulls in from sources I normally use for research and shows **price history + previous deals**
* It slaps a quick rating on what you’re seeing: **sweet deal**, **meh deal**, or **sour deal**
* The idea is to cut through the “was $199, now $129!!” noise and show you whether that’s real or marketing perfume  

**Why I built it:**

I kept finding that most extensions either (a) promote pay‑to‑play retailers or (b) show you “related” stuff instead of *the same product* elsewhere. If you’re trying to buy a specific SSD or coffee grinder or monitor, “similar” isn’t helpful… you want *that* model at a fair price.

**Beliefs baked into this:**

* You shouldn’t need to be a pro deal‑hunting to save money  
* Retailers are getting louder with “sales,” but the signal is worse  
* Saving on things you actually need frees up money for things that actually matter at a time when everything feels expensive  

**Where it’s going:**

Beyond price, I want **quality** in the loop. Less cheap widget, more buy‑for‑life so the roadmap includes recommendations that nudge you toward better‑made products when it’s worth it, not just knock‑offs that look like a bargain today and die tomorrow.

**What I’d love from you:**

* Has anyone seen a Chrome extension that *truly* shows the same product across stores, with price history + a simple rating? if so, i want to learn from it  
* Is the **sweet/meh/sour** scale clear enough, or too cutesy? Would a deal score (e.g., 0–100) be better?  
* What categories of products should I focus on first and the best results for?  
* What signals would make you trust the rating more?  

If links aren’t allowed here, I’ll drop screenshots + the link in the comments. Happy to trade feedback, share how the agent matching works at a high level, and hear where this would annoy you or break.

Thanks for reading. If Sweet Dill helps someone buy smarter and stash a little extra for their people, or a mini vacation, that’s a win.

1oeepac,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1oeepac/she_made_me_terrified_of_women/,She made me terrified of women.,"So, there's this woman who's 25. She's had several relationships. I'm a 21-year-old guy; the most I've ever done with a girl is hold hands back in 9th grade.

I met her on Reddit. She had made a post in a subreddit about a specific kink she was into and wanted to see if anyone from our country was interested. I looked into it and found it kind of hot, so I messaged her. We talked for two days and she said, ""I don't want anything serious,"" and I felt the same way, so I thought it was a good idea to exchange numbers.

We started talking on WhatsApp and it was nice. I asked her a few times if she had a problem with me being younger than her. Sometimes she said no, sometimes she seemed hesitant. I told her I had zero experience. So I asked her, given my lack of experience, how would this work? She said we'd go to a coffee shop, talk, and see if we had a connection and trust. After that, we would make out. She was extremely, extremely confident, and that kind of intimidated me a little. It's not that I don't like confident women, but it was my first time doing anything like this.

(She had a car; she was the one who picked me up from home and dropped me back off.)

She has a lot going on in her life. She's graduated and works, while I'm still a student. Because of this, I could barely bring myself to talk about intimate things. We talked about religion, physics, math, computers, and artificial intelligence, but I didn't give her a single compliment.

Then, after that, she asked me if I was interested in going to an empty/quiet place. I said, ""Yeah, sure, no problem."" So we went, she parked the car, and she said something casual like, ""So, what's new?""

And I did something a little stupid/awkward: I said, ""Nothing's new anymore,"" and just started kissing her. After about 15 seconds, we stopped and she said, ""Use your lips more."" Then we tried again.

Then we stopped. I asked her what was wrong. She said it wasn't about me, and she said something along the lines of her only being able to do it with someone she has real feelings for, or is truly attracted to (I don't remember exactly what she said, it kind of messed with my head). So I told her, ""It's okay, I don't want to do anything you're not comfortable with.""

Then she started giving me advice, saying that I should use my lips more and give compliments to my partner.

On the way back, I said something because I felt a bit hurt, and it crossed my mind to say, ""I'm sure you'll text me again."" I don't know why I said that.",1,1761252401.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

(Part 02),"[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Weirdstories/comments/1nr0p5e/im_a_pi_for_a_local_port_town_a_girl_has_gone/)

Parents always tell you there's no such thing as monsters. I'm not so sure about that anymore. What if you look into the dark nd find there actually is somethin’ there? Nobody prepares you for the loss of sleep. Nobody prepares you for the utter fear of seein’ that shadow in the corner actually start movin’. You always think there' s somethin’ you can do about it. Let me tell you straight, there ain’t. Once the dark knows you're there, there ain' t nothin’ you can do to keep it from findin’ you.

I’d been out the hospital bout’ two weeks nd it ain’t been no walk in the park. Ever since the swamp, things have been.. off. Maybe that's an understatement, but it's hard to describe what's happenin’ to me. I see things now, in the shadows. I see things movin’, shapes nd figures in the dark. I leave the lights on in my apartment now, but that doesn't stop the dreams. I see that impossible tower in its monochrome landscape. I see that eerie green light flowin’ like water as if it’s alive. I see Mary.

I awoke early, nd immediately knew somethin’ was wrong. The room was dark and quiet. I stayed still,that conjures demons from the dark. Then I felt the cold hand slide over my bicep nd grip firmly. It pulled me onto my back nd I couldn't help but look next to me. Layin’ there starin’ at me with those emerald glowin’ eyes was Mary, practically naked except for the sheer green garment she was wrapped in. She was no longer the mud-covered fanatic I met in the swamp. She was clean nd ghostly pale, luminescent even. Suddenly her eyes rolled back into her head nd her mouth gaped open wide. A thick, slimy black tendril pushed its way out of her mouth as I watched in horror. I pushed myself away, fallin’ onto the floor. My body hit the ground nd with a blink the world changed. It was mornin’, nd the gulls cawed loudly outside my window. I looked at the empty bed nd sagged into myself lettin’ out the breath I didn't realize I was holdin’.

I took my time gettin’ ready, tryin’ to put back together my frayed nerves. As I finished, I looked in the direction of my safe where I had stashed that heretical book. I tried lookin’ at it before, but as soon as I saw the best possible rendition of the Emerald Tower I locked it away. I knew I'd have to look at it some time, but that time wasn’t today, nor hopefully any time soon. I quickly finished up, suddenly wantin’ to be as far from that safe as possible, when I heard a knock on my office door.

“Great..” I muttered to myself as I began headin’ down.

I unlocked the door nd opened it slightly, turnin’ around without lookin’ nd headin’ to my desk.

“Mornin’ deputy.” I said as I grabbed the whiskey bottle nd poured a bit into the cold coffee still on my desk from yesterday.

“How’d ya know it was me?” said Deputy Tom Bellham as he stepped into the door, closin’ it behind him.

“Just a feelin’ Tom.” I said, as I popped two Seltzer tabs into the coffee as well nd stared at it as it bubbled nd frothed. I've been havin’ those too, feelin’s, like my intuition has skyrocketed to new heights.

I side-eyed Tom as he stepped further into my office. I could tell he was uncomfortable. Most people around here have treated me differently since the swamp incident. Maybe it’s because of the rumours of what happened or maybe it's because of my newly green eyes. Could be both for all I know, but I've learned not to make eye contact anymore.

“So did you need somethin’ Tom, or did you just come to stand here?” I said takin’ a sip of my mornin’ concoction.

Tom shifted his feet a bit before answerin’. “I’m guessin’ you ain’t heard the news lately, Jimmy?”

“No Tom, I haven't heard any news. Been sorta keepin’ to myself lately.” I said starin’ into my coffee cup.

“Yea...” Tom said, before continuin’ hesitantly, ""We've had some strangeness in town, Jimmy. Two people are dead.”

I looked at Tom for a moment, his eyes shiftin’ away quickly from mine. “Sounds like your jurisdiction Tom, not mine.”

Tom lets out a long sigh before speakin’, “yea I know Jimmy, but I’m at a loss on this, nd you know the sheriff isn't doin’ a damn thing about it. I could use your help on this one.”

I nodded lookin’ away again nd finishin’ the rest of my coffee. “Alright Tom, tell me what’s goin’ on.” I said walkin’ round my desk nd sittin’ in my chair.

Tom sat down nd went into the details. Apparently the two people died exactly the same way. Both had drowned, but the strange thing was they were found the next day shriveled nd untouched by the water life. Also it’s reported that the second actually walked into the water themselves, nd there’s some evidence the first did the same, though there’s no witnesses. The coroner report basically said the bodies were drained of all fluids. Which is hard to believe since they apparently died in the ocean.

I leaned back in my chair as Tom finished his explanation. “I’m not really sure what I can do with that Tom, not much to go on there.”

Tom nods thoughtfully for a moment, “Yea I know Jimmy, just maybe look into it for me, see if there’s anythin’ I missed.”

“Yea alright, I can do that for you, just keep me updated.” I said.

“Alright Jimmy. Thanks.” He said gettin’ up from his chair. “I’ll see ya round.”

With that Tom walked out the door leavin’ me to ponder the situation. If I didn't know better I'd say this was all coincidence, but even in normal situations, coincidences are a rare thing.

I mulled over things for a moment. Most likely both deaths occurred sometime in the night. I doubt visitin’ the site durin’ the day would yield anythin’ new. Tom may be the only real law in town, but he was pretty thorough. What I could do was talk to the witness of the second incident, Debbie Thornwell. I looked up at the clock nd sighed. Better now than later I suppose.

I got up from my desk, grabbin’ my jacket nd headin’ to the door.

The mornin’ air was brisk as I walked down the damp streets of Portsmouth. The familiar scent of rottin’ fish hangin’ in the cold air. A light fog hung stubbornly as I passed abandoned shops, the sun not yet warm enough to send it to its grave. I pulled up my collar to try nd block the chill wind nd turned down the street to Debbie's home. I looked up at the ramshackle house before walkin’ up its creaky steps nd knockin’ on the door.

The door cracked open, the swollen wood givin’ some trouble before releasin’ the door from its confines. I could see a sliver of Debbie's face, eyes swollen on her weathered face.

“Jimmy, what do you need hun? It ain’t a good time.” She said wearily, lettin’ the door creep open a little more.

“Yea I know Debs. I’m helpin’ Tom with the situation. Just wanted to go over what you saw the other night. Also, I'm sorry for your loss.”

“Everybody’s sorry Jimmy. Doesn't change the fact my husband walked into the sea without any warnin’ or reason.” She said with a heavy sigh. “Come on in Jimmy.”

She opened the door further lettin’ me into the home. Despite outward appearances the inside was warm, cozy nd well lit. I stopped inside nd followed her into the livin’ room where she sat in a well worn lazyboy. Another sat not too far from her, also well worn. I decided to sit on the couch. I sat nd waited for her to begin. There wasn't any rush nd I wasn't gonna push her to start.

“It was bout three in the mornin’ when I felt him get out of bed. At first I thought he was just goin’ to the bathroom, but when I realized the light hadn't turned on I sat up. Bout a minute later I heard the front door open. That door doesn't open without makin’ a hell of a ruckus. So I got up grabbin’ my robe nd headed down to see what the hell he was doin’. When I came down the door was just wide open. I looked down the street nd I see the crazy old bastard walkin’ down the road in his pajamas. I called out to him but he just kept goin’, didn't even look back, like he couldn't hear me at all. So I went after him. I tell you what, Jimmy. I don't think I've seen that old man move that fast in a decade. I chased him down as best I could, but I couldn't catch up. That's when I realized we were headin’ towards the beach. As we got closer I noticed somethin’ though, a smell, like right before a big thunderstorm. Anyway, I get to the beach nd there he was, kneelin’ by the water with his arms raised like he is praisin’ the Lord. I was bout to yell out to him again nd move closer, but I swear Jimmy, there was somethin’ movin’ under that water. I may be old, but my sight is still as good as ever. Next thing I know that fool jumps into the sea. Then he was just… gone. He never came back up, Jimmy.” As she finished a couple tears spilled down her cheeks.

I didn't say anythin’ at first. This whole thing had a bad smell to it, just like the swamp case did. My heart started poundin’ as anxiety at the thought started buildin’ inside me. I closed my eyes nd took a deep long breath to steady my nerves before lookin’ back at her.

“Was he doin’ anythin’ before all this Debs? Maybe somethin’ unusual or somethin’?” I asked.

“I don't think so, Jimmy. Well, actually the day before he was askin’ the sheriff bout the other man who died. It was one of his friends from his fishin’ days. They worked on the same boat together.” She said. “You think that has somethin’ to do with this?”

I shook my head. “No, I’m sure it's nothin’ Debs” I lied. “Thanks for goin’ over this with me. I appreciate it.”

She nodded slowly as she watched me get up nd head to the door.

“Take care of yourself Debs.” I said as I stepped back out into the cold, pullin’ the door shut behind me.

The sheriff huh? Odd thing for a man to die the exact same way after askin’ about the previous victim. If the sheriff is involved I'd have to keep an eye on him. Askin’ him about it would only tip him off if he did. I made my trek back to my office as I pondered what to do next. I turned onto the street for the docks nd saw a small crowd ahead of me. I walked over to see what the commotion was about. There were bout fifteen people by a boat. All of them were talkin’ to the captain. A man by the name of Emmet PowelI. I stopped nd listened to the conversation. 

“Was over by the dead reef.” He said loudly. “I pulled up my nets nd they were completely full! Net after net we cast. Hell, my boat's almost full right now!” He said laughin’ nd puffin’ out his chest.

Strange. Every now nd then there's a somewhat decent haul from a lucky boat, but nothin’ like that. It's been bout twenty years since any boat came full into these docks. I didn't like it. I didn't like any of this. I turned away nd headed to my office. Somethin’ was wrong here, nd unfortunately it seemed I'd be the one to have to figure it out.

For the next two days I kept an eye on Sheriff Johnson. This basically consisted of sittin’ outside the sheriff office doin’ absolutely nothin’ nd bein’ bored out of my mind. Eventually he finally broke his routine. The first thing I noted which was strange, was he actually stayed late at the office. Usually from what I had seen he leaves as quickly as possible headin’ straight home. This time though, he didn't leave till close to midnight. This actually caused me a bit of trouble, since I had to follow him extra carefully, often losin’ sight of him because nobody else was walkin’ the streets to give me any cover for bein’ out there so late. Even so, this wasn't my first rodeo. I kept out of sight, followin’ him through the streets to the edge of town. 

As the sheriff made his way through the brush I kept my distance. Only movin’ forward when I lost sight of him. I realized we were headin’ pretty close to the beach where the victims were found, just further away from the actual shore. Finally he stopped, looked around nd headin’ behind a brush covered dune. I waited, watchin’ to see where he went next, but he never came around. Slowly nd quiet-like I made my way towards the dune. I kept a wide distance nd circled to where he should have been. There in the dune was an openin’. A dark cave sat there goin’ downwards into the earth. I was about to head in when I heard a noise. Someone else was comin’, so I backed off findin’ a large brush area nd ducked down into it. Another figure came into view, cloaked in some kind of robe. They went into the cave, quickly disappearin’ into the darkness. I decided to wait to see if anyone else showed up. The last thing I wanted was to go in just to have myself pincered between these people.

I sat waitin’ in that brush nd counted five more cloaked figures that went into that cave. Knowin’ I was outnumbered nd not wantin’ to get myself into an impossible situation, I stayed sittin’ in that brush. I figured I'd wait till they all left nd explore this cave afterwards. So I waited, waited for hours until they finally came out. They darted off quickly, includin’ the sheriff. After makin’ sure the coast was clear I got up nd headed to the cave. I took one last look around nd then looked back. It was gone. Literally just disappeared in the time I had taken my eyes off it. I pressed a hand to the dune nd felt nothin’ but sand. My stomach dropped. I had hoped this wouldn't be another weird ass situation. All hope of that vanished at that moment. What the hell was goin’ on in this town?

I got back to my office nd plopped into my chair. For a while I just stared at the ceilin’, wonderin’ what the hell I should do next. My eyes slowly shifted to my safe. I got up with a sigh nd moved to it. With shakin’ hands I unlocked it, takin’ a deep breath before turnin’ the handle nd openin’ the door. The leatherbound tome sat right where I left it, unassumin’ yet ominous in my mind. I removed it from the safe nd took it back to my desk openin’ it hesitantly. The impossible tower glared at me from the page. I could practically see the emerald light emanatin’ from its peak. I quickly turned the page. The text was some form of cuneiform, but I could understand, in a way. Like a whisper in the back of my mind.

“His light shines through time and space, blessing us who are chosen.

The chosen await the seeker to breach the veil.

May He walk amongst us, showing us the truth of the abyss.”

Even bein’ able to read it didn't make it any more understandable. The next page showed another picture with script underneath it. A jewel shone on the page, I could guess what kind of light emanated from its depths.

“It connects us to the void, to Him.

It is the key, a small piece of His light.

Through shattered dreams the way will open.

The dweller of the deep holds the key’ where the black pyramid keeps vigil.”

Dweller of the deep… the name itself made me nauseous. I closed the book, feelin’ a bit ill. Memories of the swamp flooded my brain. The smell of burnin’ flesh fillin’ my nostrils. I grabbed the nearby trash bin, vomitin’ what little food I had eaten earlier in the day. My head swam as I lifted myself back up. My vision blurrin’ as the light seemed to dim. Shadows shifted around the blurred tunnel of my vision. Hands gently cupped my face as it was lifted to meet green eyes. Another pair covered my eyes from behind, leavin’ me in darkness. Suddenly, thick soft rope-like appendages wrapped around my wrists, the slick leathery flesh tightenin’ around them nd pullin’ me down to my knees. Before I could scream another wrapped around my throat nd squeezed tight.

“Shhh…” A feminine whisper reached my ears, “You're almost there James… so close..”

I awoke to the sun stingin’ my eyes. My body was prone on the floor of my office in an awkward position. I pushed myself up, feelin’ sore nd stiff. I could still feel the moist undulatin’ appendages on my wrists nd neck. I looked down at my wrists. where large bruises wrapped around them. I assumed there was one on my neck as well. My hands began to shake as I pressed them into my chest, just sittin’ there as I tried to calm myself. Eventually I got up off the floor, my gait unsteady as I went back to my desk chair nd sat down. I picked up my phone nd dialed in a number.

“Tom, I need your help.”

Tom sat in my office as I explained what I discovered. I had to give the guy credit. He listened to every word I said before callin’ me crazy.

“Jimmy, I think you're losin’ your shit.” He stated matter of factly. “A cave that disappears. The sheriff part of some cult. I don't like the guy either, but that doesn't mean he is worshippin’ Satan, nd what the hell happened to your neck?”

“It's not Satan, Tom.” I said with a sigh, ignorin’ his inquiry bout my bruises. “I don't know what it is honestly, but it's bad. Listen, you ain’t gotta believe me, I'll show you. Just wait for my call nd meet me here.” I pointed out a spot on a map of the town nd surroundin’ areas. The same spot where the cave appeared before. “Just when you get there stay hidden nd keep an eye out. You'll see, Tom, I swear to you.”

Tom eyeballed me for a good ten seconds before respondin’ with a look like he was entertainin’ a child. “Fine Jimmy, but if this turns out to be bullshit then you better go get some help.”

I nodded to him nd with one long last look he turned around nd left the office. I leaned back in my chair as I watched him go, fiddlin’ with a pen on my desk as I contemplated my next move. I'd have to wait again. I'd have to watch the sheriff nd call Tom the next time he stayed late at the office. I felt bad gettin’ Tom involved, but I barely made it out alive from the swamp, nd I had help back then too. I'd have to be more careful this time. I had to make sure we both survived whatever encounter awaited us in that cave.

Another long, borin’ week passed by. I watched the sheriff the same as before, nd just like before he followed the same routine, until he didn't. When the sheriff was two hours past his usual leavin’ time I called Tom. 

“Tonight Tom. Be there before midnight, nd be armed.” I said into the phone before hangin’ up, not waitin’ for a response.

When he left about thirty minutes before midnight I followed. I was just as careful as before, no, perhaps even more careful. I didn't even see him step into the cave because I stayed so far behind. I circled the dune of the cave just like before, headin’ to the same hidin’ spot I had used previously. As I neared it a hand grabbed my jacket nd pulled me down into the brush. It was Tom, lookin’ at me all bug-eyed.

“Jesus Tom, you nearly made me piss myself.” I said, swallowin’ down the scream that almost erupted from my throat.

“Yea, you're freaked out?” Said Tom, his voice shakin’ slightly. “How do you think I feel? What the fuck is this Jimmy?”

“I already told you, be quiet, more people are gonna show up.” I said, turnin’ my attention to the cave entrance.

As if on queue more people showed nd entered the cave. Tom nd I watched silently until I counted the same amount of people walkin’ in as before. We waited a small bit longer. I didn’t wanna be caught off guard by extras possibly showin’ up to whatever this was. I got up from the ground nd motioned for Tom to follow quietly. He was hesitant at first, but I saw him set his jaw, eyes narrowin’ in a newly determined look as he nodded nd began to follow. He drew his pistol nd I drew my own revolver in response. Then, we headed into the cave.

The cave was dark, damp nd cold. It got so dark at one point we had to keep a hand on the wall to keep our bearin’. We walked for a long time. How long I don't know. The lack of light made it hard to guess time or any kind of distance traveled. Then I smelled it. There was a scent of ozone in the area, growin’ stronger as we moved. Ahead of us a cold bluish light began to shine into the tunnel. Soon I could see an exit nd as we neared it I looked back at Tom. He looked back at me wide-eyed, sweat drippin’ down his brow. Turnin’ back I stepped onto the narrow path beyond the stiflin’ tunnel.

I stopped dead in my tracks as I saw what lay before us. Tom ran into my back before grabbin’ my shoulder nd steadyin’ himself. I swear I heard a small whimper escape from him as he did, but I didn't blame him as I looked at our surroundin’s. We were on a narrow bridge-like path, one side had a ledge about waist high nd every so often a torch jutted up from it burnin’ with a bluish white flame. There was  nothin’ holdin’ up the gray lookin’ rock we stood on. To our left was a drop that seemed to go at least a hundred feet before meetin’ black still water. I felt drops of wetness splatterin’ down on us now nd then, nd lookin’ up I was met with another lake of the same black water, only this time grey lights shifted beneath it, or above it? Some of the lights were single, others in pairs, some in strange clusters. I pulled my gaze away to look further down the bridge. There in what seemed like miles ahead of us, yet only a few hundred feet was a black pyramid, juttin’ out of the water. Dark obelisks surrounded it, the surfaces of all were smooth nd seamless as if made of single pieces of obsidian. I realized then the only color around us was the blue of the flames, nd it faded into the same greyish light that seemed to illuminate our path.

I felt Tom's hand shakin’ on my shoulder. I quickly looked back nd took his head in my hands turnin’ it to face me.

“Don’t look too hard, Tom. Don't think too hard. Focus on me. Don’t let it enter your mind ok?” I said, lookin’ into his shaky eyes to see if he understood. He swallowed hard nd seemed to focus on me just a bit better. “Listen, if you need to go back, then go back. I won't blame you. Do what you have to do, Tom.”

He seemed to look at me then, really look. Then he closed his eyes, swallowed hard nd took a deep breath. Finally he opened them nd his gaze seemed much more solid. 

He grimaced nd shook his head. “No Jimmy, I can't leave you here alone, nd.. I need to see what this is. I can't turn back now.”

I nodded nd patted his shoulders, grateful for him stickin’ at my side. I turned around nd began to walk the path to either death or madness.

The walk to the pyramid was silent nd short. Much shorter than should have been expected. As we reached the entrance, a smooth rectangular entryway that showed no signs of a builder's touch, I looked back. The exit from the tunnel wasn't even visible, as if we had walked miles from where we started. We entered the pyramid. I took one wall while Tom took the other. We both moved forward slowly. As we made our way further inside, carved murals began to show on the walls. I say carved, but once again there was no sign of tool marks, just smooth glass-like rock formin’ strange pictures. Some showed humanoid creatures that seemed to be mixed with an angler fish. Fins jutted from their arms nd long teeth from their mouths. Their eyes were bulbous on their fish-like heads. I saw the tower again depicted in another carvin’. Its shape more true than the picture in the grimoire, but not quite as blasphemous as the visions I had seen. Either way it hurt my eyes to look upon them. They seemed to shift nd move without actually doin’ so. I looked away nd saw Tom opposite me rubbin’ his eyes. I looked at him raisin’ an eyebrow to silently ask if he was doin’ ok. He looked back with reddened eyes nd nodded. His face fixed into a look of grim determination as we continued our way further into the pyramid’s depths.

As we delved deeper we began to hear somethin’. There was a chantin’ comin’ from ahead. I gripped my revolver tighter as we walked. Tryin’ to be silent as a chamber opened ahead of us. We stayed back in the entryway when we reached the room. It was round nd tall. We could see the cloaked figures standin’ in a circle. Their arms were up as they chanted in a language that reminded me of the cultists in the swamp, but it was what sat in the middle that truly put fear in my heart. Sittin’ center was a large, mummified creature. It had to be at least thirty feet tall sittin’ down. I could see the sharp teeth juttin’ from its dried gums. Dry, dead eyes sat bulbously on the sides of its withered head. Long skeletal arms came down its sides nd folded in its lap, endin’ in webbed nd clawed hands. In front of its dried husk floated an object omittin’ a familiar emerald light. It was the jewel from the book, floatin’ nd pulsin’ with the chants of the people around it. This must be the dweller in the deep.

The ceilin’ was the same black water from outside. And as we watched a figure fell from the water. It was one of the townsfolk. That same fisherman who had been braggin’ bout his impossible catch. As we stood watchin’ he writhed on the ground in front of the jewel. Then slowly his flesh began to sink in on itself. He grew thinner nd thinner until just like the creature before him, he became nothin’ but a dried husk of a man. He let out one final gasp of breath before one of the hooded figured picked him up nd carried him to a small slot in the wall. He pushed the corpse into it nd a splash was heard after a moment.

Tom stood on the opposite wall from me mouth agape as he looked into the room. I tried to silently get his attention but his eyes were fixed. Tears began drippin’ from them as he stood unblinkin’. I made my way quietly to his side nd turned him away from the nightmarish sight. He blinked stupidly at me for a moment before wipin’ his eyes nd liftin’ his pistol. Then he looked me dead in the eye. I knew then we weren't leavin’ this place without a fight. Noddin’ I lifted my revolver as well, turnin’ towards the room nd takin’ aim.

The next moments were a blur of muzzle flashes nd movin’ bodies. We fired again nd again. The people there fallin’ to the ground one by one as we shot them down. We didn’t think, didn't have to. We would end this blasphemy here nd now. I pulled my trigger over nd over till only clicks came from my gun. The empty cylinder spinnin’ with each pull of my finger. Tom stood beside me as both of us lowered our weapons. Tears streamed down his face as he looked around, his gun still smokin’ from expendin’ its magazine. My eyes were fixed however. The jewel pulled me closer to it nd soon I was standin’ before it, lookin’ into its emerald depths. I felt Tom's hand on my shoulder nd his voice registered in my ears.

“Jimmy, we have to go man.” He said lookin’ at me.

I reached out a hand to the jewel, when suddenly another movement caught my eye beyond it. The creature. I stared for a moment nd felt Tom's hand grip my shoulder even harder. One of the fingers on that horrendous clawed hand began to curl slowly inward. 

We both turned nd took flight. I don't remember gettin’ outside but suddenly we were both on the sandy ground heavin’ in breath. I looked back behind us, but the cave was gone once again. I stood up weakly lookin’ at Tom nd smilin’ the best I could.

“We did it Tom. We stopped them, nd made it out in one piece.” I said with a small chuckle of relief.

But Tom wasn't smilin’, he wasn't even lookin at me. Instead he was lookin’ down at my hand where I held my gun, his face givin’ off a sickly green glow.

“Tom, what's wrong?” I said lookin’ down at my hand.

It wasn't my gun. It was the jewel, glowin’ brightly in my grip nd coverin’ us with its strange greenish light. I felt terror grip my chest as I looked at it. When did I grab it? How did I not realize it was in my hand? Then I felt somethin’ cold nd wet hit my neck once, then again. I looked up nd saw small flakes of snow fallin’ from a dark cloudy sky. It didn't snow here.

Parents always tell you there's no such thing as monsters. I'm not so sure about that anymore. What if you look into the dark nd find there actually is somethin’ there? Nobody prepares you for the loss of sleep. Nobody prepares you for the utter fear of seein’ that shadow in the corner actually start movin’. You always think there' s somethin’ you can do about it. Let me tell you straight, there ain’t. Once the dark knows you're there, there ain' t nothin’ you can do to keep it from findin’ you.

I’d been out the hospital bout’ two weeks nd it ain’t been no walk in the park. Ever since the swamp, things have been.. off. Maybe that's an understatement, but it's hard to describe what's happenin’ to me. I see things now, in the shadows. I see things movin’, shapes nd figures in the dark. I leave the lights on in my apartment now, but that doesn't stop the dreams. I see that impossible tower in its monochrome landscape. I see that eerie green light flowin’ like water as if it’s alive. I see Mary.

I awoke early, nd immediately knew somethin’ was wrong. The room was dark and quiet. I stayed still,that conjures demons from the dark. Then I felt the cold hand slide over my bicep nd grip firmly. It pulled me onto my back nd I couldn't help but look next to me. Layin’ there starin’ at me with those emerald glowin’ eyes was Mary, practically naked except for the sheer green garment she was wrapped in. She was no longer the mud-covered fanatic I met in the swamp. She was clean nd ghostly pale, luminescent even. Suddenly her eyes rolled back into her head nd her mouth gaped open wide. A thick, slimy black tendril pushed its way out of her mouth as I watched in horror. I pushed myself away, fallin’ onto the floor. My body hit the ground nd with a blink the world changed. It was mornin’, nd the gulls cawed loudly outside my window. I looked at the empty bed nd sagged into myself lettin’ out the breath I didn't realize I was holdin’.

I took my time gettin’ ready, tryin’ to put back together my frayed nerves. As I finished, I looked in the direction of my safe where I had stashed that heretical book. I tried lookin’ at it before, but as soon as I saw the best possible rendition of the Emerald Tower I locked it away. I knew I'd have to look at it some time, but that time wasn’t today, nor hopefully any time soon. I quickly finished up, suddenly wantin’ to be as far from that safe as possible, when I heard a knock on my office door.

“Great..” I muttered to myself as I began headin’ down.

I unlocked the door nd opened it slightly, turnin’ around without lookin’ nd headin’ to my desk.

“Mornin’ deputy.” I said as I grabbed the whiskey bottle nd poured a bit into the cold coffee still on my desk from yesterday.

“How’d ya know it was me?” said Deputy Tom Bellham as he stepped into the door, closin’ it behind him.

“Just a feelin’ Tom.” I said, as I popped two Seltzer tabs into the coffee as well nd stared at it as it bubbled nd frothed. I've been havin’ those too, feelin’s, like my intuition has skyrocketed to new heights.

I side-eyed Tom as he stepped further into my office. I could tell he was uncomfortable. Most people around here have treated me differently since the swamp incident. Maybe it’s because of the rumours of what happened or maybe it's because of my newly green eyes. Could be both for all I know, but I've learned not to make eye contact anymore.

“So did you need somethin’ Tom, or did you just come to stand here?” I said takin’ a sip of my mornin’ concoction.

Tom shifted his feet a bit before answerin’. “I’m guessin’ you ain’t heard the news lately, Jimmy?”

“No Tom, I haven't heard any news. Been sorta keepin’ to myself lately.” I said starin’ into my coffee cup.

“Yea...” Tom said, before continuin’ hesitantly, ""We've had some strangeness in town, Jimmy. Two people are dead.”

I looked at Tom for a moment, his eyes shiftin’ away quickly from mine. “Sounds like your jurisdiction Tom, not mine.”

Tom lets out a long sigh before speakin’, “yea I know Jimmy, but I’m at a loss on this, nd you know the sheriff isn't doin’ a damn thing about it. I could use your help on this one.”

I nodded lookin’ away again nd finishin’ the rest of my coffee. “Alright Tom, tell me what’s goin’ on.” I said walkin’ round my desk nd sittin’ in my chair.

Tom sat down nd went into the details. Apparently the two people died exactly the same way. Both had drowned, but the strange thing was they were found the next day shriveled nd untouched by the water life. Also it’s reported that the second actually walked into the water themselves, nd there’s some evidence the first did the same, though there’s no witnesses. The coroner report basically said the bodies were drained of all fluids. Which is hard to believe since they apparently died in the ocean.

I leaned back in my chair as Tom finished his explanation. “I’m not really sure what I can do with that Tom, not much to go on there.”

Tom nods thoughtfully for a moment, “Yea I know Jimmy, just maybe look into it for me, see if there’s anythin’ I missed.”

“Yea alright, I can do that for you, just keep me updated.” I said.

“Alright Jimmy. Thanks.” He said gettin’ up from his chair. “I’ll see ya round.”

With that Tom walked out the door leavin’ me to ponder the situation. If I didn't know better I'd say this was all coincidence, but even in normal situations, coincidences are a rare thing.

I mulled over things for a moment. Most likely both deaths occurred sometime in the night. I doubt visitin’ the site durin’ the day would yield anythin’ new. Tom may be the only real law in town, but he was pretty thorough. What I could do was talk to the witness of the second incident, Debbie Thornwell. I looked up at the clock nd sighed. Better now than later I suppose.

I got up from my desk, grabbin’ my jacket nd headin’ to the door.

The mornin’ air was brisk as I walked down the damp streets of Portsmouth. The familiar scent of rottin’ fish hangin’ in the cold air. A light fog hung stubbornly as I passed abandoned shops, the sun not yet warm enough to send it to its grave. I pulled up my collar to try nd block the chill wind nd turned down the street to Debbie's home. I looked up at the ramshackle house before walkin’ up its creaky steps nd knockin’ on the door.

The door cracked open, the swollen wood givin’ some trouble before releasin’ the door from its confines. I could see a sliver of Debbie's face, eyes swollen on her weathered face.

“Jimmy, what do you need hun? It ain’t a good time.” She said wearily, lettin’ the door creep open a little more.

“Yea I know Debs. I’m helpin’ Tom with the situation. Just wanted to go over what you saw the other night. Also, I'm sorry for your loss.”

“Everybody’s sorry Jimmy. Doesn't change the fact my husband walked into the sea without any warnin’ or reason.” She said with a heavy sigh. “Come on in Jimmy.”

She opened the door further lettin’ me into the home. Despite outward appearances the inside was warm, cozy nd well lit. I stopped inside nd followed her into the livin’ room where she sat in a well worn lazyboy. Another sat not too far from her, also well worn. I decided to sit on the couch. I sat nd waited for her to begin. There wasn't any rush nd I wasn't gonna push her to start.

“It was bout three in the mornin’ when I felt him get out of bed. At first I thought he was just goin’ to the bathroom, but when I realized the light hadn't turned on I sat up. Bout a minute later I heard the front door open. That door doesn't open without makin’ a hell of a ruckus. So I got up grabbin’ my robe nd headed down to see what the hell he was doin’. When I came down the door was just wide open. I looked down the street nd I see the crazy old bastard walkin’ down the road in his pajamas. I called out to him but he just kept goin’, didn't even look back, like he couldn't hear me at all. So I went after him. I tell you what, Jimmy. I don't think I've seen that old man move that fast in a decade. I chased him down as best I could, but I couldn't catch up. That's when I realized we were headin’ towards the beach. As we got closer I noticed somethin’ though, a smell, like right before a big thunderstorm. Anyway, I get to the beach nd there he was, kneelin’ by the water with his arms raised like he is praisin’ the Lord. I was bout to yell out to him again nd move closer, but I swear Jimmy, there was somethin’ movin’ under that water. I may be old, but my sight is still as good as ever. Next thing I know that fool jumps into the sea. Then he was just… gone. He never came back up, Jimmy.” As she finished a couple tears spilled down her cheeks.

I didn't say anythin’ at first. This whole thing had a bad smell to it, just like the swamp case did. My heart started poundin’ as anxiety at the thought started buildin’ inside me. I closed my eyes nd took a deep long breath to steady my nerves before lookin’ back at her.

“Was he doin’ anythin’ before all this Debs? Maybe somethin’ unusual or somethin’?” I asked.

“I don't think so, Jimmy. Well, actually the day before he was askin’ the sheriff bout the other man who died. It was one of his friends from his fishin’ days. They worked on the same boat together.” She said. “You think that has somethin’ to do with this?”

I shook my head. “No, I’m sure it's nothin’ Debs” I lied. “Thanks for goin’ over this with me. I appreciate it.”

She nodded slowly as she watched me get up nd head to the door.

“Take care of yourself Debs.” I said as I stepped back out into the cold, pullin’ the door shut behind me.

The sheriff huh? Odd thing for a man to die the exact same way after askin’ about the previous victim. If the sheriff is involved I'd have to keep an eye on him. Askin’ him about it would only tip him off if he did. I made my trek back to my office as I pondered what to do next. I turned onto the street for the docks nd saw a small crowd ahead of me. I walked over to see what the commotion was about. There were bout fifteen people by a boat. All of them were talkin’ to the captain. A man by the name of Emmet PowelI. I stopped nd listened to the conversation. 

“Was over by the dead reef.” He said loudly. “I pulled up my nets nd they were completely full! Net after net we cast. Hell, my boat's almost full right now!” He said laughin’ nd puffin’ out his chest.

Strange. Every now nd then there's a somewhat decent haul from a lucky boat, but nothin’ like that. It's been bout twenty years since any boat came full into these docks. I didn't like it. I didn't like any of this. I turned away nd headed to my office. Somethin’ was wrong here, nd unfortunately it seemed I'd be the one to have to figure it out.

For the next two days I kept an eye on Sheriff Johnson. This basically consisted of sittin’ outside the sheriff office doin’ absolutely nothin’ nd bein’ bored out of my mind. Eventually he finally broke his routine. The first thing I noted which was strange, was he actually stayed late at the office. Usually from what I had seen he leaves as quickly as possible headin’ straight home. This time though, he didn't leave till close to midnight. This actually caused me a bit of trouble, since I had to follow him extra carefully, often losin’ sight of him because nobody else was walkin’ the streets to give me any cover for bein’ out there so late. Even so, this wasn't my first rodeo. I kept out of sight, followin’ him through the streets to the edge of town. 

As the sheriff made his way through the brush I kept my distance. Only movin’ forward when I lost sight of him. I realized we were headin’ pretty close to the beach where the victims were found, just further away from the actual shore. Finally he stopped, looked around nd headin’ behind a brush covered dune. I waited, watchin’ to see where he went next, but he never came around. Slowly nd quiet-like I made my way towards the dune. I kept a wide distance nd circled to where he should have been. There in the dune was an openin’. A dark cave sat there goin’ downwards into the earth. I was about to head in when I heard a noise. Someone else was comin’, so I backed off findin’ a large brush area nd ducked down into it. Another figure came into view, cloaked in some kind of robe. They went into the cave, quickly disappearin’ into the darkness. I decided to wait to see if anyone else showed up. The last thing I wanted was to go in just to have myself pincered between these people.

I sat waitin’ in that brush nd counted five more cloaked figures that went into that cave. Knowin’ I was outnumbered nd not wantin’ to get myself into an impossible situation, I stayed sittin’ in that brush. I figured I'd wait till they all left nd explore this cave afterwards. So I waited, waited for hours until they finally came out. They darted off quickly, includin’ the sheriff. After makin’ sure the coast was clear I got up nd headed to the cave. I took one last look around nd then looked back. It was gone. Literally just disappeared in the time I had taken my eyes off it. I pressed a hand to the dune nd felt nothin’ but sand. My stomach dropped. I had hoped this wouldn't be another weird ass situation. All hope of that vanished at that moment. What the hell was goin’ on in this town?

I got back to my office nd plopped into my chair. For a while I just stared at the ceilin’, wonderin’ what the hell I should do next. My eyes slowly shifted to my safe. I got up with a sigh nd moved to it. With shakin’ hands I unlocked it, takin’ a deep breath before turnin’ the handle nd openin’ the door. The leatherbound tome sat right where I left it, unassumin’ yet ominous in my mind. I removed it from the safe nd took it back to my desk openin’ it hesitantly. The impossible tower glared at me from the page. I could practically see the emerald light emanatin’ from its peak. I quickly turned the page. The text was some form of cuneiform, but I could understand, in a way. Like a whisper in the back of my mind.

“His light shines through time and space, blessing us who are chosen.

The chosen await the seeker to breach the veil.

May He walk amongst us, showing us the truth of the abyss.”

Even bein’ able to read it didn't make it any more understandable. The next page showed another picture with script underneath it. A jewel shone on the page, I could guess what kind of light emanated from its depths.

“It connects us to the void, to Him.

It is the key, a small piece of His light.

Through shattered dreams the way will open.

The dweller of the deep holds the key’ where the black pyramid keeps vigil.”

Dweller of the deep… the name itself made me nauseous. I closed the book, feelin’ a bit ill. Memories of the swamp flooded my brain. The smell of burnin’ flesh fillin’ my nostrils. I grabbed the nearby trash bin, vomitin’ what little food I had eaten earlier in the day. My head swam as I lifted myself back up. My vision blurrin’ as the light seemed to dim. Shadows shifted around the blurred tunnel of my vision. Hands gently cupped my face as it was lifted to meet green eyes. Another pair covered my eyes from behind, leavin’ me in darkness. Suddenly, thick soft rope-like appendages wrapped around my wrists, the slick leathery flesh tightenin’ around them nd pullin’ me down to my knees. Before I could scream another wrapped around my throat nd squeezed tight.

“Shhh…” A feminine whisper reached my ears, “You're almost there James… so close..”

I awoke to the sun stingin’ my eyes. My body was prone on the floor of my office in an awkward position. I pushed myself up, feelin’ sore nd stiff. I could still feel the moist undulatin’ appendages on my wrists nd neck. I looked down at my wrists. where large bruises wrapped around them. I assumed there was one on my neck as well. My hands began to shake as I pressed them into my chest, just sittin’ there as I tried to calm myself. Eventually I got up off the floor, my gait unsteady as I went back to my desk chair nd sat down. I picked up my phone nd dialed in a number.

“Tom, I need your help.”

Tom sat in my office as I explained what I discovered. I had to give the guy credit. He listened to every word I said before callin’ me crazy.

“Jimmy, I think you're losin’ your shit.” He stated matter of factly. “A cave that disappears. The sheriff part of some cult. I don't like the guy either, but that doesn't mean he is worshippin’ Satan, nd what the hell happened to your neck?”

“It's not Satan, Tom.” I said with a sigh, ignorin’ his inquiry bout my bruises. “I don't know what it is honestly, but it's bad. Listen, you ain’t gotta believe me, I'll show you. Just wait for my call nd meet me here.” I pointed out a spot on a map of the town nd surroundin’ areas. The same spot where the cave appeared before. “Just when you get there stay hidden nd keep an eye out. You'll see, Tom, I swear to you.”

Tom eyeballed me for a good ten seconds before respondin’ with a look like he was entertainin’ a child. “Fine Jimmy, but if this turns out to be bullshit then you better go get some help.”

I nodded to him nd with one long last look he turned around nd left the office. I leaned back in my chair as I watched him go, fiddlin’ with a pen on my desk as I contemplated my next move. I'd have to wait again. I'd have to watch the sheriff nd call Tom the next time he stayed late at the office. I felt bad gettin’ Tom involved, but I barely made it out alive from the swamp, nd I had help back then too. I'd have to be more careful this time. I had to make sure we both survived whatever encounter awaited us in that cave.

Another long, borin’ week passed by. I watched the sheriff the same as before, nd just like before he followed the same routine, until he didn't. When the sheriff was two hours past his usual leavin’ time I called Tom. 

“Tonight Tom. Be there before midnight, nd be armed.” I said into the phone before hangin’ up, not waitin’ for a response.

When he left about thirty minutes before midnight I followed. I was just as careful as before, no, perhaps even more careful. I didn't even see him step into the cave because I stayed so far behind. I circled the dune of the cave just like before, headin’ to the same hidin’ spot I had used previously. As I neared it a hand grabbed my jacket nd pulled me down into the brush. It was Tom, lookin’ at me all bug-eyed.

“Jesus Tom, you nearly made me piss myself.” I said, swallowin’ down the scream that almost erupted from my throat.

“Yea, you're freaked out?” Said Tom, his voice shakin’ slightly. “How do you think I feel? What the fuck is this Jimmy?”

“I already told you, be quiet, more people are gonna show up.” I said, turnin’ my attention to the cave entrance.

As if on queue more people showed nd entered the cave. Tom nd I watched silently until I counted the same amount of people walkin’ in as before. We waited a small bit longer. I didn’t wanna be caught off guard by extras possibly showin’ up to whatever this was. I got up from the ground nd motioned for Tom to follow quietly. He was hesitant at first, but I saw him set his jaw, eyes narrowin’ in a newly determined look as he nodded nd began to follow. He drew his pistol nd I drew my own revolver in response. Then, we headed into the cave.

The cave was dark, damp nd cold. It got so dark at one point we had to keep a hand on the wall to keep our bearin’. We walked for a long time. How long I don't know. The lack of light made it hard to guess time or any kind of distance traveled. Then I smelled it. There was a scent of ozone in the area, growin’ stronger as we moved. Ahead of us a cold bluish light began to shine into the tunnel. Soon I could see an exit nd as we neared it I looked back at Tom. He looked back at me wide-eyed, sweat drippin’ down his brow. Turnin’ back I stepped onto the narrow path beyond the stiflin’ tunnel.

I stopped dead in my tracks as I saw what lay before us. Tom ran into my back before grabbin’ my shoulder nd steadyin’ himself. I swear I heard a small whimper escape from him as he did, but I didn't blame him as I looked at our surroundin’s. We were on a narrow bridge-like path, one side had a ledge about waist high nd every so often a torch jutted up from it burnin’ with a bluish white flame. There was  nothin’ holdin’ up the gray lookin’ rock we stood on. To our left was a drop that seemed to go at least a hundred feet before meetin’ black still water. I felt drops of wetness splatterin’ down on us now nd then, nd lookin’ up I was met with another lake of the same black water, only this time grey lights shifted beneath it, or above it? Some of the lights were single, others in pairs, some in strange clusters. I pulled my gaze away to look further down the bridge. There in what seemed like miles ahead of us, yet only a few hundred feet was a black pyramid, juttin’ out of the water. Dark obelisks surrounded it, the surfaces of all were smooth nd seamless as if made of single pieces of obsidian. I realized then the only color around us was the blue of the flames, nd it faded into the same greyish light that seemed to illuminate our path.

I felt Tom's hand shakin’ on my shoulder. I quickly looked back nd took his head in my hands turnin’ it to face me.

“Don’t look too hard, Tom. Don't think too hard. Focus on me. Don’t let it enter your mind ok?” I said, lookin’ into his shaky eyes to see if he understood. He swallowed hard nd seemed to focus on me just a bit better. “Listen, if you need to go back, then go back. I won't blame you. Do what you have to do, Tom.”

He seemed to look at me then, really look. Then he closed his eyes, swallowed hard nd took a deep breath. Finally he opened them nd his gaze seemed much more solid. 

He grimaced nd shook his head. “No Jimmy, I can't leave you here alone, nd.. I need to see what this is. I can't turn back now.”

I nodded nd patted his shoulders, grateful for him stickin’ at my side. I turned around nd began to walk the path to either death or madness.

The walk to the pyramid was silent nd short. Much shorter than should have been expected. As we reached the entrance, a smooth rectangular entryway that showed no signs of a builder's touch, I looked back. The exit from the tunnel wasn't even visible, as if we had walked miles from where we started. We entered the pyramid. I took one wall while Tom took the other. We both moved forward slowly. As we made our way further inside, carved murals began to show on the walls. I say carved, but once again there was no sign of tool marks, just smooth glass-like rock formin’ strange pictures. Some showed humanoid creatures that seemed to be mixed with an angler fish. Fins jutted from their arms nd long teeth from their mouths. Their eyes were bulbous on their fish-like heads. I saw the tower again depicted in another carvin’. Its shape more true than the picture in the grimoire, but not quite as blasphemous as the visions I had seen. Either way it hurt my eyes to look upon them. They seemed to shift nd move without actually doin’ so. I looked away nd saw Tom opposite me rubbin’ his eyes. I looked at him raisin’ an eyebrow to silently ask if he was doin’ ok. He looked back with reddened eyes nd nodded. His face fixed into a look of grim determination as we continued our way further into the pyramid’s depths.

As we delved deeper we began to hear somethin’. There was a chantin’ comin’ from ahead. I gripped my revolver tighter as we walked. Tryin’ to be silent as a chamber opened ahead of us. We stayed back in the entryway when we reached the room. It was round nd tall. We could see the cloaked figures standin’ in a circle. Their arms were up as they chanted in a language that reminded me of the cultists in the swamp, but it was what sat in the middle that truly put fear in my heart. Sittin’ center was a large, mummified creature. It had to be at least thirty feet tall sittin’ down. I could see the sharp teeth juttin’ from its dried gums. Dry, dead eyes sat bulbously on the sides of its withered head. Long skeletal arms came down its sides nd folded in its lap, endin’ in webbed nd clawed hands. In front of its dried husk floated an object omittin’ a familiar emerald light. It was the jewel from the book, floatin’ nd pulsin’ with the chants of the people around it. This must be the dweller in the deep.

The ceilin’ was the same black water from outside. And as we watched a figure fell from the water. It was one of the townsfolk. That same fisherman who had been braggin’ bout his impossible catch. As we stood watchin’ he writhed on the ground in front of the jewel. Then slowly his flesh began to sink in on itself. He grew thinner nd thinner until just like the creature before him, he became nothin’ but a dried husk of a man. He let out one final gasp of breath before one of the hooded figured picked him up nd carried him to a small slot in the wall. He pushed the corpse into it nd a splash was heard after a moment.

Tom stood on the opposite wall from me mouth agape as he looked into the room. I tried to silently get his attention but his eyes were fixed. Tears began drippin’ from them as he stood unblinkin’. I made my way quietly to his side nd turned him away from the nightmarish sight. He blinked stupidly at me for a moment before wipin’ his eyes nd liftin’ his pistol. Then he looked me dead in the eye. I knew then we weren't leavin’ this place without a fight. Noddin’ I lifted my revolver as well, turnin’ towards the room nd takin’ aim.

The next moments were a blur of muzzle flashes nd movin’ bodies. We fired again nd again. The people there fallin’ to the ground one by one as we shot them down. We didn’t think, didn't have to. We would end this blasphemy here nd now. I pulled my trigger over nd over till only clicks came from my gun. The empty cylinder spinnin’ with each pull of my finger. Tom stood beside me as both of us lowered our weapons. Tears streamed down his face as he looked around, his gun still smokin’ from expendin’ its magazine. My eyes were fixed however. The jewel pulled me closer to it nd soon I was standin’ before it, lookin’ into its emerald depths. I felt Tom's hand on my shoulder nd his voice registered in my ears.

“Jimmy, we have to go man.” He said lookin’ at me.

I reached out a hand to the jewel, when suddenly another movement caught my eye beyond it. The creature. I stared for a moment nd felt Tom's hand grip my shoulder even harder. One of the fingers on that horrendous clawed hand began to curl slowly inward. 

We both turned nd took flight. I don't remember gettin’ outside but suddenly we were both on the sandy ground heavin’ in breath. I looked back behind us, but the cave was gone once again. I stood up weakly lookin’ at Tom nd smilin’ the best I could.

“We did it Tom. We stopped them, nd made it out in one piece.” I said with a small chuckle of relief.

But Tom wasn't smilin’, he wasn't even lookin at me. Instead he was lookin’ down at my hand where I held my gun, his face givin’ off a sickly green glow.

“Tom, what's wrong?” I said lookin’ down at my hand.

It wasn't my gun. It was the jewel, glowin’ brightly in my grip nd coverin’ us with its strange greenish light. I felt terror grip my chest as I looked at it. When did I grab it? How did I not realize it was in my hand? Then I felt somethin’ cold nd wet hit my neck once, then again. I looked up nd saw small flakes of snow fallin’ from a dark cloudy sky. It didn't snow here.

Parents always tell you there's no such thing as monsters. I'm not so sure about that anymore. What if you look into the dark nd find there actually is somethin’ there? Nobody prepares you for the loss of sleep. Nobody prepares you for the utter fear of seein’ that shadow in the corner actually start movin’. You always think there' s somethin’ you can do about it. Let me tell you straight, there ain’t. Once the dark knows you're there, there ain' t nothin’ you can do to keep it from findin’ you.

I’d been out the hospital bout’ two weeks nd it ain’t been no walk in the park. Ever since the swamp, things have been.. off. Maybe that's an understatement, but it's hard to describe what's happenin’ to me. I see things now, in the shadows. I see things movin’, shapes nd figures in the dark. I leave the lights on in my apartment now, but that doesn't stop the dreams. I see that impossible tower in its monochrome landscape. I see that eerie green light flowin’ like water as if it’s alive. I see Mary.

I awoke early, nd immediately knew somethin’ was wrong. The room was dark and quiet. I stayed still,that conjures demons from the dark. Then I felt the cold hand slide over my bicep nd grip firmly. It pulled me onto my back nd I couldn't help but look next to me. Layin’ there starin’ at me with those emerald glowin’ eyes was Mary, practically naked except for the sheer green garment she was wrapped in. She was no longer the mud-covered fanatic I met in the swamp. She was clean nd ghostly pale, luminescent even. Suddenly her eyes rolled back into her head nd her mouth gaped open wide. A thick, slimy black tendril pushed its way out of her mouth as I watched in horror. I pushed myself away, fallin’ onto the floor. My body hit the ground nd with a blink the world changed. It was mornin’, nd the gulls cawed loudly outside my window. I looked at the empty bed nd sagged into myself lettin’ out the breath I didn't realize I was holdin’.

I took my time gettin’ ready, tryin’ to put back together my frayed nerves. As I finished, I looked in the direction of my safe where I had stashed that heretical book. I tried lookin’ at it before, but as soon as I saw the best possible rendition of the Emerald Tower I locked it away. I knew I'd have to look at it some time, but that time wasn’t today, nor hopefully any time soon. I quickly finished up, suddenly wantin’ to be as far from that safe as possible, when I heard a knock on my office door.

“Great..” I muttered to myself as I began headin’ down.

I unlocked the door nd opened it slightly, turnin’ around without lookin’ nd headin’ to my desk.

“Mornin’ deputy.” I said as I grabbed the whiskey bottle nd poured a bit into the cold coffee still on my desk from yesterday.

“How’d ya know it was me?” said Deputy Tom Bellham as he stepped into the door, closin’ it behind him.

“Just a feelin’ Tom.” I said, as I popped two Seltzer tabs into the coffee as well nd stared at it as it bubbled nd frothed. I've been havin’ those too, feelin’s, like my intuition has skyrocketed to new heights.

I side-eyed Tom as he stepped further into my office. I could tell he was uncomfortable. Most people around here have treated me differently since the swamp incident. Maybe it’s because of the rumours of what happened or maybe it's because of my newly green eyes. Could be both for all I know, but I've learned not to make eye contact anymore.

“So did you need somethin’ Tom, or did you just come to stand here?” I said takin’ a sip of my mornin’ concoction.

Tom shifted his feet a bit before answerin’. “I’m guessin’ you ain’t heard the news lately, Jimmy?”

“No Tom, I haven't heard any news. Been sorta keepin’ to myself lately.” I said starin’ into my coffee cup.

“Yea...” Tom said, before continuin’ hesitantly, ""We've had some strangeness in town, Jimmy. Two people are dead.”

I looked at Tom for a moment, his eyes shiftin’ away quickly from mine. “Sounds like your jurisdiction Tom, not mine.”

Tom lets out a long sigh before speakin’, “yea I know Jimmy, but I’m at a loss on this, nd you know the sheriff isn't doin’ a damn thing about it. I could use your help on this one.”

I nodded lookin’ away again nd finishin’ the rest of my coffee. “Alright Tom, tell me what’s goin’ on.” I said walkin’ round my desk nd sittin’ in my chair.

Tom sat down nd went into the details. Apparently the two people died exactly the same way. Both had drowned, but the strange thing was they were found the next day shriveled nd untouched by the water life. Also it’s reported that the second actually walked into the water themselves, nd there’s some evidence the first did the same, though there’s no witnesses. The coroner report basically said the bodies were drained of all fluids. Which is hard to believe since they apparently died in the ocean.

I leaned back in my chair as Tom finished his explanation. “I’m not really sure what I can do with that Tom, not much to go on there.”

Tom nods thoughtfully for a moment, “Yea I know Jimmy, just maybe look into it for me, see if there’s anythin’ I missed.”

“Yea alright, I can do that for you, just keep me updated.” I said.

“Alright Jimmy. Thanks.” He said gettin’ up from his chair. “I’ll see ya round.”

With that Tom walked out the door leavin’ me to ponder the situation. If I didn't know better I'd say this was all coincidence, but even in normal situations, coincidences are a rare thing.

I mulled over things for a moment. Most likely both deaths occurred sometime in the night. I doubt visitin’ the site durin’ the day would yield anythin’ new. Tom may be the only real law in town, but he was pretty thorough. What I could do was talk to the witness of the second incident, Debbie Thornwell. I looked up at the clock nd sighed. Better now than later I suppose.

I got up from my desk, grabbin’ my jacket nd headin’ to the door.

The mornin’ air was brisk as I walked down the damp streets of Portsmouth. The familiar scent of rottin’ fish hangin’ in the cold air. A light fog hung stubbornly as I passed abandoned shops, the sun not yet warm enough to send it to its grave. I pulled up my collar to try nd block the chill wind nd turned down the street to Debbie's home. I looked up at the ramshackle house before walkin’ up its creaky steps nd knockin’ on the door.

The door cracked open, the swollen wood givin’ some trouble before releasin’ the door from its confines. I could see a sliver of Debbie's face, eyes swollen on her weathered face.

“Jimmy, what do you need hun? It ain’t a good time.” She said wearily, lettin’ the door creep open a little more.

“Yea I know Debs. I’m helpin’ Tom with the situation. Just wanted to go over what you saw the other night. Also, I'm sorry for your loss.”

“Everybody’s sorry Jimmy. Doesn't change the fact my husband walked into the sea without any warnin’ or reason.” She said with a heavy sigh. “Come on in Jimmy.”

She opened the door further lettin’ me into the home. Despite outward appearances the inside was warm, cozy nd well lit. I stopped inside nd followed her into the livin’ room where she sat in a well worn lazyboy. Another sat not too far from her, also well worn. I decided to sit on the couch. I sat nd waited for her to begin. There wasn't any rush nd I wasn't gonna push her to start.

“It was bout three in the mornin’ when I felt him get out of bed. At first I thought he was just goin’ to the bathroom, but when I realized the light hadn't turned on I sat up. Bout a minute later I heard the front door open. That door doesn't open without makin’ a hell of a ruckus. So I got up grabbin’ my robe nd headed down to see what the hell he was doin’. When I came down the door was just wide open. I looked down the street nd I see the crazy old bastard walkin’ down the road in his pajamas. I called out to him but he just kept goin’, didn't even look back, like he couldn't hear me at all. So I went after him. I tell you what, Jimmy. I don't think I've seen that old man move that fast in a decade. I chased him down as best I could, but I couldn't catch up. That's when I realized we were headin’ towards the beach. As we got closer I noticed somethin’ though, a smell, like right before a big thunderstorm. Anyway, I get to the beach nd there he was, kneelin’ by the water with his arms raised like he is praisin’ the Lord. I was bout to yell out to him again nd move closer, but I swear Jimmy, there was somethin’ movin’ under that water. I may be old, but my sight is still as good as ever. Next thing I know that fool jumps into the sea. Then he was just… gone. He never came back up, Jimmy.” As she finished a couple tears spilled down her cheeks.

I didn't say anythin’ at first. This whole thing had a bad smell to it, just like the swamp case did. My heart started poundin’ as anxiety at the thought started buildin’ inside me. I closed my eyes nd took a deep long breath to steady my nerves before lookin’ back at her.

“Was he doin’ anythin’ before all this Debs? Maybe somethin’ unusual or somethin’?” I asked.

“I don't think so, Jimmy. Well, actually the day before he was askin’ the sheriff bout the other man who died. It was one of his friends from his fishin’ days. They worked on the same boat together.” She said. “You think that has somethin’ to do with this?”

I shook my head. “No, I’m sure it's nothin’ Debs” I lied. “Thanks for goin’ over this with me. I appreciate it.”

She nodded slowly as she watched me get up nd head to the door.

“Take care of yourself Debs.” I said as I stepped back out into the cold, pullin’ the door shut behind me.

The sheriff huh? Odd thing for a man to die the exact same way after askin’ about the previous victim. If the sheriff is involved I'd have to keep an eye on him. Askin’ him about it would only tip him off if he did. I made my trek back to my office as I pondered what to do next. I turned onto the street for the docks nd saw a small crowd ahead of me. I walked over to see what the commotion was about. There were bout fifteen people by a boat. All of them were talkin’ to the captain. A man by the name of Emmet PowelI. I stopped nd listened to the conversation. 

“Was over by the dead reef.” He said loudly. “I pulled up my nets nd they were completely full! Net after net we cast. Hell, my boat's almost full right now!” He said laughin’ nd puffin’ out his chest.

Strange. Every now nd then there's a somewhat decent haul from a lucky boat, but nothin’ like that. It's been bout twenty years since any boat came full into these docks. I didn't like it. I didn't like any of this. I turned away nd headed to my office. Somethin’ was wrong here, nd unfortunately it seemed I'd be the one to have to figure it out.

For the next two days I kept an eye on Sheriff Johnson. This basically consisted of sittin’ outside the sheriff office doin’ absolutely nothin’ nd bein’ bored out of my mind. Eventually he finally broke his routine. The first thing I noted which was strange, was he actually stayed late at the office. Usually from what I had seen he leaves as quickly as possible headin’ straight home. This time though, he didn't leave till close to midnight. This actually caused me a bit of trouble, since I had to follow him extra carefully, often losin’ sight of him because nobody else was walkin’ the streets to give me any cover for bein’ out there so late. Even so, this wasn't my first rodeo. I kept out of sight, followin’ him through the streets to the edge of town. 

As the sheriff made his way through the brush I kept my distance. Only movin’ forward when I lost sight of him. I realized we were headin’ pretty close to the beach where the victims were found, just further away from the actual shore. Finally he stopped, looked around nd headin’ behind a brush covered dune. I waited, watchin’ to see where he went next, but he never came around. Slowly nd quiet-like I made my way towards the dune. I kept a wide distance nd circled to where he should have been. There in the dune was an openin’. A dark cave sat there goin’ downwards into the earth. I was about to head in when I heard a noise. Someone else was comin’, so I backed off findin’ a large brush area nd ducked down into it. Another figure came into view, cloaked in some kind of robe. They went into the cave, quickly disappearin’ into the darkness. I decided to wait to see if anyone else showed up. The last thing I wanted was to go in just to have myself pincered between these people.

I sat waitin’ in that brush nd counted five more cloaked figures that went into that cave. Knowin’ I was outnumbered nd not wantin’ to get myself into an impossible situation, I stayed sittin’ in that brush. I figured I'd wait till they all left nd explore this cave afterwards. So I waited, waited for hours until they finally came out. They darted off quickly, includin’ the sheriff. After makin’ sure the coast was clear I got up nd headed to the cave. I took one last look around nd then looked back. It was gone. Literally just disappeared in the time I had taken my eyes off it. I pressed a hand to the dune nd felt nothin’ but sand. My stomach dropped. I had hoped this wouldn't be another weird ass situation. All hope of that vanished at that moment. What the hell was goin’ on in this town?

I got back to my office nd plopped into my chair. For a while I just stared at the ceilin’, wonderin’ what the hell I should do next. My eyes slowly shifted to my safe. I got up with a sigh nd moved to it. With shakin’ hands I unlocked it, takin’ a deep breath before turnin’ the handle nd openin’ the door. The leatherbound tome sat right where I left it, unassumin’ yet ominous in my mind. I removed it from the safe nd took it back to my desk openin’ it hesitantly. The impossible tower glared at me from the page. I could practically see the emerald light emanatin’ from its peak. I quickly turned the page. The text was some form of cuneiform, but I could understand, in a way. Like a whisper in the back of my mind.

“His light shines through time and space, blessing us who are chosen.

The chosen await the seeker to breach the veil.

May He walk amongst us, showing us the truth of the abyss.”

Even bein’ able to read it didn't make it any more understandable. The next page showed another picture with script underneath it. A jewel shone on the page, I could guess what kind of light emanated from its depths.

“It connects us to the void, to Him.

It is the key, a small piece of His light.

Through shattered dreams the way will open.

The dweller of the deep holds the key’ where the black pyramid keeps vigil.”

Dweller of the deep… the name itself made me nauseous. I closed the book, feelin’ a bit ill. Memories of the swamp flooded my brain. The smell of burnin’ flesh fillin’ my nostrils. I grabbed the nearby trash bin, vomitin’ what little food I had eaten earlier in the day. My head swam as I lifted myself back up. My vision blurrin’ as the light seemed to dim. Shadows shifted around the blurred tunnel of my vision. Hands gently cupped my face as it was lifted to meet green eyes. Another pair covered my eyes from behind, leavin’ me in darkness. Suddenly, thick soft rope-like appendages wrapped around my wrists, the slick leathery flesh tightenin’ around them nd pullin’ me down to my knees. Before I could scream another wrapped around my throat nd squeezed tight.

“Shhh…” A feminine whisper reached my ears, “You're almost there James… so close..”

I awoke to the sun stingin’ my eyes. My body was prone on the floor of my office in an awkward position. I pushed myself up, feelin’ sore nd stiff. I could still feel the moist undulatin’ appendages on my wrists nd neck. I looked down at my wrists. where large bruises wrapped around them. I assumed there was one on my neck as well. My hands began to shake as I pressed them into my chest, just sittin’ there as I tried to calm myself. Eventually I got up off the floor, my gait unsteady as I went back to my desk chair nd sat down. I picked up my phone nd dialed in a number.

“Tom, I need your help.”

Tom sat in my office as I explained what I discovered. I had to give the guy credit. He listened to every word I said before callin’ me crazy.

“Jimmy, I think you're losin’ your shit.” He stated matter of factly. “A cave that disappears. The sheriff part of some cult. I don't like the guy either, but that doesn't mean he is worshippin’ Satan, nd what the hell happened to your neck?”

“It's not Satan, Tom.” I said with a sigh, ignorin’ his inquiry bout my bruises. “I don't know what it is honestly, but it's bad. Listen, you ain’t gotta believe me, I'll show you. Just wait for my call nd meet me here.” I pointed out a spot on a map of the town nd surroundin’ areas. The same spot where the cave appeared before. “Just when you get there stay hidden nd keep an eye out. You'll see, Tom, I swear to you.”

Tom eyeballed me for a good ten seconds before respondin’ with a look like he was entertainin’ a child. “Fine Jimmy, but if this turns out to be bullshit then you better go get some help.”

I nodded to him nd with one long last look he turned around nd left the office. I leaned back in my chair as I watched him go, fiddlin’ with a pen on my desk as I contemplated my next move. I'd have to wait again. I'd have to watch the sheriff nd call Tom the next time he stayed late at the office. I felt bad gettin’ Tom involved, but I barely made it out alive from the swamp, nd I had help back then too. I'd have to be more careful this time. I had to make sure we both survived whatever encounter awaited us in that cave.

Another long, borin’ week passed by. I watched the sheriff the same as before, nd just like before he followed the same routine, until he didn't. When the sheriff was two hours past his usual leavin’ time I called Tom. 

“Tonight Tom. Be there before midnight, nd be armed.” I said into the phone before hangin’ up, not waitin’ for a response.

When he left about thirty minutes before midnight I followed. I was just as careful as before, no, perhaps even more careful. I didn't even see him step into the cave because I stayed so far behind. I circled the dune of the cave just like before, headin’ to the same hidin’ spot I had used previously. As I neared it a hand grabbed my jacket nd pulled me down into the brush. It was Tom, lookin’ at me all bug-eyed.

“Jesus Tom, you nearly made me piss myself.” I said, swallowin’ down the scream that almost erupted from my throat.

“Yea, you're freaked out?” Said Tom, his voice shakin’ slightly. “How do you think I feel? What the fuck is this Jimmy?”

“I already told you, be quiet, more people are gonna show up.” I said, turnin’ my attention to the cave entrance.

As if on queue more people showed nd entered the cave. Tom nd I watched silently until I counted the same amount of people walkin’ in as before. We waited a small bit longer. I didn’t wanna be caught off guard by extras possibly showin’ up to whatever this was. I got up from the ground nd motioned for Tom to follow quietly. He was hesitant at first, but I saw him set his jaw, eyes narrowin’ in a newly determined look as he nodded nd began to follow. He drew his pistol nd I drew my own revolver in response. Then, we headed into the cave.

The cave was dark, damp nd cold. It got so dark at one point we had to keep a hand on the wall to keep our bearin’. We walked for a long time. How long I don't know. The lack of light made it hard to guess time or any kind of distance traveled. Then I smelled it. There was a scent of ozone in the area, growin’ stronger as we moved. Ahead of us a cold bluish light began to shine into the tunnel. Soon I could see an exit nd as we neared it I looked back at Tom. He looked back at me wide-eyed, sweat drippin’ down his brow. Turnin’ back I stepped onto the narrow path beyond the stiflin’ tunnel.

I stopped dead in my tracks as I saw what lay before us. Tom ran into my back before grabbin’ my shoulder nd steadyin’ himself. I swear I heard a small whimper escape from him as he did, but I didn't blame him as I looked at our surroundin’s. We were on a narrow bridge-like path, one side had a ledge about waist high nd every so often a torch jutted up from it burnin’ with a bluish white flame. There was  nothin’ holdin’ up the gray lookin’ rock we stood on. To our left was a drop that seemed to go at least a hundred feet before meetin’ black still water. I felt drops of wetness splatterin’ down on us now nd then, nd lookin’ up I was met with another lake of the same black water, only this time grey lights shifted beneath it, or above it? Some of the lights were single, others in pairs, some in strange clusters. I pulled my gaze away to look further down the bridge. There in what seemed like miles ahead of us, yet only a few hundred feet was a black pyramid, juttin’ out of the water. Dark obelisks surrounded it, the surfaces of all were smooth nd seamless as if made of single pieces of obsidian. I realized then the only color around us was the blue of the flames, nd it faded into the same greyish light that seemed to illuminate our path.

I felt Tom's hand shakin’ on my shoulder. I quickly looked back nd took his head in my hands turnin’ it to face me.

“Don’t look too hard, Tom. Don't think too hard. Focus on me. Don’t let it enter your mind ok?” I said, lookin’ into his shaky eyes to see if he understood. He swallowed hard nd seemed to focus on me just a bit better. “Listen, if you need to go back, then go back. I won't blame you. Do what you have to do, Tom.”

He seemed to look at me then, really look. Then he closed his eyes, swallowed hard nd took a deep breath. Finally he opened them nd his gaze seemed much more solid. 

He grimaced nd shook his head. “No Jimmy, I can't leave you here alone, nd.. I need to see what this is. I can't turn back now.”

I nodded nd patted his shoulders, grateful for him stickin’ at my side. I turned around nd began to walk the path to either death or madness.

The walk to the pyramid was silent nd short. Much shorter than should have been expected. As we reached the entrance, a smooth rectangular entryway that showed no signs of a builder's touch, I looked back. The exit from the tunnel wasn't even visible, as if we had walked miles from where we started. We entered the pyramid. I took one wall while Tom took the other. We both moved forward slowly. As we made our way further inside, carved murals began to show on the walls. I say carved, but once again there was no sign of tool marks, just smooth glass-like rock formin’ strange pictures. Some showed humanoid creatures that seemed to be mixed with an angler fish. Fins jutted from their arms nd long teeth from their mouths. Their eyes were bulbous on their fish-like heads. I saw the tower again depicted in another carvin’. Its shape more true than the picture in the grimoire, but not quite as blasphemous as the visions I had seen. Either way it hurt my eyes to look upon them. They seemed to shift nd move without actually doin’ so. I looked away nd saw Tom opposite me rubbin’ his eyes. I looked at him raisin’ an eyebrow to silently ask if he was doin’ ok. He looked back with reddened eyes nd nodded. His face fixed into a look of grim determination as we continued our way further into the pyramid’s depths.

As we delved deeper we began to hear somethin’. There was a chantin’ comin’ from ahead. I gripped my revolver tighter as we walked. Tryin’ to be silent as a chamber opened ahead of us. We stayed back in the entryway when we reached the room. It was round nd tall. We could see the cloaked figures standin’ in a circle. Their arms were up as they chanted in a language that reminded me of the cultists in the swamp, but it was what sat in the middle that truly put fear in my heart. Sittin’ center was a large, mummified creature. It had to be at least thirty feet tall sittin’ down. I could see the sharp teeth juttin’ from its dried gums. Dry, dead eyes sat bulbously on the sides of its withered head. Long skeletal arms came down its sides nd folded in its lap, endin’ in webbed nd clawed hands. In front of its dried husk floated an object omittin’ a familiar emerald light. It was the jewel from the book, floatin’ nd pulsin’ with the chants of the people around it. This must be the dweller in the deep.

The ceilin’ was the same black water from outside. And as we watched a figure fell from the water. It was one of the townsfolk. That same fisherman who had been braggin’ bout his impossible catch. As we stood watchin’ he writhed on the ground in front of the jewel. Then slowly his flesh began to sink in on itself. He grew thinner nd thinner until just like the creature before him, he became nothin’ but a dried husk of a man. He let out one final gasp of breath before one of the hooded figured picked him up nd carried him to a small slot in the wall. He pushed the corpse into it nd a splash was heard after a moment.

Tom stood on the opposite wall from me mouth agape as he looked into the room. I tried to silently get his attention but his eyes were fixed. Tears began drippin’ from them as he stood unblinkin’. I made my way quietly to his side nd turned him away from the nightmarish sight. He blinked stupidly at me for a moment before wipin’ his eyes nd liftin’ his pistol. Then he looked me dead in the eye. I knew then we weren't leavin’ this place without a fight. Noddin’ I lifted my revolver as well, turnin’ towards the room nd takin’ aim.

The next moments were a blur of muzzle flashes nd movin’ bodies. We fired again nd again. The people there fallin’ to the ground one by one as we shot them down. We didn’t think, didn't have to. We would end this blasphemy here nd now. I pulled my trigger over nd over till only clicks came from my gun. The empty cylinder spinnin’ with each pull of my finger. Tom stood beside me as both of us lowered our weapons. Tears streamed down his face as he looked around, his gun still smokin’ from expendin’ its magazine. My eyes were fixed however. The jewel pulled me closer to it nd soon I was standin’ before it, lookin’ into its emerald depths. I felt Tom's hand on my shoulder nd his voice registered in my ears.

“Jimmy, we have to go man.” He said lookin’ at me.

I reached out a hand to the jewel, when suddenly another movement caught my eye beyond it. The creature. I stared for a moment nd felt Tom's hand grip my shoulder even harder. One of the fingers on that horrendous clawed hand began to curl slowly inward. 

We both turned nd took flight. I don't remember gettin’ outside but suddenly we were both on the sandy ground heavin’ in breath. I looked back behind us, but the cave was gone once again. I stood up weakly lookin’ at Tom nd smilin’ the best I could.

“We did it Tom. We stopped them, nd made it out in one piece.” I said with a small chuckle of relief.

But Tom wasn't smilin’, he wasn't even lookin at me. Instead he was lookin’ down at my hand where I held my gun, his face givin’ off a sickly green glow.

“Tom, what's wrong?” I said lookin’ down at my hand.

It wasn't my gun. It was the jewel, glowin’ brightly in my grip nd coverin’ us with its strange greenish light. I felt terror grip my chest as I looked at it. When did I grab it? How did I not realize it was in my hand? Then I felt somethin’ cold nd wet hit my neck once, then again. I looked up nd saw small flakes of snow fallin’ from a dark cloudy sky. It didn't snow here.

So 2 months ago I hooked up with a guy I met randomly.46, recently divorced. Tall, attractive, intelligent We had drinks in the bar, he told me how he divorced his wife after 15 years of an unhappy marriage. How his marriage is his biggest regret and how he only married her because the love of his life got married to someone else. He said his life is a bad joke.  And I was in a good mood and I let him do anything he wanted. 

And 2 months later I got a job at a big plant. A low position job, accounting support. And he is the manager of that place. There are around 400 people there and many, many  layers between us. But he is somewhat thyranical, authoritative, mean to people, has very high expactations, raises his voice, belittles, dominante. Always in tie, always in button up shirt, always unhappy.

3 days ago we crossed paths for the very first time. At the plant's coffee shop. He recognised me, he almost spilled his coffee. But didn't say anything. Later that day he came to our offices to talk with the manager of my manager and I pretended I don't see him. 

I will not tell anyone, I will not make a drama about it. I am here to work and not cause him or myself any problems. I need this job a lot. I live in a 400k city, so not a small town but not endless opportunities. And this is a job I like. I am qualified for it. Should I try to tell him anything? Or to keep my mouth shut - I meant like to tell him I will never tell anyone anything. What worries me most is not even that we slept together but the fact that he told me what a miserable life he has and what a coward he was with the love of his life and how he feels hopeless and depressed.

Parents always tell you there's no such thing as monsters. I'm not so sure about that anymore. What if you look into the dark nd find there actually is somethin’ there? Nobody prepares you for the loss of sleep. Nobody prepares you for the utter fear of seein’ that shadow in the corner actually start movin’. You always think there' s somethin’ you can do about it. Let me tell you straight, there ain’t. Once the dark knows you're there, there ain' t nothin’ you can do to keep it from findin’ you.

I’d been out the hospital bout’ two weeks nd it ain’t been no walk in the park. Ever since the swamp, things have been.. off. Maybe that's an understatement, but it's hard to describe what's happenin’ to me. I see things now, in the shadows. I see things movin’, shapes nd figures in the dark. I leave the lights on in my apartment now, but that doesn't stop the dreams. I see that impossible tower in its monochrome landscape. I see that eerie green light flowin’ like water as if it’s alive. I see Mary.

I awoke early, nd immediately knew somethin’ was wrong. The room was dark and quiet. I stayed still,that conjures demons from the dark. Then I felt the cold hand slide over my bicep nd grip firmly. It pulled me onto my back nd I couldn't help but look next to me. Layin’ there starin’ at me with those emerald glowin’ eyes was Mary, practically naked except for the sheer green garment she was wrapped in. She was no longer the mud-covered fanatic I met in the swamp. She was clean nd ghostly pale, luminescent even. Suddenly her eyes rolled back into her head nd her mouth gaped open wide. A thick, slimy black tendril pushed its way out of her mouth as I watched in horror. I pushed myself away, fallin’ onto the floor. My body hit the ground nd with a blink the world changed. It was mornin’, nd the gulls cawed loudly outside my window. I looked at the empty bed nd sagged into myself lettin’ out the breath I didn't realize I was holdin’.

I took my time gettin’ ready, tryin’ to put back together my frayed nerves. As I finished, I looked in the direction of my safe where I had stashed that heretical book. I tried lookin’ at it before, but as soon as I saw the best possible rendition of the Emerald Tower I locked it away. I knew I'd have to look at it some time, but that time wasn’t today, nor hopefully any time soon. I quickly finished up, suddenly wantin’ to be as far from that safe as possible, when I heard a knock on my office door.

“Great..” I muttered to myself as I began headin’ down.

I unlocked the door nd opened it slightly, turnin’ around without lookin’ nd headin’ to my desk.

“Mornin’ deputy.” I said as I grabbed the whiskey bottle nd poured a bit into the cold coffee still on my desk from yesterday.

“How’d ya know it was me?” said Deputy Tom Bellham as he stepped into the door, closin’ it behind him.

“Just a feelin’ Tom.” I said, as I popped two Seltzer tabs into the coffee as well nd stared at it as it bubbled nd frothed. I've been havin’ those too, feelin’s, like my intuition has skyrocketed to new heights.

I side-eyed Tom as he stepped further into my office. I could tell he was uncomfortable. Most people around here have treated me differently since the swamp incident. Maybe it’s because of the rumours of what happened or maybe it's because of my newly green eyes. Could be both for all I know, but I've learned not to make eye contact anymore.

“So did you need somethin’ Tom, or did you just come to stand here?” I said takin’ a sip of my mornin’ concoction.

Tom shifted his feet a bit before answerin’. “I’m guessin’ you ain’t heard the news lately, Jimmy?”

“No Tom, I haven't heard any news. Been sorta keepin’ to myself lately.” I said starin’ into my coffee cup.

“Yea...” Tom said, before continuin’ hesitantly, ""We've had some strangeness in town, Jimmy. Two people are dead.”

I looked at Tom for a moment, his eyes shiftin’ away quickly from mine. “Sounds like your jurisdiction Tom, not mine.”

Tom lets out a long sigh before speakin’, “yea I know Jimmy, but I’m at a loss on this, nd you know the sheriff isn't doin’ a damn thing about it. I could use your help on this one.”

I nodded lookin’ away again nd finishin’ the rest of my coffee. “Alright Tom, tell me what’s goin’ on.” I said walkin’ round my desk nd sittin’ in my chair.

Tom sat down nd went into the details. Apparently the two people died exactly the same way. Both had drowned, but the strange thing was they were found the next day shriveled nd untouched by the water life. Also it’s reported that the second actually walked into the water themselves, nd there’s some evidence the first did the same, though there’s no witnesses. The coroner report basically said the bodies were drained of all fluids. Which is hard to believe since they apparently died in the ocean.

I leaned back in my chair as Tom finished his explanation. “I’m not really sure what I can do with that Tom, not much to go on there.”

Tom nods thoughtfully for a moment, “Yea I know Jimmy, just maybe look into it for me, see if there’s anythin’ I missed.”

“Yea alright, I can do that for you, just keep me updated.” I said.

“Alright Jimmy. Thanks.” He said gettin’ up from his chair. “I’ll see ya round.”

With that Tom walked out the door leavin’ me to ponder the situation. If I didn't know better I'd say this was all coincidence, but even in normal situations, coincidences are a rare thing.

I mulled over things for a moment. Most likely both deaths occurred sometime in the night. I doubt visitin’ the site durin’ the day would yield anythin’ new. Tom may be the only real law in town, but he was pretty thorough. What I could do was talk to the witness of the second incident, Debbie Thornwell. I looked up at the clock nd sighed. Better now than later I suppose.

I got up from my desk, grabbin’ my jacket nd headin’ to the door.

The mornin’ air was brisk as I walked down the damp streets of Portsmouth. The familiar scent of rottin’ fish hangin’ in the cold air. A light fog hung stubbornly as I passed abandoned shops, the sun not yet warm enough to send it to its grave. I pulled up my collar to try nd block the chill wind nd turned down the street to Debbie's home. I looked up at the ramshackle house before walkin’ up its creaky steps nd knockin’ on the door.

The door cracked open, the swollen wood givin’ some trouble before releasin’ the door from its confines. I could see a sliver of Debbie's face, eyes swollen on her weathered face.

“Jimmy, what do you need hun? It ain’t a good time.” She said wearily, lettin’ the door creep open a little more.

“Yea I know Debs. I’m helpin’ Tom with the situation. Just wanted to go over what you saw the other night. Also, I'm sorry for your loss.”

“Everybody’s sorry Jimmy. Doesn't change the fact my husband walked into the sea without any warnin’ or reason.” She said with a heavy sigh. “Come on in Jimmy.”

She opened the door further lettin’ me into the home. Despite outward appearances the inside was warm, cozy nd well lit. I stopped inside nd followed her into the livin’ room where she sat in a well worn lazyboy. Another sat not too far from her, also well worn. I decided to sit on the couch. I sat nd waited for her to begin. There wasn't any rush nd I wasn't gonna push her to start.

“It was bout three in the mornin’ when I felt him get out of bed. At first I thought he was just goin’ to the bathroom, but when I realized the light hadn't turned on I sat up. Bout a minute later I heard the front door open. That door doesn't open without makin’ a hell of a ruckus. So I got up grabbin’ my robe nd headed down to see what the hell he was doin’. When I came down the door was just wide open. I looked down the street nd I see the crazy old bastard walkin’ down the road in his pajamas. I called out to him but he just kept goin’, didn't even look back, like he couldn't hear me at all. So I went after him. I tell you what, Jimmy. I don't think I've seen that old man move that fast in a decade. I chased him down as best I could, but I couldn't catch up. That's when I realized we were headin’ towards the beach. As we got closer I noticed somethin’ though, a smell, like right before a big thunderstorm. Anyway, I get to the beach nd there he was, kneelin’ by the water with his arms raised like he is praisin’ the Lord. I was bout to yell out to him again nd move closer, but I swear Jimmy, there was somethin’ movin’ under that water. I may be old, but my sight is still as good as ever. Next thing I know that fool jumps into the sea. Then he was just… gone. He never came back up, Jimmy.” As she finished a couple tears spilled down her cheeks.

I didn't say anythin’ at first. This whole thing had a bad smell to it, just like the swamp case did. My heart started poundin’ as anxiety at the thought started buildin’ inside me. I closed my eyes nd took a deep long breath to steady my nerves before lookin’ back at her.

“Was he doin’ anythin’ before all this Debs? Maybe somethin’ unusual or somethin’?” I asked.

“I don't think so, Jimmy. Well, actually the day before he was askin’ the sheriff bout the other man who died. It was one of his friends from his fishin’ days. They worked on the same boat together.” She said. “You think that has somethin’ to do with this?”

I shook my head. “No, I’m sure it's nothin’ Debs” I lied. “Thanks for goin’ over this with me. I appreciate it.”

She nodded slowly as she watched me get up nd head to the door.

“Take care of yourself Debs.” I said as I stepped back out into the cold, pullin’ the door shut behind me.

The sheriff huh? Odd thing for a man to die the exact same way after askin’ about the previous victim. If the sheriff is involved I'd have to keep an eye on him. Askin’ him about it would only tip him off if he did. I made my trek back to my office as I pondered what to do next. I turned onto the street for the docks nd saw a small crowd ahead of me. I walked over to see what the commotion was about. There were bout fifteen people by a boat. All of them were talkin’ to the captain. A man by the name of Emmet PowelI. I stopped nd listened to the conversation. 

“Was over by the dead reef.” He said loudly. “I pulled up my nets nd they were completely full! Net after net we cast. Hell, my boat's almost full right now!” He said laughin’ nd puffin’ out his chest.

Strange. Every now nd then there's a somewhat decent haul from a lucky boat, but nothin’ like that. It's been bout twenty years since any boat came full into these docks. I didn't like it. I didn't like any of this. I turned away nd headed to my office. Somethin’ was wrong here, nd unfortunately it seemed I'd be the one to have to figure it out.

For the next two days I kept an eye on Sheriff Johnson. This basically consisted of sittin’ outside the sheriff office doin’ absolutely nothin’ nd bein’ bored out of my mind. Eventually he finally broke his routine. The first thing I noted which was strange, was he actually stayed late at the office. Usually from what I had seen he leaves as quickly as possible headin’ straight home. This time though, he didn't leave till close to midnight. This actually caused me a bit of trouble, since I had to follow him extra carefully, often losin’ sight of him because nobody else was walkin’ the streets to give me any cover for bein’ out there so late. Even so, this wasn't my first rodeo. I kept out of sight, followin’ him through the streets to the edge of town. 

As the sheriff made his way through the brush I kept my distance. Only movin’ forward when I lost sight of him. I realized we were headin’ pretty close to the beach where the victims were found, just further away from the actual shore. Finally he stopped, looked around nd headin’ behind a brush covered dune. I waited, watchin’ to see where he went next, but he never came around. Slowly nd quiet-like I made my way towards the dune. I kept a wide distance nd circled to where he should have been. There in the dune was an openin’. A dark cave sat there goin’ downwards into the earth. I was about to head in when I heard a noise. Someone else was comin’, so I backed off findin’ a large brush area nd ducked down into it. Another figure came into view, cloaked in some kind of robe. They went into the cave, quickly disappearin’ into the darkness. I decided to wait to see if anyone else showed up. The last thing I wanted was to go in just to have myself pincered between these people.

I sat waitin’ in that brush nd counted five more cloaked figures that went into that cave. Knowin’ I was outnumbered nd not wantin’ to get myself into an impossible situation, I stayed sittin’ in that brush. I figured I'd wait till they all left nd explore this cave afterwards. So I waited, waited for hours until they finally came out. They darted off quickly, includin’ the sheriff. After makin’ sure the coast was clear I got up nd headed to the cave. I took one last look around nd then looked back. It was gone. Literally just disappeared in the time I had taken my eyes off it. I pressed a hand to the dune nd felt nothin’ but sand. My stomach dropped. I had hoped this wouldn't be another weird ass situation. All hope of that vanished at that moment. What the hell was goin’ on in this town?

I got back to my office nd plopped into my chair. For a while I just stared at the ceilin’, wonderin’ what the hell I should do next. My eyes slowly shifted to my safe. I got up with a sigh nd moved to it. With shakin’ hands I unlocked it, takin’ a deep breath before turnin’ the handle nd openin’ the door. The leatherbound tome sat right where I left it, unassumin’ yet ominous in my mind. I removed it from the safe nd took it back to my desk openin’ it hesitantly. The impossible tower glared at me from the page. I could practically see the emerald light emanatin’ from its peak. I quickly turned the page. The text was some form of cuneiform, but I could understand, in a way. Like a whisper in the back of my mind.

“His light shines through time and space, blessing us who are chosen.

The chosen await the seeker to breach the veil.

May He walk amongst us, showing us the truth of the abyss.”

Even bein’ able to read it didn't make it any more understandable. The next page showed another picture with script underneath it. A jewel shone on the page, I could guess what kind of light emanated from its depths.

“It connects us to the void, to Him.

It is the key, a small piece of His light.

Through shattered dreams the way will open.

The dweller of the deep holds the key’ where the black pyramid keeps vigil.”

Dweller of the deep… the name itself made me nauseous. I closed the book, feelin’ a bit ill. Memories of the swamp flooded my brain. The smell of burnin’ flesh fillin’ my nostrils. I grabbed the nearby trash bin, vomitin’ what little food I had eaten earlier in the day. My head swam as I lifted myself back up. My vision blurrin’ as the light seemed to dim. Shadows shifted around the blurred tunnel of my vision. Hands gently cupped my face as it was lifted to meet green eyes. Another pair covered my eyes from behind, leavin’ me in darkness. Suddenly, thick soft rope-like appendages wrapped around my wrists, the slick leathery flesh tightenin’ around them nd pullin’ me down to my knees. Before I could scream another wrapped around my throat nd squeezed tight.

“Shhh…” A feminine whisper reached my ears, “You're almost there James… so close..”

I awoke to the sun stingin’ my eyes. My body was prone on the floor of my office in an awkward position. I pushed myself up, feelin’ sore nd stiff. I could still feel the moist undulatin’ appendages on my wrists nd neck. I looked down at my wrists. where large bruises wrapped around them. I assumed there was one on my neck as well. My hands began to shake as I pressed them into my chest, just sittin’ there as I tried to calm myself. Eventually I got up off the floor, my gait unsteady as I went back to my desk chair nd sat down. I picked up my phone nd dialed in a number.

“Tom, I need your help.”

Tom sat in my office as I explained what I discovered. I had to give the guy credit. He listened to every word I said before callin’ me crazy.

“Jimmy, I think you're losin’ your shit.” He stated matter of factly. “A cave that disappears. The sheriff part of some cult. I don't like the guy either, but that doesn't mean he is worshippin’ Satan, nd what the hell happened to your neck?”

“It's not Satan, Tom.” I said with a sigh, ignorin’ his inquiry bout my bruises. “I don't know what it is honestly, but it's bad. Listen, you ain’t gotta believe me, I'll show you. Just wait for my call nd meet me here.” I pointed out a spot on a map of the town nd surroundin’ areas. The same spot where the cave appeared before. “Just when you get there stay hidden nd keep an eye out. You'll see, Tom, I swear to you.”

Tom eyeballed me for a good ten seconds before respondin’ with a look like he was entertainin’ a child. “Fine Jimmy, but if this turns out to be bullshit then you better go get some help.”

I nodded to him nd with one long last look he turned around nd left the office. I leaned back in my chair as I watched him go, fiddlin’ with a pen on my desk as I contemplated my next move. I'd have to wait again. I'd have to watch the sheriff nd call Tom the next time he stayed late at the office. I felt bad gettin’ Tom involved, but I barely made it out alive from the swamp, nd I had help back then too. I'd have to be more careful this time. I had to make sure we both survived whatever encounter awaited us in that cave.

Another long, borin’ week passed by. I watched the sheriff the same as before, nd just like before he followed the same routine, until he didn't. When the sheriff was two hours past his usual leavin’ time I called Tom. 

“Tonight Tom. Be there before midnight, nd be armed.” I said into the phone before hangin’ up, not waitin’ for a response.

When he left about thirty minutes before midnight I followed. I was just as careful as before, no, perhaps even more careful. I didn't even see him step into the cave because I stayed so far behind. I circled the dune of the cave just like before, headin’ to the same hidin’ spot I had used previously. As I neared it a hand grabbed my jacket nd pulled me down into the brush. It was Tom, lookin’ at me all bug-eyed.

“Jesus Tom, you nearly made me piss myself.” I said, swallowin’ down the scream that almost erupted from my throat.

“Yea, you're freaked out?” Said Tom, his voice shakin’ slightly. “How do you think I feel? What the fuck is this Jimmy?”

“I already told you, be quiet, more people are gonna show up.” I said, turnin’ my attention to the cave entrance.

As if on queue more people showed nd entered the cave. Tom nd I watched silently until I counted the same amount of people walkin’ in as before. We waited a small bit longer. I didn’t wanna be caught off guard by extras possibly showin’ up to whatever this was. I got up from the ground nd motioned for Tom to follow quietly. He was hesitant at first, but I saw him set his jaw, eyes narrowin’ in a newly determined look as he nodded nd began to follow. He drew his pistol nd I drew my own revolver in response. Then, we headed into the cave.

The cave was dark, damp nd cold. It got so dark at one point we had to keep a hand on the wall to keep our bearin’. We walked for a long time. How long I don't know. The lack of light made it hard to guess time or any kind of distance traveled. Then I smelled it. There was a scent of ozone in the area, growin’ stronger as we moved. Ahead of us a cold bluish light began to shine into the tunnel. Soon I could see an exit nd as we neared it I looked back at Tom. He looked back at me wide-eyed, sweat drippin’ down his brow. Turnin’ back I stepped onto the narrow path beyond the stiflin’ tunnel.

I stopped dead in my tracks as I saw what lay before us. Tom ran into my back before grabbin’ my shoulder nd steadyin’ himself. I swear I heard a small whimper escape from him as he did, but I didn't blame him as I looked at our surroundin’s. We were on a narrow bridge-like path, one side had a ledge about waist high nd every so often a torch jutted up from it burnin’ with a bluish white flame. There was  nothin’ holdin’ up the gray lookin’ rock we stood on. To our left was a drop that seemed to go at least a hundred feet before meetin’ black still water. I felt drops of wetness splatterin’ down on us now nd then, nd lookin’ up I was met with another lake of the same black water, only this time grey lights shifted beneath it, or above it? Some of the lights were single, others in pairs, some in strange clusters. I pulled my gaze away to look further down the bridge. There in what seemed like miles ahead of us, yet only a few hundred feet was a black pyramid, juttin’ out of the water. Dark obelisks surrounded it, the surfaces of all were smooth nd seamless as if made of single pieces of obsidian. I realized then the only color around us was the blue of the flames, nd it faded into the same greyish light that seemed to illuminate our path.

I felt Tom's hand shakin’ on my shoulder. I quickly looked back nd took his head in my hands turnin’ it to face me.

“Don’t look too hard, Tom. Don't think too hard. Focus on me. Don’t let it enter your mind ok?” I said, lookin’ into his shaky eyes to see if he understood. He swallowed hard nd seemed to focus on me just a bit better. “Listen, if you need to go back, then go back. I won't blame you. Do what you have to do, Tom.”

He seemed to look at me then, really look. Then he closed his eyes, swallowed hard nd took a deep breath. Finally he opened them nd his gaze seemed much more solid. 

He grimaced nd shook his head. “No Jimmy, I can't leave you here alone, nd.. I need to see what this is. I can't turn back now.”

I nodded nd patted his shoulders, grateful for him stickin’ at my side. I turned around nd began to walk the path to either death or madness.

The walk to the pyramid was silent nd short. Much shorter than should have been expected. As we reached the entrance, a smooth rectangular entryway that showed no signs of a builder's touch, I looked back. The exit from the tunnel wasn't even visible, as if we had walked miles from where we started. We entered the pyramid. I took one wall while Tom took the other. We both moved forward slowly. As we made our way further inside, carved murals began to show on the walls. I say carved, but once again there was no sign of tool marks, just smooth glass-like rock formin’ strange pictures. Some showed humanoid creatures that seemed to be mixed with an angler fish. Fins jutted from their arms nd long teeth from their mouths. Their eyes were bulbous on their fish-like heads. I saw the tower again depicted in another carvin’. Its shape more true than the picture in the grimoire, but not quite as blasphemous as the visions I had seen. Either way it hurt my eyes to look upon them. They seemed to shift nd move without actually doin’ so. I looked away nd saw Tom opposite me rubbin’ his eyes. I looked at him raisin’ an eyebrow to silently ask if he was doin’ ok. He looked back with reddened eyes nd nodded. His face fixed into a look of grim determination as we continued our way further into the pyramid’s depths.

As we delved deeper we began to hear somethin’. There was a chantin’ comin’ from ahead. I gripped my revolver tighter as we walked. Tryin’ to be silent as a chamber opened ahead of us. We stayed back in the entryway when we reached the room. It was round nd tall. We could see the cloaked figures standin’ in a circle. Their arms were up as they chanted in a language that reminded me of the cultists in the swamp, but it was what sat in the middle that truly put fear in my heart. Sittin’ center was a large, mummified creature. It had to be at least thirty feet tall sittin’ down. I could see the sharp teeth juttin’ from its dried gums. Dry, dead eyes sat bulbously on the sides of its withered head. Long skeletal arms came down its sides nd folded in its lap, endin’ in webbed nd clawed hands. In front of its dried husk floated an object omittin’ a familiar emerald light. It was the jewel from the book, floatin’ nd pulsin’ with the chants of the people around it. This must be the dweller in the deep.

The ceilin’ was the same black water from outside. And as we watched a figure fell from the water. It was one of the townsfolk. That same fisherman who had been braggin’ bout his impossible catch. As we stood watchin’ he writhed on the ground in front of the jewel. Then slowly his flesh began to sink in on itself. He grew thinner nd thinner until just like the creature before him, he became nothin’ but a dried husk of a man. He let out one final gasp of breath before one of the hooded figured picked him up nd carried him to a small slot in the wall. He pushed the corpse into it nd a splash was heard after a moment.

Tom stood on the opposite wall from me mouth agape as he looked into the room. I tried to silently get his attention but his eyes were fixed. Tears began drippin’ from them as he stood unblinkin’. I made my way quietly to his side nd turned him away from the nightmarish sight. He blinked stupidly at me for a moment before wipin’ his eyes nd liftin’ his pistol. Then he looked me dead in the eye. I knew then we weren't leavin’ this place without a fight. Noddin’ I lifted my revolver as well, turnin’ towards the room nd takin’ aim.

The next moments were a blur of muzzle flashes nd movin’ bodies. We fired again nd again. The people there fallin’ to the ground one by one as we shot them down. We didn’t think, didn't have to. We would end this blasphemy here nd now. I pulled my trigger over nd over till only clicks came from my gun. The empty cylinder spinnin’ with each pull of my finger. Tom stood beside me as both of us lowered our weapons. Tears streamed down his face as he looked around, his gun still smokin’ from expendin’ its magazine. My eyes were fixed however. The jewel pulled me closer to it nd soon I was standin’ before it, lookin’ into its emerald depths. I felt Tom's hand on my shoulder nd his voice registered in my ears.

“Jimmy, we have to go man.” He said lookin’ at me.

I reached out a hand to the jewel, when suddenly another movement caught my eye beyond it. The creature. I stared for a moment nd felt Tom's hand grip my shoulder even harder. One of the fingers on that horrendous clawed hand began to curl slowly inward. 

We both turned nd took flight. I don't remember gettin’ outside but suddenly we were both on the sandy ground heavin’ in breath. I looked back behind us, but the cave was gone once again. I stood up weakly lookin’ at Tom nd smilin’ the best I could.

“We did it Tom. We stopped them, nd made it out in one piece.” I said with a small chuckle of relief.

But Tom wasn't smilin’, he wasn't even lookin at me. Instead he was lookin’ down at my hand where I held my gun, his face givin’ off a sickly green glow.

“Tom, what's wrong?” I said lookin’ down at my hand.

It wasn't my gun. It was the jewel, glowin’ brightly in my grip nd coverin’ us with its strange greenish light. I felt terror grip my chest as I looked at it. When did I grab it? How did I not realize it was in my hand? Then I felt somethin’ cold nd wet hit my neck once, then again. I looked up nd saw small flakes of snow fallin’ from a dark cloudy sky. It didn't snow here.

I know both are excellent bandsaws, but there are some differences like resaw capacity, physical brakes, bearing guides, and I dont know how it will affect the building process/experience. I have never owned a bandsaw before, so I'd love hear form the experts.

Also, do these go on sale during thanksgiving/holiday season? I dont mind waiting for a month to save a few bucks.

Edit: should I get the 110v or 220v. I don’t mind adding a 220v outlet in my garage.

I'm ordering food and drinks for an all day retreat for our directors and department heads, and am struggling to figure out how to have coffee all day. We have a keurig ect in our office but we are doing this on a different floor. 

  
I figured I would order travelers and stuff for the morning with breakfast, but any advice on having it throughout the day? Should I order more to come in the afternoon or just let people nip down to our floor to use the keurig. If anyone's encountered a solution to this problem HELP!

Parents always tell you there's no such thing as monsters. I'm not so sure about that anymore. What if you look into the dark nd find there actually is somethin’ there? Nobody prepares you for the loss of sleep. Nobody prepares you for the utter fear of seein’ that shadow in the corner actually start movin’. You always think there' s somethin’ you can do about it. Let me tell you straight, there ain’t. Once the dark knows you're there, there ain' t nothin’ you can do to keep it from findin’ you.

I’d been out the hospital bout’ two weeks nd it ain’t been no walk in the park. Ever since the swamp, things have been.. off. Maybe that's an understatement, but it's hard to describe what's happenin’ to me. I see things now, in the shadows. I see things movin’, shapes nd figures in the dark. I leave the lights on in my apartment now, but that doesn't stop the dreams. I see that impossible tower in its monochrome landscape. I see that eerie green light flowin’ like water as if it’s alive. I see Mary.

I awoke early, nd immediately knew somethin’ was wrong. The room was dark and quiet. I stayed still,that conjures demons from the dark. Then I felt the cold hand slide over my bicep nd grip firmly. It pulled me onto my back nd I couldn't help but look next to me. Layin’ there starin’ at me with those emerald glowin’ eyes was Mary, practically naked except for the sheer green garment she was wrapped in. She was no longer the mud-covered fanatic I met in the swamp. She was clean nd ghostly pale, luminescent even. Suddenly her eyes rolled back into her head nd her mouth gaped open wide. A thick, slimy black tendril pushed its way out of her mouth as I watched in horror. I pushed myself away, fallin’ onto the floor. My body hit the ground nd with a blink the world changed. It was mornin’, nd the gulls cawed loudly outside my window. I looked at the empty bed nd sagged into myself lettin’ out the breath I didn't realize I was holdin’.

I took my time gettin’ ready, tryin’ to put back together my frayed nerves. As I finished, I looked in the direction of my safe where I had stashed that heretical book. I tried lookin’ at it before, but as soon as I saw the best possible rendition of the Emerald Tower I locked it away. I knew I'd have to look at it some time, but that time wasn’t today, nor hopefully any time soon. I quickly finished up, suddenly wantin’ to be as far from that safe as possible, when I heard a knock on my office door.

“Great..” I muttered to myself as I began headin’ down.

I unlocked the door nd opened it slightly, turnin’ around without lookin’ nd headin’ to my desk.

“Mornin’ deputy.” I said as I grabbed the whiskey bottle nd poured a bit into the cold coffee still on my desk from yesterday.

“How’d ya know it was me?” said Deputy Tom Bellham as he stepped into the door, closin’ it behind him.

“Just a feelin’ Tom.” I said, as I popped two Seltzer tabs into the coffee as well nd stared at it as it bubbled nd frothed. I've been havin’ those too, feelin’s, like my intuition has skyrocketed to new heights.

I side-eyed Tom as he stepped further into my office. I could tell he was uncomfortable. Most people around here have treated me differently since the swamp incident. Maybe it’s because of the rumours of what happened or maybe it's because of my newly green eyes. Could be both for all I know, but I've learned not to make eye contact anymore.

“So did you need somethin’ Tom, or did you just come to stand here?” I said takin’ a sip of my mornin’ concoction.

Tom shifted his feet a bit before answerin’. “I’m guessin’ you ain’t heard the news lately, Jimmy?”

“No Tom, I haven't heard any news. Been sorta keepin’ to myself lately.” I said starin’ into my coffee cup.

“Yea...” Tom said, before continuin’ hesitantly, ""We've had some strangeness in town, Jimmy. Two people are dead.”

I looked at Tom for a moment, his eyes shiftin’ away quickly from mine. “Sounds like your jurisdiction Tom, not mine.”

Tom lets out a long sigh before speakin’, “yea I know Jimmy, but I’m at a loss on this, nd you know the sheriff isn't doin’ a damn thing about it. I could use your help on this one.”

I nodded lookin’ away again nd finishin’ the rest of my coffee. “Alright Tom, tell me what’s goin’ on.” I said walkin’ round my desk nd sittin’ in my chair.

Tom sat down nd went into the details. Apparently the two people died exactly the same way. Both had drowned, but the strange thing was they were found the next day shriveled nd untouched by the water life. Also it’s reported that the second actually walked into the water themselves, nd there’s some evidence the first did the same, though there’s no witnesses. The coroner report basically said the bodies were drained of all fluids. Which is hard to believe since they apparently died in the ocean.

I leaned back in my chair as Tom finished his explanation. “I’m not really sure what I can do with that Tom, not much to go on there.”

Tom nods thoughtfully for a moment, “Yea I know Jimmy, just maybe look into it for me, see if there’s anythin’ I missed.”

“Yea alright, I can do that for you, just keep me updated.” I said.

“Alright Jimmy. Thanks.” He said gettin’ up from his chair. “I’ll see ya round.”

With that Tom walked out the door leavin’ me to ponder the situation. If I didn't know better I'd say this was all coincidence, but even in normal situations, coincidences are a rare thing.

I mulled over things for a moment. Most likely both deaths occurred sometime in the night. I doubt visitin’ the site durin’ the day would yield anythin’ new. Tom may be the only real law in town, but he was pretty thorough. What I could do was talk to the witness of the second incident, Debbie Thornwell. I looked up at the clock nd sighed. Better now than later I suppose.

I got up from my desk, grabbin’ my jacket nd headin’ to the door.

The mornin’ air was brisk as I walked down the damp streets of Portsmouth. The familiar scent of rottin’ fish hangin’ in the cold air. A light fog hung stubbornly as I passed abandoned shops, the sun not yet warm enough to send it to its grave. I pulled up my collar to try nd block the chill wind nd turned down the street to Debbie's home. I looked up at the ramshackle house before walkin’ up its creaky steps nd knockin’ on the door.

The door cracked open, the swollen wood givin’ some trouble before releasin’ the door from its confines. I could see a sliver of Debbie's face, eyes swollen on her weathered face.

“Jimmy, what do you need hun? It ain’t a good time.” She said wearily, lettin’ the door creep open a little more.

“Yea I know Debs. I’m helpin’ Tom with the situation. Just wanted to go over what you saw the other night. Also, I'm sorry for your loss.”

“Everybody’s sorry Jimmy. Doesn't change the fact my husband walked into the sea without any warnin’ or reason.” She said with a heavy sigh. “Come on in Jimmy.”

She opened the door further lettin’ me into the home. Despite outward appearances the inside was warm, cozy nd well lit. I stopped inside nd followed her into the livin’ room where she sat in a well worn lazyboy. Another sat not too far from her, also well worn. I decided to sit on the couch. I sat nd waited for her to begin. There wasn't any rush nd I wasn't gonna push her to start.

“It was bout three in the mornin’ when I felt him get out of bed. At first I thought he was just goin’ to the bathroom, but when I realized the light hadn't turned on I sat up. Bout a minute later I heard the front door open. That door doesn't open without makin’ a hell of a ruckus. So I got up grabbin’ my robe nd headed down to see what the hell he was doin’. When I came down the door was just wide open. I looked down the street nd I see the crazy old bastard walkin’ down the road in his pajamas. I called out to him but he just kept goin’, didn't even look back, like he couldn't hear me at all. So I went after him. I tell you what, Jimmy. I don't think I've seen that old man move that fast in a decade. I chased him down as best I could, but I couldn't catch up. That's when I realized we were headin’ towards the beach. As we got closer I noticed somethin’ though, a smell, like right before a big thunderstorm. Anyway, I get to the beach nd there he was, kneelin’ by the water with his arms raised like he is praisin’ the Lord. I was bout to yell out to him again nd move closer, but I swear Jimmy, there was somethin’ movin’ under that water. I may be old, but my sight is still as good as ever. Next thing I know that fool jumps into the sea. Then he was just… gone. He never came back up, Jimmy.” As she finished a couple tears spilled down her cheeks.

I didn't say anythin’ at first. This whole thing had a bad smell to it, just like the swamp case did. My heart started poundin’ as anxiety at the thought started buildin’ inside me. I closed my eyes nd took a deep long breath to steady my nerves before lookin’ back at her.

“Was he doin’ anythin’ before all this Debs? Maybe somethin’ unusual or somethin’?” I asked.

“I don't think so, Jimmy. Well, actually the day before he was askin’ the sheriff bout the other man who died. It was one of his friends from his fishin’ days. They worked on the same boat together.” She said. “You think that has somethin’ to do with this?”

I shook my head. “No, I’m sure it's nothin’ Debs” I lied. “Thanks for goin’ over this with me. I appreciate it.”

She nodded slowly as she watched me get up nd head to the door.

“Take care of yourself Debs.” I said as I stepped back out into the cold, pullin’ the door shut behind me.

The sheriff huh? Odd thing for a man to die the exact same way after askin’ about the previous victim. If the sheriff is involved I'd have to keep an eye on him. Askin’ him about it would only tip him off if he did. I made my trek back to my office as I pondered what to do next. I turned onto the street for the docks nd saw a small crowd ahead of me. I walked over to see what the commotion was about. There were bout fifteen people by a boat. All of them were talkin’ to the captain. A man by the name of Emmet PowelI. I stopped nd listened to the conversation. 

“Was over by the dead reef.” He said loudly. “I pulled up my nets nd they were completely full! Net after net we cast. Hell, my boat's almost full right now!” He said laughin’ nd puffin’ out his chest.

Strange. Every now nd then there's a somewhat decent haul from a lucky boat, but nothin’ like that. It's been bout twenty years since any boat came full into these docks. I didn't like it. I didn't like any of this. I turned away nd headed to my office. Somethin’ was wrong here, nd unfortunately it seemed I'd be the one to have to figure it out.

For the next two days I kept an eye on Sheriff Johnson. This basically consisted of sittin’ outside the sheriff office doin’ absolutely nothin’ nd bein’ bored out of my mind. Eventually he finally broke his routine. The first thing I noted which was strange, was he actually stayed late at the office. Usually from what I had seen he leaves as quickly as possible headin’ straight home. This time though, he didn't leave till close to midnight. This actually caused me a bit of trouble, since I had to follow him extra carefully, often losin’ sight of him because nobody else was walkin’ the streets to give me any cover for bein’ out there so late. Even so, this wasn't my first rodeo. I kept out of sight, followin’ him through the streets to the edge of town. 

As the sheriff made his way through the brush I kept my distance. Only movin’ forward when I lost sight of him. I realized we were headin’ pretty close to the beach where the victims were found, just further away from the actual shore. Finally he stopped, looked around nd headin’ behind a brush covered dune. I waited, watchin’ to see where he went next, but he never came around. Slowly nd quiet-like I made my way towards the dune. I kept a wide distance nd circled to where he should have been. There in the dune was an openin’. A dark cave sat there goin’ downwards into the earth. I was about to head in when I heard a noise. Someone else was comin’, so I backed off findin’ a large brush area nd ducked down into it. Another figure came into view, cloaked in some kind of robe. They went into the cave, quickly disappearin’ into the darkness. I decided to wait to see if anyone else showed up. The last thing I wanted was to go in just to have myself pincered between these people.

I sat waitin’ in that brush nd counted five more cloaked figures that went into that cave. Knowin’ I was outnumbered nd not wantin’ to get myself into an impossible situation, I stayed sittin’ in that brush. I figured I'd wait till they all left nd explore this cave afterwards. So I waited, waited for hours until they finally came out. They darted off quickly, includin’ the sheriff. After makin’ sure the coast was clear I got up nd headed to the cave. I took one last look around nd then looked back. It was gone. Literally just disappeared in the time I had taken my eyes off it. I pressed a hand to the dune nd felt nothin’ but sand. My stomach dropped. I had hoped this wouldn't be another weird ass situation. All hope of that vanished at that moment. What the hell was goin’ on in this town?

I got back to my office nd plopped into my chair. For a while I just stared at the ceilin’, wonderin’ what the hell I should do next. My eyes slowly shifted to my safe. I got up with a sigh nd moved to it. With shakin’ hands I unlocked it, takin’ a deep breath before turnin’ the handle nd openin’ the door. The leatherbound tome sat right where I left it, unassumin’ yet ominous in my mind. I removed it from the safe nd took it back to my desk openin’ it hesitantly. The impossible tower glared at me from the page. I could practically see the emerald light emanatin’ from its peak. I quickly turned the page. The text was some form of cuneiform, but I could understand, in a way. Like a whisper in the back of my mind.

“His light shines through time and space, blessing us who are chosen.

The chosen await the seeker to breach the veil.

May He walk amongst us, showing us the truth of the abyss.”

Even bein’ able to read it didn't make it any more understandable. The next page showed another picture with script underneath it. A jewel shone on the page, I could guess what kind of light emanated from its depths.

“It connects us to the void, to Him.

It is the key, a small piece of His light.

Through shattered dreams the way will open.

The dweller of the deep holds the key’ where the black pyramid keeps vigil.”

Dweller of the deep… the name itself made me nauseous. I closed the book, feelin’ a bit ill. Memories of the swamp flooded my brain. The smell of burnin’ flesh fillin’ my nostrils. I grabbed the nearby trash bin, vomitin’ what little food I had eaten earlier in the day. My head swam as I lifted myself back up. My vision blurrin’ as the light seemed to dim. Shadows shifted around the blurred tunnel of my vision. Hands gently cupped my face as it was lifted to meet green eyes. Another pair covered my eyes from behind, leavin’ me in darkness. Suddenly, thick soft rope-like appendages wrapped around my wrists, the slick leathery flesh tightenin’ around them nd pullin’ me down to my knees. Before I could scream another wrapped around my throat nd squeezed tight.

“Shhh…” A feminine whisper reached my ears, “You're almost there James… so close..”

I awoke to the sun stingin’ my eyes. My body was prone on the floor of my office in an awkward position. I pushed myself up, feelin’ sore nd stiff. I could still feel the moist undulatin’ appendages on my wrists nd neck. I looked down at my wrists. where large bruises wrapped around them. I assumed there was one on my neck as well. My hands began to shake as I pressed them into my chest, just sittin’ there as I tried to calm myself. Eventually I got up off the floor, my gait unsteady as I went back to my desk chair nd sat down. I picked up my phone nd dialed in a number.

“Tom, I need your help.”

Tom sat in my office as I explained what I discovered. I had to give the guy credit. He listened to every word I said before callin’ me crazy.

“Jimmy, I think you're losin’ your shit.” He stated matter of factly. “A cave that disappears. The sheriff part of some cult. I don't like the guy either, but that doesn't mean he is worshippin’ Satan, nd what the hell happened to your neck?”

“It's not Satan, Tom.” I said with a sigh, ignorin’ his inquiry bout my bruises. “I don't know what it is honestly, but it's bad. Listen, you ain’t gotta believe me, I'll show you. Just wait for my call nd meet me here.” I pointed out a spot on a map of the town nd surroundin’ areas. The same spot where the cave appeared before. “Just when you get there stay hidden nd keep an eye out. You'll see, Tom, I swear to you.”

Tom eyeballed me for a good ten seconds before respondin’ with a look like he was entertainin’ a child. “Fine Jimmy, but if this turns out to be bullshit then you better go get some help.”

I nodded to him nd with one long last look he turned around nd left the office. I leaned back in my chair as I watched him go, fiddlin’ with a pen on my desk as I contemplated my next move. I'd have to wait again. I'd have to watch the sheriff nd call Tom the next time he stayed late at the office. I felt bad gettin’ Tom involved, but I barely made it out alive from the swamp, nd I had help back then too. I'd have to be more careful this time. I had to make sure we both survived whatever encounter awaited us in that cave.

Another long, borin’ week passed by. I watched the sheriff the same as before, nd just like before he followed the same routine, until he didn't. When the sheriff was two hours past his usual leavin’ time I called Tom. 

“Tonight Tom. Be there before midnight, nd be armed.” I said into the phone before hangin’ up, not waitin’ for a response.

When he left about thirty minutes before midnight I followed. I was just as careful as before, no, perhaps even more careful. I didn't even see him step into the cave because I stayed so far behind. I circled the dune of the cave just like before, headin’ to the same hidin’ spot I had used previously. As I neared it a hand grabbed my jacket nd pulled me down into the brush. It was Tom, lookin’ at me all bug-eyed.

“Jesus Tom, you nearly made me piss myself.” I said, swallowin’ down the scream that almost erupted from my throat.

“Yea, you're freaked out?” Said Tom, his voice shakin’ slightly. “How do you think I feel? What the fuck is this Jimmy?”

“I already told you, be quiet, more people are gonna show up.” I said, turnin’ my attention to the cave entrance.

As if on queue more people showed nd entered the cave. Tom nd I watched silently until I counted the same amount of people walkin’ in as before. We waited a small bit longer. I didn’t wanna be caught off guard by extras possibly showin’ up to whatever this was. I got up from the ground nd motioned for Tom to follow quietly. He was hesitant at first, but I saw him set his jaw, eyes narrowin’ in a newly determined look as he nodded nd began to follow. He drew his pistol nd I drew my own revolver in response. Then, we headed into the cave.

The cave was dark, damp nd cold. It got so dark at one point we had to keep a hand on the wall to keep our bearin’. We walked for a long time. How long I don't know. The lack of light made it hard to guess time or any kind of distance traveled. Then I smelled it. There was a scent of ozone in the area, growin’ stronger as we moved. Ahead of us a cold bluish light began to shine into the tunnel. Soon I could see an exit nd as we neared it I looked back at Tom. He looked back at me wide-eyed, sweat drippin’ down his brow. Turnin’ back I stepped onto the narrow path beyond the stiflin’ tunnel.

I stopped dead in my tracks as I saw what lay before us. Tom ran into my back before grabbin’ my shoulder nd steadyin’ himself. I swear I heard a small whimper escape from him as he did, but I didn't blame him as I looked at our surroundin’s. We were on a narrow bridge-like path, one side had a ledge about waist high nd every so often a torch jutted up from it burnin’ with a bluish white flame. There was  nothin’ holdin’ up the gray lookin’ rock we stood on. To our left was a drop that seemed to go at least a hundred feet before meetin’ black still water. I felt drops of wetness splatterin’ down on us now nd then, nd lookin’ up I was met with another lake of the same black water, only this time grey lights shifted beneath it, or above it? Some of the lights were single, others in pairs, some in strange clusters. I pulled my gaze away to look further down the bridge. There in what seemed like miles ahead of us, yet only a few hundred feet was a black pyramid, juttin’ out of the water. Dark obelisks surrounded it, the surfaces of all were smooth nd seamless as if made of single pieces of obsidian. I realized then the only color around us was the blue of the flames, nd it faded into the same greyish light that seemed to illuminate our path.

I felt Tom's hand shakin’ on my shoulder. I quickly looked back nd took his head in my hands turnin’ it to face me.

“Don’t look too hard, Tom. Don't think too hard. Focus on me. Don’t let it enter your mind ok?” I said, lookin’ into his shaky eyes to see if he understood. He swallowed hard nd seemed to focus on me just a bit better. “Listen, if you need to go back, then go back. I won't blame you. Do what you have to do, Tom.”

He seemed to look at me then, really look. Then he closed his eyes, swallowed hard nd took a deep breath. Finally he opened them nd his gaze seemed much more solid. 

He grimaced nd shook his head. “No Jimmy, I can't leave you here alone, nd.. I need to see what this is. I can't turn back now.”

I nodded nd patted his shoulders, grateful for him stickin’ at my side. I turned around nd began to walk the path to either death or madness.

The walk to the pyramid was silent nd short. Much shorter than should have been expected. As we reached the entrance, a smooth rectangular entryway that showed no signs of a builder's touch, I looked back. The exit from the tunnel wasn't even visible, as if we had walked miles from where we started. We entered the pyramid. I took one wall while Tom took the other. We both moved forward slowly. As we made our way further inside, carved murals began to show on the walls. I say carved, but once again there was no sign of tool marks, just smooth glass-like rock formin’ strange pictures. Some showed humanoid creatures that seemed to be mixed with an angler fish. Fins jutted from their arms nd long teeth from their mouths. Their eyes were bulbous on their fish-like heads. I saw the tower again depicted in another carvin’. Its shape more true than the picture in the grimoire, but not quite as blasphemous as the visions I had seen. Either way it hurt my eyes to look upon them. They seemed to shift nd move without actually doin’ so. I looked away nd saw Tom opposite me rubbin’ his eyes. I looked at him raisin’ an eyebrow to silently ask if he was doin’ ok. He looked back with reddened eyes nd nodded. His face fixed into a look of grim determination as we continued our way further into the pyramid’s depths.

As we delved deeper we began to hear somethin’. There was a chantin’ comin’ from ahead. I gripped my revolver tighter as we walked. Tryin’ to be silent as a chamber opened ahead of us. We stayed back in the entryway when we reached the room. It was round nd tall. We could see the cloaked figures standin’ in a circle. Their arms were up as they chanted in a language that reminded me of the cultists in the swamp, but it was what sat in the middle that truly put fear in my heart. Sittin’ center was a large, mummified creature. It had to be at least thirty feet tall sittin’ down. I could see the sharp teeth juttin’ from its dried gums. Dry, dead eyes sat bulbously on the sides of its withered head. Long skeletal arms came down its sides nd folded in its lap, endin’ in webbed nd clawed hands. In front of its dried husk floated an object omittin’ a familiar emerald light. It was the jewel from the book, floatin’ nd pulsin’ with the chants of the people around it. This must be the dweller in the deep.

The ceilin’ was the same black water from outside. And as we watched a figure fell from the water. It was one of the townsfolk. That same fisherman who had been braggin’ bout his impossible catch. As we stood watchin’ he writhed on the ground in front of the jewel. Then slowly his flesh began to sink in on itself. He grew thinner nd thinner until just like the creature before him, he became nothin’ but a dried husk of a man. He let out one final gasp of breath before one of the hooded figured picked him up nd carried him to a small slot in the wall. He pushed the corpse into it nd a splash was heard after a moment.

Tom stood on the opposite wall from me mouth agape as he looked into the room. I tried to silently get his attention but his eyes were fixed. Tears began drippin’ from them as he stood unblinkin’. I made my way quietly to his side nd turned him away from the nightmarish sight. He blinked stupidly at me for a moment before wipin’ his eyes nd liftin’ his pistol. Then he looked me dead in the eye. I knew then we weren't leavin’ this place without a fight. Noddin’ I lifted my revolver as well, turnin’ towards the room nd takin’ aim.

The next moments were a blur of muzzle flashes nd movin’ bodies. We fired again nd again. The people there fallin’ to the ground one by one as we shot them down. We didn’t think, didn't have to. We would end this blasphemy here nd now. I pulled my trigger over nd over till only clicks came from my gun. The empty cylinder spinnin’ with each pull of my finger. Tom stood beside me as both of us lowered our weapons. Tears streamed down his face as he looked around, his gun still smokin’ from expendin’ its magazine. My eyes were fixed however. The jewel pulled me closer to it nd soon I was standin’ before it, lookin’ into its emerald depths. I felt Tom's hand on my shoulder nd his voice registered in my ears.

“Jimmy, we have to go man.” He said lookin’ at me.

I reached out a hand to the jewel, when suddenly another movement caught my eye beyond it. The creature. I stared for a moment nd felt Tom's hand grip my shoulder even harder. One of the fingers on that horrendous clawed hand began to curl slowly inward. 

We both turned nd took flight. I don't remember gettin’ outside but suddenly we were both on the sandy ground heavin’ in breath. I looked back behind us, but the cave was gone once again. I stood up weakly lookin’ at Tom nd smilin’ the best I could.

“We did it Tom. We stopped them, nd made it out in one piece.” I said with a small chuckle of relief.

But Tom wasn't smilin’, he wasn't even lookin at me. Instead he was lookin’ down at my hand where I held my gun, his face givin’ off a sickly green glow.

“Tom, what's wrong?” I said lookin’ down at my hand.

It wasn't my gun. It was the jewel, glowin’ brightly in my grip nd coverin’ us with its strange greenish light. I felt terror grip my chest as I looked at it. When did I grab it? How did I not realize it was in my hand? Then I felt somethin’ cold nd wet hit my neck once, then again. I looked up nd saw small flakes of snow fallin’ from a dark cloudy sky. It didn't snow here.

I’m a solo puppy mom to a 7-month-old border collie - so yeah, full-on energy 24/7. Yesterday I had a business meeting, and this morning I went for a surf, grabbed a coffee with friends, came home to a clean, quiet house, and got straight into work — and honestly? I feel… free.

I even properly cleaned the house yesterday for the first time in about five months, and it’s still spotless. I thought I’d miss him like crazy, but instead I just feel like myself again. The last couple of times he was in daycare or boarding, it was because I was swamped with work or traveling, so I never really had the chance to just enjoy the break.

I do miss him in the afternoons — that’s normally our time when we play or go for a walk — but wow, the mornings and daytime feel so much easier without him around.

Now I’m wondering - is this normal? Or is this the universe telling me I’m not cut out to be a dog parent? 😅 Don’t get me wrong, I adore my little chaos machine, but this mini break has made me realize how much he’s been running my life lately.

the ones that actually work are recommended to you, I’ve literally just done the 5-10 minute ones while I watch tv and I’ve been pretty pleasantly surprised tbh. 

Here’s my code if you want to get $0.50 - https://attapoll.app/join/bmqtg 

also, the minimum withdrawal is only $2.50 so you can pretty much cash out whenever if you did a couple surveys a day! That’s ur coffee (or drink of choice) for the week! In my opinion, it’s definitely worth it :) ",0,1761251525.0,OnlineIncomeHustle,8,0.33,False

In the game, you had a house and could buy and take care of cats. You had to clean up after them (for example when they spilled coffee or broke an aquarium). There was also a yard where you could let the cats out, but they wouldn’t go outside when it was raining and you had to close the door.

There was also a mouse you could bait with cheese, and then the cats would try to catch it. I also remember something about cat races. I think the game’s name was something like The Cats or something similar.

I got the game from a friend via Bluetooth on an old phone, so I can’t check any purchase history or old screenshots. I’ve searched everywhere but can’t find it anymore. Does anyone remember this game or know its full name?

(Part 02),"[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1nqzahd/im_a_pi_for_a_local_port_town_a_girl_has_gone/)

Parents always tell you there's no such thing as monsters. I'm not so sure about that anymore. What if you look into the dark nd find there actually is somethin’ there? Nobody prepares you for the loss of sleep. Nobody prepares you for the utter fear of seein’ that shadow in the corner actually start movin’. You always think there' s somethin’ you can do about it. Let me tell you straight, there ain’t. Once the dark knows you're there, there ain' t nothin’ you can do to keep it from findin’ you.

I’d been out the hospital bout’ two weeks nd it ain’t been no walk in the park. Ever since the swamp, things have been.. off. Maybe that's an understatement, but it's hard to describe what's happenin’ to me. I see things now, in the shadows. I see things movin’, shapes nd figures in the dark. I leave the lights on in my apartment now, but that doesn't stop the dreams. I see that impossible tower in its monochrome landscape. I see that eerie green light flowin’ like water as if it’s alive. I see Mary.

I awoke early, nd immediately knew somethin’ was wrong. The room was dark and quiet. I stayed still,that conjures demons from the dark. Then I felt the cold hand slide over my bicep nd grip firmly. It pulled me onto my back nd I couldn't help but look next to me. Layin’ there starin’ at me with those emerald glowin’ eyes was Mary, practically naked except for the sheer green garment she was wrapped in. She was no longer the mud-covered fanatic I met in the swamp. She was clean nd ghostly pale, luminescent even. Suddenly her eyes rolled back into her head nd her mouth gaped open wide. A thick, slimy black tendril pushed its way out of her mouth as I watched in horror. I pushed myself away, fallin’ onto the floor. My body hit the ground nd with a blink the world changed. It was mornin’, nd the gulls cawed loudly outside my window. I looked at the empty bed nd sagged into myself lettin’ out the breath I didn't realize I was holdin’.

I took my time gettin’ ready, tryin’ to put back together my frayed nerves. As I finished, I looked in the direction of my safe where I had stashed that heretical book. I tried lookin’ at it before, but as soon as I saw the best possible rendition of the Emerald Tower I locked it away. I knew I'd have to look at it some time, but that time wasn’t today, nor hopefully any time soon. I quickly finished up, suddenly wantin’ to be as far from that safe as possible, when I heard a knock on my office door.

“Great..” I muttered to myself as I began headin’ down.

I unlocked the door nd opened it slightly, turnin’ around without lookin’ nd headin’ to my desk.

“Mornin’ deputy.” I said as I grabbed the whiskey bottle nd poured a bit into the cold coffee still on my desk from yesterday.

“How’d ya know it was me?” said Deputy Tom Bellham as he stepped into the door, closin’ it behind him.

“Just a feelin’ Tom.” I said, as I popped two Seltzer tabs into the coffee as well nd stared at it as it bubbled nd frothed. I've been havin’ those too, feelin’s, like my intuition has skyrocketed to new heights.

I side-eyed Tom as he stepped further into my office. I could tell he was uncomfortable. Most people around here have treated me differently since the swamp incident. Maybe it’s because of the rumours of what happened or maybe it's because of my newly green eyes. Could be both for all I know, but I've learned not to make eye contact anymore.

“So did you need somethin’ Tom, or did you just come to stand here?” I said takin’ a sip of my mornin’ concoction.

Tom shifted his feet a bit before answerin’. “I’m guessin’ you ain’t heard the news lately, Jimmy?”

“No Tom, I haven't heard any news. Been sorta keepin’ to myself lately.” I said starin’ into my coffee cup.

“Yea...” Tom said, before continuin’ hesitantly, ""We've had some strangeness in town, Jimmy. Two people are dead.”

I looked at Tom for a moment, his eyes shiftin’ away quickly from mine. “Sounds like your jurisdiction Tom, not mine.”

Tom lets out a long sigh before speakin’, “yea I know Jimmy, but I’m at a loss on this, nd you know the sheriff isn't doin’ a damn thing about it. I could use your help on this one.”

I nodded lookin’ away again nd finishin’ the rest of my coffee. “Alright Tom, tell me what’s goin’ on.” I said walkin’ round my desk nd sittin’ in my chair.

Tom sat down nd went into the details. Apparently the two people died exactly the same way. Both had drowned, but the strange thing was they were found the next day shriveled nd untouched by the water life. Also it’s reported that the second actually walked into the water themselves, nd there’s some evidence the first did the same, though there’s no witnesses. The coroner report basically said the bodies were drained of all fluids. Which is hard to believe since they apparently died in the ocean.

I leaned back in my chair as Tom finished his explanation. “I’m not really sure what I can do with that Tom, not much to go on there.”

Tom nods thoughtfully for a moment, “Yea I know Jimmy, just maybe look into it for me, see if there’s anythin’ I missed.”

“Yea alright, I can do that for you, just keep me updated.” I said.

“Alright Jimmy. Thanks.” He said gettin’ up from his chair. “I’ll see ya round.”

With that Tom walked out the door leavin’ me to ponder the situation. If I didn't know better I'd say this was all coincidence, but even in normal situations, coincidences are a rare thing.

I mulled over things for a moment. Most likely both deaths occurred sometime in the night. I doubt visitin’ the site durin’ the day would yield anythin’ new. Tom may be the only real law in town, but he was pretty thorough. What I could do was talk to the witness of the second incident, Debbie Thornwell. I looked up at the clock nd sighed. Better now than later I suppose.

I got up from my desk, grabbin’ my jacket nd headin’ to the door.

The mornin’ air was brisk as I walked down the damp streets of Portsmouth. The familiar scent of rottin’ fish hangin’ in the cold air. A light fog hung stubbornly as I passed abandoned shops, the sun not yet warm enough to send it to its grave. I pulled up my collar to try nd block the chill wind nd turned down the street to Debbie's home. I looked up at the ramshackle house before walkin’ up its creaky steps nd knockin’ on the door.

The door cracked open, the swollen wood givin’ some trouble before releasin’ the door from its confines. I could see a sliver of Debbie's face, eyes swollen on her weathered face.

“Jimmy, what do you need hun? It ain’t a good time.” She said wearily, lettin’ the door creep open a little more.

“Yea I know Debs. I’m helpin’ Tom with the situation. Just wanted to go over what you saw the other night. Also, I'm sorry for your loss.”

“Everybody’s sorry Jimmy. Doesn't change the fact my husband walked into the sea without any warnin’ or reason.” She said with a heavy sigh. “Come on in Jimmy.”

She opened the door further lettin’ me into the home. Despite outward appearances the inside was warm, cozy nd well lit. I stopped inside nd followed her into the livin’ room where she sat in a well worn lazyboy. Another sat not too far from her, also well worn. I decided to sit on the couch. I sat nd waited for her to begin. There wasn't any rush nd I wasn't gonna push her to start.

“It was bout three in the mornin’ when I felt him get out of bed. At first I thought he was just goin’ to the bathroom, but when I realized the light hadn't turned on I sat up. Bout a minute later I heard the front door open. That door doesn't open without makin’ a hell of a ruckus. So I got up grabbin’ my robe nd headed down to see what the hell he was doin’. When I came down the door was just wide open. I looked down the street nd I see the crazy old bastard walkin’ down the road in his pajamas. I called out to him but he just kept goin’, didn't even look back, like he couldn't hear me at all. So I went after him. I tell you what, Jimmy. I don't think I've seen that old man move that fast in a decade. I chased him down as best I could, but I couldn't catch up. That's when I realized we were headin’ towards the beach. As we got closer I noticed somethin’ though, a smell, like right before a big thunderstorm. Anyway, I get to the beach nd there he was, kneelin’ by the water with his arms raised like he is praisin’ the Lord. I was bout to yell out to him again nd move closer, but I swear Jimmy, there was somethin’ movin’ under that water. I may be old, but my sight is still as good as ever. Next thing I know that fool jumps into the sea. Then he was just… gone. He never came back up, Jimmy.” As she finished a couple tears spilled down her cheeks.

I didn't say anythin’ at first. This whole thing had a bad smell to it, just like the swamp case did. My heart started poundin’ as anxiety at the thought started buildin’ inside me. I closed my eyes nd took a deep long breath to steady my nerves before lookin’ back at her.

“Was he doin’ anythin’ before all this Debs? Maybe somethin’ unusual or somethin’?” I asked.

“I don't think so, Jimmy. Well, actually the day before he was askin’ the sheriff bout the other man who died. It was one of his friends from his fishin’ days. They worked on the same boat together.” She said. “You think that has somethin’ to do with this?”

I shook my head. “No, I’m sure it's nothin’ Debs” I lied. “Thanks for goin’ over this with me. I appreciate it.”

She nodded slowly as she watched me get up nd head to the door.

“Take care of yourself Debs.” I said as I stepped back out into the cold, pullin’ the door shut behind me.

The sheriff huh? Odd thing for a man to die the exact same way after askin’ about the previous victim. If the sheriff is involved I'd have to keep an eye on him. Askin’ him about it would only tip him off if he did. I made my trek back to my office as I pondered what to do next. I turned onto the street for the docks nd saw a small crowd ahead of me. I walked over to see what the commotion was about. There were bout fifteen people by a boat. All of them were talkin’ to the captain. A man by the name of Emmet PowelI. I stopped nd listened to the conversation. 

“Was over by the dead reef.” He said loudly. “I pulled up my nets nd they were completely full! Net after net we cast. Hell, my boat's almost full right now!” He said laughin’ nd puffin’ out his chest.

Strange. Every now nd then there's a somewhat decent haul from a lucky boat, but nothin’ like that. It's been bout twenty years since any boat came full into these docks. I didn't like it. I didn't like any of this. I turned away nd headed to my office. Somethin’ was wrong here, nd unfortunately it seemed I'd be the one to have to figure it out.

For the next two days I kept an eye on Sheriff Johnson. This basically consisted of sittin’ outside the sheriff office doin’ absolutely nothin’ nd bein’ bored out of my mind. Eventually he finally broke his routine. The first thing I noted which was strange, was he actually stayed late at the office. Usually from what I had seen he leaves as quickly as possible headin’ straight home. This time though, he didn't leave till close to midnight. This actually caused me a bit of trouble, since I had to follow him extra carefully, often losin’ sight of him because nobody else was walkin’ the streets to give me any cover for bein’ out there so late. Even so, this wasn't my first rodeo. I kept out of sight, followin’ him through the streets to the edge of town. 

As the sheriff made his way through the brush I kept my distance. Only movin’ forward when I lost sight of him. I realized we were headin’ pretty close to the beach where the victims were found, just further away from the actual shore. Finally he stopped, looked around nd headin’ behind a brush covered dune. I waited, watchin’ to see where he went next, but he never came around. Slowly nd quiet-like I made my way towards the dune. I kept a wide distance nd circled to where he should have been. There in the dune was an openin’. A dark cave sat there goin’ downwards into the earth. I was about to head in when I heard a noise. Someone else was comin’, so I backed off findin’ a large brush area nd ducked down into it. Another figure came into view, cloaked in some kind of robe. They went into the cave, quickly disappearin’ into the darkness. I decided to wait to see if anyone else showed up. The last thing I wanted was to go in just to have myself pincered between these people.

I sat waitin’ in that brush nd counted five more cloaked figures that went into that cave. Knowin’ I was outnumbered nd not wantin’ to get myself into an impossible situation, I stayed sittin’ in that brush. I figured I'd wait till they all left nd explore this cave afterwards. So I waited, waited for hours until they finally came out. They darted off quickly, includin’ the sheriff. After makin’ sure the coast was clear I got up nd headed to the cave. I took one last look around nd then looked back. It was gone. Literally just disappeared in the time I had taken my eyes off it. I pressed a hand to the dune nd felt nothin’ but sand. My stomach dropped. I had hoped this wouldn't be another weird ass situation. All hope of that vanished at that moment. What the hell was goin’ on in this town?

I got back to my office nd plopped into my chair. For a while I just stared at the ceilin’, wonderin’ what the hell I should do next. My eyes slowly shifted to my safe. I got up with a sigh nd moved to it. With shakin’ hands I unlocked it, takin’ a deep breath before turnin’ the handle nd openin’ the door. The leatherbound tome sat right where I left it, unassumin’ yet ominous in my mind. I removed it from the safe nd took it back to my desk openin’ it hesitantly. The impossible tower glared at me from the page. I could practically see the emerald light emanatin’ from its peak. I quickly turned the page. The text was some form of cuneiform, but I could understand, in a way. Like a whisper in the back of my mind.

“His light shines through time and space, blessing us who are chosen.

The chosen await the seeker to breach the veil.

May He walk amongst us, showing us the truth of the abyss.”

Even bein’ able to read it didn't make it any more understandable. The next page showed another picture with script underneath it. A jewel shone on the page, I could guess what kind of light emanated from its depths.

“It connects us to the void, to Him.

It is the key, a small piece of His light.

Through shattered dreams the way will open.

The dweller of the deep holds the key’ where the black pyramid keeps vigil.”

Dweller of the deep… the name itself made me nauseous. I closed the book, feelin’ a bit ill. Memories of the swamp flooded my brain. The smell of burnin’ flesh fillin’ my nostrils. I grabbed the nearby trash bin, vomitin’ what little food I had eaten earlier in the day. My head swam as I lifted myself back up. My vision blurrin’ as the light seemed to dim. Shadows shifted around the blurred tunnel of my vision. Hands gently cupped my face as it was lifted to meet green eyes. Another pair covered my eyes from behind, leavin’ me in darkness. Suddenly, thick soft rope-like appendages wrapped around my wrists, the slick leathery flesh tightenin’ around them nd pullin’ me down to my knees. Before I could scream another wrapped around my throat nd squeezed tight.

“Shhh…” A feminine whisper reached my ears, “You're almost there James… so close..”

I awoke to the sun stingin’ my eyes. My body was prone on the floor of my office in an awkward position. I pushed myself up, feelin’ sore nd stiff. I could still feel the moist undulatin’ appendages on my wrists nd neck. I looked down at my wrists. where large bruises wrapped around them. I assumed there was one on my neck as well. My hands began to shake as I pressed them into my chest, just sittin’ there as I tried to calm myself. Eventually I got up off the floor, my gait unsteady as I went back to my desk chair nd sat down. I picked up my phone nd dialed in a number.

“Tom, I need your help.”

Tom sat in my office as I explained what I discovered. I had to give the guy credit. He listened to every word I said before callin’ me crazy.

“Jimmy, I think you're losin’ your shit.” He stated matter of factly. “A cave that disappears. The sheriff part of some cult. I don't like the guy either, but that doesn't mean he is worshippin’ Satan, nd what the hell happened to your neck?”

“It's not Satan, Tom.” I said with a sigh, ignorin’ his inquiry bout my bruises. “I don't know what it is honestly, but it's bad. Listen, you ain’t gotta believe me, I'll show you. Just wait for my call nd meet me here.” I pointed out a spot on a map of the town nd surroundin’ areas. The same spot where the cave appeared before. “Just when you get there stay hidden nd keep an eye out. You'll see, Tom, I swear to you.”

Tom eyeballed me for a good ten seconds before respondin’ with a look like he was entertainin’ a child. “Fine Jimmy, but if this turns out to be bullshit then you better go get some help.”

I nodded to him nd with one long last look he turned around nd left the office. I leaned back in my chair as I watched him go, fiddlin’ with a pen on my desk as I contemplated my next move. I'd have to wait again. I'd have to watch the sheriff nd call Tom the next time he stayed late at the office. I felt bad gettin’ Tom involved, but I barely made it out alive from the swamp, nd I had help back then too. I'd have to be more careful this time. I had to make sure we both survived whatever encounter awaited us in that cave.

Another long, borin’ week passed by. I watched the sheriff the same as before, nd just like before he followed the same routine, until he didn't. When the sheriff was two hours past his usual leavin’ time I called Tom. 

“Tonight Tom. Be there before midnight, nd be armed.” I said into the phone before hangin’ up, not waitin’ for a response.

When he left about thirty minutes before midnight I followed. I was just as careful as before, no, perhaps even more careful. I didn't even see him step into the cave because I stayed so far behind. I circled the dune of the cave just like before, headin’ to the same hidin’ spot I had used previously. As I neared it a hand grabbed my jacket nd pulled me down into the brush. It was Tom, lookin’ at me all bug-eyed.

“Jesus Tom, you nearly made me piss myself.” I said, swallowin’ down the scream that almost erupted from my throat.

“Yea, you're freaked out?” Said Tom, his voice shakin’ slightly. “How do you think I feel? What the fuck is this Jimmy?”

“I already told you, be quiet, more people are gonna show up.” I said, turnin’ my attention to the cave entrance.

As if on queue more people showed nd entered the cave. Tom nd I watched silently until I counted the same amount of people walkin’ in as before. We waited a small bit longer. I didn’t wanna be caught off guard by extras possibly showin’ up to whatever this was. I got up from the ground nd motioned for Tom to follow quietly. He was hesitant at first, but I saw him set his jaw, eyes narrowin’ in a newly determined look as he nodded nd began to follow. He drew his pistol nd I drew my own revolver in response. Then, we headed into the cave.

The cave was dark, damp nd cold. It got so dark at one point we had to keep a hand on the wall to keep our bearin’. We walked for a long time. How long I don't know. The lack of light made it hard to guess time or any kind of distance traveled. Then I smelled it. There was a scent of ozone in the area, growin’ stronger as we moved. Ahead of us a cold bluish light began to shine into the tunnel. Soon I could see an exit nd as we neared it I looked back at Tom. He looked back at me wide-eyed, sweat drippin’ down his brow. Turnin’ back I stepped onto the narrow path beyond the stiflin’ tunnel.

I stopped dead in my tracks as I saw what lay before us. Tom ran into my back before grabbin’ my shoulder nd steadyin’ himself. I swear I heard a small whimper escape from him as he did, but I didn't blame him as I looked at our surroundin’s. We were on a narrow bridge-like path, one side had a ledge about waist high nd every so often a torch jutted up from it burnin’ with a bluish white flame. There was  nothin’ holdin’ up the gray lookin’ rock we stood on. To our left was a drop that seemed to go at least a hundred feet before meetin’ black still water. I felt drops of wetness splatterin’ down on us now nd then, nd lookin’ up I was met with another lake of the same black water, only this time grey lights shifted beneath it, or above it? Some of the lights were single, others in pairs, some in strange clusters. I pulled my gaze away to look further down the bridge. There in what seemed like miles ahead of us, yet only a few hundred feet was a black pyramid, juttin’ out of the water. Dark obelisks surrounded it, the surfaces of all were smooth nd seamless as if made of single pieces of obsidian. I realized then the only color around us was the blue of the flames, nd it faded into the same greyish light that seemed to illuminate our path.

I felt Tom's hand shakin’ on my shoulder. I quickly looked back nd took his head in my hands turnin’ it to face me.

“Don’t look too hard, Tom. Don't think too hard. Focus on me. Don’t let it enter your mind ok?” I said, lookin’ into his shaky eyes to see if he understood. He swallowed hard nd seemed to focus on me just a bit better. “Listen, if you need to go back, then go back. I won't blame you. Do what you have to do, Tom.”

He seemed to look at me then, really look. Then he closed his eyes, swallowed hard nd took a deep breath. Finally he opened them nd his gaze seemed much more solid. 

He grimaced nd shook his head. “No Jimmy, I can't leave you here alone, nd.. I need to see what this is. I can't turn back now.”

I nodded nd patted his shoulders, grateful for him stickin’ at my side. I turned around nd began to walk the path to either death or madness.

The walk to the pyramid was silent nd short. Much shorter than should have been expected. As we reached the entrance, a smooth rectangular entryway that showed no signs of a builder's touch, I looked back. The exit from the tunnel wasn't even visible, as if we had walked miles from where we started. We entered the pyramid. I took one wall while Tom took the other. We both moved forward slowly. As we made our way further inside, carved murals began to show on the walls. I say carved, but once again there was no sign of tool marks, just smooth glass-like rock formin’ strange pictures. Some showed humanoid creatures that seemed to be mixed with an angler fish. Fins jutted from their arms nd long teeth from their mouths. Their eyes were bulbous on their fish-like heads. I saw the tower again depicted in another carvin’. Its shape more true than the picture in the grimoire, but not quite as blasphemous as the visions I had seen. Either way it hurt my eyes to look upon them. They seemed to shift nd move without actually doin’ so. I looked away nd saw Tom opposite me rubbin’ his eyes. I looked at him raisin’ an eyebrow to silently ask if he was doin’ ok. He looked back with reddened eyes nd nodded. His face fixed into a look of grim determination as we continued our way further into the pyramid’s depths.

As we delved deeper we began to hear somethin’. There was a chantin’ comin’ from ahead. I gripped my revolver tighter as we walked. Tryin’ to be silent as a chamber opened ahead of us. We stayed back in the entryway when we reached the room. It was round nd tall. We could see the cloaked figures standin’ in a circle. Their arms were up as they chanted in a language that reminded me of the cultists in the swamp, but it was what sat in the middle that truly put fear in my heart. Sittin’ center was a large, mummified creature. It had to be at least thirty feet tall sittin’ down. I could see the sharp teeth juttin’ from its dried gums. Dry, dead eyes sat bulbously on the sides of its withered head. Long skeletal arms came down its sides nd folded in its lap, endin’ in webbed nd clawed hands. In front of its dried husk floated an object omittin’ a familiar emerald light. It was the jewel from the book, floatin’ nd pulsin’ with the chants of the people around it. This must be the dweller in the deep.

The ceilin’ was the same black water from outside. And as we watched a figure fell from the water. It was one of the townsfolk. That same fisherman who had been braggin’ bout his impossible catch. As we stood watchin’ he writhed on the ground in front of the jewel. Then slowly his flesh began to sink in on itself. He grew thinner nd thinner until just like the creature before him, he became nothin’ but a dried husk of a man. He let out one final gasp of breath before one of the hooded figured picked him up nd carried him to a small slot in the wall. He pushed the corpse into it nd a splash was heard after a moment.

Tom stood on the opposite wall from me mouth agape as he looked into the room. I tried to silently get his attention but his eyes were fixed. Tears began drippin’ from them as he stood unblinkin’. I made my way quietly to his side nd turned him away from the nightmarish sight. He blinked stupidly at me for a moment before wipin’ his eyes nd liftin’ his pistol. Then he looked me dead in the eye. I knew then we weren't leavin’ this place without a fight. Noddin’ I lifted my revolver as well, turnin’ towards the room nd takin’ aim.

The next moments were a blur of muzzle flashes nd movin’ bodies. We fired again nd again. The people there fallin’ to the ground one by one as we shot them down. We didn’t think, didn't have to. We would end this blasphemy here nd now. I pulled my trigger over nd over till only clicks came from my gun. The empty cylinder spinnin’ with each pull of my finger. Tom stood beside me as both of us lowered our weapons. Tears streamed down his face as he looked around, his gun still smokin’ from expendin’ its magazine. My eyes were fixed however. The jewel pulled me closer to it nd soon I was standin’ before it, lookin’ into its emerald depths. I felt Tom's hand on my shoulder nd his voice registered in my ears.

“Jimmy, we have to go man.” He said lookin’ at me.

I reached out a hand to the jewel, when suddenly another movement caught my eye beyond it. The creature. I stared for a moment nd felt Tom's hand grip my shoulder even harder. One of the fingers on that horrendous clawed hand began to curl slowly inward. 

We both turned nd took flight. I don't remember gettin’ outside but suddenly we were both on the sandy ground heavin’ in breath. I looked back behind us, but the cave was gone once again. I stood up weakly lookin’ at Tom nd smilin’ the best I could.

“We did it Tom. We stopped them, nd made it out in one piece.” I said with a small chuckle of relief.

But Tom wasn't smilin’, he wasn't even lookin at me. Instead he was lookin’ down at my hand where I held my gun, his face givin’ off a sickly green glow.

“Tom, what's wrong?” I said lookin’ down at my hand.

It wasn't my gun. It was the jewel, glowin’ brightly in my grip nd coverin’ us with its strange greenish light. I felt terror grip my chest as I looked at it. When did I grab it? How did I not realize it was in my hand? Then I felt somethin’ cold nd wet hit my neck once, then again. I looked up nd saw small flakes of snow fallin’ from a dark cloudy sky. It didn't snow here.

“Fuck.” I breathed.",1,1761251485.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

(Part 02),"[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheEmeraldKing1988/comments/1nqz88c/im_a_pi_for_a_local_port_town_a_girl_has_gone/)

Parents always tell you there's no such thing as monsters. I'm not so sure about that anymore. What if you look into the dark nd find there actually is somethin’ there? Nobody prepares you for the loss of sleep. Nobody prepares you for the utter fear of seein’ that shadow in the corner actually start movin’. You always think there' s somethin’ you can do about it. Let me tell you straight, there ain’t. Once the dark knows you're there, there ain' t nothin’ you can do to keep it from findin’ you.

I’d been out the hospital bout’ two weeks nd it ain’t been no walk in the park. Ever since the swamp, things have been.. off. Maybe that's an understatement, but it's hard to describe what's happenin’ to me. I see things now, in the shadows. I see things movin’, shapes nd figures in the dark. I leave the lights on in my apartment now, but that doesn't stop the dreams. I see that impossible tower in its monochrome landscape. I see that eerie green light flowin’ like water as if it’s alive. I see Mary.

I awoke early, nd immediately knew somethin’ was wrong. The room was dark and quiet. I stayed still,that conjures demons from the dark. Then I felt the cold hand slide over my bicep nd grip firmly. It pulled me onto my back nd I couldn't help but look next to me. Layin’ there starin’ at me with those emerald glowin’ eyes was Mary, practically naked except for the sheer green garment she was wrapped in. She was no longer the mud-covered fanatic I met in the swamp. She was clean nd ghostly pale, luminescent even. Suddenly her eyes rolled back into her head nd her mouth gaped open wide. A thick, slimy black tendril pushed its way out of her mouth as I watched in horror. I pushed myself away, fallin’ onto the floor. My body hit the ground nd with a blink the world changed. It was mornin’, nd the gulls cawed loudly outside my window. I looked at the empty bed nd sagged into myself lettin’ out the breath I didn't realize I was holdin’.

I took my time gettin’ ready, tryin’ to put back together my frayed nerves. As I finished, I looked in the direction of my safe where I had stashed that heretical book. I tried lookin’ at it before, but as soon as I saw the best possible rendition of the Emerald Tower I locked it away. I knew I'd have to look at it some time, but that time wasn’t today, nor hopefully any time soon. I quickly finished up, suddenly wantin’ to be as far from that safe as possible, when I heard a knock on my office door.

“Great..” I muttered to myself as I began headin’ down.

I unlocked the door nd opened it slightly, turnin’ around without lookin’ nd headin’ to my desk.

“Mornin’ deputy.” I said as I grabbed the whiskey bottle nd poured a bit into the cold coffee still on my desk from yesterday.

“How’d ya know it was me?” said Deputy Tom Bellham as he stepped into the door, closin’ it behind him.

“Just a feelin’ Tom.” I said, as I popped two Seltzer tabs into the coffee as well nd stared at it as it bubbled nd frothed. I've been havin’ those too, feelin’s, like my intuition has skyrocketed to new heights.

I side-eyed Tom as he stepped further into my office. I could tell he was uncomfortable. Most people around here have treated me differently since the swamp incident. Maybe it’s because of the rumours of what happened or maybe it's because of my newly green eyes. Could be both for all I know, but I've learned not to make eye contact anymore.

“So did you need somethin’ Tom, or did you just come to stand here?” I said takin’ a sip of my mornin’ concoction.

Tom shifted his feet a bit before answerin’. “I’m guessin’ you ain’t heard the news lately, Jimmy?”

“No Tom, I haven't heard any news. Been sorta keepin’ to myself lately.” I said starin’ into my coffee cup.

“Yea...” Tom said, before continuin’ hesitantly, ""We've had some strangeness in town, Jimmy. Two people are dead.”

I looked at Tom for a moment, his eyes shiftin’ away quickly from mine. “Sounds like your jurisdiction Tom, not mine.”

Tom lets out a long sigh before speakin’, “yea I know Jimmy, but I’m at a loss on this, nd you know the sheriff isn't doin’ a damn thing about it. I could use your help on this one.”

I nodded lookin’ away again nd finishin’ the rest of my coffee. “Alright Tom, tell me what’s goin’ on.” I said walkin’ round my desk nd sittin’ in my chair.

Tom sat down nd went into the details. Apparently the two people died exactly the same way. Both had drowned, but the strange thing was they were found the next day shriveled nd untouched by the water life. Also it’s reported that the second actually walked into the water themselves, nd there’s some evidence the first did the same, though there’s no witnesses. The coroner report basically said the bodies were drained of all fluids. Which is hard to believe since they apparently died in the ocean.

I leaned back in my chair as Tom finished his explanation. “I’m not really sure what I can do with that Tom, not much to go on there.”

Tom nods thoughtfully for a moment, “Yea I know Jimmy, just maybe look into it for me, see if there’s anythin’ I missed.”

“Yea alright, I can do that for you, just keep me updated.” I said.

“Alright Jimmy. Thanks.” He said gettin’ up from his chair. “I’ll see ya round.”

With that Tom walked out the door leavin’ me to ponder the situation. If I didn't know better I'd say this was all coincidence, but even in normal situations, coincidences are a rare thing.

I mulled over things for a moment. Most likely both deaths occurred sometime in the night. I doubt visitin’ the site durin’ the day would yield anythin’ new. Tom may be the only real law in town, but he was pretty thorough. What I could do was talk to the witness of the second incident, Debbie Thornwell. I looked up at the clock nd sighed. Better now than later I suppose.

I got up from my desk, grabbin’ my jacket nd headin’ to the door.

The mornin’ air was brisk as I walked down the damp streets of Portsmouth. The familiar scent of rottin’ fish hangin’ in the cold air. A light fog hung stubbornly as I passed abandoned shops, the sun not yet warm enough to send it to its grave. I pulled up my collar to try nd block the chill wind nd turned down the street to Debbie's home. I looked up at the ramshackle house before walkin’ up its creaky steps nd knockin’ on the door.

The door cracked open, the swollen wood givin’ some trouble before releasin’ the door from its confines. I could see a sliver of Debbie's face, eyes swollen on her weathered face.

“Jimmy, what do you need hun? It ain’t a good time.” She said wearily, lettin’ the door creep open a little more.

“Yea I know Debs. I’m helpin’ Tom with the situation. Just wanted to go over what you saw the other night. Also, I'm sorry for your loss.”

“Everybody’s sorry Jimmy. Doesn't change the fact my husband walked into the sea without any warnin’ or reason.” She said with a heavy sigh. “Come on in Jimmy.”

She opened the door further lettin’ me into the home. Despite outward appearances the inside was warm, cozy nd well lit. I stopped inside nd followed her into the livin’ room where she sat in a well worn lazyboy. Another sat not too far from her, also well worn. I decided to sit on the couch. I sat nd waited for her to begin. There wasn't any rush nd I wasn't gonna push her to start.

“It was bout three in the mornin’ when I felt him get out of bed. At first I thought he was just goin’ to the bathroom, but when I realized the light hadn't turned on I sat up. Bout a minute later I heard the front door open. That door doesn't open without makin’ a hell of a ruckus. So I got up grabbin’ my robe nd headed down to see what the hell he was doin’. When I came down the door was just wide open. I looked down the street nd I see the crazy old bastard walkin’ down the road in his pajamas. I called out to him but he just kept goin’, didn't even look back, like he couldn't hear me at all. So I went after him. I tell you what, Jimmy. I don't think I've seen that old man move that fast in a decade. I chased him down as best I could, but I couldn't catch up. That's when I realized we were headin’ towards the beach. As we got closer I noticed somethin’ though, a smell, like right before a big thunderstorm. Anyway, I get to the beach nd there he was, kneelin’ by the water with his arms raised like he is praisin’ the Lord. I was bout to yell out to him again nd move closer, but I swear Jimmy, there was somethin’ movin’ under that water. I may be old, but my sight is still as good as ever. Next thing I know that fool jumps into the sea. Then he was just… gone. He never came back up, Jimmy.” As she finished a couple tears spilled down her cheeks.

I didn't say anythin’ at first. This whole thing had a bad smell to it, just like the swamp case did. My heart started poundin’ as anxiety at the thought started buildin’ inside me. I closed my eyes nd took a deep long breath to steady my nerves before lookin’ back at her.

“Was he doin’ anythin’ before all this Debs? Maybe somethin’ unusual or somethin’?” I asked.

“I don't think so, Jimmy. Well, actually the day before he was askin’ the sheriff bout the other man who died. It was one of his friends from his fishin’ days. They worked on the same boat together.” She said. “You think that has somethin’ to do with this?”

I shook my head. “No, I’m sure it's nothin’ Debs” I lied. “Thanks for goin’ over this with me. I appreciate it.”

She nodded slowly as she watched me get up nd head to the door.

“Take care of yourself Debs.” I said as I stepped back out into the cold, pullin’ the door shut behind me.

The sheriff huh? Odd thing for a man to die the exact same way after askin’ about the previous victim. If the sheriff is involved I'd have to keep an eye on him. Askin’ him about it would only tip him off if he did. I made my trek back to my office as I pondered what to do next. I turned onto the street for the docks nd saw a small crowd ahead of me. I walked over to see what the commotion was about. There were bout fifteen people by a boat. All of them were talkin’ to the captain. A man by the name of Emmet PowelI. I stopped nd listened to the conversation. 

“Was over by the dead reef.” He said loudly. “I pulled up my nets nd they were completely full! Net after net we cast. Hell, my boat's almost full right now!” He said laughin’ nd puffin’ out his chest.

Strange. Every now nd then there's a somewhat decent haul from a lucky boat, but nothin’ like that. It's been bout twenty years since any boat came full into these docks. I didn't like it. I didn't like any of this. I turned away nd headed to my office. Somethin’ was wrong here, nd unfortunately it seemed I'd be the one to have to figure it out.

For the next two days I kept an eye on Sheriff Johnson. This basically consisted of sittin’ outside the sheriff office doin’ absolutely nothin’ nd bein’ bored out of my mind. Eventually he finally broke his routine. The first thing I noted which was strange, was he actually stayed late at the office. Usually from what I had seen he leaves as quickly as possible headin’ straight home. This time though, he didn't leave till close to midnight. This actually caused me a bit of trouble, since I had to follow him extra carefully, often losin’ sight of him because nobody else was walkin’ the streets to give me any cover for bein’ out there so late. Even so, this wasn't my first rodeo. I kept out of sight, followin’ him through the streets to the edge of town. 

As the sheriff made his way through the brush I kept my distance. Only movin’ forward when I lost sight of him. I realized we were headin’ pretty close to the beach where the victims were found, just further away from the actual shore. Finally he stopped, looked around nd headin’ behind a brush covered dune. I waited, watchin’ to see where he went next, but he never came around. Slowly nd quiet-like I made my way towards the dune. I kept a wide distance nd circled to where he should have been. There in the dune was an openin’. A dark cave sat there goin’ downwards into the earth. I was about to head in when I heard a noise. Someone else was comin’, so I backed off findin’ a large brush area nd ducked down into it. Another figure came into view, cloaked in some kind of robe. They went into the cave, quickly disappearin’ into the darkness. I decided to wait to see if anyone else showed up. The last thing I wanted was to go in just to have myself pincered between these people.

I sat waitin’ in that brush nd counted five more cloaked figures that went into that cave. Knowin’ I was outnumbered nd not wantin’ to get myself into an impossible situation, I stayed sittin’ in that brush. I figured I'd wait till they all left nd explore this cave afterwards. So I waited, waited for hours until they finally came out. They darted off quickly, includin’ the sheriff. After makin’ sure the coast was clear I got up nd headed to the cave. I took one last look around nd then looked back. It was gone. Literally just disappeared in the time I had taken my eyes off it. I pressed a hand to the dune nd felt nothin’ but sand. My stomach dropped. I had hoped this wouldn't be another weird ass situation. All hope of that vanished at that moment. What the hell was goin’ on in this town?

I got back to my office nd plopped into my chair. For a while I just stared at the ceilin’, wonderin’ what the hell I should do next. My eyes slowly shifted to my safe. I got up with a sigh nd moved to it. With shakin’ hands I unlocked it, takin’ a deep breath before turnin’ the handle nd openin’ the door. The leatherbound tome sat right where I left it, unassumin’ yet ominous in my mind. I removed it from the safe nd took it back to my desk openin’ it hesitantly. The impossible tower glared at me from the page. I could practically see the emerald light emanatin’ from its peak. I quickly turned the page. The text was some form of cuneiform, but I could understand, in a way. Like a whisper in the back of my mind.

“His light shines through time and space, blessing us who are chosen.

The chosen await the seeker to breach the veil.

May He walk amongst us, showing us the truth of the abyss.”

Even bein’ able to read it didn't make it any more understandable. The next page showed another picture with script underneath it. A jewel shone on the page, I could guess what kind of light emanated from its depths.

“It connects us to the void, to Him.

It is the key, a small piece of His light.

Through shattered dreams the way will open.

The dweller of the deep holds the key’ where the black pyramid keeps vigil.”

Dweller of the deep… the name itself made me nauseous. I closed the book, feelin’ a bit ill. Memories of the swamp flooded my brain. The smell of burnin’ flesh fillin’ my nostrils. I grabbed the nearby trash bin, vomitin’ what little food I had eaten earlier in the day. My head swam as I lifted myself back up. My vision blurrin’ as the light seemed to dim. Shadows shifted around the blurred tunnel of my vision. Hands gently cupped my face as it was lifted to meet green eyes. Another pair covered my eyes from behind, leavin’ me in darkness. Suddenly, thick soft rope-like appendages wrapped around my wrists, the slick leathery flesh tightenin’ around them nd pullin’ me down to my knees. Before I could scream another wrapped around my throat nd squeezed tight.

“Shhh…” A feminine whisper reached my ears, “You're almost there James… so close..”

I awoke to the sun stingin’ my eyes. My body was prone on the floor of my office in an awkward position. I pushed myself up, feelin’ sore nd stiff. I could still feel the moist undulatin’ appendages on my wrists nd neck. I looked down at my wrists. where large bruises wrapped around them. I assumed there was one on my neck as well. My hands began to shake as I pressed them into my chest, just sittin’ there as I tried to calm myself. Eventually I got up off the floor, my gait unsteady as I went back to my desk chair nd sat down. I picked up my phone nd dialed in a number.

“Tom, I need your help.”

Tom sat in my office as I explained what I discovered. I had to give the guy credit. He listened to every word I said before callin’ me crazy.

“Jimmy, I think you're losin’ your shit.” He stated matter of factly. “A cave that disappears. The sheriff part of some cult. I don't like the guy either, but that doesn't mean he is worshippin’ Satan, nd what the hell happened to your neck?”

“It's not Satan, Tom.” I said with a sigh, ignorin’ his inquiry bout my bruises. “I don't know what it is honestly, but it's bad. Listen, you ain’t gotta believe me, I'll show you. Just wait for my call nd meet me here.” I pointed out a spot on a map of the town nd surroundin’ areas. The same spot where the cave appeared before. “Just when you get there stay hidden nd keep an eye out. You'll see, Tom, I swear to you.”

Tom eyeballed me for a good ten seconds before respondin’ with a look like he was entertainin’ a child. “Fine Jimmy, but if this turns out to be bullshit then you better go get some help.”

I nodded to him nd with one long last look he turned around nd left the office. I leaned back in my chair as I watched him go, fiddlin’ with a pen on my desk as I contemplated my next move. I'd have to wait again. I'd have to watch the sheriff nd call Tom the next time he stayed late at the office. I felt bad gettin’ Tom involved, but I barely made it out alive from the swamp, nd I had help back then too. I'd have to be more careful this time. I had to make sure we both survived whatever encounter awaited us in that cave.

Another long, borin’ week passed by. I watched the sheriff the same as before, nd just like before he followed the same routine, until he didn't. When the sheriff was two hours past his usual leavin’ time I called Tom. 

“Tonight Tom. Be there before midnight, nd be armed.” I said into the phone before hangin’ up, not waitin’ for a response.

When he left about thirty minutes before midnight I followed. I was just as careful as before, no, perhaps even more careful. I didn't even see him step into the cave because I stayed so far behind. I circled the dune of the cave just like before, headin’ to the same hidin’ spot I had used previously. As I neared it a hand grabbed my jacket nd pulled me down into the brush. It was Tom, lookin’ at me all bug-eyed.

“Jesus Tom, you nearly made me piss myself.” I said, swallowin’ down the scream that almost erupted from my throat.

“Yea, you're freaked out?” Said Tom, his voice shakin’ slightly. “How do you think I feel? What the fuck is this Jimmy?”

“I already told you, be quiet, more people are gonna show up.” I said, turnin’ my attention to the cave entrance.

As if on queue more people showed nd entered the cave. Tom nd I watched silently until I counted the same amount of people walkin’ in as before. We waited a small bit longer. I didn’t wanna be caught off guard by extras possibly showin’ up to whatever this was. I got up from the ground nd motioned for Tom to follow quietly. He was hesitant at first, but I saw him set his jaw, eyes narrowin’ in a newly determined look as he nodded nd began to follow. He drew his pistol nd I drew my own revolver in response. Then, we headed into the cave.

The cave was dark, damp nd cold. It got so dark at one point we had to keep a hand on the wall to keep our bearin’. We walked for a long time. How long I don't know. The lack of light made it hard to guess time or any kind of distance traveled. Then I smelled it. There was a scent of ozone in the area, growin’ stronger as we moved. Ahead of us a cold bluish light began to shine into the tunnel. Soon I could see an exit nd as we neared it I looked back at Tom. He looked back at me wide-eyed, sweat drippin’ down his brow. Turnin’ back I stepped onto the narrow path beyond the stiflin’ tunnel.

I stopped dead in my tracks as I saw what lay before us. Tom ran into my back before grabbin’ my shoulder nd steadyin’ himself. I swear I heard a small whimper escape from him as he did, but I didn't blame him as I looked at our surroundin’s. We were on a narrow bridge-like path, one side had a ledge about waist high nd every so often a torch jutted up from it burnin’ with a bluish white flame. There was  nothin’ holdin’ up the gray lookin’ rock we stood on. To our left was a drop that seemed to go at least a hundred feet before meetin’ black still water. I felt drops of wetness splatterin’ down on us now nd then, nd lookin’ up I was met with another lake of the same black water, only this time grey lights shifted beneath it, or above it? Some of the lights were single, others in pairs, some in strange clusters. I pulled my gaze away to look further down the bridge. There in what seemed like miles ahead of us, yet only a few hundred feet was a black pyramid, juttin’ out of the water. Dark obelisks surrounded it, the surfaces of all were smooth nd seamless as if made of single pieces of obsidian. I realized then the only color around us was the blue of the flames, nd it faded into the same greyish light that seemed to illuminate our path.

I felt Tom's hand shakin’ on my shoulder. I quickly looked back nd took his head in my hands turnin’ it to face me.

“Don’t look too hard, Tom. Don't think too hard. Focus on me. Don’t let it enter your mind ok?” I said, lookin’ into his shaky eyes to see if he understood. He swallowed hard nd seemed to focus on me just a bit better. “Listen, if you need to go back, then go back. I won't blame you. Do what you have to do, Tom.”

He seemed to look at me then, really look. Then he closed his eyes, swallowed hard nd took a deep breath. Finally he opened them nd his gaze seemed much more solid. 

He grimaced nd shook his head. “No Jimmy, I can't leave you here alone, nd.. I need to see what this is. I can't turn back now.”

I nodded nd patted his shoulders, grateful for him stickin’ at my side. I turned around nd began to walk the path to either death or madness.

The walk to the pyramid was silent nd short. Much shorter than should have been expected. As we reached the entrance, a smooth rectangular entryway that showed no signs of a builder's touch, I looked back. The exit from the tunnel wasn't even visible, as if we had walked miles from where we started. We entered the pyramid. I took one wall while Tom took the other. We both moved forward slowly. As we made our way further inside, carved murals began to show on the walls. I say carved, but once again there was no sign of tool marks, just smooth glass-like rock formin’ strange pictures. Some showed humanoid creatures that seemed to be mixed with an angler fish. Fins jutted from their arms nd long teeth from their mouths. Their eyes were bulbous on their fish-like heads. I saw the tower again depicted in another carvin’. Its shape more true than the picture in the grimoire, but not quite as blasphemous as the visions I had seen. Either way it hurt my eyes to look upon them. They seemed to shift nd move without actually doin’ so. I looked away nd saw Tom opposite me rubbin’ his eyes. I looked at him raisin’ an eyebrow to silently ask if he was doin’ ok. He looked back with reddened eyes nd nodded. His face fixed into a look of grim determination as we continued our way further into the pyramid’s depths.

As we delved deeper we began to hear somethin’. There was a chantin’ comin’ from ahead. I gripped my revolver tighter as we walked. Tryin’ to be silent as a chamber opened ahead of us. We stayed back in the entryway when we reached the room. It was round nd tall. We could see the cloaked figures standin’ in a circle. Their arms were up as they chanted in a language that reminded me of the cultists in the swamp, but it was what sat in the middle that truly put fear in my heart. Sittin’ center was a large, mummified creature. It had to be at least thirty feet tall sittin’ down. I could see the sharp teeth juttin’ from its dried gums. Dry, dead eyes sat bulbously on the sides of its withered head. Long skeletal arms came down its sides nd folded in its lap, endin’ in webbed nd clawed hands. In front of its dried husk floated an object omittin’ a familiar emerald light. It was the jewel from the book, floatin’ nd pulsin’ with the chants of the people around it. This must be the dweller in the deep.

The ceilin’ was the same black water from outside. And as we watched a figure fell from the water. It was one of the townsfolk. That same fisherman who had been braggin’ bout his impossible catch. As we stood watchin’ he writhed on the ground in front of the jewel. Then slowly his flesh began to sink in on itself. He grew thinner nd thinner until just like the creature before him, he became nothin’ but a dried husk of a man. He let out one final gasp of breath before one of the hooded figured picked him up nd carried him to a small slot in the wall. He pushed the corpse into it nd a splash was heard after a moment.

Tom stood on the opposite wall from me mouth agape as he looked into the room. I tried to silently get his attention but his eyes were fixed. Tears began drippin’ from them as he stood unblinkin’. I made my way quietly to his side nd turned him away from the nightmarish sight. He blinked stupidly at me for a moment before wipin’ his eyes nd liftin’ his pistol. Then he looked me dead in the eye. I knew then we weren't leavin’ this place without a fight. Noddin’ I lifted my revolver as well, turnin’ towards the room nd takin’ aim.

The next moments were a blur of muzzle flashes nd movin’ bodies. We fired again nd again. The people there fallin’ to the ground one by one as we shot them down. We didn’t think, didn't have to. We would end this blasphemy here nd now. I pulled my trigger over nd over till only clicks came from my gun. The empty cylinder spinnin’ with each pull of my finger. Tom stood beside me as both of us lowered our weapons. Tears streamed down his face as he looked around, his gun still smokin’ from expendin’ its magazine. My eyes were fixed however. The jewel pulled me closer to it nd soon I was standin’ before it, lookin’ into its emerald depths. I felt Tom's hand on my shoulder nd his voice registered in my ears.

“Jimmy, we have to go man.” He said lookin’ at me.

I reached out a hand to the jewel, when suddenly another movement caught my eye beyond it. The creature. I stared for a moment nd felt Tom's hand grip my shoulder even harder. One of the fingers on that horrendous clawed hand began to curl slowly inward. 

We both turned nd took flight. I don't remember gettin’ outside but suddenly we were both on the sandy ground heavin’ in breath. I looked back behind us, but the cave was gone once again. I stood up weakly lookin’ at Tom nd smilin’ the best I could.

“We did it Tom. We stopped them, nd made it out in one piece.” I said with a small chuckle of relief.

But Tom wasn't smilin’, he wasn't even lookin at me. Instead he was lookin’ down at my hand where I held my gun, his face givin’ off a sickly green glow.

“Tom, what's wrong?” I said lookin’ down at my hand.

It wasn't my gun. It was the jewel, glowin’ brightly in my grip nd coverin’ us with its strange greenish light. I felt terror grip my chest as I looked at it. When did I grab it? How did I not realize it was in my hand? Then I felt somethin’ cold nd wet hit my neck once, then again. I looked up nd saw small flakes of snow fallin’ from a dark cloudy sky. It didn't snow here.

“Fuck.” I breathed.

Here’s What I Learned from the Pros in Tennessee,"Outdoor spaces hit different lately. They’re not just “extra” anymore they’re part of the home. A screened porch especially… feels like that perfect middle ground. Fresh air, no bugs, just peace.

I went down the rabbit hole learning about screened porch builds, and honestly—there’s way more to it than just throwing up a few screens. A good screened porch contractor doesn’t just “install.” They design something that fits your home *and* your lifestyle.

What really stood out to me while researching companies (like JBS Enclosures in Tennessee) is how much craftsmanship actually matters. It’s not just nails and mesh. It’s how the porch handles heat, humidity, airflow, and even drainage. The pros think about stuff you’d never Google—like how your house expands through seasons or how to balance airflow so it doesn’t feel like a sauna.

**Some takeaways:**

* DIY sounds fun, but permits, measurements, and structural planning are no joke.
* The right screens make a huge difference micro-mesh or solar screens keep bugs out *and* air moving.
* Design matters more than people think. It should look like part of your home, not something tacked on.
* It actually adds resale value. And comfort. Like… real comfort.

If you’re in Tennessee (or anywhere humid), screened porches are game changers. Coffee mornings, rainy days, late-night hangs they just work.

I’ve been job hunting recently after a layoff, and like many people, I wanted to refresh my LinkedIn profile. But I really didn’t want to spend hundreds at a studio just for a few professional headshots.

Since AI photo tools have become pretty popular lately, I decided to test a few of them myself.
Here’s my honest experience after trying five different AI headshot websites — including Nano Banana, Headshot Pro, BetterPic, Magic Hour AI, and a newer one I recently found called Headshot.vip.

1️⃣ Nano Banana
Features:
Upload a photo or use text prompts to generate images — not limited to headshots. It supports both image editing and text-to-image generation.
Quality:
Pretty solid! The results looked like me, realistic enough without heavy “AI vibes.” Generation time was quick.
Pricing:
💰 $15/month for 150 credits; each generation uses a few credits.
Summary:
Great if you’ll use it often — credits don’t expire, and it can create other types of images.
But for one-time use, the subscription model isn’t very practical.

2️⃣ Headshot Pro
Features:
Professional-looking platform focused entirely on AI-generated headshots.
Quality:
Depends heavily on your selfie quality. My first try (bad lighting) wasn’t great — long processing time, and some noticeable AI artifacts. I bought the Basic plan ($29), and the resolution wasn’t that high.
Summary:
Looks professional but not worth it for budget users. Maybe the higher plans give better results, but for me, the basic tier didn’t feel like good value.

3️⃣ Headshot.vip
Features:
Found this one on X (Twitter). Super simple site — just upload and generate. No extra clutter, focused purely on headshots.
Quality:
Really impressive 🔥 The photos are 4K HD and look realistic; my friends said it genuinely looked like me. Styles are preset (four fixed looks). Generation took only a few seconds.
Pricing:
💰 $3.99 for 1 photo, $4.99 for 2, $5.99 for 3, $6.99 for 4.
No subscriptions, no upsells — just pay for what you need.
Summary:
Perfect for anyone who wants quick, professional-looking headshots without subscriptions. Fast, affordable, and simple — though style options are limited.

4️⃣ Magic Hour AI
Features:
Can generate both videos and images — not focused solely on headshots.
Quality:
Decent, but not perfect. Some results didn’t quite look like me and had clear AI traces. The free version adds a watermark, though quality is still better than Canva’s free AI generator.
Pricing:
⚡ Free tier gives 400 credits (but includes watermark).
Paid plans start at $12/month for commercial-use and higher-quality results.
Summary:
Nice that it offers a free test, but results aren’t studio-level.
Better if you also need videos or creative visuals — not ideal for pure headshots.

5️⃣ BetterPic
Features:
Strictly for professional headshots — no other image types.
Quality:
Excellent 👌 4K resolution, lifelike results, minimal AI artifacts. Looks like a proper studio shot.
However, advanced retouching costs extra, and some users said results vary by person.
Pricing:
💰 Starts at $35; most recommended plan is $39 with optional add-ons.

Summary:
Top-tier quality if you have the budget. Photos look genuinely professional, but it’s pricey and has extra costs if you want touch-ups.

💡 Final Thoughts
If you just need a few good professional photos without spending too much,
👉 Headshot.vip was the best balance of price, simplicity, and realism for me.
If you plan to use AI tools more regularly or want extra features,
🧠 Nano Banana or BetterPic might make sense.
Either way, it’s wild how far these tools have come — you can literally get a LinkedIn-ready photo for the price of a coffee ☕

The world didn't know it yet, but everything was about to change. I was a director at a company, helping them win government contracts and making the owners rich. The work was fine, but I was just a well-paid cog in someone else's machine. My wife and I had our first child on the way, and I had this burning desire to build something for us, on my own terms.

So, with zero savings and not a single client lined up, I decided to go for it. Then, the pandemic slammed into us. My old company announced a 25% pay cut for everyone. That was the sign I needed. I walked out the very same day, my heart pounding in my chest. It was the purest mix of terror and freedom I've ever felt.

The first three months were brutal. I'm talking 8-10 hours a day on the phone, cold-calling strangers, facing rejection after rejection until my ears buzzed. The 'no's started to feel personal. At night, fueled by cheap coffee, I was glued to my laptop, trying to teach myself how to build a website and run a business from scratch. My wife's belly was growing, the world was locking down, and I was just a guy in a spare room, wondering if I'd made the biggest mistake of my life.

Then, one day in May, it happened. A 'yes.' A real client. He agreed to my proposal, and I charged him $5,000. It might as well have been a million. I remember just staring at the signed contract, the ink looking like the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. I was so buzzing with adrenaline and relief that I didn't sleep a wink that night. That one 'yes' was the proof I needed that this crazy, terrifying leap might actually work.

Fast forward to today, and that one-man-show run from a spare room has become a team of eight. This year, we're on track to hit about $2.5 million in revenue. It's been a wild, stressful, and absolutely incredible ride. I wouldn't trade the sleepless nights or the endless cold calls for anything.

This happened today at the Fortune 50 company I work for.

What nonsense is that? I swear to you there were very competent people among them.

Just a bunch of them, sitting there laughing and drinking their expensive coffee while they coldly destroy the future of a whole generation of people whose only concern is to make a living and give for the people they love.

Honestly, forget 'eat the rich' for now. We're at the 'EAT HR' stage, and let them be the appetizer.",20,1761250987.0,FinalRoundAI,1,0.95,False

Last time I had one of their coffees was well before the rebranding when they were still called Kawa so I don't have recent experience

I'm not opposed to spend that money for that quantity of coffee, but if I do I want an actual ""premium"" product, the roast and have to match the price, I don't want to pay just for brand or posh marketing

Today my mental health has been nothing short of horrendous (anxiety and depression), I have felt so low - after yesterdays gain I am doubting whether I can do this, I have already slipped quite a bit with stupid things but I feel like I am already spiralling, I feel the plan is too much. I have also been so emotional about my mum today and the urges to restrict even more are SOOO strong, it's scary. I haven't done awful today but have attached my meal plan for reference, also hoping it may help you goys call me out and give me some accountability. My activity was also A-LOT higher today because my foot is finally better so I went on a walk with a friend (which saved my mental health today ngl). Dad has reminded me I don't want to get back into this cycle and end up in hospital again, I have too much to live for! I did do well, but it isn't a 5 day thing, it isn't even a 50 day thing, this is my life - if I choose recovery. 

I should always eat when I am hungry, what I like, treat my body with respect and food won't consume my whole life because if I restrict I risk loosing everything to anorexia. I know I am not there yet (intuitive eating I mean) but today I failed the plan again which inly helps the ED grow stronger, I missed a snack and skimped on meals so I felt hungry and dizzy, I don't want this MISERABLE existence again. 

As I have said I have attached my meal plan in the hopes maybe some of you could help plan a few days of eating based on my plan? Also to help hold me accountable. I am struggling so much and could use any words of wisdom!!",7,1761250914.0,recoveryplates,2,1.0,False

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

After a lot of searching I found someone I got along with and we decided to team up to rent an apartment. Since we are both broke, we needed someone else. We both made posts online and after a few days he let me know that he had found someone to join us. This is where my issues started. The guy I teamed up with (B) has found this guy (F) online and pretty much promised him a place without learning anything about him / asking him any questions. I asked B multiple times to tell me about F or send his contact information but B never did. F and I ended up touring the apartment which is how I met him. I asked him general roommate things (how clean he is, if he would have friends over a lot, sleep schedule, loudness, etc..). F pretty much told me he was chill for everything and would be very clean in the shared space. This was a lie. F needed to move in first because his lease for where he was staying was ending. I moved in less than a week later and the place was already kinda trashed. Food/coffee beans/protein powder all over the kitchen, unwashed dishes, random shit everywhere, piss splatter in the bathroom, disposable floss on the floor.. you get it. I told F that I understood he was still getting settled and had been living alone for a few days but I needed him to start cleaning up after himself. He told me he would ""lock in"". Since then the situation has just gotten worse and more hostile. F constantly leaves his messes everywhere in the shared space to the point where if you wanted to use the living room / kitchen you would have to clean up after him. Me and B are both fed up with him and have talked to him multiple times and every single time he promises to change but never does. Some things that he has done which has made the situation intolerable for me are:

**- Invites his friends over to drink and leaves 10+ beer cans all over the living room of our small apartment + spills beer on the floor and of course doesn't clean it**

**- Leaves half eaten tuna sandwiches on the table before he leaves for work so the entire place stinks**

**- Gets wasted multiple times a week and throws up all over the bathroom and poorly cleans it up**

**- Constantly leaves (a lot of) water on every surface he touches which leads to water damage to the apartment / furniture**

**- Never takes out the trash and piles soda cups on it which then spill sticky soda on everything (this has led to mold growing in the cabinet under the sink which is where the trash was.**

**- Doesn't tell me or B when he gets utility bills and lets them go unpaid for weeks (since he moved in first he was the one who set up utilities so only he gets the bill emailed / can pay it)**

**- Generally his messes are damaging the furniture in the apartment which is 90% mine (that my relatives GIFTED TO ME FROM THEIR HOUSES)**

B and I have talked to him about every single one of these issues and I have written up a roommate agreement that I encouraged him to give input on but he refuses to listen to / sign or read anything we bring to him. He has zero respect for me or my concerns and will openly mock me to my face and behind my back to his friends and B. I am torn between living in filth or cleaning up his messes. I am not his goddamn mother. This has pushed me to a breaking point especially because my stepdad died a month ago and i have been driving multiple hours every weekend to check on my mom / attend funerals and memorials and every time I get back the place is disgusting. I don't have the mental or financial capacity to move out of the apartment and we are all signed on the same lease so I don't see a way forward to get him to leave because I doubt he will agree to leave on his own.

My friends have suggested calling the cops on him for underage drinking or something but everyone (including me) in the apartment drinks and I don't want this to go further than it has to. B has been kinda supporting me in that he cleans up after himself and has talked to F multiple times at my request because it seems F will listen to B more than me.

**Please help me guys. I am seriously starting to loose it and I feel totally out of my depth on this. If there's anything I can do let me know please. The next thing I am going to try is print out more of the roommate agreements and make it clear that agreeing to it is a mandatory thing and there will be monetary consequences if you break it. I honestly just want him out though he is a toxic person and I think B and I would be much happier if he was just gone.**

**Dear diary**



I feel .... actually I don't know how I feel. After me and the hot nurse got together in the supplies closet on the hospital I sneaked into the on-call room to have some coffee and rest. The Superstar Report was on. Some paparazzi or something got some shots of Cassandra's wedding. I know the Goths are these high profile old money folk, but you would think Sim City would have moved on by now. 



Poor thing. So shy and always on the public eye. Glad they didn't get a chance to see what I did to her on our wedding. Guess the Security of Goth manor is leagues beyond whatever her new fiancé got going on. From what I remember he was this loser painter she couldn't shut up about. According to the paparazzi he is now an accomplished photographer. Guess they kinda go together. Much better match than me. Anyone is a better match than me at this point. Good for her.



**Dear Diary**



Some loser lost the remote to the tv on the on-call room. I just want to glance at the Llamas game every once in a while. Is that too much to ask??



**Dear Diary**



Someone better find that remote soon. That celebrity gossip channel got a hold of Dina Landgraab's new baby. If they could just STOP showing my exes that would be amazing. Though I can't say it reflects badly on my own rep. Aw yeah, the Don-Minator. Everyone seems to be getting together huh. Everyone... but me. 



**Dear Diary**



WAS THAT BELLA GOTH IN CASSANDRA'S WEDDING PHOTOS?



**Dear Diary**



I am going to be sick. Who should come into the hospital to have a baby but Nina?? No wonder she has been avoiding me for the past 9 months. I wonder who the father is. She says she doesn't know (one thing we both have in common is we like to party). Anyways, little baby boy Bolero is healthy, strapping and handsome! He will be a real lady killer someday!



**Dear Diary**



I am a bit ashamed to say I have used the telescope to look into Nina and Bolero more than once. Reminds me a lot of my own mom, raising me alone. Nina is not exactly struggling financially. But I know how hard it is to raise a kid alone. I should do something to help.

What is it like in your team? 

Do you have the ability to go for coffee breaks with your team? 

Do you get on well with nursing staff? ",7,1761250424.0,doctorsUK,6,0.82,False

I feel like some posts we scroll through is either about buuq, bad news, or debates 😅 so let’s take a little mental break today.

Drop one thing that either:

keeps you grounded,

motivates you when life feels heavy, or

simply makes you smile.


It could be a quote, a small daily habit like grabbing a coffee, taking a shower, a reminder, or even something funny that gets you through tough days.

I’ll start with a quote, 

> “The world is already loud enough, peace is found in the moments you choose to stay calm.”

Also sometimes times when I feel bored I go for a bike for like 30 minutes then grab an ice cream🍦🍨.

Yes, yes. Tons of work for developers and probably would never happen, but just thought I'd share.

Been loving playing over the last year. Just jumped back into my first save. 

Great game tho ",1,1761250374.0,satisfactory,1,0.6,False
