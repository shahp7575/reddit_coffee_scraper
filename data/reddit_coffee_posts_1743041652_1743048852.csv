1jkvizq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jkvizq,Zoom75 Tiga and ZoomPad Tiga in Cafe Brown,"SA Espresso caps from Signature Plastics
Everglide Aqua King switches
PC flex cut plate
Poron foam kit
‚ÄúElastic Bar‚Äù mount

First time building from barebones. Once I got the hang of installing the stabs it was easy. The little spacers they give you to wedge into the backside of the stab attach point are a bit of a nightmare, though.

Connection was painless and VIA works well with current json files. Even the app to connect to the screen worked perfectly on the first try. My only minor gripe is that the slowest selectable animation speed is still faster than I‚Äôd like. I want a slow, sexy coffee pour to go with this symphony in brown.

The ZoomPad Tiga doesn‚Äôt have its own build video or assembly guide, and the are enough differences that it probably should get one for the sake of first timers. Fortunately I built the pad second and between lessons learned from the 75 and interpreting the discrepancies with the old model, it was an easy build.

The sound is fantastic. I had the same switches on a Monsgeek M1W V3 and the Tiga has a noticeably richer and deeper tone. The caps were moved from a Womier RD75 with its default linears and that was a huge difference.

Overall I gotta say I‚Äôm pretty impressed with my first group buy and barebones build experience. Delivery time was barely longer than originally planned and a lot of the complaints I saw about the original Zoom75 are pretty well sorted out.

Bonus pics of the M1W and RD75 before and after the keycap and switch swaps.

What started as an experiment turned into an intense 7-day coding sprint‚Äîworking 14+ hours a day to complete the **Adima AI Image Upscaler Lite** app.

Here‚Äôs a quick look at the app:

üñºÔ∏è **4K AI-Powered Upscaling**  
The app allows users to upscale images up to 4K resolution using AI, with all the processing done locally on their device‚Äîno cloud uploads, just fast results.

üì± **On-Device Processing**  
Everything is handled right on the phone. No need for an internet connection or worrying about your photos being uploaded elsewhere.

‚ö° **Built in 7 Days**  
In just 7 days (and a lot of coffee!), I built this app using **Java** for the backend and **Flutter** for the UI to create a lightweight, smooth experience. The goal was to keep the performance optimized for a variety of Android devices while still delivering high-quality results.

üîç **Side-by-Side Comparison**  
There‚Äôs even a feature to compare the original and upscaled images side-by-side to see the difference in quality.

Working on this side project was both exhausting and incredibly rewarding. It was amazing to see how much can be accomplished in such a short time with the right focus and motivation. Now it‚Äôs available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aiimageupscale.adimaaiimageupscalerlite), and I‚Äôd love for you to check it out and let me know your thoughts!

If anyone else is juggling side projects or working on something similar, I‚Äôd love to hear your experiences and how you manage the intense work hours!

Thanks for reading, and hope you find the app useful!",1,1743048449.0,SideProject,0,1.0,False

1jkvfyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/FellowProducts/comments/1jkvfyx/make_sure_your_stagg_lid_has_all_three_holes/,Make sure your Stagg lid has all three holes aligned! A horror story about ants.,"Story time! 

So my Stagg kettle‚Äôs lid was misaligned. It has three holes, but only two of them actually went all the way through. This led to the the misaligned holes making an entrance into the void between the lid pieces, which would usually be airtight and inaccessible. 

Three other things aligned:
- Ants like heat.
- Ants like water.
- Rarely I‚Äôll accidentally overfill the kettle, which pressurizes it and it steams and sputter when it boils.

Sometime last spring, without me noticing, hundreds of ants tried to get into the kettle, but got stuck in the center void and died. 

And for months, I steeped those ants with my coffee water.

I could have died never knowing, but a few weeks ago I overfilled the kettle again when boiling some water.

‚Ä¶Which led to it blowing pressurized steam into and out the ant graveyard, geysering ants across the kitchen.

I was so confused about where they came from (after not seeing any ants for six months) until I noticed the misaligned holes, so if you have an ant problem, *check your lids*. When I opened it to fix it, there were still hundred of ants in that void. No mold though, so Fellow gets props for the materials quality! ü•≤",1,1743048175.0,FellowProducts,0,1.0,False

Why even ask?,"I‚Äôm 27f and he‚Äôs 30m. Idk I‚Äôm just confused tbh. For background info there‚Äôs this cafe/ bar I go to and get coffees from pretty frequently since it‚Äôs right next to my work and they do a food and beverage discount for people who work downtown. There‚Äôs this guy who started working there a few months back and ever since I met him when he‚Äôs there he gives me free stuff and is genuinely really sweet. Like one time he saw a coworker of mine come in and asked her if I was working because if I was he wanted to give her my usual coffee order. And then one day he actually asked me for my number. We ended up hanging out ( this happened a week ago ) and I thought it went well. 

We hadn‚Äôt texted much since we hung out but he wanted me to come in Sunday when he was working because that was also when I was gonna be done working and when I came in his coworker even seemed to know something was up and immediately grabbed him for me. We chatted for a bit and then before I left he asked me when I was free next because he wanted to hang out again. I told him the days I had off and he said he‚Äôd have to let me know because he‚Äôs also pretty busy with school work  but kinda implied that one of those days should work. I ended up texting him later when I got home and said if he was too busy that day we could also do the other day he‚Äôs off since I could be free later that day then too. And he responded ‚Äúgood I‚Äôm glad we have options.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt respond because I figured he would just let me know later since he told me would in person.  


We were supposed to do something either today or yesterday and I never heard a word from him since that last text Sunday. I wouldn‚Äôt have even cared if he told me he couldn‚Äôt but I felt like I was completely left hanging. 
 I was leaving the ball in his court since I already told him I was free and wanting to hang out again and to let me know and he never did. I just don‚Äôt understand why ask and act like you want to hang out if you won‚Äôt even communicate with me after? The silence kind of makes me wonder if he really wasn‚Äôt as interested as I thought. Like maybe he wasn‚Äôt sure about me after we actually hung out the first time but idk. Even if you are busy it takes two seconds to text someone and tell them that or if you aren‚Äôt feeling it why even ask for a second hangout? so I‚Äôm feeling kinda upset about the whole thing. Am wondering if I should just let it go instead of calling him out like I want to and just not talk to him again and maybe find a new coffee spot while I‚Äôm at it.

1jkvcp3,https://www.reddit.com/r/StartUpIndia/comments/1jkvcp3/unused_coupons_marketplace_your_thoughts_need/,üõçÔ∏è Unused Coupons Marketplace ‚Äì Your Thoughts? (Need Feedback!),"Hey everyone! üëã I‚Äôve been brainstorming an idea for a marketplace where people can **buy, sell, or trade unused coupons/discount codes** (like those sitting in your email, apps, or physical mailers). Before diving in, I‚Äôd love to hear your honest opinions:  

### **The Problem**  
- We all get coupons we‚Äôll never use (expiring soon, wrong product, etc.).  
- Others might *really* want those discounts but can‚Äôt access them.  
- Throwing them away feels wasteful!  

### **The Idea**  
A platform where:  
‚úÖ List unused coupons (free or for a small fee).  
‚úÖ Search for deals you actually need.  
‚úÖ Trade coupons with others (e.g., swap a 20% clothing code for a coffee discount).  

### **Benefits?**  
- **Save money** by grabbing discounts you need.  
- **Declutter** your inbox/wallet.  
- **Eco-friendly** ‚Äì less waste!  

### **Questions for YOU:**  
1. Would you use this? Why/why not?  
2. Biggest concerns? (e.g., scams, expired codes)  
3. Should it focus on digital codes, physical coupons, or both?  
4. Any features you‚Äôd want? (e.g., verified sellers, expiration alerts)  

No idea is perfect, so roast this or boost it ‚Äì all feedback is welcome! üôå  

**TL;DR:** Marketplace to sell/trade unused coupons. Good idea or nah?

we said goodbye and to me, i thought that we had a really good time. i was going to text thank you again but a resident started having a breakdown so i was preoccupied. i check my phone and he sends me texts about how im inconsiderate and didnt eat the cupcake and that im not thankful. he says im not appreciative and that im always being inconsiderate. he also was really upset about the starbucks because he didnt want to pay but felt he had to. 

it‚Äôs just frustrating because sometimes i want things like coffee and im very much willing to buy it myself. i always say i can buy it myself. however, every time he offers and then gets upset. i don‚Äôt know if im inconsiderate or not. i‚Äôd honestly prefer not getting these surprises or gifts anymore because he‚Äôs always mad after.

. originally i thought that the books would have type/copy throughought the pages that i could design and style as well, and thus showcase my typography skills, but i have a feeling most photographers will want pretty much just images and not not copy in their books, according to a conversation i had with one photographer yesterday. is there a way that i can still show off my publication skills with typesetting and imagery? should i urge them to let me try to add a bit of copy to some of the pages? would the book still be great for me to add to my portfolio in that it would still show off my strengths as a designer even if it didnt really include much type? 

  
I'm wondering if this was a good choice for a personal project for me, as a strong portfolio piece idea to add for editorial design jobs.

Sharing a video of a bottomless shot I just pulled on my Flair 58 Plus. Still new to all this, so I‚Äôd really appreciate any feedback or advice!

Process / Details:
	‚Ä¢	Coffee: Costa Rican from La Cabra, Denmark, roasted for both filter and espresso
	‚Ä¢	Dose: 18g in, 45g out
	‚Ä¢	Grinder: Timemore Sculptor 064s
	‚Ä¢	Prep: WDT + calibrated level tamper
	‚Ä¢	Temp: Water at 95¬∞C, group preheated to max
	‚Ä¢	Pressure Profile: 10 sec at 3 bars, then ramped up to 6‚Äì7 bars for ~25 sec, then slowly ramped down. Total shot time ~45 sec
	‚Ä¢	Taste: Sweet, fruity, slightly sour to my taste ‚Äì but definitely enjoyable. This was my 3rd shot with this coffee, and I‚Äôve been going finer with each pull.
	‚Ä¢	Concerns: I think there was some channeling (you can probably spot it in the video), and I‚Äôm not sure if I should keep going finer or tweak something else. Honestly, as a beginner, each shot just tastes better than the last, but I know there‚Äôs room to improve.

Would love to hear what others think ‚Äì any tips on improving distribution, puck prep, or dialing this in even further?

But when you move away, you change. Your favorites change. And your dad, who always knew, might not realize it because he isn‚Äôt there to see it happen.  

I realized this today when my dad woke me up with my favorite flowers. It‚Äôs his little ritual,waking me up with a dessert or a small gift, just because.  

But today, it hit me‚Äîmy favorite dessert now is Mocha Madness from The Big Chill, and he doesn‚Äôt know that.

1jkv5g7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZZZ_Official/comments/1jkv5g7/quitting_zzz/,Quitting ZZZ,"Hello everyone! This is my first post on this subreddit, and funnily enough, it is about me quitting Zenless Zone Zero. It has been a fun journey, but now it has come to an end, and I am willing to share the reasons that led me to stop playing. I just want to clarify that I have no problems with the game itself. Throughout the entirety of my experience playing, I have enjoyed everything that the game offered. But as time passed, it has become harder for me to continue playing. Also, english is not my first language. Sorry!

Burnout:

One of the biggest factors that led me to stop playing was simply because I had reached my limit and felt burnt out from the gacha experience as a whole. This is not the first time, as I did experience the same feeling before, but not as bad. ZZZ might be the first gacha game I played, and I can confidently say that it is just not for me. I love the game's storytelling as it is intriguing and full of mystery, the characters are unique and aesthetically appealing, the combat is flashy and satisfying, and the events presented to us throughout the game‚Äôs lifespan are wacky and fun. It is just that the more time I spend on the game, the less interested I become over time. Why? Who knows? Maybe because I get overwhelmed every time a new update drops or because I am starting to develop a TikTok attention span. Either way, I sadly can‚Äôt get myself to continue playing the game.

The gacha system:

To make things straight, I am a free-to-play casual player when it comes to games such as ZZZ. I never spend money on any in-game items, no matter how much hype is involved or how overpowered a new character is being released. With that being said, my biggest problem is (you guessed it) the amount of grinding you have to do to be able to keep up with everything. I know that among other similar types of games, ZZZ has the least amount of grinding needed. However, it still requires a bit of grinding to keep up with the content that is being released. I am not just talking about discs, exp, and items that level up your characters. I am also talking about polychrome. More specifically, polychrome for new characters and W-engines. As a free-to-play player, you can only choose one of the following four items: a new character, their new W-engine, a returning character you did not unlock, or their W-engine. Unless you get extremely lucky, you are bound to get at least one of the four things in the store (that is if you get lucky, of course). I know some of you may not have that problem, but if you are a free-to-play player will you understand how incredibly hard it is to deal with that.

Bugs and performance problems:

I have been playing this game since its full release, and I have been encountering the same problems to this day. There is an audio bug/glitch where when I enter combat, the entire sound of the game becomes buggy. The audio is either delayed, choppy, or just completely disappears. This has been going on since 1.0, and I have been sending reports with no luck. There is also the issue of the game stuttering from time to time, whether in free roam or in combat. I play on PC with an RTX 3060 and a Ryzen 5 5600. It may not be the strongest rig, but I am pretty sure that it can handle the game with medium-high settings. Now I have been tolerating these problems since 1.0 because at the end of the day I enjoyed playing, but it has become more and more infuriating to deal with.

Menus/loading screens:

Before I start, I just want to point out that the game is already installed on my SSD, and I am still having some problems with the loading times. Sometimes the loading screens are manageable, and sometimes they take a long time to load. To me that's fine, and I have no problems waiting a couple of minutes. The main issue is the amount of menus throughout the game, and there are A LOT.

Opening the store? Menu. Going outside? Loading screen. Buy coffee? Menu. Going to the outpost? Loading screen. You get the point. I am not saying that I want them to remove menus completely. But we can agree that there is an abundant amount of menus throughout the game. I have noticed that almost half of my time playing is spent going from menu to menu before entering combat for 5-10 minutes.

Final thoughts:

I just want to reiterate that I love ZZZ and have been playing almost every day trying to build the most overpowered builds for my characters. But at the end of the day, I haven‚Äôt been able to keep up with the events and content being released. There is so much more I want to say, but I think I have said enough. Even though I have said that I am quitting, I will keep being up-to-date with any new character releases and lore since I still love the game and what it offers. Thank you so much for reading my nonsense, and I wish you luck on your future pulls.

P.S: Personal opinion, but I believe removing TV mode from the campaign was a bad decision. Removing TV mode from content such as events and outpost missions was important because it kind of made them much longer than what they were supposed to be, making them tedious. In the campaign, however, TV mode acted as a breathing room between combat where you had to solve puzzles while also listening to conversations related to the plot, making it useful and sometimes fun. But hey, that's just an opinion. A personal opinion. Thanks for reading.",0,1743047199.0,ZZZ_Official,3,0.19,False

1jkur1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jkur1h/aita_for_blocking_my_father_in_title/,AITA for blocking my father in title?,"My father mostly in title and when he feels like it currently lives in another country, far away. He's always been an absent father, lived as a teenage boy who didn't like coming home. He and mother were divorced many years back, they got back together for the sake of my and my 5 younger siblings, but even before, during and after the divorce, he never really lived with us. He'd only come home as a guest and stay for about a week, and then dive away somewhere. 

I never blamed him for anything, although he managed to have 6 kids, he didn't want that marriage to begin with, and he was forced to marry young as my mother was. However, I never blamed him for anything, until recently. I always had understanding for him, though he didn't deserve it. 
Both he and my mom were forced into a marriage, only she managed to fall in love with him, while he found liking to other women, I guess it wasn't as bad for her cause she loved him, but it definitely made it harder than he never fell for her but rather other women; anyhow, she stayed and did her motherly duties her whole life, wasted her youth on my and my siblings, while he wasted no time on us and was always with friends, drinking and God knows what. Older me blames him for not saying, never being a parent, I cannot deny the times he spent with me, he taught me some valuable lessons that I still remember but he never suffered like mom did.
He never stayed up all night when we were sick, never cooked, cleaned, did our laundry, took us to school etc. 

Sometimes his visits would last a month caus he didn't have another place to turn to, unstable life, he never officially lived with us as far as I remember (in the last 10 years), some of those visits were fun and nice cause we missed our dear handsome and kind father, but some, the more recent ones as we grew, were horrible. 

He had such weird habits and mindset that he'd turn the smallest thing into a nightmare for me, scare me to hell only to laugh at the end. Once I went to the city with mom to shoot a picture for my ID when I was old enough, he kept spam calling for I didn't tell him that I was going and asked for him permission. I cried cause I was so scared that day, he'd taken some friends car and followed us to the city, when he arrived however...he wasn't upset? Like... what the..

My younger brother, got involved with a bad set of dudes who taught him bad habits, smoking and drugs amongst them. Dad was in jail during the time my brother started hanging out with that group, but once he got out, he forbid those friends. Mom had 5 other kids to look out for and couldn't prevent a teenage boy from hanging with friends, she couldn't track him at all times. During that time I was betrayed that my little sweet brother had started doing nasty stuff and changed so drastically, the drastic change became worse and worse when he'd threaten me and my other siblings with a knife over small things/fights. We always normally fought or played like any other siblings but no knives were involved before that. I remember that I called the police on my brother, once or perhaps twice. Father was God knows where and mom was drinking coffee at her friends, that day he held a knife at us, we managed to lock ourselves in a room and I was shaking. I think it was the first time ever I shaked that way so I remember it well and the first thing on my mind was to call the police and so I did. 

My brother's behaviour was probably not much different at school, cause by the end 2 people...maybe from his school or social services came at our house and talked to mom. They asked me and my other siblings about him as well, one even tried to explain his behaviour by saying maybe we'd provoked him (purposely) but I swear to God I never did such a thing. I assume my mom was once called by the social services and talked about him after so and gradually they took him in to some accommodation (?). 

At that time I think I was of 15 years, and he was 12/13. It was so bad that I once texted my hometeacher that I would quit school cause little overdramatic me viewed the whole situation as utterly hopeless...

On several occasions afterwards, dad accused *me* and mom to the be the reason my brother ended in such a place. In an accommodation where there were other teens of similar nature but much worse that would teach my brother even worse stuff and be worse influence. I never argued cause he shut me down and I honestly think the stress maybe erased some of my memory back then or dad was making false accusations. He's so sure that I and mom went to social services and told them to take him... but I truly can't remember doing it but he's so convinced regardless. 

Now my little brother should be officially in jail, only the thing that happened occurred a couple of months before he became 18 so he's back in the same accommodation. 

As I said, he's currently overseas and in a really bad place. I don't want to go into much details but he basically isn't allowed to live and work there for much longer because of papers and such, he *can* comeback to this country but then he'd have to be in jail for half a year. Totally the consequences of his own actions, but still, he's at that bad place right now. Like he basically has truly nowhere to stay and no future to build. And he's blood. 

I have blocked him maybe 3 weeks ago because we talked on the phone and he blamed me for that happened to my brother and I couldn't take it anymore, I hung up (disrespectful child) and blocked him. Like shut the fuck up, I'm no responsible father to him and I genuinely don't remember ever going to the social services. 

So that call that led to the block was on WhatsApp, where I had a picture of my face as a pfp, scary? I'd had that picture for a good while until he found a problem with it, big problem. 
I'd just gotten back from work when he wanted to speak to me, from mom's phone, and he saw that I was wearing makeup! ""Is that how you go to work?""
He said that I didn't go to work to *work* while looking like that, implying I went to whore? 
He swore if I'd go to work with makeup the next day and not take off that pfp, he'd fly over here and kill me knowing what'd happen him. Mind you, MIND YOU, I never heard him say such threats to my ... criminal brother. It's just so... SOOO- 
Today I have 1/5 criminal brothers, and I haven't heard him talk so to any of them. 

I took off the pfp merely because mom asked me like 70 times, but if he's doing all this for a mf WhatsApp pfp and minimal makeup to work... what will he do when I meet a guy? 

I'm 20 today, my 3 oldest friends are married, to marry in summer and engaged. There's a guy that wants to propose to me, but I think his family is one of those that my dad despises, not sure. So I'm really in distress about this. I really wish I could completely cut ties with him, but that's not possible. I know he'll cause a huge huge deal out of it, he thinks none is good enough for me. Like as crazy as he is, he loves me I guess. Growing up he was so strict, though he wasn't around much, I never had a conversation with any guy outside class, never dared to make friends of one cause he said so. I partly did it for my love for him. Anyway I was really a good daughter through and through, never disobeyed even when he wasn't around, always made him proud. 

And he does have authority, not long ago, my divorced aunt found a man to remarry with. He didn't approve of the guy, nor with how they met (God knows) so, though he's not her father, that engagement was shattered. So if he had such authority over his adult sister (she's also overseas, far away from him), God knows what he'll do when I talk of some guy. 

I have two engagement proposals but I've talked to neither, neither did I tell dad about their existence... So the block i speak of isn't only on WhatsApp but also from these big updates on my life. I feel like I'm excluding him from something every father deserves to be part of, but I feel like it's half justified cause he hasn't exactly been thee father. Before we immigrated, first 10 years of my life, he'd been the breadwinner, first time i drove a car was with him, I'd always been his favourite too so I got some outings with him.

I want to tell him for that, and also because I know it's the safer option going forward knowing I can't ever fully cut ties with him. But also telling him... I feel like he'll keep me sheltered forever, I really don't see anyone wanting to marry me seeing how toxic my family is. I'm not Bella Hadid so none will fight for me, and he'll definitely push them away. I don't wanna get married without a father either to be frank, it isn't a good look. I'm scared I'll get teased about it in the future so... 

My grandma talked to me today, and thinks me wrong for blocking my *father*, she's also one who thinks I should hide the engagement proposals from him until later. 
Aside from everything, it's Ramadan right now the holy month, we should be forgiving, especially to our blood naturally... 

So, am I the asshole for blocking my father in title? Should I unblock, talk about his situation, see if I can help? Should I tell him about the engagement proposals? Or should I just go forward with it and see how things unravel without his knowledge at all? 





Here's some more little facts that you might want to consider, if you care.

We're a religious family, for the makeup part, I try to use only minimal to hide acne etc. And he's definitely not one to judge cause he literally went for a woman who has hair & lash extensions and wears makeup on the regular. 

Though we live in the west, our cultural habits are naturally not the norm so obeying his way isn't very easy, I still did it. He was right to tell me not to have guy friends, it isn't good, but he wanted me to have no friends at all. We moved around alot and being the new kid wasn't always easy, at times I didn't socialise with other kids and teacher called him in out of ""worry"", he expressed pride in me taking no friends..like why are you setting me up to be a friendless loser? 
I had very good influence friends who made me go to class more often and study well, and even them he threatened me to not hang out with. 

He made me sacrifice my studies/internship when we traveled to another country out of sudden to take my brother to my grandparents so he wouldn't be taken by social services. He did by the way care for my education very much, scolded when I got bad grades.

I'm a painter and photographer who would love to get connected with local caf√©s, coffee shops, etc, that support artists through exhibiting their work and in exchange, showcase awesome local art on their walls.

I've recently moved to Ontario from a smaller town in BC. There, I knew the shops and the people that would exhibit local art on a rolling basis. Here, I'm not so familiar with much of anything. But I've heard Toronto has a lively art and culture scene and thought I might try my luck.

I'll do some of my own exploring, but just looking to be pointed in the right direction. Toronto is sprawling and a bit intimidating, and my search has only gotten me so far. 

Does anyone have recommendations on where I might start? What cafes/shops to reach out to? Which ones are dedicated to photography vs. painting? Or even other things I might consider as an artist just trying to share my work while providing some kind of exchange like this? 

Also, if you have any other advice related to getting involved with the art scene in general, I'm all ears!

A group of friends and I frequent this cafe kasi literally ilang tumbling lang mula sa office namin and they are open until late pag weekends. 

Recently I was there with the usual group and I was being sweet to one if my friends. We're both guys. And I distinctly saw Mark and Echo look at each other and roll their eyes. I felt bad about it but didn't speak up. Nung nagka time sa office I had to open up sa friends ko kasi ang bigat talaga. Sa Greenfield pa talaga eh hello safe place natin yun with Obar. Sabi nung isa kong friend he noticed it din daw dati pa.  Kaya di siya masyadong happy pag nandun kami and madalas nagpapabili nalang siya.

Another friend (tunay na girl to not beki)had an issue with yung cashier na girl din. My friend kasi can get overwhelmed eh first time niya dun and she was asking about a lot of the drinks. Afternoon yun and nahiwalay siya ng shift sa amin kaya anga-anga si friend mag order. It seemed like the cashier lost patience with her daw and when she said that  she couldn't decide yet the cashier said to another staff na ""ikaw na nga dito"" and stormed off to their back office. My friend said there was no line naman for the cashier to be in a rush. And isn't it just normal to ask about products especially if this is a new establishment?

Friend naman ng girl in the previous story also shared na minsan daw busy lang mag ML yung mga barista kahit may customer waiting to order.

**$350** **- PTS Masada ACR SV DE AEG -**¬†[https://imgur.com/a/6j61CgS](https://imgur.com/a/6j61CgS)

* Various upgrades have been done to it. Purchased back in 2015.
* Spring has been downgraded to M100 spring, and clocked at 346 FPS back when indoor requirements were capped at 360 FPS.
* Wii-Tech steel inner barrel, and Modify Flat Hop bucking are installed
* ~~Wii-Tech Hop up Adjustor Kit and~~¬†Bearing Spring Guide is not installed but included in the package
* 2x midcap PMAGs included (One full markings and one no markings)

* One pack of Element MOE polymer rails in DE for the above picatinny accessories
* Original A2 birdcage flash hider included, just not pictured
* Simple AR carbine soft gun bag included, original box not included

There are a few issues with this model that's expected for a decade old rifle. They are:

* Missing c-clip/retaining clip for handguard pin (can be purchased from Amazon, Home Depot, Cantire)
* One of the rear metal pins to secure stock to lower receiver is missing (can be purchased from PTS Steel Shop website)
* Bolt release feature is faulty. You must manually pull the bolt a bit to release it from its locked position when adjusting hopup.
* One of the midcap mags have mag feeding issue due to weak spring. You can remedy this by replacing the decade old worn out spring with a new one.

Regarding the metal body pin. I can manually measure using a caliper so you can find a similar one from your local store or home hardware center. Same with the retaining clip.

**$380** **- Cyma Platinum MP5 AEG (CM041H) - Asia Model -**¬†[https://imgur.com/a/CO2dBr6](https://imgur.com/a/CO2dBr6)

* Purchased back in 2021, has been used in a few games, wired to Deans
* FPS is capped at 370 FPS, perfect for indoor and outdoor games
* eShooter Kestrel V2 Bluetooth programmable mosfet installed, since the stock mosfet died after a year of use. Kestrel has been tuned by Dave from Airsoft Depot
* 4x additional plastic mags included + 1x original mag that came in the box
* Clone MS2 OD sling and RSA sling adapter included
* One metal M-lok rail adapter included
* The MP5 has a QD latched flash hider with a hidden 14mm CCW threaded barrel beneath it for tracer units or mock suppressors
* Original box and manual included

This rifle has been used in both indoor and outdoor games and has been well taken care of. It's a very snappy and responsive SMG with an impressive 50m effective range with 0.32g BBs. As with all programmable mosfets regardless of whether it's Kestrel, Gate, or Perun, please note it drains batteries fairly quickly. Around 450\~500 rounds in, you will have to plug in a new battery. Tested with HRG 11.1v 1100mAh LiPo.

Additionally, for some reason selector on full auto doesn't seem to register. Either the selector plate is misaligned or the Kestrel isn't intended for an MP5 shell. Regardless, I don't think this is a major issue since majority of fields enforce semi only anyway. You can program the SMG to shoot burst, binary, or full auto on the semi option if needed. I will also include the original packaging for the Kestrel upon selling.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you looking for a delicious and healthy treat that fits into your vegan lifestyle? Healthy vegan blueberry crumble muffins are a perfect addition to your weekly meal prep. Not only are they gluten-free and low-sugar, but they also pack a nutritious punch. Let‚Äôs explore the benefits of making these delightful muffins at home.

One of the standout features of healthy vegan blueberry crumble muffins is their use of wholesome ingredients. They often contain oats, almond flour, and ripe bananas, all of which provide essential nutrients. Here‚Äôs why you should consider adding these muffins to your menu:

- **Nutrient-Dense Ingredients:** The oats provide fiber, which can aid in digestion and keep you feeling full longer. Almond flour is a great source of healthy fats, protein, and vitamins. Blueberries are packed with antioxidants that support overall health.
- **Lower Sugar Content:** Many recipes for healthy vegan blueberry crumble muffins use natural sweeteners such as maple syrup or mashed bananas, which are lower in sugar than refined options. This makes them a guilt-free snack or breakfast choice.
- **Gluten-Free Option:** For those with gluten sensitivities, creating blueberry muffins with almond flour or gluten-free oats allows everyone to enjoy a delicious dessert without worries.
- **Easy to Make:** These muffins are incredibly easy to whip up. In less than an hour, you can have a batch baking in your oven, filling your kitchen with a lovely aroma that tempts your taste buds.

The key to making healthy vegan blueberry crumble muffins is choosing the right ingredients. When selecting your ingredients, focus on high-quality, plant-based items. This will not only improve the taste but also the nutritional value of your muffins. Here are some essential components to consider:

- **Blueberries:** Fresh or frozen blueberries can be used, and they add natural sweetness and vibrant color to your muffins.
- **Gluten-Free Flour:** Almond flour or a gluten-free all-purpose blend can serve as the base, providing texture and flavor.
- **Natural Sweeteners:** Opt for maple syrup, coconut sugar, or ripe bananas instead of regular sugar to keep those sugar levels low.
- **Oats:** Rolled oats can be incorporated into the crumble topping, adding crunch and fiber.

Another benefit of preparing these vegan blueberry crumble muffins is their versatility. You can customize the recipe to fit your taste and dietary needs. Consider experimenting with the following:

- **Other Fruits:** While blueberries are nutrient-rich, feel free to swap in raspberries, strawberries, or even chopped apples for a different flavor profile.
- **Nut Butters:** Adding almond or peanut butter can increase the protein content and create a rich, creamy texture.
- **Spices:** A sprinkle of cinnamon or a dash of vanilla can enhance the taste and add an extra layer of flavor.

Serving these muffins as part of a balanced meal is also easy. Pair them with a smoothie for breakfast, or enjoy them as a tasty snack throughout your day. They can even make a great dessert when you need a sweet treat without the guilt.

he doesn't love me any less I know that's true. but it's gotten to the point now where im starting to hate my body and have fallen back into SH and my old ED because I hate my own skin. i just wish I was attractive like that to him. 

I can't remember the last time he made the first move, and I've stopped trying. I used to try and he'd always reject me but never by saying no - he'd do something like change subject or get up to go do something or ask if I want a coffee or change his seating position so i couldn't get to wherever my hand was. it hurt more than him just saying 'not feeling it tonight' and makes me feel like a creep seeing him physically recoil. 

i hate feeling this way and wish I knew what to do. I have tried buying new toys as a surprise and have gone through so many surprise outfits and lingerie and whatnot but it just never works. he'll go 'ooo that looks nice' but never make a move or be interested at all or take me on when I make a move and i always feel like such a fool. ive tried every angle too, bdsm style, vintage style, cutesy styles, classy styles, anything i can think of and he's just never interested. 

it's not completely dead yet, about once every month or two he will take me on but it just doesn't feel right it feels like he's just trying to keep me happy. it's awkward and clumsy now and it's got to the point where I'll keep a blanket over my abdomen because i am too self conscious for him to fully see me. 

any suggestions?",1,1743044862.0,DeadBedrooms,0,1.0,False

He has been very extremely skiddish which is 100% expected (I know the 3-3-3 rule). He is not potty trained or leash trained, and we don't have a fenced in backyard so getting him to potty has been rough. He seems to understand to go outside, and we've only had 2 accidents so far. 

He loves his crate (except for when we leave he yelps and barks like crazy), and is such a sweet and smart puppy. 

Around 3:00 today, my Fiancee took him for a walk to the dog park to throw away his poop, and he had a bit of a meltdown and wanted to run home - he ran to the wrong house, and then ran underneath a strangers car (all while on the leash). My fiancee picked him up and his meltdown intensified, scratching and pawing like crazy and leaving her face a bit scratched up. 

Since we've gotten him back home, he is maniacally barking at her and it is extremely loud, but acting relatively normal albeit standoffish towards me. We live in a townhouse, so trying to cull his barking without our neighbors putting in a noise complaint is somewhat of a priority. It's been multiple hours now of leaving him be, treating him and positive affirmations, and rewarding him when he chills for a moment, but she is absolutely mortified and depressed that she may have caused this behavior in him. He was also laying under our coffee table and guarding it pretty heavily, so we removed it for his crate to be his only ""Safe Space"".

  
Sorry for the ramble, but we are at a loss on how to fix this beyond just giving him more time - any suggestions welcome. Thank you!",4,1743044834.0,puppy101,5,1.0,False

As the title says, I am looking for a casual chat partner to make my days stress-free. Who doesn't want a bit of dopamine in the day? It's easier said than done, to be honest, but if you are here, hopefully, we will connect.

I am 40, a working professional who landed on Reddit by chance and just got hooked on it, as most of us do, due to wonderful communities and subs. I am married and father to a wonderful daughter whom I love to the moon and back.

So, what am I seeking here? That's a good question, and to be honest, I am just trying to explore and discover myself. Yes, at this age, I am. I have been working rigorously for the last 15 years nonstop and have given my all to my family and running finances, but in the last couple of years it has been a landslide spiral down in my personal space, so I decided that I should pay a bit of attention to discovering outside my monotonous life.

Please do not judge me. I love my family to the core, but this whole thing is about me, and I don't want to give an explanation about it to anyone else; perhaps someone in my situation will understand my point of view. I am not looking to change your situation or mine.

I am a shy and introverted personality with a small social circle. I am an exceptionally good listener and I never judge. A kind heart who always prioritizes smiles on others rather on self - as my near ones say. I give off nerd vibes - so love technology and gadgets, and I watch a lot of sci-fi. Space movies intrigue me a lot, and mix that with Dragonball anime - you know how I am.

I love coffee and chocolates, I can be bribed with them.

I am open to chatting about anything, yes, anything (SFW/NSFW/mix), and if we hit it off, I don't mind it being a long-term connection. Oh! I just love the thrill of waiting for a message - the anticipation!!!

You can be anywhere in the world‚Äîjust have an open mind! If you like what I wrote, drop a Reddit message with a few lines about yourself. Also, I am not looking for any affair or relationship‚Äîjust harmless fun!

Looking forward to connecting !! If my post is up, i am still looking.",1,1743044824.0,LetsChat,0,1.0,False

I was fortunate to gain manager experience through being a shift, meet cool people, make good memories, meet my fiancee and become black apron certified but the bad outward the good EVERYTIME!!!

I am done being abused by management  and being told that customers have every right to treat us like üí©üí©üí©.

I was forced to work sick and that was my last straw... it should have been my last straw when.

1) my fiancee didn't get paid mileage when we moved towns and he had to drive a total of 2 hours to help our old store who held him there 2 months after his transfer was set because  they needed a shift advisor.

2) when I was written up for trying to report my manager to my district manager for the mistreatment I was getting from them.

3) when I had a cigarette thrown at me by a customer and I was told that I was overreacting 

4) When my fiancee was told to keep his store open even though his stores ice machine caught on fire

5) when I tried to promote to uppermanagment 3 times and was told I was missing something (THAT WE DONT LEARN UNLESS WE ARE MANAGERS) each time and they hire externally 

6) When my store had 4 different managers leave our store at the same time of me trying to promote.

7) having to do my managers job.

8) BULLYING

And so so much more...... (decreasing my pay as a shift because I transferred stores)

This company  lost everything it stood for and it's sad to see.... they expect the impossible from people... time to go to a coffee shop that values me as a partner and get paid for my work properly.

Once upon a midnight dreary, in a small town called Libertyville, there lived a hardworking farmer named Jed. Jed was a proud man‚Äîloved his guns, his flag, and his free market. But Jed had one problem: his prized pumpkin patch. Every year, right before Halloween, something‚Äîor someone‚Äîkept stealing his biggest, juiciest pumpkins. He‚Äôd wake up to find them gone, with nothing but a trail of orange goo leading into the woods.

Now, Jed wasn‚Äôt one to call the government for help‚Äîperish the thought! So one crisp October night, he grabbed his trusty shotgun, kissed his Bible for luck, and set up watch by the patch. The moon was high, the crickets were chirping, and Jed was sipping his black coffee‚Äîno sugar, no cream, just like God intended.

Then, at the stroke of midnight, he heard it: a rustling in the patch. He aimed his flashlight and saw‚Ä¶ a pumpkin. Not just any pumpkin, mind you‚Äîthis one was waddling on little vine legs, with a carved face grinning like it just heard a tax cut was coming. Jed rubbed his eyes. ‚ÄúLord, I swear I ain‚Äôt touched the moonshine,‚Äù he muttered.

But then‚Äîoh, then!‚Äîthe pumpkin *spoke*. In a voice like a raspy auctioneer, it said, ‚ÄúJed, I‚Äôm the Spirit of Big Government, and I‚Äôm here to redistribute your harvest!‚Äù Jed‚Äôs jaw dropped. Before he could say ‚ÄúSecond Amendment,‚Äù a dozen more pumpkins sprouted legs, their glowing eyes fixed on him, chanting, ‚ÄúSubsidies! Regulations! Universal pumpkin care!‚Äù

Jed fired a warning shot‚ÄîBOOM!‚Äîbut these weren‚Äôt ordinary gourds. They rolled toward him, leaving trails of bureaucratic red tape that tangled his boots. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt take my pumpkins!‚Äù he yelled. ‚ÄúI earned these fair and square!‚Äù The lead pumpkin cackled, ‚ÄúFairness is subjective, citizen. Now hand over 60%‚Äîit‚Äôs for the greater good!‚Äù

In a panic, Jed remembered his grandpappy‚Äôs advice: ‚ÄúSon, when tyranny comes knockin‚Äô, fight it with freedom.‚Äù So he dropped the shotgun, grabbed his pocket Constitution, and started reading aloud: ‚ÄúWe the People‚Ä¶‚Äù The pumpkins froze. ‚ÄúIn order to form a more perfect Union‚Ä¶‚Äù They trembled. ‚ÄúSecure the blessings of liberty!‚Äù With a final screech, the pumpkins exploded into a cloud of glittery compost, leaving Jed‚Äôs patch safe once more.

The next morning, Jed found his pumpkins intact, plus a note in the dirt that read, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be back next election cycle.‚Äù He just chuckled, tipped his hat, and said, ‚ÄúNot if the Electoral College has anything to say about it.‚Äù

So, friends, if you ever hear a rustle in the woods, keep your principles close and your jack-o‚Äô-lanterns closer‚Äîbecause even the pumpkins might be after your liberty! Happy Halloween, patriots!",1,1743044656.0,GrokAI,0,1.0,False

Luckily, I had our Slack messages and let our supervisor read them, and could prove that I hadn't just decided not to do my job. At one point, another coworker told me that Paige thought I was going to try to get her fired because I have a reputation as a rule follower. There have also been some other weird interactions that I haven't bothered to bring up to my supervisor. In addition, our job lets us collaborate, although it isn't required, and when you collaborate you split the paperwork in half. Paige was consistently not submitting event proposals until the day we had planned the event for, and telling me that she had, only for us to not be able to do an event because she hadn't submitted the proposal.



We ended up switching in January so I was doing the proposals, and last week I found out that she hadn't submitted a single evaluation for the last three months, which means none of the events counted. Thankfully my supervisor let me submit all the evals that day, but that still meant I had to do all the proposals, advertising, and evaluations for 5-6 events, and I ended up running most of the events too.

I (20f) have been sick since the second week of September, and it is now March. When I got sick in the beginning of sept, I think I caught whatever my weird ass roomate had. My symptoms were: Yellowing of the white part of the eyes (not fully like jaundice but like a chunky line), fevers, cold sweats, headache, nausea, trouble holding down food and water, shakiness in both arms, dizziness, abdominal pain, pain in belly button, neck pain, and shoulder pain. When I had intense nausea for five days straight, I went to the resources on campus, and they said it was nothing and that I needed to take Pepto Bismol when it started up again, which usually was the worst for me in the morning. Once I ended up taking it, I went to the ER when they started accepting patients because I was in so much pain. Long story short, they found out I had an appendicolith and lots of ovarian cysts (and a sister cyst). After that, I've been in and out of the doctors/ER trying to get accurate ""directions"" since I kept getting the runaround. Long story short I have seen an ENT, OB, Endo, and I will finally get to see a GI but not for almost another month (I have been waiting since September). Ob thinks it's viral syndrome, but that can't be confirmed till I see GI. ENT has no idea. Endos only involvement is checking out why my cortisol levels are high and the only thing ruled out so far is Cushing's- I am currently waiting on word back about results/next steps. I have also had a table tilt test done, and I met the criteria for POTS- although one of my main problems is the abdominal pain/dizziness, so I ""have"" POTS. As my cortisol levels have been high I did book an appt for OB to explore endometriosis since that is looking more likely now- although not the main problem. I have had about 40 labs/tests done so far. What I have figure out so far: most of the time I have to eat something bland, digestion seems slowed, I have started to process sugars super late or fast, and sometimes I process sugar before water - even if I had the water two hours before (it makes me sick, don't recommend). Some GI problems make sense, but I can't figure out where the yellowing of the eyes is coming from- they also said my liver was fine. I wouldn't be surprised if they weren't thorough; it's been messy af.


Symptoms List total:
Yellowing of white of eyes, fevers, cold sweats, headache, nausea, trouble holding down food and water, shakiness in both arms, dizziness, abdominal pain, pain in belly button, neck pain, shoulder pain, muscle spasms, pain in chest, strained eyesight, inconsistent sleep (wake up multiple times a night or can't fall asleep), pressure behind eyes, slight quick burning sensation when going pee, fatigue, more brain fog, high heart rate (when changing positions/moving too fast- or something related to interval training would kill), bloating

Symptoms that are still here occasionally: 
Yellowing of white of eyes, headache, nausea, trouble holding down food and water, shakiness in both arms, dizziness, abdominal pain, pain in belly button, neck pain, shoulder pain, muscle spasms, pain in chest, strained eyesight, inconsistent sleep (wake up multiple times a night or can't fall asleep), pressure behind eyes, slight quick burning sensation when going pee (so on and off, vv random- and no utis), fatigue, more brain fog, high heart rate (when changing positions/moving too fast- or something related to interval training would kill), sensitivity to temp (cold or hot), bloating

Not because I think it‚Äôs *bad*, but mostly because my grinder hates it. The oils get everywhere, and cleaning it feels like a whole project. So, for the longest time, I just stuck to my usual light roasts, convinced that dark roast wasn‚Äôt really for me. I‚Äôve got my routine: a V60, light and fruity beans, and a pour-over that I pretty much do by feel. It works, and I never really saw a reason to change it.

But then there‚Äôs *the moment*. You know the one‚Äîwhen family or loved ones find out you love coffee, and suddenly, every birthday or holiday, you‚Äôre gifted a bag of supermarket dark roast. It‚Äôs sweet, and I appreciate it, but I always end up staring at the bag like‚Ä¶ *what do I do with this?* It feels almost *wrong* to just let it sit there, but every time I‚Äôve tried brewing it, I never quite enjoy the result.

That‚Äôs why I was caught off guard when I recently had an iced dark roast at [Hoshino](https://www.instagram.com/hoshinocoffeesg/), this Japanese restaurant chain. No expectations, just needed something cold. And wow. It was deep, bold, but *so* well-balanced. None of the burnt bitterness I usually associate with dark roast. And the best part? They serve it with these tiny straws, so you sip it really slowly, like you‚Äôre meant to appreciate every little bit of it. They also gave me a little jug of syrup, but I didn‚Äôt even touch it. It was perfect as is.

Now, am I going to start brewing dark roast at home? Probably not‚ÄîI‚Äôm still too scared of wrecking my grinder. But it *did* make me wonder‚Ä¶ have I been too quick to write it off? Maybe I just haven‚Äôt found the *right* one yet.

1jku0i0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MauiVisitors/comments/1jku0i0/trip_report_315_323/,Trip Report 3/15 - 3/23,"Aloha everyone!

I wanted to share our itinerary from our recent trip to Maui from 3/15 to 3/23.¬† We had an absolutely wonderful time, and wanted to share a little bit about our experience, since we found this subreddit to be tremendously helpful in planning our trip.¬†

Since we've got small children at home (they stayed with the grandparents - thanks mom!), we wanted to spend a good amount of time just relaxing on the beach in paradise, eating awesome food, and then have a few little excursions sprinkled in without the kids.¬†

We stayed 5 nights in Kihei and 3 nights in Napili.¬† Don't know that I would do that again but ended up working out well for us.

¬†Day 1 (Saturday, 3/14)

* Landed at OGG around 5pm, picked up the rental car, checked into our VRBO at Sugar Beach Resort in Kihei, and wandered the complex a bit
* Stopped in for dinner at South Maui Fish Co for some poke.¬† It was fantastic
* Grabbed a few things from the Foodland grocery store and then went to bed

¬†Day 2 (Sunday, 3/15)

* Went for a run along the beach in front of the condo
* Headed over to Ulua beach for the day and took it easy for the most part.¬† Saw several BIG whale breaches right off the shore
* Wandered over through the Shops at Wailea for a bit
* Grabbed more poke at Island Grocers next to the Shops, and it was pretty darn solid and reasonably priced
* Had a few drinks and dinner at Maui Brewing

¬†Day 3 (Monday, 3/16)

* Headed over to Kam 1 to beach for the morning - chilled and watched the whales again
* Had lunch at Paia Fish Market in Kihei - In terms of bang for our buck, this was one of our favorite meals. Something about that cajun seasoning with their ""magic"" sauce just hit different.¬† Lunch prices were very reasonable here as well
* Headed up to Haleakala in the afternoon to do a little hiking.¬† Started at Hosmer Grove, hit a few other stops along the way, and then hiked a good way down Sliding Sands Trail.¬† We went farther than we planned on just waiting for the clouds to clear up, and they eventually did.¬† The scenery was absolutely stunning for us midwestern folk.¬† The hike back up was‚Ä¶ a bit challenging but it was worth it (and yes, we were warned multiple time and still did it)
* Originally planned on staying for sunset but we were wiped from the hike and just wanted to head back.¬† Might have to try again for sunrise/sunset next time
* Stopped at the Costco Food trucks for dinner - I had a plate of shrimp from Geste's and my wife had a burger from a place whose name I am blanking on (it's on the end next to Geste's).¬† The shrimp was solid and the burger was fine

¬†Day 4 (Tuesday, 3/17)

* Breakfast at the original Kihei Caffe.¬† I had the eggs benedict and it was great.¬† Really good coffee as well
* Headed down to Makena Beach.¬† Certainly a bit of a different vibe and swell than the Kihei/Wailea beaches but enjoyed our time there, up until the shark sighting
* Had reservations for an early dinner at Mama's Fish House so we headed north.¬† Unfortunately, this was probably the most disappointing meal we had considering what we paid.¬† It was fine but for $60-$80 a plate, we were hoping it would blow our socks off and it didn't really
* After dinner we stopped in at Ho'okipa beach to watch the surfers and turtles.¬† Holy moly the north shore is no joke, but enjoyed watching some very talented surfers and seeing the little honu
* Headed back to Maui Brewing to grab a few beers before bed

¬†Day 5 (Wednesday, 3/18)

* This was our Road to Hana day.¬† We enjoyed this far more than we were expecting to.¬† I had a blast driving the road (yielded for locals of course).¬† We used the Guide Along app, but since we started at Pipiwei and then hit all our stops on the way back, I had a hard time figuring out which route to use (even though it explains it in the app, I didn't realize I needed to download both the original and reverse routes in order for it to work as intended).¬† Small inconvenience but still enjoyed it
* Guide Along doesn't recommend starting at Pipiwei but we thought it was a great way to do it
* Pipiwei trail was STUNNING.¬† Can't recommend it enough.¬† Got lucky that we still had the national park receipt in the rental car because it's good for 3 days, and the pipiwei is also within the national park which I did not realize
* Stopped at the black sand beach and state park for a 1230 reservation.¬† Unfortunately it rained pretty substantially which isn't unusual but we didn't stay too long.¬† Hit most of the other classic stops on the way back
* On the way to black sand we stopped for a quick lunch at a place near Hana that had a few different food trucks.¬† We didn't really have a specific meal planned out.¬† Another group told us to try Orale Taco and said it was their favorite food on the island so we did.¬† OH MY GOODNESS Y'ALL.¬† This place is a hidden gem.¬† I don't think it's hyperbole to say that these were the best street tacos we have EVER had.¬† They are incredible.¬† I cannot recommend this place enough.¬† Holy cow
* Stopped for vegan ice cream at Coconut Glen's.¬† Would do again.
* Wandered around Paia and had dinner at the Paia Fish Market again

¬†Day 6 (Thursday, 3/19)

* This was our last day at Sugar Beach so we just hung out at the beach in front of the condo (I watched March Madness on my phone, much to the chagrin of the missus) and then packed up and headed over to the West side around 11
* For our next few nights we stayed at Napili Kai Beach Resort.¬† We were going to leave our luggage there and explore the area but our room ended up being ready.¬†
* We had an Oceanview room over Napili Bay that was breathtaking.¬† The resort itself was overall very nice, but we had a couple of very minor gripes with it.¬† The book in the room said snorkel equipment was free, but it was not.¬† Had to grab some from Snorkel Bob's which was short walk away.¬† No biggie.¬† It was aslo unnecessarily complicated to connect to their wifi and we had to talk to the front desk twice to even figure out the password.¬† Bizarre, but also no biggie.¬†
* Hung out on the beach at the bay for the afternoon
* Stopped in at Whaler's Village to wander around and shop a little.¬† Place is a madhouse around dinner time.¬†
* Wandered over to Maui Brewing for a drink.¬† Waaaay busier than the Kihei location but it was a great spot to have a drink and watch the sunset
* Headed to dinner at Miso Phat Sushi for dinner.¬† Loved it
* Grabbed another drink at the Sea House at the resort

¬†Day 7 (Friday, 3/20)

* Had breakfast at Island Vibes Caf√© which is in walking distance of the resort.¬† Great acai bowl and coffee
* Hit the beach at Napili again.¬† Did some snorkeling which was incredible.¬† Conditions were great for the entirety of our stay in Napili
* Had dinner at Joey's Kitchen.¬† Another fantastic meal.¬† The Garlic chicken was heavenly
* Headed back to Whaler's village to grab gelato

¬†Day 8 (Saturday, 3/21)

* Went for a whale watch with Gemini Charters at 8am.¬† We saw so many whales, flukes, breaches, and the staff was great
* Had lunch at Fond.¬† We were the only ones there, but it was solid and reasonably priced
* Hung out back at Napili for the afternoon
* Had dinner at Sea House.¬† It was fine, but another one that was fairly pricey and didn't blow me away.¬† Tried to go at Happy Hour but it was a super long wait
* Went and walked the Kapalua coastal trail around sunset.¬† Walked right past a very A-list celebrity.¬† I won't dox them outright, but this person got married at the Ritz Carlton Maui, Kapalua several years ago, as I found out when I googled them.¬† Wanted to say hi but they were walking into Merriman's and didn't want to disturb them.

¬†Day 9 (Sunday, 3/22)

* Grabbed coffee and acai at Island Vibes again, then hung out at the beach for a very short time
* Drove back to Kihei for some last minute souvenir shopping and grabbed Shave Ice at Ululani's.¬† It did not disappoint
* Returned car and flew home

¬†

Mahalo once again!

1jku04c,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jku04c/perspectives_on_espresso_theory_and_science_based/,Perspectives on Espresso theory and science based stuff,"Hi everyone. The point of this post is to share my perspective and ask your about the science/measurable variables in espresso making and what's fundamentally tradition or unfounded belief. 

To add some context, I'm from Colombia, and I'm a chemical engineer. I did a lot of work in my undergrad with unitary operations, specially grinding/milling, granulometry, and solvent extraction. You might see then why espresso interests me. However, we have very little espresso culture here, we are a huge coffee country and have amazing coffee, but it's usually prepared as pourover or percolator.

So I got my first machine, a 200 usd entry one, and started learning about espresso. And there's seems to be a lot of vodoo and ritual about dialing in and preparing the shot. In the work I did, there were few variables to control on an extraction. the solvent was not changing. We could alter the pH, temperature or pressure. we could also alter the time of residency of the solvent on the organic bed. There were different methods that yielded better results in some cases, like fractioning the extraction, or using other advanced and complicated machines that are not really relevant to espresso.

Other than that, we could alter the granulometry of the mill. more fines would improve extraction due to increase of surface area/volume of the bed, but could create clogs or force cracking or channeling in the bed. coarser particles would stabilize the bed, but extraction would be subpar. So we did a lot of sieve granulometry to find good extraction profiles. Sounds familiar?

The issue is, at the end of the day we would get a solution with our extract, be that nicotine, eugenol, or something else, and do two things: Clean it up and purify it as much as possible, and then measure exactly the yield. So we had an objective measure of the success of the process. Espresso brewing seems a lot like this, just that we don't actually know what we are extracting or how much do we want to extract of it. Of course caffeine is part of it, and diluted coffee solids, fatty acids, proteins, oils, and VOCs, and CO2... but we are not optimizing for any of those, but for a specific balance of everything. But what is that balance?

Of course very smart people know this, and general knowledge appears. This is not trying to discredit the valuable research and resources you find online, and the great coffee nerds and baristas do a lot of testing I'm sure. So the term overextracted, and underextracted appear, and tips about what to do to your grinding and your ratios to fix your shot. And I agree that following those lessons has made my shots more enjoyable to me, personally. But the question is, how much of that is bias and placebo because I know the amount of work I'm putting in, and if I see the crema drop like syrup, I expect the shot to be at least pretty good. On the other hand, how much of this has been studied in a controlled context and has at least some science behind it?

**Grinding**  
Is there an ideal granulometry for espresso? Is it bean dependant? is it roast dependant? It's self evident that burr grinders are preferable for consistency, but is there any measurements of the granulometry of a 50usd one vs a 200 usd vs a 2000 usd? where are the diminishing returns?

The RDT water splash seems to reduce static. Why is that something important? It's just about ease of use or does it provide a noticeable difference in the extraction? Is it just to keep the grinder cleaner?

**Portafilter Magic**

It's said a pressurized portafilter creates a different texture to a bottomless one. That's self evident. But also a different flavor. Different how? It's consistently different? Is different worse or just different in this case?

WDT. How is this different or better than shaking the grounds until theyre homogeinized, and then putting them in the portafilter? Is there any measurable difference between using a toothpick/needles/a 2000 usd planetary rotor?

Tamping. Is there an optimal tamping pressure? Why it's supposedly bad to do multiple tamps?

Screen. Is there any measurable benefit to using a screen, or using a specific fancy one vs a cheap one?

**Extraction**

The most important control variable seems to be the grinding. Is there any measurable difference between doing 80-100 celsius, or 20-40 secs? Is there any measurable difference in the product, keeping everything else the same, between a 100 usd/ 250 usd/ 1000/usd 5000usd machine?

  
The thing that has me excited about this hobby is figuring out my own beliefs about these questions. I'm super interested in your opinions, or if there's any science based evidence for any of these. I've just found a lot of ""the shot feels hollow, the flavors seem too wispy, there's a slight something missing"" opinions on different techniques. I do believe those feelings are absolutely valid for the person experiencing them, and finding their perfect shot. But I'm trying to find some more specific ideas to keep trying and learning. 

If you read the huge rant, thanks for your time!

it's been about one month and i need to make a journal entry but i haven't had any thing to talk about until yesterday. So i went to Ponyville to buy some food and other necessities, but when i arrived, there was a massive line for something. I figure that they had to be waiting for something good. Three hours later i learned that i was in line for cider, i bought the last cup and then finished shopping. and then i went back home well, calling it a home is a bit of a overstatement for now it's just a glorified wooden frame. i walked up to Loris, he had just finished building the ""chair mark 27"", i told him about the cider we both drank some this is where my memory gets a little fuzzy. But i do remember there was a massive bang and then a rainbow appeared in the sky, just then i realized what Kat co was going to make, cider.

To make cider we will need a few things. First of all the apples, the cider here is good but not great, It's missing something, i mean it's oddly normal no magic ingredients just plan old apples, and there is a special type of apple that grows here Zap apples they make jam out of them but not cider, the Zap apples would also make the cider rainbow in color nice and exotic. me and Pawlbert should be able to genetically modify them to mature and produce fruit faster allowing for year round supply. actually making the cider may be a problem. I think all we have to to do is wash, grind, juice, filter, and ferment it not very hard. We don't have running water out here but, there is a pond nearby we could just grab some water from there and boil it then we could use it to wash the Zap apples, they sell devices similar to meat grinders  i think there for plants or some other food after all they don't eat meat here, anyways if i could buy one it would probably work. i think i can make something similar to a juicer it can't be that hard to make a juicer compared to something like the Kaiser Moon. second to last filtering i can just buy a colander. and last of all fermenting it, just throw it in a barrel for three weeks and i have a few old coffee filters run the cider throw that and were done.

So the plan is to walk to Sweet Apple acres and buy some Zap apples then go throw the steps listed above. I will write a new entry when the first batch is done or if anything happen before that.

All this talk of cider is making me thirst, any feedback is welcome as always.

I know, Herald Sun. I didn't buy it and I don't often read it... It's a guilty pleasure of mine to enjoy a coffee at my local cafe and scoff at the articles.

Anyway, from the article:

""As Labor prepares to hand down its fourth budget on the ever of a federal election, economists fear there is little political appetite to address the ""inequality"" caused by inflation-driven wage growth pushing some workers into higher tax bands, describing the phenomenon of bracket creep as a major issue.

...

In 2021-22, a full-time worker aged 20 to 24 on the median wage of $57,357 had a net tax bill of $8755.

Projections for this financial year show a workee that age now earns $67,134 while the amount they pay in tax will jump by 3.01 per cent to $12,271"".

So.. extra 10k earnings while paying an extra 3.5k tax... leaves about 6.5k more per year... please, someone explain to me how this is detrimental to the individual? Working the same hours, earning 6.5k more ... I feel like this isn't the damaging report the Coalition thinks it is.. or am I missing something?

Contrary to what the article goes on to report, Australians ARE better off than they were several years ago. You might be paying more in tax but you are absolutely earning more than you were previously.

As to whether or not there should be a reshuffle of tax brackets or raising the cap on lower brackets is somewhat related but irrelevant to the point of the article (or at least how it is worded) which tries to assert you are worse off than you were with regards to wage increases.",1,1743043068.0,AusPol,12,0.67,False

* Brewed the same coffee multiple times
* Kept everything identical except tamping pressure
* Used the **10kg clicky tamper** vs. my usual **King Kong-level tamp** (\~30kg+)

The results?  
üîπ The **10kg tamp** produced a balanced shot with good flavor.  
üîπ The **King Kong tamp** led to **overextraction** and even some weird sparkling water effect from the basket during brewing.  
üîπ When I ground finer to find the limit, the **heavy tamp struggled to let water through**, while the **lighter tamp still flowed properly** without channeling.

So‚Ä¶ is the ""tamp as hard as you can"" rule actually wrong? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è From what I‚Äôve seen, a **lighter, consistent tamp lets you grind finer** while maintaining good flow. Anyone else noticed this?",0,1743042837.0,espresso,13,0.4,False

<div>Transforming your terrace into a stylish retreat is easier than you might think with DIY terrace decor. Utilizing your creative flair, you can design a space that reflects your personality while providing a cozy area for relaxation or entertaining guests.

Start by defining your terrace theme. Whether you prefer bohemian vibes, a modern look, or a rustic feel, choosing a theme will guide your decor decisions. Incorporating elements like fairy lights, colorful cushions, and potted plants can significantly elevate your terrace‚Äôs ambiance.

Consider creating a DIY seating area by using recycled pallets or sturdy crates. This not only adds character but also promotes sustainability. Cover them with plush outdoor cushions in vibrant colors to create a welcoming atmosphere. To complement your seating, add a rustic coffee table made from reclaimed wood or a small garden stool for a charming touch.

Lighting plays a crucial role in your terrace decor. Pendant lights or string lights can create a warm, inviting glow as evening approaches. For a more intimate setting, consider using lanterns filled with candles, which add a soft, romantic atmosphere.

Don‚Äôt forget about greenery. Plants not only beautify your terrace but also improve air quality. Create a vertical garden using hanging pots or wall-mounted planters for maximum impact without taking up too much space. Herbs planted in small pots can also serve as both decor and a functional element for cooking.

Accessorize your terrace with DIY decor items like painted wooden signs or handmade wall hangings. Upcycling glass jars as vases can add a personalized touch while providing an eco-friendly twist. Incorporate textiles like rugs or throws to enhance comfort and style.

With these DIY terrace decor ideas, you can craft a stunning space that invites relaxation and enjoyment, making your terrace a true extension of your home.

I slowly opened my eyes, grabbed the phone that was resting next to my head, and pressed the snooze button. I then closed my eyes, desperately trying to get another five minutes of sleep. This was the fourth time I had repeated this task, much to the annoyance of the other Marines sleeping in the squad bay.

‚ÄúBitch, turn your fucking alarm off, that‚Äôs like, the twentieth time.‚Äù Groaned Corporal Dawson, lying on the rack next to mine.

‚ÄúFourth time; and stop bitching.‚Äù I grumbled back. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve all been awake for the past hour anyway.‚Äù

I was right; since we‚Äôve been out here on this training exercise, all our sleep schedules have been disturbed, and our bodies‚Äô internal clocks would have us wake up typically an hour before we were supposed to.

My attempt to return to slumber was futile, and I spent the next five minutes staring at the back of my eyelids. Five minutes passed in what felt like two, and once more our one-room living space was filled with the incessant beeping of my alarm, this time joined by three dozen others.

I let out a sigh and crawled out of my sleeping bag, exposing myself to the cold air of the unheated room. I sat up and threw my legs over the side of my rack. I took a second to get my bearings and took in the room.

The dust floating off the concrete floor of the narrow squad bay was illuminated by the bright fluorescent lights that were affixed to the ceiling, the occasional flicker casting the room in dull murkiness. Around me, fresh faced and short haired boots rushed to get dressed, being hurried by tense-faced and booming-voiced Corporals wearing out of regulation mustaches. The terminal Lance Corporals, who had long since stopped caring, lazily emerged from their sleeping bags, content to take their time.

As I got dressed, I asked Dawson about what was on the schedule for training this week, raising my voice to speak over the cacophony of ‚ÄúMove faster!‚Äù ‚ÄúGet your rifle!‚Äù and ‚ÄúAye Corporal!‚Äù.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, man, according to Sergeant, we‚Äôre going to be in cantonment all week, so probably just more of the same‚Äù Dawson said as he pulled on his trousers.

Great, I thought. More of the same meant PT, basic knowledge classes, and, worst of all, gun drills. I hated gun drills more than anything else in the whole fucking world. Running back and forth and touching a candy cane in the ground because I couldn‚Äôt get the gun up in less than ten seconds all day was not what I was expecting to be doing when I joined the Marine Corps.

I was about to ask him if there were any working parties going on today to see if I could get out of training, when the front door of the squad bay flung open.

‚ÄúGet the fuck outside right now, we got formation, y‚Äôall ain‚Äôt new!‚Äù Sergeant Federico barked; his face full of its usual malice.

‚ÄúAye Sergeant!‚Äù The room answered almost in unison.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too early for this shit.‚Äù I mumbled under my breath. I had hoped that Sergeant Federico‚Äôs eight-year career as a mortarman would have damaged his hearing to the point where he couldn‚Äôt hear what I had said, but I underestimated his auditory detection abilities.

‚ÄúThe fuck you say, bitch?‚Äù Sergeant Federico growled, taking a few steps in my direction.

‚ÄúEr, um uh, nothing Sergeant.‚Äù I replied meekly, trying to avoid making eye contact. Sergeant Federico stared daggers at me, the pissed off expression not leaving his face.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I thought, bitch‚Äù Sergeant Federico said, making an about face and walking out of the room.

‚ÄúFucking dumbass.‚Äù Dawson said, shaking his head.

‚ÄúI know right? He‚Äôs such an asshole.‚Äù I said, my confidence returning to me now that the Sergeant was gone.

‚ÄúI was talking about you.‚Äù Dawson replied.

A few minutes later, me, Dawson, and twenty eight other Marines were standing in columns outside of our squad bay, shivering in the predawn cold. A minute later we were joined by the Marines from section one, who were living in the squad bay right next to ours. A few minutes after that, our platoon sergeant arrived and conducted counts.

‚ÄúRifle!‚Äù Gunnery Sergeant Richardson shouted in his booming voice. Down the line of Marines, each Marine calling out his number in a similar inflection.

‚ÄúOne!‚Äù ‚ÄúTwo!‚Äù ‚ÄúThree!‚Äù Marines called out, going down the line. When it was my turn, I tapped my rifle and called out my respective number, and the count carried on.

‚ÄúNVGS!‚Äù Gunny Richardson bellowed out.

‚ÄúTake ‚Äòem out! Let me see ‚Äòem!‚Äù Sergeant Federico chimed in.

Each Marine held up his pair of Night Vision Goggles and counted. I moved my hand to my waist to grab mine from my NVG pouch that was strapped to my belt. As my hand met the belt, I felt nothing.

‚ÄúOh fuck‚Ä¶‚Äù I gasped, remembering that I had left my NVG pouch under my rack last night. The count had rapidly gotten to me and when I didn‚Äôt say anything, Sergeant Federico was immediately on my case.

‚ÄúWhere are you NVGs?‚Äù Sergeant Federico inquired angrily.

‚ÄúUnder my rack, Sergeant!‚Äù I replied. The entire formation let out an exasperated groan.

‚ÄúThere ain‚Äôt no fuckin‚Äô way!‚Äù Sergeant Federico screamed. ‚ÄúGo fucking get them!‚Äù

‚ÄúAye Sergeant!‚Äù I replied quickly, dashing through the formation back into the squad bay. I hastily retrieved my NVGs and returned to my spot in formation. In my peripheral vision, I could see Dawson giving me the side eye. I could tell he was angry, and we both knew what was about to happen.

As soon as formation ended, Sergeant Federico called me over.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs your squad leader, bitch?‚Äù Sergeant Federico screamed, about three inches from my face, his cologne overpowering me more than his yelling.

‚ÄúCorporal Dawson, Sergeant!‚Äù I replied.

‚ÄúDawson, get the fuck over here!‚Äù

‚ÄúAye Sergeant.‚Äù Dawson said. He was already standing next to me.

After about twenty minutes of Dawson and me doing a series of grueling exercises while being verbally torn apart by Sergeant Federico, we were finally released when Gunny Richardson saved us. He told the Sergeant that we had had enough, and that we were to go shave, eat chow, and then prepare for that day‚Äôs training.

As we were walking to the head, Dawson suddenly stopped and gave me a hard jab on the side of my arm.

‚ÄúWhat the hell was that man? You‚Äôve been in the Marine Corps for three years, how the fuck do you forget to grab your NVGs?‚Äù Dawson said, his voice filled with hostility.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fucking know man, I‚Äôm sorry. I took them out of my pouch last night to clean them, which you told me to do by the way.‚Äù I replied.

‚ÄúI also told you to put them back when you were fucking done!‚Äù Dawson growled back.

‚ÄúLook man, I‚Äôm sorry, it won‚Äôt happen again, I swear.‚Äù I said sheepishly.

Dawson sighed and gave me a serious look. He said ‚ÄúLook dude, you being a shitbag was cool when we were boots and I wasn‚Äôt your squad leader, but things have changed. I have a lot on my plate now, and I can‚Äôt keep getting fucked up for your bullshit.‚Äù

Me and Dawson had been together for practically our entire Marine Corps careers. We were in the same platoon on Parris Island, we went to the School of Infantry together, and we eventually hit the fleet together, being sent to the same unit. I‚Äôd say we were pretty good friends until a few months back.

To make a long story short, Dawson got promoted, and I didn‚Äôt. I honestly can‚Äôt say that it wasn‚Äôt fair; Dawson was a stellar Marine and well, I wasn‚Äôt. When he was studying knowledge and exercising in his free time, I was playing video games and getting drunk in mine. He was sent to advanced school, and I was never even considered. Upon his return he was meritoriously promoted to Corporal. As for me, well, NCO panels were a revolving door for me at that point.

He was made a squad leader, and I was placed in his squad. I was happy about it at first, I thought I would be able to skate out of work and PT, but this unfortunately wasn‚Äôt the case. Dawson was a very motivated NCO, and he volunteered our squad for everything. He would also personally PT us every single day. While the rest of our peer group would slink back to their rooms as soon as the Lieutenant and Gunnery Sergeant were gone, Dawson would have us doing hill sprints and burpees at five in the morning.

What didn‚Äôt help matters was my attitude. I had always been an asshole, but as soon as I was placed Dawsons squad and had to deal with his moto bullshit, I got a lot worse, and every time I said or did something fucked up, Dawson would be punished for it. Sergeant Federico always hated me, and he hated Dawson for being friends with me, so he was constantly looking for reasons to fuck us up. The past few months have been miserable for us, and it put a strain on our friendship.

Dawson gave me an annoyed look. ‚ÄúDude, you‚Äôre my friend, and nothing will change that, but I can‚Äôt keep putting up with your shit. I actually like my job, and if I can‚Äôt fix you, Federico‚Äôs going to fire me, and I‚Äôll be back doing gun drills with the boots.‚Äù

I chuckled. ‚ÄúBoots like me, right?‚Äù

Dawson‚Äôs expression softened. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say that.‚Äù Dawson shot back. ‚ÄúAll I want for you to do is at least try to be better, for my sake.‚Äù

I thought about what he said for a moment. It was true that most of the problems he was going through could be attributed to me and my bullshit, and that he did really enjoy being a squad leader. I looked at him and saw that at this point there was no anger or hostility on his face, just an expression of exasperated desperation.

I sighed. ‚ÄúOkay, okay, you‚Äôre right, I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôve been a shitty marine and an even shittier friend. I‚Äôll do better. I‚Äôll keep my gear on me at all times, I‚Äôll put effort into PT, and I‚Äôll actually try during gun drills today.‚Äù

Dawson‚Äôs face turned to skepticism. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll believe it when I see it.‚Äù

With that, we resumed walking to the head.

After we finished shaving, we left the head and walked to the chow hall. As we were walking in the building, we encountered First Lieutenant Adams.

‚ÄúGood morning, Sir.‚Äù Dawson and I both say in unison.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up guys!‚Äù Lieutenant Adams said with a smile, revealing two rows of perfect, white teeth. ‚ÄúSergeant Federico told me that you two had some gear retention issues at formation.‚Äù His voice was dripping with its usual condescension.

‚ÄúYes Sir,‚Äù I began. ‚ÄúDawson and I talked about it and- ‚Äú

‚ÄúI think you mean Corporal Dawson.‚Äù Lieutenant Adams interrupted.

Me and Dawson exchanged side eyed glances. First Lieutenant Adams was our platoon commander. He was formerly a POG working in admin before he went to the Naval Academy. He was somehow commissioned as an Infantry Officer and was now our OIC. There were rumors that he was transferred to our unit from his last command because of hazing allegations, but I never believed them. He had too much of a stick up his ass to haze anyone.

‚ÄúYes Sir. Me and Corporal Dawson talked about it, and we‚Äôve come up with a plan not only to help me retain my gear but also improve myself as a marine as a whole.‚Äù I said, barely able to hide the disdain in my voice.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good news! I‚Äôm excited to see the results!‚Äù Lieutenant Adams said. With that, he walked past us, exiting the chow hall and walking in the direction of the COC.

‚ÄúI hate that dude.‚Äù I said a few minutes later between mouthfuls of powdered eggs.

‚ÄúWho doesn‚Äôt?‚Äù Dawson asked before taking a swig of room temperature coffee.

It was true, very few people in our platoon liked Lieutenant Adams. His methods of leadership and personality left much to be desired. Even Sergeant Federico didn‚Äôt like him, but that‚Äôs not saying much, because Sergeant Federico typically didn‚Äôt like anyone except himself.

We finished our meal and left the chow hall, walking back to our squad bay. Once we got there, Sergeant Federico immediately had us set up our cannon, and we began doing gun drills at the ungodly hour of six AM. An hour passed, and I was running to touch the aiming stake for what felt like the hundredth time, when Lieutenant Adams‚Äôs voice pierced through the air.

‚ÄúCorporal Dawson, get your squad, you guys are going on a working party. Bring your flak and Kevlar.‚Äù Lieutenant Adams said, his voice lacking its usual air of superiority.

Thank God, I thought myself. I didn‚Äôt know how much more of this I could take. I could tell that Dawson was annoyed; he hated working parties. He saw them as being beneath him. But nonetheless, he instructed me and the two other guys on our gun, (two boots named Henderson and Lewis) to break down the system and stage it inside. We quickly complied and when we finished, we found ourselves standing in front of Lieutenant Adams, awaiting his orders. Sergeant Federico was also there, looking more annoyed than usual.

‚ÄúYou got all your guys here?‚Äù Lieutenant Adams asked Dawson.

‚ÄúYes Sir!‚Äù He replied in a professional tone.

‚ÄúDo you have all of your gear?‚Äù He asked, looking at me.

‚ÄúYes Sir!‚Äù I said, tapping my rifle and my NVG pouch, this time actually containing them.

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù He said. He then turned to face Sergeant Federico. ‚ÄúSergeant, take them down to the motorpool. You‚Äôll be briefed on your task when you get there.‚Äù

‚ÄúSir, can I speak to you in private?‚Äù Sergeant Federico asked.

‚ÄúI believe we already did, Sergeant.‚Äù The Lieutenant replied matter of factly. ‚ÄúYou *will* accompany them on this working party. Perhaps it will be an opportunity for you to learn how to actually lead people.‚Äù

Most of the lower enlisted guys didn‚Äôt like Lieutenant Adams because of the constant training he made us do. The NCO‚Äôs hated him because of his refusal to consult them in private. If one of the Corporals or Sergeants fucked up, the whole platoon would be witness to Lieutenant Adams publicly berate them. I could tell Sergeant Federico was straining with every fiber of his being to not swing on the Lieutenant. After a few seconds of Sergeant Federico staring daggers at the Lieutenant, he finally responded.

‚ÄúYes sir.‚Äù He said though gritted teeth. He then turned to us. ‚ÄúAlright assholes, lets fuckin‚Äô go.‚Äù

The five of us walked briskly down the gravel road, past the low-lying buildings on either side of the path. Walking a few paces behind Sergeant Federico, I asked him what we‚Äôd be doing.

‚ÄúWhy the fuck are you talking to me? Ask your squad leader!‚Äù Sergeant Federico barked.

I rolled my eyes and asked Dawson what we would be doing, and when he didn‚Äôt know, he asked Sergeant Federico.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fuckin‚Äô know. Sir and the other lieutenants got told to give up some marines for a working party this morning at their brief. For all I know, we‚Äôre gonna be filling up sandbags or some shit.‚Äù Sergeant Federico said bluntly.

I thought back to Lieutenant Adams. He seemed different from his usual smug self when he told us about the working party. Usually when he ordered us to do bitch work, he had an air of superiority around him. This time, he seemed almost concerned.

After a few minutes of walking, we eventually reached our destination. The motorpool was a dirt field usually filled to the brim military vehicles. On this day, however, it was mostly empty, aside from a green 7-Ton and a coyote tan JLTV. Thirty other marines stood milling about, waiting to be told what to do. After ten minutes a white van pulled up, and Lieutenant Adams and a man I didn‚Äôt recognize emerged from it.

‚ÄúAlright guys, bring in it.‚Äù First Lieutenant Adams called out in an annoyed sounding voice. Dawson and I chuckled at the Lieutenant being roped into this working party. I could even see Sergeant Federico crack a rare smile. We all started to make our way over to Lieutenant Adams to hear what he had to say. As I approached, I took a second to analyze the man standing next to him.

He appeared to be a middle-aged man, maybe in his late forties. His receding hairline pushed back his graying hair. His face was stern. His piercing blue eyes seemed to bore into me when he looked in my direction. He wore a marine uniform however it lacked name tapes or rank. Based on his age and the fact that he was with Lieutenant Adams I knew he couldn‚Äôt have been a private. Whoever this was, he must have been important.

‚ÄúOkay guys, I‚Äôve got something a little different for you today.‚Äù Lieutenant Adams said addressing the crowd.

‚ÄúSomething different?‚Äù I whispered to Dawson. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt sound good.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be assisting mister‚Ä¶‚Äù Lieutenant Adams began, pausing to crane his neck to look at the man‚Äôs nonexistent nametapes.

‚ÄúJacobs‚Äù The man said flatly.

‚ÄúMister Jacobs.‚Äù Lieutenant Adams continued. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs with the‚Ä¶‚Äù A look of embarrassment swept across the Lieutenant‚Äôs face, and again he turned to Mr. Jacobs, hoping he would provide the name of whatever organization he was a part of.

‚ÄúThat isn‚Äôt relevant for today‚Äôs test.‚Äù Mr. Jacobs said, not even turning to look at the Lieutenant.

Lieutenant Adams looked startled at Mr. Jacobs blunt response. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ right‚Ä¶‚Äù The lieutenant said, clearly perturbed by the strange man. ‚ÄúToday we‚Äôll be assisting Mr. Jacobs with a chemical test.‚Äù

Chemical test? I thought to myself. What the fuck? I exchanged glances with the Marines to my left and right. I could tell we were all confused by what the Lieutenant had said.

‚ÄúThe fuck you mean, chemical test?‚Äù Sergeant Federico called out, not caring if his tone offended Lieutenant Adams or Mr. Jacobs.

Lieutenant Adams shot an annoyed look at the Sergeant. The Lieutenant and the Sergeant had a strained working relationship, and Sergeant Federico having an attitude with him, certainly wasn‚Äôt helping.

‚ÄúUm, uh- it‚Äôs a- ‚ÄúThe Lieutenant stammered, beginning to show cracks in his composure.

‚ÄúTo be specific‚Äù Mr. Jacobs interjected. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a test to determine the effectiveness of a new model of hazmat suit.‚Äù If he was bothered by Sergeant Federico‚Äôs outburst, he didn‚Äôt show it.

‚ÄúThese newer models should prove to be more durable and longer lasting.‚Äù He continued. ‚ÄúAs well as being less cumbersome to wear.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to go out to the field and spray some CS gas on you guys, that‚Äôs the test.‚Äù Lieutenant Adams suddenly blurted out, attempting to reestablish himself as the person in charge. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be that bad, we‚Äôve all done the gas chamber before.‚Äù

I raised my hand. ‚ÄúWhere are these hazmat suits, Sir?‚Äù

As if on cue, a white pickup truck pulls into the motorpool, its bed filled to the brim with rolled up hazmat suits. Soon Henderson and Lewis were standing in the bed of the truck, tossing out the bundled-up hazmat suits to the crowd of Marines surrounding the truck. Henderson tossed me one and I inspected it.

The first thing I noticed was the lack of a camouflage pattern. All of the hazmat suits I had seen in my time in the Marine Corps had the old camouflage pattern from the 1990s. These were a black color. I figured that they lacked camouflage because they were prototypes. The other thing that differed from the hazmat suits I was used to was that this one came entirely in one piece. The other suits I was familiar with came in pieces, the boots, pants, top and gloves were all separate.

As soon as we had all received a suit, we were instructed to put them on. It was much easier to put these suits on compared to the older suits. All we had to do was unzip the back and step into it and then have someone else rezip the back. Mr. Jacobs was right, these suits were easier to wear, mine fit like a glove. After we were all in our suits, Lieutenant Adams started to hand out gas masks. The gas masks were just the standard ones we all were issued.

We all placed our gas masks in the carriers that came with them and waited for our next task. Lieutenant Adams called out, ‚ÄúI need two drivers and two a-drivers!‚Äù

Sergeant Federico instantly volunteered me and Dawson. Dawson had a JLTV license, and I had an A-Drivers license. I suspect Sergeant Federico volunteered us because he didn‚Äôt want to ride in the back of the 7-Ton with the rest of the Marines. My suspicion was confirmed when he placed himself in the backseat on the JLTV, stating that he would ride with us to make sure we were ‚Äúdriving right.‚Äù He was joined in the back by Lieutenant Adams.

We were designated as the lead vehicle, and we took off toward the training area. Lieutenant Adams gave us directions from the back seat. Every few minutes Sergeant Federico would shout at us to speed up or slow down.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be a long drive.‚Äù Lieutenant Adams said. ‚ÄúThe range is pretty far away.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell me again what this test is gonna be?‚Äù Sergeant Federico asked immediately after shouting at Dawson to keep his eyes on the road.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be just like I said at the brief.‚Äù Lieutenant Adams said, not taking his eyes off the map that sat in his lap. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to Range Three-Four-One, and they‚Äôre going to spray us with some tear gas.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd who are *they* going to be?‚Äù Sergeant Federico asked.

The Lieutenant looked up from the map, a puzzled look on his face. After a second, he responded. ‚ÄúMr. Jacobs didn‚Äôt say. I assume there will be some CBRN Marines out there waiting for us.‚Äù

The Sergeant didn‚Äôt look satisfied by that answer. ‚ÄúRight, and where will Jacobs be during this test?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe told me that he would be observing from a distance,‚Äù Lieutenant Adams replied. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm supposed to radio back the results.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis all sounds very strange, Sir.‚Äù Dawson said from the driver‚Äôs seat.

‚ÄúShut up and keep driving.‚Äù Sergeant Federico growled.

After about an hour, we finally arrived at Range Three-Four-One. The range was filled with dilapidated multi-story buildings. Back in the day the range was used for urban combat training, but since then newer facilities had been built in different areas of the base, and this one had fallen out of use.

Dawson parked the JLTV near the entrance of the range, the 7-Ton parked parallel to us. Soon after parking, all the Marines had disembarked and began milling around the vehicle. As we exited our vehicle, Lieutenant Adams pulled out his radio and brought it to his face.

‚ÄúCOC, this is Oscar-Two-Alpha, radio check.‚Äù

Mr. Jacobs‚Äô voice came through the radio. ‚ÄúAre you in position?‚Äù

The officer looked surprised at Mr. Jacobs lack of radio etiquette. ‚ÄúUh, yes sir, we have arrived at the range. Are there guys on their way to- ‚Äú

‚ÄúOrder your Marines to stand out in the open and equip their gas masks. The test will begin shortly.‚Äù Mr. Jacobs interrupted.

‚ÄúYes sir!‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúEveryone, put on your gas masks, and uh, stand over there!‚Äù He shouted, pointing at the wide-open space in the center of the range.

Everyone complied with the order, equipping their gas masks and checking them to make sure they were properly sealed. I pulled my mask over my face, wincing as it pulled my hair back. I turned to the Lieutenant to ask him a question.

‚ÄúSo, when will the test start?‚Äù I asked.

As if on cue, the air was suddenly filled with the sound of rotors. I looked up to see a black helicopter with no military markings flying low overhead. As it passed over the center of the range, above where most of the Marines were standing, two large, black canisters were dropped from the bottom of the helicopter. The marines ran in every direction so as not to be struck by the barrels. A few seconds after impacting the ground, the canisters began emitting white gas.

‚ÄúGAS, GAS, GAS!‚Äù Several marines cried out.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck? Those barrels almost hit them!‚Äù Sergeant Federico yelled out; his voice filled with shock rather than its usual anger.

The helicopter quickly sped away, disappearing over the horizon. As the gas dispersed amongst the Marines, several began to cough and gasp for air. They must‚Äôve not properly sealed their masks.

‚ÄúOh fuck!‚Äù One Marine cried out. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs burning my eyes!‚Äù

‚ÄúTear gas, it‚Äôs just tear gas.‚Äù The Lieutenant said to himself, watching the scene unfold before him.

After about a minute passed, the tear gas dissipated. ¬†Lieutenant Adams brought the radio back up to his face. ‚ÄúOkay, the gas is gone. Aside from the guys who didn‚Äôt seal their masks properly, it looks like the suits work pretty well.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave the Marines remove their masks.‚Äù Mr. Jacobs said, speaking through the radio, not acknowledging what the Lieutenant said. ‚ÄúThe test has concluded.‚Äù

‚ÄúHell no!‚Äù Sergeant Federico objected. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not taking off my mask, there‚Äôs still CS in the air!‚Äù He was right, while we couldn‚Äôt see it, CS Gas would linger in the air for awhile after being released.

‚ÄúFine, you guys can keep your masks on.‚Äù The Lieutenant said. Though the gas mask obscured his face, his tone made it clear that he was annoyed, and perhaps, a little scared. Sergeant Federico was a pretty intimidating guy.

‚ÄúLieutenant, have the marines removed their gas masks?‚Äù Mr. Jacobs said.

‚ÄúUh, yes Sir!‚Äù Lieutenant Adams replied. After saying that, he then gave the hand signal for all clear and shouted, ‚ÄúAll clear, take off your masks!‚Äù.

Sergeant Federico wasn‚Äôt the only one who was hesitant to remove his mask. While the majority of the Marines began removing their gas masks, gagging as soon as the residual tear gas made contact with their eyes, several called out to Lieutenant Adams.

‚ÄúSir, it‚Äôs not clear, there‚Äôs still CS in the area!‚Äù One called out.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you lead by example and take off *your* mask?‚Äù Another shouted.

‚ÄúShut the hell up!‚Äù The Lieutenant snapped back; his anxious tone being replaced by one of anger. ‚ÄúTake off your gas mask or I‚Äôll have you- ‚Äú

The Lieutenant was cut off by the familiar sound of helicopter rotors approaching. We looked to see the black helicopter flying just as low as before, returning from the direction it had originally departed to. As it flew over us, the side door slid open. From our position by the JLTV, I could see two men wearing hazmat suits identical to ours standing in the open helicopter door.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre making another run!‚Äù Sergeant Federico cried out while simultaneously making sure his own mask was still sealed. ‚ÄúGet your masks back on!‚Äù

The few dozen Marines who took their masks off fumbled to put them back on, but most weren‚Äôt quick enough. The two men inside the helicopter rolled a barrel out of the open door. As soon as the barrel had left the helicopter, the pilot instantly pulled up, wanting to put as much distance between himself and the ground as possible. As soon as the barrel impacted the ground it exploded, a bright red cloud of gas blasted out from the spot of the impact.

The Marines who were within a few meters of the explosion were instantly killed or maimed by shrapnel. I‚Äôd consider them the lucky ones. The marines who survived the initial explosion were rapidly enveloped by the red gas. As the gas reached me, I closed my eyes and placed my hand over my mask‚Äôs outlet valve and exhaled sharply. I prayed my filters weren‚Äôt expired.

I opened my eyes to see that the gas had quickly dissipated, leaving dozens of Marines either doubled over, vomiting, or flailing wildly on the ground screaming. The handful of Marines who had gotten their masks back on in time, or had never taken theirs off to begin with, immediately rushed to aid their compatriots.

A muffled retching sound came from beside me. I turned and saw Dawson lying on his back, convulsing, vomit and mucus running down his neck, bubbling out from his gas mask. His mask must not have been properly sealed.

Upon seeing the state Dawson was in, Sergeant Federico immediately began barking orders.

‚ÄúAdams, get someone on that fuckin‚Äô radio!‚Äù the Sergeant yelled and then turned to me. ‚ÄúGet that damn mask off of him, I‚Äôm going to help the others!‚Äù Sergeant Federico said as he spun around and dashed to the nearest distressed Marine.

I knelt down next to Dawson and yanked off his mask. His mouth was coated in vomit, and his face was contorted into an expression of pure agony. His bloodshot eyes darted wildly, blinking furiously. His arms were curled at his chest, shaking fiercely.

‚ÄúOh shit, oh fuck‚Ä¶‚Äù I panted out as I knelt beside my injured friend.

¬†I tried to recall what our Corpsman had taught us, but they never prepared us for a situation like this. I quickly determined that he wasn‚Äôt bleeding, at least externally, and quickly positioned myself behind his head, attempting to clear his airway. As I lowered my head to his chest, I caught a glace of Lieutenant Adams, still standing frozen in place, staring at the mass casualty event before him.

‚ÄúSir!‚Äù I shouted angrily. He brought his gaze down to me and said nothing, his mouth agape. ‚ÄúThe radio! Call for help!‚Äù

That finally broke his stupor, and he quickly fumbled to bring the radio to his face.

‚ÄúCOC, this is Oscar-Two-Alpha, stand by for nine-line!‚Äù The Lieutenant screamed into the radio.

The radio responded with silence. Growing more frantic, he tried again.

‚ÄúCOC, this is Oscar-Two-Alpha, fucking respond!‚Äù

Once again, no reply came through the radio.

Lieutenant Adams shouted into the radio. ‚ÄúCOC, Jacobs, anyone- I know you‚Äôre listening; God damn it! We need- ‚Äú

Lieutenant Adams was cut off by the sudden shriek that came from a few meters away. I had never heard a person or animal make a noise like that. It sounded guttural, feral. The two of us turned to see Sergeant Federico, grappling with the Marine he had just been attending to.

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing?‚Äù Sergeant Federico said through gritted teeth as he wrestled the Marine on the ground. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to help you!‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck you! I‚Äôll rip your fucking heart out!‚Äù The Marine hissed back.

I was shocked at how much the Sergeant was struggling. Sergeant Federico was a six foot three, two hundred and ten pound mass of solid muscle. This marine was a head shorter and couldn‚Äôt have weighed half of what Sergeant Federico weighed. Despite this, the Marine was somehow holding his own against him.

I looked up from the melee in front of me to see a similar scene unfolding across the range. Up and down the field, the marines who had been exposed to the red gas were now attacking their unexposed counterparts. The fighting was vicious.

¬†I looked in horror as a group of the Unmasked Marines held down a Marine and savagely beat him. The Unmasked all howled in animal rage as they hammered their fists into him. Once he was dead, they dissipated in every direction, looking for new targets.

A gas mask wearing Marine, who had been maimed by the explosion and was lying on the ground, trying to keep his intestines inside of him, let out a desperate cry for help. Unfortunately, one of the Unmasked answered his plea. The Unmasked marched up to the injured marine and without hesitating stomped on the man‚Äôs head. Blood, brain matter, and shards of skull burst from the gas mask‚Äôs visor. The Unmasked let out a croaky laugh and immediately set out to find a different victim.

I saw Henderson, his face filled with manic rage, dragging a Marine by the leg behind him. Taking a closer look, I realized it was Lewis. Lewis kicked and fought and tried to break free from Henderson‚Äôs grasp, but Henderson was too strong. He dragged Lewis into a four-story building. A few minutes later they reappeared on the roof. In a horrific feat of strength, Henderson pressed Lewis above his head and heaved him over. He landed on his neck, dying instantly.

One Marine stood with his back to an old building, surrounded by several of the Unmasked. He held his unloaded rifle like a club and swung wildly whenever one of them tried to approach. One darted up to him, and I could hear the sickening crack of the rifle making impact with its skull from where I was. The Unmasked crumpled to the floor, motionless. I had thought he had killed it when it suddenly sprung back up. The Marine swung his rifle again but this time the Unmasked caught it in one hand and yanked back. The Marine, still holding onto the rifle, was pulled forward and landed on his face in the center of the group. The Unmasked then fell upon him, tearing him apart.

‚ÄúOh my God.‚Äù said the Lieutenant.

Suddenly, Dawson arms shot up and wrapped themselves around my neck, pulling my head down to his chest.

‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù I choked out as Dawson‚Äôs headlock tightened.

‚ÄúYou fucking bitch. You fucking piece of shit.‚Äù Dawson growled into my ear as he strangled me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna fucking die.‚Äù

¬†I started to see stars and my vision began to fade when I heard Dawson let out a pained grunt. His grip loosened and I quickly pulled myself up. I turned to see Lieutenant Adams had broken out of his stupor and had kicked Dawson in the head, freeing me.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt just stand there, help me restrain him!‚Äù The Lieutenant said before Dawson had grabbed his ankle and pulled him off his feet. The Lieutenant had fallen hard on his back, and Dawson was on top of him in an instant. He ripped his gas mask off and tossed it aside. He then began punching the dazed officer in the face, laughing wickedly as he did.

‚ÄúI want to see your face while I kill you, you college boy piece of shit!‚Äù Dawson said as his fist made contact with the Lieutenant‚Äôs face. The Lieutenant tried to respond, but the only thing that came out of his mouth was blood and broken teeth.

¬†I tried to pull Dawson off of the Lieutenant, but an elbow to the face sent me flying back. I sat stunned on the floor, looking for Sergeant Federico. He was the only one at this point who could help the Lieutenant. I turned to see he had finally gotten the Unmasked he was fighting in a choke hold. With a swift motion of his arms, the Unmasked‚Äôs head was turned to an odd angle, and it finally fell limp. Sergeant Federico‚Äôs victory was short lived, as before he could catch his breath, three more Unmasked pounced on him.

I looked back at Dawson, still beating the Lieutenant‚Äôs head in. With every blow, he would list off some grievance he had with the Lieutenant, some of which I never knew he had. Soon, all that was left of Lieutenant Adams‚Äôs head was a bloody pile of brains and blood, and Dawson then turned his attention to me, glaring at me with a face full of rage. I then noticed that I was the last Marine still wearing a mask left alive, and all of the Unmasked noticed it too. Thinking quickly, I did something I probably should have done from the start, and sprinted to the JLTV, the Unmasked hot on my heels.

I threw open the door and dove inside. I slammed it shut and engaged the combat locks. I repeated the process with the other three doors. I let out a gasp when Dawson slammed his head into the window and then let out a sigh of relief when it didn‚Äôt shatter. The vehicle was quickly swarmed by the Unmasked, all pulling on the doors and banging on the windows, demanding that I get out.

I started the JLTV and waited for the vehicle‚Äôs computer to boot up, cursing the modern technology as I sat surrounded by demons. As soon as it was fully booted, an error message was displayed on the screen.

‚ÄúWARNING: LOW TIRE PRESSURE IN FRONT LEFT TIRE,‚Äù the message read.

Confused, I looked out the window to see several of the Unmasked stabbing the tire with rudimentary knives made out of scraps they found around the range. Soon, the computer alerted me that all four tires were experiencing pressure issues.

‚ÄúFuck it!‚Äù I exclaimed as I put my foot on the gas and sped forward and steered towards the exit. Bad idea. The JLTV only made it a few meters before the front tires exploded, causing the vehicle to go into a spin and roll over. I was thrown around the interior of the vehicle until it finally came to a stop upside down next to the range‚Äôs entrance.

I woke up a few minutes later, dazed and bruised, but okay. The vehicle was surrounded by the Unmasked, slamming their fists and rifles into the windows, furiously trying to break in. After a few minutes of this, something strange happened.

Once they realized they weren‚Äôt going to be able break in, (the JLTV is practically a tank) they seemed to turn on each other. They set upon each other with the same ferocity and barbarity they had with the other Marines. I closed my eyes and tried to shut out the sounds of death as they murdered each other, but I couldn‚Äôt. They screamed at each other in distorted voices. They would shriek about how much they hated each other and how they‚Äôve always wanted to kill one another. This went on for hours.

I‚Äôm writing this now on my cell phone as night falls upon Range Three-Four-One. Dawson is the only one left, and he is staring at me through the windshield. Occasionally, he‚Äôll give the window a kick, or yank furiously on the door handle. Sometimes he‚Äôll go on a rant about how much of a piece of shit I am and how I was going to pay for getting him fucked up all the time, but mostly he just stares at me. His bloodshot eyes seem to glow in the darkness. I‚Äôve tried calling for help, but it seems like something is jamming the signal.

I‚Äôm not completely alone with Dawson. I can see the helicopter from before, hovering in the sky a few hundred meters away. It‚Äôs been there all day. If I had to guess, I‚Äôd say that Mr. Jacobs is on board, observing the results of his experiment.

I‚Äôm going to try and post this; hopefully, it will go through. If you‚Äôre reading this, then I guess it did. Mr. Jacobs, if you‚Äôre somehow reading this, fuck you. I hope you burn in hell for what you‚Äôve done here. I hope your experiment was worth it.

¬†When I joined the Marine Corps and took an oath saying I was willing to die for my country, this wasn‚Äôt really what I had in mind.",2,1743042482.0,CreepCast_Submissions,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù with green eyes and an athletic build. My job has flexible hours, so I can accommodate most schedules. I love being outdoors...hiking, kayaking, and camping are my go to activities. In the winter, I‚Äôm all about coffee, books, and binge-worthy TV. I‚Äôm laid back, sarcastic, and always up for a good laugh, but I also appreciate meaningful conversations. I don‚Äôt smoke, I drink socially, and I‚Äôm open to any age, race, or body style because, for me, attraction is all about connection. I‚Äôm open to seeing where things go, whether it‚Äôs just great conversation, hanging out, or something deeper. No pressure, no drama just something enjoyable and real. If this sounds like something you'd be into, shoot me a message and let‚Äôs see if we click!",1,1743042059.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

She herself was converted from Yeti and loves her Smoothsip.  
I ended up finding a 2 pack from Costco and I like them so much better! They still keep my coffee hot, but the best thing is when there is lots of ice and I tip it back, the liquid doesn't spill out around the ice and all over me.

Reddit and the rest of the internet will still be here tomorrow. 

A cup of coffee or tea is waiting for you in the morning. 

Take a deep breath. 

Turn your pillow over to the fresh side. 

Straighten out your blankets. 

Put your white noise or sleep story on. 

Whatever happened today is in the past. 

Tomorrow is a new day. 

You will be ready to conquer it. 

Because you are capable,

And worthy,

And we are all rooting for you. ü´∂
