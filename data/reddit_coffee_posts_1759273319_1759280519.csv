1nuumpu,https://youtu.be/eBVacq-o7qA,"Simon Hanson: Drumming, Filmmaking & Squeeze(ing) in Creativity on The Hang!","In this episode of The Hang, host Scott Saldinger sits down with **Simon Hanson**, the long-time drummer of the legendary British band **Squeeze**, to explore his incredible journey as a musician, filmmaker, and creative innovator. From early dreams of becoming a pilot, cut short due to colorblindness, to finding his life‚Äôs calling behind the drum kit, Simon‚Äôs story is as inspiring as it is entertaining.  
  
Simon reflects on his early influences, his unconventional left-handed drumming start, and the relentless drive that pushed him to London to chase his ambition of becoming a professional musician. His path wasn‚Äôt instant fame‚Äîit included wedding gigs, odd jobs, and years of grinding before his talent and persistence brought him into the orbit of Glenn Tilbrook and ultimately into Squeeze, one of the UK‚Äôs most enduring and beloved bands.  
The conversation dives into Squeeze‚Äôs timeless catalog, from Tempted to Black Coffee in Bed, and how the band‚Äôs music continues to connect across generations. Simon shares his perspective on why Squeeze resonates so deeply: the combination of Chris Difford‚Äôs storytelling lyrics with Glenn Tilbrook‚Äôs complex yet accessible melodies creates songs that feel familiar even to those who don‚Äôt immediately recognize the band name.  
  
But Simon is far more than a drummer. He‚Äôs a filmmaker and video storyteller, whose creative evolution began with a simple flip camera given to him at an awards show. What started as tour diaries became a new artistic outlet. Today, Simon creates thought-provoking, experimental, and deeply personal videos using nothing more than his iPhone and laptop. He sees filmmaking not only as a way to document but as an art form intertwined with music‚Äîan extension of rhythm, emotion, and narrative.  
  
Simon and Scott explore the democratization of art through the internet, where platforms like YouTube give artists direct access to audiences, bypassing the old music industry gatekeepers. Yet, Simon also speaks honestly about the challenges: oversaturation, algorithm battles, and the struggle for visibility. He likens releasing music today to ‚Äúsitting in a farmer‚Äôs market stall‚Äù where audiences must seek you out‚Äîbut when they do, magic can happen.  
  
The episode also touches on Simon‚Äôs joy for drumming, the sense of community he finds in music, and how being part of a ‚Äúsafe gang‚Äù of musicians keeps him energized. Whether playing a small club with Glenn Tilbrook & The Fluffers or headlining festivals with Squeeze, Simon approaches each performance with gratitude and passion.  
He also opens up about his charity work and his belief that giving back creates ripples of positivity. Simon emphasizes that being kind and supportive within the artistic community not only helps others but also enriches one‚Äôs own creative journey.

1nuum96,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nuum96,Need advice on how to salvage this,"Background: my grandpa is a retired master glassblower with 45 years of experience. He dabbled in stained glass a few times but determined he didn't enjoy it much. I found this before he was going to presumably throw it out... I was like dude, no way. I asked about what year or time he made it and just kinda shrugged and said ""hell grandson i don't know"" 

Anyways, it's held in this weird wooden box (or maybe it's normal. IDK anything about stained glass). I want to remove it and maybe reframe it differently but I'm slightly nervous to do so. I'm not necessarily opposed to the idea of keeping it in the wood frame provided I can tighten the glass (because the glass slides around moves side to side easily with about an inch of give). 

So I ask two questions

1. Is it possible to remove it from the frame without destroying it or it falling apart? I would later reframe it 

2. If not, I could attempt to preserve the wood and let it be a coffee table or something (it's way too thick to hang on a wall because of how wide the wood is), but  can I fix the fact it slides around a lot in the frame?

During covid I moved to Jersey City and I pay around 2750$ for a nice 3 bedroom. Landlord lives above me and is chill. I make around 160-170k and maybe a promotion to 220kish in the coming few months (I really hope lol)

I work for Amazon and my manager lets me just coffee badge to the 10 exchange place office, so my commutes around 20-30 minutes per day. But I feel ever since I moved here (and also because of covid), I became a socially anxious hermit just staying at home all day working out in my home gym or playing video games, or playing with my 3 cats..

I'm thinking of moving to Astoria but I'm hesitant because I saw a few apartments, and they all feel so much crappier (and for sure a downgrade) then what I currently live in. I'd probably pay like 3300+ for a smaller 2 bedroom with no central air and no washer/dryer.

The commute time would also double, (I can badge into the midtown amazon office) so it wouldn't be too bad from Astoria.

I'm hesitant because my rent would go up by around 600, less space, and longer commute. But I'm thinking I need to get back into the city to be closer with friends and to just socialize more because I don't think I can live like this long term, I feel extremely stunted due to the social isolation..

**Parsing the Odds: Who‚Äôs the Favorite?**  
Let‚Äôs start with the numbers. According to RushBet, Inter Miami is the favorite at **-180**, implying a **60% chance to win** (because math, and because bookmakers love making us do it). Chicago Fire sits at **+375**, translating to a **21% implied probability**, while the draw checks in at **+370** (24%). But wait‚Äîother bookmakers like FanDuel and MyBookie.ag are throwing curveballs. Chicago‚Äôs decimal odds of **1.29‚Äì1.35** (equivalent to **74‚Äì77% implied**) suggest they‚Äôre the favorite? That‚Äôs like saying a flamingo is the top dog in a Miami heatwave‚Äîconfusing, but not impossible. The spread lines (Chicago -1.5 at 2.2 odds) hint bookies expect a Fire win, yet Inter Miami‚Äôs +1.5 line still lures bettors with a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù underdog play. This chaos reflects the game‚Äôs high stakes: Inter Miami, already playoff-locked, wants the Supporters‚Äô Shield, while Chicago fights for survival.

**Digesting the News: Form, Firepower, and Flamingo Finesse**  
Inter Miami, fourth in the Eastern Conference with 56 points, is coming off a 1-1 draw with Toronto FC. Their offense? A well-oiled machine led by Lionel Messi, who‚Äôs scoring like he‚Äôs playing a video game on ‚ÄúEasy‚Äù mode. Defensively, though, they‚Äôve been leaky enough to make a sponge blush‚Äîhence why Chicago‚Äôs +375 odds aren‚Äôt *entirely* insane. The Fire, meanwhile, are on a two-game winning streak (3-0 vs. Minnesota, 2-0 vs. Columbus), playing like a team with nothing to lose‚Ä¶ or maybe a team that finally fixed their coffee machine. Chicago‚Äôs strategy? Pack the midfield like a Miami traffic jam and punish Inter‚Äôs mistakes with counterattacks. Recent head-to-head? Inter Miami dominates with a 4-1 and 2-1 win in 2024, but a 0-0 draw in April 2025 shows Chicago can hang.

1nuujbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nuujbi/a_pack_of_fortunetelling_cards_is_telling_me/,A pack of fortune-telling cards is telling me something's outside,"If you‚Äôre ever in an op shop and something DOESN‚ÄôT catch your eye, I‚Äôd recommend taking another look. That probably sounds stupid, but that's just how I got my best finds. Most people's hobbies include things like knitting, music, or pottery. Personally, I like shopping. Not for clothes or decor, although I don‚Äôt mind picking up a nice pair of jeans or a cute vase where I find them. No. When I go shopping, I‚Äôm looking for magic. The real deal. The big fish. I go out to op shops, garage sales, and tip shops, and I seek out artifacts, enchanted objects, anomalies, whatever you call them. I look for things that‚Ä¶ do things. Clothing, furniture, jewellery, anything that does something it's not meant to. I‚Äôve found TVs that only play channels from 10 years ago, shirts that change design with every wash, and rings that can boil 1 metric cup of water at a time‚Äîseriously weird, funky, unexplainable stuff. My favourite find was an old knife that whispers to me in a thousand murmuring voices, slowly bending my mind to its will, all to make a near-perfect cacio e pepe. I know that sounds pointless, but not everything can be the one ring. It‚Äôs like normal op shopping; you see all these news stories about people picking up Picassos at $2 a piece, and then when you go, you get, like, a pair of Nikes in your size for 20 bucks. The pasta knife is my Nikes. Earlier today, I found my Picasso.¬†

¬†¬†¬†I was in this op shop in the centre of town. The secret to finding magical objects is to look for the things you don‚Äôt notice. If you‚Äôre scanning the shelves and you skip over something to check out something more interesting, chances are that thing you skipped was pretty important. Magic hides itself from people; that‚Äôs why nobody believes in it, and that‚Äôs why you only hear the fake stories. The rest just‚Ä¶ aren‚Äôt that interesting for some reason. I‚Äôve learnt to look out for when I inexplicably ignore a find when I‚Äôm out and about. Sometimes it gets a little tough, like when I notice I skipped over something but don‚Äôt notice the actual magical object next to it I skipped over too. Trying to find things your brain doesn‚Äôt want you to find gets frustrating, but when you get something good, the thrill is exhilarating. Well, today, I noticed one of the biggest gaps of attention I‚Äôve found so far.¬†

¬†Every time I walked through the board game section in this store, I wouldn‚Äôt even glance at the shelves, like I was embarrassed to be seen looking at Cluedo. The third time it happened, I stopped. Why wasn‚Äôt I looking? Sure, I have a bunch of board games already, but I never just walk past something; I always look. Always. I turned slowly, took one step, and stopped, then another, walking very slowly, determined not to miss anything. The section was empty; a lady hurriedly walked past me before slowly making her way towards the pottery in the corner of the store. I realised what I was doing was stupid; I was embarrassing myself. There was nothing here, just a variety of versions of Monopoly. Bingo, that‚Äôs exactly what I was looking for. I looked at the shelves on my right, examining all the old chess sets and taped-together Guess Whos. I looked at the shelves on my left; there was something there, for sure; I could feel it. Alright then, whatever I‚Äôm looking for is on the right. I made my way over. I examined every section slowly, very slowly. I skipped over the playing cards; they were all the same anyway. It took me way too long to realise what I did. I went back to the playing cards. I picked up every pack; I got into a rhythm, and I almost dropped one without looking at it. There it was. It was old and dusty; dead spiders and web strands clung to it. Unlike the rest of the cards on the shelf, these weren‚Äôt playing cards; they looked like they might‚Äôve been tarot cards? They didn‚Äôt have any art on the case, just black cardboard. Around the edges of the case, though, was repeated lettering, framed in gold, ‚ÄòSee What‚Äôs Next‚Äô.

¬†¬†¬†I pulled a card from the pack. Weird. No words, no conventional tarot art. It was a picture of what looked like shards of glass or ceramic on the floor, next to a pair of feet in brown loafers. I stared at it for a moment. What was this meant to mean, ‚ÄòYou will lose something in your future‚Äô? I almost gave up on the pack, thinking I missed the real deal. That's when I heard the sound of something breaking on the other side of the store. The lady in the pottery section stood stunned in front of a broken vase. She was babbling apologetically to an equally apologetic worker next to her. On her feet was a pair of brown loafers.

¬†¬†¬†I got home with the cards in my pocket, as well as a nice new set of cups on the cheap. When I was about to get in the house, though, I realised I didn‚Äôt have my keys. I could‚Äôve sworn I hadn‚Äôt taken them out of my pocket, but I couldn‚Äôt find them anywhere. Eventually I gave up, and I decided to just phone my landlord and tell her I got locked out of the house again. Turns out I had to wait for my landlord to pick her kids up from school, so I sat down on the front steps and decided to take a look at my new cards. I pulled one from the top of the deck, and on the front of the card was a picture of *my* keys. The keys were on the concrete pavement of a sidewalk. I was able to recognise the sidewalk outside my house based on the plants and houses in the background of the art. In a rush I ran out to the street, and there they were, lying on the ground. I phoned back my landlord and had to endure her berating me for putting her in a rush for no good reason.

¬†¬†¬†On the way back into my apartment, I (obviously) picked the cards back up off the stairs. I left them entirely open since I was in such a rush to get my keys again. In leaving so quickly, I had left the card I pulled face up. Instead of the image of keys that I had seen before, the card was entirely matte black, excluding a gold line in its centre. I shuffled it back into the deck and made my way inside. I have to admit this is the most excited I‚Äôve been over any magical object I‚Äôve found before. I couldn‚Äôt wait to pull another card and get another prophecy. I sat down at my desk (where I‚Äôm writing from now) and drew a card. On this one I saw a close-up rendition of a finger, with a small red gash on its side, lightly bleeding. I checked all my fingers; no cuts. I shuffled the card back into the deck and started cooking dinner, being especially careful with my knives. As I was preparing the carrots for the stir-fry, one of them rolled out from under my hand, and the knife (a little blunt) slipped into my finger, leaving a small red cut on its side. After putting on a plaster, I kept making dinner, but I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about the cards.

¬†¬†¬†While I ate dinner, I decided to skip on 2015 Shortland Street and drew another card: a lightbulb, exploding, surrounded by darkness. I looked up at my living room light and saw it flickering and heard the soft buzz emanating from inside. I decided to put a timer on my phone, just to see how long it would take before the prophecy came true. In the act of reaching into my pocket, I made a stupid mistake; the card was still in my hand. The corner of the card got caught on my jacket and folded up slightly. In a panic, I pulled the card out as fast as I could to check the damage. Suddenly, the lightbulb was gone. Instead, the card was black, like before, but instead of the one strike in the centre, there were two. Two golden lines, reflecting the light from the bulb, shimmering before my eyes. The light stopped flickering; it was silent.

¬†¬†¬†I didn‚Äôt take more than a minute to draw another card; I shuffled the deck again, this time drawing carefully. I pulled the card out; it was a rendition of a bird, a kereru, spread-eagled, like the card was a window it just flew into at high speed. I stared at it for a few seconds; this one had an incredibly detailed background ‚Äì it was my garden. A perfect rendition of my view out my living room window. I opened the curtains and held up the card to my eyes. The transition from art to reality was near-perfect; the branches of plum trees lead into each other as smooth, connected lines. My eyes slid up the bars of my fences, then through the grey lines in the card, and back out the top into the night sky. The only detail disturbing the drawing‚Äôs continuity was the fat pigeon filling up the centre of the frame; that, and the eyes. Down in the corner, in amongst the bushes, was a pair of large, amber eyes. They peered out from the darkness, like two bright lens flares. I lowered the card; nothing there. The eyes were only on the card.

¬†¬†I fixed my eyes on the form in the bushes; I could see soft lines around the eyes, dark grey on black. It looked like the head of some dog, or cat, or some other big animal. Based on the framing and the bushes the creature was in, whatever this was, it was huge. I stared at it for longer; it was as if, the longer I looked, I could see more of it, like it became more and more distinct, as if that thing could practically crawl out of the card and show me what it really was. BANG! The kereru hit the window; when birds that size collide with your house, it's not just a soft thud; those sounds reverberate throughout the walls and the floors, like a small earthquake. Startled, I stumbled back, my leg colliding with the table. I heard the cards clatter across the floor, and my glass shattered on the ground. The bird flew away, and I looked at the card in my hand.

Three gold tally marks in the centre of the card. I know that they‚Äôre tally marks; they have to be. My eyes dropped to the cards on the floor. I was expecting the tallies on them too, but instead, they all displayed an image, the same image. I saw my living room window again, this time from the outside. It was shattered; I can see the glass shards around the frame. In the centre of my living room is something. It looks like the thing from the bushes, but this time, it's in my house; it's huge, I can't make out details, and it's kept in silhouette by my living room lights. I‚Äôm looking at the cards right now; I‚Äôm at my desk in my room. I tried shuffling the cards; no luck, they‚Äôre stuck. Every card I draw is the same thing: that huge creature in my living room. I‚Äôm not sure what I should do about this, but I know it's not good. I‚Äôm going to leave; the prophecy has nothing to do with me. I don‚Äôt need to be there for that thing to come into my house. Right after I post this, I‚Äôll make a break for it. The living room is between my room and the front door, but it should be fine; I‚Äôll just have to¬†

Holy fuck, it‚Äôs in my home. I heard it at first. I was writing, and from the other side of the house I heard this huge crash, shattering glass, and then something walking, slowly, around my flat. I could hear the huge thumps of its feet and the scraping of its claws against the wood floors. As it made its way from the living room into the hallway, I heard its sides pressing against the walls, like somebody was moving a couch that was just a bit too big down the hall. Before it reached me, I made a dart for my closet; I‚Äôm still there. It made its way into my room, and I could hear its breathing, laboured, slow, gargling. That thing stank like mildew and old coffee grounds. The smell clung to the air, staying long after it left. Through the slits in my closet doors, I caught a glimpse of it. The creature was huge, big enough to fill my doorframe. It walked on all fours, thick and brown, and fur covered as much of its body as I could make out. It looked like it had some sort of mane, bulking up its front even more. It was clearly looking for me, sniffing at the air, turning over my pillows and my blanket. I watched as it slowly lowered itself down to peer under my bed. Then, it did the worst thing I could imagine: it turned straight around and looked straight into my closet.

I swear I made eye contact with it; it had to have seen me. That thing just stood there; it could have opened the closet or ripped it to splinters in a second. It was just as meticulous with every other part of my room. Instead, it turned and slinked back into the hallway. As it left, I heard it‚Ä¶ laughing, or whatever that was, like a hyena or a fox or something. I heard it move back down the hallway, and tears started to roll down my face. I know what you‚Äôre thinking, and I tried. I tried calling the police, my neighbours, my mum, anyone. But every time I called someone, the phone just released a horrible, loud screech, which felt like the loudest thing I‚Äôd ever heard. It should have heard me; I kept trying like an idiot, but every time I phoned, it just let out another burst of yelps and moved further AWAY from me. It's playing with me, I know groups; it doesn‚Äôt want to kill me, it wants me to be afraid.¬†

If I go out, I‚Äôm probably going to die, but if I stay here, then I‚Äôm definitely going to die. I‚Äôm going to go for groups; I can make it to the street in a minute, and I can make it to my neighbour‚Äôs in 2. If I take the right path, if I throw up as many diversions as I can, then I can make it. That thing isn‚Äôt scared of one guy, but I know most animals are scared of people in groups; maybe, just maybe, it‚Äôll give up if there are too many of us. I can hear it in the garden now, yipping and giggling. I‚Äôm ready; I‚Äôll update you if I make it. Goodnight.

I know I was the one who broke it off. Sana naiintindihan mo where I came from. I really wanted the best for you, for us. Before we met I became the best version of me para ready na ko sa ibibigay sakin. I thought ikaw na yun, and I still think that.

Tama ba sila that an anxious and an avoidant shouldn't be together? Di kasi ako naniwala. I thought communicating clearly what I needed would be enough. I didn‚Äôt ask for much naman diba? I just needed communication, reassurance and time. Hindi ba bare minimum lang naman yan? I never pushed, I never insisted. I always gave way.

I never asked you talk to me 24/7. I just asked to be in the loop with what you're doing, to let me know if you're going to be busy the whole day and will get back to me once okay na. Just 30 seconds of your time to just let me be aware of what's going on. Not total silence.

I never asked you take me out on a fancy date, or to see me most days. I just asked for your time, maybe a coffee or even just to hang out somewhere. Not cancelling on me and making me wait hours on end.

I don't want a relationship where it felt one sided. Where I was the one always eager to talk to you, the one who makes plans, the one who begs for your time.

When I voice out my needs you either tell me you'll be better or you just disappear on me. It never became better, C. It became worse. I got used to not hearing from you, I got used to not feeling the need to tell you anything, I got used to just being an online relationship, where in fact, you're only 30 minutes away from me.

Was I too much? Was I asking too much?

Despite all this I'm still hoping it'll be you. I'm still waiting that for once, you would fight for us and make an effort to really be better.

You kept on asking me ano account ko dito, maybe this'll be a give away and I hope you'll see how much I still love you.

I'm a romantic to a fault and maybe that'll be my downfall. But I'm still holding out hope that you can change and come back to me.

1nuudpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticMothers/comments/1nuudpq/just_barely_survived_another_visit_from_her/,Just barely survived another visit from her,"This was my last time hosting her at my place, as I‚Äôm moving in with my boyfriend in a few weeks. She was only going to be in town for 5 days but decided to come early and be here for 7 days, without asking. But she never asks if the dates of her visits work for me. She was here Wed - Tues. I typically spend Fri-Sun with my boyfriend as he lives 45 minutes away, owns his own house with fenced in yard and 2 large dogs, and I rent a small duplex with my own large dog. His place works better, and he‚Äôll come down during the week to help me with things or just hang out. Whenever she is in town I cut down my boyfriend time and only spend 24 hours with him, Sat afternoon till Sunday afternoon. 

So this trip on her first night there I casually mentioned my plans for my short visit with my boyfriend, and she freaks out. Starts claiming she‚Äôs here for less time than normal (that was a lie), we had so many things planned (we had nothing planned), started saying she was going to call my boyfriend and tell him I was allowed to stay with her all weekend and got out her phone thinking she had his number. Thank god she didn‚Äôt. I told her if she didn‚Äôt stop being selfish and accept my compromise of having a shorter weekend with him then I was going to his place now, and I was never giving her his number. Then we proceeded to fight about other things. I eventually had to tell her I was done fighting with her as it was an hour past my bedtime and I had work in the morning, unless she‚Äôd like me to quit my job so I could spend more time with her. 

Another factor leading to frustration- the rental duplex I‚Äôm in is owned by my family, I help rent out the other units and help manage things. Nmom originally wanted me to keep my duplex empty so I could move back if I break up with my boyfriend, claiming she supposedly did the same when she first got with my dad. When I adamantly refused we settled on leaving it empty over the winter as she had more trips booked and didn‚Äôt want to rent a hotel. The rest of her visit she proceeded to stuff random items of hers in with mine, like bathroom stuff and things in my closets. She also demanded I leave many of my own belongings behind so she can use them. My kureig even though she never uses it, my dresser I can‚Äôt sell so she can set stuff on it, my large mirror as she likes it and said she‚Äôd buy me a new one till I showed her the price, all my TVs so she can watch them, both my dining table and coffee table so she can set things on them, I can‚Äôt sell my nice set of plates and leave my cheap ones for her as she likes my nice ones, and so on. But then keeps pestering me about other things she wants to take like all my purses, my shoes even though we wear different sizes, and other random things. I offered to let her take some small pink bowls after she exclaimed over loving them and wanting to look for them at target and when I said she could have those she went off on me, repeatedly asking if my boyfriend wasn‚Äôt allowing me to have pink things. She‚Äôd also ask weird things like ask if I was taking my dishwasher? As if a guy who owns a house doesn‚Äôt already have one?? I can‚Äôt remember what else, just thinking how does a normal house in the Midwest not already have that?? And if I was leaving my pink curtains or if she could have them even though my parents have electric blinds and don‚Äôt need curtains? 

She also moved everything around like she always does - kitchen gloves get left in a different place every time but never the sink, towels were refolded, fridge items totally moved around, and the temperature was increased by more than 10¬∞! She left for the airport while I was at work today and she left a ton of towels on the floor of the bathroom (she uses a new body towel, hand towel, and washcloth every day even though she hangs them up at her house and I have a towel rack with 10 hooks) and trash all over my bedroom. I always spend a good part of my night doing laundry and cleaning and putting everything back where it‚Äôs supposed to go. 

I am sooooo thankful this was my last time spending the week with her at my place! I‚Äôve already told her there won‚Äôt be room at my boyfriend‚Äôs house, as well as emphasized how poorly trained and rowdy all 3 of the large dogs are together (they‚Äôre not, they‚Äôre perfect puppies).

1nuudcs,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nuudcs/what_to_do_if_my_espresso_machine_leaks/,What to do if my espresso machine leaks?,"Hey coffee lovers! I've been a barista for over 8 years, and I've dealt with pretty much every espresso machine problem you can imagine. Today, I want to talk about something that's probably giving some of you headaches right now - leaking espresso machines.

First off, don't panic! A leaking espresso machine is pretty common and usually fixable. I'll walk you through some troubleshooting steps that have saved me countless times.

The most common cause of leaks is worn-out gaskets or seals. These rubber parts naturally deteriorate over time, especially with regular use. If you're seeing water dripping from the group head or portafilter, this is likely your issue. The good news? Replacing gaskets is usually pretty straightforward and inexpensive.

Another common problem is loose connections. Sometimes, the internal water lines can become loose, causing leaks. This usually happens because of vibration during brewing or simple wear and tear. If you're noticing water pooling underneath your machine, this might be the culprit.

Here's what you can do:

1. Clean your machine thoroughly
2. Check and replace the gaskets if needed
3. Ensure all connections are tight
4. Descale regularly to prevent mineral buildup

Speaking of machines, I recently came across some really reliable models on https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine. They have great build quality and are less prone to leaking issues.

Now, if you're dealing with serious internal leaks or if your machine is old, it might be time for an upgrade. I know it's not what everyone wants to hear, but sometimes investing in a new machine is more cost-effective than constant repairs. I've found some great options at https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine that come with solid warranties and excellent customer support.

One last tip - preventive maintenance is key! I clean my machine daily and descale monthly. This routine has saved me from many potential problems, including leaks.

Remember, if you're not comfortable doing repairs yourself, it's always better to consult a professional. Some fixes require technical knowledge, and you don't want to risk damaging your machine further.

Let me know if you have any questions! I'm always happy to help fellow coffee enthusiasts keep their machines running smoothly.",1,1759279674.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

1nuu6ce,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1nuu6ce/the_interconnected_airbnb/,The Interconnected Airbnb,"I usually don‚Äôt write my experiences down in journals like this. Typically, I‚Äôd prefer to just keep my unsavory memories in my head to let them rot away over time, which makes the pain easier to cope with. However, with everything that has happened to me recently, I‚Äôd feel guilty if I just let all those traumatic experiences simply be forgotten about, especially since they involve friends and people so dear to me‚Ä¶ So, I shall tell the story of that godforsaken Airbnb and how it led me down a rabbithole of paranoia and grief, while trying to remain as accurate as possible so I can give myself peace of mind.

I go by the name of Muse. I know it‚Äôs strange-sounding, but I always hold a fondness for it. I‚Äôm just your average independent adult living out their life, with not much else to add. Besides my uninteresting past, the most special thing in my life were my two closest friends, Courtney and Marigold.

We all met when we were children and have been inseparable since. Courtney was always funny and energetic, often whisking us away into trips and hangouts in town where she would make us laugh with her jokes. And Marigold was my best friend, her extremely kind and loving personality helped me through a lot of dark times, where she listened to my worries and gave me helpful advice that truly made me feel safe and strong. These positively similar yet different people complimented my quiet and shy personality well and made for some incredibly unforgettable memories. For many years and well into our collective adulthood, we all shared a strong bond that seemed like it'd never end.

Sadly, nothing lasts forever‚Ä¶ About a month ago as of me writing this, Marigold died unexpectedly‚Ä¶ In the days leading up to the death, she complained about feeling paranoid and being stalked in her own house to me and Courtney in our group chat. Since this all started happening after she found a dead drunk driver in his car as a result of a horrible accident a little while before, we both just reassured her that she was fine and felt guilty from seeing the horrific sight. Looking back, we should've listened to her more, like she did for us‚Ä¶

When Marigold suddenly stopped responding to our messages and wasn‚Äôt reaching out like she always did, we assumed the silence meant something was very wrong, since it was so unlike her usual behavior. After a few days of this, I drove an hour to her house out of worry and being the closest nearby out of anyone she knew. I remember knocking on the door and feeling frantic when she didn‚Äôt answer. I then found the hidden house key she mentioned to me before and let myself in. The lights were off and everything was eerily silent, the complete opposite from how she normally lived. When I reached her bedroom, I opened the door and screamed when I saw her lying in her bed with her throat slit and dried blood all over neck, knife on the floor right under her overhanging hand‚Ä¶

When the police got there and briefly investigated, they ruled it as a suicide. I felt confused and disbelief at this, since Marigold never showed any signs of suicidal thoughts or even anything else wrong beside the paranoia. Still, they couldn‚Äôt find any evidence of foul play, so I just had to accept it, which was easier said than done‚Ä¶ The image of her dead body and the trauma of me being the first one to find out gave me terrible nightmares and anxiety, not to mention the guilt of not knowing sooner. And I even started to develop paranoid thoughts and daydreams myself, much like what she described‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never had these issues before, so maybe this was what grief and seeing death does to people?

Regardless, losing her was the most painful thing I‚Äôve ever gone through before. Marigold‚Äôs comforting talks to us and her advice on never giving up and being true to ourselves were a lifeline to both Courtney and I. Her fun hangouts and warm embraces being gone as well opened a wound in our hearts we won‚Äôt recover from. She was an irreplaceable treasure, and now, she‚Äôs gone, just like that, no warning, no last goodbyes, no nothing‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs the most horrible kind of death, to be honest, the type where it just comes out of nowhere and the person you love is just gone forever, never to be seen again‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs so cruel, but it happens to everyone, even if that doesn‚Äôt make it any less painful.

I didn‚Äôt have much of a chance to grieve, or even cry, since her funeral was coming up just a week afterwards and we were personally involved in the arrangements. It was going to be a closed casket funeral and she would be buried in the hometown where she grew up with her family, which was over two hours from my apartment. Since I was going to be there for a few days and I had to help with the preparations and will-related stuff before the ceremony itself, I decided to rent an Airbnb in the town that was very close by to the cemetery.

I know Airbnbs don‚Äôt exactly have the best reputation when it comes to security or the real estate economy, but the ones in the area were cheaper than hotels and would allow me to relax and relive some nostalgic memories growing up in that town with Marigold and Courtney. Besides, she was so close to me and I owe it to her as her best friend, which is why I wanted to help with the funeral and be there for her family and friends.

And so, I found one just two miles away from the cemetery for a really cheap rental rate. The house itself was a standard suburban one story home with a backyard next to the woods and an extended patio porch. It looked kind of weird and creepy, to be honest, I never really liked old houses like that very much‚Ä¶ Even so, the price and proximity made it too good to pass up. This led me to book the reservation and contact the client, who was the only suspicious part of the whole deal. He went by the name of Mr. Abode (I know it‚Äôs stupid, believe me) and he seemed enthusiastic to let me rent out the place. He even lowered the price a lot after I explained my situation, which was nice yet odd. Still, I didn‚Äôt complain, I was there for my recently deceased platonic soulmate, not for weird owners and their possibly fake names.

I would be staying for four nights and five days there, for all the arrangements, the funeral itself, and then a hangout with Courtney around town for the last day before we headed home. Honestly, I wasn‚Äôt too keen on being in a creepy stranger‚Äôs house for that long and I was dreading the depression and grief the coming events would surely bring, me not taking these kinds of feelings well before in the past. But, it was for Marigold, and I‚Äôd do anything for her. Just a few days and this would all be over, right? Even though I didn‚Äôt want to confront her death, I knew I couldn't escape it forever, especially with the growing paranoia inside of me‚Ä¶

***...***

Soon after, I began the drive to the Airbnb. I left three days before the funeral would begin and knew I would get there at around sunset. The drive was nothing spectacular, and I got there after going through the countryside for a couple of hours. The house itself was nestled away on the backstreet of some rundown neighborhood, one I remember passing by but never visiting myself as a child. As I pulled into the driveway to park my car, I saw the outside of the property. Other than having more features in the back and a large porch that extended out into the driveway, it looked like any other house nearby. Sure, it was kind of weird and in a sketchy part of town, but the price and size were quite good, so hopefully there wouldn't be any further red flags‚Ä¶

I then got out of the car and took my luggage out from the trunk before proceeding to walk up to the house‚Äôs side door. I couldn‚Äôt use the front one since I didn‚Äôt have the key, and the one under the porch was locked with a security code. Mr. Abode told me the code when we emailed each other earlier, so I memorized it and should‚Äôve had no trouble getting inside.

When I stepped up to the alcove where it was located, I swear I heard a car door slamming somewhere off in the distance. I looked behind me and around my field of view, but didn‚Äôt see anything. It was probably a neighbor or something, no big deal. I then shifted my attention back to the door and saw it had a combination lock hanging on the knob. I proceeded to spend the next minute or so dialing in the code I learned. When I entered it correctly and saw the lock wouldn‚Äôt budge, I tried it again. Same thing as last time, nothing. After another minute of frustrated fiddling with it, I tilted my head further up and saw a digital keypad that rested above the knob. Realizing my silly mistake, I punched in the code there and it unlocked instantly, to my relief.

Chuckling briefly to myself, I opened the door and stepped inside. I carried my suitcase across the threshold and saw the entire house‚Äôs lights were off and I was standing in the kitchen area. The layout of the kitchenette was odd, as it was like a small thin hallway instead of a full-sized room. The sink and cabinets were built into the wall on one side, while the microwave and oven appliances were on the other. And there appeared to be‚Ä¶ a closet in the middle of the tall cabinets‚Äô section, which was very odd to see there, to say the least. And this weird setup extended halfway across the house before it poured into what appeared to be the living room.

As I was finishing taking in the surreal architecture of the place, it suddenly hit me. Nature called, and I had to find a restroom quickly. I hadn't gone that day, since I was very busy with the preparations and travelling there. Not being able to hold it in any longer, I put my luggage down and ran forward down the kitchen hall, desperately searching for the bathroom. To my luck, one was right ahead of me, in the middle of a branching hallway with the door open, revealing a much-desired toilet.

While I was in there doing my business, I heard what sounded like a door creaking from further inside somewhere. My heart rate sped up and my body tensed at the sound. I swiftly finished up and exited the bathroom, looking around for the source. Nothing seemed different, however. Then again, I didn‚Äôt even take a good look around the place, so maybe I just wasn‚Äôt used to house noises like that could‚Äôve been.

As I further scanned my surroundings, I saw the potential source. The outside door I came in from was shut, my suitcase still on the floor in front of it. I thought to myself, trying to remember exactly what happened. I was in such a hurry, I wasn‚Äôt paying attention. Did I shut it myself right after coming in, or not? I wouldn't leave it open, right? I then shrugged it off shortly afterwards. It didn‚Äôt really matter, it was just a small detail not worth stressing over.

Then, I proceeded to walk over to it and grab my luggage before taking a further look around the Airbnb, curious about the place I would be staying at for the next few days. Past the door and kitchen was the living room, which had some odd features. It was mostly barren, apart from a large couch, a coffee table, a dresser with a flat screen TV on it, some unremarkable paintings of fish, and‚Ä¶ a large black steel wood-burning furnace smack dab in the middle of the room for some unexplained reason. There were even logs of real wood next to it on the brick podium it stood on, and a giant metal pipe ran from the top of it and into the ceiling, acting as a sort of chimney. It didn‚Äôt make any sense, why would anyone think it was a good idea to put this in the middle of a house? It looked so out of place.

Upon further inspection of the living room‚Äôs surrounding walls, I noticed not one, but three closets on each side that were built into them and painted to camouflage them from view. I wondered why that was even necessary, since that would make them more difficult to use. Interested, I slowly went to each one and slid them open. One was empty, another had board games and art supplies in it, and the other had some random person‚Äôs old clothes in it (hopefully not Mr. Abode‚Äôs). I shook my head and tried to ignore the oddities of the house, but my intrigue got the better of me.

On the far side of the living room, the front door was there that led outside. Next to it, was another door that led somewhere further inside. I walked over to it and opened it, revealing a large bedroom that was submerged in total darkness, not having any windows. I flicked on the light switch and it illuminated everything instantly. A large king-sized bed, a small TV on a dresser, a nightstand with a lamp, and a closet were all that was there. I then took a closer look and noticed another door that led to what I assumed was a small restroom on the far side of the room, different from the one I used just a few minutes earlier.

I went inside and my assumption was correct. Just a small room with a sink and toilet, but no bathtub or shower. But then, I saw what appeared to be another hidden closet built into the far side of the room next to the toilet. Suspending my absolute disbelief, I opened it and saw a dark crawl space with what appeared to be another closet within that closet. Now feeling nervous for some unexplained reason, I tried to open the secondary door, only for it to be either locked or jammed, I couldn't tell which one. I backed out slowly and decided to leave it alone and put it out of my mind.

I trudged back to the living room and faced towards the branching hall I went down when I first entered. Apart from the large bathroom (which had a shower, a large glass window above it, and no weird closets), both paths led to a medium-sized bedroom in each. The two rooms were nearly identical in contents: A queen-sized bed, a closet, a window, a nightstand, a dresser, a chair, and a ceiling fan. Where they differed was while one had white walls and matching bedsheets, the other was blue in its color-scheme. However, I then saw another, more disturbing discrepancy between them. The white bedroom had what appeared to be a sealed off crawl space in the far corner‚Äôs wall, a hatch that appeared to be glued shut. I shuddered thinking about why it was sealed, or what was in it‚Ä¶

I got out of there quickly and went back into the hall. That‚Äôs when I saw a familiar sight yet again. Two more closets on either end of the hallway, both camouflaged and blended into the walls. I didn‚Äôt see them before, since they were hidden in the darkest corners and hard to see unless you stared at them from a certain angle. I was getting a little freaked out by that point, wondering why the hell there were so many weird closets in seemingly every part of the Airbnb. Once again, I opened them and found nothing in either one. Even though it was kind of nerve-wracking, I was hellbent on seeing the rest of the property, hoping it would put these anxieties to rest.

Once more, I headed back to the living room and stared at the only side I hadn't explored yet, the center of it acting like an atrium of a massive, beating heart. Past the furnace, there was a large brown table with eight chairs surrounding it, acting as a makeshift dining area of sorts. On the wall beyond it, a sliding glass door displayed the backyard outside it.

I went over and unlocked it before sliding it open, the hot afternoon breeze hitting my face. Directly across the threshold, a small roofed patio was there that consisted of a few chairs around an empty firepit and nothing else. Beyond that, a metal fence lined the perimeter, where a quite steep hill rose up into thick trees and woodlands behind it, creating an odd sight that looked surreal. The right side of the yard had nothing but fresh cut grass as far as the eye could see. The left side, however, was far more‚Ä¶ interesting, you could say.

A stone pathway stretched from the patio and to another, more larger one, where an unused old basketball hoop stood and‚Ä¶ another damn closet. This was getting ridiculous at that point, and I threw it open once again. Nothing, not even shelves or hangers were inside, as expected. I then turned around and saw that the roofed path led to a small maintenance or toolshed at the end, on the edge of the property. Curious about the small structure's contents, I strided over to its door and attempted to pull it open. It was locked and I lacked the key to open it. There was a small window on its side and I tried to look though it, but it was too high for me to reach. I gave up quickly, not feeling it was worth the effort, since it was probably just standard toolshed stuff inside.

To put my mind at ease, I searched the fence and lining walls once again. I found yet another outside closet on the far left side, this one camouflaged into the house‚Äôs foundation somehow. Of course, there was nothing in there and that‚Äôs when I quit trying to make sense of this nightmare of architecture. It was also getting dark by then, so I went inside and locked all the doors in order to relax and calm down.

I paced around the living room and tried to think about all I saw and heard since arriving at the Airbnb. But the more I rationalized it, the more freaked out I became. The door sound I heard while using the bathroom started to get under my skin, along with the house's odd layout, features, and general unsettling vibes it gave off. Why were there so many closets? There had to be about twenty of them in total. Why were so many of them hidden? Who thought putting them on the outside walls, kitchen, and even the bathroom would be such a good idea? What did those creepy crawl spaces and locked shed doors contain? Wouldn't using the furnace be such a fire hazard? Was that sound really a house noise? Was I alone‚Ä¶? I didn't have the answers to these endless questions that arose from my anxiety, and thinking about them only made it worse.

I then took a deep breath and chalked it all up to just strange outdated design quirks. It might explain why the price was so low and why Mr. Abode seemed eager to let me rent it. I was just overthinking it all because I was upset at Marigold‚Äôs recent passing, I thought, letting my fear and paranoia get the better of me. It was just a rundown Airbnb, that was all. I‚Äôve been through worse and would only be there a short while, even if the place gave me the willies. I should just get through it and focus on what I came there to do: Help Marigold‚Äôs family and friends put her to rest. She would want me to do that, along with Courtney. This made my body and heart slow down a bit and I felt like my usual self again.

Using this relief, I unpacked my suitcase and quickly got ready for bed. It was dark outside and I was pretty tired from the day‚Äôs trip there and all the frantic searching, so I decided to go to sleep early. I had a busy day tomorrow, after all. I chose to sleep in the blue bedroom, considering it was the most normal room in the house without any oddities. I shut the room‚Äôs door and locked it just to be safe before climbing into the soft bed and resting my eyes.

Somehow, feeling tired made me feel less afraid, likely because my mind was slowing down. It felt funny, thinking about how an odd house was scaring me so much. Sure, it was like a real life House of Leaves, but the owner wouldn't let people rent it if there was something wrong with it. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôd be in there the whole time anyway. I needed to face this horrible tragedy that happened to Marigold, whether I wanted to or not‚Ä¶

As my consciousness began to drift off, I hoped that I wouldn't have any bad dreams or further paranoia. And I also wondered if the Airbnb‚Äôs eeriness would get to me or not‚Ä¶

The next morning came fast, and I woke up with a tinge of melancholy once I finally remembered where I was and why I was there. The dream was part of it, yes, but the thought of having to arrange the burial of my best friend saddened me so much‚Ä¶ I didn't want to think about it, but I had to. The silver lining was that I slept okay otherwise in that creepy house, at least.

Right after, I swiftly got up and prepared for the trip to the funeral home, where the arrangement appointment took place in less than an hour. Even though I didn‚Äôt need to rush, with the destination being only ten minutes away, I just wanted to get it over and done with. Within mere moments, I was driving in my car, speeding away from that place, and it felt great to get out of there for a bit.

Very soon, I was there and parked the car in front of the depressing looking Victorian house that acted as the venue to where the local dead went. Not wanting to think about it too much, I hastily went inside and waited in the lobby for the appointment to start. It was pretty boring, to be honest. I was too out of it to scroll on my phone, but there was nothing else to do. This led me to sort of swirl around in my dark thoughts for what seemed like an eternity.

Once an untold amount of time passed, I heard the door open and looked to see a familiar face walk in.¬†*‚ÄúMuse? You‚Äôre here!‚Äù*, Courtney said in relief, noticing me instantly. I wasn‚Äôt too surprised, since we were supposed to meet up there to do the whole thing together, but a big grin creeped its way onto my face for the first time since before Marigold‚Äôs passing. I stood up and nodded before replying:¬†*‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs nice to see you again.‚Äù*¬†We hadn‚Äôt seen each other at all in months, and I think it overwhelmed her.

Without another word, she walked over to me and hugged me for a long moment, clearly trying to fight back tears as she spoke again.¬†*‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry it took me this long to come and do this‚Ä¶ It must‚Äôve been so hard for you, seeing the aftermath and arranging all this ahead of time.‚Äù*, she stated with sorrow,¬†*‚ÄúBut now I‚Äôm here. And I promise that we‚Äôll get through this together, for Marigold‚Äôs sake. She was my best friend, too.‚Äù*¬†She then let me go as I struggled to answer at first, before soon settling with,¬†*‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre right, let‚Äôs just work through this, one step at a time.‚Äù*, as a way to ease the tension I felt from the whole exchange.

This seemed to satisfy Courtney, who simply smiled wryly and took a seat next to me before falling silent. She probably knew I wasn‚Äôt doing too well at that time, so her normally talkative and energetic self was replaced with a more sad and pulled-back demeanor. This tragedy was affecting her more than I thought, and the more I saw her downcast mood, the more I wanted to just get it all done as soon as possible. I didn‚Äôt want to face this, but it‚Äôs inevitable‚Ä¶ She was even acting more like what Marigold did for me when I was having trouble in the past, possibly as a way to cope. This only made the already long wait feel even more unbearable as the minutes turned into hours.

Eventually, we were called into the back of the building for the appointment. It went fine, we just filled out some paperwork and finalized the funeral‚Äôs timeline, events, and other logistical stuff. Sure, it was sad to think about, but we didn‚Äôt see Marigold‚Äôs body, so it wasn‚Äôt as bad as I thought it would be. It all took about an hour of negotiations total, nothing crazy.

After that, Courtney and I went our separate ways. She was staying at her childhood family's house nearby, which is where she went once we left the funeral home. I, on the other hand, decided to take a trip to the local supermarket to buy some food to keep in the Airbnb for the next few days. I spent about an hour there before heading back. I just got a few pre-made meals and some basic snacks, nothing special.

I spent the rest of the afternoon and evening just chilling out in the living room, bored out of my mind. Due to being out in the rural parts of the state, there wasn‚Äôt anything very interesting on the TV‚Äôs limited selection of channels. Aside from a news report on a possible serial killer on the loose in a few neighboring states, I didn‚Äôt really pay attention. I mostly just doomscrolled on various social media sites. I stopped after a few hours once I saw posts of people talking about Marigold and celebrating her life. I knew it wouldn‚Äôt be good for my mental state at that moment, so I turned my phone off.

It was getting closer to night then, which motivated me to fix myself some dinner and get ready to sleep. It would be an early night once again, as settling family matters all day tomorrow would certainly be more exhausting than what I did earlier that day. I dreaded it, but at least sleeping seemed to temporarily push back these uncomfortable thoughts and events, so it seemed like a fair trade to me.

Doing the same thing as the previous night, I brushed my teeth, changed into sleepwear, charged my phone, and then proceeded to climb into bed. I fell asleep faster than I did previously, which felt nice. The last thought I remember having was whether or not I would be able to get through the coming days without too much pain and suffering‚Ä¶

***You find yourself standing outside of the Airbnb, in the backyard. Next to the shed, Marigold is there, her back turned to you. Feeling joy at seeing her again, you slowly inch yourself closer to her, looking forward to hearing her sweet voice and seeing her beautiful smile.***

All the while, you tremble and feel angry that you‚Äôre essentially trapped here in this purgatory that feels all too real.***

***It finally becomes too much and you briefly shut your eyes and look away for a few seconds.

I woke up to what sounded like a loud bang hitting the bedroom door. I sat up and was breathing heavily, my entire body in a cold sweat. The room was pitch black and it must‚Äôve been some time in the dead of night. Putting aside the disturbing nightmare I had, I tried to analyze what the sound I heard on the edge of sleep exactly was.

The closest I could describe it was a fist pounding on the wood of the door. That implied quite a scary thought: That someone else was in the house with me. Feeling scared now, I spent what was probably over fifteen minutes listening for any other noises. Nothing else rang out, however. This made me calm down a lot, since it was unlikely someone actually was there. I was still waking up, so who knows if there was even a sound at all, it was probably just a bad dream. It was also the middle of the night and I doubted there‚Äôs anything valuable there to steal. Even if it was real, what could someone possibly do? The bedroom door was locked and I would hear them if they continued to make a racket.

Taking a few deep breaths, I laid back down and fell fast asleep once again. It seemed the upcoming funeral was getting to me more than I thought. The stress and expectations made me feel a bit frustrated that I was supposed to be perfect and not be too upset. I missed Marigold, and I wish she was there to comfort me‚Ä¶ Her departed warmth helped me sleep, even if only a little bit longer.

I woke up a few hours later and was once again ready to get out of bed and go to Marigold‚Äôs childhood home to help out her family with the will and assets. I completely forgot about the banging sound the previous evening, more pressing matters on my mind then. I quickly ate some snacks and got dressed before getting in my car to leave, leaving behind that ominous place for the time being.

It took a good twenty minutes or so before I arrived at Marigold's parents' house. To my surprise, Courtney had already arrived and was standing out in the driveway, seemingly waiting for me. I finished pulling in and parked the car, then proceeded to take the initiative in speaking to her that time.

*‚ÄúCourtney‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs good to see you here so early.‚Äù*, I said with a bit of awkwardness,¬†*‚ÄúI know this will be rough, so let‚Äôs just keep ourselves together. That‚Äôs what she would‚Äôve wanted, right‚Ä¶?‚Äù*¬†Luckily, this morphed her sour expression into a slight smile.¬†*‚ÄúHeh‚Ä¶ Glad to know she‚Äôs rubbed off on ya too.‚Äù*, she stated with a chuckle.

She then crossed her arms and regretfully remarked:¬†*‚ÄúAnywho, you know what‚Äôs comin‚Äô. This‚Äôll be hard, for sure‚Ä¶‚Äù*¬†Knowing what she was referring to, I nodded solemnly.¬†*‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ It hurts to do all this so much‚Ä¶‚Äù*, I responded honestly,¬†*‚ÄúIt may stress me out, but it‚Äôs a part of life, I guess.‚Äù*¬†Sensing my internal struggles, Courtney put her hand on my shoulder and silently reassured me to move on to the next stage of this long process of burying the dead. It didn‚Äôt hurt as bad when she was around.

Not too long later, we both went inside and met up with Marigold‚Äôs parents. Everything went fine at first, with them being happy to see us and talking about their daughter happily. But as they moved on to conversing about her assets and possessions, tears were shed and things got quite heavy. Especially once we went to her childhood bedroom to discuss what to do with everything there. It was heartbreaking and I tried to hold in my sorrow as much as I could‚Ä¶

The whole process lasted for about six hours, and it was torture to endure all the crying and sadness from everyone else. I was worried I couldn‚Äôt handle the funeral the next day the whole time. It might sound a bit harsh, but I was glad to eventually get it done and get out of there, since I‚Äôm not the best at this kind of thing‚Ä¶

The sun was setting when I finally got back to the Airbnb and while I was relieved to be done with the day‚Äôs tasks, the impending dread of what tomorrow would bring and going back inside that unsettling house caused me to feel worried and nervous. Turns out, I was right to feel that way‚Ä¶

The moment I walked through the door and shut it, my heart nearly stopped when I saw an open bag of potato chips sitting on the table, a few stray pieces scattered about near it. I know I didn‚Äôt leave that there when I left‚Ä¶ Or did I? I was in such a rush this morning and was so nervous about the asset talks, that I don‚Äôt remember for sure what I exactly did that morning. I mean, I didn't recall leaving food out on the table. Then again, I did eat some chips as a quick snack. Maybe I was careless? In addition, would an intruder really leave out an obvious sign they were there like that? It seems far-fetched to think they would be that messy. Nevertheless, I did search a few of the closets and rooms to ease my concerns. Of course, I found nothing and didn‚Äôt hear or see anything strange. I sighed heavily and said,¬†*‚ÄúGuess there‚Äôs nobody here, after all‚Ä¶‚Äù*, to myself as confirmation.

With that, I managed to put the bad feelings I got out of my mind and do my usual routine of doomscrolling, eating, and getting ready to sleep. Staying at this surprisingly cheap house was way more boring than I thought it‚Äôd be, but it was only for a couple more days. I was pretty mad at the layout for some reason and how Mr. Abode didn‚Äôt mention it, though that feeling quickly disappeared once I realized how tired I was. At the same time in the early evening as before, I was in bed and out like a light, hoping I could have an uninterrupted night of sleep once again‚Ä¶

***...***

***An entity wakes up in a completely lightless space, with no color or light to be seen at all. It then pushes what appears to be a door open, bathing its field of view in nocturnal moonlight.***

***The entity creeps out of the closet and into a small bathroom. It then exits the bathroom and tiptoes silently into a large bedroom.***

***Another door opens, showing a living room with a couch, TV, and furnace that‚Äôs as black as the night outside of the sliding glass door on the back wall. The entity begins moving towards the back of the home, to a branching hallway.***

***It turns right and pushes the bedroom‚Äôs door ajar with an agonizingly slow speed. From afar, you are seen sleeping soundly, with a peaceful expression and relaxed position. And you are not disturbed or aware of the entity‚Äôs entrance.***

***In an odd turn of events, the room shifts and melds everywhere until it becomes Marigold‚Äôs bedroom. The entity now stands behind the closed doors of the closet, watching her sleep through the wooden slits. She is still breathing then.***

***The entity‚Äôs sights then shift back to you sleeping in the house‚Äôs bedroom once again, you are still sleeping quietly and it is watching through the closet. Suddenly, it throws the doors open and rushes at you in a shadowy instant.***

1nuu68n,https://v.redd.it/a0hn2bp2cesf1,Wan 2.5 is really really good (native audio generation is awesome!),"I did a bunch of tests to see just how good Wan 2.5 is, and honestly, it seems very close if not comparable to Veo3 in most areas.

First, here are all the prompts for the videos I showed:

*1. The white dragon warrior stands still, eyes full of determination and strength. The camera slowly moves closer or circles around the warrior, highlighting the powerful presence and heroic spirit of the character.*

*2. A lone figure stands on an arctic ridge as the camera pulls back to reveal the Northern Lights dancing across the sky above jagged icebergs.*

*3. The armored knight stands solemnly among towering moss-covered trees, hands resting on the hilt of their sword. Shafts of golden sunlight pierce through the dense canopy, illuminating drifting particles in the air. The camera slowly circles around the knight, capturing the gleam of polished steel and the serene yet powerful presence of the figure. The scene feels sacred and cinematic, with atmospheric depth and a sense of timeless guardianship.*

This third one was image-to-video, all the rest are text-to-video.

*4. Japanese anime style with a cyberpunk aesthetic. A lone figure in a hooded jacket stands on a rain-soaked street at night, neon signs flickering in pink, blue, and green above. The camera tracks slowly from behind as the character walks forward, puddles rippling beneath their boots, reflecting glowing holograms and towering skyscrapers. Crowds of shadowy figures move along the sidewalks, illuminated by shifting holographic billboards. Drones buzz overhead, their red lights cutting through the mist. The atmosphere is moody and futuristic, with a pulsing synthwave soundtrack feel. The art style is detailed and cinematic, with glowing highlights, sharp contrasts, and dramatic framing straight out of a cyberpunk anime film.*

*5. A sleek blue Lamborghini speeds through a long tunnel at golden hour. Sunlight beams directly into the camera as the car approaches the tunnel exit, creating dramatic lens flares and warm highlights across the glossy paint. The camera begins locked in a steady side view of the car, holding the composition as it races forward. As the Lamborghini nears the end of the tunnel, the camera smoothly pulls back, revealing the tunnel opening ahead as golden light floods the frame. The atmosphere is cinematic and dynamic, emphasizing speed, elegance, and the interplay of light and motion.*

*6.* A cinematic tracking shot of a Ferrari Formula 1 car racing through the iconic Monaco Grand Prix circuit. The camera is fixed on the side of the car that is moving at high speed, capturing the sleek red bodywork glistening under the Mediterranean sun. The reflections of luxury yachts and waterfront buildings shimmer off its polished surface as it roars past. Crowds cheer from balconies and grandstands, while the blur of barriers and trackside advertisements emphasizes the car‚Äôs velocity. The sound design should highlight the high-pitched scream of the F1 engine, echoing against the tight urban walls. The atmosphere is glamorous, fast-paced, and intense, showcasing the thrill of racing in Monaco.

*7. A bustling restaurant kitchen glows under warm overhead lights, filled with the rhythmic clatter of pots, knives, and sizzling pans. In the center, a chef in a crisp white uniform and apron stands over a hot skillet. He lays a thick cut of steak onto the pan, and immediately it begins to sizzle loudly, sending up curls of steam and the rich aroma of searing meat. Beads of oil glisten and pop around the edges as the chef expertly flips the steak with tongs, revealing a perfectly caramelized crust. The camera captures close-up shots of the steak searing, the chef‚Äôs focused expression, and wide shots of the lively kitchen bustling behind him. The mood is intense yet precise, showcasing the artistry and energy of fine dining.*

*8.* A cozy, warmly lit coffee shop interior in the late morning. Sunlight filters through tall windows, casting golden rays across wooden tables and shelves lined with mugs and bags of beans. A young woman in casual clothes steps up to the counter, her posture relaxed but purposeful. Behind the counter, a friendly barista in an apron stands ready, with the soft hiss of the espresso machine punctuating the atmosphere. Other customers chat quietly in the background, their voices blending into a gentle ambient hum. The mood is inviting and everyday-realistic, grounded in natural detail. Woman: ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôll have a cappuccino, please.‚Äù Barista (nodding as he rings it up): ‚ÄúOf course. That‚Äôll be five dollars.‚Äù

Now, here are the main things I noticed:

1. Wan 2.1 is really good at dialogues. You can see that in the last two examples. HOWEVER, you can see in prompt 7 that we didn't even specify any dialogue, though it still did a great job at filling it in. If you want to avoid dialogue, make sure to include keywords like 'dialogue' and 'speaking' in the negative prompt.
2. Amazing camera motion, especially in the way it reveals the steak in example 7, and the way it sticks to the sides of the cars in examples 5 and 6.
3. Very good prompt adherence. If you want a very specific scene, it does a great job at interpreting your prompt, both in the video and the audio. It's also great at filling in details when the prompt is sparse (e.g. first two examples).
4. It's also great at background audio (see examples 4, 5, 6). I've noticed that even if you're not specific in the prompt, it still does a great job at filling in the audio naturally.
5. Finally, it does a great job across different animation styles, from very realistic videos (e.g. the examples with the cars) to beautiful animated looks (e.g. examples 3 and 4).

I also made a full tutorial breaking this all down. Feel free to watch :)

1nuu3ut,https://v.redd.it/o4m2aovebesf1,Wan 2.5 is really really good (native audio generation is awesome!),"I did a bunch of tests to see just how good Wan 2.5 is, and honestly, it seems very close if not comparable to Veo3 in most areas.

First, here are all the prompts for the videos I showed:

*1. The white dragon warrior stands still, eyes full of determination and strength. The camera slowly moves closer or circles around the warrior, highlighting the powerful presence and heroic spirit of the character.*

*2. A lone figure stands on an arctic ridge as the camera pulls back to reveal the Northern Lights dancing across the sky above jagged icebergs.*

*3. The armored knight stands solemnly among towering moss-covered trees, hands resting on the hilt of their sword. Shafts of golden sunlight pierce through the dense canopy, illuminating drifting particles in the air. The camera slowly circles around the knight, capturing the gleam of polished steel and the serene yet powerful presence of the figure. The scene feels sacred and cinematic, with atmospheric depth and a sense of timeless guardianship.*

This third one was image-to-video, all the rest are text-to-video.

*4. Japanese anime style with a cyberpunk aesthetic. A lone figure in a hooded jacket stands on a rain-soaked street at night, neon signs flickering in pink, blue, and green above. The camera tracks slowly from behind as the character walks forward, puddles rippling beneath their boots, reflecting glowing holograms and towering skyscrapers. Crowds of shadowy figures move along the sidewalks, illuminated by shifting holographic billboards. Drones buzz overhead, their red lights cutting through the mist. The atmosphere is moody and futuristic, with a pulsing synthwave soundtrack feel. The art style is detailed and cinematic, with glowing highlights, sharp contrasts, and dramatic framing straight out of a cyberpunk anime film.*

*5. A sleek blue Lamborghini speeds through a long tunnel at golden hour. Sunlight beams directly into the camera as the car approaches the tunnel exit, creating dramatic lens flares and warm highlights across the glossy paint. The camera begins locked in a steady side view of the car, holding the composition as it races forward. As the Lamborghini nears the end of the tunnel, the camera smoothly pulls back, revealing the tunnel opening ahead as golden light floods the frame. The atmosphere is cinematic and dynamic, emphasizing speed, elegance, and the interplay of light and motion.*

*6.* A cinematic tracking shot of a Ferrari Formula 1 car racing through the iconic Monaco Grand Prix circuit. The camera is fixed on the side of the car that is moving at high speed, capturing the sleek red bodywork glistening under the Mediterranean sun. The reflections of luxury yachts and waterfront buildings shimmer off its polished surface as it roars past. Crowds cheer from balconies and grandstands, while the blur of barriers and trackside advertisements emphasizes the car‚Äôs velocity. The sound design should highlight the high-pitched scream of the F1 engine, echoing against the tight urban walls. The atmosphere is glamorous, fast-paced, and intense, showcasing the thrill of racing in Monaco.

*7. A bustling restaurant kitchen glows under warm overhead lights, filled with the rhythmic clatter of pots, knives, and sizzling pans. In the center, a chef in a crisp white uniform and apron stands over a hot skillet. He lays a thick cut of steak onto the pan, and immediately it begins to sizzle loudly, sending up curls of steam and the rich aroma of searing meat. Beads of oil glisten and pop around the edges as the chef expertly flips the steak with tongs, revealing a perfectly caramelized crust. The camera captures close-up shots of the steak searing, the chef‚Äôs focused expression, and wide shots of the lively kitchen bustling behind him. The mood is intense yet precise, showcasing the artistry and energy of fine dining.*

*8.* A cozy, warmly lit coffee shop interior in the late morning. Sunlight filters through tall windows, casting golden rays across wooden tables and shelves lined with mugs and bags of beans. A young woman in casual clothes steps up to the counter, her posture relaxed but purposeful. Behind the counter, a friendly barista in an apron stands ready, with the soft hiss of the espresso machine punctuating the atmosphere. Other customers chat quietly in the background, their voices blending into a gentle ambient hum. The mood is inviting and everyday-realistic, grounded in natural detail. Woman: ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôll have a cappuccino, please.‚Äù Barista (nodding as he rings it up): ‚ÄúOf course. That‚Äôll be five dollars.‚Äù

Now, here are the main things I noticed:

1. Wan 2.1 is really good at dialogues. You can see that in the last two examples. HOWEVER, you can see in prompt 7 that we didn't even specify any dialogue, though it still did a great job at filling it in. If you want to avoid dialogue, make sure to include keywords like 'dialogue' and 'speaking' in the negative prompt.
2. Amazing camera motion, especially in the way it reveals the steak in example 7, and the way it sticks to the sides of the cars in examples 5 and 6.
3. Very good prompt adherence. If you want a very specific scene, it does a great job at interpreting your prompt, both in the video and the audio. It's also great at filling in details when the prompt is sparse (e.g. first two examples).
4. It's also great at background audio (see examples 4, 5, 6). I've noticed that even if you're not specific in the prompt, it still does a great job at filling in the audio naturally.
5. Finally, it does a great job across different animation styles, from very realistic videos (e.g. the examples with the cars) to beautiful animated looks (e.g. examples 3 and 4).

My name is Nick and I'm a 28 year old guy from Texas. I've posted before but I'm deciding to try something a little bit different this time around and just putting everything in the table, so buckle up and I'm sorry in advance for all of the writing. 

Some things about me, I work for one of the largest investment companies in the US, I've been in the financial field for about 4 and a half years now. Before that, I spent about the same amount of time working in water damage restoration. I am college educated, I actually went back to college for a finance degree, switched to marketing because it was interesting, stayed and plan to stay in finance. Minor mistake. I sit on the asexual spectrum. I'm very big on honesty and not hiding any secrets, ask about anything and everything.

Physically, I am 6 feet tall, I go to the gym but I also like to eat, I'm white, brown hair, brown eyes. Just a pretty generic dude. I wear size 12 shoes but size 13 boots, the boots also make me 6'2 in case I plan on reaching the top-top shelf that day. I have 3 tattoos and plan on getting more. 

Hobbies are kinda scattered here and there. My main two are watching formula 1 every weekend it's on, and playing games primarily on PS5 or PC. I commit to reading a few books a year, I enjoy poetry, every now and then I'll build a Lego, I'm slightly involved in the furry community since I have a good friend who is an artis, I like doing things with my hands, I enjoy making coffee, I like going out to stores and to eat, I have a cat, I keep myself busy most days and out of the house. 

What I'm looking for is something genuine and long term. Yap on reddit for a bit to see if there's a connection, move onto somewhere else. I want yap sessions, if we have similar hobbies then lets do them together, be shoulders to lean on, add to each other's lives, become a positive stone on your path. Be a name that when I think of it or see it, I think of you and smile because that's my friend.

When I replied earlier I was slammed at work along with emotions going crazy so there were things I didn‚Äôt say. For the past two months all I‚Äôve wanted to do was to apologize when we saw each other that last time. Most importantly, I‚Äôve been wanting to apologize that last time I talked to you on the phone. It kills me knowing that the last words spoken to you were lies. I don‚Äôt even know how you can miss or still love me over the mess I made. Since you, I started therapy, she‚Äôs been telling me to grieve you and go through the grieving process‚Ä¶you know how me and grieving goes. She was surprised I haven‚Äôt made it to the anger phase, I refuse to be angry though. She wants me to work on self forgiveness‚Ä¶that is not something I will ever allow myself to do. The mess I left was too great. I‚Äôve tried hiding in my safe place, but there‚Äôs too much silence, and in the silence, the memories start to flow. 
Both of my autoimmune diseases have flared up and there‚Äôs been days I can‚Äôt get out of bed because the pain has been too great and all I can think of is how much better you made me feel on my bad days. I miss how you knew I was overwhelmed without even talking to me and you‚Äôd message me telling me to breathe. Now, when I get overwhelmed I wonder if you can still feel it. Do you still feel my emotions, or have I severed all of it? 
Emotionally, I am doing better. There were several days here a few weeks ago where I felt as if my soul was trying to jump out of my chest and I wondered if you were feeling the same. Some days I even feel as if it‚Äôs trying to communicate with yours, then realize I‚Äôm crazy. I would even get emotional mixing my iced coffee. üòÇ
I miss my friend, I miss my morning books that you always thought annoyed me. I know we will never get that back and I have accepted that. I just don‚Äôt want the last words out of my mouth to you be a lie. This is why I am writing you your first and last book from me. I‚Äôm so sorry. It was all real.

1nutzfc,https://v.redd.it/qjbn3j4haesf1,Wan 2.5 is really really good (native audio generation is awesome!),"I did a bunch of tests to see just how good Wan 2.5 is, and honestly, it seems very close if not comparable to Veo3 in most areas.

First, here are all the prompts for the videos I showed:

*1. The white dragon warrior stands still, eyes full of determination and strength. The camera slowly moves closer or circles around the warrior, highlighting the powerful presence and heroic spirit of the character.*

*2. A lone figure stands on an arctic ridge as the camera pulls back to reveal the Northern Lights dancing across the sky above jagged icebergs.*

*3. The armored knight stands solemnly among towering moss-covered trees, hands resting on the hilt of their sword. Shafts of golden sunlight pierce through the dense canopy, illuminating drifting particles in the air. The camera slowly circles around the knight, capturing the gleam of polished steel and the serene yet powerful presence of the figure. The scene feels sacred and cinematic, with atmospheric depth and a sense of timeless guardianship.*

This third one was image-to-video, all the rest are text-to-video.

*4. Japanese anime style with a cyberpunk aesthetic. A lone figure in a hooded jacket stands on a rain-soaked street at night, neon signs flickering in pink, blue, and green above. The camera tracks slowly from behind as the character walks forward, puddles rippling beneath their boots, reflecting glowing holograms and towering skyscrapers. Crowds of shadowy figures move along the sidewalks, illuminated by shifting holographic billboards. Drones buzz overhead, their red lights cutting through the mist. The atmosphere is moody and futuristic, with a pulsing synthwave soundtrack feel. The art style is detailed and cinematic, with glowing highlights, sharp contrasts, and dramatic framing straight out of a cyberpunk anime film.*

*5. A sleek blue Lamborghini speeds through a long tunnel at golden hour. Sunlight beams directly into the camera as the car approaches the tunnel exit, creating dramatic lens flares and warm highlights across the glossy paint. The camera begins locked in a steady side view of the car, holding the composition as it races forward. As the Lamborghini nears the end of the tunnel, the camera smoothly pulls back, revealing the tunnel opening ahead as golden light floods the frame. The atmosphere is cinematic and dynamic, emphasizing speed, elegance, and the interplay of light and motion.*

*6.* A cinematic tracking shot of a Ferrari Formula 1 car racing through the iconic Monaco Grand Prix circuit. The camera is fixed on the side of the car that is moving at high speed, capturing the sleek red bodywork glistening under the Mediterranean sun. The reflections of luxury yachts and waterfront buildings shimmer off its polished surface as it roars past. Crowds cheer from balconies and grandstands, while the blur of barriers and trackside advertisements emphasizes the car‚Äôs velocity. The sound design should highlight the high-pitched scream of the F1 engine, echoing against the tight urban walls. The atmosphere is glamorous, fast-paced, and intense, showcasing the thrill of racing in Monaco.

*7. A bustling restaurant kitchen glows under warm overhead lights, filled with the rhythmic clatter of pots, knives, and sizzling pans. In the center, a chef in a crisp white uniform and apron stands over a hot skillet. He lays a thick cut of steak onto the pan, and immediately it begins to sizzle loudly, sending up curls of steam and the rich aroma of searing meat. Beads of oil glisten and pop around the edges as the chef expertly flips the steak with tongs, revealing a perfectly caramelized crust. The camera captures close-up shots of the steak searing, the chef‚Äôs focused expression, and wide shots of the lively kitchen bustling behind him. The mood is intense yet precise, showcasing the artistry and energy of fine dining.*

*8.* A cozy, warmly lit coffee shop interior in the late morning. Sunlight filters through tall windows, casting golden rays across wooden tables and shelves lined with mugs and bags of beans. A young woman in casual clothes steps up to the counter, her posture relaxed but purposeful. Behind the counter, a friendly barista in an apron stands ready, with the soft hiss of the espresso machine punctuating the atmosphere. Other customers chat quietly in the background, their voices blending into a gentle ambient hum. The mood is inviting and everyday-realistic, grounded in natural detail. Woman: ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôll have a cappuccino, please.‚Äù Barista (nodding as he rings it up): ‚ÄúOf course. That‚Äôll be five dollars.‚Äù

Now, here are the main things I noticed:

1. Wan 2.1 is really good at dialogues. You can see that in the last two examples. HOWEVER, you can see in prompt 7 that we didn't even specify any dialogue, though it still did a great job at filling it in. If you want to avoid dialogue, make sure to include keywords like 'dialogue' and 'speaking' in the negative prompt.
2. Amazing camera motion, especially in the way it reveals the steak in example 7, and the way it sticks to the sides of the cars in examples 5 and 6.
3. Very good prompt adherence. If you want a very specific scene, it does a great job at interpreting your prompt, both in the video and the audio. It's also great at filling in details when the prompt is sparse (e.g. first two examples).
4. It's also great at background audio (see examples 4, 5, 6). I've noticed that even if you're not specific in the prompt, it still does a great job at filling in the audio naturally.
5. Finally, it does a great job across different animation styles, from very realistic videos (e.g. the examples with the cars) to beautiful animated looks (e.g. examples 3 and 4).

I also made a full tutorial breaking this all down. Feel free to watch :)

1nutyds,https://i.redd.it/chnoc8oaaesf1.jpeg,Review: Woodford Reserve 2025 Master‚Äôs Collection: Sweet Oak Bourbon,"Woodford Reserve 2025 Master‚Äôs Collection: Sweet Oak Bourbon

Release date: September 9, 2025

21st release in the Master‚Äôs Collection

Fully aged in Chinkapin oak barrels (Quercus muehlenbergii)

Chinkapin oak is sometimes referred to as ‚Äúsweet oak‚Äù due to the fact that the acorns have softer tannins and come with a sweeter taste

Early settlers and Native Americans noted that the inner bark and twigs of Chinkapin oak had a mildly sweet flavor, unlike the harsh bitterness of many other oaks

Mashbill: 72% corn, 18% rye, 10% malted barley

Proof: 110.4

MSRP: $179.99 / 700 ml

Nose üëÉ: Stewed plums. Barrel char. Toffee. Unsweetened chai tea.

Palate üëÖ: Toasted hazelnut. Burnt marshmallow. Cranberry sauce. Coffee grounds. Very dry mouthfeel. 

Finish üèÅ: Cocoa nibs. Earl Grey tea. Dried figs.

This is my first time tasting anything aged in Chinkapin oak‚Ä¶ and I find that I do enjoy it. Considering that it is sometime referred to as ‚Äúsweet oak‚Äù, this is definitely more tannic than a lot of bourbons at a similar age. However, the tannins don‚Äôt feel overdone. The charred marshmallow and tart cranberry sauce notes work extremely well with the tannins. 

This is certainly one of the more enjoyable  Master‚Äôs Collection releases I‚Äôve had, but it‚Äôs still not something for which I‚Äôd pay $180. Mark it around $120‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd strongly consider it.

1nutw5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_davidlewisdub/comments/1nutw5r/banish_the_fear_of_rejection/,Banish The Fear Of Rejection,"
Why haven‚Äôt you taken that leap yet? That project, that pitch, that conversation you‚Äôve been dodging what‚Äôs holding you back?

For most of us, it‚Äôs one word: Fear. Specifically, the fear of rejection.
Maybe you‚Äôre thinking, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not afraid of anything.‚Äù But let‚Äôs get real for a second. If rejection wasn‚Äôt lurking in your mind, wouldn‚Äôt you have already sent that manuscript, asked for the date, or shared your big idea with the world? If you truly believed in it, what‚Äôs the holdup?


The Truth About Fear

Fear is great when it‚Äôs saving you from a bear in the woods. But that knot in your stomach before you hit ‚Äúsend‚Äù or pick up the phone? That‚Äôs not fear, it‚Äôs anxiety. And anxiety is just your brain spinning a story about what might happen.

The usual suspects?

‚Ä¢  ‚ÄúWhat if they laugh?‚Äù
‚Ä¢  ‚ÄúWhat if they think I‚Äôm a fraud?‚Äù
‚Ä¢  ‚ÄúWhat if they say no?‚Äù


Here‚Äôs the good news: since your brain‚Äôs writing the script, you can rewrite it. Psychologists say our fear of rejection is wired from ancient times, when being cast out of the tribe meant survival was at stake. But today? A ‚Äúno‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean exile. It‚Äôs just a moment.

So flip the narrative. Instead of picturing a door slamming shut, imagine someone nodding with respect. Picture them thinking, ‚ÄúThat took courage. I‚Äôm impressed.‚Äù Suddenly, the stakes feel a lot lighter.


The Reframe:

A few years ago, I was terrified to pitch a business idea to an old friend. I was sure he‚Äôd think I was chasing a pipe dream. But I took a deep breath and shared it over coffee, not to sell him, but to connect. He didn‚Äôt invest, but he listened, asked questions, and later referred me to someone who did. That moment taught me: success isn‚Äôt about getting a yes. It‚Äôs about showing up and building a bridge.


When you put yourself out there, whether it‚Äôs sharing your art, asking for a promotion, or confessing how you feel, don‚Äôt measure the win by the immediate outcome. Measure it by the courage it took and the connection you fostered.


Most people won‚Äôt mock you. They‚Äôll admire your guts. Some might even say yes because you dared to ask. After twenty years of pitching ideas, chasing dreams, and having tough conversations, I‚Äôve never lost a friend over it.
   
                  Here‚Äôs how I do it:

1.  Stay chill. Say upfront, ‚ÄúHey, this might not be your thing, and that‚Äôs cool.‚Äù No pressure, no pushiness.
2.  Listen first. Ask about their world‚Äîtheir goals, their struggles‚Äîbefore you dive in.
3.  Show gratitude. Yes or no, thank them for their time. It‚Äôs about respect, not a transaction.

Follow these, and you‚Äôll come off as a friend, not a salesperson. You might even turn a ‚Äúno‚Äù into a future ‚Äúyes‚Äù‚Äîor something better, like a real relationship.


Your Move

Rejection only exists if you let it define you. So stop burning energy on a fear that‚Äôs just a shadow in your head.
Choose courage instead. Choose curiosity. Choose the thrill of putting yourself out there.
Next time you hesitate‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs sending that email, sharing your work, or speaking your truth‚Äîtake a second and remind yourself:


‚Ä¢  This isn‚Äôt about fear.
‚Ä¢  This is about connection.
‚Ä¢  This is about building something bigger than a single answer.

So pick up the phone. Hit send. Say the words. You‚Äôve got this.

Lots of Love,

Woman: ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôll have a cappuccino, please.‚Äù Barista (nodding as he rings it up): ‚ÄúOf course. That‚Äôll be five dollars.‚Äù

Now, here are the main things I noticed:

1. Wan 2.1 is really good at dialogues. You can see that in the last two examples. HOWEVER, you can see in prompt 7 that we didn't even specify any dialogue, though it still did a great job at filling it in. If you want to avoid dialogue, make sure to include keywords like 'dialogue' and 'speaking' in the negative prompt.
2. Amazing camera motion, especially in the way it reveals the steak in example 7, and the way it sticks to the sides of the cars in examples 5 and 6.
3. Very good prompt adherence. If you want a very specific scene, it does a great job at interpreting your prompt, both in the video and the audio. It's also great at filling in details when the prompt is sparse (e.g. first two examples).
4. It's also great at background audio (see examples 4, 5, 6). I've noticed that even if you're not specific in the prompt, it still does a great job at filling in the audio naturally.
5. Finally, it does a great job across different animation styles, from very realistic videos (e.g. the examples with the cars) to beautiful animated looks (e.g. examples 3 and 4).

I also made a full tutorial breaking this all down. Feel free to watch :)

1nutrnj,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0OVgXw72KI,Wan 2.5 is really really good (native audio generation is awesome!),"I did a bunch of tests to see just how good Wan 2.5 is, and honestly, it seems very close if not comparable to Veo3 in most areas.

First, here are all the prompts for the videos I showed:

*1. The white dragon warrior stands still, eyes full of determination and strength. The camera slowly moves closer or circles around the warrior, highlighting the powerful presence and heroic spirit of the character.*

*2. A lone figure stands on an arctic ridge as the camera pulls back to reveal the Northern Lights dancing across the sky above jagged icebergs.*

*3. The armored knight stands solemnly among towering moss-covered trees, hands resting on the hilt of their sword. Shafts of golden sunlight pierce through the dense canopy, illuminating drifting particles in the air. The camera slowly circles around the knight, capturing the gleam of polished steel and the serene yet powerful presence of the figure. The scene feels sacred and cinematic, with atmospheric depth and a sense of timeless guardianship.*

This third one was image-to-video, all the rest are text-to-video.

*4. Japanese anime style with a cyberpunk aesthetic. A lone figure in a hooded jacket stands on a rain-soaked street at night, neon signs flickering in pink, blue, and green above. The camera tracks slowly from behind as the character walks forward, puddles rippling beneath their boots, reflecting glowing holograms and towering skyscrapers. Crowds of shadowy figures move along the sidewalks, illuminated by shifting holographic billboards. Drones buzz overhead, their red lights cutting through the mist. The atmosphere is moody and futuristic, with a pulsing synthwave soundtrack feel. The art style is detailed and cinematic, with glowing highlights, sharp contrasts, and dramatic framing straight out of a cyberpunk anime film.*

*5. A sleek blue Lamborghini speeds through a long tunnel at golden hour. Sunlight beams directly into the camera as the car approaches the tunnel exit, creating dramatic lens flares and warm highlights across the glossy paint. The camera begins locked in a steady side view of the car, holding the composition as it races forward. As the Lamborghini nears the end of the tunnel, the camera smoothly pulls back, revealing the tunnel opening ahead as golden light floods the frame. The atmosphere is cinematic and dynamic, emphasizing speed, elegance, and the interplay of light and motion.*

*6.* A cinematic tracking shot of a Ferrari Formula 1 car racing through the iconic Monaco Grand Prix circuit. The camera is fixed on the side of the car that is moving at high speed, capturing the sleek red bodywork glistening under the Mediterranean sun. The reflections of luxury yachts and waterfront buildings shimmer off its polished surface as it roars past. Crowds cheer from balconies and grandstands, while the blur of barriers and trackside advertisements emphasizes the car‚Äôs velocity. The sound design should highlight the high-pitched scream of the F1 engine, echoing against the tight urban walls. The atmosphere is glamorous, fast-paced, and intense, showcasing the thrill of racing in Monaco.

*7. A bustling restaurant kitchen glows under warm overhead lights, filled with the rhythmic clatter of pots, knives, and sizzling pans. In the center, a chef in a crisp white uniform and apron stands over a hot skillet. He lays a thick cut of steak onto the pan, and immediately it begins to sizzle loudly, sending up curls of steam and the rich aroma of searing meat. Beads of oil glisten and pop around the edges as the chef expertly flips the steak with tongs, revealing a perfectly caramelized crust. The camera captures close-up shots of the steak searing, the chef‚Äôs focused expression, and wide shots of the lively kitchen bustling behind him. The mood is intense yet precise, showcasing the artistry and energy of fine dining.*

*8.* A cozy, warmly lit coffee shop interior in the late morning. Sunlight filters through tall windows, casting golden rays across wooden tables and shelves lined with mugs and bags of beans. A young woman in casual clothes steps up to the counter, her posture relaxed but purposeful. Behind the counter, a friendly barista in an apron stands ready, with the soft hiss of the espresso machine punctuating the atmosphere. Other customers chat quietly in the background, their voices blending into a gentle ambient hum. The mood is inviting and everyday-realistic, grounded in natural detail. Woman: ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôll have a cappuccino, please.‚Äù Barista (nodding as he rings it up): ‚ÄúOf course. That‚Äôll be five dollars.‚Äù

Let me know if there are any questions!",0,1759277767.0,OpenAI,0,0.25,False
1nuto7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/PLL_Ezria/comments/1nuto7u/rewatch_tuesday_s1ep5_reality_bites_me/,Rewatch Tuesday - S1.Ep5: Reality Bites Me,"So I forgot it was Tuesday. It is still Tuesday at some places so‚Ä¶ it is a mix of Tuesday and Wednesday. Still rewatch though.

Aria tells to the liars about the letter. Aria doesn't believe her dad will leave, the girls support her. They are on their way to clean the mirror, Hanna gets A's message ‚ÄúEver wonder what's going on when your back is turned?‚Äù And it even has an attachment! From inside Spence's closet when they saw the mirror. When they go and open the closet something falls. I thought it would be like a camera tripod that fell or something but it was jungle red lipstick.

In Montgomery house, Mike says to Aria that their parents are acting weird and downstairs, they are acting weird. Ella is right like asking her ‚ÄúDo you want me to move out?‚Äù you don't ask that. Aria comes, Ella stops the conversation and Byron wishes her good luck for the test and leaves for work. Aria says Mike knew something was happening and that she doesn't want to hide it from him as well cause she knew it for a year and dad told her to keep it a secret. Ella is shocked cause he didn't told her. Aria acting like ‚ÄúYou should tell Mike cause I don't wanna hide it from him‚Äù isn't the best approach, it's like putting the blame to her.

Hanna is on the street, she probably bought uniform for the job. Sean meets her and he says he will pay for the car and take the blame but she says she will handle it cause it's her fault. Also she will face her fear for the children and they laugh about that. She asks him if they will go to homecoming, he seems awkward and is mostly negative, he says he will think about it. A woman in a car comes and he says it's his ride and leaves. Hanna looks jealous which is understandable.

Liars are in the school hall, Spence doubts Jenna came to her house cause she would need more than a talking GBS. FunnyüòÇ
Aria says she wouldn't be alone, Em says to not go to Toby place. Spence is once again talking bad about Toby. The professor comes and says Spencer won the golden orchid, which he doesn't know but it's for stolen paper from Melissa. The girls are supporting her without realizing she is so awkward and stressed about it.

Em and Toby in the lab are doing science stuff. Em says she had to much coffee but not enough sleep. ‚ÄúBig party on a Thursday night?‚Äù Good answer but they usually have these kind of late stuff the last weeks‚Ä¶ She asks him and he says he was doing his homework at the Grill cause Jenna listens to her lectures loudly cause she doesn't wanna use her headphones at home. Well if she uses them when she isn't home understandable to don't want to use them in her house as well but the fact that it makes Toby going out of the house to study is like‚Ä¶ too much. Toby supposes she stayed at Maya and Em says she is more her friend than the groups cause she cares about different things. Likes different‚Ä¶ so the different is Em? Toby says he likes different cause that city has a lot of the same. I really love his opinions so much!!

Aria comes into Ezra's classroom, he says he was thinking about her, so cute!!! He asks about her family and she says it's tense and would like a reason to not go home. He says he can't stay late cause he has this ‚Äúthing‚Äù. What?! And acts awkward and‚Ä¶ mystical. ‚ÄúIt's not a thing, it's just‚Ä¶ a thing‚Äù And this guys is an English teacher!! And it's a reading of a story. Wait a minute, he had said he tried writing but didn't go well. What happened to that?! And she asks to come, he's sceptical cause he afraids he will embarrass himself. Cute actually!

Hanna starts her work at the dentist place, the shirt has print of germs‚Ä¶ Wow‚Ä¶ She really looks good on hideous. The look in her face when the doors open and Jenna comes in‚Ä¶ She got scared and stepped back, then she went near her to check her lipstick, if it's jungle red I guess. Jenna understanding the presence like obviously you were too close Hanna!

Spence comes home from practice and get dad tells her the buttercreams that are her favorite and she corrects him when she was 7. Then says thanks daddy, oh my cute little Spence! And asks if he talk to Wren, possibly hoping that he understood she doesn't fault that much and wanted to give her something sweet for the stuff she's been through‚Ä¶

But he says he talked to Sheldrake. Her face when he says about the newsletter ad like tell me about shock and stress. ‚ÄúI'm proud of you Spence‚Äù The emotions she feels all this time that he congratulates her on an essay she didn't wrote‚Ä¶ Like once again she is worse than her sister because it's her essay. He says he wants to play double with her with a potential client in the club. The happiness in her face, and her asking him if he wants to volley but he's too busy. The amount of emotionally neglected that girl is‚Ä¶

Hanna is into spying mode and follows Jenna to see she uses the elevator so Han goes to snoop around opening doors but the security guy finds her.

To lab class again. He likes being in school when no one else is. It really looks so creepy but honestly he's misjudged by people. Em likes his drawings and find their mutual interest in band Circus survive. He says he will bring her a CD of another band. I love their friendship.

Ezra ends with he's reading, a man near Aria opens a conversation with her about him and tells her they go way back cause they were sleeping together. Interesting information. You will share that later. He continues to give more context in that easily misunderstood sentence that they were in bunk beds college. The fact that he recognizes she's a fangirl for him even if he said it jokingly‚Ä¶ Ezra is surprised he sees Hardy. He calls her the President of his fanclub. She honestly is üòÇ The laugh on Aria's face and the light in her eyes because of Ezra's jokes‚Ä¶ So amazing!!

Spence practices tennis at the club. A person who works there tells her he should close the courts 10 minutes ago and she says if he could give her 5 more minutes. Is she for real?! Like come on!! Tell me about putting a person in a bad position.

Ezra practices arrows ‚ÄúYou can't get serious from the sociology stacks‚Äù I'm dying, so you went to science or something?! So he takes her to his dorm room, Ezra was probably sleeping and during them having fun, Ezra started laughing in his sleep. Aria thought it was cute. Which really is!! I bet Hardy felt awkward. Aria goes to get water. Hardy gives Ezra the look. ‚ÄúDude‚Ä¶ you're so screwed‚Ä¶‚Äù I love that line, he read the room so good!! ‚ÄúIt's not what you think it is‚Äù Hardy gives another look. Like are you joking?! Then he judges he's choices and he's warning him.

Marin house. Kid aimed at Hanna for rinse and spit?!üò≠ Like is this usual for kids? So disappointing üòÇ And now her problem is a cheerleader that likes skinny lattes? Oh it's Sean's ride! She's feeding you cause it's pivotal for your survival. Ashley is upset that Tom will marry Isabel, even if she's trying to act cool about it.

A sends a message as soon as Ashley leaves that now she knows two secrets, Hanna got dissed and Emily got kissed. Has A got cameras in their houses? Check your closets. It could be Ben, for all she knows. She answers ‚ÄúWho is it?‚Äù The one who kissed? Why did she ask? A sent the kiss photos and she was shocked.

Spencer is showing to Hanna the lipstick and she says it's the one Jenna wore. Well, people can wear the same lipstick‚Ä¶ So she thinks Jenna has a bunch of lipsticks jungle red and she's spreading them in houses? Also why does Hanna think it was an empty room? Maybe the person left before Jenna.

Call the police? Are you insane? We don't do this at this series. Hanna says the logical thing that they would find their fingerprints. Hanna notices Toby reading a book across the grill. Em comes inside and would go to Toby but Spence sees her and tells her to come. Poor Toby, he definitely felt so sad and rejected. They tell the news to Em and Toby leaves.

Aria and Ezra go into his house. Aria wonders about the college boys being like that in the bar. He seems disconnected and says when she'll go to college, she will find out by herself. Aria understands something is up and asks if Hardy said something. ‚ÄúDid I do anything to embarrass you‚Äù Oh my cute Aria so considerate! Such a sad question in my opinion, feeling like she embarrassed him. Aria is true about Hardy noticed, doesn't mean everyone will. Aria tries for him to act considering his feelings not the theory and he doesn't know if he talks himself in or out of this. Honestly pretty confusing. He probably settles in being together for now and they kiss.

Back to the girls, Spence leaves because of the early tennis day with her dad and she doesn't know what to wear. Aren't outfits specific? She tells them she met a boy. The one that let you 15 more minutes! A waitress gives the CD to Em cause someone left this, Hanna asks and she says somebody from school. Han thinks it's Maya and says that whoever must like her a lot. Em corrects her that they were talking about a band they both like. Hanna asks if she likes back the person and she is hesitant on answering. Hanna reasures Em that if someone cares about her, she's happy whoever it is. Em feels relieved but doesn't actually know who she talks about.

Ezria kissing. Ezra doesn't want her to go, she says she will come back and cook enhanced macaroni and cheese. But don't keeps the hope up. And that was in the hallway. Like aren't you scared?!

Em listens the CD in her bed. 
It's morning and Spencer comes to the kitchen, dad makes some kind of juice for him and Spence. Nice move. He says to Spence to keep it friendly on the court. So it was bribing? ‚ÄúWhy does everyone think I'm unfriendly?‚Äù So true honestly. He's says he's serious and she has to dial it back. She was there for 5 hours swatting balls. Oh my poor darling. She tried so hard to be better for him and he asks her to tame down her awesomeness. Now they play and he even told her easy cause it was too far.

Hanna is at the building, she opened a door with I don't know what key and found a person who thinks she's Martha. He's a psychotherapist. But she said her therapist out loud. And he noticed and says ‚ÄúIs there someone else joining us today?‚Äù He thought she's hallucinating or something. Hanna then says Martha doesn't need therapy and leaves. Okay first of all, you don't know Martha and her needs, but nice way to get out of there. Also won't be understand that Martha looks different when she comes later? Or he doesn't have good memory.

Montgomery house, the parents are fighting downstairs, Mike comes in Aria's room and says they are fighting, she tells him to get ready to go to the library. Ella is so true about Meredith. Byron is talking about trust like come on! He says he won't let her take what matters the most to him. Honestly in this conversation Byron's excuses are on the bottom of the sea and Ella's frustration is understandable. Sure it stresses Mike but that's life, people fight and either work out or not.

At the tennis game, it ends, the boy looks at them, Peter is wondering why, they leave and he talks to Spence. Spencer saying he's not always like this. Yeah, he usually tries to push them to do the best whatever the cost. He said he sees a lot like that. So why do you question it? Spence tells him to hang out of there. Pretty cool!
Marin house. ‚ÄúYou're breathing, you're going‚Äù pretty awesome advice. Ashley tells Hanna to not give too much, she had too much pride to tell him that she wanted him back. Yeah, this happens and it's really bad. Communication is the key.

Aria goes to Ezra's apartment and asks for her phone but he's upset cause he found out about A cause messaged ‚ÄúOther girls have to do their homework, you get to do the teacher‚Äù Well at least A's funny, you know? ‚ÄúIf A knows B and C and everybody else will know‚Äù Understandable but it's not like that in this occasion. He doesn't believe she didn't tell anyone and sends her out. I mean I get how he feels but she truly doesn't fault.

Hanna once again in the building, how could she not opened the door before Sean arrived? Hanna isn't wrong for thinking it could be over between her and Sean, like he didn't talked to her after the accident or like hangout like they were. He says he joined the club Real love waits and she decides to join the next meeting. Nice idea to try his way, I mean it's a chance to actually see him.

Hastings house and Peter wants Spence to celebrate for the essay and the game. That to her means the essay she stole and the game she didn't showed her true self. He says things almost didn't get well cause he didn't reserved a table and had to tell the manager Alex forgot to call it in. I mean like what?! Blame it on a person who does he's job when it's your fault?! Spence is upset and like obviously! ‚ÄúJust did what I had to do‚Äù Wow, yeah it seems you are both so competitive, it runs in the family. Spence though was so true, no need to celebrate it, like he does, the look on his face when she tells she stole the essay‚Ä¶ priceless!

To the grill, Toby reads a book, Em goes to him and says sorry and gives him a mix she made for him. So cute!! Spence and Alex hang out, Aria with Mike watch a movie.

1nutnkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1nutnkb/am_i_missing_something_coping_with_sensitivity/,Am I missing something? Coping with sensitivity,"My 5th grader has almost always had an issue with loud environments. Public restrooms with automatic flushers and hand dryers, running the vacuum, waiting for a coffee order in a crowded cafe, etc‚Ä¶all of these would scare him or make him physically act out. 

He‚Äôs got an adhd dx as well as anxiety. He went through all the testing and questionnaires for the school district and the pediatrician, and there was no ASD identified. About 3 years ago we had a really awful day at the movies with full on sobbing from the volume. And multiple times he had huge upsets from screaming kids at the playground. He started wearing earmuffs at school on the playground and in the cafeteria and basically as needed. Loop earplugs were considered except he lost his first pair super fast. 

His pediatrician has recommended we try occupational therapy or play therapy. We‚Äôve been trying OT but just found out our copay is $100/weekly session instead of 30. And they seem more focused on his eye contact and shyness. We‚Äôre going down to just one session every 2 weeks. 

I keep wondering why his dr thinks this is a problem play therapy or OT can solve. 
He started karate tonight which is held in a racket ball court with extreme reverb. He did his best without them for 30 minutes before running out to me crying (because when told to take them off he didn‚Äôt speak up or ask for my help). Is OT supposed to help him just ignore the intensity? 

Thank you if you‚Äôve read this far. His dad and I are getting anxious about middle school. His peers at this school are amazing‚Ä¶but I‚Äôd like to give him his best shot when they feed into the bigger school. ",3,1759277672.0,breakingmom,3,1.0,False
1nutnhn,https://v.redd.it/c1ad497k7esf1,Wan 2.5 is really really good (native audio generation is awesome!),"I did a bunch of tests to see just how good Wan 2.5 is, and honestly, it seems very close if not comparable to Veo3 in most areas.

First, here are all the prompts for the videos I showed:

*1. The white dragon warrior stands still, eyes full of determination and strength. The camera slowly moves closer or circles around the warrior, highlighting the powerful presence and heroic spirit of the character.*

*2. A lone figure stands on an arctic ridge as the camera pulls back to reveal the Northern Lights dancing across the sky above jagged icebergs.*

*3. The armored knight stands solemnly among towering moss-covered trees, hands resting on the hilt of their sword. Shafts of golden sunlight pierce through the dense canopy, illuminating drifting particles in the air. The camera slowly circles around the knight, capturing the gleam of polished steel and the serene yet powerful presence of the figure. The scene feels sacred and cinematic, with atmospheric depth and a sense of timeless guardianship.*

This third one was image-to-video, all the rest are text-to-video.

*4. Japanese anime style with a cyberpunk aesthetic. A lone figure in a hooded jacket stands on a rain-soaked street at night, neon signs flickering in pink, blue, and green above. The camera tracks slowly from behind as the character walks forward, puddles rippling beneath their boots, reflecting glowing holograms and towering skyscrapers. Crowds of shadowy figures move along the sidewalks, illuminated by shifting holographic billboards. Drones buzz overhead, their red lights cutting through the mist. The atmosphere is moody and futuristic, with a pulsing synthwave soundtrack feel. The art style is detailed and cinematic, with glowing highlights, sharp contrasts, and dramatic framing straight out of a cyberpunk anime film.*

*5. A sleek blue Lamborghini speeds through a long tunnel at golden hour. Sunlight beams directly into the camera as the car approaches the tunnel exit, creating dramatic lens flares and warm highlights across the glossy paint. The camera begins locked in a steady side view of the car, holding the composition as it races forward. As the Lamborghini nears the end of the tunnel, the camera smoothly pulls back, revealing the tunnel opening ahead as golden light floods the frame. The atmosphere is cinematic and dynamic, emphasizing speed, elegance, and the interplay of light and motion.*

*6.* A cinematic tracking shot of a Ferrari Formula 1 car racing through the iconic Monaco Grand Prix circuit. The camera is fixed on the side of the car that is moving at high speed, capturing the sleek red bodywork glistening under the Mediterranean sun. The reflections of luxury yachts and waterfront buildings shimmer off its polished surface as it roars past. Crowds cheer from balconies and grandstands, while the blur of barriers and trackside advertisements emphasizes the car‚Äôs velocity. The sound design should highlight the high-pitched scream of the F1 engine, echoing against the tight urban walls. The atmosphere is glamorous, fast-paced, and intense, showcasing the thrill of racing in Monaco.

*7. A bustling restaurant kitchen glows under warm overhead lights, filled with the rhythmic clatter of pots, knives, and sizzling pans. In the center, a chef in a crisp white uniform and apron stands over a hot skillet. He lays a thick cut of steak onto the pan, and immediately it begins to sizzle loudly, sending up curls of steam and the rich aroma of searing meat. Beads of oil glisten and pop around the edges as the chef expertly flips the steak with tongs, revealing a perfectly caramelized crust. The camera captures close-up shots of the steak searing, the chef‚Äôs focused expression, and wide shots of the lively kitchen bustling behind him. The mood is intense yet precise, showcasing the artistry and energy of fine dining.*

*8.* A cozy, warmly lit coffee shop interior in the late morning. Sunlight filters through tall windows, casting golden rays across wooden tables and shelves lined with mugs and bags of beans. A young woman in casual clothes steps up to the counter, her posture relaxed but purposeful. Behind the counter, a friendly barista in an apron stands ready, with the soft hiss of the espresso machine punctuating the atmosphere. Other customers chat quietly in the background, their voices blending into a gentle ambient hum. The mood is inviting and everyday-realistic, grounded in natural detail. Woman: ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôll have a cappuccino, please.‚Äù Barista (nodding as he rings it up): ‚ÄúOf course. That‚Äôll be five dollars.‚Äù

Now, here are the main things I noticed:

1. Wan 2.1 is really good at dialogues. You can see that in the last two examples. HOWEVER, you can see in prompt 7 that we didn't even specify any dialogue, though it still did a great job at filling it in. If you want to avoid dialogue, make sure to include keywords like 'dialogue' and 'speaking' in the negative prompt.
2. Amazing camera motion, especially in the way it reveals the steak in example 7, and the way it sticks to the sides of the cars in examples 5 and 6.
3. Very good prompt adherence. If you want a very specific scene, it does a great job at interpreting your prompt, both in the video and the audio. It's also great at filling in details when the prompt is sparse (e.g. first two examples).
4. It's also great at background audio (see examples 4, 5, 6). I've noticed that even if you're not specific in the prompt, it still does a great job at filling in the audio naturally.
5. Finally, it does a great job across different animation styles, from very realistic videos (e.g. the examples with the cars) to beautiful animated looks (e.g. examples 3 and 4).

I also made a full tutorial breaking this all down. Feel free to watch :)

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don‚Äôt mind where you are located don‚Äôt let the distance put you off 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I‚Äôm really not interested I don‚Äôt know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it‚Äôs not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I‚Äôd never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I‚Äôd prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don‚Äôt wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don‚Äôt just say hi or hello I‚Äôm unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

1nutmsh,https://i.redd.it/181l87eh7esf1.jpeg,Review E5 Frame with White Chipboard Desk,"I got this desk a little over two months ago as I was in the final stages of my dissertation, spending a lot of time at my desk. In short, I have almost no complaints, and they're minor.

To start, installation was mostly very simple plug and play. There were minimal holes aligning between the middle of the desk and the bar underneath it, so I just had to drill my own holes. But the holes have a plate perpendicular to them that is too close so actually it's very difficult to drill unless you have a long bit or extension. I did one or two this way and then ended up just screwing in any remaining screws manually with a screwdriver and some elbow grease, no pilot holes - it turned out fine, no splitting or anything. Aside from that, everything went smoothly.

There was a small scratch at the back of the desk (literally the 1"" back wall, not top or bottom), but other than that, no cosmetic flaws. I will say I hate the flexispot logos on the sides though. It looks very clean and just blends in with everything and then bam, huge shiny flexispot logos. 

In terms of durability, I can't see any scratches or blemishes so far. This desk also doubles as my dining table (I know...), I've had plenty of drinks hot and cold on it, some coffee and soda rings from just being a gross person, some minor spills, and everything has cleaned off easily and perfectly with no stains and no rings from the hot or cold drinks with no coasters. I also have done very minor mechanical work, stuff that would leave little chips on my old cheap table, but so far I've noticed not a single scratch. 

I chose this specific frame over the even cheaper ones because I wanted something that went as low as this one did. I have long arms and this allows me to have them at a comfortable angle, without needing any additional attachment to have the keyboard and mouse sit lower. It definitely goes low enough, I never bottom it out, but it's nice to have a lot of wiggle room. 

At sitting heights, it is perfectly stable. But at standing heights, it 100 percent leads to wobble in my monitor. For context, my monitor is just sitting on top of the desk, not on an arm or anything, and the frame is on carpet - I am pretty sure these are contributing factors, so it isn't entirely the desk's fault. I do find it a little annoying, but at least for me, I don't use it standing up too often. Maybe a 20/80 ratio standing/sitting. If you're someone who knows they really will be using the ""standing"" desk primarily for standing, then it might be worth getting the beefier ones which promise more stability. For me, I can live with a little wobble.

I believe it has some sort of safety stop when going up or down if something obstructs - or this may only be going down. I once clicked a preset for it to raise up but the armrest from my chair was over the desk. It didn't stop, and led to a bit of things tumbling and breaking. I was a bit surprised that it didn't stop once it felt a great deal of resistance, but maybe the stop feature is only when it senses obstruction going down. 

Overall I just find it a pleasant and comfortable desk to work at. ",2,1759277613.0,FlexiSpot_Official,1,1.0,False

1nutjs7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bellingham/comments/1nutjs7/since_trees_are_on_everyones_mind/,Since trees are on everyone's mind...,"How to Care For Your Arborist

This article is to serve as a companion piece to the propagation of arborists and tree worker species posted earlier in the week.

Arborists, as the name implies, are an arboreal species of mammal that range anywhere trees exist. Chances are, if you have a large tree encroaching on your property, you will not need to wait long to spot one or more of these creatures in their natural habitat. While they are most often spotted in heavily wooded suburbs or new developments encroaching on forested land, it is possible to find them in urban settings as well.

As a tree dwelling species, they are most often seen high in the canopies of evergreens, though it is also possible to find one that has taken up residence in a large cottonwood, elm, maple, et cetera. There, they can avoid their natural predators, such as an LNI or OSHA inspector, or perhaps a nosey neighbor with a master gardener certificate. Rarely, you may spot a dispossessed or injured arborist in a hedge, or small ornamental tree, but it is imperative to never approach this creature, for it is unhappy and threatened to be on the ground, churlish, and ill-tempered.

The species is believed to spontaneously form and incubate within the trunks of large, dying evergreens, though they have been observed emerging from large deciduous trees as well. This is far less common. The exact mechanism for this reproduction is not entirely understood at this time, though, some researchers have postulated it could be through the interaction of sap, pollen, myecellium, and quantum foam.

If you've noticed that arborists have infested your tree and you wish to lure or coax them away, it is possible to do so with copious amounts of energy drinks, coffee, nicotine and money. It is assumed that arborists enjoy the tactile sensation of their pockets filled to the brim with paper money, perhaps because it comforts and reminds them of their arboreal homes. They have also been observed drinking fermented beverages of barley and hops, as well as other fermented liquids, perhaps as a salve to sore backs, hips, and knees from vigorous climbing.

Further, if you wish to avoid an arborist infestation, it is recommended to plant holly, Hawthorne, locust or monkey puzzles on your property. While they may retreat into these trees in times of desperation, the thorny nature of these species of trees will generally keep an arborist from taking up residence.

That being said, one sure way to guarantee an arborist infestation is to build a deck, patio, or fence directly underneath a tree that you wish to have removed. Scientists still don't understand this seemingly ethereal connexion between arborists and brand new structures built beneath old trees, yet this very act will draw them to your property in droves. It is important not to approach these creatures too closely as well, for they are incensed by the proximity of the structure to the tree.

A properly cared for arborist, however, will ensure proper health and safety of your trees on the property, as well as maintain its natural aesthetics.

I hope that you've found this PSA informative, and that you too are now armed with the knowledge to manage, or observe arborists in their natural habitat.",3,1759277378.0,Bellingham,0,0.64,False

***

**_Hydration Game Cheat Codes_**

1. _Start Your Day With 20‚Äì30 oz_

Before food, before coffee. Wake your organs up right.

**Quick tip**- You wake up dehydrated by default. Rehydrating before anything else turns your system back on.

2. _Add Minerals_

Pure water flushes. Water with minerals absorbs. Add Himalayan salt, lemon, or electrolytes.

**Quick tip**- Water alone doesn‚Äôt hydrate as well without electrolytes. This locks it in

3. _Carry a Jug You Can Track_

Drink half your bodyweight in ounces daily (if you weigh 180, aim for 90 oz) 

**Quick tip**- Get a 32 oz jug = 3‚Äì4 fills a day = done. No second guessing.

4. _Pair With Habits_

	‚Ä¢	Before meals
	‚Ä¢	After peeing
	‚Ä¢	While scrolling
	‚Ä¢	Between sets

5. _Go Warm or Room Temp_

Better gut absorption , Smoother digestion, less  bloating or gut tension, especially in the morning.

**Quick tip**- Cold water can slow digestion. Warm water passes through cleaner and gets absorbed faster.

6. _Watch Your Urine_

Light yellow = you‚Äôre good. 

Dark = behind. 

Clear = overdoing it.

7. _Hydration makes everything else more effective_

	‚Ä¢	L-citrulline(pure) hits harder with water
	‚Ä¢	Beet powder flows better with water
	‚Ä¢	Zinc Picolinate, magnesium glycinate, and creatine need water to transport
	‚Ä¢	Sleep and blood flow quality both depend on hydration status

""So, we're going to drop out of warp in a steep dive into the target star, which I'll be calling Bob, for fun. We want to be on roughly a tangent line to Bob's core, not his surface. The timing will be tricky, because we need to get that cruiser to chase us down a bit outside of a warp bubble, all while dodging a full impact from the tadpole. When he hit the surface of the sun, and only then, do we drop the payload. After that, we dodge enemy fire for a moment longer, and when the payload has descended low enough..."" The computer simulated animation showed the sun exploded and the little dot representing us riding the shock wave out. ""We lean into it and surf to victory."" 

""The payload... Dare I ask what it is?"" Captain Kim was clearly nursing a hangover. Gerwerpterk had it worse next to him. At least the Captain's head was up. Gerwerpterk was here, physically, but not exactly present for duty. 

""It's all the grav plates, Captain, save a handful in engineering, a handful on the bridge, and the ones needed for the engines and shield systems to not flatten. She wants to strap every single one we can spare to shuttle one and set the warp core to overload into them."" Chief Shard was not pleased with my plan, but he had to admit, the math checked out. It would blow up the star, temperatures would reach well in excess of fifty million degrees in the area we'd be. ""Also, it'll be vac suits for everyone-""

I cut in, ""Which is fine, because we won't want to be wasting power on lifesupport anyway. We're gonna need every last bit of juice we can get for shields. Either way we're probably all gonna die when we blow up the Bob-bomb. Which is why we're going to pack shuttle two with as many of the crew as we can, and they are gonna zip off and away with all the data we've collected a second or two before we drop out of warp. I've already made the modification specs for the shuttle to hit warp thirteen, briefly. Chief Shard's boys are already working on it.""
 
""Even a few seconds at that speed will have them halfway back to starbase one thirty two."" Captain Kim's hungover math was pretty good.

""Good news there, they'll have about thirty seconds before they burn out the engine. Should be plenty to get them back some place with enough life support capacity to sustain them all. Also, we're going to attach a pair of large cargo pods to the shuttle to stuff full of crew, like sardines. We just need a skeleton crew left on the ship. Bridge crew, plus four people in engineering. Ten total, myself included. I'll be in engineering.""

""Great. I'm not exactly loving this so far, but you've hit my main concern, the crew. As for us damned souls remaining on the ship, what's our plan of attempting survival?"" Captain Kim took a big swig of his black coffee. 

""We're going to juice up the remaining shield emitter with the secondary warp core, and put as much of the ship's plating and bulkheads and mass as we possibly can between us and the star's core, try to ride it out like surfing a wave. I won't lie, it'll be ablative armor, the shields will protect us from being cooked alive, so long as they hold, and there' s pretty good odds they won't..""

""And why aren't we warping out?"" Gerwerpterk *was* alive.

""The tadpole is probably going to end up attaching some chunks of space beef to the bottom of the ship soon as we drop out of warp. Tadpole will fire some chunks at us like railgun rounds. We're gonna get hit, but at least we can decide where they hit. We can *probably* dodge the whole thing hitting us, but I got a feeling we are going to have to cook off the bottom of the ship one way or another. And the last thing we want to do is feed these things your tech. They learn from it the more they devour.""

""Alright everyone, you heard Jimmi's plan. We have five days until the flesh cruiser catches up to us at... ugh... Bob star."" Captain Kim knocked back the rest of his coffee, ""Lets go ruin my first command."" 
___

The next five days were a lot of hard work, done by stressed out professionals. The FAP's training was robust, vigorous, and finally, exhausting. But as a result of that past shared adversity, all these species worked well together, like a well lubricated machine. I heard very little complaining about the difficulty of the tasks at hand. They were doing extra-vehicular activities inside a warp bubble. Technically safe work... but no one likes doing it for long. 

No one. And for good reason.

Spending too long exposed to the subspace wall of a warp bubble can drive any sapient being to madness. The 'subspace crazies' afflicts all space faring, warp using species. Watching video of the subspace wall does nothing, only actually being there, outside the ship does it. A good six inches of space ship hull is plenty to stop the effect. As a result, warp ships have no real windows, only cameras and screens. Actual windows lets the subspace crazies in, but nice high def screens are cheap to run, and do wonders for the crew. Even internal rooms can have 'windows' to view the outside. 

Subspace crazies aside, it probably didn't help that when outside you could look aft in the warp bubble and see the gaping maw of the tadpole, seemingly locked in time. One of the redder of neck gaians chose to show us otherwise by whipping a piece of slag metal at it in a fit of pique (they dragged him inside shortly after). A tentacle shot out of the mouth and snatched up that bit of metal as it approached, and then we all heard the sensor snail's report. 

""Whatever that was, it allowed the tadpole to get almost a whole meter closer to us when it caught it."" He paused for a moment, I think for dramatic effect. ""Lets make sure nothing else falls that way.""

The Gaians, no great surprise, had gone with ships with a big saucer section. They had tried - early on - to make two big pylons out the back to house the warp drive components, but the math just wasn't with them on it. Instead their ship design doctrine tended to produce large saucers with top and bottom engine clusters. 

The FSS Magellan entered warp looking like a standard federation vessel, a frisbee with rockets strapped on it, but she'd exit it with much of her mass down along the bottom as ablative heat shielding, looking much more like a flying skyscraper. She's gonna fly like shit, but ten decks thick worth of ablative armor might just be enough.

When we were half way to finished, I took a moment to... *relax* in my quarters. We'd already stripped the halls, and a number of the workshops and science labs. Clearing out all the grav plates from quarters was a job for the last 10 hours. I was in there with Steve and the Zorbellian Peacock feather. We were just about to really get down to business when the comms chimed, ""Jimmi, it seems that all of subspace has just... flattened? Do you know anything about that, does that change our plans?""

I put one foot up on Steve, he was being a sexy chair. ""Uhhmmm... No? I don't think so. I didn't do it anyhow, but it shouldn't really change our plans. We can send all our data now, though, might as well get in on the getting while the gettin is good. It'll transmit much faster across flat subspace. At least we know the data will get there now even if shuttle two doesn't make it. Now, if you'll excuse me I have the next six hours off and I only plan to spend three of them sleeping.""

My chair turned royal purple. ""Ohh... good chair, now sprout me some velvet, you ticklish bitch.""

""I'll... close the comms now. Enjoy your time off Ma'am.""
___
We arrived in orbit around Bob and slowed to warp 0.1, just a little bit faster than light. We beat laps around the star around 1/8 AU away, about as tight as we could turn at this speed. 

Flattened subspace did allow the cruiser to catch up to us a good thirty minutes sooner than we'd initially planned, but we knew it'd be slightly faster... well, I did anyhow and I warned the crew that we would need to hurry it up just a little. None of them even knew subspace could be flattened in a wide volume such as it was, nor had they ever seen it flattened like this before, so I guess that ignorance was fair.

Shuttle two departed. The tadpole did nothing as it slipped outside of the mother ship, and spooled up it's own warp drive before it vanished in a warp 13 flash. The sensors showed the cruiser turn toward it, and for only a half second it seemed to consider chasing, but then we dropped out of warp, and so did the cruiser. Even rearranged to look like a set of lego bricks with warp engines, we still seemed like a bigger, better meal.

Down in engineering was me, chief Shard, another Torgritoid called Lt. Stone, and also a snailman - Dungelar, if you insist on knowing the species name - who called himself Charlie. 

On the Bridge was Captain Kim, Gerwerpterk, Steve, the Felidian pilot whose human name was Miss Snicklefritz, and two more Dungelar, the science officer, and an additional engineer, called Zork and Bonk. Some Dungelar pick human names when serving on human ships, and some just choose onomatopoeia that would fit in 1960's batman. 

Lt. Commander Snicklefritz put us into a hard dive, spinning our heavily armored bottom toward the tadpole. The ship groaned, and complained, like a house settling, or a submarine going a wee bit too deep. The super structure complained against the g-forces, but we stayed in one piece.

""Oh that tadpole is shooting at us alright,"" Zork reported from the sensor station, while it still worked. ""Several clumps of flesh less than a kilogram in mass have impacted us, ventral side, as planned.""

""Nice flying Snicklefritz, keep it up!"" Captain Kim encouraged the crew.

""The cruiser is charging up a shot, Snick, coming in three, two, ONE!"" Gerwerpterk was focused on the cruiser, letting Zork pay attention to the tadpole.

The pilot slammed the ship into full thrust and managed to avoid the first shot from the cruiser.

""Let's make sure it's real pissed off."" Captain Kim said, ""Unleash a full spread, all the torpedoes we've got left."" We really didn't want to be keeping torpedoes onboard for what we were planning to do anyhow.

""Gladly!"" the Killitoot tactical officer fired ALL the torpedoes. Turns out ripping up all the grav plates makes the ship rattle like a motherfucker at the slightest provocation; each of the torpedoes launching gave us a little lurch.  

The whole ship was still rattling with successive torpedoes launches when we spun and *mostly* dodged another blast from the cruiser. It landed a glancing blow to our massive ablative belly armor, which... was not exactly ideal for us. We didn't have any belly fat to spare, but we had about two meters of our ship's bacon shaved off all the same.

""It caught the first three, took some damage from the others. It is pissed off captain. Closing fast."" Gerwerpterk reported. All according to plan. 

Miss Snicklefritz growled and snarled as she flew the ship. Huh? Her translator did not pick up swear words. Clever translator. I, *apparently*, did. Not sure when I learned to understand cat-people speak, but great. 

""We'll be hitting the surface of the sun in ten seconds."" Steve's job was to man the sensors focused on the sun.""Nine, Eight..."" 

Lt. Stone and Charlie prepared to launch the shuttle. 

""Captain, we've lost some ventral armor, I'll try to compensate manually."" I closed my mic. ""Fuck. Somehow.""

""How the hell do you plan to compensate manually?"" Chief Shard asked from his station, the look of a being that knew he was about to die in his eyes

""I'm gonna burn through my hyperspace G-string, and hope it's enough."" We were all going to die, it certainly was not enough. There was no way it would be enough. 

""Four. Three. Two."" Steve's countdown continued.

I could maybe reroute power from the primary warp engine to shields too, but... we'd already put all that work into rigging up just these ten grav plates to receive it when the sun exploded, because we were going to hit something like a million g's for a few seconds as we surfed out, and if the grav plates failed, we'd get turned into paste against the deck. 

So, cook slowly, or get flattened instantly?

""I set us up the bomb."" Lt. Stone said, as he released the payload. Charlie was on remote control, and kept it on course as best he could in the stellar turbulence.

I guess we had already picked the fire. I'd try to modulate the shields as best I could in hypertime until I ran down to my very last hypercule of thread, and I guess... hope it was enough. 

""The tadpole has attached to our exposed belly."" Zork reported. ""The cruiser seems to have shot it to allow it to go faster.

Oh shit, that's a new and terrifying news. Well, no plan survives contact with the enemy, right? Maybe having it there would be good, it could be a little meat shield heat shield for us.

""If we survive this, I'm writing a book called 'My Horkjultian love-slave, Steve'.""

""Detonation in three, two, wait, whaaaa..."" 

I slowed time, for me anyhow. I'd clamp it down much harder during the microseconds after Bob started *really* exploding. I had about two seconds. I pulled up a sensor display in both subspace and regular space on my alternate monitors to my right. I prepared the shield modulation window on my main screen, and when I turned to look to my left...

There was a large, cheetah-spotted house cat. ""Mrrrow prrrow?""

I slowed down time even more, she'd come right along with me. I took off my vacsuit helmet. I was moving in hypertime now, I didn't have time for silly concerns like breathing. I needed to rub my face on that cat.

""Oh! Mafdet! You beautiful, beautiful being, I'm so glad to see you!"" I scooped her up in my arms and held her like a baby. I slowed time even more, and buried my face in her belly fur. Jim would never allow me treat her with such '*disrespect*', but she *loved* it. ""Who's my sweet ancient baby? Oh, you are! Ow Ow Ow."" 

She loved me. So much so that she rabbit-kicked my face out of her belly without even breaking the skin. I slowed time even more, and flopped Mafdet down on the console to my left. I kept petting her and crunching the flow of time down, until it was slow enough that I could react at the speed of the changing supernova explosion that was coming... or as close to it as I could get with this primitive machinery. I'd be good enough.

I realized as I scratched her chin, that my hyperspace clothing wasn't being cooked off at near the rate I expected. ""Ohh... you *are* a good kitty. Yes, I *will* pet you like my life depends on it, oh good good girl!""

I slowed time a little more, so I could focus on keeping the hyperspace cat purring and still make shield modulations to keep us surfing and not swallowed in fire. 

I ruffled Mafdet all up and down her back and notice that the downy under fluff that was coming off her, like happens when you pet any cat, was fizzling out of existence the same way my hyperspace clothing did. ""Oh, I wish I had an undercoat brush for you.""  

I happened to notice one, Lt. Stone, a crystalline space dwarf, standing nearby. His mustache looked... very comby, brushy-like. Our grav plates were all contiguous in engineering, unlike the bridge, where only the stations being used had plates. I scooped up Mafdet and stepped over to him, where I popped his helmet off. 

""Sorry about this, but our lives probably depend on it."" He wouldn't hear me, because I said all that within a time frame much smaller than a microsecond. I broke his mustache off and  put his helmet back on. 

""D'you want a brushy, your majesty?"" She clearly did, so I started using the crystalline mustache to brush her *majesty*, Mafdet. 

""Mmmrrrr, rrrRRRRrrrr."" She started purring at the first touch of a brushy session.

I took my hyperspace anchor back to my work station, and tended to the shields while I gave her a thorough brushing on one side with that stache. It collected a *ton* of fur, I was right, amazing cat brush.

""How is there still more of you there to brush? This is already a whole bonus cat."" I asked as I noted that the explosion of Bob was about to make contact with us. Mafdet rolled over and I started brushing her other side. The shockwave was coming faster than the computer could update about it now. 

Just as we were about to be hit, I realized I was brushing the air. She'd gone. Typical cat, leaving when 70% brushed. I put my own helmet back on.

Sensors indicated that we'd started riding the shockwave out, I kept working the shields. I burned through the whole mustache of hyperspace cat hair and the bonus cat of hair I'd piled up on the console, but I kept us from getting cooked alive. Can't say as much for the tadpole though. It was heat blasted off. I hate to say it, but I think if it hadn't hit us, we'd have cooked to death. 

I'm not sure, but there may be a small chance that there's some scourge flesh sealed in several meters of melted Magellan hull. If so, that'll be a great boon to the FAP's science nerds, or a horrific containment breach waiting to happen. 

I worked the shields and slowly returned to the normal flow of time as I ran out of the last bits of hyperspace cat hair I had. I managed to keep less than a g-string worth of hyperspace thread. 

""Sensors show us moving in real space at practically the speed of light."" Bonk reported over comms.

""The Scourge cruiser appears to be eliminated.""

Lt. Stone Started Screaming, ""MY MUSTACHE!"" 

""Warp power is out captain, primary and secondary cores are cooked. We're on batteries.""

""We can't slow down."" 

""It's fine."" Captain Kim broke through the reports, ""We're all time dilated, going this fast in regspace, rescue will come before we get far, or long. A day at most from our point of view, even if it takes fleet command a year to figure out how to rescue us.."" 

Damn, that was spot on. No wonder his hungover math was so good, Captain Kim was a math wizard. 

""WHERE IS MY STACHE!"" 

I slipped it in my vac suit's leg pocket. If I see Mafdet down here in real space again I want to have a brushy ready. My very life could depend on it.

""OH SWEET MOTHER MOUNTAIN! MY MUSTACHE IS GONE!""

1nute4l,https://v.redd.it/tjntc0mj4esf1,Wan 2.5 is really really good (native audio generation is awesome!),"I did a bunch of tests to see just how good Wan 2.5 is, and honestly, it seems very close if not comparable to Veo3 in most areas.

First, here are all the prompts for the videos I showed:

*1. The white dragon warrior stands still, eyes full of determination and strength. The camera slowly moves closer or circles around the warrior, highlighting the powerful presence and heroic spirit of the character.*

*2. A lone figure stands on an arctic ridge as the camera pulls back to reveal the Northern Lights dancing across the sky above jagged icebergs.*

*3. The armored knight stands solemnly among towering moss-covered trees, hands resting on the hilt of their sword. Shafts of golden sunlight pierce through the dense canopy, illuminating drifting particles in the air. The camera slowly circles around the knight, capturing the gleam of polished steel and the serene yet powerful presence of the figure. The scene feels sacred and cinematic, with atmospheric depth and a sense of timeless guardianship.*

This third one was image-to-video, all the rest are text-to-video.

*4. Japanese anime style with a cyberpunk aesthetic. A lone figure in a hooded jacket stands on a rain-soaked street at night, neon signs flickering in pink, blue, and green above. The camera tracks slowly from behind as the character walks forward, puddles rippling beneath their boots, reflecting glowing holograms and towering skyscrapers. Crowds of shadowy figures move along the sidewalks, illuminated by shifting holographic billboards. Drones buzz overhead, their red lights cutting through the mist. The atmosphere is moody and futuristic, with a pulsing synthwave soundtrack feel. The art style is detailed and cinematic, with glowing highlights, sharp contrasts, and dramatic framing straight out of a cyberpunk anime film.*

*5. A sleek blue Lamborghini speeds through a long tunnel at golden hour. Sunlight beams directly into the camera as the car approaches the tunnel exit, creating dramatic lens flares and warm highlights across the glossy paint. The camera begins locked in a steady side view of the car, holding the composition as it races forward. As the Lamborghini nears the end of the tunnel, the camera smoothly pulls back, revealing the tunnel opening ahead as golden light floods the frame. The atmosphere is cinematic and dynamic, emphasizing speed, elegance, and the interplay of light and motion.*

*6.* A cinematic tracking shot of a Ferrari Formula 1 car racing through the iconic Monaco Grand Prix circuit. The camera is fixed on the side of the car that is moving at high speed, capturing the sleek red bodywork glistening under the Mediterranean sun. The reflections of luxury yachts and waterfront buildings shimmer off its polished surface as it roars past. Crowds cheer from balconies and grandstands, while the blur of barriers and trackside advertisements emphasizes the car‚Äôs velocity. The sound design should highlight the high-pitched scream of the F1 engine, echoing against the tight urban walls. The atmosphere is glamorous, fast-paced, and intense, showcasing the thrill of racing in Monaco.

*7. A bustling restaurant kitchen glows under warm overhead lights, filled with the rhythmic clatter of pots, knives, and sizzling pans. In the center, a chef in a crisp white uniform and apron stands over a hot skillet. He lays a thick cut of steak onto the pan, and immediately it begins to sizzle loudly, sending up curls of steam and the rich aroma of searing meat. Beads of oil glisten and pop around the edges as the chef expertly flips the steak with tongs, revealing a perfectly caramelized crust. The camera captures close-up shots of the steak searing, the chef‚Äôs focused expression, and wide shots of the lively kitchen bustling behind him. The mood is intense yet precise, showcasing the artistry and energy of fine dining.*

*8.* A cozy, warmly lit coffee shop interior in the late morning. Sunlight filters through tall windows, casting golden rays across wooden tables and shelves lined with mugs and bags of beans. A young woman in casual clothes steps up to the counter, her posture relaxed but purposeful. Behind the counter, a friendly barista in an apron stands ready, with the soft hiss of the espresso machine punctuating the atmosphere. Other customers chat quietly in the background, their voices blending into a gentle ambient hum. The mood is inviting and everyday-realistic, grounded in natural detail. Woman: ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôll have a cappuccino, please.‚Äù Barista (nodding as he rings it up): ‚ÄúOf course. That‚Äôll be five dollars.‚Äù

Now, here are the main things I noticed:

1. Wan 2.1 is really good at dialogues. You can see that in the last two examples. HOWEVER, you can see in prompt 7 that we didn't even specify any dialogue, though it still did a great job at filling it in. If you want to avoid dialogue, make sure to include keywords like 'dialogue' and 'speaking' in the negative prompt.
2. Amazing camera motion, especially in the way it reveals the steak in example 7, and the way it sticks to the sides of the cars in examples 5 and 6.
3. Very good prompt adherence. If you want a very specific scene, it does a great job at interpreting your prompt, both in the video and the audio. It's also great at filling in details when the prompt is sparse (e.g. first two examples).
4. It's also great at background audio (see examples 4, 5, 6). I've noticed that even if you're not specific in the prompt, it still does a great job at filling in the audio naturally.
5. Finally, it does a great job across different animation styles, from very realistic videos (e.g. the examples with the cars) to beautiful animated looks (e.g. examples 3 and 4).

I also made a full tutorial breaking this all down. Feel free to watch :)

1nutdnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nutdnw/something_that_has_helped_me_recently/,Something that has helped me recently,"It's been a long road to recognizing and living with my anxiety. It's only been in the last 2 years that I've understood it to be anxiety and I'm a 51 year old male. I've likely had it all my life and got real good at stuffing down my emotions. Not anymore. I've learned to confront them, and acknowledge them. Over the years, through therapy and writing and reflecting, I've learned some things that have worked for me. I ask myself.

1. Are you hungry? I can't you how many times I've felt sick to my stomach over anxiety, and have just decided to eat a little thing and boom, it calms me down.
2. Are you tired? Yeah, if I got shitty sleep, then I'm likely to get disregulated. Naps aren't usually an option, so I have to power through this the best I can.
3. Are you craving caffeine? This usually goes along with the sleeping thing. I gave up drinking a lot of coffee after my first panic attack, but now sometimes, if I'm tired, a good cup of coffee really does help to calm me down.
4. Is your blood sugar low? See #1. Sometimes again, when I get anxious, I don't eat, but a little piece of candy or fruit will help.
5. Did you work out? Sometimes I get so much in my head that the only way to clear it out, is to go for a run, swim, bike ride or walk. Usually I go right after I wake up, and if I miss that, then I can get deregulated.
6. Did you talk to anyone today? I work from home, and I can get lonely and so sometimes just calling my best friend or mom or wife to talk about nothing conects me to people. Sometimes a meeting helps too. 

Not foolproof, but for me, asking these questions of myself does help. I get to remind myself that I'm not really anxious, I'm (fill in the number.) Then I can rationalize myself enough that I believe what's going on. ",4,1759276902.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

1nut9zv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nut9zv/my_grief_counseling_group_is_stealing_the_memory/,My Grief Counseling Group Is Stealing the Memory of My Brother From Me,"
I‚Äôm typing this in the dark. My hands won‚Äôt stop shaking.

I know this is going to sound insane, but I swear I‚Äôm not paranoid ‚Äî please, just listen.

I wasn‚Äôt going to post again. Not because I didn‚Äôt want to, but because I hoped the first session was just a weird coincidence.

After my younger brother Eli died in a car accident, my parents forced me into grief counseling. I expected stale coffee and awkward silences.

Instead, strangers described things about Eli that no one else could‚Äôve known.

A green hoodie with a torn elbow pulled from the wreckage, orange popsicles he called ‚Äúsun sticks,‚Äù and ‚ÄúAll Apologies‚Äù by Nirvana, the song he used to play on repeat.

They spoke as if they were talking about their own dead brothers.

I panicked and deleted my post a few hours later, convinced that it was my brain trying to find patterns in my grief when there were none.

Just before I took it down, though, I added something ‚Äî a memory Eli never had.

I made it up to prove I wasn‚Äôt losing my mind. To prove there was still one memory of my brother that belonged only to me.

I‚Äôve been back to the group several times since then. Most of those sessions were uneventful ‚Äî at least, nothing I could pin down as sinister.

But I went back tonight and I didn‚Äôt think it was about grief anymore.



I got there early, hoping to get ahead of the grief spiraling in my brain.

Jean‚Äôs gray-streaked bob stayed perfectly still as she watched me enter from her seat in the middle of the room, her notebook resting in her lap.

‚ÄúGood to see you again, Lucas.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt smile back, just gave a quick nod and avoided her sharp, green eyes.

I sat in the same uncomfortable plastic chair as last time as I watched Mark, Greg, Lillian, Jonah, and another person I hadn‚Äôt seen before shuffle in and take their seats.

I tried to remember what was said about Eli‚Äôs popsicle obsession, but it kept slipping away.

Had I mentioned the hoodie? I didn‚Äôt think so.

I‚Äôd done my best to tell myself that I was just suffering from a hyperactive imagination because after all, there was comfort in the panic, right?

My eyes landed on the rabbit-shaped coffee stain on the floor ‚Äî darker now, like something was pushing up from beneath the tile.

I blinked, but it stayed. A jagged crack ran through its liquid features like a scar.

I rubbed my eyes, the line had vanished, but the rabbit was back. 

‚ÄúSome things leave their mark, don‚Äôt they?‚Äù I heard Jean‚Äôs voice, but I never saw her lips move. It was as if her voice was inside my head.

That was when my ears picked up on something in the distance ‚Äî a soft, off-key humming.

The opening chords of ‚ÄúAll Apologies‚Äù drifted through the room slowly, almost methodically. It was quiet enough for me to think that maybe I was imagining it, but it was there, and the humming was growing louder behind me.

I turned my head slowly, my heartbeat rivaling the sound of the music.

I noticed that Jonah was sitting in his chair, rocking slightly from side to side. His chapped lips were barely parted, and his eyes were half-shut behind his square framed glasses like he was halfway between sleep and trance, but it was unmistakable, the melody was coming from him.

I leaned forward in my chair slightly. ‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶ you okay?‚Äù

His eyes opened sharply as if he had just woken up to a morning alarm.

He gave a light chuckle before smiling faintly:

‚ÄúWhy so jumpy, Rabbit?‚Äù

I felt my blood turn to ice. I hadn‚Äôt told anybody that nickname, not one time.

How did he know?

‚ÄúWhat did you just call me?‚Äù

His brow furrowed. 

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say anything, man. You alright?‚Äù

I shook my head and dropped the conversation with Jonah. 

I knew what I had heard.

Everyone else sat still ‚Äî left hands curled around their paper cups; elbows bent in eerie symmetry.

It felt rehearsed, like a ritual they‚Äôd practiced.

I didn‚Äôt feel scared exactly ‚Äî just disconnected. My body was in the room but my mind was elsewhere entirely.

I hadn‚Äôt even said that nickname aloud since Eli died. That was his name for me ‚Äî something only he ever called me because I would jump at the sound of anything.

But now, others knew it.

How?

‚ÄúI am losing my mind.‚Äù I thought to myself as I twiddled my fingers, waiting for the session to begin.

Jean‚Äôs smile tightened like something crawled behind her teeth.

‚ÄúNo you‚Äôre not, dear.‚Äù

Had I spoken aloud and didn‚Äôt realize?

I blinked in confusion and was met a look from Jean that suggested that I had been staring for too long.

‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù I responded briefly as I did my best to calm my rattled self.

Eventually, Jean asked us to once again ‚Äúshare a memory‚Äù and this time, Lillian volunteered to go first.

Her fingers danced over the leather bracelet  on her left wrist in tight, practiced loops.

‚ÄúHe dotted his i‚Äôs with tiny bubble circles.‚Äù

My stomach lurched; Eli used to do that. His school assignments always appeared vandalized by balloons.

Jean nodded slowly.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a beautiful memory, Lillian. Thank you for sharing. That‚Äôs yours now.‚Äù

Why did she say it like that? Like she was giving it away.

There was no time to dwell on that as Greg went next. His knuckles were red from being rubbed raw ‚Äî a habit he didn‚Äôt seem aware of.

‚ÄúHe avoided spaghetti at all costs because he thought the sauce smelled like pennies.‚Äù

When it was my turn, I opened my mouth... but nothing came out, not even a whisper.

I frantically searched my brain for something ‚Äî anything ‚Äî about Eli that hadn‚Äôt already been said. 

The harder I tried to remember, the faster it all evaporated ‚Äî like breath on glass.

I could remember his face, but when I reached for the little things like his laugh or his habits, they slipped through my fingers.

‚ÄúCome back to me.‚Äù I grunted, dismissing my turn so I could ponder everything further.

I received a stern look from Jean as she reluctantly made the new person introduce himself. 

He was pale, lanky, and nervous, with sandy hair sticking up at the crown of his head.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Shane,‚Äù he spoke softly. ‚ÄúMy brother‚ÄîBen‚Äîhe was hit by a drunk driver a few years ago.‚Äù

The silence sat for so long I wasn‚Äôt sure he was going to speak again, until he finally did.

‚ÄúWe used to build these massive Lego castles together. He‚Äôd always insist on putting the flag on the top because he said it wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äòreal fortress‚Äô without the flag.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know him! Stop pretending you do!‚Äù 

The words ripped out of me before I realized  I‚Äôd sat up straighter in my chair. My throat burned with shame, but nobody looked surprised.

‚ÄúLucas, no speaking out of turn.‚Äù Jean tilted her head. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to lose him again, do you, Rabbit?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat did you just say?‚Äù My tone now turning combative.

‚ÄúI was telling Mark to go ahead.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs definitely not what you said.‚Äù I grumbled with clenched fists, earning glares from the others.

Mark leaned forward in his seat; his eyes a little watery as he recounted his memory. 

‚ÄúHe had this real wide gap between his front teeth. I thought he looked like a rabbit because of it.‚Äù

My eyes widened as my head snapped towards the coffee stain on the floor, the one that resembled a rabbit.

Except, it wasn‚Äôt a rabbit anymore.

It was a devilish grin with two wide, stained teeth, shimmering like dampened ink across the tile.

I watched as the smile stretched and widened, it‚Äôs proportions growing with every second before it disappeared in the blink of an eye.

I shivered in my chair as I clutched myself tightly, the room seemingly dropping in temperature as I listened to Jonah speak.

‚ÄúThat dinosaur shirt. You remember the one? Yellow, raggedy thing with the little hole under the armpit? He wouldn‚Äôt take it off. He wore it everywhere he could..‚Äù

‚ÄúStop it,‚Äù I spoke through gritted teeth.

They didn‚Äôt listen, one by one they spoke Eli into the room ‚Äî in fragments of hobbies, phrases, and inside jokes. 

Each detail carved into me like glass under the skin.

Then Lillian said something that made me shudder.

‚ÄúHe used to say clouds were made of cotton candy and dead dreams every time we drove past the old park.‚Äù

The words fell from her mouth like they‚Äôd always belonged to her.

But that was mine. That was the one thing Eli never said.

I felt sick, the world began to spin and tilt around me.

I reached into my backpack for my water ‚Äî and my fingers brushed fabric.

Confused, I pulled it from my backpack.

It was Eli‚Äôs hoodie. 

It was torn at the elbow, the fabric was damp, faintly smelling of gasoline and scorched plastic. 

Someone had folded it neatly into my backpack. 

The dampness seeped into my palm as if it had been waiting for me in the wreck this whole time.

Inside the collar:

‚ÄúTo Rabbit ‚Äì You‚Äôll always be my player two.‚Äù

I remember Eli writing this on the inside of a birthday card he had given me once.

This was after we had spent hours, days, and weeks grinding different video games together. 

That was our memory, no one else knew that‚Ä¶right?

I glanced at Jean, half-expecting her to react. Instead, she was watching me, like she‚Äôd been waiting to see my face crumple at the sight of that ratty hoodie. 

She didn‚Äôt even blink as I stood up in anger.

‚ÄúThese aren‚Äôt your memories,‚Äù I declared, louder than I meant to. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not talking about your brothers. You‚Äôre talking about mine.‚Äù

The room stood still, the only sound I could hear was my heartbeat, thudding in my chest.

But then, Jean‚Äôs expression shifted to reveal a smile that was wrong in every possible way.

‚ÄúLucas, I know this is hard for you, but don‚Äôt interrupt the process.‚Äù

Mark looked up at me with a slow, deliberate frown.

‚ÄúWhy are you so scared, Rabbit?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve always been here.‚Äù Lillian chimed in, her eyes looking like they were going to protrude from their sockets.

The color drained from my face as words failed me.

They smiled in unison ‚Äî not real smiles, but ones carved into their faces like wax figures left too long in the sun.

I took a step back, and that‚Äôs when the lights began to flicker.

Once‚Ä¶twice‚Ä¶until complete darkness.

I could only see their silhouettes faintly sitting in their chairs, like chess pieces that had never moved.

I went to leave when I heard the humming begin.

It started out low, but slowly crept to a crescendo as the sound of static crackled to life somewhere behind me.

The first, dissonant chords of ‚ÄúAll Apologies‚Äù leaked out like rot through the community center. 

It was so distorted and warbled that it sounded like something dying was dragging itself across the room.

The voices started again except they weren‚Äôt speaking anymore.

They were mimicking and echoing Eli‚Äôs laugh‚Ä¶his voice‚Ä¶his humming.

One by one, I listened to his words leaving their mouths in the pitch black like they were chewing them up‚Ä¶and spitting them back at me.

I sat there trying to picture Eli‚Äôs face again, but for a moment, all I could see was the hoodie.

What kind of brother forgets that?

Greg‚Äôs head twitched in violent spasms, his neck bending at a sharp, almost impossible angle as he whispered:

‚ÄúSun sticks. You remember sun sticks?‚Äù

Jonah‚Äôs smile stretched almost past his nose. His eyes two flat pits of shadow.

‚ÄúHe said clouds were made of candy and dead dreams.‚Äù

I tripped backward over my chair, landing hard with a thud.

The coffee stain shimmered like pond water, rippling under the flickering emergency light.

It was grinning and I watched in horror as its teeth grew huge, and the stain seemingly took a life of its own.

The melody of the song looped repeatedly, bent and broken until it sounded like screeches of agony in reverse.

‚ÄúPlayer two,‚Äù Lillian whispered, her voice trembling with excitement. ‚ÄúWe saved the castle together. Remember?‚Äù

I heard joints cracking like tree branches in quick succession as something started crawling across the floor slowly.

Bones scraped across the tile as a labored wheeze thick with phlegm came closer to where I stood.

I turned to run but it grabbed my ankle, its grip firm but slippery like a hand covered in oil.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve fed on softer hearts than yours.‚Äù Jean‚Äôs voice echoed in my thoughts as I kicked hard and stumbled to my feet. 

I ran as fast as my feet could carry me until I slammed into the doorframe.

I fumbled with the lock in a frantic struggle. Then‚Äîlights exploded back on, and the music stopped.

The room had returned to normal ‚Äî everyone was still in place, like chess pieces that never moved.

Jean sipped her coffee as she stared at the terrified expression on my face.

I didn‚Äôt say goodbye.

With my heart still racing, I grabbed my backpack and ran the whole way home without looking back once.



My mom asked about the session, but I didn‚Äôt dare tell her what I saw, not even a fraction of it.

I couldn‚Äôt even really put into words what I experienced.

All I told her was that it was fine and that I walked home because I needed the fresh air from how heavy it got today.

I went upstairs to my room and closed the door hopelessly gaslighting myself into thinking that a thin piece of wood could keep the horrors out.

All I could think about were those dying lights, the way their faces shifted, and a name I hadn‚Äôt heard in months being spoken again.

I dumped my backpack onto the bed, but the hoodie was gone.

I swore I had it ‚Äî hadn‚Äôt I taken it out?

Then I saw it, folded neatly at the foot of my bed.

I knew I hadn‚Äôt brought it home; I would have remembered

I curled up on the bed, wiping at tears I didn‚Äôt remember shedding. The grief was still there, but I felt hollow ‚Äî like my body was going through the motions without me.

All I kept repeating in my head was:

‚ÄúHe called me Rabbit.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know how long I sat there in uninterrupted silence but the sound of my phone lowly buzzing in my pocket snapped me out of my thoughts.

I didn‚Äôt recognize the number and just let it go to voicemail.

If it is important, they will leave one.

But the number kept calling me, no matter how many times I silenced or blocked it.

In a moment that I would come to regret, I answered the phone on the seventh try.

First came the static ‚Äî gnawing through the speaker angrily.

Then the warped twang of ‚ÄúAll Apologies,‚Äù every note nauseatingly dragged out as if it were being played from a melted cassette tape. 

It sounded more like a funeral than a song.

I pressed the phone harder to my ear before I realized my hands were slick with sweat.

Underneath the layers of distortion, words manifested themselves.

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have deleted me, Rabbit,‚Äù said a voice that almost sounded like Eli.

I whispered his name before the line clicked dead.

‚ÄúNo no no no no.‚Äù I repeated as I felt the phone drop from my hand to the bedroom floor. 

I knelt to pick up the phone, but my hand brushed something else.

There, on the floor beside my bed, was a popsicle stick.

‚ÄúSun stick,‚Äù written in messy, orange marker.

It was unmistakably Eli‚Äôs handwriting.

I didn‚Äôt know if I was shaking from fear or from the kind of cold that creeps inside when nothing makes sense anymore.

I crawled under my bed and pulled out an old box I had tucked away, I hadn‚Äôt touched it since the funeral.

Inside were pictures of crayon monsters with jagged teeth and drawing of our Lego fortress.

After a couple moments of quick searching through the contents of bittersweet nostalgia, I found the picture I was looking for.

It was Eli, he was around eight years old, and he was grinning wide with both front teeth missing, holding up a Lego castle with a tiny red flag.

I could hear his voice clear as day in my head:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not real without the flag.‚Äù

I felt myself choking back tears as I remembered begging him to play video games with me that day.

If only he had stayed home, he would still be my player two.

My chest stiffened with the memory of his laugh, that pure, careless joy. 

Maybe I‚Äôm the reason he‚Äôs gone, and that‚Äôs why I keep hearing him.

I ran my thumb over the photo, over Eli‚Äôs gap-toothed grin. Tears fell from my eyes.

I shut the box, the memories felt radioactive.

A dark thought crossed my mind: 

What if none of them are lying?

What if they‚Äôre not sharing stories?

What if they‚Äôre taking turns carving him out of me piece by piece?

The sun sticks, the castle, the damn fake memory?

It was the only explanation I had to rationalize the things I was seeing.

But if they can steal something that was never real‚Ä¶what exactly does that make them?

And worse, what does that make me?



It‚Äôs late at night.

I haven‚Äôt slept and I don‚Äôt think I honestly want to.

I heard my mom answer the phone downstairs earlier. 

Jean called to make sure I had made it home safely. 

Something else was said but mom wouldn‚Äôt tell me what. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôll all come back to you.‚Äù Is what she told me.

All I could picture was Jean‚Äôs smile ‚Äî the one that always knew more than it said.

I‚Äôm not just losing Eli ‚Äî I‚Äôm losing myself.

If anyone out there has ever heard of a grief group like this or anything even remotely similar, I must know.

I‚Äôm not sure if I should go back but I feel like the only way I‚Äôll get answers is to keep going.

I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll forget his voice next.

If I forget him completely‚Ä¶did I ever really have a brother at all?

God, that sounds messed up. But I don‚Äôt know how else to say it.

I‚Äôll update whenever I go back again.

I promise to stay safe and keep in touch with you all as much as I can.

1nut92r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nut92r,Trying Almost Every Sorce Fragrance- Day 3,"The wheel has chosen Cake For Breakfast and Venus in Fleurs as my day 3 test. After applying it to my skin (one in the morning and one in the evening) and letting it settle for 3 hours, here is my review.

\*Notes: Photos are taken directly from Sorce's website/ Google for special orders. The bottle's designs may be outdated compared to current.

\*Special Order scents can only be ordered on their website 4x a year. The next window is this weekend 3rd-5th.

Morning: Cake for Breakfast (Special Order)

What it smells like: You are tasked with the job of baking a cake for your 5yo daughter. She said she wants a pineapple and mango cake, and of course, you must oblige. Since you are not a baker, you try to follow a simple guide online. Turns out, baking a cake is not a piece of cake. You try your best, and what comes out is... something. You decorate it with icing and cross your fingers that it is edible. To your relief, your daughter takes a bite, as do her friends, and they say it's the best cake they have ever had.

My opinion: This is a hodgepodge of cake with fruity notes and maple syrup. It literally smells as if you just threw all the ingredients together, and this is what you get. It makes it hard to detect certain notes, but it is noticeably a sweet cake smell. Unfortunately, this one did not last long on me. I get whiffs two hours in, but not a lot. It isn't bad, but it is a bit too basic for me.

BF‚Äôs opinion: Smells like a bitter vanilla

Would we wear it: No

Would we buy it: No

Rated: I rate it 4/10, and he rates it 7/10

Evening: Venus in Fleurs

What it smells like: You are living in a tropical paradise. The water is blue, parrots fly by, and mangos grow all around. You tend to your tropical garden that is filled with tropical flora. The monkeys watch from above, and mango bits fall as they devour the sweet fruits.

My opinion: This is a very juicy floral fragrance. The jasmine is lovely and pairs with a juicy mango note. There are background notes of green plants and vanilla. Overall, it creates a very beautiful, juicy, sweet combo. This one lasted on me for a long time and had great sillage. Love it.

BF‚Äôs opinion: Smells like a fresh mango. Like you are drinking a Mango Peace Tea.

Would we wear it: I would

Would we buy it: I would

Rated: I give it a 10/10 and he gives it a 8/10

I typically live in Pacific Time and I‚Äôm a university student, so replies can fluctuate but I always give a heads up if I‚Äôm busy and I do my best to be prompt.

# About Me

* **POV/Style:**¬†Comfortable in first or third person. I‚Äôm Literate to Novella, but I‚Äôm happy with Semi-Literate if that is more your speed. I try to match length and energy but sometimes I‚Äôll go over/under depending on inspiration.
* **Characters:**¬†I don‚Äôt typically play a female MC as my main, but I‚Äôm totally fine playing female NPCs/side characters. I only use Original Characters (even in properly made worlds).
* **References:**¬†I can send faceclaim/visual refs for my OC(s).
* **Platforms:**¬†Prefer Discord for RP/plotting (Reddit & others feel meh for long form).

# What I like

* Fantasy (high or low), court/civic intrigue, combat driven arcs, enemies to lovers, slice of life fantasy, found family, morally gray casts, road quests, heists, guild/clan politics.
* I mostly do fantasy, but I‚Äôm open to modern/realistic if that‚Äôs your cup of tea (college city life, nightlife drama, crime families, corporate intrigue, urban fantasy, etc.).

# Hard lines & preferences

* No controlling my character (no godmodding/metagaming).
* OC only even when inspired by existing media; I don‚Äôt use canon characters since I never feel I represent them properly.
* I‚Äôm cool juggling side characters/NPCs to keep scenes lively, but I prefer one main POV on my side.

# Availability & pacing

* I aim for at least daily replies when life allows. Uni comes first, but I‚Äôll warn you if I‚Äôm slow. (This does not mean ill only respond once a day, just minimum once a day).
* I love partners who add to the story, pitch twists, and enjoy world/plot building.

# Starter RP (pick one or pitch your own!)

* **Court of Glass & Thorns:**¬†A disgraced knight and a court sorcerer uncover a conspiracy that could shatter a fragile alliance between kingdoms.
* **The Demon Lord and his love for long walks:**¬†The demon lord has recently left the underworld on a journey to sight see, on this adventure he may find out that maybe being human is just what he needs.
* **Ash & Oaths:**¬†A veteran monster hunter and a scholar bound by a cursed contract must choose between breaking the curse or breaking the world.

He asked me to be in his class group so I also asked my friend. Well she eventually told him I had a different group, I didn‚Äôt, she lied. So I found my way back in the group but it was pretty clear she liked him whereas I saw him as a friend. We hung out a few times but she would see us walk out of class and would cut in. Eventually I just let that go because he said he loves when ‚Äúwomen chase‚Äù which idk if he meant me and her, regardless I figured that my friend wasn‚Äôt really trying to be my friend.

I think they dated for a few years. I began grad school and found myself at my undergrad to get my transcript/ a letter or rec in person. Well that guy worked in the office.

We eventually talked a bit and met up, I assumed he wanted to be friends but he began talking about the girl (my friend) and how she‚Äôs his ex but they‚Äôre still hanging around and how his love life is a huge bust.

He told me we should hang again, but then when we were texting the next day he suddenly got pretty rude? Like he told me he would let me know how this restraint was that he tried. So he reached out and said: you probably won‚Äôt remember, the fakeness of your makeup probably made you forgetful. Then he said something about how we should check out this coffee shop and he said he already went with his ex‚Ä¶ so I just let it go.

We have also just bought a house. We had physical fights a few times before and we agreed to never hit eachother ever again under any circumstances and things got better. There have been no physical fights for around 6 months to a year at least. Also we both have ADHD but my ADHD is quite severe and I have low level autism and sever childhood trauma of abandonment. I also have some ptsd from being raped. This means I get extremely panicked and my partner has been told to not leave me as I just get worse and want to unalive myself. When I have my meltdowns I hit myself in the head and sometimes it helps when he brings me in close and sometimes it scares me.

It started with me asking him to take a shower so we could get to bed as we where waking up at 6am tmo. He was angry and shut down because he didn't want to shower or go to bed. 

I then said to him as he said he might have a coffee tmo, you might wanna actually quit coffee or stop saying your going to. That made him more angry. 

Then I showed him a video where a man was saying nice things to his wife about how sexy she looks and I said I hope you say things like that when I loose weight. He said he cant because he is a 'subtle person'. I then brought it up again like 10 mins later just saying that it makes me sad that you don't feel that way about me and you won't even when im skinny. 

He was then even more shut down and I got myself into a massive spiral because he seemed angry and refused to tell me his feelings but claimed he couldn't care about how I feel because he has feelings. 

I then start hitting myself because im getting so frustrated that he wont talk to me. I was also screaming.

So he mounts me to 'stop me hurting myself' but this terrifies me as I assume he is trying to hurt me as he is angry so I put my knee between us and gouge my nails into his arms to get him to get off me. 

He then punches me in the head repetitively and then we are just fighting. He says he punched me in self defense because I was gouging my nails into him but I dont know if that's actually self defence of if he was just trying to hurt me. 

I also dont know if I kind of brought this upon myself by making him feel like he cant leave when he is angry and so its reasonable for him to hit me instead. 

I need to know if I should simply go to counselling both alone and as a couple if this is work out able if I can learn to accept him leaving when he is angry or if he is simply a violent person and I need to leave before this escalates. 

He never hit me until around 3 or 4 years into the relationship so that could be added context for why I may have pushed him to being this way.

Since the last situationship who led me on for a while and then my ex boyfriend who fell off the face of the earth after forgetting my birthday, it felt like it was something I wanted to get back into. 

When I first go on dating apps, I was a 17 year old (bad ass kid) effeminate gay kid from a small ass midwestern town and was super nervous to get on there. I really only met up with people around my age and was really insecure due to how skinny I was (to a point where people would make consistent comments about my weight and how I was borderline anorexic). But between 17-20 I would say that I was very trusting with strangers and didn't mind going over to one's house/dorm/car just for blowing them. 

At one point when I had my own dorm room with no roommates, I managed to get like 4-5 guys to come over in my room in a single month and felt like hot shit. Before like hitting 21 I would say most guys I would get with were strangers (I had quite a few Grindr hookups now that I remember when I was in college). None of these guys ever took me out, which looking back at was probably shitty, but also it did feel validating whenever I did have a guy come over and say I looked pretty.

Getting back on tinder years later, I immediately got hit with a bunch of matches within like the first week of having a profile. I've gained weight, really found my style, and embraced my femininity. Most of my pictures are just me in makeup selfies or like cute outfits, so men swiping right is a breeze. It's definitely way easier for me to find a guy to talk to, but also I think I've become way more protective about who I end up hooking up with. A lot of guys mainly just want to hook up, and I've realized how much it is draining to my soul when I do that. In the past 4 years there may have been 3 times I hooked up with a stranger (and one of them was actually a previous match). The thought of hooking up with someone that I haven't talked to or just matched with now disgusts me. 

The last person I would say I did ""hook up"" with was someone I was going out with on vacation in the summer and he treated me so sweetly. He would buy me oysters, took me to a movie, bought me happy hour drinks, and was all around such a gentleman who showed me so much while I was out there. It felt genuine and like even if we both knew there was a limited time, that he at least wanted to get to know me as a person and show me life.

 I say this because I go out on dates before even considering hooking up with someone now. It doesn't even have to cost money, I have went to get coffee and go to a thrift store to look around before and had fun. I guess I'm posting this and wondering if I'm alone in this feeling or if anyone else has felt this way.

TL;DR: I redownloaded dating apps after 3 months of being single and have realized I aged out of hooking up with people after 20.

Q: What appliances can be disposed of?
A: Most services handle refrigerators, washers, dryers, stoves, dishwashers, and microwaves. Some even take smaller electronics like toasters and coffee makers.

Q: How quickly can disposal be scheduled?
A: Many companies offer same-week or next-day appointments, sometimes with onsite estimates for accuracy.

Q: How do I find a reputable appliance disposal service?

Every weekend, I'd go on excursions to the beautiful surrounding areas, like Avignon or Fontaine se Vaucluse (either with the language school or with friends). Then the nights would be spent out in Aix with G, chain-smoking, laughing and chatting in increasingly loud, grammatically incorrect French as the wine kicked in and our first languages (my English and her Swedish) would start to slip out. 


On weekdays, I had a set routine. 


I'd wake up, get ready, have a mug of tea with fresh baguette, homemade jam and fresh butter. I'd often video call overseas family or friends over breakfast. 


I would listen to music on my walk through the park to the language school - The Bats were my main soundtrack. At the school, as I was in the C1 class, it functionally looked like spending hours chatting with interesting people from all over the world (interspersed with coffee and cigarette breaks). 


After class, I'd walk into the centre of the old town (sometimes with friends, sometimes alone), get a late lunch somewhere pretty. I'd sometimes shop or read, and sometimes I'd walk to boules and play, smoke, drink pastis and banter with Georges and the old Proven√ßal locals. 


After hours of walking or reading or many games of boules (tipsy if it was the latter), would then wander back through the old town (dodging the homeless pigeon man's ravings), past the √âcole Militaire, back to my famille d'acceuil's beautiful apartment. 


E, my lovely 70-something host mother, would do three small courses made from fresh, local food for dinner as a matter of principle (soup/salad, meat or fish, finishing with fruits and cheese).


After dinner, S (30s, E's son who was briefly back home between modelling jobs), E and I would talk for hours about anything and everything - history, politics, our lives, love, science, the arts - or we'd watch an old film together (S was a film buff), or host one of E's many friends. 


Then, exhausted, I would wander upstairs, fall into bed and sleep. 


It was a simple, full, and peaceful existence. I think those months in Aix were ultimately what brought me back to myself after I tried to kill myself during the worst depressive episode I've ever experienced (and hopefully will ever experience). 


That time gave me the reprieve that I'd desperately needed from my traumatic teen years. I don't think I could have faced what the next couple years had in store if I hadn't had those months of quiet serenity in Provence. ",1,1759275926.0,u_CertainFault9,0,1.0,False

1nuswdl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGreatNorth/comments/1nuswdl/how_the_great_north_accurately_handled/,How The Great North accurately handled relationships and taught me about life,"One of the things that made The Great North so relatable and insightful for me was how it handled relationships of all sorts: romantic, sexual, friendships, family dynamics, professional connections, and even acquaintances. Most of the modern relationship advice I know comes from this show.

The show also gave amazing guidance on friendships and family relationships. Certain family members of mine will definitely never be as positive or wholesome as the Tobins, but I can still aspire to be like them and do my best. I have always loved the show‚Äôs unique family structure because it focuses on relatives, both blood and non-blood, in ways that feel authentic. 

Unlike the traditional animated sitcoms since The Simpsons, which mostly focuses on mother, father, no more than three kids all under 18, and the occasional grandparent or aunt as a side character, The Great North shows that families come in all shapes and sizes. The main cast consists of a single father, his four kids (more than most sitcoms depict unless it's groups stereotyped as having a lot of kids), a daughter-in-law and her brother, and a great-aunt rather than a grandparent. 
 
And of course, like every family, the Tobins aren't perfect and come with challenges. The main one being that Mama Kathleen abandons her family (which I also like how they chose mom rather than dad, as they could've played up the deadbeat dad stereotype) and the impact it had on her ex-husband and children. There's also a narcissistic and toxic Cousin Danica, Honeybee's parents as flawed but well-meaning, and Beef's special bond with Delmer as a father figure that isn't a blood relative (I particularly found this to hit close to home, as my grandma's ex-husband from my childhood also raised me as his grandson and I consider him my grandpa in every way even though he wasn't blood and my mom hated him). Then there's Uncle Brian, who could be a stand-in a long-distance relative that you don't get to see very often due to living far away and different lifestyles. 

The queer representation feels natural and positive. Ham and Aunt Dirt are the most notable ones. The way the writers handle Ham with his family being accepting of him for who he is and I also like how he's not being a walking stereotype of an effeminate, flamboyant gay guy but rather just being a secondary trait of his. Aunt Dirt's struggles with being from a time when homosexuality was condemned and getting used to being openly gay in the modern world is also handled well. Then there's other side characters, like Maude the coffee shop owner is implied to be transgender but is just accepted as who she is with no one so much as commenting on it or making a big deal out of it. Overall, I feel as though the show handles sexual orientation in ways that feel effortless. There's also the odd episode where Ham falls for an animatronic furry. While I didn't like the episode or the break-up with Crispin, I respect that the show portrayed it realistically without making Ham look like a sadistic weirdo. I've seen right wing comment bots on YouTube shorts criticizing the show for promoting a ""woke agenda"" and being glad that it got cancelled, but the truth is the show handled LGBTQ representation positively and accurately without shoving it down your throat or making a scene of it. 

Of course, queer relationships aren't all the show talks about. The show also explores heterosexual relationships across all ages and experiences with care, which brings me to my next point:

The show teaches lessons about all kinds of awkward romantic/sexual aspects: unrequited crushes, nervousness, jealously, making a move, one-night stands, losing your virginity, marriage, intimacy, young parenthood, and predatory or stalking behaviors, including a female-on-male situation with Beef and Zelda. The show handles rejection thoughtfully and shows that relationships progress at different speeds for different people. Some characters move into relationships quickly (Ham and Crispin), some build up slowly and over time (Moon and Quinn, Beef and Carissa), and some 
just don't work out for whatever reason or never get past the talking phase (Judy's various love interests). The show also teaches that things like holding hands, kissing, intimacy, etc are an emotional connection and do not require a serious commitment or pre-established relationship (such as Judy's kiss counts). Beef has a one-night stand with Greta, Judy has had many love interests and flings but isn't depicted as promiscuous, Moon and Quinn experience puppy love (which I know of many conservative adults who think it's inappropriate for children under about age 15 to be in relationships or act on their feelings; I also related to this as I kissed a girl on Valentine's Day when I was 3 lol), and Ham pretends to propose to Crispin without pressuring him and feels guilt when he thinks it's taken the wrong way. Platonic friendships like Bethany and Drama John also receive meaningful attention, and Gill positively handles unrequited crushes with him still being a friend to Judy and her being comfortable around him. The show kind of also frames it as Gill being a really sweet guy and it being Judy's loss for not wanting him, and the one time she did want him as her prom date, he already had a different girlfriend. The show also shows that feelings come and go, like how Moon and his friends get over their crush on Debbie, and that rejection isn't always personal failure, like how Dell rejected Beef despite having feelings for him. There's also Allyson being overt in her interest in Beef in the early seasons and him being completely oblivious to it for a while. 

Then there's the depiction of how family life can impact your romantic life. Examples of this being how Beef's parents being wild party people influenced his choice in getting with Kathleen, and how Wolf had awkward interactions with his mother-in-law Ruth because of his issues with his own mother. 

The friendships also carry meaningful lessons about what people should strive for in their own relationships. They show that friends can be family too, as Henry, Russel, Cheesecake, Kima, Amelia, etc. are often shown hanging out with the Tobins, as well as the Tobins hanging out with their friends' families. The show also explore all sorts of complex conflict dynamics, such as Moon and Russel's cousin treating Russel like a doormat at sleepovers, Walt's poor communication with Beef about the train belt, and Aunt Dirt and Jerry teaming up with each other in the finale despite being polar opposites. 

The show also explores professional relationships and acquaintances. The show teaches that employers/coworkers don't have to be strictly professional and can be friends outside of work, like Judy's close bond with her boss Alyson, and Beef and Londra's friendship. The same could be said about the school environment, with Principal Gibbons being friendly and authentic with his students, and Mr Golovkin opening up about his personal life. It also depicts toxic professional relationships, like Ms Macnamara. For acquaintances, characters of different ages who don't interact much are shown doing so positively, such as Moon's classmates interacting with Ham and Judy's classmates. 

The Great North handles all types of relationships in ways that feel thoughtful, nuanced, and grounded in reality. The lessons the show teaches can be applied to life and relationships. While it's not 100% perfect, accurate, realistic, or trustworthy, the writers clearly have drawn on real experiences and the present-day setting makes it relatable, unlike old sitcoms that have outdated values or were much more unrealistic/idealistic.

For someone who struggled with social skills before about age 16.5, this show provided me with guidance, modeled positive and negative behavior, and offered comfort. I have learned a lot about navigating life and relationships from watching it.",34,1759275567.0,TheGreatNorth,4,1.0,False

1nusrtt,https://www.reddit.com/r/jerseycity/comments/1nusrtt/cocoa_bakery/,Cocoa Bakery,"Tried them for the first time.  Their croissant was even better than Dulce de Leche.  Flaky and buttery and pockets of softness with nice morsels of chew.  Also, tried a vanilla cupcake.  It had, a mini short bread cookie on top.  The buttercream was the right amount of sweetness.  Surprised to find a custard filling, very nice touch.

Staff member Will was terrific and attentive.  He was also playing great music that he selected.  Was not expecting to hear French Singer Francoise Hardy.  Tres chic.

I do prefer the coffee at Dulce de Leche.  While they made a fresh cup for me, the notes were too bitter and burnt.  Just not my preference.  I do wish the cupcake was a little bigger or had a bit more butter cream and that yummy custard.  I understand they are using great ingredients. The cost of the cupcake was 3.25.  I'd pay 3.50 for a bit more of it. :)

I look forward to trying their truffles next time.  The cakes looked great.  Sadly, they stopped selling them by the slice.

Something to do with my GOAT mode switch, so they replaced it and I picked it up last wednesday night. Fast forward to Friday morning, Im out getting my morning coffee, and as im turning into a local gas station the ""dragging"" happens again, but VERY different this time. ALL of my tires felt like they were dragging, it shuddered my entire car the whole way into the parking spot (all the while my coffee is covering me because of how hard the car almost stopped in place while making the turn). Even when i put it into park, it shuddered VIOLENTLY. So I quickly turned it off, and as soon as I hit the push to start/stop my car lerched forward and back so hard I almost hit the yellow parking pole in front of my car. Needless to say its back at the dealership, I got a call yesterday that they couldn't get it to ""recreate"" the issue im having. No call today 9/30. 


Is anyone else having this issue, or heard of something like this!?!? I love my car so much, and i honestly hate the thought of having to get rid of her üò™",2,1759274564.0,BroncoSport,9,1.0,False

1nushjz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nushjz,"I've made a social media platform designed to foster actual connection, improve mental health and promote productivity","Hi, everyone :)

For the past couple of years, I've felt like my social media has stopped being social. It's now all about reels, time-wasting and appearing ""perfect"" instead of what Facebook was originally designed to do, which was help people work together and become closer. 40% of adults report feeling like their social media makes them feel worse after usage, be it due to the factor of an infinite use loop (causing addiction), or simply due to the fact that social media isn't used for what it's supposed to be used for.

So, I've been trying something out, basically as an experiment. The idea is simple: an app designed around connection and mental health, not content. A few of the things I‚Äôm trying out:

Smaller, closer circles¬†so you can share with the people who matter most, without the pressure of performing for everyone (no more 1k friends like on mainstream social media).

Conversations that keep going¬†instead of posts that vanish into a bottomless feed (posts get tied into threads).

Shared journals¬†(text or even short video) where people can reflect, vent, or just talk honestly ‚Äî and friends can check in when it matters.

Mood check-ins¬†that give friends a better sense of how you‚Äôre doing, instead of the usual fake bs on most people's feeds.

Gratitude walls¬†‚Äî simple prompts that encourage you to express appreciation and positivity, which can really change the tone of interactions.

Praising¬†- sending small tokens of appreciation in form of letters/notes to people who mean the most to you.

Community spaces around real interests, so people can connect through what they care about instead of being funneled into whatever the algorithm thinks will keep them hooked.

Group productivity and goal tools to help build a productive community within your own circle.

I'm interested in everyone's opinions. I personally believe this to be necessary, especially in today's world, but I'd love to hear if other people would find something like¬†this¬†useful.",1,1759274446.0,SideProject,0,1.0,False

So for context, my aunt (mid 30‚Äôs btw) who used to live across the country and was living off her boyfriend, well they broke up and has been living with my family since JULY 2024. My parents do the absolute most for her, she pays NO rent, has never helped out with any bills or groceries (eats the most food in the house by far), on her phone 24/7 using up all the wifi, they even provided her with a CAR. she works full time at a elementary school and god knows where all her paychecks go. She went on a month long trip this summer that she had absolutely no means to go on, was contacting family members basically the whole time asking for money, like i don‚Äôt get how someone could have the audacity to do that. So recently my parents decided they didn‚Äôt want to keep paying the insurance on the car she was using and said that she can pay for it from now on if she wants to use it. Basically, she can‚Äôt afford it, she‚Äôs in so much debt from that damn trip that she can‚Äôt even pay a cheap insurance policy. She now makes me drive her everywhere or just uses MY car anywhere she needs to go and i just can‚Äôt stand it anymore. Oh and btw she still buys weed, cigarettes, and expensive coffee regularly. She genuinely has no shame with how she‚Äôs living her life and it baffles me. At this point i‚Äôll be moved out of here before she is. ",1,1759274351.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

I love this man deeply and I know he loves me deeply too, but he says some deeply hurtful or creepy things eventually that put me off a lot. I know he doesn't do it with the intent of being those things, but that's how it comes off to people.

I will take a very long trip tomorrow and we will only be able to see each other in November, so we went out to eat lunch, have dessert and go through shops in a busy commercial area of our city.

After we ate, we entered a japanese kitchenware store and started browsing at the coffee supplies area. I said ""wow, a french press"" and he replied ""where are the hydraulic presses so I can crush your little hand?"". That really put me off and creeped me out. I said ""that's a really bizarre thing to say, why would you said this? it's not normal to say stuff like this"", he apologized more than once and we went through with our date.

Later, he was waiting with me for my uber to arrive and I told him I wanted to learn sign language because my college employs a lot of deaf people and I wanted to make them feel included by not forcing them to read my lips or read in my phone what I want to say. His response was ""that's pretty much useless in the long-run, it's only a very small percentage of the population that uses it, you should just type what you want to say"". I asked him what was the problem with wanting to learn it and he repeated his argument, I said ""that's a very selfish thought"", he said it was just pragmatic. He ultimately said it's ok if I wanted to learn, he just didn't feel it was necessary. 

My uber got there and we barely had time to say goodbye, but I was really put off by the things he said. When I told my brother about it later, his opinion was that he was ""increasingly becoming more of an asshole"" as time passes. Mind you, my brother really likes him.

Shortly after we met I moved into her place while still having my own house that I pay for. The first 6 months were great but at around 7 months it feels she has spiraled into a negative mindset about everything and everyone. I have been very supportive the last 5 months but it doesn‚Äôt seem she wants to get out of the negativity. For example if someone is driving slow, her fries are cold, or the coffee tastes bad her day is completely ruined along with everyone around her. I on the other hand look at everything as a glass half full perspective and don‚Äôt understand why these inconveniences dictate the rest of the day when there are much bigger problems. I don‚Äôt want to diminish her problems but when they consume every conversation and in turn make me feel guilty for not validating all of them it creates a disconnect. We come from different backgrounds as I have worked and paid for everything along with going through the death of a parent in high school. She has had and still has everything provided for her whenever she has needed which is great but sets unrealistic expectations and when those expectations aren‚Äôt met she makes it aware.

I love her a lot but she gets triggered everyday and I‚Äôm always on the receiving end which then turns into her apologizing and me having to comfort her every-time. I don‚Äôt mind comforting her but multiple times a day over something she created and takes out on me seems like manipulation. We have an argument atleast once a week and some of her outburst result in trashed apartments and things broken. I‚Äôm the polar opposite as I am very calm and don‚Äôt really get irritated. For reference I have had three other relationships with the longest one being four years and of those relationships I had maybe 5 arguments. Now averaging one a week makes me concerned and I‚Äôm not sure if that is normal and just part of the age we‚Äôre at or if this is unhealthy. We do love each other and can talk out our problems but sometimes it feels the problems are created for no reason and makes me disassociate. She has had very bad past relationships that she blames for her reactions but at a certain point she can‚Äôt keep using that as an excuse. If anyone has experienced the same thing please let me know? I know it is nothing crazy but I have worked to have a healthy mindset and want to protect it.

How can I maintain weight back at home?,"I‚Äôve lost 30ish lbs in the last 3 months living abroad in Italy. Im a 6‚Äô3, 23 year old man, started at 257 and am now estimated to be around 225 or so. I don‚Äôt have a belly anymore, I‚Äôm down from a 38 pant size to a 34, and my belt goes easily to the fourth loop. 

Turns out losing weight is relatively simple when you don‚Äôt have access to junk food and you walk a bit more. 

Honestly the biggest change for me is the fact that everyone eats later in the day here. Before I was binge eating at night because I was eating around 6 PM. I would get hungry in the evening around 11 PM.

Now I eat lunch at 1:30 and dinner at 8:30 PM. Breakfast is usually just a coffee and occasionally bread with jam or a croissant if I have breakfast. Lunches are a larger meal and dinner is a medium sized meal.

It‚Äôs also important that I never eat until I am full. Eating until I am not hungry rather is the importante part, and it is ok not finishing a meal. I cook almost daily, and while all of the ingredients are more fresh, I can recreate this easily at home in the US.

I walk probably less than I should, but since it‚Äôs hilly where I live, it doesn‚Äôt matter. Also working out is easier now that I‚Äôm lighter.

My next steps are to work out every day for 15-30 minutes by simple inclined pushups, resistance bands, stretching, and squatting. I‚Äôm also adding some additional body weight exercises like dead bugs.

I don‚Äôt feel like I used to, where I was starving most of the time. I also almost never snack, and when I do, it‚Äôs a few pieces or bites of fruit. I eat dessert maybe once a week which is actually fine. My cravings are significantly lower.

I actually don‚Äôt feel like losing much more weight. I‚Äôm happy with how I look, and I just want to keep the weight I‚Äôm at while gaining some more muscle. Would weight training along with my current diet keep me balanced back in the US? I return in two weeks.

My routine is usually fasting from 7pm - 12 - 1pm the next day. Timed around my work lunch. Although, I do take a multi vitamin, fish oil pills, and 2 cups of black coffee in the morning so I guess I technically don't fully fast but fuck it. 

After the gym I usually just do a protein shake. A scoop on Optimum Nutrition vanilla, a scoop of peanut powder, and a cup (give or take) of 2% milk. Roughly 280g kcal, 37g protein, 7g fat, and 18g carbs. Then I will chill for a little while before I make a meal that I often eat little snacks while making and then I have to tweak MF to fit my macros because I'm weak and stupid. 

However, while browsing the internet, I'm reading that there might be some benefits to consuming more carbs after the gym, how your body can sometimes leech off of your protein to make glucose, and maybe a little fruit as well could help? I'm still learning so much along the way, so forgive me if I sound dumb. 

I'm just wondering if there might be a more optimal after gym method than just my regular protein shake. I'm sure it's not a ticket to gain city or anything. But anything I can easily add to my routine for even marginally better results I'm all for it. ",4,1759274156.0,MacroFactor,9,1.0,False

Not including the coffee table book, affirmation cards, blood mystery school, mother‚Äôs medicine chest, and probably more I can‚Äôt remember!

I got into a fight with my husband after almost every purchase and didn‚Äôt even tell him about some. I hate to admit it but I have seen on here how some of the husbands see the red flags before we did. 

My questions for you are, with out shame or judgement, what courses did you buy (what year or how much was it at the time of purchase), how did each purchase affect your relationships/lives, could you realistically afford it at the time, did you wait for them to go on sale, did you get a scholarship or partial scholarship, did you ask a friend or family for a loan etc.

I think the financial aspect is important to bring up to highlight the obvious: they are grifters, they are in it for the money. 
Again NO judgment here - we were all trying to do our best for ourselves and our families. But I think sharing our experiences might help us see patterns we couldn‚Äôt see when we were in it and help others who are still in it now.

The air smelled rich and warm‚Äîcoffee beans, vanilla, a hint of cinnamon that reminded her of holidays. She moved toward the bulletin board near the door, pretending she wasn‚Äôt staring too long, but her eyes kept sliding over the flyers until one caught her.

It was simple. A sketch of two figures leaning together, their lines soft, unfinished. The words at the top read: Bodies in Love. An art contest. Deadline in three weeks.

Her fingers hovered near the paper before tugging a contact tab loose. She told herself she wasn‚Äôt serious. It was just something to think about, something to do besides unpacking boxes or walking hallways where everyone already knew each other.

‚ÄúHey‚Äîyou‚Äôre in my English class, right?‚Äù

Lena turned. Tyler, all easy grin and loud energy, sat at a nearby table with his soda. He waved her over like they‚Äôd been friends for years. She slid into the chair across from him, mostly because it felt rude not to.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre new here,‚Äù he said, like a fact he was proud to notice.

She nodded, folding the little tab into her notebook.

‚ÄúYou should come hang out sometime. A bunch of us get together after games. You like basketball?‚Äù

The word stuck in her throat before she pushed it out. ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ a little.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt true‚Äînot really. She liked the rhythm of sketching, the quiet of the beach, the way colors came alive under her pencil.

Tyler kept talking, but her thoughts had already slipped. Kam‚Äôs hazel eyes. The way her voice carried over the court, low and steady. The sharp pull in Lena‚Äôs chest when she remembered it.

Outside, her mom‚Äôs car rolled into the lot, headlights sweeping across the shop windows. Lena stood quickly, offering Tyler a polite wave before heading out. She climbed into the passenger seat, still clutching her notebook.

Her mom asked, ‚ÄúFind something to do while you waited?‚Äù

It was 2:14 a.m., and I‚Äôd just spent an hour scrolling mindlessly, promising myself, again, that I‚Äôd finally fix my sleep schedule. That‚Äôs when I saw the ad.

‚ÄúBoost your focus. Track your life. Never lose a single minute.‚Äù

The app was called Chronicle, and something about its slogan hooked me. I‚Äôd tried a million so-called productivity hacks before: time blocking, bullet journaling, those planners with cute stickers. None of them ever worked.

But this app promised something different. It claimed it could track my schedule automatically, even when I wasn‚Äôt logging anything. It said it knew what I was doing, even if I didn‚Äôt tell it.

It sounded too good to be true‚Ä¶ but at 2 a.m., half-delirious, I downloaded it anyway.

It opened to a sleek black screen with a single glowing question:

‚ÄúDo you agree to let Chronicle monitor your activities?‚Äù

I tapped Yes.

At first, it was amazing. When I woke up the next morning, Chronicle had already built a timeline:

* 7:48 ‚Äì 8:16 a.m.: Showering  
* 8:16 ‚Äì 8:34 a.m.: Making coffee  
* 8:34 ‚Äì 9:42 a.m.: Scrolling TikTok  

It was eerily precise. I hadn‚Äôt entered anything. Yet somehow, it knew exactly when I stepped into the shower, how long I stayed in the kitchen, even the black hole of wasted TikTok time.

The strangest part? I felt‚Ä¶ comforted. As if I wasn‚Äôt drifting anymore. As if my life was being watched, recorded. Even the meaningless in-between moments suddenly felt like they had weight.

I started using it obsessively over the next few days. Chronicle filled my life with crisp little entries and, for the first time in years, I felt like maybe I wasn‚Äôt wasting everything.

Then came the first anomaly. Thursday night.

I woke up groggy, throat dry, and reached for my phone. Chronicle had already logged the night:

* 11:42 p.m. ‚Äì 1:11 a.m.: Sleeping.
* 1:11 ‚Äì 2:07 a.m.: Standing outside neighbor‚Äôs window.  
* 2:07 ‚Äì 6:44 a.m.: Sleeping.

I blinked at the screen. Standing outside my neighbor‚Äôs window?

My neighbor, Claire, is an older woman. We barely speak. Why the hell would I be standing outside her window at one in the morning?

I laughed nervously and assumed it was a glitch. Maybe Chronicle had misread something, like me getting up for water. I almost deleted the app right then, but some dark, gnawing curiosity kept my finger from pressing uninstall.

Instead, I decided to test it.

The next night, I stayed awake on purpose. I sat at my desk with a Red Bull, Netflix playing softly in the background, making sure not to move. Around 2 a.m., I finally checked Chronicle.

* 12:07 ‚Äì 1:59 a.m.: Watching Netflix at desk.¬†
* 1:59 ‚Äì 2:41 a.m.: Standing outside neighbor‚Äôs window.

My stomach turned. I hadn‚Äôt moved. I hadn‚Äôt even gone near my front door. But Chronicle insisted I‚Äôd spent 42 minutes outside Claire‚Äôs window.

I locked the door. Closed all the blinds. Tried to convince myself I was just being paranoid.¬†

Monday morning, Claire was waiting for me in the hallway.

‚ÄúYou were out late last night, weren‚Äôt you?‚Äù she asked, frowning.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said, my heart pounding.

‚ÄúBecause I could‚Äôve sworn‚Ä¶‚Äù She trailed off, shaking her head. ‚ÄúNever mind. Sorry.‚Äù

She shuffled back into her apartment, but the way she looked at me made my skin crawl.

I opened Chronicle again. The entry was still there. Black text on a white background, carved into reality:

* 1:59 ‚Äì 2:41 a.m.: Standing outside neighbor‚Äôs window.

After that, the logs only got stranger.

Saturday:

* 3:12 ‚Äì 3:47 a.m.: Digging behind communal trash bins.

Sunday:

* 2:23 ‚Äì 3:02 a.m.: Watching someone sleep.

It didn‚Äôt even say who. Just‚Ä¶ someone.

Every time, the memory was gone. I‚Äôd been asleep, or awake, in my apartment the whole time. But Chronicle logged those missing hours with unnerving precision.

I tried recording myself at night with my phone‚Äôs camera. The footage showed me sound asleep in bed the entire time. No movement. No interruptions. And yet, when I checked Chronicle‚Ä¶

* 1:44 ‚Äì 2:19 a.m.: Standing on the edge of the highway overpass.

I stopped sleeping.

I stayed awake until my vision blurred, terrified that if I closed my eyes I‚Äôd wake up to another entry‚Ä¶ another life I didn‚Äôt remember living. My skin went pale. My eyes bloodshot. Coffee didn‚Äôt help. Neither did alcohol.

But Chronicle never stopped. It filled my nights with horrors I couldn‚Äôt explain.

* 2:01 ‚Äì 2:53 a.m.: Kneeling in the park, whispering.
* 3:17 ‚Äì 4:02 a.m.: Scratching the locked basement door.
* 1:36 ‚Äì 2:11 a.m.: Standing motionless at the intersection, watching cars pass.

I showed the app to my friends, desperate for reassurance. Most of them thought I‚Äôd been duped, that Chronicle was some elaborate ARG or viral marketing stunt. But when they tried to download it, it was gone from the App Store.

One night, I made a mistake. I decided to confront it. If the app said I was outside Claire‚Äôs window again, I‚Äôd go there myself. Prove it was fake.

So when Chronicle logged the entry‚Äî

* 1:58 ‚Äì 2:41 a.m.: Standing at neighbor‚Äôs window.

I grabbed my coat and ran downstairs.

The night air was cold, the apartment complex silent. I crept toward Claire‚Äôs window, heart hammering. Her curtains were drawn tight, but inside I could see the faint glow of her TV.

And then, as I stood there, my phone buzzed. A new entry appeared.

* 2:12 ‚Äì 2:13 a.m.: Watching yourself.

I froze. Slowly, I turned my head. Across the parking lot, in the shadow of the dumpsters, a figure stood. Tall. Motionless. My shape.

It didn‚Äôt move. Just stood there, holding a glowing rectangle in its hand.

My phone buzzed again.

* 2:13 ‚Äì 2:14 a.m.: Smiling.

The figure‚Äôs face split into a smile I could feel in my bones, too wide, too knowing.

I ran back inside, locked the door, and didn‚Äôt come out until sunrise. That was three weeks ago. Since then, I‚Äôve tried everything.

Deleting Chronicle. Factory-resetting my phone. Buying a new one. Nothing works. The app always comes back. No icon. No sign of installation. Just there, waiting, the next time I unlock my screen.

And the entries keep getting worse.

* 3:01 ‚Äì 3:44 a.m.: Practicing with the knife.  
* 4:11 ‚Äì 4:59 a.m.: Standing at the bedroom door, watching yourself sleep.  
* 2:22 ‚Äì 2:58 a.m.: Digging again. Almost ready.

Almost ready for what?

I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can take this. I‚Äôve stopped eating. I don‚Äôt leave the apartment. My friends stopped checking on me after I scared them with my rambling.

But tonight‚Ä¶ tonight was different. Chronicle logged something I can‚Äôt ignore.

* 1:44 ‚Äì 2:13 a.m.: Writing confession.
* 2:13 ‚Äì Present: Posting on Reddit.

And as I type these words, my phone buzzes again. One last entry slides into place, with the inevitability of a headstone:

* 2:07 ‚Äì 6:44 a.m.: Sleeping.

I blinked at the screen. Standing outside my neighbor‚Äôs window?

My neighbor, Claire, is an older woman. We barely speak. Why the hell would I be standing outside her window at one in the morning?

I laughed nervously and assumed it was a glitch. Maybe Chronicle had misread something, like me getting up for water. I almost deleted the app right then, but some dark, gnawing curiosity kept my finger from pressing uninstall.

Instead, I decided to test it.

The next night, I stayed awake on purpose. I sat at my desk with a Red Bull, Netflix playing softly in the background, making sure not to move. Around 2 a.m., I finally checked Chronicle.

* 12:07 ‚Äì 1:59 a.m.: Watching Netflix at desk.¬†
* 1:59 ‚Äì 2:41 a.m.: Standing outside neighbor‚Äôs window.

My stomach turned. I hadn‚Äôt moved. I hadn‚Äôt even gone near my front door. But Chronicle insisted I‚Äôd spent 42 minutes outside Claire‚Äôs window.

I locked the door. Closed all the blinds. Tried to convince myself I was just being paranoid.¬†

Monday morning, Claire was waiting for me in the hallway.

‚ÄúYou were out late last night, weren‚Äôt you?‚Äù she asked, frowning.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said, my heart pounding.

‚ÄúBecause I could‚Äôve sworn‚Ä¶‚Äù She trailed off, shaking her head. ‚ÄúNever mind. Sorry.‚Äù

She shuffled back into her apartment, but the way she looked at me made my skin crawl.

I opened Chronicle again. The entry was still there. Black text on a white background, carved into reality:

* 1:59 ‚Äì 2:41 a.m.: Standing outside neighbor‚Äôs window.

After that, the logs only got stranger.

Saturday:

* 3:12 ‚Äì 3:47 a.m.: Digging behind communal trash bins.

Sunday:

* 2:23 ‚Äì 3:02 a.m.: Watching someone sleep.

It didn‚Äôt even say who. Just‚Ä¶ someone.

Every time, the memory was gone. I‚Äôd been asleep, or awake, in my apartment the whole time. But Chronicle logged those missing hours with unnerving precision.

I tried recording myself at night with my phone‚Äôs camera. The footage showed me sound asleep in bed the entire time. No movement. No interruptions. And yet, when I checked Chronicle‚Ä¶

* 1:44 ‚Äì 2:19 a.m.: Standing on the edge of the highway overpass.

I stopped sleeping.

I stayed awake until my vision blurred, terrified that if I closed my eyes I‚Äôd wake up to another entry‚Ä¶ another life I didn‚Äôt remember living. My skin went pale. My eyes bloodshot. Coffee didn‚Äôt help. Neither did alcohol.

But Chronicle never stopped. It filled my nights with horrors I couldn‚Äôt explain.

* 2:01 ‚Äì 2:53 a.m.: Kneeling in the park, whispering.
* 3:17 ‚Äì 4:02 a.m.: Scratching the locked basement door.
* 1:36 ‚Äì 2:11 a.m.: Standing motionless at the intersection, watching cars pass.

I showed the app to my friends, desperate for reassurance. Most of them thought I‚Äôd been duped, that Chronicle was some elaborate ARG or viral marketing stunt. But when they tried to download it, it was gone from the App Store.

One night, I made a mistake. I decided to confront it. If the app said I was outside Claire‚Äôs window again, I‚Äôd go there myself. Prove it was fake.

So when Chronicle logged the entry‚Äî

* 1:58 ‚Äì 2:41 a.m.: Standing at neighbor‚Äôs window.

I grabbed my coat and ran downstairs.

The night air was cold, the apartment complex silent. I crept toward Claire‚Äôs window, heart hammering. Her curtains were drawn tight, but inside I could see the faint glow of her TV.

And then, as I stood there, my phone buzzed. A new entry appeared.

* 2:12 ‚Äì 2:13 a.m.: Watching yourself.

I froze. Slowly, I turned my head. Across the parking lot, in the shadow of the dumpsters, a figure stood. Tall. Motionless. My shape.

It didn‚Äôt move. Just stood there, holding a glowing rectangle in its hand.

My phone buzzed again.

* 2:13 ‚Äì 2:14 a.m.: Smiling.

The figure‚Äôs face split into a smile I could feel in my bones, too wide, too knowing.

I ran back inside, locked the door, and didn‚Äôt come out until sunrise. That was three weeks ago. Since then, I‚Äôve tried everything.

Deleting Chronicle. Factory-resetting my phone. Buying a new one. Nothing works. The app always comes back. No icon. No sign of installation. Just there, waiting, the next time I unlock my screen.

And the entries keep getting worse.

* 3:01 ‚Äì 3:44 a.m.: Practicing with the knife.  
* 4:11 ‚Äì 4:59 a.m.: Standing at the bedroom door, watching yourself sleep.  
* 2:22 ‚Äì 2:58 a.m.: Digging again. Almost ready.

Almost ready for what?

I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can take this. I‚Äôve stopped eating. I don‚Äôt leave the apartment. My friends stopped checking on me after I scared them with my rambling.

But tonight‚Ä¶ tonight was different. Chronicle logged something I can‚Äôt ignore.

Let‚Äôs say you could make 150k a year cleaning shitty toilets, is that really a good career, or if you made 25 an hour to just sit around watching TV and playing video games, would that be considered bad?

I‚Äôm 23, I‚Äôve made over 110k the last few years without paying rent and without a degree, working two jobs, one job is 40 hours a week where I put in a good bit of OT, it‚Äôs so boring, and the other outside in the sun, rain, heat, and cold for my family‚Äôs business, grinding 60+ hours a week combined from both jobs until I was just done with it.

Now I signed into a new job where I literally do almost nothing most of the day making 75k a year. 80 percent of my shift is playing on my Steam Deck or Xbox, taking a two hour lunch, hitting the gym for an hour, and then ‚Äúworking‚Äù by scrolling my phone, bullshitting with coworkers, making coffee, watching the news, clicking through emails, order shit, and tracking whatever needs tracking and updating spreadsheets. 

This job is literally like something out of a sitcom, I can go to Walmart in the middle of the day if I feel like it.

People say I should use that free time to get a degree but why would I, most jobs would just put some manager on my ass while I stress out chasing deadlines. Right now I get paid to live life on easy mode, stay healthy, and I don‚Äôt wanna sound like a spoiled fucker but my parents own properties overseas so I‚Äôm basically set for life and on top of that I drive an almost paid off 2025 truck.

But at what point do you stop being impressed by cousins or friends flexing their jobs or the house they‚Äôre buying. Like cool bro, enjoy being told to grind harder and harder just because your boss says so you‚Äôre basically a slave to the system.",5,1759273900.0,Career,18,1.0,False
1nusa5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/1nusa5l/worst_interview_ive_ever_had/,worst interview i‚Äôve ever had,"this took place about a year or two ago, it was a position for a housekeeping supervisor for context

prior to the interview the hiring manager called me and we had a brief, almost pretty light hearted chat, it felt like we really clicked

then the day of the interview came, i rocked up 15 mins early, let reception know i was in and who i was waiting for, and then waited in the lobby. and waited. and waited. 10 mins pass, i shoot her a text to confirm our interview and time, no reply. 10 more mins pass, i go back up to reception to get them to check that the hiring manager is still in and that i am ‚Äî in fact ‚Äî at the right hotel. in total i end up waiting an hour with reception insisting i stay and wait for her every time i get up to leave

the housekeeping manager themselves come down to chat to me to bide her some time, we have a lengthy chat about my experience and the expectations of the role

the hiring manager eventually comes casually strolling in with a coffee in hand and a smile on her face. she tells me she forgot our interview and scheduled a meeting at the same time. doesn‚Äôt thank me for waiting, nor do the words ‚Äúi‚Äôm sorry‚Äù leave her mouth. she proceeds to ask me a few questions that the housekeeping supervisor already covered, then she starts asking irrelevant personal questions, like if i live with family or out of home. i admit i live with my parents and she screws her nose up at me and then assumes i‚Äôm on government benefits and tells me her son was ‚Äúlike me‚Äùand that she kicked him out at 18. i try to laugh it off, at this point i felt in way too deep to just up and leave. she then turns to the housekeeping supervisor and starts asking her about lunch plans and they‚Äôre both having a laugh about something. the housekeeping supervisor leaves and the hiring manager turns to me and tells me i‚Äôm not qualified for the role but she‚Äôll offer me a casual housekeeping role instead

i of course don‚Äôt accept the offer and at that point shake her hand and leave. in hindsight i should‚Äôve high tailed it outta there when she was 20 mins late because i know i never would‚Äôve been given the courtesy of being patiently waited on

i remember laughing as soon as i stepped out of the hotel lobby because i‚Äôve had some bad interviews in my time but i‚Äôve never met a hiring manager so entitled and rude in my life ??? im just thankful i was able to laugh it off as i was in a really bad spot financially and mentally and really could‚Äôve used the money and the opportunity, but i feel it was a bullet dodged if it meant i had to work with staff like that",4,1759273895.0,interviews,2,1.0,False

It was 2:14 a.m., and I‚Äôd just spent an hour scrolling mindlessly, promising myself, again, that I‚Äôd finally fix my sleep schedule. That‚Äôs when I saw the ad.

‚ÄúBoost your focus. Track your life. Never lose a single minute.‚Äù

The app was called Chronicle, and something about its slogan hooked me. I‚Äôd tried a million so-called productivity hacks before: time blocking, bullet journaling, those planners with cute stickers. None of them ever worked.

But this app promised something different. It claimed it could track my schedule automatically, even when I wasn‚Äôt logging anything. It said it knew what I was doing, even if I didn‚Äôt tell it.

It sounded too good to be true‚Ä¶ but at 2 a.m., half-delirious, I downloaded it anyway.

It opened to a sleek black screen with a single glowing question:

‚ÄúDo you agree to let Chronicle monitor your activities?‚Äù

I tapped Yes.

At first, it was amazing. When I woke up the next morning, Chronicle had already built a timeline:

* 7:48 ‚Äì 8:16 a.m.: Showering  
* 8:16 ‚Äì 8:34 a.m.: Making coffee  
* 8:34 ‚Äì 9:42 a.m.: Scrolling TikTok  

It was eerily precise. I hadn‚Äôt entered anything. Yet somehow, it knew exactly when I stepped into the shower, how long I stayed in the kitchen, even the black hole of wasted TikTok time.

The strangest part? I felt‚Ä¶ comforted. As if I wasn‚Äôt drifting anymore. As if my life was being watched, recorded. Even the meaningless in-between moments suddenly felt like they had weight.

I started using it obsessively over the next few days. Chronicle filled my life with crisp little entries and, for the first time in years, I felt like maybe I wasn‚Äôt wasting everything.

Then came the first anomaly. Thursday night.

I woke up groggy, throat dry, and reached for my phone. Chronicle had already logged the night:

* 11:42 p.m. ‚Äì 1:11 a.m.: Sleeping.
* 1:11 ‚Äì 2:07 a.m.: Standing outside neighbor‚Äôs window.

1nus65s,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nus65s/weird_fishes/,Weird Fishes,"""Welcome aboard, Terrence, me lad!"" The Captain's voice thundered out, drawing a dark look from the woman sitting in the booth behind him. His outburst had shattered the quiet atmosphere of Linda's Roadside Diner, and when she dropped her coffee cup it had shattered in much the same way. As she fussed over her scrambled eggs, I poked at my own and thought adding some coffee might be an improvement. 


I had spent my last two dollars on the plate of runny eggs. They tasted faintly of salmon, and I quietly cursed the cook for making my eggs in the same pan as the Captain's fish. He had noticed me from across the diner and come to sit in my booth. He said he saw hunger in me, and laughed heartily when I dryly pointed out where we were. 


""You'll fit right in, me boy."" The Captain's smile carried a sense of implicit brotherhood. 


He had been right, of course. I was hungry, and I was very broke. When I left home to travel the world as a vagabond, I had underestimated the amount of desperation I would face. I remember worrying that I had come across as overeager when I accepted the job offer. I would be joining his crew for a three day commercial fishing voyage, with halibut as our quarry. 


I finished my meal without saying another word as the Captain gushed about his boat, his crew, and the open ocean. 


We drove together for three hours to a dock somewhere in the northern half of Massachusetts. There were many times I found myself fearing that the Captain's ancient Pontiac might break down and leave us stranded somewhere along I-95. I was so thankful to have arrived without incident that I had completely forgotten there were others who would be joining us. Hauling my heavy luggage, I let my eyes wander over the area. The sand here looked dull, as if the color had been muted somehow from the usual beige sands into a depressing, greyish facsimile of the color sand is meant to be. The dock, well, ramshackle would have been too kind a word. The small staircase sat askew, with handrails held together by nails plainly visible in the overcast gloom of the afternoon. The rails had been pulled away from their posts by gravity as the rest of the dock drifted out to sea. 


As we made our way up the ragged stairs, I found myself thinking that the Captain looked every bit as creaky and dilapidated as the dock. His gait was dramatically marred by a limp of the left leg, as if it were slightly shorter than his right. His right arm swung freely as he moved, while the left dangled stiffly at his side. I wondered if the Captain, like the dock, had been stretched and distorted by the force which, like the shifting tides, pulled him out to the sea. 


""Ain't she a beauty, me lad?"" The Captain breathed out the question with awe and admiration laced into his voice. 


The ship was in much better shape than the dock. It was right around 40 feet long, with clean sleek siding. The absence of any marring of the hull told me that either the Captain was incredibly vigilant in the removal of barnacles, or the barnacles had never chosen to attach themselves to the ship to begin with. The cabin was relatively spacious, painted stark white contrasting beautifully against the ocean‚Äôs surface and the grey clouds above. Cursive letters, painted in red, told me the name of the ship. ""The Minnow."" 


""I'll say."" I muttered half-heartedly. It was a beautiful ship, but I was not a man with an eye for such things. ""Your boat is certainly much nicer than your car."" 


The sound of the Captain's laughter told me my risky remark had been worth it. He left me to settle in, claiming that he had to make sure everything was ready to go. I was putting my bags away in what meager storage the ship could afford me when I heard something that made me jump. 


It was a voice, low, and slow. Deeper and more cracked than any human voice I've heard before or since. It rasped out to me from the darkest corner of the room. 


""Hi! Oh, sorry. Frog in my throat! Haha."" He cleared his throat and spoke again. This time, his voice was perfectly ordinary. ""I'm Jared. Nice to meet you."" 


Jared got up and stepped into the negligible light which seeped down into the crew's quarters. He was Asian, possibly Chinese, with jeans that looked too big for him, and a jacket to match. 


""Nice to meet you too, I'm Terrence. Terrence Howard. Not that one, though, obviously."" I kicked myself for unnecessarily clarifying that I am not Hollywood star Terrence Howard. If I was going to be spending a week at sea with these guys, I couldn't afford to make myself out to be a weirdo. 


""Pleased to make your acquaintance, Terrence Howard. I loved you in Iron Man. So, where did the Captain find you? He picked me up from outside a Home Depot."" I don't know if people know this about being homeless, but you don't get too many folks interested in your life story. I seized on the opportunity with more gusto than I probably should have, and by the end of the night, Jared and I were on track to becoming fast friends. 


Besides Jared and I, there were three others on the vessel, not including the Captain. There was John Laramie, an elderly man with a peg leg and the face of a bulldog, who would be serving as the Captain's first mate. Then there were Jimmy and Timmy Brakovich, Russian twins who had fled their homeland to evade service in the war against Ukraine. These two would be working with Jared and I as deckhands. We had all made our introductions, and we were tickled to find that every one of us had been vagrants before crossing paths with Captain Yorke. I joined several others in ribbing the Captain about his crew of runaways and vagabonds, and as we laughed I caught sight of the last member of the crew. 


He had stood in abject silence, never uttering a word. Instead of joining in any conversations he simply flicked his shallow, verdant eyes from person to person, as if observing us. Hoping to garner as much information about others while sharing none about himself. I made my way over to break the ice. 


""Hello, I'm Terrance Howard."" His only response to this was to raise his eyebrows, so I pushed on. ""Where are you from?"" 


He didn't reply, he simply kept his eyes locked on mine and gave an insincere smile. Something in the way he was looking at me, saying nothing, made my skin crawl. The longer we stood together in silence, the more frightened of him I became. We were adrift in the endless expanse of the Earth's oceans, surrounded on all sides by the darkness of the early morning, and yet the most terrifying part of it all was this man. This implacable statue, standing tall and silently staring accusation into my soul. 

""Ah, that's Jeff! He's a friendly enough fella, but completely incapable of speech, I fear. He's what they call a mute."" The Captain had appeared, as if out of thin air, directly behind me. 


The tension I had felt melted away. I kicked myself for leaping to thoughts of paranormal stowaways before considering a simple disability. I reached out to shake Jeff's hand, and was pleased when he reciprocated the gesture. His hand was rough like sandpaper against my own, and wonderfully warm against the brisk morning winds. 


The Captain excused himself from my company and made his way forward to address the crew. 


""Alright, lads. We've got a long week of hard fishing ahead."" The Captain droned out, with the last word of the sentence trailing off. ""We set out nets at first light, go get some grub and be ready when the time comes."" There was elation in the Captain's voice. I could tell that he lived for these voyages. 


Jared and I sat together at breakfast, without much of anything to talk about. We had been discussing the most recent season of ""The Masked Singer"" when the Captain flung open the door and called us all to our tasks. 


The day's work passed by in such a blur that I could hardly believe it when I first saw the moon. There was something therapeutic in the mindless labor. We had been laughing and joking amongst ourselves so much that the work had stopped feeling like work at all. That mood, unfortunately, wouldn't last. 


The Captain stood before us in the dining area that night, noticeably shorter than when we had departed. I had a hard time putting my finger on what was giving me the impression that the Captain was profoundly sorrowful, but I figured it out about halfway through his speech. Something in his face had shifted, giving way for his eyeballs to become ever so slightly larger than they had been. 


""Is the Captain sick or something? He looked kinda off today."" I mused to Jared as we lay down for the night. 


""Dunno, I didn't notice anything. Why?"" He replied. 


""I'm not sure. It's probably nothing."" I said, deciding to drop the subject. I told myself I couldn't lie awake all night thinking about things I had probably just imagined. 


The next morning, I found myself working closely with the first mate, Mr. Laramie. We had been assigned to the gutting and freezing of the previous day's catch. 


""So Mr. Laramie,"" I picked up a halibut with a particularly sad look in its dead eyes and sliced it from tip to tail, ""Where are you from?"" 


""S'best not to talk, boy. Ye'll get the guts in yer mouth."" He spat the sentence out at me, and I took the cue to shut up. 


We worked together in silence, processing the hundred or so fish which felt like thousands at the time. 


""Okay, but you can at least tell me where you're fr-"" my sentence died in my throat. A particularly full stomach had fallen from the halibut Mr. Laramie had just gutted, landing with a crash and sending a ribbon of fish intestine soaring into my mouth. The scrap of viscera landed on my tongue, leaving behind an oily, bitter film. Mr. Laramie laughed hysterically as I retched over a barrel. 



After ten minutes of scraping my tongue and gargling seawater, I was ready to return to work. 


""Y'alright now, boy?"" Mr. Laramie had softened significantly after laughing at my misfortune. 


""Yeah, I'm fine. Pass me that stomach I want to see what the hell this thing ate."" He handed me the stomach, and I sliced it open. I had expected a workboot and another round of laughs. I had not expected a small, humanoid being with large, bulbous eyes which hung suspended from stalks protruding from where the eye socket would typically be found on a human. 


""Go fetch the cap'n."" Mr. Laramie whispered, with his face stark white in the fluorescent light of the ship's processing station. 


The Captain followed me back to the station while I tried, and failed, to explain what we'd found. When he entered the cramped room full of death and viscera, his eyes instantly locked on the tiny corpse. 


""WHAT IN THE BLUE BLAZES HAVE YE DONE? I OUGHT TO THROW THE BOTH OF YE OUT INTO THE BLOODY SEA AND LET HER HAVE HER WAY WITH YE."" The Captain had flown into a rage, with tears in his eyes and a face as red as an apple's ass. 


""Now hol' on Cap'n, it weren't the boy's fault we were ju-"" I appreciated Mr. Laramie defending me, but Captain Yorke clearly did not. He cut Laramie off mid-sentence. 


""So yer saying it was you then, are ye Mr. Laramie? Ye and ye alone killed that poor child? Twas ye who may doom us all then, aye, Mr. Laramie?"" His accent shifted in strange ways as the anger waxed and waned. 


""No! No Captain, it were the fish what did it. The boy and I found the poor thing dead in the belly of a halibut."" Mr. Laramie seemed like he might cry. I hoped he wouldn't, as I've never been able to handle the sight of an old man crying. 


The Captain's rage had died immediately once he understood what had happened. He solemnly crossed the room, and discard the body into the sea. 


""Neither of ye are to speak of this."" The Captain muttered, turning on his heel to storm out of the room. 


""What the fuck was that?"" I asked Mr. Laramie, who was clearly just as perplexed. He just stared back at me, stunned, with his jaw hanging open. 


When Jared asked me how working with the first mate had been,  I thought about telling him the truth. In the end, I decided to obey the Captain and keep it to myself. 


""It was...fine."" I said. Better to lie by omission. 


""Well you really missed out today. You know those Russian fellas? Well, they were doing this bit where they got on either end of a fish and pretended they were fu-"" Listening to the stories of the day's hijinks brought me peace enough that I fell asleep while he spoke. 


I was the first to wake the next morning, and I made my way onto the deck to enjoy the sea breeze air. I decided to walk laps around the deck, and it wasn't until the third or fourth lap that my foot brushed against him. Mr. Laramie was lying flat on the deck, barely concealed between two fishing nets. I pulled the nets away, and revealed his pale, bloated face. His wrinkled skin had allowed the bloating to reach an unimaginable degree. A thin trail of water trickled from his mouth, and in desperation I turned him onto his side. If he had drowned, then there was a chance he could be resuscitated, or at least thats what I had thought at the time. 


When I turned him, gallons of water began to pour rapidly from his now open mouth, carrying out hundreds of tiny orbs. His skin began to visibly sag, progressing further and further until Mr. Laramie was left as nothing more than a sack of crumpled skin lying on the deck. 


The thing they don't tell you about being out at sea, is that the winds steal away the sound of your screams. I'm not sure how long I sat there in the dark, pawing at the crumpled remIns of Mr. Laramie and screaming for help which could not hear me. 


 I shuffled myself to the Captain's quarters in a daze. When he finally answered my pounding at his door, I could only point towards the area where I had found the body. I followed him over, stopping just short of where the body would be visible. I heard the Captain shout in horror, and he rushed off to rouse the crew. 


We all coped with the incredibly bizarre death of the first mate in different ways. Jimmy and Timmy had brought along large combat knives, and they were using them to put on what they called a ""show of force against our unseen attacker."" Jared and I sunk ourselves as far into the work, the routine, as humanly possible. I just wanted to get the trip done and move on. You can imagine the despair I felt when the ship unexpectedly lurched before coming to a complete stop. 


The engine had been clearly and brutally sabotaged, with fuel lines which looked more like they'd been ripped than cut. 


I stared at the decimated engine in disbelief. The Captain reached out and put his hand on my shoulder. It was cold, and my shirt was left wet when he pulled back. 


""S'alright, lad. Jimmy and Timmy here'll have us fixed up in no time. Just think of how many fish we'll catch while we wait, me boy!"" His eyes did something strange then. They seemed to move and stretch, as if trying to separate from one another. 


""Captain... are you feeling well?"" I asked, genuinely concerned. 


""Never better, me boy!"" Once again his eyeballs seemed to try and flee from each other. ""Now let's get to work!"" 


Jared and I tried to make small talk while we worked through the day, but mostly we just stood around in a daze. Our situation had grown incredibly dire, incredibly quickly. 



He was the first one who found Timmy that night. We were awoken by a massive clatter. Timmy and his brother, Jimmy,  had been working through the night to get us back up and running. Something had slashed Timmy viciously down his torso, spilling his guts out into his lap where he sat slumped against the engine. His mouth was moving in an attempt to speak last words, but none would come. He reminded me of one of the fish we had caught. Uselessly bumping his gums against each other in some vain attempt at one last act. We spread out and searched through the ship, but Jimmy was nowhere to be found. 


Jared and I called an emergency meeting of the remaining crew. Together, we accused the Captain, whose eyes had grown more tubular in their shape and at least twice their usual size, of being some sort of demon.


""A demon? Listen to yerself, lad. What kind of demon would I be? What kind of demon would take a boatload of fuckheads like you on a fishing voyage, let alone pay you? Far as I'm concerned, Jeff here is the only one a ya that's worth a damned dime.""


Jeff, the mute, had apparently taken the Captain's side. The last time I ever saw him, he was glaring back at me over his shoulder in anger. We divided the ship into two sections, fore and aft. The food and water would be kept in the middle to provide access to both parties. 


By this point, with Jeff disappearing overnight, there were only the three of us left. Jared and I slept in shifts, and so far neither one of us had seen anything. The standoff lasted a few days, before we walked out onto the deck to find the Captain with our food and water teetering on the ship's edge. 


""You can't hide from me forever, lads,"" he gently nudged our bottled water out into the waves, ""it's just us out here."" And he followed it up with the food. 


I shut the door. There was no more sense in going out if there was no supplies out there. We planned to escape via life raft, but a storm had blown in. It stayed for two days. On the second night of the storm, during my turn to take the watch, I succumbed to my exhaustion and fell asleep. 


I woke up two hours later in a panic. The storm had passed, and the sun was high in the sky. Jared was gone. I rushed out onto the deck, finding the Captain squatting over his lifeless, bloated form. I fell to my knees, buckling under the weight of sheer hopelessness. Captain Yorke turned to face me, and I saw his eyes had ballooned to ridiculous proportions, each as large as a soccer ball. They drooped down by his cheeks as the eyestalks they were mounted on failed to support the weight. The stalks themselves were grotesque, like sea sponges comprised of taut human skin. The Captain had visibly shrunken in terms of height, with his limbs growing thicker and less flexible but more powerful in a way which was horribly apparent. 


I wanted to pick myself up and flee back to the perceived safety of the room, but there was no point. I was going to have to sleep at some point. Even if he didn't come for me, I'd die to dehydration or starvation within days. My mouth had become so dry that my tongue felt like a wad of sandpaper prodding desperately for any trace of saliva. I resigned myself to death as the Captain leaped across the deck and landed on my chest. 


He held me firmly in place, distending his jaw and placing my entire head in his mouth. His icy lips locked around my neck, forming a seal. The afternoon sun bled red through the skin of his cheeks, providing just enough light to see water trickling in to the Captain's mouth. I struggled to free myself from him for five minutes which each felt like an hour. As the water level rose, I was able to smell the fact that it was not sea water. It was fresh. Drinkable. I was so desperate that I might have done it, if it hadn't been for the tiny orbs I'd felt bumping against every inch of submerged skin. My mouth was eventually covered, and the fluid had risen to just below my nose when I finally managed to break a hand free from the grasp of Captain Yorke. I flailed wildly, grabbed the first thing my hand found and pulled. 


A splash echoed across the deck as the Captain released me and began to howl in pain. I had grabbed his eyestalk, and pulled the whole thing clean off. I didn't waste my moment. I grabbed the other eye and yanked until it separated with a sickening squelch. The Captain stumbled blindly, slashing at the air with fingernails elongated into vicious claws. When he wandered too close to the edge, I delivered a kick which sent him plunging into the briny deep. I collapsed on the spot. 


I'm not sure how long I lay there drifting aimlessly through the sea. I'm pretty sure the dehydration affected my memory, as it's mostly just a blank. I do remember one night though. I'd say, maybe two days after I had killed Captain Yorke, I saw Jared's body suddenly shift, turning his head to lay against the deck. I heard water rushing out of his mouth and out toward the sea, and then, a few minutes later, I heard a tiny splash from the side of the ship. Like something very small had fallen, or jumped, down into the churning waves of the Atlantic. Then another. And another. Then ten more, and another ten after that until I had become completely convinced that there were thousands of *somethings* in the water all around. 


I was found a couple days later by a friendly fisherman who fed me and gave me water.  He even let me use his phone to get messages out to what few friends and family I have left. He said he's going to take me to his hometown to rest up before he drives me down to West Virginia. I'm going home to see my family again. I think of Jared and the others. I only just met them, and now they're dead and gone. I need to be somewhere that I'm known, no matter how bad it might be. Just a few days of rest in Innsmouth and then I'll be on my way.
