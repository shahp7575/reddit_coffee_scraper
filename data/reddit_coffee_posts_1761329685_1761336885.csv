Your narrow lanes where the Roman once passed dream in the night of other things than do the evanescent creatures that tread your stones. O you strange town! Your every stone holds as many old memories as there are motes of dust. Every one of your grey quiet stones has seen a witch's long hair catch fire, a pale astronomer mobbed, a beggar kicked in the groin by another beggar-- and the King's horses struck sparks from you, and the dandies in brown and the poets in black repaired to the coffee houses while you dripped with slops to the merry echoes of gardyloo. Town of dreams, a changing dream, O you, stone changeling. The little shops all shuttered in the clean night, the gaunt walls, the niche shared by the homeless pigeon with a sculptured churchman, the rose window, the exuded gargoyle, the jester who slapped Christ-- lifeless carvings and dim life mingling their feathers. ... Not for the wheels of oil-maddened engines were your narrow and rough streets designed-- and as the car stopped at last and bulky Beuret crawled out in the wake of his beard, the anonymous muser who had been sitting beside him was observed to split into two, producing by sudden gemination Gleeman, the frail Professor of Medieval Poetry, and the equally diminutive Yanovsky, who taught Slavic scansion-- two newborn homunculi now drying on the paleolithic pavement.",1,1761336696.0,RSbookclub,0,1.0,False
1of83j2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1of83j2,My [mostly] DIY kitchen refresh is [mostly] complete!,"My kitchen refresh story:

I bought a ""flipper special"" in 2018. We didn’t have the purchasing power to get a house with a designer kitchen, so the builder-grade would have to do. The kitchen was new, and it was the least of our problems, so we didn’t rush to redo it. I’ve spent the past seven years making countless improvements around the house and undoing a lot of sloppy work. At last, I’m at a place where I can take on “want to” instead of “need to” projects. I’ve been developing the design IQ, skillset, and tool collection to be able to tackle big home projects. This kitchen refresh took about nine months, and the only things I contracted were the countertops and the lower cabinet painting. I did all the carpentry, electrical, plumbing, tiling, and more.

 

As far as the original kitchen went, here's the good, the bad, and the ugly:

The Good:

·         Functional layout, ample storage, tall upper cabinets

·         Cabinet boxes are made of plywood (not particle board), so they were worth keeping

The Bad:

·         Safety hazards hidden in the walls (i.e. improperly spliced wires)

·         Too few circuits. One circuit ran the lights, the countertop outlets, the dishwasher, and the microwave (among other things), and one ran the fridge, coffee bar, and washing machine (directly below the kitchen in the basement)

The Ugly:

·         overall vibe was dark and heavy

·         veneer on cabinets was chipping and peeling

·         low-quality appliances--the ones you see in an airbnb

  
**The scope of the refresh (and approximate costs):**

·         upper cabinet face frames and doors in natural maple--$700

·         lower cabinet doors and drawer fronts in poplar/birch -- $400

·         lower cabinet painting (professionally done) -- $3200

·         floating corner shelves -- $200

·         spice rack -- $150

·         cabinet hardware -- $150

·         window replacement -- $1300

·         quartz countertops (professionally fabricated and installed) -- $4600

·         under-cabinet lighting (LED strips, power supply, wire) -- $300

·         various electrical parts -- $200

·         garbage disposal and new sink plumbing -- $100

·         pendant light fixture -- $40

·         wall paint (in progress!) -- $60

·         full tile backsplash -- $800

 

**Appliances:**

·         Kitchenaid flush-design OTR microwave -- $600

·         Cafe Induction Range with extended warranty -- $4800

·         Thermador freestanding refrigerator with extended warranty -- $3000  (half-off floor model!)

·         Thermador sapphire dishwasher with extended warranty -- $1400 (half-off floor model!)



**APPROXIMATE TOTAL: $22,000**

 

**Some intentional details of the new design:**

·         The rounded floating shelves are a functional improvement. My big bowls didn’t fit in any of the upper cabinets before, and the old corner cabinet was huge and not well-utilized. I made these with butcher block and a router/circle jig

·         There are now 3 circuits for countertop outlets, and dedicated circuits for lighting and each appliance. 8 circuits in total, up from 2.

·         The under-cabinet lighting is recessed into a channel at the front edge of the cabinet

·         The flush-design microwave is purely an aesthetic improvement, but I’m convinced it’s the best design when one needs an over-the-range microwave.

·         The lower cabinet color has a slight blue tinge, and doesn’t go so heavily into sage green. But also, I like sage green even though it’s a bit trendy. I could have saved money by doing a DIY, but after finishing the upper cabinet doors myself, that was a nonstarter. I wanted a high-quality professional finish.

·         The terracotta backsplash on the coffee bar was my attempt at doing something a little bolder to give some personality. I won’t take it personally if you don’t like it. I wanted to do something a little unexpected.

I, 19F, have quite a few issues with food consumption - I have not pursued an ARFID diagnosis but the symptoms align strongly enough that it's a very good comparison. TLDR, I have a specific list of foods that I can stomach, and while they're healthy enough I'm not sure that I'm getting all the daily nutrients I need to be healthy and happy.

My ""safe foods"" consist of tinned tuna, cucumbers, frozen tropical fruit (pineapple, passionfruit, strawberries, mango, etc.) blended with milk and orange juice into smoothies, PB&J sandwiches and coffee with a lot of milk. 

I was wondering if there's any other foods I could potentially look into trying to add to my diet to ensure I'm remaining healthy while not making myself actively sick by consuming foods I can't stomach.

That seems to be something that should stay clean, and when reading the manual I noticed this:

Possibly the previous owner did that? I don't see an easy way to clean that without disassemblying it and manual also doesn't mention it.

# THE THIRTY-SEVENTH PATH: CONTAINMENT BREACH

*For 350 years, aliens have abducted and returned one man: Alexander Doe. On his thirty-seventh departure, everything changes—forty soldiers vanish with him, setting off parallel crises among the stars and on Earth. This is the story of humanity's last abduction, and its first salvation.*

*---*

# Chapter 4: The Mars AI Remembers Everything

***Previously:*** *Alexander raced toward the stars while on Earth, Director Ferth investigated the extraction site and a terrorist attack on Kilimanjaro Terminus. The Church of the Patient Martyr enacted secret plans, severing the elevator and stealing alien technology. Now, Ferth must trace a conspiracy that reaches back 350 years to Mars.*  
  
\---

# Interior. Earth Intelligence Service - Level Delta 6 - Day.

*The mind is a cage of locks you forged yourself. Why would you not be the smith of its key?*

*—Piscean Maxim of the Mind Node (translated)*



Director Ferth sank into his chair. “So, we start with Mars. Every colonist. Every visitor. Every package sent from Mars to Earth. Pull up the archives of those ancient AIs. Warehouse inventories. Everything. Somewhere in that centuries-old datamess is the trail we need to find.”

“What about the transport guards?”

“Send them to the Earth Laboratory and Sciences Division. Tell them that the nanobots are the payment device, and that we need them to wake our people up,” he said.

Ferth had thought himself clever, able to outmaneuver the various Alexander Doe religions and conspiracy factions. But he had always known that the real test would come from those able to lay their plans before he noticed. And now he discovered that some organization had done exactly that—they had reached through his blind spot, taken advantage of his trust in the chain of his predecessors. They had reached all the way back three hundred years, to Mars itself. Used a weakness no one knew they needed to guard against—the razor edge between returnee kook and actual first contact abductee.

But there was no time to process the current revelations, because the overheated briefing room, which smelled of sweat, held a microcosm of Earth’s various Alexander Doe factions and religions and theory holders. Too many eyes. Too many judgments seeking his weaknesses. Too many coffee cups clustered before each seat—some empty and tipped over, some forgotten. The thermal carafes of coffee were probably already empty, but none of the assistants dared leave to get fresh coffee.

And his tumbler had been empty since he stepped into the Alexander Doe Preserve.

Despite his request for a small team, he had gotten Specimen theorists, Weapon theorists. Those with degrees in Comparative Religion with their pet theories on the proper translations of the Doe Maxims. Each individual seated about the table was convinced that they alone understood the truth about whether the man was angel, prophet, spy, or saboteur.

That included the four uplifted members here. Them, he had yet to figure them out. What did they believe about their accidental creator—the man whose second return had brought along the technology that made genetic uplifting possible? Gratitude? Resentment? Religious fervor of a different flavor? Perhaps enough time had passed for them to fully integrate into human beliefs? Given human history, Ferth doubted it.

But he had stopped trying to find objective people decades ago. Living in a world with an undeniable alien abductee had warped and skewed everyone’s thought processes. There were no objective observers left—not after three hundred fifty years of Alexander Doe being the most important person on Earth, part idol, part icon, part golden calf, part golden goose. Being part and parcel of humanity’s most important question: are we alone? No. But the aliens are interested in only one of us.

Until today.

But Ferth’s job wasn’t to manage a room full of conflicting beliefs. No. His job was to extract what facts he could before the briefing room descended into “academic” warfare.

“The AI logs for Arc-6 are being compiled,” his assistant, a steady woman just entering her second century of life, said.

He nodded.

No. He had run versions of this interrogation in his mind for twenty-five years. Every time Alexander Doe had ascended, and, in imagination, he finally had aliens across the table. Aliens who might know something.

Today, he had two. And they seemed just as lost as the Earth Intelligence Services. How much truth? How much theatrics? 

«Arc-6 online. Please note that my last log entry and the current date are out of synch. Do you want me to synchronize myself?» the synthesized voice filled the briefing room with a baritone while one of the monitors held the image of a bare-chested warrior with rippling abs wearing a Spartan helm and blood red cape.

Today it felt as if everyone was mocking him. A quarter century of chasing Alexander Doe’s shadow across bureaucratic layers and classified files. Of watching cults rise and fall in the man’s wake. Of protecting Earth from itself every time aliens casually reshaped humanity’s future.

Today, everyone was saying that he wasn’t enough.

“No,” Ferth said. “We need to access your information on Doe, Alexander, and his arrival on Mars.”

«Accepted. Preparing datasets… Backgrounding task. Do you want a full report or to interrogate the raw data?»

Someone tapped the table with their empty coffee cup—a sign of impatience?

*Ask the questions you know the answers to. Interrogate for the holes. For the lies. For the deceptions*. “Raw data. How many humans were on Mars before him?”

«None. The next humans from Earth would take another eighteen months to arrive. Because he was the first, all subsequent claims to Mars and its resources must acknowledge his standing as the first.»

“Mars was declared…” *Patience. A good interrogator never rushes the interviewee. Let them make the first mistake*.

«Affirmative. The space treaty applied to Mars only until various entities decided to lay claim. By their rules of engagement, Alexander Doe is the sole owner of Mars. All facilities and resource extractions are based on 99-year leases paid to Alexander Doe.»

The Specimen Theorist’s fingers stopped mid-swipe on their tablet.

Across the table, someone from the Protective Custody faction sat back with a nod and a grin.

Resource compensation. Some saw payment for a valued asset. Others saw maintenance fees for a lab animal.

*Everyone is too on edge. Too eager to be proven right. They missed the important detail: all the Mars AIs consider themselves to be the property of Alexander Doe. This will color their responses*.

Ferth shook his head. There was no point in arguing that the courts had invalidated all claims as treaty violations, because that was decades after the AI was archived. Its views would not be swayed now. “How did he arrive?”

«Orbital satellites captured images of this ship arriving.»

The image of a cylindrical ship appeared on the monitor, replacing the avatar of Arc-6.

“Does anyone know which aliens that ship belongs to?”

The various people and their assistants flipped through their tablets but shook their heads.

Director Ferth glared at the pair of silent individuals at the far end of the table. “Unless you are willing to share something.”

The individuals were his first alien participants: a pair of Geminean, who went by Luclaus—the two were the same height and build, the same clothes and hood and gloves, and the same featureless mirror masks. In unison, they looked up from their tablet. Bipedal. Could walk down any street and only get comments on the mask. “Perhaps,” the one on the left said. They both made the same interface gesture, and a hologram of Mars appeared over the table with the ship in orbit. But only the left one spoke. “That depends upon your purpose in investigating Mars,”

Ferth leaned forward and placed his elbows on the table. “My experience tells me that one’s past provides a window into one’s present.”

“Ah,” The left one said, even though both Geminean nodded in unison. “Yes, if you knew who his patron was, that would bring great illumination to bear.” Often, there was a slight mechanical inhalation sound before the words came, and this time, the inhalation sound continued a fraction of a second after. “Unfortunately, this ship was stolen. The original shipyards will not provide you with any insight.” Together, they made a gesture, and the hologram zoomed in on the ship, which moved in such a way that everyone could see that it was a hollow tube.

*So, either we know something you don’t, or you just lied*. “And do you know who this patron is?”

The Geminean looked to each other, then returned to looking at Ferth. “No. We have tried to trace your Alexander Doe’s movements through the past and have failed. You have a phrase.” The mechanical inhalation came with a slight squeak. “He gave us the ‘slip’.” There was an odd emphasis on the last /p/ sound.

Dr. Haruki stood. “If even the Geminean don't know, this supports Specimen Preservation. He’s so classified that even Great Powers are left guessing—”

To be interrupted, “Or it supports that he's been operating independently—”

Who was also interrupted, “Or it proves memory alteration between—”

Ferth closed his eyes. Every. Single. Time. Twenty-five years of managing Alexander Doe’s gravitational pull on human sanity, and he had never found a way to keep the factions from treating every data point as gospel for their brand of religion. Doe was a Rorschach test with a heartbeat. “This is *not* a symposium. Sit. Down. Shut. Up.” After a moment of silence, he gestured to Luclaus, “Is that why you came to Earth?”

“Initially, no. Once we understood your development was being influenced by one of the ‘Great Powers’, we decided to investigate more thoroughly.”

*Again, advantage EIS or a lie*. “How many of these ‘Great Powers’ are there?”

“There is the Geminean and the patron of Alexander Doe, of course. Beyond that—” Luclaus looked at each other, nodded slightly, then returned to looking at Ferth but with a slight head tilt. “—I have probably said too much already.”

*Ah, they are shielding their knowledge. We might gather some grains of truth*. “We know some from his ramblings.”

“Yes…”

“Are they accurate?”

“Concerning the species among the stars?”

“Yes!” *They want to know how much we know before revealing anything*.

The inhalation was slightly longer, then both slowly shook their heads. “While time ‘flows’ differently in different gravity wells, it still ‘flows’. So, what once was is not assured currently.”

“But the species he’s listed.”

“Once existed and still do.” They looked to each other, then decided to remain silent.

*Will you deliberately mislead us?* “The Leoni, the slavers. They took him the first time. They took him this time. They are his patron.”

Luclaus shook their heads. “No. The Leoni are hunters. Cooperative hunters. If they were his patron, they would be uplifting Earth to be a better prey species.” They tilted their heads. “The Leoni have hunted all the other space-faring species at one time or another, but none of us satisfy them.” Luclaus looked at each other, again. “But… Your species had hunting parties with different individuals fulfilling different roles.”

“…Yes.”

“That might be an alternative purpose they would uplift you—to be their hunting ‘partners’. Perhaps….”

“Perhaps what?”

“Three hundred and fifty of your years ago, the Leoni had their most daring hunt. There were rumors of sightings of an unknown species among their number. A species used to flush out and confuse their quarry…”

A member of the Weapon faction smacked the table. “I knew it.”

Ferth silenced him with a glare and then turned back to Luclaus. “So it is possible that the Leoni are his patron?”

“No,” the Geminean on the right said. The left one continued, “The Leoni can be patient hunters, but they train their young from the moment they can wiggle along the ground. They would have dedicated themselves to training you from the moment that daring hunt concluded.”

*So, your lies are just to obscure the extent of your knowledge. I can work with that*. Ferth drummed his fingers on the table. “Do you know who stole the ship?”

“No.”

“But you know it was stolen?”

“Yes. The owner had the theft formally acknowledged and commissioned the Geminean shipyards to construct a replacement.”

“You don’t have false insurance claims?”

The Geminean looked at each other before, in unison, turning back to Ferth, and the left spoke. “We do. That was the reason the owner went through the…troubles…of having the theft formally acknowledged. Falsifying a formal acknowledgment is so rare that it is considered non-existent.”

“It only takes one to show that it can be done—”

They shook their head in unison, “No. There has never been a deliberately falsified formal acknowledgment. We have strayed from your question. There is no record of who was operating this vessel at this time.”

*That is likely the truth*. Ferth nodded and turned back to Arc-6. “Do you—”

«Know who operated the spaceship? No. They arrived, dropped off Alexander Doe, and departed.»

*Did the AI just lie to me?* “Dropped him off?”

«Yes. They pushed his hibernation pod out an airlock.»

Someone inhaled sharply.

Dr. Haruki’s ears flattened against her skull.

The Compassionate Imprisonment contingent exchanged looks.

Ferth knew the argument: early trauma, callous handling, the continuation of the mental break.

Arc-6’s image turned to a small object exiting the ship and falling from orbit toward the ground below.

*Are you protecting Alexander Doe?* “And what is that?” Ferth asked.

«It is a hibernation pod.»

He looked to the Geminean.

“Your AI is correct. May I get better data concerning the pod?”

“Why?” *The hibernation “gas” used on the guards came from this hibernation pod?*

The Geminean looked at each other for long seconds before they turned back to Director Ferth. “As stated, since our contact with your species, we have been concerned about who is uplifting your species through your Alexander Doe—his sponsor. The identity of the sponsor will determine if the Geminean can also aid you or not—politics and treaties.”

*And you didn’t catch why I asked for your confirmation?* “And you think that identifying the pod will tell you who this sponsor is?”

The inhalation sound lasted a bit longer than normal. “No. It is likely a Piscean hibernation pod for their servitors, and if they could use you to supplement their servitor population, there would be no need to uplift you. Though some physiological or genetic manipulation might be desired. Otherwise, if they decided to use you as a client species…” They nodded to each other. “…your uplift would be far faster—almost violent. They are not patient hunters.”

He paused as if considering the request. *Everyone is protecting something, and it’s not like I can ask where that pod went, and the AI is protecting its “owner” and won’t reveal the answer anyway*. “Arc-6, please present additional data on the hibernation pod.”

Information scrolled on Arc-6’s monitor, including dozens of additional images. «The Geminean are correct. The hibernation pod is of Piscean origin, but received several modifications.»

The Geminean made their gesture in unison, and the pod appeared on the table. “These modifications and tuning appear to be specifically tailored for the differences between servitor and human physiology. Modifications that would have required your Alexander Doe to have used this pod extensively for testing and tuning purposes. Potentially as long and as frequently as his physiology could withstand.”

«The Geminean are not wrong.»

The Geminean gave a slight bow in unison to Arc-6.

*And the Geminean are intimate with the physiological differences. It is possible that Alexander Doe told the AIs what those differences are*… Ferth looked to Dr. Tsegaye. “From a Specimen Preservation perspective, would extensive modifications suggest maintenance or enhancement?”

The uplifted gorilla’s massive hands stilled. “As it pleases the Director, maintenance assumes a minimum viable condition based on fitness expectations. This list of modifications suggests active optimization for maintaining the peak performance of Alexander Doe’s enhanced state.”

The Weapon theorist—Ferth had stopped learning their names—leaned forward. Vindicated.

Ferth managed to neither shake his head nor frown. *Given the damage the AIs were causing to each other’s human-habitual infrastructure…* “Arc-6, there are modifications listed which occurred after Alexander Doe arrived.”

«Affirmative. The habitation infrastructure was… “incomplete” …when A. Doe arrived. He made tuning suggestions each time he entered the pod to save on food, water, air, et al.»

The Geminean spoke in unison, “He made suggestions?” After a glance toward each other, the left Geminean continued speaking. “That would require your Alexander Doe to have extensive knowledge, gained only from intense schooling, on the design and operation of the hibernation pod.”

Cooperation.

Half the room heard “willing participant.”

The other half heard “successfully conditioned subject.”

“Conditioned or complicit?” someone muttered.

Ferth raised a finger.

The room subsided into a hostile silence.

“Arc-6, does that match your observations and interactions with Alexander Doe?”

A slightly longer than normal pause, then, «Yes.»

“Please show your thought process and expand upon that answer.”

«Unnecessary. The dataset requires an alternative sorting to provide opinions based on observations of A. Doe. The alternative sorting is still processing in the background. A. Doe was trained in pod operation and construction and maintenance by a few different alien species, including both the Piscean and the Leoni.»

The briefing room erupted. Every human standing, shouting.

“Three hundred years of systematic training—that’s weapon development—”

“That’s legitimate transmission of religious knowledge, validation of the Doe Maxims—”

“This proves extensive conditioning protocols, he’s a victim—”

“Multiple species suggest client cultivation, not specimen—”

“**Enough!**” Ferth stood.

The room went silent.

His hands were flat on the table, and his voice carried the weight of his years managing this circus. “You will submit your analyses. In writing. The information containment protocols are in effect. Are we clear?”

The room subsided. Quiet, but not peaceful. The people grabbed their tablets and typed their interpretations and moved toward the exits. Same data. Different conclusions. As always.

Ferth remained standing. “Luclaus, thank you for your cooperation. My office will coordinate any follow-up.” Formal dismissal. *Obviously, everyone here needs a reset before any more work can get done*.

The Geminean rose and bowed. Almost perfectly synchronized. Almost. The left one went through the door first.

«Thank you, Director, for awakening me during the thirty-seventh departure of A. Doe.» The monitor went black.

*How did it know that?*

Ferth stared at where Arc-6's avatar had been. Three hundred fifty years of questions.

Answers that only brewed more questions.

Even the archived AIs knew things they weren't supposed to.

Coffee first.

Then he'd work on extracting answers from people determined to keep secrets. The Logic Node said don't count stones—but counting stones was exactly how you estimated the mountain.

Her days began with a cup of cold coffee while checking her emails. Had any magazine accepted her articles? Had her papers been mentioned anywhere? Was anyone inviting her to a conference? But her inbox was always empty. She wasn’t even getting any ads.

Then she analyzed the previous day’s data. Endless numbers in columns. Her only companion, a name without a face on the other side of the screen. Asking about statistics, fissures, and sea levels.

Suddenly, he wrote:

“Do you remember those cinnamon muffins you used to like? At the café in Paris?”

“But there are no cafés here. No muffins. No Parises.”

*The city dripped rain and exhaust fumes, vomiting whatever rot it hid inside. Jack ran hunched, slipping fast between dumpsters, torn posters, and shuttered storefronts. The sirens behind him drew closer, and his soles echoed on the pavement like a clock counting down his borrowed time.*

Cold coffee. Again. Numbers. Again.

“That time you laughed at the dog that fell into the pool.”

“But there are no pools here. Nor any dogs.”

She is sitting at the table by the window with a warm cup of coffee beside her and a cinnamon muffin. She is writing. The door of the café suddenly swings open, and a man in uniform steps inside. He smiles at her and raises his hand, waving. She returns the smile.

“We got him!” he says. “The fingerprints match! How the hell did you know?”

She chuckles and points at her notebook.

“Well, because I know how they think. Their mistakes, their patterns, you know.”

“Huh. Imagine that. We should be hiring more writers in the department.”

The cup slipped from her hands, spilling coffee and shards across the floor. Exhausted, before the day had even begun, she ignored them and sat in front of the computer. Her inbox empty. Again. The calculations didn’t add up. The cursor blinked. Below her last message, a single word. “Seen”*.*

She jumped up and did what she had never dared to do before. She went outside. In the distance, beneath the moon, stood the last iceberg. The one she had only ever seen as numbers on a screen. She walked toward it and stepped inside. Then, like a veil, warmth wrapped her from head to toe. The smell of fresh coffee. Cinnamon. Smooth jazz. Warm, yellow light.

*The building — a carcass of concrete and steel — stood silent before him. He slipped inside and sat on the floor, clutching his knees to his chest, head between them. How the hell had Inspector Franz Francis found him?*

She is searching for him. Calls his name. Spins in circles. She is trying to get out but finds neither doors nor windows. Only endless gray walls.

The screen was full of data and numbers. But at the edge of her mind, a song, a melody she didn’t know, but she could almost remember.",1,1761336165.0,LibraryofBabel,0,1.0,False

Scaling ads used to feel easier, right?

You’d find a banger creative.
It would print money for weeks.
Then suddenly… now they die in 7 days, CPMs go up every month, and you’re stuck refreshing dashboards like your life depends on it.

But here’s what no one tells you
it’s not just your creatives.
It’s who you’re talking to.

There are 5 stages your audience moves through:

Unaware → Problem Aware → Solution Aware → Product Aware → Most Aware.

Think of it like dating.
You don’t propose on the first date.
You build interest → trust → connection → then commitment.

Let’s break it down.

1️⃣ Unaware

These are the people scrolling through their feeds with zero clue they even have a problem.
They’re not looking for your product.
They’re just… vibing.

So when your ad screams “BUY NOW,” they scroll right past it.

Here, your only job is to make them feel something.
A spark of curiosity. A little “wait, what?” moment.

Example - if you sell hydration supplements:
“You’re not tired. You’re dehydrated.”
Boom. You just planted a seed.

It’s not about selling. It’s about making them notice the problem exists.

2️⃣ Problem Aware

Now they’re starting to realize, “Something’s off — I’m not sleeping well.”
They’re tossing and turning, waking up tired, maybe blaming stress or too much screen time.
They know there’s a problem… they just don’t know how to fix it yet.

This stage isn’t about pushing your brand, it’s about showing them there’s hope.
That the problem they’re facing isn’t random, it’s solvable.

Example:
“You’re not lazy. Your body’s just running on broken sleep cycles and no amount of coffee can fix that.”

That kind of message doesn’t sell a product.
It sells awareness.

Because the moment someone realizes,
“Oh, wait… that’s me,”
you’ve already done 80% of the work.

Now they’re listening.

Use educational or story-style creatives here short videos, simple carousels, founder talking-to-camera stuff.
Something that says, “Hey, I’ve been there. Here’s what I learned.”

3️⃣ Solution Aware

Now they know what kind of fix exists they just don’t know you.

This is where you introduce your brand, but not in a desperate “pick me!” way.
Show what makes you different.
Simpler, faster, smarter, cooler whatever your real edge is.

Example:
“Most hydration powders taste chalky and artificial. Ours? Real fruit. Zero sugar.”

Now they’re comparing, and your job is to stand out clearly without shouting.

4️⃣ Product Aware

At this point, they’ve seen your ads. Maybe even clicked through.
They’re on the fence.

You win them here with proof.
Show real humans loving your stuff. Reviews, testimonials, unboxings, before-after moments.

Basically: “Look, people like you already trust us, and it works.”

No one wants to be first to try something new. They just want to feel safe buying.

5️⃣ Most Aware

These are your warmest people. Past customers, cart abandoners, followers who always like your stuff but haven’t bought yet.

You don’t need to convince them. You just need to nudge.

Personal, friendly reminders work best here.
“Back in stock.”
“Early access.”
“Your favorite scent just dropped in XL size.”

Talk to them like insiders, because they are.

Why All This Matters

If your ads keep dying fast, it’s not because “the algorithm hates you.”
It’s because all your content is yelling at people who aren’t ready to listen.

Most brands only talk to the Most Aware - the 10% who already want to buy.
But the real growth? It’s in the other 90%.
The ones who don’t even know you exist yet.

When you start matching your message to where people actually are…
Everything changes.

Your top-of-funnel doesn’t just get cheaper, it starts feeding the rest of your funnel naturally.
Your retargeting ads don’t feel like begging, they feel like reminders.
And suddenly… scaling doesn’t feel like fighting gravity anymore.

If I were you, I’d open your ad library tonight and ask yourself:
“Which stage is this ad talking to?”
If everything’s screaming “buy now,”
you just found your scale problem.

We’ll show you how to build the system that actually compounds.

I thought I was good, but on the way home I had to get my wife to stop somewhere because I had such an urgent need to urinate. I peed several times last night and drank a lot of water and a lot of coffee. I’m glad to say that there’s no more blood in my urine right now. I’m not really sore, but I’m still waiting for a bowel movement. That’s to be expected since I had to clear myself out before the biopsy. I’m taking a really mild stool softener to help out.

My experience and a couple questions for the veterans...,"My first post here too. I love hearing everyone's experience, but now that I have had something more significant than the usual bizarre ""click out"" dream I thought I would share.

I was laying on the couch. Nothing was happening for a long time time. Then bam my whole body vibrated intensely 3 times, maybe a second each, with about a second in between. I could feel it in my lips and teeth.  As if I was pole and someone wacked me with a hammer. Somewhere in the range of an A or B note. On the third one I literally slid off of the couch towards my right in between the couch and the coffee table. ""this is it"" I thought tried to move and my eyes opened and I was back on the couch.

  
I had listened to a different HemiSync meditation first. Then put on one of Tom Campbells Binaural beats. Resonant tuned, said a bastardized version of the affirmation, created my REBAL, and told different parts of my body to go to sleep. I tried out my bone conduction headphones this time, with earplugs, and a bandana draped across my eyes. 50 minutes in Tom told me to finish up what I was doing before the wake up call was turned on. Besides nodding out periodically nothing happened. I turned off the beats and continued to lay there for maybe 40 minutes trying to keep my mind clear while not sleeping. I heard myself snore of and on, so from what I assume I had perfected mind awake, body asleep. My nose got incredibly itchy, I did not scratch it. Then it happened. Then it was over.

  
I've only really gotten to advanced focus 10 in the tapes, but have been using different Hemisync meditations and binaural beats pretty frequently since August. I do a few unguided, beat less meditations throughout the week too. 

**Any tips for how to not accidentally get sucked back into my body?** My wife told me your body pulls you back in if your to close because of the magnetic field. But my attempt at trying to get out of the vicinity just ended the whole experience.

**Will this vibrating be my indication next time, or is it more random?** I knew something was about to happen, but maybe if I'm more prepared I won't waste it.

“You know,” I say as I turn my dagger over in my hands, looking out into the dark woods in front of me. “I’m starting to take this personally.” I wait, closing my eyes to get a better read on the energy around me. Something dark and demonic is lurking about, but they haven’t made their move yet.

“It’s not like I smell.” I pick up a strand of my wavy brown hair. “I showered and everything. My socks even match.” The clouds that were covering the moon roll away, bathing the earth in a pale silver light. I cast my eyes up, feeling the power of the full moon. “Come on, I just want to talk.” I stand, needing to stretch my legs. I’ve been sitting on the cold stone steps of this historical farmhouse for an hour, waiting to make a kill. Shadows move across the porch and my heart skips a beat. There’s more than one demon out here and I’m all by myself.

Hell yes.

A small smile plays across my lips. Closing my eyes, I inhale and pull in energy from all around me. I’ve been tracking this demon for weeks, following several cases of people going missing on hikes at this national park. With no signs of foul play, the police have come to the conclusion that the hikers continued their journey through the park, going to the lake where they fell in and got swept away by the undertow. The lake has been searched, of course, but it’s not like you can drag all of Lake Michigan for their bodies.

But me? I know better. There are no signs of foul play because every last part of the bodies has been consumed. More hikers will go missing if I don’t stop the demons. They’re at their full power under the light of the full moon, manifesting from non-corporeal beings into those with physical bodies, which might be bad news for me if I didn’t know that tonight was also the only night they could be destroyed.

For good.

Well, if I can get to the spell I have written down on a piece of paper and folded in my pocket in time because very specific words need to be spoken in order to send these guys into the earth for a final dirt nap. I hold the dagger up in one hand, reaching around with the other for the spell.

The air around me cools, and I know at least one is approaching. Dammit. So much for getting out the spell. Yeah, I know I should have memorized it, but Latin has always been difficult for me, and I was banking on being able to look at the paper and read instead of recall. I almost roll my eyes imagining Tabatha’s narrowing gaze as she crosses her arms in her tale-tell I told you so look.

I hurry down the rest of the stone steps and move around to the side of the house, keeping my eyes trained on the dark woods closest to me. One of the demons lurches forward with a roar, teeth bared and taloned hands outstretched. The other stays behind, and if I couldn’t sense the darkness surrounding it, I wouldn’t know it was there.

“Silly demon. You should know better than to trust a witch when she says she just wants to talk.”

It lunges for me and I dart out of the way, knowing there’s no way I can stop and get to the spell now. I can’t kill it…not yet. I hold up the dagger, blade glinting in the moonlight.

“Hit him hard and hit him deep. Strike the heart and make him weep,” I whisper and feel magic pulse through my hand and into the blade. Without a second thought, I spring up and turn, throwing the dagger into the night. It hits one of the demons, sinking into its chest and sizzling with red-hot magic.

The other demon who’s humanlike in appearance but is covered in coarse gray skin, hisses and jumps away, rounding on me with talons splayed in my direction. I pull the spell from my pocket and unfold the paper. Right as I look down at my messy letters scrawled across the page, something grabs my hair and yanks me back.

The paper falls from my hand, fluttering to the ground. I jerk my head back, head-butting whoever is behind me. A demon growls and lashes out from the pain, moving its hands from my hair to my waist. It pulls me close and something warm and wet drips along my neck.

“Sick,” I say, bringing my elbow back in a swift movement. I hit it hard in the ribs, twisting and breaking out of its hold. I don’t have time to grimace from the demon blood that is rolling down my skin. The demon without a dagger in its chest barrels forward. I jump out of the way, diving to the ground and rolling back onto my feet in a well-practiced move. The wind picks up, blowing the piece of paper with the spell written on it away from the house and into the woods.

“Son of a bitch,” I mutter and throw out my hand, sending a ball of magical energy at the demon. It staggers back, knocked to its ass by the force of my power. I use the small distraction to my advantage and turn toward the paper. The other demon pulls the dagger from its chest and hurls it at me.

I dive forward, narrowly avoiding being hit right in the boob with the dagger. It clips my shoulder, tearing open my flesh. I fall to the ground, grunting in pain. Muddy grass squishes beneath me, smearing across my already-ruined shirt. I push off the ground, grabbing the paper and springing back to my feet.

“Mater et luna voco,” I start to read, and the demons let out a shriek. They know what’s coming and I enjoy the hell out of this each and every time. “Redde unde exierunt,” I go on, voice growing louder. “Cinis cinerem. Pulvis sunt pariter!”

I yank a crystal from around my neck and throw it down at the demons’ feet right as I finish reciting the spell. It sparks, sending a wave of magic into the air, and incinerating the demons into nothing more than a pile of ash.

\*

“Morning,” Kristy says cheerfully, coming into the bookstore with two coffees in her hand. It’s an unspoken rule that the person who doesn’t open the store we own together stops by Curlew Café for coffee in the morning. She sets my black coffee on the counter and waves her hand at the blinds, making them magically roll up.

“What happened to your shoulder?” She comes around the counter and stashes her purse in the cabinet under the register.

I’m wearing an off-the-shoulder black sweater and leggings, and I didn’t even realize the cut was showing.

“Stupid warbler demon threw my own dagger at me. After I’d stabbed him with it.”

“Gross.” Kristy wrinkles her nose. “I hope you disinfected it.”

“I did, and I used up the rest of my healing balm this morning.”

“I’ll make you more.” She walks across the store, running her fingers over the spines of books and turns on the open sign.

“Thanks.”

“How was the hunt, though? Did you get them?”

“Don’t I always?” I grab my coffee and pop the lid off the paper to-go cup, letting it cool down.

“Don’t get cocky now,” Kristy teases, and it’s only funny because I’m not. I’ve spent years training, and most importantly, I know my limits.

“I’ll try my hardest not to,” I shoot back. “And really, these lower-level demons don’t put up much of a fight. I didn’t even have to summon my familiars for help.”

“That’s good.” Kristy shudders and flips the lock, opening up the store to the general public. Two customers come in by the time she gets back to the counter. Kristy and I met years ago, and while we both have magical powers, we’re quite different. Which is why we make such good friends.

Kristy is a pacifist. She likes making love potions, healing balms, and good luck charms. She spends her spare time gardening and watches nothing but HGTV. But cross her, hurt someone she loves, and the toy poodle turns into Cerberus.

“I’m going shopping later today,” she says, coming back behind the counter and pulling a notebook out of the drawer under the register so she can start making a list. “Shopping” is code for she’s traveling to another coven to purchase magical supplies. “Do you need anything?”

“Black salt and mandrake root,” I tell her quietly, eyeing the couple who went right to the romance section. We’re the only independent bookstore in the area, and after the last big chain retailer went out of business, things really picked up for us.

“What about vervain and garlic?”

“Yeah. Better safe than sorry, right?”

“That’s what I’m thinking. Though so far the vamps in town have been pretty polite.”

“It’s always the quiet ones who turn out to be cold-blooded killers.”

“Kind of like you,” she pokes, though it’s true. Killing demons is more of a public service I don’t get paid for, than murder, but it’s still killing.

Overall, the vampires have assimilated into the general population better than anyone expected once they revealed themselves to the world several years ago. But witches aren’t the general population. We have a bit of a jaded history and letting the world know vampires exist puts the rest of us magical folk at risk of being exposed. Which we don’t want. At all. Witches were persecuted once, and we don’t want to be in the public eye again.

With animal blood being sold by the bottle, vampires claim they have no reason to feed on humans anymore. And if they just happen to be craving the fresh blood of the living, they can pay top dollar for “privately and ethically harvested” human blood. The whole thing is still a hot debate, with some people saying it should be illegal to sell human blood like that when the Red Cross goes through shortages every year. Others say we should be able to do what we want with our blood, and if selling it to be filtered and poured into fancy black bottles is what some want to do, then we should let them.

“That’s all you need?” she asks, jotting down a few more things on her list.

“Yeah, I did an inventory a few days ago and I’m good. Though if you’re able to stop by the Redwood Mortuary, I could use some more Dead Man’s Blood. Preferably something fresh and not from anyone with heart disease.”

“I can stop by and see what they have. Want me to bring everything over tonight?”

“Nah, you can bring it in next time you see me.” Kristy lives downtown, within walking distance from the store, and I live on the outskirts of Thorne Hill in an old house I renovated myself.

The rest of the morning goes on like any other. I recommend my favorite indie author to a group of college-age girls, hook up an older couple with a romance series that’s sure to put the spark back into their love life, and find the perfect self-help book for a shy teenager who I’m pretty sure is skipping school right now, but hey—who am I to judge?

Kristy leaves when the lunchtime slump hits, and I sneak into the back room really fast to use the bathroom and grab my lunch. I turn on music, dancing in place as I open a Tupperware container of last night’s leftovers. I hold my hand over the spaghetti, using magic to heat it up. I sit on the chair behind the register, thinking I’ll get a minute or two at least before someone else comes in. But then the bell dings as the door opens.

I blink a few times and look up, eyes focusing on the dark-haired girl who just walked into the store. She looks around, wringing her hands, unsure of herself. It’s her first time here because, trust me, I’d know if this woman had set foot in my store before.

Because she’s my sister.

“Abby?” Her name rolls off my lips and I feel just as surprised as she looks. It’s been over a year since we’ve seen each other, and the moment she turns and looks right into my eyes, something tugs on my heart.

I miss her.

“Hey, Callista,” she breathes, eyes wide.

“Callie,” I correct and then feel bad. Maybe she forgot I don’t go by my full name anymore. “What…what are you doing here? I mean…it’s nice to see you. Wait, is something wrong?” I jump out of the chair behind the counter and smooth my hair back again. I slept on it wet and it dried all wavy. It’s pointless to try and tame it.

“I wanted to see you.” She moves into the store far enough to get out of the way of anyone else coming in but doesn’t take a step further. Clutching the strap of her Gucci purse, she looks around before turning her gaze on me. “Penny turns one soon. We’re having a party.”

“One year already,” I echo, feeling a pang in my heart. “That went by fast.”

“Tell me about it,” my sister says, still not moving into the store. She steals another glance around the place, not quite sure if the books are going to stay put or not.

“It’s a regular bookstore,” I assure her. “You’re safe.”

“I…I…I’m not…it’s…” She shakes her head, stumbling over her words. Clearing her throat, she reaches into her purse and pulls out a cream-colored envelope. “I’d love to have you at Penny’s party.”

I come around from behind the counter and take the invitation from her. I swallow hard, refusing to let myself feel.

“It’s at our house,” she goes on. “We’re updating our kitchen, so all the food is being catered and brought in from Luciano’s. You still like that place, right?”

“Yeah,” I say, though I haven’t been in years.

“Good, because there’s going to be a ton of food. And their famous red wine.” She meets my eyes and gives me a small smile.

“I do like wine,” I say, not agreeing or disagreeing to go to my only niece’s birthday party. “I thought your house was new. You’re doing a renovation already?”

“Oh, right. You don’t know. We, uh, we bought a place in Lincoln Park.”

“Really?” I say, not meaning to sound so surprised. “I thought that penthouse was your dream house and it was so close to the hospital you work at.”

Abby casts her eyes down and her cheeks grow red. “We just thought a change would be, uh, nice. For Penny. The new place is close to the lake and a park.”

She’s not telling the whole truth, but I’m not going to press. As long as she’s got a roof over her head and a safe place to sleep, I don’t care where she lives.

I look down at the invitation, not knowing what to say. She’s my older sister. I’ve known her my whole life. But this…this is awkward and suddenly I forget how normal people act. I turn my gaze back up, finding her looking around the store.

The bell chimes behind her and she moves forward, making sure she’s not in the way.

“This place is nice,” she says with a smile. “You always were a big reader.”

“Yeah. Books were my safe place.”

“I’d really like it if you came to the party.” Her eyes go to the cut on my shoulder. She inhales as she looks me over. “You look good, Callie.”

I wave my hand in the air. “You don’t have to lie, Abby. I had a late, rough night last night.”

“With a guy?” She offers a small smile.

“A few guys, actually.” I wiggle my eyebrows.

“Sounds fun.”

Is that a real smile I see on my sister’s face?

“It’s not what you think. I’m just ridding the world of evil.”

“Callie, I’m sorry for the things that happened before,” Abby starts and reaches for my hand. Her fingers sweep over my skin and my heart swells in my chest. I close my eyes and shove all the feelings aside.

“I know you are, and I don’t blame you.” I give her hand a squeeze. “It’s good to see you again.”

“You too. Maybe we can make this a semi-regular thing.”

“Maybe,” I say with a smile, but I’m lying through my teeth. There’s a reason I left home and never went back.

# Book 1 Chapter 2

I drum my fingers on the kitchen counter, staring at the invitation to my niece’s birthday party as if it’s a cursed object about ready to spring to life and attack me. In a way, I’d rather that be the case, because then I could attack back.

“I don’t know what to do.” I bite my lip and shift my gaze to a sleek black cat who’s standing patiently at my feet. Exhaling heavily, I grab the invitation and sink down onto the floor. Binx rubs his head against me and extends a paw, batting at the invitation.

“I know,” I say, agreeing with his thoughts. “I’ve worked this hard to move on and build my own life, and life has been pretty good.” I start to open the envelope and stop. “I’m pathetic, aren’t I? I’m just going to open it.”

Binx steps into my lap, purring. I open the invitation and let out a snort of laughter. “You’d think this was an invite to the Royal Wedding. I bet the food will be good at least.”

Binx steps into my lap and nuzzles his head against my face. “No, I don’t think you should go, though I’d love to take you.”

I read over the info once more and let it all sink in. I’d love to see my niece. I’ve never met her, and I feel all sorts of guilty over that. No one else in our family has powers, but if I do, there’s a chance this sweet little girl might too. And if she does, you bet your ass I’ll be there for her.

I pull out my phone and enter the return address on the envelope into a Google search and find the Zillow listing.

“Damn,” I whisper, seeing the price tag. The place is gorgeous, though I can see why Abby would want the kitchen renovated. I can handle the party. I’ll force Kristy to come with me as my date, and we’ll mingle near the buffet and avoid direct human contact. But seeing my father…I don’t know if I can handle that.

“I’ll just drive by it and see how I feel,” I tell Binx. “Baby steps, right? Because I know my sister and I need to RSVP sooner rather than later. She’ll be obsessing over it until she hears back from me.”

I stand and Binx weaves around my ankles, letting out a soft “meow.”

“Of course I’ll feed you first.” At the mention of food, two other cats appear in the kitchen. I open the fridge, taking out pieces of venison. It’s cooked rare, seasoned ever-so-slightly to appease each cat’s personal tastes.

“All right,” I tell them once their dishes are filled. “I’ll be back in a few hours.”

# Book 1 Chapter 3

The bartender hands me my drink. It’s pink, smells like cucumbers, and is being served in a dainty little wine glass. The drink had some sort of stupid, trying-too-hard-to-be-hip name, but it’s made with vodka and that’s all I care about.

I bring it to my lips and take a big sip, feeling instant relief when the alcohol slides down my throat. I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t face my family. I drove all the way up here, parked my Jeep on Abby’s street, and got out. I was going to walk by, get a read on the energy of the place.

But as I was crossing the street, my brother, Scott, came out of the house, talking and laughing with Abby’s husband, Phillip. And then I did something that hasn’t happened to me since my third year at Grim Gate Academy.

I panicked.

My heart dropped to the bottom of my chest and I spun around, walking as quickly as I could, not stopping until I stepped foot in this stupid, hipster bar. I’m going to have one drink, find something to eat, and then walk around the city, enjoying how easy it is to blend in until I’m good to drive home.

My mind slips and I get a flash of stark white walls, and pain prickles along the inside of my left arm from an infiltrated IV. I close my eyes, trying to force the memory away. I bring the drink to my lips again and suck it all down.

What the hell was I thinking?

I’m not going to that party. Yeah, I feel bad for my niece and even for Abby, but hell to the no. There’s no need to put myself in that situation.

“Excuse me,” a man says, sliding up onto the barstool next to me the moment it’s free. I turn, more than aware that my resting bitch face is on in full force right now.

“Uh, hi.”

The guy scoots his stool in a little and laughs. He’s decent looking, a little overweight, and has put way too much cologne on. “My buddies bet me fifty bucks that I’d be too scared to come up and talk to the most beautiful girl in the bar. So…should I buy you a drink with their money?”

I laugh. That line was so lame it might just work. On someone else, that is. Because this guy screams I watch horror movies with the lights on. There’s no way he could handle me.

“You know what?” I start. “I’ve had a rough night. So sure, but I don’t want to give you the wrong impression. I’m leaving alone tonight.”

He raises an eyebrow. “Maybe I can change your mind.” The words leave his mouth and then he realizes how forward he just was. A flush covers his cheeks and it’s more than a little cute. “Sorry you had a rough night.”",1,1761335871.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1of7q3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1of7q3s/thinking_about_quitting_my_job/,Thinking about quitting my job,"TL;DR i want to quit my job because i’m expected to work more than i was told.

so i started a new job as a barista in a popular UK chain, i was interviewed and told i would be working as a part time 25-30h (35h would be a stretch).

i got hired and started my job 4 days ago tomorrow i’ll be going for my 4th shift, i have no previous barista experience so the job is quite overwhelming and doesn’t feel like my thing but i do love learning.

today i woke up to my schedule for the next week being 37.5 hours all 5 shifts being till closing (2 of those days being opening-closing) and then one day break before another load of hours, which seems outrageous. I understand that they are understaffed but i feel like this load is inhumane for someone who’s just starting. 

my other concern is the fact that i haven’t received any formal/informal contract or any written document that i’m employed, i have fully provided them my details. The manager says he’s not responsible for contracts and i basically have to wait for an email from the HR but based on a law in Dublin where i’m based at, the maximum days they have to provide me atleast a basic contract is 5 days which is gonna be tomorrow and i still have nothing from them.

i can’t help but feel like i want to quit this job as the pressure is getting too much from the expectation of how many hours i should do. there’s no benefits from the job apart from free coffee, the pay is minimum wage, but knowing the job market today i’m terrified to leave this job, i have experience from previous jobs both have been longer term of 1.5 years. stepping down feels like an internal failure from my part but i feel like i’ve been misled.

i will try to talk to the manager about the hour load but i don’t want to appear as incapable, i just want to have a life outside of work as i just recently moved to Dublin and still have a lot of adjustments to do, which doesn’t seem plausible with the load now.

is this job already a big red flag based on what i said and i should consider not working there? i can’t help but feel misled about my workload and it’s nothing like i was told/expected.

I enjoy peaceful days with journaling, reading, getting lost in movies, gaming for fun, or just listening to music and reflecting on life.

Fantasy worlds are my comfort place—Harry Potter, classic fairytales, mythology, Romanian legends, anything magical or historical makes me happy. I also love random trivia, memes, cozy vibes, and slow mornings with coffee or tea.

What I’m Looking For:
I’d love to meet someone from Romania (or Romanian-speaking) who is friendly, patient, open-minded, and maybe a little introverted too. Just someone I can message with, learn the language from, and slowly build a natural friendship.
No pressure, no judgment—just genuine conversation, shared interests, cultural exchange, and maybe helping me not sound like Google Translate.

Things I Enjoy / Hobbies:
• Reading & journaling
• Fantasy movies and cozy movie nights
• Gaming casually (not a pro, just for fun)
• Walks, nature, sunsets
• Learning about history, folklore, and languages

I sigh, chuckling into my palm. “Why did I vote yes on this when the directors asked?” I mutter to myself, exhausted. The first hours of our day were spent figuring out who ate the bloody cashbooks and finding Timmy’s lost rabbit. Right now, I have to finish this report before the day’s end.

I tug my lips and look down at her. “You know, sweetheart? Since you died today, we’ll have to toast your body in a nice kiln and have all your friends cry when we pour you into a river. But you’re dead, so we might as well start.” I reach out my hands like the boogeyman, trying to catch her.

“AHH! NO, I’M ALIVE, DAD!” She jerks upright, wiping off the spilled tomato sauce, beetroot juice, and…it smells like…motor oil? “Hey, sweetie, what’s in that blood you got there? And where’s Timmy’s rabbit? We told them not to bring animals, and now I think one of the Kolmo kids ate him.”

“Oh, ‘Timmy Junior’ is off with Timmy on the high seas. We’ll see them again when they come back from the portal. Although the blood has some paint in it, which I found in the closet.”

Okay, so Timmy’s probably playing with paper boats with the rabbit—WAIT, PAINT! “Oh no, no, no. Darby Diana Nkosi. What did the paint say? Nineteen eighty, seventy…fifty?” The last time this skyscraper was painted, her grandma was a baby.

“Oh, it said nineteen six—” I tug her furred fingers suddenly, hurling her forward. “Whoa, Dad, why are we running? The paint thing only said leaded.”

“It’s fine, sweetie! Just gotta check if Jimpoes like lead, and whatever you do, don’t tell your mom!” She bobs her horns at me.

We dash down the crayon-littered hallways past other life-sapped employees with their kids. By a corner, we soon cross a clinic, and I get her on the white-sheeted bed. The nurse’s red cap turns around from her desk to see her. Her paws then freeze. “OMG!”

“She’s not hurt. I need to know if Jimpo bodies use sodium and other ion thingies like us. And who the hell yells ‘OMG’?” I almost facepalm, but the occasion is too serious.

Flustered, she pulls at her hair. “Oh, sorry…just, yeah, too much screen time.” On the desk, her phone’s on, flashing some stupid dance challenges I never get. “But if that’s the problem, and she doesn’t seem to have any complications, then why is she here?”

I utter one word: “Paint.”

After a short frown, her whiskers spike. “Oh!” She immediately turns back to the desk and clumsily pulls out a box of books. Almost dropping it on the birchwood surface, she searches through textbook after dusty textbook.

“Wait, you’re a nurse! You shouldn’t be skimming those!”

“Give me a break. I’m just a nurse! No one ever comes here, and there are only so many biologies I can memorize!” She fumbles some more, now matted in sweat. A piece of her hair gets into her mouth, and she spits it out, choking while avoiding my ire. Then, an old book falls out with haste, complete with a bovine diagram on the cover. Her paws quickly scan for their organic chemistry. After a while of anxiety, she answers, “Oh God, she’s fine. Their bodies mostly use copper and can excrete lead.” She reads the line with a paw.

I sigh in relief, though Darby’s face is cross because we wasted fifteen minutes on nothing. “Look, sweetie, I’ll get you an ice cream today, okay? Just don’t tell—”

“How about a pony instead? I mean, not to tell Mom…”

“A tabby—”

“Pony.”

“A Rottweiler.”

“Okay, and a sploof!”

“Now you’re pushing it.”

Taking the liberty of relaxing, the nurse lets herself snicker at us. She then picks up her phone again. “Can I ask, what’s a sploof?” she says, already doomscrolling.

“Why do I feel like a grandpa so suddenly? From what I can tell, a sploof’s a cross between a phone and hologram. Also something you shouldn’t give a twelve-year-old.” I give Darby a stern look. The nurse smirks and goes back to her phone.

“I’m telling Mo—”

“Fine! We’ll get the sploof. Now that this party’s over, I still have a few people to visit for the full quarter report. Thank God the paint was a gag.”

Marking the end of my mini panic attack, Darby nods yes. We leave the clinic soon enough. In the hallway, the many glass-paned windows show me a sight that almost makes me frown. The sun is still high. “We still have like five hours before knock-off at six. Great. The report will take an hour at most. Got any time killers, sweetie?”

She tugs my hand further down the hall. “We can always check on the other kids.”

“We sure can. In the meantime, I’ll check out my favors, and you have your fun. When I’m done, we’ll play for the rest of the day. Let’s move.”

Together, we go, and soon I see Ravnar sitting in his white shirt and tie. His scaled claws are furiously clacking at the keyboard while his serpentine face looks constipated. “Oh, hey, Jaccob! Come, quickly! Before they come back!” His eyes are glued to the screen, only noticing us through smell. But when he darts a stingy eye at Darby, he jumps.

Concerned, I approach, while Darby parts with my hand, telling me she’s going to the break room for doughnuts. “Darby’s fine, it’s fake. But geez, dude, what happened? You look…like a unicorn chewed and spat you out.” I point to all the glitter and lipstick stains on his shirt.

Insistently, he hands me the expense statements he’s been working on for the day. “Take it! I couldn’t get it done sooner because of my kids, man! Go now, before they come back from the break room!”

“Whoa, I’ll go, but I didn’t know you were a dad. So those Kolmo kids are yours? Well, how many do you have? This looks too big a mess for three…maybe four?”

“Ha…yes…four…teen daughters.” He whimpers.

“WHAT!”

“Yeah, I know…just.” He looks around to make sure no one else is here. “Yeah, Jaccob, I used to be…a donor. It kept me alive before the job. But now…a few of them wanted me to…babysit. Emphasis on a few.”

I remember a very specific TV set and bed he bought before the place hired him…that was twelve thousand credits. I always wondered where he got it from. Until now. “Ravnar…no.”

“Dammit, just save yourself! All those ‘sick days’ I was taking were paternity leaves. Go!” A small quake then makes his monitor tremble. “Too late, they’re coming!” Forcefully, Ravnar grabs me by the arm. Without enough time, he shoves me into the nearest cabinet, without shelves, that can fit.

“Ah, my knees, man!”

“You’ll thank me later!” He sticks the statements to me with a sticky note and closes it shut. In darkness, I can see through the keyhole. When my brown eyes peer outside, I already see them charging in like war elephants.

“ROARRR!” They cry, slithering in, holding jagged cardboard spears and armed to the teeth with glitter bombs. Ravnar stumbles back, scales shaking. In the middle of the formation, I see Darby sitting on a star-cutout stool, holding a massive box of doughnuts and a pink crown.

“Mr. Ravnar, is it? After my ascension during a brief food fight, which I won, the council and I have decided you must pay for your crimes. You denied my right-hand, Abigail, the right to lick the cake beater on her tenth birthday. So it is with the power embedded within me that I charge you with death by glitter!”

In the cramped space, I put a hand over my mouth. God, she doesn’t even know what ascension means, and everyone with her is covered in glaze. Probably used those doughnuts as a power chip. At least that’s my girl.

The crowd primes their bomb explosives with vinegar and baking soda. They aim straight at his cobra-like flaps. “No, kids, please! Abigail, I’m sorry—” An explosion of shiny pink bursts into his mouth. Choking, he falls to his knees and sees Abigail’s empty claws.

With a furious look in her eyes, she yells: “Charge!”

A new wave of explosions rocks his green scales. He extends an arm, trying to soften the blow. In turn, the front line lines up its spears and begins to impale him. The light from the window is blotted, turning into a haze of purple, like a massacre. On the ground, Ravnar’s body is pelted. Each hit ripples through his shirt like a shotgun shell.

From the corner, I feel my lungs hitching as the box shakes with my laughter. I’m not suffocating thanks to some cable holes. The kids are yelling loud enough not to hear me anyway. But Ravnar notices. Weakly turning his head to the keyhole, he shadow-parses with his forked tongue: “Fuck…you.”

A short while later, his scales are limp on the floor. The sun’s a bit lower from what I can make out by the window, and my leather shoes are before him, ‘mourning.’ “Thanks, bud. I’ll put you in the credits of the report.” I did put his body on softer couch pillows and draped a blanket over him.

Darby’s sitting on the counter, eating some doughnuts as the other girls left under her orders to stage a company-wide coup. “I knew you were in there, Dad. Only you laugh like that.”

“And only you could hear me with those sharp ears. Let’s pray neither of us gets fired if the coup fails, and thanks for diverting them with it.” I take off the statement from my shirt, ready to add it.

Before we go, Darby kneels by Ravnar. Pulling aside his claw, she slips in a chocolate doughnut. “Thanks for watching out for my dad,” she whispers into his ear.

Weakly opening an eye, he nods thanks. “No…problem. Spit in his coffee for me, please?” He takes a nibble. A very glitter-heavy nibble. “Geez…it’s even in my tail. Why are they as rough as their mothers?” He remains on the ground, hoping to catch a quick nap.

Soon enough, we leave and head back to my desk. I input all the information with a scanner, and now we have new targets. “Okay, kiddo, next person’s Balthazar, then Timmy’s dad, Alder.”

Darby nods, and we travel further through the office. Down the many halls, countless kids are ravaging the carpet and running amok. There are rainbows on the walls, sticky things I won’t name, and pained parents and non-parents trying to survive.

A crocodile-looking fellow looks my way, painted head to toe in blue paint. His children shredded his desktop and are currently gnawing on his claws. Meanwhile, Darby and I walk calmly. He facepalms. “Why can’t my kids be like his?” A tail then swipes his face. Baring his teeth, he shatters a pencil, cursing the fact he has only boys.

Turning the corner, we walk into a new office space. It’s large, one of the executives’. It has sprawling bookshelves stacked with encyclopedias and Aztec miniatures. By the leather office chair, I see the Himji female, her white wings tucked over her beak. “Oh…hey, Jaccob…” she says, her eye bags sagging.

“Balthazar, you have kids too?” I gesture to the clear crayon marks on her suit.

“Jaccob…I don’t want to talk about it. I thought David would take care of them today. I was so happy—no kids on a bring-your-kids-to-work day means no work. Except this morning, in slippers, I found all my hatchlings ready in the car. He was gone, left a note saying ‘extra shifts.’”

She stands to reveal her lower half: pink bunny slippers and a disheveled gown. “I barely had time to change. I’ll…hand you the report details for the total manufacturing costs for the company’s phone cases. I don’t have much time either.” She glances at Darby, her face growing even more exhausted.

“What is it, Miss Balthazar?” Darby asks.

“I only have boys. Diaper-slinging, Dutch-oven-choking, booger-eating boys. And the oldest is eleven. I have five.” She slowly walks up to me.

Again, I’m appalled. “Why does everyone have so many kids?” I know why, though—with only so many species being uplifted in recent decades, most haven’t exactly grasped ‘family planning’ yet.

“Jaccob, I used to be a village girl. That’s all I’ll say. Let’s keep it PG for your little girl. In the meantime, I’ll help you get the last document you need. Who’s next?” By the window, the sun’s lower—probably an hour before sunset.

I nod thanks. “It’s okay, let’s go. Where do you think your kids are?” We start walking out together.

“Not dead,” she responds, already shoveling through the hall with me.

“Hey, Dad, what’s this piece of the report for?” Darby asks. We quickly pass into the HR district; it’s as desolate as the rest, but a good chunk of the kids are sleeping on the floor, crashed from a sugar high in the break room.

“It’s the balance sheets this time, sweetie. We’ll be there…now.” As we take another corner—tiptoeing our way—we halt, finding a very dark hallway. All the windows are covered with green trash bags, and the place is crowded with our potted ferns. A humidifier hums in the corner.

Balthazar is taken aback, her feathers fluffing up. “Oh…the kids. Uh, Jaccob, remember that company culture seminar I took them to one time?”

“Yeah, how could I forget? They flew us to Mexico to see a few floating garden replicas. And also where you got the miniatures, right?”

“Great, the kids…took a lot of inspiration from that. They liked the Aztecs…a lot,” she says, nervously keeping her beak away from the passage.

Before I can ask if they’re hunting for blood rites, a sharp whistle cuts through our ears. We all cover our heads. I grunt. “What the hell? Is that a death whistle?” The leaves rustle in a breeze coming from nowhere but the AC in the back. Darby clutches my leg.

“Yes, it is. They love it. Go, I’ll create a diversion. If I don’t come back, tell David he’s not having dinner tonight.” She steps in first before I can stop her. Deciding to follow anyway, we crouch closer to the walls while she strides into the open.

In the middle, she calls out: “Kids, if you behave, you’ll get obsidian knives!”

“Wait, really?” a choir of small voices cries out, their stuffed-jaguar helmets peeking from the shadows. They don’t leave, but their eyes are incredulous. Meanwhile, crawling on our bellies, Darby and I manage to nearly reach the hall’s end arch, trudging through trash and leaves.

“When you’re twenty!” Balthazar finishes.

A sad “oh” cries back. Fed up, one kid raises a macuahuitl made of hardened black dye from the leather department. His eyes are sharp. “Then we shall bring offerings to the great death god, Mictlantecuhtli!”

Another death whistle shrieks, this time from their priest in robes and blue-green feathers. “So long as the blood flows!” Jesus Christ, barely two of these kids are eight, and they’re talking this well? (Okay, “so long as the blood flows” isn’t exactly Shakespeare.)

The other four then ambush her, pouncing with vines and clubs.

By the end, we crawl out, unscathed and undetected. Behind us, Balthazar stares back, her secretary bird-like features blinking one last goodbye. Without resistance, she falls, drowning in a sea of tiny claws tying her down. “See you Monday, Jaccob,” she says, her groggy voice carrying down the hallway. She doesn’t open her eyes.

I nod back sincerely. In the last stretch of glass, tinted orange by the now-setting sun, we see the CEO’s door. Darby, a bit confused, pulls my jeans. “Dad? I thought you were supposed to make this for the CEO. Why are we getting the spreadsheet thingy from them?”

“Oh, I guess that is kind of funny, but we’re not. Our spreadsheet accountant works in a separate room next to their office so the CEOs can make quick decisions.”

“Wait, plural?”

“Yeah, you’ll see when we get there.” I pull her hand forward, and we go to the door.

On our way, Darby notices something very…shiny on the floor. And now the air smells very sweet. “Uh, Dad? Maybe we should move a bit carefully?”

“Why, Darby?” I open the door absentmindedly. Then bright flashes of light stun me. I bring my arms up to my eyes, trying to get past the strobing white as Darby does the same. But she pushes forward. When it stops, we see all fourteen of the Kolmo kids again. And they seem to be…posing?

“Yay! Our queen has returned!”

They quickly reach out to her and hoist my daughter onto their shoulders, parading her. When I look over, I see the two female CEOs brazenly tapping away at their phones. With their long nails, they edit photos of themselves and the girls for social media. “This is gonna look great for PR!” the one in the black suit sings, already striking a pose with another Kolmo.

“Amazing! Who came up with this coup idea? Best way we could’ve spent a kids’ day. Look, stocks are up twelve percent!” The one with orange lipstick and a blue suit replies. They both lock eyes on me, realizing I’m here.

Parting from the crowd and their chants, Darby steps up first. “Oh…it was my dad. He and I decided to do some role-play with everyone else, and he also got that report of yours done. Well, almost done.” She gives me a light jab with her elbow.

Focusing, I pull out the document. “Yeah, we did plan this. J-just…some extra activities for this fine mess. Since you’re doing this…PR thing. We could…”

“Show you everything else? There’s a lot more that went down here than our glitter bombs,” Darby finishes for me, giving me a wink.

“Oh my God, that is wonderful! Can you show us the rest? And Jaccob—your name, right? I wasn’t expecting anyone to get anything done today. I mean, we’re single, but kids look like a lot. And here? But you proved us wrong, handled the chaos well, and still did your job. After this, can we speak with you?”

I fervently nod yes. Then, with a bit of flourish from the two, we leave the office. They say they’ll finish the statement for me, being no strangers to accounting. We revisit the hallway again. The girls get us through an artificial thicket. Coming through, everyone gasps, seeing a massive step pyramid erected from tables, coated in red.

At the top, the priest kid’s holding a ruler, looking down at Balthazar. “Cuix tlein in tlatlacelilia!” (Does this please you!) he cries, looking toward the setting sun, before driving the plastic into her. She coughs a bit. “Jonathan, make sure not to break it.”

I snicker, and the group does likewise.

“Cemelle nantli!” (Silence, Mom!) Some human kids on a platform below pour out a bucket of “blood,” flooding down their staircase. Everyone else around the base cheers.

“This is so beautiful! Just imagine the kids speaking actual Aztec!” The CEOs take pictures, some boys from the crowd smiling along with the bright flashes. After a lot of photos, we eventually head back to Ravnar’s place.

He’s still sleeping on the ground. The girls surround him, picking at his limp body while he groans, half-lidded: “Kids…I’m dead…like, you’re not supposed to do this…” He drifts back off, too tired to do anything.

The CEOs ask questions like, “How’s it being the first death of this revolution?” and “Does glitter taste like pink?” The kids laugh again, and the women get tons of views on their phones.

For the final stretch of this tour, I decide to take them to where this all started for me: the parking lot where I drove in this morning, because I’m tired. Outside the company building, we stand in the cool, late-afternoon breeze.

Taking the joke lightly, the CEOs hug me goodbye. “Take care, Jaccob. And as for another kids’ day—yeah, let’s never do this again. I can only imagine what criminal networks transpired from this,” the first says.

“Yeah, what were we thinking? At least it did well for the brand. Oh, Darby, make sure to ask your dad to bring waffles home on Monday. I don’t have any right now, so that’s my gift.”

“No problem, I might come myself!” She jokes. We climb into our beat-up four-by-four, and the ladies turn back. On the pavement, a good chunk of everyone’s clocking out. By a distant light pole, I see Ravnar saying goodbye to his daughters. There are like six different cars, each with a Kolmo couple resembling a daughter.

I see one really big fucker shaking his hand so hard, Ravnar falls to his knees—or lower tail, if you want to be technical. “Wow, Dad, he looks strong.”

“Yeah, he sure does. Let’s go.” Starting the car, I realize every dude over there is probably infertile. “Damn. What are the chances?”

“Of what, Dad?”

“Nothing, sweetie. Now let’s get that Rottweiler.” I drive out of the lot and head onto the nearest highway.

Some hours later, it’s dark out, and I finally pull into our driveway. Everything hurts, and honestly, sleeping with a bull is the only thing I’m looking forward to. We grab our stuff and head out. Darby’s holding a brown box filled with soft whimpers and howls.

Inside, there are two kittens and two puppies since I didn’t want to take chances. Along the way, she also got some new clothes. When we head inside, warm air rushes into every flap and fold of my uniform. I crash on the couch while Darby runs to her bedroom with her new sploof and pets.

“God,” I groan into a cushion. “Nilja, my love, please, I need you.” My words are more slurred than anything, but she responds.

“Yes, dear, I’m here. And I need you to tell me why Darby has a sploof?” Her arms are crossed in the hallway as she chews on a sandwich.

“What’s wrong if our baby can’t have nice things?” I stumble up, going out of my way to give her a deep hug. “Come on, Nilja. Are we eating dinner? You know my gut doesn’t like pizza.” My face sinks into her shoulder.

“I know…since you took her to work today—I want to make it up for this favor.” Her eyes nudge toward the bedroom door.

My heart pounds. I immediately straighten my posture, take off my tie, and together we enter the room. In bed, I see her in her evening gown, and right as I’m about to turn off the light, a loud yell erupts. “WHAT YOU NOOBY PIG? NO, FUCK YOU, KILL-LESS LOSER! YOU SHIT, YOUR MOM’S A—”

“Darby!” I interject, but it’s too late. Nilja looks at me blankly, her snout puffing steam.

“I guess all you deserve is a good night’s sleep then.” Without hesitation, she turns over to the other side of the bed and closes her eyes.

“No, please, I just…” Begrudgingly, I turn around too and flick off the light. “Fine. And Darby! You’re grounded for a month!”",3,1761335664.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it’s not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women

Please read my post on my profile it has extra information on it that I cant post on this one!


Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don’t mind where you are located don’t let the distance put you off 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it’s not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible.

As the title says, I'm looking for consistency. Someone I can see every other week to hang out with. I love playing video games, cooking, watching anime, watching movies, listening to true crime podcast, and audiobooks. I'm also dabbling into kink culture and know that I am a Dom.

I'm mixed race, kind of short, and have a dad bod. One of my goals is to lose some weight and be more healthy. I dream of having my own meadery and can talk your ear off about anything dealing with alcohol, even though I don't drink much. I'm 420 friendly too.

**Why This Pick?**

I like the Over here for one simple reason, and it’s that I expect both squads to put at least 3 goals on the board. With the Sabres having scored 17 goals over their last 4 games and being surprisingly decent on a Power Play, I wouldn’t be surprised if they managed to pull off an upset at home. On the other side, Toronto goalie Anthony Stolarz has lost 4 of his last 6 starts; I don’t think Buffalo will have an issue keeping up with their offense today. Take the Over to hit.

Halloween is upon us and there is one thing we are all missing!  
It's a specially designed coaster set with a coffee art stencil and a trick or treat flip coin, of course!

The coaster set is designed as a carved pumpkin with a mischievous grin! Inside, are 6 coasters. Each with it's own unique expression, numbered for easy and orderly placement inside the holder.

The 1st coaster is designed to sit right behind the holder face to give it's features their color and glow (if glow in the dark filament is used).

The coffee art stencil will give your pumpkin spice a personality befitting the holiday!

A flip coin is also included for those special moment when you just can't decide if to trick or treat! And how convenient, it can just hang inside the pumpkin holder, when not in use!

Not only is this set useful in various ways, it is also an aesthetic addition to your coffee table in this festive time!

I have met a Saudi boy, similar age to me we are 23/24. He is currently studying in the UK. We met over the internet whilst studying. Everything between us has gone super fast, we met the first time and he gifted me things from his country and carried them all the way from his house he lives 1 hour away from me. I was stunned by how he carried them all that long, we walked and drank coffee. We began to get closer. (Prior to this we had amazing chemistry in terms of communication). He suddenly had an urge to squeeze and hug me and he did and I stopped him and said please remember my rules I set, one of them was to not touch or look at me for too long. Later towards the end of the meeting, he began to look for a place to rest (hotel) and thank god he didn't find anything as I was little anxious, but in the hotel lobby we began kissing. 

Soon we decided to separate after this meeting and blocked and deleted each other. And then we met again and this time he visited me again and he stayed the night in my area and we entered the room and things were really intense between us, we did not commit haram, as we both promised to not! 

What should I do in this case? We know marriage is impossible since I am a foreigner and we are too young.

هلا والله، أبي أتكلم بصراحة وأتمنى محد يهاجمني أو يزعل مني.  
أنا تعرفت على ولد سعودي، عمره قريب من عمري (٢٣/٢٤)، يدرس الحين في بريطانيا. تعرفنا عن طريق النت وإحنا ندرس، وكل شي بينا صار بسرعة. أول مرة التقينا، جاب لي هدايا من بلده وحملها كل الطريق من بيته، بيته يبعد تقريبًا ساعة عني. بصراحة انصدمت من اهتمامه، مشينا وشربنا قهوة مع بعض وكان التواصل بينا جدًا جميل.

بس وقتها حاول يحضني ويقرب مني، وأنا وقفته وقلت له يتذكر القواعد اللي حطيتها من أول، إنّي ما أبغى لمس أو نظرات طويلة. آخر اللقاء بدأ يدور على فندق يرتاح فيه، بس الحمد لله ما حصل، لأنّي كنت متوترة شوي. بس باللوبي صار بينا تقبيل.

\----------------------------

The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the First Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose in the Jura Mountains. The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning.



6:30am 



Dr. Alex Rommell stared at his clock as it blared, hoping the sound of the alarm would distract him from the growing pit in his stomach. *Alright, let’s get this over with. Today’s experiment will go exactly as planned. My lab will get the funding it needs to stay open and my name will forever be immortalized with a Nobel prize.* He pulled the covers off of himself, the cold air giving him a slight jolt, and got ready. 



The early morning quiet, usually a welcome presence on Alex’s walk to the Large Hadron Collider, seemed to only make his nerves that much louder today. His mind wandered as he ran through his experiment protocol in his head for the umpteenth time. Suddenly, he found himself walking into this computer lab where he was greeted by Michelle, Robert, and Sam, his three research fellows. 



“Good morning, Alex,” they said almost in unison. 

   
“The collider is all set up and ready to go. Your computer is set up for you at your desk. Let me know when you’re ready to start,” said Michelle. “It’s okay to be nervous…I know a lot is riding on today, but your math is sound. We’ll find what we’re looking for today, I feel it.” 



Alex turned to her and mustered up a small smile. “Thank you, Michelle. Do we have a pot of coffee made?”



“Sorry, boss. We ran out over the weekend. I tried to get more but our lab account is overdrawn,” Sam said across the room.



“If Sam stuck to our one-cup rule, we wouldn’t be in this situation,” jested Robert. Sam threw a paper ball at Robert. 



“Alrighty then. We’re running on empty cups and empty banks today,” muttered Alex. “Well, no point in delaying anymore then. When will proton concentration peak today?”



“Proton peak begins in 15 minutes,” answered Robert.



Alex sat down at his computer as Michelle announced the collider was on. As the collider began to run, the computer began plotting the energy level of each proton collision. Alex and his team theorized that while a collision between two protons released measurable energy, a collision between three or more protons at once could release enough energy to be harnessed. The problem was that getting three protons to collide was a near statistically impossibility. His idea generated quite a bit of buzz and funding at the beginning, but the continued failure of his experiment to be able to actually capture such an event landed him in the money-less predicament he now found himself in.



But today was different. The current solar particle event was peaking today and an abnormally high number of protons were raining down on Earth from the Sun. Today was their best chance to collide three or more protons together and change the future of energy. 



“We have entered proton peak. All detectors are on and running as expected,” said Sam.



Alex focused on the plotted points in front of him. He wasn’t sure what he was looking for in the data yet, but he would know when he saw it. Plot point after plot point landed at the level where they always hit. Alex’s eyes stayed focused on the screen, the rest of the world melting away. His breathing settled into even breaths and his mind was emptied except for the points in front of him. His fellow’s voices faded into the background of his mind as he singled in on the computer in front of him. Even his nerves seemed to dull in the throes of his intense focus. 



And then he saw it. 



The energy level of the last collision jumped. And the next one jumped even higher than that. Alex saw a third point plot even higher. In the corner of his mind’s focus, he became aware of the presence of an energy that was not there before. In this intense focus, it almost felt far away but he couldn’t stop himself reaching out for it. *Saidin* threatened to overwhelm him. He shot up from his chair gasping, life filling him. He wrestled with this energy, trying to keep himself from being swept away in its torrent but unwilling to let go from the sweetness it brought. He looked at Michelle and could see the sweat beading on her forehead. Robert’s typing suddenly seemed so loud. He could smell Sam’s deodorant from across the room. Everything was brighter and crisper.



“Alex, are you okay?” Michelle asked. She hesitantly took a step toward him. 



Alex felt like he was about to burst. This torrent of sweet, sweet life was starting to tetter on pain and it had to go somewhere. He pushed it forward and out of him in his mind. Just out of the corner of his eyes, he saw threads of red, blue, white, yellow, and green come together in front him. *What is happening? I…I can’t stop.* The threads formed into a complex configuration in front of him. Blinding white light burst from the weaved pattern and then Alex went dark.  



—--



Alex awoke dazed and confused. He was in a hospital bed, the machines around him beeping softly. He pulled himself up on the bed and let out a deep sigh. Lord he was tired. What happened? He looked down at himself but didn’t find any injuries. He didn’t feel any pain at all. Alex thought back to what he remembered last. The collider was on…he was watching his computer. The energy spikes. They had done it! Oh my god. And then what happened after…The explosion! His fellows! Where are they?



As he was about to press the call button, a suited man walked in. He flashed his badge at Alex. FBI. What was he doing in Switzerland? 



“We’re glad to see you’re awake, Doctor. I”ve been waiting for you to wake up for a week,” said the man who identified himself as Eli. 



“A week? What happened? Where are my fellows?” asked Alex. 



“I’m very sorry, but there was an incident. A week ago, an explosion occurred in your lab and destroyed part of the Haldron collider. You were the only survivor in your lab and you were found completely unscathed,” Eli said somberly. 

  
A lump appeared in Alex’s throat. Breathing became hard and tears came to the surface. “How did this happen? What’s going on?”



“That’s what we’re hoping you could tell us. There’s more. After the explosion, reports appeared all over the world of people suddenly able to do impossible things. The world has shifted, changed, and we think it started with your lab. Tell me what happened.”

I'm at a point in life where I'd (28M) like to seek new social groups to be a part of, but like many people in my position my main interests are kind of insular, and I've never been keen on the bar scenes. I've been a regular in the local MeetUp scene for a couple years now and found some great groups to be a part of, but I'd like to seek out others that have similar interests to me.

I'm super into retro gaming and crafting (be it sewing, woodworking, metalworking, console modification, cosplay, and baking), riding electric longboards, and exploring hiking trails and local cities. I like trying out new coffee shops, and while I'm way out of practice I like playing sports.

I've heard the Makerspace is a great place to meet craftier, hands-on people, and IIRC Game Together, Up-Down, and the Garcade are cool places to try meeting other gamers. There's plenty of local hiking groups but they're outside of my schedule, and I could hit up the YMCA for sports (at least, I think they host sports there). Outside of that, does anyone have other ideas for where I could meet people within my pool of interests?",1,1761334671.0,milwaukee,1,0.67,False

“He needs to die!”, Sue demands. 

My heart leaps at the way she’s talking to Art. 

Abe and myself are sweating bullets. This was supposed to be a status update, maybe getting a couple of his people to watch our backs. 

“By all means, have at it. The salesman has passed the point of being more trouble than he’s worth. 

I don’t see any of you moving.”, Art says venomously. 

“He killed…”, Sue begins. 

“I know who he killed. And that’s where the problem rests it’s head. 

If he’d turned one of you into a series of stains, his contract would be broken, and I could take care of him myself. But no where in my fine print does it say anything about, associates of those in my employ.”, Art interrupts. 

“Associates? You son of a…”, It takes both Abe and myself to hold Sue back from taking a swing at something that was standing by the switch when god said “Let there be light.”.

“We discussed the dangers, we discussed how involved I can and cannot be. Why are you three wasting my time with emotions I neither have nor want?”, Art says. 

Abe takes a large breath before speaking, “You’ve got a real way with people, you know that Boychuk? 

This was a message, and it wasn’t just to us. This salesman, he’s telling you he’s willing to think outside of the box. 

We’re here to give you the information we have, and hope you can make some sense of it. 

That’s if your done taunting my grieving friend.”

Arthur seems to mull the information over. Abe somehow remains calm as he relates it. 

“A man twisted by the search for otherworldly objects. Doesn't exactly make him the most original, does it?

I’ve never heard of objects like the ones you mention, but I know someone who may.”, Art offers. 

“We’ve got our own guys for that, none of them can find bupkis.”, Abe says dismissively.

“As I’d assume mine would. But I don’t think we need someone versed in esoterica. We need a Junk Dealer.”, Art says.





Believe it or not, the vast majority of the paranormal goes under the radar of people like myself. It’s not even worth writing a report unless something is doing a lot of bad to a lot of people. 

It's why local urban legends tend to last so long. A few missing teenagers a year isn’t worth the gas to check out. 

It’s also why so many peddlers of less than natural items, more or less get left alone. 

As we enter the dust covered, rust and mildew smelling store, Abe begins to count.  

While I’ll never be able to afford any of my own, on more than one occasion management has seen fit to outfit us with some kit that’s been given a kick in the pants by our lab boys. 

The assorted crap on the shelves here, wasn’t nearly in that league. Hell, it’s barely playing the same game. 

Cookie tins, half melted candles, stuffed animals, you name it, it’s sitting on a shelf here, half destroyed and with an almost imperceptible hint of the void about it. 

What I’m getting at, is this joint didn’t inspire confidence. I can’t see whoever owns it knowing anything our boys, or Art’s don’t. 

From somewhere within a backroom that I’m assuming looks alike a hoarder’s paradise, comes the proprietor of the establishment. 

He’s short, with a mop of grey hair that looks like it hasn’t even heard of a comb in a couple of decades. His skin is stained with grease and dust, small eyes hide behind coke-bottle glasses. 

He wears a brown vest festooned with the tools of his trade. Tiny screwdrivers, tubes of lubricant, and other bits and pieces make him look like some kind of shaman devoted to knick-knacks. 

“Coriander Shanksford. But you all call me Cory. Judging by the…look of you three I don’t think you stumbled in here antiquing.

How can I help?”, Cory says jovially. You can tell the man loves his work. 

“104. Ten meters bigger than the building. Not including your backroom. Impressive.”, Abe says catching up with us. 

“Good eye, or rather, foot.”, Cory replies. 

“Name’s Abe. I’m guessing you know where my friends and I are from. 

We need someone who knows a lot about things not many people care about…”, Abe explains our situation, omitting a few points of information.

“You fellas need to tell your management to reach out to folks like myself. Those loonies that go searching for Dracula’s candelabra , or Satan’s bidet , not one of them isn’t hip deep in evil. But us junkmen , by and large aren’t.

We sell novelties to people who can afford them. Part of our code is not to deal in things that could cause problems. 

Which is why I remember the Dutchman.

For every winking doll or, talking radio, we get a dozen duds. 

Things we get that are surely supernatural, but no can figure out how. They tend to get traded from Junkman to Junkman, usually finding their way into a storeroom.

Your friend came in about a month back. I get all types in here, and I’ve never been a naturally judgemental fellow, but something about him rubbed me the wrong way. 

He wanted to buy a lot of about 200 duds. Assumed he was a Junkman at first, but nothing about him seemed right. 

Offered me four times what I’d have made selling them. I was about to take the offer, but then he had a special request. 

He wanted to go through the duds. He was looking for a few specific things. Wouldn’t tell me what though. Just wanted to find it, and leave the rest.

Great deal for me, but something didn’t sit right. As far as the void goes, there’s nothing cloak and dagger about what I do. No need for someone to want discretion. And with his offer, that’s what he’d be paying for. 

I told him no and that was that.”, Cory explains. 

“Any idea what he was looking for?”, I ask. 

Cory smiles, “I didn’t, not until a week ago anyway. 

Three kids in their twenties broke in. Didn’t take any money or my checkbook, so I knew they weren’t just junkies looking for a score. Didn’t take anything worth any value, so I knew they didn’t know what was going on. 

All they tried to take were the items the Dutchman wanted to sort through. Didn’t get them out the door of course, it’d take a lot more than 3 kids to rob this place. 

But this is the point where we talk about how valuable this information is to you.”, Cory says.

 It takes a few hours for us to kick a request for funds up the chain. No internet banking back then. But by the wee hours of the morning, a tired looking parcel delivery man drops off a sizable check written to Cash. 

I’ll admit when I’m wrong. Cory’s back room was organized in a way that was both clear and obsessive. 

Abe looks like a kid in a candy shop. Sue and I can tell there’s a lot of stuff of worth back here, but Abe is a lot more in tune to that kind of thing. 

“Look at what your sitting on here Cory! The hell are you doing selling backwards running hourglasses to starched collars with a spooky fetish?”, Abe asks. 

Cory smiles. 

“You think you’re the only folks who care about what happens to the world?

Might not have the zip that going toe to toe with a vampire does, but we do what we can to keep nasty things out of willing hands. 

My day job is selling novelties. The rest of the time, I do this.”, Cory says proudly. 

“Pleasant surprise. I was half expecting to see a torture room or something back here. No offense.”, I reply. 

I’m going to do everyone a big favor and not give you the minutes on the 4 days it took us to go through the assorted duds. It was a boring slog, a lot more like spring cleaning than delving into the supernatural. 

We got to know a lot about Cory, and people like him. A few dozen phone calls had the eccentric little man calling in friends from across the state. 

In a world of death cults and insanity, these junkman seemed downright wholesome. Which made why the Salesman was interested in him all the stranger.

“How are you not smelling like liver and onions Cory?”, I ask. 

We’ve narrowed the search down to 20 objects we can’t positively identify. We’ve been catching cat naps, and drinking coffee by the quart. But we all have our limits, both mental and hygiene related. 

Cory tugs the collar of his off-white dress shirt, “Keep the best pieces for myself. This little beauty saves me a bundle on hot water and soap.”

Abe laughs, “This guy. Well, the rest of us need a shower. Let’s throw in a bit of sleep, and meet back here around 4?”

A diner burger and three hours of sleep on the cot in my office never sounded so enticing. 

The burger is dry and the dreams I have are strange. At least one of those things has to do with going unprotected on a couple hundred pieces of supernatural garbage. 

Regardless, the food and consecutive hours of sleep do wonders for my mood. 



“Cory, brought you a frankfurter sandwich!”, I yell, walking into the dusty shop. 

Silence greets me. 

I assume Cory is doing what the rest of us were and taking a  much deserved nap. I make my way to the backroom. 

Before I get there I step in something sticky. Being in my line of work, I assume the worst. 

But it’s just thickening coffee surrounded by pieces of a broken white mug. 

Still, something seems off. Cory doesn’t seem the type to leave a puddle of joe on the ground waiting to become an ant pool party. 

I draw my pistol, slowly clearing the corner to the backroom. 

I find Cory, gagged, bound to a chair, and looking like he went 10 rounds with Joe Fraser. 

I’ve opened my mouth to ask him who did this when the world starts to go black. I’m falling, a dull pain spreading from the base of my skull. 

I have enough time to realize I’ve been hit with a sap as I catch a glimpse of the salesman.


I wake to the sounds of screaming. My senses slowly start to come back to me, I smell gasoline and piss. 

“You fucked up, you know that right? That thing you do business with, basically second cousin to the devil.”, I slur, trying to buy myself some time. 

“That’s a matter of perspective.”, The salesman says with a giggle. 

He lays into Cory, he’s not just making a point, he wants to hurt him. 

I don’t need to say this, but I will, the sick bastard was enjoying himself. 

He paws through some of Cory’s tools on a desk, picking a long thin awl. He walks behind the old man, grinning at me as he raises the impromptu torture implement. 

“Easy! This doesn’t have to turn into a shitstorm.”, I say, not knowing exactly where I’m going to take this statement. 

“Oh?”, the Salesman begins, “What do you suggest?”

The salesman walks over to me. He looms, a manic grin on his face. I can’t read the bastard at all. 

“The slapjack to the back of my skull was your saving grace. I’m guessing whatever contract you signed forbid spilling blood, and demons love being literal.

I’m done with this, I’m done with whatever weird shit you’re into. I don’t care, I don’t want to know. 

You haven’t broken your contract, I haven’t signed one. It’s like we never met.”, I wish I was enough of a coward to be telling the truth, but at the very least I need to buy more time. 

“Genius!”, the Salesman screams, putting his face inches from mine, “My savior! Where would I be without someone like you?”

I don’t like the look in his eyes. 

“Or maybe, I don’t need to care about fairy tale contracts. Maybe your second cousin to nothing won’t have any idea what happened here until he sees it in the paper.”, The smell coming from the Salesman’s mouth as he speaks is rancid and alien. 

The salesman jams the awl into my leg, pinning me to the chair. He misses tendons, veins, bone and nerves. This lunatic really knows what he’s doing. 

I scream, Cory is crying, the entire situations is about as fubar as things can get. 

The salesman turns away, a small laugh overcoming him before he speaks. 

“Ghosts, vampires and demons. Doesn’t it all seem, vulgar to you?

How is the universe a mystery if everything has been written down, categorised, and put into neat little boxes?

There’s no fear in that, no power. Just a world ran on rules most people are too stupid to figure out. 

I’ve seen it, behind the veil. A beautiful esoteric chaos. 

And I will show it to the world. I will be it’s harbinger. To call it the truth would be an understatement on par with blasphemy!”

The salesman begins looking through the remaining duds. His grin spreads like a slit throat as he picks something up. 

“Do you know what this is?”, The salesman asks. He holds a thin small rectangle of plastic with two gears set in the middle. 

 I want to answer, but the pain in my leg is too much. It’s taking everything I have not to pass out. 

My lack of response angers the Salesman. 

“It plays sound, this one was found in a facility that was working on the technology for military use. 

You know what’s on it? Pop music.

Written off as an engineer having a bit of a laugh. 

Do you see the beauty? Do you see?

This isn’t from a different when, time isn’t a two way road. It’s not even from a different where. 

It’s from a different here. One of 9, do you see it Ashton?”

 “No, I don’t, because it’s not there! Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, man. You got a dose of something bad once upon a time. It’s got into your body and soul, and has you thinking nonsense. 

Anything you found, anything you’ve seen, I promise you, you can find by the dozen if you know where to look. There ain’t nothing new under the sun. I promise you.”, I plead. 

Cory is having trouble breathing. I pray Sue and Abe get here soon. 

“You promise me? Well that’s good enough. 

Why don’t we talk about it for a while, give your friends time to get here?”, The salesman says. 

I don’t know how to respond, he seems three steps ahead no matter how much of a nutjob he is. 

“Right now they are standing outside. They know something’s wrong.

Your friend Abraham, he will suggest the back door. He’ll find it, no matter how well hidden our scrap monger thinks it is.

Like you they will think I’m bound by that pretentious huckster. Which means they won’t be expecting that.”, The Salesman says, pointing to the door at the far end of Cory’s backroom. 

A thin, almost invisible tripwire, and a half dozen rusted pineapples from the war. The sit above the doorframe like perched doves. 

“I have a decision to make and I want you to help me. Do I let them walk in, and turn themselves into mist? Or, do I disable my party favor, and we all get to chat a little longer?

Tick Tock Ashton, they’re walking down the alley.”, The salesman’s offer twists my guts. 

“It’s not us you have to worry about, it’s Art.”, I say, trying to think of something. 

“Then better to work with me now, give your little god time, no?”, The Salesman says with a sneer. 

“Disarm the god-damn thing.”, I say, defeated, scared and out of options. 

The salesman does it, taking a spot behind me. I feel a small, sharp blade against my neck. In the seconds before Sue and Abe walk in I see the jerry cans around the junkshop. The pools of off clear liquid.

“I’ll be over there before you give him anything worse than razor burn.”, Sue growls.

“And before she does that I’ll have a bullet in your skull.”, Abe adds, weapon drawn. 

Cory coughs, wheezing, gasping for air. 

“Maybe, maybe not. But I can keep you three busy long enough for this eccentric little gnome to drown in his own blood. 

I don’t need to win, just stall. 

If it were me, I’d sacrifice a pawn to save my knight, but I have a feeling you don’t play that way.”, The Salesman digs the knife in drawing a thin stream of blood. 

“Your call Ashton.”, Abe says. 

“Put it down.”, I say. The words taste like shit. 

I watch the Salesman tie Abe and Sue. Evil genius, maybe, but he’s no boyscout. His knots are sloppy, more concerned with being uncomfortable than structurally sound. 

His back is turned, I’m making eye contact with Sue. She’s thinking the same thing. 

“The Cory is half-conscious clear his airway at least.”, Abe pleads. 

The salesman walks over, pulls out a white handkerchief and almost lovingly clears the blood from Cory’s nose. 

He turns to us, looking pleased with himself. 

“For what it’s worth, you three did manage to slow me down. I don’t think Arthur will want to continue our arrangement after this.

But, I never have all my eggs in one basket. The color was just one of my ways of bringing truth to the world.”, The Salesman preaches. 

“What is it like, where you’re from?”, Abe asks. He’s hoping to play to the Salesman’s ego. 

“I’m from here, sadly. But it’s not my home. 

Beings, they can’t travel from one corner to the next. They’re either obliterated, or approximated. 

Objects, they’re rare. More so because unlike other relics, they can be destroyed easily. But they’re quite real.

But we never thought about information. The power in a song, a film, even something as simple as a color. We never understood the blessings it held. 

The power.”, The Salesman answers, an almost religious fervor taking hold. 

 I hear it, a soft noise like ripping tissue. I can’t take the chance the Salesman does though. 

“So you’re going to take that piece of plastic and, what, play it on the radio?”, I say, a little too loudly. 

“No, once I find a way to play it, that is for me. I need to hear the voices again. They have so much to say.”, The salesman answers. 

For a brief second the volume of the tearing increases. I think the Salesman has to have heard it. 

He starts to turn toward sue, when Abe speaks up. 

“You’re real scary when someone’s tied up, you know that?

That’s what all this is right? Some power fantasy? You cosmic putz. You giant, flopping schmuck. 

You’re the punchline to a joke being told by some god or another and you’re too up your own ass to see it. 

Fucking kill me already. If the human race can produce a…”

Abe gets what he wanted, the Salesman snarls, throwing his gaze across Cory’s tables, a cruel grin on his face. 

In one smooth motion he grabs a mason jar full of assorted nuts and bolts. Can’t weigh anything less than five pounds. 

With a spin that shows more grace than I’d expect he throws the jar squarely into Abe’s face. 

What the impact doesn’t crush, the broken glass and pointed metal tears. 

Abe screams through torn lips. His nose is a shredded cavern, one ear hangs by a thin piece of flesh, the eye beside it pierced by a handful of glass shards and bolts. 

Sue was too late to save Abe’s face, but the shattering glass and rattling hardware covered the noise of the bursting rope well enough that she’s standing beside the salesman before he notices. 

She doesn’t quip, she doesn’t taunt, just levels a roundhouse blow to the back of the Salesman’s head that sends him ass over tea kettle over Abe. 

He's hurt, dazed, struggling to his feet. 

Sue drops her suit jacket, then tears off the dress shirt underneath. The tanktop below it is ripped away like a spiderweb. 

She stands there, in what you’d call a sports bra nowadays. But no one in that room was thinking about her gozangas, I'll tell you that. 

She stands, heaving with rage and pain. A beast from another time. 

Always been a few rumors floating around that Sue had a little more than human in her ancestry. Not as uncommon as you might think in our line of work. We have them all but confirmed as I notice a half dozen, almost imperceptible hooked barbs on her shoulder blades. 

“Square-up square-head. I’ll wait.”, she says stretching out a back full of shifting muscles. 

  She’s rung his bell, that’s for sure. He stumbles, unable to gain his balance. 

I’m almost out of my ropes. Not that I think sue can’t handle things, but backup is always appreciated. 

Sue picks up her pistol from a desk. 

“You want a gun? Make things fair?”, she says, lobbing the weapon at the salesman. 

He almost has his wits about him, takes him two tries but he catches the piece before it hits the floor. 

Cory mumbles something through torn lips, I can’t make it out. 

The salesman flips off the safety. 

*click*

“Now, what type of crazy asshole goes around with one in the chamber?”, Sue says with a grin. 

She slaps the pistol out of the Salesman’s hand before he can rack the slide. Before her next blow can land though, he’s moving. 

I can’t call it speed. He isn’t so much moving from one place to the next, as simply being there. It’s nauseating, like watching a film ran slightly out of synch. 

I can see the look of joy on his face, thinking his mojo has taken him out of harm’s way. 

Shit like that doesn’t fly with a woman who once put a poltergeist in a chokehold. 

The salesman fades, almost casually sue throws her left arm out. 

There is a gut churning, wet crack. The salesman stands next to Sue for a moment, neck at an obscene angle, head displaced my Sue’s fist. 

“P….Platter.”, Cory wheezes. 

The salesman hits the ground like the sack of shit he is, as Sue begins to untie the three of us.

 
 I’ve got Abe out of his bonds, Sue unties Cory.

“f…f…flower.”, Cory pants, blood pouring from his mouth. 

We assume brain trauma induced nonsense. I get one arm under Abe, Sue moves to pick up Cory in a fireman’s carry. 

Abe’s good eye widens, I know what’s happened before I turn us to see. 

Sue’s already looking at him, the look on her face is more annoyance than fear. 

I wish I had her confidence. 

There’s something different about the Salesman. A look of joy in his eyes, a sinewy wrongness to his movements. 

“Thank you Susan. Bravery has never been one of my virtues. 

I couldn’t work up the nerve to cross the threshold myself. What if I wasn’t ready? What if I was wrong? What if I never actually saw, or felt the nine?

But you, my beautiful lady, proved me right. 

I am the crack in the glass. The tip of the spear.”, The Salesman rants. 

Sue throws a punch. A wall cracking, monster slaying blow. 

There’s impact, but the Salesman barely notices. 

Sue charges him, but he squirms and slips out of her grasp like a snake. His body bending to impossible angles. 

He laughs maniacally, taunting Sue. 

Cory begins to breath erratically. Abe is doing his best to stay conscious. 

Sue’s no meathead, she ignores the Salesman finding the plastic rectangle on a workbench. 

She smashes it with a left-handed hammerblow, the plastic explodes, driving a good amount of it into her fist. 

“You Bitch!”, The Salesman screams. 

His moment of distraction is all Sue needs. 

She throws a series of brutal overhand rights. There’s a sense of hope for a moment, the salesman stumbles, falls, but keeps bouncing back.

He finds his footing, screaming, and goes on the attack. In a frenzy he grabs anything at hand, bludgeoning, stabbing and lacerating Sue. 

The situation is going south. Fast.

Sue starts to trade blows, her stance being broken, her strategy ruined. I don’t like the look of concern on her face. 

Then I see it. A left handed jab scratches the Salesman’s face. 

The Salesman backs off, touching the blood. 

“Do that another hundred times, I might need some stitches.”, He gloats. 

It hits me, pun intended. 

“The platter Sue!”, I scream. 

Abe goes limp, blood loss most likely, we don’t have much time. 

The salesman laughs.

It’s a cheap tin thing pretending to be sterling silver. Thin, light not the kind of implement that’s apt at doing harm. But Sue swings it like Excalibur itself. 

The pain and damage shocks the Salesman, he seems a bit slower on the uptake than we are. He stumbles to the side, clutching what seems to be some broken ribs. 

A second blow rings off the top of his skull. Grey blood flies, the platter bends.

Sue’s third strike, misses as the Salesman shifts away, he breaks into a run toward the front of the store. 

She’s on him, I lag behind, not willing to put Abe down. 

It feels the air is sucked out of my lungs, the front room bursts into flame, igniting the cans and pools in the backroom as well. 

I cough, ripping a piece of my shirt and tying it around Abe’s face. 

The salesman stands in the middle, grinning. Dazed and hunched over from Sue’s attack but unfazed by the flames, or toxic smoke building up. 

A grenade goes off, bits of shrapnel dig into me. 

“There’s a few more of those hiding around.

This little inferno is going to attract a lot of attention, especially when they notice the only things untouched are the Junkman’s trinkets. 

It's going to take your bosses and Art’s peons ages to sweep this under the rug. 

By that time, I’ll be long gone. And you’ll not hear from me again until it’s too late.”, He taunts. 

“Can’t fucking wait.”, Sue says as a beam comes crashing down with the sound of another explosion. 

If we left Cory and Abe, chances are we’d have caught up with him. But, he was right, we don’t play that game. 






“Holy shit.”, Leo says. 

“Christ.”, I add. 

I expect Mike to have some quip, but he’s got nothing more than a thousand yard stare. 

“Mike?”, Sveta asks. 

He starts to laugh, an unhealthy, doomed sound. 

Mike stands up, starts to poke and prod around is torso. I don’t know what he’s looking for, but it results in another burst of pained laughter. 

“Michael, what is it?”, Demi asks. 

Mike shakes his head.

“You know, all cards on the table, I thought I was going to come out with some kind of superpower.”, Mike laughs again, “Something like Leo can pull off. But, that’s not the way things go for me, I guess. 

Ash, you good enough for a bit of surgery?”

“Mike, what are you thinking?”, Leo says, concerned. 

“Maybe once upon a time, but son, these hands are far from steady now.”, Ashton admits. 

“Any other doctors in your crew?”, Mike says, knowing the answer, Ashton shakes his head, “Then I guess it’s going to suck to be me.”

And that’s where things need to end for the week. I’m not going to tell you what Mike has in mind, but if we have any luck, we’re going to be able to talk him out of it by the next time I post. 

Till then. 

Keep your friends close. 

Punch.

A little brief about myself: I'm 23 yo, weighing 67kg currently, so I read about if you are fat then try to lose weight to lower your HBA1C, and I was very sad that I'm already in the good weight range, so that wasn't a viable option,

I go to gym 5x/week doing strength exercises only no cardio, and most sedentary, and I used to workout even when I tested 5.6, but my average weight was higher in that period. so maybe also losing a few kgs (2-3) helped in the process.

I was also reading a lot of reddit posts about people who lowered their HBA1Cs, and now I'm one of them. 



so I decided to work on it, I first of all started with the simplest things:  
\- Cut out sugary sweets while fasting for 2-3 hours,

\- Intermittent fasting (12-16) hours, depends on how I feel that day

\-  I would usually not go above 1200-1300 calories in one meal,

\- Swapped white bread, with brown bread for my meals

\- I used to eat a lot of white rice, I just stopped that, and started eating sandwiches instead

\- I would eat my last meal about 2 hours before bed

Here's what I did, while still getting to this 5.3 mark

\- One day I ate 5000 calories while literally not caring about anything, big carb meals

\- about every 3 days I would eat something big carbs and about 1300 cals which is not great

\- I very rarely ate sweets on empty stomach

\- I ate rice maybe 10 times in the past 90 days. so didn't stop it completely

TLDR:

you don't have to make BIG changes to see BIG results.

Simply eat the way you usually eat, but try intermittent fasting and a black coffee in the morning to help you go longer,

Don't eat sugary sweets on empty stomach

And look for smart alternatives (white < brown) bread.

Note: I thought about Continuous glocuose monitor (CGM) right when I started, but I decided not to go with it, since I know I get nervous easily, and more stress would usually lead to higher results.

So I said if I make changes in the next 3 months, I would maybe look into a CGM,

but happily, didn't need it.

Good luck everybody, trust me, you will drop down your HBA1c, especially since you reading this.

1of788i,https://www.reddit.com/r/flashfiction/comments/1of788i/lost_melodies/,Lost melodies,"When Dr. Nila Mukherjee moved into the old apartment above the music shop, she thought it would be temporary — six months at most, until the hospital allotted her a new flat.

But six months became two years.

Every night, after her late shifts, she would hear someone playing the piano downstairs. Never whole songs — just fragments. A few hesitant notes, then silence. Then again, the same bar repeated, slightly different. It annoyed her at first. Then, it became the only sound she waited for.

No one ever saw the player. The shop was closed, boarded, forgotten. Dust gathered on the windows, but the music never stopped.

Some nights, she’d sit by the window with her coffee, listening. The same melody — fragile, uncertain, incomplete. Like someone trying to remember who they used to be.

She knew that feeling.

She’d once been a pianist before medicine swallowed her whole. Her father used to say, “You don’t play with your hands, Nila. You play with your pulse.” But after he died, she stopped. The piano keys reminded her too much of his absence — how his hand would rest on her shoulder after every piece, saying nothing, just breathing the same rhythm.

One rainy night, the sound stopped. No piano. No music. Just silence thick enough to feel.

For three nights, she couldn’t sleep. On the fourth, she went downstairs. The shop door was unlocked.

Inside, everything was covered in dust except the piano — a mahogany upright, worn but alive. One key was chipped. A faint coffee cup ring marked the wood. And beside it, a photo frame — a man, middle-aged, smiling with tired eyes.

The melody sheet was open. The last few notes unfinished.

She stood there for a long time, her fingers trembling above the keys. Then she played. Slowly, haltingly — the same melody she’d heard all these months. Only now, she realized it wasn’t incomplete. It just needed an ending.

When she finished, she didn’t cry. She just sat in the silence, letting the notes fade like old breath.

In the morning, she asked the landlord about the man in the photo. He said the shop owner, Mr. Das, had been dead for over a year.

That evening, Nila opened her window again. The city hummed below, rain tapping softly against glass. Somewhere between memory and sound, she thought she heard a faint echo — a single, clear piano note, struck gently.

And for the first time in years, she smiled.

Over the past 2 years, I've been on dates with 3 women and had a video call with one. 

One of them had the decency to let me down easy and tell me that she was too busy with work and couldn't dedicate time to date. The rest ghosted me after one or two dates. 

If it happens multiple times in a row, I'm gonna have to look inward right? 

Here's what happens: we go on a simple date - coffee, pizza, museum. I ask about them, their lives, their hobbies etc.,. I'm not a flirt or a fantastic conversationalist, but I do my best. I'll pay for the date by default unless the girl offers or insists. I keep it mostly about them or about our shared interests, and will share about myself if they ask or if there was something relevant that happened. 

I'm not the best looking guy out there, but I am confident in saying these women aren't ghosting me because I'm ugly - they saw my pictures when they matched with me, and my pictures are an honest representation of what I look like (fwiw, I'm average/skinny build, honest about my height on my profile at 5'7, brown, groom well, decent haircut, trimmed beard, have decent fashion: I present myself well so I feel better about myself). 

I can't help but think that this is because I have a stutter. It's not a very overt stutter but it's still a noticeable stutter. It hasn't stopped me from making friends with people, but I think I see a look on the women's face when I let out a strong stutter sometimes and inevitably I get ghosted soon. Maybe that's just im my mind. 

Some other things I can think of are that maybe I'm kinda boring in what I talk about or simply not exciting or impressive enough compared to their other prospects.

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1of714v,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1of714v/aitah_for_leaving_my_wife_during_postpartum_after/,AITAH for leaving my wife during postpartum after she almost got our dog killed,"This is a LONG one, and, ITS NOT JUST ABOUT THE DOG. My wife (27) and I (M27) have been married for 7 years and have been together for 8. In those 8 years she has been abusive mentally, verbally, and physically. Im going to start at the beginning. Things were good, but she is diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, so she was prone to angry outbursts, but I also struggle with mental health (depression and anxiety) so I have always been understanding when it came to her outbursts. We lived with my parents for about the first year together as she was basically homeless before that and an alcoholic. In her words, at the time, I saved her. 

Before I get into it, there is a lot of her leaving in her car to go to an empty parking lot to call and talk to her ex boyfriend or his mother. They had been broken up for years but remained friends. We will call him Jim. Before moving in with my parents and I, she kinda lived with him, and his mom had literally adopted her, as her mother was a horrible, narcissistic, child beater. 

The first outburst happened when I had bought her cigarettes, we had talked the night before and she had stated she hates normal cigarettes and prefers 100’s. I bought the normals because thats all they had of the brand and flavor she wanted, and she was also mad because I took an extra 2 minutes to get back in line to buy a Leo lighter (Im a leo, and she had her zodiac sign lighter). I will say, me getting the lighter and making her wait a couple extra minutes was a bad idea because she was already running a little late for work. Between that, and buying the short cigs after discussing how much we hated short cigs the night before led to her flipping out. She cussed me out, called me stupid, an idiot, an R-tard and about every other name in the book. It was an hour drive to get her to work, and when I dropped her off, she screamed about how our relationship was over and how bad of a Bf I was. I understand the anger on that, as BPD causes the brain to get FLOODED with anger. She barely apologized, and I apologized about a million times. This was about 4 months into the relationship. 

The next outburst was a few days later when she sent me to get pizza. She told me the kind she wanted, and gave me the money, she barely had enough to pay for it and I had already spent my check on her. She told me she only wanted a couple slices. So thats what I got her…a couple slices. Not once did she mention she wanted an entire pizza, and just wanted a couple slices for now. Again, I got cussed out, called every name for stupid and told how bad of a partner I was for not JUST KNOWING what she meant when she said “I just want a couple slices”. Again, she told me she was done and was leaving. This was about 5 months into the relationship. She got in her car and drove off, as she did almost every time she got mad. I understand needing space, and she would usually go sit in an empty parking lot by herself and call Jim to talk to him. 

Next outburst was while she was eating dinner. She had worked all day, as did I (she worked at a water park, I worked in a sawmill). She was in a bad mood and kept calling me a piece of sh*t pedo for dating my ex, and sleeping with my ex while the ex and I were together. I was a senior in HS when I started dating my ex and she was a freshman. She lied to me about her age, and lied to me about what grade she was in, saying she was just new to the school and that she was a Junior. I was 17, and she told me she was 16. Everyone else in our friend group was fooled by her also. When I finally found out she was a freshman, and 13 and confronted her, she threatened to kill herself, and even tried slitting her wrists. I felt trapped at that point. If I tried to leave, she’d literally try to kill herself. If I refused to sleep with her, she’d try to kill herself. We were together for over a year and every time we had a disagreement on anything, she’d try to kill herself. Everyone in my friend group had stopped talking to her entirely because of everything that was happening between us, and no, I never told them anything, they just watched and seen for themselves. Back to the actual story. My wife was eating a burger with BBQ sauce while I was setting mozzarella sticks on an oven tray. She kept saying stuff. I playfully said “if you dont shut up, imma throw a cheese stick at you” and giggled. She said something else, and I gently tossed the cheese stick, accidentally knocking the burger out of her hands. She threw both burgers at my head and they exploded when they hit the cupboards and she stormed off. Cussing at me, calling me every name imaginable, swung at me a few times and then drove off to call Jim. She never apologized and I cleaned up the burgers. Ive also been a musician my entire life and always wanted to play in a band. She knew that, as we knew eachother for a couple years, we dated when we were 14/15 but broke up, she left me for Jim. I made sure to make time for her and do the things she wanted me to do, and still spent all my free time with her. She was “okay” with me playing in a band, but would find anything to start an argument about, minutes before I had to go to practice, which she was welcome to come to. This lead to me dropping a few practices and getting kicked from the band. I played bass in this one, and she justified it as “you arent a bassist tho”. I have played bass, drums, guitar and screamed for years before we got together, my ENTIRE family is musicians, and have always played in bands together. Around now, being together for a while, she told me she cheated on me with Jim about 2 weeks into our relationship because she “didnt think we’d last”. Around this time, I was 19, and I got hurt in the sawmill. I had 4 subluxations in the discs in my back, and had 3 totally out of place. I was told the 4 MIGHT go back into place, but I will basically have to manage it the rest of my life, and have some sort of back pain the rest of my life. 

Shortly  before we got married but after we set the wedding date, we found out I had gotten her pregnant. We were over the moon excited. We ended up losing the baby from an umbilical hemorrhage from my parent’s dog jumping up on her, which was somehow my fault. While she was pregnant, I woke up in the middle of the night to her saying she would kill herself, and she had a knife pressed to her wrist, and I talked her out of slitting them with the knife. When we found out we lost him, it was at the gender ultrasound. This was also the first time I got to see my baby on an ultrasound, just to find out he had passed. I was by her side thru everything, thru the loss to her having to push it out. It took 3-4 days in the hospital for him to come out. She almost bled out, no doctor would say a word to me. They just wheeled her out to an operating room. A few days after words once we were back home (my parents house) we were laying in bed talking about whatever when her mood suddenly changed. We were laughing and telling jokes and in one sentence she went from being happy and giggly, to screaming at me about how it was my fault we lost the baby, and how I was the one who killed him. She literally kicked me out of the bed and I landed on the floor, and the next 3-4 hours was her tearing into me for how I somehow killed our baby and how horrible of a person I was. She never apologized but we moved on as she was acting normal again the next morning. 

Everything was fine for a month or two and we got married. We had a small wedding at a cute covered bridge in our towns park. It was all we could afford at the time as we were also getting ready to move out and into our first apartment. At this point I was already feeling torn down and low because of how much we were arguing all the time, but in between arguments, everything was amazing (if you know anyone with BPD, you know how good the highs are). I wasnt the best husband at the time. I was lazy, I didnt clean much (although her, our roommate and I split the cleaning 3 ways). But when I would clean, I made sure the apartment was spotless, except for a room that we threw all our cardboard in and we’d set trash on our back porch until it needed to go out as it was freezing in the winters and none of us wanted to go outside. It was mine or our roommates responsibility to take the trash out to the curb which didnt happen often as we’d both forget. But we would make sure it got cleaned up every couple weeks. We had 5 garbage bags on the back porch when the landlord showed up unannounced at about 9 at night. It was my wifes birthday that day. The landlord knocked on the door and started screaming at her about the garbage, which was (and I agree with this one) my fault entirely. 

Around this time, I started opening up more about my depression and anxiety, and trauma from being severely bullied in high school. I never used it as an excuse for anything. This lead to getting my feelings thrown in my face everytime she got mad, throwing my depression and trauma in my face, stating “just get the fuck over it” and even throwing how low budget our wedding was, and where we had it in my face, which she had said previously “iI dont care about the ring or how much we spend. I just want to marry you”. Around this time, she started laying her hands on me more and more when she’d get angry. I have NEVER hit her back, nor would I ever hit a woman unless they had a weapon and were trying to hurt/kill me. I got a concussion one day at work, it was my 4th concussion. One night we had a bunch of friends over and she found my instagram, which she new I had, and me being a P-addict before we got together, I was following a lot of those kinds of profiles. Earlier in the relationship I told her about it, and she went thru and unfollowed almost all of them. I didnt care, I understood and later I ended up just deleting the app as I didnt even like instagram that much, but she “found” the instagram months later while a bunch of friends were over. I could barely walk straight from the concussion and when she found the profile, she woke me up. I told her “its been deleted from my phone for over a year, I HAVE NOT, used the app or reinstalled it (which was true). She called me a liar and punched me in the head. I, already having a concussion, dropped to the floor because I instantly got dizzy. I met an old friend from school, who was a female. I told her about the miscarriage and tried to re-establish a friendship with her, as she was one of my best friends in school. My wife communicated that she was uncomfortable with it, I didnt listen and kept trying to talk to my old friend, I eventually gave up and deleted her off everything after my wife repeatedly freaking over it. Shortly after we talked about moving to another state. I was okay with it at first. She moved to the state a few week’s before I did, to get us set up in the other state. At this time, I started realizing how peaceful and calm everything was when she was gone. I lied and told her I wanted someone else, hoping it would help her to just leave me. No constant arguing over every single thing, no getting hit for little to no reason, and I felt like I could actually hangout with my friends. I tried to leave then, but she made up a story about how the cartel was after me because I tried leaving her. We were talking on the phone while she was in the other state, and she could tell something was wrong and asked me what was wrong. I just blurted out that I wanted to leave. She was at a friends house who “had connections” and he apparently sent them after me. She told me about it after she had came back to pack the U-haul and that I was “only safe around her”. My idiot self believed it and I ended up moving states with her. 

Things were good for a bit after we moved states. We lived with her father who had no contact with her for YEARS before hand, in the new state. He ended up kicking us out because my wife complained about a co-worker smoking the green plant at work, which neither of us cared about, unless it became a problem, which it was. The co-worker would come in basically comatose because they were so baked. In her dads words, “I wont have a snitch in my house”. She never snitched. Just vented to her dad about it. We moved into a hotel for a bit. She bought a beagle puppy while we lived in the hotel. It was pet friendly and we already had a cat. I said no to the puppy at first (Im allergic to dogs, but my parents had dogs. Didnt realize I was allergic til we moved out of my parents house, we thought I was just naturally sneezy) but when we looked at the puppies, they only wanted $10 for it. I literally couldnt say no and we had the puppy. We had always bickered and had a few big arguments which lead to verbal abuse and sometimes physical abuse from her. 

When we moved out of the hotel, all our stuff fit in two cars. I was working (again) at a sawmill from 5am central time to 2:30 or 3:30 central time depending on the day, and we lived in the eastern time zone. It was about a 20 minute drive away from the town we lived in, to where time zones changed. Before we moved, she snapped at me one morning before work because I had to go to work, and didnt call out to help her pack anything up, which I didnt call out because we desperately needed money. She tried attacking me physically and I shoved her onto the bed and walked out of the hotel. She moved everything herself even tho I told her I would help move everything after I got out of work. Which I tried making clear before the argument, but she absolutely couldn’t wait til I got out. 

Once into our next apartment, I worked very hard at trying to be a better husband. I did laundry nearly every day, I’d fold it and put it away. I swept the floors, vacuumed rugs, did dishes and anything else that needed to be cleaned (bathroom, kitchen counters, the fridge, and bedrooms) tho I will admit, Im a little forgetful and not the best cleaner but DAMN, I really try. This lead to her asking more, and more from me even tho I felt like I was already doing EVERYTHING. It was never enough, she either wanted me to do more, or would say I didnt clean to her standards. She would tell me her expectations and I would do my best to meet them. This lead to me reaching those expectations, and then her demanding I now do more every time I reached those expectations. She then started telling my family (my parents moved to the same town as us and few months after we moved because they wanted to be around for their grandchild when the time came. I understood but she had problems with it) and ALL our friends about how lazy I was, that I never did anything and that she was the one doing all the cleaning even tho it was me doing it all. I tried telling her how I felt, and she would either throw my feelings back in my face, or throw me trying to leave (she had “left” countless times at this point but always came back and would half ass apologize) before we moved states in my face, as well as make fun of me for having messed my back up, and calling it a “pussy excuse to be lazy”, when most days, I could barely stand after work. After about 5 months of this, I will admit, I started to slowly stop doing things. I got even more depressed and checked into a mental health facility, and was in it for a month. Nothing they did helped, nor did the 6 medications they put me on. 

By now, we kept struggling for money almost constantly. We always celebrated our anniversary, but would agree to stop getting eachother Christmas presents (her idea) and I would stop getting her anything for her Birthday because of how bad we were struggling, and not just that, but also because anytime either of us wanted anything, I would get it for her, and rarely would I get what I want/needed, and when I got stuff I needed, I would get screamed at, cussed out, called every name, belittled, and threatened to be left…I literally spent maybe $20 a month on stuff I wanted, and would spend all our money on bills (which she took care of finances because she is weirdly good at budgeting) and stuff she wanted, which would take up the rest of the money we had. I always tried making it up afterwords but Id tell her “if we are so short on money that we literally cant get a dollar can of tea, why would I risk getting you something for your birthday when you will either scream at and belittle me, hit me or threaten to leave me for spending it”. The previous year she had literally done all three for getting her a birthday gift because we were so short on money. Very f’d if I do, F’d if I dont situation, and now she started throwing me checking into a mental health facility in my face, saying I abandoned her for a month just to get a vacation. 

We ended up moving back in with my parents at their new house in this new state about a year after living in that apartment. By this point, 5 years into the relationship, my parents, her family, and all our friends had seen how angry and violent she could be, and kept questioning why I was still with her, even with me starting to “slack off”. They understood why, but I ALWAYS defended her and stuck up for her, saying she couldnt help it because of her mental illness or that it was my fault depending on the situation they brought up. I forgot to mention, every argument, EVERY argument or disagreement, she would call either my parents, her family or our friends mid argument, and try to spin it back on me being the cause of her to be like that, and put them in the middle of it, I had always made it clear that I didnt like that, our business is our business, and no one elses, now back to the story. This is when I really started begging her to get help with her BPD. She all but refused, or say that she would get help, and then never followed thru. She asked me to get help with depression a couple times and I tried to, and nothing worked, she’d claim it was because I just didnt try hard enough. She also started lashing out at my parents quite often, who didnt have to let us move back in with them, but decided to because we’re family. 

She picked me up from work one day and we seen a sign for husky puppies. We stopped to look, even tho I didnt want to, because we already had a cat and another dog (a beagle). After getting home, she asked my parents if we could get one, since we were living with them. I openly opposed it, knowing she would end up wanting to get rid of him (she told me stories about how her mother got rid of her pets on her with no warning, and I knew she would do the same). I ended up, again, being the only one cleaning our area of the house, and taking care of the dogs. We lived there for a year and a half, and I had a job I was unhappy at. I ended up checking back into the mental health facility, again, to no avail. Was in for another month and it, along with the 7 different medications didnt work. During the time there, I was in a band for a short period, which the burn out from work and her abuse, lead to me flipping out at band practice and getting kicked out, and I understand why they kicked me out, they didnt do anything to deserve that. I wasn’t overly mean, just got into a heated argument about the kind of music we’d make (they promised to make one kind of music, metalcore, and it ended up being a coffee shop acoustic band, and Im not a singer, Im a screamer, but was happy to learn). She also, would freak out anytime I had band practice, she’d set expectations of cleaning before practice, and taking her out 1 weekend a month, and I ALWAYS met those expectations, but she would still look for anything to get angry about. Id take her out multiple times a month, most of the time being during the week, to meet her expectations and then some. 

About a month afterwards, we moved into a house on our own, and this is where it would get much worse. Before we moved out, we started working at a factory, with the 3 month probation period. During that period, and months after words, we were working 12 hour days, 7 days a week. Money was good, and we saved a lot because we didnt have time to spend it. I still, took care of almost all the chores and she did little to nothing, except cook and make budgets. Working that much quickly made my back immensely worse, especially since I had re-injured it a few times before this job. I told her I’d like to find another job before we had kids, so I could actually walk when we had them. A few days later she found out she was pregnant, and ended up quitting that job with “I dont want to work there pregnant” as the reasoning. Understandable, but I now had to stay at that job. She promised to take care of all the house work. She didnt, I still did. I never said anything, but she went back to drilling into me for not doing enough at home, remember that part for later. The job cut hours back, to 8 hour days, now 6-7 days a week instead of just 7 days a week, but still had mandatory 12 hour days 2-3 days a week, unless you gave those hours to someone else. I was in so much pain, I had no choice but to give those hours away. I would now be getting cussed out, called the laziest man alive, called useless and worthless, and again, all our family and friends would be informed about how “bad of a husband” I was, for not working those 12’s, and not doing everything around the house, even tho I was. She would use “well they arent up to MY standards” or “you did it wrong” as an excuse. She would rip into me for not working the extra hours because we were now short on money with her not working. I made enough, but barely. We ended up losing that baby too. Her grandmother came for a couple weeks to help us grieve. All of these arguments and all the past ones, were always started about an hour before I had to go to bed. These arguments would last 5-6 hours, until I could only sleep 2-3 hours before work. These “arguments” were her belittling, humiliating, and often physically attacking me. 

One night while her grandma was there, we were just talking in bed alone, with her grandmother out on the couch sleeping (this is maybe 3 weeks after losing the baby). Her mood suddenly switched, and she started attacking me. Saying it was, again, my fault we lost the baby, that I killed another baby, and I had no right grieving ANY of the babies we lost (she has pcos and we’ve lost a few) how she missed her ex, Jim, and another Ex of hers, and her telling me every single way they were better, and better for her. After a couple hours of her saying that shit to me, and me just sitting there taking it, I got up and went into the other bedroom and tried to sleep on the floor. It was quiet for about a half hour, but then she knocked on the door, and kept saying all the mean shit she had previously said. She picked the lock of the door just to keep saying everything to my face. Somehow her grandma never woke up, she also kept hitting me, knowing I would never hit her back, especially with her grandma there, which is also why I didnt say anything back, which I rarely ever did because it wouldnt help. 

The next couple months would be filled with her constantly telling me how bad if a husband I was, how lazy, awful, inconsiderate and horrible I was. I was still doing everything, and had learned to cook, trying to make her happy. Nothing worked. Nothing. She flipped one night, smashed a picture frame and picked up a shard of glass. She sat on the couch and threatened to either slit her wrists or stab me if I leave her alone. I wanted for the right moment to pin her down by the arm and get the glass out of her hand, by pulling her fingers open. I accidentally cut both our fingers pretty bad in the process, I took car of both our wounds and cleaned up the blood when she calmed down. She eventually got on medication to help with her BPD, and everything was amazing. She finally seen how much I had been doing, realized how bad and angry she was, and our relationship was finally good. Then, I lost my job. I had gotten a new one relatively quick (4 weeks) but we had fell behind on bills and she stopped taking her meds because of money. The arguing, abuse, anger and violence slowly creeped back in. Around this time my cousin from way up north moved down here with my parents to start a new life. Her and this cousin got a long pretty good, but I knew that he was an alcoholic, sex addict, and overall, just not a good person, as I heard countless stories of him and his brothers from others in my family. Things were rocky in our relationship, but was still overall, pretty good. 

The more the meds got out of her system (about 5 weeks) the worse she got. She eventually went on a motorcycle ride with my cousin, I trusted both of them. They rode 2 hours away and went to a couple bars. I was not okay with either of those but didnt say anything. She didnt message me the entire time, until they were getting ready to head back. On the way back, he had reached back and rubbed her off on the back of his motorcycle, she showered as soon as they got back. She didnt say Hi to me, just went straight to the shower. She said they didnt have sex and she regretted the experience but Idk. We tried working it out again after she decided not to leave me for him, after he seen how much of an alcoholic nut job be was, and we ended up losing that house due to a job not giving her a paycheck on time. I also lost my job shortly after for having to call out to move everything…back to my parents house. We told them about what happened with her and my cousin. They kicked him out and he fled to a different state. 

About a month later, I finally found a job. Then my grandmother passed. My grandfather passed about a decade beforehand, and I had talked to her (my grandma) about how horrible my last memories of him were because he just wasnt him, he was basically mute and was constantly, violently shaking, and that I didnt want to go to his funeral, but was forced to anyway. My grandmother told me “if it hurts too much, dont come to my funeral, and dont let anyone change your mind. I understand”. My wife guilt tripped me until we went back to our home town for the funeral. She made the entire trip about seeing HER family. We went to my grandma’s funeral and thats all I got to see of my family. I even tried arguing with her to see my family, and she used lack of money or lack of gas or them being too far as a reason. We seen her family almost every day of the 7 days we were there. I didnt get to see my family at all, other than the funeral, and they were only an extra half hour drive from her family. I got her pregnant on this trip. 

After we got back from the trip, and before we knew she was pregnant, things were exactly the same as before the medication. I would endlessly clean and pick up, just for her to belittle me, cuss me out and occasionally hit me for not doing enough. I also got fired from the new job, because I went to the funeral. I told them I would be gone a week, but they claim I never communicated that. I stayed up late one night, as I usually did (usually played video games for a couple hours 3-4 nights a week), but sat debating on if I really wanted to stay in this relationship. I decided I wanted a divorce and would tell her the next morning when she got home from work. She woke me up to tell me she was pregnant, I didnt tell her, and decided to try and make it work for our child. The next few months were entirely her blowing up over every single thing possible, at me, and my parents who were nice enough to let us stay with them, AGAIN. It took me a few months to find another job. 

3-4 months before our son was born we moved into a tiny trailer with both our dogs. Her grandma came to stay with us to help us out when he arrived. She blew up over, I dont even remember, and her grandma had to pull her off me because she was beating the shit out of me. Her grandma packed all her stuff and asked me to take her to a hotel until she could get back home (she couldnt drive so she was going to wait for her brother to drive back, across a few states to get her). My wife made it out to be my fault that her grandma wanted to leave, and my fault that she attacked me in the first place. 

Our Husky has only ever chewed up paper towels, cards and a notebook and one sweater. Thats it, and it happened when he was still s puppy. He’s is a very well behaved boy now. But the more pregnant she got, the more anxious he got when she wasnt around. When she was around, he was extra gentle and affectionate with her. He chewed up one decoration, and put a hole in the bedroom door because she didnt leave it open when she went for groceries (he loved the bed, it was his safe place), and he put a hole in the bathroom wall, which was my fault, I’ll admit that. He is afraid of the dark and I left the light off and left the bathroom door open. She wanted to get rid of him. I argued against it, and kept him. She claimed he was “destroying her mental health” even tho, those were all he destroyed in a few months, which it had been over a year since he did anything like that. He peed and pooped all over the trailer one night, because she didnt take him outside before she left to go somewhere, and he hadnt been out since I left for work, which was HOURS beforehand. She was gone for a few hours. She beat him, until he was so scared, that he pissed again on the couch while she was beating him, and then she beat him more. I got fired from my job and was the stay at home parent. My grandfather taught me NEVER to hurt animals, and its one of my core values and morals (I understand how to punish a dog, and sometimes that requires a spankin, but never beating them) He has been fine since our son was born. Until he chewed ONE Dr. Brown’s bottle. 1 bottle in four months. I understand they are expensive. It was my fault, I left the bottle laying on the couch, and he simply didnt know any better. She beat him, and hit him with a heavy retractable leash. She then opened the front door for him to run out, and him being scared shitless, he did exactly that. It took me about an hour to catch him. In that time, he crossed a highway way multiple times and almost for hit and killed MULTIPLE times while I tried catching him. She took our son to a babysitters while I was trying to catch him because she had to go to work. I packed everything and went to my parents house. That was 3ish weeks ago and I have been there since. 

Edit: yes I brought the dogs with me, I always have, and always will make sure they are DAMN well taken care of. I am also still unemployed but trying to find a job. No, I didnt take the baby with me but I watch him every day while she is at work, and stay for a few hours once she gets home. She (so far) has at least been a fantastic mother to him. I feel like sticking up for her even tho I know, there is absolutely no excuse, and I am TERRIFIED she will see this post ",4,1761334119.0,AITAH,24,0.64,False
1of70wy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cameras/comments/1of70wy/are_you_chasing_the_experience_or_the_result/,Are You Chasing the Experience or the Result?,"First explanation: I'm a hobbyist. This would be a different conversation for a professional, who has an obligation. I'm taking photos for me. 

I have two camera bodies (not counting my money-sucking film cameras, which taunt me and ask to look at my account balance for succor). I have a Sony A7iv, and I just got an old Olympus OM-D E-M5 MK II. 

The Sony is technically superior in every conceivable way besides maybe size. It's also about as fun as a Honda CR-V. The Olympus has a few quirks in the ""I just wish I had one more dial"" kind of way, but I've literally only owned it two days, so could be user error. But also? It's FUN. 

The Sony and my Voigtländer Nokton 50mm f1.2 Aspherical makes absolutely delightful images, and the raw files are fulllllll of dynamic range. I can do a heck of a lot with just this one lens. 

The Olympus takes okay images. Heck, the JPEGS have that (what do they call it- art?) film sim kind of thing. It's fun. And maybe I just haven't found the right lens for it yet, but you know. Okay images. 

So my question, after a fashion: are you trying to make better images? Or are you trying to enjoy the experience of taking them? 

The reason I was thinking this was that I saw a review today of a 35mm lens that someone was saying was amazing, and all I kept thinking was, ""That lens looks like the size of my forearm."" Compared to the M/43 body where the equivalent lens is the size of a lens cap. Even a ""big"" lens on the M/43 (until you get to mega bird lenses) is really no bigger than a coffee mug. 

See what I'm asking? Or is this just me? ",1,1761334104.0,Cameras,9,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1of6vvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/RantAndVentPH/comments/1of6vvp/after_n_years_he_finally_said_sorry_to_me/,"After n years, he finally said sorry to me","I was in a long toxic relationship with my ex for nine years. We even had a child together in 2021. Akala ko noon kaya pa, na maaayos din lahat, pero noong 2023 nalaman kong niloloko niya ulit ako, this time with a workmate. That’s when I ended it. I decided na hindi ko na ipapakita ang anak ko sa kanya. I even burned bridges and blocked his entire family. That was the moment I told myself I was done.

Cheating was always our problem. And the dumbest thing I ever did was keep taking him back kahit paulit ulit na akong nasasaktan. Ang dami kong tiniis, ang dami naming pinagdaanan ng anak ko, all because I kept believing he would change.

He never did.
He never even said sorry. Not once.

Eventually, I picked myself up and decided to move on. I raised my child alone, learned to be strong, learned to live again.

Pero kanina, ewan ko. I was having one of those bad days, the kind where you just feel lonely. Out of boredom, maybe weakness, I thought of reaching out. Not because I wanted him back, but because I wanted peace. I just wanted to see if time changed him, if we could at least end things without bitterness.

So I texted him.
He fetched me from the condo. We went for coffee, and we talked, really talked, for the first time in years. About life, work, everything. It felt almost normal until he suddenly said:

“Gusto ko lang magsorry sayo kasi napagtanto ko na sa 9 years, ako talaga ang naging problema. Hindi ko na hinihiling maging buo pa tayo, gusto ko lang ilabas yung matagal ko nang pinaghandaang gustong sabihin. It’s okay kung di mo na ipapakita anak natin sa akin, okay na okay lang. Pero sana hayaan mong tulungan kita sa gastusin sa kanya. Wala akong hinihiling na kapalit. Masyadong mataas ere ko to think na bago ako magbigay, dapat makita ko muna sya, at sorry kasi maling mali ako doon.

Sayo, gusto kong magsorry kasi ako talaga yung naging dahilan kung bakit di na tayo buo ngayon.
At sorry kung ngayon ko lang narealize lahat to. Sorry talaga.”

And right there, I just broke down.
All those years of pain, anger, and unanswered questions came flooding back. I cried out loud.

“Nagwork ako nang maaga…” I bursted in tears again. “Hinihintay ko lang yan. Nabaon ko na sa limot. Nagmove on na ako kahit wala akong narinig. Ang tagal kong hinintay. Salamat kasi binigay mo na.”

I felt like a child finally being handed the toy she had begged for years ago, not because she still needed it, but because it meant she was finally seen. Finally acknowledged.

I couldn’t stop crying.

But for the first time, they were tears of relief.
Because for so long, I just wanted to hear remorse, kahit isang beses lang.
And now that I have, I feel lighter.

After nine long years, I can finally say it.
I’m free. I’ve let go.
And this time, I’m really, truly okay.

Salamat.

Over the time that I’ve worked here, we’ve had multiple people leave for other jobs and opportunities but they also remove themselves from the chat. It’s always been an understanding that the chat is for current employees. It’s never a big deal, you leave the job, you leave the chat. 

We had a coworker that left in May, and it was very civil. There wasn’t any bad blood, she was opening her own business, we were all happy for her. But here’s the thing- she never left the chat. For months she would continue to have opinions on things that don’t affect her anymore, new products, system updates, etc. ma’am why do you care? 

It all came to a head yesterday when we had a client came in and shared that when they went to ex coworkers new business she was talking smack about our salon. Naturally most of the current employees were rubbed the wrong way. It was brought up that she was still in the chat, but no one wanted to be the one to kick her out because A. She should be self aware enough to leave on her own (clearly she’s not, it’s been months) and B. They didn’t want to ruin the friendships with this person over something like this. 

I, being relatively new in comparison to my other coworkers, offered to be the one to do it as I don’t have as much skin in the game. Eventually my manager asked me to do it so I did. And then… crickets. I heard absolutely nothing.  

Flash forward to this morning I found out she was cussing me out to multiple of my coworkers, and created a new group chat called “OG (insert salon name)”, without me of course. 

So, AITA for kicking her out of the chat? Should I have just left it alone? ",4,1761333456.0,AmItheAsshole,7,0.7,False

But I have a bunch of tea/coffee stains on my front (Toyota **fabric**) seats so I was looking into cleaning it properly and came across videos of detailed interior cleaning. I figured I should just buy these chemicals and equipment once so it can do both maintenance and detailed cleaning and save money on chemicals. That's when I got super confused with all the countless available chemicals.

In the end, for the tea stain itself, I bought Folex. Now, for the interior, it sounds like either P&S Xpress Interior Cleaner or Koch-Chemie Pol Star would be the safest and not harsh like Green Star, though Green Star would be more universal. I found P&S way more expensive ($20 a spray bottle) and also some people said it smells like urine, so I settled on Pol Star. But it's out of stock EVERYWHERE except like 2-3 websites that need at least $100 for free shipping. What is all of your experience with it? Does it restock often? Is it some recent supply chain issue?

Besides that, I got the 303 Aerospace for spraying on after cleaning. For the exterior, not decided yet but my car looks clean so I am not too worried for now.

My wali (who is also my brother) recently suggested that one of his friends might be a good match for me after I mentioned that I’d like to get married. We began communicating through my wali, and everything seemed compatible, so a meeting was arranged.

At the last minute, my wali decided not to attend and told us to meet in a public coffee shop instead. We met briefly, spoke respectfully, had some mint tea, and went our separate ways. A couple of weeks later, the brother told my wali he would like to meet again. My wali backed out once more and gave me the wrong location—twice. After driving for over an hour and a half, I finally managed to meet the brother, we ate, talked, and left.

Because of the confusion, I asked my wali if we could exchange contact numbers to prevent further miscommunication. I didn’t have direct contact with the brother before, and all communication had gone through my wali. My wali was not happy about it but eventually shared our numbers.

Since then, my wali and I have had several heated discussions. He’s accused me of having “issues with Islam” and “problems with my deen” because I apparently don’t want to follow his rules. But my only intention was to make communication smoother, especially since I have children and can’t always travel easily.

We are both adults with kids of our own. Since exchanging numbers, our conversations have been strictly about compatibility for marriage — nothing inappropriate.

A few weeks later, we planned to meet again and both informed my wali separately, but he reacted angrily, as if I was going behind his back or conspiring against him.

Some time passed without any mention of the process, so I reached out to my wali with a kind message apologising if I had overstepped. I also suggested that, due to the difficulties between us, maybe we could continue the process through a mosque. His response was very discouraging — he mocked the idea and said an Imam would “laugh” at me, claiming to know all the Imams in the area. I was really shaken and haven’t contacted him since.

Recently, the brother spoke to my wali again and said he hopes to meet and would like to marry within six months, insha’Allah. My wali told him not to contact me and said he would handle things himself. However, when my wali did reach out, it wasn’t about the proposal — instead, he sent unpleasant and sarcastic messages unrelated to the situation.

At this point, I feel uneasy, unheard, and uncomfortable. I don’t feel guided with love, compassion, or fairness. I genuinely believe this brother could be a good match — he has good deen, sincere intentions, and is financially stable — but I feel blocked and powerless.

What should I do?

I slept late. Much later than usual, even for a Saturday. As I woke, for a moment, I felt I was not alone. The moment faded before my eyes were fully open. I was alone, as I always am.

The sleep had not been restful. I coaxed myself out of bed and began my routine.

I brushed my teeth, put the coffee on, made breakfast—small motions to appease reality, and to confirm for myself that I was indeed a part of it, albeit at times with reluctance. As it often does, everything felt a half-second out of sync, as though mind and matter were confused by the interaction.

When the brew finished, I poured a cup. The black folded over itself, spiraling into a perfect eye. I set the pot back on the burner and looked at the oven clock. 9:13 AM.

When I looked down again, the swirl hadn’t stopped. It was deepening—pulling my vision, my awareness, around and around in an ever-widening spiral. Everything else shimmered, and suddenly I was falling into it.

The world shut like an aperture. Then—nothing.

There was no pain, no sensation, only the stillness of being unmade. Floating between heartbeats. Awareness without agency.

After a few moments, I realized I wasn’t breathing. And with that thought, I was allowed to inhale.

The dark came with it—thick, smooth, filling every hollow. My mind screamed, but my nerves stayed mute. Again, I was awareness without command—a pilot in a dead vessel.

Then the pain began.

Pressure bloomed in my gut, rising through me, radiating outward until I felt I would burst. I tried to scream, but no air moved—only the rising swell remained.

A sickening tearing sound, like sea-soaked burlap being ripped apart, broke the silence. The black around me peeled away, rushing down and out, while what had entered me remained inside.

I hung upside down in a vast chamber. A dim blue-green light bled from fissures in the walls. A living spire pierced my lower back and wove into my spine, the skin buckled and bunched around the point of entry. I couldn’t see it, but I could see the others dangling beside me, strung like fruit on a tree of nerves.

The substrate inside me hummed faintly, vibrating to some inaudible pitch.

Then *they* arrived.

They slid through space in stuttering skips—limbs long and wiry, their physical movements preceding the glitch in their stride. They wore something grown, not made, a material somewhere between polymer and skin.

Their faces were worse than blank. Large, glistening black eyes—and no mouth, only a knot of long, prehensile tendrils shifting where a face should end. Their skin flickered from pale to slate, like shadow moving beneath ice.

One blinked into being before me, the afterimage burning in my vision. It leaned close until its eyes became the world.

A clicking started in its chest and echoed in mine. My organs fluttered to its rhythm. The tendrils brushed my lips, searching, then pried my mouth open and slipped inside.

The tendrils coiled along the inside of my mouth, probing the boundaries of flesh and bone as if memorizing a map. They pressed deeper, moving with careful, separate intent—each testing resistance, each searching for placement, for purchase. Then, as if signaled by an unseen pulse, they moved together. My jaw wrenched open wider than it should, the hinges straining, a hollow crack echoing through my skull. Something larger followed—hidden behind the nest of tendrils, heavy and cold, forcing its way into my throat. The pressure ripped through me in waves, and dark fluid seeped from my nose and the corners of my mouth. Both my body and the creature invading me began to convulse together, as though obeying a rhythm older than pain.

It held my head with long, two-fingered hands and began to drink. Each pull was a wet convulsion. My body spasmed in rhythm.

Around me, the others trembled in the same cadence—each pair a metronome of horror. When the creature paused, the clicking rose again, shaking every molecule.

I caught another set of eyes through the dark—another human, her face draining, skin tightening, splitting to bone. I wanted to look away, but the thing cradled me gently, as if to comfort what it consumed.

Then the blackness flooded back.

Stillness. Warmth.

I opened my eyes.

The coffee was still swirling in the cup.

I looked at the oven clock. 9:12 AM.

This can’t be real, I tell myself. It must be a dream. Then myself answers, inside the breath between thoughts,

""You are the dream. You are the nightmare.""

SupesClub is a Mac app for people who focus better when working around others. You start a work session, your friends see you're working, you see them. Real-time presence, focus timers, leaderboards.

Built it because I kept noticing I got way more done at coffee shops or libraries than working alone at home. Turns out accountability is huge for focus.

Tech stack: SwiftUI, Firebase for backend, Realtime Database for presence.

Live on the Mac App Store now. Would appreciate any feedback.

1of65no,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/1of65no/what_makes_a_nfs_life_easier/,What makes a NF’s life easier?,"This is just a general question because I’m wondering if there’s more I can do to really make sure the families I work for know that I adore them and their kiddos! 

I do a nanny share in one families house so I keep in touch with mom and dad of the other baby all day and send lots of photos. I record everything we do on the huckleberry app and send everything back home clean! I also make sure to give them a quick run down of baby’s day when they pick baby up. We also do art once a week that gets sent home with her! 

For my primary family, the things I’m required to do are baby’s laundry, clean bottles, and keep our areas tidy. That’s literally it! I try my best to do way more though because I usually time! And when I don’t, they literally don’t care. I can sit on my butt the entire nap if wanted and I love them for it. 

What’s something you do/your nanny does that makes you life easier?! I absolutely love the family and they’re super busy so I love helping where I can. I’d love ideas/tips of what to add in that would make things that much easier for them!! 

Here’s some of the extra stuff I do: 
-Clean the older child’s laundry/tidy his room a bit when I notice it’s crazy in there
-Clean up their playroom/media room every Friday so it’s clean when I’m leaving for the weekend 
-Clean any dishes they haven’t been able to get to yet and put away the dry ones
-Move around/fold their laundry if there’s any being done when I’m doing some
-Taking purées out of the freezer when she’s close to finished so they don’t even have to think about it 
-Organizing the toy closet 
-Wiping down the kitchen and coffee area
-Cleaning out old purées in the fridge
-Washing the baby seat attached to the breakfast bar area (this is where baby primarily eats with me) 
-Wiping down the high chair 
-Taking out the diaper pails when full 
-Restocking diapers and wipes when getting low
-Washing and changing baby’s sheets/sleep sack once a week 
-Resetting their couch (fixing pillows/blankets) 
 
There’s definitely more little stuff that I’ll do as I see it but this stuff happens everyday/week!

My first thought was “If he can do it, maybe I can too.”

Problem: I have **zero coding knowledge**.  
I can read some PHP or HTML, but that’s it.  
Still, I started building… and one small idea turned into a full-on project.

You get all the main lines — 1X2, Over/Under, BTTS, HT/FT, Double Chance, Corners, Cards, Correct Score…

⚡ There are also “Safe Picks”:

* Football: 80%+ prediction probability
* Basketball: 70%+ prediction probability

Obviously nothing is 100% — but results are looking good so far, and I’m constantly improving it.

1of614x,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowWork/comments/1of614x/the_avoidance_of_pain_and_dopamine_addiction/,The avoidance of pain and dopamine addiction,"The avoidance of pain and dopamine addiction 

I've been noticing my addiction to phone scrolling is similar to porn and sex addicts coping mechanism, similar to even my urge to get coffee and tea in the morning. Also compatible to my addiction to write journals and send it to artificial robot chats. 

I'm also craving for that stimulation, the same way adhd stim and do the sexual fantasies and orgasm etc. 

It's just something to calm and soothe. 

Whenever I could not regulate my emotions, I maladaptive day dream about that guy who I dated that is so great and doesn't even watch porn and gave me so much hope but ghosted me due to his own life struggles and wounds. Or I would reach out for my phone to watch the latest cat videos, especially the cat chiro videos from a German guy who I found so soothing and calming, I would do that until I forget about my distress and emotional pain and be able to be sedated enough to go back to sleep. 

I used to tell people I do cat porn and meowsturbation because I would meow to myself self sooth, people would laugh at my joke but I'm not even joking at all. 

When we are reliant on external factor to regulate sooth and avoid, this is just how addiction happens, everything can be an avoidant/ coping strategy, even the seemingly good stuff like acquiring fame wealth beauty status success what not. 

For me I currently use that guy as limerance, all the time we spent together and how sweet and spicy it was and all the promising futures he gave me, the cat videos and the circus videos, I constantly imagine I have the perfect cat, husband, on island doing circus. I used to collect investment grade jewelry to cope until I was burgled by the police for sunbathing in my garden and I couldn't use it since last year summer anymore. 

I wonder how long it would take me to be able to be courageous and brave enough to face my inner demons, my fear my pain and my emotions. There's always something to distract. It doesn't even need to be porn orgasm or food or water, I have done fasting from all of those but there would be always something else to distract the silence, the real emotions we are feeling, where the healing begins.

This one was the smoothest of all. Feeling fine.

I had to work a lot last weekend and decided to take \~100mg of caffeine (10g of beans) sunday morning (Hario V60).

I did feel a little of joy, but nothing extreme (I'm very sensible).

But I felt like sh!t for 3-4 days after it. Difficulty in concentration, low motivation, disperse attention and focus, tiredness and sleeping on my desk (I slept well those days).

Is this like this for you too? Even being free for months, only 1 cup of coffee can make this outrageous effect?

I think that's why I always come back to it... You take 1 cup and then you have to take 1 cup everyday to feel normal again.

For example: today is day 5 since that cup of coffe, and last night was awful — my baby girl woke me up at 3h30 am and I'm wake since then... and I am feeling MUCH BETTER than monday and sunday! No tiredness at all.

1of5wim,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1of5wim/starting_over/,Starting over,"I was caffeine free for about eight months and saw VERY significant improvements in my anxiety. Then went through a stressful period this summer and caffeine started creeping back in in the form of matcha and cacao. (Interestingly, even the idea of drinking coffee makes me sick now, and this is after being a coffee addict for three decades, starting in my teens. There is just something really weird about it. It’s actually kind of repulsive to me now. I sat in a fancy coffee shop the other day that supposedly has good coffee, and when I left, my clothes smelled gross, almost like faint cigarette smoke. I think it was from all the coffee smell in the air.)

I’ve been having more anxiety again, and at first attributed it to stress. But I’m going fully caffeine free again (on day three now) to see how that feels. So far I don’t think I’m having many withdrawal symptoms, other than extra fatigue in the afternoons, which has been the big one for me each time I’ve quit before. But the cravings for matcha are bad right now. I’m wondering if it’s in part because I’ve been self medicating my ADHD, and I also know just how addictive caffeine can be, so I’m going to ride it out and see if the anxiety improves at all.

- Remote worker so move around throughout the house a lot; will use iPad for both personal consumption (gaming/media) and also work (Zoom calls, docs, etc)
- Also travel multiple times a month - need to be able to use iPad in variety of environments, on planes, in coffee shops. I do sometimes work outside where there might be sun/glare (obviously would have freedom to do that more with nano)

I don’t love the extra cost from going up to 1TB but can be ok with it for nano. Got both versions now but plan to return one, initial observations:

- I do notice the minor change in brightness/color/depth of blacks, etc. - normal screen is beautiful and the best looking but it’s hard to tell if it’s really material. The nano screen is still really good (especially since I’m coming from an iPad mini 6)
- The glare reduction is real - I have bright lights indoors in my house and am now noticing things like even reflections from ceiling lights/chandelier on the normal iPad which is definitely more distracting then the nano. Nano is perfect on this front - zero distractions, complete usability
- Feeling - I don’t draw but I do have a Pencil Pro that I use sometimes for normal activities and also take out for work and use for notetaking (not a regular use case but one that is still important for me and I want to use the iPad for.) Definitely notice the difference - much better writing experience on nano (but not as good as a Paperlike); also noticed what others have commented around the feel of the screen using touch - it’s actually much improved vs. the glass which now I’m noticing is harder and rougher to do swipes/gestures
- Interesting difference in overall look - there’s definitely a trade off to the depth of color/color quality but nano also has its own unique look. Others have commented on the “e-ink” similarity and I notice that too and think I might like it (hard to say since it’s only been a day.) Also thinking about whether it’s a bad thing to have variety in different types of screens since I already use MacBook and iPhone that have the normal glossy

The Office conundrum

I tugged at the dhupatta that was stuck to my jhumka for the thirteenth time that morning. “Ugh”, I struggled with it yet again. I am not a fan of dressing up, definitely nothing as elaborate as this. I had diligently dressed myself up. No, not for the ethnic day at work. But for his eyes. Yet, I hadn’t seen him since I swiped into work that day. 

“Break? Coffee?”, someone tapped at my shoulder. “Sure”, I pushed my chair back closing my laptop. And just when I turned around, I spotted him a row over, nodding at someone but his eyes on me. 

I acted nonchalant, like I always did. My eyes momentarily raking over him before I looked away. I knew his eyes did the same, like it always did. I didn’t need to look at him confirmation. 

An hour later, I bumped into him right around the hallway that lead to the rest room. “Oh, I’m sorry. Didn’t see you there”, I took a step away. His fingers wrapped around my forearm at the pretense of steadying me or I wondered if he was simply steadying me, “you alright?”. I stared at his fingers on me. When had he gotten this bold? He’d never so much as set foot near me. I watched him pull his hand back and for a second I imagined the fingers elsewhere. “Yes”, I nodded meeting his gaze. 

And his gaze dropped lower. “Excuse me”, I walked away, cheeks warm but the rest of me? A lot warmer. 

At lunch, I felt his palm at my back or I wondered if I imagined it. And my peaks had hardened immediately. A little later, I caught him watching me near the water cooler. At the conference room, he most definitely stared at the pen in between my lips. 

I decided I had had enough of this cat and mouse game. It had been an unusually torturous six months. 

“Can you stay back? I want to discuss plans for the next release”, I told him just as the room was emptying. 

We waited patiently until the last person closed the door behind them. 

I inhaled. And exhaled. 

Eyes steady on my laptop screen, I typed away as I spoke, “Do you plan to just keep staring? Or, are we actually going to do something about this problem we got on our hands?”.

(54M, 48F, 8 years)","Hello a 54M, and after 8 years with his partner (48F), things crumbled out of the blue. They built a life—travels, a home, deep talks—but resentment from his workaholic habits and her unspoken doubts led to a sudden split. She said she needed space to ""find herself,"" and he spiraled: endless what-ifs, drunk texts, feeling like  wasted his time. It wasn't cheating or drama—just emotional drift that left him gutted, questioning if he'd ever attract real connection again.

A few weeks in, he went full no-contact: blocked, deleted, no peeks. Brutal at first (nights hit hard), but it forced self-reflection—therapy unpacked his patterns, gym rebuilt his confidence, and journaling highlighted his strengths. Surprisingly, she reached out to him after 2 months for coffee; they talked honestly, but he held boundaries.

1of5ont,https://i.redd.it/9eelmcv8t3xf1.jpeg,glucose increases with exercise,"Does anyone have explanations as to  glucose rise in non diabetics, especially when type 1 diabetics doing the same activity have a glucose drop even with their insulin suspended?

Not diabetic, but am over weight, 50 in surgical menopause. A1C a few months ago was 5.3 and I get labs done every 6-12 weeks that usually has my glucose just under 100 no mater if fasted or if I had eaten breakfast.  

Mom and wife of type 1 diabetics so I was already familiar with the G7 (as well as G6 and medtronics CGM). I basically am just a data junkie and my husband wanted to take something I was planning on taking to increase gh that has a potential to raise blood glucose. So I got a few months worth to see how my glucose changes with that to have a better idea of what it may do to my husbands glucose. 

I found exercise raises my glucose. Every single time. This was this morning's 2.33 mi walk and was the first exercise activity that had the initial decrease. The first rise was the peak after breakfast which was  2 dry oz protein+ pasta, a crispy vegan chicken patty and a half pound of cauliflower with 2 cups of baby kale...so roughly 60 gr carbs.

I was surprised at how high this reads my glucose knowing where I usually am with blood workup. Tho I Haven't done a finger stick to compare the accuracy. But I do know even the G7 can be slightly off with moments of being way off. (so far no one's cgm is accurate enough for my family to go on auto loop with their insulin pumps)

I am also finding a rise after having coffee (black coffee) and then of course when I am feeling thirsty. I have a bad habit of not drinking water early in the day because I am drinking my 2 cups of coffee and too busy to think about it. ",3,1761330963.0,stelo,5,1.0,False

1of5nql,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1of5nql/increase_in_adzenys_dosage_symptoms_and_advice/,Increase in Adzenys dosage - symptoms and advice,"Hi! I’m on my first ADHD medication, Adzenys XR ODT. Started on 3.1, went up to 6.3 after a week and not experiencing much difference. 

Talked with my psych and decided to try to titrate up to 9.4 (for those unfamiliar with Adzenys dosage, this is like a 15mg Adderall). However my prescription was delayed, and while I was waiting I went back down to 3.1 for a week so that I wouldn’t run out of meds (I was taking 2 to get the 6.3 dose)

I had skipped a day earlier in the week when I woke up too late and didn’t want to take it and be up at night, and I had bad side effects from skipping it. 

Today was my first day taking the 9.4, and I’m not sure if it’s too high, not the right medication, or if I need to just try it for a few more days to see if it will level out. 

I’m having symptoms of sweating/clamminess, and feeling shaky. Not feeling calm and focused like I did before. I haven’t eaten a  lot today yet, and my appetite hasn’t been great on this medication in general. This could possibly be the cause of feeling shaky? I also feel anxious, which is normal for me, but heightened awareness of it. I also had a coffee this morning, which was probably not the smartest idea. 

Anyways, my main question is should I continue to take this dose over the next few days, try to eat a bigger meal in the morning, and see if these symptoms subside? How long have y’all taken a dose that you thought maybe was too high? I want to give it a chance because I did feel like the 6.3 was a bit too low, and this seems like a pretty low dose still so I’m not sure why I’m having such a reaction to it? Since the next few days are the weekend and I don’t have  a lot going on, maybe I should keep taking it and see what happens. 

I know Adzenys is not a super popular option, does anyone else have experience taking it and finding the right dosage? Or if it didn’t work for you, which medication did? 

Thank you!  I know ADHD is a journey but I can’t wait until I get meds/dosage figured out. ",1,1761330904.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False
1of5nmb,https://i.redd.it/ace9zxu1t3xf1.jpeg,Pre-Tower Flash Contest: Make us a new logo and get a free Coffee Stain Studios Game,"FLASH CONTEST NUMBER ONE:

**One steam code for a coffee stain game of your choosing.**

>I promised that Coffee Cup would hire the best, but I didn't promise they would have a sense of humor. I delivered on what I promised and what I didn't promise.
>
>The developers at Coffee Stain foolishly trusted me with a few promo codes for the tower event. After checking with my usual resalers and learning that selling all 48 codes would only net us $6 total, I decided to add them to our prize pool and give them away in a few flash contests in the week leading up to our tower climb event.

If you were in our Discord, you would have had a 4 hour head start 😁

20 hours from now we will declare a winner. Maybe a couple?


Caveats: 


- The logo can be inspired by AI, but the final product can't be AI


- Because we are a parody company of the real coffee stain and use a similar name, our logo should make it clear at a glance that we are unofficial. You can use humor to do this or be creative and show it some some other way. 


- it should work as a full size image and also as an avatar/ profile picture. 


- we will definitely use it and keep it in rotation, but just know we will very likely alter it for holidays/events and swap to new logos whenever we feel like it.


- We have to be able to use it freely. Our only promise is that it will never be used by us to promote hate or anything too inappropriate.

My friend and I (both f/20s) live in different cities, but as both of us have ties to both cities, we see each other fairly regurlarly. We had planned to meet for coffee next week.

Yesterday, my friend texted me that she’d had a mental breakdown and might have to cancel our coffee date as she’s with her family in a different city & doesn’t know when she’ll be back because she doesn’t want to be alone right now.

She has always been a people pleaser and it seemed like she felt guilty for possibly having to cancel our coffee date. She told me she would text me next week to confirm if she’s available for the coffee date. I told her not to worry about that and assured her I’d always be there for her whenever she needs me or wants to talk.

I’m worried for her because I know she isn’t good at putting herself and her mental health first. I would like to reach out and check on her from time to time, but I am afraid she would interpret a simple “how are you? Are you feeling better?” as “what about the coffee date?”

I don’t want to put pressure on her or cross her boundaries, I just want to show support. Unfortunately, she doesn’t have many close friends, so the thought that a friend cares about her wellbeing and wants to support her without expecting anything in return is new to her.

What do you think is the best way to support her right now? Advice needed & sorry for the length of this post!",1,1761330893.0,FriendshipAdvice,2,1.0,False

Help?,"Hello worm friends, I hope this is an okay post because I’m not sure where to start! I was hoping I could just check the wiki but it’s empty.

My little brother is autistic and can get very set on a certain idea or way of doing something. Right now he’s obsessed with trying to get worms going to make soil, but they’ve died twice and he is crushed. I’ve gotten like ten phone calls about worms in the last 3 days. 

I would just go looking for posts, but I think he’ll take a straight answer based off of what he’s tried so far and why it isn’t working better. 

This is what he told me he did;

“I made a mixture of hay, some dirt I dug up that had a lot of dead roots in it, a tiny bit of coffee grinds and a rotten avocado. Unfortunately it got too wet at first but I got it to the dampness of a damp rag or sponge then added the worms. They crawled off, disappeared then died”

I have reason to believe more food scraps went into the bin than he’s admitting to, and I think he’s just throwing big scraps in 

It’s probably worth noting that we live in the Mojave desert, our “soil” is alkaline, and it’s still pretty warm out here - we’re in the 80-90f range for the foreseeable future.

I told him I think he should start out with isopods and give them a few weeks to stabilize the bin before trying to add worms, but he said that would be pointless because the isopods would be doing what the worms would do and he’s convinced the worms will just die again. That’s just based on what knowledge I have from creating bioactive enclosures for my geckos, though. I’m not familiar with composting or worm farming. He’s thinking about doing isopods and black soldier flies instead. I’m not sure if they’ll do the same thing he’s wanting from the worms? 

I’m probably going to get him some isopods and BSF larvae today, and if possible, talk about the worms again once he’s recovered from the emotional blow. 

Any pointers or obvious places he went wrong? ",4,1761330200.0,Vermiculture,4,0.83,False

And if these rights are violated the public will be publicly punished in a weird way like posted online explaining why they wanted to hurt puppets rights. Here are some rights that were passed along with the real world puppet revolution website

The fundamental rights of SOCK PUPPETS and puppets

1️⃣
The Right to Public Presence
Every sock puppet has the right to appear in public spaces without ridicule, discrimination, or being told ""that's weird."" They deserve to be seen in coffee shops, offices, airports, and all establishments without judgment.
2️⃣
The Right to Professional Recognition
Sock puppets should be welcome in professional settings including business meetings, job interviews, courtrooms, and medical appointments. A puppet's presence should be considered normal business conduct.
3️⃣
The Right to Transportation
Puppets deserve their own seats on planes, trains, and buses. They should not be forced into bags or luggage compartments. Airlines and transit systems must accommodate puppet passengers.
4️⃣
The Right to Dining & Services
Restaurants must allow puppets at tables. Puppets have the right to order meals, use menus, and be served by waitstaff. Businesses must provide puppet-friendly services

Me (32m) and my SO (34F) and are getting married February next year. Been together nearly 8 years. I absolutely love that woman, and we work so well together. But her brother in law has always been a pain in the ass from the start. 

He very quickly decided for some reason that the best way to deal with me is to just pretend I'm not there: if i ask him a question or how he's doing, he won't respond. He'll talk to other people around us exclusively, such as his wife, his sister, mother and family friends. 

It's gotten to the point I know there's other people who have mentioned it to him. But he doesn't care. I've tried to have a conversation with him at least once, but we've never even had that. The most important ever got was how I was doing and whether I wanted a coffee once. 

Things got quite stressful during the covid pandemic, as he was getting married in that time, so when he had to reduce numbers he uninvited me and asked my mother in law to be to tell my SO. This devastated her and me. Yes, he had to reduce numbers, but it conveniently turned out I was the only partner who wouldn't be invited as a plus one at that point. I was then reinvited when numbers and wedding restrictions lifted and seriously considered not going. But I went as my SO begged me. 

Since he and his wife have had children, I feel more tense. I don't feel welcome at his home, I know his wife tries to talk to me to include me in things, but it just makes things awkward when he clearly tries to have conversations in the room with others as if I'm not there. He tells his children to hug his sister and doesn't mention me. 

I've heard what he says when I'm not around, but not all of it. About how it's not natural for families to have same sex parents or how immigrants are taking over the country and the nation is losing it's way, or jokes about mixed race couples But since none of it is ever mentioned when I'm around, I'm limited in what i can do. 

The prospect of having to endure this for the rest of my life is a wearying one. I have spoken with my partner about it, and it upsets her. I feel awful as she wants him to come to the wedding, and i don't anymore, even if he won't have an active role in it. I feel I've been treated invisibly for too long to want him there, and she says she can't help how he acts but since her father passed away 10 years he's the last link she's got to him. She has suggested asking him not to come with great effort, but then that means our sister in law won't come. 

So, how do I resolve this? This piece of shit is coming to the wedding. I've cut out others from the RSVP list who have treated me poorly this year, but he's exempt. How do I just accept it? 

TLDR: my brother in law to be has acted for nearly 8 years as if i don't exist. How do I just accept that's the way things are going to be? Nothing i can do will resolve it without ripping up family dynamics. 

Edit: I should clarify, he's her brother, and my brother in law to be. I take what he says when I'm not around a bit more seriously, as I'm also a minority. ",19,1761329870.0,relationship_advice,49,0.92,False

The real key is pacing. Lead with the hook (what made this problem interesting), get to the tension fast (what was broken or risky), and resolve it cleanly (what changed and why it mattered). Everything else is optional.

I’ve found the sweet spot for online readers is around 600–1,000 words, enough space to tell a real story, short enough to read over coffee. Add clear subheads, one strong visual, and a quotable insight, and it’ll feel shorter than it is.

So, don’t trim for length, trim for energy. A great case study doesn’t end when it’s “done,” it ends when there’s nothing left that makes the reader skim.

1of56os,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1of56os/rf_the_day_i_towed_a_sedan_and_accidentally/,[RF] The day I towed a sedan and accidentally became a neighborhood legend,"I never thought I’d be the type of person who called a tow truck. I’m usually the “let’s talk this out over coffee” kind of neighbor, but sometimes suburban peace needs a bit of chaos to stay balanced. This all started with a silver Honda Civic that apparently believed my driveway was a public attraction. It wasn’t just parked there once. Oh no, this car had commitment issues—it kept coming back like a bad sequel.



The first time it happened, I left a note on the windshield that said, *Hey, friendly reminder this is private property. Please don’t park here. Thanks!* The next morning, I found my note crumpled up on my lawn with a small doodle of a smiley face. I tried to be understanding. Maybe they didn’t see it. Maybe it blew away. Maybe I was being too sensitive about my own concrete rectangle.



The second time, I decided to talk to my neighbor directly. The car belonged to his daughter, who had just gotten her license and apparently thought my driveway was the perfect “practice spot.” I asked politely if she could avoid parking there. He smiled, said “Of course,” and promised it wouldn’t happen again. I believed him. I’m an optimist. That was my first mistake.



A week later, I woke up at 8 a.m. ready to go grocery shopping and there it was again. Silver. Shiny. Mocking me from ten feet away. Blocking my car in like it was marking territory. I could practically hear it whisper, “What are you gonna do about it, pal?” That morning, I realized something crucial: diplomacy had failed. It was time for action.



I called the local towing company. The guy who answered sounded way too excited, like he’d been waiting his whole life for this moment. “Oh yeah, we’ll take care of it,” he said, chuckling. “Address?” Twenty minutes later, a tow truck pulled up, big and bright yellow, humming like justice itself. The driver stepped out, took one look at the car, and said, “Sweet. Easy hook.”



I won’t lie—watching that Civic being lifted off my driveway was satisfying. Like years of quiet frustration being pulled into the sky. I stood there with my morning coffee and nodded as if I’d just signed a peace treaty. The driver gave me a thumbs-up and left. I went inside, feeling lighter than air.



Two hours later, the neighbor came knocking. Hard. His face was a shade of red I didn’t know skin could reach. He shouted that I had “embarrassed” his daughter, that I should “have some decency,” that I’d “gone too far.” I calmly reminded him that she’d been told several times not to park there. He demanded I pay the towing fee. I pointed out that I wasn’t the one who violated parking law. That didn’t go over well. He stormed off, muttering something about “neighborhood councils” and “revenge.”



Then the group chat started. Apparently, someone filmed the tow truck. Within an hour, I had messages from three neighbors saying things like “Finally!” and “Good for you!” One even brought me a muffin basket. A kid down the street called me “Tow Guy.” The nickname stuck. For the next week, people waved when I walked by. Someone even left a little toy tow truck in my mailbox as a trophy.



By the end of the month, I was a local legend. The Civic never came back, the driveway stayed clear, and I learned that sometimes, doing the right thing means being a little bit petty. I didn’t set out to become famous in my own cul-de-sac, but life’s funny that way. Every time I see a tow truck now, I salute it like an old friend.



And if you’re wondering what happened to the neighbor’s daughter—she parks perfectly fine these days. In her own driveway.",2,1761329791.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False

Recently came out as bi...because strong feelings are pulling me beyond my hetero marriage,"Hi everyone - I'm brand new here. At 31 I realized I'm bi - had been quietly wrestling myself about it since I was a teen, but due to various se\*ual traumas that I won't get into, it took me that long to really realize this fully about myself.

I am 41 now. A few YEARS ago, I did open up to my husband that I identify as bi. He and I have been together 17 years at this point. His reaction was accepting, and we left it as, ""if this ever needs further conversation, we'll cross that bridge if and when.""

Well...this year, it happened: in recent months, I came to realize that I have feelings I can't suppress or ignore for a gay woman I've known as a casual friend for about 7 or so years, from a gym setting. Our orbits drifted in the last 2-3 years or so due to some personal health and life circumstances I was handling, and our paths did not naturally cross. Then this past January, as my health improved and I started getting back to the gym more frequently, I found myself in her orbit again...and then in August, it hit me like a ton of bricks: I'm attracted to her in \*THAT WAY,\* and even in past years, if I'm being truly honest with myself, I'd felt a little hint of something even before I fell out of her orbit for a while.

I spoke first to my closest friends (some of whom already knew I was bi, others did not), then to some family members (I literally came out in order to even tell them about this), and then finally approached my husband. I stated that my feelings for him are unchanged, and that my strong attraction to my casual friend is something new and somewhat frightening that is layered ALONGSIDE everything I still feel for him and for the life we continue to build and expand together. I further explained, to the best of my abilities, that these feelings I have for this woman cannot be suppressed or hidden; they're burgeoning inside me at this point, and I let him know that as my best friend and life partner and husband, I want and need him to be part of this journey with me - whatever it may be.

I further clarified to him that I've never spent time with this woman outside of a group or gym setting, because even going out for a simple coffee knowing how I feel in my heart for her would feel like a deceit to him. I also explained that this is not ""just about sex,"" my feelings are far more complex and nuanced than that.

I also let him know that I care deeply enough for her that I'm trying to do all the right things (however difficult it may be: coming out to my family, communicating to my most trusted loved ones what I'm experiencing, etc) despite having no road map for this - but that I DO know I cannot compromise my own integrity as far as my loyalty to him, nor can I put HER into a position of feeling like ""the other woman"" or a ""dirty little secret."" 

All this, and she has no idea how I feel, or even that I'm bi - I'd be shocked to learn she figured out I'm not straight all on her own. I may give off a vibe to some, but my bisexuality is not at all readily apparent by appearance (at least I don't think :)

My husband was patient, asked questions with curiosity, finished with a lighthearted joke about the throuple neighbors we used to have in our building (we were all friends), and then asked for some time and space to think about things. This was about a week and a half ago, but he's been away visiting family, and so I had proactively counted on a long pause to the dialogue.

Anyway, I'm just seeking some support / advice / whatever anyone may have to offer, because this has been difficult to navigate to say the least. If anyone on here is in a hetero marriage that allows for sapphic exploration in a manner that is open and transparent for all parties involved, I'd really like to hear your experiences :)",1,1761329714.0,BiWomen,2,0.57,False
