1j0symv,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1j0symv/omad_wasnt_for_me_heres_what_worked/,"OMAD wasn't for me, here's what worked","Reposting here because r/OMAD mods removed this without explanation...

This post is aimed mostly towards OMADers who struggle and feel hungry after eating.

In 2023 I did OMAD intermittently for some months to lose a bit of weight before my wedding. I ultimately failed. OMAD just wasn't for me. 

Here's the issues I experienced while doing OMAD:
- heightened food noise and cravings
- scrolling recipes and food pics for hours 
- eating really heavy meals to ""make sure I was eating enough""
- feeling hungry during fasting and after my one meal
- feeling bloated and overly full after eating
- negative feelings of self-worth, as though my fasting meant I was unworthy of food or something (the most worrying symptom)
- struggling to stick to eating only once a day due to social and work reasons. For instance, going to a coffee shop with a friend and having only a cappuccino would have been impossible, because thst would have broken my fast. 

About a month ago I decided to give ADF (alternate day fasting) a go. This pattern suits me so much better! I have no cravings or hunger during my fasts. I eat normally, also light foods (such as vegetable soups which I tend to eat every week). I am well on my way to my goal weight. And I don't feel like I'm denying myself at all, I just delay eating for one day. I'm naturally not hungry in the mornings so I just ride that lack of appetite all day long. I drink espressos and plenty of water during fasting days.

The reason why I wrote this post is to encourage others to try different fasting methods to see what fits them. If OMAD feels hard, it doesn't necessarily mean you can't do longer fasts. Try ADF and see if it's easier to have full eating days instead of eating just once a day.

It's like every line he speaks is being posted by the media as if it's some sensational breaking news like wtf..

It just doesn't make any sense, wtf is one supposed to do with him saying my mood is stable all day and hence he doesn't want coffee?

We all fucking know when and why one drinks coffee, but they just decide to wake up pick a random line from his latest youtube video n post it 

And the funniest part is this isn't the first time 

The day he left the podcast due to pollution , it was  milked for like 1 entire week, every other post was about him , like wtf?

It's fully understandable to see them posting about it, once or twice it's pretty good but just spamming the same shit everyday in every other post.

Okay , you posted Abt the pollution thingy, why post about random shit that's not even important?


How tf is this a news, him saying he doesn't drink coffee cause he is feeling good and doesn't need it?

While searching for reviews and comments, I stumbled upon a single-pour technique for the V60.

I tried this technique and I was pleasantly surprised that such a simple pour and a fast drawdown in the V60 results in a very nice black coffee. I tried it with Blue Tokai Silver Oak and Hunkal Heights Aranya Gold, 15 clicks on the Timemore C2. Drawdown took barely 30-40 seconds, yet as tasty if not tastier than the usual 2.5-3.5 min pour-over. Also, I do have a pair of metal chopsticks, so I was able to stir just the way the guy recommended.

  
The video's a bit long (almost 23 mins) but it's worth it. I'm glad I don't have to buy the Hario Mugen now. 

  
Hope you guys try this method and like it.",2,1740809211.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

1j0sto9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1j0sto9/after_a_stressful_morningafternoon_i_did_a_good/,After a stressful morning/afternoon I did a good job of just taking care of myself.,"This morning and afternoon were incredibly stressful for me and I'm already in burnout and I'm also in a depressive episode. My depression meds aren't working despite upping the dosage, after being on it for two months, and I'm once again having trouble getting out of bed in the morning and feeling motivated to do things. But my doctor won't let me switch meds until I've tried the higher dosage for like a month. I personally think that isn't fair but whatever.

But this morning I had an unsatisfactory chiropractor appointment where I waited for 45mins before being seen and then the appointment itself was very rushed. My jaw is still getting stuck when I eat and then I have to pop it a couple of times to get it unstuck. But after dealing with this issue for about a year I've gotten used to the pain to an extent.

Then this afternoon I went to a Target that was on my way home from the chiropractor to pick up a few items: face wipes, coffee for work (those glass bottled coffees), and beard dye for dying my eyelashes (I do it once every few weeks and I'm very careful). I also wanted to get a backpack for my trip later this week and a cute swimsuit caught my eye. Well there was an issue with the alarms and tags on some of the items that I purchased and it was a whole ordeal. I made a separate post about it.

But tonight I took it easy. I played Monopoly on my phone and I won 5 times when I usually don't win at all. I packed for my upcoming ski trip and I watched college gymnastics on tv. My middle sister was a college gymnast. 

I also took all of my meds (including Mucinex for my never ending sinus infection), cleaned my face, took care of my sisters hedgehogs (feeding and getting them water only as I'm allergic to them), and now I'm sitting down and having a late night snack of some cheerios before heading to bed.

All in all it's been a decent night and I'm glad. It's been awhile since that happened. I was able to put aside and ignore most of my physical chronic health problems, not the vision issues though, and just enjoy a relaxed evening.

Life is hard as an autistic woman with chronic health problems both mental and physical but I'll get through it all and cherish the good moments and do my best to forget the bad ones.

Do I sound thrilled? NO! I'm getting depressed, afraid, and confused. I can't stress enough how this disability caged me even more than before. I (F24) had a total 5 seizures in the span of 5 months, twice this February on different days. My blood tests and two EEG results were all normal tho but I'm still about to undergo MRI next month so too soon to tell i guess.

My neuro has me taking lamotrigine. I'm still not sure what my triggers are and i really have no clue about the auras they said we experience before having an episode so the unpredictability is what I'm afraid of bc i felt like one wrong move & i'll be having TC or SP. This sucks bc I love going out or traveling alone but now I feel like I can't do that without a companion because I don't have that sense of self-security anymore. And there's driving as well. I've been wanting to drive ever since so I bought my scooter with my hard earned money two years ago and then now I'm not allowed to drive. USELESS! 

Even worse is my company (SB) is not sure what to do with me for now. I've been working with them for almost 3 years already with no problem and now they are doubting my capabilities and I really dont want to resign yet.

One more thing i hate about this disability is like it came out of nowhere?? not a genetic condition for me. or so sudden ?? idk but I've maintained a routine of work, sleep, vape, drink, go out late nights for years just like my colleagues. heck i'm more stressed before since I was a working student but now these seizures only came recently and only happened to me (not that i wish this disability to anyone).

I got a cheap $8 moka pot from Walmart, and that could be my mistake. If so, so be it, I‚Äôll live. 

I‚Äôve made coffee with it a handful of times and it‚Äôs *amazing.* I will not go back to a drip coffee machine quite literally, ever. Even with the tiny issues I‚Äôm having, it‚Äôs great. 

The two issues I‚Äôm having are coffee grounds being at the bottom of the coffee and water being left in the bottom part (the boiler?). 

I can just not pour every drop of coffee out to avoid the grounds, I do still get *some,* but not nearly as much. I feel like there has to be a better way to do this without having to leave some coffee in the pot to avoid the grounds and also having a little bit of water left over in the bottom part. I also don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs normal or not, so maybe that‚Äôs not an issue. 

I use store bought coffee (I know, blasphemy) that aren‚Äôt ground super fine or anything like that. They‚Äôre not super coarse, not super fine. I heat the water before putting it into the bottom part of the moka pot. Fill it right below the bottom part of the valve/hole on the side. Fill the filter with coffee, not packing it in. Put the pot on medium heat with the lid open, and stare. It makes the coffee and I don‚Äôt take it off the heat until it‚Äôs done. 

I let it sit for a few minutes before pouring it, and leave a little to avoid the grounds. I haven‚Äôt had any issues with it spitting coffee at me or tasting burnt. But theres always water left in the boiler part, about 1ish, maybe slightly over 1 tablespoon. Is that normal? ",2,1740807898.0,mokapot,2,1.0,False

Specialist Daemonor, present. Corporal Syr‚Äôlieth, present. Corporal Olooris, present. She nodded at Spider.

Spider stood up and fidgeted with a silver meshed RF blocking bag, ‚Äú<Thanks for coming Colonel‚Ä¶Omnipads.>‚Äù She walked past everyone and collected everyone‚Äôs omnipad in the bag before she put it and its contents into a microwave sitting on the coffee table. ‚Äú<Ok, now that that‚Äôs handled, I have‚Ä¶ mixed news. So colonel, you know how we went back to recover the bodies of Ai, Hycia and the Major, right?>‚Äù

She nodded, it was weird to hear Spider not using anyone‚Äôs nicknames, much less using normal Vatikre instead of her usual mix of english gutterspeak she‚Äôd picked up while stationed in the European sector. 

‚Äú<Good news, I was able to clone the Major‚Äôs Omnipad and run it in a virtual machine on my laptop, the bad news is it immediately tried to phone home and delete itself. Good thing is, the laptop‚Äôs airgapped with no wireless, and the deletion program got caught by my malware suite.>‚Äù she said as she opened up the laptop and set it up on top of the microwave to show everyone the virtual environment she was running the cloned omnipad in, ‚Äú<It‚Äôs also locked to her biometrics and most of it is beyond my capability to crack. But I was able to restart it in safe mode and extract some raw files from it. It‚Äôs gibberish, mostly.>‚Äù

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶does that tell us anything?‚Äù asked Ashe as she glanced over the files while Spider opened up a couple of them, ‚Äúis there anything in it that gives us any lead whatsoever?‚Äù

‚Äú<Yeah actually.>‚Äù she said and pulled up a file labeled ‚Äòtargets‚Äô, ‚Äú<So half of this is gibberish, but I was able to make enough sense of it to get an idea of what was going on. I think the Major was Interior, and knew a lot more about what was going on in the caldera than she let on.>‚Äù

Mirarie scanned over the document, parts of it were obviously corrupted, but the file had a grainy photo that was too artifacted to make sense of, and a short string of corrupted text that was impossible to reac. Under the photo however was an ID number of ‚ÄòALPHA-01-505-A‚Äô.  She pointed at it, ‚ÄúI recognize that. It's an old chaincode for keeping track of targets worth monitoring and capturing that the Interior used prior to our official arrival on Earth‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt think there were any units still using them anymore.‚Äù

Spider nodded as she scrolled through the recovered documents, each one containing a quick bio of each member of the pod to varying degrees of corrupted text and photography. The last file was too garbled to understand and while there were several photos, they were too heavily artifacted to clearly see anything beyond loosely Rakiri like figures. ‚Äú<Looks like it. Trath, Me, Ai and Hycia were also targets, and two other people. The first and last dossiers were too corrupted to recover fully. The last one is probably Ashe based off the photos>‚Äù

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ the interior was doing interior things, and walked us right into bullshit?‚Äù Trath‚Äôyra finally said, she looked like she was mulling over something and whispered to Ashe who merely shrugged in response to the question before she spoke up.

‚ÄúSeems to be the case.‚Äù She said before she whispered back to Trath‚Äôyra.

‚Äú<There‚Äôs more. I found reference to a ‚ÄòBlue rinse‚Äô contingency in a couple files. This is something I‚Äôve only heard whispers of that the Interior does when operations go horrifically wrong.>‚Äù She took a deep breath, ‚Äú<From what I‚Äôve seen on the datanet, it‚Äôs a plasma based weapon that is designed to burn up all evidence down to the bedrock basically. I think the only reason we found the major‚Äôs Omnipad was because it was in the water.>‚Äù

Mirarie sat there staring at the documentation ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt confirm if that‚Äôs a thing‚Ä¶ But, I suspect that the Major deemed all of you expendable when she took you off to recover whatever her objective was at the crater‚Ä¶ Is there anything that clears up what that was Spider?‚Äù

‚Äú<That‚Äôs a negative Ma‚Äôam. I haven‚Äôt got a clue. If it‚Äôs in the Omnipad it‚Äôs buried deep enough I can‚Äôt find it.>‚Äù

I've built **YNAB Custom**, a **YNAB (You Need a Budget) integration for Home Assistant**, now available as a **custom HACS integration**! üéâ

### üîπ Features:

- **Accounts & Balances** ‚Äì Track your YNAB account balances in Home Assistant.
- **Budget Categories** ‚Äì Monitor assigned, activity, and available amounts for each category.
- **Category Group Summaries** ‚Äì View total spending, assignments, and balances for grouped categories (e.g., ""Bills,"" ""Groceries"").
- **API Status Sensor** ‚Äì Keep an eye on YNAB‚Äôs API health to detect any sync issues.
- **Configurable Update Intervals** ‚Äì Customize how often each budget updates.
- **Manual Refresh Service (`ynab_custom.refresh`)** ‚Äì Update data on demand.
- **‚ú® UI-Based Setup & Configuration** ‚Äì No YAML required! Set up and manage your integration directly in Home Assistant‚Äôs UI.

### üìå How It Works:

Each **YNAB budget** is treated as a **device**, with sensors for **accounts, categories, category group summaries, and API status** grouped under it. This keeps things neat and organized while allowing granular control over budget tracking.

### üîß Installation:

1. In **HACS**, go to **Integrations** ‚Üí Click the **three dots** ‚Üí **Custom repositories**.
2. Add the repository:
```
https://github.com/DeLuca21/hacs-ynab	
```
3. Set category to **Integration** and click **Add**.
4. Search for **YNAB Custom** in HACS, install it, and restart Home Assistant.
5. **Go to Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí Add Integration**, search for **YNAB Custom**, and enter your **YNAB API key**.
6. The integration will automatically create sensors for your YNAB accounts, budget categories, and summaries!

### üéõ UI-Based Configuration:

- Once installed, you can manage **YNAB Custom** directly in the Home Assistant UI.
- **Change update intervals**, manage API keys, and configure settings without touching YAML.
- Use the **""Configure"" button** in Home Assistant‚Äôs Integrations page to update settings anytime.

### üîë How to Get Your YNAB API Key:

1. Go to [**YNAB Developer Portal**](https://app.ynab.com/settings/developer).
2. Click **""New Access Token""** and give it a name.
3. Copy the generated token (it won't be shown again).
4. Paste it into Home Assistant when setting up the integration.

Would love to hear feedback, ideas, or if anyone wants to help test! Let me know what you think. üôå

While he could have simply been handed an Omnipad that had the details as a PDF or shil‚Äô equivalent, he was impressed that the Colonel, and possibly the Governess as well, had learned to appreciate the tactile, and tactical benefits of having things as a hard copy, instead of in a digital format. ‚ÄúQuite frankly Colonel, I‚Äôm surprised your people don‚Äôt have this figured out to a science‚Ä¶ having things carved up in fiefdoms still surprises me,‚Äù The human said as he sipped the coffee he had been offered.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why we need people like you on board with the idea first.‚Äù The colonel replied shrewdly, ‚ÄúI know you have a lot more sway than you pretend to.

I love our place but its pretty wonky. Stuff breaks all the time. If you use more than one electrical appliance at once (ex. coffee machine and airfryer), all the kitchen lights go out and you have to reset the breaker. 

Anyways, recently I've been getting shocked, a lot. Like way more than I have ever noticed. Whenever I touch anything connected to an outlet I get shocked, laptop, iphone. This is my second year here and this really hasn't been a problem before but now I am very much noticing it.  


It's not really anymore dry in my house than it always is (that I can tell atleast), I don't think much has changed. Our heaters run on water and are those big old wonky heaters and they do make the air pretty dry and dusty though. But it's gotten to the point where sometimes it hurts!

Could this indicate anything greater? I feel like I've heard stories about electrical outlets blowing up and burning peoples hands off over this stuff. And if it does, what would I say to a landlord or electrician to insist they check it out?

1j0ry27,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Agents/comments/1j0ry27/the_missing_piece_of_the_jigsaw_for_newbs_how_to/,The Missing Piece of the Jigsaw For Newbs - How to Actually Deploy An AI Agent,"For many newbs to agentic AI one of the mysteries is HOW and WHERE do you deploy your agents once you have built it!

You have got a kick ass workflow in n8n or an awesome agent you wrote in Python and everything works great from your computer.... But now what? How do you make this agent accessible to an end point user or a commercial customer?

In this article I want to shatter the myth and fill-in the blanks, because for 99.9% of the youtube tutorials out there they show you how to automate scheduling an appointment and updating an Airtable, but they dont show you how to actually deploy the agent.

Alright so first of all get the mind set right and think, how is someone else going to reach the trigger node? It has to be stored someone where online that is reachable anywhere right? CORRECT!

Your answer for most agents will be a cloud platform. Yes some enterprise customers will host themselves, but most will be cloud.

Now there are quite literally a million ways you can do this, so please don't reply in the comments with ""why didnt you suggest xxx, or why did you not mention xxx"". This is MY suggestion for the easiest way to deploy AI agents, im not saying its the ONLY way, I am aware there are many multiple ways of deploying. But this is meant to be a simple easy to understand deployment guide for my beloved AI newbs.

Many of you are using n8n, and you are right to, n8n is bloody amazing, even for seasoned pros like me. I can code, but why do i need to spend 3 hours coding when i can spin up an n8n workflow in a few minutes !?

So let's deploy your n8n agent on the internet so its reachable for your customer:

{ 1 } Sign up for an account at Render dot com

{ 2 } Once you are logged in you will create a new 'Resource' type - 'Web Services'

{ 3 } On the next screen, from the tabs, select 'Existing Image'

{ 4 } In the URL box type in:

    docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n

{ 5 } Now click the CONNECT button

{ 6 } Name your project on the next screen, and under region choose the region that is closest to the end point user.

{ 7 } Now choose your instance type (starter, pro etc)

{ 8 } Finally click on the 'Deploy' button at the bottom

{ 9 } Grab a coffee and wait for your new cloud instance to be spun up. Once its ready at the top of your screen in green is the URL.  
{ 10 } You will now be presented with your n8n login screen. Login, create an account and upload your json file.

Depending on how you structure your business you can then hand this account over to the customer for paying the bills and managing or you incorporate that in to your subscription model.

Your n8n AI agentic workflow is now reachable online from anywhere in the world.

Alright so for coded agents you can still do the same thing using Render¬†or we can use Replit. Replit have a great web based IDE where you can code your agent, or copy and paste in your code from another IDE and then replit have built in cloud deployment options, within a few clicks of your mouse yo u can deploy your code to a cloud instance and have it accessible on the tinternet.

So what are you waiting for my agentic newbs? DESIGN, BUILD, TEST and now DEPLOY IT!

from the moment those missionaries started coming around, and talking about nonsense‚Ä¶. i knew that everything was BS, i tried to tell my mom that i didn‚Äôt believe in any of it (mind you i was young, but i already know this wasn‚Äôt for me, but i had no choice).

all the rules that i heard like (no drinking coffee, no wearing spaghetti strap tank tops, no this, no that, etc.), everyone in the church was snobby, bratty, and judgmental since my family and i obviously didn‚Äôt fit into the ‚Äúnormal stereotype mormon family‚Äù. i remember going to all the classes after the church sermon & hating everything single aspect & absolutely just wanted to LEAVE‚Ä¶ i had no clue what they would talk about, i didn‚Äôt read the book, or care for their beliefs (im not religious, but i am spiritual & i always have been) 

i didn‚Äôt care for the rules, my parents didn‚Äôt either, we just kept doing our thing‚Ä¶. why did my parents agree to joining LDS? god knows, but i absolutely HATED lds church and everything about it. i knew from the jump it they were giving cult-y vibes. 

over a decade later, we haven‚Äôt gone to church, none of us as ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with any members, we don‚Äôt even BAT an eye‚Ä¶. but they have followed us from wherever we moved.

tltr: 
STILL TO THIS DAY, they would knock unannounced. i‚Äôm straight up, blunt, and i have told them many times not to come anymore cus nobody has time to sit and chitchat.

first off, it‚Äôs rude to just come unannounced. in the bay area, we busy bodies, we hustle. my parents work all day & im college, siblings at school‚Ä¶. so like yeah, no don‚Äôt come knocking on my door. 

anyway, long story short. i hate that they still come knocking & i tell them rudely to go away, cus they didn‚Äôt listen when i said it nicely the first time.

I‚Äôve been trying to break into a niche industry (30-40 jobs in a city with a population of 3 million) for a while now. I‚Äôm in my late 20s, and though it took me some time to decide what I wanted to do with my life, I have finished my degree and completed two internships. I‚Äôm working part-time in a related field and freelancing while searching for a full-time job in the niche industry. I‚Äôm willing to move for the right job, but I‚Äôd rather stay close to home ‚Äî so I was stoked last summer when I got an interview for one of the very few entry-level jobs available in my city! I ultimately didn‚Äôt get it, but the interview went well enough they encouraged me to apply the next time they had an opening.

Then an acquaintance who works at the company called me up and asked if I wanted to get coffee. I figured she‚Äôd offer me tips on how to do better next time. Instead, she told me to give up on ever being hired there ‚Äî turns out, a girl I had gone to high school with is a real rock star at this company, and she threatened to resign when it looked like I was about to be offered a job. (I hadn‚Äôt realized it was her because her married name is different.) I‚Äôll be honest ‚Äî I wasn‚Äôt a very nice person back then, and I probably was pretty awful to this girl. I looked my former classmate up, and her resume really is incredible. She graduated from college early and has awards people who‚Äôve worked in our industry twice as long haven‚Äôt won. Her public-facing work is top-notch. I‚Äôm guessing she‚Äôs the kind of employee a manager wants to keep around.

My acquaintance‚Äôs prediction appears to be true: I didn‚Äôt get an interview for a new position at the company that would‚Äôve been an even better fit than the one I‚Äôd interviewed for. When I asked why, I was told a staffer had raised some concerns and the company would not be moving forward with my candidacy. I‚Äôm heartbroken. I worked so hard for so long to get the training required for this type of work, and I don‚Äôt think I deserve to be blacklisted for something I said when I was 17. I have my former classmate‚Äôs work email. Should I beg for forgiveness?

**Editor‚Äôs note: below are OOP‚Äôs comments that will help provide more context**

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** When OP said she ‚Äúprobably was pretty awful‚Äù to the person, it suggested she doesn‚Äôt fully remember what she did to her I read it to mean she remembers her as someone from school but not the extent of it. This seems to happen with some bullies, what seems like inconsequential childhood stuff to them lingers with their victims for years. I got a Facebook message from someone once who was excited to reconnect with me. He remembered me as a supportive friend and spoke fondly of the times we spent together- meanwhile I remember him as the bully I had nightmares about until my 20s.

I don‚Äôt think OP should apologise unless they can actually remember the details because ‚ÄúI was probably pretty mean to you‚Äù is going to sound like CYA even if they do wait a year or two to reapply. Personally there are few circumstances where I would work directly with one of my bullies and I have moved departments to get away from them in the past.

> **OOP:** Here‚Äôs what happened: I‚Äôd known this girl since elementary school and had mutual friends in common in middle schools. We started hanging out a lot our sophomore year because my family moved in across the street. She started to call me her best friend, even though I didn‚Äôt consider her mine. She also liked a boy in our friend group that I started dating. That made it really awkward, so I decided I didn‚Äôt want to be friends with her anymore. It wasn‚Äôt my intention to cut her out of the friend group, but that‚Äôs what happened. My understanding is she ended up feeling very isolated and alone for the rest of high school. I realize now I could‚Äôve handled it better.
> 
> The last I heard was she was working two states away, and remembering her from back then, she always said she wanted to get the hell out of our city. So it didn‚Äôt occur to me that the Lauren Johnson I saw on the staff page could be the Lauren Pumpernickel I knew in high school.

**Commenter 2:** Maybe I‚Äôm reading the letter wrong, but I didn‚Äôt get the impression the OP was applying for a job that was on par in title, responsibility, or pay as the former classmate. I thought it was definitely a more entry-level job but at the same company.

> **OOP:** I finally finished my B.A at 26 and completed a three-month and six-month internship. I‚Äôve been freelancing in an adjacent industry for about a year and a half. I know it took me longer than I should‚Äôve to get where I‚Äôm at. The positions I‚Äôve applied for have been entry-level. Neither would have required me to work directly with Rock Star, based on what I know of the organization.
> 
> Rock Star graduated from college in three years, worked for a few years in a different adjacent field for two years, then has been doing this for the last six. She is in the same job category as people who‚Äôve been there much longer.

**Commenter 3:** Yeah. Social ostracization is really hard on people. It‚Äôs why solitary confinement is considered torture by the UN and why in biblical times it was the worst punishment you could mete out on an unrepentant sinner. Being frozen out by not just one person but your entire social group? Ouch. I really feel for Rock Star now.

> **OOP:** I‚Äôm really, really trying to be self-reflective here. I‚Äôm sure I did make comments like, ‚ÄúUgh, Rock Star. She‚Äôs SO annoying. Let‚Äôs not invite her.‚Äù I know my mom asked her mom (we were neighbors) if she was having a graduation party our senior year, and Rock Star‚Äôs mom said, ‚ÄúRock Star doesn‚Äôt want one because she doesn‚Äôt think anyone will come.‚Äù
> 
> I cringe when I hear that now because, well, they probably wouldn‚Äôt have.

**Commenter 4:** Commenter: Whoa, I could only read the first hundred or so comments before I realized something seemed off‚Äì AAM is the one who used the term ‚Äúbully, ‚Äù the OP did not; instead, the phrase used was ‚Äúnot very nice.‚Äù There were plenty of people who were ‚Äúnot very nice‚Äù to me in high school, but never bullied me. And reading the OP‚Äôs description of what actually happened above, I have to say.. that doesn‚Äôt sound like bullying, although I certainly agree it was unkind. But again.. I was a weirdo in high school and there were plenty of people who weren‚Äôt always nice to me, but that doesn‚Äôt make them bullies. Of course, there were probably people that *I* was mean to because I was 16 with raging hormones, but I wouldn‚Äôt think about THAT until someone mentioned it to me (in a situation like this, perhaps).

I am sure there are many people who are commenting who had terrible experiences with bullies.. but there is a lot of projection here. If I were the OP, I‚Äôd maybe ask some friends or other high school classmates (with Facebook, surely there are some!) and ask for an honest opinion on how horrible they were. I guess I feel like people are jumping to a lot of conclusions based on their own personal experiences.

> **OOP:** I used ‚Äúbully‚Äù in the subject of my email because that is apparently the term Rock Star used when she shot down my candidacy. According to the acquaintance, the language she used was along the lines of, ‚ÄúI would be very uncomfortable if you hired Kfox for the producer job. She was a bully in high school; I would move on if I had to see her every day.‚Äù

**Commenter 5:** What jumps out at me is OP saying the rockstar called OP her best friend, but rockstar wasn‚Äôt OP‚Äôs best friend. There was a very unpopular girl in my class who would glom onto people and try to push the relationship between them into a high degree of intimacy immediately. It caused a lot of problems for her. With some people, it led to real bullying. But even if you weren‚Äôt a bully ‚Äî if you were someone who would otherwise have been civil and reasonably kind (because I don‚Äôt think anyone is a bully for NOT wanting to be best friends with someone ‚Äî however, you do have to be civil), she would push and cling so much that it was overwhelming and extremely off putting and there didn‚Äôt seem to be a middle option of being friendly/civil at school ‚Äî either you ignored her/avoided her completely or you were BEST FRIENDS ALL THE TIME and had to be with her for EVERYTHING to the exclusion of any other friends you might have had. Not an easy situation for an awkward teenager to deal with tactfully while still maintaining some boundaries.

So with that perspective ‚Äî I could completely see this being a situation where OP wasn‚Äôt a bully, but just didn‚Äôt accept the level of friendship that the rockstar wanted, and the way she dealt with it was by pushing away from rockstar ‚Äî not necessarily by doing terrible things but just not inviting her along or avoiding her if she was the sort who invited herself along to everything ‚Äî and if the friend group was OPs friend group that rockstar had hooked into by virtue of her friendship with OP, then I don‚Äôt find it surprising that once OP started to put some distance between her and rockstar, that the group did so as well.

Obviously, I don‚Äôt know, so of course there could have been social bullying as well, but I think it‚Äôs unfair to OP to assume that she must have been a really horrible bully to rockstar, especially if she can‚Äôt remember the horrible things she did.

Regardless of what the mix was, rockstar remembers it as bullying, so I think OP is out of luck for that company.

> **OOP:** It wasn‚Äôt this bad. More, Rock Star was a little socially inept, talked a lot about books none of us had read, didn‚Äôt wear makeup, didn‚Äôt listen to music (I‚Äôm really, really into music), generally was a little weird, but she wasn‚Äôt the most unpopular girl at school and I wasn‚Äôt embarrassed to be seen with her.
> 
> It‚Äôs kind of strange now because she has a very polished public persona and it hardly even seems like the same person.

[Update](https://www.askamanager.org/2017/12/update-i-didnt-get-a-job-because-i-was-a-bully-in-high-school.html): **December 13, 2017 (7.5 months later)** 

I know you didn‚Äôt solicit an update, but I felt compelled to send one. I‚Äôd written you in the spring because I was having trouble breaking into a niche industry in which a high school classmate I‚Äôd bullied was a rock star. I wanted to know if you thought apologizing would help me get a job.

At the advice of your readers, I did delete the draft of an apology email I‚Äôd had sitting in my inbox for some time. I applied for one more job with Rock Star‚Äôs company, and when I didn‚Äôt hear back, I decided it was really and truly time to look elsewhere. I found a shop in a town seven hours away that was desperate to hire someone for a paid 9-month fellowship that started in June because the candidate they‚Äôd originally extended an offer to found a full-time, permanent position. I said goodbye to my boyfriend, packed up my car and two cats, and drove to a town I‚Äôd never been to.

And I hated it. Not the work. I actually loved the work, but the town sucked. Being away from my boyfriend and my family sucked. Not being able to make friends sucked (everyone else my age was married with two kids already). I called my boyfriend every night crying. He was supposed to come visit me over Labor Day but cancelled at the last minute because he had to work. Seeing how bummed I was, a coworker offered to swap shifts with me so I could make the trip home for the long weekend. I hopped into my car after work on Friday and drove all evening, arriving at the place I‚Äôd been sharing with my boyfriend before I moved a little after 1 a.m. Well, you probably know where this was going. He was cheating on me. I was devastated. I spent the rest of the night sobbing on my sister‚Äôs couch and drove back to where I was working the next morning.

Except I couldn‚Äôt make myself get out of bed on Tuesday. Or Wednesday. Or Thursday. I was fired after my third no call no show.

I tried to get the part-time job I‚Äôd had before moving for the fellowship back (they‚Äôd said come back anytime), but they‚Äôd found someone who was faster and more efficient than I‚Äôd been. Unable to afford a place on my own, I had to move back in with my parents. Not sure what else to do, I sent another desperate application to Rock Star‚Äôs shop. In an effort to cheer me up, my sister and my friends took me out for a nice dinner for my birthday at the end of September. This is where it goes from bad to worse. I drank too much wine at dinner and got pretty weepy. I excused myself from the table to try to put myself together ‚Ä¶ and ran into Rock Star and her husband celebrating their anniversary on the way to the bathroom.

I ended up yelling/crying at her that she‚Äôd ruined my life. I was asked to leave to leave and told I wasn‚Äôt welcome back.

That was Saturday night. I spent Sunday hungover in bed, trying to figure out how to clean up the mess I made. On Monday morning, Rock Star‚Äôs manager (the one hiring for the job I‚Äôd applied for) emailed me to let me know I‚Äôd been removed from the candidate pool. She advised me that I would not be considered for future positions at their shop ‚Ä¶ or any other in the network. That afternoon, without mentioning me or what happened at the restaurant over the weekend, Rock Star tweeted a long thread about how she‚Äôd been bullied in high school and she wishes teenagers would realize that high school ends and it does get better. She also tweeted out links to local mental health resources and the National Suicide hotline that were liked/retweeted many, many times.

So, just to recap, no job, no boyfriend, no money, no hope of ever breaking into the industry I spent five years preparing to enter. It‚Äôs hard not to feel like some of this is Rock Star‚Äôs fault, especially given how she rubbed salt in the wound after my whole world had come crashing down.

**Editor's Note: Alison shared OOP's comment to the update post**

**Additional Information from OOP:**

> **OOP:** Thanks for posting my update. I‚Äôve been reading the comments, but I can‚Äôt find much energy to respond to them. Things haven‚Äôt gotten much better for me. I‚Äôm currently staying with my sister, but I have to move out in January (long story, but she‚Äôs having a baby and ‚Äúneeds her guestroom back‚Äù), and I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm going to do then. I probably do need therapy, but I can‚Äôt afford it.
> 
> I reached out to an old high school friend to ask if what I did to Rock Star was really that bad. She replied, ‚ÄúUm, you really weren‚Äôt great to her.‚Äù I prodded and found out that Rock Star actually ran away from home for a while and lived with her sister in another city to get away from me but came back to play on a school team.
> 
> I really am trying to let my resentment of my old classmate go, but it‚Äôs hard. I keep telling myself to unfollow her on Twitter, but as some of the comments guessed, she has a few thousand followers and is often retweeted. She is a prominent voice in this community. I got a bit of a reprieve last month because she went on vacation and wasn‚Äôt posting as frequently, but mostly it reminded me I‚Äôve never had a job with paid vacation before.
> 
> I feel like our industry really is as niche as I‚Äôve described. BTW, I do exist. I know a couple of comments questioned whether anyone could screw up this badly. The answer is yes, someone can. I changed some details when I wrote you to protect her/my identity, but I assure you, I have the receipts.

I grew up in a dysfunctional home. Both my parents died by the time I was 10. I was obese for most of my life which did not help in my growing years and was made to feel like a burden and had a lot of resentment shown to me just for my existence. I did not have many of the same experiences that teenagers had growing up. I had no affection or love shown to me. No boyfriends or anything of that sort. When I turned 18, I developed an eating disorder, lost half my body weight and began to feel good about myself. I dressed how I wanted, partied, had friends etc etc. All the while, I just wanted somebody to love me the way I could love them. 

I met and married my husband in my twenties. When I met him, I was at a low point in my life because I had just had my heart broken by someone and it made me feel worthless. My husband walked in and told all the things I needed to hear and we were together for a good 3 years before getting married. We became parents to two beautiful children and I moved to where he was from. I had no qualms about migrating since I didn't consider that I was leaving much behind since I didn't really have much of a family anyway. 

When I moved to this other country 13 years ago, I had no money, no real skills, no drivers license and relied completely on my husband. He never really has a set job because he would blame it on his epilepsy (he doesn't have big seizures, but he gets silent ones and his memory gets impacted. He also has trouble with gripping things because he has hand tremors that he gets embarrassed by) for a good long time, I would sit and empathize with his condition and accept that there are certain jobs that he is just unable to do. Yet, I would still try to help him find ways to work around it. Intellectually he is very smart and can solve math questions before you finish asking them. He is also very analytical and would be amazing in critical thinking jobs. However, whenever me or his other family members try coaxing him to work, he always gets super defensive and is quick to fight back on why he is unable to do things and gets really angry when people share links to jobs and things. 

In the 13 yrs since I've been here, I've gone and learnt a skill and get employed. I still don't drive because he won't let me and he manages our finances because it's just easier if he does it (according to him) so from our rent, bills, and all our spending money, he is managing it. He gets benefits payment for being a parent and he also gets student payments for a course he's studying. I get paid my wages every fortnight and I give him nearly all of it so that he can use it to pay for the essentials. 

I tuck a small amount away in my own personal savings and recently I turned 40. I used my personal savings to book us all a trip away and I bought myself a luxury wallet that I saved for. I figured that everything I have ever wanted or got, I have had to earn it myself. True enough, we went for our little trip away for my bday and the whole time he was sitting there with his banking app doing the budgeting and telling us what we could and couldn't spend on. Eg: for my bday dinner I booked a nice restaurant facing the beach and I told him this in advance, showing him the menu and costs and how special I want this night to be. At the restaurant, he was trying to tell me how much more value I would get from getting a beer instead of a wine or should we share a jug of cocktails since it would be cheaper etc etc. This was starting to irk me because I just wanted to spend my 40th without any money worries and he had assured me that things would be fine. 

When we got back home after our holiday, I needed to do the groceries and he was trying to tell me that we needed to do things on the cheap. I said to him, what's cheap to me and what's cheap to u is different, so why don't u just tell me how much I can spend in the supermarket and I will stick to that amount? I thought I was being reasonable but he went off on a rant, saying that I had a problem because things are never enough and I don't understand what budgeting is and I just want to keep spending money. If I was given a million I would say why am I not getting 2 million. 

All of this is untrue, and I can't get get mad because I know this is untrue. I said that to him and basically said, 'its like you calling me purple, I know for a fact I'm not purple so you insisting on that isn't changing the fact that it is simply not true' I just feel like it's pathetic that I am 40 and I still can't do the bloody groceries and afford basic things because I chose to go on a holiday for my bday. I am not asking for much, I work so hard and earn every penny for my family. Him and the kids did not buy me a present this year or last. When I mention it, he paints me out to be a high maintenance queen who never seems to have enough. 

I just feel like I am stuck in a marriage with someone who has no intention to better themselves for the sake of them or their kids. I am so tired of hearing him talk about all the things he will do when he has money, he even said to me last year that this is the year we finally eat. And now I'm hearing that he won't be till after April or May at least because this or that is happening with this course he is studying. But I've been hearing this for as long as I have known him. He has never had a job for longer then a year or two. He bought a small coffee roaster and roasted some beans for people and will make a few hundred bucks here and there and all of a sudden he called himself a coffee roaster that's been doing it for 10 years, but no real progression. 

I'm so tired of always having to be my own hype person. I don't care what he does for a job. Just do something. I hate feeling like I'm having to be the one that works hard and gets the least. Last year we went on holiday and his flex is talking about it's his money cos he got a scholarship amount for his uni course. He gets into a heated argument with me when I say to him that he needs to do more and work. He tells me I don't respect him and that in my core I think he is a bum. It's true, I can't even hide it anymore. I try to be respectful in front of my kids but I hate being married to him. I can't leave, I have nowhere to go. He won't let me leave as much as I have said I wanted to. I've told him, the only way I will be able to leave is in a body bag because I am trapped. 

I don't know what I am meant to do. ",1,1740805264.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Will try to keep minor details brief, and explain the important bits. Going to refer to my friend as G. 

G had been dating my Husband‚Äôs best friend for several years. And we had all hung out as a group plenty of times. But that was the only time we talked, I never tried to engage further. But I finally took the plunge last year, I figured we had been hanging out enough that why not try to get to know her better? I took it slow, and tried to just go out to coffee and just have girl talk. Last spring, her and her bf took a break. And it honestly made her an absolute mess. She was very distraught and anxious, often texting me in times of panic that he was going to move on from her, etc. and I was there for her. She was at my house multiple times a week and we were happy to have her. She was still our friend and it was rough for her. We had some one on one hangs from time to time and all she talked about was her relationship and it got kind of old but I never said anything because I thought this is what friends are for, right? To be there when needed. 

Well I guess I was wrong, because when the coin flipped everything changed. My husband and I are going through a bit of a rough patch in trying to find each other and ourselves again, and I was talking to her about it and would often vent to her about it. She stopped answering texts and I noticed she was ignoring me when I‚Äôd see her in public, and making excuses why her and her bf (back together at this point) couldn‚Äôt hang out. So I stopped talking to her, gave space, because I felt used by her because I was there for her for months, and I try to open up and I‚Äôm met with a door? Fine, whatever. So eventually we start talking again and unbeknownst to me, she did NOT want me venting to her about my relationship. I‚Äôll admit now that I was being selfish, but I was also in a dark place. But she never communicated to me it was a problem, just shut me out. I cried to my husband multiple times about not knowing what I did wrong to make her suddenly hate me. 

Unfortunately, since it was never communicated by her that it was an issue, I did it again. I vented and she finally told me that hey, we can‚Äôt hang out anymore. I can‚Äôt be this for you. I feel like a therapist. And sure, I can recognize after hindsight that yeah, she‚Äôs not my therapist, and no, I shouldn‚Äôt use her for that. Where‚Äôs the line between being there for each other and abusing that? If she had just told me the first time that it wasn‚Äôt okay, instead of leaving me wondering what I did wrong, it probably wouldn‚Äôt have happened again. So I give her space, for about 3-4 months. She gets engaged and I‚Äôm thrilled! Been waiting for them to do so since they are both such good friends of mine. So I ask her if we can meet for coffee. And I ask again, and again, I ask in person, in text, and she never responded to the texts.

I start to get the gist that maybe, she doesn‚Äôt want to be friends anymore. Maybe she‚Äôs lying to my face about not wanting to hang out since she‚Äôs continuing to ignore me. Finally, she responds and basically tells me in a roundabout way that she doesn‚Äôt want to be friends anymore. I‚Äôm crushed y‚Äôall. I thought I finally made a good friend. I apologized, I feel terrible for being tunnel visioned and treating her like that, but am I not crazy in thinking she did the same thing? Using me as help and therapy to get through her break with her bf? That‚Äôs honestly when we were closest. Do I just have a skewed and wrong view of what friendships should look like? How do I move forward from here? I miss her. I love her and we‚Äôve been good casual friends for several years before this. I‚Äôm missing out on hearing about her wedding plans and being apart of this next phase of life with her because of a misjudgment on my part. TIA. 

TL;DR: my friend told me that her ‚Äúfriendships are headed in a different direction‚Äù and cutting me out of her life due to a misjudgment of what friends are for or what kind of friend she wanted to be, and I‚Äôm sad about the next phase of our lives that I‚Äôm going to miss out on with her.

Thunder crashed as I grabbed my fedora and hit the door. I could find out more in the dives and speakeasies. It wasn‚Äôt easy, though. Just mentioning The Rook made faces go white. Nobody would talk. Not even my threats loosened their lips. I cursed Johnny under my breath. He was my partner until a few weeks ago when he‚Äôd abandoned his post. Poor kid couldn‚Äôt even make it a year on the job before the city‚Äôs rot got to him. Now I had a double load of work, and it was piling up. I needed answers quick.

Finally, a back alley drunk gave me a tip in exchange for a smoke. ‚ÄúSlaughterhouse,‚Äù he whispered maniacally.

The slaughterhouse was a dark stain, even for this city. One guard stood out front, a young gun who looked more suited for a jazz band than a life of crime. I got the drop on him. ‚ÄúTake me to The Rook, kid.‚Äù He started to object but a little persuasion from my fist and a gun to his ribs made him eager to cooperate. He led me inside. The stench was overwhelming, a sickly mix of rust and rot that made the black coffee in my gut have second thoughts. Low growls echoed through the vast ruined space. My guide pointed toward the shadows and I saw it‚Äîa feral figure, tearing into something with rabid ferocity.

""What is it?"" I growled. He sang like a canary.

‚ÄúHe was gonna talk, so they‚Ä¶ they tortured him,‚Äù he stammered. ‚ÄúInjected some kinda chemical. Electrocuted him too. Turned him into a monster.‚Äù

It must‚Äôve heard us. Its head snapped around, fixing its glowing yellow eyes on us. As It stood, my flashlight beam caught a glint of metal. It was badge. A rookie badge. A bolt of fear sucker punched me in the chest. I moved the light up to its face. ‚ÄúJohnny?‚Äù Before my brain could catch up with my eyes, he charged, howling with rage as he came. The half-human sound was too much for my captive's bladder.

""Sorry Johnny,"" I whispered. I raised my Peacemaker and fired.

Cautiously we approached the body. Rage and bile mingled in my throat as I looked over my partner‚Äôs grotesque husk. I‚Äôd killed one monster, but a new one clawed its way out of me in the dark. The mob had crossed a line. This kind of brutality could not, would not go unpunished. I‚Äôd hunt every last mob rat, gut ‚Äòem slow, paint the streets red with their blood and stack their carcasses ‚Äòtil the city stank of justice.

8.5 years ago, Gary was doing what he loved best in life; on a road trip to watch Little Leaguers play baseball, when he became ill.  

He was admitted to Long Beach Community Hospital, an antiquated institution on its 10th and final reincarnation before it was voted as the ‚Äúmost likely place in Southern California to host an earthquake epicenter‚Äù. 

But I‚Äôll never degrade the care he got there literally saving his life. 

Between then and now, there have been many good times watching baseball, socializing with friends, spending quality time with the 
soon-to-fly grandsons, living our best life. But there were also periods of surgeries, recoveries. 

He bounced back, but it took a little piece of him each time. 

We knew it would take one last bounce back before it took the last piece of him. 

Now was the time. 

Again, I‚Äôll never say a bad thing about the also archaic St. Mary‚Äôs Hospital.  No, I will say one bad thing‚Ä¶.they have the worst cafeteria in the history of cafeterias. 

They tried their best to make him all better.  At day 20, after one minor surgery, lots of PT efforts, he was just not improving and not a viable candidate for rehab, or even the step below a hospital environment, acute rehab.  

After 2 round table family meetings with a hospice team, we signed the home care papers. Within a few hours and with the invaluable help of our grandsons rearranging everything, meeting the equipment delivery truck, setting everything up, we brought him to the hospital wing of our home. It was a large corner of the living room where he could hear activity, he could hear ‚ÄúFriends,‚Äù I could talk to him.  Drugs, supplies, continued to arrive daily. 

A few words about the business of hospice. 

Having a fascination with marketing and being a student my whole career, I found the ‚Äúbranding‚Äù and ‚Äúselling‚Äù of hospice most interesting. 

It is a business, but a very delicate business that needs the proper set up, proper words, and reassurances from the minute the ‚Äúsale‚Äù is made through the ‚Äútransition‚Äù.  That was one of the magic safe words. The team was very persuasive on how to make our tight knit family accept the premise. They used the ‚ÄúH‚Äù word as little as possible, but always followed it with the optimistic ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt mean the patient can‚Äôt live for a long time yet‚Äù.  The centerpiece of the pitch was the goal to make to the patient as comfortable and calm and pain free as possible.  They continued reinforcing that goal.  They answered all our questions honestly, calmly and used their inside voices.  Being home care virgins, we had a lot of questions including ‚Äúdo we have a choice of companies here?‚Äù  But at the end of the day, we signed the papers. 

For the first hours, we had a 24 hour training nurse followed by another 24 hour nurse. Ironically they were both boy RN‚Äôs, both fitfully sleeping on the couch. A side note, the first one wore cologne so strong, it penetrated the very core of the bed/couch and a month later Susan and I still caught whiffs of it when there was a breeze!  

But they both taught me how to give him nourishment via his feeding tube, they sorted his myriad of drugs with an endless supply of labeled Ziplocks.  I had an am/pm drug bag, am only, pm only, ‚Äúcomfort drugs‚Äù (which included morphine and Norco) bag. We gave them the nickname ‚ÄúMr. Ziplock‚Äù. They taught me the best way to change his bedding, underwear, gowns. I never had the desire to master those tasks. 

We were assigned a CNA to come in to wash him, shampoo, shave, trim his nails, change him and the bedding. She even took out all the byproduct trash out.   She was fast, efficient and got ‚Äòer done often in 20 minutes. At first, it was every other weekday, but with our RN advocating for us, Maria was approved to come Monday through Friday. The RN came 2-3 times a week to do nurse-y stuff.  Check for wounds, see what supplies, drugs we needed, address any of my concerns. God bless Jaxx and Maria and every single person who chooses this for a career. 

I was admittedly shocked at the ease to get whatever I requested. More morphine‚Ä¶.sure‚Ä¶.more bed pads, sure‚Ä¶.more underwear, nutrition, syringes, wipes‚Ä¶..they were delivered within hours!  Literally I got a knock on the door at 11 pm, in the pouring rain, and received a drug delivery.

The company also had 24/7 support.  We had an issue one night that freaked me out, kept me awake and both of us were agitated. Finally at 5am, I called the support line and talked to a nurse. In the end I didn‚Äôt need it, but a nurse could have been here within 30 minutes.  But the phone nurse calmed me down, talked me through the situation, told me she was proud of me over and over and then only when I was comfortable, we hung up with a follow up call the next day. 

Our entire family had portals to social services and spiritual services. We got a call from a non-denominational pastor encouraging us to call him anytime for guidance and comfort. 

One thing that struck me as part of his care is that we continued to give him all the medications he taken for years.  Does he need cholesterol meds now?  No, but because it was in his routine regime, we continued. Does he need his daily eyedrops to slow glaucoma?  Probably not, but it‚Äôs still part of his routine. We did go over his drugs at one point, and we stopped a lot.  But I wanted him to stay on his steroid, so sure, we‚Äôll keep him on it. 

But here‚Äôs a thing. I understand, I get it, Gary was #1. It was about him. Day and Night. But I was becoming increasingly aware, the whole service was almost equally concerned about how I was doing.  It wasn‚Äôt for several weeks that it sunk in they were helping me, they were doing what they could to make it easier on/for me.  I‚Äôm sure there are daily reports being reviewed and changes made. The changed schedule of the wash CNA was an example of behind the scene decisions. It was in MY best interest to have someone every weekday.  Not protocol, but special approved circumstances where they saw a need.  

Gary was still very strong, and despite Maria tossing him hither and yon to clean, change, I wasn‚Äôt able to manhandle him like she‚Äôs trained to do (and I didn‚Äôt want to upset or hurt him) so I was in need of an evening and weekend helper.  I recalled Susan had been friends with Susie since the 4th grade graduating from high school together. They had kept up on FB but they crossed paths again at a Christmas ‚Äò23 party. (You remember that memorable party that I almost tripped and wiped out the entire cookie exchange table with hundreds of cookies!). I remembered she did private home health care and she lived almost across the street. We arranged a meeting and she agreed to be ‚Äúon call‚Äù more or less for evening and weekend changes .  Her going rate at $18/hr. was beyond my expectations.  We settled into a routine, we agreed to being flexible, but she was a Godsend.  She was incredibly reliable, and together we got the job done.  

Being a homebody, I didn‚Äôt mind the weeks of not leaving home. I knitted, read, cooked shared meals, but most importantly I got a few bonus hours/days/weeks with Gary.  Susan stopped by most days after work always asking what I need, what she can pick up for me. 

I will never ever be able to express my gratitude or repay the kindness, support, love and prayers all of our friends and neighbors have shown, near and far.  Local friends often didn‚Äôt ask, just showed up with coffee, food, flowers.  I always appreciated the gestures, and the visit!  I chose to believe Gary heard them, and said a silent thank you. 

Our far away friends and family were continually asking what they could do, sharing, encouraging, sympathizing, sending cards, and arranging meals. 

There really aren‚Äôt enough words or time to thank Susan and her family.  They gave us their all every minute of every day.  

It‚Äôs a journey, despite our best efforts, many will face. I will take joy if  anyone is comforted or educated by our experience.

At the start of January I was 82kg & 16% BF

Today I am 77kg & 11% BF (weight has been stable for \~3 weeks)

In 2 x months I have seen incredible progress with a ketogenic diet and following the principles of Ketogains protocol. I have lost 5% bodyfat, with no appreciable loss in lean body mass, or any loss in strength or performance. I have sparingly used TKD for very hard workouts (i.e. racing a 5km in 19mins), while avoiding carbs for long slower aerobic efforts and equally avoided carbs for pure strength and power lifting sessions (squats / deadlift / bench etc). Love the pre-workout coffee, and I do closely follow the protein targets. Although, counting macros is becoming less of a priority for me, as appetite and energy regulation feels very natural (i.e. no energy dips, and I am learning to listen to, & trust, hunger signals).

I am looking for advice on transitioning to the Maintenance phase...

* What is different in the Maintenance phase vs a Fat loss phase?
* Is there anything to watch out for / potential stumbling blocks in the Maintenance phase?
* I do feel pretty comfortable at this weight / bodyfat%, but it has me wondering if I could comfortably sit at a single-digit bodyfat%. How much harder is it to push down the BF%, and are there signs if you are pushing too far?",0,1740804236.0,ketogains,0,0.5,False

A guy invites me to hang out and I find him annoying.,"So I'm lonely all the time in uni because I have no friends. I wonder why no one ever wants to talk to me (even though I go home immediately after class every day and never say hi lol). 

But my parents did raise me to be polite to workers, so even if I'm terrified to engage with my peers, I can have superficial conversations with cleaning ladies, cashiers, etc.

So there's this guy that checks bags in the entrance of the library, and I always say hi to him, but I realized that he has tried to get closer to me even if I never planned to be his friend. 

He asked for my number and I gave it to him even if I didn't care for it. Then he invited me to drink coffee and I just said ""oh yeah, it'd be nice someday"". 

I stopped going to the library and didn't see him for half a year. Then he contacted me AGAIN, and asked me to drink coffee AGAIN. Not only that, but he also invited me to his house, which is like five hours away from my house, and told me that we could even go to the beach if I wanted. 

The beach thing really annoyed me, as I wouldn't even go with someone I actually like, and I just felt like he was being too pushy. 

Anyways, I know I need friends, and this guy is actually really kind and respectful. Just pushy. I wonder if maybe I have a warped perspective and this is just an innocent guy being nice to a loser with no friends.

I believe he's in his mid twenties at least, but he may be older as he texts like a millennial. I just keep thinking that he may have ulterior motives since I'm a 19 year old woman and he's older than me.

Still, I believe this may just be my usual disdain towards people, and I don't know if I should give him a chance. At least to go for the coffee, even if I honestly find it like a chore I'm being pushed into and I don't care about him.

I just don't understand why he would want to hang out when he doesn't know anything about me and we don't share any interests.",7,1740803973.0,AvPD,3,0.9,False

With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Well, he had some time to kill to sober up. And last he checked, AA meetings had free coffee. Woudn't hurt to sober up a bit either.

The stairs creaked under his weight as he made his way down to the church basement. He nearly fell through the door into a meeting already underway.

""Welcome, brother,"" said a man in a knit sweater, his clerical collar just visible. ""Come have a seat.""

Joe hesitated, then took a chair. He might as well ride this out.

""Jane was just about to share,"" the priest said.

Jane sniffled. ""When Kenny and I drank, we always fought. One night, instead of his fists, he hit me with a lamp. The glass cut my throat, and I bled out on the spot.""

Joe waited for a laugh, a punchline. The others only nodded in solemn understanding.

""David, your turn,"" said the priest.

David cleared his throat. ""I used to drink from the slop bucket at my friend‚Äôs bar. Every spilled drink, every cigarette butt, straight down. One night, I finished the whole thing. Pain shot through my arm, and when the paramedics came, I was dead on arrival.""

Joe sat forward. ""Hold on. You aren‚Äôt dead if you‚Äôre sitting right here.""

Everyone turned to him. Their faces were full of pity. A chill ran down Joe‚Äôs spine.

The priest sighed. ""I‚Äôll go next."" He stared at the stained linoleum. ""It was late. I had just given last rites to a seven-year-old leukemia patient. The scotch didn‚Äôt help. By midnight, I had a shotgun in my mouth.""

Joe shot to his feet, his chair clattering behind him. ""I‚Äôm out of here.""

""That‚Äôs alright,"" the priest said. ""Stay on your path, and you‚Äôll be sharing your story in no time.""

Joe's vision blurred. The floor tilted under his feet.

Pain.

He gasped awake, body screaming, lungs thick with something metallic. Bright lights burned his eyes. Machines beeped all around him.

A nurse appeared and hurried out the door. A moment later, a police officer walked in and sat beside the bed.

""You know where you are?"" he asked.

Joe groaned. ""No.""

The cop exhaled through his nose. ""You ran straight into a power pole. You reek of alcohol. You‚Äôre lucky you didn‚Äôt kill anyone.""

Joe swallowed, throat raw. He turned his head and froze.

On the bedside table, next to a foam cup of water, sat a newcomer coin.

Reasoning: general health and well being, want to feel more comfortable within myself and be more confident in my body.

Things I am doing: I used to drink a lot of sugary drinks, 2 full sugar monsters, sugary soft drink and coffee every day, so i‚Äôve completely stopped that. I don‚Äôt consume much sugar besides what‚Äôs in the food I eat. I used to consume a lot of takeaway food (at least 3 nights a week) I‚Äôve stopped that and am watching what I eat and have definitely been consuming less food. I still eat normal-ish things but i‚Äôve been focusing on not consuming copious amounts of junk, usually just something light for breakfast and a meal for dinner which we‚Äôve been cooking. I‚Äôve been drinking a lot of water, started taking vitamin d3 supplements because i was pretty deficient in that, a couple extra supplements too. I feel generally healthy. Have been walking a lot whereas i was always sitting or laying prior to this. I do 30 minutes of walking at least once a day, there‚Äôs a walking track near my house so it‚Äôs convenient. i have been lifting weights and using an exercise bike in between the walking. all round just have been more active, eating less, eating less crap.

Will update in around a month or 2 with any progress that i‚Äôve made.

First of all, the instructions weren't clear or just not elaborate enough. Like I had to figure out how to properly steam the milk for an hour. When i finally learned how to do it properly, i quit the game because i got exhausted just trying to figure that out. 

Now I was pretty confident in playing again because that latte part was basically the only thing i had trouble making, but now erm. Customers get mad when i make them.... exactly what they ordered?! Like there's one where they order an americano + one shot of coffee on the side (they wanted an iced AM and an espresso shot) but he got refunded $21 because i got it wrong? 

Then a lady ordered 2 hot lattes and when i did just THAT, they got mad and refunded too. A man order led 2 iced lattes and same thing happened. Genuinely, wtf is happening.

I know i'm doing everything right because i've googled up recipes with specific dialogues so what is the problem? 

Atp I'm just gradually losing all my money serving them drinks, except if they order an espresso. It's a little disappointing how quickly i'm getting done with this game when i've been looking forward to it the most since last year.
