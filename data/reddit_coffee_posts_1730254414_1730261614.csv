1gfe80u,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1gfe80u/pressures_me_for_sex/,Pressures me for sex.,"My boyfriend has told me that if I don't have sex, it makes him tempted to look at other women and start thinking about other women. 

He told me he has never been rejected in a relationship before, he's 36 and has had long relationships and I just don't believe a woman never said she just didn't feel like it before? 

If I don't have sex he is gonna go watch porn and masturbate in the bathroom, fine, but why are you telling me, he knows it hurt me. 

If I don't have sex, it ruins his whole day. 

A few days ago he was being lovely and sweet, he wanted sex, I didn't want it. But now, due to his reaction when I say no, I'm literally scared to say no. 

I used to tell him the reasons why I didn't want it, I'm bloated, I want a shower, I need to go to the toilet, I have to get ready for work. He would always argue why the reasons don't matter. 

So I just started saying that I don't feel like it. That I should not have to argue. That it is my body and if I don't want sex, he has to just deal with it. 

This enrages him even more, he tells me I have to reject him sweetly and gently, tell him we will have sex later. Baby him. Placate him. Maybe just give him a blow job instead. 

He says i am responsible for his feelings and when I reject him it hurts him. 

He's suddenly decided he needs sex every day. We had sex 6 out of 7 days. On the 7th day I rejected him in the morning and he is literally pouting, sulking, avoiding eye contact, telling me this has ruined his mood. 

It was the weekend, I wanted to get up and make a coffee and have time to do what I want. I feel like I'm in prison and he owns my body. He also told me not to masturbate so that I'll want sex with him. 

He tells me any woman would want him. Physically he is very attractive, like extremely good looking. Our issues in the past and his behavior are killing my sexual attraction. 

I dont know what to do.

I’ve been super stressed, we’re in the middle of moving, and things are chaotic. So both pill organizers are sitting on my nightstand since we haven’t unpacked and settled in yet. So without thinking, I gulped down my morning meds. I tried puking, but it didn’t seem to work. I’m going to call the pharmacy to figure out if I can still take my night meds. I’m just looking for solidarity if anyone else has done this and had to deal with a screwed up sleep schedule and how did you cope? My morning pills include Wellbutrin, Caffeine, vitamin D, and Ritalin. So as you can imagine, sleep is going to be quite the challenge. I’m so disappointed. 

Again, I’ll call the pharmacist for the med details. I’m just curious what others would do between the options of forcing sleep or going all in with a pot of coffee and get stuff done all night? Anyone else dealt with this before?",1,1730261167.0,bipolar2,0,1.0,False
1gfe4n0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gfe4n0/we_arrested_someone_we_shouldnt_have/,We Arrested Someone we Shouldn't Have ,"For the past few months, my department has been gathering evidence and witnesses for the creator of a new drug that has appeared on the streets. It’s small in scale, and we had hoped to nip it in the bud before it spiraled out of control. Ruby Milk comes in syringe needles and is bright red, as the name suggests. The main problem with this narcotic is the side effects. 



The few addicts that have spoken to us and are coherent describe a high the likes of which you’ve never experienced in your life. A rush of euphoria and complete tranquility washes over you. It makes you want to have more, but therein lies the problem. If you are exposed to doses higher than 1 mL, your body begins to decay around the injection sight rapidly. I’m sure most have heard of the Russian street drug Krokodil, imagine that but amplified a hundred times. 



We’ve come across decayed bodies in alleyways and under bridges, and all of them have a needle full of Ruby Milk not far away from their dead bodies. The worst ones are the ones we find that are still alive. I remember the first time I encountered an addict and an entire chunk of her neck was just gone. Puss was leaking out from her neck and she didn’t seem to care at all. It only got worse from there, and soon this task force was formed to search for and find the source of Ruby Milk. 



My partner Susan and I were assigned to the task force as detectives. We knew the streets well, I grew up on them and Susan’s sister was unfortunately an addict who lived on them. Her sister, Marie was one of our informants. Being a methhead she was lucky to have the scoop on plenty of her fellow addicts.



“Marie thinks she has something,” Susan told me as she looked over at me as I had just sat down to drink my six day old coffee. I looked over at her and winced at the bitter and crappy taste. She hung up her desk phone and stood up to get her jacket. “She wants to meet her at that abandoned house on 9th Avenue.” 



“You couldn’t have told me before I sat down?” I groaned as I placed down my coffee and stood to grab my jacket. “You’re driving.” I pointed at her and tossed the keys to our car at her. She caught them and flipped me off as I followed after her. Our city isn’t the worst in the country but it has its seedy parts. Pulling the car up to 9th Avenue I scanned around at the row of abandoned houses that lined the neighborhood. 



“So, which exactly is she in?” I looked over at Susan as she parked the car in front of one of the houses. She flicked her head over toward the house we were parked in front of. Unbuckling her seatbelt and leaving the car I could tell that she was apprehensive about seeing her sister. I would too if my sister was in the state that Marie was in. 



“She better be here,” Susan sighed as she waited for me to exit the car. I closed the door and stared at Susan. She was a bitch most of the time, but it's what I enjoyed about her. She was confident in herself and I admired that about her. But now here she was, nervous and just a little bit afraid. 



“Chin up, Suzie,” I smirked as she turned and punched me in the arm as hard as she could. If there’s one thing in the world she hates, it’s being called Suzie. As I nursed my possibly broken arm I followed after Susan as she walked up to the decrepit house. She knocked on the door and quickly backed up. As I rubbed my arm I looked at her a little confused as to why she backed up so quickly. My confusion was quickly vanquished when the door flew open and a baseball bat was swung in the direction of where Susan had been. 



“Get the fuck away from…oh hi Suzie!” Marie went from wanting to kill someone who had dared to trespass on her ‘property’ to excited to see her sister. I could tell that they were related by the simple fact of how similar they looked. They weren’t twins but they’d been confused for twins in the past. Even being a meth addict, Marie was almost the spitting image of Susan.



“Do you wanna get punched too?” Susan asked as she raised her fist toward Marie and then gestured toward me. I walked over to her and pulled out my notepad. “Alright, what did you call me over here for, Marie? Do you have the info I asked for?” Marie quickly nodded and placed her bat against the doorframe. 



“Yea! One of my dealers tried selling me that red milk shit. I said I wasn’t interested and he said that if I was, I should go to this address.” She quickly started patting her pockets to see where she had left the note she’d been given. “Shit, where is it? One sec.” She quickly walked back into the house and left us standing in the autumn wind. 



“Can we trust her? I know she’s your sister, but she isn’t exactly the most reliable witness.” I turned to look at Susan. She was standing and tapping her foot against the pavement and tapping her finger against her arm. Seeing her sister in this state was bothering her. 



“I think we can. She’s been doing better lately. And at the very least she isn’t using Ruby Milk.” Susan sighed, perking up when her sister came running out of her abandoned house with a sticky note. 



“Found it!” she said happily, handing the note to her sister and smiling. Susan took the note and read it, her eyes went wide and she looked back up at her sister. She handed me the note, I took it and looked down at it, and my own eyes went wide. 



“Are you sure, Marie? This place is…in a nice neighborhood. Are you sure your dealer told you the correct place?” I wrote down the address on my notepad while I let Susan question her sister. Marie nodded quickly and stuck her hands in her pockets. 



“That’s the place. I trust Freddy, he’s never given me shit product before.” High praise coming from a meth addict. Susan looked over at me and sighed. It was going to be a risk, but it was one we were going to have to take since it was our only lead to the source of where Ruby Milk was coming from. Susan reached into her pocket and pulled out a wad of bills, walking over and placing the cash in her sister’s hand. 



“This is for groceries only, you understand me? I find out you bought more meth, and I’m cutting you off. Understand?” Marie looked down at the money in her hand and quickly wrapped her arms around her sister and gave her a tight hug. One which Susan gave back to her. It was a touching moment between sisters, while I just stood there kicking rocks. 



Once we were back at the office we quickly ordered a steakout of the house in question. It was in a gated community and we had to jump through plenty of hoops just to even be allowed inside the community. We set up a plumber van on the street that the house was on and several days went by where not a living soul left the house. 



We were beginning to think that maybe Marie had indeed fed us fake information. Or that Freddy had just been fucking with her. Susan and I were in the van on the last day of the steakout. Our permit from the community was set to expire at the end of the day and we were hoping and praying that something would happen on this day. 



“Susan! We got something.” I nudged her awake. She snorted and nearly punched me in the face before I quickly pointed at the house. She turned her gaze toward the house and quickly pulled her binoculars out. A few poorly dressed people suddenly exited from the house. They were quickly dragged back inside by someone unseen by the door. 



“What the hell? We’ve been here for six hours, how did we not see anybody go in there?” Susan asked as she lowered her binos. I wondered how we might have missed someone entering the house. When I suddenly remembered something about this gated community. 



“Isn’t this backyard connected to the forest preserve?” I asked, quickly pulling out my phone to check. I pulled up Maps and was quickly confirmed in my suspicion. This house’s backyard was connected to the forest preserve, and not far away from this house was the parking lot for the forest preserve. 



We sent a squad car to examine the forest preserve’s parking lot, and my hunch was proven correct. Several Ruby Milk addicts were found milling around the parking lot. It was flimsy evidence at best, but it was just enough to get a judge to sign a search warrant. Soon our task force was granted a SWAT team and were we given the green light to raid the house. 



The name of the operation was called Operation Milkman which I came up with, and which Susan hated. We made our way back to the gated community and Susan took great pleasure in showing our warrant to the security guard who had made us jump through so many hoops to be able to set up surveillance here in the first place. We surrounded the house, and we made our way towards the front door. 



I knocked on the door and took a step back. Both me and Susan were wearing bulletproof vests and had our pistols drawn. We waited a few more seconds before banging on the door again. “Police department! Open the door or we’re breaking it down!” I ordered. And when still no one answered I motioned for the SWAT team to take the lead. The officer with the battering ram reduced the door to splinters in mere moments and soon we had gained access to the house. 



I immediately wish that we hadn’t. The moment we set foot in the house, the smell of death and decay hit our noses like an out-of-control semi-truck. Susan and I have pretty strong stomachs, but even we were almost brought down to our knees by the stench. A couple of the SWAT guys spit out vomit from their mouths but kept moving through the house. It seemed like every couple of steps there was a decaying body laid out on the floor. 



“Jesus Christ…” Susan coughed out as she walked around the bodies laid out across the floor. I followed after her and the SWAT team as they went room to room trying to find any sign of life. We had almost given up hope when all of a sudden from one of the upstairs rooms we heard one of the SWAT members shout.



“Hands up motherfucker!” We quickly rushed towards the sound of the shouts and soon we came across a room that was filled with beakers, burners and so many prescription bottles that I thought for a moment we had busted a pharmacy robbery. “Let me see your hand!” The SWAT team screamed again. I followed where their rifles were trained and saw that there was indeed someone still alive, sitting at a table and looking at us. 



He was dressed in a hoodie, with a face mask on. His eyes looked milky and hollow and his hair was in an absolute mess. He slowly raised his hands and let out an annoyed sigh from behind his mask. His hands were covered in surgical gloves. The SWAT quickly closed the distance between them and grabbed him. They threw him to the ground and quickly slapped the cuffs on him. 



“What the fuck?” one of them said. Susan quickly walked over and then motioned me to come over as well. As they had lifted his hoodie sleeved up to properly get the cuffs on him, they discovered that his arms were completely stripped of flesh. They pulled the gloves off of him and even his hands were completely bone as well. 



“Alright asshole, what the fuck is this?” Susan asked him, grabbing him by the hair and yanking his head up from off the floor. As she did so, we heard what sounded like a golf ball hitting the floor. It turned out to be one of this guy’s eyes. It was a glass eye. 



“Man, I’m just getting all kinds of exposed today, aren’t I?” He chuckled, before Susan let his head go and allowed it to slam back against the floor. The SWAT members picked him off the floor, and I put on my pair of gloves and picked up his glass eye off the floor. We tossed him into our squad car and waited for the forensic team to arrive. These guys have some of the toughest stomachs I’ve ever seen, and even some of them were vomiting and gagging as they entered the house. 



We transported the prisoner back to the station and started the booking process. Which was a problem, as we couldn’t get fingerprints from him for obvious reasons. And when we pulled down his face mask to get his mugshot we were greeted with the fact that his entire lower face had also been peeled free of skin. The only bit of information we got from him was from his wallet. 



His name was Spencer Blackwell. He had no criminal history to speak of and the only record we or even the FBI had on him was that he had been listed as a missing person before the case was dismissed. We had him cuffed to the table of the interrogation room with zip ties because he didn’t have handcuffs that could keep him safely attached to the table. We had paramedics come to check him out since for all intents and purposes he shouldn’t have even been alive at that moment. 



“All his vitals came back normal.” One of the EMTs told us as he exited the interrogation room. “We could barely figure out how to take his pulse, but it’s normal. Temperature is normal, he’s aware and cognitive. Honestly, he’s healthier than most people I know.” The EMT shrugged and joined us in looking at Spencer through the two-way mirror. 



“He doesn’t look normal and healthy.” I crossed my arms and stared at him. Another thing that they had discovered was that both of Spencer’s eyes were made of glass. And yet he could see perfectly fine. He had no tongue in his mouth but he could speak just fine. He was perfectly normal, except for the simple fact that so much of him was exposed bone. 



“Well, he’s our best guess for the creator of Ruby Milk. We found thousands of doses in that little lab of his. And he was previously a chemical engineering student, he fits everything we know about the creator. Let’s go and get some answers out of him.” Susan tapped me on the shoulder, and I followed after her. I followed after her as she opened the door to the interrogation room and entered it. 



“So who’s good cop bad cop? You look pretty mean.” Spencer pointed his bone fingers toward Susan. He wasn’t wrong, as Susan sat down and slammed the manila envelopes she was carrying with her. I sat next to her with my cup of coffee and settled in for the show that was about to happen. “Don’t I get a phone call, first?” Spencer asked us, Susan ignored him before reading him his Miranda rights. 



“Knowing and understanding your rights as I have explained them to you, are you willing to answer my questions without an attorney present?” She asked, staring at Spencer and waiting for his response. The bone man simply shrugged in response. 



“Sure, I don’t mind talking to you guys. It won’t do you a lot of good though.” He let out a dry laugh and tried to lean back in his chair. Only to be stopped by the zip ties holding him in place. He let out an annoyed grunt and pushed his chair up closer to the table. “So, what do you wanna know?” 



“Are you the creator of Ruby Milk?” I asked first, beating Susan to the punch. I could already tell that she was going to have a tough time dealing with Spencer. She gets angry easily and Spencer probably picked up on this. 



“Sure am,” he said with pride in his voice. I bet if he still had skin on his lower face he’d be smiling the widest grin. Well in a way he had a permanent smile on his face now. “You guys caught me in the middle of making a new batch. I just got those new ingredients too.” Spencer sighed, doing his best to lean back in his chair. 



“How’d you get all those ingredients? I doubt that you just walked into a pharmacy and asked for them.” Susan pulled out another file and slid it across the table toward Spencer. It was several pictures of all the medical supplies and scores of prescription bottles. 



“Oh, that’s easy. When dealers come to me for products, I send them to pharmacies to pick up these prescriptions. It’s pretty easy in this day and age to face a prescription.” He tugged against the zip ties and sighed in annoyance. “Look, I’m not going to attack you guys, can you please cut these stupid things off? You do that, and I’ll tell you everything you want to know.” I looked over at Susan and she nodded. I walked over and took out my pocket knife, cutting the ties off. 



“How did you create Ruby Milk?” she asked him. He was rubbing his wrists which I thought was interesting since I figured that he couldn’t possibly have felt anything one those things without nerves to feel them. 



“I doubt you want to hear a chemistry lesson from me, detective.” Spencer sat back in his chair and stuck his hands in his pockets. Even though I knew he had been frisked and everything on his person had been confiscated, that still put me a little on edge. “I came up with it after I left college. It took a lot of trial and error, but at least I had a good test subject,” he said with a dry laugh. 



“You tested on yourself?” I asked him, and he gave me a nod. 



“You don’t start looking like this if you aren’t prepared to make some sacrifices. In the end, I created Ruby Milk cause I was bored. And hey, if I make something when I’m bored and other people enjoy it, shouldn’t I be allowed to profit off of it?” He asked so nonchalantly that it even made me angry at him. 



“Your product fucking kills people!” Susan shouted, slamming her fist on the table and tossing another series of photos of him. It was of just a few of the bodies that had been discovered in his house. He looked down at them and picked up a couple of them. 



“Any drug that isn’t used responsibly kills people. I told people the safe levels to inject themselves with. Am I to blame when they don’t listen to me?” He tossed the photos back on the table and stared at the two of us with his hollow unfeeling eyes. 



“You don’t feel any remorse for these people?” I asked him, he looked me straight in the eyes and shook his head at me. I looked over at Susan and she looked back down at her files in disgust. Spencer just sat there with his arms crossed at us, turning his head to look at the clock on the wall. 



Just as we were about to ask him more questions the door to the interrogation room flew open and our chief walked in. He looked over at Spencer and quickly walked over to us. “You two, come with me,” he ordered. We looked at each other, and stood up from our seats, gathering our files and following after our chief, leaving Spencer alone in the interrogation room. 



“What’s the problem, chief?” I asked him as he led us away from the interrogation room. He turned to look at us and rubbed his head wearily. I could tell that something bad was about to happen. 



“We have to let him go.” The chief said. I stood there in shock and disbelief. Susan, in her usual manner, was much more verbal than I was. 



“The fuck you mean let him go?!” She shouted, slapping the files against the wall in anger and pointing a finger at the chief. “Why the fuck should we let that scumbag go?! He’s the source of Ruby Milk and if we let him go now, he’s going to hurt a lot more people, Chief!” She scrambled, causing a scene in the hallway.



“Susan, did you look at the warrant you got? It was filled out incorrectly. Not only that, but we also know you got the information from your drug addict sister. I thought I made it clear that I wouldn’t tolerate you using her as an informer anymore.” The chief told us, to prove our point he handed us a copy of the warrant. 



I took it before Susan could rip it to shreds in her anger. I scanned the warrant everywhere, trying to see where the mistake had been made. And I felt my heart sink when I saw what the mistake was. We had written down the wrong address for the house. I handed the paper over to Susan. She took one look at it, and also immediately knew what was wrong with it. 



“That’s not possible. How could we mess this up?” she said in disbelief, shaking her head over and over again. “You can’t be serious chief! You can’t be!” she pleaded, but he held his hand up to her and nodded. 



“I’m afraid I am. Let him go you two. I’m sorry it has to be this way.” He sighed and turned to walk away from us. Susan stared at me for a moment before hanging her head in defeat. We made our way back to the interrogation room and found Spencer pacing around in the room. 



“You’re…free to go,” I told him, barely able to get the words out. He looked at us and I could just feel the shit-eating grin he must’ve been trying to give us. We followed after him as he collected his confiscated items. He placed his face mask back on and his gloves. Just before he left the station, he turned to look at us.



“You know something…you look familiar.” He pointed at Susan. He pulled down his mask as if it was going to give him a better view of her. “You look like one of my regulars. In fact, she showed up today. Asking to sample some Ruby Milk. Maybe I’m mistaken.” He waved goodbye to us and left us alone at the entrance. 



I stared at Susan as the gears in her head suddenly clicked. “Oh God…no!” She quickly shouted, reaching into her pocket and pulling her phone out. I followed after her once she started running toward the car we shared. She quickly threw the car in drive and drove with her light blaring towards 9th Avenue, trying to call Marie the whole time. 



Once we arrived, Susan lept out of the car so quickly that she almost forgot to park the damn car. She ran up to the door and quickly began smashing her fists against the door. “Marie open the fucking door!” She screamed, throwing her shoulder against the door. I quickly ran after her and added my own weight to the door. It came down soon afterward and we both entered the house. 



“Marie!” Susan screamed as she started searching for her sister. I followed after, looking everywhere for her. I entered the kitchen and soon found Marie. She was sitting at the kitchen table, with half her face melting away. She turned to look at me with a dazed look on her face. 



“Oh…hey,” she said. Susan came running into the kitchen upon hearing her voice and let out a pained wail upon seeing her sister. Marie’s head cocked to the side and a large chunk of her skin fell to the floor in a sick wet plop as she did so. “Hey...Suzie. I feel sleepy,” she mumbled, before going limp in her chair. Susan wailed louder and ran to her sister, grabbing her and shaking her. She immediately laid her on the floor and started doing CPR as I quickly phoned for an ambulance. 



As I was stepping outside to call for the ambulance a loud crack went off, and I suddenly found myself lying on the floor and unable to move. He tried to speak and only managed to spit out a large amount of blood. I’d been shot. 



“Fancy meeting you here detective.” Spencer’s voice came upon me, and he moved my limp head to look up at me. He pulled his face mask back down to look at me and I noticed the revolver he had in his hand. “Just had to teach you two a lesson, about fucking with me.” He patted me on the head and let my head droop back down. 



I heard him walk into the house and I heard two more shots ring out. I tried desperately to move. Soon I heard footsteps approaching and Spencer grabbed my head again to look up at me. “Not to worry. I feel like leaving you as a vegetable is better. I reunited the two sisters though, I’m not a cruel person after all.” He laughed, letting my head drop back to the floor before he kicked me in the head as hard as he could. 



Paramedics found me several minutes later. They found Susan cradling her dead sister with two shots to the back of her head. I was in the hospital for a long time and managed to regain use of my upper body. The shot had shattered my spine and I was lucky to not have been killed outright. But to add insult to my injuries, I was fired from the force. 



I decided to come here to get some kind of justice for my partner. And maybe also just to get the story out there. Since that day, I haven’t heard a thing about Ruby Milk in the news, and none of my former colleagues will speak to me about it. So maybe there’s somebody out there that will listen to my story. 



If even one person reads this and learns about this, please. Do everything in your power to stop Spencer Blackwell.

We dated. We were together for years and I loved him so much... but well, we ended our relationship months ago. 
I googled my crush just to see what his life were become, and I didn't find out much but an old email and I kinda think I know where he works. 
I want to see him again.
And of course I'll like to have a proper date or something but honestly I just want to talk to him once more. I used to have so much fun with him.
But Idk how to talk to him, I mean if I send an email he might think like 'wtf, where did u get my email?'
And maybe I can go to his work and act like ""omg! I didn't know you work here!"" And then ask him for a coffee or something but I'm a bit scared of being creepy or that he reject me :(

I would love to get some outside opinion on whether AITA in a fight I’m (30s F) having with my partner (30s M).

For context, I’m in a relationship with my partner for about two years. Before that, I was in a seven year relationship with a guy who emotionally cheated on me for the majority of our time together. 
Right before I got together with my current partner I had moved from a big city to a smaller one and my partner knows that I didn’t have the easiest time adjusting to the environment here. My professional network here is very small on confined to the people I meet at my job—having a network is important for me and the type of work I do. 

Onto the issue. Today I stumbled upon a local article that talked about a person in my industry and I recognized her name from a time when I used to live in the larger city. She does the same type of work I do, but we never met personally, but I know _of_ her as we both used to live in the larger city for a while. So we kinda knew the same people, I remember her name but idk if she knows mine, that type of thing. I remember her distinctly because my ex, the guy I was with for a long time, was “friends” with her. At least that’s what he told me. I found out later that he had secretly met with her, went to dinner with her, was ultra sweet and cute to her. In short, he had a crush on her and was trying to land with her, despite being in a relationship with me at that time. She, however wanted to be friends and always turned him down (I know because I read his texts, arrest me). Eventually, their “friendship” faded and my ex moved onto the next person to (try to) cheat with.

Anyhow, I realized that none of this was really her fault and that she is her own person regardless of what my ex thought of her, and so I decided to reach out. My motive was, we’re in the same small city, have both spent significant years of our career in the larger one, and we do the same type of work. Why not meet up for a coffee. I briefly chatted to my good friend, asking their opinion if that’s weird given the history with my ex, but even my friend assured me that after all it wasn’t mine or the woman’s baggage but my ex’s. 

Later in the day, I told my partner. And I know that he is very sensitive every time I mention my ex so I gave him the caveat of that this might be a sensitive thing before I told him exactly what I wrote up here. And he got so upset! He said it’s weird, and he said that I’m constantly trying to find ways to keep my ex in my life. And then later he said it’s weird that I asked my friend first before I consulted him. He also says that I asked my friend for permission, which is not true. I just wanted an opinion. My partner says that now he can’t say he doesn’t want me to message her because I already did and that I “always do whatever I want no matter how he feels”. He says his opinion doesn’t matter to me and I would’ve ignored it anyways. He is of the opinion that if a person is uncomfortable with their partner meeting someone/hanging out with someone/speaking to someone etc. and they say that, that the respectful thing of the partner is to follow that request and not meet up/hang out/talk. He says if I requested this from him then he would not do it out of respect for me and for not wanting to hurt me. We clearly have a difference in opinion here because I don’t even think there’s anything weird going on. My ex isn’t even in the country anymore and this woman clearly didn’t want anything from him. And even if, what does it have to do with my partner. Ahhhh.

I hope you all are doing okay. 

I was wondering if anyone else has experience extreme and constant hiccups for months on end because of GERD? I developed them this past December, and it’s every day, every night, and every morning. I am seeing my primary care doctor, she thinks the two might be related, but she’s not sure, so I’m going to see a GI specialist because I haven’t seen one in a while. The hiccups are so bad that they hurt my diaphragm, stomach, and my abdomen  area. The air from the hiccup also gets trapped within my stomach and my chest sometimes. And the air then travels up with the acid into my throat at night, causing it to be sore and burning. 

Does anyone know if this is a definite symptom of GERD? Any advice? I’ve tried everything— lots of medicine, changing my diet (getting rid of coffee, tomatoes, onions, soda, and more), and not laying down immediately after I eat. I’ve also tried alternative medicines. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I’m very much struggling here. 

Also I used to be on Zoloft (and I think that has been a major cause of my acid reflux), I literally just went off it, so I have to see if that changes anything as well. ",1,1730260111.0,GERD,2,1.0,False

* Personality-wise, I’m super chatty, honest, and flirty, with a love for banter and deeper conversations.

He has since tried to make it up to me but I’ve just lost interest in him. Why do I feel too guilty to leave?,"I have posted about this before on a different sub but I’d like thoughts from this one.

Last month, my husband of 4 years went to a work conference (he’s a couples therapist) while I was 10 days post-op from endometriosis surgery and came back to tell me he went to coffee and cuddled (he demonstrated on me) with another couples therapist from the conference. He initially dismissed my feelings about it, saying that it’s not a big deal, and he’s proud of himself for stopping at cuddling. After several days of back and forth, he finally started to feel bad and decided he needed to make it up to me. He has apologized and started to be more proactive about things in the relationship.

Here’s the thing - before this, I’ve felt for some time that I am the writer, producer, director, and actor within our lives and he has just been barely an actor. We bought a house together and I did most of the renovations myself while balancing my PhD. He has just been passive and careless, and this betrayal is evidence of his carelessness. An example of his carelessness is that he forgot about our first fertility clinic appointment, despite me reminding him twice in the weeks leading up to it. He says he really wants kids but he does not actively pursue it, nor does he actively pursue anything related to us. Even after the endometriosis surgery, he barely noticed I was in pain after maybe getting me tea and soup for the first 3 days. So this cuddling incident while I was post-op has been the straw that broke the camels back, and I feel like I no longer even want to work on this marriage.

But he’s trying now and I believe underneath it all, he’s a good person. He's very gentle and soft-spoken. He's involved in our community. He’s never yelled at me and he knows I like peonies. He makes me coffee on some mornings and he makes dinner every so often. He even helped me pay for my car. Since this incident... He has expressed a lot of emotion (usually I have to coax emotion out of him). He has been checking on my pain levels daily (because I called him out on his lack of care). He booked me a week long writers retreat so I can work on my dissertation and packed me a care package. He has made a couple of date plans. He paid a parking ticket of mine without asking. Still, there’s something missing. He’s just not… it. I am no longer attracted to him and I feel like I do not want to connect with him. I ask him where he’d like to live after I graduate, he says he hasn’t thought about it. He doesn’t think much at all. He doesn’t challenge me. He doesn’t inspire me. I'm not sure if this is just a me thinking that the grass greener on the other side type of situation or this situation is genuinely bad.

I’m tired and sometimes I don’t even like him anymore. My gut feeling is to leave but I feel too scared and guilty. Maybe he will continue this streak of trying. We are in couples therapy so maybe things will get better. I don’t know what to do and I’d feel guilty leaving him because now he’s become aware of all his flaws and he’s working on them. I feel so bad for him having to start over at 36 because he supported me through my PhD. I feel so guilty. Is this bad enough to leave?

Tl;dr - husband betrayed me and downplayed it. He’s been disappointing me beforehand but he since stepped up. I’m not feeling it anymore but I’d still feel guilty to leave.",7,1730259346.0,relationships,14,0.89,False
1gfdmei,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gfdmei/is_my_40f_gf_mean_or_am_i_36f_a_giant_baby/,"Is my (40f) gf mean, or am I (36f) a giant baby?","I have so much on my mind right now. Forgive me if this is disorganized.

I am a 36 year old female who has been dating my partner – 40 year old female – for nine months.

We are very different. However, we have decided to try to make it work in spite of our differences. She is loud, domineering, a little aggressive, and a bit of a rule breaker. Meanwhile, I am very much a rule follower who is anxious, quiet, and a bit passive. 

I’ll just cut to the chase. I am not sure if I’m being too sensitive – and believe me, I have a history of being way too sensitive and thin skinned – or if she is kind of mean.

Some examples. She always shushes me. I am a quiet person. However, when I get excited, or I think something is funny, I will get animated and raise my voice and start laughing. She will tell me to be quiet. She’s done this on multiple occasions, and it’s not like I’ve been anywhere I would bother anyone. This has happened when we were in the privacy of my own home or hers. I’ll be telling her a funny story or just being silly, and the more I’m talking the louder I’ll get, and she’ll just interrupt me and start shushing me to lower my voice. I hate it, because it’s like I let my guard down in front of her and let her see me totally uninhibited and being silly, and she just tells me I’m being too loud. 

She has a roommate, And I’ve been at their house,and we have just been hanging out and talking, and my girlfriend will start shushing me and has said it’s because she doesn’t want me to “disturb” her roommate. But it’ll be early in the evening. And her roommate is watching TV, or talking on the phone. Also, her roommate often stays up late, has guests over, and will be loud. So, I don’t understand…? It’s not like her roommate would care that I am making noise? Not that I want to be loud or bother her roommate! I don’t want to disrespect anyone in their own home. However, I don’t think I’d be bothering her roommate.

Anyway, the other day, I was at her apartment, and I was talking, and I got excited and I guess I got loud, and my girlfriend immediately starting shushing me. Well, I guess her roommate overheard this because, suddenly, her roommate shouts from the next room, to my girlfriend: “Are you seriously shushing her right now?! I hope she shoves a sock in your mouth the next time you shush her like that!” (Lololol)

My girlfriend immediately began apologizing to me, claiming the only reason she was telling me to be quiet was because she had smoked a lot of weed and was really high (?). I pointed out to her that she frequently tells me to be quiet, even when she’s not high, and she just sort of made a mocking noise, and that was it. (The only reason she apologized was because her roommate called her out.)

I do a really silly Cher impression, which I’ve done for years. It used to make my coworkers laugh. After a couple of months of dating my now girlfriend, she told me to stop doing the impression because my voice makes her “sick” when I do it.

I talk to cats in a baby voice. It’s probably annoying, I know, but it’s kind of a habit. Well, the other night at dinner, we were talking about our cats, and I was talking about mine, and I sort of slipped into the voice I do when I talk to my cat, and my girlfriend immediately start shushing me. I looked around the restaurant to see if people were staring at us, to see if I was being too loud or making a scene or something. Nope. The restaurant was really crowded and really loud and no one was paying attention. So, I didn’t understand why she was telling me to be quiet, because it wasn’t like I was drawing attention to us. I said, “Why are you shushing me? No one can even hear us. No one is paying attention.” She replied, “No, it’s not that. It’s just that you sound ret***ed when you talk like that.”

She is very particular about wanting to get moving when she’s ready to go. She will start to get attitudinal and grumpy and antsy. The other day, we were out, and we were going to be doing a lot of walking. We went to lunch and had plans for after lunch (not time sensitive ones). Well, she was ready to leave, and it was taking a while for the server to bring our check. My girlfriend was getting annoyed. I was trying to cheer her up. She snapped at me, “I don’t need you to make me feel better. I know how to self-regulate.” So, I kind of just… clammed up and kept quiet. Finally, the server brought our check and we left. My girlfriend had been saying she had a headache, so I asked if she wanted to stop for headache medicine before we went to our next stop. She said, “No, I don’t want to stop. I’m trying to get to the next place we have to go.” So, I realized then that she was still annoyed and that I just needed to keep moving so that we could get to where we were trying to go so that she would be in a better mood. Well, as we were walking down the street - a busy street, full of people, mind you - she stops and asks, “Are you going to be able to walk in those shoes?” I was wearing dressy shoes for lunch and thought we could go home so that I could change into my sneakers before we went to our next stop; however, when I saw how agitated she was getting at the restaurant, I just decided to suck it up and deal with wearing the shoes I had on. That’s what you do to keep your significant other happy, right? I just kind of stared at her for a second when she asked me, and then I answered, “I’m going to have to. We have to get to our next stop.” And she said, “No. Tell me: will you be able to walk in those shoes?” I was getting a bit nervous, because I knew she was already upset about being delayed at the restaurant, so I told her I would make it work. Well, immediately, she raises her voice at me, on the street, in public: “I’M NOT FU**ING DOING THIS WITH YOU TODAY!”

This isn’t the first time she’s raised her voice and started swearing in public like this. A couple months ago, at a festival, she did the same thing. We were at a festival. We were walking around. I was so overwhelmed by everything happening, but in a good way! I was SO happy. I was looking at everything, taking it all in, smiling so much my cheeks were hurting. I wasn’t saying much, because I was so overcome by everything. Meanwhile, my girlfriend was texting on her phone the entire time and not really paying attention to me. I finally asked her, after about 20 minutes of us, walking around and her repeatedly pulling out her phone and texting, if everything was okay, or if there was something going on and if there was anything I could do to help. She snapped at me, in the middle of the festival: “No, but would you like to do our own things and then meet back up later? Because it’s like you don’t even fu**ing want to be here!” I told her I did want to be there, that I was having a great time, that I was taking everything in, that I couldn’t stop smiling. She kept telling me she might as well have been there alone. I told her, “You’ve been in your phone pretty much this entire time. I don’t know how you would even notice whether or not I’m having a good time.” She raised her voice at me, in the middle of the festival, “THAT IS NOT TRUE AND I AM NOT FU**ING DOING THIS WITH YOU RIGHT NOW!”

A few minutes later, I bought myself a single yellow rose (while my girlfriend stood by and watched) to make myself feel better. (Later in, when her roommate found out that I bought myself a flower instead of my girlfriend buying it for me, her roommate told her “you suck”, and my girlfriend apologized to me. My therapist thought this whole thing was really crappy.)

When I tell her she can’t yell at me like that or talk to me like that, she tells me, “Stuff like that doesn’t seem like a big deal to me.”

She always accuses me of being bad at communicating. She tells me I don’t know how to communicate and “that’s just not how you communicate”. However, when I try to bring topics up, she will tell me, “I’m not in the mood to talk about this right now”; “you need to first ask me if I have the space for this before sliming me with it”; “I don’t have the spoons for this conversation right now.” Yet, when she gets angry or upset, she tells me in the moment and expects me to listen and respond. It’s like all communication is dictated by her. And when I sit down and try to get her to listen, she will roll her eyes and ask, after I’ve spoken for a while, “Are we done with this, now?” Yet, she will repeatedly tell me, over and over and over, that I don’t know how to communicate. 

I’m clumsy and struggle with coordination and motor skills. Last weekend, we went on a bike ride (my first one in over a decade). I struggled, but did my best. I lost my balance, fell, and scraped my leg up. However, I got back on the bike and kept going. However, at an intersection, I lost my balance again and fell off my bike, landing against a light pole. As I struggled to right myself and pick the bike up off the ground, I looked up and saw my girlfriend, already gone and pedaling up the street as I shouted after her, “Hey! Wait for me.” It kind of bummed me out that she didn’t even wait for me, or check to see if I was okay or make sure I was back up.

Soon after that, we stopped for coffee and pastries. I was kind of emotional and beating myself up over my clumsiness (I had an abusive childhood with family who humiliated me for my clumsiness, and my girlfriend knows this). I was embarrassed for having fallen, twice, in front of people, and angry with myself. It just ripped open some old wounds. Plus, my leg was throbbing from the fall I took. I told her I hurt my leg. I started crying, and I HATE crying in public, so that made it even worse. My girlfriend just sat there. She did tell me, “It’s not a big deal.” She then picked up her cell phone and messed around on it while I sat there and silently cried (and tried desperately to stop crying). At one point, some stranger who saw me crying, walked up to me, started patting my back, and said, “It’s okay. It’s going to be okay.” That small act of kindness was everything to me, in that moment. 

I told my girlfriend why the whole thing had me so down, mentally. I explained it to her.

Later that evening, I tried to suck it up and just hang out with her. I was still kind of reeling and down from earlier in the day, but I tried my best to be present. My girlfriend knew I was still off, and I had been pretty open with her, earlier that day, about why it bothered me. Yet, she kept barking at me, all evening, “What’s wrong with you? Why are you pouting?” And, “The pastries we got earlier, you didn’t really get to try them the right way. They were probably salty, from your tears, since you were crying.” … Okay?

Later that night, we talked about it some more. She told me she left me behind when I fell at the intersection, because she thought my fall wasn’t “that bad”, and it looked like I had gotten right back up which, okay, I guess? She also told me I needed to “communicate” better with her, because it was very clear to her I was struggling, emotionally, all evening but that I wasn’t telling her what was wrong. But, like, she already knew what was wrong, because I had told her, earlier that day, what was wrong. So…?

Anyway, wow. This is long. This is really, really long. If you’ve read it, wow. Thanks. You deserve a medal. 

I guess I’m just not really sure what to do. There are three sides to every story. In this case, there is mine, my girlfriend’s, and the truth. I worry I am a sensitive, emotionally abusive baby who expects too much from her. So what if she hates my silly voices? A lot of people think stuff like that is annoying. Hell, so do I. So what if she doesn’t want to baby me? Maybe she expects to be dating a grown woman and not someone who needs to be coddled.

Yet, I can’t help but feel like maybe she’s mean. Maybe I deserve better? I don’t know.

My therapist thinks she is mean-spirited, harsh, unfair, overly critical, that she constantly gaslights me, and that I need to get out of this relationship. However, he is only hearing my side of the story.

I want to be fair to her. I’m just so conflicted right now.",2,1730259315.0,relationship_advice,7,1.0,False

1gfdhao,https://v.redd.it/lv7clmlsbtxd1,Lurker saying thanks <3,"Hi! I’ve been lurking here throughout my mom’s battle with vascular dementia. Thank you all for contributing such personal and helpful vignettes—I can’t tell you how much it helped. 

My mom passed on Friday, September 13 at the age of 68. Her birthday was last week. She was a brilliant and prominent public finance lawyer who helped millions access affordable housing as a bond lawyer here in NYC. 

She grew up destitute in public housing in the west village and single-handedly cared for her mom, who had early onset dementia in her 40s. She got into Harvard Law so she could support her mom and gave up her dream of becoming a history professor as dementia care was (and still is) prohibitively expensive. She eventually moved her mom into long term SNF care, but her mom lived another 40 years. 

My mom had a lot of spinal and other health issues for the last 12 years. She had a DX of what they used to call Asperger’s and ADHD, so this made things hard to untangle. She had a fusion surgery in 2012, a DX of epilepsy around the same time, type 2 diabetes, glaucoma/exfoliation, and in 2015, had a scan that showed increased T2 signals. She always had one of those beautiful minds, so she was good at hiding her illnesses and you could write off most of her early symptoms as eccentricity. 

I had two moms—but my birth mom died before they could be legally married back in 2015, so I’m legally an enigma, as I’m in my 40s and she never adopted us (but has been my second mom since 1990.) 

My birth mom’s death is what really started her downward spiral. She was alone and already  struggling with executive function. 

Her health issues were further exacerbated by the pandemic, and she fell behind on appointments. In 2022, after a fall, she was rushed to the hospital where she was found to have acute to early subacute infarcts within the posterior right centrum semiovale/corona radiata, significant atrophy, and severe SVID. Aside from word finding, she was ok. She was still working and a partner in her firm until her death (though the last year of her life she wasn’t doing much of anything.)

Headaches and other ailments revealed that she needed a cervical spinal fusion as well, so once she was home from that, her health took a nosedive. She became quadriplegic (not because of the surgery—because the surgery didn’t help as much as it was supposed to). She landed in the hospital in October of 2023 and had a 60 day stay at NYU for sepsis (she didn’t know how she got there—she thought she was there for her eyes.) I hadn’t seen her since the pandemic began. She was still talking fully, though she got names wrong. She had issues with her hands, so I didn’t think much of her inability to manipulate utensils. 

Because she couldn’t properly articulate her death with dignity needs (which is not just assisted death but also hospice, interventions, and stopping eating and drinking,) they took her convos as a want to die, and put her in a 1:1 hold. Her psychiatrist and I got into it because her psychiatrist thought she was totally ok and “just bipolar,” (a DX from 30 years prior that was likely actually seizures) so I fought them on institutionalizing her and on putting her on antipsychotics, something clearly stated as a no in her proxy. I told them she was likely having strokes.  I was correct, and since she was face blind and they kept losing her glasses, they were conflating access with psychosis. While I got an apology from them, I also got them to do the following: MRI, CT scans, EKG, PROTEIN TAU/THETA (14-3-3), CSF check, and I let them put a NG tube in her temporarily so we could get answers. Her tests came back as CSF positive for 14-3-3 and Tau protein markers, and I had fresh test results to work with, and I’m glad I was able to get these done while she was cooperative. 

She developed bedsores at NYU and got sent back home. We had a nice Thanksgiving at the hospital and I noticed she couldn’t chew her favorite cookie. She carried on cogent conversations, so I assumed this was ok and that it was all part of her having to retrain her brain post-stroke. I had her on 24/7 home care (EXPENSIVE) and this is when she became fully incontinent. She developed another UTI and then sepsis, so she spent another 40 days in NYU’s telemetry unit. 

She now had echolalia and was sundowning, and putting the TV on was confusing her and making her think she was on the run, as news was once her thing. Her bedsores got worse. I was told she only had a few weeks to live, and this happened several times. She always rallied. After this stay, her ability to swallow and speak was curtailed, and she moved to all purée. 

She kept telling stories about her childhood as if they were in present times, and kept calling my husband her cousin from childhood. Every time they’d say she only had a few weeks, she’d freak out on them and prove them wrong. She begged me to help her get better. Doctors kept trying to convince me to let her die, but she was still totally there and very against it. 

After she left that place, we were finally able to get her on Medicare and found a place that would care for her 24/7. We also had an aid with her from 8a-8p which was super expensive but necessary. Another UTI landed her in the ICU, but I changed her hospital. They figured out where the bacteria was coming from (growing on kidney stones-not the external catheter), and she again rallied and was using her phone again with assistance and socializing. I got a weird call from her in March of this year right before she got out, and she was congratulating me for a photography award I was apparently receiving in England (someone left the TV on again.) I didn’t correct her.  

She rallied once more and was able to get through a few calls with her firm to discuss long term disability. In mid July, she landed in the hospital again for a week for another infection. She got out, and I sent my kids and husband to go see her. She responded a little to my husband’s gossip, but mostly stared blankly and didn’t respond. I had prepped the kids so they knew. Right after this, my other partner went in for emergency gallbladder surgery, and two days after he got out, my daughter went in for her VBT surgery and stayed in the ICU for 11 days. Not a week later—my mom was back in the ICU, but this time an aid noticed she was having trouble breathing. 

She hadn’t eaten in a month and was barely drinking. This is when I knew. A chest x ray revealed a collapsed lung, likely aspiration pneumonia, and they had her on BiPaP and vasopressors. The head of the ICU and I spoke for a while. He told me she was only alive because of the BiPaP machine, and that her body could no longer expel CO2, so she was now facing Hypercapnia. They asked me if I wanted to put her on hospice (removing the BiPaP) and gave me great advice: don’t do it til I return in the morning. She will be left here for hours until morning. He told me intubation would likely kill her, and that the BiPaP was on for 50 hours and was becoming cruel. 

Overnight, I played her music and at some point, she started gasping and looked at me and I asked her what she said—she very clearly mouthed pain. I convinced nurses and docs to give her pain meds despite them telling me she wasn’t in pain (they were wrong.) It dropped her respiration super low, but she wasn’t feeling pain. We got her another bolus when needed and it did the same. The overnight doc remarked that he didn’t feel right contraindicating ICU care with respiratory depression, but I told him I wasn’t doing diddly squat til they got that chaplain. They listened. 

The next morning, my ICU head came back and told me I’d made the right calls. He told me her labs were exactly the same, and that I should put her on hospice. I made the call. He said CO2 wasn’t a bad way to go, and that they’d give her any drugs she needed. They took her BiPaP off and put her on O2. They put her on a hydromorphone drip and told me she was allowed to have extra boluses, O2, and benzos on demand. Her final wish was to pet a dog, so my friends helped me find the Good Dog foundation, who came to the hospital and brightened her life. 

We’d been up for 30 hours at this point, so we eventually got her settled and slept in the room with her. I woke up at 6am and she was in full party mode. Eyes wide open, very inquisitive about the room around her (nonverbally), and I played some music for her and she was trying to move her lips along to the music. It was so weird seeing her like this! The rally is real. Palliative care stopped by and I asked them about the prognosis—they’d told me it was the same and that she had maybe days. 

At around noon, we noticed her breathing become labored, and I asked her if she was in pain and she tried to mouth words but couldn’t. I had told palliative we needed faster drug response care and she assured me we’d have it. I told my mom that we were getting her drugs for comfort and that there was a chance she wouldn’t return from them as they inhibited breathing. She looked at me and I had to interpret it as —do it. The wonderful nurse brought a bolus and told me he had a benzo in his pocket for whenever I was “ready”, and I told him I’d call him when we were so we didn’t have to wait. Another hour went by and I saw her breathing was labored and asked her again. She looked at me and I knew. I buzzed the nurse, told my mom what we were doing, and told her not to worry … I had her affairs under control. I told her I loved her, and I gave her head scritches. We gave her that dose and both her eyes went in different directions. She looked so peaceful! Her mouth was slightly open and she wasn’t reacting to external stimuli. My partner went out to get us coffee, and her doctor came in to check on her. I told him I heard what I thought was a death rattle, and he told me probably not—but that her breathing had definitely changed. His notes said “she is transitioning.” 

He left and my partner came back and took a nap. I put on a nice playlist behind her head and kept watch. At around 2 pm, I noticed her breathing was far more shallow and she started skipping breaths. I started counting. She’d take four breaths, and randomly skip. This happened for a little longer and then I woke my partner up. He counted with me and told me to take a shower cause I probably wouldn’t have another chance. 

Once I got out, I stood with her and stroked her hair, and noticed she was no longer responding at all to my touch. The breaths got more and more shallow and at around 2:15 pm, the external catheter container on the wall filled slightly with urine that made the entire thing fog up. I’ve never seen that before and knew it meant something. I kept telling her she was doing so well and that I was so proud of her. Her breaths moved up into her chest and then throat, and the pauses between breaths grew lengthier. 

At 2:30, she stopped breathing for 30 seconds, and then took a few more breaths that seemed to be in her throat. Then she stopped breathing entirely at 2:37. We watched her carotid continue to pulse for another two minutes, and then it stopped. It was barely noticeable but not scary like I thought it would be. We took a few minutes and then got a doctor in there to confirm. He confirmed, and then we spent the max allotted time in there saying goodbye. I closed her eyes and took her mask off. That revealed yet another pressure wound on her nose, so I’m glad we got her off that machine. 

I have no regrets. She died within 24 hours in hospice, and I’m glad I pushed back on doctors every step of the way. I am glad we put her in when we did, and had I listened to the NYU docs, I would have put her in hospice way early and regretted it. It was tough putting her in there while she was still there (aphasia doesn’t mean gone!)—and it was tough not scaring her while also doing the thing I knew she wanted which was not lying to her. I found a happy medium between her proxy and a dignified death that didn’t break her wishes nor lie to her (cause she was vehemently anti lying and wanted to know the truth even when it was awful.) I got the hospital to bend all sorts of rules for solidarity. 

I’ve shared this in full cause it’s very very hard to get a real view unless you’re there for it. 

I’m starting the process of estate probate now. I’m offering myself as a resource should anyone have any questions about my navigation as a pay it forward for the info that helped me here. <3 

Here’s a bonus list of stuff I wish I had done/done differently: 

- Gotten a list of her most favorite songs (but hours and hours-not the same five.

- Read to her more aloud. 

- Had her passwords written out somewhere. 

- Checked on her phone earlier. Each time she was in the hospital or a SNF, she’d wind up helping out her roommate a little too much (like a 1k check for food or use of an Amazon account). 

- Known more about in hospital hospice (actually great). I learned palliative works in tandem with the regular docs, so notes on files are extremely important.

- Connected to her hospital notes more quickly. You can see them well before doctors can. It was super helpful having questions ready for the docs. Also—the more you know, the less they bullshit or baby you. Similarly, if you change hospitals for shitty reasons, don’t connect those charts out the gate. Some docs are willing to do different tests if you can make the case. 

- If you say to docs “this is an off the record question,” they’re more likely to be honest with you.

- Be super kind to nurses—they know more than docs a lot of the time. 

- Know who is wanted at the funeral and who isn’t, and honor that. 

- Before they die, make sure you have those bank accounts in trust to you, that you have a will or a trust set up to avoid probate, and that there are designated beneficiaries for death benefits. 

Here’s a bonus video of her last wish (Thank you again to the Good Dog Foundation. They were such a bright spot in a gloomy end.) 

I’m open to answering any questions as I can. 

Thank you again for allowing me to share in your stories.

1gfdf3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/walmart/comments/1gfdf3r/walmart_got_me_pulling_out_my_hair/,Walmart got me pulling out my hair.....,"This is more or less a rant post. 

Normally I don't have issues with walmart. Some people like it and some people don't whatever. 

I purchased three relatively cheap coffee makers from walmart.com. For my three siblings. One didn't have one. One had one in a shared house but they said it was always nasty and they wanted a cheap one in their room. And my sister's cat broke her previous one. 

One of the three was broken. You poured water and it just came gushing out everywhere. I went to the app to ask about a return. They said something how they couldn't get me an answer right away and they were going to give it to supervisor or something and get back to me. 

Days pass. I contact them again and they have no idea what I'm talking about so I start all over. I want to replacement. They say they're going to send one. 

Fast forward. No replacement.

I contact them again. Ask them if they're able to see previous conversations since it was online chat. They claim they can't (not sure if true or not). I asked for replacement. I'm on hold almost an hour while they continue to ""look it up."" Then something about how they can't do a replacement right now but they don't say why. So they tell me to just bring it back to the store to return it. 

I bring it to the store. I don't have a physical receipt because I bought it online but I show them the only thing. Turns out I was 2 days late in returning it but I tried to show them that I had been contacting walmart.com for over a month and they had been giving me the runaround. They didn't care. They told me nothing they could do and I had to contact walmart.com 

I go back to the app. They tell me they can't refund or replace. I tell them about the store and they tell me go ahead and contact the manufacturer instead and the manufacturer will replace it.

They give me a phone number. I call it. Completely different company that has nothing to do with the coffee maker brand or walmart. I go back to walmart.com. explain it again. They give me a different phone number. I call again. Phone number is disconnected. 

I go back to walmart.com. explain everything. Spend over an hour having to repeat myself over and over and over again because even though I wrote everything that had happened from the very start, they don't read just like most people here on Reddit have already stopped reading. 

Eventually they tell me to do a chargeback on my card. I try that. Except it's one of those online only banking accounts. And it's been more than the 30 days so they won't do anything. So I try to call up card services who for some weird reason keep telling me to go to the actual bank and describe my situation. I tell them there is no physical bank it's an online only it's an app. Which is weird because they're the ones who picked up the phone so you think they know that. So then they tell me to call the bank. I tell them I literally did.... They are the ones who picked up. I'm not comprehending why they don't understand this because they literally answered with the name of the bank (in other words I did not call the wrong number). they tell me there's nothing that they can do because too much time has passed by that point and that Walmart is responsible for the refund 

So I go back to walmart.com. once more I spend almost 2 hours going through everything I've tried and the person on the other end not listening to a word I say and just asking me to try things I've already tried. And then I repeat that I've already tried that and they just keep going on and on and on because again nobody on this fucking planet ever reads 

I finally snapped at them to get me a supervisor after 2 hours of back and forth conversation that we could have completely skipped if they had read my first paragraph. 

Supervisor magically makes a return barcode. I specify that I only wanted to return one of them even though I purchased three of them at the time. Supervisor tells me to take it back to my local Walmart 

I call it my Walmart to ask them what their hours are. They say customer service is open until 10:00 p.m. and the store is open until 11:00 p.m. 

I get there at about 9:20 ish, give or take a few minutes. I go to customer service and they tell me they are closed. I sighed and I told her something about how I had just called it was told they were open until 10:00  but ok....

Older lady gave me the glare of death. Not sure if she was mad at me or mad at whoever had told me that information but she did make an exception (I didn't push)

So I go to return the item and I tell her what's wrong with it. Then she tells me the barcode is for returning three coffee makers and demands to know where the other ones were. I told her that I had purchased three at a time but I was only returning one and I had told them I was only returning one because only one of them was defective. She starts snapping stuff about how I was doing it wrong and how I was making her job more difficult how she was having to do something on the computer I don't know. I couldn't understand half of it because she was grumbling under her breath.

Me again with the big ol' space opera that I'm practice pitching at a conference next week. I've done a lot of revision based on the feedback from my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PubTips/comments/1g5d88o/qcrit_the_solstice_contingency_adult_contemporary/) and believe I'm in a much better place than I was before.

The pitch I'll be providing can be up to four minutes in length and I'll receive four minutes of feedback from three agents of my choice. I appreciate any feedback you may have.

**PITCH:**  
In the 24th century, Earth’s nations have unified under the singular banner of the Alliance of United Nations. Humanity has prospered in a Golden Age of egalitarianism and technological advancement all thanks to the benevolence of the Primus–humanity’s ancient and powerful spacefaring ancestors. After the First Contact rattled Earth, the far more advanced Primus uplifted humanity as allies, but all is not as idyllic as it seems. When a war fleet breaches human stellar territory, AUN President Lisbeth Wolf is forced to declare war on what she believes to be her ancestors—only to discover a far more dangerous threat.

Kept hidden by the Primus since the First Contact, the invaders are a marauding species of reptilian aliens called the *Exuuké*, who are drawing humanity into a war that could cost billions of lives. As chaos engulfs Earth, Wolf, a career politician who has only ever read of war in history books, finds herself trapped in a war-torn city, surrounded by creatures that have no concept of mercy. As Wolf is traumatically wounded and narrowly escapes with her life, she receives a message from the Primus Empress herself that reveals another shocking truth: the very government that she has idolized has buried any knowledge of the *Exuuké* to avoid mass panic and maintain humanity’s unification.

Across the galaxy, Grand Empress Sin’Yeh Lexan faces political fallout in the wake of the *Exuuké* invasion of Earth, as her divided empire questions the value of defending their human descendants. In defiance of her military advisors, Sin’Yeh sends her former apprentice, Imperial Centurion Galan’Ohn, to defend Earth—though Galan, burdened by the secrets of his past and disdain for humans, would rather leave them to perish. 

The future of humanity and the stability of the galaxy hang in the balance as Wolf contends not only with an alien invasion but also her disillusionment with the government she represents. Sin risks losing her throne at the expense of preserving her values, and Galan straddles the boundary between duty to his empress and his own desires.	

With shades of the expansive world-building of *WAYFARERS* and the existential stakes of TO SLEEP IN A SEA OF STARS, THE SOLSTICE CONTINGENCY, complete at 116,000 words, is the first installment of a sprawling space opera that explores what it means to be loyal to oneself, to one’s people, and the future of the known galaxy.

**FIRST 300:**

The one thing Lisbeth Wolf hated more than having her sleep disrupted, was having her sleep disrupted by paranoid advisers.

She was surrounded by her Secret Service, a collection of highly trained personnel that, unlike her, weren’t allowed to grumble that they were tired. Their footsteps sent echoes through the empty halls. The polished marble floor reflected their shadows in the dim lighting, phantoms whisking between their feet. She glanced at her watch: 04:12. She had been woken by an alert on her datapad just three hours after she finally got to bed. She suppressed a yawn with the back of her hand. The alert had given her no indication of what this “emergency” was.

Ahead of her, two decorated marines saluted and opened the doors at the end of the hall. Wolf inhaled deeply, stuck out her chin and strode inside, greeted with a flurry of chairs pushed out and her advisers rising in salute.

“Madam President, apologies for the sudden alert.” Emery Röscher, Wolf’s personal aide, saluted before gagging into a handkerchief. The phlegm-heavy cough made Wolf indiscreetly turn her head away. Out of the corner of her eye, she could see his broad shoulders heave with every breath, his body appearing to inflate. Röscher’s stubborn refusal to quit smoking his treasured cigars had become a bane to his breathing and he struggled to sit through an entire meeting without gasping for breath.

The oblong council room was uncomfortably warm; the atmosphere felt tense. Wolf scanned the room and her advisers, who all waited for her to make the first move. Multiple empty coffee cups and half-eaten pastries littered the polished cherry wood table. The Security Council had been here all night.

“Get me up to speed,” she said, taking her seat.

“Welcome” I greeted with a bow. The apparition paused, studying my features with a bit of concern. It was not my first time interacting with a World War 2 veteran. I tried my best not to take offense. The ghost seemed to notice the expression on my face and as a result, took his hat off and apologized.

“Sorry, ‘Mam. Bad habits and all that, didn’t mean to stare. Word in the yard is that you sell tea and the like. Do you have joe as well? I have a few clams and always get a hankering on rainy days.”

“I’ll brew up a pot.” I said, prepping the diner-style coffee maker I had bought for the inevitable coffee-drinker in the tea shop. “So, aside from the coffee, what brings you in.” I asked, the question having a different meaning for apparitions than it did for breathing patrons.

“Oh, the usual story. Got drafted, had a dame back home.”

“No bullet holes.” I said, pointing to his uniform. He picked up my meaning.

“You have some good peepers, ‘Mam. A bullet did get me, but that wasn’t what I regret.”

“What do you regret, then?” I asked, there was a long, thoughtful silence and the coffee finished brewing. I poured him a cup. He declined the cream and sugar.

“I had a dame back home, Betsy, a real dish with a great sense of humor. I uh, well this is probably not appropriate to share with a lady, but I… well, we did not have time to tie the knot before I got drafted, you see. And… I… wow, this is embarrassing. Jesus have mercy, I knew my dame, if you follow me.”

“Ah, yes.” I said, hoping he would spare me details.

“You see, I regret leaving her. I knew I had to, but I did not know at the time she was pregnant with our child.”

“Ah.” I said with sympathy. He lifted the cup, the coffee just vanished. “Wait, how am I able to?” He asked in surprise.

“My family has mastered the art of serving the dead. You can eat or drink anything you like in my shop, as though you were living.”

“Well, I’ll be, aren’t you cooking with gas!” He smiled.

“So, back to Betsy, you said she was with child?”

“Yes, a little girl.” He reached into his uniform and pulled out a picture. “Betsy sent me letters, pictures too. I saw things, bad things. But knowing I had Betsy and our daughter back home, it kept me going. Once I got home I could make an honest woman of Betsy. I would be the best darn dad I could be and make it up to my little girl for missing her birth. Unfortunately, there was a bullet with my name on it so to speak at Iwo Jima. I didn’t make it home. Betsy was left raising our little girl alone.”

Silence hung on the air. I pulled out a box of tissues from behind the counter. The soldier was confused at first when he could interact with them, but then thanked me for the gesture.

“So, what is unresolved is Betsy and the girl?” I asked. He nodded. I did the math and figured Betsy probably wasn’t alive anymore, then I looked to the woman sleeping by the fireplace.

“That’s your daughter, isn’t it?” I asked the soldier. I already knew it wasn’t a coincidence.

“How did you know, ‘Mam?”

“Most breathing patrons who would come to this type of place are either in it for the spectacle or because they were visiting someone in the part of the cemetery that wasn’t lost to time.She visits your grave, doesn’t she?”

“At least once or twice a year.” He admitted with a sad smile. “Betsy used to take her pretty regularly after they brought my body back.”

“So, why don’t you talk to her?”

“She can’t see me.” He said sadly, “never could. Betsy never saw me neither.”

“Most people can’t see the dead, not well, unless they have a special gift like mine, or they are near the end.” I said, “But, she will be able to sense your presence here, and that might bring you both some peace.”

“I hate to wake her.” He lowered his eyes. I just gave his hand a light pat.

“It’s time.” I gave him a reassuring smile and he nodded. He walked over, hat in his hand. He watched her napping for a moment and then lightly tapped her shoulder. The woman startled awake, then blinked a few times. Her mouth opened wide, tears streaming down her face. She pulled out a photo from her purse, looked at it, then looked at the ghost, then reached out to hug him. Suddenly I realized why he was called here, why they were both called to my shop tonight. It was more than just proximity to a grave.

I watched them converse, a full conversation as though they were both breathing beings. The businessman was scratching his head, paid the bill and walked off. The young couple were trying not to spy, but clearly eavesdropping on the elderly woman now speaking to what either looked like the thin air or the wispy essence of a ghost.

The soldier then wrapped his arms around his daughter and picked her up. That was when it happened. The body of the old woman slipped down back into her chair, her eyes closing one last time. The image of a five-year-old girl lifted out of the woman’s body and into her father’s arms. They both smiled and laughed as though they were any other family, and faded away from sight, perhaps making their journey beyond to where Betsy waited for them both.

""The Dragon Prince"" has made a name for itself in the realm of animated storytelling, captivating audiences with its rich world and complex characters, while also having the tendency to drop the ball several times, seemingly out of nowhere, to push the plot forward.

This show is truly in a category of it's own, standing tall, looking down at us mortals, and pointing their fingers at us while laughing at our futile attempts to understand it's questionable brilliance. The critics gave this show very fair and unbiased reviews, which is precisely why they gave every single season a 10/10. Even season 4. Nope, nothing suspicious about that. All perfectly understandable as far as I'm concerned.

But fear not my friends, as I'm not a mere helpless mortal constrained by the limitations of the human body and mind. So grab your seats, your magical pens, and some popcorn, because I'm going all in on this one.

**Overview**

Now I've watched all of season 6, and it was a hell of a lot more enjoyable than season 4 and 5. However, Season 6 reveals several writing flaws that undermine its potential, despite showing improvements over the previous seasons. From uneven pacing, to repetitive character arcs, this season highlights the challenges the writers face as they try weave their narrative towards the inevitable finale.

It's no secret this show has had a lot of scrutiny because of it's themes, how it's handled them, the character's motivations, how they've handled certain characters, the bait and switching, amongst many other things. Which is precisely why they made the genius decision to not have any side stories related to season 6 to try and address these problems. Were you upset that a character did something completely out of nowhere, with no build up whatsoever? Well you'll be happy to know that you won't be getting any answers, or backstory to provide you some context.

But the thing that everyone was really looking forward to was a show were characters make incredibly dumb decisions...which leads to predictable results...multiple times...because it's convenient to the plot.

So here we have season 6 of the The Dragon Prince, brought to you by Netflix, the same guys responsible for causing the writers to give us that rushed ending in season 3, because they hadn't greenlight the other four seasons, and the masterpiece that was season 4, a season so great that it was the most negative rated season of them all. With a team like behind the reigns, how could season 6 possible have any flaws at all? All that spirit, excitement and optimism, definitely carried over from season 5. A season that definitely didn't bait and switch the audience with a character that had less than 5 minutes of screentime, who only showed up in one episode, which was her debut episode, and most certainly definitely didn't get ripped to pieces because a certain someone endangered so many lives for a couple of tadpoles.

But anyway, lets get started with the review, and it goes without saying I'm going to be spoiling the heck out of season 6, so if you haven't watched it yet, which at this point I'd be very surprised if you didn't, I'd highly advise you to leave asap, watch it all, then come back here. Or...you know just keep reading and spoil it for yourself.

I originally intended to post this right after watching season 6, but ultimately decided to do it at a later time, after season 6 was watched by more people, and the events that had transpired had more time to settle in. I'm also writing all this taking into account some of the details revealed about season 7 and the beyond.

**Ezran’s Stagnation: A ""King"" Stripped of Growth**

So I'm just going to start with this, as I'm sure many people were expecting to see what my thoughts were on this character this season. I've been literally asked in my messages, what my thoughts were on his character this season and my thoughts on season 6 overall. 

So, has this season fixed Ezran? Did they write him better? Did they fix many of the problems that people criticised about how his character was written? Well...no...no not really. For the most part, he's pretty much the same, and if people really consider Ezran showing Viren no mercy or leniency as shocking, and fresh, then I don't know what to tell you. We've seen Ezran have emotional outbursts, and act cold towards individuals in season 2 and 3 when he feels he's been slighted or his opinions challenged. So seeing him act cold towards Viren isn't really all that surprising. This isn't a ""different side"" to him, this is par for the course him acting like he's acted before. There is a character however who we saw a different side to, and I'll be taking about them later, because they're the best parts of the show.

One of the most glaring issues in Season 6 is the portrayal of Ezran still remains largely the same as he's always been. Despite his position as king, he continues to re-enact the same naïve mistakes without showing significant growth or learning from past experiences, despite the show trying to present that he has. This thematic repetition is exemplified when he becomes a victim of kidnapping by Karim, because he decided to try and use his signature talk-no-jutsu on him, despite literally everyone telling him how much of a bad idea that was. Of course, let's not forget the disastrous consequences for his decision to retain the magical prison within his kingdom, knowing full well there were people after it, and the negative effect it was having on Callum.

The narrative for the most part shows that Ezran's sense of innocence remains unchallenged. Well until the end of the season where he literally loses his kingdom, but until then, he's pretty much just leaving me feeling frustrated as I watch him falter yet again due to decisions rooted in his naive idealism. The creators seemingly missed the opportunity to evolve his character into a more nuanced leader who grapples with the weight of his responsibilities. If you're a king of a kingdom, you can't recklessly endanger yourself or your people. If you're aware of a threat, don't dismiss it. If someone with years of experience tells you something is an incredibly bad idea, DON'T DO IT. But just like the previous seasons, when all is said and done, no one reprehends him for his for actions, not that I had any confidence that the writers were going to do that. Plus it didn't really matter anyway, because not only did no harm befall Ezran, after the whole sunfire fiasco, he pretty much got over everything that happened pretty quickly. May I remind you that Karim's army pretty much got mowed down. Can't say the same about Ezran's kingdom though, heheheHAHAHA.

Moreover, the favouritism towards him, in regards to how his allies of perceive him, and witnessing how it backtracks the show’s potential is disheartening. Inappropriately elevating Ezran’s status or importance to the grand narrative again, because of course we need to make him relevant, with characters like Zubeia refer to him as Zym’s brother, he needs Zym, they're really important, just made me groan. I felt nothing. Like, are they seriously going to neglect and dismiss the other character's significant contributions to Zym’s upbringing and rescue. Why is Zubeia only acknowledging him? This selective acknowledgment not only undermines Callum and Rayla's contributions, but also trivializes the complexity of the relationships within the ensemble that should have been established.

Everyone should have had some kind of close bond with Zym. What's funny is that within that same episode, they were like, Zym has Soren, someone who has a big heart, and then do absolutely nothing with that. Like why did they even bring that up? If they're not even going to try and establish some kind of relationship between them? What's funny is that Soren has actually interacted with Zubeia, and it was very well received. People really liked it. It felt very believable. Organic. Intriguing. They wanted to see more of that. Glad to see they did absolutely jack with that.

The issue extends beyond Ezran’s singular experiences, bleeding into how other characters are portrayed throughout the season. For instance, the season attempts to show Ezran grappling with his attitude toward Viren, yet this evolution seems inconsistent. His struggle leads to a frustrating cognitive dissonance: while he holds a grudge against Viren, he is willing to extend forgiveness to Avizandum, you know the dragon that caused so much pain to his family and kingdom for years, and by extension Zubeia, you know the wife of the dragon who was perfectly fine with letting Avizandum do his thing until the humans retaliated and killed him. The rationalization behind his selective empathy raises questions about the principles he champions and further underscores the problematic writing choices that have characterized this season.

Ezran’s kingship's, and relevance in the story as a whole, is portrayed as more critical than it truly feels, lacking the earned respect from his peers and proven incapability's in making difficult decisions. All in all Ezran was pretty much a nothing burger this season, if anything it's like the show only showed him at several intervals to remind us that he still exists.

**The “King” Who Wouldn’t Learn**

Ezran is presented as the ambitious young king, yet despite his royal title, one can't help but question whether he actually learned anything from his previous escapades. It feels less like character growth and more like a rerun of a sitcom we’ve overstayed our welcome in. This season, we witness the naïve ruler taking a hard left into Troubleburg when he decides to keep the magical prison—yes, the one that is practically a beacon for evil-doers—right in the heart of his kingdom. Did he think that maybe one of his enemies wouldn’t take a little field trip to check it out? “Oh, look! A mystical prison! What’s the worst that could happen?” Spoiler: Everything.

And it’s not just the magical prison! How about the kidnapping by Karim? Talk about a plot twist we saw coming from a mile away. Poor Ezran could’ve been wearing a shirt that said, ""Kidnap Me!"" and it would’ve been just as effective. It’s like the writers thought, “Let’s let him repeat his mistakes one more time; the audience will love it!”

**Zym: A Character Reduced to a Plot Device**

Ezran's bond with Zym, while initially heart-warming, when it wasn't something that they made just exclusive to the two of them, has devolved into a forced dynamic that drains Zym of his potential as an independent character. Where Zym could have been explored as a unique individual, he is relegated to a supporting role solely to maintain Ezran's relevance. The writers missed a prime opportunity to pair Zym with each of the main cast whose journey could have interwoven in a way that deepened the narrative. The interplay of human-dragon relations, particularly against the backdrop of Callum’s journey of self-discovery, could have yielded a world of thematic exploration, rather than resorting to simplistic storytelling that diminishes Zym’s character to that of a mere plot device.

Now, let’s address the mind-melding phenomenon. At what point did it become acceptable to let a last-minute plot device waltz casually into the scene like a surprise guest at a party? This entire concept felt thrown together, likely on a napkin during the writers’ lunch break. It’s like they looked around and said, “Hmmm, how to keep Ezran relevant…ah! Let’s (conveniently) allow him to communicate with Zym on a whole new level!” Because, you know, no one wanted to see Zym develop into a fully realized character with agency.

And what of Ezran’s supposed moral growth? Let’s remember the bit where he opts not to forgive Viren while still fawning over Avizandum, the dragon whose past actions resulted in some rather fatal outcomes for Ezran’s mother. How do we reconcile that? “Equality—only when it’s convenient!” It’s like trying to eat soup with a fork; it just doesn’t work, and it leaves everyone frustrated and confused.

Sure, Zym hatched in the first few seasons and produced some cute moments, but instead of allowing him to grow and explore his own story, the show treats him like a plot device tethered to Ezran's narrative. As if existing in the world of Xadia isn’t enough for him, Zym is effectively overwhelmed, trapped in the role of Ezran’s emotional support dragon. Spoiler alert: that’s not a job title that sets any creative sparks flying.

**Pacing Problems: The Tortoise and the Hare... in Slow Motion**

My fellow Dragon enthusiasts, if there’s anything worse than being served a lukewarm cup of coffee, it’s a season that drags its feet like a tortoise in a marathon. Season 6 showcases pacing issues like they're going out of style. There are points where scenes feel like they’re stretching their legs for a snack break. “Hey, let’s bask in the beauty of this landscape for an extra five minutes!” Meanwhile, the story is as compelling as a three-hour PowerPoint presentation. The pacing problems compound the writing flaws. When the show finally starts to build momentum, it often slams on the brakes for moments that could have been succinctly handled with a brief nod and a quick quip.

**Did We Want Romance or Speed Dating?**

The awkward escalation of Rayla and Callum's relationship left a trail of confusion. One minute they’re battling monsters and trying to save the world, next their broken up, then their keeping their distance, and the next they’re suddenly declaring their undying love while the audience is left saying, “Wait, what happened?” It seems the writers decided to hit the fast forward button without asking if the viewers had their popcorn in hand. The moments that should have turned into poignant reflections on their individual journeys instead turned into a whirlwind of “I love you’s” that felt more like a rushed promise than a meaningful declaration.

Imagine telling your best friend about this season only to express your utter disbelief: “So there I was, watching as these two basically went from ‘Hey, wanna camp out for survival?’ to ‘Let’s plan our fairy tale wedding!’ in record time!” Where’s the tension that builds a solid relationship? Where’s the witty banter, the moments of hesitation that actually makes sense, the delightful awkwardness that's believable and not forced? Instead, we received a series of conversations that revolved around feelings without much substance.

**Characters First, Romance Second**

In the grand tapestry of storytelling, character development is king (or queen, or dragon – let’s not be exclusive). Rayla and Callum both started this epic journey as fully realized characters, but their intricate journeys became increasingly defined by their romance. Rayla, once the embodiment of fierce independence, started to dissolve into a puddle of emotion over a relationship that felt like it was tacked on rather than earned, as if someone yelling “happy ending” in the script meeting meant they had to rush through it all.

Meanwhile, Callum’s inner battles—his insecurities, aspirations, and magical mishaps—that should have been given their fair share of screen time were overshadowed by his relationship with Rayla. What were once rich, engaging plotlines turned into a sort of theatrical pantomime of their love life. Imagine asking Callum about his magical journey, only to receive a thoughtful pause while he fumbles for words about how Rayla makes him feel. *Sigh*. I mean, come on! Can’t we have a little grown-up discussion here without it spiralling into love songs?

**The Multi-layered Complexity We All Crave**

It's almost like the writers took the notion that “romance sells” too literally. And through the haze of romance plots, Rayla and Callum lost their agency and complexity. Their individual stories felt side-lined, like extra toppings that didn’t quite make the final cut on a pizza. Instead of savouring the deliciousness of finely layered character development, we were served a flatbread with a smattering of “Rayllum” sprinkles and a hint of missing potential.

Let’s not kid ourselves; both characters have the capacity for significant growth—just imagine Callum truly wrestling with his identity! Instead, we are left with a situation where their internal struggles have been hijacked by overly sweet cinematic moments. If the writers had taken a bit more time to develop the interpersonal dynamics organically, we’d have found ourselves charmed, rather than scratching our heads in confusion.

**Soren: The Shining Beacon of Writing**

Let’s give credit where it’s due! In a season littered with clumsy character arcs and hastily scribbled dialogue, Soren stands out like a bright, blazing bonfire at a particularly well-lit festival. His journey towards understanding his complex feelings for his father, Viren, was well-earned. There’s something almost poetic about a guy who, for once, isn’t just continuously cast as the comic relief in a circus of angst.

However, while Soren’s relationship with Viren is written well—a relatable father-son tether woven with feelings of betrayal, alienation, and a fair amount of existential dread—other potential relationships fall hilariously flat. Soren could have had an intriguing bond with Zym, the opportunity was just sitting there (because who wouldn’t want a dragon as a best buddy?). And Zubeia? C’mon, writers, don’t pretend she’s not sitting there waiting for her shot at some meaningful dialogue.

Instead, Soren's friendships are treated like paper bags in the wind—floating aimlessly with no aim or substantial grounding. One can’t help but wonder if the writing team has a secret vendetta against meaningful connections, opting instead to let Soren’s excellent character traits fester in isolation. “Hey, don’t worry about that budding friendship you could have had with ( insert dragon character ). Let’s just throw in some more angst!” Sounds about right.

**Viren: The Zombie Character**

Now let’s specifically zero in on Viren’s character arc because he deserves his own soapbox—and not the kind you shout from, but the one you use as a bouncy castle. Season 6 attempts to re-cast him in a light of grim acceptance and questionable benevolence. It’s clear the writers wanted to give him a grand send-off, but they might as well have draped a cape over him and had him dramatically swoop out the door kicking and screaming. Wouldn’t it have been more poetic to see him come to terms with his failures last season and die there, so the emotional impact of  his death would be felt this season? Did we really need to watch him step into the fiery abyss and embrace those wrongdoings, which we know he's already acknowledged like a true tragic hero? It’s as though they said, “Actually, let’s hit pause on that narrative arc, just for a bit of bang and flash!”

What do we get instead? A series of awkward goodbyes and emotional reckonings that feel tacked on, like sprinkles on a bland cupcake. The effect lacks that satisfying “You’ve earned your fate!” payoff that we were all waiting for, in a way that actually felt earned. Now, instead of a nice crescendo of character growth, we get a cacophony of ‘meh.’

Last season, we experienced a cathartic crescendo. Viren appeared to have reached the end of his deeply complicated journey—a dude grappling with what he has done before. I mean, come on, the man literally ruined many lives, including but not limited to his daughter, his son, the princes, a good portion of Xadia, and a large number of other victims. Instead of giving him a poignant exit, where he could confront his past and embrace the tragic narrative—he is suddenly resurrected for the sheer purpose of having a dramatic send-off in Season 6, which in all honesty wasn't really needed.

This return felt forced, like his character development was trapped in a dragon’s lair and forgotten. It would have been more meaningful for him to stay gone in the previous season, allowing his prior actions to have weight and consequences. Instead, we got a rushed redemption that couldn’t even garner a sympathetic glance from me.

**When Supposedly Smart Characters Do Stupid Things**

Let’s kick this off section with a bang—our beloved Rayla. Oh, Rayla! The Moonshadow elf who, despite having all the charm and charisma one could muster seems to have forgotten all about the myriad ways that Aaravos has proven to be manipulative.

In a truly eyebrow-raising decision, Rayla allows Callum to switch Aaravos's prison alone with a fake without blinking an eye. Seriously? This is the same Aaravos who has had a fantastic track record of weaselling his way into everyone’s psyche, effortlessly swaying minds while he’s literally imprisoned in a pearl. She literally witnessed him control Callum like a puppet. The last time I checked, “sleepwalking” towards the villain's prison spells a metric tone of trouble, but Rayla apparently decided that brushing it off as a bad dream was a better approach than, say, a genuine conversation about keeping Aaravos's prison far, far away from Callum. Or have someone watch Callum like a hawk. Or maybe have a powerful Archdragon keep Callum safe...oh wait sorry, I forgot, plot convenience prevented that from being an option.

Well, what happens next? Predictably, the prison *stays* where it was—just like my last attempt at finding where I left the remote and Aaravos ends up freed by Claudia, likely leading to all sorts of delightful chaos in season 7. Honestly, you have to appreciate the audacity. ""Hey, let’s not take this threat seriously while there are puns to be made and time to waste!” Great strategy, team.

**Ezran and the “Talk-no-Jutsu” Chronicles**

Now let’s shine a spotlight on Ezran ( again ), our young monarch who's got a heart as big as his dreams and a brain… well, let's say it's more of an aerodynamic shape since it tends to take flight, and is most of time empty. So, what does Ezran do? He decides that chatting up Karim, the villainous, racist, arrogant commander, might lead to a peaceful resolution, when it's so obviously a bad idea. Because when in doubt, why not take the diplomatic route? What’s the worst that could happen, right?

Spoiler alert: Karim takes Ezran hostage. There’s a moment where one can’t help but wonder whether the world’s finest diplomats are attending a lecture on how to be taken hostage effectively. This is a classic case of introducing the “talk-no-jutsu” trope, where the power of dialogue triumphs over swords—somehow failing to recognize that a sword to the gut, or bringing someone to their knees, typically trumps a heartfelt speech about feelings.

Naturally, as per the laws of plot conveniences, Ezran’s allies. on the Sunfire elf side at least, miraculously don’t suffer due to this grand moment of decision-making brilliance. Was it really to much to ask to have Sol Regem cause casualties for Sunfire elves and the citizens of Katolis? Apparently so. They couldn’t possibly be harmed, after all. Why? Because this is *The Dragon Prince,* where plot armour is thicker than a dragon’s hide and it seems like all these rules of storytelling apply directly to Ezran. Need a conflict resolved? Just have Ezran show up and everything will be peachy keen. I'm willing to bet if Ezran was there when Sol Regem attacked Katolis, some universal power would be at play to somehow turn things towards his favour.

**Viren’s Fathering Skills: A Masterclass in Bad Decision-Making**

Then we have Viren, whose parenting skills are, let’s just say, non-existent in this season. He’s just been resurrected and sees Claudia, his daughter, in a state that can only be labelled as “unstable at best, potentially terrifying at worse.” So, what’s Viren’s big plan? To leave her alone while he faces the music of his crimes, instead of making sure she's mentally stable first.

Good call, my dude. Absolutely fantastic decision-making. It’s not like Claudia has shown any signs of emotional turmoil that could potentially lead to more chaos—or heaven forbid, the release of an ancient evil, that he knows is manipulating events behind the scenes. Nope! Instead, Viren’s exit leads to their final conversation, like a bad sitcom that gets cancelled before any character growth can ever happen.

As a result, Claudia, heartbroken and even more messed up than before after finding his dead body, decides to release Aaravos. Bravo, Viren! You’ve not just created a family drama; you’ve accidentally launched a villain’s best comeback tour. The emotional rollercoaster has delivered us right back to the very cycle that keeps the series spinning. If only he had taken a moment to hold her hand and say, “Hey, maybe staying together for a bit would be a good idea” But alas, common sense is in short supply.

Also I'm not sure how exactly the writers expected us to feel sympathy for a man who essentially mentally abused his own son, for things that were outside of his control. Soren was literally ostrisized by Viren through no fault of his own. Killing yourself for a kingdom's worth of people to save them from danger, doesn't suddenly redeem you, and absolve you for all the horrible things that you did. 

**The Vexing Morality of the Series**

First off, let's tackle the elephant in the room: the show's idea of morality. Honestly, can someone explain the logic behind Viren’s wife’s dramatic characterization? The writers seem to want us to see her as some tragic, misunderstood figure, when she was quite literally willing to let their son, Soren, kick the bucket. I mean, this is not a plot twist or a device for character development; it’s more like a kick to the face of common sense.

Here’s the crux of the matter: Soren was on the verge of meeting his maker, yet his mother was torn — not because of her love but over some magical mumbo-jumbo that demanded her tears so Viren could save him. Apparently, tears are worth more than a son’s life. Really? Are we to believe that the river of tears she’d have to shed was just too much to ask? But wait, she leaves him anyway because, heaven forbid, he uses dark magic! That's right: save your son using dark magic, and you’re the villain. Honestly, if anyone deserved a classic ""You're dead to me!"" from the afterlife, it's her.

**Dark Magic: The Convenient Plot Device**

Ah, dark magic: the show’s favorite dark horse! The script tries its hardest to convince us that dark magic is the epitome of evil, akin to stepping on a LEGO brick during a midnight excursion. But here's the twist: dark magic has been the unsung hero of humanity! Let’s ponder this conundrum, shall we?

* It healed Soren’s paralysis as if it were a magical form of duct tape.
* It's literally the only reason why Soren is even alive, and his grim reaper ticket ended up invalid.
* It prevented mass famine, like that one friend who brings snacks to the party.
* It allowed humans a fighting chance against Xadia’s prejudice, like the underdog rising to the occasion in a sports movie.

Confused yet? The sheer irony that the very power responsible for saving lives is painted as the villain is richer than a chocolate cake in a bakery. Dark magic has the potential for depth — think of the layers like an intricate lasagne, but this show just serves us the cardboard box it came in, leaving us bewildered as we try to process why dark magic is just “bad.”

It's troubling that we are still expected to view dark magic as a purely evil force when it has been the knight in shining armour for these bipedal struggles against the colourful elves and dragons—who, might I add, seem keen on letting humanity flounder in dire straits. The same show that highlights the horrors embedded in dark magic glosses over critical questions like: “Do the ends justify the means?” and “Are humans so barbaric for wanting to defend themselves?” Seriously, the dialogue plays like a broken record of morality set in black and white.

**The Mystery of Sol Regem: A Dragon Who's All Smoke and No Fire**

When Sol Regem was introduced way back in season 3, we thought we were in for an exciting new player with multitudes of character development, some fresh dynamics, and lots of dragonsplaining about the world of Xadia. Instead, we got a glorified backdrop, stretching into the walls of seasons 4 and 5 like that guest at a party who loiters around the snack table, hogging all the chips and failing to engage with anyone. He was, I declare, a nothing burger.

Mere moments before his predictably tragic end in season 6, the creators dropped a smorgasbord of lore that would make even a determined dietitian’s eyebrows shoot up. “Surprise! We have some fascinating facts about Sol Regem!” they proclaimed as if they were presenting a new dessert to a surprised birthday party. But really, what good is revealing these things when he has just seconds to live? You wouldn’t throw a 25-page biography at a birthday cake!

Here’s a quick overview of the lore dump:

1. **Real Name**: Sol Regem’s real name is Anak Arao. Thanks for the info, but what does that do for us now?
2. **The Blind Rage Incident**: He kills his mate and, plot twist! He didn’t even know it until Aarovos told him. Great insights into his character just seconds before he cashes in his chips.
3. **The Jerky Dragon**: We find out he has been a complete jerk to humans since his juvenile dragon days. Yep even when he was the Dragon Prince, he just decided that humans where inferior. Seriously, does that ever make a character charming?
4. **Leola's Execution**: He ratted out Aarovos’s daughter for teaching magic to humans—so he’s basically responsible for every tragedy that's transpired within the series, but just now, at death’s door, it becomes convoluted lore!

And then, there’s the ultimate kick in the tooth: he experiences a tragic end while accomplishing pretty much nothing. Aside from burning down Katolis, where he manages to ruffle some feathers without proving any real threat or securing any notable kill count, his grand finale isn’t even a bonfire roast. It’s a sad ‘choking-to-death-on-an-innocent-elf’ scenario mixed with a side of internal fire self-immolation. Talk about an embarrassing exit!

What good does it do the audience to find out that Sol Regem’s real name is Anak Arao and he was a prejudiced dragon who played a pivotal role in humanity's suffering—all five minutes before he turns into dragon ash? The writers certainly seemed to think we needed to know that this guy had a narrative of blind rage and non-existent self-discovery right before closing the book on him. It made me want to scream, ""Too little, too late!""

His disdain for humans is so deeply ingrained that one can’t help but wonder if his social skills were learned from a Dragon-Dictionary of Hate 101—with “smite them” as page one! Sol Regem ratted out Aarovos's innocent daughter, Leola, who merely taught humans magic, to the Startouch Elves for, you guessed it, being ""too generous."" Was this dragon raised in a castle of misogynistic dragons?

Was this the writers’ idea of a character farewell? It’s almost as if they thought, “Let’s cram in 15 episodes’ worth of backstory and character development into the last 30 seconds of his life.” Bravo, *The Dragon Prince*, bravo.

The lack of backstory in his life choices leaves more questions than answers. Who needs closure when your character has a “the end” that’s more of a “what was the point?”

https://preview.redd.it/63woq6pd0txd1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bc443aa9af764d115f7a38e7988eb1312a4ee04d

**Callum and Sol: A Missed Opportunity of Epic Proportions**

Speaking of missed opportunities, let’s talk about Callum. Here we have a brilliant character who embodies everything Sol Regem claims humans cannot be. It’s a classic case of a senior dragon getting schooled by the plucky young human, which could have been the hallmark of his entire arc! Imagine the rich dialogue, the philosophical debates, and possibly Sol Regem’s jaw dropping to the floor in disbelief as Callum continues to weave magic without the usual backstory baggage.

But instead, these interactions never happen. Instead of exploring this goldmine of character chemistry, we’re left with Sol Regem flying around like a glorified flaming balloon animal. Sol Regem's potential isn't just wasted; he represents a perfect cocktail of narrative disappointment—a kind of tragically comedic performance that would be better suited for a slapstick cartoon than this supposed epic tale of magic and adventure.

Perhaps instead of wasting time with uninspired plot threads, the writers could’ve shifted their focus to the dazzling possibility of these two characters clashing. The narrative could have been enrichingly complex, a veritable treasure trove of nuanced storytelling! But alas! We will never know what could have been because the writers opted for the Archdragon to just be jerk for the sake of being jerk instead of trying to develop unique character interactions.

**The Crime of Compassion: Aaravos's Daughter**

Let’s discuss the tragic backstory—a staple so generic in storytelling, you could find it in a bargain bin alongside knock-off superhero comics. Aaravos’s poor daughter, Leola, gets executed for the utterly heinous crime of showing humans kindness. Can we get a collective “huh?” here? What a world where empathy gets you killed faster than lightning spells.

Now, this is where the writers throw their logic out the window. The elves and dragons, in all their superiority, couldn’t handle the idea of a humans receiving a little compassion. They determined that giving magic to humans was, what, a “violation of cosmic order?” If cosmic order doesn’t allow for empathy, then it might as well be papering the walls of the writers’ room because it’s clearly just a plot device—one that didn’t survive the first draft of a screenwriting class.

**The Final Showdown: Will We Ever Get Closure?**

As we inch closer to what promises to be a spectacularly chaotic final season—which will likely resemble a last-minute school project thrown together at 2 a.m.—the question remains: How do the writers plan to wrap up this convoluted mess in just nine episodes?

Breaking the space-time continuum would be far easier than moving the convoluted plot threads into a satisfying resolution. Is there a chance they’ll opt for a last-minute revelation that will tie everything together? Or will we witness a culmination so bewildering that it would make even David Lynch raise an eyebrow?

Unless the writers plan to pull a rabbit out of the hat—or, in this case, a dragon out of the sky—they face the daunting challenge of providing some form of resolution that feels earned, which if I'm being entirely honest with you, is simply not possible. Should we brace for disappointment, or should we try to guess the fast passes and quick fixes that they'll use to try and finish this season?

To make matters worse, with the final season looming on the horizon, the pacing has nowhere to go but down the proverbial rabbit hole. You can almost hear the frantic typing of the writers, desperately cobbling together climactic resolutions in just a handful of episodes. How they plan to wrap the sprawling narrative in just nine episodes is beyond comprehension, but given their track record, we’ll probably see a fusion of poorly executed clichés, philosophical musing, and abrupt plot twists just to tie it all together.

https://preview.redd.it/3x9ya7e81txd1.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10bca38effd187b67b1f6196478da7bf0c49fa35

**When Hope Meets Reality: What Does Season 7 Promise?**

Now that we’ve dissected season 6’s many writing flaws, let’s face the chat; what’s next? Future seasons? HAHAHA, lol, absolutely not! Let’s pull our heads out of the cloud of wishes and realize that when it comes to continuing this story, we’ve more than likely reached a potential dead end.

The cardinal rule of storytelling? Always write with an end in sight. You can’t wing it and then act surprised when the audience is left with more frayed plot threads than a cat with a yarn ball. There’s such a thing as beating a dead horse, and that horse is truly looking sorry if the creators are contemplating more seasons post-season 7.

To think that I’d get invested in their world again after the multitude of disappointments? They’ve had six seasons to make their case, and boy, did they squander that chance faster than a dragon can burn through timber. The characters stagnated, focused on the mundane instead of developing rich arcs, and left me twiddling my thumbs, eagerly awaiting resolution without any sincerity.

And what about the characters? How can they continue to develop, when they’ve already been boxed into clichés that project less character growth and more “But wait, the plot needs us to be this way!” Ground-breaking stuff. Perhaps they'll create another mess where the Archdragons continue to elevate Ezran’s status to seemingly ludicrous levels. Seriously, he might as well get a medal for being the ""Best Plot Device Ever.""

Could Callum and Rayla spiral further into the depths of relationship clichés while we wonder if they’ll ever find their own identities? Or maybe the humans would just keep “making it up” to the other factions without having any true consequences of their past actions. Ground-breaking storytelling right there!

**Misleading Expectations: Promotional Material Gone Wrong**

Speaking of promotional material, let's get real. The show has developed a curious knack for marketing that leaves viewers feeling more duped than a pawnbroker at a garage sale.

Remember all the buzz around Domina Profundis and her supposed importance to Season 5? I certainly do. The reality? She had less screen time than a character on a holiday special for a side dish (and let’s be honest, we all know the side dishes deserve just as much love). With a few minutes of Ezran doing all the talking, her presence fizzled out faster than you can say “misleading trailers.”

The marketing team must have been spending too much time munching on dragon fruit, because the promise presented is far more exciting than the delivered content. Season 6 pokes and prods at some storylines with bold, sweeping gestures but retreats into a cozy bubble of “status quo” whenever they inch too close to genuine change.

https://preview.redd.it/e9ndawjo4txd1.png?width=791&format=png&auto=webp&s=09fab4da646f66675cbb7db7052e35db9f28d2fe

**Conclusion: The Order of the Disheartened**

In conclusion, while it would be easy to suggest continued seasons for *The Dragon Prince*, I must firmly state that more isn’t always merrier. Season 6 gave us glimpses of improvement but failed to escape the yawning void of pacing issues, reliance on tired tropes, and character stagnation.

If the storytellers could do the honourable thing and keep the narrative tight while addressing past mistakes, perhaps they wouldn’t have to worry about whether they’re beating a dead dragon—or whether the audience will finally roar back in approval. So let’s raise a cup of cocoa to what the show was and what it could be again. Until then, I guess I’ll be sharpening my critique sword and preparing for the next round!

After she met him she came home and told me about him, I didn’t care, felt happy for her. However as she went on she said he was a lot like me, like he looked like me, but with tattoos. Which for her are a big thing, she thinks guys with them are really hot and has told me before. She also mentioned them having a lot in common and being into a lot of the same things. Again I was happy, if a little jealous at the thought, but I ignored it. I don’t like to bring up those thoughts I have because I know it’s not fair for her to not be able to express herself and have friends. But they’ve been chatting for while over text and messager, and she is on her phone a lot. I don’t want to ask to see it because I know I should trust her, and while I have had moments where I looked at her phone whims she’s not in the room, I never leave the Lock Screen. I know I would if I knew the password which is why I asked her not to tell me, to prove her I want to trust her, and to not feed me getting paranoid. The issue is she brought up to me that she was asked out to coffee by him, which got me off guard, especially since how soon it was, and how she’s been really standoffish of me. Getting mad more often, and shutting herself in our room, and locking me out for several hours. I notice a change and it’s upsetting because this happened before. 

 We had a mutual friend who I didn’t know had actually been with my wife prior to us getting together. And while I was okay with him talking to my wife and trying to use it to reignite our friendship, he never made an effort. Only texting my wife and asking to hang out. I mentioned how I didn’t like him ghosting me and the fact he wants to hang out with just her. And my wife was willing to go, despite me saying o would’ve liked all of us to be together and her saying it’s fine. I said I didn’t feel comfortable and that I didn’t want her going because I had a bad feeling. Her response was I was trying to keep her trapped and she’s allowed to go out, and that I’m guilt tripping her into staying because I never go out. I prefer to stay home and aside from work I try not to leave home to be with her and our kids. She added that she was going anyway and wouldn’t hear any more of it. I genuinely considered myself single for a day or so, preparing for that final argument. Instead she came crying to me saying he thought it was a hook up not them hanging out, and she was upset. She said he only wanted her for her body and that this is why she has trust issues. She’s been cheated on before. 

 Instead of telling her I told her so, I comforted her, but she didn’t say sorry for what she said. Instead she kept readding him on Snapchat, telling me she was doing it, and saying it was to show off how happy she was. I didn’t care because she told me, and she knew what he wanted, and honestly I didn’t care if she added him. I felt assured enough that nothing would happen, especially because he’s the type of guy who spirals and tries to get with old hook ups over and over again. I’m worried this is that situation all over again, and I’m ever more worried it’s not, and something will happen. 

 My wife has done things I don’t approve of before, including posting risky photos on her Instagram after she made me delete mine because she couldn’t trust me. She felt self conscious because I was following attractive women and felt it made her feel inadequate and insecure. So I deleted it for her to prove she could trust me, and she went and posted photos I disagree with. Worst part is she doesn’t know I know those pictures are on there. Out of paranoia I redownloaded Instagram and wanted to see, and found out what she did. Worst part was my name wasn’t in the bio, she did have a couple of photos of me but none since I deleted the app. She also hasn’t noticed the feature that says when I was last online in the DMs meaning my profile is probably pretty down on the list. Which I can’t blame given it was a while since I had been online so naturally she should’ve messaged people already. It just feels bad when it all gets piled together. 

 So All this together, when my wife asked me about the coffee, I said we’ll talk about it later, just let me do one thing. I had some other work to do at home for a side project I’m doing, and when I was done we can discuss it, but I still feel uncomfortable even if I want to trust her. She said it wasn’t fair for me not to trust her and I brought up our friend from before, and she said this isn’t the same, and chose to ignore me. I’m currently trying to deal with what to think. 

Last bit of context, we aren’t married but we’ve been together for 5 years, live in the same house, share income, and have children together, none of which are older than 13. (She had kids from a previous relationship but they’re 100% mine. I’ve been in their life longer than their bio dad and love them so much, even if they can be frustrating)

 I hope this helps you guys help me figure out what to do",17,1730257279.0,relationship_advice,52,0.79,False

I've just been getting *shaken* over things that shouldn't bother me.

I am not here for therapy. I am here because I am looking for answers, I think. I've been teetering on the precipice of seeking religion? Or spirituality? Even debated trying to learn martial arts or something. I'm casting my net wide. Not sure what to do, but I think my mind is begging me to do something. 

I know a bit about Alchemy. I know that you value truth above all. What would I have to gain from going down the path of alchemy? Is it a path worth exploring? Is it a solution for me? Is that even a good question? I'm lost right now.

All I can say is, it did not disappoint! It’s phenomenal Vietnamese Ice coffee. One of the stronger/ more robust coffees I’ve tried and probably one of the best coffee I've tried to date. 

If you like your coffee on the sweeter and creamier side, their most popular drink (also my favorite) is the Hanoi Egg coffee. Sounds weird if you’ve never heard of it but it’s amazing (and does not taste like egg LOL). The egg cream is an important addition because the coffee is that strong. I would highly recommend visiting. It gets busy some times and I can tell they are working hard there to accommodate everyone.

Hi. So I’m turning to Reddit to see if anyone has any info, help, advice, anything. I’m located in California (LA) if that helps with providing a resource I may be unaware of. I would really appreciate it. 

A family member of mine has not slept very much in almost a month. They have said they’ve slept at most an hour or two per night, sometimes nothing at all and constantly drinks coffee or energy drinks and are constantly overworked. 

So recently, about a week ago, they started having what the hospital described as some sort of “delirium” probably due to lack of sleep. I’m not sure if they have other mental health diagnosis, but their mom told me they have sleep apnea but refuse to get help for it. 

They have started having what I would describe as “episodes”? I’m not sure the proper word to use, so please forgive me. They’ve been talking all sorts of nonsense, blowing up at people and doing things that are extremely unlike them. They’ve been blowing up at their mom every day (they live with them) and will verbally abuse her at any given opportunity, unprovoked. Basically, their behavior is the complete opposite of what it normally is. They refuse to get any help, their parents have looked into resources but they all said they have to voluntarily ask for it.

When their parents were able to convince them to go to the hospital, when the staff asked them if they wanted help, they refused. So because of that they said they couldn’t evaluate them since they’re an adult. All of the resources their mom has tried said the same thing, since they’re over 18 it has to be voluntary. 

At this point their mother is terrified they’ll do something to harm themselves or others since their behavior is so erratic or that something may happen behind the wheel since they’re so sleep deprived. They took the keys to the car when they had hidden them, but they found them and took off to school. 

They have been telling peers that they don’t want to go back home because they can’t stand seeing their parents. 

At this point we don’t know what to do. I know they haven’t harmed anyone yet, but their behavior is becoming increasingly worrisome as the days go by. 

If there is any help or resource, recommendations, anything, please, I’d love to hear it.

Thank you so much.

This is where I don’t really know how to explain it.  It’s like I went to sleep, but I could still feel myself laying there while I was having a dream.

It was a very strange experience.  But the dream was super real and I felt like I was conscious during it.

Secondly, I have not been paid or otherwise incentivized to write this piece other than purely out of my own free will.)

I walk into the white interior of the Los Angeles Arts District coffee shop. The nutty smell of coffee mixes in with the sweet smells of the pastries in my nostrils on this wonderful 70-degree day that’s Southern California’s autumn signature. People are seated around the interior on pine benches and tables, some working on sticker-bombed laptops, while others have quiet conversations over a variety of beverages. I take my place in the long line to the cash register. I see a young man approach, and I can instantly spot him after seeing him on social media so many times before: Wes. He’s holding a clear cup filled to the brim with an iced black coffee, and in the other hand, a black hard-shell case. I wave and introduce myself, as he gives me a firm handshake.

We magically find seats in the busy shop near the back, and we sit together around a cup of joe. I’m fairly excited as he places the case on the table and opens the lid; inside: the entire current Nodus lineup. We pull one watch out after the other, discussing the design language and the features on each. He points out bestsellers and the different little micro-details of each watch. I am definitely enamored by the Nodus Sector Sport with the salmon dial, a beautiful example of excellent finishing and simplicity with enough complexity to keep my eye on the dial. The Contrail GMT with its bold splash of complementary colors and sapphire bezel keeps my eyes darting to it. And the Sector Deep Destro Polar, with its crisp geometric lines and clear legibility is a wonderful tool watch I can’t help but handle again and again. I am reminded quickly how difficult marketing and photography in the watch world is, as it is very challenging for two-dimensional images to capture the true spirit of watch designs, displaying their depth, color, how the light catches the diverse surfaces. As excited as I am to see and handle all these beautiful timepieces, I am here to meet the man behind the brand, as opposed to the watches themselves, which have already received heaps of praise throughout the microbrand world.

The conversation starts fairly mildly, we recount our own backgrounds and the watches we’re wearing. I have on a Waldan Heritage Sportline on a crocodile strap, a relatively attractive Ameriquartz watch out of New York. Wes is wearing the Sector Sport that I’ve been eyeing for the past year or so. As the conversation moves from the watches on the table to design language, we both recover from the initial awkwardness of meeting a stranger and begin to open up significantly. Wes is very easy to talk to, and he has a warm, relaxed ability to make you quickly lower your guard. We discuss the signature style that Nodus has cultivated over years of releasing different models, as Wes, alongside his in-house engineer discovered more and more about what makes the company’s offerings stand apart. The conversation flowed fairly easily, and we covered, in no particular order: microbrands in the space and the tight-knit community that it is; the amount of travel that Wes puts in every year to promote the brand; Wes’s heritage, and his recent reconnection to it on his trip to Singapore for a watch event; our upcoming and past travels to Europe; upcoming events for Wes, including Intersect LA (which I will certainly attend!); manufacturing in the US, and the measured steps the industry is taking to get there; the difficulty and reward of building a physical product, and the failures and successes to get there; self-help and ongoing education; the challenge of not comparing our own successes to others; the novel I am currently working on; upcoming models and ideas for products and features; patenting the Node-X bracelet design; the growth pains of a small-to-medium business and the challenges growing companies endure; the design challenges of making something as intricate as a watch; belief in oneself and following one’s own path; Wes’s studies in Boston and his music background; the company’s success, team, and collaborative efforts; the intricate way life takes us outside our plans and on an adventure; my upcoming wedding; work-life balance and delegation in leadership, along with new challenges a leader finds themselves in; our gear-head interests (I’m a motorcycle guy, he’s a car junkie); my military days and his father's Navy background.

I’ve barely scratched the surface of the entire coffee-shop talk, but I found Wes to be a very genuine, transparent, and hungry young man, with a bright future ahead of him. He’s well-educated and well-spoken, yet continues to hunger for more learning and personal growth. Before I knew it, we had spent two hours chatting, and it was time to go. We shook hands, and Wes encouraged me to visit Nodus at Intersect LA next year (which I will). Wes, thank you so much for taking the time today out of your highly busy schedule to sit down with a complete stranger and have a great conversation, and I hope to meet you again soon! As for your watches, you have a customer in myself. If you’re reading this, keep at it, you’re killing it!

I’ve recently started intermittent fasting (IF) and have been following it for the past three days, having only one meal a day—lunch. However, since this is my first attempt at IF, I’ve found myself feeling hungry during the mornings and evenings. To manage this, I’ve been snacking on a small amount of peanuts during breakfast and dinner. Throughout the day, I also consume black coffee around three times to stay energized.

My main question is: Is it okay to have peanuts during these non-eating windows, or should I skip them to optimize my weight loss? My wedding is coming up in December, and I’m working hard to get in shape. Currently, I weigh around 78-79 kg, and my target is to reach 66-68 kg in the next 45 days. Any tips or advice to help me achieve this goal would be highly appreciated!

Thanks in advance for your suggestions!

1gfc4x6,https://www.reddit.com/r/phlgbt/comments/1gfc4x6/i_moved_on_too_quickly/,I moved on too quickly?,"For context:

I (25/M) and my ex (26/M) was in a 3 year relationship, he ended the relationship on august and was due to us not being able to make time with each other anymore. Ultimately it all boiled down to we never saw each other eye to eye anymore. And I admit I wasn’t the best boyfriend at fulfilling his needs, but what I realized, is that I did try my best to keep the relationship afloat, given the circumstances and what tools I had available to work with during that time. Sadly it wasn’t enough.

So what did I do? During the first week of the breakup i tried to win him back, said that things would work out differently this time, but looking back I don’t think it will, emotionally unavailable na rin pala kasi kami parehas sa isat isa, I cried and I resented him dahil nakahanap kaagad siya ng panibago, I wallowed for 3 weeks straight, then, I had the realization that I just had enough of crying, kaya nag leave ako sa work that day, oddly enough the first thing I did was go to the dentist, nagpalinis ako, pinaayos ko yung mga nasirang pasta ko, and yung tumatatak lang sa sarili ko was “bakit ka pa rin umiiyak? For what? Isang month na lumipas ah” don ko na realize na I was starting to prioritize myself.

So, I went on a date with myself, nag foodtrip ako mag-isa sa binondo, It was lonely, but also therapeutic,plano namin yon na mag binondo for a foodtrip but hindi nangyari. I also had the habit of running after work, after ko tumakbo, tatambay ako sa favorite coffee shop ko and nag vevent ako sa kanila, other than that I also had my friends online, kahit paulit-ulit ako mag kwento sa kanila, hindi sila nagsawa makinig sakin, I didn’t even try to make my ex the villain, i always tried to tell the story in an objective way, sinasabi nila ako daw nasa tama but I didn’t think naman na ako lang ang tama, I had to take into consideration what his side was, sa totoo lang naloka ako trying to understand what was the reason bat nakipagbreak siya sakin, but I think looking back, I didn’t have a reason to, hindi rin naman ako nag shy away into processing everything. I was keeping myself busy and at the same time, I allowed myself to feel all these emotions.

Fast forward to now, my chest feels lighter, people say that I’m blooming, and sa totoo lang hindi ko na siya naiisip, wala akong any amount of resentment, galit or any ill will sa kaniya, all I want is for him to be happy, may mga moments na nasasabi ko nakakamiss naman may karelasyon, but hindi ko muna time para magkaroon ng panibago, I have to take this as a lesson na i really have so much to improve para masabi kong ready na ako mag date ulit. Still have a lot of healing to do to become the best version of myself that I can share with others.

This commemorates the 2 months post breakup with the guy that made me realize that love can break you, but also build you up again, but for now I will choose myself.
