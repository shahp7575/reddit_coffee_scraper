1izaxao,https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/1izaxao/trapper_buff_idea/,Trapper Buff Idea,"If a survivor steps into one of his traps, no matter what health state they are in, they will become downed, and the trapper will see their aura for a few seconds. Survivors can see auras of traps near hooked survivors. Trapper can pick up a trap from far away every so often, but not while in chase, and he still has to place them down like he usually does. The manual (direct trapper interaction) trap setting sound is silent, so if trapper is indirectly resetting a trap, the trap will still do the usual sound effect. If a survivor is caught in a trap, the survivor will have to take a guaranteed amount of time (10 seconds) before getting out of it by themselves. If another survivor is there to help them, it will take 5 seconds to get them out, and the trapped survivor will have still taken a health state no matter what (that means from injured to dying if they were caught injured). However, the survive who healed them may get a small boost in healing that specific survivor for a few seconds (40% faster for 10 seconds). If a survivor helps, the helper will also have their aura revealed. If a survivor is already downed from a bear trap, and is still in the dying state, when another survivor steps into a bear trap, they will take half the time to get out of the trap, and may become injured (or in deep wound if was already injured), but will not be downed. There are two separate abilities: resetting traps from afar, and picking traps up from afar. Picking up a trap from afar will be a 20 second cooldown. Resetting a bear trap from afar will also have a 20 second cooldown. The trapper cannot pick up a bear trap from afar in chase. Trapper no longer has a maximum carry capacity. Survivors take 10 seconds to disarm a trap. Traps have a 2 meter low noise that plays constantly. 

Addons: 

Iridescent 2:
————————
Tension Spring: is now an iridescent addon, and resets after two seconds after a survivor escapes from it no matter if they were rescued, or got out by themselves. 

Bloody Coil: If a survivor steps into a bear trap, the trapper is undetectable for 35 seconds. 

Very Rare 4:
—————————-
Oily Coil: After resetting a bear trap, the last survivor to disarm or escape from it is revealed for 5 seconds.

Veteran Jaws: Causes Hemorrhage, and Mangled for 90 seconds. Causes Deep Wound.  (Lengthened Jaws, Serrated Jaws, and Rusted Jaws combined). 

Trapper Sack: Increase time to escape by yourself by 10 seconds. 

Brass Knuckles: His father’s brass knuckles that he would use to beat his employees. After setting or resetting a bear trap, you break and vault 17.5% faster for 10 seconds. 

Rare 5:
—————————

Secondary Coil: Increases time to disarm a bear trap by 6 seconds.

Trapper Bag: Increases time to rescue a survivor from a bear trap by 5 seconds. 

Tar Bottle: Darkens the appearance of bear traps. 

Stick of Dynamite: “Accidents happen”. After escaping a bear trap the survivor suffers from oblivious status for 60 seconds. If there is a survivor that rescued them, the survivor that helped also suffers from it. 

Fatty Piece of Rabbit: Father had a rigorous, aggressive instinct, and the apple didn’t fall very far from the tree. After hooking a survivor that was downed from a trap, the next gen you kick will be blocked for 20 seconds. 

Uncommon 5:
—————————

Ripped Sketches: “Once broken, a human is a tool that can be wielded to do anything. Broken. It’s what he did to Evan’s mother, it’s what he’s doing to him. But Evan still sketches, sketching is defiant”. If a survivor disarms a bear trap, that survivor will suffer from Exhausted status for 30 seconds. 

Father-Son Picture: A picture of his father standing blankly behind him. You set traps 25% faster. After setting down a trap, all windows are blocked within 16 meters of you, and you move at 4.4 meters for 20 seconds. 

3:

4:

5:

Common:
—————————
Coffee Grounds: Gain an additional 5% movement speed for 5 seconds (on top of the 7.5% for 5 already) after setting a bear trap. 

Padded Jaws: If a survivor is caught in a bear trap, the survivor will suffer no injury whatsoever, however, the trapper will gain a 15% bonus in speed for 10 seconds, or until the trapper hits a survivor.

1izawov,https://www.reddit.com/r/scottishish/comments/1izawov/the_trimming_crew/,The trimming crew,"The Trimming Crew

The air in the trimming room was thick. Heavy.

Sweet with the scent of fresh-cut buds.

MAC 1.

The smell clung to their clothes. Their skin. The backs of their throats.

Rich. Creamy. Like vanilla butter. But sharp. Diesel fumes and citrus. A bite that stung the sinuses.

And underneath it… something else.

Something damp. Earthy. Wrong.

It wasn’t just a smell.

It wrapped around them. Seeped into their lungs. Sat too thick on the tongue.

And beneath the buttery vanilla, beneath the citrus and spice, there was something rotting.

Something watching.

The crew worked in silence.

Scissors snipping. Snicking. Wet sounds that echoed too long.

They had been here for a week.

A week.

Trimming for a grower who paid double their usual rate.

Now they understood why.

They had worked together for years.

Greg, the manager. Always talking to the growers. Always making deals. Lately though, his meetings had been getting longer. He’d come back different each time – clothes pristine but skin waxy, movements jerky like a puppet on strings.

Tom, the joker. The one who kept things light.

Lisa and Sarah, best friends. Always together.

Mark, the quiet one. Not much to say, but always watching.

And Eric.

Eric knew things.

Eric had only been with them for a few months, but he knew everything.

The best way to trim. The science behind the strains. How to tell if a plant was off.

“See this bend?” he’d say, adjusting Lisa’s scissors. “That’s a sign the plant wasn’t flushed properly. The grower must’ve cut corners.”

When Greg started missing meetings, showing up hours late with no memory of where he’d been, it was Eric who covered for him.

“Probably just stressed,” he’d say when Sarah asked about the strange noises coming from Greg’s office. “This job gets to everyone eventually.”

“You guys worry too much,” he’d say “this is a building full of weed it should be a happy place” when Sarah whispered about shadows moving in the corners.

“Old buildings make weird noises.”

And they believed him.

Because why wouldn’t they?

But things weren’t right.

Sarah noticed the buds twitched. Not from static. Not from moisture. They… moved.

Mark found symbols carved into stems. Tiny screaming faces when held up to the light.

Tom stopped joking after cutting himself. The cut refused to heal.

Greg stopped eating during breaks. Just sat there, staring at nothing, his skin stretching and contracting like something was moving underneath. When he did speak, his words came out wrong – consonants twisted, vowels drawn out too long. Sometimes his jaw would work silently, as if practicing unfamiliar movements.


No one wanted to be the first to say it.

But they all knew.

Something was wrong with the building.

It was watching them.

Listening.

Tom was the first to break.

They were in the break room, a small, windowless space with a fridge, a coffee maker, and a table covered in snack wrappers.

No one had been hungry lately.

Then Lisa saw something inside the coffee machine.

It wasn’t mold.



It was pulsing.



“Guys… what the hell is that?”



Eric inspected it. Calm. Too calm.



“Fungal contamination, probably,” he said. “I’ve seen this before. No big deal. Just don’t touch it.”



His certainty soothed them.



Even when Greg’s skin began to ripple beneath his clothes.



Even when Sarah swore she heard the walls breathing.


Tom stirred his coffee. Slowly. Staring at it.

The others were quiet, waiting for him to speak.

“I’m not crazy,” Tom said finally.

The coffee in his cup moved.

Not sloshing. Rising.

Dripping upward.

The black liquid stretched toward the ceiling in a thin, trembling thread.

Tom dropped the cup. It shattered on the table, spilling coffee that never hit the floor.

The liquid crawled up the walls instead.

Mark shoved his chair back. “Jesus Christ!” he screamed.

Lisa covered her mouth. Sarah grabbed her wrist.

Eric, sitting across from Tom, didn’t flinch.

He sighed.

“We’re all just exhausted,” he said. Patient. Calm. “Trimming this much, for this long? It messes with your head.”

He leaned forward. Smiled.

“Drink some water homie. You’ll feel better.”

Tom stared at him.

At his smile.

And for the first time…

Tom didn’t trust him.

Greg wasn’t in the break room. Hadn’t been seen since morning, when he’d locked himself in his office. Strange sounds had been filtering through the door – wet, squelching noises and a low, constant hum that made their teeth ache.

They should have checked on him.

Should have noticed sooner when the sounds stopped.

But they went back to work instead. Trying to pretend everything was normal. Trying not to think about what was happening to their manager, their friend.

Then it happened.

Sarah’s scissors hit something solid inside a bud.

SNAP.

Clear fluid sprayed across her face.

It burned like acid. Her skin instantly blistering beneath the liquid. 

She screamed.

The bud split open.

And something inside it… blinked.

The crew crowded around.

Staring.

Not breathing.

The bud was full of eyes.

Human eyes.

Familiar eyes.

“Those are…” Eric’s voice was steady. 

Lisa’s stomach lurched. “Janet.”

She knew those green eyes.

Janet had taken a trimming job here six months ago.

She hadn’t heard from her since.

And now… she was here.

They weren’t trimming marijuana.

They were harvesting something else.

A figure stepped from the shadows.

It wasn’t hiding anymore.

It was wrong.

A twisted mass of stems and leaves and human parts, grafted together into something unnatural.

It jerked forward in impossible angles.

Leaving behind a trail of spores.

Spores that whispered their names.

Lisa 

Sarah 

Tom 

And Greg Stumbled into the room …

Greg was no longer Greg.

His skin split open like overripe fruit.

And inside…

Tendrils.

Tendrils that had been wearing Greg like a suit.

“We don’t need to leave,” Greg said.

But it wasn’t just his voice.

It was many voices, many tones and accents.

Speaking from mouths that opened across his body. 

“We belong here now.”

The crew screamed.

The walls closed in.

The lights went out.

And in the darkness…

They finally saw the truth.

The facility was alive.

It was one massive organism.

And they were being digested.

Their screams became part of the whispers.

But one figure did not scream.

His movements were too smooth.

Too calm.

His uniform, now clearly visible, bore a logo none of them had noticed before:

“Lovely Ladies Who Trim.”

He stepped away from the writhing mass.

He pulled out his phone. Calmly. Casually.

He typed.

“Got another crew for you.”

He smiled.

A warm smile.

A friendly smile.

“The Ladies are eager to start. Same rate as usual?”

Behind him, the thing that had been his crewmates pulsed and whispered.

Eric had played his part perfectly.

As he had so many times before.

Because after all someone had to, feed, the garden.

1izawm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1izawm1/am_i_25f_selfish_or_being_gaslit_by_a_friend_23f/,Am I (25F) selfish or being gaslit by a friend (23F)?,"I [25F] recently had a friend [23F] over for a small celebratory dinner and in the middle of it she suddenly said that because I spend a lot of time alone I am not used to thinking of other people’s needs and am stingy. For simplicity I will refer to her as M.

For context I do often feel socially delayed for various reasons I don’t want to dive into. While I know I am the older one on the relationship I have lost many years in social experiences.

M really helped me out during a hard time, and since then I wanted to show my appreciation and demonstrate how much I care about our friendship. When she helped me move I bought her lunch, paid for her gas. She reflected on this as Only being because she helped me.

Whenever she visits I take her out for coffee which I also cover. This isn’t something I do for people unless I really like them. However, one time when I was visiting her I had a migraine and asked if we could stop for a coffee. She then gave me her order for me to buy as well and I don’t know why but I was little offended at what I felt was entitlement to me buying her coffee and she picked up on it. I still bought it for her but she described it as me not really wanting to.

She also brought up the fact that when she brings up food for us to eat I send her home with dirty dishes which makes her feel bad. However this was because the last time she had me clean it she literally just left everything on the table including trash and went home, which made me feel upset because I was left with a cleanup chores by myself.

She also mentioned that when I said “Good thing, I’m glad” to her fostered cats being adopted it was inconsiderate. But I feel like she forgot how I tried convincing her to adopt because she clearly loved them. She firmly denied wanting to care for them and even said she once left them alone for a week, which made me feel like she was not ready to care for them long term and so it was “good” that they found a different home. 

M capped it with saying stingy isn’t just about money. I don’t treat other people the way they want to be treated I treat them the way I want to be treated (like buying a gift you would want for someone else). And something about this felt wrong, like being told what I’ve tried to do to express gratitude wasn’t enough. I can’t mind read people. If she had said something like “Can we clean the dishes together”, rather than “Can you clean these dishes” I wouldn’t have said no.

M has said other things that have hurt me because it feels hypocritical. She’s commented on my appearance, and judges my taste in a lot of things. But at the same time she goes out of her way to gift me care packages when she knows I am upset.

I am at the point though with M where it feels like I cannot vocalize or prioritize my own emotions. A very recent example that stands out only because of how small the issues were was I sat down in a seat at a restaurant and she wanted it so I had to give it up. Then later I go to pay but this time the bill is really large so she stopped me solely for the reason of collecting the points. I feel like this is wrong, it doesn’t make me feel good because of the context of her words. But if I voice it I fear she will then say I am only thinking of myself again.

I don’t want to be selfish in my mid twenties I want to be a giving person who is considerate and empathetic. I really tried hard to show my gratitude towards M. But I have limits for what I am comfortable giving in any relationship. And it doesn’t feel right to be told that if I truly loved her I would ignore those limits and do what would make her happy anyway.

1izav24,https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/1izav24/how_i_cured_my_cfs_maybe_this_can_help_you/,How I Cured My CFS – Maybe This Can Help You,"I want to start by saying I’m not a doctor. I don’t have any medical degrees or licenses—this is just my story and the result of years of trying to figure out why I was **chronically exhausted, had gut issues, and terrible brain fog.**

For years, I was sick. It started in 2019 when I suddenly developed a gluten intolerance. At first, I had no idea what was making me randomly sick all the time. But even after cutting out gluten, I kept getting sick, and it just became my normal. I figured I was just unlucky and didn’t make any major changes beyond avoiding gluten.

Then, two years ago, it got worse. **I could barely get out of bed, I was sick all day, and my brain fog was brutal.** I had no energy, no motivation, and no idea what was happening to me. A year later, still sick, I convinced myself it was **mold toxicity** and went all-in on detoxing. I took every supplement imaginable, thinking each new one might be the magic fix. **But I wasn’t getting better.**

One night, I watched a documentary about a guy with a chronic illness who decided to drink **only juice for 60 days** to heal himself. In the film, he’s talking to people in a diner in the Midwest, asking if they would ever juice full-time. Most say no, but one guy really stood out. He was overweight, eating pie, and talking about his **severe diabetes.** He said he knew it was killing him, but he **just couldn’t stop eating sugar.**

For some reason, it hit me—he was literally saying he had no control over his own hands. **But to eat the pie, he had to pick up the fork.** That moment changed everything for me. I had been binge drinking alcohol on the weekends for years. I’d tried to quit over and over but always went back. But that night, I realized if I was saying I *couldn’t* quit, I was basically saying **I had no control over my own hand, which has to pick the drink up, in order for me to consume it.** So I took control of my hand. I quit drinking that night and never looked back.

I also started **juicing** after watching the documentary, and that’s when I realized just **how addicted to processed food and sugar I was.** I went **90 days drinking only juice**, and for the first three weeks, I felt **unstoppable.** I had **limitless energy, mental clarity, and I felt like I had unlocked something.** Then—**boom.** Out of nowhere, I started feeling sick again.

I couldn’t believe it. I thought I had healed myself. But at the time, I still believed I had mold toxicity, and many of the supplements I was taking were designed to **force detox**—which is stressful on the body. Looking back now, I see that my body finally **got a break** when I quit alcohol and processed food. **It was finally able to rest.** But I screwed it up by **pushing too hard with detox supplements,** which threw my body right back into stress mode.

But I didn’t know that yet, so I kept taking more supplements, convinced that the next one would be the cure. **None of them helped.** The only one I actually felt a difference from was **magnesium.**

Then one day, I stumbled upon **Wim Hof.** If you don’t know who he is, he’s a guy famous for extreme cold exposure and breathwork techniques. I started doing his **breathing exercises, and they actually helped.** That led me to research **why**, and I discovered the **vagus nerve**—which is the key to getting your nervous system out of fight-or-flight mode.

I started doing **ice baths**, and suddenly, I wasn’t tired anymore. **The brain fog lifted, my energy came back, and I started feeling like myself again.** That sent me down a rabbit hole on the **nervous system and how it gets stuck in survival mode.**

Basically, when you experience **prolonged stress or trauma, your body gets stuck in fight-or-flight mode.** Instead of returning to a relaxed state, it stays in **high alert**, constantly pumping out stress hormones. It doesn’t matter whether the stress comes from war, an abusive household, or years of non-stop anxiety—**your body reacts the same way.**

For me, that stressor was **2019** when my health issues started. I had a greenhouse business and sold nearly **half a million dollars worth of product.** Then, my supplier tried to screw me over. **I had furious customers calling me constantly, cussing me out, threatening me.** I barely slept for **months.** To my body, it was life or death. **It kicked me into survival mode, and because I never did anything to pull myself out of it, that became my default state.**

Once I realized this, I started **focusing on my nervous system** instead of supplements. I cut back on almost all of them—except magnesium, which I still take every day. I focused on:

* **Stimulating my vagus nerve** daily (breathwork, ice baths, humming, cold showers).
* **Getting out of fight-or-flight mode** (meditation, spending time outside, staying off stress-inducing social media).
* **Staying present** (reading *The Power of Now* by Eckhart Tolle, which helped me stop getting lost in past trauma or future anxiety. Both of which keep your body in fight or flight, because your body reacts like that past trauma or future anxiety is happening in the present. It doesnt differentiate).
* **Eat healthy** (only eat whole foods, give up processed food, especially sugar, its horrible for you and keeps your body in that fight or flight as well. Trade coffee for ceremonial grade matcha. Squeeze a lemon in it if you dont like the taste of matcha)

Now? I have **more energy than I’ve had since I was a kid.** My mind is clear, and I feel like I actually **got my life back.**

I just wanted to share my story in case it might help someone else out there. **Stimulate your vagus nerve, get your body out of fight-or-flight mode, and you might see a real difference.** I know some people will disagree with parts of this, and that’s fine. **This is just what worked for me.**",0,1740643722.0,cfs,1,0.33,False

Some of you may know me from JNMIL. If so you'll remember that my wife walked out on me last week. Today I found out why. She stopped paying the bills that were in my name in November. 

Today I recieved a letter from my power company that states I must pay 338.00 by February 10th or my power will be put on a limiter which means I won't be able to run my heat or cook. 

I can pay back 100$ at the end of February and then the remaining 238$ plus 75$ interest when I get my tax return in March.",1,1740643707.0,borrowdeletes,1,1.0,False

Her straight brown hair lifts gently in the almost-summer breeze. Striped blue-and-white shirt, beige shorts, gold earrings—she has adopted a style the kids call “old money” on social media.

She thinks briefly about taking her iPhone out to get a shot of her latte. Yet, the elaborate drink remains untouched as she stares at a speck of ash floating on the frothy surface.

She lights a Camel Light, the taste of burnt chemicals invading her palate. The smoke drags a memory out of her—adolescent summers spent smoking Vogues at the beach in Brittany, the salty air sticking to her skin. *How on Earth did I survive on these?*

Last night, her fiancé’s hands had felt like rubber gloves. Diana had rolled to her side, pretending to drift off while her eyes fixed on the white closet doors. Months ago, Simon had promised he would request a transfer at work. A fresh start in Biarritz would lift the heavy veil of chronic dissatisfaction she seemed to be entangled in. A move to the fancy coastal town, she thought, would be beneficial for her relationship as well.

But words, like promises—and milk in a coffee mug—had a way of dissolving. And she stopped hoping.

The man she’s waiting for is twenty-five minutes late. On the app, his profile showed a blond, self-assured venture capitalist with a watch worth more than her car.

*""*Usually very busy*,""* he’d messaged, as if his busyness made him holy.

She sips her latte and decides, evidently, he’s forgotten the date.

She trots toward the overpriced underground parking lot where her Mini waits. *God, these leather loafers are comfy.* Reformation never disappoints. She starts the Mini and lights another cigarette as she eases onto the busy streets.

“If it rains tonight, I’ll leave him,” she says absently, watching a springtime thunderstorm forming through the windshield. “If it stays clear, I’ll stay.”

A sign flashes WORK AHEAD, and the orange glow of temporary lights stretches into the distance. Traffic slows to a crawl.

Her mind drifts as she calculates she’ll probably be late for the dinner planned with her fiancé’s family. Simon’s mother will be annoyed, though she’ll never say so outright. She doesn’t mind missing the endless rants about the craftsmen blocking parking spaces.

Somewhere on her right, a green neon light flickers to life in an apartment window. Brushing a strand of hair back, her bracelets tinkling, she mechanically presses her foot down on the gas, sliding slowly into the intersection.

The excavator seems to materialize out of nowhere, its heavy metal arm swinging into the road.

In the morning, an old man walking his dog collects a bracelet, a tad flattened but intact, five meters from the intersection. Frowning, he holds it up in the sun like evidence.

1izaqx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1izaqx0/i_want_to_enroll_in_a_kickboxing_class_wife_has_a/,I want to enroll in a kickboxing class - wife has a meltdown,"TLDR: After years of not paying attention to my health and suffering the consequences, I've been going to the gym and I'm better, health-wise. I mention to my wife I want to add kickboxing classes to that, and she throws a tantrum.

Full story: Throwaway account here. I've (42M) been married to my wife (40F) for 10 years - no kids, just two dogs. For most of those 10 years, we've been doing well financially, so money is not an issue here. A couple years ago, I decided that I had had enough of the corporate life and decided to pursue a doctorate. She was against it at first, but she knew how much I was burnt out from my career and since I was pursuing a doctorate that would pay decently in academia after completion, she eventually gave me her blessing. Leading up to this, we had our little arguments here and there, but we were doing fine.

We had to move for my PhD, which was stressful for her, since it was a change in surroundings and as a severe introvert, she doesn't try to make new friends at all (still absolutely no friends since we moved here). I'm an introvert too, but I'm more social and quite used to networking when I was in corporate, so I'm fine socially. While the transition meant I had to take a steep pay cut, she happened to get a new job that paid more than her old one. Our new combined finances (her salary + my stipend) are 65% of our old income, but we're still at six-figures living in the Midwest (not Chicago), so we still live pretty comfortably.

The first two years when I was doing my PhD coursework were difficult, as I had been out of school for awhile and catching up with others really required me to put in the hours. My wife, during this time, becomes much more controlling and needy, at least from my perspective. The threw a tantrum in the midst of my finals at least once, requiring me to reach out to my professor and ask for an extension so I could take my wife shopping and calm her down. Apparently, according to the school therapist, that's a form of academic abuse. Furthermore, I needed to put in many hours for reading, but my wife would constantly nag me about going to sleep, even though I'm most productive during the late night, leading to more friction in our relationship.

Giving credit where it's due, she's been solid on certain aspects, since we have chores which we're each a bit better at. She does nearly all the laundry (not that one of us does this better, but she remembers to do it more frequently than I do) and cooking. She loads the dishwasher, and I unload it and wash the items that can't go in the dishwasher. I do all the floor cleaning (vacuuming and mopping) and dusting. She's the dominant breadwinner now, and I credit her for that whenever it comes up in conversation. We split the responsibilities for the dogs pretty evenly, in my opinion, but she's mentioned she feels she does more. We both feed the dogs, but she takes the dogs on walks whereas I'm the one getting up in the dead of the night, every night, to let the dogs out, but she doesn't know since she doesn't wake up from it.

But during these couple years, we start to drift apart. I've tried to make sure that we still get time together between dinner and her bedtime, but our good communication has decreased whereas our bickering has increased. Furthermore, each time we have a disagreement, the only way she gets over it is if I say, ""I'm sorry, I was wrong; you were right."" She's also made condescending remarks a few times when I've struggled in my program, leading me to not share what's going on in my academic life. The impact my martial issues was having on my mental health was so pronounced, I've been seeing a therapist for the past half year. Recently, I was emotionally distant for a period because I was bottling up too much, and my wife noticed. She asked what was going on, so I couldn't hold back anymore and I shared a bit of a past difficulty I had with a supervisor. She was surprisingly understanding (although she did say, ""I would've handled it this way instead""), and suggested that we should be more open with each other. A week later, I suggested maybe we do couples therapy to increase our openness and communication, and she threw another tantrum. It wasn't exactly unexpected, since many, many years ago I had asked her opinion about couples therapy in general (not us), but she said she didn't believe in it and if it came to that for us, we should just divorce. So I guess her opinion on that didn't change.

Prior to my PhD, I wasn't necessarily athletic, but I was pretty fit: gym few times a week, seasonal rowing team. During my two-year coursework, I did none of that, and coupled with sitting in front of the computer for hours and hours on end, my back was in such bad shape I was suffering chronic headaches from the pain radiating from my back. The last couple of months I've been hitting the gym regularly again and I suggested a month ago that I wanted to enroll in kickboxing as well to increase my overall range of motion. At the time, she suggested I wait a bit, since she wasn't sure if I could stick to a new fitness routine. That was fair, I thought, so I set out to show that I could stick with the gym first. Going 4-5 times per week for the past 1.5 months, 1-2 hours per session, I'm now back to my pre-PhD fitness levels, so I decide to tell her I'm planning on signing up for kickboxing. She effectively melts down and says (yells) I'll be gone for 5 hours per day just for exercising. I respond that while kickboxing is in the evenings, it is only 1 hour long, 2-3 times per week, and I'll shift my gym hours to the early afternoon while cutting back on time and frequency, as a healthy balance of the activities will be key to preventing over-exertion. She says then she'll move back to China and take dance classes there since they don't have the dance classes she likes here in the US and stormed off into the bedroom and screamed into a pillow. This is literally the first time she's mentioned she wanted to take dance classes, so I'm having a hard time believing she's even looked at what's offered locally.

I'm just confused at this point because I'm not sure if I'm being selfish or if she's being controlling and needy. Am I being selfish by going overboard with my health goals? Maybe the gym is enough? In the past, she got upset if I stayed up late or drank too much coffee, saying it was bad for my health. I'm trying to do more fitness things for my health, better diet, more non-caffeinated hydration, but it seems like I should only do things that she pre-approves. I admit, I greatly value independence (it's why I left my previous career), so perhaps I'm the one going too far? People tend to be blind to their own faults, so before I point the finger at her, I want to ascertain if I'm in the wrong here and maybe missing something. Especially since we also have infertility issues, I don't want this issue to be inadvertently inflated in my mind as a result.",1,1740643214.0,Marriage,1,1.0,False

1izanil,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mindfuse_app/comments/1izanil/what_if_we_could_spent_all_time_wasted_on_social/,What if we could spent all time wasted on social media actually connecting with people. (Mindfuse Explained),"This is the problem Mindfuse solves. Mindfuse is a platform we built to offer an alternative for people who are fed up with endless scrolling and are looking for something deeper. Consuming social media/content is something you do passively and leaves you drained more often than not. That should not be the case since all social media platforms are meant to connect people.

I envisioned all people in the world, instead of scrolling all the time, actually talking to each other. When on the bus, for example, or just in a coffee shop next to each other, instead of this being the case, everybody is just staring at their phones the whole time, isolating themselves with headphones.

Mindfuse is a platform that aims to replace all moments you spend alone, wasting time on feeds or other content, with real-time one-on-one global conversations. Imagine all that time spent having conversations instead. This would change the way you interact with the world massively and would take you out of isolation while also freeing you from feeding the big tech companies by giving them your time, your only time.

Alright, let's dive a little deeper into Mindfuse.

The app is live, and for now, it's iOS only. Sorry for that. I wanted to focus on one platform first, but in hindsight, that might have been a mistake. Android will be dropping soon.

Mindfuse does everything differently compared to mainstream social media platforms. Mindfuse has NO likes, NO followers, NO algorithms, NO profiles, NO ads, NO feeds, NO visuals, NO filters, and Mindfuse is anonymous because we believe it doesn't matter what you look like, it's about what you are saying.

Mindfuse has one function. You press the ""Start Fusing"" button, and you will be connected to another member of the community over AUDIO, and then you can just speak about whatever you like. When you are done, you can just hang up, and you will never know whom you spoke to unless, of course, you told each other.

This platform will be an easy target for misconduct, so we are going to have to put our trust in the community, of which we are confident will be able to maintain a safe space. Other measures we took: a small subscription fee of $4. You pay with money, not with your time. We don't run ads, we do want to keep existing and offer the highest quality conversations to you. This subscription fee will also keep the really annoying people out. We only want users who believe in our mission and vision.

Since we are assembling a community of early adopters, we can't be live 24/7 yet. So we will pick a designated time for all of us to speak with each other to see if the tech keeps standing and whether we actually like talking to each other. Eventually, of course, Mindfuse will be live 24/7, so you can have a nice global conversation whenever you like.

These conversations could be about anything you like: sharing recipes, talking about what's on your mind in your personal life, the newest Quentin Tarantino movie, just sharing a laugh together, or talking about culture.

Drop a like and a comment if you are willing to become part of the Mindfuse community, and let's connect! We are curious to hear about you and your stories!

I figure i should start with a little background before the issue from the other day, starting positive and all that jazz.

I am a system, 50% or so of the system members are UI and sometimes that seems to include myself, but not all the time, mostly it seems that i 'inherit' this trait temporarily for a minute or so (which if i come back halfway through wetting, at that point there's really no point in trying to stop it, nor do i think i could) based on who fronts and quickly switching happens, i'm not sure if this is medically understood at all ether. 
We are autistic, and i, and maybe everyone else in my system, has bathroom anxiety due to me being trans, and also from issues related to constipation as a child, which were never really resolved and after a while was brushed off by doctors.
Given the last point, i defaulted to going in nappies while at home after a while, purely to avoid the confrontation of a blocked toilet. And that is still true now as we're in shared accommodation.


So anyway, on to the main point i was meaning to post about. This happened a few days ago and i'm still a little embarrassed.

I was in the library at my uni doing work fairly late into the night, and so drinking a lot of coffee, and my diet the previous few days probably didn't help me ether since coffee is normally okay for me. I stood up to go grab some water and as i was about half way done filling up the water bottle with almost no warning i messed myself. I tried to hold back my embarrassment until i had filled up my water bottle, then promptly power walked back to my desk, and packed away my things and went to find somewhere suitable to change. which involved going down multiple flights of stairs, out the library to the other side of the uni campus to an accessible toilet.
as soon as i locked the door and practically threw my bag down, i burst into tears then calmed down a little and changed, then i got a lucozade from the vending machines to cover electrolyte loss went home after that ordeal.

I am glad it was late and there weren't many people around, and based on some reading i've done on this sub, i will be adding plastic pants to my daily wear too. Luckily our current nappies, better dry, seem to be reasonably good and hold up well.

I do think this is probably related to something being off in what i had eaten before, 2 or so days before  i had a chicken, bacon and leek pie, that i'm pretty sure was slightly under-cooked, as my flatmate turned off the oven at some point during the cooking time and wasn't sure exactly when, and i got impatient waiting for an additional 40 minutes. Or maybe its from the week pat the use by date milk i was using up? Or both possibly? i'm not sure.

I felt better after the fact besides feeling a little sick, but that passed by the time i got home.

I'm not too sure why it was so overwhelming considering i go through the motions at home anyway, i'd guess less control over the environment and the fact that it was an accident?

I just needed to get this off my chest more then anything. I hope you all have a nice later part of your weeks though!",2,1740642445.0,Incontinence,0,1.0,False
1izakqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyUnsentLetters/comments/1izakqa/goodbye_to_my_situationship_im_getting_married/,Goodbye to my situationship. I'm getting married.,"Dear M,

I still vividly remember how we met. It was an early morning, and I was waiting for my colleague. Maulan nun, madaling araw. I was at a convenience store at a gas station, umorder ako ng coffee and umpo sa labas while waiting. That's when you approached me and asked if you could join me. We chatted casually. Madaldal ka, madami ka tanong and of course tinanong mo if single ako, to which I answered YES. You asked for my number and even dialed it to ensure it was correct. Dumating yung colleague ko, and we went on our way. After a few minutes, I received a text from you, and our connection started from there.

At that time, I had just come from an 11-year relationship and was in the process of moving on and healing. Wala pa sa isip ko ang mag boyfriend ulit. Magulo pa ang puso at isip ko. But you pursued me relentlessly, and I eventually gave in, unknowingly entering a situationship with you.

You treated me like a princess, and I fell for you. I was happy when we were together, though it sometimes hurt me to think that you weren't ready to commit. You were already 38, stable in life. I asked you about our status many times, and you assured me that your intentions were pure, suggesting we just enjoy each other's company and just go with the flow, masaya lang, hahah! This led our situation to last for almost 4 years.

However, I have this friend who cares so much about me, who is ready to commit and is sure of me. He proposed, and we're getting married. I'm in my early 30s, and our parents are pushing us to settle down and start a family. Initially, I was hesitant because it was you I wanted to spend my life with. Honestly, I cried so hard about my decision. But since you didn't have plans for us and we didn't even have a label, I've decided to move forward with him. I will love this man, I’m excited to build a life with him.

I need to cut ties with you now. I hope and pray that someday you'll find someone you want to settle down with. I'm sorry if I kept many secrets from you; I didn't feel the need to share everything because our relationship didn't have a label. We simply enjoyed each other's company.

Please take care of yourself.

1izag9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diffuser/comments/1izag9d/pure_essential_oil_diffusers_safe_to_inhale_or/,Pure Essential Oil Diffusers: Safe to Inhale or Just Aromatherapy Vaping?,"Can one safely inhale Pure essential oil diffusers? I recently stumbled into the Pure diffusers, which sell themselves as aromatherapy tools. Claiming to be nicotine-free, they look like a vape pen but actually contain essential oils, vitamins, and other components such melatonin or caffeine. Although the concept of breathing these components sounds interesting, I worried about whether it would be really safe to do so straight into my lungs.  
The official website emphasizes the advantages of ""aromatherapy"" but refutes explicitly if these should be inhaled deeply. Although conventional aromatherapy entails releasing essential oils into the air for passive inhalation, these diffusers generate a visible vapor, which gives the sensation more like vaping than passive smell dispersion. The primary worry is that breathing in essential oils or other compounds straight into the lungs can irritate or have long-term consequences for health. Many professionals caution against breathing essential oils in this manner since the lungs are not meant to handle oil-based compounds. Long-term exposure to oil droplets might cause respiratory problems; more study is needed on how breathing molecules like melatonin or vitamin B12 through vapor alters the body. Should these components be indeed helpful when inhaled, more medical research confirming their potency is probably under way.  
Another question is whether breathing these diffusers even offers the supposed advantages. Melatonin, for instance, is usually taken up by digestion rather than breathing. While breathed caffeine may have a brief stimulating impact, its actual potency is unknown when compared to drinking coffee or swallowing pills. If most of the vapor is expelled right away, very little of the components could be really getting into the bloodstream.  
After struggling with sleep, choose to utilize a Pure diffuser loaded with melatonin rather of a tablet. Expecting to feel sleepy, you puff a few times. After thirty minutes, you don't feel much different; the vapor tastes good and the process of breathing seems soothing. You question whether the melatonin is a placebo effect or if it is really functioning. In the meantime, you still worry in the back of your mind about whether long-term breathing the vapor could harm your lungs.  
Although these diffusers have pleasant tastes and feel like vaping, inhaling vitamins, essential oils, or other chemicals straight into the lungs raises serious concerns regarding safety. Stick with conventional techniques like oral supplements or dispersing essential oils into the air until additional scientific data showing their safety and efficacy.

The River House stands on the shore of the Piankatank River off Stove Point Road, Deltaville, in the Tidewater region of Virginia. Stove Point is a narrow peninsula jutting out into the Piankatank River near where it meets Chesapeake Bay. ([Map](https://imgur.com/a/6A7civI) | [2017 View](https://imgur.com/a/D5tRaRt)) Stove Point Road is a one-lane road running the length of the peninsula, so narrow that cars going in opposite directions have to make room for each other. There is a small community of mostly summer homes, many owned by families over generations. The one-story River House was built in 1970 by John and Marjorie Thornton, and served as a holiday getaway for their family. When their children, Jack, Peggy, and Anne, grew up, they brought their own children for weekends and summer breaks. With a pool for swimming, a beach for playing, and the river for fishing and boating, it was an idyllic place – described by one family member as “our Camelot” and another as “the happiest place in the world.” In July 2017, the peace of the place was shattered when Peggy Thornton Lammers' body was found lying in a hallway, dead from blunt force trauma. The case has never been solved.  

Margaret Thornton Lammers was born January 24, 1956 in Virginia. In 1978, she married Tony Lammers, and the couple moved to the Cleveland, Ohio area, where they raised a son and two daughters – Jay, Anne Jordan, and Elizabeth Presley. They had a home in Gates Mills outside Cleveland. But in February 2016, after her mother died, Peggy moved to Richmond to care for her ailing father, who needed round-the-clock care. When he died in November, Peggy remained in Richmond helping her siblings to settle his estate, and going back and forth to Ohio.  

June 30, 2017 was the start of a 4th of July gathering at the River House. Tony and daughter A.J. came down from Ohio. Peggy's sister Anne Fergusson's family joined them from Richmond. The Ohio contingent returned home on July 4, while Anne and Peggy left on the 5th.   On Saturday, July 8, Peggy drove back from Richmond to Deltaville for the weekend. According to Tony, this was not unusual, as Peggy was comfortable being at the house on her own. But her sister says it was rare, and that Peggy usually had a dog with her. On this occasion, she was by herself. She had planned to go back to Richmond on Monday, July 10, but she decided to stay an extra night. Her last call was made at 5:13 p.m., last text sent at 7:13 p.m., and her phone last pinged at 1:18 a.m.    

On July 11, Anne tried to reach Peggy by phone, but the calls went straight to voicemail. At 5:30 p.m. Tony called her to ask if Peggy was with her. He, too, had been trying to reach Peggy. Their daughter A.J. was likewise was unable to reach her mother for their normal after-work call. Tony contacted the Middlesex County sheriff's police to do a welfare check.   

Accordingly, a detective visited the house about 6 p.m. Although Peggy's car was parked at the house, she didn't answer the door, which bore a muddy footprint as if it had been kicked in. The door, however, was intact. The detective then went next door, where a party was going on, to see if Peggy might be there. She was not, and no one knew anything about where she was. The detective was able to enter the house through a slightly open sliding glass door at the back. There he found Peggy's body lying in a pool of blood in the bedroom hallway. She was barefoot, and there were bloody shoe prints on the floor. The house was in some disarray, a telescope near the sliding glass door overturned, drawers pulled out and put on a bed. Peggy's purse had been rifled through and items scattered. The contents of the medicine cabinet had been emptied into the bathroom sink. A knife had been placed diagonally, blade facing up, in the middle of the kitchen sink. No weapon was found, and Peggy's cell phone was missing. Although this looked like a burglary, police had a feeling the scene had been staged. Money and jewelry that were in sight were left untouched. There were no marks on the wood floor where the 20-30 pound telescope had “fallen.” The only thing taken was a 19-inch television. Police were convinced that the murderer was someone Peggy knew, who had tried to make it look like a break-in. Family said she would not have opened her door to a stranger.  

The death was ruled a homicide with the cause being blunt force trauma to the head. Peggy had bled out. Although her blood was found on the knife in the sink, she had no stab wounds. Nor was her skull fractured. One thumb was  dislocated, possibly a defensive wound. Nothing further from the autopsy has been released, including time of death. Investigators took away the knife, some beer bottles, and DNA swabs. At a later date, a piece of the hallway floor was cut out and taken up. In December 2017, the state crime lab announced that DNA other than Peggy's had been found.   

The following year brought a only few more nuggets of information from law enforcement. “Relevant” DNA had been identified to a person. Major M.E. Sampson from Middlesex County sheriff's police stated “DNA from someone other than Lammers was recovered from the crime scene. Processing DNA by the Virginia Forensic Laboratory can take a year, and law enforcement agencies are limited to submitting three DNA samples at one time. The MCSO has submitted DNA to a private laboratory in Florida, seeking to speed up the investigation.”  At a regular Coffee with Deputies public meeting on May 23, 2018, MCSO chief deputy Garth  Wheeler told reporters that “We are confident that an arrest is imminent.”  However, in spite of this statement, no arrests were made.  

Peggy's cell phone has never been found, and investigators theorize that it was taken away by the killer to destroy evidence. With the Point being surrounded by water, there is no shortage of places where it could have been dumped.  

Anne Fergusson has been involved from the start in advocating for her sister. In July 2018, Anne and Peggy's daughter A.J. posted flyers around the Deltaville area, containing an impassioned plea from A.J. for anyone with any information to come forward.  The family also offered a $10,000 reward for information about the case. A.J. further wrote a letter to the Southside Sentinel in July 2020. “My mom’s story should be about her life. I want her to be remembered for the way she lived and not the manner in which she died. She was a loving mother who raised us with intent and care. She stood up for people and stopped for animals. She lived with a fire in her; her emotions ran the gamut but they were always a force. Her laughter was contagious and her family was her life.”  - [Southern Strange, Peggy Lammers: Murder at the Edge of Paradise](https://southernstrange.com/2024/10/11/peggy-lammers-murder-at-the-river/)  

In 2021, the Richmond office of the FBI became involved in the case. They [released a video](https://www.fbi.gov/video-repository/richmond-lammers-092520.mp4/view) hoping to generate leads from the public. In it you can see poignant images of family times for the Lammers family, from wedding photos to kids growing up, to happy times at the River House. They also showed the crime scene. The house is very much as it was when Peggy's murder occurred. You can see the overturned telescope, dresser drawers out of place, knife in the sink.  In 2022, Sheriff's detective Chris  Gatling said, “It is fair to say we have a theory, but I am not going to divulge that. A suspect has been developed, but it takes time to disprove or prove that. I don’t believe at this point that [whoever committed the murder] was a stranger.” Police have also stated that they developed a motive. As to method, one of the sheriff's police has theorized that someone kicked Peggy in the head violently enough to cause the bleeding that led to her death.  

In March 2022, People Magazine did a story about the murder and made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bjd3sZ6Q1bM) for their “People Show True Crime.” There are brief interviews with Anne Fergusson ( who shows a photo of the bloody shoeprint found near Peggy's body), FBI special agent Andrew Manson, and MCSO deputy Chris Gatling. Gatling, in discussing the DNA tests, made the remark “I don't want to comment on the results of those tests; I will say it was tested against the family.”  He also talked about the transient population of boaters in the area, and pointed out that Stove Point was only one part of Peggy's life, the other part being in Cleveland.  

Despite all statements and interviews, as of 2025 there have still been no arrests and no significant updates to the case. 

The River House is on a one-lane, one way in, one way out road and could not be seen from Stove Point Road. Its waterfront side faces the bay side of the peninsula. Anyone coming there would have had a purpose, or knowledge of the house. Stove Point is a popular vacation spot, with both summer visitors and some year-round residents. It is a community where people tend to know one another. Property crime is seen in the off-season, but violent crime is rare at any time. Land and houses on Stove Point are at a premium, so it is an affluent area. However, there had been break-ins and squatters in the Deltaville area. To assuage local worries, police stated that they believed there was no risk to the community at large. This, of course, aligns with their theory that the killer was someone Peggy knew.  

With summertime being the busy season for the Point, you would think screams would have been heard and anyone acting suspicious around the house would have been noticed. As mentioned, the day that Peggy's body was discovered, there were people at the house next door. This would have been the house on the right as you face the water; it was screened by trees but fairly close to the River House. On the other side there was an open field before the next neighbor. Considering that the house could not be seen from the road, and there was a neighbor on only one side, the River House could be said to be somewhat isolated. Police described it as off the beaten path and not a place a random thief would be likely to strike.    

In this day and age, it is hard to believe that a case where the police have DNA, a suspect, and a motive, hasn't been solved for almost 8 years. I'm left wondering what information eludes them such that they can't make an arrest. It does seem clear that they have had a suspect in mind for many years. 

Undoubtedly there are many unanswered questions about the case. Why did Peggy go back to the River House just days after leaving? How many people knew she would be there, and be there on her own? Her husband, daughter and sister knew, but who else?   

What time was the crime committed? If under cover of darkness, it is easier to see how someone could have approached the house unseen. It might even be possible that they approached by water (though there was no dock on the property).  

Who could have had a motive? The first thing that occurs to me is a monetary motive. Peggy was settling her father's estate. He had been a prominent doctor in the Richmond area, and helped to found Physicians Clinical Laboratories which was later bought by LabTech. Each of the Thornton siblings were to inherit a sizable sum. Then there is the River House itself. Was there family wrangling over the will or the disposition of property?  Someone who stood to inherit from Peggy would also have a motive.   

If we knew why she went back, motive might be clearer to see  - was she meeting someone and this led to the attack?  This might explain how they would have been able to get into the house, either invited, or possibly forcing their way in as they came back. Peggy had been largely away from Cleveland for over a year. Was she having an affair? It was stated that she planned to go back home soon after the 4th of July. Could this have made a lover angry or jealous? Was there a friend or acquaintance who made advances to her and was spurned, then attacked in a rage?  

Did someone on the Point have a grudge against Peggy or her family? I have seen nothing to suggest this. The Thorntons, Lammers and Fergussons were well-known in the area over many years, and nothing like this seems to have surfaced. 

Or could it, after all, have been robbery? Could someone have followed Peggy home and forced their way in? Could it have been a break-in while she slept? She might have woken and confronted them. Although police stated that only a small TV was taken, what if it was someone searching for drugs, who wasn't interested in whatever else was in the house? Police wouldn't have a way to know what prescription bottles might have been taken. Even close family members might not have known what medicines Peggy was taking. A person under the influence of drugs might have been more likely to escalate to violence. I'm thinking of the police theory of kicking her in the head, which seems so brutal.   

My inclination is that there is a monetary motive in there somewhere. Nothing else makes sense for the killing of a woman who seems to have led a blameless life. I don't know exactly what that motive might be, as there is so little information to go on. But money is behind so many crimes, and whenever a murder involves someone who has it, that immediately springs to mind.  

As regards the muddy footprint on the door of the house and the torn screen, I don't put much stock in those. The door wasn't breached, and the footprint could have been left at any time and simply not cleaned up yet. Similarly, the screen could have been torn at any time before the murder.  

Law enforcement says this is not a cold case; some of the officers seem very intent on finding the killer  and state that they think about the case every day. They are still asking the public to come forward, looking for anything that might help to tie up the last loose ends and lead to an arrest. Peggy's family are also involved.  Anne Fergusson told the People reporter that she promised Peggy she would find her killer, and she won't stop until she does.  

Peggy Lammers was buried in Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland. Her obituary at Legacy.com contains the tribute “She will be remembered as the best mom ever.”  Sister Anne has described her: “She was very caring, full of energy, very charismatic, funny girl, had a lot of friends, people loved to be around her.” - [ 6 News, 3/20/2018  ](https://www.wtvr.com/2018/03/20/no-arrests-yet-in-deltaville-womans-murder-but-not-a-cold-case-1)  

The River House has stood empty since that day in July 2017. The driveway is overgrown; the wood deck is rotting. Anne Fergusson is the only family member who has gone through the house since the murder. She says she considers it a crime scene. Tony Lammers issued a statement to [People Magazine:](https://people.com/crime/mothers-unsolved-2017-murder-still-haunts-familys-beloved-virginia-vacation-beach-house/) “We continue to pray, and remain hopeful, that the law enforcement officers who have worked tirelessly will bring the person who took Peggy from us to justice.""  A.J. Lammers said she wants her mother to be remembered for who she was and not as a murder victim. Jay Lammers said he hasn't been back and doesn't know if he can ever go back, now that it is the saddest place on earth. The last word goes to devoted sister Anne: “I will never get over losing my sister, my best friend, in our favorite place on earth in such a violent and cruel way. My goal is to keep Peggy’s name in the news, hoping that it will prompt someone to come forward with information. The only thing sustaining me through this difficult time is to do anything I can to help this be solved and not forgotten.”  - [Letter to the Southside Sentinel, reported by NBC Dateline, July 26, 2019](https://www.nbcnews.com/dateline/no-arrests-two-years-after-virginia-murder-ohio-mother-peggy-n1035261)

1iza91g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AddictionAdvice/comments/1iza91g/seeking_advice_from_recovered_meth_addicts_or/,seeking advice from recovered meth addicts or wife's of meth addicts,"Addiction. The most heartbreaking disease is stealing away my peace, sanity, ability to function as a mother and my beautiful best friend. 

My fiance who I have three children with is my best friend and I love him so deeply I want to spend the rest of my life together. I have been dedicated to this man for the past 12 years. All 12 years he has struggled with some form of addiction. Drugs, shopping, sex, building shit, supplements, music, some bad some not so bad... I've watched him quit fentanyl cold turkey which was brutal but successful. And the wild thing is for the 8 months he was using fentanyl, i had no idea... until one day on easter morning during service he started bawling his eyes out and decided he had enough. He came clean, told me he had a problem but he wants to stop. I offered to help him get into detox but he refused and said he could do it on his own. 2 weeks of shakes puking shitting tossing turning sweating couldn't even walk moaning groaning shitting and puking some more ... but he did it. Got off the juice. cause HE WANTED IT. What I didn't realize at the time was how important it was that he got professional help because getting off wasn't the hard part, it was how to stay off when life would hit him again with the hard stuff. 

so life did what it does and through some challenges his way, bought our first house in kauai but had to move back in with his toxic family while we built the house. His mother and sister are certainly triggers for him. I can't even begin to explain how dysfunctional his family is but it's been what i believe the worst decision we ever made... sometimes i think if we never moved in with them he'd never be addicted to his current substance meth. but i also know ""wherever he goes, there he is"" and that nobody is to blame for his addiction but himself. 

Meth... wow, when i first found that meth pipe i couldn't believe it. My amazing talented beautiful loving husband, doing meth ?! I was in denial... so much that the manipulation had me thinking, it's just like medicine right? only because that's what he'd say.... ""it's just like adderal"" ""my little cup of coffee in the morning"" ""helps me get things done"" ""i only microdose"" i mean the shit that would come out of his mouth to justify meth use was bewildering yet he convinced me to turn a cheek and look the other way... it was ""okay"" until it wasn't... 

i got pregnant with our third child. i got so sick for 10 months that i had to be hospitalized multiple times because i couldn't eat or drink. i was diagnosed with HG. Brutal... and my sex drive and libido was almost non existent. well apparently meth makes your sex drive go through the ceiling. and next thing you know he's having a year long sexual affair while i'm pregnant... he missed our babies birth due to being high or withdrawing still not entirely sure... but it was traumatic and i am devastated beyond measure. says he has no feelings for her but she makes him ""feel like a king"" when i wouldn't. writing this out is making me fucking hate him. it's so disgusting and painful i don't even want to wake up most mornings. 

but i have a beautiful baby and two other amazing children with him. so i do wake up and i do the best i can, but addiction has not only stolen his soul away it's now taking mine having to live around it. so of course,  i want him to get better but im becoming hopeless... because this time around, i dont think he wants it. 

my kids and i have been put in danger because of him and ive had enough. i told him im leaving, moving back to arizona and taking the kids unless he gets help. i called his entire family, told them the dark secret and we had an intervention the next day. he agreed to go to texas for rehab at la hacienda. but i dont think he really wants it. 

i think he's comfortable in the addiction. and im just not sure $35,000 for his rehab is worth it. i think he's going to waste our money and time but i have to give this a shot right ? i love him, wildly. but most days i just feel like im in love with who he was or who he could be... tired of loving his potential but even more tired of living in fear that he's going to die. 

he loves his children, and he is their favorite person. 
moving away with cause immense heartache for everyone. especially my kids. they won't understand for many years why mama had to do this. i'll be the villain... but that's okay. i'll be the bad guy to my babies because i know it's the only way to keep us safe. just heartbreaking beyond. i can hardly think or function.

i guess im just looking for advice from recovered meth addicts. 

thanks, 

from a broken mama

1iza8yy,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestIndia/comments/1iza8yy/did_i_overreact_or_was_she_never_in_it_for_the/,Did I Overreact or Was She Never In It for the Long Haul?,"So after reading so many posts on this sub, I thought of creating one too. This is a throwaway account. 



I(24M) am here to get different perspectives, opinions and help.



So this started in 2020 when I joined my college. I was in my zone of not getting into a relationship. If I do it'll be a serious. I have had relationships earlier but was never serious and maybe was in relationships only to not feel left out. 

Now I came to college, it was covid era back then. I randomly met a girl over Instagram and we started talking. I wasn't trying to date her. It was just talking. Later she asked me about my college and she said she has a friend in the same college. I enquired and then I thought let's connect. Eventually she asked her friend( my ex now) she said she is fine connecting on IG. Now, she was one of those girls who don't use ig much. Therefore in the start I thought she isn't interested in even talking. When asked does she throw her phone after a text. She explained that she doesn't use Instagram much and apologised and then this went back and forth. Hence I couldn't carry the conversation and then we left it as it was. 

Then when we went back to college, there was this one night I was coming back from college after the team's Volleyball practice and it started raining. I didn't have much friends as I didn't intend to make many in college ( Also I have hard time trusting people therefore I have quite a bunch of friends who are there from school and some when I was in 11th and 12th and I am happy with them). Coming back so it was raining and I had her contact ( we shared it for notes and stuff). I asked her if she had umbrella (she used to live in hostel inside college and it was barely 200m ). She said yes and she gave it to me and said I can return it tomorrow. And boy oh boy, never did I think this would be the start of something. So after that when I returned her the umbrella we had coffee and then we started talking. We started connecting. She never had a boyfriend. She wasn't intending to and even I wasn't trying to make her my girlfriend. Time went on, things got ahead and we were in a relationship. ( I never asked her to become my gf and it was unspoken) . 

We used to spend all our day together. I used to live in PG, i used to bring lunch, we had lunch together. Met in breaks, and after college hours, I would stay in college till 9 and it was great. But then when she started sharing about her family she said they won't allow marriage in a different caste but she'll try. I agreed ki yeah what matters is we'll stay till the end and we'll try our best. If they don't agree there is nothing else we can do. ( Running away is never what i would want to do or want her to do). Now this went on for 4 years.  She helped me in most of things. I helped for the same. I asked my friends when she had college placements to help her. She got placed in a very good company. I was struggling due to my branch being ineligible for most of the companies. But I kept trying I knew I had skills, I would get in. Finally I did get placed in a good firm, good pay everything. Now we were out of college she shifted to a place near her company and when i was shifting i shifted accordingly so that I live nearby a metro so it's easy to commute. 

And after shifting things went sideways . Her parent's came after she was converted full time. Right after it she started saying she gets anxious and fears what will happens as her mother keeps telling to not have a bf (typical stuff- Father won't be able to with this, there will be allegations and all of that). I said why are you getting anxious. We spoke about it earlier and know it won't be easy( After the first discussion of parent's not agreeing whenever I used to try to discuss this she used to not think much about it. She used to say us time dekh lenge). Now she started saying this every other day about fear, anxiety. I used to console her but it was getting out of hand. Like she wasn't ready to fight for it. She continuously said they won't agree whatever it maybe. I then sat her down oneday, said let's discuss  and come to solution to this. She came and started the same thing that nothing will happen. I asked will you try? Will you genuinely try? If yes then it's okay. She said nothing and held on to that they will not agree, now I know my parents blah blah.

Then I said to this means no matter you won't try? She said it won't matter. 

This made me feel bad and I said if you are not willing to fight then what is the point of continuing? She said idk you take the decision. I asked her but laying down all the scenarios but she said nothing will happen. Then I said let's breakup and not continue then. She agreed to it, cried and then I dropped her back to her house.



It was a tough next day ( considering I never get affected if I lose a friend or somebody doesn't talk to me. Not trying to be a sigma here. It's just who I am). Now she used to randomly ask my flatmate if I am doing alright or not blah blah.

After that I started thinking did I take a wrong decision in anger or frustration. Thought a lot about it and then contacted her asking ki maybe we should talk, and discuss more scenarios and then happened most unexpected things.

She still doesn't have a boyfriend but she said if we meet she'll break. Whatever energy she has built since the breakup will fade away ( she was crying in her voice notes). She said I am expected to be strong considering I don't care about people leaving. If I don't stay strong how will she. I asked her let's meet and talk. But she wasn't ready. She wasn't talking nicely although I kept my calm being so egoistic. She said now it is not about her parents she doesn't want to be in a relationship. The things she has gone through in past months weren't good and she can't go through it again. She knows if somebody doesn't talk to me nicely, it gets into me and then I would leave. She was trying to do the same. Eventually she got me and then I didn't say a word and just said sure, okay to her texts.

The last message she said was to not think about this and focus on my career blah blah. 

Now I keep thinking Did I get played ?

Was this breakup a setup since she constantly kept saying her parents won't agree.  I haven't told my friends about our breakup they used to tell shaadi hi hogi bhai ab to teri. They keep asking about her and I tell she is fine. She is working and all. All of her friends know though. She told them maybe 2 weeks later is what she told \*it'll help her she said\*



Did i do the right thing?

I’m considering hiring a helper hand artist, needs to be local!

For the past two years I’ve been making custom tables, all hand painted and made with love. Ngl most of them are memes. I’m looking to expand and delegate, and possibly make a website. There’s other work that goes into it, wood working, epoxying, etc, and I’m just looking for another artist to paint the tables from here on. 

You wouldn’t have to worry about any wood working, finishing the tables, dealing with customers, building clientele, or any other aspect, just painting it-
I usually sell two sizes, side tables and coffee tables. If you were to paint the side table I would pay you $150, and the coffee table $200. 
This is a very high percentage of the total cost of the table, and I think artist deserve to be paid as generously as possible when offering their skill to someone

You would need to be local so I can drop the tables off at your place, and you can paint them in the comfort of your own home with a cushy deadline

If this sound fun to anyone please feel free to DM! I WILL BE ASKING FOR REFERENCE IMAGES OF YOUR PAINTING ABILITY, if you don’t have anything you can show me I will not be able to move forward

NOTE: 
The tables I make are very high quality in line work painting, and I genuinely take pride in that!! As I’m passing the baton in this, the idea isn’t a “turn and burn” , I’m looking for someone with a steady hand. It’s been a super dope side hustle for me and I would love some help! I can’t promise work often, I usually do one table a month, but there’s times that no one commissions one for months at a time. Sometimes it’s many people wanting a table all at once. The idea here is to delegate the painting to someone new so I can focus on managing it all and creating more work to do!

Many of the individuals in leadership positions or active membership within PCT are also deeply involved in at least two of these other organizations, raising serious concerns about the broader culture being fostered across them.

While substance use in college social settings is not uncommon, the normalization of assault, harassment, and misconduct is deeply troubling. There is no justification for a culture that allows these behaviors to persist unchecked. Reports from individuals within these organizations suggest a pattern of inappropriate behavior that has been tolerated for far too long. A current PCT pledge, for instance, has already experienced discomfort during coffee chats due to unsettling and inappropriate comments made by active members. If this is the nature of interactions with new recruits, it raises alarming questions about the environment within these groups as a whole.

Beyond PCT, these concerns extend into HKSA and KSA. At a recent event hosted by these cultural organizations, multiple individuals reportedly overheard the use of slurs, both in English and in other languages, creating an atmosphere of hostility and exclusion. This is not an isolated incident but rather part of a broader pattern of behavior that has come to define these organizations. HKSA, in particular, has developed a troubling reputation, with numerous accounts describing a culture of misogyny and deeply inappropriate conduct among male members.

Furthermore, KTP has been linked to these concerns as well, with multiple reports indicating that certain individuals perpetuating these behaviors are active members of this fraternity. The fact that these same individuals are embedded in multiple student organizations only exacerbates the issue, allowing the same culture of harassment and misconduct to persist unchecked across different spaces on campus.

The implications of these reports cannot and should not be ignored.

The failure to do so not only harms individual students but also reflects poorly on the university as a whole.

For those engaging with any of these organizations, caution is strongly advised. No student should feel unsafe or disrespected in the spaces they choose to participate in.

I mean, you would be ok by protecting others clause, if it wasn't your plan all along. On top of this there are reckless endangerment of Maya Fey, child endangerment of Pearl Fey, desecration of the corpse, tampering with evidence, abuse of office leading to death, criminal conspiracy to commit all that. You're looking at quarter of century in prison minimum, bro, probably without coffee. And don't call me Trite; I'm defense attorney in this jurisdiction, and you're \[should be\] under arrest, you son of the bitch.""*

\*\*\*

*Later, discussing it with Mia:*

*Mia: ""You were as good out there today as any defense lawyer could ever hope to be.""*

*Phoenix: ""You mean, when I was forced by you and your former boyfriend to trample over my friend's (and your sister's) feelings, who was crying asking me not to do this, to make him respect me which I'm not sure I should care about, because he was refusing to let an innocent - in this particular charge - person to get off the hook otherwise? Bonus points for that innocent person being kinda the love of my life, so I care a bit for her well-being as well? Just that he could have an emotional catharsis? I don't think it's a stellar moment for anyone involved, no.""*

\*\*\*

I have a very big problem with trilogy finale, and that's the very ending of Bridge to the Turnabout. I don't think that's intentional, but it's problematic. at least in my opinion (and being non-intentional actually makes it more problematic).

I loved the whole case up to the point of Dahlia being banished. I had my problems with it. Mostly, I can't believe in DL-6 being a reason that a powerful clan of mystics, that had a very good connections with high-level politicians, would just be ridiculed for a relatively small case of murder. Especially one that would be, under police procedures which are normal for every case Phoenix ever defended, would be considered solved on the spot: like, if Phoenix is the defense, can you imagine prosecution would be saying anything but ""no one else could possibly do it, if you want acquittal, bring us another culprit and absolutely solid-proof case against them"". But generally, I loved it. Still, then we got the ""final showdown"" between Phoenix and Godot.

And here is when the whole situation is very much screwed, on so many levels.

I mean, we can joke around that two (four, including Iris and Bikini?) adults were unable to keep up with 9-years-old; that they missed her going into the Inner Temple through really thin bridge, which Godot could just stand on and physically carry Pearl whereever he liked; that Misty would be absolutely able to channel Dahlia from any point in the world; that they could bind Misty before channeling Dahlia; that Misty could at least remove a lethal weapon from herself before channeling remorseless murderer. That's pretty obvious plotholes, but I don't want to harpy on that. I don't believe them being intended, they're just ""stupidities to make story happen"". But, even within the internal logic of the story:

Who exactly Misty Fey was going to kill with a sword, assuming that killing Maya isn't an option, killing Misty is useless without additional measures they never took (like, even if we assume that Misty's first plan was to channel Dahlia and either commit suicide or expect Godot to kill her, normally Pearl would channel her next moment, and we're back on square one), and the only other danger for Maya is Pearl? Who was the ""ultimate price"" Misty and Godot actually considered to pay for Maya? I think it's pretty obvious that Pearl would be the only possibility. (Imagine Maya's reaction, by the way. But hey, who cares about Maya!)

And even if we assume that the idea was for Godot to somehow use the sword to kill Misty-channeling-Dahlia with that sword (without any explanation how would he do that, and why don't just give sword to him to begin with then), however you look at that, this plan is bad, and its weakest point always was that it's all built on idea of Godot and Misty saving the day without anyone else (and Iris taking the blame in case of Godot's back-up plan; in the end, it seems, both of them were pretty content with the idea that there was just one way to stop Morgan's evil plan).

Because of this two, Maya just spends two days, in freezing cold chamber (and we know that damage to the body while channeling lingers on medium), without food, channeling Dahlia, who wants to murder her. Her long-lost mother was murdered before her own eyes to save Maya herself. She was completely cut-off from any help. Heck, she was in a cavern that can just cave in at any point. All of this, because two persons decided that it should be all about \_them\_, and weren't able to plan situation properly, on a lot of levels. Girl is not ok; we're pretty much told AND SHOWN that she's not ok, and the only reason she holds up is because of 9-years old Pearls, who ALSO is not ok.

And now, she's put onto the stand. By a person who actually killed her mother to let Maya live. To be pit against Phoenix, whom Maya pretty much trusts with her life - and who she's very clearly believes in as a person who can break witnesses; and she's still trying to protect a person who killed her mother, because he tried to save her. And she begs Nick not to.

But we need to, because otherwise a person who was instrumental to the whole situation, who could very easily let her avoid all of this, wouldn't get his conclusion and holds Iris as a hostage; because Maya's condition, opinion or agency doesn't matter. She exists to give him release and maybe to be allowed to cry later (no she wouldn't, she need to put on brave face for Pearl's sake). And instead of instead of just wiping the floor with Godot, everyone makes a fuss over him.",5,1740640474.0,AceAttorney,2,0.86,False

Coworking spaces are fantastic. They give you the flexibility of working in a professional setting without the rigid structure of a corporate office. Whether you’re a freelancer, entrepreneur, or remote worker, coworking spaces offer a great environment to boost productivity and network with like-minded professionals. But to keep the space enjoyable for everyone, there are a few unspoken rules of etiquette that every member should follow. Let’s break them down.

# Do’s: The Good Habits

# 1. Be Mindful of Noise Levels

Not everyone thrives in a noisy, chatty environment. If you need to take calls, use designated phone booths or quieter areas. Keep your voice at a reasonable level and use headphones for meetings and videos.

# 2. Clean Up After Yourself

No one wants to sit down at a desk covered in coffee stains and snack crumbs. Always clean up your workspace, whether it’s a shared table or a private desk. If you use a common area like the kitchen, wash your dishes and throw away your trash.

# 3. Respect Shared Resources

From printers to meeting rooms, coworking spaces have shared resources that everyone relies on. Don’t hog them. If you book a meeting room, show up on time and leave when your slot is up. If you’re using the printer, don’t print a novel when someone else is waiting for a single page.

# 4. Be Friendly and Open to Networking

One of the biggest perks of coworking spaces is the opportunity to meet new people. Say hello, introduce yourself, and be open to collaboration. But read the room—some people are there to work and may not be in the mood for a chat.

# 5. Follow the House Rules

Every coworking space has its own set of rules. Whether it’s about Wi-Fi usage, guest policies, or pet-friendly policies, make sure you know them and stick to them. Breaking the rules can make things uncomfortable for everyone.

# Don’ts: What to Avoid

# 1. Don’t Be a Space Hog

Spreading your stuff across multiple desks or occupying a meeting room for hours without booking it? Not cool. Be considerate of others who also need space to work.

# 2. Don’t Play Music Out Loud

Nobody wants to hear your favorite playlist while they’re trying to focus. Always use headphones when listening to music or watching videos.

# 3. Don’t Oversell Yourself

Networking is great, but there’s a fine line between making connections and being overly salesy. Avoid pushing your business onto people who aren’t interested. Build relationships first—business will follow naturally.

# 4. Don’t Bring Strong-Smelling Food

As tempting as it may be to bring last night’s garlic-heavy pasta, strong food odors can be distracting (and unpleasant) for those around you. Stick to neutral-smelling meals or eat in designated areas.

# 5. Don’t Overstay in Shared Areas

Lounges, phone booths, and common spaces are for everyone. Don’t treat them like your personal office. If you’ve been in a shared space for a long time, be mindful of others who may need a turn.

Coworking spaces thrive on community, and following these do’s and don’ts helps keep the environment enjoyable for everyone. A little courtesy goes a long way. Be mindful, respectful, and open to collaboration, and you’ll make the most out of your coworking experience!",1,1740640433.0,u_healthyskinclub,0,1.0,False

https://preview.redd.it/p3guhse6emle1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=613d340fc4771f3c07cb3455540c839f7c0af3ea

Coworking spaces have revolutionized the way we work, offering flexible and collaborative environments that cater to a wide range of professionals. Whether you’re a freelancer, entrepreneur, remote worker, or part of a growing startup, there’s a coworking space designed to meet your needs. But not all coworking spaces are created equal. Let’s explore the different types available so you can find the one that best suits your working style and goals.

# 1. Open Coworking Spaces

The classic coworking model, open spaces feature shared desks, communal seating, and an energetic atmosphere. These are perfect for freelancers, remote workers, and solo entrepreneurs who thrive on networking and collaboration. They often have a mix of lounge areas, private booths, and hot desks, making them ideal for those who love variety in their work environment. Think of it as a coffee shop with fewer distractions and more opportunities to meet like-minded professionals.

# 2. Niche or Industry-Specific Coworking Spaces

Some coworking spaces are tailored to specific industries, creating an environment where professionals in the same field can collaborate and grow together. Examples include:

* **Tech Hubs** – Designed for software developers, startups, and IT professionals, these spaces often come with high-speed internet, coding workshops, and tech-focused networking events.
* **Creative Studios** – Perfect for artists, designers, and content creators, these spaces offer features like photography studios, podcasting rooms, and collaborative brainstorming areas.
* **Wellness & Health-Focused Spaces** – Geared toward wellness professionals like yoga instructors, therapists, and holistic practitioners, these spaces may include meditation rooms, fitness areas, and organic cafés.

# 3. Corporate Coworking Spaces

Large corporations are now embracing coworking spaces as an alternative to traditional offices. Corporate coworking spaces blend the flexibility of coworking with the structure of a professional office. They provide private offices for teams, high-end amenities, and corporate networking opportunities. Companies that use these spaces benefit from lower overhead costs while still offering employees a modern and collaborative environment.

# 4. Incubators & Accelerators

Startups looking for more than just a desk often turn to coworking spaces that double as incubators or accelerators. These spaces provide mentorship, funding opportunities, and business development programs. Entrepreneurs working in these environments gain access to investors, advisors, and strategic partnerships that can help scale their businesses quickly.

# 5. Luxury & High-End Coworking Spaces

For those who want a bit more comfort and exclusivity, luxury coworking spaces offer high-end design, premium amenities, and concierge services. These spaces often include private offices, gourmet coffee bars, event spaces, and even wellness facilities. They attract executives, established entrepreneurs, and professionals who want a sophisticated work environment.

# 6. Coliving + Coworking Spaces

For digital nomads and remote workers who travel frequently, coliving coworking spaces offer the perfect blend of work and accommodation. These spaces provide living quarters, communal kitchens, and workspaces, making them ideal for those who prefer a seamless work-life integration while on the move.

# Choosing the Right Space for You

With so many options available, the best coworking space for you depends on your work style, industry, and needs. Do you thrive in a buzzing, open environment or need a quiet, focused atmosphere? Are you looking for networking opportunities, or do you need specialized tools and resources? Once you identify what’s most important to you, finding the perfect coworking space will be much easier.

Coworking is more than just a place to work—it’s a community and a lifestyle. By choosing the right type, you’ll enhance your productivity, creativity, and professional network in ways that a traditional office simply can’t offer.",1,1740640381.0,u_healthyskinclub,0,1.0,False

So I wanted to share my own mixed bag team that can cover the strongest curry dish (even though it's not a curry) with only a Luxray and a Golem.

[Both of these will take me three birthdays to level up](https://preview.redd.it/tsm40kmnomle1.jpg?width=1891&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4686c23432ea72f138a2cfc060fded7bf9738105)

These two mixed bags can cover all 4 ingredients of the Stew in approx the correct ratio, but still lacking in the sheer quantity needed to make it 3 times a day.

The requirements of the stew and the production of the mons according to Raenonx (assuming ingredient up is upgraded) would be:

|Ingredient|Required per day|Produced per day (lv 60)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Soybeans|84|68.59|
|Tomatos|75|60.71|
|Mushrooms|69 (nice)|39.19|
|Coffee|48|43.37|

So as you can see, quite a bit off in quantity.

But if I assuming a best case scenario, where GCT is used (you need for pot size anyway) and 1000 sleep ribbon obtained, the math would then look like:

|Ingredient|Required per day|Produced per day (lv 60)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Soybeans|84|85.51|
|Tomatos|75|75.73|
|Mushrooms|69 (nice)|48.86|
|Coffee|48|54.10|

It appears juuust enough while needing a bit of mushroom support (Gengar says no biggie).

So that's currently the way I'm seeing these two and raising them. If I ever get there, then these two would CARRY me on curry weeks. 

But unlike the poster who inspired me, I am a bit doubtful on how worth it this crazy shenanigan would be, because it would take a LOT of effort to get to that point, and at that point will the Stew still be worth making?

I already raised a Keema Curry team (with 2 mons) that overlaps in dish needed with a similar setup, and they can already cover constant Keemas no problem, which is also why Curry is my best dish type at the moment.

## What is a Laser Pico Projector and Why Should You Care?

A laser pico projector is an incredibly compact and portable projector⁣ that⁤ utilizes laser technology to create an image.​ Unlike traditional projectors that rely on lamps, ⁣laser pico⁢ projectors offer several key advantages:

* ​  **Enhanced Portability:** ⁢Their small size makes them ⁤incredibly easy to carry around, fitting⁣ comfortably⁤ into your pocket or bag. This is‍ a meaningful advantage over larger, less portable projectors.
*   **Increased​ Lifespan:** Laser light sources⁣ boast ‍a much longer ⁤lifespan than traditional lamps, often lasting ‍tens ⁤of thousands of hours. This​ translates to lower maintenance ⁢costs and greater reliability.*   **Improved Color Accuracy:** Laser technology ​can⁤ produce a wider color gamut and more vibrant images than traditional projection methods.
*   ‌**Focus-Free ​Operation‍ (in ​most cases):** ‍Many laser pico projectors offer ⁢focus-free operation, ensuring a sharp image irrespective of the projection surface. ​This⁢ is due to the⁤ nature of how laser light ⁣is projected, offering nearly infinite focus.

With ongoing technological advances, now is a great time to​ consider the commercial⁤ potential of a new laser pico projector.

For business presentations in well-lit rooms, aim for at ‍least 600 lumens, or even consider⁣ a **bright laser pico ⁤projector** of 800-1,000 lumens. For darker environments, 400-500 lumens may suffice.*   **Resolution:** ​resolution refers to the number of pixels in the projected image. Higher resolutions provide sharper and more detailed images. full HD (1920x1080) is ideal for movies and presentations, while⁤ HD‌ (1280x720)⁢ or XGA (1024x768) might potentially be sufficient for basic presentations and casual viewing.
*   **Connectivity:** Ensure the projector offers the necessary‍ connectivity options for your devices, including HDMI, USB, Wireless (Wi-Fi &⁢ Bluetooth), and ⁢screen mirroring capabilities (Miracast, AirPlay).
*   **Battery Life:** Battery ‍life is crucial ‍for portability. Consider how long you⁤ need⁢ the projector to⁢ operate​ on a ⁤single charge. At least 2-3 hours is recommended for most use cases.
*   **Weight and‍ Size:** ⁢Consider how often ⁢you'll be carrying the projector. If portability is paramount, opt for a lightweight⁢ and ‌compact model.
*⁣  ⁤ **price:** ⁤laser pico projectors range in price from a few hundred dollars to over a​ thousand.‍ Determine your⁣ budget and choose a model that offers the⁤ best⁣ value for your money.‍ You can also check retailers such ⁢as Amazon to determine the **laser pico projector‌ price**.

1iza0n2,https://www.reddit.com/r/complainaboutanything/comments/1iza0n2/roommate_is_getting_on_my_nerves/,Roommate is Getting on my Nerves,"I love her, dearly! I’d do almost anything for her! But Jesus I’m annoyed!! Every tiny thing that she does or says doesn’t bother me until it all bothers me!

Two weeks ago she left the bag of bread totally open on the counter, which I bought by the way!! She works with my best friend and I told my BFF to “Tell her she’s lost bread privileges!” As A Joke. We joke like that constantly! But her parents have been causing a boat load of problems and so she’s lashing out in unrelated ways. Her response was to get pissed off and say I’m always nitpicking.

Oh, so when I tell her it’s ok to leave the dirty dishes overnight and that she doesn’t need to apologize for not washing them immediately… I’m still a nitpick?

Most of the time I keep my opinions to myself because I can also be incredibly untidy, but she needs to complain to my best friend because I didn’t want the bread to go stale?! I even told my BFF that my roommate should be able to vent and not worry that it’s getting back to me, but my friend said her outburst was totally uncalled for.

The is the gal who instead of taking out the trash or recycling when it’s full just piles things on top…
Or leaves her laptop and electronics out all over the couch every day so that when I want to sit down I have to move her stuff.

I’ve had the most gentle conversations with her about food safety practices, and how to most efficiently use the dishwasher so that the dishes get clean and the drain doesn’t clog… but sometimes I wonder if I’m talking to a wall!! It’s not fair to get pissed off because she didn’t know better… but now she DOES know better and keeps doing it!!

She’s got OCD and does what she can to deal with it, but I swear to god she uses 3x more toilet paper than I do! She’s constantly clogging her toilet!! We have an abundance of cloth hand towels, so that there are always extra clean ones, but she takes 2 full paper towels to do ANYTHING! Even drying her hands! I can’t stand using all of these single use items so wastefully, but I don’t have OCD, so I just keep it to myself.

AND ON THAT NOTE: It really sucks that she has “I need to shower twice a day” OCD and not “I’m have to wipe up my coffee splatter on the counter” OCD.

Her sleep schedule is FUCKED, and I don’t think she has a usual bedtime but she’s definitely averaging 3am. She’s constantly exhausted, constantly in pain, constantly late, and constantly complaining! We’ve had more than one conversation where I express concern and tell her I want to help just for her to get stubborn each time and say that if I’m bugging her about it then her anxiety gets worse. I know she’s unhappy but how the fuck are you going to fix your issues if you don’t put ANY effort into it?!? Yes we’re all unique and special but “I’ve always been like this” is a shit excuse for completely disregarding and fucking your circadian rhythm!

Monday night I was making us dinner and listening to a podcast. I have hearing loss in one ear, and with the fan on, two pans on the stove sizzling, and the sound of me washing my hands and cutting vegetables- I had the volume all the way up. She came over to ask me to turn it down and I felt so unappreciated and annoyed… like girl you’re not even helping… I didn’t even tell her when it was done, I just ate by myself because I didn’t know if she was going to be bothered, I suspected she was napping but she never said anything! Had she told me before that she wanted to lay down I would have stopped and found my headphones, so I didn’t know if it was going to annoy her to tell her dinner was done. 

My mom pointed out that I’m always making excuses for her and I’m always the one talking on the big cleaning tasks, and she’s right! 

If I’m unusually quiet she’ll ask me over and over again what’s wrong… But only when I’m utterly exhausted! I know she’s dealing with trauma but it’s just too much when I’m out of energy. 

She was taking something I said out of context today and told me it really hurt her feelings… immediately after telling me that her family sucks, she’s mad at her mom, and she never wants to talk to her dad again. I’m sorry, I’m sorry I hurt your feelings because I never meant to do that… But again I think she’s redirecting her feelings about her parents towards me, and I’m exhausted.

I’ve been working since the day I turned 16, this girl is 27, works 3 days a week, and her mom pays her rent… So when she’s complaining to me I just want to tell her to grow up. Toughen up, decide to get better, and push yourself to follow through! If you think it’s hard now just wait until your safety net is gone!! She needs to work on herself while she’s got all the time to, so she’s not forced to sink or swim when she’s cut off. She’s really intelligent and well educated, but when it comes to her own health she’s never going to improve or get better if she can’t decide for herself that she’s with the effort and dedication.",1,1740639927.0,complainaboutanything,0,1.0,False
1iza0mp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1iza0mp/my_boyfriend_dumped_me_and_married_his_ex_and_i/,My boyfriend dumped me and married his ex and I don’t know how to cope,"I (27F) had been dating my boyfriend (30F) since 6 months. It was all going well as he was kind, patient and a good listener. We were both extremely comfortable with each other and introduced our families and friends pretty early on. Considering our friend groups had gotten intertwined because of this, I knew he had one long term relationship before ours and all his friends thought they were a ‘done deal’. They were together for more than 3 years before they broke up due to incompatible careers, and apparently it took both of them an incredibly long time to more forward with their lives. My boyfriend has only ever given me surface level information about her and their relationship, but he’s that way about most of his interpersonal relationships, so no red flags there. At least for the time being. 
Fast forward to the beginning of last year, when I heard from the grapevine of his friends that they had heard, the ex (let’s call her Emma)- was moving into our city soon. 
I was a little uncomfortable but not enough to do anything about it, when I told my boyfriend (let’s call him Sam), his reaction didn’t give away much, almost like he didn’t care so eventually my anxiety died down. 

A few weeks later Sam had a dinner party to attend, he invited me to come with. When we reached there all his friends were already there and we started mingling. An hour later, I was approached by one of Sam’s friends who told me that Emma was here as she was friends with the host. I mentally slapped myself for not expecting this. 

I was introduced to Emma and she seemed soft spoken and articulate, sticking to only surface level questions. 
Later into the night I spot Sam and Emma having a conversation, it seemed stiff and both of them seemed kinda awkward and a couple minutes later, Sam gave her an awkward side hug and that was it. On our way back as he was dropping me off, i asked him if it was weird seeing her after all this time and he just shook his head, not saying anything else the remaining car ride. 
We spoke less and less over the following 2 weeks. There were no typical weekend dates, he didn’t stay over. I basically didn’t see him till 2 weeks later when he met me at a coffee shop and told me he wanted to break up. 

Emma and Sam starting dating again immediately after, and considering their primary cause of split was no longer a factor anymore, they’re going strong and are to be married this may. Which makes me think not so kind thought too often because i genuinely thought he might he the one, and the fact that he was essentially gone overnight and all it took was one meeting to undo almost a year of emotional input. 

Any advice would be great. ",3,1740639926.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,4,1.0,False
1iza0ii,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iza0ii,"I blind bought nearly ALL of these fragrances in the past 6 months! There is a mixture of niche, designer and a ton of clone fragrances. If you are curious about any of them, ask away!","6 months ago the ONLY fragrances I owned were a Dior Sauvage clone called ""Afnan Modest Une"" and a bottle of Calvin Klein Obsession. Afnan Modest Une was my signature scent for several years. But I began to get bored and wanted to change things up a bit. So 6 months ago I blind bought YSL Myslf and fell in love.... Then bought Spicebomb Extreme to try out for the cold winter months and it was phenomenal... and THEN I decided to try the popular ""Aventus"" style clone called ""Club De Nuit Intense Man"" and that became one of my all time favorite scents. So that’s how I fell down the rabbit hole of “clones”. That’s where this all started.

I work in a field where I encounter approximately 6,000-8,000 people on a daily basis and I am a fairly attractive younger guy; so I actually do have a lot of opportunity for these scents to be smelled by the public and actually do get compliments on a lot of these fragrances. I know people are always curious about what fragrances pull the most compliments; so here are the top 10 that get me the most. But please take note that these are also some of the fragrances I reach for most often. So take this list with a grain of salt. I’m sure if I wore other fragrances more often; they’d make it to this list. 

Top 10 most complimented fragrances currently:
1. Armaf: CDNIM
2. Armaf: Sillage 
3. Maison Alhambra: Immortel 
4. Afnan: Modest Une 
5. Montagne: Meteorite
6. Lataffa: Vintage Radio 
7. Mancera: Tonka Cola
8. Parfums De Marly: Haltane 
9. Parfums De Marly: Percival 
10. Victor & Rolf: Spicebomb Extreme

To answer a few popular questions I got last time I made a post in this community:


1. “How old are you?” I am in my mid-20s. So that might play a large part in my taste of fragrances. There are definitely some fragrances in my collection I find “too mature” for my liking that others may love.

2. “What do you do for work?” I do a few things. I have a normal day-job for a large corporation where I am in a position of management. The compensation for that job is around 90k. I also run a few faceless social media niche accounts on TikTok and Instagram. They are not fragrance related. They are just fun pages with niche topics that I was able to grow over the last 8 years. There are approximately 450k followers between them all and those usually bring in around $2,000-3,000 a month in ad revenue combined from posting paid ads. I also day-trade in the market and do some freelance software engineering contributions with Swift code for various iOS apps. And it is also worth noting I didn’t go to college. These are just little sources of income I’ve grown myself over the years and the software engineering has been all self taught. So no; I am not irresponsibly partaking in a hobby that is putting me in debt. I would not be buying all of these fragrances if it was going to put me in a bad place financially. I work very hard and fragrances are how I reward myself. Waking up every day and deciding “How do I want to smell today?” Is my favorite part of the day. It gets me up in the morning and makes me excited to start the day. And as the day goes on catching whiffs of whatever I’ve sprayed always makes me happy. So it’s all worth it. 

3. No; I am not hoarding all of these. I’ve decanted SO many fragrances for my friends and family to enjoy. I recently gifted my dad 20 8ML decants of 20 of my fragrances for him to enjoy. I’ve done the same for my brothers and close friends and my mom. I share them. I am not selfish with my fragrances. Ive probably decanted over 300 fragrances to give to friends and family since I started collecting. I enjoy sharing the passion of aromatherapy with others. 

4. “Do you plan to keep all of these?” No. I was just having fun exploring the world of fragrances since it was all new to me. I plan to wear these as much as possible over the next year to really find out what scents I love; then I plan to keep my top 25 bottles and give the rest to family and friends; or sell some online. But no, I definitely don’t plan to keep them all. I only want to end up keeping my top 25. When I move in a couple of years; I don’t want to lug around this many fragrances; lol. 

5. “Since you blind bought… are there any you hate?” Funny enough I like nearly everything I’ve bought. There’s only ONE I’d say I “hate” and that is Afnan: 9PM. That fragrance gives me such a horrible migraine and I can’t stand the smell. But I also don’t like JPG fragrances… so that makes sense. I don’t really “hate” anything else. I definitely have “least favorites” but nothing else that I’d say I HATE. Lol. My least favorites are a lot of the sweet scents. I find that sweet scents aren’t really my cup of tea. I like Oajan, Tonka Cola and Khamrah. But the other sweet scents are not fragrances I reach for anymore. I mainly prefer freshies. I also don’t really reach for my “unisex” fragrances. They smell good; but I prefer more manly smelling fragrances. Stuff like “imaginary” and “Infiniti rose” do smell nice; but I think I’d prefer smelling them on a woman rather than on myself. So I guess my “least favorites” would be a lot of the sweet gourmand style fragrances and a lot of my unisex fragrances.

They Can't Be Regenerated.""

  
Episode 29 ""Our Three Kingdoms""

This is the episode on the release date of ""Portal Three Kingdoms"". Since the previous episode (Episode 17) featured Yakumo as a shrine maiden, I had Yakumo wear a Chinese dress for this cover illustration. I forgot to ask for the length of the dress to be shortened, but I'm glad that Takuma Yokota is a ""know-it-all.""

  
The people selling peaches at the stall are Mao and Meili (a couple who look like them) from ""Chuka Ichiban!"" There is also a stall that is described as ""Chinatown Dim Sum,"" but if you don't read it carefully, you'll miss it just as easily as a terribly fast hand chop.

""Portal Three Kingdoms"" is a card set for beginners, so I get the impression that it didn't get much interest from hardcore players when it was released. I was a junior high school student at the time, so I held off on buying it due to financial reasons. But I never imagined that after more than 20 years of maturation, the market price of the packs would jump to several dozen times the list price... This is a good example of the fact that there is no such thing as a salt set for Magic: The Gathering. I'm sure Dragon's Maze will also be traded at a high price in the future. About a hundred years from now.

Episode 30: Our Struggle for Survival (Part 1)

This is the first of a two-part story about the battles on the first day of the Kanto Regional Championships. Due to the spread of the new coronavirus, I was unable to go to Ikebukuro, so my editor and Yokota-sensei covered the event on site instead. We would like to thank both of them, as well as the Sunshine Cultural Center and Sunshine Aquarium for agreeing to be interviewed.

Hajime is listening to ME&MY's Dub-I-Dub in front of the Tokyo Metropolitan Theatre. Lou is treating the Yellow Turbans as G-BOYS from Ikebukuro West Gate Park. The TV drama of the same work was broadcast in 2000, but the original novel was published in the 90s, so I guess it's okay. It's a work that can't be left out when the story is set in Ikebukuro, and my ringtone when I was in high school was Steppenwolf's ""Born to Be Wild,"" and Mitsuru won't die because of beef bowls.

For the first survival death, I used the deck recipes of Masahiro Kuroda and Kenichi Fujita as reference. However, since the Kanto Regional Championship is a tournament in the ""Core Set Fifth Edition"" environment, the first deck does not include ""Vampiric Tutor"" and ""Uktabi Orangutan."" My impression after playing the proxy is that it's still strong enough. You can reuse the creatures in the graveyard with ""Oath of Ghouls"" and ""Volrath's Stronghold.""

Also, from this episode onwards, Emi, Lou, and Torii's costumes have changed to early summer outfits. The first T-shirt was designed by a brand called MISCHIEVOUS, and Torii's T-shirt was designed by a brand called echo.

Episode 31 ""Our Struggle for Survival (Part 2)""

This is the second of a two-part story depicting the first day of the Kanto Regional Championship. The cover illustration was drawn with the image of Chappie, a popular dress-up character in the 1990s. Ponza Red is a deck that has been popular since the 6th Edition, when Plunder was included. In order to differentiate it from Gobu's Sly, the standard deck recipe has been significantly altered. As a result, it has more goblin colors than Gobu's Sly, but that's a bit of a shame.

The Managers's line, ""Your back is sooty,"" is a quote from Mahjong Hishoden: Crying Dragon. The ""Coffee House Shibuya Night Club,"" also mentioned in the manager's lines, is set as ""an irregular tournament with a unique format where all off-board tactics are allowed,"" and is where the adults always play. There are no plans to do this in the main story. I have a feeling I'll get in trouble for it.

  
In this episode, we finally get to introduce the shop manager's master, whose existence was hinted at in episode 9. It will be a while before he becomes involved in the story, but I'm sure many of you Planeswalkers will have somehow noticed the model for his character design.

Episode 32: ""Our Big Decision""

This is an interlude episode of the Kanto Regional Championship. It seems that Lou came to Tokyo to get hit with ""Decay"" because she wasn't able to meet Kuon, and that's entirely due to my own failings.

In the 1990s, Sunshine Aquarium was operating under the name Sunshine International Aquarium. There was little information, and the layout and creatures were frequently changed, so I realized how difficult it is to recreate the 1990s (Professor Yokota). If the aquarium police say, ""This isn't the Sunshine International Aquarium! It's a fabrication!"", I will turn myself in. However, it is a fact that the ""Seaman"" exhibition was held, so I would like to make that clear during questioning.

I wanted to start this volume with a choice, so I had the protagonist date different heroines in the opening and closing episodes. The subtitle ""Cross the Rubicon"" is a proverb that means ""to make a decision that cannot be reversed."" The outcome of that decision will be in the next volume.

Tidbits

What is the appeal of ""Magic: The Gathering"" as a game? It's difficult to explain in one sentence, but while writing this work, I feel that the biggest appeal is that you can reflect your own preferences and values ​​in the game. Choosing colors and deciding on the archetype of your deck. How many and what cards to put in your deck, and if it's a draft, what criteria to use for what picks. Do you prioritize winning, or not letting your opponent win? All of these reflect the player's preferences and values. To put it in more pretentious terms, it's ""self-expression.""

I tried to put this idea into the lines of the manager's master in episode 31. I felt it was a little rude to explain it at length, but if I were to say that, this commentary itself would be a mass of rudeness. It's too late now.

The famous line from the movie Ready Player One: ""I'm going with Gundam!"" Perhaps what I want to portray in the battle scenes of this work is that kind of firm self-expression.

I've been receiving some feedback from readers that the final episode may be approaching.

It's difficult to answer yes or no, but for the time being, I haven't received a cancellation notice, and I've been able to maintain a high level of motivation consistently since the one-shot. See you in the next volume, scheduled for release next year.

Yes, folks, while you're grappling with your morning coffee, a legion of startups is outsourcing mundane tasks to AI and reaping the benefits. From time-sucking inventory tagging to grueling data analysis, AI is lending a digital hand, transforming how small businesses operate.

Picture this: A thrift store in Denver harnessing AI power to tag inventory in just two minutes, when it used to take twenty. Thank you, Mr. AI Scanner, for turning a thrift store into a speed tagger’s dream. The startups that once took eons to familiarize new hires with grunt work are now paying even entry-level staff more because AI has reduced the workload significantly.

It's a cold, hard fact confirmed by a 2024 survey: a whopping 69% of small businesses are now AI converts—smarter, faster, and likely better caffeinated for it. But it’s not just thrift stores riding this AI wave. Whether it's automated coding, content creation, or applicant screening, AI is sliding into DMs—by which we mean 'Daily Manuals'—and changing the game.

The real question is, will AI continue to shine as the co-pilot for small businesses, or will it someday ask for a corner office? What’s your take on AI's role in your startup? Has it been a help or an overhyped hassle? Share your experiences below!",1,1740639623.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

I’m (64F),"Sorry this is so long. I got carried away with all the details but I really need advice.

What do you do when you love someone deeply that has RAGE issues that he refuses to get help for?  So I know I’m no prize but I am actively working on building up my self esteem and self love. I can say I’m retired (64F) but I’m really on SSDI for having severe migraines, depression and insomnia. Chronic migraines have destroyed my career that I loved. I was a senior graphic designer for 2 Fortune 500 companies and 1 Fortune 100 company. But I was a hardcore workaholic. So I 
moved in with a man who is what I used to be. He told me up front that his career came first. I once was that way so I felt like I could really understand where he was coming from and I love him so much that I thought I could handle it. He left his last job because he hated it. He was the operations manager of a multi million dollar high tech building and although he hated it he worked his but off. He got into a nasty argument with one of the tenants and I believe that was the last straw. 

So he finally quit. He’s been unemployed since last July or August. So now he spends all of his time day and night looking for a new job. I understand the stress of trying to find a new job, but have been very lucky in the past during my job search. He does extensive research before applying to any job and then spends an inordinate amount of time crafting his resume and cover letter so it’s very specific to that job. I think that is great however he may send out 1 application a day. I know from experience that it’s really a numbers game. He’s had maybe 4 or 5 interviews. He had to put together a half hour presentation for a job that he didn’t get. Every time I offer a suggestion he gets mad at me.

He keeps an erratic sleep schedule applying for jobs and gets extremely angry when I do something that wakes him up. I don’t do it on purpose and I need a calm, routine sleep schedule in my fight with insomnia. 

Since moving in together in October, I went through a total knee replacement, my headaches have become extremely bad with 2 trips to the ER, and my estranged little sister died. I’ve gotten no empathy from him. But I have gotten my bedroom desk and hutch overturned and my new iPhone 16 Pro thrown down the stairs because I accidentally woke him up. 

So today he takes a picture of some coffee beans that I had forgotten to reseal and sends it to me with a text message about what I did wrong. He got very irritated that I left a sponge in the sink and threw all of them out the kitchen window. I try my best to stay upstairs in the bedroom so I don’t bother him. Those are few examples of what he gets angry about.

He won’t go grocery shopping with me because he gets overstimulated by all the people. But he manages to go to Costco and spend $450 on groceries.

He lives in a beautiful 2 story home for free that his old boss owns. Due to his lack of money, I’ve been paying for all the groceries and household necessities but it’s still very hard for me to do so on my disability income. He won’t file for unemployment, food stamps or help with our $380 utility bill even though he’s been out of work since last August. There are 2 other people that live here for free. And I just found out today that he financed a vehicle for a coworker. He is not transparent about his finances but told me all he had was $600 cash. So I’m worried and stressed out about his finances.

The tension in the house is horrible. And he gets mad at any of my attempts to help. He refuses to go to therapy about his anger issues. He believes that smoking pot is his release but he hasn’t been able to smoke any weed since last August because he knows he’ll have to do a drug screen for any job he finds.

I am so conflicted about what to do. His resistance to address his issues through therapy at all and refuses to change or try to better himself. I feel compelled to leave for my own health and sanity even though I love him deeply. I have nowhere to go, no family and only a few friends. I can’t afford to live on my own and have been on the Section 8 housing list in every county surrounding Denver for four years. I desperately need some advice from Reddit. What do you think I should do?

The allergists want me to follow this diet for at least 2 weeks or so, and sent this as instructions:

*Please find a list of foods that contain high nickel content and can consider decreased intake for the next several weeks to evaluate improvement in itching.

1. Flour and Grains

Studies have shown that wheat flour contains 12.70 milligrams per kilogram. Other types of grain have also been found to contain high levels of nickel, including: 

		Oats

		Buckwheat

		Whole wheat

		Wheat germ

		Multi-grain breads and cereals

		Unpolished brown rice

2. Seeds

Sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, and alfalfa seeds 

3. Seafood

Seafood and shellfish, including shrimp, mussels, and crawfish, contain high amounts of nickel. A study found that some types of fish contain 0.08 milligrams of nickel. People with a nickel allergy should avoid fish, as nickel amounts vary by type and may be hard to track.

4. Legumes

Certain types of legumes contain high levels of nickel, including: 

		Chickpeas

		Lentils

		Peanuts

		Soybeans (and other soy products, including tofu) 

5. Vegetables
 
		Peak

		Leeks

		Cabbage

		Kale

		Spinach

		Lettuce

1iz9t2y,https://i.redd.it/6dot141kpmle1.jpeg,Review #3 - Alambique Serrano Single Cask #26 - Míranos,"Hello Again,
Another review of a Mírate single barrel pick from Alambique Serrano. Not much else to add so let's get started.


Nose: All spice and cinnamon dominate the nose, a minor amount of funk, coffee, and cane sugar hidden beneath the ABV.


Taste: More of that all spice and cinnamon from the nose, followed by a smokey sweet funk, pine sugar, and a smarties like ending note.


Finish: Totally coats your mouth and leaves with it a spiced candy note squarely on your tounge. The heat grows slowly and mellows out just the same leaving with it the spiced sweetness.


Overall: I'd put this at a 7/10 and think it beats out the single barrel #11 easily. I was a bit generous with #11 and it's scoring as it was missing the Alambique Serrano notes I enjoy while still being good juice, but I might've been too generous. There are a few things holding this bottle back from being a real knock out but is a bottle I'd consider buying again if possible.

1iz9rea,https://i.redd.it/xl3439wxomle1.jpeg,Light Roasts from BT | Review,"Hello Fellow Coffee Enthusiasts,

Welcome to my review on these two light roasted coffee beans from Blue Tokai, Amaltas Blend and Hidden Falls Estate. I have used these coffees for about a couple of weeks now after resting them for two weeks. 

Equipment Used: Hario V60 (plastic)

Grinder Used: Timemore C2 at 17-18 clicks 

Methods Used: I used Hoffman’s 1-cup V60 method for the first week and Tetsu Kasuya’s 4:6 method for the second week. I found that the 4:6 method worked relatively better with both these coffees. The flavours were more vibrant with this method. So, my review of both these coffees would be based on the coffee extracted using the 4:6 method.

Amaltas Blend | Review: The flavours are quite subtle and it delivers the promised acidity. It’s not that sweet. There’s slight hint of blueberry but it’s quite mellow. For the price of about Rs. 540/- (I bought at a discounted price using referral code at Rs. 440/-), it’s really good. 

Hidden Falls Estate | Review: It is much better than the Amaltas Blend. It’s really sweet and the acidity is also right on the dot. The fragrance of the coffee beans is pretty similar to sweet and fresh mangos. Hence, the notes of mango are quite prominent in the extracted coffee. It’s a punchy, vibrant and fresh coffee, much better than the Amaltas Blend (that explains the price difference). I bought it during BT Payday Sale for just Rs. 544/-. The MRP of Rs. 680/- is also justified for this coffee. 

If you made this far, thank you for reading my thoughts. And, here a bonus tip for you: the coffee extraction was much better when I created a swirl/vortex-like pattern on the coffee bed using a chopstick. ",10,1740638841.0,IndiaCoffee,9,1.0,False

1iz9ox2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1iz9ox2/emotionally_unavailable/,Emotionally Unavailable,"Hi All

  
I'm a 28 year old male who went on 9ish dates with a female who, 2/3 weeks ago ended things with me stating ""there was no deep or emotional connection"".  She is 100% correct. We were going really well together at the start, however I think we hit some roadblocks for two issues. 

1. **Attachment Styles** i think was a minor factor to the ending is our attachment styles of FA (me) and DA (her), and we struggled to handle that with good communication. (I dont fully know how she feels however i think that she was emotionally overwhelmed by the whole experience? again im just speculating).
2. **Emotionally Unavailable**  i think this is the major component, is that I'm emotionally unavailable. I wont go into it, however I had a traumatic year in high school (decade ago) of serious bullying before changing schools, while also being friendzones a few times in my early twenties which really shut me off emotionally. (First girl told her friends she was doing it on purpose for the attention which ended up fkin me up emotionally, second was my fault because I just didnt give off anything but friend vibes). 

I think every relationship requires some level of emotional vulnerability, and I didnt give off any because I locked every negative emotional in a cage and just appear as this ""sweet boy"". Which makes anything beyond first and second date hard because people need to see the real me, good bad and ugly. Also there needs to be vulnerability in flirting, sexual tension and building it.

I have since started taking therpy (which identified the emotional unavailability) and I'm on the road to open myself up emotionally. I'm also on a self improvement journey, going to the gym again, playing sports, hanging out with friends (who are all amazing).

  
My Question:

She sent the breakup text 2/3 weeks ago with our last contact being 2 weeks ago. I want to see if I can rekindle our spark and maybe go on another date or catch up. I want to show her the real me because i genuinely think we can build something special. I want to show her that she deserves someone that can give her the emotional needs and im on the recovery to provide that. 

My thought is to wait 2 weeks to see if she contacts me, if not I was going to reach out and see how she is and maybe see if we can grab a coffee.

Is this a smart idea? Should i just wait if she messages me back (incase her leaving was because she was emotionally overwhelmed as a DA) or should I message her because I want to acknowledge I didn't give her the emotions she deserves however I think im resolving this and our second chance will be different.

The last thing i want to do is come across as desperate, however I do really like this girl and I feel like these ""issues"" are not giving us a chance to see the real us together.

[Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/s/r1uMCAJaNR)

#Captain Laura Smith's Ship Rules for the E.C.S Perseverance Because, Apparently, Everyone I Hire is a Moron

1. No hooking up with other species. Don't want you guys contracting some weird space STD. Especially since the treatment they have is likely to not work with humans.

2. If you have contracted a weird space STD, no hooking up with other members of the crew. I don't want the whole ship to have space AIDS or something like that.

3. You know what? Just no hooking up in general. If you do anyways (because I know you will), at least try to not make it obvious. It's a small ship, so rumors spread fast. I don't want that awkwardness and neither do you. (Addendum: It's a massive fucking ship, but most of that is not where people are, so point still stands.)

4. Don't get pregnant 

5. Don't get someone else pregnant.

6. Use comic sans while typing up reports for me. It's specifically designed for people who have a hard time reading like myself.

7. Don't eat at any consoles. We have a mess hall for a reason and I don't want to explain why one of the consoles has peanut butter in it again. You know who you are.

8. Don't eat near the antimatter reactor. I'd rather die to an enemy ship than a ham sandwich.

9. I can't believe I have to say this, but don't dispose of ammunition in the toilet. You know who you are. You destroyed the plumbing and wasted good ammunition.

10. I know it's already illegal, but no sexual assault. I swear to whatever diety you believe in that if you do that, I'll leave you stranded on some barely habitable rock somewhere in the middle of nowhere and make sure the entire galaxy knows how much of piece of cr*p you are.

11. No skateboarding down the halls, especially near the airlocks. Last time someone did that, they almost killed the entire ship.

12. If you're going to build ancient artillery, at least properly test it. Preferably on camera, with explosives, and while everyone watches from a safe distance.

13. No pets unless they can fight.

14. Your pet also needs to be small enough to fit through the doors, Kyle.

15. No racist jokes unless they're about the French.

16. Please, for the love of all that's holy, take a shower every morning. This air is recycled.

17. No beans. This air is recycled.

18. Only use approved perfumes and colognes. They're approved because no one is allergic to them and, again, this air is recycled. You can find the list here: ShipNetwork/RulesAndRegulations/AllowedItems/PerfumesAndColognes

19. Don't fight each other.

20. If you get in a fight, win.

Addendum Concerning Non-Human Crew Mates (Yenküshemin)

1. Stop trying to scare Yenküshemin with misleading though technically true facts about the human body 

2. This one's for our chefs: There must be food options that don't contain capsaicin 

3. All lights in a public room must be the same color as to not throw off Yenküshemin's vision. Last time someone gave the mess hall bisexual lighting, he kept running into sh*t. While it was funny, I don't want to replace more furniture.

4. Yenküshemin isn't French, so no being racist. We've had no problems so far, but just to be sure.

5. You know rules 1, and 3 of the original rule set? Guess what? Hooking up with Yenküshemin qualifies as both. Sorry to tell you, but two wrongs just makes two reprimands.

6. If you do end up kissing Yenküshemin, please tell me how that works; I want to know. For purely scientific reasons, of course.

7. Don't play catch with Yenküshemin using artillery. I know he can take it, but the ship probably can't if you miss.

8. Stop pestering Yenküshemin with questions about toreeyan biology. It's annoying and weird. Imagine if he kept asking you about your organs.

9. Less of a rule and more like solid life advice: Don't get in a fist fight with Yenküshemin. His species used to tunnel into mountains by punching them.

10. No giving Yenküshemin tap dancing lessons. His reverse joint legs and ability to completely ignore the various forces trying to slow down his foot would probably do a number on the flooring.

———————————————

When Zoey woke up, Yenküshemin was already at work. Fortunately, she still had a few more hours before she needed to be at the hydroponics bay. So, she went to the bathroom and washed off her makeup.

Zoey tried her best to be stealthy as she made her way to her quarters. She took a long, hot shower and got ready for the day. By the time she got to the mess hall for breakfast, rumors were already spreading. Why didn't she go back to her quarters? Was her mental breakdown really that bad?

Fortunately, for every person spreading the rumor about her hooking up with Yenküshemin, there was someone ready to point out how they'd be physically unable to. Zoey felt deeply uncomfortable.

It wasn't long before the two were called into the Captain's office.

""I understand there's a rumor going around that the two of you got together. I also understand that uh... There are convincing arguments as to how that's impossible which I feel far to uncomfortable to repeat here. I would like to clear up the ambiguity.""

Yenküshemin was the first to speak after an uncomfortably but not suspiciously long pause. ""Excuse me?""

""I wanna know whether or not you broke rules one and three of the original guidelines.""

This time, Zoey answered. ""No, of course not. Don't know him well enough to be interested. Besides, look at him. I don't think we physically could.""

""Then, may I ask why you were seen leaving Yenküshemin's quarters?""

""That is a private matter.""

""Well, if I'm going to put out a statement clearing all this up, I need something to go with. Can you at least give me a half truth?""

""We were having coffee while collaborating on a research paper about the similarities between toreeyan biology and Earth plants. Zoey fell asleep while we were working and I did not wish to wake her,"" Yenküshemin suggested. ""On that note, do we have time in our schedule to drop by a Galactic Federation space station? I apparently cannot grasp human mugs and thus need to get my own.""

""I'll see if we have the time for that. For now, I shall leave out the coffee from my statement because to prevent further rumors. Wait a minute. How did you drink your coffee if you can't pick up a mug?""

""Through a 'silly straw'.""

------

In recent years, many companies have begun mandating a return to the office (RTO), reversing the remote work trends that gained momentum during the COVID-19 pandemic. While these policies are often justified with claims of improved productivity, collaboration, and company culture, a closer examination reveals deeper, systemic forces at play. 

### **The Profit Motive Behind RTO [TLDR]** 

At the heart of RTO mandates lies a critical truth: Any corporation is fundamentally a node in a large network of the capitalist market. To accurately investigate the motivations behind these policies, we must look at the big picture and examine the system as a whole. 

Executives and board members often have diversified investment portfolios in industries beyond their own companies. These investments include but are not limited to real estate, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, consumer goods, and entertainment. RTO policies indirectly boost these sectors by driving consumption, stabilizing property values, and increasing demand for healthcare services. By forcing employees back into traditional office settings, RTO mandates serve the interests of a broader economic system that prioritizes profit over people.

### **The Consumption Engine**

One of the most significant yet understated reasons for RTO mandates is their role in driving consumption. When employees return to the office, they inevitably spend more money on goods and services that they might otherwise avoid or minimize while working remotely. Commuting requires expenditures on gas, public transportation, car maintenance, and parking. Office workers are more likely to purchase coffee, lunches, and snacks from external vendors, boosting revenue for food and beverage businesses. Additionally, the time constraints imposed by commuting and office hours leave employees with less time for cooking, cleaning, and other household tasks. This creates a reliance on convenience services like food delivery, meal kits, and cleaning services, further driving up consumption.

The ripple effects extend to entertainment and leisure. After long commutes and exhausting workdays, employees are more likely to engage in passive, mindless activities like binge-watching Netflix or scrolling through social media. These behaviors benefit companies in the entertainment and tech sectors, which thrive on user engagement and subscription revenue. In this way, RTO policies act as a catalyst for a consumption-driven economy, ensuring that money continues to flow through various industries.

### **Real Estate and Urban Economies**

Another critical factor behind RTO mandates is their impact on real estate markets. During the pandemic, the value of commercial real estate plummeted as offices sat empty, creating financial instability for property owners and investors. By forcing employees back into offices, companies artificially prop up demand for office spaces, stabilizing or even increasing property values. This benefits real estate investors, many of whom are wealthy individuals or institutional investors with significant influence over corporate decision-making.

Moreover, offices drive foot traffic to urban centers, supporting local businesses like restaurants, retail stores, and service providers. This creates a ripple effect that benefits the broader economy, particularly in cities where commercial real estate is a major economic driver. In this context, RTO policies are not just about individual companies but about maintaining the economic vitality of urban areas and the real estate market.

### **Healthcare and the Profit of Poor Health**

The healthcare industry, particularly in hyper-capitalist economies like the United States, also stands to gain from RTO mandates. By forcing employees into stressful, time-consuming, and often unhealthy work environments, these policies contribute to a rise in physical and mental health issues. Commuting, micromanagement, and the lack of autonomy in office settings lead to chronic stress, burnout, and dissatisfaction, driving demand for mental health services, including therapy, counseling, and medication. The pharmaceutical industry benefits from increased prescriptions for antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, and other drugs.

On the physical health front, office work often involves long hours of sitting or standing in one place, contributing to issues like obesity, cardiovascular disease, and musculoskeletal disorders. The stress and exhaustion from commuting and office work can weaken the immune system and lead to chronic conditions like hypertension, diabetes, and sleep disorders. These conditions require ongoing medical care, medications, and interventions, all of which are profitable for the healthcare industry. In a system where healthcare is a for-profit business, the more people who need medical services, the more revenue is generated for hospitals, clinics, pharmaceutical companies, and insurance providers.

### **Systemic Reinforcement of Capitalism**

At its core, the push for RTO is a reflection of the broader capitalist system, which thrives on constant growth and consumption. By forcing employees back into traditional work structures, the system ensures that spending patterns remain aligned with market needs. This benefits not just individual companies but the entire network of interconnected industries. RTO policies reinforce traditional power structures where employers have greater control over employees’ time and lives. This control extends beyond the workplace, influencing how people spend their money and time, which in turn benefits the broader capitalist system. Remote work, by contrast, challenges the status quo by decentralizing labor and reducing dependency on urban centers and traditional consumption patterns. RTO mandates can thus be seen as a way to resist systemic change and maintain the existing economic order.

### **Ethical and Social Implications**

The systemic forces driving RTO mandates raise serious ethical concerns. By prioritizing profit over well-being, these policies exploit employees’ physical and mental health for economic gain. The resulting stress, burnout, and health issues create a vicious cycle where employees become more reliant on healthcare services, further entrenching them in a system that profits from their suffering. This dynamic underscores the need for a fundamental rethinking of work, health, and capitalism itself.

There is a moment in Hannibal that is both beautiful and predatory, which is standard fare for this show—but what makes it remarkable is that it gives us Will laughing.

This is a mythical thing, seeing Will Graham laugh, because it happens so infrequently over three seasons. And if you count them, those rare moments are almost entirely shared with Hannibal. That alone makes this first laugh—a real, unguarded, emotional reaction—significant and substantial.

In the very first episode (*Aperitif)*, Hannibal arrives unannounced at Will’s motel room—a move that is both bold and intrusive, Will is not a man who welcomes visitors.

And yet, he laughs with Hannibal.

Why? What does that signify?

Hannibal tells Will that Jack sees him as *""a fragile little teacup, the finest China used only for special guests.""* And Will laughs heartily.

The absurdity of the statement is what makes it so funny to him.

Jack sees Will as breakable, unstable, emotionally unfit for the field—someone who needs protection.

But the irony is, Will is already living inside the minds of murderers, enduring extreme psychological stress—and yet, he hasn’t shattered.

He knows he is emotionally unstable, but he doesn’t see himself as delicate.

Rather, he sees himself as burdened. Maybe even cursed. But not weak.

He knows he has darkness in him. He buries that knowledge, but it’s there.

The laughter is his subconscious acknowledging the contradiction inside him—how others see him versus what he knows to be true.

It’s a brief moment of irony, absurdity, and truth all at once.

But then Hannibal shifts the narrative—placing himself apart from Jack in a way Will can’t ignore.  

*""I see you as the mongoose I want under the house when the snake slithers by.""*

Will stops laughing. The amusement—it’s gone. He just stares at Hannibal. Silent. Almost studying him.

Jack sees a fragile thing. Hannibal sees something formidable.

Jack sees a man who needs saving. Hannibal sees a man who needs setting free.

Jack sees a tool—Hannibal sees a kindred spirit.

This is a reframing, and Will isn’t used to being positioned as something sharp rather than something breakable.

He’s used to being misunderstood, recognized for his instability, a problem to be managed. Most people irritate Will, unsettle him, or at best, exhaust him.

But Hannibal? He makes Will laugh. And he talks to him like no one else ever has.

This marks the beginning of Hannibal’s influence. The first time Hannibal frames the narrative of who Will truly is—not a vulnerable man, but a complex, powerful one. He is studying Will’s reactions, testing his emotional responses, and planting the first seeds of their connection. 

Hannibal starts his psychological seduction of Will right there.

From chronic back pain  - being bed ridden for 3 years - digestive issues etc

For almost 1.5 years I've been battling with gut health specifically..

It's been so fucking frustrating. 

That feeling of eating literally anything and in 30 mins 

Your symptoms just appear and amplify your terrible existence for the entire day 

• Bloating

• Indigestion (literally food appearing undigested in toilet bowl)

• Diarrhea 

• Brainfog / mental confusion 
 ( Which is my worst. I can't have a normal conversation and keep up with people's train of thought because of how bad this gets)

• excessive belching ( This happens like almost everyday. So annoying)

• Gut discomfort when fasted (I'd have so much movement in my gut)

• Irregular stool (I don't have a formed stool. It's always clumps or diarrhea)

• Fatigue: I'd feel tired sometimes mm even after consuming so much sugar 

• depression: (I hated this the most. I genuinely wanted my life to end..)

• 0 Libido : as a 27 year old man I really hate this. I am not like how I used to be in my teenage years. It's sad .

Gas: after eating fruits/ fructose . It's just constant unfortunately
-

For the past 6 months I've been trying food diets just to see if I can fix this

No I haven't taken Rifaximin or even consulted any doctor. 

Whether that be functional medicine or allopathic.

I don't really have money for that so I can't afford no $500 dollar tests and expensive consultation fees 

Also I genuinely have lost trust in the medical system due to my past experiences dealing with other health problems..

I took things into my own hands and did daily experiments on my self 

I decided to try foods individually to see which foods triggered it .

To make this post short 

For the past 7 days I've been on this carnivore diet.  

And for the first time I've been feeling amazing.

All of those symptoms began to subside and I have never felt any better.

I've tried only white rice diet 

Didnt work

Tried a fruit diet. 

Consisting of bananas , date , apppes. Didn't work 

I tried a liquid diet maybe cuz it was the fiber .
(Orange juice , apple juice , white sugar, maple syrup, honey)

Didnt work. 

For the first time I've actually realized something that works. 

I've been eating just these:

Greek yogurt 
Ghee
Olive oil 
Eggs 
Ground beef
Chicken breast 
Whey protein isolate chocolate flavor (stevia sweetened) 
Coffee 

Now don't ask me why and how it works. But my assumption is that I'm starving the bacteria that feed on sugar. 

Protein and fats were the only things that were easy on my gut. 

It's hard to stick to because you'll crave sugar like hell but if you do you might have found a solution 

Anyways i don't really know what more should i talk about in this post but ill update my progress or feel free to ask any questions...

I just can't believe diet can fix such problem...

1iz9bva,https://www.reddit.com/r/SingaporeRaw/comments/1iz9bva/thoughts_on_ben_leongs_post_in_response_to_pritam/,Thoughts on Ben Leong's post in response to Pritam Singh's comments on GST,"I personally think that Ben Leong's responses are superficial and reductionist, keeping aside how poorly written the post was, as they ignore key economic consequences and attempt to dismiss concerns without addressing structural and macroeconomic realities.

Leong tried to frame the GST hike as a minor, inevitable adjustment that has minimal real-world impact. His analogy argument is fundamentally flawed.

1. Oversimplified analogy

Leong’s argument hinges on the idea that a 1% GST increase only leads to a 1% price hike. This is an overly simplistic and misleading claim because it ignores second-order effects:

\- GST is applied at multiple stages of the supply chain (importers, wholesalers, retailers), leading to cumulative price increases.

\- Businesses do not just pass on a 1% increase. They round prices up to convenient psychological price points. A $1.10 coffee isn’t going to $1.11, it’s going to $1.20.

\- When costs increase for businesses, they adjust wages, supplier contracts, and future pricing expectations, causing multiplier effects.

Even if the direct tax effect is 1%, its real-world impact is much larger because of how pricing behaviour works.

2. Ignoring timing issue

Singh’s argument was about the timing of the hike amid high inflation and a fiscal surplus. Leong did not address this. Instead, he deflected with weak justifications like ""businesses will increase prices anyway.""

\- Singapore was already experiencing high inflation (\~4-5%), with food and essentials becoming significantly more expensive.

\- Government finances were strong, with larger-than-expected fiscal surpluses (projected S$778 million, actual S$6.4 billion).

\- Policy Alternatives Existed: The government could have delayed the GST hike without jeopardizing public finances.

The issue isn’t whether GST should increase but whether it should have been delayed to avoid exacerbating inflation during an already high-cost period.

3. Fail to justify why GST hike is necessary despite budget surpluses

One of Singh’s key points was that past government projections have consistently underestimated surpluses, yet the government pushed forward with the GST hike without re-evaluating its necessity.

\- 2024 Budget originally projected a S$778 million surplus but ended up with S$6.4 billion.

\- Singapore has large past reserves, meaning it can afford to be flexible in tax adjustments.

If the government consistently underestimates surpluses, why is a GST hike immediately necessary, and why isn’t alternative revenue generation (such as wealth and higher coprorate taxes) explored first?

4. Ignoring the middle income and below

GST is a regressive tax, meaning lower-income groups pay a larger proportion of their income than higher-income earners. While the government has offset packages, these are only temporary relief measures.

\- For middle and lower income groups, essentials like food, utilities, and transport already take up a big part of their income. A GST increase means immediate pain.

\- Higher income groups and large corporations experience almost no real impact. This is why alternative taxation methods (like wealth or corporate tax increases) should be prioritized instead.

Raising GST disproportionately affects those who can least afford it, making it a lazy and inequitable way to fund long-term expenses.

5. Leong's post is just trying to sensationalise instead of engaging with facts

Shanmugam's support, in particular, further sidesteps Singh’s actual argument and frames it as political opportunism instead of addressing the macroeconomic issues at play.

Leong’s kopi analogy is a clear attempt to oversimplify an issue that requires serious debate. He deliberately reduces the discussion to micro-level pricing mechanics while ignoring structural inflation, timing concerns, and income disparity effects.

Instead of serious economic discussion, they resort to soundbites and emotional appeals to dismiss valid concerns.

Food for thought:

1. Why would the government always be prudent with budget setting and ending up with surpluses?
2. Where do you think those surpluses will go to? i'm pretty sure its fat bonuses for the incumbents.",31,1740637050.0,SingaporeRaw,47,0.81,False
