I’m a student working with a small team on a platform called **Meentd**, a local platform which we’ve just launched at [**https://meentd.com**](https://meentd.com/) and which is intended for italian market now at the beginning.  
We’re now looking for **early users who are willing to test it and give honest feedback**.

The platform explores a different way of connecting people. Instead of profiles, feeds, or swiping, everything revolves around **queries** — short posts where users clearly state what they want to do or what they’re looking for.

Examples:

* “Anyone up for a coffee or walk?”
* “Looking for a tennis partner”
* “Offering / looking for paid services or work”
* “Searching for or offering accommodation”
* “Travel buddies or local meetups”
* Romantic or non-romantic connections

The core idea is **intent over performance**: connections based on what people want to do, not how they present themselves.

* where do you hesitate or get confused?
* what feels unnecessary, missing, or unclear?
* which possible fixes would you propose?
* does this actually solve a real problem, or not?

Trust and safety are central to the project:

* identity verification
* no bots or fake accounts
* basic moderation and security checks
* designed to feel calm and respectful

This isn’t monetization-driven — it’s a learning project built voluntarily and out of passion and love for people and genuine connections, and feedback matters more to us than growth at this stage.

If you’re open to trying it out and sharing honest thoughts (good or bad), I’d really appreciate it.  
Comments, criticism, and suggestions are all welcome.

I'm 41 and have a 13mm overjet, including a baby tooth to the side with the Orthdontist said would be removed.

I spoke with them around May last year and the treatment would include the fixings to teeth, plus **rubber bands**.

Back then, I decided against treatment as the images produced from the simulation looked so underwhelming. They also warned that treatment would take more than 2 years. 

My issue is the impact to daily life for such a prolonged period. I'm just not sure this is something I could or would want to tolerate. 

**Questions**

*I know some of these should be directed to Dentist, but I am considering going back for another consultation and just want a general community reply*

1. **Regrets** \- Some have openly said they regret the decision as they're now in an endless cycle of more and more trays. Do you regret it or wish you'd never started? 
2. **Elastics -** Do the elastics have to be worn throughout the ENTIRE treatment and daily use? I've read differing things on this as some I Think said it was just for 6 months, some was only at night, etc. 
3. **Caffeine lovers** \- what do you do? I love coffee through the day. I don't want to remove and put back in. Cold coffee is an option but not that appealing. I do have the odd energy drink and although I know they're bad I like them 
4. **Holidays** \- Daily and normal use would be fine but what about on holiday, like where you're abroad and regularly snacking? 
5. **Days Out** \- similarly, what do you do if you're out for the day, for work or meeting friends or something. Do you (particularly males) bring a toothbrush? 
6. **Alcohol** \- particularly red wine. I watched one video and the person said this is fine, it's just good practice to drink around the time of a tray change just so that if there is staining, it's being changed anyway. 
7. **Do you really get used to it?** I can tolerate a week of regrets, pain etc. But do you really honestly get used to them? Does it become managable and just part of daily life or is it CONSTANTLY annoying, uncomfortable etc... Especially considering 2-3 years of use?

1q4hyyh,https://i.redd.it/z63e44yx9ibg1.png,Does this look normal?,"I'm 21 and have always had a handful of vague issues that, on their own, drs havent done much with. I had a metabolic blood panel recently, I drank a cup of coffee and ate a snickers about 30 minutes before it. When the results came in my blood sugar was 70mg/dL. My dr said everything looked normal in her chart message, when I pointed out my blood sugar was bordering on low after eating she didnt respond.

For the holidays I spent 4-5hrs on my feet cooking. I ate a delicious big meal and was absolutely exhausted after. Its normal for me to feel super tired after meals (I avoid eating at work or when going out because of this), but I felt worse than usual and passed out on the couch. That's also not normal for me, I can hardly even nap. A family member uses a CGM and offered to let me use their glucose monitor since I'd mentioned being frusterated from my dr. I felt really sluggish so decided to go home, when I tested my blood sugar I was at 59mg/dL. Ate a tortilla and it went up to 103

I messaged my Dr again and she didnt comment at all on the situation being abnormal. I asked for a cgm but she said it wasnt appropriate unless I am diabetic. She prescribed me a glucose monitor instead and said to check my blood sugar when I feel symptomatic (tired and dizzy), eat complex carbs if its low, then recheck in 15 minutes

I've been checking but havent caught another big drop. Today, yesterday technically, I slept awful and had a migraine when I woke up. I could hardly feel my hands when and my vision was fading/dizzy everytime I stood. I had to pick myself 3 times to get a drop of blood, I was kinda frusterated in a weird way my blood sugar wasnt bad. I checked it twice in the morning just to be sure. 

I'm just so tired of not having answers. I tried to drop my blood sugar on purpose today and had a bagel + doughnut for breakfast. I felt awful. I was exhausted, my heart was racing and my limbs felt heavy for a few hours after. My blood sugar never dropped though. Even after dinner and now in the middle of the night it hasnt dropped. I've noticed when I eat something carb heavy my hands and face will get really puffy and I'll have a headache too. Not sure if that is related to anything but the headache is what woke me up tonight. So not only did my plan fail, but I also look/feel worse for trying

I know its good my blood sugar hasnt dropped but I almost wish it would just so I'd be able to show my dr I'm not faking. My neurologist suspects I have POTS. When I mentioned this to my dr she didnt think so, she just ordered a bunch of bloodwork and had me schedule a follow up months out to revisit my ""chronic dizziness""

Despite there not being another significant drop, I dont think these values are normal? Or are they? My blood sugar is normal when I wake up, but immediately after eating its not anywhere near 170-200 and 2-3hrs later isn't usually down to 120-140. I'd really appreciate some advice or guidance from people who have experince with this

It's hard figuring out a chronic illness with shitty state insurance. Before this I hadnt seen my pcp in almost two years because I gave up trying and I'm hitting that same wall now. I have a much better support system now who encourages me to advocate for myself, but its hard when I feel like a faker or not really ""bad enough"". Even if blood sugar isnt an underlying issue it would be nice to understand these readings better. I dont know much about blood sugar and everything I try to read about shows much higher values for diabetes or significant drops for hypoglycemia",1,1767607947.0,Hypoglycemia,0,1.0,False

In the fast-paced world of Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG), brand managers often struggle to ensure perfect execution across the vast and varied Indian market. A single missed detail – an out-of- stock item, an untrained promoter, or a retailer unaware of a scheme – can mean lost sales and eroded trust. OpenReach, India’s leading field marketing and brand experience agency, is addressing these challenges through a story of integration and innovation. With over 5,000 on-ground professionals reaching millions of households across 900+ cities and towns, OpenReach weaves together trained people, cutting-edge digital tools, and data-driven processes to deliver end-to-end value. This blog post explores how OpenReach is transforming the FMCG ecosystem – driving brand sales through omnipresent promoters, empowering retailers via transparent e-payments, generating youth employment, rigorously training its teams, equipping field officers with tech, and providing real-time insights that were once unimaginable. It’s a journey of transparency, trust, and executional excellence, offering brand managers a compelling strategic partner.

# Reaching Consumers Everywhere: Trained Promoters Driving Sales

For FMCG brands, visibility and engagement at the last mile are paramount. OpenReach deploys trained sales promoters and merchandisers across every channel – from modern trade outlets and supermarkets to general trade kirana stores deep in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities. These promoters don’t stop at shops; they take brands to gyms, open-air markets, residential societies, and corporate parks, meeting consumers where they live, work, and play. Picture a promoter offering sample protein bars at a local gym, or a merchandiser ensuring a new snack brand’s display stands out in a neighborhood grocery. By engaging consumers at every touchpoint, these on-ground teams actively influence purchase decisions and build brand awareness in ways mass media alone cannot.

 

Importantly, OpenReach’s model is not about scattering freelance promoters with minimal oversight – it is a fully managed service with end-to-end ownership. The company handles everything from promoter recruitment and training to daily attendance tracking, sales monitoring, and performance management “under one roof”. In practice, this means a brand manager can launch a campaign knowing that OpenReach will staff it with the right people, monitor each promoter’s daily sales or sampling numbers, ensure merchandising standards are met, and quickly replace or retrain underperformers. Whether the goal is short-term product trial or sustained sales growth, OpenReach commits to hitting the targets it agrees upon – effectively taking full ownership of on-ground outcomes. This integrated approach relieves brand managers from coordinating multiple vendors or worrying about on-field execution details. OpenReach becomes an extension of the brand team, translating strategy into action on the store floor with agility and accountability.

 

The impact on sales is direct. By having a human presence in stores and communities, OpenReach helps brands cut through the noise and connect with consumers. A promoter who can explain a product’s benefits or run an in-store demo can convert curious shoppers into buyers on the spot. A well-trained merchandiser can negotiate better shelf placement and ensure stock replenishment, preventing lost sales. And by being present in non-traditional venues like society events or office parks, OpenReach opens new avenues for brands to reach potential customers. In essence, OpenReach’s army of promoters creates a ubiquitous brand presence, driving sales in places and ways traditional advertising cannot.

# Empowering Retailers through Transparent E-Payments and Schemes

https://preview.redd.it/tn6lm88l8ibg1.jpg?width=840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=13bcbced773a4c5587ca797f4d61d58861ad7955

 While promoters influence consumers, another critical stakeholder in the FMCG ecosystem is the retailer. India has over 13 million retail outlets – the kirana shops, chemists, pan-bidi stalls, and supermarkets that are the backbone of FMCG distribution. For years, small retailers have faced challenges participating in company schemes and promotions. They often learn about new schemes late (if at all) and rely on distributors’ word-of-mouth. Incentive payouts, like credit notes or cash-back for achieving sales targets, can be delayed or opaque, hurting the retailer’s cash flow and trust in the brand. OpenReach recognized that empowering retailers with speed and transparency would not only improve retailer relationships but also ultimately boost sales of the brand.

 

OpenReach’s end-to-end digital E-Payment Payout Solution is a game changer. It ensures every retailer knows about a brand’s incentive schemes from Day One without depending on distributors. Upon onboarding, the retailer installs the OpenPay mobile app, which immediately displays all active schemes, targets, and rewards in the retailer’s preferred language. Whether a shop owner is in a metro city or a remote town, they can clearly understand the scheme conditions and track their progress. The app shows, in real time, how much they’ve earned from each scheme and even provides a 12-month history of incentives, bringing unprecedented clarity. No more guesswork or waiting for a distributor’s visit – the retailer is always in the loop and in control.

 

This transparency has profound effects on retailer behavior and loyalty. When a scheme payout is due, the system deposits the incentive directly into the retailer’s bank account and triggers an instant SMS notification of the credit. Suddenly, the old cycle of waiting weeks for a credit note is replaced by near-immediate reward. This boost in cash flow and trust motivates retailers to engage more actively with the brand’s programs. As the OpenPay app shows their earnings grow, many retailers have started increasing their stock orders in both frequency and quantity to capitalize on schemes. Essentially, by guaranteeing timely, transparent payouts, OpenReach turns schemes into a two-way promise: the brand promises quick reward and the retailer promises greater sales effort.

 

Such mutual confidence leads to higher loyalty. A kirana owner who reliably receives their incentive every month feels valued and “seen” by the brand. They are more likely to push that brand’s products to customers, dedicate eye-level shelf space, or participate in future promotions. OpenReach’s own data and experience bear this out – transparent digital schemes build real trust. As one voiceover in the OpenReach narrative notes, when kirana stores see timely deposits, “their confidence in the program grows, their motivation increases, and their relationship with the brand becomes much stronger”. In a sense, OpenReach has digitized and democratized trade promotions: any retailer, no matter how small or remote, can join a scheme with a few taps and reap the rewards without hassle. This level of inclusion and empowerment is reshaping brand-retailer dynamics across India’s ₹900 billion FMCG market, fostering a network of loyal retailers who trust the brand’s promises.

# Generating Employment and Opportunity Across India

https://preview.redd.it/mrlpw7ft8ibg1.jpg?width=840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=027206f7f540f0cb965fdc3fa73deed9aab93e2f

 Behind every successful in-store campaign or retailer onboarding drive is a team of dedicated people on the ground. OpenReach’s model has a significant side-effect: it is creating thousands of jobs and upskilling youth across urban and rural India. With a footprint in over 900 cities and towns and teams that speak the local language, OpenReach actively recruits from the communities where it operates. Young men and women from semi-urban districts, small towns, and rural regions are being hired as sales promoters, field officers, customer onboarding specialists, and more. By mobilizing local talent, OpenReach not only ensures language and cultural compatibility in each area, but also opens the door for these individuals to build careers in the FMCG and retail sector.

Today, OpenReach has over 5,000 professionals on the ground executing campaigns and engaging with retailers. These are not temporary gig workers; they are full-time team members who undergo training (and retraining), work with advanced tools, and deliver results every day. For many, this is a first formal job that provides stable income and professional development. A college graduate in a Tier-3 town might join as a promoter for a few stores in their area – after a year of good performance, they could become a team leader supervising others, or move into a field officer role handling retailer onboarding. OpenReach’s growth from a zero-investor startup to a ₹100 crore enterprise was, as the company acknowledges, “made possible by our people” who have become “true partners in our mission”.

The employment generation goes beyond just numbers. It’s also about skill development and youth empowerment. OpenReach recruits often from colleges or local institutes, especially looking for youths with aptitude and attitude even if they lack prior experience. By placing them in real-world sales scenarios with strong guidance and tech support, OpenReach is building a new workforce of savvy, street-smart sales and marketing professionals. In a country where educated unemployment is a challenge, such initiatives provide a valuable bridge. The ripple effects are significant: incomes earned are spent in local economies, and the work experience gained by these youths increases their future employability (whether within OpenReach’s expanding operations or elsewhere). There’s also a sense of pride and ownership – a promoter in a small town isn’t just a nameless contractor; they are part of a nationally coordinated team bringing big brands to their hometown’s stores. This human impact of OpenReach’s model underscores a larger point: when you integrate social objectives (jobs, skill-building) with business goals (sales, distribution), you create a more sustainable and inclusive growth path for the FMCG ecosystem.

#  Structured Training: Grooming an Elite Field Force

How does OpenReach ensure that thousands of dispersed field personnel maintain high quality and consistent standards? The answer lies in its structured in-house training ecosystem. This is not ad-hoc or “one and done” training – it’s a continuous learning journey that blends classroom instruction with hands-on practice. Every promoter and merchandiser goes through a rigorous onboarding program covering four core pillars: Product Knowledge, Grooming & Professional Etiquette, Consumer Engagement, and Sales Excellence. They learn the features and unique selling points of the products they will promote, so they can speak confidently and accurately. They are coached in personal grooming, body language, and etiquette – essential for making a positive impression during in-store interactions. They practice consumer engagement techniques, from approaching shoppers and pitching products to handling objections and educating customers. And they are drilled in sales excellence tactics like closing techniques and upselling, so that every consumer interaction has the best chance of converting into a sale.

Critically, training at OpenReach also emphasizes compliance and execution standards, such as planogram adherence and the correct use of point-of-sale materials. Promoters are taught that it’s not just what they do but how they execute that drives success. A product may need to be placed on a specific shelf position as per a planogram – if it’s misplaced, sales can suffer. Therefore, trainees learn to treat merchandising guidelines as gospel. They also learn to report their work digitally: every participant gets hands-on training with OpenReach’s digital tools for reporting, sales tracking, and compliance monitoring. For instance, they practice using a mobile app to check in to a store, upload a shelf photo, or record sales data, so that by the time they hit the field, they are comfortable with technology. This tech training ensures that data from the field flows back in real time (more on that later) and that promoters can be audited for compliance (e.g., did they actually visit all assigned stores and set up the displays).

Training doesn’t stop after the initial induction. “Continuous Learning, Continuous Growth” is a mantra ingrained in OpenReach’s culture. Every month, refresher sessions and project-specific trainings are conducted. If a new product is added to the portfolio, promoters get updated product knowledge briefings. If a recurring issue is observed (say, inconsistent billing at some stores or a dip in conversion rate), the team will organize a focused coaching session or role-play to address it. OpenReach also runs compliance audits and performance reviews as learning opportunities – for example, a surprise market visit by a supervisor might reveal a promoter’s grooming isn’t up to standard, which then leads to one-on-one feedback and correction. By investing in their people’s skills and well-being, OpenReach ensures that the field force not only delivers excellence today but keeps improving for tomorrow. The result is a virtuous cycle: better-trained promoters achieve better results, which reinforces the value of training, and so on. For brand managers, this should be reassuring – it means when OpenReach says it will execute a campaign, the people representing your brand are knowledgeable, professional, and prepared for real-world challenges. They don’t just stock shelves; they create engaging shopping experiences and uphold the brand’s image in each interaction.

# Tech-Enabled Field Operations: OpenKYC and the Power of Real-Time Dashboards

https://preview.redd.it/g2ryg4169ibg1.jpg?width=840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=01e8de5f411028cc8892f1742d429e2d762c5ca1

Training and people are one side of the coin; technology and process are the other. OpenReach has heavily invested in proprietary technology to streamline field operations, reduce manual effort, and give all stakeholders greater visibility. A prime example is the tool called OpenKYC, a mobile application designed for sales officers to onboard retailers swiftly and paperlessly. Traditionally, enrolling a retailer into a scheme or database involved filling forms, collecting photocopies of documents, and waiting days (if not weeks) for verification. OpenReach tore up that playbook. With OpenKYC, a sales officer can complete a retailer’s KYC (Know Your Customer) process in just 30 seconds flat – entirely on a smartphone. All they need to do is capture the retailer’s documents (e.g. Aadhaar, PAN, bank details) using the phone camera, and the app’s back-end instantly verifies them against government databases (with one-time password authentication for Aadhaar). No paperwork, no couriering forms to HQ, no backlog – the moment the officer hits “submit”, the retailer is verified and onboarded. This incredible speed (40+ store KYCs in a single day per officer is now achievable) means that when a brand launches a new incentive program, the enabling infrastructure (retailer sign-ups) doesn’t become a bottleneck.

 

Beyond speed, OpenKYC brings accuracy and accountability. Every KYC record is geo-tagged with the store’s coordinates and includes a photo of the store and the owner’s photo with a digital signature, all captured through the app. This ensures the retailer is genuine and the data is audit-trail ready. For the sales officers on the ground, OpenKYC also serves as a personal productivity dashboard. As soon as they log in, they can see their assigned territory and a list of stores to onboard, and filter them by status (Pending, In Progress, Completed). A live counter shows how many KYCs they’ve completed and how many are left, effectively tracking their beat performance in real time. They can even view which of “their” retailers have started participating in schemes and earning incentives, giving them insight into which stores might need more attention or follow-up. By replacing clipboards and guesswork with a slick app and real-time data, OpenReach has empowered its field officers to be more efficient and proactive. From a brand manager’s perspective, this means faster market coverage (e.g., rolling out a scheme nationwide in days rather than months) and confidence that no target retailer is left uncontacted due to process delays.

 

Another crucial tech solution is OpenReach’s route optimization and beat management system. Covering more stores is only useful if it’s done effectively. OpenReach built an in-house software that generates an optimal Permanent Journey Plan (PJP) for each merchandiser or field rep, once the brand provides the list of outlets and priorities. You simply upload the store list, assign visit frequency or priority levels, and provide the merchandiser’s home base – the system then auto-calculates the most efficient daily route, minimizing travel time and maximizing stores visited. This means a merchandiser isn’t zig-zagging across town randomly; they follow a smart path that covers the “right stores at the right time”. The benefit is twofold: the field team’s productivity increases (more outlets serviced per day) and the consistency of store coverage improves. Every single day, the maximum number of shelves are checked and serviced. For brands, this addresses a perennial pain point – inconsistent market coverage. With OpenReach, if you’ve requested a 1,000-store merchandising program, you can be sure those 1,000 stores will actually be visited on the schedule intended, thanks to tech-driven planning.

 

Finally, all these field activities funnel into live digital dashboards accessible to brand managers and project teams. OpenReach provides clients with a secure web portal where they can see, in real time, what’s happening on the ground. A manager can log in and view how many retailers have been onboarded today, or how many store visits have been completed versus planned. They can drill down by territory to see, for example, that in North Zone, 95% of target outlets have active promotions running. Every sales officer’s performance is visible – how many retailers did officer A onboard, what is the sales uplift in officer B’s territory, etc. – along with each retailer’s engagement (sales, incentive earned). This real-time, granular visibility is revolutionary for brand teams accustomed to waiting weeks for summary reports. Instead of calling an agency for updates, the data is “at the click of a button” on a live dashboard. If something is off-track – say a particular city’s activation is lagging – the brand team can spot it immediately and coordinate a mid-campaign correction with OpenReach. The digital dashboard also doubles as a compliance and audit tool: all KYC documents, store photos, and payment records are stored and accessible for verification. This ensures that every piece of the program is transparent and traceable, protecting the brand from fraud and leakage. In short, OpenReach’s technology backbone ties together the dispersed field operations into a single, coherent system that delivers clarity and control to brand managers.

# Real-Time Insights and Execution Excellence: Data That Drives Decisions

Every morning, a brand manager can grab a cup of coffee and open the OpenReach dashboard to see a live pulse of their on-ground execution. This scenario was unthinkable a few years ago, but today it’s reality – real-time insights from the field are transforming how brands make decisions. OpenReach’s integrated solutions generate a wealth of data: not just sales figures, but also stock levels, share-of-shelf metrics, competitor insights, and qualitative feedback from promoters. Most importantly, this data is verified and comes with visual evidence. Brands no longer have to rely on anecdotal reports or delayed audit summaries; they can see what’s happening in each store, as it happens.

 

On the shelves of a typical Indian kirana store, products compete fiercely for visibility and stock space. OpenReach recognizes that “jo dikhta hai, woh bikta hai” – what is seen is what sells. One of OpenReach’s core focus areas is measuring and maximizing the brand’s Share of Shelf (SOS) in each outlet. To achieve this at scale, they employ image recognition technology that makes tracking SOS as simple as taking a photo. A merchandiser can snap a picture of a shelf through the app; in one click, the system analyzes the image and calculates how many facings the brand’s products have versus competitor products. Within seconds, the brand manager might see on the dashboard that in Store X, their brand has 8 facings out of 40 in the category (20% SOS) whereas a key competitor has 15 facings. But OpenReach doesn’t stop at just showing numbers – the insights are actionable. The system can flag stores where the share of shelf is below a desired threshold or where a specific SKU is missing from the shelf. It also measures other shelf metrics like number of bays and total shelves in the category, building a complete picture of presence vs. potential. These image-driven audits happen continually across thousands of stores, feeding a live SOS analytics report to the brand. For a category manager, this is gold: they can, for example, identify that in Mumbai their shelf share is high but in Tier-2 towns it’s lower, prompting targeted interventions like additional displays or promoter focus in those towns. By quantifying shelf presence with precision, OpenReach helps brands ensure that their visibility translates to sales – after all, if you’re not adequately visible on the shelf, you can’t expect to win the shopper’s rupee.

Another area where real-time data is making a decisive impact is out-of-stock (OOS) management. Out-of-stock means a product that should be on the shelf isn’t there when the customer wants to buy it. This is a silent killer of sales – globally, nearly $1 trillion in retail sales are lost every year due to OOS issues. In India, studies estimate FMCG companies lose up to 25% of potential sales from stock-outs. It’s often not a supply problem per se, but an execution gap: the store’s system might think stock is available, but due to shrinkage, pilferage, or errors, the shelf is actually empty. OpenReach tackles this with a Live Stock Alert feature that brings a proactive approach to stock management. Using its merchandising app, OpenReach sets a Minimum Base Quantity (MBQ) for every product SKU on a per-store basis – essentially a threshold that triggers a refill alert. For instance, if a shampoo’s MBQ is 10 units and the shelf/backroom count drops near that, the system automatically sends an SMS and email alert to the responsible Area Sales Manager and the sales officer before the product actually goes out of stock. This pre-emptive alert system is a game-changer: rather than waiting to discover an empty shelf on the next visit (by which time sales have been lost and perhaps a competitor has filled the gap), the team is prompted to take action immediately. The merchandiser can be rerouted to replenish, or the distributor can be informed to deliver stock, or if the product is truly unavailable, at least management knows to adjust forecasts. By linking ground-level inventory signals to real-time responses, OpenReach is helping brands plug leaks that previously would only be noticed in month-end reports. The benefit is not just immediate revenue protection but also long-term consumer loyalty – a customer who finds their favorite brand consistently in stock is far less likely to switch to a competitor out of frustration. 

Real-time insights aren’t limited to stock and shelf metrics. Promoter performance and consumer interaction data are also captured live. OpenReach’s promoter app logs every single consumer engagement, sale, and feedback snippet. For example, promoters can input how many samples they distributed and how many conversions to purchase happened, and even tag whether the customer was a first-time buyer or a repeat consumer. All of this streams to the client dashboard. One of OpenReach’s leaders explained it thus: the app provides live access to “sales figures, customer interaction data, feedback details, photos, first-time vs. repeat customer data, and even the GPS location of every team member – all in real time”. This means a brand manager running a sampling campaign can watch the cumulative sales figure tick upwards during the day and see, say, that 30% of buyers at a mall demo were repeat customers (indicating strong brand loyalty) or that a particular objection kept coming up via feedback forms. In the past, such information might come in a compiled spreadsheet weeks later, but now it’s available instantly. And because everything is time-stamped and geo-tagged (with photos as proof), the data is credible. No more inflated claims or doubts about “did that event really happen as reported?” – it’s verified data driving decision-making. If something isn’t working, mid-course corrections can be made. If something is working brilliantly (say one type of messaging or offer gets great response), it can be replicated in other locations the very next day.

 

Lastly, OpenReach extends insights to POSM (Point of Sale Materials) deployment, ensuring marketing collateral actually makes it to the outlets and is properly installed. Brands spend a lot on posters, danglers, standees, etc., but often face a black hole when trying to track these materials. OpenReach offers end-to-end POSM development and deployment tracking so the brand “always knows the exact status of promotional materials – from printing to installation”. Field teams use their app to confirm when a POSM item is delivered to a store and even upload a photo once it’s put up in the store. This closes the loop on BTL (below-the-line) marketing spend: a brand manager can open the dashboard and see, for example, that out of 500 shelf wobblers sent out for a campaign, 480 are confirmed in-place with photo evidence (and the remaining 20 stores can be followed up). Such transparency in execution was virtually unheard of – typically, a brand would send materials to distributors and hope they got to stores. Now, with OpenReach’s execution visibility, every standee and poster is accounted for, ensuring the brand’s message is consistently visible across markets.

# Conclusion: A Cohesive Ecosystem for Growth, Trust, and Excellence

OpenReach’s strategic value to FMCG brand managers lies in this cohesive ecosystem it has built – one that integrates people, process, and technology into a single force for market execution. By driving consumer demand through well-trained promoters, ensuring retailers are motivated and equipped to push products, creating employment and capable teams on the ground, and backing it all up with real-time data flows, OpenReach addresses FMCG challenges at every level. The scale it operates at (thousands of activations across hundreds of cities simultaneously) provides comfort that a brand’s reach won’t be limited by execution capacity. The transparency it offers (through digital dashboards and verified field data) means brand managers are never in the dark; they see what’s happening as clearly as if they were physically present in each market. And the executional excellence – stemming from rigorous training, process innovation, and tech adoption – ensures that strategies translate into results consistently, not just in a one-off lucky campaign.

Perhaps most importantly, OpenReach changes the nature of the relationship between a brand and its field partner. It’s no longer a transactional arrangement (“agency sends X people to do Y activity”). Instead, it’s a partnership built on shared goals and trust. OpenReach’s promise to take full ownership of targets and its investment in systems that give clients a “single source of truth” for all on-ground data have flipped the script. Brand managers can focus on strategy and innovation, knowing that execution – often the Achilles’ heel in FMCG – is in very capable hands. In an era where data drives decisions, OpenReach brings data from the last mile into the boardroom in real time. In an era where trust is the currency (be it trust of a retailer, a consumer, or a client), OpenReach builds trust through transparency and performance. And in a market as diverse and dynamic as India, OpenReach provides the agility and local insight (via its distributed yet unified team) that brands need to stay ahead.",1,1767607853.0,Openreachjournals,0,1.0,False

I have a friend who I’ve known for years but we only started getting closer at the beginning of 2025. Our friendship is mostly built on sending TikToks back and forth and talking about being queer, which creates a real emotional connection for me because I can’t talk about these things with many other people.

The issue is that whenever we talk about hanging out, she almost automatically assumes it’ll be at my house. In all the years we’ve known each other, she has never once invited me to her place or offered an alternative. I assumed for a long time that maybe she was insecure or uncomfortable about her living situation or family, which I genuinely didn’t mind, so I kept inviting her over and never called her out because I didn’t want to embarrass her.

What hurts is that there’s been almost no effort from her side in other ways either, not even something small like inviting me out for coffee or showing any kind of initiative. I don’t expect gifts or money or food. I’d be completely happy just hanging out and talking. It’s the lack of effort that bothers me.

There have also been moments that made me question how much she values me. One time she told me she couldn’t hang out because she was going out with her mom, then posted with another friend an hour later. Another time, she invited me to an event, I got ready and showed up, listened to her vent for an hour and then she asked me to leave because she wanted to be with someone else. I never called her out for any of this.

The final straw was when she came over to my house and I told her respectfully that I didn’t really have snacks. She clearly expected me to order food for her and I did cause, even though I didn’t want to, I didn’t want to seem rude.

I’m not claiming to be a perfect friend and I don’t expect her to be one either but the ongoing lack of effort and consideration has made me realize that she may not fully respect me as a person. Even though I genuinely enjoy the time we spend together.",1,1767607756.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False
1q4hviy,https://www.reddit.com/r/MexicoTravel/comments/1q4hviy/mexico_city_travel_guide_things_to_do_food_travel/,"Mexico City Travel Guide - Things to do, Food & Travel Tips","Mexico City is big, busy, and full of contrasts — in the best possible way. Ancient ruins sit next to colonial buildings, world-class museums are everywhere, and some of the best food you’ll ever eat comes from both high-end restaurants and street-side taco stands. It’s one of those cities that feels intense at first, then incredibly rewarding once you settle into it.

What really makes Mexico City special is the **variety**. In a single day you can explore historic areas like Centro Histórico, wander leafy neighbourhoods such as Roma and Condesa, and end the night eating exceptionally well without needing to plan much. Museums, parks, markets, and galleries are spread throughout the city, so culture blends naturally into everyday life rather than feeling like a checklist.

The food alone is a reason to visit. Mexico City is widely considered one of the world’s great food destinations, and that reputation is well deserved. Whether it’s street tacos, bakeries, casual neighbourhood spots, or more refined meals, the quality and depth of the food scene consistently surprised us.

Despite its size, the city is also **more accessible than you might expect**. Many neighbourhoods are walkable, Uber is easy to use, and organised tours make it simple to visit major sights or take day trips like Teotihuacán. If you like cities that reward curiosity, good eating, and exploring at your own pace, Mexico City is hard to beat.

# Best Things to Do in Mexico City

https://preview.redd.it/70ix7bcm8ibg1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b162b758f9fc1a51e37db81edfa94e9a38aefb06

**Explore Centro Histórico (Cathedral & Templo Mayor)**

Centro Histórico is the best place to start in Mexico City.  
It packs centuries of history into a relatively small, walkable area around the Zócalo and gives a clear sense of how the city grew from its Aztec roots into a colonial capital and modern megacity.

The **Metropolitan Cathedral** dominates the main square and is **free to enter**, making it an easy stop even if you’re short on time. Inside it’s surprisingly calm compared to the chaos outside, and worth a quick visit just to take in the scale.

Right next door is the **Templo Mayor**, the remains of the main temple of the Aztec city of Tenochtitlán. Entry is **$100 MXP**, and it’s one of the best examples of Mexico City’s layered history — ancient ruins sitting directly beneath modern buildings, with the cathedral looming in the background.

Centro Histórico is busy and intense, but it’s an essential stop and one of the quickest ways to understand Mexico City’s past before branching out to other neighbourhoods.

https://preview.redd.it/b9841okn8ibg1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fa42699232f994ec83b2b947b5481df777e7806

# Visit Chapultepec Park & Chapultepec Castle

Chapultepec Park is a great break from the city.  
It’s one of the largest urban parks in the world and completely **free to enter**, with plenty of shaded paths and open space if you need a pause from the busier parts of Mexico City.

The standout attraction is **Chapultepec Castle**, which sits on a hill overlooking the park. It’s the **only royal castle in the Americas**, and for about **$100 MXP** you get both a solid history lesson and some of the best views in the city. Even if museums aren’t usually your thing, this one is worth it for the setting alone.

Inside, the castle is well preserved, with grand rooms and murals that cover Mexico’s imperial and presidential past. Going earlier in the day helps avoid queues and gives you time to enjoy the grounds before it fills up.

Chapultepec is also easy to combine with nearby spots like the Museum of Anthropology, making this area one of the most efficient and rewarding parts of the city to explore.

# National Museum of Anthropology (Guided Visit Recommended)

The National Museum of Anthropology is a must in Mexico City.  
It’s one of the most important museums in the country and easily one of the most impressive we visited. Even before going inside, the scale and architecture stand out, especially the massive central courtyard with the iconic concrete umbrella fountain.

Inside, the museum covers Mexico’s pre-Hispanic civilisations in serious depth, with entire sections dedicated to the Aztecs, Maya, and other cultures. Highlights like the Aztec Sun Stone are incredible, but the museum is huge and can feel overwhelming if you don’t know what you’re looking at.

We did a **guided tour**, and it made a big difference — especially as **English speakers**. A lot of the detailed information is in Spanish with limited English, so having a guide helped bring the exhibits to life rather than just walking past impressive objects. Our guide, Leonardo, was excellent and added context and stories we’d have completely missed otherwise.

If you’re interested in Mexico’s history at all, the museum is worth your time — and if you want to actually understand what you’re seeing, an **English-speaking guided tour** is well worth it.

# Visit the Frida Kahlo Museum & Explore Coyoacán

**The Frida Kahlo Museum (Casa Azul) is worth planning ahead for.**  
It’s one of the most popular cultural stops in Mexico City, and for good reason. Visiting her childhood home gives a very personal look into her life, work, and relationship with Diego Rivera. Entry is timed and limited, and **tickets often sell out days in advance**, so this is one place you’ll want to **book ahead** if it’s on your list.

It’s well worth pairing the museum with time in **Coyoacán**, which feels completely different from central Mexico City. The area is quieter, greener, and more village-like, with colourful streets and relaxed plazas. The **Coyoacán Market** is a great stop for casual food or snacks and makes for an easy lunch after the museum.

Together, Casa Azul and Coyoacán make for a really balanced half-day — art, history, and neighbourhood life all in one.

# Experience Lucha Libre (An Unforgettable Night in Mexico City)

Seeing Lucha Libre live was one of our favourite nights in Mexico City.  
It’s easily one of the most entertaining and uniquely Mexican experiences you can have, and doing it as part of an organised evening made everything smoother.

We booked a **guided Lucha Libre night**, which kicked off with a **tequila tasting** and food at a local taco spot with the rest of the group. It was a great way to ease into the night, meet people, and get hyped before heading to the arena.

The match itself was unreal. The **energy inside the arena is wild** — locals are fully invested, shouting, cheering, and reacting to every dramatic move. Even if you don’t understand the rules, it doesn’t matter. The masks, characters, and over-the-top action make it impossible not to get swept up in it. It’s loud, chaotic, and ridiculously fun.

What really made the night work was how well it was organised. Not having to worry about tickets, transport, or where to eat meant we could just enjoy it. If you want a night out that shows a completely different side of Mexico City beyond museums and sightseeing, Lucha Libre is a must.

👉 [**If you want to do the same Lucha Libre night we did — tequila, tacos, and live wrestling — this is the tour we booked.**](https://www.getyourguide.com/mexico-city-l194/mexico-city-mexican-evening-lucha-libre-and-tequila-t1091374/?partner_id=K1S6T5K&utm_medium=online_publisher)

It was easily a highlight of our trip.

https://preview.redd.it/7or1maks8ibg1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1ecea5259895235307ef2977062ac71061776f5

# Take a Full-Day Trip to Teotihuacán & Surrounding Sites

A day trip to Teotihuacán is absolutely worth it from Mexico City.  
It’s one of the most rewarding excursions you can do, and going with an organised tour makes the day far smoother — especially when multiple major sites are included.

We did a **guided full-day tour** that combined **Teotihuacán**, **Tlatelolco**, and the **Basilica of Guadalupe**, which gave much more context than just visiting the pyramids alone. At Teotihuacán, walking the Avenue of the Dead and seeing the Pyramid of the Sun and Moon is impressive on its own, but having a guide explain how the city once functioned made a big difference.

The extra stops helped round out the day. Tlatelolco highlights Mexico’s layered history, while the Basilica of Guadalupe is fascinating even if you’re not religious. Having transport and timing handled was a huge plus given the distances involved.

If you want to see Teotihuacán properly without dealing with logistics, this kind of full-day tour is a very efficient use of time.

👉 [**This is the tour we took if you want to check availability.**](https://www.getyourguide.com/mexico-city-l194/mexico-city-teotihuacan-tlatelolco-basilica-of-guadalupe-t958459/?partner_id=K1S6T5K&utm_medium=online_publisher)

One thing we **regretted not doing** was the **hot air balloon over Teotihuacán**. The site is incredible from the ground, but seeing the pyramids at sunrise from the air looks unreal — and it’s something we’ll definitely do next time we’re in Mexico City.  
👉 [**If you’re into once-in-a-lifetime experiences, the hot air balloon tour is worth a look.**](https://www.getyourguide.com/mexico-city-l194/cdmx-teotihuacan-balloon-flight-with-optional-pyramids-tour-t696822/?partner_id=K1S6T5K&utm_medium=online_publisher)

# Where to Eat in Mexico City (Restaurants, Tacos & Bakeries)

https://preview.redd.it/d1pdibst8ibg1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b87a8913360f0f1132479e18988641cdfde57d0

* Contramar
* Entremar
* Mi Compa Chava
* Masala y Maíz
* Botánico
* Máximo Bistrot
* Café Madre
* El Beneficio Bistrot
* Órbita

This list barely scratches the surface, but it’s a solid starting point if you want to eat well across brunch, lunch, and dinner. Mexico City has an unreal food scene, and it’s one of those places where even casual meals can end up being highlights of the trip.

https://preview.redd.it/hmulvytu8ibg1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e437f21a73316eee81dec49da901da373234035

* Arrachera Tacos El Tigre
* El Vilsito
* Los Cocuyos
* El Compita | Birria de Res
* Taquería El Turix

# Best Bakeries & Pastry Shops in Mexico City

**Some bakeries we’d recommend in Mexico City:**

* Casa 1900
* Green Rhino
* Panadería Rosetta
* Pastelería Ideal
* Odette

If you like starting the day with good coffee and pastries, Mexico City won’t disappoint — and it’s easy to fit bakery stops in between sightseeing.

# Best Neighbourhoods to Stay in Mexico City

Where you stay in Mexico City really shapes your experience. Neighbourhoods feel very different in terms of walkability, food options, and overall vibe, so it’s worth choosing carefully.

We stayed along **Paseo de la Reforma**, which worked well as a **central base**. It was easy to get to **Centro Histórico** and across to **Roma** and **Condesa**, and transport links were solid. That said, if we were booking again, we’d stay **directly in Roma or Condesa** — both felt more walkable, had better food right outside the door, and just a nicer day-to-day atmosphere.

Reforma is still a practical choice if you want convenience, but Roma and Condesa are hard to beat if cafés, restaurants, and neighbourhood life are a priority.

**Where we stayed:**  
We stayed at **Barceló México Reforma**. It was **nice enough, comfortable, and well located** for sightseeing. Having a **spa and indoor pool** was a bonus after long days walking the city, and it worked well as a no-fuss base.

If you’re looking for a central hotel on Reforma with good amenities, it’s a solid option.  
👉 [**This is the hotel we stayed at if you want to check availability.**](https://expedia.com/affiliate/eYHV6G0)

# Mexico City Travel Tips

Mexico City is huge, but it’s easier to navigate than it looks. Our biggest tip: **use Uber**. It’s widely available, affordable, and removes any hassle around taxis or language barriers. For getting between neighbourhoods like **Roma, Condesa, Centro, and Reforma**, it was by far the easiest option.

Traffic can be heavy, especially during rush hour, so build in extra time if you have reservations or timed entries. Outside peak hours, moving around is straightforward. Walking also works well in Roma and Condesa, which are flat, lively, and easy to explore on foot.

Finally, pace yourself. Mexico City has a lot going on, and trying to do too much in one day can be exhausting. Slower mornings, long meals, and neighbourhood wandering make the experience far more enjoyable.

# Final Thoughts

Mexico City is a place that really rewards curiosity. It’s big, busy, and a bit overwhelming at first, but that’s part of what makes it so memorable. From places like Centro Histórico, Chapultepec Castle, and Teotihuacán to neighbourhoods such as Roma, Condesa, and Coyoacán, there’s an incredible mix of history, culture, and everyday life.

The food alone is a huge highlight. From street tacos and bakeries to brunch spots and standout restaurants, eating well becomes part of the daily routine rather than something you have to plan around. Even compared to other food-heavy destinations, Mexico City really stood out for us.

What also surprised us was how **easy the city is to experience with a bit of planning**. Uber works well, many neighbourhoods are walkable, and organised tours made it simple to visit places like Teotihuacán, museums, and Lucha Libre without worrying about logistics. If you’re willing to slow down, eat well, and mix sightseeing with neighbourhood time, Mexico City offers some of the most rewarding travel experiences we’ve had - and it’s somewhere we’d happily return to.

**Cat's Door**

They always say, ""Never fall in love with an artist…"" What the heck are you supposed to do when you’re both some kind of artist? He was a painter, and I was working in Real Estate during business hours. In my downtime, I worked on video game level design. Regrettably, someone needed to be grounded and work in the less fantastical world of a corporate office. It would not be James. 

 It would never be James… 

His art, his infinite inspiration, couldn’t flourish in the construct of Capitalism. So, I kept my job selling homes. Real Estate isn’t the cash cow everyone thinks it is.  But not everyone got to work in the glass offices overlooking the beaches, where your after-hours offered you the lustering California sunsets. My office isn’t just overlooking the beaches. It has a lovely, wide window overlooking the jagged cliffs and crashing waves. It’s when the lighthouse flickers on; that’s when I get to watch the fog roll in from the Southern Pacific Ocean and begin the evenings.  

There’s a way that the intense radiance from the lighthouse carves out shadows that dance in the fog. I always thought the shadows of the waves were the real storytellers of the sea. The crashing of the waves silhouetted by the unyielding beam of the Lighthouse made for ferocious fantasies.  It created Ninki Nanka, brought Nessie’s memories to life, and summoned Sassie from San Fran. The fog retold tales of Sirens riding on the ever-encompassing back of Jormungandr.  It was a thrilling sight, and I loved it. My humble view, along with the overtime pay, helped.   

The job came with a modest three-bedroom townhouse roughly two miles from the office. A mortgage-free home in California is a steal. A rather prominent perk for a small Real Estate company. Three bedrooms, two baths with a huge backyard, and a just as large front porch.  Across the road was a rocky border just before what had been the shoreline…  Now, while beautiful, it’s a jagged drop-off. Before, there were plans for a new development 15 miles from the cliff’s shoreline.  A neighborhood was going to have its own island, a mini Catalina, as a getaway. That was the intention, anyway. 

  The National Guard was called out to assist with search-and-rescue operations at the construction site. I remember seeing on the local news dozens of helicopters flying out to the site and several boats rescuing people from the water. I remember having to turn the television down because of the screaming. The screams weren’t coming from where I thought they were.   I don’t think I was the only one, either.  The screams weren’t coming from the construction crew that was thrown into the ocean by the initial explosion and eruption; they were coming from the sinkhole. They didn’t realize that the hydraulics stabilizers pierced underwater cave systems carved out by a series of hydrothermal vents.    The sinkholes erupted on the ocean surface, blasting steam and frothing the surrounding seawater.  A portion of the cave collapsed, and the ocean flooded parts of the caves, forming sinkholes at the surface. 

   It sounded like hundreds, if not thousands, of cries for mercy.  It was a cacophony of petitions.  Later, local oceanographers explained it was the sound of the water echoing through the caverns as it was being filled.  This was the best they could assume.  The force of the water being sucked downwards was too powerful for any diver to explore. And for good reason, the drones that were sent into the hole didn’t make it back to the surface. They suspected a human would not survive it.   The intense heat from the thermal vents destroyed most of the sensors. There’s a bottom, from what they could see before the steam disintegrated the drone. That was some evidence that it was just water rushing in. 

   

On the fourth day, one more sinkhole appeared parallel to the shoreline.  Before anyone could suggest preventative measures, the cliffside started its untimely event.  No one realized that the cave system didn’t stop at the shoreline. One would imagine that experts should have thought of the idea… maybe they did, and they didn’t listen? Who knows?   Multimillion-dollar homes fell, schools fell, the roads fell, and the people fell.  The cataclysm could be heard at least three cities over in any direction. On the fifth day,  silence finally fell, and we were thankful. The sinkholes devouring the landscape shaved off two miles of the landmass.  



After six years of research and mourning, the area was ready to move on again. My company, Atwood llc,  was one of the first to redevelop the area. It’s a lovely area. It’s just dreadfully quiet outside of the waves crashing below. Save for a few vehicles here and there. Some people have reservations about living here. James certainly did. If a precaution could have been taken, they took it. James still hated the idea. He said something about the vibe blocking his creativity.  At one point, he suggested going to a studio several miles away to work.  I told him that was an incredibly ridiculous idea, and he was creating an unnecessary expense, an expense I would have to pay for. I love James; I do. But his art isn’t what keeps the lights on, or the cats fucking fed. Despite being a stay-at-home cat-dad, he doesn’t feed them. All three little adorable furballs rush me as soon as they hear me coming in the door. Loud little mews of distress, as if they hadn’t eaten for days.   Which is sometimes the case if I leave on a company trip and leave them with James. When I’m absent, my sister or my bestie comes by and makes sure that the three creatures are fed; if the fourth creature complains, they remind him he has thumbs. He gets so focused… so focused that he sometimes doesn’t close the porch’s screen door. 

For a time, I really believed he was just absent-minded; now… now it feels vindictive. Just to make me angry.  Because I think that it’s fucking insane for him to want to go to a studio when we made the third bedroom his damn studio.   This house is mortgage-free; this place, not including the upgrades, could easily fetch a sickening 2.5 million dollars, even with the area the subject of superstition.    I only sold three homes last quarter.  He sold two pieces of art for a total of $500.00.   His car payment is $1200.00. Each of his projects ranges from $2,000 to $5,000 to launch… who pays for that? I do. Do I love my husband? I do. I merely ask that he feed the cats and make sure the fur babies do not get out… Each feline is an emotional support animal; their safety is imperative to me. Mito, Gorry, and Arcadia. A siamese, an orange tabby, and a Bombay, respectively.    Once again, I came home to starving cats, but I was only ambushed by the two.   It was Arcadia that was missing.  From the front entrance, I could see the reflection of the back porch door through a mirror and a bay window.   I screamed for James, as per usual, he padded out in his painter’s apron, and he started the usual fucking apology until he saw the look on my face.

He’s been blowing up my phone for the last two hours. I messaged all the neighbors, warning them about Arcadia. It was still daylight out, thankfully. It was only 4:30 pm, and the sunset was around 7 pm. I didn’t want to go home. It was still early, but I was fending off a panic attack.  If I were to go home right now, seeing James would… I don’t want to think about it. The safest place for me was going to be in my office. The office manager announced that ownership was delighted to grant us a paid half-day off for the holiday weekend. Everyone bugged out of the office as if it were the last day of school. The office would be empty, and I could decompress and sob if I needed it. 

The parking lot was empty. Great.  No one’s there. I bolted for the door, unlocked it, and started my regular trot to the surveillance alarm. But it wasn’t doing its usual chirping countdown.   

“Did Mara forget to set the alarm?” I muttered before walking back to my office and dropping into my chair.  Regardless, I was there alone, and I was glad for it. I could finally let go of the ragged breath I had been holding on to. 

“You know, the purpose of letting you go early for the day doesn’t mean you have to come back.” The phrase came with echoing footsteps towards the door, then stopped.  “Oh dear, what has happened?”

Fuck. Did I really not see his car outside? Or the entourage of vehicles that come with him.  It was the Ownership, or rather… just the Owner, without his council of investors. Benson E. Atwood. Developer and real estate mogul.  He was at least 50, with salt-and-pepper hair, clean-shaven, and fit.  A smile that can sweep anyone off their feet and make you forget that owners can be absolute dicks. 

Before I could think about it, I was already standing, offering an apology, and astutely dried and sucked away the tears.  “Mr. Atwood, I didn’t realize you, or anyone, was still here. I didn’t mean to disturb the assets. I just needed somewhere- I… lost my cat.” It was the truth. It was a stupid truth, and I felt completely ignorant for spilling it. “I-”

He raised his hand. “Follow me.” He stepped out of the doorway and began walking toward the staircase that wound right overhead of my shared office space.   Mr. Atwood glanced over his shoulder to make sure that I was still in tow. “Have a seat, Eira.” He pointed to the seating area facing the ocean. It was a plush Midnight Velvet Victorian chaise. I found the office's interior design modern and minimalist.  But Mr. Atwood’s office held a strange conjecture of glass and steel, along with scattered pieces of the antique or period statement piece.  This was one such piece.  It was extremely comfortable; I nearly sank into the chaise's cushions. 

I didn’t hear Mr. Atwood close the door, but I did hear and see him pour from the decanter on his desk.  I watched him from the reflection in the window.   I don’t know if he felt me staring, but he met my gaze in the window as well. “Tell me about your cat.”  He circled back to me with two drinks in hand, handing one to me as he sat in another ornate chair, catercorner to the window and the chaise...  “Hope you don’t mind scotch.”

“Thank you, Mr.Atwood-I,”

“Benson. Also, it’s okay to breathe. I don’t think you’ve taken a decent breath since I startled you. Now go on.”  He interjected.

“Alright. Benson. Thank you.” I exhaled less shakily. Of course, I’ve been breathing the whole time, but I was holding on to something. Whatever that internal thing was, it rattled my lungs.  I replaced that feeling with a slight burn from the scotch.   “My cat… Her name is Arcadia. She’s a Bombay.  Basically, an all-black cat even her nose and toe beans.  She’s one of three of my emotional support animals. “  I chose my words carefully. “My husband somehow forgot that he left the back door open.”

“Dreadful.” He simply said before taking a sip and handing me his phone.   “Send me a photo of your precious little one and-.”  He took the phone back and sighed.  “My apologies. Nasty habit, I thrust this thing in the face of my assistant more than I actually use it.”  He chuckled, unlocking his phone. He airdropped his contact information to my phone. “Send me a photo. I’ll have Jared alert the shelters and catchers. Is she chipped?” 

I nodded.

“Fantastic,” he chuckled. “Leave it with me, certainly we don’t have to worry too much. The area isn’t bustling with traffic or coyotes. You moved in most, if not all, of the residents here. You know them well enough to know that they’ll return her. So.. why did you come here to the office, of all places?”

“Arcadia is extremely curious, and I’m afraid she’s going to fall. But this wouldn’t be happening if I had just gotten James the art studio further into town.” I took a sip and exhaled more cleanly.  “We argued about this happening once before. If I were to go home right now… I don’t know what  I would do…”

“Say no more,” Benson stood, heading back to the desk, grabbing the decanter, and returned. “We have a few hours before the light show begins, and frankly, we both can use the company.” My boss filled my glass to the brim before he topped off his own. 

“The light show?” The question slipped out before I thanked him for the refill. 

Benson nodded towards the lighthouse. “The fog rolling in with the light makes for a spectacular show.”

“I didn’t think anyone else enjoyed the roll-in? Everyone else is too creeped out by the shadows bouncing off the fog.  It’s like watching an old-timey puppet show… just with nature and a lighthouse.”

“Stars, you are in good company. There’s a sense of serenity here beyond...” Benson paused, then continued to sip his scotch.  He did not finish his statement, but simply meant… Beyond.

 

I was honestly lost, and he had no intention of finishing the phrase.  It was weird, then I took another sip, and it made sense —simply an absence of identifiable words to describe the indescribable sensation of wonder and peace that a mere fragment of nature can offer, without point or purpose. Beyond. “It is brilliant, isn’t it?” I hummed.

Mr. Atwood and I spent all afternoon day-drinking in his office until he mentioned he was getting peckish. I ordered pizza and sushi from the Crossing Arms for us since he kept supplying the scotch. He begged me not to, but I insisted. We talked about the oddities in his office, the clash of items. He explained that he’d love to travel, and he was a collector of sorts. He eventually revealed that he was an anthropologist before getting into development. The only reason he got into the industry was so that he could inherit his father’s fortune. I was stunned that he said something that candid to an employee, not even an associate.  He snickered, lamenting that he actually hates being in real estate, but sees the benefits and capital gain.  Those capital gains help fund his research excursions. 

Benson stood with a comical hop, then shot a wink my way before nearly skipping over to the shelf above his desk.  Apparently, he didn’t get to talk about his passion outside of money.  Stealing from dead civilizations and writing about them and keeping at least one item before donating the rest to an institution of some sort was… I wasn’t here to judge; I was here to escape James and spicy sadness over Arcadia being lost.   Much to my constant surprise, he was providing quite an escape: we were drinking Scotch that cost more than I could make in a year; we were eating pizza and sushi; and we were waiting for the sun to set over the ocean from a fantastic view. It’s a nice moment aside from my nightmare.   

He placed a 6-inch cat statue on the table. I gave a drunken pout.  Any kitty talk would have that response before resuming.  It was Bast, or I thought as much…   There was something wrong with the interpretation.  This Bast had three catheads, one forward and the others flanking.  The catheads on the sides were upside down, and in one of its hands wasn’t quite ankh, but a perversion of such.   The shape was off, and the symbols didn’t look familiar. From the corners of the icon, I honestly couldn’t make it out —maybe hands or fish tails? Benson watched the myriad of expressions until I was utterly dumbfounded. 

“Care to guess?”  Benson mused as he rounded the chaise, leaning over my shoulder.   

“I... It’s an…” Nothing I could say would be correct.  “ It’s another interpretation of Bast?”

“You’re not wrong.   An old family friend found this interpretation in Sudan, Meroe—the Kush Kingdom. The former inhabitants had their own pantheon, alongside other Kemetic Gods.  It was found in a temple dedicated to Bast.  Only a few homes had this with the Bast that we typically see for the period. But this one was uniquely…” He paused, looking for words —or, instead, selecting them. “It was hard to acquire, leave it at that.  Not the point, turn it around.  It’s substantial, no part of it’s hollow. Look, it’s happening.”  He tapped me on the opposite shoulder before circling back to the window. It was a terrible way to change the subject. It worked. This time, he sat next to me on the chaise. Right on time, he refilled our tumblers; I set the idol back on the table. A chill ran down my spine as I stared in wonder… oddly not about the object but about James.

What would it take for him to just listen to me? Why was he so ungrateful?  What could make them thankful for what I do?  Would anything? Nothing can make him see what I see.  I just wish he could know the fear I felt when the cats went missing at the very least. But that would be too much to ask for. 

“A toast to a brilliant evening, and many more like them to come, of course, without the precariousness of James. And to the return of Arcadia.”  He raised his glass for me to meet, snapping me out of my daze.  

“To that and more.  And thank you for being such a gracious host.  You really didn’t have to.” It was true: I was more than appreciative of the booze, the conversation, and the peek at the human behind the wall of ownership. 

“Of course, I did.  Tenebrae No Ligare.” He gave an exuberant cheer.  Then silence fell.

The Sun fell.  It sank into a boundless and wet wasteland.  It fell into the eternal rest until it clawed its way back to the surface to forget its nightmare of the deep. Now, it would just slip into blissful sleep.  I didn’t realize we never had the lights on when we entered the office until night truly fell.  With the floor-to-ceiling window, there wasn’t a need, but from this angle, it looked as if we were hovering above the ocean.  We were in a room sculpted into the night sky, peering down and outwards into a bubble, watching the darkness fall upon the world.  We were in that tenebrosity, swimming with excitement.  The lighthouse light had yet to come on; the light from the surrounding buildings and streets could not reach the Beyond, as Benson had put it. The stars had not yet broken through the night. However, we could still see the waves breaking and swaying formlessly. I would have expected to smell salt if the window were open.

I heard a heavy sigh as the main event rolled in. I didn’t know the science behind the mist and the fog building over the ocean.  Benson likely did, but at this moment, I didn’t dare to ask or to speak outside of the occasional ‘ooh’ or’ aha’ spotting a fish surfacing in the night. A thick blanket spread quickly. The wind rolled out the fog. With an inaudible pop, the unrelenting bright light of the lighthouse began its discovery of the surface of the ocean. The silhouette of the leaping, lapping wave created the show we had been waiting for.   I suppose, in Benson’s delight, he started humming. It was a lower tone than what I could have given him credit for, but beautiful nonetheless… something else to be surprised about. 

I don’t really know how long we sat in the darkness of his office without a word between us as we gazed out into the Beyond.  It wasn’t until he pointed that the stars were finally emerging.   He pointed out a few constellations, then I noticed the humming never stopped, and I realized it wasn't coming from him. In the pitch dark, I looked down as his gaze was still outward.   The hum, the low vibration, came from the effigy, not my boss. He was going on something about fruit from the stars, something- fanciful.  

“It's making sounds.”  I stammered drunkenly.  “It’s…  you weren’t humming?”

I couldn’t see him at first, even in the darkness; I should have seen his outline. He was sitting next to me, just a moment ago; now I can’t feel his weight on the chaise. Was I alone? He was just speaking to me. 

“Watch your eyes.” He whispered huskily in my ear. Instinctively, I recoiled back and circled a loose coil behind my ear. Without missing a beat, the room slowly lit, and the idol stopped humming.   Benson was standing near the entrance of his office, gently sliding up the dimmer of the opposite side of the room. The grin relaxed into a reminiscent of an afterglow, a satisfaction of a wanton desire being fulfilled.  “Remind me to tell you about that expedition.  These little items are full of wonders and many more like it.”

   “Do you need a cigarette?” It came out faster than I cared. 

“What, why?” He chuckled.

“You look like you need a smoke,” I laughed. “But also, I’ll keep you to that. The melody, though,” I returned my gaze to the mutated Bast. “It’s catchy and haunting. This is haunted, isn’t it?” I pouted, “I bet you have a gramophone.”

That snapped him out of his euphoria into a fit of hearty laughs.  “That’s a lot to unpack.”

 That’s a LOT? Not this.” I pointed to the idol.

 A sharp snort came from him, then he cackled even more. “ Point made. Point made.   One, yes, I need to smoke.  Two, it’s not haunted.  And yes, I have a gramophone at home… why?”

“Your entire home… is filled with demons.”  I muttered, standing, “Speaking of… I should get home. However, you’ve given me an amazing time.  And you better give me that story.”  I chuckled. 

“We’re not in any shape to drive. I’ll have the boys pick us up.  Grab the coffee cups for me and fill them for the road.  Given the circumstances, I believe the S2  would be fitting.”

“There’s…”   I stopped myself. I’m drunk, and I wanted to be as petty as possible, and my boss was willing to instigate… When was this honestly going to happen again?  Not that I didn’t believe him… minds change once the libations leave.  So why not take his generous and petty offer?  “Do it.”

He wasn’t kidding.  Benson had a driver pick up our drunken selves from the office in a 1960s Bentley S2. The back doors were suicide doors.  The color was a metallic crimson-and-black gradient.  It didn’t matter which angle you stood; it shimmered and glistened in the light. The trim was rose gold, the same as the interior.  The interior, however, might have been made of actual gold, contrasting with the matte-black finish.  

During the entire drive, I felt the unease travel back into my chest, and the rage creep back into my heart. I could feel my nails digging into my purse. The driver hit a small bump in the road, causing me to scratch my it.  

“Don’t worry, we’ll find Arcadia and get you a scratch-free bag.” Benson remained extremely sympathetic and generous.  

Part of me wondered… why.

Before I could thank him again, the driver slowed the car and indicated that we had arrived.  I saw it clear as day.  The fucking front door was wide open. The porch light was off. The foyer light was blighting again, another thing he neglected.

“That son of a bitch!”  I seethed before bolting out of the car.  I nearly tripped on the curb. I stumbled forward drunkenly but soon regained my balance and started running again towards the door. Full of drunken rage, I wanted to do nothing but tackle James and slap the shit out of him. 

Benson was calling for me to either wait or slow down, neither of which I planned to do.

“James, you rotten bastard!” I echo beneath the broken foyer light.  My seething rage was replaced with a cold, wet sensation; I froze in my tracks.

The house was, at least, from what I could see, not only ransacked, but broken furniture and canvas on the floor, and what I hoped was paint covered the walls, but there were cats… cats I didn’t own. There had to be at least 15 in the living room. All different shapes and sizes.  Collared and not. I stood completely still as the creatures were completely unbothered. They were cats, after all. That wasn’t what gave me reason to pause. 

The marble white floor was stained with blood and ire. Meat… I don’t want to know a chunk of something littering the floor. It reeked of copper, wet fur, and vomit. Nausea was curling in the back of my throat, and I nearly expelled all of my stomach’s contents.   I needed to hold my shit together before I went spiraling.  The prevailing thought, besides vomiting, was to stay quiet and run.  There was a trail of blood leading from the living room into the hallway.   Fuck investigating that. Absolutely, the hell not. Nope. I could see the back door reflected in the mirror. It was in pieces, and the metal screening was warped, bent inward, and twisted by the hinges.  What the shit was in the house?  

Before I could speculate, I heard the humming. It was coming from the hallway.  It was the effigy that was left behind at the office. No.  This sounded very real. This sounded like a very near voice, playing an ethereal tune upon its lips.  The voice was like a thunderous sea whisper. It was yet kind but cruel.  The distance humming painted the ocean breeze and summoned a whirling heat to match a summer day.  It was a delightful dream of riches and demons from the deep and that sweet Beyond. I was on the verge of singing along with the hidden voice when the screaming broke my trance of felines from outside.

 I didn’t want to know what they were all lapping up or even gnawing on. Finally, with enough wits about me to turn around, I slammed into Benson’s chest.  He grabbed my arm, pulling me out of the house and closing the door behind us.  

 “Cats are in the car! Just get in!” he was dragging me across the yard with little resistance.  Benson nearly threw me in the car, and he followed. 

There were three… three screaming cats in the front seat, clawing to get into the back with us.  They didn’t stop crying until the driver lowered the window separating the front and the back.  The driver sped off as Mito, Gorry, and the missing, but now found, Arcadia, who had crawled into my lap. 

“What the fuck was that?!”  I shouted, trembling, “What I - I need to call the cops, There w-”

“We need to get you back to the manor. We’ll call the authorities after.” Benson interjected 

“After?” I echoed.

“After I explained the effigy and our new plight.”

I can dial in medium roasts in the sense that they are in the middle point between bitter and sour but for the taste, sometimes it's ok while other times the taste is a bit absent. 

Latest shot: 

* [Beans](https://dropshot.coffee/en/products/ethiopia-guji-shakiso-250g) (roast date 12 days ago, opened today) 
* Recipe: 17g in, 31g out 
* Time: not really sure because but I think \~25s including the 5s pre infusion 
* Puck prep: I use WDT, firm tamp, uniform look after the shot and seems like there's no channelling or other issues 
* Default portafilter (I think 54mm) single wall basket, since it's not bottomless I have to stop it \~4-5g early 
* Other mentions: I warm up the machine with the double wall basket (I've read that somewhere a long time ago but not sure if it's a good practice, it seems to increase the temperature more if you do that)  

I tastes.. good, I guess. It's not bad but it's also not as balanced and the taste that well defined as it would be from a specialty coffee place (note here is that I am comparing in terms of how it tastes in a flat white form). I've also noticed that if I go to 1:2 or above 1:2 the shot is always bitter. 

So, does this look good? Is there any parameter I can change or different experiments I can try? Could there be something slightly off with the grinder or Bambino since I have to use this weird recipe instead of the standard 1:2 with default machine temperature?

Quick guide — what to decide first 

* Primary goal: footfall, online sales, bookings, or brand awareness. 
* Budget & timeline: set a 3‑month test window and a small creative budget for one strong video. 
* Scope: strategy only, strategy + execution, or full-service agency. 
* Decision point: do you want hands-on control or a done‑for‑you package? 

 

Why a Belfast consultant actually helps 

Belfast isn’t just a pin on a map — it’s a patchwork of neighborhoods with different tastes. Local consultants know which tone lands in the Cathedral Quarter and what will flop in other areas, and many [Belfast firms offer tailored digital strategies](https://www.weareerudite.com/) and training to grow local businesses. I’ve filmed everything from market stalls to boutique cafés here; the difference between a scroll‑past and a queue outside your door is often one well‑shot 30‑second video and a consultant who knows where your customers live and what they search for. 

 

What a good consultant brings to the table 

* Strategy and planning: clear KPIs and a content calendar. 
* Creative production: short-form video, product photography, and ad creative that converts. 
* Paid media & targeting: geo-targeted social ads and search campaigns. 
* Local SEO & listings: Google Business Profile optimisation and local search tactics. 

Many Belfast consultants combine these services into packages or training sessions so you can scale confidently rather than guessing at tactics. 

 

How to choose — practical checklist 

* Ask for local case studies and recent results. 
* Check creative quality — a polished 30‑second Reel beats ten shaky clips. 
* [Insist on measurable KPIs (bookings, CPA, ROAS)](https://cart.com/blog/beyond-roas-the-new-kpis-that-actually-predict-growth) and weekly reporting. 
* Confirm scope and exit terms so you’re not locked into vague promises. 

If they can’t show how their work maps to your KPI, move on — charm doesn’t pay the bills. 

 

Risks, red flags, and how to avoid them 

* Vague guarantees like “we’ll go viral” are empty; ask for attribution methods. 
* Vanity metrics (followers, likes) matter less than conversions; demand conversion tracking. 
* One‑channel dependence is risky — combine SEO, social, and ads to hedge against algorithm changes. 
* No local references is a warning sign; reputable Belfast consultants publish case studies and client testimonials. 

 

Final pitch (with a wink) 

Think of a Belfast online marketing consultant as your brand’s director of first impressions: they light the scene, frame the shot, and make sure the right people see it. Invest in one great video, a clear KPI, and a consultant who knows Belfast streets — you’ll get more than clicks; you’ll get customers who actually turn up. If they can make your business look irresistible in 30 seconds and back it up with bookings, keep them — and buy them a coffee next time they’re lugging lights through St George’s Market. ",1,1767606892.0,joybrady84,0,1.0,False

### 1. Porsche x ALD Leather Racing Jacket (Red)

Verdict: 6.5/10
Review: Just being real—the leather (or pleather?) on this looks a bit stiff and plasticky in the photo. The red is super loud, which is cool if you can pull it off, but it gives off slight ""costume"" vibes rather than high-end vintage racer. The embroidery looks decent, but I’m worried about how breathable this thing is. It’s a statement piece, but looks like it might squeak when you walk.

### 2. Adidas Balenciaga-Style Hoodie (Off-White/Grey)

Verdict: 8/10
Review: This is actually a solid piece. The paneling gives it that technical/gorpcore vibe without trying too hard. The zipper running up the hood is a nice detail, though honestly, you’re probably never going to zip it all the way up unless you're cosplaying a villain. The fabric looks heavyweight and comfy. Good cop if the fit is boxy enough.

### 3. Camo Distressed Cargo Jorts

Verdict: 5/10
Review: I’m 50/50 on these. The white/grey camo pattern is fine, but the distressing looks kinda manufactured and cheap. The rips are too uniform. Also, they look pretty long—if they hit below the knee, it’s gonna look goofy. If you style them right with chunky sneakers it might work, but the quality looks like fast fashion tier.

### 4. Chrome Hearts Multicolor Cross Hoodie

Verdict: 7.5/10
Review: Classic hype piece. The wash on the black fabric looks good—has that slightly faded vintage aesthetic everyone wants. The multicolor crosses on the back are loud; you either love that rainbow look or hate it. It screams ""I follow trends,"" but objectively, the print quality looks solid. It’s played out, but still a flex.

### 5. Amiri 3-Star Beanie (White)

Verdict: 7/10
Review: It’s a beanie. Honestly, paying a premium for this is kind of crazy because the material looks like standard acrylic/wool mix. The stars are clean, but white beanies are a nightmare to keep clean—one drop of sweat or makeup and it’s cooked. It’s a clean accessory, just nothing special functionality-wise.

### 6. Broken Planet Market Knit Sweater

Verdict: 9/10
Review: Best piece in the haul comfortably. The grey knit looks thick and the puff print/texture on the graphic adds nice depth. It’s lowkey enough to wear daily but unique enough to stand out. Looks cozy as hell. Hopefully, the graphic doesn't crack after a wash, but visually, this is a GL (Green Light).

### 7. Amiri Style Distressed Jeans

Verdict: 4/10
Review: Going to be harsh here: these look super dated. The skinny fit with the massive patches and heavy distressing screams 2016 SoundCloud rapper. The blue patch (looks like it says ""DIOR"" or similar?) looks tacky and out of place. Unless you have the exact body type for these, they usually look awkward. Hard pass from me.

### 8. Corteiz/CRTZ White Track Jacket

Verdict: 7.5/10
Review: Clean retro casual vibes. The piping and the collar shape are nice. It gives off that ""Sunday morning coffee run"" energy. The only downside is the material looks a bit thin—might be see-through if you wear a dark t-shirt underneath. Also, same issue as the beanie: keeping this white clean is going to be a full-time job.

### 9. Stussy Tube Socks (3-Pack)

Verdict: 6/10
Review: Bro, they are socks. They look fine, logo is embroidered properly, but at the end of the day, they are just cotton tube socks. They’ll probably pill after two washes like most streetwear socks. Good for the ""socks and slides"" look, but don't expect life-changing comfort.",1,1767606424.0,CoutureReps,1,1.0,False
1q4hjk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/askberliners/comments/1q4hjk1/stabi_potsdamer_strasse_unwritten_and_written/,Stabi - Potsdamer strasse - Unwritten and written rules,"Hi, I am trying to get into a routine of working from a library but so far I was always scared away by Stabi. There are just some things that I really can't get used to as an expat, and I think a large part of it might be because I do not understand library culture in Germany. These are Stabi specific questions so you can help ease my anxiety a bit because I almost started to cry out of sheer feeling of being lost today. 



1. What is the logic behind leaving my backpack? I noticed this in all libraries in Germany, but here I literally put all of the things from my backpack to the carrier and they let me in. What difference does it make if it is in a backpack vs a basket? Feels so unneccessary, especially because I like to start working at 8 on the dot, and this takes so much unneccessary time. 



2. Connected, if I arrive earlier than 8, will I still be able to enter, or will I have to wait outside? 



3. What is the unassigned seating? No one explained anything related to the layout of the library, and I arrived at some empty spots and it still said they could be reserved on the desk. I was not able to see where it says it is not possible to reserve. 



4. How does the cafe work? Can I just work from the cafe for 8 hours or is that frowned upon? Context: Sometimes I do online writing groups and then I would like to chat with someone for a few minutes, but I obviously cannot do it in the quiet areas. It also seems much warmer in the coffee area, the library itself is so cold!



5. Do I also order menu items (like daily lunches) on the bar? Do I just take what I want? Is there a difference between coffee machines? 



6. Are there other places around to have cheap lunch? I was expecting to have a mensa...



7. Can you leave your things at the desk? Where I come from, you usually leave all of your things, including your laptop, if you want to go for a walk, lunch or something. They will not be touched in this period. Is it the same here or do I need to constantly carry the basket? I have quite a lot of things that I need so it is a bit of a nuissance.



8. Can I bring my own coffee/tea? Can I drink it from a closed type of mug in the library? If not, can I drink it in the cafe? Can I have my own food in the cafe? Is there a kitchenette area with a microwave in case I bring my own food?

My boyfriend are I are both 25, and have been officially together for almost a year. We live in the same town and work on the same block, so we see each other quite frequently and have become very close - we sleepover at least twice a week, call on our commutes home almost daily, have dinner/coffee dates on the weekends, go to the gym together, etc. 

It also seems pretty serious? He brings me to all his family’s events and friends’ hangouts. He’s even planing on bringing me out-of-state to meet more of his family this spring. We also spent the holidays together (christmas eve with his family, christmas day with mine). 

However, I still get this nagging feeling that I might just be a placeholder? or he might just be scared of commitment, since I’m his first long-term gf?

Like, first of all, he didn’t even want to have the bf/gf label to begin with. After a few weeks of dating, he asked to be exclusive. Then two months in, I asked what his thoughts were on labels, and he said it didn’t matter to him. I made it clear it mattered to me,  and it wasn’t until 2 months later that \*I\* asked him to be official, since we were already doing everything a bf/gf couple would do and he agreed. So did he even \*want\* to be “serious” with me??

And he avoids talking about any future plans for “us”. I don’t expect us to be talking about marriage, but it would be nice to imagine summer plans together, you know? Just a confirmation that he wants me in his life and sees some semblance of longer-term. 

And the littler things are popping out for me now. Last week, he genuinely couldnt remember what my favorite movie is even though I talk about it at least once a week and have a giant poster for it in my apartment. When we watch a show/movie he suggests, he gets so locked in. But when it’s something I suggest, he just doesn’t act interested at all.

His Christmas present to me was very much a “here whatever” gift that he got last minute. He’s not a gift-giving type in general from what I gathered at the family parties, but like I guess I just wanted some thoughtfulness from him. Especially given that he saw how I give gifts to my family/friends and how I had been planning since October, AND that he had gotten my wish list from my sister. But the gifts he did give me he got a few days before the celebrations, and weren’t on my list lol 

He also won’t even text me “good morning” back, which wouldn’t be bad if I knew his mornings were busy/phone-free. But I’ve spent mornings before work with him, and he is constantly on his phone. He’ll send me tiktoks throughout the workdays too, but won’t just text me a good morning back?

Idk am i reading too much into this??

In my head, i’m conflicted because he has these “flaws” but at the same time he’s spending so much time with me, brings me around his family, ingrained me with his friend group, pays for things, and tells me he loves me. So then, I’m wondering if Im just a good “convenient” and placeholder girlfriend. I live and work close to him, so it’s easy to be with me. Plus, given the pressure his family has put on him to get into a relationship, I assume it’s beneficial for him to bring me around the family. And then most of his friend group is partnered-up, so he is definitely less out of place in that setting when I’m there. 

I just am so scared that instead of an actual person, I’m just his girlfriend to him. ",1,1767606236.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

Finally after 6+ months of confusion increasing not decreasing, I pleaded for a sign. 

1: We were walking around, she gave me her phone to find a Starbucks, and moments later while I'm holding phone she receives a FaceTime call from her single male coworker friend. It took a while to get it out of her but she eventually tells me she had returned a previous FaceTime and placed one FaceTime. I believe nothing was going on (related to a job she applied for where he knew a friend), but it is inappropriate behavior regardless. Definitely not wife behavior in my eyes. What are the odds this happens while I'm holding her phone. 

2: Another time, I go alone to a coffee shop while she's traveling with family. At this point I'm particularly doubtful that God even cares. She's away and it's not like I'll discover anything new to shift my thinking one way or another, is what I told myself. Beside me a table opens up, and a young woman and her older relative sit down to catch up over the holidays. For a good portion of the talk, the college girl talks about her recent breakup and incompatibility reasons, while the relative reassures her and shares her own experience of jumping into marriage fast. Again thinking about everything that had to fall in place for  me to hear this very specific conversation blows my mind.

Am I overthinking this? I'm not the type to normally look for signs in everyday life. I don't think I'm entitled to it in any way. But finally in a point of desperation after doing what I could to discern, I asked in humility. At the start of the relationship I felt so thankful to God for bringing her into my lonely life. After the last 6+ months and these recent experiences, I feel sad but very thankful to God for showing me.

What followed felt less like a date and more like a side-quest from GTA.

I matched with someone who said they were visiting the city. Chat was normal at first, but they were *extremely* keen on meeting quickly, and specifically at a bar. I suggested a daytime walk and coffee. This was politely ignored. Multiple times.

Eventually we met. The place was their pick and apparently familiar to them.

I don’t really drink, so I said I’d just get a soft drink or maybe a beer. Instead, the ordering escalated faster than my HR appraisal cycle:

* Hard liquor
* Multiple rounds
* “Let’s do shots!”
* Premium cigarettes (that cost more than my phone bill)

All ordered in a blur, often while I was distracted or they stepped away.

At some point I asked for the bill.

**₹46,000.** For context: I didn’t drink most of what was ordered and didn’t smoke at all.

When I questioned her and the bar, the vibe changed instantly. My date vanished into thin air. Suddenly I had multiple staff members around me asking *very assertively* how I planned to pay.

It took a call to a local friend to de-escalate the situation and get me out.

\-----------------------

# What I learned (the hard way)

* If someone is aggressively pushing a *specific* bar and refuses simple alternatives.
* If the ordering pace feels detached from reality. Even if you have overinflated ideas of your seduction
* If you’re new to a city, Google/Friend reviews first

1q4hb4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/prevent_heart_disease/comments/1q4hb4c/heres_what_i_learned_after_going_down_a_rabbit/,Here’s what I learned after going down a rabbit hole on at-home blood pressure check (why the numbers jump around so much),"I started doing a blood pressure check at home thinking it would be super straightfoward. Like: take reading → know where you stand. Instead it turned into “why is it 118/76 one day and 138/88 the next when I feel the exact same??” So yeah, I went down a rabbit hole and here’s what helped me make sense of it in a normal-person way.  
  
First: BP is more like a weather report than a pass/fail test    
The biggest mindset shift for me was realizing blood pressure isn’t a single “score.” It’s more like your body’s constantly adjusting to what’s happening (sleep, stress, food, movement, even thinking about the reading). One higher reading isn’t automatically a crisis. Pls don’t panic if you get a random weird one.  
  
Why the numbers change even when your life feels “the same”    
Stuff that seemed small to me actually moved the needle a lot:    
\- Time of day: mornings vs evenings can be totally diffrent, and not in a consistent way for everyone    
\- Coffee / nicotine: for me it’s like flipping a switch, esp if I check too soon after    
\- Stress / rushing: even “im just running late” stress counted. Also the act of checking can make it higher (annoying lol)    
\- Talking / moving: I didn’t realize how much it matters if you’re chatting or adjusting your arm    
\- Bad sleep, dehydration, heavy meal, pain, cold room: all can nudge it up  
  
I stopped treating a single reading like “the truth”    
This was huge. When I’d see a higher number, I’d want to re-check 5 times in a row and spiral. But readings can drift just because you’re more tense the second time (bc now you’re watching it like a hawk). What helped more was thinking in “overall vibe” terms: are most readings kinda in the same neighborhood over time, or is it trending up?  
  
Home cuff vs doctor office isn’t a fair comparison    
I used to get a number at the clinic and assume thats my “real” BP. But now I see both can be weird:    
\- At the doctor: nerves/adrenaline, rushing through parking, etc    
\- At home: you can accidentally do it in a way that bumps it up (bad posture, wrong cuff size, arm not supported, etc)    
So if your home blood pressure check doesn’t match your doctor number, it doesn’t automatically mean one of them is “wrong.” It might just be two diffrent situations.  
  
Systolic vs diastolic made more sense once I stopped staring at them like grades    
Not expert talk here, but the way I think about it: the top number (systolic) seems to jump around more with “life happening” (stress, activity), while the bottom number (diastolic) feels a bit steadier for me. Not saying “only worry about X” or anything. Just that it helped me stop freaking out when only the top number was being dramatic.  
  
The pulse number on the machine is… useful but also easy to misread    
A higher pulse during a blood pressure check doesn’t always mean anything deep. It can literally be: you had coffee, you’re anxious, you just stood up, you’re dehydrated, you’re thinking about the reading. I kinda treat it as context, not a seperate problem.  
  
What I personally look for now (patterns > perfection)    
This is not rules or medical advice, just what calmed my brain:    
\- I care more about “typical range” over days/weeks than one-off spikes    
\- I try to compare apples to apples (same time of day, same conditions)    
\- If I get a weird high reading, I don’t immediatly declare doom. I just note it and see what the next few days look like  
  
Anyway, that’s my “I fell into a research hole so you don’t have to” summary. If you do home readings: what tiny thing changed your blood pressure check the most? Coffee? sleep? checking too soon after walking around? I’m curious what other people noticed in real life.",1,1767605502.0,prevent_heart_disease,0,1.0,False

Good afternoon! I recently bought an ECAM290.61 coffee machine, my first coffee machine. And I noticed that clean, dry ground coffee accumulates in the tray, near the back wall. It shouldn't be like that. I think this happened because I adjusted the grind setting by several notches at once when the coffee machine was not working. To be honest, I turned it back and forth several times. Now I have learned that I should select no more than 1 notch WHILE the machine is running. In the photo, coffee has accumulated from 3 cups of cappuccino and 2 large cups of black coffee. Please advise me on the best course of action. ",1,1767605480.0,DeLonghi,0,1.0,False

At first I thought it was from drinking coffee, or from occasionally forgetting to brush my teeth when I’m overworked, though that would only happen for a day or two at most.
After some time I tried a TikTok remedy where 3 percent hydrogen peroxide is diluted with an equal amount of water and mixed with baking soda to remove tartar. It didn’t work. Thinking the dilution was the issue, I stopped adding water and baking soda and brushed using only hydrogen peroxide. I later stopped doing this, and it has been months since then. I just thought if this can be the cause?

Recently I started having bad breath, which is very unusual for me. It smells like the kind of breath you get when you are extremely hungry. Then I began having toothaches, and now my teeth look much worse. They are yellow, decayed, and honestly disgusting. The situation has clearly gotten worse.

### 1. Porsche x ALD Leather Racing Jacket (Red)

Verdict: 6.5/10
Review: Just being real—the leather (or pleather?) on this looks a bit stiff and plasticky in the photo. The red is super loud, which is cool if you can pull it off, but it gives off slight ""costume"" vibes rather than high-end vintage racer. The embroidery looks decent, but I’m worried about how breathable this thing is. It’s a statement piece, but looks like it might squeak when you walk.

### 2. Adidas Balenciaga-Style Hoodie (Off-White/Grey)

Verdict: 8/10
Review: This is actually a solid piece. The paneling gives it that technical/gorpcore vibe without trying too hard. The zipper running up the hood is a nice detail, though honestly, you’re probably never going to zip it all the way up unless you're cosplaying a villain. The fabric looks heavyweight and comfy. Good cop if the fit is boxy enough.

### 3. Camo Distressed Cargo Jorts

Verdict: 5/10
Review: I’m 50/50 on these. The white/grey camo pattern is fine, but the distressing looks kinda manufactured and cheap. The rips are too uniform. Also, they look pretty long—if they hit below the knee, it’s gonna look goofy. If you style them right with chunky sneakers it might work, but the quality looks like fast fashion tier.

### 4. Chrome Hearts Multicolor Cross Hoodie

Verdict: 7.5/10
Review: Classic hype piece. The wash on the black fabric looks good—has that slightly faded vintage aesthetic everyone wants. The multicolor crosses on the back are loud; you either love that rainbow look or hate it. It screams ""I follow trends,"" but objectively, the print quality looks solid. It’s played out, but still a flex.

### 5. Amiri 3-Star Beanie (White)

Verdict: 7/10
Review: It’s a beanie. Honestly, paying a premium for this is kind of crazy because the material looks like standard acrylic/wool mix. The stars are clean, but white beanies are a nightmare to keep clean—one drop of sweat or makeup and it’s cooked. It’s a clean accessory, just nothing special functionality-wise.

### 6. Broken Planet Market Knit Sweater

Verdict: 9/10
Review: Best piece in the haul comfortably. The grey knit looks thick and the puff print/texture on the graphic adds nice depth. It’s lowkey enough to wear daily but unique enough to stand out. Looks cozy as hell. Hopefully, the graphic doesn't crack after a wash, but visually, this is a GL (Green Light).

### 7. Amiri Style Distressed Jeans

Verdict: 4/10
Review: Going to be harsh here: these look super dated. The skinny fit with the massive patches and heavy distressing screams 2016 SoundCloud rapper. The blue patch (looks like it says ""DIOR"" or similar?) looks tacky and out of place. Unless you have the exact body type for these, they usually look awkward. Hard pass from me.

### 8. Corteiz/CRTZ White Track Jacket

Verdict: 7.5/10
Review: Clean retro casual vibes. The piping and the collar shape are nice. It gives off that ""Sunday morning coffee run"" energy. The only downside is the material looks a bit thin—might be see-through if you wear a dark t-shirt underneath. Also, same issue as the beanie: keeping this white clean is going to be a full-time job.

### 9. Air Jordan 5 Retro (Anthracite/Grey)

Verdict: 8.5/10
Review: Solid kicks. The suede looks like it has some life to it (movement), which is good. The stitching looks consistent. The AJ5 is a bulky shoe, so it’s tricky to style with skinny pants, but great with baggy cargos. The icy blue sole is fresh now but be prepared for it to yellow nicely over time. Can't go wrong with this colorway.

### 10. Stussy Tube Socks (3-Pack)

Verdict: 6/10
Review: Bro, they are socks. They look fine, logo is embroidered properly, but at the end of the day, they are just cotton tube socks. They’ll probably pill after two washes like most streetwear socks. Good for the ""socks and slides"" look, but don't expect life-changing comfort.",1,1767605089.0,FashionRepsEurope,1,1.0,False
1q4h797,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaStatistics/comments/1q4h797/powering_fmcg_growth_with_people_technology_and/,"Powering FMCG Growth with People, Technology and Real-Time Insights.","https://preview.redd.it/18qml92v2ibg1.jpg?width=840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1528b610286c9b47e6d47ea3a83f8c13eb8d1e1

In the fast-paced world of Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG), brand managers often struggle to ensure perfect execution across the vast and varied Indian market. A single missed detail – an out-of- stock item, an untrained promoter, or a retailer unaware of a scheme – can mean lost sales and eroded trust. OpenReach, India’s leading field marketing and brand experience agency, is addressing these challenges through a story of integration and innovation. With over 5,000 on-ground professionals reaching millions of households across 900+ cities and towns, OpenReach weaves together trained people, cutting-edge digital tools, and data-driven processes to deliver end-to-end value. This blog post explores how OpenReach is transforming the FMCG ecosystem – driving brand sales through omnipresent promoters, empowering retailers via transparent e-payments, generating youth employment, rigorously training its teams, equipping field officers with tech, and providing real-time insights that were once unimaginable. It’s a journey of transparency, trust, and executional excellence, offering brand managers a compelling strategic partner.

 

# Reaching Consumers Everywhere: Trained Promoters Driving Sales

For FMCG brands, visibility and engagement at the last mile are paramount. OpenReach deploys trained sales promoters and merchandisers across every channel – from modern trade outlets and supermarkets to general trade kirana stores deep in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities. These promoters don’t stop at shops; they take brands to gyms, open-air markets, residential societies, and corporate parks, meeting consumers where they live, work, and play. Picture a promoter offering sample protein bars at a local gym, or a merchandiser ensuring a new snack brand’s display stands out in a neighborhood grocery. By engaging consumers at every touchpoint, these on-ground teams actively influence purchase decisions and build brand awareness in ways mass media alone cannot.

 

Importantly, OpenReach’s model is not about scattering freelance promoters with minimal oversight – it is a fully managed service with end-to-end ownership. The company handles everything from promoter recruitment and training to daily attendance tracking, sales monitoring, and performance management “under one roof”. In practice, this means a brand manager can launch a campaign knowing that OpenReach will staff it with the right people, monitor each promoter’s daily sales or sampling numbers, ensure merchandising standards are met, and quickly replace or retrain underperformers. Whether the goal is short-term product trial or sustained sales growth, OpenReach commits to hitting the targets it agrees upon – effectively taking full ownership of on-ground outcomes. This integrated approach relieves brand managers from coordinating multiple vendors or worrying about on-field execution details. OpenReach becomes an extension of the brand team, translating strategy into action on the store floor with agility and accountability.

 

The impact on sales is direct. By having a human presence in stores and communities, OpenReach helps brands cut through the noise and connect with consumers. A promoter who can explain a product’s benefits or run an in-store demo can convert curious shoppers into buyers on the spot. A well-trained merchandiser can negotiate better shelf placement and ensure stock replenishment, preventing lost sales. And by being present in non-traditional venues like society events or office parks, OpenReach opens new avenues for brands to reach potential customers. In essence, OpenReach’s army of promoters creates a ubiquitous brand presence, driving sales in places and ways traditional advertising cannot.

# Empowering Retailers through Transparent E-Payments and Schemes

https://preview.redd.it/2d0g4lj91ibg1.jpg?width=840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4990c3663e264fcc0e615aff857e1b35ffa52a32

While promoters influence consumers, another critical stakeholder in the FMCG ecosystem is the retailer. India has over 13 million retail outlets – the kirana shops, chemists, pan-bidi stalls, and supermarkets that are the backbone of FMCG distribution. For years, small retailers have faced challenges participating in company schemes and promotions. They often learn about new schemes late (if at all) and rely on distributors’ word-of-mouth. Incentive payouts, like credit notes or cash-back for achieving sales targets, can be delayed or opaque, hurting the retailer’s cash flow and trust in the brand. OpenReach recognized that empowering retailers with speed and transparency would not only improve retailer relationships but also ultimately boost sales of the brand.

 

OpenReach’s end-to-end digital E-Payment Payout Solution is a game changer. It ensures every retailer knows about a brand’s incentive schemes from Day One without depending on distributors. Upon onboarding, the retailer installs the OpenPay mobile app, which immediately displays all active schemes, targets, and rewards in the retailer’s preferred language. Whether a shop owner is in a metro city or a remote town, they can clearly understand the scheme conditions and track their progress. The app shows, in real time, how much they’ve earned from each scheme and even provides a 12-month history of incentives, bringing unprecedented clarity. No more guesswork or waiting for a distributor’s visit – the retailer is always in the loop and in control.

 

This transparency has profound effects on retailer behavior and loyalty. When a scheme payout is due, the system deposits the incentive directly into the retailer’s bank account and triggers an instant SMS notification of the credit. Suddenly, the old cycle of waiting weeks for a credit note is replaced by near-immediate reward. This boost in cash flow and trust motivates retailers to engage more actively with the brand’s programs. As the OpenPay app shows their earnings grow, many retailers have started increasing their stock orders in both frequency and quantity to capitalize on schemes. Essentially, by guaranteeing timely, transparent payouts, OpenReach turns schemes into a two-way promise: the brand promises quick reward and the retailer promises greater sales effort.

 

Such mutual confidence leads to higher loyalty. A kirana owner who reliably receives their incentive every month feels valued and “seen” by the brand. They are more likely to push that brand’s products to customers, dedicate eye-level shelf space, or participate in future promotions. OpenReach’s own data and experience bear this out – transparent digital schemes build real trust. As one voiceover in the OpenReach narrative notes, when kirana stores see timely deposits, “their confidence in the program grows, their motivation increases, and their relationship with the brand becomes much stronger”. In a sense, OpenReach has digitized and democratized trade promotions: any retailer, no matter how small or remote, can join a scheme with a few taps and reap the rewards without hassle. This level of inclusion and empowerment is reshaping brand-retailer dynamics across India’s ₹900 billion FMCG market, fostering a network of loyal retailers who trust the brand’s promises.

#  Generating Employment and Opportunity Across India

https://preview.redd.it/z88zkkxb1ibg1.jpg?width=840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3287946d8ee23c019c64eddf36ae1b8ff0e21aea

Behind every successful in-store campaign or retailer onboarding drive is a team of dedicated people on the ground. OpenReach’s model has a significant side-effect: it is creating thousands of jobs and upskilling youth across urban and rural India. With a footprint in over 900 cities and towns and teams that speak the local language, OpenReach actively recruits from the communities where it operates. Young men and women from semi-urban districts, small towns, and rural regions are being hired as sales promoters, field officers, customer onboarding specialists, and more. By mobilizing local talent, OpenReach not only ensures language and cultural compatibility in each area, but also opens the door for these individuals to build careers in the FMCG and retail sector.

 

Today, OpenReach has over 5,000 professionals on the ground executing campaigns and engaging with retailers. These are not temporary gig workers; they are full-time team members who undergo training (and retraining), work with advanced tools, and deliver results every day. For many, this is a first formal job that provides stable income and professional development. A college graduate in a Tier-3 town might join as a promoter for a few stores in their area – after a year of good performance, they could become a team leader supervising others, or move into a field officer role handling retailer onboarding. OpenReach’s growth from a zero-investor startup to a ₹100 crore enterprise was, as the company acknowledges, “made possible by our people” who have become “true partners in our mission”.

 

The employment generation goes beyond just numbers. It’s also about skill development and youth empowerment. OpenReach recruits often from colleges or local institutes, especially looking for youths with aptitude and attitude even if they lack prior experience. By placing them in real-world sales scenarios with strong guidance and tech support, OpenReach is building a new workforce of savvy, street-smart sales and marketing professionals. In a country where educated unemployment is a challenge, such initiatives provide a valuable bridge. The ripple effects are significant: incomes earned are spent in local economies, and the work experience gained by these youths increases their future employability (whether within OpenReach’s expanding operations or elsewhere). There’s also a sense of pride and ownership – a promoter in a small town isn’t just a nameless contractor; they are part of a nationally coordinated team bringing big brands to their hometown’s stores. This human impact of OpenReach’s model underscores a larger point: when you integrate social objectives (jobs, skill-building) with business goals (sales, distribution), you create a more sustainable and inclusive growth path for the FMCG ecosystem.

 

# Structured Training: Grooming an Elite Field Force

How does OpenReach ensure that thousands of dispersed field personnel maintain high quality and consistent standards? The answer lies in its structured in-house training ecosystem. This is not ad-hoc or “one and done” training – it’s a continuous learning journey that blends classroom instruction with hands-on practice. Every promoter and merchandiser goes through a rigorous onboarding program covering four core pillars: Product Knowledge, Grooming & Professional Etiquette, Consumer Engagement, and Sales Excellence. They learn the features and unique selling points of the products they will promote, so they can speak confidently and accurately. They are coached in personal grooming, body language, and etiquette – essential for making a positive impression during in-store interactions. They practice consumer engagement techniques, from approaching shoppers and pitching products to handling objections and educating customers. And they are drilled in sales excellence tactics like closing techniques and upselling, so that every consumer interaction has the best chance of converting into a sale.

 

Critically, training at OpenReach also emphasizes compliance and execution standards, such as planogram adherence and the correct use of point-of-sale materials. Promoters are taught that it’s not just what they do but how they execute that drives success. A product may need to be placed on a specific shelf position as per a planogram – if it’s misplaced, sales can suffer. Therefore, trainees learn to treat merchandising guidelines as gospel. They also learn to report their work digitally: every participant gets hands-on training with OpenReach’s digital tools for reporting, sales tracking, and compliance monitoring. For instance, they practice using a mobile app to check in to a store, upload a shelf photo, or record sales data, so that by the time they hit the field, they are comfortable with technology. This tech training ensures that data from the field flows back in real time (more on that later) and that promoters can be audited for compliance (e.g., did they actually visit all assigned stores and set up the displays?).

 

Training doesn’t stop after the initial induction. “Continuous Learning, Continuous Growth” is a mantra ingrained in OpenReach’s culture. Every month, refresher sessions and project-specific trainings are conducted. If a new product is added to the portfolio, promoters get updated product knowledge briefings. If a recurring issue is observed (say, inconsistent billing at some stores or a dip in conversion rate), the team will organize a focused coaching session or role-play to address it. OpenReach also runs compliance audits and performance reviews as learning opportunities – for example, a surprise market visit by a supervisor might reveal a promoter’s grooming isn’t up to standard, which then leads to one-on-one feedback and correction. By investing in their people’s skills and well-being, OpenReach ensures that the field force not only delivers excellence today but keeps improving for tomorrow. The result is a virtuous cycle: better-trained promoters achieve better results, which reinforces the value of training, and so on. For brand managers, this should be reassuring – it means when OpenReach says it will execute a campaign, the people representing your brand are knowledgeable, professional, and prepared for real-world challenges. They don’t just stock shelves; they create engaging shopping experiences and uphold the brand’s image in each interaction.

# Tech-Enabled Field Operations: OpenKYC and the Power of Real-Time Dashboards

https://preview.redd.it/5nh566jd1ibg1.jpg?width=840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=600614252c89b0ee41ae9e496510f3f0e5aadebb

Training and people are one side of the coin; technology and process are the other. OpenReach has heavily invested in proprietary technology to streamline field operations, reduce manual effort, and give all stakeholders greater visibility. A prime example is the tool called OpenKYC, a mobile application designed for sales officers to onboard retailers swiftly and paperlessly. Traditionally, enrolling a retailer into a scheme or database involved filling forms, collecting photocopies of documents, and waiting days (if not weeks) for verification. OpenReach tore up that playbook. With OpenKYC, a sales officer can complete a retailer’s KYC (Know Your Customer) process in just 30 seconds flat – entirely on a smartphone. All they need to do is capture the retailer’s documents (e.g. Aadhaar, PAN, bank details) using the phone camera, and the app’s back-end instantly verifies them against government databases (with one-time password authentication for Aadhaar). No paperwork, no couriering forms to HQ, no backlog – the moment the officer hits “submit”, the retailer is verified and onboarded. This incredible speed (40+ store KYCs in a single day per officer is now achievable) means that when a brand launches a new incentive program, the enabling infrastructure (retailer sign-ups) doesn’t become a bottleneck.

 

Beyond speed, OpenKYC brings accuracy and accountability. Every KYC record is geo-tagged with the store’s coordinates and includes a photo of the store and the owner’s photo with a digital signature, all captured through the app. This ensures the retailer is genuine and the data is audit-trail ready. For the sales officers on the ground, OpenKYC also serves as a personal productivity dashboard. As soon as they log in, they can see their assigned territory and a list of stores to onboard, and filter them by status (Pending, In Progress, Completed). A live counter shows how many KYCs they’ve completed and how many are left, effectively tracking their beat performance in real time. They can even view which of “their” retailers have started participating in schemes and earning incentives, giving them insight into which stores might need more attention or follow-up. By replacing clipboards and guesswork with a slick app and real-time data, OpenReach has empowered its field officers to be more efficient and proactive. From a brand manager’s perspective, this means faster market coverage (e.g., rolling out a scheme nationwide in days rather than months) and confidence that no target retailer is left uncontacted due to process delays.

 

Another crucial tech solution is OpenReach’s route optimization and beat management system. Covering more stores is only useful if it’s done effectively. OpenReach built an in-house software that generates an optimal Permanent Journey Plan (PJP) for each merchandiser or field rep, once the brand provides the list of outlets and priorities. You simply upload the store list, assign visit frequency or priority levels, and provide the merchandiser’s home base – the system then auto-calculates the most efficient daily route, minimizing travel time and maximizing stores visited. This means a merchandiser isn’t zig-zagging across town randomly; they follow a smart path that covers the “right stores at the right time”. The benefit is twofold: the field team’s productivity increases (more outlets serviced per day) and the consistency of store coverage improves. Every single day, the maximum number of shelves are checked and serviced. For brands, this addresses a perennial pain point – inconsistent market coverage. With OpenReach, if you’ve requested a 1,000-store merchandising program, you can be sure those 1,000 stores will actually be visited on the schedule intended, thanks to tech-driven planning.

 

Finally, all these field activities funnel into live digital dashboards accessible to brand managers and project teams. OpenReach provides clients with a secure web portal where they can see, in real time, what’s happening on the ground. A manager can log in and view how many retailers have been onboarded today, or how many store visits have been completed versus planned. They can drill down by territory to see, for example, that in North Zone, 95% of target outlets have active promotions running. Every sales officer’s performance is visible – how many retailers did officer A onboard, what is the sales uplift in officer B’s territory, etc. – along with each retailer’s engagement (sales, incentive earned). This real-time, granular visibility is revolutionary for brand teams accustomed to waiting weeks for summary reports. Instead of calling an agency for updates, the data is “at the click of a button” on a live dashboard. If something is off-track – say a particular city’s activation is lagging – the brand team can spot it immediately and coordinate a mid-campaign correction with OpenReach. The digital dashboard also doubles as a compliance and audit tool: all KYC documents, store photos, and payment records are stored and accessible for verification. This ensures that every piece of the program is transparent and traceable, protecting the brand from fraud and leakage. In short, OpenReach’s technology backbone ties together the dispersed field operations into a single, coherent system that delivers clarity and control to brand managers.

# Real-Time Insights and Execution Excellence: Data That Drives Decisions

Every morning, a brand manager can grab a cup of coffee and open the OpenReach dashboard to see a live pulse of their on-ground execution. This scenario was unthinkable a few years ago, but today it’s reality – real-time insights from the field are transforming how brands make decisions. OpenReach’s integrated solutions generate a wealth of data: not just sales figures, but also stock levels, share-of-shelf metrics, competitor insights, and qualitative feedback from promoters. Most importantly, this data is verified and comes with visual evidence. Brands no longer have to rely on anecdotal reports or delayed audit summaries; they can see what’s happening in each store, as it happens.

 

On the shelves of a typical Indian kirana store, products compete fiercely for visibility and stock space. OpenReach recognizes that “jo dikhta hai, woh bikta hai” – what is seen is what sells. One of OpenReach’s core focus areas is measuring and maximizing the brand’s Share of Shelf (SOS) in each outlet. To achieve this at scale, they employ image recognition technology that makes tracking SOS as simple as taking a photo. A merchandiser can snap a picture of a shelf through the app; in one click, the system analyzes the image and calculates how many facings the brand’s products have versus competitor products. Within seconds, the brand manager might see on the dashboard that in Store X, their brand has 8 facings out of 40 in the category (20% SOS) whereas a key competitor has 15 facings. But OpenReach doesn’t stop at just showing numbers – the insights are actionable. The system can flag stores where the share of shelf is below a desired threshold or where a specific SKU is missing from the shelf. It also measures other shelf metrics like number of bays and total shelves in the category, building a complete picture of presence vs. potential. These image-driven audits happen continually across thousands of stores, feeding a live SOS analytics report to the brand. For a category manager, this is gold: they can, for example, identify that in Mumbai their shelf share is high but in Tier-2 towns it’s lower, prompting targeted interventions like additional displays or promoter focus in those towns. By quantifying shelf presence with precision, OpenReach helps brands ensure that their visibility translates to sales – after all, if you’re not adequately visible on the shelf, you can’t expect to win the shopper’s rupee.

 

Another area where real-time data is making a decisive impact is out-of-stock (OOS) management. Out-of-stock means a product that should be on the shelf isn’t there when the customer wants to buy it. This is a silent killer of sales – globally, nearly $1 trillion in retail sales are lost every year due to OOS issues. In India, studies estimate FMCG companies lose up to 25% of potential sales from stock-outs. It’s often not a supply problem per se, but an execution gap: the store’s system might think stock is available, but due to shrinkage, pilferage, or errors, the shelf is actually empty. OpenReach tackles this with a Live Stock Alert feature that brings a proactive approach to stock management. Using its merchandising app, OpenReach sets a Minimum Base Quantity (MBQ) for every product SKU on a per-store basis – essentially a threshold that triggers a refill alert. For instance, if a shampoo’s MBQ is 10 units and the shelf/backroom count drops near that, the system automatically sends an SMS and email alert to the responsible Area Sales Manager and the sales officer before the product actually goes out of stock. This pre-emptive alert system is a game-changer: rather than waiting to discover an empty shelf on the next visit (by which time sales have been lost and perhaps a competitor has filled the gap), the team is prompted to take action immediately. The merchandiser can be rerouted to replenish, or the distributor can be informed to deliver stock, or if the product is truly unavailable, at least management knows to adjust forecasts. By linking ground-level inventory signals to real-time responses, OpenReach is helping brands plug leaks that previously would only be noticed in month-end reports. The benefit is not just immediate revenue protection but also long-term consumer loyalty – a customer who finds their favorite brand consistently in stock is far less likely to switch to a competitor out of frustration.

 

Real-time insights aren’t limited to stock and shelf metrics. Promoter performance and consumer interaction data are also captured live. OpenReach’s promoter app logs every single consumer engagement, sale, and feedback snippet. For example, promoters can input how many samples they distributed and how many conversions to purchase happened, and even tag whether the customer was a first-time buyer or a repeat consumer. All of this streams to the client dashboard. One of OpenReach’s leaders explained it thus: the app provides live access to “sales figures, customer interaction data, feedback details, photos, first-time vs. repeat customer data, and even the GPS location of every team member – all in real time”. This means a brand manager running a sampling campaign can watch the cumulative sales figure tick upwards during the day and see, say, that 30% of buyers at a mall demo were repeat customers (indicating strong brand loyalty) or that a particular objection kept coming up via feedback forms. In the past, such information might come in a compiled spreadsheet weeks later, but now it’s available instantly. And because everything is time-stamped and geo-tagged (with photos as proof), the data is credible. No more inflated claims or doubts about “did that event really happen as reported?” – it’s verified data driving decision-making. If something isn’t working, mid-course corrections can be made. If something is working brilliantly (say one type of messaging or offer gets great response), it can be replicated in other locations the very next day.

 

Lastly, OpenReach extends insights to POSM (Point of Sale Materials) deployment, ensuring marketing collateral actually makes it to the outlets and is properly installed. Brands spend a lot on posters, danglers, standees, etc., but often face a black hole when trying to track these materials. OpenReach offers end-to-end POSM development and deployment tracking so the brand “always knows the exact status of promotional materials – from printing to installation”. Field teams use their app to confirm when a POSM item is delivered to a store and even upload a photo once it’s put up in the store. This closes the loop on BTL (below-the-line) marketing spend: a brand manager can open the dashboard and see, for example, that out of 500 shelf wobblers sent out for a campaign, 480 are confirmed in-place with photo evidence (and the remaining 20 stores can be followed up). Such transparency in execution was virtually unheard of – typically, a brand would send materials to distributors and hope they got to stores. Now, with OpenReach’s execution visibility, every standee and poster is accounted for, ensuring the brand’s message is consistently visible across markets.

# Conclusion: A Cohesive Ecosystem for Growth, Trust, and Excellence

OpenReach’s strategic value to FMCG brand managers lies in this cohesive ecosystem it has built – one that integrates people, process, and technology into a single force for market execution. By driving consumer demand through well-trained promoters, ensuring retailers are motivated and equipped to push products, creating employment and capable teams on the ground, and backing it all up with real-time data flows, OpenReach addresses FMCG challenges at every level. The scale it operates at (thousands of activations across hundreds of cities simultaneously) provides comfort that a brand’s reach won’t be limited by execution capacity. The transparency it offers (through digital dashboards and verified field data) means brand managers are never in the dark; they see what’s happening as clearly as if they were physically present in each market. And the executional excellence – stemming from rigorous training, process innovation, and tech adoption – ensures that strategies translate into results consistently, not just in a one-off lucky campaign.

 

Perhaps most importantly, OpenReach changes the nature of the relationship between a brand and its field partner. It’s no longer a transactional arrangement (“agency sends X people to do Y activity”). Instead, it’s a partnership built on shared goals and trust. OpenReach’s promise to take full ownership of targets and its investment in systems that give clients a “single source of truth” for all on-ground data have flipped the script. Brand managers can focus on strategy and innovation, knowing that execution – often the Achilles’ heel in FMCG – is in very capable hands. In an era where data drives decisions, OpenReach brings data from the last mile into the boardroom in real time. In an era where trust is the currency (be it trust of a retailer, a consumer, or a client), OpenReach builds trust through transparency and performance. And in a market as diverse and dynamic as India, OpenReach provides the agility and local insight (via its distributed yet unified team) that brands need to stay ahead.",1,1767605089.0,IndiaStatistics,0,1.0,False

### 1. Porsche x ALD Leather Racing Jacket (Red)

Verdict: 6.5/10
Review: Just being real—the leather (or pleather?) on this looks a bit stiff and plasticky in the photo. The red is super loud, which is cool if you can pull it off, but it gives off slight ""costume"" vibes rather than high-end vintage racer. The embroidery looks decent, but I’m worried about how breathable this thing is. It’s a statement piece, but looks like it might squeak when you walk.

### 2. Adidas Balenciaga-Style Hoodie (Off-White/Grey)

Verdict: 8/10
Review: This is actually a solid piece. The paneling gives it that technical/gorpcore vibe without trying too hard. The zipper running up the hood is a nice detail, though honestly, you’re probably never going to zip it all the way up unless you're cosplaying a villain. The fabric looks heavyweight and comfy. Good cop if the fit is boxy enough.

### 3. Camo Distressed Cargo Jorts

Verdict: 5/10
Review: I’m 50/50 on these. The white/grey camo pattern is fine, but the distressing looks kinda manufactured and cheap. The rips are too uniform. Also, they look pretty long—if they hit below the knee, it’s gonna look goofy. If you style them right with chunky sneakers it might work, but the quality looks like fast fashion tier.

### 4. Chrome Hearts Multicolor Cross Hoodie

Verdict: 7.5/10
Review: Classic hype piece. The wash on the black fabric looks good—has that slightly faded vintage aesthetic everyone wants. The multicolor crosses on the back are loud; you either love that rainbow look or hate it. It screams ""I follow trends,"" but objectively, the print quality looks solid. It’s played out, but still a flex.

### 5. Amiri 3-Star Beanie (White)

Verdict: 7/10
Review: It’s a beanie. Honestly, paying a premium for this is kind of crazy because the material looks like standard acrylic/wool mix. The stars are clean, but white beanies are a nightmare to keep clean—one drop of sweat or makeup and it’s cooked. It’s a clean accessory, just nothing special functionality-wise.

### 6. Broken Planet Market Knit Sweater

Verdict: 9/10
Review: Best piece in the haul comfortably. The grey knit looks thick and the puff print/texture on the graphic adds nice depth. It’s lowkey enough to wear daily but unique enough to stand out. Looks cozy as hell. Hopefully, the graphic doesn't crack after a wash, but visually, this is a GL (Green Light).

### 7. Amiri Style Distressed Jeans

Verdict: 4/10
Review: Going to be harsh here: these look super dated. The skinny fit with the massive patches and heavy distressing screams 2016 SoundCloud rapper. The blue patch (looks like it says ""DIOR"" or similar?) looks tacky and out of place. Unless you have the exact body type for these, they usually look awkward. Hard pass from me.

### 8. Corteiz/CRTZ White Track Jacket

Verdict: 7.5/10
Review: Clean retro casual vibes. The piping and the collar shape are nice. It gives off that ""Sunday morning coffee run"" energy. The only downside is the material looks a bit thin—might be see-through if you wear a dark t-shirt underneath. Also, same issue as the beanie: keeping this white clean is going to be a full-time job.

### 9. Air Jordan 5 Retro (Anthracite/Grey)

Verdict: 8.5/10
Review: Solid kicks. The suede looks like it has some life to it (movement), which is good. The stitching looks consistent. The AJ5 is a bulky shoe, so it’s tricky to style with skinny pants, but great with baggy cargos. The icy blue sole is fresh now but be prepared for it to yellow nicely over time. Can't go wrong with this colorway.

### 10. Stussy Tube Socks (3-Pack)

Verdict: 6/10
Review: Bro, they are socks. They look fine, logo is embroidered properly, but at the end of the day, they are just cotton tube socks.

MAGAZINE KAVE","

[https://magazinekave.com/en-us/articles/87](https://magazinekave.com/en-us/articles/87)



Hangul, which seems theoretically perfect, becomes a huge barrier in practice. Many foreign learners study for over two years and still get frustrated because they cannot distinguish the subtle pronunciation differences of Koreans. The biggest challenge is distinguishing between 'plain sounds (e.g., ㄱ, ㅂ, ㄷ)', 'tensed sounds (e.g., ㄲ, ㅃ, ㄸ)', and 'aspirated sounds (e.g., ㅋ, ㅍ, ㅌ)'. For English speakers, 'g' and 'k' are distinguishable, but the Korean 'ㄱ' is somewhere in between or changes depending on the situation. Especially, 'tensed sounds' are produced by tensing the vocal cords, a phonation method rare in Western languages.



Plain sound (gabang): Starts at a low pitch and softly.



Aspirated/Tensed sound (kkabang/kabang): Strongly at a relatively high pitch.



When pronouncing ""gabang (bag)"", Koreans unconsciously start with a low tone, but foreigners pronounce it high, making it sound like ""kkabang"". This is not a consonant issue but a tone or intonation issue. If one does not realize that not only the intensity but also the pitch of the sound contributes to distinguishing meaning, no matter how much they mimic the mouth shape, they cannot produce native-like sounds.



Another structural feature of Hangul is the 'initial+medial+final' block structure. Here, the final consonant, or 'batchim', plays a role in blocking or altering the flow of sound.



Representative sound phenomenon: Leaf (ip), mouth (ip) have different letters but end with the same pronunciation \[ip\]. This phenomenon, converging into seven representative sounds (ㄱ,ㄴ,ㄷ,ㄹ,ㅁ,ㅂ,ㅇ), is economical but a chaos of confusion for learners doing dictation.  



Consonant assimilation: 'Gukmul' changes to \[gungmul\], 'simni' changes to \[simni\]. This is 'fluidity' that resembles the nature of the following word for ease of pronunciation.



I would like to interpret this in connection with the 'relationship-oriented culture' of Korean society. I (the preceding letter) am not a fixed entity but willingly change my appearance (pronunciation) in relation to others (the following letter). Korean pronunciation rules thoroughly aim for 'harmony' and 'softness'. This linguistic habit, which avoids abrupt breaks and prefers flowing liquid and nasal sounds, is also connected to the culture of 'jeong' (affection) embedded in the collective unconscious of Koreans.



The ultimate level of Korean grammar, the world of particles.



Situation A: ""Who is Park Su-nam?"" -〉 ""I (ga/iga) am Park Su-nam."" (Focus on the subject as new information)



Situation B: ""What kind of person is Park Su-nam?"" -〉 ""I (neun/eun) am a reporter."" (The subject is already known, focus on the following explanation)



This is more of an 'information structure' issue than grammar. Only by understanding where the speaker is shining the spotlight in the conversation can the correct particle be chosen. This subtle nuance, which even AI translators often mistake, ultimately belongs to the realm of 'nunchi' (tact), which can only be internalized through the accumulation of numerous human-to-human conversation data.



As of 2026, the language learning market has passed the technological singularity. If past learning was a lonely battle memorizing texts at a desk, now it is a hybrid experience combining AI and the metaverse.



Evolution of AI Tutor: The 'Korean Ai App' service 'Mycot' goes beyond simple Q&A. It analyzes the user's emotions and corrects even the subtle pitch of pronunciation. Especially, 'Teuida', reviewed in , offers first-person perspective virtual conversation scenarios, providing an immersive experience as if you were the protagonist in a drama. Their slogan, ""To learn swimming, you must enter the water; to learn Korean, you must speak,"" is accurate. However, as user reviews point out, short word recognition failures or technical limitations of voice recognition still exist. AI is an excellent sparring partner but cannot perfectly simulate the uncertainty of the real ring (reality).  



Metaverse Sejong Institute: Led by the Korean government, the Metaverse Sejong Institute gathers learners from around the world into a virtual space. In 2025, learners walk through Namdaemun Market in Seoul with their avatars and order coffee in a virtual cafe from their rooms. Research has proven that this metaverse-based learning effectively increases learner immersion and reduces anxiety. It is a new way of forming a 'language community' beyond the constraints of physical space.



With numerous apps pouring in, strategic choices according to the learner's disposition are necessary. The positioning of major apps in 2026 analyzed by the author is as follows.





\[K-LANGUAGE 2\] The Barrier of Hangul...Why Do Foreigners Get Frustrated? \[Magazine Kave=Park Su nam\]

""Throw away the books and turn on Netflix."" This is no longer a joke. Shadowing drama lines like a shadow is the best way to internalize intonation and speed. The dopamine from transcribing BTS lyrics and translating interviews of your favorite actors is a more powerful motivator than any textbook. Learners in 2026 are not passive recipients but active producers (Prosumers) who create subtitles and perform fan translations.



Learning Korean is the process of internalizing the hierarchy of Korean society. As seen in , between asking ""Did you eat?"" and ""Did you dine?"" lies the aesthetics of social distancing beyond mere age difference.



Many Western learners complain at this point, ""Why is it so complicated?"" But this is evidence of how much Korean society values 'relationships'. Language constantly reaffirms the positions of oneself and others and acts as a GPS to set appropriate distances. Using informal speech indicates that the sense of distance has converged to zero (0), a sign of intimacy, while using honorifics signals securing a safe distance of mutual respect.



Korean outside textbooks evolves like a living organism. As of 2026, Korea's linguistic landscape is a mix of the language of the MZ generation dreaming of a 'God-saeng (diligent and exemplary life)' and the Alpha generation born with smartphones in hand.  



The economics of abbreviation: 'Eoljuk-a (frozen to death but still iced Americano)', 'Jaman-chu (pursuing natural meetings)' show the unique economy of Korean that compresses long sentences into four syllables. This reflects the speed battle of busy modern society.



Symbolization of emotions: Texts composed only of consonants/vowels like 'ㅋㅋㅋ', 'ㅎㅎㅎ', 'ㅠㅠ' are hieroglyphs of the digital age. The list (ㅇㅈ, ㄱㄱ, ㅂㅂ) is now a code that must be memorized to chat with Koreans on KakaoTalk.  



Projection of social anxiety: Neologisms like 'stupid cost', 'impulse spending from stress' reflect the sad self-portrait of modern people trying to relieve stress through consumption in a high-cost, competitive society. Learning slang is a humanistic reading of the desires and deficiencies of that society.



No matter how advanced AI becomes, there are words it cannot translate. 'Jeong' is not just love or friendship. It is a sticky bond mixed with love and hate, an expression of the collective self that you and I are not strangers. 'Nunchi' is the ability to hear what is not said, the ability to grasp context. Being good at Korean is not just knowing many words but reading this invisible air and riding its flow.



How to Approach?

\[Step 1: 0\~3 months\] Draw a Map of Sounds (Physical Training)

This period is about training the 'body', not the brain.



Internalize the principles of Hangul characters: 'ㄱ' is the shape of the tongue root blocking the throat, 'ㄴ' is the shape of the tongue touching the gums. Check the structure inside your mouth in the mirror. Use visual materials like 90 Day Korean PDF to map letters and pronunciation organs.



Infinite Input: It doesn't matter if you don't know the meaning. Play Korean radio or podcasts for more than an hour a day like background music. Wait until the unique intonation and rhythm of Korean carve a path in the auditory cortex of your brain.



Use pronunciation apps: Eliminate the fear of opening your mouth with apps like Teuida. AI won't laugh at you even if you make mistakes hundreds of times



\[Step 2: 3\~6 months\] Into the Sea of Patterns and Context (Pattern Recognition)

Do not memorize grammar rules like math formulas. Language is a pattern.



Master verb conjugation: The core of Korean sentences is at the end (verb). Learn the patterns of ending changes like '-yo', '-seumnida', '-eoseo'.  



Shadowing: Choose a character from your favorite drama. Copy exactly the speed, breath, and emotion of their lines. Mimicking an actor's performance is the best way to swallow the context whole.



Forget word lists: Throw away flashcards with only words. Learn words in sentences. Words without context are dead data.



\[Step 3: 6 months\~\] Expansion of Self

Now it's time to express your thoughts and feelings in Korean.



Beyond survival to living: Go out and interact with real Koreans through HelloTalk, Tandem, or local communities like Culcom. ""The courage to make mistakes"" builds skill.



Understanding Sino-Korean words: To reach advanced vocabulary, grasp the concept of Sino-Korean words. Knowing 'hak (學)' is 'learning' leads to 'school', 'student', 'academy', 'study' like a string of sweet potatoes.  



Sublimation of fandom: Analyze your favorite K-Culture content and comment in Korean. Fandom activities are the most powerful language learning community.



Philosopher Wittgenstein said, ""The limits of my language mean the limits of my world."" Learning Hangul is not merely acquiring a new skill. It is the act of incorporating into your world the emotions of the Korean Peninsula with a 5,000-year history, King Sejong's spirit of love for the people, and the dynamic digital civilization of 2026.



Hangul is not perfect. Irregular pronunciations and complex honorifics will trouble you. But within that imperfection lies a human, all too human charm. The language of 'jeong' created by fragmented individuals longing for each other's warmth. In the era of cold AI and algorithms, Hangul may still be the last bastion of humanism with warm blood flowing.



You who are reading this now, do not be afraid and speak out. ""Annyeonghaseyo."" The resonance of those five short letters will open the door to a new world that will change your life.

Review: Clean retro casual vibes. The piping and the collar shape are nice. It gives off that ""Sunday morning coffee run"" energy. The only downside is the material looks a bit thin—might be see-through if you wear a dark t-shirt underneath. Also, same issue as the beanie: keeping this white clean is going to be a full-time job.

### 9. Air Jordan 5 Retro (Anthracite/Grey)

Verdict: 8.5/10
Review: Solid kicks. The suede looks like it has some life to it (movement), which is good. The stitching looks consistent. The AJ5 is a bulky shoe, so it’s tricky to style with skinny pants, but great with baggy cargos. The icy blue sole is fresh now but be prepared for it to yellow nicely over time. Can't go wrong with this colorway.

### 10. Stussy Tube Socks (3-Pack)

Verdict: 6/10
Review: Bro, they are socks. They look fine, logo is embroidered properly, but at the end of the day, they are just cotton tube socks. They’ll probably pill after two washes like most streetwear socks. Good for the ""socks and slides"" look, but don't expect life-changing comfort.",1,1767604666.0,rep,2,1.0,False
1q4h2xx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1q4h2xx/personal_struggling_with_acne_for_over_10_years/,[Personal] Struggling with acne for over 10 years feeling stuck and unsure what to try next,"Hi, I’m posting here because I honestly feel very stuck and don’t know what else to do.

I’ve been dealing with acne since middle school, and it’s been over 10 years now with no real break. My entire teenage years were spent feeling extremely insecure. While others could experiment with makeup or go out freely, I was hiding at home with a face full of acne, and over time I became more withdrawn and avoided social situations.

I’ve seen multiple dermatologists over the years. Usually I’d stay with each one for about two months. I’ve used many topical treatments and also took oral isotretinoin (Accutane) at one point, but unfortunately none of these led to lasting improvement.

Later, I tried salicylic acid chemical peels. They did help reduce symptoms temporarily, but they were very expensive for me, and after stopping (I did three sessions), my acne came back again.

At this point, I’ve become extremely restrictive with my diet. I avoid milk, sweets, coffee, cakes, basically anything I’m afraid might trigger acne. I’m currently using benzoyl peroxide and metronidazole gel on my own, but I still don’t feel like I have control over my skin.

I’m exhausted and honestly don’t know what direction to take anymore.

If anyone here has dealt with long-term, persistent acne and found something that finally helped (treatments, routines, things to discuss with a dermatologist), I’d really appreciate hearing your experience.",1,1767604643.0,SkincareAddiction,2,1.0,False
1q4h2ky,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelProperly/comments/1q4h2ky/mexico_city_travel_guide_things_to_do_food_travel/,"Mexico City Travel Guide - Things to do, Food & Travel Tips","Mexico City is big, busy, and full of contrasts — in the best possible way. Ancient ruins sit next to colonial buildings, world-class museums are everywhere, and some of the best food you’ll ever eat comes from both high-end restaurants and street-side taco stands. It’s one of those cities that feels intense at first, then incredibly rewarding once you settle into it.

What really makes Mexico City special is the **variety**. In a single day you can explore historic areas like Centro Histórico, wander leafy neighbourhoods such as Roma and Condesa, and end the night eating exceptionally well without needing to plan much. Museums, parks, markets, and galleries are spread throughout the city, so culture blends naturally into everyday life rather than feeling like a checklist.

The food alone is a reason to visit. Mexico City is widely considered one of the world’s great food destinations, and that reputation is well deserved. Whether it’s street tacos, bakeries, casual neighbourhood spots, or more refined meals, the quality and depth of the food scene consistently surprised us.

Despite its size, the city is also **more accessible than you might expect**. Many neighbourhoods are walkable, Uber is easy to use, and organised tours make it simple to visit major sights or take day trips like Teotihuacán. If you like cities that reward curiosity, good eating, and exploring at your own pace, Mexico City is hard to beat.

# Best Things to Do in Mexico City

**Explore Centro Histórico (Cathedral & Templo Mayor)**

Centro Histórico is the best place to start in Mexico City.  
It packs centuries of history into a relatively small, walkable area around the Zócalo and gives a clear sense of how the city grew from its Aztec roots into a colonial capital and modern megacity.

The **Metropolitan Cathedral** dominates the main square and is **free to enter**, making it an easy stop even if you’re short on time. Inside it’s surprisingly calm compared to the chaos outside, and worth a quick visit just to take in the scale.

Right next door is the **Templo Mayor**, the remains of the main temple of the Aztec city of Tenochtitlán. Entry is **$100 MXP**, and it’s one of the best examples of Mexico City’s layered history — ancient ruins sitting directly beneath modern buildings, with the cathedral looming in the background.

Centro Histórico is busy and intense, but it’s an essential stop and one of the quickest ways to understand Mexico City’s past before branching out to other neighbourhoods.

# Visit Chapultepec Park & Chapultepec Castle

Chapultepec Park is a great break from the city.  
It’s one of the largest urban parks in the world and completely **free to enter**, with plenty of shaded paths and open space if you need a pause from the busier parts of Mexico City.

The standout attraction is **Chapultepec Castle**, which sits on a hill overlooking the park. It’s the **only royal castle in the Americas**, and for about **$100 MXP** you get both a solid history lesson and some of the best views in the city. Even if museums aren’t usually your thing, this one is worth it for the setting alone.

Inside, the castle is well preserved, with grand rooms and murals that cover Mexico’s imperial and presidential past. Going earlier in the day helps avoid queues and gives you time to enjoy the grounds before it fills up.

Chapultepec is also easy to combine with nearby spots like the Museum of Anthropology, making this area one of the most efficient and rewarding parts of the city to explore.

# National Museum of Anthropology (Guided Visit Recommended)

The National Museum of Anthropology is a must in Mexico City.  
It’s one of the most important museums in the country and easily one of the most impressive we visited. Even before going inside, the scale and architecture stand out, especially the massive central courtyard with the iconic concrete umbrella fountain.

Inside, the museum covers Mexico’s pre-Hispanic civilisations in serious depth, with entire sections dedicated to the Aztecs, Maya, and other cultures. Highlights like the Aztec Sun Stone are incredible, but the museum is huge and can feel overwhelming if you don’t know what you’re looking at.

We did a **guided tour**, and it made a big difference — especially as **English speakers**. A lot of the detailed information is in Spanish with limited English, so having a guide helped bring the exhibits to life rather than just walking past impressive objects. Our guide, Leonardo, was excellent and added context and stories we’d have completely missed otherwise.

If you’re interested in Mexico’s history at all, the museum is worth your time — and if you want to actually understand what you’re seeing, an **English-speaking guided tour** is well worth it.

# Visit the Frida Kahlo Museum & Explore Coyoacán

**The Frida Kahlo Museum (Casa Azul) is worth planning ahead for.**  
It’s one of the most popular cultural stops in Mexico City, and for good reason. Visiting her childhood home gives a very personal look into her life, work, and relationship with Diego Rivera. Entry is timed and limited, and **tickets often sell out days in advance**, so this is one place you’ll want to **book ahead** if it’s on your list.

It’s well worth pairing the museum with time in **Coyoacán**, which feels completely different from central Mexico City. The area is quieter, greener, and more village-like, with colourful streets and relaxed plazas. The **Coyoacán Market** is a great stop for casual food or snacks and makes for an easy lunch after the museum.

Together, Casa Azul and Coyoacán make for a really balanced half-day — art, history, and neighbourhood life all in one.  
👉 [**Pre-Book the Frida Kahlo Museum Here.**](https://www.getyourguide.com/mexico-city-l194/mexico-city-frida-kahlo-museum-ticket-with-digital-guide-t425721/?partner_id=K1S6T5K&utm_medium=online_publisher)

# Experience Lucha Libre (An Unforgettable Night in Mexico City)

Seeing Lucha Libre live was one of our favourite nights in Mexico City.  
It’s easily one of the most entertaining and uniquely Mexican experiences you can have, and doing it as part of an organised evening made everything smoother.

We booked a **guided Lucha Libre night**, which kicked off with a **tequila tasting** and food at a local taco spot with the rest of the group. It was a great way to ease into the night, meet people, and get hyped before heading to the arena.

The match itself was unreal. The **energy inside the arena is wild** — locals are fully invested, shouting, cheering, and reacting to every dramatic move. Even if you don’t understand the rules, it doesn’t matter. The masks, characters, and over-the-top action make it impossible not to get swept up in it. It’s loud, chaotic, and ridiculously fun.

What really made the night work was how well it was organised. Not having to worry about tickets, transport, or where to eat meant we could just enjoy it. If you want a night out that shows a completely different side of Mexico City beyond museums and sightseeing, Lucha Libre is a must.

👉 [**If you want to do the same Lucha Libre night we did — tequila, tacos, and live wrestling — this is the tour we booked.**](https://www.getyourguide.com/mexico-city-l194/mexico-city-mexican-evening-lucha-libre-and-tequila-t1091374/?partner_id=K1S6T5K&utm_medium=online_publisher)

It was easily a highlight of our trip.

# Take a Full-Day Trip to Teotihuacán & Surrounding Sites

A day trip to Teotihuacán is absolutely worth it from Mexico City.  
It’s one of the most rewarding excursions you can do, and going with an organised tour makes the day far smoother — especially when multiple major sites are included.

We did a **guided full-day tour** that combined **Teotihuacán**, **Tlatelolco**, and the **Basilica of Guadalupe**, which gave much more context than just visiting the pyramids alone. At Teotihuacán, walking the Avenue of the Dead and seeing the Pyramid of the Sun and Moon is impressive on its own, but having a guide explain how the city once functioned made a big difference.

The extra stops helped round out the day. Tlatelolco highlights Mexico’s layered history, while the Basilica of Guadalupe is fascinating even if you’re not religious. Having transport and timing handled was a huge plus given the distances involved.

If you want to see Teotihuacán properly without dealing with logistics, this kind of full-day tour is a very efficient use of time.

👉 [**This is the tour we took if you want to check availability.**](https://www.getyourguide.com/mexico-city-l194/mexico-city-teotihuacan-tlatelolco-basilica-of-guadalupe-t958459/?partner_id=K1S6T5K&utm_medium=online_publisher)

One thing we **regretted not doing** was the **hot air balloon over Teotihuacán**. The site is incredible from the ground, but seeing the pyramids at sunrise from the air looks unreal — and it’s something we’ll definitely do next time we’re in Mexico City.  
👉 [**If you’re into once-in-a-lifetime experiences, the hot air balloon tour is worth a look.**](https://www.getyourguide.com/mexico-city-l194/cdmx-teotihuacan-balloon-flight-with-optional-pyramids-tour-t696822/?partner_id=K1S6T5K&utm_medium=online_publisher)

# Where to Eat in Mexico City (Restaurants, Tacos & Bakeries)

https://preview.redd.it/294cmbl6xhbg1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=fef6c8bdf6806a7bf41cf43eb3368acb961ab311

* Botánico
* Máximo Bistrot
* Café Madre
* El Beneficio Bistrot
* Órbita

This list barely scratches the surface, but it’s a solid starting point if you want to eat well across brunch, lunch, and dinner. Mexico City has an unreal food scene, and it’s one of those places where even casual meals can end up being highlights of the trip.

https://preview.redd.it/mkw8rbghxhbg1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=954aca850c0c53df4caf9a0717d57967dac042a6

# Best Bakeries & Pastry Shops in Mexico City

**Some bakeries we’d recommend in Mexico City:**

* Casa 1900
* Green Rhino
* Panadería Rosetta
* Pastelería Ideal
* Odette

If you like starting the day with good coffee and pastries, Mexico City won’t disappoint — and it’s easy to fit bakery stops in between sightseeing.

# Best Neighbourhoods to Stay in Mexico City

Where you stay in Mexico City really shapes your experience. Neighbourhoods feel very different in terms of walkability, food options, and overall vibe, so it’s worth choosing carefully.

We stayed along **Paseo de la Reforma**, which worked well as a **central base**. It was easy to get to **Centro Histórico** and across to **Roma** and **Condesa**, and transport links were solid. That said, if we were booking again, we’d stay **directly in Roma or Condesa** — both felt more walkable, had better food right outside the door, and just a nicer day-to-day atmosphere.

Reforma is still a practical choice if you want convenience, but Roma and Condesa are hard to beat if cafés, restaurants, and neighbourhood life are a priority.

**Where we stayed:**  
We stayed at **Barceló México Reforma**. It was **nice enough, comfortable, and well located** for sightseeing. Having a **spa and indoor pool** was a bonus after long days walking the city, and it worked well as a no-fuss base.

If you’re looking for a central hotel on Reforma with good amenities, it’s a solid option.  
👉 [**This is the hotel we stayed at if you want to check availability.**](https://expedia.com/affiliate/eYHV6G0)

# Mexico City Travel Tips

Mexico City is huge, but it’s easier to navigate than it looks. Our biggest tip: **use Uber**. It’s widely available, affordable, and removes any hassle around taxis or language barriers. For getting between neighbourhoods like **Roma, Condesa, Centro, and Reforma**, it was by far the easiest option.

Traffic can be heavy, especially during rush hour, so build in extra time if you have reservations or timed entries. Outside peak hours, moving around is straightforward. Walking also works well in Roma and Condesa, which are flat, lively, and easy to explore on foot.

Finally, pace yourself. Mexico City has a lot going on, and trying to do too much in one day can be exhausting. Slower mornings, long meals, and neighbourhood wandering make the experience far more enjoyable.

# Final Thoughts

Mexico City is a place that really rewards curiosity. It’s big, busy, and a bit overwhelming at first, but that’s part of what makes it so memorable. From places like Centro Histórico, Chapultepec Castle, and Teotihuacán to neighbourhoods such as Roma, Condesa, and Coyoacán, there’s an incredible mix of history, culture, and everyday life.

The food alone is a huge highlight. From street tacos and bakeries to brunch spots and standout restaurants, eating well becomes part of the daily routine rather than something you have to plan around. Even compared to other food-heavy destinations, Mexico City really stood out for us.

What also surprised us was how **easy the city is to experience with a bit of planning**. Uber works well, many neighbourhoods are walkable, and organised tours made it simple to visit places like Teotihuacán, museums, and Lucha Libre without worrying about logistics. If you’re willing to slow down, eat well, and mix sightseeing with neighbourhood time, Mexico City offers some of the most rewarding travel experiences we’ve had - and it’s somewhere we’d happily return to.

In college, I lived in a hostel room with three other girls for almost four years. Let’s call them A, B, and P. From early on, it was clear that A and B became best friends and didn’t really like P. I was on decent terms with all three, though I was closer to P since she could clearly feel the bias from A and B.

Important context: All four of us had separate social lives.

A and B shared a friend group

P had her own friends + boyfriend

I had my own friends

Our “roommate bond” mostly stayed inside the hostel room. We rarely hung out together outside it.

P also had a reputation for having attitude issues, which didn’t help her relationships with people in general.

Now the main issue. A got a job early, finished her credits, and left campus a semester before the rest of us. That left B, P, and me still waiting for jobs.

At this point:

B had no friends left on campus (everyone from her group had graduated)

P had her boyfriend and a couple of friends

I still had my friends around

So B started asking me to go on walks or grab coffee. It was honestly 25–30 minutes max, and since she was alone, I didn’t mind. It eventually became a daily thing. We did invite P a few times, or ran into her at the coffee place, but she mostly declined because that time was reserved for meeting her boyfriend. After a while, we stopped asking since she always said no and already had plans.P joined us maybe twice, but brought her boyfriend along which made things awkward because none of us knew him well and, frankly, we didn’t like him much. So most days, it was just me and B. After about three months, I got a job offer in another city and had to leave literally the next day. My last 24 hours were chaotic finishing formalities, meeting people, packing and B helped me through all of this. P didn’t congratulate me or really speak to me after I got the offer. She just came to say goodbye right before I left. Two days into my new city and job, P sent me a long essay saying I was a bad friend, that I excluded her, and that I shouldn’t have been friends with B without inviting her more.

I explained that:

\- We always had separate social lives

\- B started hanging out with me because she was alone

\- P was always welcome, but we assumed she wasn’t interested since she always chose to meet her boyfriend

\- If this bothered her, she could’ve spoken to me while we were on campus

This turned into a fight. She kept blaming me. She also started getting upset whenever she saw B talking to me on the phone, even though she never called or texted me unless she had issues with her boyfriend. Eventually, I told her not to involve me in this anymore. Later, I found out P had been back-bitching about me to a mutual friend, who told me because she ended up fighting with him too. After that, I cut her off completely. The backbiting itself wasn’t extreme, but combined with everything else, I had built up a lot of resentment.

I know P did some things wrong especially the back-bitching but if I’m being honest, I genuinely don’t know what I could’ve done differently at the time. I truly didn’t know she felt excluded, especially since she kept saying no and had other priorities.

So, AITAH for getting closer to B and not realizing P felt left out or was this just miscommunication and misplaced blame?",5,1767604372.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

1q4gyri,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q4gyri,Atom24 gold and qnt prime whey review,"I decided to buy a few different whey sachets recently just to test the taste before committing to a full pack. First up was the Atom 24 Gold Whey Protein in Chocolate flavor. It gives 24g of protein in a 31g serving, and you can grab a pack of 10 sachets for around ₹770, which is pretty convenient. The mixability is good, and the texture is decent—neither too thick nor too watery. The taste, however, is nothing special; it's just like any generic chocolate whey, very similar to Nakpro Chocolate. It’s definitely not even close to the MuscleBlaze Biozyme Chocolate (which is the GOAT), but thankfully, it is way better than the absolute abomination that is the Atom Chocolate Hazelnut flavor. I had zero digestion issues with it, so it's a solid choice if you prioritize convenience.

Next, I tried the QNT Prime Whey in Coffee flavor, which I got for about ₹75 a sachet. It offers 25g of protein in a 34.5g serving, though do note that this one isn't Trustified certified. The smell of the powder was actually really good, and both the mixability and texture were on point. Taste-wise, it reminds me exactly of that hot coffee you get from Nescafé dispenser machines. I found it slightly better than Nakpro Coffee and significantly better than the Nutrabay Coffee flavor. That said, if you are looking for that specific ""cold coffee"" shake taste, Avvatar Performance Whey is still the better option flavor-wise.

First thing I liked is how compact it is.

It fits neatly under the sink and does not eat up all the space. The tankless design was a big reason I chose it since there is no storage tank sitting there collecting stuff over time. Filter changes are super easy and feel similar to changing a fridge filter.

Installation was mostly straightforward.

The only thing to note is that it needs a power outlet under the sink. The actual setup of the unit itself was quick and simple with clear instructions. All the tubing is color coded so it is hard to mess up.

***Water quality is where this thing really shines.***

Our tap water had a noticeable chlorine smell before. After installing this system the water tastes clean and neutral. Coffee tastes better and even plain cold water is more enjoyable. The built in display showing TDS and filter status is actually useful and not just a gimmick.

Another big plus is the smart faucet.

The light ring makes it easy to know when filters are good or need replacing without guessing. Flow rate has been solid and filling a glass does not feel slow at all for an RO system.

Customer service deserves its own mention.

*Multiple times when people had small issues like leaks or filter problems Waterdrop support stepped in fast. They sent replacement parts filters and in some cases even full replacement units. Communication was quick and clear and they actually followed up to make sure things were fixed. That kind of support is rare.*

Any downsides. It does need power under the sink and sometimes certain filters can be temporarily out of stock. Neither was a deal breaker for me.

Overall I am genuinely happy with this Waterdrop RO system.

[**https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P1XFYJP**](https://water.listbuff.com/G3P600)

It feels well built the water quality improvement is obvious and the support team stands behind the product. If you are looking for a clean under sink reverse osmosis setup without dealing with a bulky tank this one has been worth it for me.",10,1767603887.0,u_Adjustabler,0,1.0,False

# Brewing Bliss: Nespresso vs. Dolce Gusto Machines

Torn between the rich crema of Nespresso and the versatile pods of Dolce Gusto? You're not alone. Both systems offer convenient, café-quality coffee at home, but they cater to slightly different tastes and preferences. Understanding their core differences is key to finding your perfect brew companion.

Nespresso machines are renowned for their espresso-centric approach. They use high-pressure extraction to produce a concentrated shot with a signature thick crema, perfect for sipping neat or crafting classic espresso-based drinks like lattes and cappuccinos. The focus here is on the quality and purity of the coffee itself, with a vast range of premium blends available.

Dolce Gusto, on the other hand, champions variety. Beyond espresso, its machines can whip up everything from frothy cappuccinos and macchiatos to chocolate drinks and even iced coffees, thanks to a wider array of pod types. This versatility makes it a fantastic choice for households with diverse coffee and beverage preferences.

*   **Nespresso:** Ideal for espresso purists and those who enjoy a focused coffee experience with exceptional crema.
*   **Dolce Gusto:** Perfect for families or individuals craving a wide range of hot and cold beverage options beyond traditional coffee.
*   **Pod Availability:** Nespresso offers a premium, albeit slightly more limited, range. Dolce Gusto boasts a broader selection, including non-coffee drinks.

1q4gufm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/1q4gufm/how_to_make_the_right_decision_for_my_helpless_dad/,"How to make the ""right"" decision for my helpless dad","ETA, tl,dr: sorry for the WALL of text. Need help deciding (for 67M, very weak) whether to try methotrexate or go straight to hospice for cancer that has not reacted to any treatment so far. Thank you

My dad (67) was diagnosed with oral (buccal) cancer in early spring last year. He had let the wound fester for 8-9 months before going to a specialist (don't do that), so it had spread to lymph already. He had robotic surgery around Easter, recovery from surgery itself went well except for eating. Very hard to open mouth, painful to chew, hard to swallow. I saw him in the summer (I live abroad). He was down about 50lbs, weak, but as a formerly obese man, he was at a ""healthy"" weight. We naively thought we just recover from there, maintain a healthy weight, and he'll be ok. Oral cancer's ""high"" survival rates also gave us this hope. 



He had radiation (Vital Beam) and chemo. Radiation caused phlegm and swelling, and the difficulty eating just continued to worsen. He took PET CTs in August and it was not clear. We moved to another chemo, continued through the fall, but it didn't show any improvement. My mom kept it very vague, she just said he still has a hard time eating. We paused chemo while figuring out the next steps.



I arrived again in beginning of November. My dad had a small hole on his neck. This is where the real awful begins. I've posted about this before so I want to keep it brief. But the hole was necrosis of his skin caused by cancer, but also obviously not helped by radiation. At first it was just one hole on the left side of his neck, carotid vein exposed. Then another one behind his ear, and they kept coming, and now his entire neck is like Swiss cheese. Some holes like the initial big one goes DEEP, the tissue is gone too, and it's connected as a hollow tunnel through another hole in the front of his neck. The others are shallow, but some are bleeding. I can't describe how awful this is. I don't know anyone else that this is happening to. I didn't know cancer can literally melt your skin and tissue off. It's horrific. I can't understand why this has to happen to MY dad, of all people. I know it's not right to think like this, but I just can't believe, like, why him? Why us? Why can't he just have ""normal"" symptoms?



Through it all he has been eating less and less. Just before I left in early December, he stopped being able to swallow almost completely. After I left, he was hospitalized for malnutrition and stayed for 18 days, came home on Christmas eve, then again hospitalized 3 days later for pneumonia, caused by his inability to swallow correctly and liquids going where it shouldn't. When he was formally banned from eating and drinking, THEN he was hungry, begging for food. But then now that he's encouraged to try eating again, it's SO difficult, he just coughs up whatever he tries to swallow. Now he's down to about 100lbs on his GOOD days. He literally has not had a proper meal since last Easter. It's so painful to see. 



Unbelievably, he's still ""robust"" enough to want to kick and punch my mom, my sisters, and nurses through his delirium. Plus he pulls out his oxygen cord and scratches his necrotic wounds (VERY bad, infection could mean sepsis). But when he is not delirious, he still calls me on video chat, and blows me kisses, nods when I ask if he misses me (he's not very verbal anymore). He wants to watch stuff on his phone, still makes a joke or two when he can. So in a way he's still very much ""with"" us, and continuing to fight.



But today we got the results from his latest PET CT. Cancer is pretty much back to where it was before ANY treatment, and it's getting close to his cervical spine. So there is my beloved dad, with a neck that looks like a war zone, with oxygen, surviving on IV ""food"" and water, bedridden, cathetered and diapered, frail and underweight, body ravaged by chemo and radiation with nothing to show for it. He also has a black eye and a fractured hip from a recent fall, from the one time he tried to walk on his own when my mom looked away for 10 seconds to pour a coffee.



Right now the priority is clearing pneumonia, but after that we have to decide what to do. Doctor said we can try methotrexate, but apparently it's very high-risk. The other option is hospice, which one of his 3 oncologists have been pushing for since November. In a way I feel like we all know what's the right thing to do, but it's so painful to give up the fight he's been fighting SO hard. I think about him on video call using what little energy has has to lift up his arms over his head to make a heart for me, and think, how can we let him go? But at the same time, how many awful treatments should we subject him to when it's clear he's suffering so much?



The other difficult decision is when to go to Korea again. I have been unemployed for quite some time now, and in the past months I haven't been able to focus on getting a new job because having to travel again for my dad seems so... imminent. So the mounting costs of travel while not having an income is pretty brutal also. But I'm not sure if I can handle the thought of not seeing my dad again before he goes. Of course there's still the tiniest chance methotrexate will work and we can still make good, new memories with my dad, but it seems foolish to have that hope.



Again like many posts here, not sure what is the point of this post, but I would love any insights or experiences regarding methotrexate, or how you knew it was time for your loved one to go to hospice. The decision paralysis is so difficult and sad. Thanks for reading everyone. Hope 2026 brings some good news to you all.",3,1767603735.0,CancerFamilySupport,1,1.0,False

Needless to say the breakup has destroyed my relationship with sleep and I've been losing myself in the process. I haven't cleaned my room or bathroom and I'm just a mess, new years eve I got very drunk and walked down the highway with cars driving past in the dark. 

Well, it's the 5th of January right now, exactly one month since she texted me ending 4 years with one message.... and somehow tonight I had the best night's sleep ever, I went to bed at 10pm but didn't get any sleep until 1am. I woke up at 8am feeling like I had the best night's sleep I have had in a long long time. And to top it all off when I looked out my window I saw snow!!! It hasn't snowed here in 4 years!!!!!!! I work from home so I get to sit inside with a blanket and coffee!!! 

I will get to cleaning my room and bathroom today, I'll make a nice brunch for myself as I still don't feel like breakfast. And tonight I'll go out in the snow to have fun in the snow!!!

I still have a long way to go on this healing journey! It's only been a month but today marks the exact day she left and it's as if all the stars aligned today to ensure I woke up happy.

H1B positions are by law **temporary**, and one reason for their temporality is for the employer to continue business until they find a U.S. Worker.

Further, it is 100% legal for American workers to negotiate with employers over salary and benefits, and undercut the price of foreign workers.

Remember, U.S. Workers: Employers are required to pay foreign workers ""Prevailing Wage"", and continue to pay them during downtime.

I go in the kitchen and what I thought was helping her get set up to pour some sparkling. I open a bottle and she bites my head off yet again yelling at me to be more aware of my surroundings that she said not to open the bottles. Now I was in a different room when this was said watching tv I did not hear her. I apologize and she keeps complaining so I get mad and celebrated new years crying. 

Fast forward 2 days. I ask her if she was upset with me or at something else and she says me. I ask why and she says. Becuase you didn't put water in the coffee maker and the bottles later that night just sent me over the edge. I apologized yet again saying I will do better at remembering. She tells me she poured all the water out one time into the dogs dish to make me see what it felt like to wake up to an empty coffee maker. 

Then she brings up something  that pissed me off more.

Back in November my family went to FL for Thanksgiving I stayed behind due to not having the money. I watched my sisters dogs. Two of the dogs got into this nasty fight. I WAS ALONE and if it wasnt for me breaking up the fight a dog would be dead right now. This was extremely traumatizing.

SO she brings up the dog fight. Saying if i was more aware I might have heard a dog growl and could have possibly stopped the fight and that it wasn't my fault and she wasn't blaming me. That was blaming me! Now mind you! There was nothing to even remotely hint at a fight starting no growling nothing they just went at it! That pissed me off. I did not say anything so we wouldn't fight. 

Then tonight! We went over a budget on the 2nd of jan and she just kept on hounding me and repeating herself so many times these past few days I was getting feed up with it. So I just said will you please stop telling me the same things over. I KNOW and I am already stressing enough without you adding to it.

This person that used to live with them didn't work didn't drive didn't help out didn't do anything. She went out with random men and would brag about it to my sister.

Demeter is pissed. She’s grounded for killing… something small, bloody and full of an unknown wood-shaving like material and dragging it into bed this morning.

Punishment? No library or cafe or laundromat today. The bubble backpack will stay by the door to mock her.

I’m going to finish my breakfast and head out but I had a thought. Remember twin peaks? That tv show on in the 1990s with Kyle Mc-something? He was also Paul from Dune. They had spooky shit and a saw mill too. However, I don’t think ours is owned by a smokeshow from Hong Kong. I don’t really know who owns it. Probably the Shriner family honestly. They own most of the town anyway.

**Sunday, August 10th, 6:00 pm**

Just me, my saffron latte and a basement of microfiche films against the world today. But I did learn a few things.

First, how to use microfiche.

Second, I was right. The mill is owned by the Shriner family. Specifically, it was owned by Franklin and their cousin Alan, the one who worked with Rooter on the mall deal. Both basically disappeared after the whole incident. It’s the only shared property in the family but it was divided weirdly. So the building, the equipment and the trees are all owned by Franklin. But the land itself is owned by Alan. He built the mall on a patch that had been clear cut by Franklin. They had a spat to put it nicely, and it got really ugly. When the mill burned, Franklin suspected Alan, but disappeared before anything really came out of it. When the family decided to push off the mall opening, Alan vanished too so they decided to keep it closed to save face.

So:

Mass hysteria ⭕️

Shriner family history ⭕️

The mill ⭕️

The mall opening that never happened ✔️

Ok, next, the mill itself. The saw mill was built in 1900, and was the first major job producer in the area. Built by Albiticus Shriner, who was a bit of a cornball to say the least. Despite being a heavily Catholic area surrounding his mill, he was a follower of Aleister Crowley. That’s right folks, the sexual deviant master of debauchery himself. Now, I don’t quite understand how he got into this, but after following the master of disaster’s teachings for a while he started his own church.

I know, I know, how on the nose. A cult founded small town. OooOOOooo

But when he started his own church, he started praying to the forest that surrounded the mill. He preached about a figure named Divicianna. He didn’t continue the sexual deviancy of Crowley, so he gets a few brownie points.

Divicianna blessed the woods to grow strong and fast as long as she was respected. Remember the other day when I said there’s something special about our lumber? It’s not the lumber, it’s the trees themselves. They’re related to red oak trees but they’ve mutated to grow to full height within ten years without sucking all the life out of the dirt. So, they’re constantly producing trees fit for lumber without absolutely nuking the forest.

Albiticus somehow knew these trees were special and decided to build his mill here. It was a small endeavor to begin with, basically a camp with 20 men and their families in tents. People settled in 1903 and our cozy little town was born.  Come 1910, the singular religious establishment was a one room church for Divicianna, built from her own trees. She is Divincianna. He paid for a statue to be built in bronze for her in the center of town. So that’s four more checked off our list and one added.

I did send a couple emails out while I was at the library too. One to an arborist, because of the trees. One to a Dendrologist, also because of the trees. One to a local historian, for various reasons. The final one I sent to a folklorist that specializes in lesser deities. Godbless Google man.

**Monday, August 11th, 3:23 am**

Someone was in my house.

I’m waiting outside for the police and Ian, Demeter is confused but content being asleep tucked in my robe.

I thought I was having a nightmare at first, but the shadowy remnants of those always disappear when I open my eyes. This one didn’t.

I was asleep on the couch after that old movie marathon they had airing last night, having my usual nightmare when something in my dream started to beg me to wake up. This gentle feminine voice was pleading that I needed to wake up, but be totally still or I was going to get hurt. Somehow, I managed to pull myself awake and do just that. I opened my eyes, but I stayed totally still. A black figure snuck past the couch by my feet and headed for my room. I heard them opening drawers and shuffling around for something. I pulled my phone out and lowered my brightness before they noticed. Or they didn’t respond to it I guess. I fired off a message to Ian, Cami, and Markus telling them to call the police, and there was someone in my room. Markus responded first with a thumbs up.

The intruder must have found what they were looking for, because as soon as I hid my phone again, they stepped out of my room and headed for the front door. They must of had a sense of humor because they tiptoed across the room like the pink panther, I could almost hear the music score. They slipped out the door as quickly as they came in, leaving black boot prints behind.

You can trace their every step from whatever powder was on their boots, but it never seems to get lighter. Like the powder was being wiped off as they stepped you know? They were just solid black.

I don’t know what they took. I don’t know who they are. I don’t know. There’s the sheriff now. Will update when I can.

Monday, August 11th, 12:00 pm

Nothing productive came out of the police. I wish I could be surprised but I’m too pissed to care. They dusted for prints, took some photos and collected some residue from the footprints.

Ian however, was more than helpful. I’m currently sitting on his couch actually. Demeter is in his window, yelling at his bird feeder.

He showed up about twenty minutes after the cops, still in his jammies and very disleveled. De and I crawled into his car, and I filled him in. He wasn’t exactly one with the earth, so I ended up repeating myself until he got it. Once he gained sentience, he offered me an assumed cigarette, and stepped out to talk to the cops. I don’t smoke, but I took it anyway and lit it. You know what’s funny though? Big, strong, basement ghost beating Ian smokes tea and weed packed into stuff-your-own-cigarettes tubes. Love that for him. I might buy some off him.

So he talks to the cops for a little while, then returns to the car and we pull out.

“We’ll head home, you and De can take my bed and in the morning we’ll go to the city and get some cameras and a new lock. How’s that sound?” He leans back in his seat, and holds out a hand to take my roll-your-own. I offer it to him and nod, glancing at De asleep in the back seat, all curled up in her carrier.

Don’t smoke and drive kids. Park, like a decent degenerate.

We pulled into his place, or his mom’s old place I should say and toddle inside. He and his mother lived in the renovated carriage house on the Shriner property and when he was old enough, he moved back in after she died. It’s a large apartment above a workshop basically, but it’s well kept and still more lux then half the high end apartments in Chicago. He takes Demeter so I can tackle the stairs, and cracks the crate open for her. She slithers out and looks around, knowing her buddy is around somewhere.

Ian keeps a huge pet rabbit, freestyling in his house. I’m talking massive. He’s a Flemish giant named Bruno, that’s litter trained and likes to follow De around like a pining lover. I’ve kept our big eared friend over the years when Ian goes on vacation, so we’re all well acquainted.

They greet each other, and I head off to Ian’s room to try and sleep, the fuzzbuckets both on my tail.

No matter how hard I tried and how tired I was, I didn’t really sleep. I’d nod off just far enough to start to dream and jerk awake, seeing that guy rummaging through my house and smelling rotted wood or swamp. Just something plantlike and decaying. When I heard Ian up and kicking around, I crawled out of bed. The critters were curled up together on the floor, Demeter snoring away as usual.

We had coffee and another roll-your-own in silence before he finally spoke up.

“Any more ghost pipe screams?” He ashes the joint, almost into his mug might I add.

“Nope… a little dust here and there though. Did the cops tell you anything?”

He shook his head and sighs, then offered it over. “Not a thing… but we’ll get cameras up in case they come back.”

I take a swig of my coffee, the thought of a return visit terrifying me. Instead, I decide to change the subject and nod to the joint in his hand. “When did this start?”

“Ah… at eighteen or so?… The car accident messed up my whole…” he waves a hand over his left shoulder, collarbone, neck and head. “So I spent a few years on antidepressants and pain pills but they got to be a problem… I was uh…  by sixteen, I was addicted to oxys… and I was a hellion about it. But those get to be pretty hard to come by in a small town. I moved onto cheaper…more readily available things…” He pushes his sleeve up, showing a handful of pinpoint scars up his forearm. “So… the Ol man notices some silver forks missing before a big gala… he sat me down and told me I’m either going to get my shit together, or I’m going to get out without a dime of my inheritance. I got combative, and after a brief…” he snorts and shakes his head, then takes a slow drawl off his joint. “Basically, he whopped my ass and told me I had five minutes to pack because I was either going to a rehab program or I was out on my ass. I took him up on the rehab. Spent six months in a treatment center and the day I was released, we get T-boned on the way home. I break my collarbone all over again. That one ends up in surgery, and I rawdogged recovery. Not even a Tylenol…”

At this point he moves his collar to show a neat little scar on his chest.

“That was miserable but I was so scared of getting bad again, I wasn’t risking it. Well… you know Mrs. Robichaux? Yeah, she came over one day to drop off something to the Ol man and she sees me. Without a word, she opens this little case in her purse and offers me one of these. Says there’s a little cannabis in it, but it’s more herbs than herb.” He ashes the rollie again and takes another pull. “Took the pain away… helped the swelling… allowed me to function…all the good things. So I’ve been buying from her for years now. The Ol’ man might now but he hasn’t said anything about my California sober lifestyle. I haven’t touched pills in seven years… I don’t drink… just this. Twice a day, as prescribed by Mrs. Robichaux.”

I raise my mug to him before finishing my coffee. He passes it off, and puts our mugs in the sink before tootling off down the hall without a word. A few moments pass before I hear the shower kick on.

I finish the last little bit of the joint before heading to the living room to wait.

My dear reader, at this moment I realized I couldn’t go with him to the hardware store unless he took me home first. I’m still in my pajamas. I can’t wear Blinky the fish boxers and a hole filled t-shirt to the hardware. My robe doesn’t pass for anything close to trench coat like.  I didn’t even have shoes. When I ran out of the house, I just grabbed Demeter and her carrier.

Ian however, was cool about letting me stay here while he ran errands if I’d feed Bruno for him when he got up. A fair deal right? I think that’s him pulling in now. I’ve gotta get De back in her carrier before we can leave.

Hybrid recipe.

- 15g coffee (Yirgacheffe moka)
- 250g water at 94 degrees Celsius.

- 14 clicks (Timemore C3S Pro)

- Flow rate: 8-10 g/s
- 30 seconds bloom with 50g water to degas the coffee and bring out the floral aromas.

- Extended immersion up to 2 minutes 45 seconds to extract as much sugar as possible and balance the natural acidity of the Ethiopian coffee.

- Gravity flow up to 4 minutes 10 seconds.

The grounds are ""sandy,"" so the water circulation seems good.
Almost no fines present.

One drawback: there's still a little coffee residue clinging to the sides of the filter. I still need to work on my pouring technique.

To try: water at 96 degrees Celsius to try and reduce the acidity a bit.

I will establish a consistent 6 AM - 8 AM morning routine for 60 consecutive days including exercise, journaling, and focused work to maximize productivity.

# SECTION B: BREAKDOWN OF STEPS

Days 1-15: Wake at 6 AM daily (no snooze), 20-minute workout, cold shower, 10-minute journal, coffee, 60-minute deep work session.  
Days 16-30: Refine routine timing, add gratitude practice to journal, optimize breakfast prep, protect deep work time (no email/Slack).  
Days 31-45: Maintain consistency on weekends too, track productivity metrics (tasks completed), notice energy level improvements.  
Days 46-60: Perfect the system, document benefits, create backup plan for travel/disruptions, commit to 90-day extension.

# SECTION C: EVIDENCE COLLECTION PLAN

1. Daily check-in photos — timestamped selfies at 6:05 AM showing wakeup time for all 60 days (can be compiled into video).
2. Workout app screenshots — Strava/Apple Fitness showing 60 morning workouts logged.
3. Journal entries — photos of handwritten journal (or digital screenshots) showing 60 daily entries.

Crispy roti for mopping up end of the curry was sublime. 

New staff still bedding in but no major issues with service.  Friendly as always. 

Even on a Monday night they were busy. Will be back to check out their new brunch menu  and coffees now that they are an all\_-day venu",8,1767601768.0,aucklandeats,1,0.91,False
1q4gbqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1q4gbqi/social_anxiety_widowed_and_christian_church/,"Social Anxiety, Widowed and Christian Church","I lost my husband to lung cancer in July 2025 two years after he had a double lung transplant.  He was my whole life for 27 years.  We did not have children, mostly because I lost my uterus and ovaries at a young age due to a health condition.  Before I met him, I suffered a lifetime of avoidant personality disorder and social anxiety disorder.  I did not grow up going to church and only really began to seek God and find Jesus when I met my husband, who was a Christian.  We did go to church together for a while but I struggled with it due to my anxiety and having some doubts.  I stopped going with him to church in 2016.  After his father passed away in 2020 I began to seek God again and around this time my husband became sick with interstitial lung disease from rheumatoid arthritis, becoming end stage by 2023 when he had his double lung transplant.  We watched the church service live on tv from 2020-2025 instead of attending church, mostly because of his lung disease, being oxygen machine dependent, and also the pandemic.  Later he became too sick with cancer and treatments post transplant to return to church.  But we had devotions together almost every night and watched the service on Sundays.  

Two days after he died I walked through the doors of the church we had watched online for years.  I felt such a need to connect with people somewhere as I have almost no family left, no children, and had just lost the love of my life.  I felt so completely alone.  No one there knew me because I had never actually been inside that church (the church we attended years ago together disbanded and merged with the new one).  I was TERRIFIED of walking into the church alone but the people there were extremely welcoming, especially after I explained my story.  I have gone out for coffee with a few of the members there, and met one other widow who is much older than I am (I am 53 she is 80).  Still it was hard and still is hard to go to church service and often sit alone, surrounded by families and couples all sitting together.  Sometimes my widowed friend sits with me but sometimes she doesn't make it in.  I thought joining a women's bible study group and attending Sunday school would help me get to know others and be more comfortable.  It has to an extent but I am still highly anxious when I come to church, and very self conscious.  Small talk does not come easy for me at all, and the meet and greet section of the worship service is impossibly hard for me.  I have not been able to pray in a group setting as I am so anxious words don't come to me.  In fact nothing about faith, worship, and sharing the Word comes easy for me, not having grown up in church and only reading the bible with my husband and praying with him and his family for a long time.

  
I feel that church life is very very challenging for those of us with social anxiety and lifelong shyness.  Almost every service involves interaction with others and communication.  Group discussions and prayer are difficult for me.  On top of this challenge is being single/widowed with no family.  Church is all about family, marriage, community.  Outside of church I work from home 40 hours per week and go days without talking to others.  I am feeling increasingly depressed and anxious while still grieving hard for my husband.  I went to a Griefshare group offered at another church for 13 weeks but that ended and I am finding I have so little support.  Even there it was hard to share but I didn't feel so alone in my grief.  I pray to God begging Him to help me overcome my fears, anxiety and awkwardness so I can be a part of this loving church community.  But I still have no idea how to begin to talk out loud in discussions, or offer up prayer, how to befriend people or just talk to them etc.  My mind goes blank.  I did once get up in front of the congregation and share thanks to God for carrying me through the ordeal of my husband's transplant out of state and then cancer and hospice and seeing him to the end.  That was the first and only time I have ever stood on a stage and spoke in a microphone and I was so nervous and so terrified I ended up battling hives for two solid weeks after.  Since then everything has been harder.  I had pushed myself to go to the groups and church every single week for months, but since the December holidays I have been starting to skip a group here and there or skip church.  I hurry out the door afterwards so no one sees me crying.  I cry a LOT.  I feel such a despair and sadness.  But also so much anxiety.  My life feels very different than it did when my love, my husband was here to support me.  I just want to isolate all the time because I feel so awkward, embarrassed and inadequate.  Church feels like a huge reminder of all that i am lacking.  The more I pray about it the worse it is.  I want to reach out to someone at church about it but I just can't seem to.  Everyone seems to be struggling with something or other and I am just a burden they don't need.  How will I ever be part of the church family and be more involved when I have struggled with a lifetime of social anxiety and shyness?  The more I push against my fears and try to get more involved, the more health problems start showing up because my body is so stressed.  How do I reconcile?  I feel so guilty for not doing more at church.  I have done little things, like giving people rides, giving financially to the church monthly and weekly, attending the groups, quietly praying for the church and individuals on my own, but my participation is dismal.  What can I possibly do, what role in the church, without it being so terribly difficult for me?  Why is it so hard to be part of a church family as a widow and single person?  So much is about couples and families.  How do I find my place?  I am on the brink of giving up but I have put my heart and soul into this church and I don't want to give up yet.  But I am slipping into a dark despair.  If you read this far thank you.  ",4,1767601750.0,TrueChristian,1,0.84,False

The town has an eerie vibe going on. Like something horrid happened, and no one wants to talk about it. But there’s no proof of it at all. The town is just as picture perfect as usual. The only proof I had of the mass hysteria, is my missing fingernail.

 I called Cami the next day and she didn’t answer. Markus did, but he had lost his voice so we ended the call and texted for a while. He was trying to help those that were seizing. He confirmed the black powdery nose situation. He said one victim had black powder coming from every hole in their face and it smelled like charcoal. Not like the bbq bricks soaked in lighter fluid, but the stuff they used to use in his grandpa’s stove as a kid. I didn’t know there was a difference. He tried to help a handful of people before he lost control and started towards the statue too. Then he blacked out like the rest of us. 

 Came to face down in a pile of soot with a wicked headache. He said he hasn’t heard from Cami either. 

When I opened the shop Monday, it was totally dead. No one came in to pick up money or drop off stock. I almost missed Karen. 

Her husband is home by the way, apparently he had a blockage in his neck that started to starve his brain of oxygen and made him hallucinate. They scraped out the blockage, hopped him up on blood thinners and vaso-somethings and maybe something for his anxiety for whatever he saw. Hopefully told him to cut back on the beer too. 

So, I cleaned and stocked. Even checked the old shelves for more secret buttons or hidden statues.

Rooter said he took the statue to the marble cutters and had it attached to Sara’s headstone. It feels a little macabre to me, but if it brings him comfort I guess. I should go take flowers one day. Rooter hasn’t dropped off any carvings since she disappeared but he’s been seen around town more often lately. He seems to be eating again, and looks like he’s showered but he’s still growing out the scuff. 

When I clocked out, I went upstairs to take a bath before figuring out the rest of my evening. Demeter toddled after me and sat on the edge of the tub like she usually does, trying to smack at bubbles with her amputated leg. We discussed our day, and decided on a dinner plan. Kibbles and gravy for her, rice and chicken gravy for me. Same same but different you know? So I climbed out of the tub and started to dry myself off, dodging the cat so I didn’t get fur stuck to my still wet legs, when something in that goddamn bathroom **moaned**. Not like a sexy, hot moan or anything but a deep, sorrowful moan. Demeter’s heckles raised and she started to do the Halloween cat walk away from the sink, keeping her eyes trained to it. I, having the survival instinct of a tadpole, grabbed the closest thing to me and started to walk towards the towel cabinet on the other side of the room. Armed with my plunger, I fully intended to beat the brakes off whoever was hiding in there. Can you predict what happens next? 

You’re right dear reader! Noone was hiding in my fucking closet! But something moaned again anyway! This time, Demeter swatted at the base of the sink and skittered out of the bathroom, yowling like she successfully slaughtered the sink monster. 

Despite being deaf as a doornail, she was right. That sound was coming from the pipes in the sink. I tightened my towel and shuffled over, armed with my plunger in case a hand started to reach out like in that Stephen King movie. I leaned over to look in the drain when it moaned again, a deep but pitiful sound rattled up the pipes followed by a puff of some sort of powder. The basin was covered in that powder but without my glasses on at the time, I couldn’t tell you what it was. By the time I found them it had dissolved and left the basin with a grey cast that washed away easy enough. Before I had a chance to see it again, I too skittered out of the bathroom and called Mr. Shriner. He said he’ll have Ian check it out when he stopped by the next day and left it at that. 

So, Tuesday morning comes around and I go about my morning. Demeter and I head down to the shop early, give everything a quick dusting and vaccuuming, then start counting the cash drawer for Ian. Demeter patiently waits in the window for him, her paw resting on the glass as she watches people pass by and coo at her. She loves the attention, and when the shop is open she usually draws people in. That’s why her bed is in the window after all. She gets attention, I might sell something, a win for all of us. 

Ian arrives at half past eight, looking rather chipper and refreshed after his little trip. He managed to avoid the incident in the plaza entirely for a concert, a goddamn Coldplay concert in Chicago. Lucky bastard. 

Anyway… he collects the money and tucks it in his backpack before pulling out a wrench. 

“The old man said you had something wrong with your sink?” He stands the wrench up in his hand and begins to balance it, wiggling his hand around to keep it steady. 

I can’t help but laugh, preparing myself for the impending assumption of insanity.

 “It moans.” 

I lean back on my stool, watching him lose his concentration as the wrench falls with a horrid bang on my counter. We both jumped at that, and he grabs the wrench, looking over the counter for any damage. He ended up denting the top, leaving a little crescent shaped scar behind. 

“…Your sink *moans*?” He crosses his arms, the wrench still in hand. I give him a rundown of what happened, and he seems pretty engrossed in it. When I get to the whole “Demeter hit the sink” bit, he jumps out of his skin. My comedic genius of a cat hops up from the floor and smacks the wrench in his hand, sick of waiting for her weekly dose of catnip. Ian screams and jumps away from the counter, dropping the wrench again. Demeter sits ever so sweetly at his feet and meows as if she didn’t just age this man twenty years. Once he gains the ability to breath again, he does manage a laugh and opens his pack to look for her dime bag. I did laugh at him, pretty hard too. Demeter is six pounds of fluff and doesn’t possess a gram of spookability in any of that. 

Once Demeter is squared away and wiggling in her window sill, Ian returns his attention back to me. 

“I’ll stop in after the shop closes and see what’s going on in the basement alright? I gotta get the key for the Ol’ Man and I’ll have to shut the water off while I check it out.” He stuffs the wrench back in his bag, then runs his hand over the counter again.

“I don’t think sewer ghosts care if the water is on or not. Do I need to fill a couple buckets to flush with or is this gonna be a quick fix?” I take a glance at the clock and begin to sort out the cash drawer to open for the day. 

I’ve never been in the basement. I usually forget it’s there. Shriner never gave me a key to it since he used it mostly for storage of family stuff. The back room of the shop is enough storage for stock, and I don’t own enough stuff to need storage space of my own so the basement is all Shriner family goodies. I’ve never needed anyone to go down there either but I assume that’s where the boiler and pump is. But for some reason, I’m a little curious this time around. 

“Maybe the Shriner family ghosts are banging on the pipes.” I snorted at the thought and pop the drawer back in the register. 

Ian straightens up just a little bit, and frowns. “Not funny Lo….” 

*Fuck, I forgot about his mom.* 

Mr. Shriner is Ian’s maternal uncle. His sister Cordelia had Ian at 20, and raised him alone until she passed. His father ran when he found out she was pregnant so she did the single mom thing for a while. She was *financially comfortable* as they say, so Ian wanted for naught as he grew up and Shriner was always around for a positive male role model. She passed away at 30, dying in a rather tragic road rage accident with Ian in the backseat. There’s a lot of talk that her death was retaliation for the mill exploding or the mall being built. Shriner took custody of Ian as soon as the death certificate was signed, and he was given his mom’s share of the family fortune as soon as he turned 21. 

I apologize and cringe a little, looking for some way to busy my hands. 

“Come by at seven and I’ll have an extra plate of dinner for you. Gnocchi sound good?” I attempt a peace offering, though I don’t know if he’s a pasta guy. Almost everyone is a pasta guy around here though. It’s the Midwest. We thrive on carbs. Thankfully, he relaxes a little and agrees, then leaves to do his rounds for the day. 

The day goes by swimmingly. A couple teenagers come in and check out the vintage clothes we have in the back of the shop, and one ended up buying this 1960s mod dress I put out at the beginning of the summer. It’ll fit her beautifully. I’ve seen her around and she loves vintage fashion. She wears a different decade every month and I adore her. Her mom owns the cafe here in town and whenever I have something cool in stock, I let her mom know when I go in for coffee. 

A group of older women come in around 4, and toodle around for a while. They were on a road trip and stopped in for the night, wanting to rest before continuing their big adventure. I suggested Tony’s for dinner, and gave them a coupon book for some other stores in town. Between the eight of them, I sold $700 worth of stuff so I think it was a fair trade. By the time they left, it was time to close shop and start dinner. 

Demeter takes her post on top of the fridge as I make dinner for Ian and I, occasionally throwing in an opinion. While the sauce thickens, I do a quick pickup and stop to listen to the sink just in case. No moaning, but there’s more of that powdery stuff stuck around the drain. Nice to know I’m not totally nuts I guess. 

Ian shows up at ten to seven, carrying a tool box and his stomach rumbling. 

“Sorry… ended up doing chores for Uncle Thomas over at the mall and worked through lunch. I don’t know why he makes me do maintenance there…” He sits down to take his shoes off. 

Thomas is Shriner’s brother. Their parents had 4 children. The oldest, Franklin disappeared around the time the Mill incident happened, then there’s my boss, Isaac, then Thomas, then Cordelia who was born a good 10 years after Isaac. Thomas was the one that pitched the mall originally and I guess it caused a riff in the family that never totally healed. 

“Lemon rosemary gnocchi with chicken.” I answer him before he even asks. I’ve cooked for Ian before, usually in the winters when he’s doing more maintenance on the Shriner properties and he always sniffs the air like a dog before he asks “What stinks? I better take it off your hands.” 

I know, I know, he makes jokes like a 45 year old dad. It’s endearing. 

So, he sits himself at the table and I make us a couple plates and we begin to eat. Demeter takes her spot at the chair opposite mine and watches, occasionally giving her opinion on whatever we’re discussing. 

Towards the end of the meal, it finally happens. The bathroom sink moans again and Ian heard it. He stops mid-fork-to-mouth, his eyes bugging out of his head. I can’t help but laugh in relief, knowing I’m not crazy. 

“I told you!” I cackle and set my fork down, turning towards the bathroom to hear better. 

Ian’s entire demeanor changes and he sets his fork down, looking for his boots and tool box. “Stay up here alright?” He sounds a little panicked as he starts pulling a boot on. “Call the Ol’ man if I don’t come back in… like thirty minutes. I’m gonna shut the water off, so don’t try to run the taps or flush until I come back. Ok?” 

I simply nodded and offered him his coat and tool box. He scurries out the door and down the steps. 

I set a timer on my phone, and walk towards the sink to see if I can hear anything important. Beyond some banging on the pipes, our sink ghost seems pretty appeased but I begin to get anxious as time ticks on. The whole situation feels weird, but I can’t really explain why. It just feels like such an extreme for some weird noise in the pipe. With five minutes left on the clock, the banging downstairs stops. The drain starts to gurgle, the sound rising up the pipes. I, being an idiot, stick my head in the bathroom to see what the hell is happening. That powder starts to bubble up through the drain for just a moment before it stops, then, like a goddamn oil rig, starts to spew a pressurized stream black powder all over my fucking bathroom. I screamed and shut the door, wanting to keep the mess in there in case it’s some sort of mold spore. For an extra measure, I rolled up the blanket on my couch and stuffed it under the door. Ian comes stomping up the stairs and pulls me away from the door. Panic begins to settle in my chest, remembering the chaos my last run in with this black shit caused. 

“It’s alright, it’s alright…. Just the Shriner family ghosts in the basement.” He wraps his arms around me and guides me to the kitchen. I thought that joke wasn’t cool but whatever, I didn’t particularly care. Ian however sounded way calmer then before. He plops me at the table, hands me the cat and heads back to the bathroom with my swiffer and a roll of paper towel. Demeter settles into me and purrs, watching as Ian disappears into the bathroom. 

He returns half an hour later, black smudges covering his arms and face, and a grocery bag full of dirty paper towels. 

I guess ultimately, someone cleaned their chimney and dumped all the ash and tar and stuff in the drain in front of their house. Since I’m hooked up to city water and sewer, it floated into my pump and got sent through my pipes. It caused a blockage that eventually cut loose and did the whole… geyser thing in my bathroom. 

Ian left a little while later, taking some of the pasta in a butter container for leftovers. 

I did a once over of the bathroom before bed and he did a really good job. Even dusted the top of the medicine cabinet for me. De and I tucked in, and I drifted off into a dreamless sleep. 

We woke up a little late, so breakfast was on the run as we set up for the day.  

Rooter stopped in today to pick up his check and drop off a pile of wood burned pieces. Most of them are drawings of animals or flowers, outdoorsy things you’d hang up in a cabin or a man cave but two really stuck out to me. One is a small round plaque with a drawing that matches the sigil on his ring and “Ash to Ash, Eye to Eye” in blocky letters. The other is a raw board, the bark still on the sides and all with an extremely detailed drawing of the statue in the center of town. These two he priced significantly cheaper then the rest. He bought a couple bottles of that new oil Karen brought and headed on his merry way to see his girls before work. 

The women from yesterday stopped in again, thanking me for the coupon book and buying a few more things they just couldn’t stop thinking about. I wish them safe travels and wave them off. They were lovely, I hope they enjoy themselves wherever they end up. 

Karen came to collect her purse, but didn’t say much beyond that, and blew out the door like her ass was on fire. Fine by me, but a thanks would have been nice. 

I closed shop, and made myself a quick dinner.  Now De and I are curled up on the couch for the night but I figured a very long update was in order. I’m gonna try to call Cami again and see if I can get a shower without a sink ghost interrupting me. ",2,1767601724.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

Case: you brew 300 ml of coffee. You drink 150 ml. What happens with the rest? Can you heat it up and drink it later? But coffee is best served fresh, right?",0,1767601264.0,AeroPress,5,0.5,False
1q4g5j9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q4g5j9,"Advice Needed: Dave Matthews Band Inspired Tattoo design I quickly made, hoping for some advice (check body text)","I am thinking about getting my first tattoo, and I want a slightly subtle but still noticeable DMB tattoo. Subtle as in, it’s not a super strange design to those unknowing of DMB. The “firedancer” is the symbol I printed on the moon. I love space imagery and I love the song “You Never Know”. It holds multiple great lyrics, some about the sun, the moon, spirituality, etc. but one of my favorite parts is “Out of the Darkness comes light, like a flash, you think you can, you think you can”. 


It paints this image in my mind of a solar eclipse, light peeking out, shining through as the moon seemingly slides past the sun slowly. I imagine this being more than just “solar flare” I think rainbows or colors in general. I was wondering if any of yall could share any advice about the idea of sort of turning their famous “Coffee Rings” symbol into an eclipse of some sort, one ring being the sun, and the other being the moon. And I’d like for the image of light reflecting past the darkness. Idk if this makes sense, but I thought yall would have good intentions!",0,1767601104.0,tattoos,1,0.33,False
