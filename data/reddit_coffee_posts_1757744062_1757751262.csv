1nfrv1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aging/comments/1nfrv1a/getting_old_hurts/,Getting old hurts,"My first memory with an older person was with her grandfather. I was about 5 years old and he was about 68 at the time. I remember being outside with him and having my bike with training wheels. It was about 1970.

I don't remember the exact conversation, but I remember that day he took the training wheels off of my bicycle. I remember riding my bicycle without training wheels and I was so excited!

I also remember my grandpa getting on the bike and riding it as I ran behind it. His knees reaches his elbows because the bicycle was so small to him. But I remember us laughing. A couple years later my grandfather died of congestive heart failure. They didn't know much about it back then. 

20/20 hindsight, I am almost the age my grandfather was at the time. I'm in a lot of pain. I have rheumatoid arthritis and CHF, congestive heart failure. I inherited these things from my mom's side of the family, my grandfather who knows how many generations before him. I don't know if my grandfather was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis but he had arthritis.

Looking back on that day, I'm realizing how much pain he must have been in. Anti-inflammatories and medication is not what it is today. Being born in the late 1800s he was real old school! So I know he was tough. I heard stories about him. But that's for a different post. I know he didn't take much of anything unless it was a home remedy. Perhaps some aspirin and Vicks nasal ointment. Funny little story, he used to put some Vicks in his coffee every morning and said that it's lubricated everything inside.

I mean, there's a few people that are older and don't suffer much pain. I have a friend like that. But you better believe that in the morning when he gets up everything hurts! It's a fact of life. But it's a fact that no one told me about. And I never really thought about it.

I remember being in my early 20s and my mom walking around really slow. She didn't complain much. I never really knew that had been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. I heard her mention it a few times and now I know the pain she was in.

Body aches and pains take away the enjoyment from getting older. I hope the reader never has to go through this. Although there's a lot of young people that are diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, it mostly manifest itself in your 30s and forties.

I have hereditary diseases, I could not have done anything to prevent it. But I try to live my life. Even though I do things a lot slower I don't let it stop me. I worked out all my life. I try to continue working out everyday and I haven't missed a workout yet. Although the intensity of the workouts has changed, I'm still pushing through!

I don't know where I'm going with all this haha. It's not really a rant. It's 4:00 in the morning because I started doing that thing that old man do, get up early for no reason. I hope you all have a great day and enjoy yourselves.

Today I was out shopping for some hiking gear and noticed how tough things seem to be for our locally owned shops who sell outdoor gear.

I overheard a convo with a customer in Gordon's Outdoor Equipment saying they only ordered two thirds of the sock they bought last winter because of the lack of sales. It seemed pretty sad, given they have some pretty great stuff (bought an awesome sleeping bag from them), and have super nice staff!

And then in the amazing Coffee Outdoors, not only did they make me the best cup of complementary coffee ever, but seemed almost relieved to make a sale.

I know things are tough for all of us right now, but with all the great hikes so close by would hate to see even more locally owned shops close down. So if you can give them a visit or even a sale if you need anything.",7,1757750350.0,Wellington,1,0.89,False

Ive used my 6 cups mokapot a lot of times now and it always worked. 

This week it seems to be less coffee comming out during normal procedures and now the top is only filled roughly half with coffee. The water container is also still  a little less then half full. During brewing there is no more coffee comming out but there is still too much water in the lower container. 

I put in a new seal and a new filter but it did not change it. I checked if steam or water came between the seal during brewing but could not find anything.

Last week I did buy new coffee medium roast at a shop where they also grind it when you buy the beans. They always ask for what method and grind it for the mokapot.

Now i am thinking that maybe this time they did not use the correct grind. (Maybe for this type of coffee bean)

Does anyone have the above experience and the problem was the coffee that was either too fine or too coarse? I would not know what else it could be as it always worked perfect before. I now brewed 3 times and the brewing doesnt finish normally anymore.

To add some more detail: the cofeegrind  in the basket is quite wet after there is no more water comming out, even though there is still plenty of water in the container. It is wetter than when the pot worked propperly.",1,1757750300.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

The house was given to me by my parents when they moved in with my grandparents in their much bigger house. Me and my boyfriend lived together in this house by ourselves for 2 years but it was also the house I grew up in. I came home one day, from taking my mom to the hospital after she broke her ankle, to see the entire back yard on fire. When I ran to the back the roof was already on fire and burning from the inside. We had just enough to get our beloved pets out that were thankfully kept on the other side of the house. The firefighters came and saved about 50% of the house. Since then I’ve lived with my parents again; also letting my dad be in charge of the insurance money to rebuild the house. It burned down to no fault of ours it was an attic fire. 

To say that fire messed me up would be putting it lightly. Every little thing with fire makes me extremely cautious and on high alert. I can’t leave the house without making sure everything is turned off. Leaving for days gives me horrible anxiety because I keep thinking what if the house is on fire. Going to work every day makes me stressed. I have to pace around multiple times before ever leaving just to make sure nothing could start a fire. The anxiety is terrible. 

Tonight I’m sitting here on high alert because the fire detectors in this house just went off 3 times back to back. I got my dad up and we both checked all over the house, in the attic, in the basement, and outside. No smoke no nothing. He said he just changed the batteries in one detector and left it laying on its side on a coat rack which might’ve set them off since they’re all connected and even though I spent an extra two hours pacing through the house and checked every single spot I could ever imagine I can’t calm down from it. I keep telling myself, “if there was a fire it would still be going off” yet I can’t stop worrying. I’m laying in my bed, my nose keeps paying tricks on me making me think I smell smoke which makes me get back up and check all over again, (something surely smells in my room which I believe is probably the coffee can I had left out which I have since thrown away, yet my mind keeps trying to convince me it might be smoke.)

I doubt anyone will be able to respond right away to ease my mind for tonight. I think I’ve accepted that I will just stay up until my dad is awake and then sleep while I know he’s inside to be the lookout. Thank god I don’t work tomorrow. Im just looking for any advice on how to think clearly when dealing with a trigger. I know my post is an absolute mess but that’s just how I feel right now..",1,1757750290.0,ptsd,1,1.0,False

The problem is my manager saw me do it and said to absolutely not do it bc it gives the coffee a  watery taste (which I didn't notice at all). 

I feel like it just makes sense that you should rinse out the old coffee inside throughout the day  rather than just at closing and I was wondering how other places are doing it/what the correct way is!",1,1757750024.0,barista,2,1.0,False

For anyone who hasn't met the Spook before, it is an NPC designed to punish macro and exploit abuse. If you stand in the exact same place for too long (a little less than 2 minutes) while killing killing mobs, a grim reaper NPC appears, the yellow text below flashes across the middle of your screen, and then the NPC 1-shots you after a few seconds.

Orbita (and other grind spots) are being deliberately designed with an auto-grind rest period. I like to grab a coffee, check the central market, load up another youtube vid, whatever. The fact that it is detected by the Spook and punished is.... clearly not intended.

1nfrm0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1nfrm0a/aio_for_considering_breaking_up_after_paying_for/,AIO for considering breaking up after paying for a majority of my booyfriend’s expenses and him barely acknowledging it?,"TLDR: My boyfriend has been lying to his parents about how much money to send for expenses at college because I’ve been covering most of them. He almost expects me to cover his expenses because he’s not as financially stable as me even though we’re both grad students. I’ve been uncomfortable with the setup but have had no problem covering things here and there because he deserved to be treated sometimes. It’s turned into me covering almost everything ($3000 within 6 months) and him having absolutely no issues with it. If this were a long term relationship, I’d consider this as an investment for our future together but he’s on a Visa and may not be able to secure a job by the time he graduates. 


I (21F) have been dating my boyfriend (23M) for about a year. We were friends first, then started dating, and moved into the same apartment a few months ago for logistical reasons. We’re both still grad students, but I work full time too and pay for my own tuition, rent, and expenses. He’s an international student whose parents send him money monthly, but he isn’t currently working (though he now can on campus). To his credit, on campus jobs are hard to come by.

From the beginning, he was very upfront that he didn’t have much money. I told him that I totally understood, and I never expected some kind of princess treatment. I made it clear I didn’t mind paying for things here and there, and I was trying to be a supportive, understanding girlfriend. When we originally started dating, we were also very honest with each other and he especially emphasized that he only wants something if it’s long term and that he dates to marry.

That said, over time I started to feel like the financial imbalance was a lot bigger than I’d realized or that I’d signed up for. He does help with chores (washing dishes, taking out the trash, etc.) and I genuinely appreciate that. We also have clean up days where I set aside time too and we tackle the living room together. I’ve also primarily cleaned the bathrooms right before showering whenever I can work up the energy. That being said, he does pick up a majority of the chores as I have a chronic illness and work/study 80 hours a week. However, he’s also adopted my schedule so we barely cook anymore, and we eat out most days, which means I’m now paying for groceries and the takeout we actually eat. When I was living alone, the reality would just be that I end up getting takeout most days and cook when I can on the weekends. Before we had moved in, my boyfriend did notice this and would invite me over for lunch/dinner at least 3 times a week to make sure I’ve eaten (again, I truly feel so lucky and appreciate him so much for how caring he is).

Now the real problem is that he also tells his parents that his expenses are super low (around $200 a month for groceries, dining out, activities, electricity, shopping, etc.) which only works because I’m covering the rest. For some context, we live in one of the top 10 most expensive cities in the US so it’s definitely hcol and high taxes. 

Last night, we had another conversation about money, and I brought up how I’ve been feeling. He still didn’t really acknowledge the imbalance and we came to the conclusion that his perspective on the reality of this situation is much different than mine because I actually see the numbers on my bank statement. We decided that it would benefit him to see how quickly a coffee run or an activity or a meal adds up. I finally went through my bank statements and calculated how much I’ve spent on “shared” or his expenses since March: over $3,000.

I had told him before that I thought it might be over $1k, but I didn’t expect it to be that high. I told him the number (without putting it on Splitwise which is what we use to share any costs), again not to make him feel bad, but because we had planned to figure it out. And when I told him? He basically shrugged and said:

“Okay yeah, we can just split everything 50/50 or Dutch from now on.”
And also added:
“Maybe calculating the number was a bad idea, now you’ll just hold resentment over me.”

That absolutely crushed me. I already felt so incredibly stupid for letting it get this far and now I’m being made to feel like tracking what I’ve spent on him is the problem, not the fact that I spent thousands on someone who didn’t notice or even offer to pay me back. To clarify, it has sort of been an unsaid rule that I’ll always be pulling out my card to pay and he wouldn’t even bother to take a look at the bill. 

He also told me once that he wouldn’t normally eat out or do any activities and he only does because I want to. But honestly, he almost always seems down, and he even suggests it quite frequently. And when I say “never mind, I’ll just eat at home,” he’ll come with me anyway, so I feel obligated to pay. I’m well aware that this “obligation” is something that people might thinking I’m bringing upon myself but he even hinted at the fact himself regarding how I’m the only reason he’s going out. 

Now he’s saying, “from now on we’ll go 50/50,” but he refuses to acknowledge the past expenses. He even said stuff like, “Well I do spend money on you too, but my numbers are just smaller than your numbers,” citing things like buying me coffee. As kind as it is for him to do so, a $6-7 coffee doesn’t compare to a $60-70 meal. 

The worst part is that I’ve recently been picking up on the fact that he likely has no plan for the future. When I ask what’s going to happen after he graduates this upcoming June (and his visa situation changes), he just says:

“Worst case, I’ll pack up and leave the country. What can I do if the current job market is rough for anyone on a visa? I can’t plan for anything right now”
That makes me feel like this relationship,
and everything I’ve invested, may just have an expiration date for him. It’s making me question whether he truly cares or if he just rationalized that it wouldn’t be so terrible to have to do a couple of chores if most of his personal expenses are being funded by someone. I know I might be overthinking this but at the end of the day, no matter how much he cares and fights for us, the logistics simply get in the way of our relationship if he does end up having to move back home. 

I’ve tried to be understanding and only brought up the finances topic anytime it felt like I was truly living paycheck to paycheck. I didn’t want to make money a big issue since we’re both in college but even when we’ve had discussions and I’ve brought up that I’m uncomfortable with the situation, the conversation goes nowhere because he seems to get sad/upset and I don’t want to make him feel bad. But after realizing the total amount I’ve spent, and how indifferent he seemed, I can’t stop thinking about it. And to be perfectly honest, there were times where I was really sad that I always had to drive us around and pay for every single thing or that he’s barely taken me out on dates in the past year. It gets really hard not to compare when I see how different the “bare minimum” is for some of my girlfriends. It also makes me sick to think about how he’s fully aware of the split between how much his parents fund his life vs. me and he is absolutely fine with it. I’ve never felt any sense of discomfort with me paying so much or guilt from him…

Am I overreacting for feeling hurt and resentful after calculating everything and finding out that he is perfectly okay with calling it quits once he graduates? ",2,1757749724.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

Kou slowly opened his eyes, finding Nazuna still beside him — their hands still holding each other.

He carefully let go, making sure not to wake her, and went to the bathroom to wash up, brush his teeth, and take a shower. After getting dressed, he walked past the room where Nazuna was sleeping and stopped for a second.

**Kou (to himself):** *“She’s really beautiful while sleeping.”*

He smiled quietly and went to the kitchen, pulled a canned coffee from the fridge, and sat at the table, sipping while scrolling on his phone.

After a few minutes, Nazuna also woke up and wandered into the kitchen.

**Kou:** “Good morning.”  
**Nazuna (sleepy):** “G-Good morning…”

**Nazuna:** “Whatcha doing?”  
**Kou:** “Nothing…”

Nazuna narrowed her eyes suspiciously but walked off toward the bathroom. When she came back, she was wearing Kou’s hoodie over her usual clothes, her hair hanging loose.

Kou glanced at her, blushed instantly, and snapped his eyes back to his phone.

**Nazuna:** “What?”  
**Kou:** “N-Nothing…”

Nazuna suddenly realized why, and burst into laughter.

**Nazuna:** “Still the same sensitive boy!”

**Kou (flustered):** “N-No!”

She leaned closer, kissed his cheek, and teased:  
**Nazuna:** “Good morning, sweetheart!”

Kou turned bright red, but before she could pull away, he grabbed her shoulder, leaned in, and kissed her cheek back.

**Kou (blushing hard):** “Good morning… too.”

Now Nazuna was the one who blushed and retreated out to the balcony in silence. Kou followed with his coffee and set his phone down on the little table there.

**Kou:** “Soo… you know, we could go ask Detective Lady for help?”

He expected Nazuna to roll her eyes, but instead—  
**Nazuna:** “Good idea.”

**Kou (surprised):** “Really? Then… let’s go right now!”

He grabbed his piercer, jumped from the balcony, and glided down. For a second, he thought Nazuna hadn’t followed, but then she came leaping after him — holding *his coffee*.

**Nazuna:** “Kou, you forgot this.”  
**Kou (grinning):** “Oh, thank you!”

They flew toward Anko’s office, landed out of sight, and walked down the street to the entrance.

**Kou:** “Hi, miss me?”  
**Anko:** “Not even a little bit.”

Nazuna peeked from behind Kou, then suddenly jumped out.  
**Nazuna:** “HII!!!”

Anko froze, shocked.  
**Anko:** “I… I missed you! I thought you were dead! And Kou— I never thought you’d actually find her!”

**Kou (offended):** “HEY!”

Nazuna and Anko both laughed, while Kou just scowled.

**Kou:** “Alright, enough! We’re here to tell you the theory.”

They all sat down, and Nazuna laid it out: the vampire rule, Kou’s half-vampire state, and the possibility of avoiding the curse.

Anko was stunned.  
**Anko:** “That’s… possible. I think it could actually work. But wait— Kou isn’t in love with you, right?”

Kou and Nazuna glanced at each other, both blushing.  
**Kou:** “Well… about that. I *am* in love with her.”

They both turned red as tomatoes.

Anko just stared for a second—then burst out laughing.

**Nazuna & Kou (at the same time):** “WHAT’S SO FUNNY?!”  
**Anko (between laughs):** “N-nothing, nothing!”

Kou leaned forward seriously.  
**Kou:** “Anko… I can’t be your assistant anymore. I need to train. Hard.”  
**Anko:** “And who’s gonna train you?”

Kou’s eyes flicked to Nazuna.  
**Kou:** “Nazuna will. She’s an experienced vampire, and I’m nowhere near her level.”

Nazuna blinked, caught off guard, her cheeks pink.  
**Nazuna:** “Y-Yeah… I could train you.”

**Anko:** “Alright. So you’re resigning?”  
**Kou:** “Correct.”

They stood, said their goodbyes, and left. For a while, they walked in silence until Nazuna finally spoke.

**Nazuna:** “You know… I could actually train you.”  
**Kou:** “I know. Tonight, you’re training me.”  
**Nazuna:** “Got it.”

When they got home, Kou opened his freezer—modified to store blood packs—pulled one out, and handed it to her.

**Kou (teasing):** “Here, so you don’t starve.”

Nazuna sighed softly, but this time didn’t fight it. She opened the pack and drank right away.

**Kou:** “Just so you know—there’ll always be blood packs in there. Don’t starve yourself. It puts *both* of us in danger.”

Nazuna nodded quietly.

Kou stretched, exhausted.  
**Kou:** “I’m going to bed. I’m tired of flying.”  
**Nazuna:** “Well… when I think about it, I’m actually tired too.”

1nfre8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/sciencefiction/comments/1nfre8z/the_marked/,The Marked,"Every city flushed its secrets into the sewers, and in those dark streams the state read the margins of possibility.

Not with prophecy—sewage was anonymous by design—but with signal. Pooled PCR panels, deployed after the last pandemic, scanned for viral genomes; someone had quietly repurposed their probes. They trained assays to pick up faint constellations of single-nucleotide variants, methylation dips, chromatin signatures—high-dimensional fingerprints that, when aggregated across neighborhoods, painted a probabilistic map of cognitive architectures. The assays could not point to a person. They could point to a block. A postal code. A river of human habitation where the pattern surfaced too often to be coincidence.

That was the first thing Kristina noticed: not individual names in a lab report, but a rhythm of recurrence. She had been spooling through municipal sequencing data for an unrelated epidemiological model when a motif kept surfacing in the pooled reads—subtle, recurring, and consistent across continents.

She called Saira and Xiang at two in the morning. The three of them met in the lab the way conspirators meet over coffee: conspirators with grant funding and clearance, three minds accustomed to mapping complexity into tidy graphs. Kristina fed the trace through her filters, and the pattern resolved: not a gene, not an allele, but an architecture—a lattice of variants and epigenetic states that, together, predisposed neural development toward dense cross-domain connectivity.

Saira, who had spent half her life translating molecular noise into language, stared until the lab lights blurred. She had lived with two realities since she was a child—the public one, where she taught and published and tied her hair into a functional knot; and a private one threaded by whispers and shapes on the edge of perception, a life the word schizophrenia had tried to quiet. Xiang had always met both of them without blinking. He did the geometry of things: a set of parameters, a map, a stabilizing transformation.

“This is a population signal,” Kristina said. “It tells you where to look, not whom to look at. But look you can. Census data, traffic pattern overlays, electricity use—blend these and you get a very small set of households.”

Saira’s breath shortened. “Which means?”

“Which means the state doesn’t need a name to make a list.” Kristina’s voice was flat. “They map neighborhoods with high fingerprint density, then use administrative metadata to narrow. That’s how oligarchs and governments with resources already operate: layer every dataset you can access until the shadows resolve into a silhouette.”

They mapped the infrastructures that would do that layering—credit card transactions, satellite thermal imaging, work and school records, health insurance claims. Put enough slices together and the anonymous becomes a dossier. Pooled PCR told a government where an extraordinary mind might be. Everything else told them who.

The three of them slept less after that night. The project—it felt wrong to call it a discovery—was too vast for the small lab’s ethics board. It had been named and shelved decades earlier in a different language: Project Chimera, Kristina found in brittle, redacted records. The archival memo spoke obliquely of ""anomalous human markers"" and ""resilience profiles."" Someone had thought them useful, then too dangerous. The physical files had been buried. The pipelines, however, had been integrated into public health.

The danger, they agreed, was not simply that someone might seize their findings. The danger was that the finding—the architecture of exceptional cognition—was a lever. An oligarchy that already used data to govern preference and profit could turn a map of minds into maps of influence, recruitment, and control.

Saira read the math Xiang sketched on a whiteboard. He drawn manifolds of gene expression against developmental time, nodes where feedback loops of methylation and transcription factor concentration coalesced into high-connectivity neural hubs. She saw the biology behind the curves: a narrow corridor of signaling and timing where cortical circuits would favor associative superhubs—the sort of architecture that produced metaphor-rich, integrative thinking. She also saw the other side of the coin: under different metabolic regimes or stressors, the same topology could flip into dysregulation, psychosis, mood lability.

“It’s not a genius gene,” she said. “It’s a developmental program—an attractor in an epigenetic landscape. The same parameters that give you associative agility also lower the margin to instability.”

“And those parameters,” Xiang breathed, “touch pathways implicated in cell cycle, DNA repair, senescence. The same regulatory motifs show up in stem-cell niche maintenance. If you can modulate the context—nutrient sensing, chromatin remodeling, microenvironment—you might steer the attractor away from fragility.”

The kind of sentence that reads like myth in a press release—the cipher that gives genius also unlocks longevity and regeneration—felt, in the flickering lab light, like an equation that begged to be tested.

They began with a containment ethic: no public posting, no cross-campus seminars. They used the anonymized sewage reads to find areas of interest, then worked with a municipal scientist who could, with a wink, provide de-identified metadata on utility consumption and travel flows. They developed models that could narrow a census tract into a handful of households. They were not the first, they realized, because the surveillance infrastructure had already been used—slowly, quietly—to flag and catalog people whose life courses deviated toward extraordinary influence or danger.

You cannot keep a pattern secret. A leak came two months in: a discreet query into one of their lab accounts, IPs that resolved to intelligence contractors. Their logs were clean; the query spoofed municipal access. A message arrived on Kristina’s personal device—no sender, just a string of characters and a single sentence: *We are aware.*

That was the first direct acknowledgment that the map had not only existed; it had been read. The oligarchs kept lists. Governments kept lists. Lists turned to policy. Policy turned to pressure.

They could have run, dissolved the network and their careers into anonymity. But running was an admission of vulnerability; retreat gave power to the very people who would weaponize the knowledge. Instead they chose a different peril: to make something the state could not easily touch.

Kristina framed the idea in terms she loved. “Compressed sensing,” she said. “You can reconstruct a high-dimensional signal from a few projections if you have the right basis. What if minds with similarly structured neural manifolds shared hidden bases? We don’t transmit. We resonate. We index.”

Xiang translated that into topological language. “The footprint we found in sewage is a projection of neural geometry into population dynamics. If two brains instantiate similar manifolds—similar eigenmodes of connectivity—you can define a cryptographic mapping between them. The mapping needn’t emit anything measurable externally. It’s intrinsic to the rhythm of thought patterns.”

Saira, who had learned to live amid whispering internal landscapes, did the rest. Sitting with silence practiced like an instrument, she learned to shift attention into precise temporal motifs—micro-rhythms of recall and imagery that were as idiosyncratic as a fingerprint but stable enough for repetition. She trained herself to produce a thought-pattern not by forcing content but by shaping attention’s timing: a short surge of imagery, a count of heartbeat-like intervals, a quiet recall of a particular scent. It was like whistling a tune only certain ears could recognize.

They built no transmitter. Instead, Kristina wrote algorithms to translate a pattern of neural motifs into a compact index. Those indices, when known to another mind with the right manifold, resonated. The effect was not mind-reading. It was a handshake: a small, anonymous confirmation that both parties shared compatible internal geometry.

The first return came from a name neither of them knew: Ananya Sharma, a data scientist in Bengaluru. It arrived as a singular thought inside Saira’s head during an experiment—clear, bright, and unwritten: *I hear you.* Saira nearly toppled from the chair. She felt the echo as an answering rhythm. When she closed her eyes she could sense a pattern of attention mirrored back: efficient, direct, like the mental hand of a statistician.

They spoke without words for the first time. Not sentences, but vectors of attention that implied consent, curiosity, and an offer of connection. Within days others joined: a materials scientist in São Paulo who sent an image of a layered polymer, a cognitive engineer in Seoul who answered with a precise timing count, a schematic of a strange device from Berlin. It spread not as a broadcast but as a chain of recognitions—closed loops of minds finding compatible manifolds.

For a moment the world narrowed to incredible human clarity. They had created, by the force of intellect and attention, a network that left no electromagnetic trace. It could not be gleaned from sewage reads or tax records. It was a fabric woven from the interior life, and that interior was its defense.

That did not mean it was safe.

Countermeasures arrived fast and clever. Not from a single government but from a coalition of interests: states with surveillance apparatuses and oligarchic actors who invested in influence-anywhere. Their first approach was the human one. Files of family ties, travel itineraries, employment records—those were the low-friction levers. The oligarchs had spent generations compiling dossiers; they knew where warmth lived. A cousin in a small town took a job that generated a biometric entry. A sibling missed a passport renewal that flagged a three-letter database. The network’s footprints in the world—bank transfers for supplies, recurring hotel stays for clandestine meetings, even a vendor with a municipal contract—were the weak seams.

When the pressure escalated to detentions, the three of them experienced a constriction the math could not solve. Xiang’s parents were questioned at customs. Kristina’s archive contact vanished. Saira’s sister received a menacingly banal letter from an investment firm: “Discretion is advised.” Fear is a slippery variable. It recalibrates risk in milliseconds.

Julian Door entered their periphery like a winter wind. Not young, not sentimental, and immensely practiced in self-preservation, he had lived long enough to know networks and survive by prediction. He offered them something they did not want and could not ignore: experience. He counseled restraint and chess-like moves to avoid predictable emotion. He also offered logistics—the sort of old-money legal layers and offshore contacts that turned panic into time.

They used the time to build defenses of a different type. They taught each other mental hygiene: habits that functioned like encryption—attentional signatures that could be altered in predictable ways, cognitive pocket spaces that nested protections around salient motifs. Xiang formalized these as Lie-group invariants; Kristina designed stochastic rehearsal protocols that would, with practice, reshuffle indices in a way only known to those who practiced with them. Saira, quiet and fierce, learned to fold her schizophrenia into discipline—an attunement that allowed her to find stable eigenmodes under cognitive attack.

When the state escalated from family pressure to direct canvassing, when anonymous cars drove past apartments and municipal lab access logs revealed attempted queries, they did not panic. They dispersed. Safe houses. Passenger manifests rewritten. Legal teams set to work. The network which had been a thing of attention became also a diaspora of safe labs and sanctuaries. What they hid, they protected.

In the drawer of a locked room in a city that took nothing seriously, they returned to the equations. Saira and Xiang worked with a modest suite of organoid cultures and cellular models, not to conjure immortality but to map control parameters in the developmental landscape. They looked at telomere attrition curves and methylation entropy, at mTOR signaling thresholds and the kinetics of chromatin remodelers. Their studies were not miraculous: no elixir, no reversal of death. But they found levers that shifted probabilities. Intermittent, timed modulation of nutrient-sensing pathways combined with targeted epigenetic editing in stem-cell niches altered the basin of attraction. Cells were more likely to repair than to senesce; tissue regeneration parameters improved marginally but meaningfully across models. It was the long game—incremental adjustments in phase space, each tiny improvement a step away from fragility.

They whispered about ethics more than method. Handheld devices recorded their debates and self-critique. They refused to hand their work to a central authority for fear it would become a program of augmentation for the privileged and a program of culling for the inconvenient. Stewardship, not secrecy alone, became their creed: share methods with decentralized labs, build legal and social buffers, spread capability in ways that made hoarding impossible.

Years would pass. They would suffer losses and small victories. Friends would be detained and later released; an ally would leak a dataset that softened the state's ability to triangulate. A municipal official would be quietly removed from office after refusing a bribe. They were not revolutionaries with banners; they were custodians with code and conscience.

On a late afternoon, when sunlight slanted through the lab’s blinds and dust motes moved like slow syntax in the air, Saira watched a young trainee pipette a sample with shaking hands. The girl’s tremor was familiar—an index of ideas arriving too quickly—and Saira felt a soft, almost maternal gladness. They had not given the world a mythic immortality. They had given it something harder and truer: the possibility of slightly longer, slightly better-lived lives, under the stewardship of a network that had chosen to protect rather than to weaponize.

They kept talking, in rhythms and indices, in the quiet places where the oligarchs could not listen. In the hush between their minds they debated how to release their work—open it and trust humanity’s messy goodness, or baffle the world just long enough to seed enough centers of capability that no single power could co-opt it. The choice was no longer purely theirs. Reputation, fear, politics—these things circled like gaunt birds.

Saira thought of her sister’s pillow notes, the small, stubborn anchors of love that had taught her the meaning of care. She thought of Xiang’s hands when they had first learned to steady her panic: the simple, practical math of presence. She thought of Kristina, who kept seeing patterns where others saw only noise.

Outside, the city flushed its secrets into the pipes. Inside, a small, anxious, brilliant network listened to one another and learned to answer with care. They had found a way to speak without being heard, and a way to tune a dangerous architecture toward resilience. It was not salvation. It was covenant.

At the end of the afternoon, Saira closed her eyes and reached toward Xiang across the room. He returned the thought in the familiar index—a small, private pattern that said nothing and everything. For a moment the world narrowed to a single, steady point of resonance.

They had a map, yes. They had enemies, yes. But also a new kind of refuge: the possibility that ingenuity, when stewarded by tenderness instead of fear, could change not just who survived, but how they lived. In the silence between their minds they felt the shape of that possibility—a cipher within, no longer merely secret, but finally carrying an obligation.",0,1757748906.0,sciencefiction,0,0.5,False

I recently joined this sub. For context I was admitted in hospital back in July 2021 when my blood sugar was found to be 680ish. I was 14 back then. Been doing good lately, however; I have a couple of questions which would help be decrease my a1c. It was 10.8 a couple of months ago.

1) How do I decrease my fasting b.s? it's mostly upwards of 220s, sometimes 300. I recently started eating my dinner early, around 7:30ish but it's never around the same time, always fluctuating, sometimes as late as 9. (P.S this is normal in my country lmao, my parents are rather shocked when I eat that early.) I noticed that rice spikes your insulin, so I started consuming millets. This has resulted in my fasting b.s being below 200-180. But again, it's rare that I eat that early plus rice is the staple food mostly made, which results in higher blood sugar. Right before sleeping I've to take Lantus (23 units) and a cup of milk(which I skip if I eat late).I was wondering if there's a hypoglycaemia situation when I'm asleep and later it increases? idk but doctor said to increase the dosage which didn't sit right with me since 23 units seems a lot too.

2) is there a way to decrease the fiasp dosage? so rn my dosages are 8-8-8 for breakfast, lunch and dinner respectively which is adjustable. For example if blood sugar before eating lies in the range of 80-150 then 8, 150-200 then 9 and so on. I have started to completely skip on carbs in the morning so I only eat fruits and coffee. But still like I said since the morning sugar is mostly high, I gotta take more insulin, which results in hypoglycaemia around noon. Any ideas about what should I do then and if I can somehow decrease my doses to even lower?

This is stupid long; TLDR:  felt s*** last night;  woke up bf bc I sounded like a wounded animal; I’m  fine today, but it still really sucked. 


I’m currently taking mounjaro for weight loss. Apparently I am in perimenopause and gained a decent amount of weight the last 2 years. Literally NOTHING helped with losing weight. Of course, one of the side effects is n******.  My Dr prescribed me Zofran in case I needed it.  I am two weeks into the weight loss injections and until last night, I felt fine!  A few times I had random weird stomach rumblings, but it passed so fast I hardly noticed. 
But oh my god last night. I woke up at 1 am and IMMEDIATELY felt s***. I grabbed my mint gum, took a Zofran, and paced for about 20 minutes until I felt ok. Phew.  
Right? Nope. 
I woke up at 5 am and felt n****** again, but worse, and began to panic. Took another Zofran, shoved like 4 pieces of gum in my mouth, and paced around the bedroom. I was breathing like a wounded buffalo or something equally as ridiculous sounding, and it woke up my boyfriend. We’ve been  together about 6 years, but he hasn’t seen me like that before, so then he was like uhhh what the hell is happening. In between my large animal breathing and rapidly chewing gum I explained to him that THIS is what I mean when I say I have a definite fear of getting s*** and feeling this way.  
Eventually, the Zofran and gum helped enough that I could breathe normally and at least sit down. I apologized to my bf for waking him up like that; he was more than understanding. I still feel awful about it and somewhat embarrassed? I know he doesn’t care that I panic about feeling n******, he just wants to make sure I am ok. But still. I’m 38 years old- part of me thought after dealing with this for the last 20 years I would be …better? And in some ways I am. I don’t avoid food as often, I have learned the difference between my anxiety causing issues and other stomach issues. 

Anyway. I’m fine today. I even had some coffee since I was getting a caffeine withdrawal migraine. 

Sorry for the wall of text. I don’t even know what the purpose of me typing this out was. Other than maybe needing to share my awful experience with someone who actually understands why it was awful and won’t judge me for it. ",1,1757747875.0,emetophobia,1,1.0,False
1nfr48g,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTMississauga/comments/1nfr48g/why_do_i_often_see_people_asking_others_to_drop/,"Why do I often see people asking others to drop out of courses? That's really weird, you know?","To be frank, the course selection system here operates under a rather perplexing logic. One can't help but question the wisdom of admitting waves of new students when the academic infrastructure clearly strains under the weight. The suspicion lingers that this is a financially driven calculus, heavily reliant on the substantial tuition fees from international students—often seven to eight times that of their domestic counterparts. This reliance creates a ripple effect, as these students also contribute significantly through costly housing, meal plans, and mandatory insurance, effectively subsidizing the institution.

The result is a campus ecosystem where an academic seat becomes a scarce commodity. We see students reduced to ""begging"" or ""desperately needing"" a spot in a required course, with the humble offer of a coffee becoming the currency of this strange, zero-sum game.

What I find most bewildering, however, is the almost devotional worship of GPA. Outside these ivy walls, in the professional world, this metric dissolves into near irrelevance. Companies don't ask for your grade point average; they ask for your portfolio, your internship experiences, and the tangible value you can create. They seek collaborators, quick learners, and problem-solvers. GPA, in contrast, feels like a hollow currency, valuable only within the confines of the campus marketplace.

In this relentless pursuit of a number, it seems we've lost sight of the true purpose of education: to cultivate practical skills, adapt to a rapidly evolving world, and for those fortunate enough, to foster independence, well-roundedness, and a lifelong capacity for self-improvement.

I’ve always know their end-game. I must admit even I did not expect such brazen callousness. We may as well rip the veil off this nightmare and stare into the abyss where “morning show banter” meets the gas chamber. Because here’s the gut-punch truth: Brian Kilmeade didn’t just spit out a “hot take” on Fox & Friends—he drew a syringe across America’s throat and whispered, your next. And yes reader, you. Not the faceless “them” he’s cackling about. The unfortunate shivering under bridges today? That’s the preview. The you in the mirror tomorrow, when the job you clawed for evaporates like smoke, the rent check bounces like a bad joke, and the system you’ve fed your blood, sweat, and soul to decides you’re just another “problem” to inject away.         
Picture it: You’re grinding 60-hour weeks at that warehouse gig, the one where the boss slashed overtime because “tariffs,” right? Boom—August’s jobs report hits like a ticking truth bomb: just 22,000 new spots added, unemployment spiking to 4.3%, the highest since the pandemic gutted everything. ￼That’s not a number; that’s your neighbor’s pink slip, your kid’s empty lunch fund, your “pull yourself up” myth crumbling under the weight of 911,000 phantom jobs that never existed—yanked from the books in a revision so brutal it’s the biggest since the Great Recession. ￼ And Kilmeade? He doesn’t see you scrambling for that last shift in health care (the one “bright spot” scraping by with 47,000 gains while everything else bleeds out). ￼ Nah, to him, when you miss rent and pitch a tent by the interstate, you’re not a laid-off dad fighting for his family. You’re “expendable.” “Involuntary lethal injection. Or something. Just kill them.” ￼ His words, live on air, casual as ordering coffee. While co-hosts nod like it’s Tuesday’s weather report.                   
Feel that chill? That’s the economy crashing down your spine. Recession odds? JPMorgan’s clocking 40% by year’s end, Goldman at 30%, with GDP limping to 1.25% if Trump’s tariff fever dream doesn’t torch it all first. ￼ Your 401(k)? Shredded. Grocery bill? Doubled. And as the ground shakes, hate rises like bile—FBI stats show anti-LGBTQ incidents exploding 110% since 2015, anti-trans violence carving out 26 injuries and a murder in the last year alone. ￼ ￼ Overall hate crimes? Up 2% in 2024 while everything else dipped, with extremists racking 15 kills in six weeks of 2025—already topping last year’s body count. ￼
￼It’s not random; it’s the venom Kilmeade spews, amplified by suits who gutted mental health funding and affordable housing to fund tax cuts for billionaires. These parasites feast on our fear, then prescribe poison for the scraps they leave behind.     
Scroll X, and it’s a bloodbath of backlash—users howling for his firing, clipping his words like evidence in a war crimes trial: “This is genocide incitement,” one screams. ￼ “Hitler’s T4 all over again,” another warns, linking it to the Nazis’ “euthanasia” of the “unfit.” ￼ Double standards? Republicans clutch pearls over “woke violence” while their golden boy greenlights street executions. No outrage from the party of “life.” Just crickets and cutaways.                    
But here’s the knife twist that keeps you up at night: This isn’t ancient history or some foreign horror. It’s now. Your cousin, fresh out of that factory shutdown, muttering about how “one bad month” and he’s next. Your aunt, scraping by on Social Security that hasn’t budged since Biden’s ghost, eyeing the streets as rents spike 20%. The injustice? It’s not abstract—it’s the policies these clowns cheered: Deregulate, defund, dehumanize. Kilmeade’s not the villain; he’s the symptom of a machine that chews workers and spits out “undesirables.”                       
So what now? You gonna let this slide, pretend the edge isn’t creeping closer? Or do you grab the wheel—vote out the cowards, demand housing as a right, flood 988 with calls until it breaks the budget, amplify the screams on X until Fox chokes on them? Because if we don’t, that “just kill them” becomes policy. And next time it’s not the homeless on the table. It’s you. Heart pounding yet? Good. Now move. The abyss is staring back—and it’s got Kilmeade’s smile.",1,1757747835.0,TheGr8Conversation,2,0.67,False

M'n vriendin J. heeft vorig jaar juli haar rijbewijs gehaald en we zijn een paar dagen later naar de Alpen gereden, ze vond het erg vet en reed uitstekend. Dit jaar hadden we wat meer tijd en wilden we verder weg - we hebben naar verschillende mogelijkheden gekeken (oa. Noordkaap, Marokko, Ierland) en kwamen op Kreta uit, we waren allebei nog niet eerder in de Balkan geweest en wilden graag meer zien van Griekenland en Italië. Onze planning ging uit van 8000km in vijf weken en dat is het ook ongeveer geworden!

## **Preparations**
***

***Bikes and luggage***

J. really likes the Tiger, and I'd just bought a new SMT in January. When it came to luggage I had a number of bags lying around from my previous trips, and decided to expand the set with a Kriega rackpack. The completed setup was as follows:

* Tiger: 42L top case, 30L Kriega drypack, 10L tank bag. Chain lock wrapped around the rear carrier.
* SMT: Kriega 40L rackpack, Kriega 30L drypack, 5L tank bag. Disc lock in the seat pocket.

The two locks allowed us to quickly [secure the bikes](https://imgur.com/a/KbxDPW7) and helmets anywhere we went. Both bikes also had a bottle holder with a thermos for (cold) drinking water attached to the front crash bars. For each bag we carried a spare strap, as well as some general purpose rokstraps and bungee cords. You never know when something might break, or when stuff falls off and you need to secure it somehow.

We each have a full mesh gear setup: jacket, pants, gloves, and riding sneakers topped off with fitted ear plugs, a buff, and Sena helmet kit. Both of us also carried a light rainjacket, waterproof riding overall, hiking boots, regular light shoes, a sweater, and some light regular clothing. In the tank bag we carried a tourniquet, emergency bandage, pocket knife, lighter, drinking water, some emergency food (energy bars), phone and charger, and miscellaneous stuff like sunglasses, camera, and paper maps. We also had two small first aid kits, a foil blanket, and some regular towels with us.

***Maintenance, spare parts, tools***

The Tiger was sitting at around 230k km and has been burning oil at an accelerating pace. It needs topping up every few days, so we decided to play it safe, and brought a 4L oil can with us, as well as some small spare parts (starter solenoid, sprocket nut and lockwasher). The SMT was brand new with only 9k on it, the main concern being that the 15k service should be done somewhere on the way for warranty purposes. For chain maintenance I carried a 1L bottle of 80w90 gear oil and a brush. We also had [a small toolkit](https://imgur.com/a/0psTdqg) with the basics required to work on the brakes, bodywork, get to the battery and fuses, and make emergency repairs (tape/tiewraps/wire). Both of us have worldwide roadside assistance, and since we weren't planning on straying too far from civilization we didn't carry camping or cooking gear, nor equipment to change tires. While on the road we would grease the chains and give the bikes a good lookover every few days at least.

***Navigation and lodging***

Both bikes have Garmin XTs mounted, and for each day we'd make a GPX in Kurviger and upload it to the navis. We had a general route in mind but the details were usually worked out over dinner the night before with some old-fashioned paper maps and some local information sprinkled in. Apart from the first and the last day we mostly avoided motorways, and on average did about 300km a day. We'd typically ride for 60 - 90 minutes each between breakfast, coffee, lunch, and afternoon drinks, and arrival so about 4 - 6 hours of riding each day. 

When it came to lodging we went with BnB's, apartments, and hotels found through the usual channels. I have done some light camping in the past but never on longer motorcycle trips and never with J., so if we ever wanted to, we'd have to do some practice runs first. We didn't have a strict budget per se, but tried to stay within about €250 a day on average, including two tanks of fuel.

## **Leg 1: [Netherlands to Macedonia](https://imgur.com/a/EUMKvRV)**
***

* Day 1 and 2: Freiburg, Germany (700km)

We left around 11h00 for an _autobahn_ sit to Freiburg, arriving for dinner with friends of mine who live near the city. I know there's a lot to see in-between: the Ardennes, Luxemburg, the Black Forest, the Vosges.. but we've been to those places many, many times already and when you're on the way south it's preferable to take long strides sometimes. We suffered through heavy rainstorms near Frankfurt but by the time we pulled off the highway two hours later it was warm and dry. The next day we took a bit of a rest and explored the city together with my mates. Freiburg is a large university town with a young vibe and a lovely mix of provincial and cosmopolitan Germany. Worth a stop, if you're ever nearby. 

* Day 3: Lech, Austria (350km)

We took off through the southernmost part of the Black Forest to arrive on the shores of the Bodensee (Lac Konstanz) for a sun-drenched lunch. I'd plotted a route from Bregenz along the [200] and [198] in Tyrol cause I'd never been to that part of Austria yet, and it was pretty decent and a bit quiet. We got some light rain in the afternoon, but generally decent weather. Out hotel for the night was a very cheap but run down classic mountain lodge, with rooms that have been in dire need of an overhaul since about 1995. It seemed to me like the family who owned it was squeezing it for what it was worth without investing anything in the place. [Dinner](https://imgur.com/a/bHbaEXV) and breakfast were decent however, but the wifi and cell reception was nonexistent in the little valley.

* Day 4: Tolmezzo, Italy (350km)

We left in the morning fog towards Imst, a road with great views of the southern Alps across the valley, towards Italy. We took a short bit of highway to get past Innsbruck, then turned south and east to Zell am Ziller and the [Grossglockner](https://imgur.com/a/bVcSklw). I've mostly been to the Swiss and Italian side of the Alps so this famous road was on the to-do list still. We arrived on a weekday just after lunch which meant it was fairly quiet, but I can imagine it being busy and annoying on weekends. The road is great but the toll is outrageous: €35 per bike. It's worth it, at least for once, because the views and landscape are absolutely stunning. The road was built as a tourist attraction starting in 1930 as it didn't exist as a historical pass or anything, hence the tolls. Once across the GG we went southeast to the beautiful little [Plockenpass into Italy](https://imgur.com/a/YeZ9eFv), and arrived at [our BnB near Tolmezzo](https://imgur.com/a/QdwomvD). From here on the weather was pretty much impeccable for the rest of our trip.

* Day 5: Obrov, Slovenia (350km)

We started with a quiet mountain outing in the morning, towards Paularo and then north over an eerily quiet and narrow road towards the (unpaved) Polentin pass. We didn't take it though, instead continuing east to Pontebba, and then up the Sella Nevea and Predil passes into Slovenia. We followed the [203] and [102] south along the river through countless villages with traffic cameras seemingly every 500 meters. The temperature also built steadily and in the afternoon we were buckling in the 35 degree heat. Took a break near the [Skjocjan Caves](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xMC2N6PriYnVSjrb7) where the Karst landscape has been worn out by rainfall and underground rivers into endless tunnels which at some point collapsed leaving a [giant crater](https://imgur.com/a/g29pmdj) in the landscape, a bizarre and gorgeous sight, but also quiet at this time of day and cool in the forest. We found a gorgeous BnB in the [hills east of Trieste](https://imgur.com/a/A7Dt59x) which included a lovely dinner with local wines, and breakfast.

* Day 6: Bihac, Bosnia and Herzegovina (400km)

This turned out to be one of the more interesting days, cause a lot happened in quick succession. We approached the Adriatic over some beautiful B roads to enjoy morning coffee at the [little boulevard in Bakar](https://imgur.com/a/Uu2Z16G), next to Rijeka. After this we followed the coast, zooming between campers and caravans, with gorgeous views of the sea and numerous islands to our right. At our lunch stop in Senj we were approached by a Dutch couple who just returned from a MotoGymKhana tournament in Zagreb so we spent some time talking bikes with them, and afterwards we went up into the hills towards Dabar and eventualle Zeljava. We saw several 'warning: mines' signs on the side of the road, and in one little village where we stopped for drinks we were greeted by the local car tuning club, bunch of guys with old Audi's and VW's, ogling J., who didn't feel quite at ease. I noticed that several of them had Ustase stickers on their cars (local version of the SS, basically), lovely bunch. Croatia apparently has a bit of a problem with far right extremists. We got the hell outta there as soon as our colas were through. This part of Croatia felt very remote and rough, and although there were plenty of signs advertising apartments and BnB's, there was hardly anyone on the road. Not long after this we arrived at [Zeljava air base](https://imgur.com/a/2USAZA0) which is fairly well known at this point and a nice opportunity for a cheesy picture. [The border with Bosnia](https://imgur.com/a/AdpKuV1) was only a few miles away and was very easy: no inspections, no questions, just a quick glance at our passports and that was it. Immediately afterwards the landscape changed, with occasional [mosques](https://imgur.com/a/QVjhrCU) and orthodox christian churches in the little villages next to the road, old tractors chugging along with carts full of produce, and children playing in the street. One of the staff of our motel in Bihac explained that it was peaceful now, Muslims, Christians, and everyone tolerating each other pretty much. We noticed how the mosque in town _did_ call for prayer like usual but in a rather quiet and short version unlike the minute-long yammering you get in the Middle East, and plenty of restaurants served alcohol. The crowd in the street also seemed varied, could've been anyplace Europe, basically. The town itself was situated along a shallow river with a fairground, restaurants, and bars and loads of people and kids around, it felt very organic and friendly. We had great burgers at a 'wine bar' which turned out to have exactly two kinds of wine, red and white.

* Day 7 and 8: Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina (300km)

Breakfast was intense: we got eggs, a bunch of baked or steamed vegetables, and no less than three different kinds of sausages as well as bacon and olives, and no coffee (which was off because [Bosnian coffee](https://imgur.com/a/wBJiDYF) in general is quite good). By god did I wish for an espresso and some croissants! We followed the main road along the river all day towards Sarajevo, and saw several more signs indicating mines as well as remnants from the war: numerous buildings, large and small, had bullet holes and even [grenade impacts](https://imgur.com/a/i4z3pxD), which had either been left in place or re-stucced in a different colour for emphasis. Gasoline was only about 1€ per liter which made for easy fueling, and all but the smallest places accepted card payments. We stopped for lunch in Jajce with its [gorgeous waterfalls](https://imgur.com/a/Jo0XbnO), situated among green rolling hills. The roads were generally good and traffic was light. It was quite hot in the afternoon so around Zenica we decided to take the highway for the last hour towards Sarajevo.

The next day we visited one of the [museums](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2JVpHjsi9jetyixZ7) about the siege which was.. a haunting experience. It's truly despicable how the international community sat by and watched while civilians were being starved and shot at daily for nearly four years. We walked around town a good bit and came across numerous monuments and memorials. In the afternoon we took the cable car up to Trebevic hill which gave a great [view of the city](https://imgur.com/a/QIIsjEn) and is the location of the [abandoned bobsled track](https://imgur.com/a/R9kgsk5) from the [1984 winter olympics](https://imgur.com/a/2xMBZj4). Like the rest of Bosnia, Sarajevo was in a reasonably good state and it felt clean, and modern. The old town is extremely touristy with all the garbage trinket shops, ice cream vendors, and tourist traps this brings, but at the same time it maintains a quaint and interesting atmosphere. 

* Day 9: Berane, Montenegro (300km)

About an hour east of Sarajevo we were taking a little roadside break, when suddenly a fluffy little shape walks across the road not 20ft away. I whisper to J. in my mic.. ""_there's a bear cub here, get back on the bike quick and quiet cause we need to go now_"". Really didn't feel like meeting his mom! The [R450] and [R467] feel quiet and remote, and run by some very pretty rocky canyons and little lakes. We crossed into Serbia later morning, just for a short stint cause the [182] goes nowhere except south into Montenegro. Both crossings were extremely quiet and easy without questions or hassle. The [P10] and [E65] south lead through some pretty landscapes, flowing green hills and mountains very much like the past few days, except it had been _desurfaced_ for a distance of nearly 20 miles in anticipation of major repairs/upgrades, so we spent almost an hour driving dead slow along rocky white gravel in a filthy dusty mist thrown up by the cars in front of us. My snot was like clay for hours after this and the bikes looked like they'd been through a [cement](https://imgur.com/a/RXnJg6r) [mixer](https://imgur.com/a/A0iF9OK).

* Day 10: Givgelija, Macedonia (400km)

Our hostel was situated on the ski slopes with a [magnificent breakfast view](https://imgur.com/a/w4JkU1U), after which we took the steep hairpins back down to the main road. We entered Kosovo half an hour later, the border crossing was busier than the others we'd had so far but not much of a hassle. We had to buy temporary insurance worth €6 per bike since Kosovo is de facto independent from Serbia but not formally recognised by the European insurance companies yet. The [R106] down from the Montegrin mountains onto the Kosovo plain was spectacular with great tarmac, beautiful hairpins, and a sweet view. The central plain south of Pristina was extremely boring and busy and it was crazy hot as well, so we only dipped into the capital briefly for a glance at the Bill Clinton [statue](https://imgur.com/a/O4w0qTJ) (they're grateful to NATO in general and ol' Bill specifically for the 1999 intervention which eventually resulted in their independence) before heading south towards Macedonia. The combination of scorching heat and ferry ticket prices (to Crete) meant that we had to make a bit of speed these days. Highways aren't nearly always boring though, the [E75] southeast of Skopje weaves and bends through a beautiful rocky landscape with the occasional olive grove and winery. It was nice to be able to keep up the speed in the scorching heat. Our place for tonight was the quite luxurious but also very cheap Sky Hotel barely a mile north of the Greek border. We sat on the roof terrace in the still-heavy evening heat enjoying a beer and chatting with the waiter who spoke perfect English and recommended some local dishes to us. One of them seemed a bit like lasagna (oven dish with layers of vegetables, tomatoes, and cheese) however upon my comparison the guy was adamant that I was an idiot and that it was in fact not at all like lasagna.

* Day 11: Kalambaka, Greece (300km)

For most of our time in [Greece](https://imgur.com/a/0fJOzBl) the mid-day temperatures were around 35 degrees and we were stopping every 30-45mins for a drink, and if possible to dunk our buff and gloves in water somewhere which would make the next 30 mins on the bike bearable. This morning we followed the main road south to Thesaloniki and then Katerini, where we turned right into the hills, along the foot of [mount olympos](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aGR3VAEcjhqrov846). The inner part of Greece isn't as touristy as the coast and some of the cities, so the roads were fairly quiet, first the [13] and then the [26] and [15] to Kalambaka and [the Meteora](https://imgur.com/a/nnliiNQ). We were absolutely soaking with sweat when we arrived, however the view is.. off this world. I can only imagine the reactions of the first stone-age Greeks as they ventured inland and came across [this landscape](https://imgur.com/a/aZXrn2k) which appears [straight out of a high fantasy series](https://imgur.com/a/hq1yRby). We took a long cold shower then went for a (slow!) walk [around the foot of these hills](https://imgur.com/a/OfmyFEX) (this is funny because I'm a biologist and the sign says MICROBIOLOGIKO) in the evening heat, we'd planned on going a longer circuit but the heat made it impossible. 

* Day 12: Piraeus (350km)

We left very early in the morning to try and beat the some of the worst heat, speeding along the [E65] towards Lamia along a valley which was [a good bit greener](https://imgur.com/a/rxcfHQr) than the rest of Greece, probably due to rain runoff from the surrounding mountains. Giant olive/orange/lime orchards were all over the place and the road was flanked by ancient rock quarries and a snaking railway that seemed rather newly built. Once up in the hills south of Lamia the temperature dropped somewhat and we got to take a number of [remote little roads](https://imgur.com/a/6sJlzDQ)(not pictured: 42 degrees celsius!) full of hairpins which ran straight through villages with very surprised looking old Greek men on the road side. We had a long [lunch and a swim in Antikyra](https://imgur.com/a/t4b6gv7), and around 15h00 we wetted our gear once again to brace against the stifling heat on the road to Athens. We had planned for a curvy coastal road but we were so tired and fed up with the heat that we decided to stick to the main roads and even took a bit of highway. Interesting to note is that the Greek toll system is very different from the French/Spanish/Italian ones, in the sense that you don't take a ticket and pay when you leave the road, but you just stop at a toll station every 10-20km on the road and pay directly for that distance. Oftentimes it was no more than 50 cents, occasionally 1 or 2 euro's. 

Athens and the surroundings suffer from a terrible case of urban heat syndrome and evening traffic made it all the worse, it was close to 40 degrees on the main road into Piraeus. We were splitting at a decent pace between the commuters but still local bikes and scooters zoomed around us every which way.

* Day 13 and 14: Matala (100km)

We boarded the ferry [Piraeus -> Heraklion](https://imgur.com/a/tZ4ERL7) around 08h30 with a large backpack full of groceries: water, bread, olives, snacks, some fruit, etc. The onboard offerings are usually overpriced medium quality so it's best to bring your own. We picked a nice spot in the shade on the rear deck and spent the day gazing our over the mediterranean, reading, or sipping coffee (the only thing worth buying from the bar, basically). At one point I though I saw some dolphins in the distance but was unable to verify :(

Crete is a little cooler than the mainland which felt like a welcome change, and the ride south across the island to [Matala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matala,_Crete) was uneventful. We found a nice little guest house with airconditioning and a good place to park, so all was well. We took a rest the next day, went [hiking](https://imgur.com/a/RlxikkH), swimming, enjoyed a long seaside lunch followed by a siesta, and sauntered along the little town which while rather touristy on the hand, was also small enough to maintain a distinct aura of local innocence on the other. There's a cute little harbour with a small beach and beautiful [rock formations](https://imgur.com/a/Dgdoc9p) right next to it, [hippie graffiti and art](https://img1.vakantio.de/uploads/f83fb11285e4535ba04c81438f9a2a7d_large.avif), as well as a lot of small bars and restaurants. Not a bad place for a break!

* Day 15 and 16: Rethymno (350km)

We rode along the rocky coastal road westwards towards Selia and Komitades, and then north and slightly easy back to Rethymno. The mountains sometimes seem to rise straight from the sea! We passed through [several](https://imgur.com/a/J2PUouS) [rocky gorges](https://imgur.com/a/3a9kxWQ) where all life had gone grey and yellow except right next to what used to be the stream. Even insects were few and far between since it hadn't rained in over a month with consistent 30-degree temperatures. The southern coast is rather quiet with only the occasional tour bus going to the gorges, on the other hand the northern coast is extremely touristy and rather bland. Endless hotels, resorts, restaurants and a huge traffic jam all the way in between. Rethymno itself has a decent boulevard and harbour but the town itself is inundated with tourists and it's difficult to find affordable and authentic places to eat and shop. It's basically the same souvenir store with fridge magnets, coffee cups, and dresses copy-pasted a few hundred times. 

We took a bit of a rest day after this, J. was a bit tired so she hopped on the back of the SMT and we drove a bit west to see the [ruins of Aptera](https://imgur.com/a/BtdR5As) and then went for lunch + a swim in the town of Stavros just north of Chania. Turned out to have been the exact beach location used in the movie [Zorba the Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorba_the_Greek_\(film\)). 

* Day 17: Heraklion (100km)

We left early in the morning because I had an appointment with the KTM garage in Heraklion - it was sitting at nearly 14.000km and the 15k service was near. Napels might also have been an option but that might have been stretching it. Any way we arrived at the shop around 10h00 to find all the lifts occupied and nobody in a rush to help despite the appointment. We had to wait a good half hour before the lead mechanic was finished and told us it'd take at least two hours for the oil change and minor checks, so we spent the rest of the morning and lunch at a nearby café under the blissful air conditiong. We had planned to go for a longer ride in the afternoon towards Arkalohchori but the long wait and the stifling heat killed the mood, so we went for an early check in at our hotel, spending the rest of the afternoon and evening strolling around town, visiting museums and writing postcards. The [Heraklion Archaological Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ficYA6SQZFYV2udB8) was sweet, they had [so much stuff](https://imgur.com/a/3fwLREq) that they could easily split into five different museums each with a proper collection!

* Day 18: Nafplion (200km)

The return [ferry to Piraeus](https://imgur.com/a/BQbSMtZ) left at 09h00 and we were well-prepared again with our bag of groceries. In retrospect it would've been preferable to stay a few more days on Crete considering the costs of the ferry (€120 for a one-way for two pax and two bikes), and I wouldn't have minded spending another day or two in Matala and having another day for a bike trip either to the eastern or western point of the island. But we had a wee bit of a schedule to keep and were also dependent on the Igoumenitsa - Brindisi ferry which was far more expensive and this required careful planning.

It was hot again in Piraeus late afternoon, so we quickly jumped on the bikes and made our way across the Isthmus of Corinth towards Nafplion in the peloponnese. A gorgeous old town with a touristy aftertaste, Nafplion has been an important harbour since Roman times, with several large fortresses either [in the harbour](https://imgur.com/a/tqqWHGm) or [on the hills](https://imgur.com/a/aQFQjTF) right behind it.

* Day 19: Vonitsa (350km)

From Nafplion we drove around the bay to Lerna and then west into the hills of the Arcadia, already famous in ancient times for its 'untouched' landscape. We followed the [7], [111] and the [33] west, then turned north near Agria Triade, towards Patras. It was at this point that the rear hugger of the Tiger broke and started rattling like crazy. We got lucky at one of the gas stations when the clerk had [a drill I could borrow](https://imgur.com/a/rbKit10), and I fixed it with a nice [tiewrap stitch](https://imgur.com/a/DUOX0wB). It was also during this day that J. cried out in pain at some point, when a hornet the size of a fist took a bite out of her leg, right through her mesh suit. Even three weeks later the damn wound hasn't healed completely. It doesn't sound like much but this was one of my favorite days in Greece since it was quiet, green, not _too_ hot in the mountains, and just hours and hours of endless curves and pretty landscapes. From Patras we went north to the little peninsula of Aitoliko which is an extremely run-down town which to be honest should have been a tourist hotspot, considering the location on the coast, and the views.

## **Leg 3: [Italy and back home](https://imgur.com/a/4IfzBCs)**
***

* Day 20: Brindisi, Italy (150km)

Our [ferry to Italy](https://imgur.com/a/SAti71g) left at 14h00 only, so we took a slow morning with breakfast along the shores of the Ambracian gulf, near the location where in 31 BCE Octavian (the later emperor Caesar Augustus) with a little help from Marcus Agrippa [defeated the forces of Marc Antony and Cleopatra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Actium), effectively becoming sole ruler of the mediterranean and shaping Europe for the ages. From there we took the sweet coastal road past Lichnos and Sivota and arrived in Igoumenitsa in time for some lunch and grocery shopping. The ferry itself was uneventful and our hostel for the night was a rundown place so I won't waste time on that.

* Day 21 and 22: Sorrento (450km)

We left at 07h00 and made our way along the [E90] to Taranto for breakfast. This part of Apulia is flat with mainly agriculture and a lot of abandoned and ruined farmhouses and industry. Even the roadside is filthy with trash dumped everywhere. After a sweet Italian breakfast and some cappuchinos with a view of the Taranto harbour, we continued north-west into the hills along the [E847], [SP103] and [SS92], coming by some some pretty historical villages (and ruins) such as Pisticci, [Craco](https://imgur.com/a/nIPOew8), and Stigliano. Once near Potenza it was getting awfully hot again so from here on we stuck to the main roads before arriving at the stunning [Amalfi coast](https://imgur.com/a/ciBQWU6) near Salerno. If you're ever in the neighbourhood, go here, rent a bike, and drive the [SS163] here!

The next day we drove down to the Sorrento harbour in [the local biker outfit](https://imgur.com/a/czTDXNu), and took the ferry into Napoli harbour and played tourist for a bit, before taking the train back in the evening. We had real nice BnB on a hill near Vico Equense which offered [sweet views of Napoli bay and the Visuvius](https://imgur.com/a/pzEu5FT)!

* Day 23: Cassino (300km)

We followed the coast towards Pompeii then took a number of quiet mountain roads (which I can't find on the map for the life of me) towards Avellino and Benevento. From there we stuck to the hills all the way towards Piedimonte, Pietrovairano with it's beautiful (and only very recently discovered) [Roman theatre](https://maps.app.goo.gl/imfMfi2Rqo1PftUc8), and eventually Cassino where drove up all the way to [the abbey](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zNfdCF5skY5B63dh6) for a stroll. The abbey was completely destroyed by the USAF in 1944 (along with several hundred refugees sheltering) because intel indicated that the Germans were using it as an observation post (which was false). Look up [the battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Monte_Cassino) if you're even remotely interested in history!

* Day 24: Trasimene (350km)

From Cassino we headed to the coast near Latina to circumvent Rome as much as possible (already been there - not keen on traffic!) and had coffee on the beach near the Fiumichino airport. From there we followed the coast all the way to Tarquinia where we turned right towards Viterbo, the ancient [Papal residence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_the_Popes_in_Viterbo), then continued inland along the highway towards lake Trasimene, the location of [the second of Hannibals' stunning victories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lake_Trasimene) against the Romans during the second Punic war. The landscape in this part of Italy is green rolling hills, much unlike the dry near-desert of the south. We found an [old-fashioned but affordable](https://imgur.com/a/BtChvyA) and friendly hotel a little ways away from the lake shore.

* Day 25 and 26: Cinque Terre (350km)

From Trasimene we crossed Tuscany towards Siena en Pontedera, a hypertouristic region but also well deserved. The landscape is a characteristic greenish/brown dotted with cypress-lined country lanes, orchards and vineyards, and the architecture is [extremely picturesque](https://iconiclife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tuscany-Italy-countryside.jpg). We went by the iconic [Gladiator filming location](https://imgur.com/a/BEfa0u6) and definitely weren't the only one in line. Foreign license plates are everywhere and traffic in the bigger towns is super busy. There's also wine-tastings advertised every couple miles at least so being on the road here in the late afternoon carries a bit of risk no doubt. Lastly we took a wee bit of highway to La Spezia since it was, again, stupid hot, and once there turned onto the hills just behind Cinque Terre to reach Manarola, our stay for tonight. CT is one of the most touristic places in Italy ([and well-deserved tbh](https://imgur.com/a/CJP7UUv)), and the most iconic five towns are difficult to reach by vehicle, we had to [park nearly a mile outside the little town along the road](https://imgur.com/a/fuLzsrl) and carry our luggage all the way. We managed to find an affordable BnB with a _great_ breakfast for just over €100 a night; most other places were more than twice as expensive.

The day after we took a nice lazy rest, went swimming in the [little rocky harbour](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bbcf00a9b8fe874ed2f03d0/75b3da41-f663-4d86-9225-4c1bba64f00e/cinque-terre-manarola.jpg?format=2500w), took the train to nearby [Vernazza](https://imgur.com/a/x51YTg6) (absolute _packed_ with tourists: American, Chinese, German mostly it seemed), had an expensive but lovely lunch, and then boated back to Manarola. CT is expensive in the main season but [the coast is stunning](https://imgur.com/a/BwzCJ7X) so if you're ever around and can find a decently-priced place to stay (or simply visit slightly in the off-season..).

* Day 27: Milan (250km)

From Cinque Terre we followed the coast north-west and then slightly inland to Rivarola, from which we took the [SS586], [SP586R] and the [SS45] north-east to Piacenza. The whole region consists of low, [forested mountains](https://imgur.com/a/ly15ci7) and in-between the villages it feels eerily quiet. We met a handful of Italian biker groups and near Marsaglia came across an accident site where a Street Fighter V4 had struck the front end of an oncoming car. The bike was wrecked and the rider was in obvious distress on the road side, his mates however appeared to have things under control and when we continued along we met the ambulance racing to the scene, coming the other way. When we descended towards the Po valley in the early afternoon the temperature shot up to the high thirties, and the Trebbia river which the road followed roughly north was dotted with parasols and playing children. Just south of Piacenza we visited the [battle memorial](https://imgur.com/a/8wPGRXq) near the location where Hannibal inflicted [the first of his three defeats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Trebia) against the Romans in 218 BCE. Although clearly marked on the map, the memorial doesn't have a dedicated place to park nor even a plaque or sign explaining what it is. From Piacenza we took the highway to Milan - J. was tired after all the mountain roads and by the extreme heat we faced in the afternoon. Milan was a bit of a surprise in mid-August, we found the city more or less abandoned with barely any traffic in the streets and much of the shops and restaurants closed. We spent the evening with friends, wandering around the 'new' part of town ([Piazza Gau Alente](https://imgur.com/a/pDIf9OC) and surroundings) and the ['tree library'](https://imgur.com/a/asCFhiO) next to it (which is really well done), after which we had an elaborate yet bargain dinner in [a tiny Chinese restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zFT87vWYaqZYtfNN7).

* Day 28,29,30: Davos, Switzerland (800km)

From Milan we rode north to Como, then followed the Swiss [2] and [13] along the valley to Bellinzona and eventually [San Bernardino](https://imgur.com/a/FkSe3sV). It's one of my favorite passes, too narrow for trucks and with a [gorgeous lake](https://imgur.com/a/mMCfKbm) at the top, and even the last stretch of the highway towards it has [bloody hairpins](https://imgur.com/a/POJxDWx)! From here we went along the beautiful Graubündner valleys towards Thusis and eventually Davos. I've been coming to Davos regularly for more than a decade and the high season (winter) prices are legendary, however in late summer everything is decidedly more affordable; we managed to snatch a room in a fancy, old fashioned three-star hotel for just 400 francs for three nights. We had a [gorgeous mountain view](https://imgur.com/a/5aRFAn0) [from our balcony](https://imgur.com/a/Y30ghVG) and breakfast was everything you'd expect from a fancy place! 

The next morning we took off early towards the Fluela, Ofen, Fuorn, [Stelvio](https://imgur.com/a/7F82fiR), [Bernina](https://imgur.com/a/Y51T6Dd), and Albula passes respectively ([clockwise from the top](https://imgur.com/a/HcVHAZs)). A long day of [well-trodden mountain territory for both of us](https://imgur.com/a/JjXiquq), but goddamn if [this](https://imgur.com/a/81VqzaX) isn't what riding is about, I don't know what is. Weather was perfect and J. did extremely well even on the heavy tiger. We even got to a cute [couple picture](https://imgur.com/a/Pjbu5oo) taken! 🥰

On the second rest day we took it real easy with only a short tour of the [Julier](https://imgur.com/a/QuStcLn) and Fluela passes in the morning, and a short hike and a relaxing swim in the afternoon. It was 28 degrees in Davos which is considered somewhat of a heat wave aroun there.

* Day 31: Freiburg, Germany (300km)

From Davos we took a number of minor (and not always very interesting) roads northeast through Switzerland and the Black Forest past Liechtenstein, St. Gallen, and Waldshut, while stopping in Winterthur for lunch with friends. It was extremely hot once more, and the holiday traffic in the Black Forest was exhausting, bloody campervans everywhere. We were happy to crash with friends after a cold shower, and with a cold beer!

* Day 32: Home (700km)

Straight shot north-west on the Autobahn. No irregularities ;)

## **Epilogue**
***

We got home mid-August filthy and tired after [8300km](https://imgur.com/a/ON68EP3). We spent two days washing, cleaning, and sorting through everything, and on the third day we took the bikes to the [car wash](https://imgur.com/a/fxblwlW) for a good scrub. After that, it was time to return to normal life more or less.

The bikes held up fine, only issues were the sometimes nonfunctional cruise control on the SMT, and the broken rear hugger of the Tiger. The latter drank nearly 4.5L of oil, which is a bit frustrating but unsurprising considering its age. I'm curious to see whether it'll hold up another ~60k til 300 without a major breakdown. I'm also very impressed with the SMT. It's comfortable on longer distances, easy to pack with luggage, but at the same time also light and nimble, and an absolute riot in the mountains.

***Favorite roads:*** (in no particular order)

* [Unnamed road between Paularo and Pontebba in north-eastern Italy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/24768qrnwdibcr1M8). Narrow and curvy, the tarmac was nonexistent at times but the sweet and quiet alpine landscape and the looming peaks were stunning. Navigation will claim that the road is closed due to a landslide but this has been fixed recently. There's a lovely _[agroturismo](https://imgur.com/a/TWcwzEI)_ halfway for coffee and snacks, be sure to bring cash. You can also cross the unpaved Polentin pass into Austria from there.

* [The R467 in Bosnia between Pijesak and the Serbian border](https://maps.app.goo.gl/joRnQFxbVpc6vhwJ8). Gorgeous green hills interspersed with little lakes and rivers. Extremely quiet, and uhh, there's bears. The whole route felt dreamy.

* [The 111 in the Arcadia, Greece](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xhAtjT5vMdVMDfzK6). Endlessly long, very quiet, a mix of green and rocky, and decently surfaced with endless curves and spectacular views. Part of it feel like the Alps almost, with ski resorts and wooden lodges.

* [Unnamed coastal road south of Igoumenitsa, Greece](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BXybD55hn3GT9Pot9). Stunning views of the rocky coastline with small forested islands dotted about and Corfu looming in the distance. The hulking ferries chugging along on the horizon really put things into perspective.

* [The SS163 on the Amalfi coast, Italy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2RU3wuSnz8RKBnvg8). This road is a testament to man's arrogance. Endless tunnels, bridges, and little villages with not a level square meter of soil in sight. Do not attempt with a car.


***Personal notes***

Traveling like this with your partner certainly makes things more interesting, it's far more intense than just living together, because there's never a quiet moment: you're always on the road together, resting, eating, sleeping together. You can't bugger off to spend the evening with friends, you can't isolate yourself with games, a book, or garden work. In that sense it's a great relationship test, and the important part is to communicate about the frustrations that arise, because you'll both be going through them. We did fine overall, but there were certainly difficult days and occasions when I really just wanted to have some time to myself. At the same time you do get to know each other better through such circumstances, and I wouldn't trade that for the world.

If you're ever wondering if motorcycle touring is for you - let this tale be of inspiration? Start small, just a few days here and there, then work your way up. Onroad, offroad, camping, hotels, you can do it in whatever way works for you. Collect maps, bags, accessories, tools, and chase that horizon! It's an intense way to travel, but also one of the best to actually _see_ the places you're going through.

1nfqy9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1nfqy9r/how_i_finally_managed_to_control_my_symptoms_and/,How I finally managed to control my symptoms and regulate my cycles!,"I’ve been following a few polish dietitians on IG for a few months now (I’m Polish too ), and honestly... it's life changing. I tried a few of their tips here and there and the results have been huge — my periods are now regular, way less bloating, bathroom schedule is finally normal  and a lot more. I haven’t really seen such a detailed account in English, so I thought I’d share some of the things that worked for me. Feels like every girl with PCOS should know this stuff.

There’s a lot, so I’ll just start with the small changes I made day-to-day.

# My daily routine

* I try to sleep at least 8h (9h is even better).
* First thing in the morning, I check my temperature (more on that later).
* Then I drink warm water with a ginger cube I make myself (blend ginger, lemon, turmeric + black pepper, freeze it).
* Breakfast has to be high protein: usually 3 eggs with avocado, or oats with cinnamon, chia + protein powder, or blended flax seeds cooked with almond milk,  protein powder and sugarfree chocolate. (btw ginger, lemon, cinnamon are antioxidants = fight inflammation).

Lunch is after 3–4h. Anything goes as long as it’s high in fiber + protein.

Dinner is usually 5–6h later, still high in protein but I let myself have more carbs at night since it helps with sleep.

If I overdo carbs/sugar, I’ll go for a walk (even just pacing around the house for 10 minutes lol since I WFH) — it helps with glucose/insulin levels.



# Supplements (my basics)

Obviously this depends on the person, but here’s what I take daily:

* Vit D3 after breakfast (4k IU but I skip if I spent at least 40min in the sun bc I live in Singapore and it's quite easy to get enough sun)
* Omega 3 (make sure the ratio is 500 EPA : 250 DHA)
* B-complex in the morning (gives energy bc it affects the nervous system)
* Magnesium 2h before bed (calms me and helps with cramps bc it lowers cortisol)
* Zinc (better ovulation)
* Myo-inositol (40:1 ratio with D-chiro) before sleep, helps with REM sleep, I take 2g bc I learnt how to control my sugar level but even 4g is recommended
* Spearmint (for testosterone) usually after ovulation



Other stuff I add in: sodium butyrate for gut health. If I feel low on iron I’ll take 1g vitamin C before eating iron-rich meal. If I feel sick → 1g vit C x 3 a day + more vit D.

# Food & lifestyle tips

* More protein + healthy fats = less sugar cravings.
* In luteal phase/period → cut down on caffeine (cortisol is already high).
* Seed cycling: pumpkin seeds in follicular, sesame + sunflower in luteal.
* Alcohol = inflammation + stress. I don’t drink at all, it's worth cutting down.



# Tracking temperature

This one was a game changer for me! My cycles used to be all over the place, I never knew when my period was coming. I thought “tracking temperature” was only for trying to conceive, but it’s actually so useful. After 2–3 months of doing it daily, I learned my pattern and now I know exactly when to expect my period (and it’s super helpful if you’re TTC).

How I do it:

* I take my temp every morning right after waking up, within the same 30 min window, after at least 5h of sleep.
* Use a digital thermometer (I use Microlife).
* You’re looking for a temp rise of 0.2–0.6°C, which means ovulation. The temp stays higher until period.
* PCOS cycles can still have ovulation even if they’re long (like day 30+).
* 18+ days of high temp = possible pregnancy.
* Low temp (<36.2) = maybe thyroid/nutrient issue.
* Big temp swings daily = high cortisol.



# Exercise

More doesn’t mean better! With PCOS, high cortisol is an issue, so I try to:

* Do higher intensity / weights after period until a week after ovulation.
* Luteal phase = yoga, lighter weights, longer breaks.
* No workouts on day 1–3 of period.
* Walk daily (5–10k steps if possible).
* Walk 10–15min after meals → helps with insulin.



# Random but important tips

* Pads/tampons → get 100% cotton, no bleach.
* Eat a big variety of veggies (fiber helps with digestion and guts like variety).
* A raw carrot in the morning helps with hormones.
* Avoid screens 1h before bed.
* Dairy & sugar make my acne worse, so I cut them \~90%.
* Bone broth = amazing superfood, if you can make it.
* If dieting, do it in follicular phase. In luteal, eat 300–500 kcal more.



# Extra little things:

* Eat breakfast within 60 min of waking. No coffee first thing → wait 30 min after food.
* If you wake up hungry = good sign.
* Drink green tea before coffee → smooths out the energy crash.
* Green tea daily = strong antioxidant.
* If you’re low on iron, avoid coffee/tea 30 min before & after meals.
* Meal order matters → veggies/fiber first, then fats/protein, carbs last.
* Don’t take iron supplements unless you really need to.

The attic smelled of dust and mothballs. Claire had never been up there before—she hated confined spaces—but the plumber insisted the leak traced back to something above her bedroom ceiling.

Behind a stack of old trunks, she found it: a thin leather-bound book, locked with a rusted clasp. The key dangled nearby on a yellowed string.

The diary’s first entry stopped her breath.

*June 12. He will spill coffee on you in the café. He will laugh, you will not. You will leave your scarf behind.*

It was written in her handwriting. Yet she had never owned the book.

The next day, June 12, a stranger collided with her at a coffee shop, coffee soaking her sleeve. He laughed nervously. She did not. And in her hurry to leave, she forgot her scarf.

Her hands shook as she flipped through the diary. Every page held more dates, more events. Things she hadn’t lived—yet.

The second entry:

*June 13. The power will flicker off at 9:16 p.m. You will be holding the knife. You will think of blood though none is there.*

That night, exactly at 9:16, her lights went black. She realized she was still holding the kitchen knife she had been drying. Her heart raced as she glanced at the blade gleaming in the dim emergency light.

The third entry:

*June 14. A child will wave at you from across the street. You will wave back, though the sidewalk is empty.*

On June 14, returning from work, she saw him—a boy in a red shirt across the street, smiling and waving. When she blinked, the sidewalk was bare.

The fourth entry:

*June 15. At 3:02 a.m., a man will whisper your name through the vent. You will not find him when you search.*

That night she startled awake. The sound was faint but unmistakable: *Claire…* drawn out, hushed, drifting up from the heating vent. Her pulse pounded as she tore through the apartment, but every door and window was locked.

The fifth entry:

*June 16. A shadow will pause at your bedroom door. You will pretend to sleep. It will know you are awake.*

She didn’t sleep at all on June 16. The diary lay on her nightstand, and just after midnight, she saw it: a long, dark silhouette, motionless in the doorway. She forced her breath slow, her eyes shut. Minutes passed before the air seemed to thin, and when she dared to peek, the doorway was empty.

The sixth entry:

*June 17. Your reflection will not follow you. You will notice too late.*

At work the next day, washing her hands in the restroom, she dropped the soap. When she bent to pick it up, her reflection stood still, watching.

The seventh entry, dated tomorrow:

*June 18. At 10:47 p.m., you will hear footsteps in the attic. You will think you are alone.*

Her heart thudded. That night, she barely slept. At 10:47 sharp, the floor above creaked. Deliberate, measured steps.

She climbed the stairs with a flashlight, clutching the diary against her chest. The beam caught the mirror propped against the far wall, its surface fogged with age.

Her reflection smiled before she did.

And then it whispered, in her own voice:

1) Fluorio (First name) Niglex (Last name) is a timid, shy guy that wants to be a hero. His quirk is ""Nuclear fire"" and with it he can create nuclear fire blasts using his hands, which can do a massive amount of damage to its surroundings. He can also use his quirk to heat his body, covering his whole body, or some parts, in a green translucent light, so that he can melt anything he comes in contact. His quirk is so powerful that sometimes it scares even him, and potentially, if he doesn't controll the heat temperature of his quirk and overheat, he can end up with burn marks. When he activate his quirk, his hair floats and turn into green nuclear fire. He can also use his quirk to fly, by generating a controlled and concentrated nuclear fire under his feet

2) Polunk (First name) Crulio (Last name) is a crocodile guy, and his quirk is ""Water Croc"", and with it he has all the abilities of a crocodile , and he can controll the water near him to create water construct or to make water attacks, and if he pour water on himself, he can get big and muscular, his teeth can also destroy anything (and sometimes with his smile he accidentally scares children). He likes training himself, because when he isn't near water, he is like a normal human sized crocodile guy, and want to overcome this weakness, hence why in his hero costume, he have two water tanks on his back, with tubes connected to his body (Kinda like Bane). Despite looking menacing sometimes, he is a real sweetheart, and he cares for anyone. Polunk is a friend of Tsuyu and decided to go at U.A. high, because he wants to be a hero that can save lives with his crazy power. Polunk's quirk is a heteromorph type.

3) Luna (First name) Seras (Last name), is a girl that most of the time is sleepy, with dark circles under the eyes, due to her quirk ""Dream Fighter"". Her quirk allow her to manifest a sentient yellow light figure from her body, every time she is asleep. Dream Fighter gets more powerful, the more asleep she is, and it can also grow in size if necessary. Basically Dream Fighter is the energetic side of Luna that she can't phisically show due to her always being sleepy. When she's asleep she can hear, see or feel what Dream Fighter is doing, because she is also in controll of her, and she can also speak through  her, while being asleep, and if someone manage to defeat Dream Fighter, Luna will have a rude awakening. Despite looking sleepy most of the time, Luna enjoy having fun with others, even if she is sleepy. She drinks lots of coffee, but even those aren't enough to keep her awake, and it will only make Dream Fighter more frenetic

4) Lirio (First name) Lamini (Last name) is a guy that possess an incredible quirk, called ""Slice"". His quirk allows the claw like blades, (one on both his forearms), to cut through anything, and even blast attacks or the space between him and an adversary, allowing him to kinda teleport wherever he made the slash near the adversary; he can also slash the air to get teleported ahead in a range of five meters, his claw like blades are also incredible durable. However, if he swing too much his arms he ends up insanely tired, since his quirk use a lot of stamina, and require a lot of speed and concentration, especially when he slice in multiple places, fast, causing to generate after images clones, created by his past movements (You know kinda like the thing that Goku does when he uses the istant trasmission and he creates after images) but he hasn't yet been able to master this technique, be he strive to be able to do that. He likes having fun with his friends, and having challenges that can put to the test his quirk. Lirio's quirk is a mutation type, he is born like this, and he loves doing ""cutting"" puns

5) Rigiko (first name) Keido (last name) is a cheerfull girl that posess an incredible quirk ""Glass Reflection"". By turning her body, or parts of it into glass, any type of attack that is thrown at her, if it gets reflected in her glass parts, she can reflect the attack, by generate an exact copy of the attack from her glass part. The only limit are the fact that she can't reflect attacks bigger than her, and that she can't reflect soundwaves attacks. She is a cute girl, with an amazing fighting spirit, she won't back down most of the time

1nfqurd,https://i.redd.it/1zf66apxrvof1.png,What Are Contextual Commerce Payments?,"Contextual commerce is a type of eCommerce where customers can make purchases within the context of an activity—without being explicitly directed to a checkout page. Contextual payments are the transactions that occur in this environment, happening seamlessly in the background. No direct checkout interaction is needed; instead, payments are triggered by processing logic that uses prior customer consent and contextual data.



This data can include geolocation, biometrics, sensors, or computer vision to determine when and how much to charge, which merchant account to use, and which payment instrument to apply.



Contextual payments are a subset of embedded payments. While embedded payments integrate payment capabilities directly into an app or site, contextual payments go further—making the experience user-centric by fitting naturally into what the consumer is already doing.



👉 Examples:



🔹 Walk-out retail technology: Sensors, AI, and computer vision track items a consumer takes from shelves. When the customer leaves, the system automatically charges a pre-enrolled payment method.



🔹 Smart appliances: A refrigerator detects when groceries are low and reorders them automatically using stored payment details.



In both cases, payments occur in the background, leveraging pre-approved credentials. Consumers don’t pull out a card, open an app, or manually authorize a transaction. Instead, contextual triggers initiate seamless payments using stored credentials, ensuring convenience and reducing friction.



These payments thrive in IoT ecosystems—smart devices across homes, vehicles, and wearables. A smart home, for example, might order groceries or adjust services automatically, routing the payment from device → merchant → processor → issuer for approval, with no user intervention required.



A step beyond this is agentic commerce. Here, AI “agents” manage contextual payments with predictive intelligence. These agents apply learned preferences—such as loyalty points, transport choices, or habitual purchases—without the consumer needing to take action.



👉 Example:



When booking a flight, an agent could automatically use rewards for a hotel stay, pre-book a preferred rideshare for airport transport, and even order a coffee at a café along the traveler’s route. All decisions reflect prior behavior, context, and stored preferences.



While agentic commerce adds intelligence and convenience, it also introduces challenges in security, consent management, and user trust. Still, it highlights the direction contextual payments are heading: from seamless to predictive, from reactive to proactive.

- big cafe where upwards of 15-20 people can sit 
- hilariously expensive tourist and hipster cafés where a coffee costs more than a full on 3 course meal just because I get a cool flower on my cappucino

What I am looking for:
- the embodiment of grandma's living room (in a positive way)
- a cozy Café that gives off a warm, welcoming vibe
- focus is on coffee and maybe some bakery stuff to eat (not mandatory) 
- maybe nice view
- small cafe (optimal for 5-15 people)
- fairly priced

Sitting all day at a desk seems harmless until you notice how stiff, achy, or cramped your feet feel when you finally get up. I never realized how much tension I held in my toes until I started using toe separators and building a quick 10-minute routine around them. What surprised me most is how something small like this has ripple effects: less tension in my ankles, better circulation during walks, and a clear reminder that our feet really do carry everything.  

Here’s the simple rhythm I’ve been sticking to lately:  

- Slip on **[Toe Alignment Comfort Correctors](https://shopvibemart.com/products/toe-alignment-comfort-corrector%E2%84%A2)** for about 5 minutes while still answering emails.  
- Use that time to gently move feet side-to-side under the desk to wake up those smaller stabilizing muscles.  
- Stand up after, do light calf raises to pump blood flow (20 slow reps).  
- End with 2 minutes of barefoot stretches, like spreading toes on the floor and balancing.  

It all takes less than one coffee break.  

What I find most interesting is how the idea of “alignment” spills over beyond the feet. Over time, working with toe separators seems to make me more aware of posture, balance, and gait. When shoes squish toes all day, no wonder our bodies compensate higher up in the knees, hips, even back. Giving space to the feet with something small like the **[Toe Alignment Comfort Corrector](https://shopvibemart.com/products/toe-alignment-comfort-corrector%E2%84%A2)** feels like literally giving space to the rest of the body too.  

Some other things I’ve noticed so far:  
- Different shoes matter. Minimal or wider toe-box shoes feel much better afterwards.  
- Desk breaks are underrated. Just standing up with separators in makes the stretch more real.  
- Toe strength feels niche, but it oddly applies to hiking, running, and even balance doing yoga.  

Experimenting with these little nudges to daily routine—like using the **[Toe Alignment Comfort Corrector](https://shopvibemart.com/products/toe-alignment-comfort-corrector%E2%84%A2)**—isn’t some miracle cure. But it’s that kind of quiet, sustainable practice that adds up before you realize it.  

If anyone else has experimented with toe separators, desk stretches, or wide-toe shoes, I’d love to hear your results. Especially curious if anyone’s noticed improvements outside of just their feet.  

Do your toes ever feel quietly neglected while you’re stuck at the desk—and would giving them 10 minutes a day completely reframe how your body feels?

These could be signs that your body needs more water. Let's talk about dryness and dehydration in simple terms.

# What Is Dehydration?

Dehydration happens when your body loses more water than it gets. Think of your body like a plant. When a plant doesn't get enough water, it starts to wilt. Your body does something similar.

You lose water every day through sweating, breathing, and using the bathroom. If you don't replace that water, your body starts to struggle.

# How Does This Affect Your Skin?

Your skin needs water to stay healthy and soft. When you don't drink enough, your skin is one of the first places you'll notice it.

Dry skin feels tight and looks dull. It might even flake or feel rough to touch. This happens because your body sends water to important organs like your heart and brain first. Your skin gets what's left over.

# Simple Signs to Watch For

Your body gives you clues when it needs more water:

* Feeling thirsty
* Dark yellow pee (it should be light yellow)
* Dry mouth
* Headaches
* Feeling tired
* Skin that stays tented when you gently pinch it

If you have any of these signs, it's time to drink more water.

# Why Does This Happen?

Many things can cause dehydration:

* Hot weather makes you sweat more
* Being sick with fever
* Not drinking enough during the day
* Drinking too much coffee or alcohol
* Spending time in dry places with heating or air conditioning

Some people need more water than others. If you exercise a lot or live somewhere hot, you need extra water.

# Easy Ways to Stay Hydrated

Keeping your body hydrated doesn't have to be hard:

**Drink water throughout the day.** Don't wait until you feel thirsty. Keep a water bottle with you and take small sips regularly.

**Eat water-rich foods.** Fruits like watermelon, oranges, and grapes have lots of water. So do vegetables like cucumber and lettuce.

**Drink more when you need it.** Exercise, hot weather, and being sick all mean you need extra water.

**Check your pee.** Light yellow means you're doing well. Dark yellow means drink more water.

# When Your Environment Makes It Worse

Sometimes the air around you make dehydration worse. Dry air pulls water from your skin and lungs. This happens in winter with heating and summer with air conditioning.

Even flying in planes can dehydrate you because the air inside is very dry.

# Getting Better Takes Time

If you've been dehydrated, don't expect to feel better right away. Your body needs time to balance out again. You might feel more energetic within a few days, but your skin might take weeks to look and feel better.

The important thing is to keep drinking water consistently.

# Making It a Habit

The best way to avoid dehydration is to make drinking water a regular habit:

* Keep water where you can see it
* Set phone reminders if you forget
* Drink a glass of water when you wake up
* Have water with every meal

Remember, your body is always telling you what it needs. When you listen and give it enough water, you'll feel better, and your skin will thank you.

**How much water should I drink each day?** 

Most adults need about 8 glasses of water daily, but this can vary. If you exercise, live in a hot place, or are sick, you need more. The best guide is your urine color aim for light yellow.

**Can I drink too much water?** 

Yes, but it's rare. Drinking way too much water too fast can be dangerous. Stick to sipping water throughout the day rather than drinking huge amounts at once.

**Why is my skin still dry even when I drink lots of water?** 

Skin dryness can have many causes beyond dehydration. Harsh soaps, hot showers, dry air, and some skin conditions can all cause dryness. If drinking more water doesn't help after a few weeks, consider other factors.

**Are sports drinks better than water for hydration?** 

For most people doing normal activities, plain water is perfect. You only need sports drinks if you're exercising hard for more than an hour or sweating a lot. Otherwise, water is the best choice.",0,1757746315.0,CUETards,1,0.5,False

At the zoo, the monkey enclosure smells awful until you’ve been inside a while. Your nose adjusts, and when new people wrinkle their nose you go, *“It’s not that bad.”* The phrase means you’ve grown used to something unpleasant and stopped noticing the stink.

After binge watching every season of from 1 through 21, I think the show’s powers-that-be are in the monkey house... so used to their own formula that's its situationally impossible to smell what’s gone stale. The show has changed dramatically in so many ways, that it seems like it's losing the plot.

I’m sharing a few back to basics ideas with enough self-awareness of the need to balance entertaining an audience, with generating substantial amounts of revenue.

This is a long one 😅 **TL;DR:** I’m putting this into the universe fantasizing that someone connected to *The Block* sees my idea.

To test that fantasy, my Easter Egg is requesting a specific song play in a future episode. The song is Timbaland & LL Cool J’s “Headsprung.” A backup song if that's not possible is Lindsay Lohan's ""Bossy"". **Why I thought of those two songs, I have no idea.** They're so random, but I can confidently rule out ""coincidence"" if I hear it one during an episode. That'd be cool.

Anyway, here's a idea for the Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday episode format:

\----

**Monday – Build episode.** Introducing the **Foreman Walkthroughs** 🆕

[Monday - Dan chats the build with the contestant and builder over a McCafe coffee](https://preview.redd.it/n4v02kthhtof1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=4532a9bb5d02398a56c5d5c2cd10539c2969717d)

**Start Monday w/ open for inspections** of the *previous* room like usual.

**But now** Mondays have **The McCafe Foreman Walkthrough** 🛠️ *(new segment)*

* Dan + a guest (e.g., a plumber like Tom for bathroom week, Safety Cam)
* It's exactly like the **Scotty & Shelly** walkthrough but **build-focused. Not styling.**

**Sponsor Revenue** ☕

* Contestants can highlight Beacon. Stegbar, Reece, Kinsman wardrobes etc.
* Generate *McCafe cash* early and naturally *💸* with Dan sharing a Monday morning McCafe coffee... not by **jumping on trampolines** together like in S21E28 🥴 that made no sense at all and was a blatant sponsor neccesity.

**Audience Takeaway**: Gutted rooms, building, the basics: demo, lighting plans, room size

\---

**Tuesday – the Design and Styling Episode** \+ Dan & Dani  🆕

[Tuesday - Audience sees interior design, the budget, new styles, trends, local artists](https://preview.redd.it/j0xvq0sdutof1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=d204933cac8ddca3f607fcb2f93b8e35e62b1a71)

**Tuesday** transitions from the Monday **build focused** episode to the **design episode.** These can be bridged by incorporating the **Dan & Dani walkthroughs** into the show💡 recapping a finished room and showing the cohesion of the builds current room to the previous.

This also creates a 3-fold-opinion on the previous room with **NEW** footage each episode.

Think about it, if **Sunday** is the judges opinion of **styling**. **Monday** is the contestants opinion of **their competition**. Tuesday is the **foreman's opinion** of the **build quality** during Dan and Dani.

**Tuesday Episode is all** **design, shopping, and budget**. Contestants explain *why* each choice fits the target market, what their design aesthetic is and why it supports creating a bidding war at auction.

**Budget Breakdown** 💸 Track running totals: remaining funds, cost per decision

**Audience Takeaway**: Design, staging and how it increases perceived value of a room.

\----

**Wednesday – Build + Design** = Scotty and Shelly

[Wednesday Scotty and Shelly checking in on the build and styling](https://preview.redd.it/b4tivaurvtof1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ec75a5ac22990882bba3fc7d7f869c9c1a80d97)

Wednesday's **Scotty & Shelly walkthrough is the best episode of the week, hands down,** second to judging.

* This episode should have lots of **animation** use 📐 helping the viewers visualize all of the working components of what makes a room valuable.
* Animate the room, size, sunlight aspect, total cost, sponsors etc.
* On Wednesday the audience is shopping **and** building with the each house.

\---

Sunday – **Tools Down & Judges’ Reveal** 🎉

[Tools down](https://preview.redd.it/u1n6yrk0ytof1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=40d5fc03e3b6dbe6458a0538764e7ddd76e69a3b)

Sunday should be a celebration day! It's the best episode 🥳💡 Not a repeat of Monday Tuesday and Wednesday.

After tools down, show **unseen footage**, **outtakes**, and bloopers during the **“Week That Was”**

>For example. Scotty can say, ""House 1 kicked of the week walking through a master plan with Foreman Dan (show Monday clip), but what you didn't see was (unseen clip) that led to (all new footage). House 1 is aiming for a (type of design style) hoping it gets them the win this week and increases the value of the house on auction day because of (why someone would want the house).

>Unseen Scotty and Shelly footage, blooper, outtake.  
Then textbook time lapse footage of the room being build from stud all the way to styling  
Boom: the door opens, the judges enter the completed room

\---

**THINGS TO RECONSIDER: The Couch interviews 😑**

Having contestants narrate the episode from the couch breaks the time continuum.

So, this is the **very first** couch interview **ever**. Season 12. *If someone finds* a *one earlier, please let me know.*

https://preview.redd.it/3d63skqkqvof1.png?width=2846&format=png&auto=webp&s=646957476b42dac1a8cc6cca093b12c175a36d9a

Before I rant, I realize producers face filming constraints: sponsor screen time, and respecting contestant mental health means all-nighters and wake-up shots are gone.

However, somewhere, someone suggested: *“Let’s film* ***all*** *weekly sound bites on a couch and then use that to narrate the entire episode.”* And that person, should be fired immediately.

That choice, changed the show into one long recap.

Mind you. ""Post-judging"" reactions are expected. Earlier seasons had reactions in the car after judging, or standing in a hallway etc.

But now, THE COUCH dominates **entire episodes**, even starting within minutes. The entirety of the episode is watching people speak about... the past. We the viewer are no longer, **there.**

https://preview.redd.it/hyqlme8pqvof1.png?width=2868&format=png&auto=webp&s=c538522c1953c11e1bf462613e4198b1a4a47903

Take **Season 21, Episode 25 (rumpus room reveal) for example**:

* At **4:12**, Han and Can say, *“the room is not painted,”* then calmly discuss their first argument while we cut back to footage of the argument itself.
* The producer asks, *“Are you confident you can win the room?” and they say no... presumably after they* already *won 🤔*... so when is this moment? Post tools-down? Pre-judging? Mid-build? If mid-build, the build can't be **that** difficult if you scrubbed up and calmed down to film this... so why are they speaking in **present tense** about the **past** footage? The whole thing is a time continuum, amateur mess.

The timeline collapses.

https://preview.redd.it/wep5o9drqvof1.png?width=2092&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdca0ee664cf140e1b3c6b3d8bf8876947207616

On THE COUCH... they also have the **same hair and makeup as judging** but are in totally **different clothes**. It's a stitched-together recap masquerading as real time, very obviously.

https://preview.redd.it/yxxp4uiifuof1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab19a0dadd33bef4b307591bad8193a8d2766779

One moment they’re in chaos trying to fit a TrueCore frame through the door; the next they’re perfectly composed on the couch. SO YEAH, it obviously worked out.

It’s jarring to jump from high-stakes tension ➡️ calm couch recap ➡️ back to tension.

The suspense drains away because we know the crisis is already solved. Our narrators are not exhausted.

This constant cutaway turns *The Block* from a **reality competition into a documentary**... a show about what already happened, not what’s unfolding now.

Let's work this out:

After ""tools-down"", we head to Scotty’s shed, get into full glam, film THE COUCH, **change into new clothes, and then** attend judging? Even if its vice-versa... for what?

The couch interviews remove the ""reality"" from ""reality tv"".

**THEN VS NOW: Visually**

The show actually **looked** different. Past contestants had personalities and made mistakes. They were relatable.

The show focused on **their** unique style and how it was implemented into the design of house.

\---

**If the couch stays, reconsider the camera angle:** It's the worst angle in the world. Gives the viewer the perspective of a marriage counselor or a broken-eye-contact visit to the shrink.

Someone's feet is always up in my face!

After binging all of the Block seasons, it been sad to watch the show go from

>""Wow! You design a house, work hard and potentially make tons of money at an auction on this show 🤯?!""  
**to**  
""Wait... they didn't get to choose their own kitchens 🤨?""

I hope the show figures out it's in the money house.

**If you made it this far, thank you, and I'll leave you with this:**

1nfqons,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Emmaolivy/comments/1nfqons/seo_services_in_oklahoma_driving_local_businesses/,SEO Services in Oklahoma: Driving Local Businesses Toward Digital Success,"In today’s competitive digital landscape, having a website is no longer enough to guarantee business growth. For businesses in Oklahoma, search engine optimization (SEO) has become one of the most effective ways to increase visibility, attract potential customers, and build long-term credibility. SEO services in Oklahoma are tailored not only to help companies rank higher on Google but also to connect with their target audiences within specific local markets. Whether you run a small retail store in Tulsa, a law firm in Oklahoma City, or a service-based business in Norman, the right SEO strategy can elevate your online presence and generate consistent leads.

SEO agencies in Oklahoma understand the unique dynamics of the local market. Unlike generic digital marketing services, local SEO focuses on optimizing websites for location-based searches, ensuring that when customers type in phrases like “plumber near me” or “best coffee shop in Oklahoma City,” your business stands a strong chance of appearing on the first page of results. These services typically include keyword research, content creation, on-page optimization, technical audits, and backlink building, all with a focus on the Oklahoma customer base. Additionally, optimizing Google Business Profiles, managing online reviews, and ensuring consistent local citations are critical aspects that help businesses rank well in local search. **For more:** [**seo services oklahoma**](https://LeadSupport.net)

One of the major benefits of SEO services in Oklahoma is their ability to level the playing field. Small and medium-sized businesses often compete with larger corporations, but with a well-structured SEO campaign, even a small family-owned business can dominate search rankings in its niche. For example, a boutique in Tulsa that invests in professional SEO can outperform national retail chains in local searches by targeting highly relevant keywords and optimizing for user intent. This cost-effective marketing approach allows businesses to gain long-term visibility without constantly paying for expensive ads. Over time, a solid SEO strategy yields compounding benefits, generating organic traffic that continues to grow.

Another key aspect of SEO services in Oklahoma is the integration of content marketing. Search engines reward websites that provide valuable, engaging, and original content. Local agencies often craft blogs, guides, and location-specific landing pages that not only help with rankings but also build trust with potential customers. For instance, a roofing company in Oklahoma City could publish articles about “how to prepare your roof for Oklahoma storms,” targeting a specific problem relevant to local residents. This strategy positions the business as an authority in its field while simultaneously boosting its search visibility. With the rise of mobile search, voice search, and AI-driven search engines, SEO content tailored for Oklahoma users ensures businesses stay ahead of evolving digital trends.

Ultimately, SEO services in Oklahoma are not just about rankings—they are about growth, visibility, and customer trust. Businesses that invest in SEO are better equipped to adapt to changes in consumer behavior and online technology. By working with an experienced SEO agency, Oklahoma businesses can ensure their websites are optimized for both search engines and users, resulting in higher traffic, more leads, and increased revenue. As more customers turn to Google and other search engines to make buying decisions, the importance of SEO cannot be overstated. For business owners across Oklahoma, SEO is not just a marketing strategy—it is a long-term investment in digital success.",1,1757746297.0,u_Emmaolivy,0,1.0,False

I’m not in a rush though—I’m just here for something casual, light, and genuine. Sometimes all we really need is someone to talk to without pressure, someone to share random thoughts with, or maybe even someone to grab coffee with while the city hums around us.

I’m 32,raised in the North but currently in Manila for a few days (work brings me here often). By day, I’m a corporate trainer—the type who talks a lot for a living, notices when people don’t follow simple instructions 😅, and finds joy in helping others grow. Outside of work, I’m a mix of old soul and curious adventurer. I like long walks (the overthinking kind), quiet dinners, unplanned road trips, and conversations that make hours feel like minutes.

I’ve always been the dependable one—the ate of the group, the extra snacks and tissue provider, the emotional support human. Lately though, I’m learning to slow down, to enjoy being in the moment instead of always running on duty mode. That’s why I’m here—not to force anything, but to see what connections can happen naturally.

If you’re 29 and up, grounded, and someone who enjoys easy conversations without rushing into labels, we’ll get along just fine. I like people who have their own hobbies, carry quiet confidence, and know how to hold space for others.

No pressure, no games—just two people seeing if good company still exists in this messy, busy world. If you’re up for it, tell me your favorite movie. Who knows? Maybe our stories match. ✨",1,1757746140.0,singleph,0,0.99,False

2. **AI Summary:** An AI instantly generates a concise summary and a clear list of action items with owners.
3. **Sync to PM:** These action items are automatically created as tasks in our project management tool (we use Notion, but it works with Asana, ClickUp, etc.).

1nfqmi5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nudism/comments/1nfqmi5/nudist_or_exhibitionist_or_both/,Nudist or Exhibitionist or Both?,"I entered into an interesting debate about nudism with my girlfriend's family last weekend. I have considered myself a nudist for a few years and live it as much as practically possible while being a twenty-something guy still living at home.  My girlfriend is not into  nudity as much as I am meaning she likes to strip down with me when we are alone. She will occasionally go to the nude beach but will arrange the sun umbrella and beach blanket so as to appear more  an infantry soldier in a foxhole than a sunworshipper on the sand.

My girlfriend and I were watching a movie with her family which contained a few rather graphic nude beach scenes. This brought chuckles and laughs from her parents who likely have never been to a nude beach. My girlfriend and I said nothing because we have experienced the real thing while her older sister had a big grin on her face.

The mother turned to me with a mischievous smirk and said, ""Hey, you're a nudist so perhaps you should take your clothes off.""

My girlfriend had obviously discussed my lifestyle with them which was a subject  I was not yet prepared to reveal or knew how to broach. The mother's tone was teasing which brought a snort from the father.

""Yes, take it off. Take it all off, right here in front of us. I really want to see it,"" the sister added in a laughing voice.

""Go on, do it,"" my girlfriend said.

I believe my girlfriend and her sister wanted me to strip but the parents were obviously mocking both me and the nudist lifestyle. I calmly explained that nudism is something enjoyed in a private setting or openly with others in a designated location such as a nude beach or resort. You do not see nude people in church, I told them, nor do nudists continually walk around buck naked until the snow flies.

My girlfriend's mother said this was complete bullshit. She explained that some vegetarians belong to her church and she sees them at the breakfast book club meetings and the monthly dinners in the church hall and they simply do not eat meat. They don't chomp down half a sausage or bite off a corner of the bacon strip. If they did, they were not really vegetarians. She continued to explain that someone wearing clothes and claiming to be a nudist was really an exhibitionist who liked to flash his goods where he would not get into trouble.

All I could do at this point was to rub a hand over the top of my head in frustration and try to think of a comeback to her simplistic reasoning. She had boxed me into a corner: take my clothes off, I am an exhibitionist; remained clothed , I am an exhibitionist. She was teasing, of course, because she had a big shit eating grin on her face yet her cheeks were flushed which i assumed was her thinking of me nude.

My girlfriend was grinning at me and nudging me with her elbow to get naked. I was sixty percent convinced to do it but the smug look on the parents' faces were the  holding me back. And fear. I was afraid to take my clothes off in front of them. From where did my fear arise and why did part of me want to rip my clothes off for them? Because I was an exhibitionist uncomfortable with humiliation. Apparently the old girl was right on target in her jest.

A nude beach scene reappeared on the television screen depicting a naked, chubby guy with a flaccid penis walking along the water's edge. Two nude and unnaturally perfect women were walking toward the man and the expression on his face was one of complete bewilderment. The movie was about a nerdy guy who somehow began associating with a group of young, hip people.

""Are there nude beaches around here? You go to them? Do you strut around naked like that? Does it actually wobble when you walk?"" My girlfriend's sister was firing off her questions in machinegun precision. She was flicking her wrist to make her hand imitate a flaccid penis swaying back and forth.

I looked at my girlfriend before answering. Her face had gone pale. She did not want her family to know she had gone to those beaches with me.

""There are three nude beaches nearby,"" I replied. ""They are a bit of a drive and it will take most of the day with the driving. but it is doable. They are usually crowded because there are a lot of people who enjoy being naked at the beach. And yes, my dick probably wobbles and bobs as I walk. I don't really know, I don't look at as I strut up and down the beach. Some women's boobs wobble as they walk. And you don't see vaginas, women are built that way. Sometimes, yes, the way they are sitting. Maybe you should come with us sometime.""

The three of them arched their eyebrows in surprise. my girlfriend jammed her elbow into my ribs. I had said too much. The father swung his head around to look at his youngest daughter while his oldest daughter brought a hand to her mouth to stifle a laugh.

'This conversation is over,"" my girlfriend said.

'Do her boobs wobble?"" the sister laughingly asked.

I looked at the mother and said, ""I get home from work about eight o'clock so if you want to have coffee with my mother some morning I will show you what nudism is about. Perhaps you will like what you see. The nudism, I mean. Maybe you will appreciate the feelings of complete freedom.""

The mother opened her mouth to say something but remained silent. Her face turned beet red and a an expression came over her face that will stick with me for years. For a few seconds she had envisioned the two of us naked together and nudism was not the only item on her menu.",8,1757746074.0,nudism,2,0.84,False

I've recently had a little more time to myself and I've just been looking for some friends. I workout a lot, and I game. Been doing some photography,and learning cinematography here.

1nfqifv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroTo10k/comments/1nfqifv/pod_merch/,POD Merch,"ZeroTo10k Playbook – Guide #4: Print-on-Demand Merch
Earn $500–$5,000+/month selling designs without inventory
——————————————————————————
Why This Works:
Print-on-demand (POD) lets you upload designs, and third-party services print + ship products directly to customers. You don’t buy stock upfront, so it’s zero risk. The market is massive: t-shirts, mugs, stickers, posters, phone cases, tote bags. The winners aren’t big “brands,” they’re niche designs that speak to communities, trends, or identities.
👉 Think of POD like a digital vending machine. You create the design once, upload it, and whenever someone orders, the vendor prints + ships. You get paid without touching the product.
——————————————————————————
Tools You’ll Need:
Design: Canva, Kittl, Photoshop, MidJourney/DALL·E (for unique art).
Mockups: Placeit (realistic product previews).
POD Providers: Printify, Printful, Teespring, Redbubble.
Stores: Etsy, Shopify, Amazon Merch.
Marketing: TikTok/IG Reels (viral niche designs), Pinterest, Twitter.
Optional:
Keyword Tools: eRank, Marmalead (for Etsy SEO).
AI Assistants: ChatGPT for slogans, MidJourney for graphics.
——————————————————————————
Step 1: Pick a Profitable Niche
Forget generic designs — “funny t-shirt” won’t sell. You need specific communities. Examples:
Hobbies/Communities: Rock climbing, chess, fishing, gaming, gym.
Professions: Nurses, teachers, firefighters, programmers.
Pop Culture: Parody phrases, memes, trending events (but avoid copyrighted stuff).
Emotions/Identity: Mental health awareness, astrology signs, hometown pride.
Seasonal: Holidays (Christmas sweaters, Halloween mugs).
The smaller + more passionate the niche, the better. 
——————————————————————————
Step 2: Create Killer Designs
Use ChatGPT to brainstorm phrases: “Give me 50 funny gym t-shirt slogans.”
Use Canva/Kittl to apply stylish typography + graphics.
Use MidJourney for unique art concepts.
Keep designs simple, bold, and readable from 6 feet away.
Generate 10–20 variations fast → upload across products.
Pro tip: One phrase can live on a t-shirt, hoodie, tote bag, mug, AND sticker = 5 products from one idea.
——————————————————————————
Step 3: Upload & Sell
Etsy: Best for organic traffic. Optimize listings with SEO titles:
Bad: “Funny T-shirt.”
Good: “Funny Nurse Shirt – Coffee Before Charts – Medical Apparel.”
Shopify + Printify/Printful: Higher control, but you need to drive traffic.
Redbubble/Teespring: Plug-and-play POD marketplaces (lower margins but no ads needed).
Amazon Merch on Demand: Massive traffic if approved.
Pricing:
T-shirt: $20–$30 (you keep $5–$10 profit).
Mugs: $15–$20 (you keep $3–$6).
Hoodies: $40–$60 (you keep $10–$15).
——————————————————————————
Step 4: Marketing for Sales
TikTok/Instagram Reels: Post short clips like “Funny shirts only nurses understand” → show design. Viral potential = free sales.
Pinterest: Post mockups → link back to Etsy/Shopify.
Twitter: Jump on trending hashtags with parody designs.
Email List: Capture buyers on Etsy → send them future drops.
💡 Hack: Upload seasonal designs months early. Example: Christmas sweaters in September. This way they rank before the rush.
——————————————————————————
Step 5: Scale Like a Business
Test 100+ designs → double down on winners.
Launch bundles (5-shirt packs for teams/families).
Expand niches (if nurses work, try doctors, pharmacists, EMTs).
Hire cheap designers (Fiverr/Upwork) to scale designs while you just upload.
Create a Shopify store → brand identity → run TikTok/FB ads on bestsellers.
——————————————————————————
Pro Tips:
Design Testing Hack: Post designs as memes on TikTok/IG first → see which ones get likes/comments → turn winners into POD products.
SEO is King: On Etsy, include keywords in title + tags + description. Use keyword tools like eRank.
Niche Layering: Don’t just do “funny gym shirt.” Do “funny powerlifting gym dad shirt.” The more layered, the better.
Evergreen + Seasonal Combo: Have designs that sell year-round (nurses, gym) + seasonal drops (Halloween, Christmas, graduations).
Customer Reviews: Add a “thank you” card in orders with a QR code → links to review page. Reviews = more sales.
——————————————————————————
Earning Potential:
Starter: 50 sales at $10 profit = $500.
Mid-level: 300–500 sales/month = $2,000–$5,000.
Advanced: Scaling ads + Shopify branding = $10k+/month.

I came across this photo while browsing AliExpress reviews for the **MAVO Phantox Pro hand grinder** (which I’m currently considering). The grinder itself looks solid, but what really caught my attention was this **silicone/rubber grip ring** around the body.

I’ve been searching everywhere online, but I can’t find anything similar for sale. It doesn’t show up on AliExpress, Amazon, or any coffee gear sites I’ve checked. Now I’m wondering:

* Is this an aftermarket accessory that someone sells somewhere?
* Or maybe it’s a **custom 3D-printed piece with silicone material**?
* Has anyone here seen or made something like this to personalize their grinder?

I’d love to get one to improve grip and make my grinder more unique. Any leads, ideas, or experiences with custom grips for manual grinders would be super helpful!

So I (32M) have been seeing this girl (32F) for a bit over a month now. We spoke for a few days before our first date, which was going to see a movie. She initiated contact on that date, and we ended up driving around for a few hours afterward — it went well.

We kept up daily contact with lots of flirting and sharing life experiences. I saw her again about a week later, three days in a row. Two of those were lunch/coffee meetups during her breaks, and the third was another movie night. Again, there was lots of contact and hugging — but still no kiss at that point.

She then invited me over to her house to watch some movies. We ended up having sex and making out a lot. I stayed for a bit afterward, cuddling, but I wanted to leave before morning so I wouldn’t be there when her kids woke up.

She seemed over the moon about how everything was going — and I felt the same. We were still talking daily, late into the night. Then she got into a video game (she’s not usually a gamer), and she’d go hours without contacting me because she got so distracted. That’s fine, I get it, and we had a full-day date planned while her kids were at school.

Fast forward to that day: we slept together again, and she was saying how amazing I am and how she didn’t expect something like this from a dating app. I was ecstatic — we really vibed, and it was a great day. She even asked me to stay and meet her kids, but I had work and had to go. I told her I’d love to meet them eventually.

After that day, though, she got noticeably colder. She still said she missed me sometimes, but she’d disappear into gaming for long periods. Her replies got shorter, and the flirty/cutesy messages stopped. I started to worry but played it cool.

She then had a super stressful week at work. She vented to me a few times over the phone, and I helped her through it — she was all loving again. But once she got home and jumped back into gaming, the coldness returned.

Then, Wednesday night, she called me. We talked for two hours about life. She apologized for being distant and said she was trying not to self-sabotage. She said she was using the game as a distraction and told me not to worry — I’m not just some “flavour of the month,” as she put it. She also assured me she isn’t talking to anyone else and repeated how amazing I am. She mentioned that she’s been single for a long time and is scared of losing her independence.

I reassured her that I wasn’t there to take away her independence — just to add value to her life — and that while it’s always scary at the beginning, it’s worth it. She agreed and seemed really happy.

Since that call, though, it’s been crickets. She still messages me, but it’s short and lacks substance. There are hints of the old texting style, but they’re few and far between. I’ve been trying to give her space.

We’re meant to catch up (no solid plans yet), and now the weekend is here, but her messages are still cold and the vibe feels off. But I could just be overreacting and anxious.

How should I proceed? Give her more space? We’re not exclusive, but we’ve had the chat and agreed we’re not talking to anyone else.

It’s taking everything in me not to message her and ask if everything’s alright. She’s online — not on social media, but I can see she’s gaming.

TLDR: been seeing girl for a bit over a month, things were going amazingly we've seen each other a heap and she was super into texting/snapping. Now she seems a bit cold after a deep phone conversation about us. Not sure how to proceed?",2,1757745049.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

A well-chosen dining table not only adds charm but also withstands daily wear, high footfall, and frequent cleaning. India’s furniture industry is booming with manufacturers who blend tradition, craftsmanship, and modern engineering to create hotel dining tables for every kind of project—from luxury resorts to functional staff canteens.

Here we highlight the **Top 8 Hotel Dining Table Furniture Manufacturers in India**. The list begins with one of the most recognized names, followed by seven rising players who may not yet have strong online visibility but deliver reliable solutions for hospitality projects.

# 1. Best of Exports: The Leader in Hotel Dining Furniture

Based in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Best of Exports is widely acknowledged as one of the leading [Hotel Dining Table](https://bestofexports.com/hotel-furniture/hotel-table/dining-tables/) furniture manufacturers in India. Since its establishment, the company has carved out a reputation for producing **export-quality dining furniture** that balances aesthetics, durability, and cost efficiency.

# Why They Stand Out

* **Quality & Durability**: Their dining tables are crafted with solid wood, treated metals, marble, and other premium materials designed for heavy commercial use. This ensures long service life even in hotels, where furniture faces continuous traffic.
* **Global Standards**: With an export-oriented approach, they adopt stringent quality checks, robust packaging methods, and international certifications. Hotels receive products that are not only elegant but also reliable and safe.
* **Customization Options**: Best of Exports understands that each hotel has a unique brand identity. Whether it’s a rustic resort theme, an industrial-style café, or a modern luxury dining hall, they offer tailor-made solutions in terms of sizes, finishes, and materials.
* **Design Versatility**: Their catalog includes everything from minimalistic modern pieces to vintage colonial designs. This flexibility allows hotel owners and interior designers to maintain a consistent theme across spaces.

**Client Benefits**

Working with Best of Exports is more than buying furniture—it’s a partnership. Hotels gain access to bulk supply capacity, timely deliveries, and after-sales service. Their wide project experience, both within India and overseas, assures clients of consistency and trust.

For hotels that need **statement dining tables that impress guests while standing the test of time**, Best of Exports is the benchmark.

# 2. Shree Swastik Furniture

Shree Swastik Furniture is a reliable name in the hospitality sector, particularly for projects that demand value without compromising on sturdiness. Their hotel dining tables are practical, durable, and well-suited for mid-scale hotels and banquet halls.

* **Strengths**: Affordable bulk solutions, contemporary designs, and good lead times.
* **Best For**: Hotels that need strong, functional dining tables for everyday use while keeping costs under control.

# 3. Sankheda Furniture

Sankheda Furniture brings traditional artistry from Gujarat into the hospitality world. Known for its vibrant lacquer work and hand-painted detailing on teakwood, Sankheda dining tables are **heritage pieces** that instantly elevate a hotel’s ambience.

* **Strengths**: Culturally rich, handmade designs that are visually striking. Perfect for boutique hotels and heritage resorts.
* **Best For**: Hotels aiming to highlight Indian tradition, add a local touch, or create a royal dining experience.

# 4. Varsha Kitchen

Primarily known for commercial kitchen equipment, Varsha Kitchen also manufactures dining furniture designed for functionality and durability. Their tables are popular in hotel canteens, cafeterias, and staff dining areas.

* **Strengths**: Sturdy builds, hygienic surfaces, and easy-to-clean designs.
* **Best For**: Hotels needing reliable tables for high-volume use in back-of-house dining or staff zones.

# 5. Ampre Hospitality

Ampre Hospitality specializes in creating furniture tailored to the needs of the hospitality sector. Their dining tables reflect a balance of **style and utility**, with the flexibility to handle bulk orders for hotels and resorts.

* **Strengths**: Custom project experience, scalable production, and adaptability in design.
* **Best For**: Resorts, banquet halls, and hotels needing personalized furniture solutions.

# 6. The Coffee Concept

The Coffee Concept is a niche player focusing on café and restaurant furniture. They design compact, stylish dining tables that are well-suited for smaller hotel dining areas, lounges, and coffee shops.

* **Strengths**: Modern, trendy designs with quick production timelines.
* **Best For**: Hotels with café corners, lobby lounges, or outdoor coffee spaces.

# 7. CocktailKompany

CocktailKompany is known for chic and modern furniture with an urban vibe. Their hotel dining tables often combine wood, glass, and metal for a contemporary look, making them a good fit for upscale restaurants and bars inside hotels.

* **Strengths**: Trend-driven designs that appeal to younger audiences and modern hospitality brands.
* **Best For**: Boutique hotels and bar-focused dining spaces looking for a stylish edge.

# 8. Geeken Seating Collection

While Geeken is best known for office and institutional furniture, they also supply **modular dining tables and seating solutions** to hotels and restaurants. Their focus is on functionality, ergonomics, and long-lasting materials.

* **Strengths**: Reliable supply chain, modular options, and durable materials.
* **Best For**: Hotels with business lounges, conference dining setups, or casual dining zones.

# Key Factors to Consider When Choosing a Manufacturer

When selecting a dining table manufacturer for your hotel, keep the following in mind:

1. **Durability** – Choose materials that resist scratches, stains, and frequent cleaning.
2. **Design Aesthetics** – Match the dining table style with your hotel’s theme—heritage, modern, minimalist, or luxury.
3. **Customization** – Opt for manufacturers that can adjust size, finish, and design to meet your specific needs.
4. **Bulk Capability** – Ensure the supplier can deliver large orders within your project timeline.
5. **After-Sales Support** – Look for warranty, repair, and maintenance options for long-term value.

# Final Thoughts

India’s furniture industry offers a diverse mix of manufacturers catering to the hospitality sector. For hotels seeking **international-grade dining tables**, Best of Exports sets the gold standard. For those who want culturally rooted pieces, Sankheda Furniture delivers heritage artistry. For budget-friendly, functional needs, names like Varsha Kitchen and Shree Swastik Furniture are dependable. And for modern, stylish dining spaces, CocktailKompany and The Coffee Concept bring trend-driven designs.

The key is to align your hotel’s identity and functional requirements with the right manufacturer. By doing so, your dining spaces will not only impress guests but also withstand the test of time.",1,1757745018.0,u_Far_Pause6113,0,1.0,False

While location, service, and cuisine are crucial, the furniture you choose plays an equally important role in defining guest experiences. Sofas and seating in particular shape the first impressions of hotel lobbies, lounges, guest rooms, and restaurants. In India, the furniture manufacturing sector has grown rapidly, blending traditional craftsmanship with modern design.

In this article, we explore the **top 8 hotel sofa furniture manufacturers in India**—starting with **Best of Exports**, one of the leaders in the market, followed by seven other manufacturers who may not be as well-known online but offer excellent quality, designs, and reliability.

# 1. Best of Exports

When it comes to hotel furniture in India, **Best of Exports** consistently ranks among the top names. Based in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the company has built a strong reputation for producing premium hospitality furniture that combines durability, aesthetics, and functionality. Their expertise extends across sofas, armchairs, dining furniture, beds, and outdoor collections.

Why They Stand Out

**Wide Product Range:** Best of Exports provides everything from luxurious lobby sofas to compact guest-room seating and outdoor lounge furniture. Their catalog covers both modern minimalistic designs and traditional handcrafted options.

**Customization Options:** Hotels often require furniture that aligns with their brand identity and interior themes. Best of Exports offers customization in dimensions, finishes, fabrics, and designs, ensuring each piece perfectly fits its intended space.

**Durability for Hospitality Use:** Unlike residential furniture, hotel sofas must withstand constant usage. The company emphasizes strong wooden or metal frames, durable joints, and high-quality upholstery designed to handle heavy wear and tear.

**Blending Tradition & Modernity:** One of the company’s unique strengths lies in its ability to blend contemporary styles with traditional Indian craftsmanship. Whether it’s tufted leather sofas for luxury hotels or cane and rattan seating for boutique resorts, their designs strike a balance between elegance and practicality.

**Global Standards:** As an export-oriented business, Best of Exports adheres to international standards in finishing, quality control, and delivery timelines. This makes them a preferred choice for both Indian hotels and global hospitality projects.

**Sustainability Focus:** With rising awareness about eco-friendly practices, the company also emphasizes sustainable sourcing of wood, low-VOC finishes, and recyclable materials in many of its products.

Ideal For

Luxury hotels, boutique resorts, high-traffic lounges, and international projects looking for premium furniture with a balance of aesthetics and strength.

# 2. Shree Swastik Furniture

Based in Gujarat, **Shree Swastik Furniture** has carved a niche for itself in providing reliable, durable, and cost-effective hotel furniture solutions. They specialize in sofas, chairs, and modular seating designed for medium and large-scale hospitality projects.

Their strengths lie in **affordable pricing** without compromising on quality. Many mid-range hotels and budget properties choose Shree Swastik Furniture for bulk orders because of their efficiency in manufacturing and ability to deliver sturdy products within short timelines.

For hotels looking to furnish lobbies, reception areas, or guest rooms with practical and long-lasting sofas, Shree Swastik offers an excellent balance of value and durability.

# 3. Sankheda Furniture

Hailing from the traditional craft cluster of Gujarat, **Sankheda Furniture** is known for its distinctive hand-painted designs. Crafted from teak wood and finished with lacquer, these pieces are often decorated in rich tones of maroon, gold, and copper.

For hotels, Sankheda furniture adds a **touch of heritage and cultural identity**. Boutique properties, heritage resorts, and destination hotels use these iconic sofas and chairs to create a memorable ambiance for their guests.

While mass production is not their strength, Sankheda artisans excel at producing unique and artistic pieces that make a strong statement in themed interiors.

# 4. Varsha Kitchen

Primarily recognized for commercial kitchen equipment, **Varsha Kitchen** also manufactures durable furniture for hospitality dining areas and cafeterias. Their focus is less on luxury and more on **functionality and utility**.

Hotel banquet halls, cafeterias, and staff dining areas often require furniture that can handle constant use, frequent cleaning, and heavy loads. Varsha Kitchen delivers exactly that—sturdy chairs, practical sofas, and tables that prioritize strength over elaborate design.

For hotels that prioritize **cost efficiency and utility**, especially in back-of-house and dining operations, Varsha Kitchen provides reliable solutions.

# Key Factors When Choosing a Hotel Sofa Manufacturer

Selecting the right [Hotel Sofa](https://bestofexports.com/hotel-furniture/hotel-sofa/) manufacturer isn’t just about style or price—it’s about finding the right balance of multiple factors. Here’s what hotel owners and project managers should keep in mind:

* **Durability:** Sofas in hotels see heavy traffic, so solid frames, quality upholstery, and easy-to-clean fabrics are essential.
* **Customization:** The ability to tweak designs, colors, and sizes to match a hotel’s theme is often a deal-breaker.
* **Budget vs. Value:** While upfront cost matters, long-term durability and low maintenance often save more money in the long run.
* **Lead Time:** Hotels often work with strict project schedules, so timely delivery is critical.
* **Design Identity:** Furniture should reflect the brand identity—luxury hotels may need plush leather sofas, while eco-resorts may prefer natural materials like rattan or bamboo.
* **Sustainability:** Eco-friendly practices are increasingly important, both for branding and compliance.

1nfq6f8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nfq6f8,Homemade Pumpkin Spice Latte Syrup (from a Former Starbucks Barista 👩‍🍳☕️🎃),"Hello, Reddit! This is my very first post, so be gentle!

I used to be a Starbucks barista back in the early 2000s, so I was there when the pumpkin spice latte first launched. Customers went wild for it, and honestly, so did we (behind the counter). My best friend (who I actually met there) used to fill a venti cup just with syrup to sneak home because we couldn’t buy the bottles even back then. 

Over the years, I’ve seen people venting about how the PSL tastes more/less pumpkin or more/less spiced, and how the recipe has changed. The great thing about making your own at home is that you can control all of that; the pumpkin-to-spice ratio, the sweetness, and even swap in dairy-free or sugar-free alternatives.

For the record: I measure with my heart, so this is me doing my best to put the recipe that lives in my head onto paper. I think Trey Kennedy would be proud. 

⸻

🎃 Homemade Pumpkin Spice Latte Syrup

Ingredients:
	•	1 ½ cups water
	•	½ cup granulated sugar
	•	8 Tbsp (4 oz) pumpkin purée (add more or less to taste)
	•	4 tsp cinnamon
	•	1 tsp ground cloves
	•	1 tsp ground ginger
	•	1 tsp ground nutmeg
	•	1 tsp allspice
(If you’re missing one of the smaller spices, just swap in another teaspoon of cinnamon.)

Directions:
	1.	Combine everything in a small pot. Heat on medium for about 10 minutes, stirring until the sugar dissolves.
	2.	Reduce to low and simmer for another 10 minutes to let the spices blend.
	3.	Strain through a fine metal strainer or cheesecloth to catch the grainy bits.
	4.	Let it cool, then stir in the following:
	•	1 Tbsp vanilla (optional)
	•	1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk
(For a dairy-free version, sub with coconut milk, just add about ½ cup more sugar to balance it out.)

Storage: Keep refrigerated in a mason jar or squeeze bottle.

How to use: Add 2+ tablespoons to coffee, lattes, or even tea (it’s great in chai!). Since it’s already creamy and sweet, you may not need extra sugar or less than your usual amount of milk.

Yield: About 3 cups of syrup (~10 servings).

⸻

That’s it! It’s simple, cozy, and way cheaper than dropping $7 every time the craving hits. Plus, you get to adjust it exactly how you like it.

If you're looking for a ***gentle, laxative-free option*** that actually helps with bloating while providing clean energy, this is worth trying.

I found it particularly effective for reducing that puffy feeling and improving digestion, though don't expect dramatic weight loss without diet and exercise changes.

The blend of 13 superfoods (especially the matcha, yerba mate, and dandelion) delivers multiple benefits beyond just ""detoxing,"" but the premium price point means you're paying significantly more than other options on the market.

**What I Liked**

* Reduced bloating noticeably within the first week
* Clean energy boost without jitters or crashes
* No harsh laxative effects (unlike many competitor teas)
* Pleasant peach flavor that works hot or cold
* Genuinely improved my digestion

**What Could Be Better**

* Pretty expensive compared to other detox teas
* Results take consistent use (at least 2-3 weeks)
* Not a miracle weight loss solution on its own
* Some caffeine-sensitive people might find it too stimulating

**How It Compares**

If you've tried teas like **Bootea or Teami** that left you running to the bathroom, ***SkinnyFit is much gentler*** on your system. I found it more effective for bloating than Republic of Tea or Bigelow's options, though slightly less powerful for appetite suppression than some Yerba Mate-focused brands.

The taste is definitely better than most medicinal-tasting detox teas, which made it easier to drink consistently.

If you struggle with digestive issues, bloating after meals, or afternoon energy crashes, I'd recommend giving SkinnyFit a try. Just know that for serious weight loss, this should be a complement to healthier habits, not your entire strategy.

# My current recommendations on Top Weight loss teas

While SkinnyFit Detox Tea offers some benefits, I've found two alternatives that deliver more comprehensive weight loss effects based on my extensive testing and research of detox teas:

**1. My current #1 Pick (Rating: 4.7 / 5)**

This [**brilliant two-part system**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/adstea.php) combines a Morning Energy tea and Evening Detox tea that work synergistically throughout your entire day. I rate this one at 4.7/5.

From my experience, this approach tackles weight loss from multiple angles - boosting metabolism in the morning while supporting detoxification and better sleep at night.

If you're looking for a more complete solution than single-formula teas like SkinnyFit, this dual-action system delivers noticeable results within the first two weeks of consistent use.

**Why I recommend this over SkinnyFit Detox Tea:**

**Complete 24-hour coverage** with morning and evening formulas versus SkinnyFit's single formula approach. All day hunger control & cravings support.

**More Fat Burning ingredients** rather than general antioxidants/wellness based formula :Also Contains **Oolong tea, orange peel, Garcinia Cambogia & Ginseng** for more aggressive fat-burning and appetite control not found in SkinnyFit

Ginseng Root & Garcinia provides superior energy and metabolic support

Evening formula includes Senna leaves for gentle overnight detoxification that SkinnyFit lacks

Fennel and Licorice Root work specifically to reduce late-night cravings

**Better taste profile with natural mint, lemon, and honey flavors**

 

**Pros over SkinnyFit:**

 

Two specialized formulas instead of one-size-fits-all approach

More focus on comprehensive fat-burning ingredients list targeting multiple weight loss pathways

Contains specific fat-burning ingredients like Garcinia Cambogia

Better for digestive cleansing with the evening formula

More effective for reducing nighttime cravings

Typically better value when purchased as a system

 

**Cons compared to SkinnyFit:**

Contains Senna which can cause digestive discomfort for some users, only in the evening part

Requires remembering to drink two different teas daily

Evening formula may interfere with certain medications

Slightly more complicated routine to maintain

 

**2. Tea Burn**

[**This TEA supplement**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/teaburn.php) **takes a completely different approach** with its powder formula designed to be added to your existing tea (or coffee). Based on my testing, this concentrated formula packs serious fat-burning power that works invisibly with whatever beverage you prefer.

If you're someone who already has a tea routine you enjoy, this allows you to supercharge your regular cup with proven weight loss compounds without changing your habits or taste preferences.

**Why I recommend this over SkinnyFit Detox Tea**:

Contains **L-Carnitine (100mg),** a powerful amino acid that transports fatty acids into cells for energy burning

**Green coffee bean extract (200mg)** provides chlorogenic acid for superior fat metabolism

**Includes Chromium for blood sugar regulation** and reduced cravings not found in SkinnyFit

Added **L-Theanine (100mg)** promotes calm focus while reducing stress-related eating

**Contains vitamin complex (D, B6, B12) for energy production and overall wellness**

Can be added to any beverage you already enjoy - maximum flexibility

**Pros over SkinnyFit:**

Significantly more concentrated fat-burning ingredients

Contains amino acids specifically for metabolizing fat (L-Carnitine)

Includes chromium for blood sugar control and reduced cravings

Added vitamins for nutritional support not found in SkinnyFit

Extremely convenient powder format that works with any beverage

No need to change existing tea preferences or routines

 

**Cons compared to SkinnyFit:**

Less emphasis on herbal ingredients some users prefer

Doesn't provide the ritual experience of brewing a special tea

May have a slight taste when added to certain beverages

Requires measuring the powder correctly

Less satisfying for those who want a dedicated ""detox tea"" experience

For serious weight loss results, both of these alternatives offer more comprehensive approaches than SkinnyFit, particularly through their targeted fat-burning ingredients and multi-dimensional weight management strategies.

# My final Performance Evaluation of SkinnyFit Detox Tea(Ratings)

 

# Appetite Control: 3.5/5

# Metabolism Boosting: 3.5/5

The combination of **matcha and oolong tea** supports metabolism enhancement and calorie burning. However, results may vary depending on individual metabolism and lifestyle factors.

# Fat Oxidation and Burning: 3.5/5

While metabolism-boosting ingredients like **matcha** and **guarana** contribute to fat oxidation, the tea itself isn’t a strong standalone fat burner. It works better as a complementary aid to a healthy diet and exercise.

# Blood Sugar Regulation: 3/5

The product contains some natural compounds, like **stevia and matcha**, which may help maintain stable blood sugar levels. However, its impact is likely minimal compared to targeted solutions for blood sugar management.

# Cognitive Support and Mental Clarity: 4/5

Ingredients like **matcha and ginseng** promote mental focus and clarity, making it a good choice for combating fatigue and stress. It may not replace more potent nootropic supplements but provides a noticeable cognitive lift.

With **lemongrass, dandelion leaf**, and **milk thistle**, the tea is excellent for soothing bloating and supporting digestion. Many users experience improved gut health within weeks of consistent use.

# Bottomline: Does Skinny Fit Detox Tea Work?

The tea claims to help with **weight loss, bloating, digestion, and energy**—but how much of that is real, and how much is just good marketing? Honestly, the science behind the ingredients is solid.

For example, **matcha green tea** and **oolong tea** are proven metabolism boosters, backed by studies that show they help your body burn calories more efficiently. Ingredients like **lemongrass** and **dandelion leaf** target bloating and water retention, which made me feel less puffy pretty quickly. If you struggle with bloating or digestion after meals, like I do, this tea can actually make a difference.

As for reviews, they’re mostly positive. A lot of users mention feeling less bloated, having more energy, and seeing gradual weight changes after a few weeks of consistent use.

But here’s the thing: **it’s not a magic weight loss solution**. If you’re expecting dramatic weight loss, you’ll need to pair this with a healthy diet and exercise. Detox teas like this are more about optimizing your body’s natural functions, not doing all the work for you.

For me, it’s been a clean, natural way to feel lighter, less bloated, and more energized. If that’s what you’re looking for, it’s definitely worth a try.

About six months ago, he used to look at me for a long time, but then he would leave the room without starting a conversation and avoided being alone with me. Over time, he began talking to me through jokes, but he still tends to cut conversations short and leave early. Normally, he is very social with everyone, but with me, he sometimes seems shy — he can’t hide his smile, especially in the past few days.

One day, after I jokingly said, ‘Where’s my coffee?’ he actually made me one and, as he left, he told me, ‘Don’t forget your coffee.’ He also teases me and once said, ‘I enjoy messing with you.’ During the summer vacation, he texted me a few times, which gave me hope, but his messages were always short. In the past two months, he also texted me three times, even if he didn’t continue the conversations much.

Recently, I found out that he just discovered — from a friend — that I had liked him two years ago. Back then, we weren’t in the same place, so he only learned about it now. Since then, I feel like he knows I like him, but he still hasn’t made a move. Sometimes he seems interested, other times he acts distant or formal. For example, one day I texted him and he seemed a little interested, but the next day at work he was cold and distant.

Another thing I notice is that whenever I try to talk to him face to face, he seems eager to leave quickly, and that confuses me.

I also realized he never added me on Instagram. Once, during a gift exchange, I gave him a t-shirt and even put a playful sticker on the package to tease him. As a Capricorn woman myself, I tend to hold back when it comes to showing interest, because I don’t want to seem too vulnerable. But now I’m wondering — is he holding back because he isn’t interested, because he’s cautious, or because he’s waiting for me to make things clearer?",1,1757744221.0,capricorns,7,0.6,False
