Lattafa Khamra Qahwa was that a good choice?,"So I new to buying fragrances, I‚Äôve always love the going into Myers and David Jones when I was younger and trying on different fragrances. I‚Äôve been given different fragrances as gifts over the years like Jean Paul Gaultier. I‚Äôve always loved Armani Acqua di gio but never wanted to spend the money to buy it. I recently picked up a few dupes from Dossier which I absolutely love. aquatic lime (Acqua di gio dupe) and Aromatic pineapple (YSL Y dupe). Both I absolutely love and the scent actually last too. 
Anyway I did a bit of YouTube and Reddit research and came across Lattafa Khamra Qahwa. Pretty much all reviews were very positive for this fragrance. I love coffee and the smell of it so I think that may have been what pushed me over the line. I paid $60 for it so not sure if that‚Äôs good or bad? I blind bought it from Amazon so haven‚Äôt smelt it yet and hopefully I made a good decision. 
I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts.

Figured I‚Äôd give this a try. I'm based in Adelaide (inner suburbs) and hoping to meet someone nearby who‚Äôs open to getting to know each other ‚Äî maybe grab a coffee or go for a walk and chat.

Some things I‚Äôm into:

* Traveling (both spontaneous road trips and planned overseas stuff)
* Nature ‚Äî I love the mountains as much as I love a quiet beach
* Book reading ‚Äî mostly nonfiction, history, philosophy, and some fiction when the mood strikes
* Deep conversations > small talk
* Museums, galleries, and places with stories behind them

Not really into the fast-swipe dating vibe, so I‚Äôm keeping it simple here. Ideally looking to connect with someone who enjoys meaningful convos, has a curious mind, and appreciates both adventure and stillness.

No pressure or expectations ‚Äî could be a casual catch-up or something more if the vibe is right.

1m9pku8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarutoFanfiction/comments/1m9pku8/oneshot/,[One-shot],"**The first killer is a retired enemy**

*We know him the least*

*We are wary of him the most*

The gentle rustle of leaves filled the air as a boy moved through the drills. He was fast‚Äîfaster than the others his age‚Äîbut still sloppy in his footwork. He lacked discipline, was not part of the academy but his enthusiasm made up for it.

His mind wandered.

His grudge for ninjas had pushed him to that.

It had been simple. Too simple.

*A minor change‚Äîa shift altered, a team switched.*

No one questioned it. Why would they?

The schedule had always been meticulous, but even the most diligent ninjas overlooked minor clerical errors. Who would notice a single change on the duty roster, buried beneath the many pages of administrative work?

He hadn‚Äôt been there when the blade was drawn. He hadn‚Äôt stained his hands with blood. He hadn‚Äôt needed to.

The man refocused. He continued looking at son.

**He hated ninjas.**

zzz

**The second killer is his predecessor's grandson**

*We fear him the least*

*We are scared of his potential the most*

Laughter filled the park as the two boys dashed through the grass, their sandals kicking up small clouds of dust. The sun was high, casting warm rays over the village, but they didn‚Äôt care about the heat. Not when there was a race to win.

He lost, intentionally. He was in a good mood after all. It wasn‚Äôt hard to act like an ordinary kid. Because he was one.

Mostly.

Except for when his friend told him to do something.

*Convincing his grandfather had been easy. It always was. A bright smile, an innocent request, just like he was told.*

*So, of course, his grandfather had gone. Had walked right to the secretary, carrying a small bag of wooden toys in one hand and a warm chuckle in his throat.*

*The weren't allowed to enter the office. He knew but...*

*A petulant whine, some spilled coffee, a distraction.*

*Just enough time.*

*The key had been at the drawer, the same place he left the fake one. And just like that, the pieces had moved into place.*

He had no idea what he did. No idea what he helped plan.

He just did what he was told and it just happened that some days later, someone was assassinated.

He sat up, brushing dirt from his clothes. His friend was on the ground now, dreaming.

**Konohamaru hated ninjas.**

zzz

**The third killer is his son's best friend**

*We trust him the least*

*We hate him the most*

The house was quiet, save for the muffled sobs coming from the next room. He stood in the doorway, watching as his best friend embraced his brother, his fingers gripping his shirts like he might disappear if he let go.

He wished he could say something. Do something.

*He barely felt the other one in the room. The one who shouldn't have been there.*

*Ninjas kept coming in and out. But he remained, hidden from the others in the room.*

*The first explosion was heard throughout the village. The village's leader turned to the window. No orders for him yet.*

*The second and the third.*

*The fourth.*

*A big smoke coming from his clan compound. This time he dropped down on his own.*

*Him and his team ordered to investigate. Investigate the explosions that he planted.*

*A last look at his leader. This was his last chance, the last chance to warn.*

***""Hah, do know what happens if I fail?""***

*He wanted to deceive himself, to believe he was being blackmailed‚Äîbut deep down, he knew it had been his choice all along.*

*He left. His best friend's father and his assassin, the last people in the room.*

He went to comfort them, their father's blood in his hands.

**Shisui started hating ninjas.**

**And all three hated Shisui.**

zzz

**The fourth killer is his old rival's son**

Even in the morning, the ramen shop was as lively as it is in the evening, yet a small space had naturally formed around him‚Äîa bubble of distance that no one wanted to cross.

He didn‚Äôt mind. He preferred it that way.

A strange sight for anyone who knew him as a newspaper rested on the table, its pages slightly crinkled from wear. He wasn‚Äôt one to read the news‚Äînever had been‚Äîbut today was different. If anyone cared to look closely, they‚Äôd notice something even stranger.

It wasn‚Äôt today‚Äôs newspaper.

It wasn‚Äôt even this week‚Äôs.

Last week‚Äôs headlines stared back at him, the inked words old, but still holding weight.

He smiled.

""Keep ‚Äôem coming, Teuchi,"" he said, placing his empty bowl of what was seafood ramen onto the counter. ""I'm in a good mood today"".

The old man chuckled, already preparing another serving. ""You got it, kid.""

He traced the edge of the paper with his thumb, many news spread out on the page, but he had never seen a bigger headline before.

Naruto kept smiling. He despised his village.

Ranked Best to Worst (Aside from after effect)

1 - Lattafah Khamrah Qahwa 
Not much more can be said about this, its. Great warm, spiced smell and I personally prefer it over the original because the coffee note makes it slightly more masculine in my eyes. 

2 - Vintage Radio 
Love this smell so much, somehow captures the smell of autumn perfectly, idk how to describe it but it feels almost nostalgic and like it reminds you of your past. The wordiness mixed with the plum works amazingly and i will definitely be buying it 

3 - Art of Arabia 1
An amazing LV Imagination clone and very clean, also somehow gives the vibe of a beachside and feels quite refreshing. Will likely be buying in the next month or so

4 - His confession 
This is, in my opinion, a more masculine, complex form of liquid brun, still ambery and warm but with the lavender it takes it to a whole other level. 

5 - Rare Reef 
Not a big fan, I appreciated the clean, blue smell however the citrus is somewhat overpowering in my nose and results in it almost smelling like a cleaning product

6 - Liquid Brun 
Not a bad smell at all but i feel it‚Äôs somewhat basic, people are right in saying it smells like a vanilla milkshake however that quickly gets sickeningly sweet. 

7 - Art of Universe 
A nice smell however i feel it does not fit me personally. The smell seems to cater towards formal more office like environments and i am too young (19) to need a fragrance like that 

8 - Vulcan Sable 
I was really optimistic for this fragrance considering its notes but sadly the whisky note is too prominent. As a result it smells very alcoholic and not as warm and spiced as id like it to be 

? - After Effect 
I was a huge fan of initio side effect when i smelt it in a store but this feels off. I dont know how to properly put it into words but the notes dont feel very well blended and can feel quite alcoholic. However i cant say i 100% dislike this fragrance but i dont know whether it would be worth buying as a going out/ clubbing fragrance. I plan to wait to see if there‚Äôll be any Maseration over the next couple weeks and seeing what it‚Äôs like.

Likely next buys

1m9pad1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/1m9pad1/undoing_repellent_spell/,Undoing Repellent Spell,"  
Hi! I‚Äôm searching for some help undoing a spell. I had cast a quick repellent spell in a panic two years ago: I found out someone I had a massive crush on was moving to the same city as I was, and cast a spell to keep them away (it was a very devastating crush).

I used a dirty can from a pre-made cocktail, vinegar, and a whole bunch of spicy mix-ins (off the top of my head: red pepper flakes, chili powder, hot sauce, lemon juice, etc) and put their name in it. I spoke with it for about 30 minutes, sealed it with wax from a candle, and disposed of it. I can't remember the exact day off of my head, but the moon was waning. 

He lost his job contract the next day due to a minor error, and then lost his apartment, so he couldn‚Äôt move to the same city as me. I don‚Äôt think it was the spell‚Äôs ingredients (it was rather eclectic) so much as my genuine panic that made it potent. This kind of distance was absolutely necessary for both of us; we grew significantly as individuals.

I‚Äôve tried to undo the spell now several times (we live in the same city now because I moved, and we are in a better place) because‚Äîno matter how much we flirt or get close to getting together‚Äîit seems like the universe intervenes. About to kiss on the dancefloor? A friend from 5 years ago randomly recognizes me. He comes back to my room at 3 am? He gets a call from his mom, out of the blue, that his grandmother is sick. Going for coffee? I trip, roll my ankle, and have to go to the doctor‚Äôs office instead. And so on and so forth. There‚Äôs genuine interest in a friendship for both of us.  
I don‚Äôt necessarily want a love spell‚Äîjust something to undo the repelling spell. I‚Äôd be happy if we were just friends, but it‚Äôs hard when these circumstances keep popping up.

I tried to undo it with a cleansing spell during a full moon: I used a white and black candle, wrote him a letter, and burnt it slowly while speaking my wishes out loud (i.e., that he be released from the repellant spell that I placed on him). While the strange interruptions have decreased in volume since then, they‚Äôre still happening (maybe twice per month rather than every time we plan to hang out).

If anyone has any suggestions on further ‚Äúreleasing‚Äù spells to do, I‚Äôd be very down to hear them! Again, I don‚Äôt want or need there to be *love*‚Äîjust for the spell I did to stop artificially messing with the distance between us so that there‚Äôs an opportunity for friendship.

TL;DR: Did a repellent spell on a crush that worked too well, and continues to work. No longer have that spell on hand. Would like to undo it so that we can be friends. ¬†

Thank you so much! Hope you guys have a lovely day. ",1,1753522892.0,Spells,0,0.99,False

**The Trump administration sharpened its focus on critical minerals**¬†this week, rolling out measures to extract metals from mine waste and adding a mining expert to its national security ranks. On Thursday, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum ordered regulators to streamline permits and funding for projects recovering minerals like¬†**rare earth elements**,¬†**lithium**, and¬†**cobalt**¬†from millions of tons of U.S. mine tailings, coal ash and even abandoned¬†**uranium**¬†mines.¬†**The goal, officials say, is to turn environmental liabilities into assets and achieve American ‚Äúmineral independence‚Äù amid China‚Äôs long-held dominance of these resources.**¬†‚ÄúThis initiative reflects our unwavering commitment to achieving mineral independence and ensuring that America leads the way in advanced technologies that power our future,‚Äù Burgum said, framing the waste-recovery push as a way to both boost industry and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers. The order directs the U.S. Geological Survey to map federal mine waste sites nationwide and makes it easier for companies to tap federal funds for extracting valuable metals from mine waste piles. Industry has already shown interest:¬†**Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE: FCX)**, for example, plans to produce 800 million pounds of¬†**copper**¬†per year by 2027 by leaching it from ore left for dead in its old waste dumps.

At the same time, the White House quietly tapped David Copley ‚Äì a former mining executive and Navy Reserve intelligence officer ‚Äì to lead a new office at the National Security Council devoted to securing supply chains for minerals vital to advanced military technologies.¬†**Copley‚Äôs appointment underscores how Washington increasingly views access to elements like nickel, cobalt and rare earths as a national security priority**, following Beijing‚Äôs recent use of export curbs as strategic leverage. U.S. officials described recent disruptions to magnet shipments from China as having upended global markets and forced emergency supply chain responses. In his new NSC role, Copley will focus on¬†**strengthening U.S. supply chains and boosting U.S. access to the critical minerals that underpin EV batteries, missiles and other high-tech defense systems**. The decision to put a mining expert in a top NSC post illustrates how national security priorities have shifted under President Trump. Other NSC units have been downsized, but¬†**the drive to obtain critical minerals has never waned**, particularly given China‚Äôs near-total control of mineral processing.

Those strategic concerns have also driven¬†**unprecedented U.S. support for domestic rare earth producers**. This month the Pentagon announced a major deal with¬†**MP Materials Corp. (NYSE: MP)**, the only U.S. rare earth mining firm, to bolster its refining capacity ‚Äì including a guaranteed price of $110 per kilogram for certain magnet-grade¬†**rare earth oxides**.¬†**That floor price is nearly double the current Chinese market level and is backed by decade-long U.S. government purchase commitments.**¬†Amanda Lacaze, Chief Executive Officer of¬†**Lynas Rare Earths Ltd. (ASX: LYC)**, said the move signals Washington‚Äôs determination to break Beijing‚Äôs dominance in¬†**rare metals**¬†supply chains and could spur a further rally in non-Chinese¬†**rare earth**¬†prices. Investors appeared to agree: Lynas Rare Earths Ltd. shares jumped after the announcement, and the company just reported a 42% surge in average selling price for its¬†**rare earth**¬†products last quarter to A$60.2 per kg, the highest in three years. That, alongside rising volumes, lifted Lynas‚Äôs quarterly revenue to A$170.2 million (\~$112 million), about 10% above analyst expectations. Notably, Lynas‚Äôs output of¬†**neodymium**¬†and¬†**praseodymium (NdPr)**¬†‚Äì key elements for powerful magnets ‚Äì hit 2,080 tonnes in the quarter, an all-time high for the company.

Lynas Rare Earths Ltd. is responding with record production and new partnerships geared toward a post-China supply chain. This week the company announced a deal with JS Link Co. Ltd. of South Korea to develop a 3,000-tonne-per-year facility for¬†**Neodymium-Iron-Boron**¬†magnets near Lynas‚Äôs plant in Kuantan, Malaysia. Under a non-binding memorandum, Lynas will supply both light and heavy¬†**rare earth**¬†feedstock, and JS Link Co. Ltd. will manufacture finished sintered magnets used in electric vehicle motors and other technologies. The planned Malaysian magnet factory is aimed at serving surging global EV demand without relying on Chinese magnet makers. Japanese magnet manufacturers significantly increased output last quarter amid China‚Äôs export squeeze, and Lynas Rare Earths Ltd. has been working with them to find new automotive customers abroad.¬†**The company‚Äôs expansion into magnet production ‚Äì alongside record output of NdPr oxide and the first-time production of heavy rare earth oxides like terbium ‚Äì underscores how non-Chinese players are racing to plug gaps in the supply chain.**

While Western firms scale up, China has been quietly tightening its grip at home. Beijing issued its first batch of 2025¬†**rare earth**¬†mining and smelting quotas last month with no public announcement, instructing state-owned producers not to disclose the figures for security reasons, according to sources. The volumes weren‚Äôt leaked, but the stealth rollout itself is telling. It comes after an unusual delay and amid internal debates in Beijing over whether to count imported ore against domestic mining limits.¬†**What is clear is that access to China‚Äôs rare earth output is more restricted than ever.**¬†Last year only two giant state-run groups‚ÄîChina Rare Earth Group and¬†**Northern Rare Earth Group (SHSE: 600111)**‚Äîwere eligible to receive quotas, down from six firms previously, as Beijing consolidates control over the sector. This quota system, in place since 2006, is a key barometer of global¬†**rare earth**¬†availability.¬†**The secretive approach this year underscores how sensitive rare earths have become in U.S.-China relations.**¬†In April, China added several¬†**rare earth alloys**¬†(including samarium-cobalt, neodymium-iron-boron, and dysprosium-containing alloys) and magnets to its export restriction list‚Äîa retaliatory move after U.S. tariff hikes‚Äîand the resulting bureaucratic licensing delays caused a sharp drop in shipments. Certain U.S. and European automakers had to pause production lines for lack of magnets.

[NioCorp's \~LREE & HREE will add \\""DIVERSITY\\"" of domestic supply!](https://reddit.com/link/1m9p9ip/video/huk03suyr6ff1/player)

After China‚Äôs new export permit rules precipitated a collapse in¬†**rare earth**¬†magnet exports this spring, a tentative thaw in trade tensions has allowed some flow to resume. Chinese shipments of¬†**rare earth permanent magnets**¬†to the United States soared 660% in June from the prior month, reaching about 353 metric tons, after Washington and Beijing struck agreements in late June to resolve the licensing logjam. That one-month spike marked a sharp recovery from April‚ÄìMay, when China‚Äôs added paperwork and 45-day approval times strangled exports. In total, China exported 3,188 tons of¬†**rare earth magnets**¬†worldwide in June, up 157% from May‚Äôs level‚Äîthough still 38% lower than June 2024, reflecting how far trade had fallen during the dispute. Analysts expect shipments to continue rebounding in July as more Chinese exporters obtain licenses under the new system. Even so, the first half of 2025 saw China‚Äôs magnet exports down almost 19% year-on-year. The United States was a major beneficiary of the June rebound, becoming the second-largest destination after Germany by volume.¬†**The episode has reinforced U.S. industry‚Äôs sense of vulnerability and its incentive to diversify sources or recycle rare earths domestically.**

# JULY 15th, 2025~Unpacking the Department of Defense and MP Materials Critical Minerals Partnership

[Unpacking the DoD and MP Materials Critical Minerals Partnership](https://fas.org/publication/unpacking-dod-and-mp-partnership/)

Rare earth elements have been the primary target of critical minerals trade tensions between the United States and the People‚Äôs Republic of China (PRC), which processes¬†[91%](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-critical-minerals-outlook-2025/overview-of-outlook-for-key-minerals)¬†of all rare earth elements globally. In response to significant new tariffs from the Trump administration, in April 2025, the PRC instated new export controls on seven rare earth elements, which resulted in a significant decrease in exports as companies had to apply for new licenses and wait for approval.[^(1)](https://fas.org/publication/unpacking-dod-and-mp-partnership/#reference-item-1)¬†Luckily, the list of materials did not include neodymium and praseodymium (collectively known as NdPr), which are key to the manufacture of permanent magnets used in all kinds of motors, from those in electric vehicles and wind turbines to aircrafts and submarines.¬†

The Department of Defense (DoD) has expressed¬†[significant interest](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3700059/dod-looks-to-establish-mine-to-magnet-supply-chain-for-rare-earth-materials/)¬†in developing domestic NdPr supply chains for magnets, due to the risk of relying upon ‚Äúoverseas, single-points-of-failure‚Äù for such critical materials and components. A new multibillion dollar partnership between DoD and MP Materials, the only active domestic producer of NdPr,¬†[announced](https://mpmaterials.com/news/mp-materials-announces-transformational-public-private-partnership-with-the-department-of-defense-to-accelerate-u-s-rare-earth-magnet-independence/)¬†on July 10th, seems to be the agency‚Äôs big bet on a solution.

The announcement has received both excitement and questions regarding the structure of the partnership and its potential impact. The partnership is notable not only for the sheer amount of funding that DoD is committing, but for its use of both supply- and¬†[demand-side](https://fas.org/publication/critical-thinking-on-critical-minerals/)¬†policy tools to strategically support the expansion of MP Materials‚Äô NdPr processing and magnet manufacturing capacity.¬†**These policy tools have never been used in tandem like this before, marking a new development in U.S. industrial policy, so let‚Äôs unpack exactly what the partnership entails.**

# Supply-Side Policy Tools

**Equity Investment.**¬†DoD will invest an initial amount of $400 million in MP Materials in return for Series A Preferred Stock. This investment, combined with a separate $1 billion loan from JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, will provide MP Materials with the capital needed to construct a ‚Äú10X‚Äù magnet manufacturing facility expansion that would increase MP Materials‚Äô manufacturing capacity from 3,000 to 10,000 metric tons. MP Materials is obligated to raise another $350 million, either from other sources, another investment from DoD, or an addition to the JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs loan.¬†

**Warrant.**¬†A 10 year warrant provides DoD with the option to increase its shares of MP Materials up to 15%, in which case DoD would become the largest shareholder of MP Materials.¬†

**Loan.**¬†MP Materials will also receive a $150 million loan from DoD to expand their rare earth processing facility.

# Demand-Side Policy Tools

**Price Floor Commitment.**¬†To ensure a stable market for MP Materials‚Äô NdPr processing facility and its expansion, starting in Q4 2025, DoD will guarantee a price floor of $110/kg for NdPr, nearly double the current market price, over 10 years. The structure of the price floor agreement is essentially a modified contract-for-difference.

When the market price is below the floor, DoD will pay MP Materials the difference between the two for every kg of material produced.[^(2)](https://fas.org/publication/unpacking-dod-and-mp-partnership/#reference-item-2)¬†Note that this includes not just materials sold to commercial buyers, but also materials that are internally consumed by MP Materials for magnet manufacturing and excess materials that are stockpiled, with priority given to magnet manufacturing. At the current market price of $60/kg, this would cost DoD roughly $300 million/year.[^(3)](https://fas.org/publication/unpacking-dod-and-mp-partnership/#reference-item-3)¬†When the market price is above the floor, DoD will in turn receive 30% of the amount above the floor, though given how high the price floor is, the expected amount of upside is low unless there is another supply crunch in the future.

Unlike a traditional price floor, this structure provides the federal government with the added benefit of sharing in the upside from windfall profits. This modified contract-for-difference also innovates upon the¬†[original contracts-for-difference model](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/contracts-for-difference)¬†designed for less risky electricity markets by uncapping the amount of upside that companies can earn. This is key to ensuring that the project remains appealing to private-sector investment.

**Offtake Commitment.**¬†To derisk MP Materials‚Äô magnet manufacturing facility expansion, DoD is also providing a 100% offtake commitment for the 7,000 MT/year of expanded magnet manufacturing capacity over the first 10 years of production. For the magnets, DoD will pay MP Materials a price equal to the cost of production. In addition, DoD will pay MP Materials $140 million/year to guarantee a minimum level of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) (i.e. raw profits).

MP Materials also has the option to sell some or all of the 10X expansion magnets to commercial buyers with DoD‚Äôs consent. For additional profits (i.e. EBITDA) generated from those sales, the first $30 million above the $140 million threshold will go to DoD, after which profits will be shared 50/50 between DoD and MP Materials.¬†¬†

According to the¬†[Securities and Exchange Commission filing](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001801368/6191cf7a-1cb7-4c45-a50a-72c98a0fbe86.pdf)¬†by MP Materials, DoD is using, in part,¬†[Defense Production Act (DPA) Title III](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title50-chapter55-subchapter2&saved=%7CKHRpdGxlOjUwIHNlY3Rpb246NDUzMSBlZGl0aW9uOnByZWxpbSk%3D%7C%7C%7C0%7Cfalse%7Cprelim&edition=prelim)¬†authorities and funding to enter into this partnership.[^(4)](https://fas.org/publication/unpacking-dod-and-mp-partnership/#reference-item-4)¬†This is enabled by¬†[Executive Order (E.O.) 14241](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-measures-to-increase-american-mineral-production/), which issued a Presidential Determination that critical minerals and their derivative products (e.g., rare earth magnets) meet the requirements for the use of DPA Title III and delegated Section 303 authorities to the Secretary of Defense.¬†

Section 303 authorities include subsidies and purchase commitments, which DoD likely used for the demand-side components of the partnership.[^(5)](https://fas.org/publication/unpacking-dod-and-mp-partnership/#reference-item-5)¬†Section 303 provides exemptions from the regulations (e.g. the Federal Acquisition Regulation) that govern most government transactions, providing DoD with significantly greater flexibility to customize contract terms. This flexibility is key for effectively designing and implementing¬†[demand-side tools for critical minerals](https://fas.org/publication/critical-thinking-on-critical-minerals/), tailored to the unique market conditions for each material and the private-sector partner.

Funding could come from the¬†[DPA Fund](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:50%20section:4534%20edition:prelim))¬†for Title III actions, which is managed by the DoD and primarily funded through annual defense appropriations. Or, from the $1 billion in new appropriations for DPA passed as a part of the¬†[One Big Beautiful Bill Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text)¬†(OBBBA). Given that DoD‚Äôs¬†[FY26 budget request](https://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/FY2026/FY2026_p1.pdf)¬†for the DPA Fund is only $266 million‚Äîless than the estimated annual price floor payments DoD must make at the current market price for NdPr‚ÄîDoD will most likely have to draw on the new OBBBA appropriations in addition to or instead of the DPA Fund in the immediate term.

For future funding, especially after the OBBBA appropriations run out, DoD will be reliant upon Congress to make sufficient annual appropriations to the DPA Fund to cover the cost of the price floor payments and, once the 10X Facility comes online, the offtake commitment. Any potential future revenue from this partnership could also be used to replenish the revolving DPA Fund.¬†

One key feature of the DPA Fund to note is that it‚Äôs capped at $750 million. The estimated annual cost of the MP Materials partnership once the 10X facility is in operation will take up at least 60% of the cap.[^(6)](https://fas.org/publication/unpacking-dod-and-mp-partnership/#reference-item-6)¬†Unless Congress decides to raise or remove the cap during the next¬†[DPA reauthorization](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IN12484), this partnership will limit the amount of funds available for other industries crucial to national security.[^(7)](https://fas.org/publication/unpacking-dod-and-mp-partnership/#reference-item-7)

# A Model for the Future?

While the DoD and MP Materials partnership definitely stands out for its ambitious scale and its innovative use of policy tools, whether this can and/or should be used as a model for the future requires considering some additional questions.

First, will this partnership simply entrench a domestic monopoly on NdPr production? There was no known competitive bidding process for this funding opportunity, and it is unclear if DoD plans to offer similar support to other rare earth producers in the future. One argument for MP Materials is that they are the only currently operating producer of NdPr‚Äîall the other projects are still in development‚Äîso this was the least risky investment option for DoD. The current significant supply chain concentration and risk of future trade disruption to national security may also justify such an intervention in the industry.¬†

Given MP Materials‚Äô domestic monopoly and the significant amount of taxpayer money going to support that, should the government have negotiated for significantly more upside to compensate for the lack of competition? Market competition is key to driving innovation and efficiency improvements and bringing down prices over time. How can the federal government continue to foster growth and competition in the NdPr market after this partnership?¬†

Lastly, does this model make sense for other critical minerals markets? There are a number of other critical minerals with similar levels of supply chain concentration in the processing step, including battery-grade graphite, nickel, cobalt, and lithium, which are crucial to the¬†[defense industrial base](https://www.businessdefense.gov/ibr/pat/battery-strategy.html)¬†and multiple commercial sectors. Some of these materials also currently have only one domestic producer or no domestic producers. On the other hand, some of these materials have larger and more mature markets than NdPr, making them slightly less vulnerable (though definitely not free from) to market manipulation. The federal government could potentially make a similar impact on these material supply chains while using a smaller subset of policy tools, so long as it addresses both supply- and demand-side needs.

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS:

# A SPECULATIVE LOOK INTO THE CURRENT INFILL DRILL PROGRAM & SOME FOOD FOR THOUGHT...

**\*\*\*The timing of the updated Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS)**¬†is¬†**critical**¬†to unlock every downstream event: financing, EPC contracts, DoD grant eligibility, and even Ex-Im/UKEF export credit support.

# üìò Updated DFS: Why It Matters

* The current¬†**2022 DFS**¬†is solid, but it‚Äôs missing:
   * **Revised CAPEX/OPEX cost structures & NPV**
   * Addition of¬†**TiCl‚ÇÑ, REE separation & tonnages, and recycling plus all Byproducts**
   * Scope for¬†**DOE/DoD incentive eligibility\*\*\*\*\***
   * Final¬†**production estimates**, all¬†**EPC specs & engineering, RailVeyor, Constuction Schedule & a lot more!...**
* **\*\*\*Lenders, offtakers, and government backers**¬†may all want this¬†**before they commit.**

# THE CURRENT INFILL DRILL PROGRAM IS ONGOING & SHOULD BE WINDING UP SOON... ""Why add 9 new Bore-Holes Now you may ask......???""

# üî¢¬†1. Drill Hole Increase %

Niocorp adding¬†**9 new boreholes**¬†to the existing¬†**14**:

**\*\*\*\*Increases the current number (2022 F.S.)  of drill holes by \~64%\*\*\*\*\***

# üìà¬†2. Resource Growth could potentially GROW from 632KT (2022 F.S.) to Hypothetical 1,000KT ~1 Million Ton TREO

TREO¬†Growth¬†%=(1,000,000‚àí632,000632,000)√ó100=58.23%\\text{TREO¬†Growth \\%} = \\left(\\frac{1,000,000 - 632,000}{632,000}\\right) \\times 100 = 58.23\\%TREO¬†Growth¬†%=(632,0001,000,000‚àí632,000‚Äã)√ó100=58.23%

***\*\*\*So the Hypothetical TREO tonnage would increase by¬†\~58.23%.\*\*\****

# üß†¬†Strategic Interpretation:

* The¬†**% increase in boreholes (\~64%)**¬†is¬†**roughly aligned**¬†with a¬†**targeted TREO increase (\~58%)**.¬†
* **This strongly supports your hypothesis that consistent grade zones across those new drill cores could justify a linear or near-linear scale-up from 632KT ‚Üí 1MT. \*\*\*\*\***

# ***If these new cores confirm continuity of grade and volume, you're looking at a¬†game-changing DFS update!!!

# üèÅ¬†Final Hypothetical Take:¬†‚úÖ

# Niocorp at 1MT TREO could surpass MP Materials¬†not only in¬†total revenue¬†but also in¬†strategic value diversity¬†across the CM + REE spectrum ‚Äî a critical factor for DoD, aerospace, and electrification.

I was a morning smoker. The type of smoker that wakes up with a deep desire to just go on the window and inhale poison before my eyes properly open. 

This feeling was so powerful for me, to the point where I slept with chewing gum in the first two weeks which made the mornings easier.

Today, is the third day where I wake up and go make a coffee and within these 10 minutes I completely forgot I used to want a smoke. 

It gets easier every day, and one day it's gonna get so easy that you will realize you have forgotten about being a smoker for three months, and one day it's gonna be a year, and then one day it's just gonna be a faded memory of a long distant experience that won't matter.

I do have cravings at this point. Some days I even walk by a store with the full intent to just buy a pack and smoke one. But I always skip it on the last moment. The pride of going this far at this point is bigger than the stupid craving just for one which would pass in 2 minutes and make my life worse. ",2,1753522733.0,stopsmoking,0,1.0,False

Her name was Piper. All doe eyes and innocent smiles, exactly the type that Damien always loved. He'd been keeping her for over six months now.  
  
  
Other than me, she was the woman who had stayed by his side the longest.  
  
  
My friends kept warning me to watch my back. They swore something was different this time‚Äîthat Damien might actually marked her as his luna.  
  
  
I first met Piper on my birthday, of all days.  
  
  
I'd been getting nosebleeds since morning, so I dragged myself to the pack doctor. The news wasn't exactly a birthday surprise I'd been hoping for.  
  
  
""Spring,"" he said quietly, not meeting my eyes. ""Maybe until next spring, if you're lucky.""  
  
  
I just nodded. ""Okay.""  
  
  
Death didn't scare me anymore. The pain, though... that was something else entirely.  
  
  
There were medications that could help, expensive ones that might buy me some comfort in whatever time I had left.  
  
  
But my accounts were running dry.  
  
  
So I swallowed my pride and headed to Damien's office.  
  
  
Of course, Piper was there‚Äîhis brand new ""secretary,"" fresh out of college with her business degree and doe-eyed ambition.  
  
  
Damien was stuck in some board meeting, so I settled into the waiting area.  
  
  
Piper kept staring at me like I was some fascinating specimen, whispering to the other staff just loud enough for me to catch every word.  
  
  
""That's the Luna? God, she looks awful. All dried up and... I don't know, half-dead or something.""  
  
  
She giggled softly. ""Everyone says I look like her, but come on. I'm way prettier, right?""  
  
  
I caught my reflection in the glass partition‚Äîno makeup, drowning in an oversized coat, looking exactly as sick as I felt.  
  
  
Fair point, honestly. I did look half-dead. Because I was.  
  
  
One of the older secretaries tugged at Piper's sleeve, voice dropping to an urgent whisper.  
  
  
""She's not done up, that's all.I saw her during the mating [ceremony.Trust](http://ceremony.Trust) me, honey, when she actually tries? Ten of you couldn't compete.""  
  
  
""And listen carefully‚Äîshe‚Äôs the Alpha‚Äôs [treasure.You](http://treasure.You) have no idea how much he loves her. You push too hard, and he'll destroy you without a second thought.""  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
Word around the pack is that Damien's absolutely crazy about me.  
  
  
Piper clearly doesn't buy it‚Äîshe rolls her eyes and makes this little scoffing sound under her breath.  
  
  
She sets down a cup of coffee in front of me, her voice dripping with fake sweetness. ""Celine,luna,how could alpha Damien just... leave you waiting out here like this?""  
  
  
""It's so weird,"" she continues, tilting her head with practiced innocence.  
  
  
""Every other time I've come by the office, no matter how swamped he was, he'd drop everything to see me first. Said I was his top priority, you know?""  
  
  
""Guess I thought he treated all his women that well...""  
  
  
She smiles then‚Äîthis sickeningly sweet expression that reminds me exactly of myself at that age.  
  
  
God,how ridiculous!  
  
  
Thing is, she's not entirely wrong. Damien does treat her differently.  
  
  
Sure, he had countless mistresses. They're all just props in his little revenge fantasy, tools to get under my skin. He parades them through our house night after night, waiting for me to crack, to finally show some jealousy.  
  
  
Most of them? He gets bored within days, maybe weeks if they're lucky. Tosses them aside like yesterday's newspaper.  
  
  
But Piper... she's different. He actually takes care of her.  
  
  
Sets her up in that fancy downtown apartment, takes her to dinner, shopping, those cute little movie dates.  
  
  
They look like any other couple in love when they're together.  
  
  
He gives her money, sure. But he gives her attention too.  
  
  
I study her face for a moment, then smile gently. ""If you're so important to him, sweetie, why do you think he keeps you as his dirty little secret?""  
  
  
""Maybe you should convince him to break bond with me and make you his new Luna.""  
  
  
Her mask slips instantly. Color drains from her face before flooding back in an angry rush.  
  
  
""The unloved luna is the real mistress here,"" she hisses, leaning closer. ""You're the one who doesn't belong!""  
  
  
""Just because you knew him first doesn't mean shit. Look at yourself‚Äîyou're old, you're pathetic. What could you possibly offer him that I can't?""  
  
  
Her coworker scrambles over, probably worried I'll cause a scene or report back to Damien.  
  
  
But honestly? I couldn't care less.  
  
  
I made peace with this long ago. I won't get angry over Damien anymore. Won't let him break my heart or make me fight other women for scraps of his attention.  
  
  
He's just not worth it!  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
When the secretary yanked Piper back, she stumbled and went down hard.  
  
  
The cup shattered against the marble floor, shards slicing deep into her palm. Blood pooled beneath her hand as she cried out.  
  
  
Through the conference room's glass walls, Damien saw everything.  
  
  
Every eye in that office watched as our Alpha abandoned his board meeting mid-sentence, scattering papers as he burst through the door. He scooped Piper up like she was made of spun glass, his voice dropping to that dangerous growl.  
  
  
""Who the fuck hurt her?""  
  
  
The poor secretary who'd tried to help stumbled backward, face chalk-white with terror.  
  
  
I couldn't help but laugh. ""That would be me. And she deserved every bit of it!""  
  
  
Piper's tears were perfectly timed, of course. She clutched at Damien's shirt, voice breaking just right. ""Yes, maybe I did deserve it! Maybe I deserve to be called a homewrecker, a mistress...""  
  
  
""But Damien, as long as you love me even a little, I'll stay by your side forever. No one can tear us apart.""  
  
  
Even her confession sounded brave and romantic instead of completely delusional. The girl had talent, I'd give her that.  
  
  
Damien actually smiled‚Äîsoft and fond in a way I hadn't seen in years. He brushed her tears away with his thumb. ""Hey now, you're gonna ruin that pretty face if you keep crying.""  
  
  
So yeah. She really was different.  
  
  
I looked away, suddenly exhausted. ""It's my birthday. I need fifty thousand dollars.""  
  
  
Pathetic, really. Married for three years, and we didn't even have each other's phone numbers.  
  
  
The only time I sought him out was when I needed money.  
  
  
That's how we'd arranged things before the mating ceremony‚Äîhe got my body, I got his money.  
  
  
He'd always hated me for being such a gold-digger.  
  
  
But until now, he'd never denied me. Whatever I asked for, he'd transfer double the amount without question.

As we spoke we found out that we live not very far from each other and infact work in the same campus different companies, so we decided to meet. To my surprise she was cuter than what I expected, maybe it was the pahadi genes. We walked around the campus, talked random stuff and left after about an hour. 

It was overall fun and I was interested in meeting again. During the time we met she mentioned that she doesn't meet anyone from online and only coz I'm from the south she agreed to meet and went on to say delhi guys are pushy and she's heard guys from the south are sweet and safe. I'm still trying to understand y she said something like that about delhi boys. Couple days later I texted her asking if she wants to go out on the weekend and grab something to eat to which she responded after 2 days saying ""I'm sorry I don't go out much nowadays"" and I replied that's cool. End of it. 

Fast forward to a week after that, I got a text from a guy online who claimed to be an old online friend of hers and said he had heard about me from her. He even called me and mentioned that she actually likes u and in fact wanted to ask for ur number but she was shy. Also it seems she mentioned to this guy that she felt comfortable around me and I seemed comfortable around her. 

I was sceptical about this guy, still I decided to text her a second time asking if she wants to meet in office space since she earlier mentioned she felt nothing can go wrong in a premise like that. So she agreed this time and we met at the office campus, walked around and she took me to this cold coffee stall and even paid for it before I could notice. Then we talked for some more time and I walked her till her office tower and she asked if I want to come up to the floor where she works and I did end up going along where the security was starring at me as I didn't have an id card. 

A week later I asked her and we met in the office again, had some snacks. Is chaap considered as snacks? Initially after that online guy mentioned she wanted to ask for my number I thought I'll wait till she asks herself but on this third meet I ended up asking for hers. Also this time I asked her let's meet out someday and I want to explore the city as I moved here recently. She did agree saying that she'll take me to her favorite place she used to visit often, some sort of a food street. 

Thing is when we meet she seems sweet and interested but over text she takes a day to reply, which I wasn't a fan of. Obviously we can't be texting all day and night or instantly but where did the basic respect go? Everytime we used to meet I went 3-4 hours before my work and she used to stay back 1 hour after hers. 

A day after the third meet I called her to ask if she was in the office. She said she is but has some pending work. When it was that weekend for us to meet I never heard back from her nor had she responded to my text prior to that, which was about something else, nothing to do about meeting. Neither I texted nor did I call her after that. She seems career oriented and that's also a thing I like about her.

Well now I'm not sure if she was interested in the first place or was it that bakwas guy inbetween trying to play cupid or some other genuine thing. Just pricking my mind what was the reason. Anyway I don't think I'll go forward with this even if she reaches out.",3,1753522212.0,gurgaon,7,1.0,False

The drawing itself is kinda small and plain, but I did this in a coffee shop and it was kinda a demo for how I wanted to draw them, so I'm not too upset about the overall quality :)

* Craving for iced drinks. I don't drink coffee, so I've been having iced matcha lattes. Quickly learned how to make one at home to save money though.
* Wanting to travel to northern America :D. I've only been to NYC like 15 years ago, so maybe my next travels could be there. Maybe not LA or Ottawa but Toronto or somewhere else.
* the over consumption, I've been very mindful with my money and wanting/needing aspect of shopping for some years. But seeing their hauls and countless baby clothes that wont be used or only worn once definitely has an impact, for every item I'm about to buy I think do I really need this.

1m9p3ak,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1m9p3ak/did_she_french_leave/,Did she french leave?,"So I met this girl online over a month ago. As we spoke we found out that we live not very far from each other and infact work in the same campus different companies, so we decided to meet. To my surprise she was cuter than what I expected, maybe it was the pahadi genes. We walked around the campus, talked random stuff and left after about an hour. 

It was overall fun and I was interested in meeting again. During the time we met she mentioned that she doesn't meet anyone from online and only coz I'm from the south she agreed to meet and went on to say delhi guys are pushy and she's heard guys from the south are sweet and safe. I'm still trying to understand y she said something like that about delhi boys. Couple days later I texted her asking if she wants to go out on the weekend and grab something to eat to which she responded after 2 days saying ""I'm sorry I don't go out much nowadays"" and I replied that's cool.

Asc dhamaan saxibayaal 

I‚Äôm coming from Sweden Gothenburg city to Istanbul next week insha‚ÄôAllah for a short visit, and I was wondering if there are any Somalis living, studying, or working in Istanbul?

I‚Äôm looking to meet someone I can hang out with during my stay  just chill, explore the city a bit, maybe grab some food or coffee. It would be nice to connect with a fellow Somali while I‚Äôm there.

If you're around and up for it, feel free to message me.

I did not expect to have to literally chase after a baby so soon! She started crawling last month and shes quick ah lol. Before i can get off the couch shes off her playmat standing and taking something off the tv stand. Im starting to get over whelmed thinking about all the baby proofing and removing most of my home decor thats in her reach. I thought I had some time to do it little by little before it was necessary. So naive! 
She freaking leaps off of stuff and climbs and stands on everything. We have a plush cushioned coffee table that she climbs up on using some weird push pull technique shes made up. I purchased a huge foldable playpen that takes up most of the living room, thinking at least she can crawl and stand in there but shes not the biggest fan. We have to either take her out after 15 mins (maybe 25 if shes  just waking up) if she even lets us put her in there or we have to get in with her lol. Her lovevery gym is useless now.
Tips? Not going to do a walker, but im seriously considering maybe a bouncer and use it sparingly? Because right now one of us has to hold/watch like a hawk while the other gets things done or wait until shes sleep if one of us is out of the house.

1m9ot9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1m9ot9r/sharing_of_my_personal_experience_for_your/,Sharing of my personal experience for your feedback,"Hey all,

Summary:
Straight to the point, I am at my wits end mental health wise over the last 2 weeks, which I believe correlates with practically cold turkeying coffee (exceptions being the odd chocolate, tea, etc) 2 weeks ago. I am seeking general advice or feedback to assist me at this point in time.

About me:

- 28 yo male, Australian
- Sydney based
- full-time teacher for 1.5 years, accountant for 8 years. I love my job.
- I am studying a masters of teaching full-time for the past 1.5 years, with 1 semester left. I have a GPA of 6.3 out of 7. I study and work full-time.
- drank coffee since I was 16. Over the past 6-7 years I would have 2 full strength coffees a day (morning and night)
- I have suffered horrendous anxiety since 17, due to family related violence and school bullying. Due to this I have had on and off bad chest pain over the past 10 years.
- Married (Happily) and expecting my first child in 1 month (this is not any cause of anxiety, I believe anyway)
- Drink regularly every 2nd night (1-3 standard drinks)
- Had high blood pressure (185 95 at one point) but has reduced this recently to 155 83
- I'm not overweight and play sport regauarly

Background to current situation:

It is currently week 1 of a high school term 3 and I decided to stop drinking coffee to help my anxiety and lower my BP in the final week of the previous term 2. I also chose to drink less alcohol, but not cold turkey. 

I stopped on the Tuesday and by Thursday and Friday I noticed my cognitive skills had diminished. I had the following symptoms:

- Headaches In the front of my head (similar to migraines)
- I felt I wasn't as well spoken, I needed to process what I wanted to say really hard before saying it, and even then I would mix up what I wanted to say.
- Brain fog? I just could not process information personal normal and felt slow.
- I was forgettful of certain things, like names, etc.

These symptoms worsened by the Saturday then reduced significantly by the Tuesday. 

At this point I got a blood test. This was on Thursday and we could not get blood out, from either arm. I admit I didn't drink alot of water prior. So we pushed it to the following week. 

I snow skiied Sunday Monday Tuesday, and felt the best I have felt in a long time - no symptoms (but some heavy drinking on some nights). 

By the next Thursday (week 2) of school holidays I tried the blood test again and it was much smoother - i made sure to drink plenty of water. 

Fast forward to now (week 1, term 3) and results came back positive - all my levels were good. But I still had lingering symptoms all week. This has been fuelling my anxiety. 

My biggest issue has been the following symptoms:

- I feel much slower to process information. Especially when speaking
- Much more tired by midday 
- I feel physically not as sharp, as if I'm clumsier or not as accurate with my motor functions per normal.


So at this point, even after the health check came back positive, these symptoms have me thinking like I'm developing early on set dementia, etc. It's killing me. 

The positives of all of this turmoil:
- much better sleeps
- underneath my eyes visually appear less dark
- my chest pain and anxiety has improved immensely 

The question is, and this is why I'm posting, should I stick this out? Is this normal? Should I taper back on? I feel like I'm mentally fading away and it terrifies me. 

Please let me know your thoughts - any is much appreciated ",2,1753520987.0,decaf,0,1.0,False
1m9osv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1m9osv5/my_first_real_narcissist_experience/,My First Real Narcissist Experience,"TL;DR: My ex‚Äôs controlling, manipulative behavior turned our whirlwind romance into a nightmare. I ignored red flags, got sucked into her cycle of love-bombing and gaslighting, and barely escaped with my sanity. A domestic violence incident where I was falsely accused, then finally ended it. I‚Äôm a recovering dumbass, but I‚Äôm learning.

Disclaimer: 

I‚Äôm not a doctor or mental health professional. I‚Äôm not diagnosing my ex with narcissism or anything else. I‚Äôm just a guy describing behavior that felt manipulative and toxic, based on my experience. No clinical labels here, just my story.

Second Disclaimer: 

I‚Äôm a neurodivergent dude who somehow turned a pile of red flags into a blindfold. My instincts screamed from day one, but I ignored them because, well, I‚Äôm a dumbass.

The Story:

Three months ago, I met a woman on Stir. She was witty, sharp, and responsive. We clicked instantly‚Ä¶ a coffee date the same day we matched, sci-fi movie night at my place by evening. It felt magical. Romantic. Too good to be true.

It was.

That first night, we had a sexless sleepover; one of the most intimate moments of my life. I was hooked before I even knew her. 

Post-divorce (seven years ago), I was vulnerable, and that instant connection swallowed me whole. I thought it was love.

She seemed perfect: same favorite movie, same tastes, same traumatic backstory. The sex? Mind-blowingly compatible. 

The first 22 days were a euphoric blur of intimacy, conversation, and emotional fusion. I was all in‚Ä¶ matching bracelets, shared locations, synced photo albums. She and her two amazing kids even moved in. I thought this was my second shot at family.

Then the rules changed.

It started with a porn ban. Out of nowhere. I didn‚Äôt fight it much, thinking it was a healthy shift, but it wasn‚Äôt a discussion; it was a decree. 

Then sex toys were banned. They ‚Äúmade her feel insecure.‚Äù Our sexual compatibility had been a cornerstone, but now I wasn‚Äôt allowed to masturbate. Her logic? My pleasure should come only from her.

I rationalized it. I caved. But it wasn‚Äôt about toys, it was about control.

Four weeks in, she demanded I destroy all traces of past relationships; photos, texts, mementos. We burned them in my backyard. Deleted files, backups, everything. It felt like erasing parts of myself, but I went along with it. 

Why? No clue.

She started shadowing me around the house. I couldn‚Äôt get five minutes alone without accusations: ‚ÄúWhat are you hiding?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy do you need space?‚Äù She demanded access to my security cameras, except one in my den (a cat cam for peace of mind). 

That sparked fights, her way or no way.

Then she wanted my accounts, forums, discussion groups, framed as ‚Äúbeing part of my world.‚Äù I bought it. She joked about tattooing wedding bands so we‚Äôd never take them off‚Ä¶ cute then, creepy now. 

One-on-one talks with women? Banned as ‚Äúemotional infidelity.‚Äù 

I ghosted my female friends.

Then the emotional spiral hit. Gaslighting. Projection. Blame-shifting. 

Every disagreement became a scripted attack on my self-worth. I‚Äôd try to express a feeling and end up apologizing for having one. She flipped narratives like a pro, leaving me the villain.

She suggested ‚Äúworking through issues‚Äù with kink dynamics, rules, punishments, power play. I‚Äôm kinky, but this felt manipulative, like a tool to blur consent. 

Then the sweetness vanished. 

Name-calling, demeaning comments, passive-aggression. She‚Äôd turn off location sharing, hint at ‚Äúavailable‚Äù men, and share graphic stories about her sexual past, unprompted, like a test or punishment.

Then, triangulation. 

While I was showering on a Minnesota vacation, she snooped through my private journals, found entries about past partners, and contacted my ex**a therapist**to dig into me. 

My ex shut her down, confirming I‚Äôm not unhinged, just a guy who‚Äôs done the work to be emotionally grounded. 

I didn‚Äôt learn about this until we got home.

Cue a blow-up. She claimed I was on a Facebook post about narcissistic men, saying my ex ‚Äúconfirmed it.‚Äù Total lie. She threatened to dox me, said vile things, and still I let her back in. She‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúThis fight was the one we needed. We‚Äôll get it right.‚Äù 

Spoiler: we didn‚Äôt.

The cycle continued: control, paranoia, no empathy. Amazing nights were followed by apocalyptic fights. She‚Äôd walk out, then return with declarations of love, calling me ‚Äúher person.‚Äù

Wolf Lodge Incident:

We tried salvaging things with a family vacation. Disaster. She snooped again, read more private material, and used it to paint me as the problem. She‚Äôd been messaging my therapist ex, twisting the story to validate her narrative. My ex shut her down again.

Back home, another fight. She walked out, threatened to expose me online, lied about what my ex said, and told me I needed serious mental help. 

Still, I let her back in.

One night, after a great evening, I stayed up late working in my den. That made her suspicious. Next morning, she stormed out, pissed. Later, I heard a car pull up. She rushed through my garage, trying to barge into my den, without permission. We weren‚Äôt living together. She had no key, no right.

I blocked her at the door, offered to get what she needed. She pushed past. I bear-hugged her, carried her to the driveway. She ran back in. Again. And again. In the struggle, she busted her lip and called the cops, claiming I choked her.

I was floored. Police arrived, saying I‚Äôd likely go to jail. Then I remembered: my exterior camera caught the audio, not the full scene, but enough. That clip saved me. She was arrested for domestic violence.

Now:

A no-contact order‚Äôs in place. I‚Äôve got peace, but I know she‚Äôll spin this somehow. What did I learn? Even with therapy, emotional depth, and intuition, I can still be a dumbass. 

But I‚Äôm a recovering dumbass, and that‚Äôs something.",1,1753520942.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

Astrodude: Rotsar Mission Log Number 2. The planets are... arguing again. This time it sounds serious.

\[Camera zooms out to show the planets in heated discussion\]

Jupiter: I'm telling you, I'M the most important planet in this solar system!

Saturn: Oh please! Without my rings, this place would be boring as heck!

Earth: Excuse me? I have LIFE on me! Literally billions of organisms!

Mars: Yeah, well I might have had life first, so technically-

Venus: ENOUGH! We all know I'm the hottest planet here!

Mercury: That's... that's not really something to brag about, Venus.

\[The arguing gets louder and more chaotic\]

Astrodude: Houston, the planets are having some kind of... philosophical crisis?

Houston: \*sipping coffee\* Ugh, not again. Let me call in an expert. Hey! We need someone who can settle planetary disputes!

\[MinutePhysics Henry appears on screen\]

Henry (MinutePhysics): Hi! I'm Henry from MinutePhysics, and I hear you have a cosmic argument on your hands?

Astrodude: Oh wow! MinutePhysics! I love your videos! Yeah, they're all claiming to be the ""most important"" planet.

Henry: Well, that's actually a fascinating question! Let me explain this to them.

\[Henry somehow materializes in space near the planets\]

Henry: Hey planets! I understand you're having a debate about importance?

Jupiter: Finally, someone with sense! Tell them how my gravity protects the inner planets from asteroids!

Henry: That's true, Jupiter! \[Your massive gravitational field does act like a cosmic vacuum cleaner, pulling in potentially dangerous objects\]. But-

Saturn: But nothing! Look at these rings! I'm basically the supermodel of the solar system!

Henry: Your rings are beautiful, Saturn, but they're mostly made of ice and rock particles. Now, if we're talking about importance...

Earth: See? He's obviously going to say I'm the most important because of life!

Henry: Actually, \[every planet plays a crucial role in the solar system's stability and evolution\]. Earth, you do have life, which is incredibly special. But Mars might help us understand how life could exist elsewhere.

Mars: Ha! See!

Henry: Jupiter, your gravity does protect the inner planets, but it also might have disrupted early planet formation. Saturn, your rings help us understand planetary dynamics.

Venus: What about me?

Henry: Venus, you're a perfect example of runaway greenhouse effect, which helps us understand climate science!

Mercury: And me?

Henry: Mercury, you help us test Einstein's theory of relativity with your orbital precession!

\[All planets start talking at once\]

ALL PLANETS: So I'M the most important! / No, ME! / He said I was special! / Did you hear that?!

Astrodude: \*facepalm\* Great, now they're arguing even MORE.

Henry: Wait, wait! I think you're all missing the point. \[The most remarkable thing about our solar system isn't any individual planet, it's how you all work together as a system\]. None of you would exist without the others!

Sun: \*butting in\* Excuse me, what about ME? I literally power this entire system!

Henry: Well, yes Sun, you're crucial too, but-

Neptune: \*from far away\* WHAT ABOUT THE OUTER PLANETS?!

Uranus: Yeah! We exist too!

Pluto: \*even further away\* I USED TO BE A PLANET!

\[Everyone starts arguing again, even louder\]

Astrodude: \*covering his ears\* HOUSTON! MAKE IT STOP!

Houston: \*throws his hands up\* I give up. Henry, can you just... science them into being quiet?

Henry: Actually, there's a simple solution. \[In physics, we often find that the most interesting phenomena happen not because of individual components, but because of their interactions\]. You're all important BECAUSE you're different!

\[Planets slowly quiet down\]

Henry: Think about it, if you were all identical, the solar system would be boring! Jupiter, your size creates unique dynamics. Earth, your life makes you special. Venus, your extreme conditions teach us about atmospheres. Mars, you show us what Earth could become. The outer planets expand our understanding of planetary formation. Even Pluto helps us understand the edge of our solar system!

Jupiter: \*thoughtfully\* So... we're important BECAUSE we're different?

Earth: That's... actually kind of beautiful.

Mars: Yeah! We're like... a team!

Saturn: The most fabulous cosmic team ever!

Mercury: With me as the speedy one!

Venus: And me as the mysterious one!

\[All planets start getting along again\]

Astrodude: Wow, that actually worked! Thanks, Henry!

Henry: No problem! Remember, \[diversity is what makes systems stable and interesting, whether we're talking about ecosystems, societies, or solar systems\]!

\[Henry starts to fade away\]

Henry: Keep exploring, Astrodude! The universe has so many more mysteries to discover!

\[Henry disappears\]

Sun: \*warmly\* You know what? I'm proud of all my planets.

All Planets: Awww! / Thanks, Sun! / We love you too!

Astrodude: \*smiling\* You know what? Maybe being stuck up here isn't so bad after all.

\[Camera pulls back to show the peaceful solar system\]

Astrodude: (voiceover) Rotsar Mission Log addendum: Today I learned that sometimes the most important thing isn't being the best at something, it's being part of something bigger than yourself.

1m9orfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTheCaribbean/comments/1m9orfq/do_you_feel_the_caribbean_diaspora_sometimes_has/,Do you feel the Caribbean diaspora sometimes has a different (or outdated) view of life back home compared to those of us living here? What examples have you noticed?,"In my interactions with members of the Trinbagonian diaspora (or their foreign born descendants), I‚Äôve often noticed that many seem to have a rather dated view of local culture and everyday life here. Since the largest wave of migration from T&T happened in the 1980s, it feels like a lot of the diaspora‚Äôs cultural outlook is frozen in that era. Many hold on to traditions, practices, and even certain foods that have long fallen out of favour at home, which can sometimes lead to funny or awkward moments when they visit or we visit them. 

For example, decades ago, most Trini households swore by a coffee brand called Hong Wing*.* Today, it‚Äôs nowhere near as popular, with other brands taking over. A few years ago, an aunt of mine who migrated to Florida in the mid 80s came over and asked for Hong Wing*.* Not only did we not have it, but some of us didn‚Äôt even know what it was. She couldn‚Äôt believe it, and it really highlighted how quickly societies evolve and how being away for a while can make it hard to keep up with those changes.   

Another example is when I visited the same aunt in the US as a teenager, and she remarked on how ‚ÄòAmerican‚Äô I seemed in both my tastes and general behaviour. At the time, I was confused because I didn‚Äôt act any differently from other local teens my age. Now that I‚Äôm older, I realize that for her, the image of a typical Trini teenager was based on what she remembered from the 1980s. The newer generation of teens, with our evolving styles and influences, probably felt more like what she was used to seeing in her new home.

Have you noticed this kind of cultural ‚Äòtime capsule‚Äô effect with members of your own diaspora?",3,1753520781.0,AskTheCaribbean,2,0.8,False

I think I have enough grasp of things to get started. So far I've only made two very simple game jam games that I completed in 2-3 days each.

Now I want to do a 2-6 month long project and put it on steam. I strictly don't plan to invest more than 6 months on it. Target is not to earn money but to feel good about myself that I put a working product on steam. I might even make it free.

So what's the genre I should target. I was thinking about these two:-

1. Horror Survival Game with gameplay length of 2 hours. Focusing on cutscenes and animations since that is my weakest skillset.

2. Story driven cozy game like a short hike. Focusing on narration and writing.

3. Simulation game like Cafe Manager, Coffee shop simulator etc.

Eventually I want to do both. But want to start with whatever is easiest.

1m9oo8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/KolkataLife/comments/1m9oo8w/why_bengal_is_lagging_behind_got_banned_from/,Why Bengal is lagging behind ‚Äî Got Banned from Kolkata community for sharp criticism,"Got banned recently from a Kolkata Reddit group for calling out something a lot of us know deep down but never say publicly. All I did was criticize how Bengalis, especially the educated ones, vote and think politically. I didn‚Äôt abuse anyone. Didn‚Äôt name any party. Just called out the rot. And I was banned. Just like that. Because apparently even that‚Äôs too much to handle.

The group behaved as if it was party-affiliated. Couldn‚Äôt take a simple political opinion. It hit me harder than I expected ‚Äî not because I was banned, but because it proved my point. That the crisis in Bengal is not the fault of politicians. It‚Äôs the mindset of the voters. Especially the so-called educated class.

Let‚Äôs be real. Bengal spent 34 years under a regime that destroyed industries and freedom of thought. And the next 15 years have been just another version of the same thing. You changed the logo, not the machinery. You replaced slogans with posters, leaders with idols, but the results are the same.

You‚Äôd think after decades of stagnation, joblessness, youth leaving, and a crumbling system ‚Äî people would wake up. But no. The same people who can quote Marx and Tagore over coffee are the ones who freeze when it‚Äôs time to question what‚Äôs happening in their own backyard. You talk about Palestine and caste and capitalism but go completely blank when asked about what‚Äôs happening in Ballygunge or Barasat.

The Bengali voter has turned selective. Hypersensitive. Defensive. They‚Äôll quote freedom of speech till it makes them uncomfortable. After that it‚Äôs ban. Report. Cancel. Silence. They don‚Äôt want debate. They want echo chambers. Polished and protected.

And that‚Äôs the core of the problem. You can‚Äôt blame politicians forever. They are elected. Re-elected. Backed by the same people who complain over WhatsApp but vanish on polling day or vote the same way their parents did out of tradition or fear or some twisted sense of cultural superiority.

The truth is most of the smart, ambitious people I know from Bengal don‚Äôt live in Bengal anymore. Left for Delhi. Mumbai. Bangalore. Abroad. Because this place doesn‚Äôt let them grow. Doesn‚Äôt want them to. And yet we pretend like we‚Äôre this beacon of intellectualism. This enlightened state. What a joke.

No real jobs. No startup ecosystem. No innovation hub. Public universities choking. Healthcare in survival mode. Roads that flood every monsoon. A city stuck in nostalgia and noise.

And what do we do about it Nothing. Just keep voting the same way. Keep defending the same failures. Keep shooting the messenger. The state has turned into a comfort zone for decay.

So yeah. I got banned. And honestly it made things clearer. If you get shut down just for saying the voter needs to take responsibility then maybe the problem isn‚Äôt political at all. Maybe it‚Äôs psychological.

Bengal isn‚Äôt just lagging behind. It‚Äôs choosing to. Every single day.",1,1753520434.0,KolkataLife,8,0.56,False

1m9olhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1m9olhk/how_to_create_the_ultimate_gift_basket_for_any/,How to Create the Ultimate Gift Basket for Any Celebration,"Creating the ultimate gift basket for any celebration is a thoughtful and personalized way to show you care. Whether it‚Äôs for a birthday, anniversary, holiday, or even a housewarming, a well-crafted gift basket can bring joy and excitement to the recipient. Here‚Äôs how to put together the perfect basket for any occasion.

**1. Consider the Recipient‚Äôs Interests**

The first step in creating a gift basket is understanding the recipient‚Äôs likes and interests. A basket that speaks to their personal tastes will be much more appreciated. For example, if they are a foodie, you might fill the basket with gourmet snacks, sauces, or unique treats. If they love pampering themselves, include spa items like lotions, candles, and bath bombs.

**2. Choose a Basket or Container That Fits the Theme**

The container you use can really set the tone for your basket. A woven basket is classic and can hold many items, but for a more modern or specific theme, consider using other containers like a stylish tote bag, a cooler, or even a wooden crate. Make sure the size and style of the container suit both the items you plan to include and the recipient's personality.

**3. Select a Theme or Focus**

Creating a themed gift basket makes it even more special and personal. You can tailor it around a specific theme such as:

* **Movie Night Basket**: Fill it with popcorn, candies, cozy socks, and a couple of great movies.
* **Relaxation Basket**: Include calming items like scented candles, teas, bath oils, and a soft throw blanket.
* **Breakfast Basket**: Choose items like pancake mix, syrups, jams, and gourmet coffee beans.

Picking a theme makes the process easier and ensures the basket is cohesive.

**4. Include a Variety of Items**

A great gift basket should offer variety, appealing to different senses and tastes. Mix and match sweet and savory treats, and add small personal touches like handwritten notes or custom items. If you're creating a spa basket, for example, you might include soothing face masks, body scrubs, and a calming playlist. A combination of items will ensure there‚Äôs something in the basket for everyone to enjoy.

**5. Don‚Äôt Forget the Presentation**

Once your basket is filled with goodies, take time to arrange everything neatly. You can use tissue paper to line the bottom, or even shred it to fill in gaps and make the items appear more abundant. Adding a bow, ribbon, or personalized tag gives the basket an extra festive touch.

Creating the ultimate gift basket doesn‚Äôt have to be complicated, but it requires thoughtfulness and creativity. Keep in mind the recipient‚Äôs personality, and choose items that are meaningful and useful to them. When done right, your gift basket will become a treasured memory!",1,1753520113.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False

We had plans in motion to get our home, we had plans laid out for the rest of our lives together, and it was all for nothing. I still dream of you, every single night. I dream of the farm we were going to start, I dream of the days that we spent laughing and smiling, I dream of the good days, and of the bad. Now instead of waking up next to you to talk about it, I'm just left to sit in all the sadness. What went wrong. What are you so upset at me about that you've blocked me on everything and started alienating me from my own kid? I was loyal, I was true. Went to work, came home and all I wanted to do was sit with you and enjoy life. I was there for your every need, even though you said you could care less about mine. And yet I still love you. I still miss you. I miss the family we started. I miss waking up and making you coffee, I miss working in the garden with you. I miss seeing your beautiful eyes and your beautiful smile. I miss the feeling of your hugs. I miss having to bend down to give you a kiss. I'd give the world to have you back. I'd give the world for things to be different. And even though I know you'll never care for me again, I'll always be here for you. I still love you, I'll always miss you. Maybe in another life things would be different. I'm sorry.

But I have three problems:

-Almost no budget (I can maybe do 1 italki per month)

-Multiple disabilities that make it so I can rarely leave the house (so regular conversation meetups, coffees with local friends, etc) are out. 

-Disability limits on study time (complex reasons, but basically I can‚Äôt invest more than 15-20 minutes each day in active learning).

1m9oc0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1m9oc0r/the_doge_plan_the_only_plan_we_need_to_bring/,THE DOGE PLAN ‚Äì The only plan we need to bring Dogecoin back to the top üåï,"Hey everyone,
I‚Äôve been lurking here for a while, and after thinking about it a lot, I‚Äôve finally decided to write this post. Because honestly‚Ä¶ we need to unite. For real.

If you were around during the 2021 ride, you know exactly what I mean: Dogecoin wasn‚Äôt just a coin ‚Äì it was a movement. It was memes, irony, accessibility, community. It was a symbol. It was how millions of people got into crypto in the first place.
But then? Silence. Time passed. New projects came and went, scams exploded‚Ä¶ and Doge sort of fell asleep.

It‚Äôs time to wake the beast.
And that‚Äôs where THE DOGE PLAN comes in.

‚∏ª

WHAT IS THE DOGE PLAN?

It‚Äôs a simple, grassroots and (potentially) viral plan to bring Dogecoin back to the center of global attention.
I‚Äôm not talking about pumping or market manipulation.
I‚Äôm talking about something much bigger:

‚û°Ô∏è A coordinated community movement to spark a new wave of enthusiasm.

‚∏ª

HOW DOES IT WORK?
	1.	BUY THE DIP (even a small amount)
You don‚Äôt need to buy 100k DOGE. If each of us buys ‚Ç¨10, ‚Ç¨50, ‚Ç¨100 worth of Doge ‚Äì all around the same time ‚Äì we send a message.
If 10,000 of us do it ‚Üí the impact is real.
	2.	SPREAD THE WORD ON SOCIALS
Twitter (X), TikTok, Instagram, Reddit, Discord, even Facebook.
Make memes. Post a comment. Reply to threads. Do a stupid but viral TikTok.
Talk about DOGE. Make it cool again. One post a day. Use the hashtag: #DogePlan
	3.	USE DOGE AS REAL MONEY
Wherever you can. And talk about it. ‚ÄúI paid for my coffee in DOGE‚Äù, ‚ÄúI tipped a friend in DOGE‚Äù.
Encourage businesses to accept it. Even symbolically. Symbolism is powerful.
	4.	COMMUNITY COORDINATION
Let‚Äôs organize ourselves. We can build a simple public calendar with themed days (e.g., ‚ÄúDOGE Tip Day‚Äù, ‚ÄúDOGE Meme Contest‚Äù, ‚ÄúDOGE Merch Drop‚Äù). Everyone contributes. Everyone plays.

‚∏ª

WHY NOW?

Because crypto has gotten boring again.
Too many tokens with no soul. Too many projects with no heart. Dogecoin has always been different ‚Äì born as a joke, survived by love.

Yeah, Elon still occasionally tweets. But we need more. We need us.

‚∏ª

WHAT IF IT WORKS?

If it works, Dogecoin is everywhere again.
Will the price go up? Maybe, maybe not (probably yes). But more importantly: we‚Äôll bring back the wildest, funniest, most alive community in all of crypto.

And that‚Äôs the real value.

‚∏ª

If you made it this far, do one thing:

‚úîÔ∏è Comment ‚ÄúIN‚Äù if you‚Äôre in
‚úîÔ∏è Buy even just 5 DOGE
‚úîÔ∏è Post something with #DogePlan today
‚úîÔ∏è Invite one friend to join the mission

Let‚Äôs do this.

TO THE MOOON üöÄ

If this post has some positive feedbacks, I promise I‚Äôll get serious about organizing this thing for real.
Tools, strategy, coordination ‚Äì the full plan.
Let‚Äôs show the world what DOGE is made of. üê∂üî•

‚ÄúGet up, get up! We have to go!‚Äù she called out breathlessly, barely glancing in Alina‚Äôs direction as she rushed past.

Alina looked up from her book, her eyebrows knitting together in confusion. ‚ÄúMom, what‚Äôs going‚Äî‚Äù

Before she could finish, Helena was already yanking her off the couch, a whirlwind of energy and determination.

‚ÄúMom! What are you doing?!‚Äù Alina exclaimed, stumbling after her.

‚ÄúNo time for questions!‚Äù Helena shot back, practically pushing her toward the door.

Alina blinked as the sight of a gleaming black limousine parked in front of their house registered in her brain. She froze, pointing at it as if it might disappear if she stared long enough.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Alina said slowly. ‚ÄúWhat is that? And why does it look like something out of a soap opera?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust get in,‚Äù Helena huffed, throwing the car door open.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Alina said, crossing her arms. ‚ÄúNot until you tell me what‚Äôs going on. And if you say anything ridiculous, I‚Äôm locking myself in my room.‚Äù

Helena sighed, glancing at her watch. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time for this, baby. I‚Äôm getting married. Tonight.‚Äù

Alina blinked again. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre getting what?‚Äù

‚ÄúMarried,‚Äù Helena repeated, like it was the most obvious thing in the world. ‚Äúto the love of my life‚Äù

‚ÄúThe love of your‚Äî‚Äù Alina‚Äôs mouth fell open, her heart sinking. Not again. Not another one of her mother‚Äôs ridiculous, spontaneous marriages. ‚ÄúMom, really? Another one?You are not doing this to me again. Who is it this time?‚Äù

Some long-lost pen pal? The mailman? Did you fall in love with the guy who fixed our plumbing last week?‚Äù

Helena waved a hand dismissively. ‚ÄúHis name is Charles. He‚Äôs perfect, Alina. And this time, I‚Äôm sure‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always sure!‚Äù Alina snapped, ‚ÄúEvery single time, you swear this guy is your soulmate, and it‚Äôs always a disaster!‚Äù

‚ÄúShhh! This time it‚Äôs different,‚Äù Helena insisted.

‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs exactly what you said the last time! And the time before that! Mom, I‚Äôm done. Count me out of this one. Seriously.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlina, stop being dramatic.‚Äù

‚ÄúDramatic?‚Äù Alina threw her arms up. ‚ÄúMom, you‚Äôre getting married tonight! And you didn‚Äôt think to tell me until now?‚Äù

Helena‚Äôs face softened. ‚Äú We just made the decision a few hours ago, okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no, not okay!‚Äù Alina echoed, her voice rising. ‚ÄúMom, this isn‚Äôt some spur-of-the-moment lunch date! It‚Äôs a wedding! With vows and rings and‚Äîoh, I don‚Äôt know‚Äîa whole new family for me to awkwardly navigate!‚Äù

Helena stepped closer, her expression pleading. ‚ÄúBaby, I need you to trust me. Charles is...he‚Äôs different.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre always different,‚Äù Alina shot back. ‚ÄúAnd it always ends the same way: awkward family dinners, forced smiles, and me trying to figure out who‚Äôs allergic to what!‚Äù

‚ÄúAlina.‚Äù Helena‚Äôs voice softened, and for a moment, Alina saw the vulnerability beneath her mother‚Äôs impulsiveness. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all I have. Please. Just come with me.‚Äù

Alina sighed heavily, her resistance crumbling. ‚ÄúFine. But I swear, if this guy turns out to be a total disaster, I‚Äôm changing my number and moving to where you will never find me again‚Äù

Helena grinned triumphantly and practically shoved Alina into the limo. ‚ÄúThank you! Now, no more complaining‚Äîwe‚Äôre on a tight schedule!‚Äù

\---

At the Boutique.

‚ÄúI still can‚Äôt believe this,‚Äù Alina muttered, tugging at the impossibly tight dress her mother had picked out. ‚ÄúYou meet a guy, fall head over heels in two weeks, and now we‚Äôre here. This has got to be some kind of record. ‚Äú

Helena, adjusting her own dress, smiled dreamily. ‚ÄúWhen you know, you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, Mom. When you know, you take a breath, maybe think about it for more than five minutes, and then you know.‚Äù Alina glared at her reflection, trying to yank the dress into something resembling comfort. ‚ÄúSeriously, how do you keep finding these people? Is there a secret club for hopeless romantics, or did you just get lucky with another guy who can‚Äôt resist your charm?‚Äù

Helena chuckled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too cynical, sweetheart.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not cynical. I‚Äôm realistic.‚Äù Alina gestured to the mirror. ‚ÄúAnd realistically, this dress is cutting off my oxygen.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou look beautiful,‚Äù Helena said, her voice tinged with pride.

‚ÄúI look like a stuffed sausage,‚Äù Alina deadpanned. ‚ÄúWhich, by the way, is not the aesthetic I was going for.‚Äù

Helena ignored her, checking her watch. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre late. Come on.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, Mom, seriously‚Äîthis thing is so tight I might need the jaws of life to get out of it!‚Äù

Helena rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll manage. Now move.‚Äù

\---

The limo rolled up to an elegant estate that looked like something out of a fairy tale.

Alina stepped out, wobbling in her heels as she took in the sprawling gardens, twinkling lights, and the small, intimate group of guests scattered around.

‚ÄúThis is...a lot,‚Äù she muttered, tugging at her dress as she followed her mother toward the altar.

Helena didn‚Äôt respond, too focused on the man waiting at the front‚Äîthe groom.

‚ÄúThat's him‚Äù She said smiling so dreamy

‚ÄúHe's an Alpha, thought you didn't like Alphas anymore ‚Äú¬†

‚ÄúJust because James was a dick doesn't mean they all are. Charles is an angel‚Äù

Alina rolls her eyes

‚ÄúMet this guy two weeks ago, and now you‚Äôre marrying him? This is a new low, even for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúCharles is Wonderful, he'll be a great dad to you, You‚Äôll love him.‚Äù

Alina snorted. ‚ÄúEw. Don‚Äôt say that. He‚Äôs not my dad.‚Äù

Helena rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúStop being so dramatic. Just smile and be polite, okay? This is a big day.‚Äù

‚ÄúPolite? I‚Äôm about to pass out in this stupid dress, and you want polite?‚Äù Alina yanked at the fabric, her frustration building.

‚ÄúStop fussing,‚Äù

Alina watched as her mother practically floated down the aisle, her face glowing with happiness. She sighed inwardly. She loved her mom, truly. But this was the fourth time in as many years that she‚Äôd stood by and watched Helena throw herself headfirst into a whirlwind romance.

After the vows were exchanged, Alina tried to make herself as invincible as possible at the reception. She didn‚Äôt want to meet her new stepfather. She didn‚Äôt want to hear the gushy love stories. She just wanted to go home, kick off her heels, and pretend this whole night hadn‚Äôt happened.

Unfortunately, Helena had other plans.

‚ÄúAlina, come meet Charles Grayson,‚Äù she said, dragging her over to a tall, distinguished-looking man who smiled warmly at her.

‚ÄúAlina, it‚Äôs wonderful to meet you,‚Äù Charles said, his voice deep and pleasant.

Alina forced a smile. ‚ÄúHi.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry my son couldn‚Äôt be here,‚Äù Charles said apologetically. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll meet him tomorrow at dinner. I‚Äôve planned something special for the family.‚Äù

Great, Alina thought. Another stranger to deal with.

But as she shook Charles‚Äôs hand, a strange, fleeting sensation prickled at the edge of her senses. Her wolf stirred uneasily, though she couldn‚Äôt pinpoint why.

Brushing off the feeling, Alina forced herself to smile. ‚ÄúLooking forward to it,‚Äù she lied.

She plastered on a smile that looks like her lip was bending to the left

She wasn‚Äôt stupid‚Äîshe knows who the Graysons are. They practically owned the entire country.

What has her mother gotten them into this time.

# Unexpected

Alina crossed her arms, leaning back on the faded couch as she stared at her mother, Helena, who was pacing the room with determination. Her hands were full of bags, the contents tumbling out slightly from her careless packing.¬†

Helena's energy fills the small living room like an impending storm.

""Mom, I‚Äôm not moving into some rich mansion,"" Alina said flatly, her tone laced with defiance.

Helena whirled to face her, her lips curving into an exasperated frown. ""I‚Äôm not letting you stay here alone.""

""I‚Äôm not a child, Mom!"" Alina protested, sitting upright.

""You‚Äôre my child!""

Alina groaned, throwing her hands up. ""Look, first of all, I‚Äôm an adult. I can take care of myself. Secondly, I‚Äôm not a kid you can just drag around to live with your new husband.""

""Your new father. Your new family,"" Helena corrected with a teasing smile.

Alina cringed, her face contorting in disgust. ""Ew, stop calling him that.""

""Alina!"" Helena‚Äôs voice rose sharply, but there was no masking her excitement.

Alina crossed her arms again. ""Didn‚Äôt you say his son hates you? What kind of family could that possibly be?""

""He‚Äôll come around, and we are not talking about him,"" Helena said, dismissively waving her hand as if brushing away the thought of her new stepson.

""We should talk about him,"" Alina insisted, her brow furrowing. ""He didn‚Äôt even come to his father‚Äôs wedding, and now there‚Äôs this family dinner where he‚Äôs suddenly going to show up? Sounds like a recipe for disaster to me.""

""I told you, it‚Äôs nothing serious. Stop trying to change the subject.""

""Okay,"" Alina said, leaning forward with a sarcastic grin. ""Let‚Äôs say your marriage crashes‚Äî""

""Why would you even say that?"" Helena gasped, clutching her chest dramatically.

""Because it always does, Mom,"" Alina shot back without hesitation.

""This time it‚Äôs different,"" Helena said firmly. ""I love this man. This is the first time I‚Äôve ever truly been in love.""

Alina rolled her eyes. ""Mom, you‚Äôve said that exact same line with every single husband.""

Helena‚Äôs smile didn‚Äôt falter. ""I‚Äôm serious this time. Charles is the one. My soulmate. My Alpha‚Äî""

Alina snorted, the disbelief clear on her face. ""Sure, Mom. Whatever you say.""

Helena crossed the room and perched on the armrest of Alina‚Äôs chair. Her tone softened as she said, ""Besides, things are going to be different for us now. He‚Äôs already got you a job at his company. You start next week.""

Alina‚Äôs mouth fell open in shock. ""No way! What?!""

Helena smirked. ""Close your mouth, darling. You‚Äôll catch flies.""

""You‚Äôre telling me I have a job at Grayson Enterprises?"" Alina‚Äôs voice rose in disbelief. She had been hunting for months, desperate to land something decent, and now this?

Helena grinned triumphantly. ""Yes. Your momma works fast.""

""Mom‚Äî""

""I need you there too, baby,"" Helena interrupted, her expression softening. ""I can‚Äôt leave you here all by yourself while I‚Äôm staying at Charles‚Äôs house. I don‚Äôt care how old you are; you‚Äôre still my child, and I‚Äôm taking you with me.""

Alina sighed, rubbing her temples. ""Mom""

‚ÄúLet's go shop for what to wear to dinner first then-""

‚ÄúShopping? With what money?‚Äù

Her mother brought out a card smiling. ‚ÄúSay hello to one of my wedding gifts, your momma is rich now baby, get used to it, peasant!‚Äù

Alina rolls her eyes, totally done with her mother.

\---

Later that evening, Alina found herself sitting stiffly at an extravagant table in one of the most exclusive restaurants she had ever seen. The setting was glamorous‚Äîsoft golden lighting, sparkling crystal glasses, and a sense of luxury that felt worlds apart from her reality.

She tried to focus on her wine glass as her mother and Charles exchanged loving glances, oblivious to her discomfort. It was nauseating, really.

Charles broke the silence with a warm smile. ""He'll be here any moment, I'm sorry for his lateness""

Alina‚Äôs grip on her wine glass tightened. The infamous son who supposedly hates her mother.¬†

He's probably going to hate me too.

¬†Wonderful!

Her mother‚Äôs voice cut through her thoughts. ""I'm sure he'll get along with Alina in no time especially since they'll be working together ""

She picked up her wine glass just as the world shifted beneath her.

In the world of werewolves, mating is sacred. The chance of meeting your true mate is incredibly rare.

Most people had adapted to the idea that they might never find theirs. They learned to settle, to form bonds with someone they loved or felt comfortable with.¬†

These bonds weren‚Äôt as intense as the ones shared by true mates, but they worked, allowing for happiness and companionship.

But meeting your true mate? It was undeniable‚Äîlike knowing your own name.

All werewolves carried a similar scent, indistinguishable to others. Until you meet your mate. Their scent would pierce through the ordinary, freezing you to your very core. Their touch would ignite something deep within, electrifying your very soul. When it happened, there was no confusing it.

Alina didn‚Äôt need anyone to explain what was happening now.

The sharp scent of rain mixed with something sweet hit her like a storm, rooting her in place. Her body froze as her gaze snapped to the entrance of the restaurant. The world around her blurred, fading into irrelevance.

And then, he stepped inside.

The scent overwhelmed her, stirring something primal. She wanted to let her wolf loose, to mark and claim him as hers. Her Alpha. Her mate.

His eyes found hers instantly, locking on as if drawn by the same invisible force.

‚ÄúOh, Kyle is here,‚Äù someone said casually, but it barely registered.

The glass slipped from her hand, shattering as it hit the floor.

# Brutal Decision

It didn‚Äôt take long for Helena, Charles, or even the people in the restaurant to understand what had just happened.

Two true mates had found each other.

Alina and Kyle stood frozen, their eyes locked across the room. To most onlookers, it was something beautiful‚Äîa rare and sacred moment when two souls connected by fate finally found each other.

But to Helena, it was horrifying.

She gasped, her hand flying to her mouth, tears welling up in her eyes. ‚ÄúOh my god,‚Äù she whispered, her voice trembling with fear and disbelief.

\---

The drive back to Charles‚Äô mansion was silent, the air thick with tension and confusion.

Once they arrived, Alina was taken to a room with her mother, while Kyle was led to another with his father.

Alina sat on the floor, her back pressed against the wall, tears streaming down her face. Her chest felt heavy, like she could barely breathe under the weight of everything that had happened.

‚ÄúMom, I‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù she choked out, her voice breaking.

Helena sat on the bed, tears of her own slipping silently down her cheeks. She shook her head, her voice thick with emotion. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault, baby. It‚Äôs not your fault.‚Äù

Hearing the pain in her mother‚Äôs voice shattered Alina even more.

The events at the restaurant replayed over and over in her mind, each moment leaving her raw. She had found her mate.

Her mate.

And her mate was her new stepbrother.

Her mother‚Äôs new husband‚Äôs son.

A fresh wave of sobs racked her body as she buried her face in her hands.

‚ÄúStop it, child. Stop it,‚Äù her mother said, though her voice was weak and unconvincing, trembling as she fought back her own tears.

What was she supposed to do?

She couldn‚Äôt destroy her mother‚Äôs new marriage.¬†

But Kyle was her mate. The one chosen for her by the goddess herself.

Her mate.

Helena got up from the bed and knelt beside her daughter, pulling her into a hug. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll figure it out. I promise. Just‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt cry anymore,‚Äù she whispered, though the pain in her voice betrayed her.

Alina leaned into her mother, clutching her tightly. She didn‚Äôt know how to fix this. She didn‚Äôt even know if it could be fixed.

\---

Meanwhile, in another room, Kyle sat on the edge of a leather chair, his arms crossed, frustration etched into his features.

Charles paced the room, his face pale and his hands shaking slightly. ‚ÄúKyle, this is serious. She‚Äôs your mate.‚Äù

Kyle scoffed, running a hand through his hair. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean you don‚Äôt care?‚Äù Charles stopped pacing and turned to his son. ‚ÄúDo you understand what a mate bond is? This isn‚Äôt just some random connection‚Äîit‚Äôs sacred. It‚Äôs fate.‚Äù

Kyle rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúFate? Are you serious, Father? I‚Äôm supposed to drop everything in my life‚Äîeverything I‚Äôve worked for‚Äîand dive into this just because of some bond I didn‚Äôt choose?‚Äù

Charles‚Äô jaw tightened. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just ‚Äòsome bond,‚Äô son. It‚Äôs the mate bond. It‚Äôs the strongest connection a werewolf can have.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, I don‚Äôt care! I‚Äôve never been a fan of this whole ‚Äòmate‚Äô thing. Nobody‚Äînot even the goddess‚Äîgets to choose who I spend my life with. That‚Äôs my decision.‚Äù

Charles tried to calm him, his voice soft but firm. ‚ÄúKyle-‚Äù

‚ÄúFather, I have a girlfriend. Someone I‚Äôve known for years. Someone I love. I'm planning to propose to her soon. What am I supposed to do‚Äîthrow her aside because of some magical bond?‚Äù

Charles sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. ‚ÄúSon, this isn‚Äôt about throwing anyone aside. This is about‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease stop!‚Äù Kyle interrupted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ending your marriage over this nonsense, Father. But I‚Äôll tell you what I will do. I‚Äôll go to her, and we‚Äôll reject each other. End of story.‚Äù

Charles froze, staring at his son in disbelief. ‚ÄúWhat? Are you nuts!‚Äù

Kyle‚Äôs voice was cold and resolute. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll reject her. We‚Äôll both reject the bond, and everyone can move on with their lives. I'm sure she won‚Äôt mind.‚Äù

Nah this was going too far for Charles.

‚ÄúLook, let's just cool off, think about-‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing to think about, let's end it today, now‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just reject her. She‚Äôs your true mate, Kyle, don't do something you'll regret-.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can and I will,‚Äù Kyle said firmly. I don't think I'll be regretting anything father. Let‚Äôs just get this over with.‚Äù

‚ÄúKyle‚Äî‚Äù Charles didn't know how to convince his¬†son. He was heading towards a disaster with this, he could see it.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go, father‚Ä¶‚Äù

# Mutual Rejection?

‚ÄúI think it's best if we reject the bond.‚Äù

Alina felt her entire world crumble around her.

‚ÄúWhat? No!‚Äù her mother cried, rushing forward, tears still streaming down her face.

All Alina could do was stare at the man in front of her. Her Alpha. Her mate. Not only was he proposing rejection, but he didn‚Äôt look like he cared. Not one bit. His expression was cold, detached. It was like this bond between them was nothing but a burden he couldn‚Äôt wait to get rid of.

‚ÄúI have a conference meeting in an hour,‚Äù Kyle said, his tone clipped and impatient. ‚ÄúCan we get this over with?‚Äù

Alina‚Äôs heart shattered even more. His words were sharp, uncaring, cutting deep into her already bleeding soul. To him, this bond didn‚Äôt mean anything. He didn‚Äôt care about her.

‚ÄúPlease, just stop! Please, let‚Äôs just stop‚Äî‚Äù her mother‚Äôs voice broke as she begged, but Alina cut her off.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù she said quietly, her eyes never leaving Kyle. Her voice sounded foreign to her, empty.

‚ÄúBaby, what are you‚Äî‚Äù Her mother looked horrified, desperate to stop what was happening.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, Mom.‚Äù Her tone was lifeless, her gaze still locked on her so-called mate. The one who was supposed to love her. Protect her. Cherish her. Instead, he was ready to throw her away like she meant nothing.

‚ÄúAre you out of your mind? Charles, do something, please!‚Äù her mother pleaded, turning to Kyle‚Äôs father for help.

Charles stepped forward, trying to intervene. ‚ÄúListen‚Äî‚Äù

But the tension in the room was suffocating, so thick that even their parents' desperate attempts to stop them couldn‚Äôt break through it.

Kyle‚Äôs cold eyes met hers. His expression was unreadable, but his voice was firm when he asked, ‚ÄúYour name?‚Äù

She swallowed hard, fighting back the tears threatening to spill. ‚ÄúAlina Morgan,‚Äù she said softly, her heart dropping further with every second.

This was really happening.

The air around them stilled, as if even the world was holding its breath.

Alina watched him, her chest tight, her breaths shallow. Every part of her screamed for him to stop, to change his mind. But deep down, she knew he wouldn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúI, Kyle Grayson‚Äî‚Äù He paused for a moment, and for the briefest second, Alina thought she saw something flicker in his eyes. Was it hesitation? Regret? Or was it nothing at all? Maybe she was just imagining it. Maybe she was just desperate for her mate to feel something.

‚Äú‚Äîreject you, Alina Morgan, and our bond to the moon.‚Äù

It felt like the world collapsed beneath her feet.

Pain like she had never known stabbed through her chest, piercing every part of her. Her wolf howled inside her, the sound echoing in her mind, raw and agonizing. Tears spilled down her cheeks, unbidden, unstoppable.

‚ÄúNo, no!‚Äù her mother screamed, her voice breaking. ‚ÄúPlease, stop! I said stop‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúKyle!‚Äù Charles tried again, his voice firm but tinged with desperation.

But Kyle didn‚Äôt look at them. His focus was entirely on Alina, as if he were waiting, waiting for her to say the words that would seal their rejection.

Alina‚Äôs knees threatened to give out, her body trembling as she tried to process the unbearable pain coursing through her. The mate bond, the one thing every werewolf longed for, was being torn apart before it even had a chance.

She opened her mouth to speak, but the words wouldn‚Äôt come. Her throat felt tight, her voice trapped by the sheer weight of her heartbreak.

Still, she forced herself to speak. She had to. There was no other choice.

‚ÄúI, Alina Morgan,‚Äù her voice broke, trembling with every syllable, ‚Äúaccept your rejection, Kyle Grayson.‚Äù

The moment the words left her lips, the pain intensified. It was like a blade twisting inside her chest, ripping apart every connection her wolf had to her mate.

Her wolf let out one final, mournful howl before retreating deep within her.

She feels herself falling, the world turning dark. The last thing she hears is her mother‚Äôs panicked voice screaming her name.

Then nothing¬†

Darkness‚Ä¶.

# A New Mess

Alina looked around anxiously as she stepped into the airport, her eyes scanning the crowd for her mom. The familiar chaos of arrivals, the hum of chatter, and the rolling of suitcases on tiled floors barely registered as her focus remained singular. The past month had been a blur, one she desperately needed, but now she was home, ready to face what she had left behind.

Yes, Alina had left the country. The rejection had been unbearable. She had woken up in the hospital after her mate, Kyle Grayson, rejected her. The pain had been too much to bear, and her wolf had suffered even more. It felt like every part of her had shattered.

One of the doctors at the hospital had gently suggested she take a vacation, a break from everything, to give her wolf the space and time to accept the rejection fully. The idea had sounded absurd at first, but eventually, she realized it was her only option to heal.

Charles Grayson, her stepfather, had immediately stepped in to cover all the expenses, insisting she take as much time as she needed. And so, Alina had left, staying away for more than a month.

Now, standing at the airport, she felt a mix of emotions. She was ready to move on‚Äîor at least she hoped she was.

Her mother‚Äôs scream of delight snapped her out of her thoughts. ""Alina!""

Before Alina could react, her mother enveloped her in a tight hug, tears streaming down her face. ""Oh, baby, I missed you so much!""

Alina hugged her back just as tightly, her own tears threatening to fall. ""Missed you too, Mom,"" she whispered, her voice thick with emotion.

Charles stood nearby, watching with a kind smile. Her mother had been right‚ÄîCharles was a good man. He had been nothing but supportive throughout everything. Alina greeted him warmly, smiling up at him.

""Welcome home, Alina,"" Charles said, his tone genuine.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù she replied softly.

For the first time in weeks, a part of her felt at peace. Maybe, in some strange way, the rejection had been a blessing in disguise. At least now, her mother could have the happiness she truly deserved.

\---

Later, Alina sat cross-legged on the bed in the room assigned to her in the Grayson mansion. Yes, she had finally agreed to move in. It had taken some convincing, but in the end, she realized it was the best way forward for her family.

Her legs rested on her mother‚Äôs lap as they sat together, talking quietly. Her fingers absentmindedly played with the hem of her sweater as her mother gently ran a hand through her hair.

‚ÄúAre you sure about the job, baby?‚Äù her mother asked, her voice laced with worry.

‚ÄúMom, I told you, I‚Äôm fine,‚Äù Alina replied, trying to sound more confident than she felt. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get the urge to‚Ä¶ jump my stepbrother anymore. The bond is dead and broken. We‚Äôre siblings now. It‚Äôs best we start getting along.‚Äù

Her mother didn‚Äôt look convinced. ‚ÄúAre you sure, baby?‚Äù

‚ÄúPositive,‚Äù Alina lied. She forced a small smile, trying to reassure her mother. ‚ÄúBesides, it‚Äôs my fault for losing the other position. A company like that wasn‚Äôt going to keep the role vacant forever, waiting for me.‚Äù She sighed, the weight of her words settling heavily on her shoulders.

Charles had reassured her that another position would open soon, and she would be first in line for it. But for now, the only available role was as Kyle‚Äôs personal assistant. His previous assistant was going on maternity leave, and the position was temporary‚Äîjust a few months.

Alina had frozen when her mother first told her about it a week ago. The thought of working so closely with Kyle made her stomach churn. But how long could she keep avoiding him? Their parents were happily married, and she knew they all needed to learn to coexist.

‚ÄúWhen do I start?‚Äù Alina asked, her voice steady despite the turmoil in her chest.

‚ÄúTomorrow‚Äîor whenever you‚Äôre ready,‚Äù her mother replied cautiously.

‚ÄúTomorrow is fine,‚Äù Alina said, nodding.

‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù her mother asked again, her concern evident in her eyes.

‚ÄúPositive,‚Äù Alina said firmly.

But she lied.

# Thrown in Together

Kyle sat behind his polished desk, trying to focus on the report in front of him, but his mind kept drifting. Alina was starting today. His father had informed him a week ago, and Kyle‚Äôs initial response had been a resounding ‚Äúno.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou need a personal assistant, Kyle,‚Äù his father had insisted. ‚ÄúAlina‚Äôs qualified, and she‚Äôs willing. You‚Äôve been rejecting every candidate.‚Äù

Kyle hadn‚Äôt been able to argue. If Alina had agreed to the position, why should he have a problem with it? She seemed determined to move forward, so why couldn‚Äôt he?

Still, he couldn‚Äôt shake the unease that had settled in his chest since learning the news. He had rejected her, and the aftermath had been‚Ä¶ messy. Kyle could lie to everyone else, but not to himself. The guilt of how the rejection had affected her bites at him sometimes.

He also couldn‚Äôt ignore another truth: sometimes, he missed her. It was irrational, frustrating, and confusing. How could he miss someone he didn‚Äôt truly know?

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing,‚Äù he muttered to himself, shaking his head. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù

When his intercom buzzed, his secretary‚Äôs voice cut through his thoughts. ‚ÄúMr. Grayson, Alina is here.‚Äù

Kyle‚Äôs heart nearly leaped out of his chest. His pulse raced, and he felt an uncharacteristic wave of nervousness wash over him.¬†

Kyle doesn't get nervous, he doesn't do nervous, what the fuck?

He straightened his tie, ran a hand through his hair, and took a deep breath to compose himself.

‚ÄúSend her in,‚Äù he said, his voice calm and clipped, betraying none of the chaos within.

The door opened, and the moment his eyes landed on Alina, his heart slammed against his ribcage.

She stepped into the office with a quiet confidence, her posture straight, her chin held high. She looked stunning‚Äîmore radiant than he remembered. Her sleek hair framed her face perfectly, her eyes sparkling with a determined light.

Kyle‚Äôs head spun, and his composure wavered for just a second. What the hell is wrong with me? he thought, forcing himself to maintain a stoic expression.

‚ÄúGood morning Sir‚Äù Alina said politely, her voice calm and professional.

‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù he replied, his tone neutral as he rose to his feet.

They exchanged pleasantries, but Kyle could barely focus on her words. All he could notice was how gorgeous she looked and how her eyes seemed to shine even brighter now. His gaze involuntarily dropped to her lips before he caught himself.

He clenched his jaw and shook his head slightly, forcing his thoughts back on track.

‚ÄúMrs. Danie will teach you everything you need to know over the next few days,‚Äù he said, gesturing to his secretary.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll do my best, sir,‚Äù Alina replied with a small, confident smile.

‚ÄúMr. Grayson will do,‚Äù he corrected her quickly.

His eyes lingered on her for a fraction too long before he cleared his throat. The air-conditioned room felt stifling, and he realized, to his embarrassment, that he was sweating under his perfectly tailored suit.

‚ÄúYou can leave now,‚Äù he said abruptly, his voice firmer than he intended.

Alina nodded, her expression neutral as she turned and left the office, following Mrs. Danie.

The moment the door closed, Kyle sank back into his chair, his head falling into his hands.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck just happened?‚Äù he muttered under his breath.

Did he really just fucking feel like kissing the life out of his step sister?... The mate he rejected?

He must be insane!

# Second thoughts

Mrs. Daine walked Alina through the large office building, her heels clicking on the polished floors as they moved from department to department.¬†

Each introduction was the same‚Ä¶A polite smile from Alina, a quick nod from the employees, and then they moved on.

‚ÄúThis is Marketing,‚Äù Mrs. Daine said, gesturing toward a cluster of sleek desks occupied by people in sharp suits. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll likely coordinate with them for campaign approvals. They‚Äôre efficient, but deadlines are non-negotiable here.‚Äù

Alina nodded, pasting on a smile that barely reached her eyes. ‚ÄúGot it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd here‚Äôs Finance,‚Äù Mrs. Daine continued as they stepped into another brightly lit floor. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre responsible for budgets, payroll, and keeping Mr. Grayson‚Äôs projects on track. You‚Äôll be working with them quite a bit.‚Äù

Alina tried to focus, taking in every detail Mrs. Daine shared, but her mind kept drifting.¬†

Can she really do this?

She was really going to be Kyle Grayson‚Äôs personal assistant? She wanted to believe it was a decision she made out of practicality but‚Ä¶

\_\_\_\_

By the end of the week, Alina had managed to settle into her new role. She memorized schedules, familiarized herself with the company‚Äôs workflow, and avoided Kyle as much as she could.

Even though that was impossible since she was literally working directly under him.

Alina tries to stay positive¬†

She reminded herself every morning: He isn‚Äôt your mate. You rejected each other. You‚Äôre just step-siblings now.

But it didn‚Äôt feel that way.

There were moments when she caught herself staring too long or when his scent lingered in the air longer than it should. She hated how her body betrayed her, how her wolf stirred even at the smallest hint of his presence.

She told herself it would pass. She just needed more time.

\_\_\_

On Friday, just as the office began winding down for the weekend, Mrs Daine approached Alina‚Äôs desk. ‚ÄúMr. Grayson has requested for our presence in his office.‚Äù

Alina‚Äôs stomach twisted. She grabbed her notebook, smoothing out her skirt before making her way to his office. Mrs. Daine joined her in the hallway, giving her an encouraging smile.

Inside, Kyle sat behind his imposing desk, his expression unreadable. The floor-to-ceiling windows behind him showcased a breathtaking view of the city, but Alina barely noticed. Her focus was on him, on the way he leaned back in his chair, exuding an air of authority.

‚ÄúTake a seat,‚Äù Kyle said, gesturing to the chairs in front of him.

Alina lowered herself into the seat beside Mrs. Daine, her back straight, her hands folded neatly in her lap. She refused to let him see how nervous she was.

‚ÄúSo, Mrs. Daine,‚Äù Kyle began, his deep voice filling the room, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your assessment of Miss Morgan?‚Äù

Mrs. Daine glanced at Alina before answering. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs done exceptionally well. Quick learner, organized, and professional. She‚Äôll do great in this role.‚Äù

Alina smiled politely, grateful for the praise but uneasy under Kyle‚Äôs steady gaze.

Kyle‚Äôs eyes flicked to her for a brief moment before returning to Mrs. Daine. ‚ÄúSo, she‚Äôs ready?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe is,‚Äù Mrs. Daine affirmed.

Kyle‚Äôs attention shifted back to Alina. His expression was cold, detached, as if she were just another employee and not the woman he was destined to be with by the moon.

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù Kyle said, turning back to Mrs. Daine. ‚ÄúYour leave begins today. If you finalize your decision to relocate, please inform the company a month in advance. I wish you the best.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you, Mr. Grayson,‚Äù Mrs. Daine said, standing.

Kyle‚Äôs gaze lingered on Alina as Mrs. Daine left the room. The door clicked shut, leaving them alone.

Alina‚Äôs pulse quickened. She braced herself for‚Ä¶ something. A comment, a question, anything. But Kyle simply flipped through the files on his desk, his expression unreadable.

Finally, he spoke, his tone dismissive. ‚ÄúSee you on Monday, Miss Morgan.‚Äù

Alina froze, the formality of his words cutting through her like a blade. She nodded stiffly, standing and leaving without a word.

The second she was out of his office, she exhaled shakily. Her chest felt heavy, her wolf restless. She leaned against the wall for support, closing her eyes and letting the emptiness of the hallway swallow¬†her.

Can she really do this?

This is really looking like a bad idea.

# Ready To Start

The sun shone brightly as Alina and her mother, Helena, exited the house and headed toward the mall. Helena had insisted they spend the day shopping, claiming Alina needed a new wardrobe for her job. Alina hadn‚Äôt argued.¬†

In the end she didn‚Äôt have the energy to resist her mother‚Äôs determination.

As they walked into the bustling shopping center, Helena was already pointing out stores. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll start here. You need blouses, skirts, slacks, maybe even a few dresses. And shoes, definitely shoes.‚Äù

‚ÄúMom,‚Äù Alina groaned, trailing behind her. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need a full closet change‚Äù

‚ÄúNonsense! You‚Äôre working as a secretary now. You need to look sharp, professional, and confident.‚Äù Helena paused, glancing over her shoulder. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt roll your eyes at me. I saw that.‚Äù

Alina bit back a laugh, shaking her head as her mother marched into the first store.

\_\_\_

The day was filled with Alina trying on clothes, swapping sizes, and Helena snapping photos of Alina in each outfit. They moved from store to store, their arms gradually filling with bags of new office attire.

‚ÄúI think this is enough,‚Äù Alina said as they exited the fifth store.

‚ÄúEnough? We‚Äôre just getting started!‚Äù Helena declared, a mischievous glint in her eyes.

‚ÄúMom, I‚Äôm not running a fashion show.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou could‚Äôve fooled me with how gorgeous you look in that last dress,‚Äù Helena teased, bumping Alina‚Äôs shoulder.

By the time they finished shopping, Alina was exhausted. She flopped into the nearest chair at a small little restaurant while Helena ordered them drinks and snacks.

As they sipped their beverages, Helena couldn‚Äôt stop herself from watching Alina closely. It had been a few tough months for her daughter. The rejection, the hospital stay, the vacation, the move‚Ä¶ It was a lot for anyone to handle, and yet, here Alina was, putting on a brave face.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve told you to stop looking at me like that. I‚Äôm fine,‚Äù Alina said suddenly, breaking Helena‚Äôs train of thought.

Helena feigned innocence. ‚ÄúNow I can‚Äôt look at you anymore?‚Äù

Alina sighed, shaking her head as she took another sip of her drink. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ I know what you‚Äôre thinking, and you don‚Äôt need to worry.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help it. I just feel like it‚Äôll be hard working beside him,‚Äù Helena said, her voice gentle but concerned.

Alina rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúWe rejected each other. There‚Äôs no bond anymore. And like I‚Äôve said a million times already, it‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm okay.‚Äù

Helena studied her daughter for a few seconds, her expression softening. Finally, she nodded. ‚ÄúOkay, fine. If you say so.‚Äù

The moment was interrupted by someone clearing their throat nearby. Alina glanced up, her heart skipping a beat as recognition hit her. Standing in front of their table was Paul, one of her mother‚Äôs ex-husbands.

‚ÄúHelena,‚Äù Paul said, his tone warm but surprised.

‚ÄúPaul,‚Äù Helena replied, standing to greet him.

The two exchanged polite smiles, and Alina couldn‚Äôt help but notice the slight blush on her mother‚Äôs cheeks.

‚ÄúYou look so good,‚Äù Paul said, his gaze lingering on Helena.

Helena‚Äôs smile grew wider. ‚ÄúOh, thank you. You‚Äôre looking well yourself.‚Äù

Paul‚Äôs attention shifted to Alina, his smile widening. ‚ÄúLook at you, Alina. You‚Äôre so grown now.‚Äù

Alina nodded politely, unsure how to respond. She barely remembered Paul, her mother had been married to him for only four months, and they hadn‚Äôt exactly bonded.

‚ÄúGood to see you, Mr. Paul,‚Äù she said, managing a small smile.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to see you both,‚Äù Paul replied. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, he handed Helena his phone.

‚ÄúHere,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs exchange numbers. It‚Äôs been too long.‚Äù

Helena hesitated for a moment before typing her number into his phone. They chatted for a few more minutes before Paul excused himself and left their table.

Alina turned to her mother, raising an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWhy did you exchange numbers with him?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Helena asked, playing dumb.

‚ÄúI said, why did you exchange numbers with him? I remember you deleting his number after you broke up,‚Äù Alina said, crossing her arms.

Helena shrugged, brushing off the question. ‚ÄúBecause I was hurt back then. I‚Äôm over it now. We don‚Äôt have to be enemies, you know. It‚Äôs nothing.‚Äù

Alina gave her mother a skeptical look but decided not to press further. She returned to her drink, mulling over the odd interaction.

After a few moments of silence, Helena spoke again. ‚ÄúReady for work on Monday?‚Äù

The first word that popped into Alina‚Äôs head was no, but instead, she forced a smile and said, ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

Helena studied her daughter for a moment, her eyes filled with motherly concern. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sure?‚Äù

Alina nodded. ‚ÄúPositive.‚Äù

But as she sipped her drink, her mind raced with uncertainty. She wasn‚Äôt ready‚Äîfar from it. But she didn‚Äôt have a choice.

# Monday Relief

Alina woke up to the sound of her alarm blaring at six in the morning. She groaned, her body reluctant to cooperate as she reached to turn it off. Today was the day‚Äîthe first day of her new job. The thought made her so freaking nervous.

Her mother, Helena, had already been up for an hour, bustling around the kitchen. As Alina got ready, Helena poked her head into her room.

‚ÄúAre you sure about that blouse? Maybe something darker would look more professional,‚Äù her mom said, eyeing her with a critical but loving gaze.

‚ÄúMom, this is fine,‚Äù Alina replied, smoothing the hem of her light-blue shirt.

‚ÄúWell, at least let me pack your lunch,‚Äù Helena insisted.

Alina sighed. ‚ÄúMom, I told you, the office provides lunch.‚Äù

Helena waved her off. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better to have something from home. You never know.‚Äù

By the time Alina left the house, her mother had handed her a neatly packed lunchbox. It was a small gesture, but it made her feel both cared for and slightly coddled.

The journey to the company felt like an eternity. Her nerves were a tangled mess, tightening with every step closer to the towering building.

Before heading in, she made a stop at the caf√© across the street to grab Kyle‚Äôs morning coffee. Mrs. Daine had emphasized how important it was to get his order right. ‚ÄúHe likes it black, no sugar,‚Äù she‚Äôd said.

Balancing the coffee in one hand and her bag in the other, Alina stepped into the grand lobby of the company. The atmosphere was intimidating, filled with people walking hurriedly around her, phones ringing, and an air of focus so thick it was almost suffocating.

She made it to her desk without much trouble and took a moment to collect herself before walking into Kyle‚Äôs office.",1,1753518667.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The best cup holders for walkers in 2025 are distinguished by a combination of innovative design and practical functionality. These models prioritize ease of use, stability, and compatibility with a wide range of walker types.

**Universal Clamp Design:**

A universal clamp design is crucial for ensuring compatibility with various walker frames. The ideal cup holder features an adjustable clamp that can securely attach to different tubing sizes and shapes. This adaptability allows users to easily install the cup holder on their specific walker model without the need for specialized tools or modifications. The clamp should also incorporate non-slip padding to prevent scratching or damage to the walker frame while maintaining a firm grip.

**Anti-Spill Construction:**

An anti-spill construction is essential for preventing accidental spills and messes while navigating with a walker. This feature typically involves a deep cup well with a secure grip to hold various cup sizes and shapes. Some models also include a flexible silicone insert that conforms to the shape of the cup, providing added stability and preventing movement during use. The base of the cup holder should be designed to minimize tipping or wobbling, even on uneven surfaces.

**Durable Materials:**

The durability of the cup holder is directly related to the materials used in its construction. High-quality ABS plastic or stainless steel are common choices for their resistance to impacts, weather, and general wear and tear. The materials should also be easy to clean and maintain, ensuring long-lasting use. Reinforced joints and sturdy construction are critical for preventing breakage or deformation over time, especially with regular use.

**360-Degree Rotation:**

The ability to rotate the cup holder 360 degrees offers enhanced convenience and flexibility. This feature allows users to adjust the angle of the cup holder to accommodate different walking positions or to avoid obstacles. The rotation mechanism should be smooth and easy to operate, allowing for quick adjustments without requiring excessive force. A locking mechanism is also important to secure the cup holder in the desired position and prevent unwanted movement.

**Easy Installation and Removal:**

Simple installation and removal are key for user convenience. The best cup holders feature a tool-free design that allows users to quickly attach or detach the cup holder from their walker without the need for specialized tools. The clamp should be easy to open and close, and the overall installation process should be intuitive and straightforward. This ease of use is particularly important for individuals with limited dexterity or mobility.

Key features of top-rated cup holders for walkers include:
* Universal compatibility with various walker types
* Anti-spill design to prevent messes
* Durable construction for long-lasting use
* 360-degree rotation for flexible positioning
* Easy tool-free installation and removal

## Core Benefits

The advantages of using a high-quality cup holder for a walker extend beyond simple convenience, significantly impacting the user's safety, independence, and overall quality of life.

**Enhanced Safety and Stability:** A secure cup holder prevents the need to juggle drinks or other items while using a walker, reducing the risk of falls and accidents. By keeping hands free, users can maintain better balance and control, especially when navigating uneven surfaces or crowded areas. The anti-spill design further minimizes the risk of messes that could create slippery or hazardous conditions.

**Increased Independence and Convenience:** With a reliable cup holder, individuals can enjoy beverages or carry essential items like medication or small personal belongings without assistance. This promotes greater independence and allows users to participate more fully in daily activities, such as walks in the park, shopping trips, or social gatherings. The convenience of having a readily accessible drink encourages hydration, which is particularly important for older adults.

**Improved Hydration and Well-being:** Staying hydrated is crucial for maintaining overall health and cognitive function, especially for individuals with mobility challenges. A cup holder makes it easier to keep a water bottle or other beverage within reach, encouraging regular hydration throughout the day. This can help prevent dehydration-related symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness, and confusion, contributing to improved well-being and quality of life.

**Reduced Strain and Effort:** Carrying drinks or other items while using a walker can put unnecessary strain on the hands, arms, and shoulders. A cup holder eliminates the need to grip or balance items, reducing physical effort and minimizing the risk of muscle fatigue or pain. This is particularly beneficial for individuals with arthritis or other conditions that affect their joints.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions about cup holders for walkers helps potential buyers make informed decisions and ensures they select a product that meets their specific needs.

**Will this cup holder fit my specific walker model?**
Yes, most of the top-rated cup holders feature a universal clamp design that is compatible with a wide range of walker models. The adjustable clamp can accommodate different tubing sizes and shapes, ensuring a secure fit. However, it's always recommended to check the product specifications and measurements to confirm compatibility with your specific walker.

**Is the cup holder easy to clean?**
Yes, the materials used in most cup holders are designed for easy cleaning and maintenance. Typically, a damp cloth and mild soap are sufficient to remove any spills or dirt. Some models may also feature removable inserts or components that can be washed separately for more thorough cleaning. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, as these can damage the surface of the cup holder.

**How stable is the cup holder on uneven surfaces?**
The stability of the cup holder depends on its design and construction. Models with a deep cup well, anti-spill features, and a secure clamp tend to be more stable on uneven surfaces. Some cup holders also incorporate a weighted base or non-slip padding to further enhance stability. However, it's important to exercise caution when navigating particularly rough or uneven terrain, as even the most stable cup holder may be susceptible to tipping.

**Can the cup holder accommodate different cup sizes?**
Yes, most cup holders are designed to accommodate a variety of cup sizes and shapes. The cup well is typically wide enough to hold standard-sized water bottles, coffee cups, and other beverage containers. Some models also include flexible inserts or adjustable features that can accommodate smaller or larger cups. However, it's always a good idea to check the product specifications to ensure that the cup holder is compatible with the types of cups you typically use.

1m9o5td,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1m9o5td/i_30m_quiet_quit_a_friendship_how_do_i_move/,"I (30M) ""quiet quit"" a friendship. How do I move forward with this person (27M) who now ~seems~ to want to fix it?","Hey, Reddit. First time poster, so hopefully I don't mess anything up. Probably going to be a long one; let me know if this should be on a different sub-Reddit. Tried to steer clear of the moral judgment stuff, just want advice on how to proceed.

TL;DR: friend of 5+ years got tired of our friend group, joined a group of people, seemed to change a lot, and I ""quiet quit"" our friendship. Now he wants the opportunity to talk about everything and I'm not even sure I want to have the conversation.

Before I get into this, I want to acknowledge that I know I haven't made the most mature decisions at every turn here and I know there's some accountability I need to take as well.

For context, we are both gay - it matters - and had a really strong friend group of 6 of us a few years ago. As gay people, your friend group really is your chosen family. We've had bumps in the road before, but we've worked through them and they've usually not seemed so monumental. Fast forward a few years, and, as seems common among friends as they age, we started hanging out less and less because people got busy with relationships, work, etc. For a long time, it seemed as though everyone understood that it just happens and I, at least, never had any issue with it because I felt like this was my family and I knew I could go to them for anything at anytime no matter what.

Our friend group was the type to go out on the weekends, get a little too crazy, then recover on Sundays together with food and movies all day. Don't worry, we did a lot more than just that - chill nights in, running errands together, going on trips. Hell, I even had this friend - we'll call him Danny - come over to my family's Thanksgiving when his family all got COVID. That being said, as the friend group slowed down how much we were going out, Danny started to get involved with another friend group. I don't know how else to say it, I generally do not enjoy being around these people. I really tried several times - I would join him with them, etc. They just seemed like your classic Mean Girls types of gays - going to the bars, being rude to people they didn't find attractive, talking badly about people, making sure all the fun parts of their night ended up on social media. I tried to get to know them in several different settings and they just didn't seem too interested in having me around either. Fine, not the end of the world. However, slowly but surely, my friend seemed as though he was becoming more like them, saying things about people and treating people (not me, originally) in ways I feel like he never would've before. This was the primary concern.

Over the course of the following months, it seemed as like Danny was starting to consider me an after-thought. I'd text him to see what his plans were and he would respond hours later - also unlike him - saying, ""oh, we're all at x bar, you can come if you want."" Like. Excuse me, I can go wherever I want as far as the bars go, but it was situations like that over and over of me initiating and him always making me feel like I was just that friend you don't really want around but you invite because you feel like you kind of have to. One night, I was at the bars and I went a little too far with my drinking and Danny had to get me home. Is that ok? No, not really. It is something we've all done for each other over the years and, unfortunately at the time, our mindset was kind of like, ""well, it happens sometimes, eat more before we go out next time."" We've matured since then, I have alcoholism in my family and there have been some wake-up calls since then, etc etc. A few days later, another weird invite situation happened and I was starting to lose patience. I texted the friend and said, ""Hey, I'm not really sure what's changed, but it feels like you really don't want to hang out with me anymore. Can we talk soon?"" The friend said sure. We get on FaceTime and he says, ""I actually need to tell you something first. I'm not ok with you drinking like that anymore and I don't want to have to take care of you."" In the course of the conversation, he did call me an alcoholic, which, reflecting back from over a year later, I can say was a little harsh. It scared me, I took a month off drinking completely, and I've made a lot of positive changes since and rarely even go out to the bar scene, but I still feel as though it was a touch too far. All that to say, that entire conversation was about THAT, and when he was done, he was like, ""ok well I'm here for you. Anyway, I have to go,"" and we never got to talk about the reason I initiated our conversation, so I was still left in the dark to some degree, thinking well this must have been it for why it feels like you don't want to hang out with me... but there's a gap. We hung out sober all the time, so it couldn't just be this. 

  
After that, our relationship was pretty obviously strained. I started going crazy thinking about where I may be causing issues myself. Was I being controlling or possessive or jealous that he'd found new friends? Honestly, I thought this theory had some weight for a bit, until I started hearing some of the things coming out of his mouth about other people. To heck with anonymity if someone finds this I guess, but one of the comments he made was about a man who was stringing him along romantically and he said, ""James (fake name) isn't tall enough to be acting like that."" My friend would've never said that about someone months before. Ever. I could tell my friend was changing, influenced by these people, in ways that I didn't like and, more importantly, in ways that I don't think he would like if he took a step back. 

Months later, he saw me out with some coworkers with a beer in my hand and he said, ""wow, I'm really proud of how you've been able to safely reintegrate drinking into your life,"" and it just made me so upset, because he wasn't there for me during that time of reflection and self-discovery at all. For all he knew, I had just blacked out the night before. He didn't know at all, and it felt as though he was happy for me in that particular moment because I seemed fine and I truly believe he was patting himself on the back a little bit for being the one that called it out. It just felt so assuming and weirdly violating at the same time.

I moved apartments and ended up being much, much closer to him (I was 12 minutes away before and now lived in. the. same. complex.), and all of a sudden he wanted to hang out more (who knew 12 minutes was an eternity). Given the above, it felt like it was just becoming a friendship of convenience or loneliness. When we would get together or even talk on the phone, every single conversation always seemed to revolve around him. I was going for a huge promotion - career talks were always a HUGE part of our relationship, since we have similar career mindsets and are in similar fields, compared to some of our other friends who weren't - and he didn't seem to care at all. Every conversation (career or otherwise) would start off being about him, he'd talk for sometimes 20-30 minutes straight about himself, he'd then pause and say, ""so, how are you?,"" look at his text messages while I was answering the question, give a response like, ""oh wow, that's crazy,"" and then change the subject back to himself. All the while, I'm still the person he's FaceTiming crying at 2am while he's drunk walking home from a bar over that same boy. Over. and over. and over. and over. The friendship just more and more felt like I was giving and he was receiving. I've never thought of friendships as transactional, but this wasn't that. The balance felt like our friendship was 99% about him and 1% about me. He didn't seem to notice or care, can't be sure which.

Another example, right after we had both moved into our current (yes, current, we both still live here) apartment complex, he had the idea that ""we"" should throw a housewarming party. I agreed. He sat on my couch and started planning while I was meal prepping for the week. Well. He made the entire guest list without asking for any input. I said, ""well, did you invite x? did you invite y?"" and that was about the only contributions of mine he accepted. I checked our Partiful (website where you can send mass party invites) about a week later, and all of a sudden he'd decided on an entire theme as well? The week of the party, I offered to help - get snacks, etc. He'd already gotten all the decorations for the theme he invented without any input. Both before and after the party, I offered to send him money for it, which he just ignored. Anyway, night of the party, he treats me like he hired me to help or something. Has me running up and down stairs to get things like tape, wine opener, etc, while he's entertaining. And who was invited? You guessed it. This group of friends that do not like me and, at this point, vice versa. So, I left. I left quietly, I didn't make a scene, there was no point in doing that. But it wasn't ""our"" party, it was his party. And he knew that. He texted me to ask where I went and I said, ""I'm sorry, this is not ""our"" party, this is your party, and I'm not comfortable with those people, so I left quietly so as not to make a scene."" He texted back ""I'm sorry :("" and that was it.

So, I started to pull back. In past conflicts between this particular friend and other members of our original friend group (where I was often a mediator), he's been particularly stubborn. He has said that people should have to come to him if they want him in his life. He has a really hard time seeing things through the eyes of other people until something really drastic happens. That, coupled with everything that had been happening, made me feel like any effort to talk to him would just be pointless and frustrating. Looking back, this is probably where the ""adult thing"" would have been to just have the dang conversation. But at this point, it was exhausting me, it was causing me anxiety, and I just felt like the only thing I could do to protect my peace was to slowly back out of the friendship. He'd ask to hang out on a Saturday morning, and I'd explain to him I was meal prepping or doing errands and he was welcome to join and I'd make him coffee, and he would change his mind about hanging out. He stopped inviting me to things and I stopped inviting him to things. Slowly, our friendship just fell away to nothing. I unfollowed him on social media - not to be petty, but because every time I saw his posts and him doing things, it just made me sad.

Around Thanksgiving, one of our original friend group friends - we'll call him Frank - was coming into town (he'd moved halfway across the country since ""the old days"") and so I was prepared to put on a happy face, play nice, and be around Danny. We did. The night was mostly fine. Then, at 2am, Danny, drunk (him, not me, my drinking has slowed way way down), says, ""I know we're not good right now, but whenever you're ready to talk, so am I."" I was flabbergasted but also pretty annoyed. The high road would have been to take the opportunity, but I was just so mad that the only time he had the nerve to say anything to me was drunk at 2am. Whether it was the clarity you get when you stop blacking out on the weekends or just pure petty rage, I couldn't be sure at the time, but I told him it wasn't the time.

At Christmas, same situation, Frank in town. We see Danny at the bar with his friends, I said something to him - an excited hello kind of thing - and he looked me dead in the eyes and then turned away. For me, that was the straw that broke the camel's back. In that moment, our friendship was long gone with no chance of things coming back, in my mind.

(Nearing the end I promise)

Cut to this week. I get a text message from another friend in the original friend group (we'll go with Shawn) that says, ""Guess who I just had coffee with."" Immediately, I knew. Shawn was really impressed by how remorseful our ""friend"" was (he had basically burned us all in different ways over the year and cut out/been cut out by all of us individually) and Shawn, in my experience with him, was not the type to easily forgive or trust that someone is actually sorry. I was shocked. Shawn said they talked about me and that he was very sorry and knew he needed to talk to me, but didn't have the courage to send the text message to ask to get coffee or whatever. Shawn agreed that he would text me about the situation first. I understand not having the courage, but after ALL of this where communication has been the issue (on both sides at times, to be fair) and using Shawn to ""warm me up,"" essentially, really got on my nerves yet again. However, I get it. These conversations are hard. And as the person who was often the mediator in our group, I do think it's hard to have conflict with me because I was usually the one coaching these guys on how to have hard conversations - use ""I think, I feel"" statements instead of accusatory ones, don't make assumptions about what motivated someone's actions, use specific examples like, ""when you did this, it made me feel this way, whether or not that was the intent,"" stuff like that, so I think that intimidates him a little bit and I can understand that.

So here's where I am Reddit. It's been two days since Shawn and Danny had coffee and I still haven't heard from him. I have so many mixed feelings about the situation, but deep down, I feel like the conversation would be good, regardless of how it results. I have had a lot of pent-up anger over this situation, as well as extreme sadness. This has hit me harder than any relationship break-up in my adult life and I feel like the conversation would give me closure. My current plan, should he reach out, is to agree to the conversation. I want to start it off by saying that I'm not there to just dunk on him. I want to have an open and honest conversation about how we both experienced the last year, take accountability for the quiet quitting and not starting conversations sooner. This may not be right, but I don't actually regret my decisions around pulling back, but I do feel like I need to apologize because it was probably hurtful and/or confusing for him at the time. I also want to say out the gate that I'm not sure where we go after the conversation, but the one thing I do know is that I'm not going to be able to just full-force jump back into the friendship and fully trust him so quickly. However, I also don't want him to feel like he has to ""say the right things,"" or, ""say what I want to hear,"" I just want him to be genuine and I want to make sure I make him comfortable enough to do that, even if those genuine things may be... well... not great lol. Another part of me says is it even worth it? Does he deserve this type of closure? Does he deserve the opportunity to explain himself or do I stick to my guns on protecting my peace? I realized while typing... I'm not at peace. Not really. But more peaceful than I was when he was around. Do I do this for my own closure?

So, Reddit, I'm coming to you for advice. How do I move forward? How do I best set up the conversation to achieve what I've said above? How do I communicate my feelings in a way that won't put him on defense? How do I know what to do next once the conversation is had?

It hurts, & I feel like I'm not allowed to grieve","My beautiful nonina died 2 weeks ago. Nonina means 'little grandmother' in Italian. She and my nonno were like the foundation of my world. And they gave me a foundation of love.

I loved her so, so much. I loved her so much.

For me, it's like day 2 or 3 of grief, because I've been dealing with some horrible medical issues. I thought I felt fine about her death. Turns out it was a coping mechanism.

Feeling the loss *and* the physical pain of illness must just have been too much. When the physical pain subsided, the grief pain kicked in. *Wow* it hurts.

I already feel like I'm expected to be 'over it.' When I tell people irl, the amount of sympathy I get feels about the same as the amount of sympathy you get when you tell someone you've had a bad cold. 'Sorry to hear that, feel better soon!'

Some people jump straight to 'it's wonderful that she had such a good long life' or 'you must be relieved that she's not suffering anymore.' Others tell me about the relief they felt when their own ailing grandparents passed, or that they weren't really affected by their deaths.

I would just like to say... fuck those people. They're the grief equivalent of a shitty boss who tells you to take a cold and flu tablet and get back to work.

Or a shitty colleague who tells you airily, 'oh, I don't really get sick. And if I ever do, I just power through it!' The implication being that you should stop being such a crybaby and power through it, too.

Like, congratulations. I'm glad you don't get sick, because being sick sucks. And I totally understand that people have different relationships with their grandparents, and different ways of processing grief and making sense of loss. I'm not trying to take anyone's coping mechanisms away from anyone.

But for fuck's sake, why am I not allowed to feel this?

I know she was old. I know death is a normal and natural part of life. I know it's good she's not suffering anymore. I know she had poor quality of life towards the end. I know it wasn't getting better. I know she wanted to go be with my nonno. I know I was damn lucky that at 94, she could still laugh about the things I did as a baby. I know nothing wrong or bad has happened. I know that I haven't lost a child or a spouse or a sibling or a parent. *I know.*

I know, I know, I know. Guess what? *It hurts anyway. I miss her anyway.* Yes, I know that I will feel happy again eventually. But right now, I am grieving. And that's okay.

While I am on the subject, some people have even implied that if I feel sad about this, it must be because I haven't known more 'real' grief. I would like to say fuck those people, too.

One of my best friends in the entire world died unexpectedly, age 37. He was my first love, and after we broke up, we were chosen family. I still have the skirt I was wearing to go to a costume party when I got the nightmare phone call telling me he'd had a freak stroke and there was too much intracranial bleeding for there to be any hope of recovery.

I lost my beloved cousin and two uncles to suicide. Can't even talk about that right now.

So don't tell me it hurts because I'm some kind of grief virgin. This is not my first time at the rodeo of the saddest goodbye. I'm an experienced cowgirl, and it's still a rough ride. Both those things can be true at once.

No. I'm not coming to your stupid party where I know you'll expect me to answer 'so what have you been up to lately?' with something that isn't 'being sick and then grieving the death of one of the most important people in my entire life.'

I'm not meeting you for a stupid coffee where you're going to vent to me about your stupid boyfriend and your stupid creative projects like everything is normal. Because it's not normal for me.

I hate everything. Ok, well, I know I don't. But I feel that way right now, and I know that if I don't feel it, I will be stuck with that anger and it will eat me. Feeling it turns the tables. I have to taste and swallow this hot dish of rage so I can swallow so that eventually I can digest everything and let it pass through me.

Ti amo tanto, bella nonina. I love you very much, beautiful little grandmother. Nonno lives inside me, laughing and telling his stories. Soon you will join him there. You will be happier with him, I think. I know you weren't happy after he died. I am just not used to not having you here with me yet. I have to accept, just like you said I would.

Ti amo tanto, tanto tanto. Always the last words I said to you before I left, so that when the time came, I could live knowing that my last words were words of love.",7,1753518185.0,GriefSupport,2,1.0,False

I've seen this question pop up a lot, so here's everything you need to know.

Technically, you can drive around Oahu's perimeter in about 4 hours if you don't make any stops. But trust me, you don't want to do that. There's way too much to see and experience.

I initially planned to self-drive, but after doing some research, I opted for a guided tour instead. Here's why: You miss out on so many hidden gems when you're focused on driving and navigation. Plus, parking at popular spots can be a real headache.

I took this amazing Circle Island Tour with Waimea Waterfall (https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island) and it was honestly the best decision. Our guide knew all these secret spots that aren't on Google Maps, plus shared fascinating stories about Hawaiian culture that I would've never known otherwise.

The tour takes about 8 hours, which is really the perfect amount of time to see everything properly. We stopped at all the major highlights:

- Started early morning at Diamond Head for those postcard-perfect photos
- Checked out the Halona Blowhole (saw some sea turtles!)
- Visited the Nu'uanu Pali Lookout (bring a jacket, it gets windy)
- Sampled some amazing local Kona coffee
- Explored the North Shore and its famous beaches
- Swam at Waimea Waterfall (absolutely magical)
- Ended the day at Dole Plantation

One thing I really appreciated was not having to worry about logistics. The tour includes all entrance fees, and they time everything perfectly to avoid the worst crowds. Our guide even knew the best spots for lunch - had the most amazing garlic shrimp from a food truck on the North Shore.

Quick pro tips from my experience:
- Book in advance, especially during peak season
- Bring a swimsuit for the waterfall
- Don't forget your camera
- Wear comfortable walking shoes
- Bring cash for snacks and souvenirs

The cost was $154 per person, which is actually pretty reasonable when you consider that you're getting transportation, entrance fees, and a knowledgeable guide. Plus, you can cancel up to 24 hours before if your plans change.

If you're planning to explore Oahu, I highly recommend doing a guided circle island tour rather than driving yourself. You'll see more, learn more, and actually get to relax and enjoy the experience instead of stressing about navigation and parking.

I've included the link to the exact tour I took above. They fill up quickly, so if you're interested, I'd suggest booking sooner rather than later. Feel free to ask any questions in the comments!",1,1753518101.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False

1m9o2pb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m9o2pb,Interesting Difference from Brikka: Weak fire vs Strong fire on a stove,"Hi there, recently I noticed that stronger fire makes thinner, and silky oils instead of creamy coffee like first photo.

Second photo is a result from Medium light roasted natural beans with weak fire: It is creamy. 30% of coffee layer is full of coffee creams. It is hard to tell this as a 'crema'. It is more similar to warm frothed milk. It is not silky as crema since it includes bubbles.

Third photo is a result from City-Full City bean with weak fire(I don't sure because a roaster from coffee fair didn't give an information). 40% of a cup was an oil layer. The layer didn't disappear after drinking it(please see last two). Also, with stronger fire, it failed to extract tropical fruit-like aroma, but with much weaker fire I could achieve good coffee.


Also, contrary to major opinion from local maniacs, it requires slightly thinner ground than well known moka pot ground. I needed to grind it like a black pepper powder. 

A length of gas fire was 0.5 inch(it barely hits the pot itself). With stronger fire, it didn't work for light roasted beans.

This is interesting. With enough weak firepower, thinner ground will brew creamy and soft coffee while retaining aroma.

Do you have any similar experience related to a gas stove?
