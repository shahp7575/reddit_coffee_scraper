I'm sad :(," 42F, Early January,  I was approached by a an old acquaintance, 45m. We got to talking and we got along. He was clear in his intentions of wanted to date me.  He had flowers  delivered to my home on my birthday, the next week.  the following Friday we went on our first date. He took me out to a nice local restaurant.  I was a nervous wreck lol it went well, we texted that evening and both agreed there would be a second date.
I think it was a week later we went for a coffee  and a drive, parked at the beach and chit chatted ror a few hours each time, we did this twice.

We went to a local pub the next Saturday, he took me home and asked to kiss me. I said yes, we had our first kiss. That's when I felt it. I was really unsure at first, he seemed very awkward and shy. But that kiss man. That was  it for me. 

We've been seeing each other out a couple of times a week since that kiss,  we both have kids and busy schedule so it wasn't anything major. 

He slept over one week end, and we went all the way. Went for breakfast , cuddled, we shared alot, we opened up. 

He's been calling me twice a day everyday, just to touch base, and we would te text at the end of the day to say goodnight and share our days.

He's texting me and telling me he likes seeing me interact  at the gym,  he likes what he sees, that it shows the kind of person I am. 

Last Friday he texted , I need to cuddle you! I miss you. Damn I did too. So I asked him what he thought about spending the night, my son will be home, as parents , we both know this is a big stepHe is all in. ""Certainly"" he said.

He slept over. Nothing happened,  just cuddles and sleep. He took me out for breakfast , we hung out at home. I cleaned around d while he worked on his laptop
 Went to the gym together , had supper slept over again. It was a really good week end.

Sunday morning he gets called into work, so we cuddle a bit, he's like hey where's my morning kiss! So. We kiss, we hug ok have a good day.
Sunday at 6pm. He comes over and breaks up with me.

WTF. Talk about whiplash.

I was devastated. Blindsided. I felt so ashamed of myself for believing. I felt stupid for not seeing the signs. I hated myself to have introduced him to my son. Embarrassed because I raved about him to my family and best friend.


He said it's too fast. That he wanted out before but didn't act on it. That he doesn't want to be my crutch. That he's not comfortable with my son. That i need too much help. 


Nevermind when we had a talk earlier in the week , I specifically asked how he felt about the way  our relationships was progressing. He was happy about

Nevermind when when he said he was certain he wanted to sleep over when my son was home.

Nevermind when he told me he like who I was and he felt safe and calm with me.

Nevermind when I asked if we were going to fast the week after we slept together. And he's said ""no jeez, I'm always looking forward to spent time with you""

Nevermind all the sweet texts mixed with the mundane stuff, nevermind the flowers and valentines day surprises. 

Nevermind the daily calls, that he initiated every time might i add.

Nevermind the fact that I have a career and i own my house, and I got here on my own.  If I wanted a crutch, I would of gotten one way before. 



I don't need a man to help my poor single mom ass out of my misery thank you very much. I am insulted. Everything I shared and showed him, nothing pointed to me being that person. It doesn't add up.  The only logical answer is that he's projecting . I didn't offer him a crutch,  so he bailed. 
Or someone said something to him about me. 



Everything he shared and showed me was bullshit. 

You wanted out before yet kept saying  and acting and taked like you really liked ""us""?  Fuck that noise

He 100% deceived me. 

How can a man switch like that. A complete 180 , within hours. Dr jekyll and Mr hide. He swears nothing happened that day that made him change his mind. 

Fuck him for sweeping me off my feet, just to drop me on my face with no warning 
He fucking broke up with me at my kitchen table when my son was in the next room.

Fuck him for making me doubt myself, for feeling embarrassed because i thought i had misread the situation so badly. 


This one hit hard. It's been almost a week and I'm still all up in my feels. Our time together lasted about 2 months.
 I don't date often. I don't open up easily, I don't invite just any men into my home. And here I was thinking how  amazing this guy is,  hes intelligent,  mature, sensitive, funny, hard worker, helpful,  considerate. He has convictions and values and has this manly energy about him that I found so sexy. Everything I could ask for in a partner. 

Except honesty.


I  was this close of telling him I was falling in love, and I really believed he was too.  

I'm insulted and angry. 
But you guys  , I'm really sad :(

1j0b4yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/1j0b4yj/the_zombie_apocalypse_rules_to_walking_while/,The Zombie Apocalypse Rules to Walking While Female,"Springtime in the Northern Hemisphere is almost upon us. The days are getting longer, the air is getting warmer, and soon, we‚Äôll all be emerging from our winter hibernation, ready to bask in the sunshine like vitamin D‚Äìdeficient little lizards.

But you know who else is ready to come out of hiding? **Creeps.**

I know this advice is everywhere, but it deserves to be said again. With more people outside, more late-night walks, and the general good vibes of warmer weather, it‚Äôs easy to let your guard down. **Don‚Äôt.** Because just like in every zombie movie, the minute you think you're safe is exactly when something lunges at you from the shadows.

This isn‚Äôt just snark; it‚Äôs survival. Framing it like a zombie outbreak makes it easier to remember, and frankly, it‚Äôs more fun than just listing a bunch of grim statistics. So, whether you're heading out for a hot girl walk or just trying to get home in one piece, keep these rules in mind.

Because in both zombie movies and real life, **it‚Äôs the ones who stay ready that survive.**

# Rule #1: The Buddy System (But Trust No One Too Much)

Zombies and predators share one key trait: they target the vulnerable. If you‚Äôre walking, do it in a group when you can‚Äîbecause let‚Äôs be real, it‚Äôs a lot harder to snatch someone when their bestie is right there, ready to throw hands.

That said, just because someone is *with* you doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre *on* your side. One-on-one situations? Tricky. The scariest part of the apocalypse is when the people you thought were safe turn out to be the real monsters. Pay attention. If your gut says something is off about your ‚Äúfriend,‚Äù listen to it. You‚Äôd rather ghost someone than end up on a true crime podcast.

# Rule #2: Walk in Daylight (Because Nighttime Is Prime Horror Movie Material)

Would you willingly wander through an abandoned house at night in a zombie movie? No? Then don‚Äôt do it in real life.

Daylight is your best friend. Predators‚Äîboth of the undead and human variety‚Äîprefer darkness, shadows, and empty streets. If you have the option, **do your walking when the sun is up** and when other people are around.

If you *must* walk at night, stick to well-lit, busy areas. Avoid side streets, alleys, and anything that looks like the setting of a Netflix documentary. And for the love of survival, **don‚Äôt assume that just because it‚Äôs your neighborhood, it‚Äôs safe.** Zombies don‚Äôt care about zip codes, and neither do creeps.

# Rule #3: Know Your Escape Routes (Because You‚Äôre Not a Final Girl)

If a zombie outbreak started right now, where would you run? If you don‚Äôt know, **fix that.**

Apply the same mindset to your walks. No dark alleys. No isolated trails unless you *really* know them. If a street looks sketchy, it probably *is.* The fastest way between two points is a straight line, but the *safest* way might be an extra block or two through a well-lit, populated area. Choose safety over speed‚Äîalways.

Also, avoid being boxed in. Walking next to a wall, hedge, or parked cars? That‚Äôs a trap waiting to happen. Give yourself space to move, dodge, or, if necessary, **run like hell.**

# Rule #4: Keep Your Hands Free (No One Wants to Die Holding a Pumpkin Spice Latte)

A zombie lunges at you‚Äîwhat‚Äôs your move? If your hands are full of bags, phone, or coffee, **congrats, you just died.** Same applies here.

Put your phone away unless you‚Äôre actively using it to check directions. Hold your keys or personal defense item (pepper spray, self-defense keychain, etc.) in a way that you can actually use it if needed. A weapon buried at the bottom of your purse isn‚Äôt a weapon‚Äîit‚Äôs a misplaced shopping receipt.

# Rule #5: Soundtrack to Survival (Headphones Are a Liability, Not a Flex)

I love a good ‚Äúhot girl walking‚Äù playlist as much as the next person, but let‚Äôs be real: full-volume music turns you into easy prey. The undead and the unhinged both thrive on the element of surprise.

Solution? One earbud in, one out. Or, better yet, keep the volume low so you can hear footsteps, rustling, or that creepy dude matching your pace behind you. If someone is trying to sneak up on you, they *should not succeed.*

# Rule #6: Don‚Äôt Play Dead (Make It Loud, Make It Ugly, Make It Count)

If you get cornered, your only job is **to get out alive.**

Bite, claw, gouge eyes, scream like you just saw a *Spider in the Shower* level of horror. If someone grabs you, don‚Äôt politely struggle‚Äî**cause a goddamn scene.** Kick shins, smash noses, break fingers. People (and zombies) expect an easy meal. **Don‚Äôt be one.**

And for the love of everything, don‚Äôt worry about being ‚Äúrude.‚Äù If someone makes you uncomfortable and you want to leave, leave. If a guy is walking too close and you get a bad vibe, cross the street. If someone asks for directions but something feels off, **keep moving.** Your safety is worth more than their feelings.

# Rule #7: Trust No One (But Yourself)

Hate to break it to you, but in both horror movies and real life, the worst threats are usually **human.**

Yes, most people are fine. No, you don‚Äôt have to assume the worst of everyone. But you *do* have to be smart. If someone is acting weird, assume they *are* weird. If your gut says ‚Äúsomething‚Äôs off,‚Äù believe it. Your instincts have been fine-tuned for survival. Trust them.

At the end of the day, **your safety matters.** You are not overreacting. You are not being dramatic. You are making sure you get home alive.

Because if the world really were full of zombies, you wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to be prepared. So why would you hesitate now?

Stay safe. Stay sharp. And if some guy tells you you‚Äôre ‚Äúparanoid‚Äù? Remind him that *he‚Äôs never had to think about any of this.*",1,1740758701.0,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,0,0.67,False

Over the last few days, I‚Äôve looked at what feels like hundreds of different models. The more I learned, the harder it became to choose one.

I currently own a **Lydsto R1** from 2021. Apparently also Xiaomi built some of those so sometimes they even worked with their app but never tried that with mine. I got the R1 at a great price back then, around 160 ‚Ç¨ with the station (instead of about 400‚Ç¨), and surprisingly, it‚Äôs still running fine. The dust-collection station had an error last year, but I fixed it by blowing compressed air into in to the stations intake vents. Over the many years it also forgot its map two or three times.

The 5200 mAh battery is still enough to vacuum my 52 m¬≤ home with double passes (checkerboard cleaning). The LiDAR mapping is accurate enough, and the carpet detection also works well. The dust-collection station has lost some power over the years, so it occasionally struggles with cat litter if the bag is nearly full. The mopping feature is pretty useless. It‚Äôs just a wet cloth that it drags along. It also doesn‚Äôt do well with my black metal coffee table and can‚Äôt see the T-legs of my new desk, so it sometimes ‚Äúfights‚Äù with them.

That‚Äôs my current setup. I know I won‚Äôt find a comparable upgrade for the same price, so I want my new robot to at least give me a ‚Äúwow‚Äù factor if I‚Äôm going to spend a lot more money.

* I have two carpets, both very tall and fluffy, and one is quite large. Otherwise just laminate flooring and tiles in the bathroom
* I have a cat plus long human hair, both of which love to get stuck on the big carpet. (Or in the brush of the robot)
* Sometimes the kitchen or living room door is closed, so the robot should be able to handle that on its own. If it can‚Äôt enter a room one day but can the next, I don‚Äôt want it to skip cleaning those rooms when they are accessible again.
* Ideally, I want an automatic mopping function with in-station cleaning (hot water cleaning), fresh and dirty water collection in the station, and a largely self-cleaning station if possible. 
* Obstacle avoidance would be great, I don‚Äôt typically leave many things on the floor besides cat toys, my R1 tends to ‚Äúeat‚Äù them as it dosn't has such feature, so I have to put them away whenever it‚Äôs running.

  
My favourite was the **Roborock Qrevo Master** as it has pretty much almost all top notch features but then saw that this model has horrible obstacle avoidance in many reviews and can't lift its side brush but that isn't that big of a deal. Also last year it sold for 799‚Ç¨ and currently the cheapest price is 899‚Ç¨

  
Then I looked at the **NARWAL Freo Z** everyone says it has one of the best Obstacle avoidance and great mopping results with a tangle free main brush but no moveable side brush or a water tank on board the robot. Most reviews hoewer seem to be sponsored and those that aren't don't seem to be that happy with it as it randomly skips areas and uses a lot of water.

  
Mhh well then how about the new **Mova P50 Pro Ultra** it has all the fancy features and it can even place it mops in to the station on its own during cleaning so great for my tall carpet. Online people already complain about faults and reliability issues on this brand new robot. So that one is also out.

  
When I look up Dreame models all of them seem to have bugs in the APP and often worse navigation compared to other ones in their price range and other reliability issues also the x and l 50 are over 1300‚Ç¨

  
So slowly I am running out of options they all ask for a high price but no one of them seems perfect in long term test especially as most either say one is perfect and the next one says the complete opposite.

So I would really appreciate if someone has some longer hands on experience with some of those models or other ones that fit those needs.",1,1740758611.0,RobotVacuums,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

For context, I keep saying I'm updating it to a full prose version, which I am, but I find that I keep stalling out because of the length of the guide, never getting to the end so you don't get even the interim updates. 

**Q1 Would separate little mini-guides confuse people?** Instead of DLing the whole guide, what if you could download ""Chapter 3: The Application"" as the updated 2025 version while perhaps the Reference Check is still the original 2023 version? At the end of the year, I could generate a 2025 version that includes ALL the latest versions up to that point.

**Q2 For format, I'm assuming people prefer a DLable option and for it to be PDF** as opposed to website only. The content is not often a casual read thing for people, more applied use...I assume people want both versions to remain, but I want to confirm that PDF is most people's favourite format rather than needing / wanting AZW3, EPUB or MOBI editions.

**Q3 Lastly, I'm in a weird world anticipating retirement in 2y** where I will have more downloads available on the site (other guides), and I may have to add a DL manager (think a bit like a shopping cart to add your docs to before downloading). While I might charge for some other guides (astronomy, performance measurement), the **Be the Duck guide will still be free**. However, does a download manager / cart create much friction for you before you DL? You won't have to register or anything, it's just to put all DLs in one spot. And yes, as some people have requested, I will give the option to buy me a coffee or something ... lots of people seem to want to pay me and seem almost offended when I say no, that's not an available option (a bit of a head-scratcher that people seem offended it's free???

Hello,



I'm a regular customer of \[name of place\], and I really appreciate \[the quality of the service, the drinks, the general atmosphere...\]



I deplore the fact that the plant based milks are extra on the menu, which penalizes customers wishing to make an ethical and healthy gesture, and encourages greater consumption of animal milk.



Plant based milk emits 2 to 3 times less greenhouse gas emissions than cow's milk, and avoids a great deal of suffering for cows and their calves...



I would like to suggest that you consider a ‚ÄúCSR‚Äù gesture by offering plant milk at the same price as animal milk, as more and more coffee shops are doing. For a minimal difference in margin, the ethical significance and symbolic value of such a gesture would be really appreciable, in a context of climate emergency where every gesture counts.



Thank you again for keeping this very pleasant place alive

Fast, elegant, etc. and so forth. In 2025 for the first time Mercedes is installing high speed DC charging on plug-in hybrids rather than just EVs. So I have the high speed charging port identical to those of the EVs which were just authorized to use the Tesla supercharging network. An adapter is required, which perfectly fits my charging port, because again, it has high speed DC charging. 

When I went to the dealer to buy the adapter they said it was incompatible with MB plug in hybrids. OK... true up until 2025. I didn't want to argue. Instead I installed the Tesla app and tried to enter my Mercedes vehicle and the 2025 E53 was not an option. Odd they would give it a high speed DC port and brag about that when showing it to me and then not include it in this joint venture with Tesla, but fine. So I called Mercedes and they put me on hold and said ""The owners manual does not say that your car supports high speed DC charging."" I said ""The owners manual that supports the entire W214 chassis?"" She affirmed that was the document she was referencing. That document was published in 2024 and Mercedes introduced high speed DC charging for plug-in hybrids in 2025. I suggested that perhaps a 2025 reference or the European literature about the E53 might include an update. She repeated what she said about the owners manual. OK, so I then asked if I could use a CCS charger without an adapter to high speed charge the E53 using the built in CCS charging port. ""No Sir, that may void your warranty"" she said. Just to make sure I had not misheard her, I parroted back ""Using the MB factory installed charging plug, as designed, without adaptation or modification to do what I was told the car could do when I was considering the purchase... will void my warranty?"" She said yes. So while fast DC charging is not critical in a car that has a 52 mile range, I quite enjoy the EV mode and would likely zap it full when I stop for a coffee but apparently that isn't allowed. For the record she was tremendously polite. She did forward my question to MB Engineering but said she was unable to send any answer or response from them.

	‚Ä¢	She was earning around $21K/year as a realtor and hadn‚Äôt sold a house in 4 months.

	‚Ä¢	She didn‚Äôt know how to pay off her credit card and couldn‚Äôt clearly explain how she accumulated so much debt when I asked her

	‚Ä¢	She spent on unnecessary luxuries like $60/month culligen water delivery and two gym memberships while drowning in debt. I also tried to help set up a monthly budget and she refused 3 times as she didn‚Äôt want to show me her banking which makes me think there was more debt she was hiding. I only knew of the 35k and car because she told me. She would also say that she didn‚Äôt have bad spending habits despite the debt. And she would always say she is a self made woman while she lives at home and is actively losing money everyday. 

	‚Ä¢	I helped her get a debt consolidation loan and set up a meeting for her to see a financial planner, but she was defensive and emotional about it and came home crying as he told her she needed to double the amount of houses she sold 

	‚Ä¢	She has a pattern of instability ‚Äî failed her real estate exam 8 times, has 6 speeding tickets, and has been fired from 3 jobs.

Reckless Behavior:

She ran a red light last week to get to me faster.
Once flipped off a cop while we were driving. And she constantly blurs boundaries with other men and engages and seeks out conversations with them and says she is networking for clients. 

She also went out for coffee with an old tinder flame and said they were friends. She didn‚Äôt tell me until a month later. And I voiced this saying I felt uncomfortable about it. And then she asked if she could call him on the phone a few weeks later. 

Despite all this, I cared deeply about her. She started making some changes, but only after a lot of pressure from me. I felt like I was becoming her financial coach instead of her partner.

Did I give up too soon, or was this breakup the right decision? 

TL;DR: Broke up with my girlfriend of 8 months due to financial irresponsibility ($90K in debt, impulsive spending, no stable income) and lack of emotional boundaries with men. She failed her real estate exam 8 times, had 6 speeding tickets, got fired from 3 jobs, and didn‚Äôt know how to pay off her credit card at 30. She also engaged in conversations with other men that blurred boundaries (e.g., went for coffee with an old Tinder match, responded to flirty messages from coworkers/clients). She was sweet, family-oriented, and we had a strong emotional/physical connection, but the long-term concerns felt too big to ignore. Now I‚Äôm struggling with missing her and wondering if I made the right decision. Did I do the right thing?",18,1740757675.0,amiwrong,18,0.95,False

1j0anf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscifistories/comments/1j0anf6/starjump_1_of_3/,Starjump (1 of 3),"The sounds of a female voice buzzed out from tinny speakers on my battery powered FM radio. Her voice had been cycling over and over on repeat through an emergency BBC broadcast.

*'This is an emergency broadcast from the UK government.*   
*There is a nationwide lockdown in effect until further notice.*   
*Please stay indoors for your own safety.*   
*The situation is being investigated and will be addressed is quickly as possible.*   
*Please be patient.'*

The world had gone dark for three long days. 

No communication, no internet, no lights.  

You forget how dark the nights are in London without the amber glow of light pollution. You forget how silent the planet is without the constant background rumbling of tyres over asphalt. So for the first time in a long time, the world really slowed down.

The earth has been hit with a solar flare of significant magnitude, causing widespread damage to power grids and technology infrastructure. At night the skies danced with shimmering bursts of pink and gold, as solar winds bombarded the planet. 

But after three long and chaotic days, things eventually began to come back online. 

Traffic lights lit back up on empty roads without cars to direct, the forgotten hum of refrigerators revved up back in kitchens around the country and digital clocks on devices flashed up '00:00'. 

It was as if the world itself had reset. I guess, in some ways it really had. 

However, the internet was still down, GPS and anything satellite based was completely done in, and cell networks were still essentially unusable. They were too congested with hordes of separated loved ones and friends trying desperately to get back in contact. They weren't expected to be functioning for at least another month. 

Since the networks were all but dead, I certainly jumped when my phone buzzed loudly on my glass coffee table in my apartment. 

It was from a private number.

""Hello?"" I answered.

*""Hello, is this Dr Stephanie Gordon?*"" It was a man's voice.

""Uh, yes. Sorry, who is calling?""

*""This is the Home Office. Are you at your usual place of residence?""*

""The Home Office? Uh yes, I am... I'm sorry what is this about exactly?"" 

*""You will be provided with more details in person. Are you available for collection within the hour?""*

""Collection? There's a national lockdown. How are you even getting through to my phone with the network‚Äôs downs?""

The voice on the other end of the phone dipped to a graver tone. 

""*Dr Gordon, this is a matter of national importance. It is related to your work at University of Cambridge.*""

""My work? How? Why?""

*""Dr Gordon, would you be available for collection within the hour or not?""*

Of course, I said yes. 

Less than 40 minutes later, there was a squeak of cars braking sharply from outside of my apartment. I ran over to the window and peeked out to see three dark tinted range rovers with engines idle in the middle of the empty road. Plain clothes agents stepped out of each car and scanned the surroundings. One looked directly up at my flat and raised a finger to his ear. 

My phone buzzed again, and I answered. 

*""We are outside.""*

For context: Last year i had all my energy in my husband birthday and besides that i was really stressed with work (I supervise buildings) and did everything I could to have free days for his birthday . 
At the same time my friend was organizing her birthday to celebrate it at South America , she will solo travel, and before she wanted to get together to make like a little celebration, but the days she can do it I was not available or was too tired, and I offered her another date for us to get a coffe or something but she was not available. 

At the end I felt bad because even she who basically don‚Äôt work and lives with her parents seems to have less free time than me when I have a full time job and a house to take care of.  And besides that , there were a time i invited her to a Fair I wanted to go, and she cancelled at the time I only had to get the uber , so I didn‚Äôt had time to invite anyone, I felt sad, but brushed it out. 

So now, 3 months after her birthday, and after I congratulated another friend on social media, she comes out of the blue and tells me she is sad , mad an feels betrayed because  i didn‚Äôt tell her happy birthday. ( everything seems normal before she said that , we texted normally).
I told her I thought did it, but seems like I didn‚Äôt, so i told her I understand her feelings and feel sorry, and told her I want to make it up and invited her for a cake and coffee, didn‚Äôt matter the price.
And she didn‚Äôt accepted , she just kept saying how betrayed she felt and how she never thought I will do something like this to her, which ok I understand her feelings were hurt but using such strong words i think is too extra, is not like I went  and slapped her mother or kicked her dog.
 I told her i was not on the best mental state at her birthday week ( I was really tired and didn‚Äôt want to give more explanations) and wanted to make it up to her, but she didn‚Äôt accepted my apologies. 
 I‚Äôm tired mentally and don‚Äôt want to deal with drama , so I didn‚Äôt give her more explanations, she posted on her stories  images implying how our friendship ended etc, and  I just didn‚Äôt said anything. 
I asked some friends and they told me I should let her be and just leave her alone because she was really childish.

1j0ai1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/wirelessearbudsreview/comments/1j0ai1t/should_beats_fit_pro_true_wireless_earbuds_be/,Should Beats Fit Pro true wireless earbuds be your next purchase? Honest review,"Testing the Beats Fit Pro true wireless earbuds was an intriguing experience for me. While I‚Äôve used various earbuds before, these stood out in many ways. Yet, as fantastic as they are, they‚Äôre not without their flaws. Here‚Äôs my detailed take on them.

**Fit & Comfort**

Wearing these earbuds felt like a revelation. The flexible wingtips are a game-changer, providing a snug fit that stayed in place even during intense runs or workouts. I tested these while jogging with my dog, and they didn‚Äôt budge one bit‚Äîa huge win for stability. However, my friend with smaller ears complained about discomfort after an hour, as the wingtips were a bit too rigid for her. This seems to be a mixed bag depending on your ear shape. The multiple ear tip sizes included in the package are a nice touch, but the wingtips could benefit from being more adaptable.

[Grab Beats Fit Pro at the best price on Amazon](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0btkmlzsj/)

**Sound Quality & Performance**

The sound quality is where these earbuds shine. Whether I was listening to bass-heavy hip-hop or soothing classical music, the custom acoustic platform delivered crisp, powerful, and well-balanced audio. The spatial audio feature with dynamic head tracking added a layer of immersion that I hadn‚Äôt experienced with other earbuds. Watching movies felt like being in a mini-theater, and gaming became an entirely new experience. The bass is punchy without overwhelming the mids and highs, making these a great choice for audiophiles.

**Noise Cancellation & Ambient Mode**

Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) on these earbuds is decent but not groundbreaking. During a busy day in a coffee shop, ANC significantly reduced ambient chatter, though it didn‚Äôt eliminate it completely. Transparency mode, on the other hand, worked wonderfully, allowing me to hear surrounding sounds while still enjoying my music. I found this mode especially useful while biking in the city, as I could stay aware of nearby traffic. However, if you're looking for top-tier ANC, other options like the Sony WF-1000XM4 might do a better job.

**Battery Life & Charging**

The battery life holds up to its promise of six hours of listening time on a single charge. Testing this on a road trip, I didn‚Äôt have to reach for the case until the very end of my journey. The pocket-sized charging case adds an additional 18 hours, which is incredibly convenient. The fast-charging feature, Fast Fuel, provided an hour of playback after just five minutes of charging. However, the lack of wireless charging at this price point feels like a missed opportunity.

**Design & Build Quality**

The Volt Yellow color of the Beats Fit Pro is an eye-catcher, and the overall design feels premium. The compact charging case easily fits into pockets, and the build quality screams durability. Yet, the glossy finish tends to attract fingerprints, which can be slightly annoying. Despite this, the earbuds themselves are water-resistant (IPX4), making them suitable for workouts and light rain‚Äîbut don‚Äôt expect them to survive a swim.

**Warranty**

Beats offers a standard warranty, which is a safety net for accidental defects. My colleague had an issue with one earbud not charging, and Beats replaced it promptly within the warranty period. This gives some peace of mind, but I‚Äôd recommend handling the earbuds with care to avoid unnecessary hassle.

**Benefits**

* Custom acoustic platform delivers balanced, immersive sound
* Spatial audio with dynamic head tracking enhances movies and games
* Transparency mode is highly effective for situational awareness
* Secure wingtips ensure stability during physical activities

**Negatives**

* ANC performance is underwhelming compared to premium competitors
* Wingtips might feel uncomfortable for users with smaller ears
* No wireless charging feature despite the price point

**Competing Brands**

When comparing these to the AirPods Pro 2, the Beats Fit Pro holds its ground in sound quality and fit, especially for workouts. However, Apple‚Äôs AirPods Pro 2 deliver better ANC and seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem. On the other hand, the Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds excel in ANC and audio customization, but they lack the sporty design and stability that the Beats Fit Pro offers. If you‚Äôre an Android user, the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro might be a more budget-friendly alternative without sacrificing too much on sound quality.

**Bang for the Buck**

For their price, the Beats Fit Pro delivers strong value, especially if you prioritize sound quality, stability, and a sporty design. While the lack of wireless charging is disappointing, the overall performance justifies the investment. If noise cancellation is a top priority, you might want to explore other options. However, for a blend of quality sound and an active lifestyle, these are hard to beat.

I was falling in love with her and started to feel like she could be the one that I'll marry. I would put so much effort for her, make her a priority in my life after things started to get serious. She used to tell me that I am the greenest flag that she has met, the sweetest guy she has been with and all such cute compliments. 

Suddenly since few weeks back she started saying almost every other day that she had been feeling emotionally overwhelmed and unhappy for reasons which she never really disclosed. I kept trying to cheer her up, got her flowers, ordered her favorite food and desserts for her as we were in different cities. I even arranged to find and get her some favorite regional snacks when I was traveling briefly. And 3 days after we last met, which was around Valentine's day, and that's when I also got her a lot of gifts. She called me saying that she isn't able to invest in this relationship and cannot reciprocate my efforts so it's best to end things.

I tried my best, gave her multiple options around giving her more space and support while she figures out her healing journey, she didn't even budge. I guess she was already checked out. She said that she wanted to be single, work on herself, it's not you it's me etc etc. I cried a lot that day, and I think I never cried so much for any past relationship or breakup that I had. I was genuinely falling in love with this girl and she just blindsided me without any appropriate explanation or communication on what went wrong.

She removed me from her private insta account, but keeps sending me snap everyday at the same time. I ended up breaking no contact after a week to ask her for coffee and she declined it in a very cold way, which hurt me bad really again.

And then I already saw her on dating apps with new pictures within 2 days of breakup, and seeing that she could have already moved on, adds fuel to the fire. I feel like I should just move on, block her and everything but I am not able to shut down the voice in my head which says that maybe she really was going through a tough time and she could be back after she is through her healing journey, and just the idea of killing that hope brings in a lot more pain.

A review to find out!,"Using the Breville Barista Express Impress BES876BSS espresso machine daily has been a caffeinated adventure. As a self-proclaimed coffee enthusiast, I rely on my morning espresso to kickstart my day, and this machine delivers, albeit with a few quirks.

**Design & Build Quality**

The brushed stainless steel finish immediately caught my eye. It‚Äôs modern, sleek, and fits perfectly on my countertop without overwhelming the space. The compact design is surprisingly sturdy, weighing in at 23.7 pounds‚Äîthis machine isn‚Äôt going anywhere. Buttons and dials are well-placed, making navigation smooth. That said, the water tank design could use improvement since it tends to slosh when being refilled. A water level indicator would have been a thoughtful addition.

**Brewing Performance**

I‚Äôve been spoiled by the precision of this machine. It features an impressive intelligent dosing system that auto-adjusts the coffee grind level for consistent results. But let‚Äôs be honest, the system isn‚Äôt foolproof. Occasionally, my beans got stuck in the grinder, requiring a quick manual shake of the hopper. Still, the 25 grind settings allow me to fine-tune my brew, and the assisted tamping system‚Äîoffering a barista-level 10kg of pressure‚Äîmakes puck preparation a breeze.

[Check Breville BES876BSS Barista Express Impress price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0bbynpv33/)

**Coffee Quality**

Once dialed in, the shots it pulls are fantastic. The crema is thick, the flavors balanced, and the bitterness minimal‚Äîprovided you‚Äôre using freshly roasted, high-quality beans. Even my picky coffee-loving friend admitted it tasted better than many coffee shops. Adjusting the PID-controlled Thermocoil heating system ensures the temperature stays consistent, which is crucial for a great-tasting espresso.

**Milk Frothing & Steaming Capability**

The manual steam wand is powerful, producing microfoam with ease. I‚Äôve even started experimenting with latte art (though my attempts often resemble abstract blobs). The wand heats quickly and effectively, but cleaning it can be a chore. I did wish the included milk jug was slightly larger for preparing multiple drinks in one go.

**Features**

This espresso machine is packed with smart features like Auto Dose Correct and customizable shot control. The included tools, such as the Razor precision trimming tool and cleaning tablets, make maintenance manageable. However, the lack of a water low sensor is an oversight that has caught me off guard more than once.

**Energy Efficiency & Noise Levels**

Considering its power, the machine heats up impressively fast while not guzzling electricity. Noise levels, particularly during milk steaming, are a bit high, making it difficult to hold a conversation, but this is fairly standard for espresso machines in this category.

**Water Tank & Capacity**

The 2L water tank is more than enough for my household‚Äôs daily needs. I only refill it every couple of days, even with multiple espressos and lattes. However, accessing the tank can be cumbersome, as you need to tilt it carefully to avoid spills.

**Maintenance & Cleaning**

As someone who values efficiency, I appreciate the auto-cleaning cycles, although it sometimes feels excessive‚Äîfour cleaning cycles in four months seemed a bit much. Descaling is straightforward with citric acid, and the drip tray is easy to remove and clean. I did find the number of cleaning tools provided overwhelming initially, but they‚Äôve proven to be useful.

**Warranty & Support**

Breville offers a solid warranty on this machine, and their customer support is helpful, though not always quick to respond. When the grinder acted up, unplugging and re-plugging the machine solved the issue, but knowing I had support gave me peace of mind.

**Advantages**

* Integrated grinder with 25 grind settings for precise control
* Assisted tamping system ensures consistent shot quality
* PID-controlled heating system stabilizes brewing temperature
* Compact and stylish design fits well in most kitchens

**Limitations**

* Beans occasionally get stuck in the grinder, disrupting dose consistency
* Lack of a water low sensor can lead to running the machine dry
* Cleaning cycles feel overly frequent for regular use

**Competing Products**

When comparing this machine to its peers like the De‚ÄôLonghi La Specialista or the Gaggia Brera, it‚Äôs clear that the Breville Barista Express Impress shines in its combination of automation and manual control. The De‚ÄôLonghi offers a more user-friendly approach with fewer adjustments needed, while the Gaggia is more compact but lacks the advanced dosing and tamping features. For those who enjoy the craft of making espresso but want some assistance, the Breville strikes a perfect balance.

**Value for Money**

Given its features and performance, this machine offers excellent quality for the price. It‚Äôs an investment, but one that pays off for coffee enthusiasts looking to cut down on daily caf√© visits. While cheaper options exist, the level of control and the quality of the brew make the Breville worth considering.

1j0aflk,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1j0aflk/investigate_the_best_reverse_osmosis_water_filter/,Investigate the best reverse osmosis water filter BEATYL Y9S review for pure water needs,"Testing the BEATYL Y9S reverse osmosis water filter system over a few weeks has been an eye-opener. The compact countertop design, paired with an 8-stage filtration process, caught my attention right away. In my household, where clean water is a priority, this unit quickly became a focal point in our kitchen. However, not everything is flawless with this system, so let‚Äôs break it down.

**Ease of Installation & Use**

Setting up the BEATYL Y9S was refreshingly simple! Being a renter, I was thrilled that no permanent installation was required. All it took was plugging it into a socket, placing the removable kettle and water tray, and filling the tank. Once I pressed the sleek water outlet button, I was ready to enjoy pure water. The user interface, featuring an intelligent screen, adds a modern touch, displaying information like Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) levels and filter life. Occasionally, the buttons felt slightly finicky, but I quickly got the hang of it.

[Check BEATYL Y9S price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0d8pqglhm/)

**Filtration Technology & Effectiveness**

The 8-stage filtration system is undoubtedly the highlight. With contaminants reduced and odors eliminated, the water tasted exceptionally clean. I noticed a marked improvement in my coffee and tea flavors. The efficient 4:1 pure-to-drain ratio ensures minimal water wastage, which aligns with my eco-conscious mindset. Bonus points for the option to repurpose wastewater for household tasks like mopping or watering plants. However, while the technology is impressive, the waste pump can be a bit noisy during operation.

**Capacity & Suitability**

The 5.4-liter tank capacity is plenty for a day‚Äôs use in my household. I found it especially handy during family gatherings where water demand peaked. The portable kettle feature was a genius addition‚ÄîI could easily bring filtered water to my living room or office. For RV trips, it fit seamlessly into our space, proving its adaptability. Still, if you have a larger family or consistently high water usage, you might find frequent refilling a minor inconvenience.

**Features**

This system is packed with thoughtful features. The intelligent display isn‚Äôt just for show‚Äîit provides real-time updates on TDS levels, water volume settings, and filter status. The cleaning system and filter reset options simplify maintenance. Additionally, the filtration process noticeably enhances water taste, removing all traces of unpleasant flavors. My plants seem happier with it too. Nevertheless, I wouldn‚Äôt mind an update to the auto-fill buttons, which sometimes overflowed if I didn‚Äôt stop them manually.

**Filter Lifespan & Replacement**

The filters boast a commendable lifespan, lasting several months depending on usage. When it‚Äôs time to replace them, the process is straightforward and doesn‚Äôt require professional assistance. As someone who appreciates low-maintenance solutions, this was a definite plus. I did wonder, though, how easily replacement filters would be available in the long run.

**Warranty**

BEATYL offers a standard warranty for this unit, which I found reassuring. Although I haven‚Äôt had to use it yet, knowing that support is available gives peace of mind. Customer reviews indicate responsive service, which bodes well for any future issues.

**Flow Rate & Performance**

Water production is quick, and waiting for a glass or kettle to fill never felt like a chore. The flow rate is consistent, whether I‚Äôm filling a small cup or the entire portable kettle. However, the sensor occasionally struggled to detect transparent bottles, requiring me to reposition them‚Äîa minor annoyance but worth mentioning.

**Certifications**

The system is backed by certifications that guarantee high filtration standards. While I didn‚Äôt delve into the specifics, it was comforting to know that the product adheres to rigorous safety and quality benchmarks.

**Strong Points**

* 8-stage filtration ensures exceptionally pure water.
* No installation required; ideal for renters or travelers.
* Intelligent display for TDS monitoring and maintenance alerts.
* Portable kettle makes it versatile for multiple settings.

**Areas for Improvement**

* Auto-fill buttons could use better calibration to avoid overflows.
* Wastewater pump can be a bit loud.
* Occasional difficulty with sensor detection for clear bottles.

**Competitive Options**

Comparing the BEATYL Y9S to other countertop filtration systems like the AquaTrue Classic and APEC RO-CTOP, it holds its own in terms of portability and ease of use. The AquaTrue offers similar filtration technology but is less portable due to its bulkier design. On the other hand, the APEC model requires more effort for setup and lacks the intelligent display feature. While the BEATYL Y9S may not have the highest water storage capacity, its sleek design and portability make it a winner for small households or those on the go.

**True Value**

Given its feature set and performance, the BEATYL Y9S is worth the investment. While the initial cost might seem steep, the long-term benefits of pure water and reduced bottled water expenses quickly outweigh it. Additionally, the environmental impact of reducing single-use plastic is significant. If convenience and quality are your priorities, this system justifies its price tag.

1j0ad2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiworkPH/comments/1j0ad2z/my_experience_at_a_toxic_company/,My Experience at a Toxic Company,"Para sa mga taong may time magbasa ng MAHABANG POST. Venting about my horrible experience in a terrible, toxic company starting from Day 1 to my last. From personally being bombarded with emails and texts outside working hours to witnessing poor coworkers being yelled at and ridiculed for having a panic attack. Names and places are purposefully left vague. Do not want to get sued. First time to post in reddit, not sure kung dapat dito nga ba magpo-post.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† First ever job ko ito as a fresh graduate. Pinaghintay kami ng mga ibang interviewees ng matagal, no respect for our time. I should have taken that as the first red flag that this would be a toxic company for me. Yung interview time 1 PM. 4 PM na ata nun, wala pa din kumakausap sa amin. Kumukulo na tiyan ng iba kong kasama. Gusto ko sanang i-offer yung dala kong baon pero nagutom din tlaga ako. Not sure kung norm yung ganon katagal ang waiting time. I overheard the sounds coming from the other room, though. I thought that yung mga employees working there were energetic and upbeat, based on the laughter I heard. Akala ko that meant masaya itong kumpanya. Would soon realize that they were just making chismis and typical office gossip. And other nonsensical chatter. Not to say they weren‚Äôt effective at their jobs. They are. I just felt that they were mean. GABI ko pa nakausap yung magiging boss ko. Kala mo audition ng PBB or like sa commercial. At doon pa lang, nung kinakausap ko siya, with their mannerisms and the severity of their tone, naramdaman ko nang reyna bitchesa makakasalamuha ko. Second red flag.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Got a call back na na-hire na daw ako after a few days. Went back to the office to sign contracts of employment with the HR. Sinabi niya na lagi silang long hours kahit ayon sa law na eight working hours lang talaga. Panay OT. Third red flag. You know, I keep typing red flags, pero it‚Äôs not as if I have much choice to find another job, anyway. My family is struggling. Papunta na sa isang taon na tambay ako sa bahay after graduation. Really needed a job. Thought I could handle it. Thought myself made of sterner stuff. Di pala.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† First day of employment. Iniintroduce ako bawat isa sa iba‚Äôt-ibang team. The MOMENT I stepped onto the threshold of the other department, naramdaman ko yung BIGAT ng paligid. The aura was dark and depressing. In a couple of weeks, I would know them to be good people naman, pero first impression ko sa kanila were half-hearted greetings and tired smiles. Heavy, baggy eyes. Pale. The second day of my employment, I realized why. 12 HOURS silang stuck sa opisinang nagtatrabaho. May isang beses nag overnight pa sila sa office mismo.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† THIRD day pa lang, or basta mga first week ata non, nag-OT na ako. Lumabas na classic bullying ng mga supervisors ko. One of them asked me, ‚Äúokay lang ba na mag-OT ka?‚Äù in a very condescending-sarcastic tone nung tumingin ako sa oras, dahil lagpas 6PM na. 9 AM pasok ko. Nasa opisina ako ng mga 8 AM. Other phrases they casually threw at me were: ¬†‚Äústop asking stupid questions‚Äù, ‚Äúhuwag tangang sagot ah, ayaw ko ng tanga‚Äù. But I was still LEARNING! Yes, I attended university, yes may background ako, but I still have much to learn! Iba ang naaral sa actual work. Minsan talaga hindi ko alam kung paano gawin ang trabaho. And since this one was my supervisor, sa kanya ako magtatanong. Sa kanya ako matututo dapat. Sa kanya ako kakapit. But I felt like I was nuisance; a brat that has to be looked after. Whenever I see people frown, I just immediately shut down and accept being berated at. Then hope that my attacker would feel better. Pero hindi iyon nagustuhan ng supervisor ko. Para sa kanya, I was challenging him with a cold aura. Mas nainis siya kahit na inexplain ko naman na hindi ganon.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Na-absorb ko din negative enrgy ng ibang supervisors ng ibang department. ‚ÄúTanga ka ba o nagtatanga-tangahan?‚Äù Narinig ko kung paano niya din sigawan ang binabantayan niya. Nung narinig naming dalawa ng supervisor ko kung paano pagalitan ng iba ang tauhan nila, they smirked, and said, ‚ÄúDi ba, ang bait ko? Pasalamat ka.‚Äù Or something along that line. They also gave me a warning that our dear old boss was way worse than all of them combined. AND THEY WERE PROUD OF THAT! Tila hindi ata kumpleto ang journey mo sa workplace nila kung hindi ka pinaiyak! WTF!

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The following days, pinipigilan ko talaga istorbohin supervisor ko. Hindi na lang ako umiimik kahit pakiramdam ko na mali-mali ginagawa ko. My supervisor is hyper-critical, which is good for the job, pero lintik talaga inabot ko sa kanya for each and every mistake. It was a constant loop of me being afraid of being shouted at and being shouted at anyway because I was too meek. Hindi daw ako marunong makipag communicate. Hindi ako team player, etc. Naramdaman ko talagang pabigat ako. They kept sighing dramatically. Groaning and ‚Äútsk‚Äù-ing. Sobrang bobo na tingin ko sa sarili ko at this point. Like, fire me already. I cannot stand the way he looks at me. Like a bug crawling on his collar.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† May minsan nagkamali ako ng send sa email. Nung pagkatok sa opisina ng boss ko (different from the supervisor), sa harap ng iba pang partners niya, sinigawan ako. Like, bakit niya kailangan gawin iyon? Siya nagsabi na kapag nagkamali, sabihin siya agad para mai-correct. Mas gusto niya maging honest kami. Ano, kailangan muna ipahiya kami? Sindakin? Ipamukhang tanga? How will we trust them and work efficiently kung ganyan?

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Not sure if second week or second month, pero that main boss stormed inside the office. Sumigaw ng kalakas-lakas sa isang department, ‚ÄúBAKIT ANG BAGAL BLAH-BLAH-BAH-BLAH-BLAH!!!‚Äù Yung talagang nakakanginig-ngipin na bulyaw. After he chastised and humiliated the other department, this boss looked at my coworker, the one who was slower than I was, and shouted, eyes-wide, challenging him, challenging all of us, ‚ÄúWALANG UUWI HANGGA‚ÄôT HINDI ITO NATATAPOS!!!‚Äù I wanted to defend him but couldn‚Äôt. A lot of things also happened that I can‚Äôt specify nor enumerate, but basically, I learned that kami talaga ang pagbibintangan kapag hindi nagusuthan ng client ang project.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Noticed they were acting like the catty, bitchy drag queens in RuPaul‚Äôs Drag Race. Ang sahol ng ugali. They make fun of people‚Äôs appearances. It was like the movie Mean Girls. They feed off of that negative energy. I hated it so much. ¬†One coworker directly asked another: ""We good?"" in a lightheardted kind of way. The other looked at them dead in the eyes and said, ""um... you're not relevant..."" BITCH? SPO ARE YOU! But that wasn't the question! Gusto lang niya i-lighten ang mood.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† There was one time when me and another one of my coworker sjoined another supervisor sa isang venue to meet a client. Very posh ang venue kaya very strict ang entrance; you have to leave everything, especially metal. E yung coworker ko nahirapan tanggalin mga coins niya sa kanyang bag at bulsa. It had many pockets kasi. Ayun, yung supervisor looked back at us, scoffed, and strode forward. Sinadya niyang iwanan kami so that we would probably learn our lesson? Para di namin mahanap ang client? But of course, at this point, they were just bullying us. It felt like they were purposefully being petty, power-tripping bitches. They weren‚Äôt all females by the way. I just like using the word bitch a lot kasi bitchesa naman talaga ugali nila.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This was also during the time when I was bombarded with emails and texts and chats kahit na wala na ako sa opisina, kaya pakiramdam ko nasa trabaho pa din ako. Panay OT na nga, kulang na nga sa tulog, gusto ata 24/7 nakaabang ako sa bawat notifications. Kapag di ako nakapag respond, pinamumukha na kasalanan ko. Kasalanan ko din na hindi ko na-check kapag may binago sa current project at, say, midnight, kapag tulog na ako.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A month rolled by. A month of panay OT and sleep deprivation. The beginnings of my depression and anxiety. Grabe, I though myself fortunate that I was spared from the mental afflictions that gripped some of my friends. I was grateful that I thought myself a functioning, introverted adult. Then boom. Kinakabahan na ako lagi sa trabaho. Konti pa oras ng tulog. I advise nga pala for those who have to travel for two to three hours for work, na sana makagawa kayo ng paraan to move somewhere closer to your job. Related to that, yung isa kong nakatrabaho, hindi na umuwi sa bahay nila ng 2 linggo. He had to contact someone and stay in there house during those two weeks. Hindi na din niya nakita significant other niya for those two weeks. Quit after the second week. Sa less than two years kong employment sa kumpanyang iyon, kada two weeks or 1 month ata may napapalitan. Matira matibay. Matira mga may matinding pangangailangan tulad ko.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† And it‚Äôs not as if the pay is great! ANG BABA NG SAHOD BES. Di talaga worth it. Like below 20K. BELOW 20,000 PESOS tapos ganon kami nguyain, lamunin ng sistema.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† First attempt to quit, may isang tao na sinabi sa akin, ‚ÄúHah! WEAK.‚Äù

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† My coworker that they liked to bully was actually getting good results. Nagustuhan siya ng isang kliyente. ‚ÄúGood job‚Äù ang reward niya from the bosses, pati na rin isang araw na hindi siya sisigawan o aawayin. Pero kapag nagkamali nanaman ng kaunti, ipapahiya nanaman siya at sisigawan. All that effort just to not get shouted at. Proud ang boss na ilang tao na pinaiyak niya.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Sa sobrang sleep deprived ko and stressed, nanaginip akong pinapanood ko daliri ko habang nagta-type sa laptop keyboard. One time, we had to work ON A FREAKING SUNDAY (so 7 days a week) tapos nung pagkauwi ko sa amin, no energy to eat, just dropped deflated on my bed. Bumawi ata katawan ko. Slept for 14 hours straight. From 2 PM to 2:30 AM.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Tila ata expectation ng mga bosses na magpa-alipin ang bawat employee sa kumpanya. The way they talk about us, talk to us: like incompetent slaves. Pinoy naman kaming lahat. They reward you if you abuse yourself for their cause and punish you for having the guts to have personal time. May mga new job hires na nag AWOL na on the first day kasi pati sila nagulat na 9 PM nasa opisina pa rin sila e 9 AM sila nag start. I wish I had the guts to leave, pero di kami privileged HUHU.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Nami-miss ko na makipag-usap sa mabuting tao. Miss ko na nanay ko. Miss ko na furbabies ko. Miss ko na maging tao. Hindi ko na kilala sarili ko. Miss ko nang gumala. Miss ko nang magbasa ng libro. Miss ko na mag games. Miss ko na ang araw, ang dagat, bakit kailangan kong maghirap ng ganito? Miss ko na maging tao. Miss ko na mabuhay. Miss ko nang tumawa at maglaro at manood ng anime. I thought the purpsoe of a job was to help me achieve those. Nakakandado ata ako.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A coworker called one of my coworkers a ‚Äúdumbass‚Äù. Yung paboritong i-bully. Siguro din kasi may pagka weird siya. Pero adorable weird naman. Nevertheless, dapat walang ganon treatment ssa work e. Professionalism where? Itong katrabaho ko puyat din siya lagi. Nung talagang wala na siyang ginawang tama ng isang buong linggo dahil bangag na siya, my supervisor kept asking him ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù in a clearly mocking, condescending tone. Tapos nung nag hand in na siya ng resignation, nagpaparinig na ‚Äúnapagalitan lang magki-quit na?‚Äù sabay tawa. ""Am I the problem?"" sabi pa niya na tumtingin ssa mga ibang toxic allies niya. Siyempre lahat sila nag-no. 

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Realized the HR was not on our side. Yung mga baguhan, nagsusumbong or nagsasabi ng cocnerns nila na hindi naman ata tama na ganon trato sa amin. Si HR ngumiti lang na tila fresh gossip ang narinig. Naging ammunition ata yung sumbong for the bosses. Which is crazy kasi I overheard the boss call HR a ‚Äústupid bitch‚Äù. Ilang beses na nga din niya pinaiyak iyon e. Pero like a good loyal dog, HR went to their master‚Äôs side and kneeled. Dinedefend pa ng HR kilos ng amo niya. Like, tell me you‚Äôre not knowingly abused without telling me you‚Äôre knowingly abused. Tinawanan pa nila yung mga nag quit ng maaga, ‚Äúkung hindi nila kaya, mali sila. Sila may problema.‚Äù Parang ganon ang linya. Survival of the fittest, bitchiest breed. Nagkaroon na ng sigawan between a coworker and a supervisor. Napuno na din siya. Umagang-umaga non, sobrnag wala pang tulog yung katrabaho ko, ang daming pinagawa sa kanya, sobrang inconsiderate. Nasa fight-or-fligth mode na ata siya non tapos biglang sinigawan ng ganon. Pumunta sa HR. Siyempre, siya pa binully ng HR at nung supervisor. Kasi nga kampi ang HR sa mga toxic bosses. Kawawang -kawawa talaga siya.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† After that, this poor coworker of mine na paboritong i-bully nagkakaroon na ata ng panic attack. Sinigawan siya ng boss ko ‚ÄúSNAP OUT OF IT!‚Äù Eyes wide na tingin sa kanya kakaiba. At lahat ng mga masasamang toxic people around me tiningnan si poor coworker na para siyang animal na nakawala sa kulungan. Their hands were on their head, shaking. Sobrang naaawa ako kapag naalala ko iyon. Kawawang-kawawa siya. Gusto kong dukutin yung mata ng katabi ko. Her eyes were saying ‚Äúwhat the fuck is wrong with you?‚Äù to the poor coworker. May isang random day din na their supervisor mocked them nanaman. The supervisor grabbed their head and screamed just like my coworker did when he was having a panic attack. When my coworker left, the toxic people in the room cheered and clapped. No joke. Like pre-school children.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† When I finally had the guts to leave, PINAHIRAPAN nila ako. ‚ÄúHINDI KA MAGKI-QUIT NA WALA KANG MAAYOS NA TURNOVER,‚Äù sabi ng boss. E by this point ang BABA na ng reviews nila sa jobstreet e. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs from all, or most, of the former employees who they abused. Knowing, them, may pagbibintangan sila. Kaya walang masyong nag-aapply. When I left, I made sure na nasa akin lahat ng pruweba if ever pagbintangan pa nila ako.

Other points:

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† They‚Äôre very good naman talaga when it comes to the job. Objectively, very skilled naman mga bosses and supervisors. But when it comes to managing their employees, their ‚Äúleadership‚Äù is lacking and laughable. And they know what they‚Äôre doing. PROUD ata sila na ganon ugali nila.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I also acknowledge that this is a one-sided story. Perhaps nga naman na sila ang tama and baka nagpapaka victim lang ako. Then again, sangkatutak na ang nag quit sa kanila and almost all of them are happier in their new job.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Ang tanging nagustuhan ko lang doon ay yung minsang free coffee and car rides kapag trip ng boss.

Aftermath:

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Natuto akong to stand up for myself in a respectful manner. Employee man ako, pero may karaptan akong defend sarili ko.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† To be sensitive to BS and to defend others who were like myself, too.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Ngayon kapag may sumisigaw na boss or supervisor or manager, I instantly look down on them. Di na ako masyadong natatakot, unless may kasalanan talaga ako. Pero kung alam kong nampa-power trip lang, pinapakita ko na hindi ako takot. It is so unnecessary. It is so extra. Why do they need to shout in the first place? And berate and humiliate us? Hindi naman life-or-death trabaho namin. Wala naman kami sa ER. Hindi kami engineers, or nurses.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Dahil sa trauma ko sa toxic company na iyon, 1 taon ako mahigit hindi nakapag work. Talagang natakot ako sa tao nun. Nag deactivate ako ng social media, hated looking at buildings, relocated back to the province. Buti na lang na may kaya yung kaibigian ko. Sa kanila muna ako nag-stay. Nagbaayd na lang ako ng rent with my savings. Kung hindi ako nagkaroon ng time to heal, hindi siguro ako makakarecoer enough to try again.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Sinira nila passion ko for my skills.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Hindi ako makapaniwala na hinayaan ko lang iyon an mangyari. Maybe because I was young and inexperienced? I doubted myself and thought na sila naman talaga tama. Parang yung mindset ng HR. Parang abuse na nga e: iniisip ko na wala sa kanila ang mali, nasa akin. I cut off contact with almost all my supprt systems.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Dito ko na din nalaman na isa ito sa mga stereotypical toxic companies sa Philippines. No wonder, ang gugurang na din ng mga bosses e. Traditional, hierarchial tyes. Also learned that coworkers in a toxic company are NOT your friends. HR is on their side. Also made me realize to DOCUMENT every email, every order, to protect myself.

Last note:

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Hindi ako naninira ng kumpanya. Naglalabas lang ako ng sama ng loob. Kaya nga vague and anonymous itong post e. And probably to warn or equip others on how to deal with these. Exercising my freedom of speech withoout causing harm.

1j0actg,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1j0actg/hallucinations/,Hallucinations,"Hello, I'm hoping someone can offer advice, as I'm unsure what to do. My mother has started experiencing hallucinations. My parents divorced in 1991. For the past few weeks, she's been insisting my father has been sleeping at her condo, even claiming he's unclothed. The condo is secure, and access is only possible with a key. The last time this occurred, my brother, the only person she trusts, told her it was a dream. However, within a couple of hours, she called me, maintaining it was real.

I take her grocery shopping and to coffee with friends on Sundays. She talks to everyone, which concerns me. I believe she may not be discerning between trustworthy and untrustworthy individuals. I'm worried she'll share these stories, and others might suggest she contact the police or offer advice that could put my father in an uncomfortable position.

I'm considering limiting her outings by having groceries delivered, but I hesitate to do so. I'm at a loss because my brother won't respond with any suggestions. Does anyone have advice?",1,1740756726.0,dementia,3,1.0,False

Female looking for EDC commuter/city backpack

I recently bought a Patagonia Black Hole Mini for a travel bag, but I loved it so much I started using it as by daily commuter bag. It has everything I want but it‚Äôs really too bulky to be bringing on the subway everyday. It‚Äôs in the way when I‚Äôm trying to get by people or when the train is crowded, and it‚Äôs just bigger than I need to go to work

I need it to be able to carry my 16‚Äù MacBook Pro. I love how the Black Hole Mini has separate laptop access but it‚Äôs not a hard requirement. I‚Äôm female and live in a city so ideally it would be sleek/not overtly masculine. (A little sporty would be ok though). Also need a pocket to be able to put my water bottle or travel coffee tumbler (I use a Yeti 16oz Stackable) and need enough room in the backpack for a fleece or light jacket

I don‚Äôt want to have to carry a separate purse on my commute so looking for easy access to things like my wallet/my little pouch of lip balm etc.

No budget, just looking for a great backpack! Thanks",1,1740756667.0,ManyBaggers,4,1.0,False

I was so into him in high school and it seemed like he was really into me too but he never asked me out. I'm sure he could tell I liked him and I could tell he liked me, too. But we didn't run in the same circles or anything, just had class together. We did genuinely get along very well though and I really liked talking to him.

I moved away for college and then 2 years after high school, he messaged me out of the blue and said he would love to go out for coffee together.

He didn't really try to build up to that, he was pretty straightforward which I appreciated but it kind of caught me off guard because it was so out of left field: he'd never asked me out before or even tried to stay in touch really. I told him totally honestly that I'd also love to but it just wasn't feasible with the distance sadly. 

Now I'm not so far away and we still have each other on social media, he doesn't seem to be attached to anyone. I still think about him and always wonder what if. 

Would it be weird to reach out in some way? Does it make sense to think he was just waiting until he felt more confident or something? Would you cringe if a girl reached out to you in the same situation? ",1,1740756454.0,AskMenAdvice,22,0.6,False

In the first months it was making me agitated. I wasn't feeling somewhat fatigued.
However the last 3 weeks i am very tired on it.
I gained weight and I am very lazy. This fatigue and apathy is making me depressed alot.
I don't feel anxious and I am now calmer on it but I can't focus at all or very hard and I feel like a zombie. Is there anything that can be done?
Getting back on 5mg ?
Changing the taking of the med from morning to evening?
Adding coffee? Since I am not a coffee user
Adding L Trysine?
Adding welbutrin?

I own a dual boiler Espresso machine that I switch on and off using an Aqara Smart Plug. I was wondering on its energy consumption when running for 12 hours, meaning both boilers at temperature (93 ¬∞C / 200 ¬∞F for the brewing boiler and 130 ¬∞C / 266 ¬∞F for the steam boiler) and pulling an espresso shot or a cappuccino maybe four or five times a day.

I was actually quite shocked when the plug told me that my machine eats around 1 kWh for initial heatup and then another 1 kWh roughly per hour of idling. I was very close to buying a more modern dual thermal block machine that consumes considerably less energy when I saw a video on the wholelattelove YT-channel measuring the consumption of a very similar machine at MUCH lower values and then bought myself a dedicated energy meter.

This meter told me that the machine only consumed 2 to 2.5 kWh while running for 12 h (including initial heatup and several coffees) and not around 10 kWh as the Aqara plug suggested. Still quite a bit, but I can live with that and see no reason to swap to another machine at this consumption level.

These values are also consistent with other results I saw from other people all over the internet. So in the result one can say:



The Aqara plugs are fine for switching. But never look at their metering data; they are just terrible at that. I assume they do not really make a difference between active power and reactive power, but only measure apparent power. Or they measure to slowly and interpolate peak values over too long a time.



So now I wonder: Is there any smart plug I could implement in Homekit, that would give me accurate metering results?",4,1740755780.0,HomeKit,3,0.83,False

I lived and breathed Astros through thick and thin but I‚Äôve had enough of Jim Crane and Dana Brown running my beloved club into the ground.

The final straws were trading Kyle Tucker and failing to re sign Alex Bregman.  They were able, however, to come up with the money for these deals:

They signed Jose Abreu for $58.5 million for 3 years in 2023.  He hit under .150 and was suspect as a fielder  in 2023 and was outright released early last season after starting out even worse.  An aging Yuli Gurriel was released to make room for the now 38 year old Abreu.

They signed Rafael Montero to a $34.5 million contract for 3 years in 2023.  He‚Äôs a bridge reliever and not even a closer.  He responded with a 5.08 ERA in 2023 and followed up with a 4.70 ERA in 2024 before being placed on waivers.  After not being being picked up he was sent to the minors.

This tops it off:
Lance McCullers was given an $85 million contract extension to last from 2022-2026.  He hasn‚Äôt thrown a pitch since 2022.  He does act a fool in the dugout, however, and did open a coffee/martini bar in Minute Maid Park.

In regard to previous moves regarding management, Crane has a little Jerry Jones in him.
In response to the sign stealing ‚Äúscandal,‚Äù he threw AJ Hinch and Jeff Luhnow under the bus.  Hinch, a hard maybe, but Luhnow you gotta be kidding.  He built the team from zero to win the 2017 Series.

Crane also didn‚Äôt work to resign Dusty and Jim Click one year after winning the 2022 series and after losing to the Rangers in the ALCS the next year.

I apologize for the rant and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll mostly get ‚Äúgood riddance‚Äù and ‚Äúdon‚Äôt let the door hit you in the a**, but I just feel cheated by these (what I feel are) mistakes. 

On a final parting note, the Astros will DEFINITELY regret letting Joey Loperfido go as well!

What to do?,"Over the last few years I've had a diffcult relationship with my mother. I was raised by her in a safe environment and was provided for and was a very obedient kid. As an adult, I came to question things about our family dynamic, her feelings around certain issues, family history, etc. That's where things would get prickly, as my mom would see this as prying or disrespectful behaviour. I also came to realize that she  punishes people in her orbit who don't ""respect"" her wishes with microaggressions such as not offering coffee to a certain family member during a gathering, placing a chipped glass at their table setting when everyone else has a normal glass, or cutting them off and shutting them down when they're speaking at a family dinner. I've nonetheless been insistent on getting to a place where I can speak with her in an authentic, connected way, and the retaliation has only gotten worse. She's gone months without speaking with me after I confronted her about these dynamics. I had a friend tragically end his own life and on a social media post where I shared a picture of a commemorative plaque I made for him, she commented on it saying that I should spend more time with her because life is short (she meant spending time together superficially not questioning things). She sold our childhood home in a hurry without telling me so that I never got a chance to say goodbye to where I grew up, and when I confronted her about it she essentially admitted to it being punitive. All that I can handle, it's petty but we can all be petty sometimes. Here's what really hurts: My mom had a friend and coworker who for all intents and purposes was my aunt since I was born. She helped take care of my brother and I, especially when I turned 5 and my parents divorced. In contrast to my mom, she was always kind, spoke about her feelings, and was always just happy to spend time together. I had been writing to her back and forth, and her last letter was filled with love and also a request that I try and mend things with my family. I wrote her back saying how much I appreciated her perspective and her caring. Then silence. Eventually, I got a message from her sister, telling me that she had passed away from an aggressive cancer. I was devastated. I then made a realization: that there was a good chance that my mom knew about my ""aunt"" becoming sick and passing away, yet didn't tell me. Sure enough, when I messaged her about it, she told me that she knew all along what had happened, and she didn't let me know. If I had known I for sure would have visited her at the hospital, would have offered her care, and would have told her how much I loved her. Instead this important person in my life has vanished over night. My mom shows no remorse over withholding this from me. I have a choice to make: to try and mend things with her, or to let her go. I'm afraid that she's too far gone now that I've seen the depths of her cruelty and that she's too unwell and too old for a meaningful relatiohship to be possible.

After that conversation with all those guys I realised that they don't even tell their parents with whom they're going out.

Any thoughts on the plan or recommendations by area is appreciated! We ended up having an extra day we didn‚Äôt realize that we had, so help on where to place this extra day would be great! We are thinking of either adding the day to the first part of our Garda trip when we go to the Spiazzi area, or to the end of our stay in Limone Sul Garda so we have more time to explore the lake. It‚Äôll make sense once you read the itinerary below I hope. 

Day 1: Land in Rome, rent a car and drive to the Val  d‚ÄôOrcia area to our Agritusirmo stay.

Day 2: Same Val D‚ÄôOrcia Agriturismo, have a slow relaxing day, maybe do some horseback riding or a winery tour, nothing crazy.

Day 3: check out of first place, explore Pienza and go to their market, then drive to Lucca to our next agriturismo to check in.

Day 4: first morning around Lucca. Explore, walk the city walls, get dinner, take it easy.

Day 5: check out of Lucca, explore a bit or grab coffee/breakfast then drive to Spiazzi to check into our hotel.

Day 6: morning visit to the Madonna Della Corona, then explore the area and head to Limone Sul Garda when we are ready. Check into our ‚Äúbig one‚Äù hotel (aka what we have been hoarding our points for for so long LOL). *potential to add additional day here to explore the mountains more and scootch our Limone plans over by a day*

Day 7: second day at our ‚Äúbig one‚Äù hotel. Relaxing spa day, not really leaving the hotel and taking full advantage of it.

Day 8: switch to a cozier stay in Limone to minimize travel movement but also save our wallets bc we don‚Äôt have enough points for 3 days at a fancy hotel but we love the town lol. potential to add additional day here to explore more of the lake*

Day 9: drop off car at hertz in south Garda, take the train to Milan, then check into the hotel at or around the airport before our flight the following day.

Now here‚Äôs the thing:  as type A as I have been about scheduling, I somehow missed that we have an extra day that I didn‚Äôt account for. Should we put the second day around this area once we get to the region from Lucca? Or should we add that extra day at the end of our stay in Limone Sul Garda? Not necessarily to explore the town of Limone more as it‚Äôs smaller, but that would give us more time to take ferries to different places versus having to stay explicitly in those cities (ie Malcesine or the south /east side of the lake).

I have decided to stop watching adult videos way before I actually had a real result.
Some little sparks of consciousness appeared here and there, but when I had the courage to just try, I gave up so quickly. What I didn't know, it's that these attempts where planting seeds in my brain.

Let me tell you a little bit about myself. I had many addictions, soft ones like coffee and cigarettes (so many), but some more important that consists of a wide variety of drugs.

I have fought them all. And then there was the hardest one 

There were still my daily little treats and you know what I mean. I sometimes could go for many a day, watching very vicious stuffs (because the more you feed the monster, the more it eats you.)

I have stopped watching porn, not pleasing myself.

""How are you supposed to still please yourself, if you can't watch adult videos and you don't have a gf/bf or can't have sex with women/men ?""

Well guess what, last year when I first started, I had no girlfriend, and I didn't want to have sex with many women because I slowly realized that, to me, sexual relations are precious and should be shared with a one you love.
(One of the first realisation I had about myself when I really made the step out of porn).

So what's left ? Well, imagination. Think about it, the sexual desire isn't something BAD. I think most of the people here who really have a hard time trying to quit porn think that their desires are wrong and shouldn't be satisfied. 
No ! They aren't wrong and you shouldn't be ashamed by them, you simply need to guide them to a clean fantasy for your mind.

I had no girlfriend but I still had my precious imagination, so in times of need, I simply imagined what my lover could be, and how we could do it. 

And oh fuck, how amazing it is, trust me you have no idea if you didn't try. Porn tend to give you all the images on the screen, but you're watching from behind, you aren't in control of the situation. While it excites you a lot, you feel alone, you feel like a ghost right ?

Using your imagination might be a little less exciting, but trust me it is way more powerful (I'm talking about the blast yup), and you are in control. It will never replace a lover, but it is way more satisfying than a 10 minute porn video with strangers. 

First you'll feel immerged after a little time of awkwardness, but you'll make yourself proud and more heart opened. It is virtuous. Because you simply put your mind and soul toward a real exchange, even if it is not with a partner. 


As the tittle said, I sometimes made mistakes and went back to watch porn, so it might seem discourageous ? Well not really, because when I sometimes lost the fight, it was for one wank or two, just to realize how shitty it was in reality, and how much I enjoyed more my own mental experiences. So after I had my shameful wank in front of a video I was like ""It was shitty as fuck, I'm not proud, I'll just go back to my healthy routine"".

I won't lie to you and tell you that I now have super powers and stuff, but I feel way more proud of myself, more in control of my life, and I finally have a girlfriend haha ! 

Yup quitting porn helped gaining more self esteem, and I think a little bit more with the heart than with my stick. The funny ending of the story is that now when I'm far from my lover, and I have a sexual desire on my own, she's now the player 2 in my head,  do you see now how this technique has been the good choice ? And she's so happy that I fantasize about her instead of watching other women in adult videos. 

Once I opened my eyes, there was, however, something really hard to deal with. Harder than the temptation to watch porn, and it is to hear and see how some people live their sexual lives. You might be more vulnerable to the vicious way of living of some people. ""How can they live like that ? Do that ?""
And I strongly believe that it is simply a consequence of HEALING.

Now that my brain is clean, I just see myself with compassion at 12, watching my first videos of ADULT people doing these vicious things in front of me, a CHILD. 
I didn't realize how much quitting porn would lead me to a spiritual challenge. 

I realize how much this society is perverted simply because porn is omnipresent yet so quite, and how it affects people everywhere. How it plays with insecurities and traumas. And how normalized it is.

I could tell you more about this but I think that this post is long enough.

To synthesize, just connect more to your imagination guys. Quitting porn isn't the end of sexual pleasure, even for the people alone.
You have enough memory to remember how is a boobie, because you have documented yourself enough right ? Haha

Good luck everyone, may the virtue win in this cold world.",1,1740755130.0,NoFap,0,1.0,False

Date: 02/28/25

Time: 3:00 PM ‚Äì 11:00 PM

Weather: Slightly less miserable than yesterday

Summary of the Night:

A thrilling, action-packed evening‚Ä¶ if you consider staring at the lobby TV for entertainment. The hotel was so quiet you could hear the ice melt from where the hockey team used to be.

Guest Interactions:

Room 214 called to ask for a wake-up call at 6 AM. I assured them our automated system would handle it‚Ä¶ unless it decides to sleep in.

Room 317 reported a strange noise in their room. Turns out, it was just the sound of their own regrets after eating gas station sushi.

One guest walked past the front desk just to say, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quiet tonight.‚Äù Yes, thank you. We hadn't noticed.

Employee Updates:

The front desk agent attempted to set a record for stacking coffee stirrers. A noble effort, tragically ended by gravity.

Housekeeping reported that laundry was ‚Äúfinally under control.‚Äù Ten minutes later, they found an entire bag of forgotten hockey jerseys.

Hockey Team Departure Update:

The hockey team finally checked out, leaving behind:
3 broken room keys
2 suspiciously sticky TV remotes
1 lonely hockey puck in the hallway

Their bus driver looked like he had just aged 10 years overnight. We wished him well.

Maintenance Requests:

The lobby thermostat was adjusted 37 times to satisfy no one.

The elevator let out a groan, possibly mourning the loss of the hockey team.

A mysterious smell lingered in the hallway. No one was brave enough to investigate.

Other Noteworthy Moments:

A tumbleweed may or may not have rolled through the lobby.
Someone checked in. The front desk agent nearly forgot what to do.

The most exciting event: A vending machine ate a guest‚Äôs dollar. We held a moment of silence.

The highlight of the night: A single car alarm went off in the parking lot. It lasted 20 seconds and was the most thrilling moment of the shift

Final Notes:

The hotel is still standing.
The Wi-Fi still refuses to cooperate.
The hockey team is gone, but their legacy (and the faint smell of sweat) lives on.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

In the heart of the Hague, where tradition meets innovation, we found ourselves at¬†Cafe Restaurant PAN, a unique spot that embodies the spirit of modern financial evolution. It was a crisp day, and as we settled onto the terrace, the excitement of what was about to unfold filled the air. Today was not just about enjoying good food and great company‚Äîit was about demonstrating the power of¬†HBD¬†in the real world.

As we browsed the menu, our eyes lit up. The first order of business? A fresh cup of coffee. Within seconds, our drinks arrived, setting the stage for an afternoon of indulgence. Next, we moved on to something close to our hearts‚Äîsoup. Being Cold Beetroot Soup, it only felt right to sample the Coco‚Äôs Curry soup. The aroma was divine, promising an explosion of flavors.

For the final dish, something truly intriguing caught our attention: Melted Mushrooms. This delicacy consisted of feta cheese, mushrooms, and arugula on freshly baked bread. A perfect combination of rich, earthy flavors and creamy textures‚Äîirresistible.

Inspired by this experience, we spoke with the caf√© owner about the potential of expanding crypto payments beyond¬†Bitcoin. Our vision? A future where Hive-powered transactions become the norm, allowing the community to spend its earned rewards effortlessly. We even discussed the idea of hosting our¬†podcast¬†at Cafe Restaurant PAN, possibly bringing the owner on board to dive deeper into the possibilities of Web3¬†adoption",0,1740754738.0,Bitcoin,8,0.5,False

Every year I take a birthday trip somewhere I‚Äôve never been before. Last year was Seattle and this year is Nashville. 

A lot of things I like to do is visit great local restaurants and bars in the area but also would like to find some nice tourist attractions.

Things that I HAVE to do is visit a local brewery and grab a souvenir glass from there and a local coffee shop and grab a mug. 

Quick things about my trip:

- I‚Äôm a 31M.
- I‚Äôll be visiting April 24-27. I‚Äôll be coming from Houston
- After the 27 I‚Äôll be headed to Pigeon Forge and do some hiking.
- I‚Äôm torn between staying in Music Row or Downtown Nashville. 



Questions:
- Do I need a rental car or is Nashville walkable? 

- Do you recommend Music Row or Downtown living? 

- What are some must-sees in terms or tourist attractions? I‚Äôm already looking at heading to the Johnny Cash museum and I also plan on looking at any events happening that weekend.

- What are some places I should avoid? 

- what bars do you recommend I visit? I typically prefer a bar that‚Äôs dark, almost dive bar-esque, but still has a fun vibe to it. 

- What about restaurants?

Anything else you may recommend? I‚Äôm open to anything and everything. I just learned that researching can be a bit daunting when it comes to google searches but reading Reddit comments is easier and more informational. 

I will also accept snarky responses of how this is the xth post  about this and I could‚Äôve just utilized the search bar.

The room felt too quiet. Not peaceful‚Äîjust hollow, as if even the air had given up. Dim golden light from the lamp cast long shadows across the walls, stretching over the clutter of untouched dishes and discarded blankets. The scent of cold tea lingered on the coffee table, next to a half-eaten meal she had abandoned two days ago.

Valyria sat curled into the couch, her limbs drawn in tight, her body heavy with exhaustion that pressed against her ribs like a weight too dense to lift. Her skin felt cold, but her blood burned beneath it, an unrelenting exhaustion that wavered between sleepless nights and days lost to fitful sleep. She hadn‚Äôt eaten much‚Äînot because she was trying to waste away, but because the thought of chewing, of tasting, of existing in her body felt like too much effort.

Ronan was beside her, solid and warm, an anchor in a sea of weightless nothingness. His presence was tangible, an unspoken promise in the way his arm draped around her shoulders, his fingers tracing lazy circles on the bare skin of her arm. He smelled like cedarwood and leather, something rugged and grounding, a contrast to the fragile shell she felt like she was becoming.

‚ÄúYou should eat something, Val,‚Äù he murmured, his voice thick with concern. It wasn‚Äôt an order, but it wasn‚Äôt just a suggestion either.

She exhaled through her nose, tilting her head slightly toward him but not meeting his gaze. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not hungry.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt been hungry in days.‚Äù His fingers paused for a beat, then resumed their slow, steady movement. ‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù

The word curled around her like an embrace, rough but pleading. He was trying‚Äîhad been trying‚Äîbut she could feel his helplessness bleeding into his touch.

She didn‚Äôt want to keep disappointing him, but even the idea of food made her stomach curl. ‚ÄúI just want to sleep,‚Äù she whispered, voice brittle.

Ronan shifted, pulling her closer, his chin resting lightly against her hair. His breath was warm against her temple, a steady rhythm, his heartbeat strong where their bodies touched. ‚ÄúThen sleep,‚Äù he said simply. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right here.‚Äù

But sleep wouldn‚Äôt help. Not when her thoughts raced even in unconsciousness. Not when she kept waking up feeling just as hollow as before.

And she didn‚Äôt want just Ronan. She needed Caius too.

Her phone sat on the coffee table, face-down, silent. Unanswered messages lingered beneath the screen, a reminder of the distance she couldn‚Äôt close. Caius hadn‚Äôt checked in today. Maybe he was busy. Maybe he just assumed she‚Äôd reach out if she needed him.

Or maybe he didn‚Äôt think about her the way she thought about him.

The weight in her chest pressed heavier. She missed him‚Äînot just his presence, but the way he made space for her in his quiet, unspoken way. He wasn‚Äôt soft, wasn‚Äôt the type to fuss or coddle, but when he was there, she didn‚Äôt have to pretend she was okay. She could just exist, and somehow that was enough.

But even if he were here, he wouldn‚Äôt be here. He‚Äôd be in his own space, separate. He and Ronan tolerated each other for her sake, but the distance between them was more than just physical. Caius didn‚Äôt want anything to do with Ronan, and Ronan‚Ä¶ Ronan had never said it outright, but she could feel the tension coil in his muscles whenever Caius came up.

Now, she felt that tension again. The way Ronan‚Äôs fingers momentarily stilled against her arm, the way his chest rose in a slow, measured breath. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre thinking about him.‚Äù

She sighed. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

Ronan‚Äôs jaw flexed. He didn‚Äôt pull away, didn‚Äôt let his frustration spill over, but she felt it in the way his grip tightened ever so slightly around her. Not angry. Not jealous. Just‚Ä¶ frustrated. Maybe even hurt.

‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶‚Äù He exhaled, his voice raw with something close to defeat. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to help you more than I already am, Val. I feel like I should be able to do more, but‚Äî‚Äù He stopped, shaking his head slightly.

Her heart clenched. She hated this. Hated that she was making him feel like he wasn‚Äôt enough when that wasn‚Äôt it at all.

She turned slightly, pressing her face against his shoulder, her fingers curling into the fabric of his shirt. He was so warm, his scent wrapping around her, grounding her even as she felt like she was slipping away. ‚ÄúYou are helping,‚Äù she murmured, voice barely above a whisper. ‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ I need both of you. I wish you didn‚Äôt have to be the only one here.‚Äù

Ronan didn‚Äôt answer right away.

She could feel his heartbeat against her cheek, strong and steady, a contrast to the fragile, wavering pulse inside her own chest. He hated Caius. Not in an explosive way, but in the way that came from watching her ache for someone who never seemed to reach back far enough. Someone who should have been here but wasn‚Äôt.

But instead of saying any of that, instead of letting his frustration turn into something sharp, he just held her.

One hand stroked slowly down her back, firm and reassuring. His other arm stayed wrapped around her, his fingers brushing the nape of her neck. He kissed the top of her head, lingering, his lips warm against her skin. His voice was softer this time, edged with something almost reverent.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be here as long as you need me.‚Äù

I went to university in Montreal (Concordia) and had some of the best years of my life there. I love and miss the city so much, its vibe, the summers, the coffee shops, just everything. I‚Äôm in Toronto now, but I want to get a small tattoo as a tribute, something like a postage stamp with a simple but meaningful design.

I‚Äôm trying to figure out what best represents Montreal in a small tattoo. Some things I love:
The Plateau, its artsy, laid-back vibe, cute streets, and caf√©s
Mile End, bagels, indie bookstores, that effortlessly cool energy
The chill summer feel, picnics, biking, terraces, festivals

I thought about the Ferris wheel at the Old Port, but I don‚Äôt feel super connected to it. I‚Äôd love something simple but iconic, maybe a street sign, an object, or a small symbol that instantly feels like Montreal.

Any ideas? Would love to hear your suggestions!

I‚Äôve recently released an activity-based friendship app called Loop.

I wanted to share it here in case any of you are looking to meet local people that share similar interests like grabbing a coffee, going for a walk, or maybe trying a new sport. It's also perfect for those at uni that want to find a study partner (and a new friend to grab a drink with after!) üôá

I know how daunting it can be moving to a new uni or city and trying to make friends - especially when you don‚Äôt know many people yet. It can feel overwhelming figuring out how to meet people outside of lectures or work.

That's why I made Loop. It's designed to be spontaneous and easy to use. All you need to do is post the activity you want to do, and people nearby will be notified and can request to join within 3 hours.

Loop is completely **free** to download on iOS and Android, and we‚Äôre rolling it out across the UK (mainly focusing on the south right now but lots of uni students are hopping on!)

Yesterday morning I got out of bed to make a coffee in my pyjamas, which is fairly regular lounge wear, and obviously no bra (because who tf sleeps in one!?). So my sister pulls me aside and has the audacity to tell me to put on a bra because my nips were poking and that it‚Äôs inappropriate in front of her bf, who I guessing might have been caught staring.
We had a slight back and forth and I basically told her it‚Äôs my house and I can wear whatever I want, it‚Äôs her insecurity if she cares how I‚Äôm dressed in front of her bf.

Moving forward to this morning, I got the cheeky idea to go a step further and show off a bit more. So this time I headed out my room in a white tank top with the nips slightly visible and nothing else aside from a simple black thong. 

I head to the kitchen to get my coffee and this time they‚Äôre still in the spare room. Her bf eventually comes out to get some water and immediately freezes upon seeing me.
I started some small talk with him and the poor boy was so dumbstruck he could barely speak properly and I deffo wasn‚Äôt getting much eye contact. I give him his glass of water, turning around to grab it from the cupboard. I could feel his eyes glaring my bum cheeks eating up the thong. I handed the glass to him, still barely any eye contact, and I noticed he had a semi and I could make out the outline. 

Nothing more happened, he headed back and I have no idea if he‚Äôs told my sis that or not, but I frankly don‚Äôt care and enjoyed it unexpectedly as well. ",0,1740753862.0,AmItheAsshole,43,0.32,False

The touch screen can be a little non responsive - you have to touch it a few times no matter how clean the machine is to get a setting set.
 
1. Order a 2nd Carafe as a backup - The design is cool - I was cleaning mine wrong until I broke it by pulling the rubber hose out to get rid of the build up of milk inside it. Only after attempting to repair the hose did I discover the proper way to take it apart to clean it. This still might happen but I should have watched the youtube video of how you clean that carafe.

1. Another thing to note is not to over load the bean hopper - I did this a well and jammed up the grinder and had to take the machine apart to clean the grinder and ended up with beans all over my apartment by using a shop vac in blow mode and still find beans today that hide from me. Once I cleaned the machine it worked great again.

1. If you have presets and use your custom preset as the default going back to the home page is not that clear at first, you have to hit the home button on the custom page not the home button the outside machine, so you will be hitting the button over and over again and it will do nothing but smile at your and say fuck you, press it where  we want you to press it.
 
1. You end up using a lot more water then you expect with it cleaning itself before and after - I only use pure clean 100% bottled water with no fluoride to replenish the machines bodily fluids with no filter and I end up putting in 32 Ounces of clean pure water a day into the machine for my 2 drinks and 2 cleaning cycles when it powers up and closes down.
 
1. It is well worth the money that you save going to Starbucks - you get a better product - it is faster then going to a place two times a day - your cost per at the highest level of milk and coffee is about 1 dollar for me that is 12 dollar a day savings 7 days a week with out the cost and time of travel.

The cost vs what we could do elsewhere for much less money had me always shaking my head saying no way in hell. Last summer I caved, decided with the rising cost of Disney and everything else if we were going to do it now would be the time. 
  Spent about two months researching different on site and off site resorts, time of year to go and such. Finally decided on 1/27-2/03. Pulled kids (7 and 9) out of school for a week. Stayed in family suite at all star music. 5 park days, 1 rest day plus arrival and departure days. Put my $200 down and took every bit of extra money from our paychecks and put it to the trip. Had it paid by November. 
  Surprised the kids and made it a Xmas present, printed fake tickets and bought magic bands for all of us. Kids were over the moon considering my stance on it over the years. Wife was thrilled.
   Planned the whole vacation myself, my wife was overwhelmed and left it all up to me. Spent countless hours here on Reddit, watching YouTube videos on tips and tricks, even fps videos on walking the parks to get a layout in my head to get around. 
   One month after coming back not a day has gone by where I haven‚Äôt thought about the trip. Spent about $9,000 total for everything, didn‚Äôt go all out but splurged on a lot of things with the thought this was once in a lifetime for us and wanted to have the best time. 
   Here‚Äôs some of my thoughts on things‚Ä¶


     -ARRIVAL: Took earliest flight in, arrived at 9:30am on a Monday. Booked with Away we go Travel, cost about $240 to have a vehicle waiting for us at airport. They stopped for me to pick up groceries i had preordered, then dropped me off at resort and picked me up at end of trip and brought me back. Worth every penny to not have to wait for bus, spend potential hours waiting for bus and getting to resort. Would do again in a heartbeat. Purposely got in early to maximize first day. Drivers were great and cost wasn‚Äôt that much more than paying for a bus for all of us, plus couldn‚Äôt guarantee Lyft of Uber would have booster seats we needed.

-HOTEL: Spent $303 a night a I think for family suite at All Star Music. Was nice having a room for my wife and I. Kids loved having the two queen sized beds. Two bathrooms was clutch getting out in mornings. Room was nice, little beat up in some spots. Some of the outlets were a little weird and didn‚Äôt work. Room was not ready when I arrived as I expected, we were early. Checked our luggage in front and spend time walking resort, playing some arcades, grabbing lunch. Room was ready by 12:30 early which was nice. We arrived and our stuff wasn‚Äôt there, plus I noticed the plates, silverware and such we barely had any of which took me by surprise. Went to front desk and they took care of all of that immediately which was great. Extra blankets, plates and utensils were brought right away with our stuff. Grabbed some dinner in cafeteria, swam, did some smores by fire which kids loved. Overall loved resort, lots for kids to do. Not many complaints at all. There were some large loud groups of dance girls in resort, but we were so tired at night we passed out easily anyways. 

-Quick Service meal plan: overall pretty happy with it. Don‚Äôt really care about sit down meals and knew it would take up more of our park time, kids would be more restless. Plus sit down meal plan much more expensive. I‚Äôm a chef for a living so I don‚Äôt get overall impressed from sit down meals anyway, and I‚Äôm a simple guy that enjoys chicken tenders and burgers as much as any upscale food anyway. Totally took advantage of plan, ordering alcohol whenever we were able to. Realized quick a venti sized coffee as Starbucks counted as a snack the same way an apple would. Brought snacks to parks from our room and used our snack credits for coffee and ice cream and such. Down side was kids meals, kids ate a lot of chicken tenders and hamburgers. Not a ton of variety for them. And aside from maybe some carrots barely any veggies to be found on menus. That was disappointing. I didn‚Äôt research on where to eat in parks so for the most parks we had some good meals wherever we went. Not sure if I would do meal plan again, but I‚Äôm pretty sure we got our moneys worth, and it was nice to have it prepaid. 

-Memory Maker: Probably the most value for our money on the whole trip. We stopped at every damn memory maker spot everywhere lol. Wife insisted. For $180 got countless pro photos done everywhere imaginable. Incredible deal in my opinion if you go out of your way to use it. Loved the instant download from rides. 

-Park Hopper: After much agonizing decided not to buy it at $380. Good choice for us. Would have never used it. Even in animal kingdom which people call a ‚Äú half day park‚Äù we didn‚Äôt see everything. Got in early and still ended the day not making our way to Asia. Kids did the wilderness badge thing and we stopped at every location we came across. Kids loved learning different things from each booth and had their books out the whole time crossing off animals and bugs they came across. We spent tons of time finding all different exotic birds in one area. Took our time to soak everything in had an awesome day. AK was our first park day on Tuesday. So for first timers we didn‚Äôt get to everything in and park in one day. I could see value in park hopper on another visit but first time with kids not for us. 

-TRANSPORTATION: Used bus system. Awesome. Busses run constantly. Barely had any waiting time all week for busses. No complaints. 

-LIGHTNING LANES and SINGLE PASS: Bought them for every day. Purchased all singles lanes except for Tron. Spent like $750 total. Worth it. Went on 7 days before and grabbed every attraction we wanted with no issue. Saved countless hours not waiting in lines, which was a godsend considering how insane my kids are when they are impatient. We got so much done. Did have to rearrange some things when I realized I scheduled us in different areas of parks too close together. With some research system is easy enough to navigate. Would do again. 

-Crowds: Busy but not terrible. Hollywood studios seemed to be the most crowded, but mostly because of a lot of show type attractions letting tons of people out at once in small areas. 

-Rides, shows Highlights:  Too much to list. Rise of the Resistance was the coolest thing I‚Äôve ever ridden. Guardians was an amazing experience. Haunted mansion and pirates so much fun. I‚Äôve never done anything more than a local amusement park where im from. Disney blew me away and exceeded every expectation I had. Never experienced rides like this in my life. We got lucky though, there were a lot of rides breaking down while we were there and we managed somehow to get lucky enough to ride them early before breakdown. We rope dropped Tron and it was down. Cast members warned people lining up they didn‚Äôt know when it would be working. Decided to give it 20 min and sure enough they opened it a few minutes later and we waited less than a half hour and got to ride it. 9 year old son threw up after he got off and still loved it lol.

Weather: mid 70s and sunny all week. Didn‚Äôt have a drop of rain. Light jacket in early morning and late night. Perfect, we got so lucky. 

I‚Äôm going to stop here. Already too long and could go on forever. Best vacation and experiences ever. Cannot afford to go every year but want to go back again someday. I‚Äôm not well traveled so I can‚Äôt compare but we had the time of our lives.

Review,"Testing out the SOWTECH JH-C5119 espresso machine has been nothing short of an adventure in coffee making. As someone who enjoys a good latte or cappuccino daily, I was curious about how this sleek device would fit into my routine. Let me share my experience with its features, performance, and quirks.

**Coffee Quality**

I wasn‚Äôt expecting this espresso machine to rival my favorite local caf√©, but I was pleasantly surprised. The 20-bar pressure pump creates an espresso shot with a rich crema that feels almost professional. Each cup is full-bodied, with deep flavors that truly highlight the coffee beans. I tested it with various coffee grounds, from budget-friendly blends to premium ones, and the results were consistently impressive. My friends and family couldn‚Äôt believe this came from a home machine.

**Design & Build Quality**

The compact and modern design is a game changer for small kitchens like mine. It‚Äôs slim enough to fit on the counter without overwhelming the space, and the stainless steel finish gives it a premium look. The buttons are tactile and intuitive, which means you don‚Äôt need to be a barista to operate it. I especially appreciated the visual indicator lights that signal when the machine is heating up or ready to use. One minor issue is the slight vibration during operation, which might cause lighter cups to shift.

[Check SOWTECH JH-C5119 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0ddpth478/)

**Milk Frothing & Steaming Capability**

The milk frother is where things get exciting. It‚Äôs perfect for creating silky, soft foam for lattes, cappuccinos, or even trying your hand at latte art. I found it to be quick and efficient, heating and frothing milk in no time. While the steam wand does its job well, I recommend practicing for a few days to master the technique. Beginners might find it slightly tricky initially, but it‚Äôs worth the effort for the quality foam it produces.

**Water Tank & Capacity**

The 42-ounce removable water tank is a blessing for anyone who drinks multiple cups of coffee throughout the day. It‚Äôs large enough to handle several brewing sessions without constant refilling. The transparent design lets you keep track of the water level easily. Removing and cleaning the tank is a breeze, and it fits snugly back into place without any fuss.

**Maintenance & Cleaning**

Cleaning this espresso machine is straightforward, which is a huge plus for someone like me who prefers minimal effort post-coffee. The removable drip tray and water tank make it easy to rinse and wipe down. However, I noticed that the coffee grounds often hold some liquid, which can lead to a slight mess when discarding them. A small cleaning brush would‚Äôve been a handy addition, but I made do with one I already had.

**Brewing Performance**

The instant heating technology is a standout feature. Unlike traditional machines that require a cooldown period between steaming and brewing, this one transitions seamlessly. It takes about 30 seconds to brew a single or double espresso, which is perfect for busy mornings. The machine even alerted me with a beep when the brewing process was complete, which I found to be a thoughtful touch.

**Energy Efficiency & Noise Levels**

Compared to other machines I‚Äôve used, this one runs relatively quietly. The slight hum during brewing is noticeable but not disruptive, especially for early mornings when the household is still asleep. The auto shut-off feature ensures that it doesn‚Äôt waste energy, which adds to its appeal for environmentally conscious users like me.

**Advantages**

* Compact, stylish design fits any kitchen space.
* 20-bar pump delivers professional-level espresso shots.
* User-friendly buttons and intuitive operation.
* Quick heating system saves time during busy mornings.
* Efficient milk frother for caf√©-style beverages.

**Disadvantages**

* Vibrates slightly during operation, causing lighter cups to move.
* Coffee grounds retain liquid, requiring careful disposal.
* Lacks a dedicated cleaning brush for convenience.

**Competitive Options**

I‚Äôve had the chance to compare this espresso machine with a few others on the market. For example, the De‚ÄôLonghi Dedica is another compact option but comes with a higher price tag and slightly more complex controls. On the other hand, Nespresso machines are convenient for pod lovers but lack the flexibility of using your own coffee grounds. What sets the SOWTECH JH-C5119 apart is its balance of affordability, quality, and versatility, making it a strong contender for anyone looking to create coffee-shop-quality drinks at home.

**Value for Money**

This espresso machine strikes the perfect balance between affordability and performance. While it isn‚Äôt the cheapest option out there, the features and quality it offers make it a worthy investment.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

create  comedy standup piece in the style of bill burr



GPT-4o:

Here's a comedy stand-up piece in the style of Bill Burr‚Äîblunt, observational, and full of that signature rant energy.

# Why Everything is Stupid

**(Walks on stage, nods at the crowd, takes a sip of water, leans on mic stand.)**

Man, I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on anymore. I feel like every day, I wake up, and the world is just a little dumber than when I went to bed. Like, I go to sleep, normal planet, wake up‚Äîboom!‚Äîeveryone‚Äôs lost their minds.

I was in a coffee shop the other day‚Äîguy in front of me orders a latte with oat milk, which is fine, whatever. But then he goes, **""Could you steam the oat milk at 130 degrees? I don't want to kill the probiotics.""**

What are we doing, people?!

When did ordering a coffee turn into a chemistry experiment? Just get the latte, shut up, and go! Nobody cares about your probiotics, Chad! Meanwhile, I order a black coffee, and they look at me like I‚Äôm a psychopath. **""That‚Äôs it? No almond foam? No lavender syrup? No coconut dust?""** No! Just coffee! I didn‚Äôt come here to be an artisanal scientist‚ÄîI came here because I hate myself, and I need caffeine to function.

And speaking of stupid people‚Äîhave you noticed how nobody knows how to merge onto the highway anymore? This is basic human behavior! You see the lane is ending‚Ä¶ **you speed up!** That‚Äôs the rule! But every time, there‚Äôs that one guy who just coasts in, doing 20 miles an hour, looking around like he just woke up in a parallel universe. **""Ohhh, do I go? Do I wait? Do I just sit here and die?""** MOVE, YOU IDIOT!

**(Paces stage, takes a deep breath.)**

It‚Äôs like we‚Äôve just decided as a species to give up on efficiency. Everything takes longer now! I went to the grocery store last week to buy ONE thing‚ÄîONE thing‚Äîand I ended up standing in line for 15 minutes because some guy decided NOW was the perfect time to play detective with his receipt.

**""Uh, excuse me, I think this was supposed to be 2.99, but it rang up as 3.12?""**

Oh my god! **Who cares?!** Just pay the extra 13 cents, Dave! It‚Äôs not 1947! You‚Äôre not stretching your rations for the war effort! Meanwhile, I‚Äôm standing behind this guy, holding my one bag of chips, aging at a rapid pace. My hair is turning gray, my posture‚Äôs collapsing‚ÄîI‚Äôm practically decomposing in real time.

And have you noticed how every commercial is just an emotional guilt trip now? Used to be, a commercial just showed you the product‚Äî""Here‚Äôs the car, it goes fast, you should buy it."" Done! Now? Oh no, now every ad is a goddamn **mini-documentary** about some guy overcoming childhood trauma to buy a Toyota.

They always start the same way‚Äî**sad piano music, slow-motion close-up of a guy looking out a rainy window.**

**(In dramatic narrator voice)**: ""Jason never knew his father. He struggled with self-doubt‚Ä¶ until he found the all-new Nissan Sentra.""

What?! What does that have to do with anything?! Just show me the car! **I don‚Äôt need a character arc!**

**(Shakes head, takes another sip of water.)**

I don‚Äôt know, man. Maybe I‚Äôm just getting old. Maybe this is what happens. One day, you're a happy kid riding your bike, and the next, you're standing in your driveway at 11 p.m., arms crossed, just **judging the hell out of your neighbors.**

I caught myself doing it last night. My neighbor‚Äîthis 22-year-old kid‚Äîhe‚Äôs outside blasting music on a Tuesday, and instead of ignoring it like a normal person, I literally walked out onto my porch just to **stare** at him. No words. Just‚Ä¶ judgment.

And he saw me, too! We locked eyes! And I know he was thinking, **""Look at this old man, all pissed off.""** But I wasn‚Äôt even mad! I was just‚Ä¶ **disappointed.** Like, that‚Äôs how you know you‚Äôre officially old‚Äîwhen you stop getting mad, and you just start **shaking your head at people.**

Anyway, that‚Äôs my time. Thanks, everyone‚Äîbe nice to each other! Unless you‚Äôre in a merge lane.

I (F 27) have a boyfriend (he's awesome, Imma marry him up one day) who I love very much. He comes not only with a pretty face and awesome personality, but also with an amazing family. His parents have created a warm and cosy home for him and his siblings and I feel blessed that I get to be a part of it. The bond I get to have with his mom in particular is very special to me. 
I come from a cold home. My parents do love me and I know they try, but my mom in particular is distant and definitely not a hugger. I can honestly not recall her ever telling me she loves me. Most days I can deal with the mommy issues I've got as a result of this, but some days are just hard. Mother's day for example is a day where I cry my eyes out about it. It's not like I haven't tried either, but she just isn't and never will be the kind of mom you can go shopping with, have a coffee with, who calls you when sick or buys you a treat 'just because'. All this to say that I really treasure the warmth and bond I've got to develop with my boyfriends mom. 
My boyfriend has siblings and a few years ago I set one of them up with a friend (F 25) of mine (I'll call her Alice). They hit it off and have been a fun and loving couple ever since.  Alice is a kind, strong and all together amazing person. A few years ago she lost her mother after years of battling cancer and she has been so strong in dealing with the aftermath. Seeing her being invited into this warm family, which we now get to share, has brought me so much joy. So much has fallen on her shoulders at such a young age and I know how much it means to her that she gets to have this love in her life. She has grown especially close with our MIL. They are two peas in a pod and they hangout quite a lot. As a friend I'm so happy she still gets to have a loving mother-figure arround, but as her sister-in-law I can get so jealous... 
I find myself despicable for having these feelings. I genuinely love Alice and I would give her the world if I could. But there are days where I just want to scream ""I'm here too, I need the warmth of a mother too"". I've tried hanging out with my MIL, but since me and my boyfriend moved out, it hasn't been so easy. My MIL and I have a great relationship and I know she loves me too. But I sometimes feel like she likes and loves Alice more. It breaks my heart sometimes cause I so desire the love of a mother.
All of this is of course no one's issue, except my own, so I have never and will never act on these feelings. 
I just don't know what to do anymore. I could really use some advice. I hate seeing them hangout and feeling so jealous I want to cry.

My friends literally called me ""Tomorrow Man"" because that was always when I'd get started. As a 21-year-old entrepreneur trying to manage a full course load, while working full time, I'd start projects with enthusiasm but drop them at the first sign of difficulty. My portfolio stayed empty and my confidence took a nosedive. 

The turning point came when I realized my problem wasn't laziness‚Äîit was my mindset and approach.

**The Game-Changer: Micro-Steps**

The breakthrough happened when I started using micro-steps breaking tasks into such tiny actions that they become almost impossible to avoid. I still remember the relief when I first tried this and actually finished something without the usual panic.

Instead of Complete term paper I'd just write Open a document and write one paragraph. Instead of Study for final exam, it became Review just 3 flashcards in the next 5 minutes. Honestly, it felt kinda stupid at first, but that was kinda the point?

**My 3-Part System**

I used three simple techniques to make this approach stick:

**1. Visual Reminders:** I put colorful notes with my daily micro-step on my desk and created specific 5-minute calendar blocks for starting work. (The bright orange sticky notes worked best for me - can't miss 'em)

**2. Friction Removal:** I set up my workspace the night before and eliminated potential distractions, making it super easy to begin. This means putting my phone in another room sometimes lol.

**3. Built-in Rewards:** I turned it into a game with points for completed actions. These points earned me small rewards I actually looked forward to (video games, coffee, guilt-free breaks).

**The Results**

Within three months, I finished more projects than in the entire previous year. My mindset transformedI went from constantly avoiding work to consistently taking action.

The most unexpected benefit? This new approach naturally spread to other areas. As my work habits improved, I found myself applying the same principles to exercise and saving money. I even started showing up to the gym 3x a week, which NEVER happened before.

The simple truth: Start incredibly small, set yourself up for success, and reward yourself for showing up, not just for the end result.

What tiny first step could you take right now on something you've been avoiding?

Sorry for the wall of text - got a bit carried away! Happy to answer questions about specific struggles if anyone's curious. This approach saved my sanity, and I hope it helps someone else too.",26,1740752197.0,getdisciplined,3,0.93,False
