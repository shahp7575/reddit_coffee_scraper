We actually met in DC and both went to college here so the transition was pretty painless and smooth.  It’s nice to see family and old friends as we’re both from the east coast originally. 

But man, do we miss Sac. We both cried as we headed east on 80 out of the city. We miss the coffee, the people, the food, the palm trees and sunshine.  We miss the plants and the hummingbirds and the delta breeze. We miss the laid back vibe of the river on a weekday in the summer. God I miss the Panaderias, the elote man, the vibrant colors and architecture. Cold mornings and oppressive sunshine. Clear blue skies. 

What a special hidden gem of a paradise. I don’t feel like I took it for granted when I lived there, but man do I miss the small things now that they’re gone. 

Take care sacramento, stay you, we’ll be back for sure, hopefully for good.  ❤️

1m8xnh6,https://i.redd.it/9p1fw6p4j0ff1.jpeg,Help dialing in Tabi beans,"Picked up a bag of these recently from Middle State Coffee in Denver. The barista seemed to highly recommend these beans over some of the others. I rested them for 2 weeks per his recommendations, but after 4 cups I’ve really only been able to produce what I consider to be “generic coffee flavor.” 

I’m using a v60 and Comandante C40. I started at 25 clicks (93 C) and Lance’s 1-2-1 method, but that produced a cup that was way too acidic. So I dialed the C40 down to 20 clicks and then brewed with 4 equal pours instead. But that just produced more of a bitter cup. I haven’t been able to pick up any fruit notes at all. I’m not one to try and taste everything tasting note put on the bag, but with tasting notes like these I would expect to at least get a slight fruity feel and taste.

I’ll continue to adjust grind size and temp, but since this is the first time I’ve brewed Tabi beans I figured I’d see if anyone on here has any advice or recipes for them.

Thanks!

### Quick Humor Break:
So, what do you call an AI that can write a great novel? “A novelist without writer’s block.” 😂

Seriously though, the potential is insane! But the big question is, why are we often hesitant to dive into these strategies? Fear of the unknown?

You could literally be sitting on a goldmine. Plus, each step you take builds momentum. 

Just imagine: you’re at a coffee shop, sipping your favorite drink, while your AI tools are making it rain. 💰✨ Pretty sweet visual, huh?

1m8xk39,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1m8xk39/sf_spacecraft/,[SF] Spacecraft.,"In 1946, I inherited a large patch of land just outside of the wonderfully named town of Zzyzx, in California, including part of the Mojave Desert. There were about 500 acres, included was a large farmhouse, outbuildings and approx. 700 head of cattle, plus acres of Alfalfa. 

As a city dweller, I was totally out of my depth, luckily my late uncle had employed about 20 staff, so the farm ran very well under the farm manager that my uncle had employed. I had nothing to do, so using one of the farm's jeeps, I set off to explore my new domain. Each day I would take a map, compass, food, and a flask of coffee. 

It was on one of these exploratory trips, that I got lost, the compass went haywire, spinning wildly like a top. As I didn’t know the area, I was totally disoriented. Nothing looked familiar. I parked up and looked around, all the sand dunes looked the same. 

My brain felt foggy, I couldn’t concentrate. I slumped back in my seat, I couldn’t focus on the map, I’d forgotten everything that Sargent Olsen had taught me when I was drafted into the army in “42. 

How long I sat there, I don’t know, when I became aware of my surroundings, it was still daylight, but the sun was in the wrong position in the sky. I drove back to the farmhouse, it was 5:00 am, somehow, I had lost at least 14 hours. 

I was ravenous, I went for a shower, wrinkling my nose up at the smell of stale urine that surrounded me. Had I been out of it for so long I had wet myself.? After putting my clothes in the laundry basket, I took a long hot shower. 

After showering, I cooked a large breakfast of bacon, eggs, hash browns, toast, coffee, and O.J. that would set me up for the day. After eating, I made my way to the tool store, collecting a sledgehammer and a load of wooden marker stakes. 

I dipped the tops of the stakes in red paint so they would be visible. I made two flasks of coffee, some sandwiches, I took a new smaller scale map showing the area where I had been yesterday, plus plenty of pencils, so I could mark the area. 

It took me a few weeks to plot out the area, but I ended up with a circular area, about 60 feet across, I noticed that the plant growth was different inside the circle. I spoke with the farm manager and asked him about the area, he said that the local Indian’s wouldn’t go near there, they thought the area was haunted by bad spirits. 

He said that even the cattle avoided the area and wouldn’t graze there. I told him that I was going to investigate the area, I hired a digger and started excavating. I had excavated down about ten feet, when I hit something hard, try as I might, I couldn’t dig it up, I moved about six feet to the side and tried again with the same result. 

I spent the day excavating, moving around, and excavating some more. Within a week the smooth desert sand resembled the craters on the moon or the battlefield of the Somme. I had no idea what I was digging up, but I was like a man obsessed, I would drive out there early every day, and would labour under the blazing sun, until late at night. 

Finally, I uncovered a large metal plate, recessed into the metal was a large locking wheel, as I touched it, I was hit by a loud burst of static, just like a wireless radio, that needed tuning in properly. The noise was so loud, my ears started to bleed, I sat there, dazed, my head feeling like it was going to split in two. 

As suddenly as it had started, the noise was gone. I wiped my face and drank my coffee while my heart returned to a regular beat, and then I walked back to the metal panel, very gingerly, I reached out and touched the locking wheel. I was tensed up expecting another burst of static, but there was nothing. 

The panel was covered in strange markings, unlike anything I had seen before. I lay on my back in the sun, thinking hard, what on earth had I found, I suddenly thought, maybe what I had found wasn’t from earth at all. I decided to try something, I picked up the sledgehammer and swung it hard against the panel.

There was a dull clunk, and the vibration of the hammerhead shook the hammer from my stinging hands. The panel was undamaged, not the tiniest scratch was visible. This confirmed to my mind that I was standing on a piece of alien technology, my mind was agog, how far had this thing travelled.? 



I climbed back into the digger and moved back a few feet, I started digging, I continued down until I could see the bottom of this thing, it didn’t seem very big, maybe ten-feet deep, and approx. sixty feet across. There appeared to be a gentle curve to the thing, making it oval and not flat. 

It appeared to be embedded in the rock of the hillside. I gave some serious thought about opening it.? When I drove home late that night, I was thinking of the gas masks, we had used in the Pacific while fighting the Japanese, would the masks be sufficient.? Probably not, what else could I use?. 

Then in the morning, it came to me, back in my hometown, an old army buddy had set up a sub-aqua diving club, he had racks of diving suits, and more importantly self-contained breathing kits. I made a few long-distance phone calls and undertook the long drive back to Long Beach, after calling in to see Mom and Pop, I called in to see Jimmy Brent. 

We had grown up together, went to the same schools, played little league together, kissed the same girls, got called up together and served in the same pioneer unit in the Pacific. That is where I learned to use heavy earth moving equipment, and because I still had my operator’s license, I could hire the digger. 

After the war, Jimmy had opened a diving school, that was slowly taking off, he had about 200 members, and a fully equipped hire shop, including a large oxygen compressor for refilling oxygen bottles. We met for a few drinks, a few turned into a lot, and we both got rat-arsed, getting kicked out of a bar at about 2:00 am. 



Both of us were way too drunk to drive. We staggered the few blocks back to Jimmy’s shop, and crashed out on a pile of wetsuits, we had both slept in worse places. In the morning, over coffee, I gently probed Jimmy about wetsuits and breathing equipment. I fed him some cock and bull story about finding a cave system on my land and wanting to explore it, but there was a large underground river blocking the way. 

Jimmy started talking about the merits of different wetsuits for their thermal properties, and different sized oxygen bottles and face masks. I left there with a top of the range wetsuit and three 40-minute oxygen bottles. Plus, contact details of a local (to me) diving club. 

After a few days, I loaded up my car that my uncle had left me in his will, a sandy coloured 1946 Studebaker and started the 190-mile trip home to Zzyzx. After a few days, talking with the farm manager and checking that the farm was running properly, I decided it was time to crack open the craft. 

So early next morning, I drove the old farm jeep up to where the craft was still semi-buried. I pulled on the bulky wetsuit and connecting the oxygen bottle just had Jimmy had shown me, I approached the craft. I made sure that the goggles were tight on my face, turned on the oxygen bottles, put the mouthpiece between my teeth, and taking a deep breath, reached up and turned the locking wheel. 

With a sharp screech, the wheel started to turn, after two full turns, the door swung open, I could feel countless centuries of dead foul air rushing past me. After about fifteen minutes, the air pressure seemed to equalize. I opened my eyes, I hadn’t realized that I had shut them, I looked for the first time inside a vehicle that hadn’t been made on earth.

As I looked, small purplish coloured lights came on, they didn’t show much. I decided to return in the morning, with flashlights so I could explore the craft safely. The next morning, I returned after a hearty breakfast, I wriggled into the craft. The craft seemed to be sitting pretty level as if it had been parked and not crashed. 

The head height seemed to be about 6 feet, I’m 5 feet 10 inches tall, so, I could stand up straight. I walked slowly down the corridor, there were hatches leading off from both sides, I could see piles of greenish/blue dust laying in corners, I noticed that as I walked deeper inside the craft, lights started to come on, these were a lot brighter. 

The corridor led to a large room, all the walls were of a white metal, in front of a large featureless wall, was a chair, it looked a little small for me, but I managed to sit down. As I rested my hands on the arms of the chair, buttons suddenly lit up, the wall in front of me slide to the side, exposing a large picture of the surrounding area. 

As I sat there, headphones clamped themselves into my ears, there was a burst of static, and I could feel the engines burst into life. Without a sound, the craft was starting to extract itself from where it had been buried for millions of years. As the craft gained height, the picture in front of me changed to a seamless view of the surrounding area, I could see my farm. 

I could feel myself getting weaker, the craft was using my lifeforce to power itself. As I blacked out, there were alarms blaring. The craft had only been flying for about a minute before it crashed. 



Official Report.



We responded to reports of a plane crash, we found the area littered with pieces of a substance, unlike anything we had ever seen before. Very light, like tissue paper, but incredibly strong. Recommend the whole area is put into quarantine and cordoned off. ASAP.

1m8xjdy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/1m8xjdy/my_psoriasis_and_diet/,My psoriasis and diet,"About a year ago I started getting very itchy scalp and extremely dry hands. Initially moisturizing helped, but suddenly it seemed like I was putting lotion on my hands all the time, I would wake up in the middle of the night scratching them anyway. I finally went to a doctor when my palms starting splitting. 

  
When I went in the splits were healing up, but I had foresight to take some photos. Quickly and easily diagnosed as palmoplantar psoriasis and clobetasol (sp?) was prescribed. Problem solved, sort of. Strong steroids would stop or reduce my psoriasis but never quite eliminated it from coming back, it was more like 2 weeks on 2 weeks off, although my scalp issues went away and stayed away. 

Like most here I noticed that when I would vacation or travel I would clear up and have fewer problems. So I do think stress is a strong trigger for me. Then I also realized that the foods I was eating when I would travel were very different than what I typically ate at home. I tried a few versions of restrictive diets I have narrowed mine down to dairy/lactose products. By cutting out everything except milk in my coffee my psoriasis is all but gone I haven't had to use steroid ointment in about 6 weeks. 

  
So while everyone's body is different and responds differently to what you put in it/on it, I think you should keep trying and exploring what will work best for you. Having this and dealing with this absolutely sucks, but through some persistence and luck I was able to hopefully figure out mine.

  
Diets I tried:

Gluten free (no effect)  
sugar free (no effecy)  
Lactose free (effect!)  
Nut free (no effect)

Therapies:  
short band UV (mild)  
sun (strong)

Medications:  
Euchrasia (no effect)  
Cortizone (no effect)  
Ammonium lactate (helped skin under psoriasis)  
Salycyclic acid (mild)  
Clobetasol (ointment/alcohol, very effective)

UV lights and sun helped but it was nearly impossible to maintain the amount of exposure I needed and work as needed. Clobetasol 2 weeks on 2 weeks off would clear me up, and then I would start a diet a one week through my clobetasol treatment. Eventually learning that lactose free has worked wonders for me. I was told by a doctor that some people my age do become lactose intolerant (40s).

  
I hope this does help someone else, as mentioned it drove me crazy but it seems like a have a plan I can try to follow. As a sidenote I did try some ice cream and it didn't lead to full blown episode, but I could feel a gradual itchy feeling returning in my palms and at my next physical I do plan to ask about some type of testing to confirm what I have stumbled upon.

They post pictures of startup offices, iced coffee, sublets with a “view” pretending they’re living in some indie film about chasing dreams in your twenties. Meanwhile, I’m stuck in Bangalore traffic, watching autos race past.

But just recently, we started hopping on Discord and talk. What they share were interesting.

Someone had a panic attack after checking their credit score. Another guy is skipping meals to cover car insurance. One of them hasn’t seen the sun in weeks, working two jobs, sleeping through the day and running on fumes. Only one from all of them sound light, somehow, not too worried.

It’s weird. You see the skyline and think they’ve made it. You see the “living the life” posts and wonder if you’re behind. But half the time they’re crying into an overpriced Chipotle bowl, sharing an apartment with roommates they can’t stand.

I used to have major FOMO about not going. Sometimes still do. But lately wondering if I dodged something? I'm not rich here either, but I'm also not having panic attacks every time I check my bank balance.

But let’s be honest — school also had some of the worst smells known to humanity.

I still shudder remembering those old-style Tiffin boxes from the 90s. The oily bhindi sabji or ghee-dripping aloo and ghea sabji would somehow leak, mix with roti corners and mysteriously soak into the corners of books. You’d open your bag and be hit by that pungent tiffin+paper+foil hybrid smell, a scent now filed in my brain under ""nightmare fuel"".

Monsoon was its own trauma.
Wet school bags with that horrible plastic-canvas smell, soaked notebooks, and leaking Milton water bottles.
Socks were always wet. Shoes stayed soggy till next day.
And haldi stains on notebooks? Permanent. Like they were doing turmeric therapy.

And that one umbrella we carried inside the bag? Yeah — it ensured nothing stayed dry. Even the dry math homework would curl up like a scared leaf.

All of it — those smells, the discomfort, the feeling of dragging yourself through the day in wet socks and a yellow-stained notebook — made me hate going to school. I still get queasy thinking of it.

Sure, school had friendships, innocence, some good memories.

My boyfriend and I have been together for about a year and a half, and plan on getting engaged in the next year or so. I love him very much. 

But he does a few things that drive me insane. He works every other weekend, so admittedly we don’t get to spend much time together those weekends. When he doesn’t work on the weekend, he wants to be with me and go with me everywhere I go. 

This would already be a little obnoxious, but he also doesn’t like what I want to go do. I’m a big reader and writer. I told him I wanted to go to a coffee shop to read, and he insisted to come with me. While I tried to read, he just… sat there. Watching me. When I asked if he had a book or his phone or something he got upset and said he doesn’t want to just “sit here all day”. 

Then, the next day, I was going to go to a bookstore event (I swear I do things other than read, despite how this post seems lol) He said he wants to come with me, but go to a different store in the area. When we get there, the place he wanted to go was closed, and so I had to rush through being at the bookstore because he was bored and annoyed that his place was closed. He has since brought up that I “made” him go with me several times. 

These are just two examples. This happens nearly every weekend. How do I tell my partner than I can’t be his entertainment at places like this? ",3,1753445553.0,relationship_advice,5,0.8,False
1m8xg1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1m8xg1r/man_i_miss_her_but_heres_our_story/,"Man, I miss her but here’s our story","So my (now ex) and I met on our College Snapchat group on March 12th, 2023, and instantly felt chemistry together. For the next few months, we talked every day and every night, and slowly felt like something more was developing between us. 

Fast forward to September 1st 2023, when I was on the way to pick up my text books for that semester. I messaged her and asked her if she wants to meet up at campus, which we did. Mind you we have never met in person before that, so it was really exciting to finally see her. The first few seconds that we met, she already mentioned to me how she feels “like she has known me forever”, and I agreed. 

We spent the day hanging around campus, and then we went to our houses. A few days after that, we began hanging out more and more on campus. Two weeks later, it was really obvious that we had feelings for each other, so I asked her out, and we started dating. As the next few days went by, we did so many things together like our first date at an animal park, where we had so much fun. We went back to my house to eat pizza. When she needed to go back home, we gave each other a long hug, and kissed. She then knocked on my door, and said how “she forgot her phone in my house”, but she just wanted to kiss me again. It felt amazing to finally have someone that really understood and loved me. We had so much in common, and were the same person just in two genders. We really were soulmates. 

She told me that she loved me in November. We briefly talked about kids, and while she never planned to have kids, she wanted to be parents together with me. Again, after meeting ME, she wanted to have a kid together. Everything felt perfect: we fell asleep on FT a lot, wore matching Halloween costumes together, went to animal shows, etc. That’s when everything started changing in December. 

I bought her a lovely heart shaped necklace for her birthday, and she loved it. We had a lot of fun again. A few days after, while she was at my house, I randomly had a giant derealization attack, which barely happened back then. She comforted me, and told me I was ok, but after that, we decided to take a few days for ourselves. Something started to feel off. 

We shared a new years kiss together. In January, she had trouble with financial aid and was about to give up, but I helped guide her through it, which she really appreciated. We went somewhere that week, where I had another anxiety attack, which led to me STAYING IN HER CAR while she went to go get something from the store. I felt so embarrassed that this kept happening, that I vowed to start learning how to reduce my anxiety. 

During 2/14/24, i brought up Valentine’s Day, but she said she doesn’t really celebrate that, yet i still bought her her favorite chocolates and got her a rose, which we kissed after that. One month later, we broke up for the first time, because “she thought she didn’t feel as romantic with me”. 

Despite our break up, we still talked to each other, and one day she calls me while at her friends house where her friends family smoked. She told me not to worry as she promised not to smoke. 10 mins go by, and she calls me again on FaceTime while high, and accidentally tells me that she already planned an nice cream meetup with another guy not even a week after we broke up, which never ended up happening. But I was disappointed in her. 

We call each other, and discuss what happened. I confront her about the ice cream meetup, and she told me that if she gets hurt while doing so, then she gets hurt. 

Two weeks go by, and we get back together, she even got me my favorite donuts with a note saying how she wants to try again with me, as no one compares to me, and that she could “just be herself around me”, which I happily accepted. So we continued to date, until one month later in April, we went to our 3rd animal show together. It all seemed to go perfectly fine until I had a giant derealization attack again. I freaked out, and shut down myself for the next hour. I felt so bad because I was already trying to reduce these attacks,and I thought I had perfected it. 

Let me say that I barely ever had anxiety attacks like this one, usually mine would last like 15 minutes, but that’s it. We ended up getting her another pet frog, and we went back to my house, hung out for like 30ish minutes, but then she had to go. I knew that I messed up, and apologized. She said these things happen, and to not worry. 

May 2024: I introduce her to my grandma who was visiting, and we told her how we met. My grandma was so happy for us. Things were looking up again for us. 10 days later, she FaceTimed me (not high), and breaks up with me again as she is going through a lot, and “doesn’t know if she can be in a relationship right now”. Okay cool. 

We spend the summer for ourselves in no contact until September arrives, where I wished her a happy first day back at our campus. She thanked me, and we decided to break the ice. While we met up, we discussed the break up, and she told me that she has moved on from me. However, the next day she randomly meets up with me, playfully bonking me on the head with a stick, and we talk. Over the next few days, we agreed to get back together again. 

One day, we meet on campus, and go to a nearby Dunkin Donuts store. That’s when derealization attack #3 began, and you can probably already tell what happened: I began to be awkward and spill a coffee. As I went to get napkins, I kept stuttering. It was bad. We went back to campus, kissed on a stairwell, but things felt … weird. 

That same day, I got lost on the bus, and went to a different area of the town, with my phone being dead with no charger. So without describing the situation, luckily I found my way back in the end, and she was relieved. 

Two days later, we met up again on campus and talked through some stuff, but it was obvious that my icks have led to her telling me that she wants to be friends. Cool. 

During the next few weeks, we were still in touch and even planned matching Halloween costumes together again. I kept making plans to meet her, which usually she would agree on every time, but she started to give me excuses each time like how “she needed to repair her guitar”, or “left early”. 

I knew that even if some of those were true, things still felt different. Eventually, she sent me a long text in Snapchat where she said that “she doesn’t feel like we should meet anymore as she lost the passion for doing so, which happens with some of her friends unfortunately. She wishes me the best”. 

Again, I doubted that whole confession was 100% legit. Knowing our connection, our chemistry just doesn’t fade that fast even after everything. She blocked me everywhere.

As the next two months went, I was randomly scrolling on instagram where o saw her post regarding her going back to her ex drug dealer bf. 

So now that it’s been a while since that, I decided to try and move on from her: I blocked her, and worked on myself, such as going to the gym, learning new skills, etc. Despite that, part of me still misses her a lot. I don’t just miss her in terms of my girlfriend, but also just as my best friend. Someone who I can just be myself around. Yes she had her flaws and was a bit immature, but we are humans and we all make mistakes, nobody is perfect.

I decided to give it a try. At worst, I'd lose an hour - no big deal. But then... it worked. I kept going, and now I'm making about $200 a day. Honestly, I didn't expect that at all.

1m8xard,https://www.reddit.com/r/micahwrites/comments/1m8xard/smoking_kills/,Smoking Kills,"It’s been almost twenty years since I had my last cigarette. For a long time, I was certain that I’d never have one again. I never stopped wanting them, though.

Tonight I’m ending my long wait. I’m finally going to smoke a cigarette. I suspect this one really will be my last one ever, so before I do, I want to relate what happened.

It started in an alley behind a 7-Eleven. I was fourteen and hanging out with my friend Derek, who was sixteen and looked old enough for the store clerk to sell him cigarettes. I’d been smoking for almost a year at that point. My parents had caught me just a week before, which is why I was smoking behind the 7-Eleven now. They’d paused my allowance and thrown out the pack I had at the house, which was a hefty financial hit for a fourteen year old.

“Go get my soda from the car,” said Derek. As last words go, they were pretty lame.

I trotted off around the corner, then realized I needed his keys. I spun on my heel to ask for them.

“Hey, I—”

In that instant, Derek exploded.

It was horrifying. One second Derek was standing there, cigarette to his lips, taking a deep drag. Then he was just gone, nothing but a whispered blast of red mist. It coated the brick wall and spattered over my face, stinging my eyes. I could taste the coppery flavor of blood.

A man stood there where Derek had been. He was taller and slimmer than Derek had been. He wore a neatly tailored black suit, covered now in a fine mist of gore. He shook himself like a dog. Red flecks flew away to join the rest of Derek on the asphalt. It was a practiced gesture. He was not at all surprised to be lightly coated in blood.

I, on the other hand, was still standing with one hand on the corner of the building, mouth agape. My cigarette dangled limply from my other hand. Even with the blood on my face, I had no understanding of what had just happened. I remember thinking that maybe Derek had transformed, like in Power Rangers—except instead of turning into a cool warrior, he’d changed into a lawyer.

The man locked eyes with me. His lips quirked into a smile. Nothing about his attitude suggested that anything abnormal was happening. That was part of what made it so hard to process. He was acting like this was all perfectly ordinary.

“I really thought you were heading the other way,” he said. “Tsk. I’m usually much better about that.”

“Wha—?” was about all I could manage. I had too many questions that I needed answers to. Where was Derek? Who was this man? Was my friend okay? What was going on?

“Witnesses are such a complication,” he said. He took a pack of cigarettes out of his jacket pocket, tapped one out and lit it. “Friends, though. You can trust a friend with secrets. Are we friends?”

I don’t think I managed any sound at all in response to that. The entire situation was surreal. I had to be dreaming.

The man put the cigarette to his lips and breathed in deeply. In one swift motion, the entire thing burned to ash, all the way back to his mouth. The man himself burned away at the same time. The disintegration started at his feet and sped upward, consuming legs, torso and finally head. The thin cylinder of ash that was all that remained of the cigarette dropped to the blood-soaked ground.

I had no time to gawk at this latest impossibility, because suddenly the man was directly in front of me, stepping through the narrow wisp of smoke wafting up from my forgotten cigarette. He ripped it open like torn fabric and grabbed me by my shirt, lifting me up and slamming me against the wall before I had even processed his arrival.

“Are you a friend?” he snarled. His face was bestial, demonic. Its unforgiving lines were everything every sculpture of a devil had ever tried to capture. “Or are you just a witness?”

“Friend!” I gasped out. The brick wall ground into my back. His knuckles were a rock against my chest. I could not breathe in. I was certain in that moment that I was about to die, so I said the only word that seemed like it might buy me a few more seconds of life.

“Very good, then.” He looked legitimately pleased as he set me down and brushed off the front of my shirt. “Then I’m pleased to make your acquaintance. You can call me Ash.”

“My—my friend…” I whispered.

“Yes, we’re friends now.” I was afraid to disagree with him, but he saw the slight shake of my head and realized that he had misunderstood my meaning. “Oh, you mean your other friend? He’s very dead, I’m afraid. Unless he had a particularly rare blood type, they’ll never even find enough to know what happened. He’ll just be marked down as missing. Tragic, but it happens.”

He sighed. “You’d think that being able to travel through smoke would be amazing. And honestly, it is. But the Grey World is so—well, there are a lot of complications. And once you make it through that and come back out, people always have so many questions. Who are you, where did you come from, how did you do that. It’s exhausting, really.”

He picked up my cigarette from the ground and took a short drag. As the tip flared, I saw that the white paper was stained with Derek’s blood.

The man—Ash—didn’t seem to mind. He blew out a cloud of smoke and watched it drift away. “The thing about smoke is that it gets into all sorts of places. And the Grey World doesn’t much care about inside and outside, or solid objects. You can just come through wherever. It’ll push things from the lesser world out of the way. As you saw. It’s a bit messy, perhaps, but so are all of those questions you get otherwise.”

He tapped me on the chest. “You don’t ask a lot of questions. I like that about you. It’s why we’re friends. Keep that in mind.”

Ash reached into his jacket pocket, and I flinched backward. I was certain in that second that he was going to shoot me. I don’t know why, after everything I’d seen, I thought he would do something as prosaic as that. I think it was just my mind trying to translate the overwhelming threat into something I could recognize.

He didn’t pull out a gun. Instead he took out the pack of cigarettes I’d seen him use earlier. He pressed it into my hand.

“Here. A gift. From a friend. If you ever need me, just light one up. I’ll be there before the smoke clears.

“Don’t hold it in too long, though.” He smiled and winked, as if what he’d said was funny instead of a deadly threat. As if I hadn’t just watched him detonate my friend for the sake of convenience. As if I had any doubt that he’d do the same to me if it suited him.

I said nothing, though. I just stood there and stared as he breathed in the last of my cigarette just as I had seen him do before, burning the entire thing at once and himself along with it. I stood there in the alley, dappled with blood and surrounded by the smell of cigarettes, staring at empty air until finally the pack of cigarettes he had given me slipped out of my numb fingers and fell to the ground.

Something about that finally snapped me out of whatever trance I was in. I walked away, slowly and unsteadily at first, then picking up speed until finally I was running. Derek had driven to the 7-Eleven and we were at least five miles from my house, but I ran the entire way home without stopping once.

I was desperately out of breath by the time I got home, but I managed to make it up the stairs and into the shower before I finally collapsed. I got in fully clothed and sagged against the wall as I let the water burn over me. It swirled pink in the bottom of the tub, the last remnants of Derek.

I knew people would ask about him. I knew I would lie. Friends kept secrets. I was not at all sure that I wanted to be Ash’s friend, but I was positive that I didn’t want any other option.

The last of my energy drained away with the stained water. I stumbled to my bedroom and was asleep almost before I hit the bed.

I woke the next morning to my father shaking me awake.

“We’re very disappointed in you,” he said.

“What? In what?” I couldn’t imagine how he knew what had happened in that alley, or what he would have expected me to do differently.

“Smoking again! Your mother and I made it clear how we feel about that.” Behind him, my mother was rummaging through my drawers, looking for contraband.

“I wasn’t—I didn’t—”

“Don’t lie to me! This room reeks of smoke. You could have at least opened a window. You’re stinking up the entire house.”

He wasn’t wrong. The smell of smoke hung heavily in the room. But I’d been asleep the entire time.

“Found them!” My mother triumphantly held up a package of cigarettes. My heart thumped as I recognized them—not just the brand, but the specific package. The bloody smear on one corner made it clear that these were the ones Ash had handed me in the alley.

My father frowned. “All right. We’re going to try a little aversion therapy. This is what my father did when I thought I might try smoking. He took me outside and made me smoke the entire pack. Come on, let’s go.”

“No!” I panicked at the idea. Smoking even one cigarette would be foolhardy. The entire pack? Breath after breath of smoke in my lungs? I might as well throw myself out the window right now.

“You’re the one who wanted to smoke! So come on, let’s do it.”

I screamed. I cried. I flailed. My father ignored it all and dragged me downstairs by the arm, the dreaded cigarettes clutched in his other fist. I begged and pleaded as he sat me down on the porch. I clenched my lips and turned my head away as he tried to put the cigarette in my mouth. I think he still thought I was just throwing a tantrum about being caught, until he struck a match to actually light it and I threw up all over his shirt.

He dragged me back inside with a disgusted look on his face. As we passed my incredulous mother all he said was, “I think he’s learned his lesson.”

The worst part was, I hadn’t. I wasn’t going to smoke a cigarette, obviously, but I still wished I could. I craved them fiercely in the following weeks, and even when the physical need died down, I still missed what they’d represented. They were rebellion. They were freedom. They were adult.

The fact that they meant instant death stopped me from having one, but it didn’t stop me wanting one.

My parents threw out Ash’s cigarettes, of course. Not that it did any good. I found more packs in all sorts of odd places: in my locker at school, stuck in the chain locking my bike, in one of my shoes in the shoe rack. The packs were always opened with one cigarette missing. If I looked around, I could usually find a long cylinder of ash.

I never knew what to do with the packs. I didn’t want to throw them away and offend Ash, but I certainly wasn’t going to use them. I mainly let them pile up in my school locker. It seemed the safest place.

I couldn’t have them at the house. I was terrified of my parents finding them and forcing me to smoke them to learn a lesson. It wasn’t just that I didn’t want to die. I wanted my parents to stay safe. I knew how Ash felt about witnesses.

Every month or so I’d see Ash, usually from some distance away. He’d step out of a doorway and catch my eye as he exaggeratedly shook red droplets from his hands. He’d take a cigarette from a pack and tilt it toward me in an obvious gesture of offering. I’d smile and shake my head. We were friends, after all. I had to look friendly.

I knew that this was all a game to him. It was obvious that he knew he held all of the power. Playing along kept me alive, though, so I performed my role.

“I never see you smoke anymore,” he said one day when he’d actually come close enough to talk. “Don’t you trust me?”

“Of course I do,” I lied. “But you said the Grey World is complicated.”

“It is.” His voice held the slightest edge of menace. He didn’t like where I was directing this. I bailed out.

“I just like things uncomplicated.”

“Smart,” said Ash. He tapped me on the chest, his usual gesture of approval. I didn’t like how it resonated in my lungs. I think he knew that. “You should do something with those cigarettes I bring you, though. Give them to your friends.”

None of my friends smoked. I’d cut ties with everyone who did. It probably would have been fine to hang out with them in groups, but I couldn’t stop picturing ending up alone with one of them one day, even briefly, and seeing them light up a cigarette and then—burst. Just like Derek had. There would be nothing but the mist, and Ash laughing about it.

I did start giving them away, though. I gave a pack to a homeless man who asked me for change one day. It wasn’t really on purpose. He asked for money, I patted my pockets, and I’d found the pack earlier that day and still had it on me. His eyes lit up when I handed it over.

“Thanks, man!” he said. I hoped he got to enjoy them. I tried not to think about Ash.

I saw him again a few weeks later, panhandling on the same corner. It gave me hope and a huge sense of relief—but also allowed me to give myself permission to hand out the other packs. He’d made it, after all. It wasn’t a death sentence. I could keep myself safe from Ash’s potential wrath without sacrificing anyone else. Necessarily.

I still didn’t give the packs to anyone I knew. I’d give them to clerks at gas stations or coffee shops. When I got older, I’d give them to people at bars. Most folks accepted them when I told them I’d quit and was getting rid of the rest of the pack. It was true enough. No one ever asked how long ago I’d quit.

Every pack carried that nicotine temptation. It was made worse by the fact that I knew I couldn’t possibly have one. Ash wouldn’t have spent years keeping cigarettes tantalizingly in front of me if he wasn’t waiting for me to slip up. Every pack was a sweating stick of dynamite, ready to explode.

Boom. Mist. Just like Derek.

I don’t know how many people I killed over the years. Looking back, I can admit that that’s what I was doing. Ash dropped off a pack or two every month, so call it twenty a year. That’s four hundred people I handed live grenades to, and said not one word of warning. They were all smokers anyway, and there was nothing special about the cigarettes Ash brought me. They were all sorts of brands, all types. He could go through any smoke. They weren’t in any more danger than they had been before I gave them the packs.

That was my rationalization all along. But the Grey World is complicated. I have no idea if I was ever right about that. Maybe I marked every one of them.

It doesn’t matter much now. Ash is dead. I saw it on the news yesterday. His name wasn’t actually Ash, which shouldn’t have surprised me. I spent twenty years thinking of him by that name, though. It was strange to see another one on the chyron under his smiling, professional photo.

He was the CFO of a cigarette company, which is why his murder made the news. They said he’d been stabbed, and that police were looking for any information. They didn’t provide so much as a sketch of the assailant, which meant that they had nothing at all.

They didn’t show the body, obviously, but I wonder what the stab marks looked like. Were they normal? Or was there something odd, like perhaps they’d come from the inside?

I don’t know. I don’t know anything about the Grey World. I never asked a lot of questions. Friends didn’t do that sort of thing. Not friends who wanted to stay alive.

But I do know that this wasn’t a random mugging. This had something to do with the Grey World.

When I saw the news, my first thought was: I’m free!

My second thought was: I can have a cigarette again.

The thought hit me like a bolt between the eyes. I could feel the cigarette in my mouth, the rush of smoke into my lungs. I hadn’t felt that sensation in two decades, but it was like it had never left. The smooth sensation of the nicotine taking hold, the utter freedom of it all. I wanted it. I’d been wanting it since I was fourteen. And finally, finally I could have it.

I walked to the store. I went to the front counter. I asked the cashier for a pack. For the first time in my life, I bought my own pack of cigarettes from a store. I carried it outside, feeling the unfamiliar sensation of the plastic wrap under my fingers. Every pack Ash had brought me had been opened, missing the one he’d used to take himself back to the Grey World. This one was new. This one was mine.

Then, as I turned the pack over in my hands, it suddenly occurred to me: I didn’t want it. Cigarettes had always meant freedom, doubly so since Ash denied them to me. But now that he was gone, freedom meant freedom to choose. I didn’t have to make the choice I’d made at fourteen. I didn’t have to do things simply to rebel. I could make my own decisions. I was free to do whatever I wanted.

I threw the pack in a trashcan, unopened. I walked home feeling lighter than I ever had. I entered my house, flopped down on my couch, heaved a huge, relieved sigh—and saw the pack of cigarettes on the end table.

There was a note on these. It said, “To Ash’s pet.”

Pet is the right word. We were never friends. In all those years, he never even asked my name. I was just a thing he kept around for his amusement. And now that he’s gone, it seems that whoever killed him is planning on cleaning house.

I could still run, of course. I could start a new game, try to amuse whatever new thing is out there. I could stay alive a while longer, probably.

I think instead, I’ll have that cigarette that I’ve been waiting for all these years. I’m going to light it. I’m going to savor it. And then I’m going to breathe the smoke in and hold it in my lungs for a long, long time.

Yep. In Denmark, there’s a law that says you must check underneath your car before starting the engine... just in case there’s a kid sleeping under it. Not a mechanic. Not a stray pet. A whole child.

From what I could dig up, this law dates back decades and was rooted in legitimate public safety concerns. At one point, it wasn’t out of the question for kids—mostly in rural areas—to play outside, wander off, and fall asleep in odd places… like under a car parked in the sun. So the Danish government, in the most Scandinavian way possible, decided to legislate common sense.

But here’s where it gets weird: it’s technically still part of the national vehicle safety regulations. A real, enforceable rule. Not checking under your car could, in theory, land you with a fine. For not child-proofing your driveway.

1m8x64f,https://www.reddit.com/r/HerOneBag/comments/1m8x64f/my_first_onebag_attempt_what_i_learned/,My First One-Bag Attempt: What I Learned,"Hi, everyone. A few weeks ago, I submitted a [lighten my load](https://www.reddit.com/r/HerOneBag/comments/1ll250t/15_bags_a_month_in_europe_help_me_lighten_my_load/) post here. I received some excellent advice, which I tried so hard to take on and ended up panicking and ignoring some of it. All of you were so helpful, but I have historically taken the big 112L suitcases on weekend trips, so when I saw empty space in my 38L carry-on, I filled it. But I learned some things! 

We went to Canada, London, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, and Germany.

**What I took in my 38L carry-on:**

* three linen dresses (black, blue, floral)

* three linen skirts (black, beige/black stripe, blue)

* two pants (black linen, black airism joggers)

* two shorts (black linen, black airism)

* four tanks (white, black, gray, blue)

* three long-sleeved linen button-ups (beige, white, blue)

* three graphic t-shirts (white, navy, black)

* one heavy linen cardigan (beige)

* one uv hoodie (black airism)

* one packable uv rain jacket (blue airism)

* three pairs of shoes (gray Converse, blue New Balance, black Birkenstocks)

* ten pairs of underwear (5 nylon boyshorts, 5 cotton briefs)

* six pairs of socks

* four bras (black, pink, blue, wireless)

* one pair of short bike shorts (gray)

* hair straightener

* face wash

* four paperback books

* small white noise machine

* headphones

* chargers and adapters

* empty 40L duffle bag

**In my crossbody:**

* passport

* credit cards

* sunglasses

* stuffed animal

* chapstick, lotion, sunscreen

* kindle

* phone

This was way too much (which all of you told me it was). 

**Dresses and Skirts**

While I wore all the dresses, I only wore the floral one once; I would not have missed it if I had left it at home. I also wore all of the skirts, but again, I only wore the striped and the blue skirts once each; next time, I will only take the black. 

**Pants and Shorts**

I wore both pairs of pants multiple times, so I'm really glad I brought both. I did wear the airism shorts once (when we went to Disney Paris), but they could have easily been replaced with the short black dress with bike shorts under (which is what I wore on an all-day biking tour). I didn't wear the linen ones at all, I didn't think I would, and I should have left them behind. I wore the bike shorts under the black dress and the blue dress as they are both quite short, and I am fairly active. I washed these every night in the hotel sink, but next time I think I'd want a second pair.

**Tops**

I wore all the tees, but I could have just stuck to one and left two at home. I wore all the button-ups, but favored the beige and white. I only wore the blue tank for sleeping, but I wore all of the others out. 

**Sweaters and Jackets**

I had originally packed a cashmere cardigan, but I swapped it last second for a linen one. I am so glad I did because it was so hot our whole trip. There were a few occasions when we were out early morning or late at night, and I'm glad I had the cardigan, but I would have died in something heavier. That said, it is quite bulky and takes up a lot of room when I only wore it three or four times. The black uv airism hoodie I used as secondary sun protection at theme parks and countryside hiking. It packs to nothing, and I'm so glad I brought it. The airism uv jacket is water-resistant, and I wore it once to go out and buy umbrellas in Brussels. It packs very small, so even though I only wore it one time, I'm glad I had it.

**Shoes**

I wore all of these, and I'm super glad I brought them all. We got caught out in the rain a few times, brief heavy rains, and our shoes got soaked. Luckily, I always had two dry pairs, so I could lend my daughter a pair and still have dry ones for myself. They took up a lot of space, but they were clutch.

**Undergarments**

I wore everything. I wore the quick-dry nylon undies when we were out during the day and swapped into cotton for the evenings when I sweat less. I washed them every night in the hotel sink, and it was easy. I'm glad I brought them all.

**Misc.**

I did not use my hair straightener or my headphones a single time. I read the paperbacks on the trains and then left them there when I finished them. But every train station had a bookstore with an English section, I could have just bought books there rather than hauling them with me from the US. I used the white noise machine and my kindle every night. I also slept with my plush and did not lose it. I wore my sunglasses every day.

**What I learned:**

I do not need to fill my suitcase. I had plenty of things, and leaving empty space would have made for a much more pleasant transition between countries for me. Also, we were not in isolated areas. If I needed something, I could obtain it easily; I didn't have to bring everything with me. In the future, I will spend more time really thinking about what I do and do not wear when we're abroad and being considerate of what I really do need and what I can leave at home. Most of the advice I received here was spot-on in hindsight. So while I'm sorry I ultimately ignored a lot of suggestions because I freaked out, I am so grateful you guys took the time to help me before I left.

Doing laundry on the go is actually so nice. There were laundry mats within a 20-minute walk of all of our hotels. They were all clean, well-stocked, and took cards. We did laundry in every city using the local places, and it was so easy. Every place had a cafe across the street or in sight, so we just started our loads, set timers, then went to get breakfast or a coffee. It was great.

Now, the best part. I packed a large weekender duffel so I could fill my suitcase with goodies and check it on the way home.

**What I bought:**

*  Magnets from every city and every touristy activity we did (we got a log of magnets).

* From Canada: maple candy, coffee chocolate (we're in Canada often, so this is a less exciting list).

* From London: We were mostly here on layover, so I didn't get to see much, but I got a stuffed Paddington in a collector's box.

*  From the Netherlands: a sunhat from a local milliner (she was so nice!), Royal Delft Miffy figurines, stuffed Dutch Farmer's Wife Miffy.

* From Belgium: a ton of chocolate, speculoos cookie tins, a bag from an old leather house, a set of silver earrings from a local jeweler, umbrellas, and jams.

* From France (we were here the longest): a jacket made in Paris, silk scarves made in Lyon (you can tour the facilities and see the silk worms at work, it's so cool), a painting by a local artist that showed a cafe we had dined at, Kelsch storks from the Alsace region, jams, butter, a lot of sunscreen (about a 2-year supply), Coke (I don't drink soda in the US because it's gross to me, but I had a Coke at lunch everyday in France, it is so good), and an Aristocats sweatshirt from Disney Paris (I've never been to Disney and felt like the Aristocats merch was particularly special in Paris).

* From Germany: A Black Forest cuckoo clock (this was big and fragile, so we had it shipped), a candle carousel, and a custom Lego minifig.

I checked both my suitcase and my duffel to come home, and everything turned out great. In the end, I overpacked for sure, but I still made it three weeks in Europe with only my carry-on, and I am so proud of myself for that. Our next trip will be to Japan, and I'm excited to put into practice everything I learned here.",31,1753444571.0,HerOneBag,4,1.0,False

I'm usually pretty good at expressing myself and don't have a problem coming up with the words I need to convey my point. 

I'm running into an issue with everyone asking me why I'm still going thru with chemo even though my PET is clear and my lymph node biopsies were negative. 

Obviously my doctors have decided I should do the chemo. There's no research available for my particular tumor combination, according to my oncologist. In his opinion there never will be because it's that rare. He,  along with a 50 member tumor board, decided that treatment would be based on the TNBC protocol. He continually stresses the RARE nature. I'm on board with doing the chemo and radiation as I don't want to worry that anything is still in there. 

Most of my family has the same question, and they ask it, repeatedly. Why put yourself thru chemo if everything is clear?

I'm not flinching in my decision, I just don't want to have a long, drawn-out conversation about this. Especially when I'm deep into treatment if anyone asks why I did it.

1m8x28c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Situationships/comments/1m8x28c/chat_i_need_help/,Chat I need help  :),"Hey , so I’ve been talking to this guy for about 2-3 weeks.It all started when I went boxing with my brother , and he mentioned he was getting personally trained by one of his old friends and I asked if I could join ,and so I did.I personally hadn’t seen the guy since I was in elementary school, cause him and my brother had drifted apart , but tbh I didn’t really remember him but anyways.The thing is i found him attractive,but I tried not to get ahead of myself cause mind u he is my brothers old friend.Anyways I went home after the training and honestly i couldn’t stop thinking about him it was like someone had casted a spell on me and a bit later I got a follow request from him on insta, then we started following each other and I was like ,no big deal prob, but then I had posted a story and he liked it and then texted me something about boxing but basically we started talking.Fast-forward a while later he wasn’t responding as often and I don’t know if I was overthinking it but I felt like he wasn’t interested and I kind of started pulling away…(mind u I’m an avoidant ) but I mentioned that, and he just assured me that is not the case and he was just busy cause he works.He had also mentioned if I wanted to we could hang out sometime but he didn’t say a date he just said if I wanted to take a ride with his car.And I got a bit confused as to what that means like if he was a f*boy or serious , and I said maybe for a coffee and he agreed so I thought maybe he isn’t a f*boy , but the thing  is ,we mentioned this and found a coffee place ,more like I found one 🙄 but he never initiated to make the plans or brought them up again…But I thought I’ll just see how this plays out yk I’ll be a chill gal but then after a while he left me on seen in a different convo.He apologised but I got a bit tired of all this confusion and no clarity so I responded coldly and he just liked the messages which I don’t blame him but what should I do in this situation? Does he like me or is he just a f*boy? P.S. I tend to overthink a lot from these things and I hate that I get attacked to people when only in the talking stage so I kind of freak out, and I haven’t been doing that well mentally so I got sick of all this overthinking that’s why I responded coldly as well. I was thinking of explaining to him that I’m not in the best headspace rn and I don’t think this will work out as clarity but a part of me feels like whenever I express myself to guys like that they secretly don’t care or will probably be making fun of me to their guys friends.So that the summary of it ,chat what should I do ?

1m8x1h3,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoHeidiLita/comments/1m8x1h3/july_25/,July 25,"My Love and I finished running in the brilliant morning sun and stopped midway at our diner for coffee. A busy day ahead with many tours, this time invites to the congregations of the various churches Guy has worked with.

You know, from the conversations about education we have with the people coming through on the tours, I’m coming to see that my personal story has significance. When it’s my turn I talk about being raised as a single child in a family where money was not an issue. This meant the best private schooling. I always did well there but it felt like I was playacting.

After my parents had purchased a fancy motorhome and we began spending summers at the RV Park and this is where my real education began. I was with “just kids” and I began to open up and think about my life. Julie connected me to two new private music teachers who introduced me to the Great American Songbook. I felt at home at last!

Eventually, I had the courage to tell my parents I wanted to go to public high school. I auditioned for and got into LaGuardia High School for the Performing Arts where I met Lolita, Mr. Maniotis, Coach, Dean Sullivan, and Ms. French who all helped guide me to my inner self. Classes were classes and I ran a respectable “A” average--but in the non-Honors track. The real education for me was in everything else: Being in a committed relationship with Lolita, girls sports, volunteering with ACS and Dean Sullivan, therapy with Dr. Susan, doing gigs with my private teachers through the ALDI band, moving to the East Bronx, training for the half-marathon, and SGI Future Division.

All the other “consultants” are much better than me when it comes to explaining the theory and features of the Longhouse School. But I can say from the very bottom of my heart: “This is the school I would have enjoyed attending, and this is where I hope my children can one day attend.”

At any rate, after *Heidi’s Corner* last night, we got on the phone with Mom, Dad, Muma, and Pupa. As always, My Love had us all cracking up—this time impersonating Professor Kurtz and me in a conversation I had on Wednesday which she had overheard on speakerphone.

PROFESSOR: I read your blog. What? You don’t know [As Time Goes On](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_Time_Goes_By_(song))???

ME: But I…

PROFESSOR: What is wrong with your teachers?

ME: But, Professor…

PROFESSOR: I say that’s professional incompetence! You should sue them for professional neglect!

ME: *(finally getting a word in)* Professor!!! They taught me the song but they called it “A Kiss is Still a Kiss”!

PROFESSOR: What? You learned the wrong title? You have Herman Hupfeld, Rudy Vallėe, Dooley Wilson, and a million other musicians all spinning in their graves! After “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” this is only the second most important song in cinema history…

Of course, this was only kinda the real conversation. But her monologue *was* so funny!

1m8x17k,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/1m8x17k/是_to_be_or_not_是_to_be_one_major_difference/,"是 (to be), or Not ‘是 (to be)’? One Major Difference Between Chinese and English","In my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/1lts2xo/why_your_chinese_sometimes_sounds_unnatural_youre/), I mentioned that we often put a small word in front of adjectives when describing something.

Right after that, someone messaged me asking if my example was wrong—shouldn’t it be “她是有点累” instead of “她有点累”? Was the word ""是"" missing?

Well, that’s actually a common misunderstanding when learning Chinese.

The trick is, in Chinese, adjectives can function as full predicates. That's why Chinese can skip the word ""是"" (shì, ""to be"") where English requires ""is/am/are."" This is a *major* difference between the two languages, and mastering it will make your Chinese sound much more natural.

Let me break it down with a few real-life examples:

* 这咖啡超级难喝 Zhè kāfēi chāojí nán hē = This coffee is super nasty
   * You should say “超级难喝”, not “是超级难喝”
* 这电影太无聊了！Zhè diànyǐng tài wúliáo le! = This movie is so boring!
   * You should say “太无聊了”, not “是太无聊了”
* 我老板疯了，他今晚就要方案！Wǒ lǎobǎn fēng le, tā jīnwǎn jiùyào fāng’àn!  = My boss is crazy — he wants the proposal tonight!
   * You should say “疯了”, not “是疯了”

Of course, there are exceptions. For example, admitting something before a “but”: 

* 今天是很热，但你不出门就没关系 Jīntiān shì hěn rè, dàn nǐ bù chūmén jiù méi guānxi = Sure, it’s hot today — but it’s fine if you’re not going out. 
* 他是很讨厌，但我们不该背后说他坏话 Tā shì hěn tǎoyàn, dàn wǒmen bù gāi bèihòu shuō tā huàihuà = Sure, he is really annoying, but we shouldn’t talk behind his back.

Or in a “it’s X, not Y” sentence:

* 我是怀孕了，不是胖了！Wǒ shì huáiyùn le, bú shì pàng le! = I’m pregnant — not fat!
* 他不是年轻，是幼稚 Tā bú shì niánqīng, shì yòuzhì = He’s not just young — he’s immature

In short, sometimes you just need to boldly stop using “是”—there’s no harm in it!

1m8x161,https://www.reddit.com/r/chiangmai/comments/1m8x161/discrimination_in_chiang_mai/,Discrimination in Chiang Mai,"
I don't know whether I can name the restaurant (let me know), but it's a vegan 🍕 eatery with pretty good ratings.

So, I dropped my partner at the place and went to buy coffee at a nearby shop. When I came back, she told me that the receptionist had first given her the menu, but then returned two minutes later and randomly asked, ""What's the time now?"" (Like, seriously!?)

It was around 11am–12, I guess. Then he said, ""We have a booking at this time. Can you sit outside?""
Mind you, there was literally no one in the café.

Obviously, she was taken aback, but she went and sat outside anyway. When I heard this, I told her, ""Let’s leave."" He didn’t seem to care.

But then I said, ""Let’s go. If you want, we can still order from Grab""
Suddenly, he came back to us and asked whether we were going to order through the app. I said yes and now he claimed there was a problem with the app blah blah.. which I checked and found wasn’t true and even asked us if we wanted to come inside.

Just terrible and disgusting.
We left the place.
The guy was a local. We’re Asians. 
We were in Chiang Mai for 7 days, and this was the only negative encounter we experienced.

1m8wwuz,https://i.redd.it/9s1vuihmc0ff1.jpeg,AMPX DD - Batteries that will (literally) take us to the moon,"Hi Degens: long time lurker, first time poster with some DD. I tried to post this a couple of weeks ago but didn’t have enough karma. (Sucks for all of you cause the stock has had a great run) Read, roast me, or scroll past, but here’s why I’m bullish AF.

TLDR: Amprius makes silicon anode batteries that destroy traditional lithium-ion cells in every performance metric. They’re already shipping to defense and aerospace clients (think drones, UAVs, etc.) and drones are so hot right now.

Let’s get this out of the way first: Amprius makes silicon anode lithium batteries. Not fancy-sounding “solid state” science projects that need 7 more years in a lab. These batteries actually work, are in production, and are already in the field. Oh and also, they are best in class. 

Energy Density: 2x traditional lithium. Charge Time: as low as 6 minutes. Weight: 50% lighter. Cycle Life: This is the theoretical problem with silicon anodes which has stopped them from being mass-produced. Amprius has figured out a way to get 500 cycles and it’s been improving.

If you want longer range, lighter aircraft, faster charge, and a power source that doesn’t need its own backpack, you want this.

These are not hypothetical specs. Drone manufacturers are already using them. Reddit reviews say that these batteries are blowing peoples minds.

WHY NOW?: UAVs, Defense Spending, and a War-Obsessed World

Let’s talk macro: The world is falling apart and every major power is funneling cash into defense tech like it’s 1942.

UAVs and drones are so hot right now. They are the future of war. Read the many DDs of drone companies all over Reddit.

Drones need light, energy dense, ultra-fast-charging batteries.

US Defense Dept. has already awarded Amprius contracts.

“We need 500 Wh/kg batteries for tactical edge UAVs.” -The Pentagon, probably

Add: Rising global tension (Middle east, China, Ukraine) Shift toward electrification of everything in combat=Near-term demand for lightweight, high-performance batteries

And you’ve got the perfect storm for Amprius to dominate military battery tech.

And what if…EVs?

Silicon anode batteries are the holy grail of EVs. Double the range, Half the weight, Full charge while you refill your coffee.

EV makers are all chasing new battery technology. Tesla has talked about it for years, and other OEMs are investing billions in R&D.

But guess what?

Amprius already cracked it. They just need scale.

Their roadmap includes expansion into automotive-scale production by 2026–2027. They’re currently sampling cells to automakers, and pilot programs are underway.

This is the classic “picks and shovels” play. catch them before they hit the big leagues.

And they have actual sales: This Ain’t a Science Fair Project

Revenue is already ramping: Q1 2024: Revenue up 225% YoY , Multiple new clients added in aerospace, drones, and defense. They literally can’t make these batteries fast enough, and have partnered with manufacturers in South Korea for extra capacity.

2025 and 2026 will be inflection years as new facilities go online.

Also: Insiders are NOT selling. In fact, there’ve been multiple buys and strategic investments in recent months.

This is not a pump and dump dead company or some bs startup selling a ChatGpt wrapper. This is a real company, shipping a real, game-changing product, with: Massive tailwinds from global defense spending, A potential EV expansion catalyst, Crazy asymmetric upside from a $900 market cap and oh yeah… they have no meaningful competition. There are a couple other companies trying to crack silicon but Amprius already has.

Most recent analyst price target is $15. And analysts, as we know, are never wrong.

THE RISKS (Because I’m probably a Degenerate) Production scale risk: Can they actually build enough? Competition: Big dogs like Tesla/Panasonic could play catch-up. Battery industry is cutthroat and capex-heavy. Still not profitable (this is WSB, do we care?)

But remember, we’re early. Like pre-Model S Tesla early.

Buy a few shares. Forget about them. Come back when your fridge has a drone delivering your groceries, and it’s powered by Amprius. 

Positions: Long (obviously) 3000 shares. NFA. I’m just a degenerate and drone enthusiast. DYOR. Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose, but be prepared to win.

First, a huge and heartfelt welcome to all the new members who have joined us recently. It’s amazing to see our community growing again.

Whether you're brand new or have been with us since the beginning, I want to speak to you all directly today. This isn't just an update; it's a declaration of our purpose and a formal invitation for every single one of you to help us build the next chapter of BeSocia, together.

💬 Part 1: What is BeSocia? And Why Are We Here?

Manchester is a vibrant, bustling city, but it can also be a lonely one. Many of us, myself included, started this journey simply trying to find a few new friends in a place that can sometimes feel overwhelming. What we discovered was that hundreds of others felt the exact same way.

BeSocia was born from that shared feeling. Our mission is simple: to create genuine, real-world friendships. We are more than just a subreddit; we are the starting point for your next coffee chat, your next board game night, your next walk in the park. We are the antidote to endlessly scrolling and the catalyst for actual conversations.

I know that taking the first step to engage can be daunting. But I want you to know this is a space for you. Your voice matters, and your presence is what turns this from a list of names into a community. If you haven't yet, please take a moment to say hello in the comments below or on our Discord server! Tell us what you love about Manchester, what you're passionate about, or simply what you had for tea. That first comment is the hardest, and we're all here to make it easier.

🌱 Part 2: Building on the Past, Securing Our Future

Our journey as ""Manchester Social"" was a lesson in rapid growth. The community's passion was incredible, but our foundations weren't built to handle it. This led to friction and serious challenges, and as the founder, I take full ownership of that.


It also led to a period where false and damaging allegations were made against me, specifically concerning the safety of women in our community. I want to address this head-on:

These allegations were investigated by the appropriate authorities and were proven to be entirely false.

However, the experience taught me a vital lesson: a community's foundation cannot be built on trust alone; it must be built on clear, robust, and transparent systems that protect every single member. Your safety, particularly the safety of women and vulnerable members, is not an afterthought.. it is the bedrock of everything we do now. That is why we have built the new besocia.com website with its Code of Conduct, feedback systems, and secure moderation tools.

This philosophy of safety and clarity extends to our incredible volunteer team. We've created a new, structured framework behind the scenes, designed not just for efficiency, but for their well-being. It provides our volunteers with the clear support and defined roles they need to contribute their amazing energy without the risk of burnout, ensuring that growing our community is a joyful and sustainable process for everyone involved. We have built the structure we needed from the start.

🚀 Part 3: The Roadmap - How We Move Forward Together

This is a fresh start for all of us. We are committed to building BeSocia with a new level of transparency and collaboration.

Your Voice is Crucial: We want to make it as easy as possible for you to share your thoughts. You now have multiple ways to help shape the community:

1. For new ideas, create a post on the suggestions forum of our discord! This allows everyone to see and discuss your thoughts.

2. For detailed, private feedback, use the official form at besocia.com/feedback/.

3. For any urgent concerns, you can use the confidential report form on our website or contact the moderation team directly via Modmail. Your voice matters, and we're always here to listen.

Real-World Events: Our first relaunch event was a small but wonderful success. It was a reminder of what this is all about: creating comfortable spaces for people to connect. We will continue to post our official events here on the subreddit as well as on our discord, and we are also moving to a more professional Eventbrite system for organisation. We'll announce more about that soon!

Empowering Members: We want you to feel confident in organising your own small meetups. If you want to see if anyone fancies a coffee or a walk, create a post! This community thrives when members take the lead.

✨ Part 4: Our Volunteer Program

To support this vision, we have launched a new, structured volunteer program. This is about finding passionate people who want to help us grow. We have a ""Volunteer Goodwill Agreement"" to ensure that our team is supported, valued, and protected from burnout. This is a partnership built on mutual respect and a shared love for the community.

If you're interested in becoming an Event Host or Community Moderator, please check out our new Volunteer Hub at besocia.com/volunteer/.

❤️ Part 5: An Invitation to All

To our members who were here during the difficult transition: thank you. Your patience and trust have been the bridge that allowed us to get here. I now ask you to join us in re-engaging and helping to welcome our new members. Your experience is invaluable.

To our new members: you are joining at the perfect time. You are joining a community that has learned, rebuilt, and is now stronger and safer than ever before. We need your energy, your ideas, and your enthusiasm.

This announcement is the official end of the transition and the true beginning of BeSocia. Let's fill the community with positive conversations, let's fill our events with laughter, and let's continue the incredible journey of turning strangers into friends
.
Thank you for being a part of it, and once again a personal heartfelt thank you to those who stood by while the allegations were appropriately investigated and proven to be entirely false. ❤️

We’ve been together for a couple of years and are preparing to get engaged very soon. It should be a joyful time but I’ve been feeling incredibly uncomfortable by my SIL (brother’s wife, F 26)

I need to know if I’m being dramatic or if this is as inappropriate as it feels because I’m losing sleep over this. A few months ago, my SIL started making comments toward my boyfriend that felt… off. What began as occasional remarks has turned into what I can only describe as flirtatious, boundary crossing behavior. Here’s a rundown of what she’s said and done recently:

• Gifted him a dunkin gift card which I thought was a sweet gesture! it was only her turning to me afterwards and saying she hopes he “thinks of her when he drinks his coffee in the morning” and maniacally laughing that I found odd. 

• Was wearing revealing workout clothes before he came over one day and joked about staying in them so she “could tell him that she was working out” even though she wasn’t.

• Talked about learning to cook food from his culture and wanting to host him herself which, to me, feels like blatant overstepping but she insisted that cooking is her love language so it’s okay. 

•When he once blew me a kiss at a gathering, she dramatically ducked and said “don’t worry, I ducked!” as if the gesture was meant for her.

• she had called him for what I’m assuming was an update on the proposal he’s planning and made it a point to text me to tell me that she’s on the phone with him and to not worry, because that’s not his “sneaky link 😩”. the implication alone was odd to me. 

• In the middle of a serious text convo between us  about a family member’s surgery, she randomly said “tell (bfs name) to pull up 😩😩” completely unrelated and unnecessary. Surgery was for a family member on HER side by the way. 

• the majority of these comments and “jokes” are made only to me privately. she acts relatively normal in front of him. I notice some semi pick me behavior that I shrug off when she’s actually in front of him but nothing too alarming. she did tell him multiple times that she is “so excited to meet his mom and dad” and that she “can’t wait to have conversations with them” when our families eventually meet. It just feels like encroachment to me. Why do you feel “so excited” to meet MY boyfriend’s parents? Is this not inappropriate. I’ve viewed meeting my siblings in laws as a necessary part of their marital process, nothing I was super thrilled about or bringing up constantly? I already have a relationship with his parents but I just found this odd. My own siblings aren’t this “excited”. 

I’ve kept my mouth shut about all of this. I’ve said nothing to her and nothing to my boyfriend, because I’ve been afraid of looking insecure, jealous, or like I’m starting drama especially at an important time like this. I just feel like I’m being gaslit into thinking this behavior is normal. It’s not.

I still care about my SIL and honestly love her. I don’t want to blow up my family. But I’m starting to question if her intentions are genuinely sisterly or something else entirely. At this point, I feel disrespected by her and honestly disappointed in myself for not speaking up sooner.

EDIT: 
I’d also like to add, my boyfriend does not like speaking to her privately and prefers to go to my brother directly regarding anything to do with the proposal surprise. he also does not go over to their house without me and my brother present as he views my brother as the man of the house. he already has limited interaction with her. 

So I’m asking Reddit:

How would you personally interpret this kind of behavior from a family member?
	•	Has anyone navigated something like this before and what worked?
	•	How can I bring this up to my boyfriend or her in a way that’s constructive, not explosive?
	•	What are some ways I can draw boundaries without causing a total family blow-up?
	•	How do I protect my peace while staying grounded and not reactive?

	
Thanks in advance for the help.

1m8wsze,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1m8wsze/trying_to_get_adhd_diagnosis_without_family/,Trying to get ADHD diagnosis without family support and looking for advice.,"Hi everyone, I’m 18 and in my first year of uni in Australia, studying pharmacy and working part-time. I’ve been struggling with attention, focus, motivation, and emotional regulation my whole life. I’ve suspected ADHD for a while now, but I haven’t been able to get diagnosed because my parents don’t believe in mental health and still control most of my finances, even though I’m legally an adult. I've asked several times but have been brushed off by then, and coupled with a lack of freedom financially and elsewhere I decided to come up with a secret plan.

I recently opened a secret bank account and started slowly saving up to get assessed privately. I found a telehealth clinic (Akkadian Health) that does ADHD assessments and works with your GP for shared care. It costs around $1280 but I should be able to hit that amount by early next year if I keep saving.

I’ve had problems since childhood, like being unable to focus unless I was really interested in the topic, constantly fidgeting or shaking my leg, talking too much or loud in class and elsewhere, zoning out, always reading instead of paying attention, talking out of turn or interrupting people who ARE already talking, and asking to leave the room ""for the bathroom"" but it was really for no reason but to get out of my seat. Teachers often said I had potential but didn’t apply myself, and although I ended up with an 83 ATAR, everyone did expect far far higher and I didn't start studying for my WACE until 2-3 weeks right before.

Now in uni I still struggle to start assignments, procrastinate everything until the last minute, can’t manage multiple assignments at once (I can only start and finish one at a time before moving onto the next, which obviously isn't possible since uni is content heavy as hell and assignments overlap) , and blank out completely during exams. I can’t function without music for chores or brown noise while studying, and I feel emotionally all over the place. I also drink a lot of tea and coffee daily without it affecting me much at all and apparently THAT'S also a flag. Hell if *I* know. But I can't get things done without actually having a cup near me. So I end up drinking 6-7 cups a day lmao.

I’ve got a lot of other little things that make life harder than it should be, but I don’t know what’s ADHD, what’s normal, and what’s not. I’ve started researching this seriously and it all kind of lines up, but I still doubt myself sometimes and wonder “what if it’s not ADHD?” even though it’s affecting my daily life in a major way.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation where they had to get diagnosed without family support or had to keep it secret? And for anyone diagnosed in Australia, how does the actual diagnosis process work? What kinds of questions do they ask, and how much do school reports and history matter? Also, if you did get diagnosed, how did meds or treatment help? I’m trying to figure out if this is worth all the effort and cost.

Any advice, experiences, or reassurance would really mean a lot. I’m just trying to get my life together but feel stuck in this weird limbo of maybe-ADHD and hiding everything from my family. Thanks for reading.",2,1753443445.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False

1m8ws19,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/1m8ws19/one_persons_path_to_becoming_a_graphic_designer/,One Person's Path to Becoming a Graphic Designer,"Art was always important to them in elementary school. Even though all kids at that age make art, they were into drawing and painting much more than their classmates. They would create art at home, making up their own characters and comic stories. They read comic books and watched animated TV shows and movies, always wondering how those things were made. 

In middle school, they continued drawing and painting but they started creating art with software as well. Friends, family and teachers would give them high praise at student art shows. They started to be identified as an artist – a title they happily accepted. Friends and family started asking them to create flyers, signs, posters, labels, and other small projects – sometimes for free but occasionally for a bit of money, which always felt great.

When high school started, they got more serious about art and began focusing on digital tools more than traditional media. They joined the school newspaper and learned how to do layout for the print edition. The term ""design"" came up more often than ""art"" and design software started to feel more natural. People would regularly ask them technical questions, which they could usually answer off the top of their head. If not, they'd research the issue. They were starting to be seen as an expert in digital design tools.

As the end of high school approached, thoughts of a future career took focus. College was expected and though the early love of art was still there, it had become clear there were no full time salaried jobs creating art, so being a Fine Art major and trying to make a living as an artist didn't feel realistic and more importantly, wasn't likely to get parental support. But Graphic Design was a major, and it felt close to design – you get to express your creativity and get paid for it, and tons of people would see your work. Creating logos, posters, album covers, packaging – it seemed fun and although they hadn't done a lot of real design work, they knew the software pretty well which should give them a head start. They applied to schools as a Graphic Design major, got accepted into a few and chose one. 

Freshman year of college only had a minimal focus on the major but there was Intro to Art History and Design Fundamentals, which were enjoyable. As soon as Sophomore year hit they got to delve deeper into design and art classes, learning about layout and composition, color theory, typography and more. The teachers were enthusiastic and the projects were a lot of fun. Students were encouraged to use their own photos and illustrations in assignments. Sometimes they would write copy for mock ads or magazine spreads. Even better, there were branding projects where the students were allowed to name a product or company and design a logo and branding system around it. All of this was very satisfying in ways they hadn't really imagined before college, and it felt like the best combination of art and design.

They were still required to take classes in drawing, painting, sculpture, and other forms of traditional art. Mixing in with the Fine Art majors in those classes was an interesting insight into the other side – the differences between art and design were becoming more clear. And yet they were doing both, and still reading comic books and watching animated movies and TV shows, but also noticing how packaging, brochures, t-shirts and other designed items were produced. It all felt related and so many forms of creativity felt within reach in their future career.

By Junior year, talk of careers with teachers and advisors became more prominent. One classmate mentioned to the teacher that they planned to get a job where they can incorporate their illustration skills into their graphic design work. Several other students reacted positively, expressing the same goal. The teacher nodded and smiled a bit, saying sure, that would be a great job to have.

The summer after Junior year they found an internship at a local marketing agency. The company's main business was printing menus and promotional material for local restaurants, where the design of the material was part of the business's ""value add"". They got to work on real world pieces and they'd sometimes see their work out in the world (often after seeking it out – mostly when they were with their parents) which felt great. It wasn't an album cover or a festival poster, but it felt like progress toward making those kinds of pieces.

Even though the work itself wasn't the most creative, they did convince their manager to let them do line drawings of food for one menu project. The manager said it wasn't necessary because they could just get line art and any other images needed from the stock asset service they subscribe to, but he gave in to the argument that bespoke illustrations would give the menu a personal touch. It took some unpaid overtime and the client didn't seem to even understand what custom illustrations were, but it felt like the first victory of integrating illustration into professional design work – a fun footnote in the future when their illustration work would be much more well known.

By the end of Senior year, after an encouraging portfolio presentation with family members, faculty, alumni and a few working designers from local agencies, they graduated. Their portfolio had a series of music festival posters with prominent illustrations, a vinyl album cover, a poster for an imaginary movie, a magazine spread in an experimental, grunge style, a type specimen project, branding projects for a coffee shop, a food truck selling pastries, and a brewery, and a couple small freelance flyers and ads done for friends' tiny businesses.  And to help attract the ideal future employers, there was a section filled with art and illustration projects from school as well as a few personal projects. A link to their Instagram account showed even more art – pretty much everything they'd ever created since high school, in every style possible . Ideally a comic book publisher, video game publisher, genre fiction publisher, record label, movie studio or a creative agency that had those kinds of clients on their roster would be looking for a designer with illustration skills and find their portfolio, be impressed and offer them a job.

After graduation, they moved back home and started job hunting. There was a short period of relaxation and relief before concerns about student loans became an issue. They started applying, but they didn't see any job posting for their ideal kind of future employer – the kinds of companies with a high creative output. Instead, all of the Junior Designer postings were from companies in boring-sounding businesses, and many like 3PL, procurement, compliance and regulatory services, and OEM weren't anything they'd even heard of or understood. They applied for a few of those jobs just as a backup and to be able to tell their parents that they were taking some kind of action. It felt like there was still time, though they could feel the pressure growing.

Over the next few months, design friends from school started getting hired, although the jobs and companies weren't the best. One friend started at a small local newspaper doing basic layout and reworking ads from small businesses. Another signed on to a marketing company, doing a bit of graphic design but also creating social media promos and other smaller marketing projects that didn't involve design. None of this was encouraging although it started to feel like spending a year or two at a not-so-great design job wouldn't be the worst thing.

Six months after graduation, other former classmates had started working. One started at a legitimate creative agency, although one that specialized in the medical field. Once in a while they would get to design a logo for a new doctor's office or dental practice, though the classmate joked that the client always chose the least interesting option. Most of their day was spent doing more mundane tasks like migrating data from a previous website to a new platform that the agency was building. The friend said they spent half a day just resizing doctors' headshots and putting them all onto the same background, then uploading them to the new website being built. They had already started talking about looking for a more creative design job in the next year, once they got more experience under their belt.

Finally an offer came in! The salary was pretty low but since they were living at home, they could deal with it. Their parents were delighted and encouraged them to accept the offer, which they did. They began working as the sole graphic designer for an educational publisher. It wasn't too bad. While the pay wasn't great, it was on par with what other design graduates were getting. Their co-workers were nice people and there was a huge relief in finally not having to search for a job. Their parents were happy, they now had benefits and even a 401K plan as well as a sense of satisfaction at having landed a job in their major.

A year after starting at the job, they started feeling a combination of burnout and depression. When they'd think back to their mindset in college, they'd wonder what happened to the kind of clients they were looking for. Would moving to a better geographic area help? Or maybe it was just the current job market. None of their classmates seemed to be doing much better and many were still looking for that first job. A few had taken non-creative jobs although they said it was only temporary and they were still keeping an eye out for design jobs.

They had tried to get some illustrations integrated into their work projects but there was no time and no interest from management. Deadlines were almost always extremely tight. Time was money. And because the company was an educational publisher, there was no direct communication with the customers buying the books, who were teaching hospitals or colleges and universities, so much of the feedback was management's interpretation of what would and wouldn't sell. Budgets were monitored closely so safe, basic designs were what worked, usually following one of a handful of templates. There were a lot of meetings and many administrative tasks that took up more of their time than actual design work. Several marketing teammates of a similar age started getting promoted, one to a management position even though they were only in their late 20s. They started to wonder what their career path would be like if they were to stay at this company – which they didn't plan to do – especially with no designer above them. 

A year and a half into the job and with some real world work now under their belt, they realized it was time to update their portfolio. They started looking online for examples from other designers, which made them feel inadequate, seeing so much truly creative and sometimes groundbreaking work. But once they dug in deeper, they understood that much of the more creative work was being done by freelancers, some of whom were ""name designers"" – people hired specifically for using a single signature style, which is often highly illustrative, that they imposed into each piece they created. There seemed to be only a small amount of these designers and the same names kept coming up. How do you get that job? They hadn't freelanced since they started working at the educational publisher. Maybe it was time to put effort into getting some side projects again.

And it became clear that a lot of the other creative work they were seeing was being done by designers like them, working jobs at boring companies while doing these more fun projects on the side. The more they researched it, the more it became obvious that much of the cooler work was even being done by college students or recent grads. Someone on a design forum posted their fee for a music festival poster, which seemed way too low since the client and artists performing were so high profile. The person who posted the thread said it took six weeks to complete the project since it took approval from everyone involved and many rounds of revisions. How many projects would someone have to do on to make a living from this kind of work? They wondered if anyone out there was actually making a living as an illustrator or a designer doing high profile creative work. It all felt like an illusion.

Two years into the role, things felt better. Not perfect, but there was an acceptance about where they were in their life and in their career. A handful of former classmates had given up on looking for creative jobs, but others had progressed in design and marketing roles. One former classmate who was never really into the fine art classes was now working as a junior art director at a well known agency, working with some household name clients. Another had learned that she actually likes design as much as art. She had started selling her watercolor paintings online and at craft shows on weekends and said the combination of a full time design job and more creative work as a hobby works really well for her.

Once in a while there would be a random meetup with a more junior designer or a current design student and talk would turn to careers. They would always debate about how truthful they should be. To be totally honest about what the field is really like would be disheartening to the younger designer. Maybe their experience wasn't universal, although it felt pretty common. And because there had been no exposure to their work, there was a risk that these people will assume the reason they weren't in a more creative role is because of subpar skills.

When a large project came in, the company decided to hire a summer intern. Even though the intern would mostly be doing marketing, creating social media posts on Canva was one of the requirements, so management asked for help reviewing resumes and portfolios. After having worked professionally as a designer for over two years, seeing what new graduates put in their portfolios hit completely different. Illustrations of animals, landscape photography, logos for imaginary retail businesses… none of this was close to the kind of work that an educational publisher needed. These people could have so easily visited the company's website and social media accounts and shown compatible work, but instead they were showing designs and adjacent skills that had little to no connection to any organization hiring designers. There were lots of projects with poor handling of type and many full portfolios that had no photography – only illustrations in every project. Easily half of the portfolios seemed to be freelancers looking for clients rather than designers looking to get hired into full time roles. It was easy to choose one candidate from the few applicants who had projects that made it clear they could do the job.

Three years in, the job feels comforting. There are aspects of it that they actually enjoy, and while it's not the kind of creative expression that they imagined in their younger years, there is a satisfaction in seeing their design skills improve as well as having the stability and savings to move into their first apartment, which they did. Designing icons was fun and kind of like illustration. Creating videos weren't as restrained by brand guidelines. And there were always a few employee events every year, and the invitations and signage for those were more open-ended than day-to-day type projects like reports and presentations. There are a few regional trade shows every year, and seeing their designs on large signs and displays was satisfying. Co-workers are always supportive and managers give regular praise and that went a long way. They thought about other career options less now, though they still had a vague regret about not moving on to something more creative. 

And of course, they feel grateful to have a job at all, and one in the field that they had their degree in. Still, thinking back to the promise of school and that early portfolio work, they would wonder why people hadn't been more honest about what the design field was really like. Teachers and schools clearly had no incentive to be completely open about what working as a designer was really like. And a lot of people in the field seem to be portraying a lifestyle that they weren't really living – partially out of preserving their ego and partially so they could be perceived as doing high profile creative work, to keep themselves in the running for the more desirable freelance work and full time design roles. Design influencers were living in their own world, selling the promise of a life of creativity. All of that seemed like a fantasy. And besides, if someone had laid it all out to them truthfully before they went to college and chose a major, would they even have listened anyway?",1,1753443362.0,graphic_design,2,1.0,False

I screamed as my pup was brutally ripped from my belly by my Alpha mate, who believed my stepsister's lie about my betrayal.

I died in hatred, but when I woke, I was reborn.

Laughing through tears, I swore, ""You two will pay for your sins!""

""Please don't do this."" I begged over and over, but no one was listening. ""I am your luna."" I screamed at the top of my lungs, but then his laugh from the other room broke all the fight in me.

""Luke please."" I begged once more time, my voice horse.

""Take it once it's done. Toss her out. She will have to survive on her own from here on out.""

He can't mean that. This was our baby.

""Is a mistake from the Moon Goddess. One I will rectify."" His voice called again from the other room. He wouldn't even face me. ""Now do it. That's a command.""

""Yes, Alpha.""

""Oh, and doctor?"" Her sweet voice called from the other room. My stepsister, Shannon. I gritted my teeth. ""Don't use any anesthetic. She should feel everything.""

""Yes, Luna."" The doctor turned back to me with sad eyes, but when he picked up the scalpel, I knew I was screwed.

I'm sorry, baby. Momma couldn't save you. I tried to rub my stomach, but the nurses had strapped me down. When the doctor approached, I realized he was using a silver blade.

""Silver?"" My whisper was almost silent, but he nodded. I knew then that Shannon didn't want me to survive. She wanted my life so badly that she lied about me cheating on my mate, showing photos as proof.

I cried silently as the doctor cut into my abdomen, and I felt my baby thrash inside. He knew it was too early to be born. This was a death sentence for both of us.

""Bring me the body of the pup.""

""Yes Alpha.""

I felt every slice as he cut into me, and finally I could take it no longer. I thrashed against the restraints. But the silver had made me weak.

""Doctor, now.""

""Yes Alpha."" The doctor picked the baby up and rushed out, leaving me spread open to the elements.

I felt my life slipping away as the door opened and Shannon came in. Her smug smile was firmly in place.

""I told you I would take your life, Amy. I would have your mate. "" Shannon walked over and laid a kiss on my face as I snarled. ""He is perfection. And don't worry. I will give him another son."" She laid her hand on her stomach and I started to laugh. ""What's so funny?""

""I can smell the beta on you. That's Derek's child, and it's a girl. Nice try though.""

She snarled and raised her hand, growing her claws to deliver the final blow, but the door was ripped open and my mate, the man I now hated most in the world, stepped inside. His eyes were red, and I started to laugh again.

""You runt!"" He snarled and struck out, whipping Shannon to the other side of the room.

""Brandon!"" Shannon shrieked as she hit the wall. ""What's wrong?"" She staggered to her feet, but more blood dripped out of me and I closed my eyes.

""You lied!"" He screamed, shaking the walls as his aura struck out, but I could barely feel it. I felt the silver travelling in my veins getting closer to my sluggish heart. ""This was my pup. I can smell me on him."" Brandon's eyes grew redder as the tears gathered. ""She did cheat on you. I guess I was wrong about the pup.""

""You said you smelt it."" From the sound of it, he lunged for her again, but him clutching our baby in his arm was the last thing I saw. And I wanted to never see it again. He did this to us. Not Shannon.

She played her part well, sure, but him not believing me, not waiting for a few more days to smell the pup, that was his fault. And all of our downfalls.

I prayed for the moon goddess to take me. I no longer wanted to be here. I wanted to be with my pup.

""Save her.""

""No!"" Shannon screamed. ""I am the Luna now, you marked me last night."" Ah, so that was the pain I felt last night.

I cracked my eyes to see my mate, Brandon, hovering next to me. ""Stay with me Amy.""

""No!"" I slammed out, putting all of my power in it.

Brandon looked down at me, pleading. ""Let me save you.""

""I am descended from the Moon Goddess, and you don't deserve to save me. You don't deserve our pup. You were weak. And now you lost everything."" I smiled up at him as I felt my life from my body.

Chapter Two

I opened my eyes to find myself surprisingly alive. ""Amy hurry, you're going to be late."" I jolted up and look around, confused. What was going on? Where was I? ""Amy!"" The voice called again and I shook myself. I stood up from the bed and looked around again. I recognized this room. It was my childhood bedroom.

I hadn't stepped foot in this room since I found my mate, Brandon. I heard a knock on the door and my mother opened it. Before I could process what was happening, I ran into my mother's arms. ""Mom, you're here."" I started to cry. ""I've missed you so much.""

""Amy. My girl."" She laughed as she patted my back. ""I saw you yesterday."" She pulled back and I looked into her amber eyes that matched my own. ""Happy birthday, baby.""

I leaned into her hands and realized that today was the last day I spent at home. I found my mate on my eighteenth birthday. ""Thank you, mom.""

""Hopefully, you will meet your mate today and start your new life."" She smiled at me and I felt my blood freeze. I didn't want to meet Brandon. Not when I knew what was going to happen.

""I'd rather stay here with you."" I smiled as I kissed her cheek. ""I don't want to miss you and Morgan.

And I knew that when Brandon thought I cheated on him, before he treated my baby and me like that. He also did the same to my mother for her involvement. Shannon's father, my mother's husband, watched her die.

""Baby. You won't miss us. We will be there every step of the way."" She kissed my cheek, and I wrapped my fingers around hers.

""Mom, can we just leave? You and me? Leave Shannon and Morgan and move back to daddy's pack?"" My father, the Alpha of the Silvermoon pack, wasn't a good husband, but he was a good man. He cheated on my mother, betraying her when he was drunk.

His betrayal cost the life of my brother growing inside of her, and she refused to move past it.

""No baby. I can't go back."" My mother's face fell as she turned away.

""I don't want to be betrayed, mom. Not like you and not any worse. I don't want a mate."" I whispered my new truth.

""What do you know?"" I watched as her eyes searched mine.

I pulled her back into my room and away from the door. ""I don't know for sure, but I am terrified that if I am mated to Shannon's boyfriend, I will die after we are mated. Mom, the chances that he will match with an Alpha far outweigh the chance that he is mated to the daughter of the beta."" I pulled back. ""I don't want this for me.""

She weighed my words, and I watched as she came to the same conclusion. ""Okay baby. But you can't leave. It would be too conspicuous. You will have to mask your scent whenever he is around.""

I tossed my hands in the air. ""How would I do that?""

""There is much you don't know that I would leave in the past but if you are sure..."" She trailed off and I just nodded my head. ""Then let me make a few calls. You don't have to go to school today.""

I lept back into her arms. ""Thank you, mom. I don't know what I would do without you.""

""I love you, baby. You will never be without me. That I can promise you."" She kissed my cheek and then left me alone in my room.

I ran to my phone and checked the date to make sure. It was twenty eighteen; I went back six years. Six years to the day that I met Brandon. I could relive everything, make better choices. I could live, and maybe this time around, so would my pup.

I went into my ensuite and jumped into the shower. No way was I going to face today, looking like I just crawled out of bed. I stood in side my closet in a towel trying to figure out what to wear when I heard my bedroom door open.

I was about to turn and call out to my mother, but I heard a soft step, which my mother wouldn't do. So I hid behind my winter coats and I waited.

""I'm telling you, if she is Brandon's mate, I'm going to destroy her.""

""You can't mean that, Shan."" The nasily voice of Megan, Shannon's best friend, came from the cell phone pressed to her ear.

""Of course I do. Brandon is mine.""

""Only because you put out. He was hoping Shannon would notice him.""

""You shut your mouth, Megan."" Shannon snarled and her eyes flashed. ""He's mine.""

""Whatever I gotta go,"" Megan called, and then the line went dead. A honk sounded from outside and Shannon was snatching something before I grabbed her hand.

""What do you think you're doing in my closet?""

""Amy?"" Shannon's mouth dropped out. I squeezed her hand until I heard a crack. Her scream was muffled by my hand.

""You're lucky I only broke one finger. You just threatened to destroy me. Didn't I hear that correctly? A beta's daughter threatening an alpha."" I tsked.

""I didn't do anything."" She snarled back at me as her hand reformed.

""Lie again and I will break all of your fingers and hold them while the bones heal."" I couldn't stop my grin as I felt her tremble. ""Did you threaten me?""

""Yes."" she screamed at me. ""You're going to take Brandon from me.""

""I don't want your pathetic alpha now or ever. Keep him."" I pushed her away. ""Now get out of my room before I change my mind about maiming you."" I turned back to my clothes and picked out low-rise jeans and a tank top.

""What is your problem?""

""You. Now leave."" I let my wolf come forward and my eyes flashed. I pushed my alpha command into my words and forcing her out of my room. Foolish girl. How dare she come into my room to take something of mine? My wolf growled lowly. This was our den. I shook myself and refocused. Closing the doors, I hopped back into bed, pulling out my phone. I tried to remember everything that happened in the last six years that could help me with my plan. Because make no mistake, Brandon and Shannon would pay.

Chapter Three

""Pack your bags, Amy."" My mom came in, surprising me from the list I was making.

""What?"" I looked up. ""Why?""

""You are going to spend the summer with your father. I already got the approval from the Alpha."" Mom smiled down at me. ""Come on, baby. Pack your bag and get ready.""

I jumped to my feet and ran to my mom. ""I can go?""

""Just for the summer, baby, then you will be back here with me. I had to promise that you would be returning here.""

I pouted. ""Mom, I really don't want to be here."" I wanted to make them pay, but I wouldn't risk him finding me.

""It's okay baby, you will understand once you see your dad."" She patted my hair and kissed my cheek. ""Now get ready.""

""Okay mom."" I kissed her back then she left me alone. I grabbed my phone to lock it and then turned back to my closet. I packed my bag and then headed into my bathroom when I heard the downstairs door slam open.

""I knew it."" I heard Shannon scream down stairs. I ignored her as I grabbed everything from my bathroom and then I grabbed my laptop and chargers. I stuffed everything in to my backpack and headed downstairs.

""Shannon, why are you screaming?"" Morgan was at the table with his coffee, and my mom was running around when I pushed my suitcase into the room.

""I'm not Brandon's mate, daddy."" Shannon flew into the room and dove into his arms.

""How are you so sure?"" Morgan wrapped his arms around her, but I just snickered. She snapped her eyes to me and she flew at me.

""It's you."" Shannon tried to claw out my eyes. But I just sent her flying with a backhand.

""Amy!"" Morgan got to his feet but my mom tsked.

""Morgan, you can't yell ay Amy for protecting herself. Shan attacked her first."" My mom placed my breakfast on the table. ""Amy, come eat. You have a long day ahead.""

""Babe? Why does Amy have a suitcase?""

""She is going away for the summer. To her fathers."" My mother turned to me and opened her arms. ""Come baby. Come eat. The car is coming and you need to be ready to go.""

I walked over and sat down, and dug in.

""Why is she going to her dads?"" Morgan walked over to pick Shannon up.

""She wanted to spend the summer with her dads before college and who am I to say no?"" My mom smiled down at me and I smiled back at her. I didn't know what was going to happen this summer to protect me from Brandon finding out I was his mate, but I needed it. Whatever it was, I needed it.

""Yeah, my dad called me this morning and since I haven't seen him since Christmas break and when he offered to fly me out, I asked my mom."" I smiled sweetly over at Morgan, and Shannon smiled.

""You're leaving?"" Shannon stood up.

""Yup. I'll be gone the full summer."" I smirked over at her. ""But my room is locked, and it will stay that way."" My smile dropped away as I stared at her and used my alpha command.

""Amy!"" Morgan yelled out. ""You know you're not allowed to alpha command your step sister!""

""And I wouldn't have Morgan, if I hdn't found her in my room this morning, trying to take things out of my closet."" I turned and raised my eyebrow, daring her to try to lie.

""Is that true?"" Morgan looked down at Shannon and I just stared at her. I watch her open her mouth to deny it.

""I wouldn't lie. I'll just command you to tell the truth."" She screeched and stomped her foot.

""Yes!"" she screamed. ""Are you happy? Yes, I went into her closet to steal some clothes because I know she is Brandon's mate.""

""How?"" I threw up my hands, playing like I didn't know the truth. ""How could you possibly know that I am his mate? Neither of us has scented each other.""

""Because he scented you on me!"" Her voice was hitting a higher octave, and my ears were starting to hurt.

""Calm down. You're hurting everyone's ears and just explain yourself."" My mom sat next to me at the table, rubbing her head.

""Last month, Brandon turned eighteen, and I was wearing Amy's dress. He scented around me and said I smelt divine. But when I'm not wearing her clothes, he has zero interest in me."" Shannon pouted.

""So he likes the way I smell, doesn't mean we are mates."" I pointed out. Completely and utterly denouncing Brandon as a mate. If I didn't accept him, he would never be my mate anyway, and I would never accept him. That was the only thing I was sure of.

Brandon would be the last male I would ever touch this time around.

""Stop being obtuse Amy. We all know what it means when a wolf likes your smell."" Shannon started to cry and buried her head in her hands. ""He's the male I want, daddy. The only one I would ever accept. But he wants her."" She pointed to me.

I scoffed. ""I don't want your sloppy seconds, Shannon. Even if he was my mate, and I am not saying he is. It would be a cold day before I accepted him as a mate. I would take the Lycan King over Brandon."" I threw my head back and laughed when she gasped.

The Lycan king was the bogeyman of all wolves.

The last Lycan to exist and one who lives in the wild. It's said the only wolves that ever see his face are the council that oversees the packs.

But either way, I wasn't lying. I would take the King as a mate before I would even look in Brandon's vicinity.

""You're lying. He's the alpha.""

""And?""

""Everyone wants to be the luna.""

""Idiots want to be the luna."" I turned back and finished my food as Morgan calmed her down. My mom stood when she heard a horn.

""That's for you.""

I nodded as I stood and kissed my mother goodbye before I left.

Chapter Four

I slipped into the back of the car after putting my bags in the back and buckled in. I had barely takin a breath before I launched myself over the seats and into the driver's arms.

His laugh made my eyes prickle. ""Hey love bug.""

""Uncle Ronnie. I've missed you."" I climbed over the seats and sat up front. ""What are you doing here?"" Ronnie was my dad's beta. Not related, but he had been there for most of my life.

""You think I was going to let my cheeky niece come to pack lands alone? Not on your life.""

""Dad sent you?"" I laughed.

""Dad sent me. He is a worry wart your da."" He smiled over and laughed with me. ""As soon as your mom called, he sent me with the jet.""

""He didn't have to."" I just shook my head and buckled my seatbelt.

""Of course he did. He never gets to see you enough, and now you're sending in the summer. What's going on?"" My uncle looked at me and I just shook my head.

""I don't want to be here.""

""Why?""

I looked down at my hands that were twisted. ""I'm afraid that my mate is here and I don't want to be right. I figured if I ran away, I could push off the inevitability.""

""Why wouldn; t you want your mate?"" My uncle asked as he zipped down the highway toward the airport.

""I'll tell both you and dad, just not now."" My uncle looked over at me, searching my face and then nodding.

""Fine, but I want the full story.""

""You will get it, I swear."" I nodded back to the road. ""Now focus on driving so you don't ruin us."" I grabbed the wheel, swerving back into our own lane.

""Heck!"" Uncle Ronnie grabbed the wheel from me and focused back on the road. ""I just worry about you, pup."" I couldn't stop the laugh because wolves stopped aging at twenty-five, and he looked barely older than me.

""I know you do."" I settled back into my seat and sighed. ""I promise, what happened isn't going to make that feeling any better."" I wiped at my face. ""I don't even know why my mom is sending me to my dad. She just said that he could help me.""

""Well, let's hurry and get back so we can figure out what you need, Sugar."" My uncle hit the gas, and we ended up at the airport in no time.

We loaded my bags and headed up to the jet, settling in there. ""Close your eyes. You look like you barely slept today and we have a few hours."" My uncle patted my head before he sat across from me and opened his laptop.

""Work?""

""Work."" He nodded.

""This summer, can you teach me some stuff?"" A plan was forming in my mind, a plan not only to keep myself away from my pathetic mate, but one that would make me a lot of money.

""Of course, Sugar."" My uncle smiled up at me. ""You know, your dad would teach you just about everything he could if you were open to it.""

""I asked to move to your pack."" I snuggled into the blanket the flight attendant handed me, and Ronnie froze.

""What is going on?"" His eyes flashed.

""I'll explain later. Just promise you will try to believe me and not judge me.""

""Of course, Sugar."" He smiled and then turned back to the laptop on his lap. ""Now get some sleep.""

""Will do."" I turned away and fell asleep almost instantly.

I woke up to Ronnie shaking me. ""We are here.""

I gave an enormous yawn and cracked my jaw before wiping my eyes. ""Okay."" I handed off the blanket and wiped my face again. ""Thank you.""

""No problem, Princess."" The flight attendant smiled down at me, and I realized belatedly that she was from the pack too.

""You don't have to call me Princess.""

""You are the Alpha's daughter."" She bowed and then left us to our own devices.

""Come on, your dad has already linked me three times since landing."" Ronnie laughed and whisked me off to the waiting car. With in thirty minutes we were at our pack lands. ""You dad would allow you to move here if you wanted to, Sugar.""

""I know. But Alpha Dan won't allow me to leave..."" I looked over and blew out a breath. ""I think he assumes something I am running from and won't let me leave until he knows for sure.""

""You going to tell me yet, Sugar.""

I hesitated as we pulled up out front of the pack house. Before I could answer the door was ripped open and I was surrounded by powerful arms and a smell that made my quaking insides settle.

""Dad.""

""Hey my pup."" His deep voice calmed me further, and I could feel my eyes prickle.

""I've missed you."" I sniffled as he unbuckled my seat belt and I was in his arms fully.

""As I have missed you."" He kissed my temple. ""Now we have much to discuss."" He was running with me before I could utter another word, with Ronnie following behind.

""Slow down, jack ass. Some of us can't move that fast."" Ronnie struggled to keep up and my laughter filled the halls of the pack house. We settled in my father's office with an out of breath Ronnie, who was scowling. God, I missed these two.

""Tell me what's wrong, pup."" I looked around and still I stumbled over my words. My father grabbed my face and shook his head. ""Nothing you tell me will change anything, pup. I believe you, no matter how crazy it seems.""

""Agreed Sugar.""

My insides settled when I saw how resolute he was. He would believe my craziness. I could tell no matter how crazy my story was, my father and Ronnie would believe everything I said.

I never had to second guess if I was going crazy here.

So finally I settled fully and told my story.

Chapter Five

""I lived another life, and I died."" I stumbled over my words and I felt my father freeze. A quick look to Ronnie had him locking the door and waving his hands. I felt the air still, but I was focused on my father's eyes. ""This morning I woke up six years in the past after living until I was twenty-four, and growing my own pup only to have my mate to rip him from my body.""

My father's and Ronnie's snarl shook the walls, but I raised my hands. ""He betrays me for my step sister who convinced him that I cheated and the pup wasn't his, so he brought death to us both using silver scalpels, and burying any love I had for him at the same time."" I looked up at my father and the tears rolled down my face.

""Pup."" His voice was choked up, but I raised my hand.

""I don't want him to be my mate, daddy. I know I won't survive it. I need to change it. Everything, and it starts with hiding my scent. I told mom what I needed, and she called you. How are you going to help me?"" I was starting to panic. ""I don't want to die. I don't want my pup ripped from my stomach only for him to smell himself on him. I don't want to create life just to have it ripped from me daddy. I can't."" My soul was ripping and even though I want revenge, this was the first time I was given to truly grieve the lost of my pup.

""Sugar."" Ronnie's voice was barely a whisper and then I felt my father lose control.

""Who?"" His voice was pure darkness. His fist slammed into the desk, creaking the thick wood, and I looked up to find my father's wolf looking back at me. ""Who hurt you, my pup? Who did those my grand pup?"" Loki's voice was deeper than I had ever heard and his eyes promised retribution.

""Brandon, the alpha's son."" I whispered the final piece and everything seemed to click. The air rushed back in and my father's wolf shifted into his black form. I screamed and Ronnie dove in front of the door.

Loki snarled, but Ronnie held firm. ""You can't go for him for something that hasn't come to pass yet, Loki. You know how this works. You have been through it yourself."" But Loki just snarled.

""Daddy, please."" I begged. I knew if he got out, Brandon and Shannon were dead and the council would be on his doorstop. Loki whirled on me and softened at the devastation he saw on my face. He padded over and licked the tears from my face before going back behind the desk and shifting again.

""I'm sorry Amy, I lost myself for a moment."" He opened a door and slipped into some shorts. He wiped at his face before he sat back down. ""I guess its our turn to come clean.""

""Daddy?"" I sniffled and looked up at him.

""I'm not just a wolf, although, as you can see, Loki is very much a part of me."" His laughter was weak, but I just smiled. ""My mother was a shaman of our people, a witch, and my father had to have her. Even if it was just for a night. And I was born.""

""A witch?"" I dropped my hands, and he just had a small, sad smile.

""Yeah. You would have loved her, but witches don't live like us. They have the lifespan of a human, a flash in the pan. She was gone long before I met your mother."" He shook his head. ""One of her powers was exactly what you explained, a second chance. The moon goddess passed us down with the same powers. I had mine when I was your age as well.""

I jolted back as he nodded. ""What?""

""I never cheated on your mother."" His words were soft. ""I alpha commanded a wolf to pretend I did when she came to me and told me she was with pup. You see, in my first life, I stayed with her and we had three wonderful pups, but one night, my enemies attacked and the four of your were all murdered."" His swallow was thick.",1,1753443338.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

Here are few of my learnings: 

1. The earlier you start prepping for the launch the better, we did a little pre launch and got about 100 emails who we emailed on the day of launch along with our personal list. 
2. Just launching is not enough, you have to pair the launch with a not-able-to-miss offer, we hosted a lifetime deal and made use of the audience on the day of launch. 
3. The 24 hour cycle and coffee run is mandatory, if you’re planning to push your product in the top 5 and maintain there, you gotta be on the site, actively replying, pushing to as many forums as possible and be an all rounder till you get that # next to your products name. 

It’s absolutely worth it for early stage bootstrapped startups, you can validate and make some $$$ if done properly. 

After growing multiple startups from scratch, I’ve started my own growth partnership firm, where I along with my team will take a look at your product and onboard for a growth program where we’ll support on all aspects that’s needed for your growth right from pre-launch, aesthetics (website, product, UI/UX), launch, monetisation and retention with custom step-by-step growth roadmap.

Mine is almost over now but I've greatly enjoyed it. Not only is mine over soon, autumn will be here in just a few weeks time. All I can think about is my yearly rewatch of my favorite show, paired with a cup of coffee while the rain falls outside. This heat is way too much.

Now, until then, and until my inevitable social retreat into the woods, away from civilization, I'd really be thankful for some interesting company. I've got lots of friends, but not all of them *get* me in the same way, you know? Ever felt that? Obviously you won't be on the same page as everyone all the time, sure, but it's nice to spend time with someone where silence is never awkward.

* digging through the troves of vinyl records at second-hand places
* composing poetry nightly then throwing them away the very next morning
* reviewing films with mad fervor
* travelling, sharing travel stories and giving travel recommendations

My fists clench at my sides, nails biting into my palms as I stare, frozen, at the scene before me.

The room reeks of sweat and sex, I can’t help but tremble.

And there he is.

Dmitri.

My fiancé.

The man I was supposed to marry.

Groveling at my feet, tangled in his own damn pants as he fumbles to cover himself. His face is pale, his hair disheveled, his lips—those same lips that whispered loving words into my ears—swollen from kissing someone else.

A woman—a stranger—lays half-naked on the bed behind him, the silk sheets tangled around her body as she scrambles away like a cornered animal. Her eyes dart to mine in wide-eyed panic before she clutches the blanket to her chest and bolts toward the bathroom, slamming the door shut.

Coward.

Dmitri stares up at me, panic laced in his voice. ""Elena—it's not what it looks like.""

A hollow laugh escapes me. Cold. Emotionless. Clearly the laugh of a woman who has lost everything.

I take a step closer, my heels clicking against the polished hardwood floor. I feel detached from my own body, as if I'm watching this play out from somewhere far, far away.

""Not what it looks like?"" I repeat softly, tilting my head.

Dmitri, the man who once promised me forever, dares to feed me that cliché excuse.

A lump lodges in my throat, burning like acid.

""Dmitri,"" my voice is eerily calm, my hands trembling with suppressed rage, ""I just buried my father.""

His eyes flicker with guilt, but his lips part uselessly, searching for words.

""I came here because I—I needed you."" My voice cracks, raw with heartbreak. ""And I find you like this?""

I gesture to the bed—our bed—where another woman had just lain underneath him. The sheets I had picked out. The mattress we had chosen together. The room that was supposed to be ours.

Dmitri pushes to his feet, his pants still unbuttoned, his entire existence suddenly repulsive. He reaches for me. ""Please, I—""

""Don't touch me.""

My voice is sharper than I intend, but the thought of his hands on me now makes my skin crawl.

His face twists, desperation seeping into his features. ""It was a mistake! I wasn’t thinking—""

I scoff, my arms folding tightly over my chest. ""Oh? Your dick just happened to slip into her?""

Dmitri flinches. ""Elena—""

""Shut up.""

My breath is ragged. My vision blurs, but I refuse to cry. I refuse to break down in front of him.

I should be screaming. I should be throwing things, clawing at him, making him bleed the way he's just made me bleed. But I can't. I'm too numb.

Too shattered.

A part of me—a stupid, naive, pathetic part—wants him to fight for me.

To drop to his knees. To beg. To convince me that this isn’t real, that this is just some nightmare I’ll wake up from.

But I don't wake up.

I just stand there, breathing in the reality of it all.

""You said you loved me.""

Dmitri swallows hard. ""I do.""

My laugh is bitter. ""You have a funny way of showing it.""

Silence.

Maybe if this was the past me. Even the ‘me’ from yesterday, I would have screamed. I would have cursed him out. But now? I was already exhausted. Half my world had already shattered this morning.

So, instead, I inhale sharply and turn on my heel, my heart pounding against my ribs.

I need to leave.

Now.

""Elena, wait!"" Dmitri grabs my wrist, his grip desperate, but I rip myself free with such force that he stumbles back.

The love I had for him dies in that moment.

I don’t even look back as I walk away. Leaving our apartment. I walk in a daze, my mind completely lost to mourning my step-father, mourning the marriage life that I knew wouldn’t happen anymore.

My parent’s house is dark when I step inside.

The funeral was in the morning. It felt like a lifetime ago. And now, it’s night.

Everything feels different. Colder. Like the walls know what I’ve seen tonight, know that I am no longer the same woman who left this house earlier.

I swallow the lump in my throat and walk deeper inside, my heels clicking against the wooden floor.

""Mom?"" I call softly.

She must be sleeping. I had left her resting in her bedroom when I went to see Dmitri. God, I wish I hadn’t gone.

I wipe at my eyes, barely aware of the way my body shakes. The exhaustion crashes into me like a freight train.

One step. Then another.

I reach the kitchen, my fingers gripping the doorframe, ready to head upstairs—

Then I see her.

A choked gasp rips from my throat.

My mother.

She’s on the floor.

""Mom?"" My voice trembles.

She doesn’t move.

The room spins. My breath catches. No. No, no, no.

I stumble forward, collapsing onto my knees beside her. My hands shake violently as I reach for her, pressing my fingers to her neck, checking for breath, for warmth, for anything—

She’s burning.

Her skin is clammy, her forehead damp. And there—little red splotches marring her arm.

Burns.

What happened?

""Mom!"" I shake her. Hard. ""Mom, wake up! Please!""

She doesn’t stir.

The air leaves my lungs.

No. No. NO.

Please, God. Not her. Not her too.

My pulse roars in my ears, drowning everything else out as I grab my phone, my fingers fumbling, my vision blurring.

My heart slams against my ribs.

My throat tightens.

Tears blind me.

But there’s no time to panic.

I dial.

The ringing feels endless.

Then—

“911, what’s your emergency?”

I swallow a sob.

""My mother—she’s unconscious. Please. Please hurry.""

The operator starts talking, but I can barely hear.

I press my forehead to my mother’s, my body trembling.

“Stay with me,” I whisper. “Please, Mom. Stay with me.”

# Chapter 2

Elena’s POV:

The sterile white halls of the emergency ward felt like they were closing in on me, the scent of antiseptic and fear thick in the air.

My mother was wheeled in on a gurney, nurses shouting to each other in rushed, clipped voices as the emergency room doors swung open, then slammed shut, sealing her away from me.

I stood frozen in the hallway, my pulse a frantic drum against my ribs.

What do I do? What do I do?

My hands trembled as I pressed them to my face, trying to steady my breath, but it was impossible. She was fine this morning. Weak, but alive. And now she was in there, fighting for her life.

A nurse approached, her expression gentle. ""Miss Kovalyova?""

I turned, my throat too tight to respond.

""The doctor will speak with you shortly.""

I nodded numbly, my nails digging into my palms.

Minutes stretched into eternity. I had no idea how long I stood there, my body tense and aching.

Then the doors swung open again, and a doctor stepped out, his face strained.

I rushed forward. “Is she okay?”

The doctor exhaled. ""Your mother suffered a severe cardiac episode due to prolonged stress and underlying conditions. We need to perform an emergency bypass surgery to prevent further damage.""

My breath caught. ""Okay,"" I said, too quickly. ""Then do it.""

His face hardened. ""The procedure costs fifty eight thousand dollars here.""

The number hit me like a punch to the gut.

A sharp ringing filled my ears as my mind tried to process it. Fifty thousand dollars?!

I didn't have that kind of money.

Hell, I barely had enough to cover next month’s rent. We were already in deep shit with our previous debt.

""You'll need to secure the payment within the next twenty-four hours so we can proceed,"" the doctor continued, oblivious to the way my world was crumbling beneath my feet.

""Twenty-four hours?"" My voice came out hollow.

""Yes. If we delay any longer, her condition may worsen beyond what surgery can fix.""

I stared at him. Twenty-four hours. Fifty eight thousand dollars.

""Do you have insurance?"" the doctor asked, his voice impassive, like this was just another conversation for him.

""No."" My voice broke on the word.

""Family who can assist?""

I wanted to laugh. What family?

He sighed, pushing his glasses up his nose. ""I suggest you find a solution quickly. We will keep her stable for now, but time is of the essence."" With that, he nodded and disappeared down the hallway, leaving me standing in the wreckage of my life.

I stumbled backward onto one of the plastic chairs in the waiting area, my vision swimming.

I was alone.

There was no one I could call, no one I could ask.

And for one horrifying second, my mind drifted to Dmitri.

Dmitri Vetrov. My ex-fiancé.

Rich. Powerful. The youngest son of a multimillionaire. He could write a check for fifty thousand dollars without blinking.

Would he help me?

My stomach curled in disgust at the thought.

I could see it now. His smug, self-satisfied smirk. The condescending tilt of his head as he crossed his arms and leaned back, acting as if I owed him something for his generosity after how I had left him begging on his knees just a while ago.

No.

If my mother found out I had lowered myself to begging my cheating ex for money, she wouldn’t accept it. She would rather die than have me throw away my dignity for her.

And I wasn’t sure I could survive begging Dmitri either.

Then who?

My nails dug into my knees, my breath coming in short gasps. What do I do? What do I do?

And then—

A familiar name echoed from a nearby television.

I lifted my head.

The hospital’s mounted TV was tuned into a business channel, the news anchor’s voice crisp and professional.

“—Vetrov Enterprises, owned by billionaire Nikolai Vetrov, announced a record-breaking deal today—”

Nikolai Vetrov.

The camera shifted to a man in his mid-thirties, dressed in a sharp black suit, his jawline like it was carved from stone. His dark brown hair gelled back to perfection.

His cold, calculating dark eyes scanned the reporters, his smile hiding something dangerous.

The most eligible bachelor in the whole of Alderidge.

Nikolai Vetrov.

Dmitri’s older stepbrother.

And the man who hated Dmitri with every fiber of his being.

The memory surfaced before I could stop it.

Dmitri’s twenty-fifth birthday. Six months ago.

A lavish party was held in a massive ballroom, filled with people who definitely didn’t belong in my world. I was from a lower class family, attending college with a scholarship.

However, I had become Dmitri’s girlfriend and after four years, for the first time he had invited me to such an occasion. Introducing me to others like I was a trophy. I had actually been extremely happy that day.

Because that was also the day Dmitri had proposed to me.

I had just left the restroom, smoothing out my dress, when I nearly collided with Nikolai Vetrov.

He had been leaning against the hallway wall, one hand in his pocket, a cigarette between his fingers. His onyx brown eyes swept over me, slow and deliberate.

Then he exhaled, releasing a cloud of smoke. ""My condolences.""

I frowned. ""Excuse me?""

""Your mind is sharp,"" he murmured, voice low, slightly slurred from alcohol. ""But your taste in men is absolutely tragic.""

I had been dumbfounded.

Like, who says that about their own brother?

It was the first time I truly realized Nikolai didn’t just dislike Dmitri like a lot of siblings do. He despised him.

""You have such a smart little mind,"" he mused, ""but it’s wasted on a man like him.""

I scoffed. ""And what makes you say that?""

Nikolai took another drag from his cigarette, exhaling slowly as he looked out into the city through the massive floor to ceiling windows in front of us.

""He isn’t exactly husband material.""

I let out a sharp laugh. ""Oh? And what do you think makes a man husband material?"" It had truly been funny to me, that a ‘man’ was telling me what ‘husband material’ was supposed to be.

But I didn’t defend Dmitri, I noticed the venom in Nikolai’s tone and knew it would be useless. I didn’t want to pick a fight with someone like him either.

His gaze darkened, piercing straight into my soul.

""He sucks at cooking.""

My brows lifted. ""Seriously?""

""You laugh, but a man who can’t even take care of himself can’t take care of you either.""

I rolled my eyes. ""It’s fine. I can cook and I’m used to taking care of myself.""

Nikolai’s lips curved into a slow, knowing smirk.

""He’s shit with money. Spends it like water.""

""He’s rich. Why does it matter?""

His gaze sharpened. ""Are you marrying him for money, then?""

I met his stare and tilted my head. ""What if I am?"" Of course I wasn’t. I hadn’t taken a dime from Dmitri. Not that I was against being treated like a princess. I was just not used to being indebted to anyone like this, it made my skin itch.

However, instead of getting offended, Nikolai looked… satisfied. He straightened, flicking ash from his cigarette.

""Good,"" he said.

I frowned. That’s it?

He studied me for a long moment, then murmured, ""I’m richer than him, you know.""

I blinked.

""What does that have to do with me?""

Nikolai shrugged. Then he walked away.

Only later on had I realized what he meant when he had said the last line, but I had tossed it to the back of my mind and assumed he was testing me for his little brother.

That memory burned in my mind as I stared at his face on the TV screen.

Nikolai Vetrov was richer than Dmitri.

More powerful. More ruthless. And he hated his stepbrother.

I sucked in a sharp breath.

An idea began to take shape—insane, desperate, but my only option.

I needed money.

I wanted power.

And there was a man who had both.

I needed Nikolai Vetrov.

# Chapter 3

Elena’s POV:

If I was wrong about Nikolai Vetrov’s intentions, the worst that could happen was that I would embarrass myself. That was nothing compared to what was at stake. But if I didn’t do anything—if I didn’t at least try to ask for his help—and my mother’s condition worsened, or worse…

I knew I would regret it for the rest of my life.

I exhaled sharply, forcing my shaky legs to push me upright.

That’s it then.

I had made my choice.

Pulling out my phone, I searched for the address of Vetrov Enterprises. I had been there once or twice before, back when Dmitri would take me out for lunch at one of the high-end restaurants near his brother’s office. But I didn’t remember the exact address.

At least I knew Nikolai wasn’t out of the country.

I glanced down at my outfit—a simple black dress, the same one I had worn earlier at my dad’s funeral. My hair was still tied into a low bun, strands falling loose from hours of exhaustion.

I looked like a grieving woman.

Which, in many ways, I was.

I was mourning the death of my father, the life I thought I would have, the man I thought loved me and the security I had believed in.

Now, I had nothing.

Except for this one insane, desperate plan.

— 30 minutes later —

The towering glass building of Vetrov Enterprises loomed before me, its sharp edges piercing the dawn sky.

The city was still asleep, the streets nearly deserted, but this place—this empire Nikolai built with his own hands—was already awake at four o'clock in the morning.

A few luxury cars lined the private parking area, their sleek exteriors gleaming under the streetlights.

I inhaled deeply, steeling myself.

I knew I probably wouldn’t be able to see him right away. CEOs don’t stroll into work at four in the morning. But I had no choice. I would leave my number with the receptionist and pray that Nikolai would agree to meet me.

There was no way I could ask Dmitri for his brother’s number.

Not when I was about to do this.

I pushed through the heavy glass doors and stepped into the lobby.

The receptionist at the front desk—a well-dressed woman in her late twenties— looked up from her computer screen, her eyes widening in surprise when she saw me.

“Are you Miss Elena?”

I frowned. “You know me?”

She hesitated, then nodded. “Ah, yes. Sir told me to send you up.”

My heart stopped.

What?

I stared at her, my pulse hammering in my ears. Had he… anticipated my arrival?

No. That wasn’t possible.

How would he know?

My hands curled into fists, my heartbeat racing.

The receptionist smiled and handed me a key card. “Take the elevator to the twenty-seventh floor. He’s expecting you.”

I nodded slowly, forcing myself to act normal as I took the card and walked toward the elevator.

My mind was spiraling.

Was this just a coincidence? Had he expected me to come?

Or… had he known all along that this day would come? No…that didn’t make sense. How would he know that I needed money for my mother’s bypass in advance?

There was another more plausible reason that swirled in my mind…was he somehow stalking me?

I swallowed hard, shaking off the thought as I stepped into the empty elevator.

That was ridiculous though. Why would someone like him have a need to do that?

The moment the doors slid shut, I let out a shaky breath and pressed my back against the cold metal wall.

Calm down. Keep it together.

I tapped the key card against the panel. The elevator hummed to life, carrying me higher and higher.

Maybe it was just my imagination or nervousness but the air felt thinner the closer I got.

Twenty-fifth floor.

Twenty-sixth.

Twenty-seventh.

A soft chime echoed, and the doors glided open.

There was only one office here.

A massive, double-door entrance at the end of the dimly lit hallway.

And sitting just outside it, a man—his posture straight as he typed away at his laptop. Nikolai’s secretary?

As soon as he saw me, he stood up and gestured toward the doors.

“Sir is waiting for you, Miss Kovalyova.” He smiled and moved to open the door for me.

I nodded, thanking him as I stepped inside, my gaze immediately landing on the man behind the desk.

Nikolai Vetrov sat in his massive leather chair, flipping through a file as if he hadn’t just called me here before I even made the decision to come.

His dark eyes flicked up from his papers, locking onto me.

The man was unfairly attractive.

He looked unbothered, composed. His expensive suit was perfectly fitted, the top button of his shirt undone, revealing a glimpse of tattoos peeking from his collar.

The picture-perfect CEO.

And I was standing frozen in front of him.

“Good morning,” he said smoothly, his voice deep.

The last time we had talked, I had drank alcohol so it hadn’t felt like this, and before that, the couple of times we ran into each other we hadn’t conversed at all.

I took a breath, forcing down my nerves. “Morning.”

“Have a seat.”

I did, trying to keep my posture straight and confident despite the storm raging inside me.

“Tea or coffee?” he asked.

“Neither. I’m fine.”

Nikolai frowned slightly before picking up the telecom. “Send in a pumpkin spice latte.”

My body went rigid.

How… did he know my favorite drink?

He leaned back, watching me with something close to amusement. ""Don't think too much. Dmitri talks a lot about you.""

My stomach tightened.

Hearing my ex-fiancé’s name out loud felt like a punch to the ribs. But I refused to show it.

Instead, I kept my gaze trained on Nikolai. “You know what he did, don’t you?”

He smirked.

""I warned you, didn't I? He isn't husband material.""

I clenched my fists ignoring his remark for now. “Why do you hate Dmitri?”

His smirk didn’t fade. ""Hate? No, I don't hate him. But I dislike him.""

I narrowed my eyes.

""He's spoiled. Daddy’s little treasure. He’s never suffered a day in his life. Never had to fight for anything. He thinks with his head, but not the one on his shoulders.""

Nikolai motioned toward his crotch.

I bit down on my tongue, feeling the urge to refute him.

But could I?

I had seen it with my own two eyes.

Dmitri was exactly what Nikolai described.

""After all,"" Nikolai continued, ""if he had any brains, he wouldn’t have fumbled someone like you.""

A sharp, hot sensation crawled up my spine.

This was it. This was my opening.

I lifted my chin. ""I have an offer for you.""

His eyes flickered with interest.

""Marry me. Give me enough money to save my mother. In return, I’ll give you a wife on paper. And a way to make your little brother a laughing stock.""

For the first time, Nikolai froze.

I watched as he leaned back, studying me. Then, his lips curled.

""You're pretty straightforward. I expected you to take more time to come around.""

My fingers dug into my lap. “I don’t have time for that. My mother needs emergency Bypass surgery. Are you willing to help me or not?”

I was probably glaring at him now.

A moment of silence stretched between us.

Then—

""If I say no… will you go back and ask Dmitri for money?""

A wry smile spread across my face.

“He isn’t the only member of the Vetrov family I can go to, you know,” I said, my voice laced with something dangerous. “After all, I know Daddy Vetrov has certain tendencies toward girls half his age.”

I was pushing my limits.

But I had a hunch.

A dangerous, reckless hunch.

That Nikolai Vetrov was interested in me.

# Chapter 4

Elena’s POV:

As expected, Nikolai Vetrov went rigid.

His sharp, composed expression didn’t falter, but something in his posture shifted. His dark eyes locked onto mine, piercing, calculating—assessing me.

Then, he stood up. Slowly.

“You really are something, you know that?” His voice was smooth, almost amused, but there was an underlying challenge in his tone.

“Fine then.” He leaned against his desk, arms crossed. “But tell me, Elena—what else are you willing to give? Because making Dmitri a laughingstock? That’s not difficult for me.”

He smirked. “I could do that without marrying you.”

He was right. He truly didn’t need me for that.

But I needed him.",1,1753442732.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

im 16 and have been a lil bit fucked in the ass by morminsm and for the last year and a half i have been trying to abandon the church i have since become athiest (and happy) but my family is VERY MORMON.(my mom is the young womens leader)

both sides of my family are like crazy mormon and are all quite delusional. i have stopped going to church and am treated sub human most the time. i get critisized for drinking coffee even though i drank energy drinks long before, and anytime i do something thats normal everyone just takes it way too far. not to long ago my parents called the cops on me for having a little bit of weed and they just told me that they know everything because god is on they're side. (trust me he's definitly not)

sometimes i'll be playing game with my friends online ill say ""oh my god"" or ""oh my lord"" because in my eyes that's better than screaming the fuck word or the shit word. but i guess not because occasionally my mom will sit by the door to my room that has the computer and WAIT for me to cuss so she can come in and bitch me out for it. 

and that is totally understandble i gues for whenever i say stuff like fuck or shit or any other fucked shit ill say on the internet, especially if my younger brother is in the room. But occasionally ill say ""oh my god"" and my mom will bust open the door and yell at me for ""taking the lords name in vien"" and every single godamn time i use ""the lords name in vien"" i'll get bitched out no matter if im in public or hanging out with my friends or HAVING A PRIVATE TEXT MESSAGE WITH MY FRIENDS. 

any time i do shit they dont like they get all pissy about ""respect"" like one time i had to go to church for something and they yelled at me for having my airpods in during the sacrement meeting and anytime im at a family gather people allways give me wierd looks when i dont bow my head get on my knees and suck off the holy ghost during prayers.

i dont think they understand the just because im not religous doesn't mean they cant respect my belifes to i just need a way to tell them i dont belive in god without starting some bs argument.",2,1753442683.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False

1m8wjs9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m8wjs9,August Shower Box Spoilers,"So for the first time ever my kitchen box has arrived early, so I'd thought I'd share my thoughts. 
I love the yuzu and cocoa sorbet, makes my skin so soft and smells incredible, it reminds me of almost a sun cream scent in the best way. Although it should be noted it needs to be stored in the fridge and is not self preserving, so initially it was quite watery, it might thicken up once cooled. 
The frozen custard doesn't smell just like yummy custard but it definitely has that vanilla gourmand smell to it. 
The cookie dough body scrub isn't like the other body scrubs that have came in the last few boxes, it's a lot harder and a different texture. The scent to me almost has a coffee smell vs a cookie vanilla smell 
The creamsicle shower gel smells just like you would expect, I love it, has that orange scent but with a creamier more soothing scent vs a sharpness. 
The noubar is the only thing in this box I dislike. It is very very strong, before I even opened the box I could smell it and I'm not keen. It reminds me of of the bamboo soap from a few boxes ago, it is also extremely soft, so I would imagine in hotter countries it will suffer with melting. The brown blobs in it does not help its appearance. ",36,1753442599.0,LushCosmetics,5,1.0,False
1m8wjm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1m8wjm1/she_stuns_the_world_summary_review_and_reading/,"She Stuns the World: Summary, Review and Reading Link Available","Late at night in a dimly lit bar, a wealthy young man clad in designer threads slid a document across the table to Athena Donovan.

""I'm engaged to the Kennedy's daughter. You're not their flesh and blood, so I need you to sign off on ending our engagement,"" he stated matter-of-factly.

""But hey, we could still mess around, right?"" he added, his voice dripping with nonchalance.

Athena, dressed in a light blue linen dress, sat opposite him. Her long black hair fell over her shoulders, her skin porcelain-smooth, and her eyes gleamed with a quiet fire.

As she watched him flaunt his riches, she couldn't help but think, 'Is this guy for real?'

He pushed another document her way along with a key card and car keys. ""This is for a property transfer. Live in the apartment for five years, and it's yours. Oh, and that brand-new Maserati downstairs? It's yours too if you sign these.""

Athena chuckled softly and then did the math. 'Five years as his side piece for a 600-grand apartment and a sports car worth 400 grand? That's barely 200 grand a yearâ€”less than 20 thousand dollars a month. And he expects gratitude for his 'generosity'?'

Her gaze unnerved him. He grabbed a wine glass, sipping a 2,000-dollar mouthful of wine, before continuing. ""Look, I get it, you're a proud woman. Signing this might sting a bit.""

""But let's be realâ€”your folks are broke. Five brothers, all cramped in some tiny house in the old quarter,"" he pressed. ""Trust me, you wouldn't last a day in their shoes. Take the flat and the car. You're gonna need them.""

Athena shot him a brief, scornful smirk, then leaned in to swiftly sign the documents.

Lucas Harper's grandiose promises, made during their courtship, now seemed laughable and vile, especially after his rush to call off their engagement upon learning she wasn't a true Kennedy.

Sickened by his charade, Athena was ready to bolt after just a short while.

Caught by her smile, Lucas leaned in, his face alight with desperation. ""Athena, I really give a damn about you. I can set you up for life if you just stick with me,"" he said, his voice thick with passion as he licked his dry lips.

""If you wanna have kids, I can look after them too. But they won't carry the Harper name,"" he added, clearly lost in his delusions.

Athena finished signing, tucked a copy into her bag, and stood. ""Mr. Harper, thanks for calling off the engagement. Goodbye,"" she said, turning to leave.

Lucas froze, then snapped back to reality as she started to walk away. ""Athena, you better learn your damn place!"" he yelled, rushing over and grabbing her arm.

""I'm the heir to the richest family in Kitmore City, not to mention handsome, generous, and a top grad from an elite foreign school. I've had women throwing themselves at me since I was a kid,"" Lucas boasted arrogantly. ""You should be grateful I'm even considering keeping you, you gold-digging impostor! If you walk out now, you'll regret it!""

Athena struggled briefly, then swiftly broke free. She flipped him off and spat at him before striding away.

Lucas clenched his fists, trembling with rage. ""Stop her!"" he bellowed.

Lucas had been pursuing Athena for three years but had never even held her hand.

'I can't just let her slip away,' he thought desperately. 'I need to spend one night with her, get it on tape, and show I'm still the most eligible bachelor in Kitmore City.'

His entourage, keen to impress, quickly blocked Athena's way, smirking. ""Athena, Mr. Harper has bent over backward for you. How can you be so cold and just leave?"" one sneered.

""If you're ditching him, at least throw the guy a bone. Show some damn appreciation for all he's done,"" another piped up.

Athena kept her cool, then glanced over their shoulders with a smirk. ""Matthew, you made it!""

# 2. Chapter 2

Hearing the name, Lucas and his cronies turned in shock.

Rumors had been flying that Matthew Graham, heir to the Graham family, had sneaked into Kitmore City. Every big shot in town, including their families, was scrambling for an intro.

But when they spun around, there was no sign of Matthewâ€”just the usual crowd. The elusive Matthew seemed nowhere in sight.

Lucas whipped back around to Athena. ""Where's Matthew Graham? Are you lying..."" he started, but trailed off as he realized Athena had used their distraction to slip away.

""Go! Downstairs, now! We've got to catch her!"" he ordered his group.

They muscled through the crowd and sprinted to the elevator, hitting the building's lobby in seconds, only to see Athena's modest black car pulling away.

""Athena, you can't run from me!"" Lucas screamed, chasing after her. He was left coughing in a cloud of dust as her car tore down the street. Furious, he wiped his face and glared at the fading taillights.

""After her!"" he roared between coughs before jumping into his Maserati to give chase.

Half an hour later, Lucas was still desperately combing the streets for Athena.

Meanwhile, Athena had already arrived back at the Kennedy family villa. After parking her car, she made a call. ""Blacklist the Harper family immediately,"" she instructed coldly.

""No invitations to any Vission Group events, no sales of Vission Group products, and bar them from entering any Vission Group properties."" With that, she ended the call and calmly walked through the villa's front door.

When Athena finally arrived, it was twelve minutes past midnight. Despite the Kennedys' reputation for living a healthy, disciplined lifestyle, the grand crystal chandelier was still casting a bright light across the living room.

As she stepped inside, she spotted Isaac Kennedy lounging on the large leather sofa, dressed in silk pajamas. His eyes were closed, seemingly at rest, and a stack of documents lay on the coffee table in front of him.

It was clear he'd been waiting for her. The moment he heard the door, he opened his eyes and asked with a concerned look, ""Athena Donovan, why are you back so late? Did something happen?""

Athena, wearing a polite smile, pretended not to notice his formal tone. ""Nothing too serious. I just signed the breakup agreement with Lucas. It's officialâ€”we're done.""

Isaac rarely called her by her full name, which made Athena wonder if he was subtly reminding her of her place in the family.

At her words, Isaac visibly relaxed, a slight smile curling at the corner of his mouth before he quickly composed himself again. ""Are you upset with us for not stepping in to save your engagement?""

""No,"" Athena replied sincerely, shaking her head slightly. ""I never had feelings for Lucas. If you hadn't forced me into this engagement a month ago, I wouldn't have even considered him.""

Back then, her grandmother had been critically ill, requiring a nearly impossible surgery. Since Athena was still a minor, she couldn't legally sign the consent forms. The Kennedys had taken advantage of the situation, using their signature as leverage to force her into the engagement.

Athena could've arranged the surgery secretly, but she hadn't seen the point in going through all the trouble. She knew she could end things with Lucas anytime, so she went along with the engagement without a fuss.

Isaac looked uncomfortable as he addressed the matter. After clearing his throat awkwardly, he said, ""I'm glad you don't hold it against us.""

""Please, have a seat. There's something we need to discuss,"" he added, motioning to the chair next to him.

# 3. Chapter 3

Athena sat gracefully on the edge of the sofa, her posture upright and poised, hands neatly folded in her lap.

Isaac said slowly, ""You'll be meeting your biological parents tomorrow. I've arranged for a driver to take you there, and there are gifts prepared for them.

""It's been years since you've seen your family, so make sure to spend time with them, get settled. Don't worry about anything here.""

Athena nodded, understanding. ""Thank you.""

Isaac gestured to the property transfer agreement lying on the coffee table. ""This house is a farewell gift from your mother and me. It's not brand new, but it's been kept up well and fully furnished. I hope it'll be suitable for you.""

Athena had already glanced over the agreement. The house was her childhood home, a small, worn-down apartment barely fit for living.

The Kennedys had held onto it, hoping for a payout from demolition or as a place for elderly relatives. Now, they were offering it to her as a symbolic gesture since neither of those plans had panned out.

She smiled politely. ""Thank you, Dad. But please keep the house for now. I'll let you know if I need it.""

A flicker of displeasure crossed Isaac's face, and his tone cooled. ""Fine. If you ever change your mind, just call Elias. He'll handle everything right away.""

Athena nodded again to show she understood.

After a brief pause, Isaac continued, ""Tomorrow's gonna be busy. I've asked Mia to pack your things. Get some rest tonight, and leave early tomorrow so you don't keep your parents waiting.""

Athena wasn't sure if her biological parents were as eager as the Kennedys to see her go, but she could tell Isaac and his wife certainly were.

Standing up, she said politely, ""Thank you, Dad. I'll go get some rest.""

Her gentle demeanor and compliance seemed to please Isaac. He sighed, feigning regret. ""Athena, you're a good girl. If my long-lost son didn't already have a girlfriend, I would've loved to see you as my daughter-in-law.""

Athena fought back the urge to thank him for sparing her from that fate. Remembering that Isaac hadn't been entirely unkind over the years, she offered a simple goodnight and made her way upstairs.

Isaac watched her go, a mixture of guilt and reluctance in his gaze. He was surprised by how obedient she remained, even as she was about to leave.

He hoped to wrap up this matter quickly so his real children could finally move in. With that thought, he put the papers away, turned off the lights, and headed upstairs.

In the master bedroom, Regina Kennedy paced nervously in her luxurious silk robe. When Isaac walked in, she immediately asked, ""So, what did Athena say?""

""She didn't make a fuss,"" Isaac replied, brushing it off. ""She turned down the house, said she'd ask for it if she ever needed it.""

Regina was taken aback. ""That old house might be a bit rundown, but it's still worth something. I think she just thinks it's beneath her. How greedy!""

Isaac frowned. ""I don't think Athena's like that.""

Regina shot him a sharp look. ""We're living in a villa worth over 60 million dollars. You think she's gonna settle for a house that's barely worth 200 grand?""

She then raised her hand, showing off her diamond ring. ""Do you know where I found this Vission diamond ring?""

""No,"" Isaac said with a sigh of relief. ""But thank God you found it. That would've been a hell of a loss.""

""Mia found it stuffed in Athena's clothes while packing,"" Regina said coldly. ""We always kept this ring locked up in our room. And guess who took it? Athena. That ungrateful little thief.""

""I bet she's just waiting for an excuse to squeeze more out of us in the future,"" Regina continued with a hard edge in her voice. ""We need to protect what's oursâ€”for our own kids. We can't give her another damn thing.""

# 4. Chapter 4

Isaac shook his head, disappointment clear in his eyes. ""Was all that obedient, considerate behavior just a damn act?""

""Absolutely,"" Regina scoffed, her expression twisted with disdain. The affection she once had for the girl she called her daughter had long since vanished.

She added, ""When Zoe was here two days ago, she couldn't stop admiring this diamond ring. I was planning to give it to her once she and Andrew got engaged. Who would've guessed Athena would swipe it right from under our noses?""

""Maybe you didn't know, but Zoe and Athena went to school togetherâ€”from elementary all the way to high school. Zoe told me Athena was popular with the boys, and they used to shower her with expensive gifts. She never hesitated to accept themâ€”""

""Let's not dig into this."" Isaac cut her off, unwilling to tarnish the memory of the girl they had once cherished.

""She's leaving soon. We raised her; we should just let it go,"" Isaac said, trying to push past the bitterness.

""I'm warning you,"" Regina said sternly. ""Don't give her a damn cent. Poor people are like bottomless pits. The moment they get a taste of easy money, they'll keep coming back for more. We can't let that happen.""

Isaac nodded. ""Don't worry. I'll keep it cordial, but she won't see a dime from me.""

As the couple schemed to keep Athena away, she stood in her almost empty room, staring at her packed luggage, nearly laughing.

Five suitcases were stacked by the doorâ€”two filled with clothes, one with shoes, another with bags, and the last one with skincare products and jewelry, none of it worth more than five figures. All the really expensive stuff was gone, but she didn't care.

She grabbed a few clothes and her tablet, packing them into a smaller bag. Scribbling a note, she read it aloud to herself, ""I'm gone. Don't worry, and don't miss me!"" She placed the note on her desk and quietly slipped out of the room.

Athena left behind everything the Kennedy family had ever given her. As she made her way through the dark, empty living room, she placed her keys and house card on the cabinet by the door.

Without a second glance, she stepped outside and headed toward her modest black carâ€”the one she bought with her own money, not a penny from the Kennedys.

Once inside the car, Athena pulled out her phone and dialed a number. When the call connected, she said, ""As of now, cancel all contracts with the Kennedy Group.""

There was a moment of stunned silence before the phone erupted with excited cheers. ""Finally! You're done being their doormat!""

Athena chuckled softly. ""I'm sorry for the trouble I caused. But starting today, I'm officially out of that family. They're no longer our problem.""

# 5. Chapter 5

Laughter rang out on the other end of the line. ""Everyone's here! Come celebrate with us!""

The sound of laughter and cheers poured through the phone, flooding Athena's ears.

The noise grew louder. ""Hell yeah! Congrats on making the right call and cutting ties with the Kennedy Group! First thing tomorrow, I'll contact them and terminate all their partnerships with Vission Group.""

""Even if they come begging, we're not backing down,"" they added, their excitement clear.

Athena grimaced at the noise, rubbing her temples. ""I'm driving. Let's talk later,"" she said, putting the car in gear.

She had no idea that, across the street from the villa, an SUV was parked under the trees, lying in wait like a predator, silently watching her every move. It was Matthew.

Moments after she drove off, Matthew in the SUV issued a curt order. ""Follow that car. Keep out of sight.""

""Yes, sir,"" his secretary Louis Connor replied, smoothly tailing Athena's car from a safe distance, confident she wouldn't notice.

After a while, curiosity got the better of Louis. He glanced into the rearview mirror and asked, ""Mr. Graham, you came back home and flew all the way to Kitmore City. I remember your goal is to meet Isaac in person and check out how he snagged Vission Group's exclusive West End distribution rights.

""But as soon as that girl showed up, you switched your focus to her. Are you interested in her?""

Inwardly, he mused, 'If Mr. Graham ever showed interest in a womanâ€”hell, whether she's eighteen or thirty-eightâ€”I'd be so damn grateful. I'd probably sing hallelujahs.'

Matthew stayed silent, arms crossed, eyes closed, completely unfazed by the question.

But Louis, persistent as ever, couldn't let it go. ""She used to be the Kennedy family's golden girl. Now, she's changed her name to Athena Donovan. Two weeks ago, she took the SAT; last week she found out she wasn't Isaac's biological daughter, and today, she's supposed to meet her real family.

""From what I've heard, she's well-behaved, educated, and pretty low-key. Other than being drop-dead gorgeous and a top student, there's nothing else that stands out. So, why the sudden interest?""

Matthew remained silent, only fueling Louis's curiosity.

He said, ""I don't mean to be nosy, but the Kennedy Group's exclusive distribution deal with Vission Group is about to expire.

""If we don't lock it down now, we'll have to wait another three years. And we can't delay Lucy's treatment any longer. We need to find Dr. Annie through the Kennedys.""

Finally, Matthew spoke, his voice cold. ""You've been with me for years, and you still don't see what makes her different?""

Louis blinked in surprise, taking a moment to realize Matthew was talking about Athena. He replayed her actions in his mind, trying to figure out what might make her stand out. Despite his best efforts, he couldn't pinpoint anything and had to admit defeat.

""Besides her looks, I don't see anything special. Please, enlighten me,"" Louis said, a hint of curiosity creeping into his voice.",1,1753442582.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

Commentary by **Jake Kwon** and [**Benjamin Jensen**](https://www.csis.org/people/benjamin-jensen)

Published July 24, 2025

Next Army *is a collaborative series by* [*CSIS Futures Lab*](https://www.csis.org/programs/futures-lab) *and the* [*Modern War Institute*](https://mwi.westpoint.edu/) *launched in honor of the U.S. Army’s 250th birthday and the* [*Army Transformation Initiative*](https://www.army.mil/article/285100/letter_to_the_force_army_transformation_initiative) *(ATI). The commentaries explore how emerging technologies, organizational reforms, and major shifts in the strategic environment will shape the force of 2040 and beyond.*

In the future, the United States will maintain a deep stockpile of rare earth minerals that support a ground force with larger numbers of unmanned systems and data links spread across the forward line of troops. In competition, swarms will pulse in and out of theaters, keeping adversaries off balance, denying benefits, and encouraging restraint. Deterrence will be a function not just of the lethality of this human-machine force but “combat power in being” and how adversaries assess the ability of the U.S. Army and other services to scale combat power.

The United States’ ability to deter China depends on [critical minerals](https://www.csis.org/programs/critical-minerals-security-program) most Americans have never heard of. These materials have increasingly been recognized as a key economic lever of power for the United States and China. Rare earth elements are not only indispensable components of U.S. economic strength, but also of the United States’ security infrastructure. Found in everything from smartphones and laptops, they also power complex systems such as precision-guided munitions, stealth technology, and training AI models. Rare earth elements form the backbone of [modern defense capabilities](https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2014/3078/pdf/fs2014-3078.pdf).

As China controls [90 percent](https://www.newsweek.com/map-countries-largest-rare-earth-reserves-china-greenland-ukraine-2040424) of rare earth element processing, the United States is at an inflection point. To maintain credible deterrence against China and defend against Beijing’s ability to weaponize global defense supply chains, the United States should act quickly and reestablish a robust strategic rare earth element reserve.

From 1939 to the 1980s (prior to World War II through the end of the Cold War), the United States maintained stockpiles of rare earth elements to create a buffer against shortages and allow for uninterrupted defense production through the [Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:50%20section:98%20edition:prelim)). With the relative global calm following the Cold War, the United States sold off its stockpiles, accepting the theory that global supply chains would support rapid scaling in times of conflict. However, the Covid-19 pandemic starkly illuminated a U.S. vulnerability, [exposing critical supply chain disruptions](https://www.businessdefense.gov/docs/ndis/2023-NDIS.pdf) that severely impacted the United States’ ability to procure necessary materials in a timely manner.

The idea of a strategic stockpile isn’t new. The United States already maintains the [Strategic Petroleum Reserve](https://www.energy.gov/ceser/strategic-petroleum-reserve), established in the aftermath of the [1973 oil embargo](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1969-1976/oil-embargo), to safeguard against severe energy disruptions. It serves as an emergency buffer to stabilize markets and protect the country from the economic shocks that tend to follow geopolitical crises. The Department of Defense has consistently identified rare earth elements and critical minerals as essential to virtually every major weapons system, from fighter jets to precision-guided munitions.

A robust reserve of rare earth elements is necessary to support a policy of global deterrence, as it would signal to adversaries that economic coercion through supply chain disruption cannot prevent the United States from scaling up the defense industrial base production during a crisis. Reliance on foreign suppliers, particularly China, exposes the United States and its allies to strategic vulnerabilities. Recent history provides precedent to underscore the risk.

In 2010, China [suspended](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/10/japan-rare-earth-minerals/) its exports of rare earth elements to Japan. During a period of increased diplomatic tensions, this caused immediate disruptions in Japan’s high-tech and automotive industries. This coercive maneuver highlighted how quickly [economic security can be compromised](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/business/global/23rare.html) in an age of global supply chains. Drawing a parallel to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a similar initiative for rare earth elements would demonstrate to potential adversaries that the United States possesses the strategic depth to sustain prolonged conflict, thereby reducing the likelihood that those adversaries would initiate hostilities in the first place.

China’s near monopoly on global rare earth element processing places the United States and its allies in a precarious strategic position. Previously, the United States [stockpiled](https://www.hsdl.org/c/view?docid=456593) up to five years of strategic materials to account for a protracted conflict and mitigate unforeseen contingencies. The stockpile also provided options to establish alternative supply routes and stand-up domestic production. Returning to a robust strategic rare earth element reserve would enhance U.S. standing in global negotiations, affirming the United States’ readiness and self-sufficiency, thereby deterring potential adversaries from utilizing resource manipulation as leverage.

Establishing such a reserve raises concerns over cost and environmental impact. While the Strategic Petroleum Reserve required billions over decades, a rare earth reserve should cost substantially less, given the smaller quantities needed while providing outsized strategic value. Critics argue investments should target supply chain diversification or alternative technologies instead. These long-term strategies have merit but cannot address immediate threats, and technological shifts away from rare earth dependency remain speculative. As for environmental impact, the United States must pursue responsible domestic production rather than perpetuate its dangerous dependence on China. Modern extraction technologies can minimize environmental costs while eliminating the far greater risks of economic coercion and military conflict invited by the United States’ current vulnerabilities.

***The question is not whether to act, but how quickly the United States can implement this critical safeguard. Congress already passed legislation through Section 1411 of the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act, mandating rare earth independence from China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran by 2035. The legislative foundation exists—what’s missing is the urgency to address the United States’ dependency on foreign suppliers that demand immediate action beyond statutory deadlines. There are also other ways, such as the recently announced Pentagon investment in*** [***MP Materials***](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/pentagon-to-become-largest-shareholder-in-rare-earth-magnet-maker-mp-materials.html)***, which operates an operational rare earth mine and is in the process of building a second magnet manufacturing facility.***

***A strategic rare earth element reserve is not a luxury—it is a necessity. The ability to deter, respond, and win in future conflicts will depend on it. The United States should act with clarity, speed, and strength—in the next fight, the availability of rare earth elements for defense production will be as decisive as soldiers on the battlefield.***

# JULY 24th, 2025~US prioritizes recovery of critical minerals from mine waste

[US prioritizes recovery of critical minerals from mine waste - MINING.COM](https://www.mining.com/web/us-prioritizes-recovery-of-critical-minerals-from-mine-waste/)

[Bingham Canyon mine. \(Image: Wikimedia Commons\)](https://preview.redd.it/bio3zjjbszef1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ee59afd5989229880877364c667485e780c63a9)

The US Interior Department on Thursday took steps to increase recovery of critical minerals, used in everything from electric vehicles to high-tech weapons, from mine waste, coal refuse, tailings and abandoned uranium mines.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum directed his department to streamline federal regulations on the recovery of the minerals such as rare earths, lithium and cobalt from the waste.

The order directs the department to update guidance on making mine waste recovery projects eligible for federal funding and speed up reviews of plans to recover uranium and other minerals from abandoned mines. It also directs the US Geological Survey to map and inventory federal mine waste sites.

It was the latest move by the administration of President Donald Trump to boost the domestic mineral industry that has long been dominated on the global stage by China in both production and processing. In March, Trump [issued an executive order](https://www.mining.com/web/trump-to-expand-critical-mineral-production-using-wartime-powers/) to invoke a Cold War-era Defense Production Act in an effort to boost processing a range of critical minerals.

“This initiative reflects our unwavering commitment to achieving mineral independence and ensuring that America leads the way in advanced technologies that power our future while turning environmental challenges into opportunities for growth and innovation,” Burgum said in a release. His department controls large swathes of federal land some of it home to abandoned mines.

The department expects the move to attract private investment, support environmental reclamation and boost energy sources.

Research by the USGS and state geological surveys has identified sources of minerals like zinc, germanium, tellurium and rare earth elements in shuttered and current mines.

Mining companies have embraced recovery. Freeport-McMoRan, for example, expects to produce 800 million pounds (362,900 metric tons) of copper annually as soon as 2027 by leaching the metal from piles of waste at its mines previously thought to be worthless.

Tar Creek lead and zinc mines near Picher, Oklahoma that were abandoned in the 1970s left behind waste rich in zinc and germanium, minerals the US imports, the department said. In Utah’s Bingham Canyon, tellurium, vital for defense technologies, can be extracted from tailings created during copper mining.

Recovery of minerals from mining waste is promising but requires new processing methods to protect the environment. Legal issues associated with property rights can also complicate the recovery.

[**TANIOBIS GmbH**](https://www.taniobis.com/)**, a specialist in niobium alloy powders, is targeting Europe’s accelerating** [**NewSpace**](https://newspace-europe.lu/) **sector with materials engineered for high thermal loads in aerospace propulsion and structural hardware. The company says its niobium-based** [**AMtrinsic powders**](https://www.taniobis.com/product/amtrinsic-powders-for-3d-printing/) **are intended to meet rising demand for components that must maintain mechanical integrity when exposed to temperatures above 1000 °C—conditions that push beyond common aerospace alloys. Applications include jet engine nozzles, control segments, and satellite thrusters.**

[3D printed propulsion component made from niobium alloy. Photo via TANIOBIS.](https://preview.redd.it/q83t26bttzef1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a8d5a5accae3b93ee5cabd99b64f9bc13eca120)

[AMtrinsic C-103](https://www.taniobis.com/products/amtrinsic-c103/) and [AMtrinsic FS-85](https://www.taniobis.com/products/nb-ta-w-zr-fs85/), two niobium-containing alloys developed by TANIOBIS for additive manufacturing, are designed for use in geometry-optimized parts produced by 3D printing. Such components can incorporate internal channels, weight-reduction features, or complex contours that are difficult or impossible to realize through casting or subtractive processes. The alloys are already in use in environments where structural performance under extreme heat is mandatory, according to company information.

Product Manager Dr. Bahar Fayyazi said the company’s AM alloys are formulated for thermally stressed aerospace systems. “From precise satellite thrusters through to reusable space launch systems, niobium alloys combine high-temperature stability with mechanical integrity, thus offering a material base for new space missions.” TANIOBIS reports ongoing development of its powders in cooperation with research institutions and international companies to align material behavior with aerospace manufacturing requirements.

Independent research underscores interest in these materials. [NASA’s Glenn Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/glenn/) in Cleveland conducted an additive manufacturing evaluation of several niobium alloys, including C-103, FS-85, and Cb-752, as part of its “[Elevated Temperature Mechanical Performance of Historical Niobium Alloys](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20250002220/downloads/Elevated%20temp%20mech%20perf%20of%20historical%20Nb%20alloys.pdf)” study available via the [NASA Technical Reports Server](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/) (NTRS). Results indicated that FS-85 and Cb-752 outperformed C-103 in mechanical strength and creep performance at high temperatures, data that highlight potential advantages for thermal protection components and thermally stressed propulsion regions.

Demand for heat-resistant materials in aerospace has grown as advanced propulsion architectures confront the approximate 1050 °C mechanical stability limit associated with conventional nickel-based alloys. Niobium systems extend that envelope. TANIOBIS says its work in printable niobium powders supports European aerospace development by combining high-temperature capability with the design latitude of additive manufacturing, while also reducing material waste compared to traditional build methods. Continued refinement of powder characteristics is intended to provide consistent properties in mission-critical builds and expand the material baseline for future space hardware.

# Material qualification efforts for aerospace alloys

Efforts to qualify niobium and titanium alloys for aerospace-grade additive manufacturing have accelerated in recent years. In the United States, metal 3D printer manufacturer [Velo3D](https://velo3d.com/) partnered with [Amaero Ltd](https://amaeroinc.com/) to advance the qualification of [C103 niobium and Ti-6Al-4V powders](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/velo3d-advances-qualification-of-amaeros-c103-and-ti-6al-4v-powders-241884/). The testing, conducted by [Auburn University’s National Center for Additive Manufacturing Excellence](https://eng.auburn.edu/research/centers/additive/) (NCAME), demonstrated conformance with [ASTM](https://www.astm.org/) and [AMS standards](https://www.sae.org/publications/collections/content/dlibstd-ams), including ASTM F3635 Class B and AMS7015. The collaboration is part of a broader push to secure a domestic supply chain for high-performance refractory materials in defense and space applications, with over 1,000 kg of powder scheduled for deployment in Velo3D’s Sapphire systems in late 2025.

Parallel qualification activity has also been underway in Canada. [PyroGenesis](https://www.pyrogenesis.com/) recently confirmed that [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com/) is the aerospace OEM [involved in its Ti64 powder approval process](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/pyrogenesis-confirms-boeing-as-aerospace-partner-in-ti64-metal-powder-qualification-237306/). Produced using the company’s [NexGen plasma atomization system](https://ir.pyrogenesis.com/news-releases/news-release-details/pyrogenesis-unveils-its-new-nexgenr-plasma-atomization-system/), the coarse Ti64 powder has passed Boeing’s technical standards and is nearing the final stage of qualification. The material is intended for additive processes including Electron Beam Melting and Directed Energy Deposition. PyroGenesis has stockpiled the titanium alloy in anticipation of formal supplier status, expected in 2025, while continuing to refine its output to meet evolving aerospace requirements.

# The Naskapi Nation's Investment in Scandium: Implications for Indigenous Economic Development

The Naskapi Nation of Kawawachikamach has pioneered a transformative economic model by acquiring a 5% equity stake in Scandium Canada Ltd., marking a strategic shift from traditional resource royalty agreements to active ownership in critical mineral development. This C$334,000 investment in scandium by the Naskapi Nation, executed through the community-controlled Taasipitaakin Trust, positions the Naskapi as direct stakeholders in the Crater Lake scandium project—a deposit described as ""the world's leading primary source of scandium."" Unlike conventional arrangements that limited Indigenous communities to passive revenue streams, this equity partnership enables the Naskapi to influence corporate governance, benefit from long-term value appreciation, and participate in downstream processing opportunities. The transaction follows a year-long community engagement process involving Elders, youth groups, and leadership transitions, ensuring alignment with cultural values and sustainable development principles. ***By aligning with Quebec's aluminum production ecosystem and global demand for lightweight materials, this model demonstrates how Indigenous communities can leverage*** [***critical minerals strategy***](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/australia-critical-minerals-strategic-reserve-2025/) ***for generational wealth creation while advancing decarbonization goals through scandium-aluminum alloys.***

# Conclusion:

**A New Model for Indigenous Participation in Critical Minerals**

The investment in scandium by the Naskapi Nation transcends transactional resource economics, establishing a paradigm for Indigenous sovereignty in green mineral systems. By combining equity ownership with active participation in alloy innovation, the partnership transforms subsurface resources into durable technological advantage and intergenerational wealth.

This aligns with global imperatives: securing critical minerals for [energy transition security](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/critical-minerals-energy-transition-2025-energy-security/) while advancing Indigenous rights through economic agency. As scandium-aluminum alloys enter aerospace and electric vehicle supply chains, the Naskapi demonstrate how communities can leverage mineral endowments for [decarbonisation mining benefits](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/decarbonisation-mining-2025-economic-benefits/).

The model's replicability—already observable in emerging cobalt and graphite agreements—suggests transformative potential for over 300 Indigenous nations in Canada's [mining industry evolution](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/mining-industry-evolution-2025-trends-innovation/) regions alone.

[Gen. Michael Guetlein, overseeing the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system, looks on as President Donald Trump speaks in the Oval Office of the White House on May 20, 2025, in Washington, DC. Credit: Jim Watson\/AFP via Getty Images](https://preview.redd.it/bh8qb4sy90ff1.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=36b76e3bdc60bdb37175f592362130b1d5c69041)

The newly installed head of the Pentagon's Golden Dome missile defense shield, a monumental undertaking projected to cost $175 billion over the next three years, knows the clock is ticking to show President Donald Trump some results before the end of his term in the White House.

""We are going to try to craft a schedule to have incremental demonstrations every six months because we are on a short timeline,"" said Gen. Michael Guetlein, who was confirmed by the Senate last week to become the military's Golden Dome czar.

Speaking on Tuesday, his second day on the job leading the Golden Dome initiative, Guetlein said his team will ""move out with a sense of urgency and move out with incremental wins"" as the military races to meet Trump's timeline.

Guetlein discussed his new job with retired Gen. John ""Jay"" Raymond, the first chief of the Space Force, at an event in Washington, DC, [hosted by the Space Foundation](https://www.spacefoundation.org/innovate-space-global-economic-summit/).

Analysts and retired military officials doubt the Pentagon can achieve all of Trump's Golden Dome promises by the end of 2028. It's not yet clear what the Pentagon can finish in three years, but Guetlein said Thursday his team will deliver ""a capability"" on that schedule. ""We've got to exploit anything and everything we've possibly got,"" he said, echoing a tenet of Space Force policy to ""exploit what we have, buy what we can, and build what we must.""

This means the Space Force will lean heavily on commercial companies, research labs, academia, and, in the case of Canada, international partners to build the Golden Dome

""Golden Dome for America requires a whole-of-nation response to deter and, if necessary, to defeat attacks against the United States,"" the Defense Department said in a statement Tuesday. ""We have the technological foundation, national talent, and decisive leadership to advance our nation's defenses. We are proud to stand behind Gen. Mike Guetlein as he takes the helm of this national imperative.""

President Trump [signed an executive order in January](https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/trump-directs-the-pentagon-to-come-up-with-a-plan-for-space-based-weapons/) calling for the development of a layered missile defense shield to protect the US homeland. He initially called the project the Iron Dome for America, named for Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system. But Israel's Iron Dome, which has proven effective against missile attacks from Iran and its proxies in the Middle East, only has to defend an area the size of New Jersey. The Pentagon's system, now named Golden Dome, will ostensibly cover the entire United States.

# Lay of the land

Advocates for the Golden Dome point to recent events to justify the program. These include Russia's first use of an [intermediate-range ballistic missile](https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/russian-ballistic-missile-attack-on-ukraine-portends-new-era-of-warfare/) against Ukraine last year, and Ukraine's [successful drone attack](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq69qnvj6nlo) on a Russian airbase last month. Waves of Iranian missile and drone attacks on Israel have tested the mettle of that country's Iron Dome.

In the January 27 executive order, the White House said the military's plan must defend against many types of aerial threats, including ballistic, hypersonic, and advanced cruise missiles, plus ""other next-generation aerial attacks,"" a category that appears to include drones and shorter-range unguided missiles.

This will require a network of sensors on the ground and in space, including heat-seeking sensors and radars to track incoming aerial threats, and interceptors based on the ground, at sea, and in space capable of destroying missiles at any point in flight—boost phase, midcourse, and during final approach to a target.

***\*\*\*\*\*The good news for backers of the Golden Dome program is that the Pentagon and commercial industry were developing most of these elements before Trump's executive order. The Space Development Agency (SDA) launched a batch of prototype missile-tracking and data-relay satellites in 2023, pathfinders for a constellation of hundreds of spacecraft in low-Earth orbit that will begin launching later this year.***

First off, I just want to thank everyone for the incredibly warm welcome upon my return yesterday. It’s honestly great to be part of such an amazing community, with so much engagement and genuine buy-in around the work we’re doing here. I’m truly humbled at what we’ve built together—and to everyone who’s been contributing, supporting, or even just reading along, I appreciate it more than you know. I hope you’ve all had a good week.

Before we dive in, just a quick note: this post isn’t about the science or the clinical thesis behind $ATYR. Instead, it’s a look at the structure and mechanics—the ownership, the float, and the market dynamics that are shaping the tape as we head toward the next major catalyst.

Given all the questions coming in about what’s really going on beneath the surface with $ATYR - especially in light of the wild volatility, big price swings, and recurring confusion over the huge daily volumes - I thought it was worth pulling together a full snapshot of where the float and ownership picture stands right now. In my view, the current market structure and ownership dynamic is more important than ever as we head into the readout, and it’s what’s driving so much of the price action you’re seeing on your screens.

A lot of people have asked why the stock can snap up toward $7 on seemingly no news, only to reverse sharply and trade back down toward $5.50, all on eye-watering volumes for a microcap biotech. Some are worried there’s news behind it; others are just trying to make sense of what it means for their positioning. The way I read it, this is the direct consequence of a uniquely tight float, extreme ownership concentration, and a huge short interest meeting a trickle of available shares. It’s a textbook “order book air pocket” scenario: any real buying or selling gets instantly amplified, and daily volumes can spike as traders, algos, and option hedgers battle it out for what little liquidity exists.

Below I’ve pulled together the ownership context, a breakdown of who actually controls the float, and a brief list of the key insights and hypotheses that, in my view, define the market structure and risk/reward going into the next few weeks.

Ok, let’s get into it.

---

### Quick Recap: Where We Stand

- **Institutional ownership last officially reported at ~70% as of 30 March** - *prior* to Russell 2000/3000 index inclusion, which forced passive funds to accumulate millions more shares in June.
- Since March, there’s been (1) **major index-driven buying**, (2) **clear discretionary accumulation by active funds**, and (3) **a significant rise in sticky, high-conviction retail (including this community).**
- **Short interest as of July 15 stands at 20.4M shares, or ~24% of float.**
- New institutional holding data lands on August 15 - **this will be the definitive “post-Russell” number**.

---

### Likely Ownership Structure (July 2025, Est.)

Below is a table based on all the available data, reported figures, and my best synthesis of recent accumulation trends. Actuals will update August 15, but here’s the real-world estimate as of now:

| Holder Type                      | Shares Held (Est.) | % of Float (Est.) | Notes |
|----------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Institutional (funds, passive)   | 65–70M             | 75–82%            | Includes all pre- and post-Russell 2000/3000 index funds, active institutions, crossover funds; likely trending up. |
| Sticky retail (r/CountryDumb, others) | 6–9M           | 7–10%             | Self-reported holdings, highly convicted retail, Reddit crowd, plus “unknown” sticky hands. |
| Insider/management               | 2–3M               | 2–3%              | Form 4 and proxy filings; may be slightly understated. |
| Tradable (liquid) float          | 7–13M              | 8–15%             | “Available” for trading. The real float for price discovery. |
| Short interest                   | 20.4M              | 24% of float      | Note: shorts overlap with tradable float, but coverage will squeeze available shares. |

**Bottom line:** *At most, 10–15% of the float is actively tradable at any one time. Shorts are shorting well beyond what’s actually liquid.*

---

### A Few Key Insights

1. **The Tradable Float Is Even Smaller Than the Headline Number.**  
   When you peel back the layers, aTyr’s “effective” trading float is tiny. Institutional holders - particularly after index inclusion - are sticky and unlikely to dump shares on noise. Most of the true float sits in hands that simply don’t sell on modest price moves or headlines. It’s a setup where sudden demand can trigger air pockets - sharp price spikes with very little actual volume.

2. **Short Interest Has Likely Overshot the Tradable Float - Setup for Squeeze Risk.**  
   With shorts representing 24% of float but so much float locked, the “real” short/float ratio is closer to 1:1 versus *available* shares. If there’s a binary win, forced covering collides with a brick wall of illiquidity, fueling an outsized move.

3. **Russell Index Inclusion Changed the Game for Liquidity.**  
   In June, passive index funds bought millions of shares *not* for trading, but to park in the index basket. These shares simply do not churn. Passive index buyers don’t flip, which has further drained the available supply and stiffened the order book.

4. **Retail Is a Real Market Force Here - Not Just Along for the Ride.**  
   This isn’t a meme stock dynamic, but a well-researched, high-conviction retail cohort that collectively holds millions of shares and isn’t afraid to hold through volatility. In a setup where every share matters, this kind of sticky retail is a genuine supply constraint for shorts and new longs alike.

5. **Options Market Structure Adds Another Layer of Volatility.**  
   Options open interest is heavily concentrated at key strikes, with meaningful gamma exposure. Any post-readout move that blows through these strikes could trigger dealer hedging activity, further exaggerating price moves and adding fuel to a squeeze scenario.

6. **Institutional Holdings Will Likely Be Even Higher When Updated.**  
   Given the evidence of post-March accumulation, the next 13F/quarterly update is likely to show 75–80% institutional ownership, possibly even higher. This will officially confirm the “float crunch” hypothesis and may drive additional interest from funds and quant traders tracking the data.

7. **This Is a Classic “Reflexivity” Setup.**  
   As the stock moves, narrative chases price and vice versa. If a positive catalyst hits, price may move first, then force more buyers in as the reality of the float situation becomes widely understood. In these environments, small moves can snowball.

8. **Shorts Are in a Crowded Trade - But the Pain Trade Is Up.**  
   With so many shares shorted into a tight float, the risk is now asymmetric for shorts. If they’re wrong, the scramble to cover could drive the price exponentially higher in a matter of hours or days.

9. **M&A/Strategic News Could Catalyze an Even Bigger Squeeze.**  
   Should aTyr deliver a positive readout and immediately announce a partnership or buyout, the market would be forced to reprice the entire setup higher in real time - without enough supply to meet demand.

10. **Volatility Will Be Extreme in Either Direction.**  
    With the float this tight, don’t expect a gentle move up or down. If the result is negative, the unwind could be brutal, as sticky holders sell and shorts pile on. If it’s positive, expect air pockets and vertical moves.

---

### Hypotheses

1. A positive readout could, in my view, result in a sustained multi-day, multi-fold price increase, as each new wave of buyers runs into a brick wall of illiquidity. It’s plausible that we’d see forced covering by shorts combined with FOMO-driven demand, with moves that far outpace the underlying “fundamental” value in the short term.

2. If the readout disappoints, I’d expect an equally sharp downdraft - likely even more rapid than the move up, as sticky holders capitulate and shorts press their advantage. The trading structure is so tight that any move, up or down, is likely to be exaggerated versus what we might see in a typical biotech of this size.

3. The way I read it, the “true” trading float at readout is probably closer to 5–8M shares, not the headline 86M. That means even modest-sized orders can move the price significantly, and any large player entering (or exiting) could dominate the tape.

4. I see retail’s role here as much more than a sideshow - this is a highly convicted, research-driven crowd, more akin to early Tesla or the original GME crowd. That dynamic of sticky hands means liquidity dries up even further for new buyers or shorts looking to cover, and price can gap in either direction.

5. Passive fund rebalancing, in my opinion, may not be fully complete - late index buys sometimes occur after a major event (like a binary readout), especially if price action or volume requires additional adjustment for passive ETFs and funds.

6. If we get a strong readout and the sell-side starts to upgrade or major media covers the story, I’d expect further flows from quants, ETFs, or even more active managers, especially if they feel like they “missed the first leg” and have to chase performance.

7. In my view, the options market could become a real accelerant here - dealer hedging at certain strikes could create forced buying (or selling) that turns an ordinary move into something much larger, especially if open interest stays elevated going into the binary.

8. It’s plausible that even a “not perfect but good enough” result - say, efficacy that isn’t best-in-class but is clearly safe and usable - could produce a squeeze simply due to the mechanical set-up. There’s so little float available that any incremental demand could have an outsized impact.

9. If insiders and management really are as convicted as filings suggest, their refusal to sell in the immediate aftermath could act as an accelerant, forcing buyers to pay up or wait for strategic outcomes (like a buyout or partnership) before supply unlocks.

10. Ultimately, the outcome for $ATYR could be determined as much by these float mechanics and supply-demand dynamics as by the underlying data. This is a classic reflexive setup, where market structure magnifies every move.

### What I’m Watching Right Now

1. **August 15 Institutional Holdings Update:**  
   This is the big one - if the official institutional numbers jump meaningfully (and the way things have been trending, I suspect they will), it’ll confirm the “float crunch” thesis in black and white. That could itself trigger further interest from funds and momentum traders. I’ll be watching the precise breakdown and any new names entering the register.

2. **Pre-Readout Options Positioning:**  
   Dealer and speculator positioning on the options chain has been dynamic, with lots of OI at key strikes ($6, $7.50, $10, $12.50 and beyond). I’m paying close attention to how gamma exposure evolves, what happens to implied volatility as the window narrows, and whether there are new large bets (bullish or bearish) that could portend a squeeze or crush. Any evidence of dealer hedging activity or sudden shifts in volume will be key tells.

3. **Retail Sentiment and Community Ownership:**  
   I’m monitoring self-reported holdings (Reddit, Discord, other communities), number of unique holders, and churn in sentiment. If high-conviction retail sticks together (as it has so far), that’s a persistent supply constraint for both shorts and new buyers. I’m also watching for evidence of new money joining the fray.

4. **Short Interest Trend Into the Readout:**  
   Will shorts blink before the binary, or will they double down? I’m watching for any meaningful cover or, alternatively, an aggressive ramp in shorting ahead of the data. Borrow rates, utilization, and locate difficulties will all be signals to watch. Higher SI at the readout means higher risk for both sides.

5. **Liquidity Dynamics and Tape Action:**  
   Intra-day and pre-market prints, thin bid/ask spreads, and block prints that move the market more than usual - all of these are signals that float is as tight as it looks. Large moves on small volumes, or huge spikes on seemingly minor news, are all classic symptoms. I’m particularly interested in how the tape behaves immediately pre- and post-readout.

6. **Management and Insider Activity:**  
   Any signs of insider buying, option exercises, or new 13D/G filings would be very meaningful. Management’s posture (silent and holding, or taking action) often signals confidence or risk aversion. If they’re holding tight through readout, that’s another supply constraint and a signal worth tracking.

7. **Potential for M&A or Strategic Partnerships:**  
   Any chatter or whisper of a partnership, buyout, or major licensing deal could catalyze a sudden squeeze, especially if the float is already tight and sentiment is bullish. In my opinion, with pharma hungry for de-risked late-stage assets, a clean readout could put ATYR in play almost instantly.

8. **Media and Analyst Chatter:**  
   If new coverage appears or we see analyst upgrades or target increases right before or after the readout, that could accelerate FOMO and drive further buying from institutions and retail alike. I’m watching major news wires, biotech-focused analysts, and even retail financial media.

9. **Real-Time Retail and Fund Messaging:**  
   I’m constantly watching for any signs that fund managers or institutional Twitter/Reddit accounts are changing tone - be it shifting from neutral to bullish, or vice versa. Unusual activity in large-cap biotech flows sometimes presages action in small caps, especially if they move in tandem.

### Summary

In my opinion, $ATYR is heading into its binary event with probably the tightest float, highest short interest, and most “sticky” ownership I’ve seen in a US biotech in years. Institutional hands, retail conviction, and index inclusions have drained nearly all tradable supply from the market. Shorts are betting big, but the setup is a powder keg for either direction - any real catalyst will force a violent, nonlinear move.

If you’re following this story, I’d suggest watching the ownership and float dynamics as closely as the science or price. The next few weeks could be a masterclass in market structure and reflexivity.

On a side note, yesterday I asked for suggestions on deep dives and got some great feedback - four or five really solid ideas. I’ll be mulling those over across the weekend and will aim to put together something substantial based on the most-requested topics. If you’ve got another angle you want covered, drop it in the comments below. Always open to good research prompts.

As always, not investment advice - just the way I’m reading what the tape, filings, and market behaviour are telling us.

Curious to hear others’ takes, especially from anyone tracking other high-squeeze setups or who’s lived through similar market structure events.

Wishing everyone a restful weekend ahead - it’s going to be a big few weeks.

1m8wex6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AbioticFactor/comments/1m8wex6/spoilers_ahead_huge_theory_on_whats_actually/,"SPOILERS AHEAD, Huge theory on what's actually going on behind the curtains.","My friend and I beat the game and it was a fantastic journey. This game was made with love and it's truly a gem, one of the best co-op experiences we've had. So my theory is: We are going through time-cycles to fix the mess we created / Dr. Manse pulls the strings to go through time-cycles to fix the mess he created and we just happen to be stuck in it.Wait what? Let me elaborate. So throughout the game there were multiple hints of ""all of this has already happened"", ""time goes in circles"", etc. Exor village chief says they remember you, even tho it's the first time you meet them. Sister of the Unlost  keeps saying all of this has already happened before. In the Residence sector we learn from Dr. Manse recording that time-travel is indeed possible and he has orders from a woman named Annette to do something with it.. In Botanical Labs we even time-travel ourselves. There is a recording in the future realm inside one of the red portals, where Dr. Lenora Riggs said she and her squad were sent on a mission to the GATE facility by Dr. Manse himself to check on some REDACTED stuff. So it implies Riggs, Manse and some others are still alive in the near future and Dr. Manse probably has a plan on how to fix things.Also, at the end of Botanic gardens, when you teleport to the Gatekeepers facility, some woman recognizes you and orders Gatekeepers to let you go. You can go and check the view in the window, there is a giant wall-like structure. So the Earth is kinda messed up yeah, but it's still there and some humans survived and had found the Gatekeepers organization. So perhaps the woman who ordered them to let you go was future Dr. Riggs.  
Dr. Janet Ross was singing a song at the beacon in the end and we know the other character who was singing - Sister of the Unlost. Can't confirm if they both sing the same tune tho, so it may be a coincidence. But I guess that hints that she is the future Dr. Ross.Dr. Abe Stern grabbed a submarine and gave the rest of the world the finger.Dr. Thule went back to the GATE facility to drink his coffee and probably stayed there.Dr. Manse...We know for sure he is alive in the near future (Botanical Labs recording by Dr. Riggs). But no info if he is still alive in the distant future (where Riggs and Ross are supposedly the Gatekeepers). Sister of the Unlost keeps saying this all has happened before. Mage of the Unlost keeps saying that ""it was not their choice"" during the final boss fight. If the Sister is Dr. Ross, then indeed she has already seen it all when she was just a scientist and indeed it was not their choice in the end (it was our player character's decision to touch the Altar). But why are they here? So the theory is - either our player character but from the future, or future Dr Manse creates Gatekeepers (according to lore it is unknown how and when the Gatekeepers organisation was created). They travel back in time and slowly do the job - contain various ISs, contain Pink Tentacle Monster and put tight security around it, then when shit hits the fan they start killing everyone inside the GATE facility hoping that this time they can kill us so we will not start another apocalypse. Right here I'm leaning more towards it's future Dr. Manse being behind the curtains and pulling the strings trying to figure out a proper configuration of events that don't lead to apocalypse. But it seems our player character is kinda unique (to the point we can carry a part of Sundisk power within us, but it is mentioned that someone else was also touched by Sundisk... but I can't recall the exact text). So, the idea is - perhaps our player character is sort of an IS that causes an apocalypse and we can not be killed by existing weapons because we constantly resurrect. And this is the part that future Dr. Manse is missing from his plan or trying to investigate via Sister of the Unlost who observes us.

WHY do I have to have such sensitive skin that can’t really tolerate twice a day showers on a long term basis. I’d also say it’s excessive water usage, but I just have a speedy soapy body shower like five minutes or less and all my showers are short now because my hot water is a little B. 

I skipped breakfast. I feel ugly. I KNOW ITS BAD. I also didn’t have dinner last night. I still also just feel flat though and therefore don’t want to put any effort into cooking. 

We’re going through a whole global corporate restructure at the end of this year and onwards, which basically means I may have a whole new job. There’s zero intel on it so far, like they could not be more vague if they tried, but based on the bits I did pick up on I’m wondering if there’s an opportunity for me to step away from advisory type work, I mean this secondment will continue as normal, but my substantive role I mean, I wonder if I may move away from advisory? I just don’t think it’s the right fit for me. I feel so much more engaged in my current type of work, which is still HR but just in a different capacity. More business and system oriented, less people oriented. I mean user experience is something I am super interested in, so I’m not sure, maybe something in that space. Which I think means I would transfer to be more in the global space. But who knows, time zones are tricky so maybe not. But it could be exactly what I want? But I don’t even know what’s out there. I’m just trying to not think about it and see how it goes. I do like working for this company, and I want to stay with them because I think it would help me in terms of moving to Sydney and just transferring. And if I become part of the global team I could essentially work wherever the hell I fancy as they’re all over the show. I was on a call with a guy in Montreal, a lady from Cleveland, a lady from Brisbane and a guy from Toronto earlier today for example. One guys off living somewhere in Spain. And mix that with Andy’s ability to more or less work from anywhere, so long as we ensure he has the proper set up, we could even actually just live in a different country for a year or something. Sublet wherever we would be living in Sydney and then rent somewhere overseas, maybe six months in one place and six in another. He used to talk about Romania, maybe he still wants to spend time there. Or maybe south of France. But also we’re not made of money so perhaps not. Idk anywhere! He’s not huge on Italy I know but I would loveeee to spend time in some little villa in Tuscany or Puglia or somewhere. Anyway. I wonder what will happen. 

I really resent being a woman sometimes. I just spent ten minutes scrubbing my BRAND NEW mattress topper because of this disgusting time of the month. I’m starting to think I was meant to put the mattress protector on top…? Not directly on the mattress…? But I just googled and I did it right (yay me). Maybe I should get another mattress protector and have that between my sheet and topper? But then I have five layers, not including my sheet. What do I dooooooooo. Anyway it’s 95% gone but still, that 5% will haunt me. I don’t have *accidents* often, but sometimes it’s just a B of a month. I *dread* the day I have my period while I’m with Andy. DREAD. 

I had therapy today and it was fine. I don’t really have anything much to say about it wait yes I do.  Okay so we talked about how I feel like I can never achieve my goals and then she mentioned how that’s a thing with adhd - you set these huge lofty goals because they’re exciting and you get a dopamine hit from the feeling of it, plus the inner drive of urgency and needing to do it NOW and there’s no time to ease into anything it’s just GO GO GO NOW NOW NOW but anyway so then I write my plan and my lists and I get a big dopamine hit from that - I always do when I write myself a plan or list - and then I just don’t really so much further than that because I have set myself up to fail and the things I tell myself I must do don’t ignite any form of dopamine in me and because I’m lacking in it or something/my dopamine receptors aren’t so great (I still need to learn about this) it means my brain won’t allow me to do things that don’t bring dopamine or excite me. I’ll try write more about this weekend. I still need to learn more about what adhd actually is. My psychiatrist didn’t say anything, like at all ever, just that I have it. My therapist/psychologist gave a very brief overview but she said she doesn’t specialise in it so much so idk. I’m fine doing my own research anyway I’d prefer to do that actually. I currently know that it is a neurodevelopment disorder that wreaks havoc with your ability to regulate yourself so like your attention and your emotions and all that. And I don’t LACK dopamine but my brain just doesn’t work the way a ‘normal’ person might, and also one called norepinephrine which I now in my head say Nor-Pine-Frine because that’s how I know to spell it but anyway so that’s why I’m always unable to focus on one thing like as soon as I’m remotely bored or it’s too hard or I feel tired or whatever it might be I go seek out some distraction/dopamine hit - even as minor as just going to my room to spray some perfume on me instead of finishing/starting my work and then I’ll just start doing other stuff. Like I might go make a coffee for example as a means of a break, but then I’ll start cleaning the kitchen up and then go pull some weeds out around my lavender or play on my phone or whatever before the thought of work comes back to me. I feel like taking out the rubbish would even be considered a fun distraction when I’m faced with something hard at work. Less boring and more hard, and I find everything hard because I struggle to focus on understanding what to do and so then it’s just a vicious circle and that’s just a tiny bit of it all. Anyway. I at least didn’t cry today. Probably too dehydrated from the amount I cried last night as I fell asleep - I’m such a cheery, easy breezy girl aren’t I? -_- 

The train to my parents was fine. I talked to two train ladies and I felt very social. The second I even said “I like the book you’re reading” as she was reading when the train was going and I saw it as I went to get off at my stop and she said she was annotating it for her partner to read which was nice. I wonder what she’d note down? I don’t think I’d ever do that for Andy, instead I just leave lots of little tiny love notes scattered throughout the pages like I did with the book I sent for his birthday and he wasn’t able to collect it so I guess it’s destroyed now. Or some postal worker took them home and read my card and all my love notes and stuff.. that makes me so uncomfy to think about. Anyway I felt and still feel so wild for having said I like that book out of the blue to a stranger. 

I spent the evening with dad and pups. He made us a toastie for dinner and the fire was going and we just chatted and stuff. He was telling me about his aunts and uncles on his mums said and they’re all so cliche Italian I love it. Either work with fish or tomatoes and it sounded like all NINE children were very successful? I feel like such a failure of my entire extended family everywhere throughout history. 

I haven’t really heard from him today. He sent one message in the afternoon and I replied immediately and just nothing since then. Idk. I know he’s unwell but I’m starting to struggle with the thought that he’s also using this as an opportunity to phase me out. I don’t really want to think about it. He can do what he likes. 

Okay time for bed. Puppy is so snuggly next to me under the throw blanket. Cutie.

As of yesterday my magnifica Smart S has suddenly stopped working properly.
The espresso, steam button, hot water/steam valve, and rinse button have all stopped working.

Turning the steam valve doesn't even make the noise to start the water/steam delivery. If I press the espresso button multiple times it will sometimes register, grinds the beans extremely briefly, but then immediately stops flashing, then the ""coffee"" light turns on briefly, a small amount of coffee is produced (2-3mm for about 1 second) and then all lights go off and the machine makes the noises of returning to its default state.

Additionally, the 2x Espresso, Coffee and Long button are all now producing the same size coffee.

I've fully cleaned the machine to see if this helps, but I cannot enter the descaling process as this required me to press the espresso button which isn't registering at all.

Any help is greatly appreciated!

# Weather & Weekend Update: (Released on [[Thursday's Edition](https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/p/thursday-july-24th-must-read)], but adjusted for Friday's Reddit post)

After another sizzler yesterday that pushed us over our yearly average for 90-degree days, a cold front moves in today, bringing scattered showers and thunderstorms through the morning and afternoon. It'll be very muggy ahead of the front, but things should dry out by this evening in time for Vermont Green FC's conference final. Expect haze from Canadian wildfire smoke to start rolling in late tonight, which becomes the main story for Saturday. While Saturday will be dry and less humid with highs in the mid-80s, the air quality is expected to be poor, and sensitive groups should limit their time outdoors. Sunday sees the air quality improve, but the mugginess returns with a chance of showers, especially for areas south of Burlington.

Today belongs to Vermont Green FC. They host a massive Eastern Conference Final against Virginia's Lionsbridge FC at Virtue Field tonight, with the winner lifting the conference trophy and advancing to Sunday's National Semifinal. It's historic territory for the Vermonters in their first conference final appearance, facing a Virginia juggernaut making their third straight run. Lucky to you if you were able to snag tickets, I hear they sold out in minutes once again. This evening brings multiple ways to beat the heat: the South End Get Down returns from 5pm to 9pm with rotating food trucks and DJs, while South Burlington's Art in the Park at Goose Pond offers music from Rachel Ambaye, Ethiopian cuisine from A Taste of Abyssinia, and participatory tie dye from 5:30 to 7:30pm. CCTV's 24 hour telethon kicks off at 6pm tonight, running straight through Saturday's Ramble festivities, inviting folks to experience old school TV magic. Recharge tonight at Savu Sauna Lakeside is $35 a person and promises a sauna, cold plunge, N/A cocktails and DJ beats. Foam Brewers hosts Danny & The Parts' album release show for ""Mona Lisa's Eyes are Blue"" at 9pm, celebrating local Americana recorded right here on Pine Street during the pandemic years. Tonight also has DJ David Chief and DJ ATAK at Red Square starting at 10pm with a Battle of the Beats, Old Skool vs New School! I know for sure that it’ll be an unforgettable dance party if you can make it!

Holy smokes (pun intended), Saturday is PACKED and belongs to the Ramble. Burlington's beloved Old North End festival celebrates 21 years with this year's theme of FLOW, and there's so much happening I can barely fit it all (seriously, check out the full event list and map here: [The Ramble](https://theramble.org/2025-event-map/)). Start your morning at Dilly's Coffee free flow and bindle-palooza from 8-10am with free coffee, their free store, and $5 mirrors all day. Tony Shull's art walking tour kicks off at 9:30am, followed by the relocated Ramble Field Day at Roosevelt Park from 10am-noon with sack races and freeze pops. Dan Siegel's Epic Pottery Sale runs 10am-2pm featuring pots from $5 up, plus the Old North End's Largest Bread Tag with free art gifts. The ONE World Market at ONECC brings 40+ artists, bouncy houses, and live music from 11am-3pm, while Decaturfest on Decatur Street serves free burgers and dogs while they last. Don't miss Ratsmission Bazaar's carnival games and yard sale, Jamba's wardrobe sale at Junktiques with DJs starting at 11:11am, or the Chalk Art Party at 12:30pm on Lafountain Street. The afternoon brings the Ramble Roller Disco at Pomeroy Park from 2-4pm supporting Migrant Justice, followed by the Epic Bike Ride starting at Old Spokes Home at 4:15pm. The Round Up at ONECC runs 5-10pm with performances by Chaz Royer, Diamond, Danny & the Parts, Emerald Ground Water and MAD, plus Fiddlehead's beer garden and treats from Moo Noit Market, Le Bon Goût, and Vermont Marshmallow Company. Late night options include Taco Gordo's Late Night Ramble with Tubtime until 2am and DJ Taka's 10-year anniversary spinning at Light Club Lamp Shop from 8pm-2am. Outdoor Gear Exchange also throws their 30th Anniversary Block Party on Church Street from 11am to 10pm Saturday, featuring live music all day, massive gear raffles, brand meet-and-greets, and special 30% off deals because what better way to mark three decades than with matching discounts?

Sunday offers a gentler pace after Saturday's festivities, though no less entertaining. The Boardroom hosts their Amazing Puzzle Race at noon, where teams of up to four compete to complete a 500-piece jigsaw in 4.5 hours for $40 per team and bragging rights. Come evening, Venetian Cocktail & Soda Lounge on Pine Street transforms Sunday scaries into spotlight therapy with their weekly karaoke night from 6 to 9pm, providing the perfect low-key wrap to a high-energy weekend.

Historically, July in Burlington averages around 81°F/62°F. Yesterday’s 96°F high significantly exceeded both the monthly mean and the previous record of 95°F. Over the next few days, temperatures will moderate, averaging in the low‑80s with lows in the low‑60s to mid‑70s.

[**'The Daily Show' Visits Burlington, 'Rue Canada'**](https://www.sevendaysvt.com/news/the-daily-show-visits-burlington-rue-canada-44046223)

>

Comedy Central's Jordan Klepper hit Burlington over the weekend to film a segment about U.S. Canada relations, interviewing locals at the Vermont Brewers Festival and along the newly christened ""Rue Canada"" (formerly Church Street). The correspondent's visit was sparked by Burlington's efforts to woo back Canadian tourists amid Trump's tariffs and rhetoric about making Canada the 51st state. OGE cofounder Marc Sherman used his face time to emphasize opposition to the president's trade policies, while the brewers association highlighted their Canadian outreach efforts including discounted festival tickets. Burlington resident Karen Chickering, who made headlines for traveling to Canada to apologize for Trump, described her waterfront interview as ""friendly, silly."" The segment will air either before August 1 or in September, giving Burlington some national comedy spotlight. Plus, I managed to snag a photo with Klepper on Church Street. He laughed at my electric unicycle and habanero snackings. Check it out on Instagram @ [BtownBrief](https://www.instagram.com/btownbrief/)

The $300 million two tower project features Vermont's first AC Hotel by Marriott occupying floors 2-7 with 161 rooms, while floors 8-11 house 53 apartments ranging from $1,950/month studios to $6,800 two bedrooms. Jitters Cafe claimed the first commercial lease, bringing a UVM alum owned Massachusetts eatery to the corner of Bank and St. Paul. Hotel franchisee Ankur Patel expects the downtown location will recapture business that's ""gone out to Williston,"" while S.D. Ireland Properties' Kim Ireland hopes new residents will boost struggling downtown businesses. The LEED Gold targeted building includes high end amenities like a craft cocktail lounge featuring smoked Manhattans and AC Marriott's signature ""gin tonic."" Construction continues on the larger north tower with another hotel and 315 apartments including student and inclusionary housing, keeping the site active through 2027 as Burlington works to revitalize its urban core.

>

Burlington has unveiled a 360 foot art installation wrapping around Memorial Auditorium's fence at South Union and Main Street, hoping creative displays will discourage graffiti tagging on the historic building. The project features 10 distinct displays ranging from paintings to photographs, transforming what was a blank canvas for taggers into a curated outdoor gallery. This creative approach to graffiti prevention follows similar successful initiatives in other cities where commissioned art tends to be respected by street artists who might otherwise tag blank walls. The installation both beautifies the streetscape and protects the auditorium's facade, turning a persistent vandalism problem into an opportunity for public art engagement.

>

Fletcher Free Library has launched an innovative story walk program that transforms reading into an outdoor adventure across Burlington. The initiative places story pages in windows and on fences throughout the city, encouraging families to explore while they read. What makes this particularly sweet is the chance to win ""tasty prizes"" for participating, though the library hasn't specified what culinary delights await lucky readers. This creative approach to literacy combines Burlington's walkable neighborhoods with storytelling, getting kids moving while engaging with books in a fresh way that beats screen time any day.

>

CCTV Center for Media & Democracy kicks off a 24 hour telethon tomorrow at 6pm to save 41 years of Burlington's community media archives currently stored on 11,000 VHS tapes and DVDs. The marathon broadcast, running straight through Saturday's Ramble festivities, features everything from Death to Intelligent Dance Music performances to local talk shows like ""Tea Talks with Lydia Diamond."" After losing federal grant funding, CCTV faces a preservation crisis for recordings documenting four decades of meetings, protests, celebrations, and conversations that shaped our community. Local philanthropists Orly Yadin and Bob Summers have pledged $10,000 in matching funds to jumpstart the archival effort. The telethon invites studio audiences to experience ""old school TV magic"" at their North Winooski Avenue location, with opportunities to run cameras or even get on air while supporting this crucial piece of Burlington's collective memory.

[**Burlington's First-Ever Bike Park Is a Community Effort**](https://www.sevendaysvt.com/news/burlingtons-first-ever-bike-park-is-a-community-effort-44056428)

>

After a decade of planning, Burlington's first bike park will break ground at Leddy Park this month with an October opening target, transforming an underused wooded area into 2,070 linear feet of jump lines and flow trails. The project started when Old Spokes Home mechanic Sean Melinn noticed kids buying BMX bikes then abandoning the hobby for lack of places to ride. His observation evolved into a true community effort raising over $146,000 through creative fundraising like OGE round ups and raffled bikes (won by someone named Leddy, fittingly). The Development Review Board unanimously approved phase one on July 1, with construction preserving all but four mature trees while creating trails accessible from both North Avenue and the bike path. Unlike a controversial 2009 disc golf proposal that neighbors torpedoed, the bike coalition did extensive outreach and designed trails north of walking paths to prevent collisions. The $125,000 first phase will be mostly grant funded with just $15,000 from city coffers, offering Burlington families a neighborhood alternative to driving to Essex or Richmond for mountain biking adventures.

A small aircraft made an emergency crash landing at Burlington International Airport with two people aboard, though thankfully both walked away uninjured according to BTV officials. The incident, while dramatic, ended about as well as any crash landing can, with no injuries reported and emergency responders quickly on scene. Airport operations continued normally following the incident.

>

Winooski Superintendent Wilmer Chavarria, a U.S. citizen since 2018, endured a five hour detention and interrogation at Houston's airport Monday while returning from visiting family in Nicaragua. Despite using Global Entry for years without issue, customs officials pulled him from line, separated him from his spouse, demanded his phone passwords, mocked his 15 year marriage, and threatened his job while denying him legal counsel or phone calls. When Chavarria asked about his constitutional rights, an official allegedly told him ""you have no rights here"" at the port of entry. The ordeal, which caused them to miss their connecting flight, ended with his Global Entry revoked without explanation Tuesday morning. This marks a disturbing escalation for the Chavarria family; his brother already self deported in April after the Supreme Court upheld ending temporary parole programs. The incident has sparked outrage from Vermont officials including Sen. Sanders calling it ""unacceptable"" racial profiling, Rep. Balint condemning it on the House floor, and the Winooski School Board demanding investigation of what they termed ""deeply disturbing"" treatment of their ""exemplary leader."" The ACLU refuted claims that citizens lose constitutional rights at ports of entry, while Chavarria now questions what he can tell Winooski's many immigrant families about safe travel: ""It's not about immigration status really. It's about being Black and brown immigrants.""

[**Burlington mayor allows police to make their own media statements**](https://www.wcax.com/2025/07/23/burlington-mayor-allows-police-make-their-own-media-statements/)

>

Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak rescinded her January executive order requiring mayoral review of police press releases, following the police commission's approval of an updated media policy Wednesday. The new guidelines specifically prohibit police from releasing statements about individuals' character, reputation, or criminal records, addressing the concerns that originally prompted mayoral oversight. The executive order came after former Chief Jon Murad's releases took on a ""political tinge"" targeting both the courts and Chittenden County State's Attorney's Office, one of several incidents contributing to his non reappointment this spring. The policy change returns media autonomy to BPD while establishing clear boundaries on permissible public communications.

# Volunteer Opportunity of the Week: Burlington Community Justice Center

There are so many volunteer opportunities in Burlington! This week I choose to highlight:

# 202+ Things to Do in Burlington (Summer Activities)

Today’s picks:

Five more to keep your week feeling fresh and a little spontaneous. Walk the trails at Colchester Pond where the loop gives you a mix of open views and shaded paths with plenty of bird activity if you pay attention. Stop by Foam Brewers for a drink and sit outside near the lake where the vibe is relaxed and the people-watching is solid. Spend a quiet hour browsing records at Burlington Records or Pure Pop and let yourself pick something unexpected to bring home. Take a trip to the Vermont State House in Montpelier for a free self-guided tour and a walk through the surrounding streets that feel a little slower than Burlington. And if the weather turns, try a few rounds of axe throwing at Burly Axe for something fun and completely different.

Full list’s always waiting here when you need a plan: [https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/202-activites](https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/202-activites)

# This Week’s Restaurant Review: Pizzeria Verità

Pizzeria Verità has carved out a solid reputation since 2012 as Burlington's go-to spot for authentic Neapolitan pizza, complete with a wood-fired oven imported directly from Naples. The restaurant's commitment to traditional technique shows in every pie: hand-stretched dough with the signature puffy cornicione edge, quality San Marzano tomatoes, and fresh fior di latte mozzarella that's made in-house. Standout pizzas like the Mais, featuring fire-roasted Vermont corn with speck and crème fraîche, successfully bridge Italian tradition with local ingredients, while classics like the Margherita deliver the pure, simple flavors that define true Neapolitan style.

The lively, energetic atmosphere matches the open kitchen setup where diners can watch skilled pizzaioli at work, creating an engaging dining experience that feels both authentic and distinctly Burlington. Co-owners Leslie Wells and John Rao's dedication to the craft is evident: Wells trained in Italy and New York to master traditional techniques, and their emphasis on local Vermont ingredients through partnerships like the Vermont Fresh Network adds a meaningful community connection. The restaurant consistently ranks among Burlington's top dining spots, earning recognition in local ""Daysies"" awards and maintaining strong online reviews for both food quality and service.

However, Pizzeria Verità's popularity can work against it during peak times, when the bustling atmosphere tips into chaos and securing a table without reservations becomes tough. Prices run $15-20 per pizza, which can feel steep for some, but not bad compared to surrounding pizza places. The limited menu can leave some diners wanting more variety beyond the antipasti selection. The high-energy environment, while part of the appeal for many, can feel quite busy for those seeking a quieter meal, and service can become stretched thin when the restaurant hits capacity. Despite these drawbacks, Pizzeria Verità delivers on its promise of authentic Neapolitan pizza in a vibrant setting that captures Burlington's local dining scene.

As night came, light from the town's square pierced through the black sky. It was an open space of over one thousand square feet, its borders denoted by the various homes and businesses of the townsfolk. Lilyville was abuzz with life as the townspeople celebrated Daisy's return by eating and dancing to the most joyful music. Circular tables covered with food were neatly arranged around the area for the people’s convenience as the local band gleefully played their drums and booming brass in a corner. Daisy was in the heart of it, happy as she sat with Belle and Aisha, consuming Mary’s apple pie.

Carter sat from afar, watching them giggle and have a friendly chat. He wanted to ask Daisy to dance, but he reasoned it would be better to give her alone time. Carter was more than willing to spare a night or two without her. He did have her almost totally to himself for over a year. And he knew all too well the hardship of having violence keep you apart from your family.

So, instead, he opted to indulge in the midwestern food Daisy would always long for on dinner dates. But as he took a bite of Kansas barbecue and macaroni from his plate, he noticed some little girls staring at him. He playfully winked his eye at them, and the girls blushed bright red as they ran away like the wind. However, as Mary saw this, she hurried to Daisy with a heavy breath.

""Sweetie, that boy over there.” Mary pointed at Carter. “Is he a friend of yours from the city? If so, I have a few words for him.""

""Oh, this is perfect.” Daisy stood up. “Come with me, Ma.""

Daisy took her mother’s hand, bringing her to Carter. As he saw them coming, a look of terror swept his face, and he immediately stopped eating, standing at attention like he was meeting his superior officer. But as they reached him, Daisy wrapped herself around Carter's arm, Mary's eyes widening at the sight of them as she placed her hand over her mouth.

""Ma, may I introduce you to Carter Buchanan Barnes, my boyfriend. We met after I left town. I mentioned him a bunch of times in our letters.""

Carter extended his arm to Mary for a handshake, trembling. ""It’s a pleasure to meet you, ma'am. R- Daisy said nothing but good things.""

""I see. Sweetie, may I talk to you for a little bit?""

Mary swiftly dragged Daisy back to Aisha and Belle. And as they arrived, she started nursing a migraine, rubbing her temples

Mary took a deep breath. ""Sweetie, I'm going to be honest with you. I don't know how I feel about this Carter boy.""

""Ma, he's a good man. I explained everything you need to know in our letters. Don't you trust me?""

""Of course I do. But I trust your sister, too. And she has her own opinions on the boy.""

Daisy looked at Belle with a glare.*""What type of opinions?*

As Belle saw Daisy, she let out a nervous laugh. But Mary turned Daisy's gaze back on her, and she looked her in the eye.

""She said the boy was with many different girls before you. And you stayed silent when he joked about having a new one every week.""

""Ma, I love him, and he loves me. He’s a good man, I promise.""

Daisy initiated a pinky promise, and Mary looked at her, shaking. But as she took a deep breath, she accepted. As they finished, Daisy hugged Mary, running back to Carter. They swiftly joined the rest of the townspeople, dancing the night away. And as Mary looked at them, she yielded a small smile, seeing Daisy happy.

\*\*\*

Hours later, the light and music subsided, the party was over, and the townspeople retired for the night. In the aftermath of the celebration, Aisha hugged Daisy with a desperate grasp. However, as Daisy reciprocated, she started crying.

“Aisha, is there something wrong?” Daisy asked.

*""Oh god, I hope I don't wake up tomorrow and learn this was all a dream,""* Aisha said, weeping.

""Rest assured, my friend, this is real. See you in the morning.""

""Thanks. But do you mind saying a prayer for me? I'll need it to apologize to my daddy.""

Daisy nodded to Aisha's question, and as Aisha took one more swift hug, she started to leave. But before she could, Mary hugged and kissed Aisha on the forehead goodbye.

Later, Daisy entered her old home with her family. Inside was a relatively small space of approximately four hundred square feet. Mementos covered nearly every inch of its homely styling. In one corner were the girl’s childhood pictures depicting the different stages of their lives. In another were their toys, and sewing kits, Daisy and her sisters would regularly practice their art with. And in another still, stood Joseph’s recliner beside his wife’s patted chair.

""So this is where you grew up."" Carter whistled.

""Yeah, and it looks the same as when we left. Pa's chair is even in the same spot.""

""Thank you, sweetie.” Mary turned her gaze to Carter, pointing down a hall to the right. “Now, boy, you can get settled in our guest room. It’s the first room to the left down the hall.""

""Oh, thanks, ma'am. But I prefer to bunk with Daisy.""

""What? Where did you get such an obscene idea? You are not even-""

The gears of Mary’s mind yielded an uncomfortable realization. She grew a seething glare and directed it at Daisy. And as Daisy and Belle saw her, the sisters trembled as abject terror ran down their spines.

*""Did you have sex before marriage?""* Mary shouted.

Daisy saw the fury on her mother's face and dropped to her knees as tears flowed down her eyes.

""Yes, Ma, I did. I didn't think it would be a problem because we love each other as much as you and Pa did. Belle and I-""

*""You and Belle,""* Mary interrupted.

Mary directed her glare at Belle. As she saw her, Belle followed her sister's lead. The girls quickly got on their knees before Mary.

""We're sorry. We're sorry. We're sorry,"" Belle and Daisy said in unison.

Mary nursed a migraine, pinching her forehead. ""How many times?""

As they heard their mother, the sisters raised their fingers as an answer to her question. Daisy raised four fingers and Belle two.

""You need to understand this right now. Even if god wanted you two to have these boys, your impatience disrespected him.” Mary released a deep sigh for her wayward daughters. “But pray about it tonight, and I’ll forgive you, fair?""

""Yes, ma'am, thank you,"" Daisy said.

Daisy and Belle got off their knees, but as they did, Mary hugged them both goodnight before leaving the room.

""Good night, sissy. I have a prayer to do.""

As Belle left the room, Carter hurried to Daisy.

""Red, I would like to apologize.""

""Thanks, but I knew the rules, and I broke them.” Daisy took a deep breath. “Carter-""

""Don't worry. We don't need to sleep together tonight. But do me a favor and show me your phone. I want to call my mom and sister,"" Carter interrupted.

Daisy smiled as she heard Carter and quickly grabbed his hand, guiding him toward the phone.

\*\*\*

A few days later, on a sunny morning, Carter stood outside with Belle and Aisha as he chopped wood. He put a big block of wood on a tree stump and slashed it with such speed the girls only saw the glare from the axe blade as it fell apart into neatly cut pieces. Both of them covered their mouths with their hands as they saw it.

""Pretty boy, you're almost too good with blades,"" Belle said

""Thanks, sister. I have to say it's been great coming here. I might build a place for Daisy and me after the war.""

""Speaking of which, how's that coming? With you here and all.""

""Did Daisy say anything?""

Belle nodded no to Carter's question.

""Well, to keep a long story short, I have to go somewhere called Planet Aqua in about two days. I'll meet Clive and another general to help bolster defenses.""

""In two days? And I was getting used to having a man around the house again. But anyhow, good luck, Barnes.""

""And don't worry, we'll take good care of Daisy this time. After everything, nothing else matters, not even-""

Without warning, Aisha spotted someone walking up to them, and much like Daisy with Carter, it was like the mythical love at first sight. Samuel was all her desires in a black business suit. Her heart pounded like a drum as she saw him, a handsome young man with short blond hair, blue eyes, and Caucasian.

""Good morning, Miss David. Is your mother ready to talk business?""

""Sorry, we meant to tell you earlier, but the deal is off.""

""What but-""

Samuel looked around and spotted Carter. As he saw him, he started sweating.

""C-carter Barnes, what's a war hero like you doing here? There isn't going to be trouble, is there?""

""Don't wet yourself, friend.” Carter chuckled. “I'm just enjoying some time off with my girl.""

""That's good to hear. Goodbye, Miss David.""

Samuel started to leave, but he quickly spotted Aisha. Her grace stopped him cold, and he stared at her, enamored with every detail of her body. As if Aisha was the first beautiful woman Samuel had ever seen.

""Hello, my name is Samuel. I don't think I've had the pleasure.""

""The name is Aisha Robinson.""

""I-I have to go. It was a pleasure."" 

Samuel continued leaving, but as he did, Aisha looked down, getting a good view of his butt. And with an obscene sense of pleasure, she grew a smile, admiring it.

“Cute. Chief, have you been holding out on me?”

“Please, he's just a guy from a real estate company. Ma promised to sell Pa’s old land. Besides, corporate suits aren’t my type.”

“Oh, yeah, I forgot convicts are.”

Belle seethed, huffing like a wild beast. ”Desmond and I aren't together anymore, but I won’t stand here and have you badmouth him. He paid his debt to society, so layoff.""

Daisy stepped out of the house. ""Guys, Ma and I have breakfast ready.""

As they heard, Belle and Aisha hurried to the house. Belle snarled at Aisha again like a wild beast as they left. But Aisha started laughing, seeing Belle lose her temper.

Carter dragged Daisy away from the others. ""You haven't told them yet that you're Damara, have you?""

""No, but I was planning on it tonight. How bad do you think they're going to take it?""

""I don't know. But I'm with you for the worst.""

Daisy kissed Carter. ""Thank god. Now, come on, I made your favorite strawberry pancakes with bacon.""",1,1753440792.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

As nighttime fell Sarah and Lucas sneaked through the corridors to Carter's room. They both scanned the place vigorously for anyone else but spotted no one. Lucas banged on the wall to summon Daisy, and as she heard his signal, she hurried from behind a corner over to Carter’s room.

“Thanks, guys,” Daisy said.

Inside his room, Daisy hugged Carter.

”Sorry to bother you. But I needed to see you after the day I had.”

“It must have been a pain dealing with that jerk.” Carter placed a hand on Daisy’s cheek.

“Carter, Favian isn't a jerk. It's like what Róngyù said. We’re all under serious pressure. Just today, he helped me with some scared children.”

Carter took a deep breath. “Fine, red, for you. I’ll give the guy a chance. But sometimes I think you're too nice.”

“Thank you.”

Daisy kissed Carter good night. But as she enjoyed his taste in her mouth, she kissed him again. And again, his taste was too much to resist, and she went in for more. As her kisses became more aggressive, the couple tumbled back to Carter's bed, and he lay on her. However, as they were about to begin making love, Daisy transformed into Damara.*”No.”* And sent Carter flying off of her at the door.

\*\*\*

In the corridor, Favian and Yara walked by Carter's room. They talked business but stopped as they saw the door vibrate, sharing a look as they hurried closer to it.

“Sir, isn't that General Carter’s room?” Yara raised her canine ears to listen and gasped. ”By the lawgiver, I hear a woman in there.”

As he heard Yara, Favian immediately considered busting down the door to see what was wrong. But he ultimately decided against it. Favian was too proud to admit it openly, but Carter had proven himself to be a diligent general with the day’s work. He assumed there had to be a reasonable explanation. And, if not, the mission took priority. They couldn’t afford any more delays. However, afterward, he would report Carter if anything remotely obscene surfaced.

Favian exhaled heavily, rubbing his hand over his face. ”Yara, let's pretend we didn't see or hear anything for now.”

“Are you sure, sir?”

Favian nodded.

“If you say so, General Favian.”

\*\*\*

Inside, Daisy held her chest like she had a stroke, breathing heavily. But as Carter saw her, he got off the floor and angrily stomped over, sitting beside Daisy.

“Red, even though I don't personally believe in them. I’m trying my best to respect your religious beliefs.” Carter grabbed Daisy, shaking her vigorously. “So how about you throw me a bone and don't tempt a man.”

“I’m so sorry. I didn't mean to lead you on.” Daisy cried. “I’m garbage.”

Daisy quickly fell on the bed, balling her eyes out. Carter watched, pulling her up and trying to shake her out of it.

*""Daisy, enough. I don’t care anymore.”*

“But look what I did.”

“You slipped up one time. In a lifetime of being a saint.”

“It’s still unforgivable.”

Carter angrily stood up. “I’m in a time loop. I don’t know how many times we’ve had this conversation.”

“What are you talking about?”

“It’s like the talk we had before you got kidnapped. Unless you’re perfect. Unless you sacrifice more than everyone else, you’re never happy.”

“Carter-“

“Why do you always do this to yourself?""

""Because wrong is wrong. If you lie, then it's always okay to lie. Breaking a promise once makes it easier the next time. And now more than ever, I can't afford that."" Daisy took a pillow off the bed and walked from Carter to a corner.

""What are you doing?"" Carter slapped his forehead.

""Finding a nice corner. I can’t risk anyone asking questions about Damara wandering the corridors at night. And I don’t trust myself to sleep in the same bed with you.""

""Daisy, stop. I'll take the corner, and you can have the bed.""

""Carter, there's no way I'll ask you to do t-""

""You're not asking me. I want to do it,"" Carter interrupted.

Daisy looked at Carter, small tear droplets escaping her eyes. ""I don't deserve you.""

Daisy dashed over to Carter, hugging him. She soon took the bed as Carter occupied the corner. And she blew him a kiss goodnight as they drifted off to sleep.

\*\*\*

In outer space, an army of satellites was adrift in the void. They floated around light years apart, casting a vast net around the border to the western planets. But each one soon surged with incredible power. It spread out from them, racing across space. The energy from each satellite quickly collided and merged into one another, forming a colossal wall, standing as a guardian for light years of space.

On planet Aqua, Favian watched Eugene and the other scientists work with bated breath. Eugene and his staff typed like there was no tomorrow on the computers, trying to manage the celestial project. But Eugene quickly finished his work.

Favian hurried over to him. ""Well, Doctor, how is it?""

""The guardian barrier is fully functional, General Favian. The only thing that can pass through it now is United Planets ships. Or an object of astronomical force.""

""Thank you, Dr. Parker. You have earned the gratitude of my people and all the people of the western planets.""

""Don't mention it, General Favian. It was your advanced technology that made my vision possible.” Eugene nervously chuckled. “There was no telling how long it would have taken if I had to make the hardware from scratch.""

Yara ran over to the two. ""General Favian, Damara, is outside the door.""

Hastily, Favian left Eugene for Daisy in the corridor.

""Good morning, General Favian.""

""Same to you, Damara. I hope you slept well.""

""I slept the best I could.” Daisy sighed. “So Yara tells me you want a favor.""

“Yes, I do. But as a general, it's shameful for me to ask.”

“What type of favor is this?”

“It all started sometime after you liberated the earth. Several units of Nemesis soldiers came to Orion, saying they saw through Mavor's lies and wanted to defect.” Favian ran his hand over his face. “We ran every check we could, and it seems they told the truth. So Orion put them under my command.”

“This all sounds wonderful. What’s the problem?”

”The problem is their integration has been a disaster. I keep getting complaints of harassment. And the claims keep getting more serious. So many soldiers in this army refuse to accept them.” Favian exhaled heavily. “Damara, I’ve failed to discipline my forces, but maybe the hero of our galaxy will have better luck. Please give them a talk.” 

“I understand. And I think you're a splendid general for asking for help.”

Daisy presented Favian with a handshake, and he accepted it with a small smile.

\*\*\*

Outside, Carter’s Lieutenant walked through the base, scanning the military personnel hurrying to finish their jobs. Scars from his many years of fighting as a juvenile delinquent, and then, a soldier covered his face and body. Clive, twenty-four, Caucasian, was a tall, muscular human man with spiky white hair and pale purple eyes. But he soon spotted his brother in arms through the chaos. As he saw Carter commanding his soldiers, his mind wandered back to two years ago.

It was a pitch-black night during the siege on darkhold. The only stable source of light was the bombardment from the Nemesis forces. And much like the present, military personnel hurried to finish their jobs, racing against time. But the crucial difference was Carter was not in command.

Clive looked at his fellow soldiers with agita as panic ran through the army.

*""I need orders. Who's giving orders?""*

“That's Captain Carter’s job. But there's something wrong with him. It's like he's a dead man.”

“We’re all going to be dead men and women if we don't figure out something now.”

Another bombardment hit their camp. It ignited a colossal inferno, bathing the land in heat. The flames rushed the area, consuming all in their path, and the soldiers tried desperately to extinguish them. But as Clive saw his comrades struggle, he hurried to Carter's tent. And he found his friend collapsed on the ground, a dead man, but only dead inside as his spirit was crushed.

""Carter, you need to get out there now. If you don't lead us, we'll all die,"" Clive said.

""Who cares? Nothing matters.""

""Brother, I understand you loved her, but Daisy wouldn't want this. She wouldn't want to be the death of you.” Clive stooped down to Carter. “Let alone the death of all the people that will follow if we fail.""

""Death is the keyword. It makes everything meaningless. I've tried my whole life to fight it, but now it's time to give up.""

Carter started to cry, but as Clive saw him, he looked at him, fuming. He hoisted Carter by the neck and made him look him in the eye directly at his glare.

""I'll say it one more time. She wouldn’t want this. She wouldn't want people to die because of her. She wouldn't want you to give up on all hope.” Clive tossed Carter back onto the ground. “If you loved her, do the right thing.""

""Y-you're right, my friend. But I'm not strong enough to do this alone anymore.""

""Say no more."" Clive extended a helping hand.

As Carter took his hand, he was shakey, falling over himself as he labored to stand. But Clive quickly helped him up, and together, the two walked outside to face the battle. However, as Clive recalled the night, the past faded from his mind. And he hurried over to present-day Carter.

""Hey, Carter. Oh, sorry, I'm supposed to refer to you by your fancy rank now, right?""

The two young men stepped forward and simultaneously swung from the hip as if to land a punch, but their hands slapped together in a gesture of friendship, their forearms bulging, testing each other's strength.

""You got that right, rogers. I won't let anyone erode discipline, let alone my lieutenant. Everyone’s going to earn their keep.""

""You'll go hard even on a friend?""

""Especially for my friends.""

They continued the contest, and Carter had the edge, gradually forcing Clive's arm downward. And Clive cracked a smile as he lost.

""Happy to see you back to normal.""

""Thank you, my friend.""

""I'm going over to the field. I have the itch to get a little training in.""

""Please, do.” Carter laughed. “You could use it.""

""Funny."" Clive gave a fake chuckle.

Later, Clive arrived at the training field. He found massive weights, weighing three hundred pounds each, and swiftly picked up a pair with little effort. But Clive dropped them, spotting a mesmerizing sight. He saw another combatant training close by, Ros, a beautiful Nemesis woman.

Every night I fall asleep, with you on my mind. And you the first thing I check-on when I wake. I dream how it could be, How a walk through a farmers market would feel, with you on my arm. Exploring every shop, learning more about your interests, likes, and dislikes. What that first sip of coffee would taste like, as we sit down to discuss meaningful topics of your heart. I wonder if I would even taste the food, as I sit to share a meal with you to listen, as I discover your desires and goals. I wonder how the sun would glisten off of your skin as we overlook the grounds sitting on a park bench. I wonder how it would feel, to correct your silky smooth hair from that gust of wind that blew it in your face.

I wonder as are eyes lock, did I miss read any cues? Was that her biting her lip? Did I hear a soft moan ,as I drew her closer?
Is that her heart trying to escape her body, as our chests collide into each other? Is her face flushed too?, As our bodies are in control of our minds at present, reacting to the pheromones we emit. Does she want this too, as I caress her face and draw my lips close. I pause a few inches away to glance to her eyes, to her lips, back to eyes.

We play no attention to a second gust of wind that blow some hair on her lips Does she want this too? Yes I’m sure, her eyes begin to close, her head starts to tilt slightly to the side. I can feel her breath as she exhales on my lips. My heart beat is deafening, as time starts to slow down. Our bodies are out of control as if gravity is pulling us towards one another. I start to close my eyes too, to remove that sensation to give all of my attention to the smell of her hair, the sweet odor of her skin , her hands grasping on my body as if we were in a flood, holding on for dear life. I need to remember the touch of her skin, I want to feel every crease of her lips as we….

Bzzz bzzz bzzz bzzz of the alarm awakes me. I am confused? As I lay in bed, I feel no, body lying by me. Absent is the  soft symphony of exhales and inhales. Alone in a cold dark room. Why am I sweating? Why is my heart racing as if I ran a marathon.

1m8vvmd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDock/comments/1m8vvmd/indiauk_signed_a_free_trade_agreement_key/,India-UK signed a Free Trade Agreement: Key Highlights and Fineprint,"The two countries signed a Free Trade Agreement. The FTA took more than three years of negotiations, with talks spanning over 15 formal rounds 

**Here are some of the important fineprint:**

99% of Indian exports to the UK now get zero-duty access, covering nearly all trade value. India will cut tariffs on 90% of British products, with 85% of these becoming completely tariff-free within ten years.

Key Sectors Benefited:

* **Indian exports**: Major beneficiaries include textiles, marine products, leather, footwear, gems and jewellery, engineering goods, auto components, sports goods, organic chemicals, rubber, plastics, tea, coffee, and spices. Tariff rates that were previously as high as 20% are now reduced to zero for most of these goods.
* **UK exports**: Tariffs on whisky and gin fall from 150% to 75% immediately, and to 40% over 10 years. Tariffs on British automobiles drop from 110% to 10% under a quota. Cosmetics, chocolates, lamb, salmon, soft drinks, and medical devices also see substantial cuts.

Gradual and Calibrated Opening

* **Sensitive Sectors**: Sensitive Indian agricultural products (e.g. dairy), as well as certain industrial goods (plastics, etc.), are on an “exclusion list,” shielding them from immediate tariff reduction or elimination.
* **Phased Tariff Reductions**: Duties on some strategic items are removed or reduced gradually (over a decade or phased via quotas), ensuring Indian industries have time to adjust to competition.

Public Procurement & Services

* **Government Procurement**: UK businesses are classified as “Class 2 suppliers” when at least 20% of their product/service value comes from the UK, giving them access to India’s vast public procurement market (\~40,000 tenders, £38 billion).
* **Professional Mobility**: Enhanced provisions for Indian professionals (contractual service suppliers, business visitors, intra-corporate transferees, independent professionals) including simpler visa pathways and mutual recognition of professional qualifications.
* **Double Contributions Convention (DCC)**: Ensures portability of social security benefits for professionals moving between the two countries and prevents double social security taxation for assignments up to three years.

Services, Digital, and ESG Commitments

* **Services Sector Opening**: India ensures improved and fairer access across financial services, environmental services, construction, IT/ITeS, education, and other business services.
* **Digital Trade**: Commitments to compatibility between digital systems, paperless and expedited trade procedures.
* **ESG (Environment, Social, Governance)** & Development:
   * First Indian FTA to include dedicated chapters on gender equality, labour rights, anti-corruption, and development cooperation.
   * Joint commitments to climate cooperation, support for clean energy, and circular economy sectors.

Agricultural and Food Safety Standards

* **Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures**: Streamlining regulatory requirements for food and agricultural trade to facilitate faster market access, but all UK imports must still meet India’s regulatory standards. UK food and drink imported to India must comply with Indian import rules and vice versa.

Geographical Indications and Cultural Products

* **Mutual Protection**: Both nations offer recognition and protection of “Geographical Indication” (GI) products like Assam tea, Darjeeling tea, Scotch whisky, and more.

Market Safeguards

* **Safeguard Mechanisms**: Specific mechanisms are in place to review the agreement and address unforeseen surges in imports, protecting sensitive sectors if required.

Exclusions & Missed Issues

* **Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) Not Covered**: The FTA does not address the EU’s or UK’s planned CBAM. This means Indian steel and aluminium exports remain vulnerable to additional tariffs tied to carbon intensity.
* **Exclusion Lists**: Dairy, select agricultural items, and sensitive industrial goods remain off-limits for immediate tariff elimination, protecting India's domestic interests.",4,1753440333.0,TheDock,0,1.0,False

We are a family of two, both in our late 40s. Not terribly keen on nightlife and the big city buzz (we currently live in a small town south of London). Our son is now 22 and lives on his own in London.

What matters to us, as a family, is, in order of priority:  
\- Access to nice areas to walk/cycle in (walking for my wife, road cycling for me)  
\- A fairly quick and uncongested road to the airport for me; access to public transport for my wife.  
\- Security  
\- A squash club nearby  
\- Would be great to be within walking distance from a nice, friendly coffee shop and, perhaps, something like a small Tesco/Sainsbury.  
\- Access to open water (the sea or a river etc.)  
\- Reasonable distance from a town centre for when the mood takes us (not often)

With this in mind, could you please help me understand why we would go for Glasgow over Aberdeen, or the other way round? And which areas would you be looking at?

We only want a one-bed, max two-bed, nothing fancy.

Basically a PWD (couple?) went to starbucks and ordered their drinks. The guy showed his PWD ID sa barista and the barista mistakenly wrote ""Speech"" dun sa coffee cup which is the disability of the guy (Speech Language Impairment) instead of his name.

And oh my god the comments section. It's as if the barista spat on the drink and poisoned them haha

I seriously believe na its just an honest mistake, even I when I first checked yung ID ""Speech"" yung una kong nakita. Pano pa kung busy during that time and nagmamadali yung barista.
I wholeheartedly do not believe na the barista was mocking them or trying to be funny or whatever. its a mistake.

Like, that “don’t even look at me” kind of moody.

I know, it’s just a hair mask. But honestly, sometimes the little fixes matter most. Let’s get into it.

# Why I Even Bothered

My hair’s been impossible the past couple of weeks.

* Super bleached (it’s seen better days, lol).
* Dry and fluffy in the heat, strands doing that “I refuse to stick together” thing.
* Needs a trim, but who has time?
* Also, I can’t drown it in product, my scalp hates it, and next-day hair becomes a crunchy disaster.

Most of my usual conditioners help *only* on wash day, and by day two, it’s like… hello, haystack. So yeah, I went hunting.

# What I Picked Up

I grabbed the **Pantene Keratin Protect Mask** from Superdrug (about £6). It’s the special edition Keith Haring one (honestly, could not care less about the packaging, but hey).

A few things to know right off the bat:

* It claims to be “repairing\*”  the asterisk means “at surface level.”
* Translation: don’t expect deep, life-changing repair.
* But I just wanted hair that looks nice, not a spiritual hair transformation.

# How I Used It (A Little Ritual)

Before masking, I always use my trusty **Living Proof Clarifying Shampoo.** it basically resets my hair by stripping every last bit of buildup.

* Pro tip: don’t use it too often (once a week is enough).
* It’s about £16 for a travel size (pricey but worth it, imo).

Then, onto the mask itself:

* It feels rich and creamy, not heavy or greasy.
* Left it on for \~10 minutes (I was scrolling, time flew by).

# The Results: Better Than £6 Should Be

When I rinsed it out, honestly, my hair felt:

* Smoother
* Sleeker
* Less fluffy
* More separated, as in strands weren’t trying to run away from each other

The next morning, it still looked good. And here’s the shocker:

* It’s now **day 3 post-wash** and my hair isn’t fluffy or crunchy.
* That never happens.

So yes  even if the benefits are just surface-level, I’m impressed.

# The Good & The Meh

**What I liked:**

* Super affordable (about the same price as two coffees).
* Doesn’t weigh hair down.
* Quick fix for bad hair weeks.
* Nice texture  feels pampering without being greasy.

**What’s meh:**

* Won’t fix deep damage (let’s be real).
* Asterisks on the packaging everywhere (kind of makes you roll your eyes).

# Would I Buy Again?

Yep. I mean, it’s £6  even if it just makes my bleached hair look a bit nicer on chaotic weeks, that’s a win.

Also thinking of trying the Pantene Keratin Repair Mask next, just to compare.

# Final Thoughts

If your hair is bleached, processed, or just going through a rough patch and you don’t want to spend a fortune  the Pantene Keratin Protect Mask is a solid “keep it in the cupboard” product.

It won’t work miracles, but for those of us who sometimes just need hair to behave *for a few days*, it delivers.",1,1753439619.0,u_Known_Economist_3791,0,1.0,False
1m8vn41,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1m8vn41/day_10/,Day 10,"Well, would you look at that... Day 10. 

So brief history. Was a weekend binger and daily to buzz drinker, that escalated over many years. Random sobriety usually short lived. Long during and after pregnancy a couple of years. Then on and off for the last 3. Was back to mostly daily to at least buzz again by the last couple of months and some decent binges a couple of times a week such as 6 pack, bottle of wine or two and some night cap shots because my tolerance was definetly back but my capacity for no hangovers was no longer. Anyway that's just an into for those that can relate. 

Experience so far. 

Cravings Day 1, 2, 4, 8 & 9. Thoughts most days but I eyeballs myself and I submitted to sober for a while. 

Herbal tea, tasty drinks, lots of water helped. Cooking good food helped. 

Did a big spring clean which was a great distraction but I craved my usual reward. I rewarded myself with blueberries in custard with grated chocolate instead. 

Felt dehydrated until Day 4 no mater how much electrolytes. Few days if insomnia but not sure if binge watching a new good show was to blame or sobriety. Either way I woke up feeling crap, but not hungover so big win, coffee alone solved it and ai was good an hour later. Constipation was lame but solved with pear juice and a hot water bottle and finally getting a good night's sleep.  Had some headaches along the way, and even in the non crave days I was short tempered and snappy and disconnected but that has settled a bit now. 

Getting into the groove and happier. Glad to be approaching the weekend ahead with no hangover. It's Friday night here. Going to likely binge on chocolate, Netflix and some rosehip tea. 

Hope this helps others reading to get some ideas on what their days might look like. Some were better than others but I kept distracted. Reading here helped a tonne especially experiential posts. So I thought ai would put this out there to keep the Karmatic circle in swing.  Thanks to all.

1m8vlhy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ManicRealism/comments/1m8vlhy/day_2_the_city_is_a_theater_without_an_audience/,Day 2 — The City Is a Theater Without an Audience,"Diary Entry – Day 2

Today the city looked different.

Not new. Not changed.
Just unmasked.
I saw the Machines (A. Bardeau's Sidenote: I.V. uses the word ""Machines"" to refer to ""People"") walking and talking beneath blinking advertisements, their shoes clicking rhythmically, metronomically. But they weren’t walking to a destination. Just in motion.
Simulating urgency.
Mimicking purpose.
I tracked a man in a gray overcoat who coughed at precise intervals.
Each cough took 7 seconds.
He paused at a corner, sneezed, glanced at his watch, tugged on his tie, and continued.
He didn’t even look up.
None of them do.
Not even when the sky cracks.

I took a seat on a rusty bench in front of the public transit screen. It displayed the words:
> “Please Go To Your Point of Meaning”


""Look, Dad! What does that say?"" as a young girl read on the screen, and turned to her father.

> “What does it mean?”

The Dad said:
“It means the bus is late.”
She nodded, smiled, and her eyes went all the way blank.

---

> “It’s not the emptiness of the world that is tragic. It’s that it is filled with signs that mean absolutely nothing.”
I.V.'s margin note on a ticket stub

NEW ENCOUNTER I – CAELEN VERACHT, Philosopher of Convulsions (as Ilyas Varamyr [Abbrev'd: I.V.] referred to him)


He was waiting to meet me on the platform of a metro stop, hunched over a notebook that looked as though it was leaking.
So when I asked him what he (I.V.) wrote, he replied:
> “Footnotes to a suicide I haven’t committed yet.”

He gifted me with the manuscript of his monograph: “Discontinuity as Moral Hygiene”.
I haven’t opened it to this day. The cover reeks of antiseptic and rust.
We talked for 13 minutes about how people confuse submission with sanity.

Then he added something that stuck to me like ammonia fumes:
> “Insanity is not deviation. It’s the refusal to lie in a fake society.”



He exited before my stop. I collapsed and threw up behind a column.
No one looked.

Encounter II – Madame Espinosa The Bride of Fog

(Possibly Hallucinated)
She is seen in windows and shiny surfaces only.
Her dress remains soaking, and the ink drips backwards, apparently.

She writes with a finger in the fog of a glass:
> “STOP FAKING BEING HERE.”
Then she disappears.


I attempted to contact her through a mirror today.
I shattered it instead.
My hand bled into an amalgamation of Words in Blood which I could not read.

---

> “When the body is in pain, it is speaking a tongue the soul was never granted.”
— I.V., graffiti found in a bathroom stall, and scratched into porcelain

New Encounter III: The Bone Librarian
(Dream/Fever/Hallucination?)

He protects a library composed completely of volumes bound in human skin.
On each volume, “Ilyas Varamyr” is written in different handwriting.
He says:

> “You are footnoted in every system you refused.
As I scream, he catalogues the scream by pitch, binds the scream in vellum.
He showed me a ledger:
“YOU OWE REALITY AN APOLOGY,” it read in Latin.
I struck through it and scrawled the word: “Send it my best regards.”

---

Aphorism:
> ”Once you stop pretending to be coherent, you will be called mentally ill.

Closing note of Day 2
Anton,
If, as I intended, you are reading this, please don’t publish this.
No one needs to know.
But you will, because I see the hunger in your eyes, too.
> The longing to finally hear a man say:
“None of it mattered, and I still survived.”
