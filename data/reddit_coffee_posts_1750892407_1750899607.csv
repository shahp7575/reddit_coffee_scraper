I'm 29M, living on the East Coast, huge nerd and night owl (I just had coffee and it's like 9pm, rip me). I'm usually on during different times of the day. I'm semi-new to league but been having a blast learning/being bad. I usually spam Swiftplay and ranked (bronze 3 atm baaaby). I'm playing mid/top mostly but would be down to play any role (except Jungle, fuck that), if we wanted to duo bot! If you don't mind a noob then we can definitely get our league on. An honorable mention is Valorant, though it's been a while since I've been on (played best when drunk of course).   
  
I'm a very non-rage/chill type of gamer and don't mind if you're bad or new, though I do find it fun to constantly push myself to get better. I'm more of a ""There's always something you can improve on - what could I have done better in that moment/match?"" type of gamer, rather than ""Wow I got the absolute worst teammates and they completely lost me the game"".   
  
I'm a fan of VC, dark humor and banter, and hopefully you are too. Yappers welcome haha. Last thing of importance to mention, **please be around my age**. Hope to hear from you soon:)",1,1750899442.0,GamerPals,1,1.0,False

The Volcano route, quarry and peripheral areas are close to playable; the main farm, Ginger island farm and desert are fairly laggy and stuttery. It got a bit worse recently when I planted 4 coffee beans in the green house to be able to do the three days of collection at a quicker pace, which seems to have been a little bit too much stress for the console. The 1.6 Switch stutters are there, but I'm on the edge of what it is capable of. Harvesting in the rain or on cherry blossom days? Oof. Sure it's not 384 pigs bad, honestly it's not SUPER noticeable, but it .awesome efficiently running across, dropping 2 rows, turning around and running again annoying at times.

I may return eventually and wrap this up, but here are the stats as I walk away.

Decided not to tap the spa more than a few rows as it seems pathways and fences don't stop the debris spread there.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Inter Milan vs. River Plate: A Tense Tango of Tactics**  
June 26, 2025 | Lumen Field | Kickoff: 1:00 AM UTC (22:00 Bras√≠lia Time)

**The Setup:**  
Imagine two overly prepared accountants settling a coffee debt with a high-stakes chess match. That‚Äôs this game. Both Inter Milan (4 points) and River Plate (4 points) arrive undefeated in Group E, but with the pride of a team that *technically* won but *literally* coughed up a goal to Urawa Reds (Inter 2-1) and River‚Äôs Monterrey 0-0 draw. The bookmakers? They‚Äôre throwing their hands up: **Inter is a slight favorite at 2.1 (FanDuel)**, while River Plate‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take the underdog and a sandwich‚Äù odds sit at 4.25 (BetRivers). The Draw? A 3.0 middle ground for those who distrust both teams‚Äô emotional maturity.

**The Playbook:**  
Per CBS Sports‚Äô Brandt Sutton, this will be a *‚Äúdefensive masterpiece where the highlight reel is a particularly aggressive slide tackle.‚Äù* Expect a midfield meat grinder, counterattacks that move at the pace of a post-lunch Zoom call, and a final score that makes your grandma say, ‚Äú*That‚Äôs how you win friends and influence people.*‚Äù The **Under 2.5 goals** is a 1.87 favorite (Bovada), because neither team trusts their defense more than they trust their accountant.

**Props to Watch:**

* **Lautaro Martinez (-137) to score anytime**: The Inter star‚Äôs odds are shorter than a day in tax season. If he doesn‚Äôt net, bookmakers will probably cry.
* **River Plate Over 3.5 shots on target (+200)**: The Argentinian side took 18 shots on Monterrey. If they don‚Äôt hit 4+ quality attempts here, their striker Miguel Borja (-141 to score) will be writing a LinkedIn post titled *‚ÄúWhy I Left the Club World Cup for a Quiet Life in Patagonia.‚Äù*
* **Martinez Over 2.5 shots (-435)**: He‚Äôs a -435 machine in this category. If he doesn‚Äôt hit it, the sportsbooks might just fold up and go home.

**The Verdict:**  
This is a **1-0 Inter win** in extra time, decided by a Lautaro Martinez penalty that‚Äôs so clinical it makes the goalkeeper question his life choices. River Plate will have 4+ shots on target (per their prop), but Inter‚Äôs defense‚Äîled by Alessandro Bastoni (+3300 to score, because *why not?*)‚Äîwill look like a spreadsheet built for maximum efficiency.

**Betting Line of the Day:**  
Take the **Under 2.5 goals at 1.87 (Bovada)**. It‚Äôs the only bet that survives this game‚Äôs emotional whiplash.

*Final Note:* If you bet on River Plate to win, you‚Äôre either a masochist or a fan of dramatic comebacks. Do it anyway. The chaos is free.

Last year, 3 of my best friends got engaged and planned weddings for 2025. My parents also get married this fall, so I‚Äôm involved in 4 weddings and celebrations associated. (Fake name) Ella was the last one to get engaged, so everyone else had picked their dates and were on my calendar. I also had an international trip that I wanted to plan, but didn‚Äôt know the specifics yet. It took Ella months to pick a date, because of complications finding a venue and reception location that would work out. So in the mean time, I‚Äôm adding things to my calendar, including the long vacation. This was going to be a wedding I had to travel far for, so I said if the wedding was the weekend before my parents wedding (which I‚Äôm taking an entire week off for to also travel), I told her I would not be able to be there. I also let her know my international vacation was booked and I was unavailable for 2.5 weeks. 

She proceeded to lose it on me, saying she thought I would be the friend to make this about her, especially because she asked me to be her MOH. Apparently my international vacation was during the exact timeframe she wanted to book her wedding, which was less than 6 months away at that point and I had no clue what specific weekend she wanted and I was soooo tired of waiting on her. She told me I was ‚Äúfull of shit, speaking bullshit, and was a negligent friend,‚Äù because of it. Along with other hateful things, she eventually apologized because I told her she was being mean.

Things were weird for a solid month after. I felt distant from her, but time heals things and we got back to normal. So we started planning her bachelorette party. I‚Äôve basically done it all, spent hours looking at locations to go to, then hours on Airbnb, booked everything (restaurants, plans), designed the virtual invite, and kept the group chat lively. 

Unfortunately, three weeks ago a girl bailed and Ella was devastated. Here‚Äôs where things turned.

Background for the schedule: The bachelorette is in one month. The Airbnb opens Thursday, everyone is getting there at 4pm, except me. I‚Äôm landing at 11:30am to set up. We have plans all night Thursday, all day Friday, all day Saturday until 9p.m. and then check-out is Sunday morning. My dad happens to live in the same town we are traveling to, so I told her instead of leaving the Airbnb Sunday morning at 6am to go to his house, I‚Äôm going to leave before bed Saturday night at 10pm.

She proceeds to tell me she is basically devastated, hurt, and really upset that I would sacrifice my time with her to see my dad. But she ‚Äúunderstands.‚Äù I apologized sincerely, emphasized that my dad is going through a hard time (veteran, PTSD) and I just need to balance my responsibilities and I would like to wake up and have coffee with him Sunday (I leave Tuesday) so I‚Äôd have two full days with him, and 2.5 with her. She proceeds to ask me ‚Äúif I could make a request, you would leave Sunday and not Saturday. Because you‚Äôre the life of the party and it‚Äôll change once you‚Äôre gone.‚Äù Meanwhile, our only plans were a sunset watch on the last night and going home.  So, I drew a boundary and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry this is the decision I‚Äôm making.‚Äù 

She then continues to come after my character, saying I‚Äôm a flawed friend and it‚Äôs frustrating that I‚Äôm not good at setting boundaries in a healthy way. She questioned my intentions about picking the location of her party to see my dad instead‚Ä¶? Even though she picked the location out of a list of 6 places I gave her (California included). Basically questioned my loyalty to her, brought up the fact that I‚Äôm taking 4 days to go with my step mom on her bachelorette but I can‚Äôt give her the same amount of time. She said she wondered why she was at odds about being so upset about my decision, because I have no empathy for her and won‚Äôt allow her to be upset. Even thought I apologized profusely in the beginning that she was sad about it.

All because I want to leave Saturday at 10pm instead of Sunday at 6am to see my father. 

I feel done. I‚Äôve invested so much time and money into somebody who feels completely okay making me feel like a piece of shit for trying to balance priorities from multiple people in my life. I feel so different about our friendship and her, and at this point, I don‚Äôt want to be part of the wedding. I‚Äôm debating not showing up to the bachelorette in one month. 

We haven‚Äôt spoken In two days.

AITA if I step down and completely out?

TLDR; the bride has flipped on me multiple times in the last year for her own personal problems. She continually degrades me and says I‚Äôm a shitty friend - so now I want out of the wedding. ",1,1750898797.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

1lkmcf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSystemSmiles/comments/1lkmcf5/chapter_3_mysterious_stranger/,Chapter 3: Mysterious Stranger,"‚ÄúHoly shit!‚Äù Mike jolted upright. He was a blur of hand motion as he patted himself down, making sure he was in one piece. All he remembered was the feeling of cold, razor-sharp teeth, piercing into his flesh before everything went black. It was, by his count, the third time he had died, and honestly, he was getting pretty sick of being killed in such horrific fashion.

He sat in bed for a moment, wondering if he should even get out of it. What was the point if everything outside was just going to kill him? If this was purgatory, whatever religion sent him here had a bizarre and sick sense of humor. He moved his legs over the side of the bed, planting them onto the floor.

The cold floor provided him with a sense of being grounded. He found that at least a little comforting. Standing up, he went straight to the door in the room. He already knew what would be on the other side, and sure enough there it was. Yet another bowl of mushy food and a glass of water.

‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt you at least get me some coffee?‚Äù Mike condescendingly stated.

‚ÄúMy apologies, I wasn‚Äôt sure what you drank, and water seemed to be the most neutral of the choices I could provide.‚Äù A man standing in the doorway to the other room stated flatly. The accent was unusual; it sounded like the worst attempt of someone trying to play a Canadian who was trying to play an American with a dixie drawl.

Mike nearly jumped out of his skin at the voice. He grabbed the spoon and leapt out of his chair, backing up towards the kitchen.

‚ÄúI assure you, I mean you no harm. I don‚Äôt have much in the way of utensils though, so if you could not destroy the spoon, I would appreciate it.‚Äù The man spoke in a calming tone.

Mike, trying to put on an air of bravery, squeaked out ‚ÄúWho‚Ä¶ who are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy name is Lezondre Arcylos, I am one of the keepers.‚Äù The man said.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck is a keeper, and how are you speaking English?‚Äù Mike replied, trying to sound a bit gruffer, but coming across as a teen who just hit puberty standing up to his father for the first time.

‚ÄúI am not sure what English is,‚Äù Lezondre replied as he stepped out of the doorway. ‚ÄúBut, I have a tool that allows me to translate my words into thoughts you are able to understand. As for the keepers, we find those people who are misplaced and keep them safe until they are ready to go on their way.‚Äù

As he stepped out into the light of the main room, Mike was able to finally get a good view of Lezondre. He had been wearing a flowing cloak with a hood, what appeared to be leather clothing, and carried a single sword at his side. His skin was a rich olive color; his hair was a deep black that was slicked back and about shoulder length. He was exceedingly handsome, with high cheekbones, brown eyes that held a tint of red, and the unmarked skin of youth. He had wide shoulders and a narrow waist and stood well above Mike. He must have been at least 6‚Äô2‚Äù, he guessed.

Mike felt this uncontrollable hatred at seeing this guy. ‚ÄúNo one should be this ridiculously good-looking, tall, and well-built‚Äù he thought to himself.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean translate into thoughts?‚Äù Mike asked in a confused tone.

‚ÄúWell, you see my lips move and you think you are hearing what I am saying, but you wouldn‚Äôt understand the sounds I would make. So, I am using a device that transmits my sounds directly into the minds of those around me, allowing them to understand what I am saying.‚Äù Lezondre pulled a small, roundish, magnet-like object off his neck and showed it to Mike.

After he removed the device, he began to speak; it was almost like a series of harsh vowel-laden grunts with an occasional roll of the tongue. Placing the device back on his neck, he continued. ‚ÄúSo, as you see, it just transmits the idea I am trying to convey, and your own mind interprets it in a way that is familiar to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen it also acts as an interpreter when you are listening to people as well?‚Äù Mike asked.

‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù Lezondre nodded.

‚ÄúCan you explain to me one other thing?‚Äù Mike asked nervously.

‚ÄúI can try,‚Äù Lezondre responded.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù Mike began before exploding, ‚Äúwhere the fuck am I and why do things keep killing me?‚Äù

Lezondre began to laugh. It was a full belly laugh. Mike looked dismayed for a moment. After a minute of laughter, that somehow felt like 10 minutes, Lezondre finally stopped. ‚ÄúOnce again, I apologize, but I do find some similarity in the misplaced.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat exactly are the ‚Äòmisplaced?‚Äô‚Äù Mike asked.

Lezondre took a moment to collect his thoughts before beginning, ‚ÄúThe misplaced are those, for lack of a better word, sophonts or species, that are brought to this place through no means of their own.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, is this place like purgatory? Do the keepers guide souls to resolve their mortal conflicts and go to heaven like in the religious stories?‚Äù Mike asked thoughtfully. ‚ÄúI guess, what I am asking is, are you an angel?‚Äù

Lezondre, teetering on the brink of laughter, caught himself. ‚ÄúNo, it is nothing like that. We keepers have an area of influence. When a misplaced comes into that area, we guide them enough that they can become a productive member of society. Whether that means a gardener, a stonemason, or even a knight in service of a realm, we give you some training that you need to push you in whatever direction you want to go.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, your job, looking like the handsome knight about to rescue the fair maiden trapped in a tower, is‚Ä¶ vocational counselor?‚Äù Mike chuckled to himself.

Lezondre, processing the thoughts, responded ‚ÄúI suppose one could say that, but it is more of a holy calling than that.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs what my college girlfriend said when she became a performance art major, now she serves coffee to hipsters in Westwood‚Ä¶,‚Äù Mike let out a despondent reply as he recalled those memories from college. He thought about how he had met Zoey when they first got to college; how they would hang around in the college dining hall talking for hours about nothing.

She had originally wanted to be a social worker, but after the first year decided to make a switch to performance art after what she said was a divine revelation to her. Halfway through the school year, Mike realized that divine revelation really meant some guy named Eric, and that was the end of his college relationship.

Mike realized that he had trailed off at the end of his statement, ‚ÄúBut, I don‚Äôt put much stock in anything deemed as being holy.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, everyone gets to choose what they believe; I am just a guide.‚Äù Lezondre said.

‚ÄúOkay, all wise and powerful guide,‚Äù Mike snickered, ‚ÄúWhy do I keep feeling like I am dying and waking up in this bed constantly?‚Äù

‚ÄúYour soul is bound right now, until you complete the trial of passage, you will remain stuck in the valley, no matter how many times you die, you will always come back to this bed. There will always be food, always be water, always be plenty of sun.‚Äù Lezondre seemed to take on a more serious tone, ‚ÄúThe misplaced are bound initially until we can guide them out. Some choose to stay in those places forever, or at least until they are driven mad enough to choose to attempt to leave. But once you cross the soul barrier, you can‚Äôt come back, and when you die, it is permanent. That is why you need to be ready.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, that sounds horrifying! What sort of twisted divine being would create a mess of a world like that?‚Äù Mike seemed bewildered at the idea that there was something that could force people into coming back to life again and again.

‚ÄúI am not sure who created it, but for us that are born here, I would imagine that the world is, more-or-less, the same as on yours. We are born, we grow, we learn, we fall in love, grow old, and die. My goal is to get you ready,‚Äù he finished with an almost flourish to his monologue.

‚ÄúWell, I am not sure where to start? Can I choose to be a TV lackey?‚Äù Mike calmly stated.

‚ÄúI am not sure what that means,‚Äù replied Lezondre.

‚ÄúFair enough, do you have books, maybe some videos I can watch and make a choice? Okay, maybe not the videos, but at least some books?‚Äù Mike gave a small grin. He often found amusement in the dumbest things he would say. He found it drove those around him crazy as they assumed they were caught in some sort of inside joke.  
  
Lezondre pulled a book out of a bag that seemed far too small to hold it along with one of the magnet-button things that was on his neck. He handed them both to Mike. The tome was of an unwieldy size, like one of those oversized dictionaries that every English major had to impress their peers. ‚ÄúJust hold the device to your neck and it will affix itself to the proper spot. It can‚Äôt be removed except by the person that puts it on, or the person who finds your corpse. You will need it to communicate with the locals as they won‚Äôt have a device of their own.‚Äù

After placing the book on the table, Mike looked at the device in his hand. It was a smooth, small disc, no bigger than a bottlecap. He slowly raised it to his neck and gently placed it against his skin. At first, he didn‚Äôt feel anything. Then suddenly it felt like hundreds of needles piercing into his skin. ‚ÄúShit, this hurts,‚Äù Mike yelped. The pain subsided soon enough.

‚ÄúWith that, I must be going for now,‚Äù Lezondre said. ‚ÄúI will return in about three cycles of the sun and bring some fresh clothing and some better foods. In the meantime, I would suggest you read the book. It contains knowledge about many things that will be helpful and some lessons on skills you may find useful. If you choose to go out, be aware that there are creatures here that will kill you, they aren‚Äôt particularly strong, but neither are you. Stay to the south of the cabin if you intend to do any combat training and never fall asleep in the grass.‚Äù

Mike looked at him for a moment and then responded, ‚ÄúThanks, I‚Äôll try to get my bearings here and see what I can do with this tome. I am curious though, in this world, can I choose to be a hero?‚Äù

Lezondre shook his head in a sign of exasperation and walked out the door without replying.

Mike stood there for a moment as the door closed. He pulled out the wooden chair and sat down at the table. ‚ÄúGuess now is as good a time to start as ever.‚Äù¬†*As he opened the book a single thought came creeping into his mind:*¬†***good luck!***",1,1750897994.0,TheSystemSmiles,0,1.0,False
1lkmbet,https://www.reddit.com/r/pchelp/comments/1lkmbet/drive_seemingly_reformatted_itself_and_i_am_now/,Drive seemingly reformatted itself and I am now unable to reinstall Windows.,"Hello,

I've had my build for about a year and a half at this point, and a few days ago I was browsing YouTube, got up to grab a cup of coffee, and came back and my screen was completely frozen, with no inputs being able to be performed, I went ahead and restarted and then it just stopped at the motherboard boot up screen with a couple options, not going to Windows.

I go into BIOS, my M.2 drive is not there anymore, I wait a little bit, it's back again, however it's failing its self-tests, I move it to another m.2 slot on my motherboard, it starts succeeding its self tests. At this point I figured it may have formatted itself or something, which obviously not great but it seemingly works, so I go ahead and get a Windows Media Tool USB, which boots up like normal, now instead of reinstalling at first, I tried to repair, I run chkdsk, then where I guess I messed it all up I run diskpart to try to get unto my drive; nothing really works so I restart my PC deciding to reinstall Windows; after which on the boot order the USB drive shows as ""Partition 1"".

I try to boot it that way, it gets stuck on the Windows logo now until it eventually goes to a dark blue screen till the computer turns itself off, so I say ok, let me get a new USB drive then, as the one I was using was rather old. I go ahead and install the media on it, pop it in, also shows as partition 1, and it does the same exact stuck on Windows logo problem

At this point, I'm really running out of ideas. I try fiddling with the different CSM settings, enabled, disabled, UEFI, legacy; nothing. I even went ahead and flashed my BIOS to the newest version, which that part went smoothly, but then the exact same problem. At this point I'm not even sure if it's my M.2 or even my motherboard that's having the problem, if even the USB drives aren't working. Only thing I can think is to restart my BIOS by reseating the CMOS battery, but besides that I'm lost.

Hope anyone has any advice, I'm legit stump and exhausted of trying to solve this problem.

Thanks.

1lkmb80,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Total_Percentage1871/comments/1lkmb80/better_without_you/,Better without you.,"There was a guy named Marcus, steady, loyal, and the kind of man who gave everything in a relationship. For three years, he was with Tiana, a beautiful girl with a magnetic smile and a habit of never being satisfied. He loved her deeply. Gave her time, attention, loyalty‚Äîeverything he thought love meant.

But Tiana cheated. She blamed boredom, said she ‚Äúneeded to feel alive again,‚Äù as if Marcus‚Äôs quiet love wasn‚Äôt enough. The truth came out in the ugliest way‚Äîscreenshots, whispers from mutual friends, and finally, her half-hearted confession.

Marcus was shattered. Not because she left, but because he stayed too long.

The pain forced him to rebuild. He focused on himself‚Äîgot back into shape, threw himself into work, picked up photography, and even started traveling. For the first time in years, he was living for himself.

Then, one summer morning in a small bookstore in the city, he met her‚ÄîJade. She was reading the same book he loved. Their conversation flowed like they‚Äôd known each other forever. She was kind, grounded, and knew how to laugh at life‚Äôs chaos. Slowly, Marcus let himself love again‚Äîbut this time, with someone who loved him back the right way.

Then, out of nowhere, Tiana came back.

She sent a message. Then another. She apologized. ‚ÄúI made a mistake. I was stupid. I miss you.‚Äù

Marcus met her for coffee, not out of hope, but closure. She talked about the past like it could be revived. She said she never stopped loving him.

But Marcus had changed.

He listened, then calmly said, ‚ÄúI did love you. And maybe a part of me always will. But I don‚Äôt live there anymore. I moved on‚Äîand it‚Äôs the best decision I ever made.‚Äù

Tiana stared in stunned silence. She wasn‚Äôt used to being denied.

Marcus got up, walked away, and never looked back.

He went home to Jade, who smiled as he walked through the door.

And from then on, he lived his life peacefully‚Äîhappily‚Äîwith someone who chose him every single day.

1lkmaqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/eggfreezing/comments/1lkmaqb/surprising_er_results_tw/,Surprising ER results (TW),"37, AMH 2.7, baseline follicle count 33‚Ä¶‚Ä¶supposedly 14 follicles were ready but I had 43 eggs retrieved and 34 matured.

I had a whole draft here that of course disappeared so I‚Äôll get straight to the point lol. 

\-Looked into this process in January and started insurance, identifying clinic and doctor. I first met with the clinician in January, had my first baseline appointment in March, and did an estrogen priming protocol w estrogen patches after LH surge, then stim and retrieval in June.

\-Been on the pill for 20 years, I was off the pill in January, period has been out of whack since then (up to 35 days per cycle!) which is one of the primary reasons for the delays. This was THE most annoying part, not knowing what was happening and if I had to make an appointment for something. I have a masters degree IN SCIENCE and this process has been extremely trying and difficult, I had to remind myself of how all this biology actually worked and what we were doing and why. My clinic was somewhat hard to reach too, but they generally got back to me same day.

**My protocol**:

150 units Menopur in the morning

150 Gonal F at night, then 225 after a few days because follicle growth was a bit slower than they liked

Then cetrotide 1x a day then upped to 2x a day for a few days prior to trigger

Lupron and Novarel trigger - TRIGGER WAS PAINLESS. I was freaking out about where it should go and how painful it was going to be, it was the least painful one. I iced the area for 20 mins, really made sure I was leaning against the other foot and relaxed my leg. Such a relief! The other shots were fine, I am squeamish but it really wasn‚Äôt that bad at ALL, just annoying to find the next place to put it.

I even messed up my first Menopur injection LOL I forgot to change it to sub q, and I stuck it in and it was whatever, I didn‚Äôt go very deep but hey, I got eggs! I was a pro by day 2. 

**I‚Äôd recommend these things/things I did:**

\-Hydrate with 1 packet of liquid IV with no sugar and drink Smart Water (I was drinking 3 of those 1L bad boys a day)

\-Start preparing by taking stool softener a day before you start stims and have 1-2 of those a day until you‚Äôre regular, eat a lot of yogurt and cottage cheese

\-Eat clean and low carb, high protein. I found this to be very effective. I also craved salt weirdly, so I gave into that. I ate olives, salty fish, cod with capers lol. I ate a lot of seafood during this time period and ate the rainbow.

\-I was quite low in vitamin D (I think 20), so since March I was taking 2000-4000 units of vitamin D3 at least 5x a week. I also ate an entire jar of Hum‚Äôs hair gummies since December, added a B complex as well a week or so prior to stims. I also kept up with Armra colostrum (been taking this for a year), collagen. I drank one coffee a day but most of the time during stims I had high quality matcha.

\-For at least 2 years, I have been prioritizing low inflammatory and gut focused diet, plus eliminated all plastics and other dirty ingredients in my life. I used dirty labs clean dishwashing and clothes detergents, I use clean soaps and lotions, I don‚Äôt use candles or other home fragrances. I try to sleep in cotton and natural fabrics. I buy organic, grass fed, free range 90% of the time. I eat at minimum 30 different plants a week (that includes spices and coffee). I mostly eat Whole Foods, like eggs, steak, fish, chicken, rarely eat grains like rice, I‚Äôll have quinoa, whole bread, or sweet potato as my carbs. I‚Äôm very disciplined but I also allow myself to indulge in take out, alcohol, hamburgers and fries, pizza, all the time! I follow my good diet 80% of the time.

\-I exercise 3-5 times a week, low impact cardio like walking, Pilates, boxing and weights. I‚Äòve been doing this for at least 5 years.

**ER day**:

I was nervous, but the surgery team was amazing. They expected 14 eggs due to my follicle count, when I woke up well, everyone was shocked. I am beyond excited because this gives me the potential of 2+ births, and I probably won‚Äôt do this again. I just got my first period this week after my retrieval and it has been awful. The pain, bloating and just feeling not like myself by not being able to exercise, as well as not really been able to go out or date lol has been taxing. Trying to explain to a guy I‚Äôm dating now that I am a whale and I feel ugly is hard lol. I also had to do everything on my own, and it‚Äôs very difficult. My friends thought I wanted to be alone during this time, boy did they assume wrong! It was lonely and exhausting, I feel for anyone having to do this more than once. I would recommend going to dinner with friends, seeing movies, shop, live your life and distract yourself. It was actually nice not to drink at all and detox a bit.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Overall I am proud of myself for doing this, all of the shots and appointments and insurance took a toll on me. Currently my hair is falling out but I‚Äôm chalking it up to summer shed plus estrogen wildness. Would I do it again? Yes. Does this also kinda suck? Also yes. But it‚Äôs really 1.5 weeks of shots and you are done. I would recommend using ChatGPT to help you stay focused.

Whether it‚Äôs bloating after every meal, feeling drained even after eight hours of sleep, or just not ‚Äúfeeling right‚Äù inside, most of us have been there. I know I have. And after trying a dozen so-called ‚Äúgut health‚Äù supplements, I finally landed on one that actually made a difference: **PrimeBiome**.

# [‚úÖ Click here to access the official PrimeBiome website and claim the lowest price today.](https://015d8qwimotxft1ly6r-eazcll.hop.clickbank.net/)

If you‚Äôve been wondering whether PrimeBiome is just another overhyped supplement or the real deal ‚Äî here‚Äôs the lowdown from someone who lives in the States, shops on Amazon, reads labels, and values results.

# What the Heck Is PrimeBiome, Anyway?

**PrimeBiome** is a probiotic supplement designed to bring balance back to your digestive system. It‚Äôs packed with billions of live probiotic strains plus natural prebiotics ‚Äî think of it as giving your gut a reset button, minus the sketchy cleanses or crash diets.

One capsule a day is all it takes to start feeling lighter, more energized, and way less gassy (yeah, I said it).

# Real Ingredients, No B.S.

Look, labels matter. PrimeBiome isn‚Äôt full of junk. No artificial colors, no weird fillers, no dairy, soy, or gluten. Just clean, science-backed strains like:

* **Lactobacillus acidophilus** ‚Äì helps reduce gas and bloat
* **Bifidobacterium lactis** ‚Äì supports digestion and boosts immunity
* **Lactobacillus plantarum** ‚Äì helps with gut lining and nutrient absorption
* **Bifidobacterium longum** ‚Äì helps calm gut inflammation

It also contains **prebiotic fiber**, so the good bacteria actually stick around and do their job. A lot of other brands forget this part.

# My Experience as a Regular American Customer

I started PrimeBiome during one of those rough gut weeks ‚Äî you know, when nothing feels right and everything you eat fights back. I took one capsule every morning with my coffee and kept my usual routine (eggs, toast, and traffic).

Here‚Äôs how it went down:

* **Week 1:** Felt pretty normal, but noticed slightly less bloating after dinner.
* **Week 2:** Way more regular bathroom habits. Not TMI ‚Äî just facts.
* **Week 3:** My stomach felt flatter. Energy levels were up. Afternoon crashes? Gone.
* **Week 4:** It became part of my daily non-negotiables ‚Äî right up there with brushing my teeth and checking my emails.

The biggest surprise? My skin cleared up. I hadn‚Äôt connected my gut to my breakouts, but here we are.

# What Sets It Apart from Other Supplements in the U.S.

# Let‚Äôs Talk Price

A bottle of PrimeBiome runs about **$39 to $49** depending on the deal or subscription. Yeah, it‚Äôs not the cheapest probiotic on the shelf, but when you factor in how well it works ‚Äî and the fact that you don‚Äôt need to take multiple pills a day ‚Äî it‚Äôs worth every penny.

# Final Thoughts: Should You Buy It?

If you‚Äôre sitting there wondering whether to try **PrimeBiome**, here‚Äôs my take: **go for it**. Your gut is your second brain ‚Äî treat it like it matters. I‚Äôve wasted enough money on supplements that did nothing. PrimeBiome actually delivered.

So whether you‚Äôre meal-prepping in Minneapolis, commuting in Brooklyn, or just trying to feel better in your own skin ‚Äî PrimeBiome might be the little daily upgrade you didn‚Äôt know you needed.Let‚Äôs get real for a sec ‚Äî gut issues are no joke. Whether it‚Äôs bloating after every meal, feeling drained even after eight hours of sleep, or just not ‚Äúfeeling right‚Äù inside, most of us have been there. I know I have. And after trying a dozen so-called ‚Äúgut health‚Äù supplements, I finally landed on one that actually made a difference: PrimeBiome.  
If you‚Äôve been wondering whether PrimeBiome is just another overhyped supplement or the real deal ‚Äî here‚Äôs the lowdown from someone who lives in the States, shops on Amazon, reads labels, and values results.  
  
What the Heck Is PrimeBiome, Anyway?  
PrimeBiome is a probiotic supplement designed to bring balance back to your digestive system. It‚Äôs packed with billions of live probiotic strains plus natural prebiotics ‚Äî think of it as giving your gut a reset button, minus the sketchy cleanses or crash diets.  
One capsule a day is all it takes to start feeling lighter, more energized, and way less gassy (yeah, I said it).

Real Ingredients, No B.S.  
Look, labels matter. PrimeBiome isn‚Äôt full of junk. No artificial colors, no weird fillers, no dairy, soy, or gluten. Just clean, science-backed strains like:  
  
  
  
Lactobacillus acidophilus ‚Äì helps reduce gas and bloat  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Bifidobacterium lactis ‚Äì supports digestion and boosts immunity  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Lactobacillus plantarum ‚Äì helps with gut lining and nutrient absorption  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Bifidobacterium longum ‚Äì helps calm gut inflammation  
  
  
  
It also contains prebiotic fiber, so the good bacteria actually stick around and do their job. A lot of other brands forget this part.  
  
My Experience as a Regular American Customer  
I started PrimeBiome during one of those rough gut weeks ‚Äî you know, when nothing feels right and everything you eat fights back. I took one capsule every morning with my coffee and kept my usual routine (eggs, toast, and traffic).  
Here‚Äôs how it went down:  
  
  
  
Week 1: Felt pretty normal, but noticed slightly less bloating after dinner.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Week 2: Way more regular bathroom habits. Not TMI ‚Äî just facts.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Week 3: My stomach felt flatter. Energy levels were up. Afternoon crashes? Gone.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Week 4: It became part of my daily non-negotiables ‚Äî right up there with brushing my teeth and checking my emails.  
  
  
  
The biggest surprise? My skin cleared up. I hadn‚Äôt connected my gut to my breakouts, but here we are.

It took a couple days but they found the problem due to the electronic gear shifter and quoted $1800. Since they saw the sticky residue , they denied warranty coverage.

Currently 7m old with 5 feeds a day, 2 nursing 2 bottles and 5th is bottle or nursing depends on the day. One solid puree a day with multiple blw type snacks/fruits - not significant volume.

I anticipate her to be having 2-3 milk feeds by birthday and sufficient solids, if she is similar to my first kid. I had to cold turkey stop with my first born at 11m because I dried up completely as I got pregnant with this baby, I was pumping nothing at work for a week, but he didn‚Äôt fuss at his morning or night nursing. After taking the test, I just weaned abruptly and he didn‚Äôt miss too, finished up freezer stash in next 2-3 months, he only needed two bottles a day.

Now, I need some opinions about whether I should wean from nursing around birthday or keep the twice a day nursing and just stop pumping at work, and let her wean from nursing when she is ready. Give me why‚Äôs and why not‚Äôs please.

My reasons for weaning completely by birthday-
I want to have my body back, with two pregnancies and two - one year BF, I haven‚Äôt had my body for 3.5 yrs straight 

I want to stop eating rice/carbs - my supply doesn‚Äôt stay good if I skip carbs -  not for weight reasons, I am way less than my pre pregnancy weight by 2mo pp - I just don‚Äôt like the amount of carbs I need to eat to keep up with supply

I want to have more coffee, supply doesn‚Äôt do good with more coffee 

I don‚Äôt want to constantly keep a check of hydration sometimes I forget I get busy

I want to pull all nighters here and there without worrying about supply, I will have boards next year and want to up my studying this year 

But, because I didn‚Äôt get chance to let my son self wean, I am considering to see how long my daughter would want to nurse if I let her decide

My mom is my representative payee. She told me that we‚Äôd take $15k of my backpay and build me a tiny house in her backyard for me to live in as permanent affordable housing at $400 a month. I was down for safe affordable housing, even though it improved her property value. It sounded mutually beneficial. 

She is now denying me access to the tiny house because of a relapse that I had 4 months ago. I‚Äôve been sober since then. I went to an outpatient program after. She is planning to rent the casita that I paid for out and give me $300 a month. Even with $300 extra, my rent won‚Äôt be affordable. At $1362 + $300 = $1662, the affordable rent is $500. My rent alone is $745. She will make $400 a month off the casita that I paid for while I still won‚Äôt have affordable housing. 

I suggested getting an RV with my backpay and parking it on a $400 lot. She said no because she decided that people cannot live in RVs. 

There are multiple APS reports because my mom refused to give me food money because I don‚Äôt have any money. I‚Äôve quit smoking with patches for two week stretches to buy food. I had to get $150 to get food and cigarettes last two weeks from friends and family. 

When I spend money on myself, my mom says that I‚Äôm mismanaging funds and need to be in a group home. 

She denied me internet for doctors appointments, therapy and addiction recovery meetings because I couldn‚Äôt afford it. I went without treatment. I had to do Doctors appointments at coffee shops to get medication. I have Internet now but months without it sucked. 

APS and my mom are in agreement that I should just quit smoking and then my rent would be affordable. My boyfriend is sending me $400 a month for essentials now. It‚Äôll free up some money. What if he stops sending it?

I am considering going to a homeless shelter so that they can place me in affordable housing faster. I dunno if I can take my two cats with me. I‚Äôm not sure what to do.

And given the importance of this, financial protection acts as a precondition or an essential component of the informal ""blessing"" that Ami's sister's partner, the mayor, seeks and that Ane is willing to grant. It is her way of demonstrating her worth and her intention to be a trusted member of the extended family. The final blessing of the marriage is cemented on this foundation of respect, trust, and mutual support.

In short, the mayor's action of offering financial protection to the elder sister before the blessing is not merely a transaction; it is a profound act of respect, recognition of hierarchy, and a testament to her commitment that guarantees the harmony and ""blessing"" of the marital union in Japanese culture.

And now I will talk about how Hayato accepted and how the relationship between Ami's sister's partner, that is, the mayor, is more intimate.

This conversation, which occurs after the mayor has offered financial support to the family, demonstrates deep trust. The future brother-in-law is revealing his honne (true feelings), lowering his social guard (tatemae).

This act not only seeks to solidify family ties and personal relationships, but is also a way of seeking mentorship or discreet support from such a prominent figure. The mayor's response to these confidences will define the future relationship and cement a ""blessing"" of mutual trust, vital to the harmony of the extended family.

I‚Äôve spent this past year focusing on myself, growing, healing, and learning. But lately, the idea of a real partner keeps coming up. I miss making a woman feel deeply loved  and everything that comes with a meaningful relationship.

I‚Äôm incredibly affectionate, thrive on words of affirmation, and express all love languages. I want someone I can hold and be held by. Someone who loves a deep talk one minute and turns into a complete goof the next. I‚Äôm a consistent texter and value clear, kind, and honest communication when things get tough.

A little about me:
I‚Äôve lived coast to coast and always have a bag ready for the next road trip (but let me drive, please). I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10, tattooed, creative, and can hyper-fixate on an art project for hours thanks to the power of ADHD. I love working with my hands, taking care of people I love, and noticing the little things most people miss.

I‚Äôm attracted to femme and chapstick lesbians. Y‚Äôall really make my heart race. ‚ú® I value a partner who takes care of herself (not asking for a gym rat, just some self-love and if I can throw you around that‚Äôs a plus üòâ. Ideally looking for someone who‚Äôs a switch, but I‚Äôm happy taking the lead if that‚Äôs your comfort zone. Definitely kink-friendly - I‚Äôm done with vanilla and ready for something more aligned and expressive. 

I‚Äôm down for horror films, documentaries, or a nostalgic Disney night. Music is a constant in my life - I‚Äôm rarely without headphones. I propagate plants and give them to people I care about, and my self-care routine is sacred (morning coffee + evening tea = non-negotiable). Being outdoors is my happy place‚Ä¶ just not in Arizona heat (lived there, barely survived üòÖ). 

Last but not least I am a mom to one amazing girl. 

If you‚Äôre kind, communicative, flirty, and ready to build something - I‚Äôd love to hear from you. Bonus points if you can match my banter. Let‚Äôs see where this goes.

* **Yoshinobu Yamamoto** is basically a cyborg with a 2.76 ERA. He‚Äôll make the Rockies‚Äô hitters feel like they‚Äôre swinging at shadows.
* The Dodgers‚Äô lineup? A nuclear reactor. **Shohei Ohtani** (+145 to hit a HR) and **Freddie Freeman** (-110 on 2.5+ total bases) are here to turn the Rockies‚Äô pitching into confetti.
* The Rockies score **.228 BA**? That‚Äôs slower than a sloth on a coffee break.

**Prop Bets to Steal (or Avoid):**

* **Ohtani Over 0.5 HRs** (+145): He‚Äôs hitting a HR like it‚Äôs a mandatory team-building exercise.
* **Freeman Over 1.5 Singles** (-115): The Rockies‚Äô defense can‚Äôt stop him from batting 1,000 times.
* **Rockies Under 11 Total Runs** (-115): They‚Äôve scored 3+ runs in a game about as often as a vegan finds their favorite snack.

**Why the Rockies Might (Not) Win:**

* **Jordan Beck** (-260 to get 0.5+ HRs) could surprise us‚Ä¶ if ""surprise"" means a single dribbler to short.
* **Chase Dollander** (-135 to allow 5.5+ hits) will face the Dodgers‚Äô .264 BA. Spoiler: It‚Äôs not a date.

**Final Prediction:**  
The Dodgers win 8-2, with Ohtani launching a moonshot and the Rockies‚Äô offense resembling a broken toaster. Take the **Under 11 Runs** (-115) unless you enjoy watching Rockies fans cry into their nachos.

*Bet responsibly, or just root for the Rockies to make us all laugh by pulling off a miracle. (They won‚Äôt.)* üê¥‚öæ

1lklri7,https://www.reddit.com/r/WackAttack/comments/1lklri7/my_girlfriends_big_mama_part_2/,My girlfriend's big mama Part 2,"I began talking nicely to her as always and she reciprocated. She had beautiful blue eyes under her reading glasses. Her brown ponytail hung behind her neck as we talked. The tv was on at a low volume in the background so I could hear her pretty voice clearly. She asked me about my girlfriend and our relationship and how we were hitting it off. I told her things were going great but that the honeymoon phase had ended unfortunately. ""aww that's too bad but it happens you know."" she said sweetly. I agreed. She then asked about what movies we liked to watch together. I said we watched just about anything but that what was playing wasn't so important as long as we were snuggling together. She then replied ""That's always important."" ""Indeed it is."" I said. She somewhat boldly told me that she would be willing to have me be the father of her grandchild which made me happy and a bit surprised because we haven't been together for too too long yet.

She let out a big beautiful smile as we continued talking and she stayed on the subject of how things were going between me and her daughter. I just had to ask her about why intimacy seems to slow down as the relationship goes on. She had a surprised look on her pretty face and the smile dulled. She told me about the importance of it and that unfortunately women, especially the ones from our generation, don't quite seem to understand the importance of it, especially for men. She told me that men require relief in order to think clearly a lot of the time, not so much women. We both nodded in agreement with each other. The kind conversation went on. We both enjoyed some giggles together and a slight tension started to grow. We were having a nice time together just like I wanted. Of course being the gentlemen I am, I couldn't return the signal and slowly place my advance onto her, but I didn't need to. The chat was escalating the way it needed to on it's own. The mood was calm and playful and the glorious smile of hers wasn't going away anytime soon. We continued enjoying our conversation together even though the subject changed.

She asked me some other questions about myself with curiosity and I kindly told her with humorous detail what was on my mind. We were really enjoying each other and smiling with pleasureful eye contact. I couldn't take my eyes off this wonderful woman. At one point, I thanked her for giving me her daughter because she really was the best thing that happened to me. They were very much alike in many ways and I made sure she knew that as I smiled back at her. She scooted her big mama booty closer to me and I remained still. She soon put her hand on my knee in a nurturing motherly manner. She began rubbing my leg with her thick curvy arms. She did this in a non sexual way being the traditional modest woman she was. She was just such an incredible woman to not only talk to, but to lay my eyes on. I wanted to slowly and respectfully assert my dominance onto her, so I allowed her to continue rubbing while I had a smile on my face looked back at her. I could feel her warmth and natural scent from where I was sitting. I then laid my hand on her hand as well and felt her smooth tan skin, gently communicating to her that I was enjoying her touch and wanted to touch her back. I then moved my hand down to her big legs and returned not only the touch, but the rub too. Our natural bodily instincts were beginning to slowly flow out of us. The talking slowed down and our body movements were a bit faster. It was obvious she was open to my advances so I began projecting them onto her. I lifted both my hands up and removed her glasses from her pretty face to lay them on the coffee table. She stayed still and looked at me with a smile once again. I leaned in slowly and our lips came together almost magnetically after I looked her in the eye and wet mine with my tongue.

The kissing progressed into making out and at this point, we were only going to enjoy our time together more. I grabbed her arms softly but firmly as we continued. I then lifted my hands up and wrapped them around her neck. her breathing increased. Her hands remained down by her side as she graciously submitted to what was to come. I placed my hands around her thick waist and pulled her big body closer in to me. After a couple more minutes, I gently grabbed the bottom of her pretty orange red t shirt and slid it up around her curvy smooth body and off her head. Her bright green bra looked wonderful on her and matched well with her tan skin. It was an absolutely beautiful sight, but I wanted to see more. We continued rubbing our lips together and even licked our tongues together while in each other's mouths. I moved my hands to the back of her and unhooked her big bra. As her bra slid down off of her chest, her big beautiful brown breasts were released. She smiled at me once again with eyes contact, willfully allowing me to unleash myself onto her. I wrapped my hands around them immediately and moved my head in with my mouth open before my wet lips were suctioned onto them.

My tongue swirled around the tips of her thick brown utters as I held onto them with my hands. I sped up as I could no longer conserve what I wanted to do with her. I released my mouth off of her chest and got down on the floor on my knees and faced her. As she looked down at me in heat, I grabbed her thick tan legs and spread them apart to open her up. My mouth salivating, I moved my head forward and pressed it against her pumping hole with my lips opened and throbbing tongue sloshing into the inside of her. I looked up at her as I did this unable to look at anything else. Her smile went away as she was too busy moaning in anticipation. She was ready for me to show her how much I appreciated her and the feeling was mutual. I moved my tongue around in her rubbing it around the salty soggy walls of her gushy warm pussy. After about 3 minutes of this. I closed her legs and stood up. I got back on the couch standing up on my knees and turned her big beautiful body around. She leaned forward and stuck her big round ass up facing towards me, signaling she was ready for me to push myself into her. I grabbed my swollen veiny log of meat and pushed it between her smooth cheeks against her hole of slime before inserting it into her. She let out a gorgeous moan as I went into her. I placed my hands around her waist just above her big mama booty and slowly began sliding in and out of her. We were both having a great time. I increased my intensity onto her slowly as I watched her beautiful brown ponytail lay on her upper back. It was just so pretty and I loved looking at it while I clapped her thick body against my waist. As we continued, I reached around to the front of her and rubbed on her big brown swollen milky utters as they swing back and forth. ""HOOOEEW YES \*\*\*\*"" She moaned with excitement. The clapping increased on until before I knew it, I was slamming her big round moist butt cheeks against my waist while I spread them out even more as my girthy cock was splitting into her gaping soaking wet walls of salt with more intensity than ever. I was fulfilling what I wanted to do to this woman since about 2 minutes after I met her so I was quite happy. Part 3 coming soon",2,1750896341.0,WackAttack,0,1.0,False

Asking in writing isn‚Äôt just awkward, it‚Äôs also risky. Depending how it‚Äôs worded, it can cross into legal territory (here in the States, specifically).

Our home was built in the 80s and virtually everything was honey oak and light gray when we moved in. Nothing wrong with that at all, but definitely not my style. I am a painter by trade and know my way around a tool shop so I knew we could make the space work better for our family. 

We started by moving the fridge out of the cramped ‚Äúkitchen triangle‚Äù near the oven and sink. A controversial decision for sure, but one I do not regret at all. We have adult children and love to cook. Our home is always full of young adults and that area was so busy with people getting in and out of the fridge. Now, we have room to prep and breathe! 

The island granite was moved to the old fridge location, now coffee station. I built some deVol kitchen inspired open shelving to display our everyday items. I stained butcher block for the new larger island top. The extra seating is helpful! 

We removed the range microwave and installed an industrial vent hood that vents outside. Game changer! The new smaller microwave fits comfortably below the coffee bar. The fridge seems a lot farther away than it is in real life. I am still able to pull items from it and the pantry (blue door) to prep on the island. 

Now for the millwork! We added 1x12, small trim and crown to the tops of the uppers to conceal the vent hood ducting and to help the 8 ft ceilings feel taller. We also added bead board to the sides of the cabinets to mimic what was already on the island. We built the fridge in and I LOVE having that open shelving above it for cookbooks. I painted the cabinets a warm beige to help neutralize the busy, dated granite we decided to keep. My proudest accomplishment is that not one single thing from this kitchen went into a landfill. It was all repurposed. 

The brick backsplash is sealed so that grease and grime don‚Äôt stain. It wipes clean with soap and water and is one of my favorite parts of the kitchen!! This took about a year for us to complete as we did the work ourselves in between day jobs, kid stuff and life!! I think taking our time helped me to feel secure in my choices and it definitely helped to save money. Most of our decor is thrifted or from my sweet gramas home. My furniture is all second hand as well. If I had to describe my style, it would be Nancy Meyers in a moody farmhouse. üòÇ

Unlike traditional fat burners that rely on caffeine or artificial stimulants, Mitolyn takes a deeper route‚Äîfocusing on the health of your mitochondria, the part of your cells that produce energy. Its formula combines powerful ingredients like CoQ10, PQQ, Acetyl-L-Carnitine, and Alpha-Lipoic Acid, all of which work together to enhance mitochondrial function, increase metabolism, and reduce fatigue. Users are reporting improved energy, mental clarity, and gradual fat loss without the jittery side effects common with stimulant-based products.



# [Official Mitolyn Site ‚Äì Order Yours Today](https://4c216olnxn7mes1lon1a-f1taw.hop.clickbank.net/)



What sets Mitolyn apart is its long-term wellness focus. Instead of offering a temporary energy spike or a crash diet solution, it supports the body‚Äôs natural fat-burning abilities by helping cells function at their best. The result? A more sustainable, balanced approach to weight management. Mitolyn is also packed with antioxidants that protect cells from oxidative stress, aiding in healthy aging and overall vitality. Whether you're struggling with slow metabolism, low energy, or stubborn fat, Mitolyn offers a smarter solution rooted in cellular science. For those seeking a safe, effective, and stimulant-free way to support their wellness journey, Mitolyn may just be the breakthrough you've been waiting for.



What is Mitolyn? A Cellular Energy Supplement Like No Other

Mitolyn is a dietary supplement formulated to support mitochondrial function and increase natural energy production. The mitochondria in your cells convert food into energy. Over time, stress, aging, and poor lifestyle habits can damage these mitochondria, leading to low energy, mental fog, and slower metabolism.



This is where Mitolyn steps in: by providing your mitochondria with the nutrients they need to recharge, repair, and multiply.



The Science Behind Mitolyn: Key Ingredients That Matter

Mitolyn combines several powerful, researched ingredients designed to boost mitochondrial health and energy metabolism:



Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): An antioxidant essential for the electron transport chain in mitochondria ‚Äî basically the engine of energy production. CoQ10 also protects your cells from oxidative damage, which increases with age.



Pyrroloquinoline Quinone (PQQ): A unique compound that promotes the creation of new mitochondria (mitochondrial biogenesis). More mitochondria = more energy available.



L-Carnitine: Transports fatty acids into mitochondria where they can be burned for fuel. This helps your body use fat more efficiently as an energy source.



Nicotinamide Riboside (NR): A form of vitamin B3 that boosts levels of NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), a critical coenzyme that declines as we age. NAD+ plays a central role in energy metabolism and DNA repair.



Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A potent antioxidant that protects mitochondria and supports brain health.



These ingredients work together synergistically to not just provide a temporary boost but actually improve your cellular energy production capacity.



How Does Mitolyn Affect Your Body?

When you take Mitolyn consistently, you might start noticing:



Steady energy without crashes: Unlike caffeine or sugar, Mitolyn helps your energy last throughout the day without jitters or crashes.



Sharper mental focus and clarity: By improving brain cell energy, you may experience better concentration and less brain fog.



Improved mood and reduced stress: Supporting cellular health can also improve neurotransmitter balance, enhancing your mood.



Better endurance: Whether it‚Äôs for workouts or daily activities, enhanced mitochondrial function helps you perform better.



Support for healthy aging: Mitochondrial decline is linked to aging symptoms; keeping mitochondria healthy can help slow this process.



Who Can Benefit from Mitolyn?

Mitolyn is ideal for:



Busy professionals juggling multiple tasks and feeling drained.



Students who want sustained focus without the rollercoaster of stimulants.



Older adults seeking to maintain energy and brain health.



Anyone feeling fatigued despite proper sleep.



People looking for a natural, stimulant-free energy booster.



If you dislike relying on coffee or energy drinks but still want a real pick-me-up, Mitolyn might be perfect.



How to Use Mitolyn for Best Results

Taking Mitolyn is simple:



Take two capsules daily, preferably with a meal and water.



Be patient. Cellular energy improvements take time‚Äîmost users report noticeable changes after 3-4 weeks.



Maintain a healthy lifestyle alongside‚Äîbalanced diet, hydration, sleep, and exercise amplify the benefits.



Is Mitolyn Safe? Any Side Effects?

Mitolyn‚Äôs ingredients are natural and generally well-tolerated. Some users may experience mild:



Digestive discomfort (like nausea or bloating)



Headaches during the first few days



These side effects usually disappear as the body adjusts.



Note: If you are pregnant, nursing, or have chronic medical conditions, consult your healthcare provider before starting any new supplement.



Real User Experiences and What To Expect

Many users have shared positive feedback about Mitolyn, highlighting:



Increased energy without anxiety or jitters.



Improved focus and memory during work or study.



Enhanced mood and better stress handling.



A general feeling of wellness and vitality.



Personally, after taking Mitolyn for a few weeks, I noticed my afternoon slump disappeared, and I was able to power through my day more efficiently without relying on multiple cups of coffee.



Pricing and Where to Buy Mitolyn

Mitolyn is priced competitively compared to other mitochondrial support supplements. The best place to buy is through the official website to ensure product authenticity, secure payment, and access to discounts or money-back guarantees.



Be cautious about third-party sellers, as counterfeit supplements are common in the market.



FAQs About Mitolyn

Q: How soon will I feel the effects?

A: Most users notice subtle improvements within 1-2 weeks, but full benefits generally build over 3-4 weeks.



Q: Can I take Mitolyn with other supplements?

A: Usually yes, but check with your doctor if you are on medication or have health conditions.



Q: Is Mitolyn suitable for vegans or vegetarians?

A: Check the product label for capsule ingredients, but many mitochondrial supplements use gelatin capsules unless specified.



Q: Can Mitolyn replace my coffee?

A: It can help reduce your dependence on caffeine by providing natural, sustained energy, but it‚Äôs not a stimulant.



Q: Is there a money-back guarantee?

A: The official site often offers a satisfaction guarantee‚Äîcheck their current policy.



Final Thoughts: Is Mitolyn Worth It?

If you want a natural, effective way to boost your energy, mental clarity, and overall well-being without the jitters or crashes from stimulants, Mitolyn is an excellent option. By supporting your mitochondria, it tackles fatigue at its root rather than masking symptoms.



Energy is life, and Mitolyn helps you reclaim yours by fueling your body‚Äôs very own power plants.

I [33/M] was texting a former colleague (who grew up in Syria but is now in the UK) [29/F] i used to have a crush on.

She asked if i fancied getting a coffee and going on a walk at some point. I tried to contain myself as it could just be as friends and nothing romantic. But i at least allowed myself to entertain the possibility of it being romantically inclined.

I said okay and that i needed to get back to her on when i would be free. A few days later i asked if she was free this weekend. She said she had a friend staying with her (also Syrian) and said they would be going for a coffee and walk this weekend and suggested i join. So now its just like ughhh.

I think that was about two days before I noticed the kitchen sink filling up with water so while I can't confirm it directly caused the clog, I'm pretty sure that's what it is.

The issue is that this has been a way harder clog than I expected. It's already been two days of using a bunch of different common solutions for dealing with clogs. I removed and cleaned out the p-trap which didn't really have much in it. I bought a 15"" drain snake and I can't seem to get it to go much further than about half a foot, no further in any direction once I hit the back of the pipe. I used an enzymatic clog dissolver (Green Gobbler, I know this solution is generally not recommended) overnight and that didn't seem to do much. Finally, I used a spoon to clean up as much as I could of the black gunk in the drainage pipe connected to the wall. Much of the black gunk was quite hard to scrape off, almost like flakes of rock. Water still gets backed up after running for about 30 seconds.

I don't know how many pounds, maybe around 300? She had cancer when she was super young (leukemia) and for many decades was extremely thin but after being pregnant (I'm 17 and her youngest) she has gained a lot of weight. I know gaining some weight during pregnancy is normal but not this much.  However, she isn't gaining anymore. Now, I don't think her diet is super unhealthy; she usually gets a good amount of meats and veggies, but I think she gets a lot of calories from drinking coffee with cream and sugar and drinks a lot of tea with a teaspoon of sugar. 

A few years ago, she started developing knee pain which made it difficult to walk. It was bad for maybe a year, then faded away, and her knee has been acting up every once in a while. A week ago it got super bad to the point that she started taking motrin/advil multiple times a day. I told her that she needed to start exercising (she used to have an at home bike that she rode on a few years ago but my dad got rid of it) in order to ease the pain and she told me she wanted to but she's so stiff it's hard for her to. I encourage her to come with me to the store to get her walking but yesterday her knee pain  (which spread to her whole leg) was so bad that she couldn't walk. Warm water in a bath only makes her pain worse and advil/motrin doesn't work. I got her Voltaren Max topical cream for her knee and ankle but I don't know how much it's helping. 

I keep telling her to go to the doctor but she's refusing because she says the pain will go away on its own. I'm so worried about her, I just want her to go to the doctor to get a professional opinion, but she's so stubborn she won't. Everyone is telling her to lose weight (my two aunts started a few years ago, followed by my dad who was really mean about it but nobody likes him anyways because he's a manchild so who cares about what he has to say, and now my sibling and I), and she's making steps to (like reducing how much she's eating) but I can't see any visible changes.

New York City, JUNE 26, 2025 

Mitolyn supplement review, natural energy booster, mitochondrial support, brain fog remedy, NAD+ booster supplement, clean energy pills, Mitolyn USA.

Here‚Äôs the deal: Mitolyn isn‚Äôt your usual quick-fix caffeine pill. It works way deeper, inside your cells, powering up your mitochondria‚Äîthose tiny energy generators in your body. Curious how it stacks up? I‚Äôve done the homework, tried it out, and I‚Äôm breaking it down for you here.



What‚Äôs the Big Deal About Mitochondria?

Think of mitochondria as the battery packs inside every single cell in your body. They turn the food you eat into energy. The problem? As we get older, or if we‚Äôre stressed, these batteries don‚Äôt charge as well. That‚Äôs when you start feeling sluggish, foggy, and basically like a smartphone running on 5% battery.



Mitolyn targets this exact problem. Instead of slapping a bandaid on your tiredness, it aims to fix the battery so your energy lasts longer and feels more natural.



What‚Äôs Inside Mitolyn That Makes It Work?

Mitolyn packs a punch with a blend of smart, researched ingredients:



Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Supports energy production and fights oxidative stress. Your mitochondria love this stuff.



PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Encourages your body to grow new mitochondria. More batteries = more energy.



L-Carnitine: Helps your body burn fat for energy. So it‚Äôs like fueling your batteries with premium gas.



Nicotinamide Riboside (NR): Boosts NAD+ levels, a molecule that‚Äôs essential for energy metabolism.



Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): An antioxidant that supports your brain and cell health.



These aren‚Äôt just buzzwords‚Äîthere‚Äôs solid science backing these ingredients.



What Can You Expect When You Take Mitolyn?

No crazy energy spikes or shakes here. Instead, users often report:



Steadier, more consistent energy all day



Clearer thinking and improved focus



Better mood and less stress



Even improvements in sleep quality



Personally, I noticed I could get through my workday without crashing hard mid-afternoon, and my brain felt sharper when tackling tough tasks.



Who Should Definitely Give Mitolyn a Try?

People tired of the ‚Äúcoffee and crash‚Äù cycle



Anyone battling brain fog or poor concentration



Busy professionals or students needing sustained focus



Older adults wanting to support healthy aging



Anyone who wants clean, natural energy without jitters



If that sounds like you, this might just be your new favorite supplement.



How to Take It for Best Results

Just take two capsules daily, preferably with a meal. Easy enough, right? The key is to be patient‚Äîresults build up over a few weeks as your mitochondria get the support they need.



Is It Safe? What About Side Effects?

Mitolyn‚Äôs all-natural formula is generally safe for most adults. Some users may experience mild digestive discomfort or headaches during the first few days while their body adjusts. If you have medical conditions or are pregnant/nursing, it‚Äôs smart to check with your doctor first.



Does Mitolyn Really Work? Here‚Äôs the Verdict

I‚Äôve seen a lot of supplements come and go, but Mitolyn feels different. It‚Äôs not a quick fix, but a steady energy and brain boost that works with your body, not against it. The price is reasonable for the quality, and the official site often runs deals and offers a money-back guarantee.



Where to Buy Mitolyn

Stick to the official website or authorized sellers to avoid fakes. Look out for bundle deals or trial offers if you want to save a little.



Final Thoughts

If you‚Äôre done feeling drained and want a natural way to boost your energy and mental clarity, Mitolyn is worth trying. It supports your body‚Äôs energy systems at the cellular level, which is honestly where real vitality starts.



Go ahead, give it a shot‚Äîyou might be surprised how much better you feel.

I [33/M] was texting a former colleague [29/F] i used to have a crush on.

She asked if i fancied getting a coffee and going on a walk at some point. I tried to contain myself as it could just be as friends and nothing romantic. But i at least allowed myself to entertain the possibility of it being romantically inclined.

I said okay and that i needed to get back to her on when i would be free. A few days later i asked if she was free this weekend. She said she had a friend staying with her and said they would be going for a coffee and walk this weekend and suggested i join. So now its just like ughhh.

I said i was free so it would be odd to decline, but then again i really cba. I feel like im damned if i do and damned if i dont!!

What do you think i should do? Would it be beneficial to this romantic pursuit to go along and just have a good time or should i just bail?

I‚Äôm planning to get either the Kaffelogic Nano 7E or the Nucleus Link. I tried to list some considerations for each, but my main concerns are:

	
1.	The roast profiles ‚Äî not the quantity but whether they can consistently produce light roasts (think Tim Wendelboe style).
	
2.	The warranty and support.

**Kaffelogic Nano 7E**

‚Ä¢	Can customize profiles.

‚Ä¢	Cheaper.

‚Ä¢	Not locally available in the Philippines ‚Äî I‚Äôd need to buy from Australia to match the voltage and ship it here via a shipping forwarder. (Potential warranty concerns: If it ever needs repairs, would shipping it back to AU be covered? How frequent does it need repair?..)

‚Ä¢	I‚Äôve read their core profiles tend to roast on the darker side. I mainly drink light roasts and do pourovers only ‚Äî I don‚Äôt have an espresso machine, and while I‚Äôd like to get one someday, it‚Äôs not a priority right now‚Ä¶ so I wonder how much work will one need to develop great light roasts profiles with it‚Ä¶

‚Ä¢	Needs a boost kit for 50g batches. One of my main use would be sample roasting for profiling. I know you can‚Äôt directly import Kaffelogic curves into Artisan, but with the right methodology ‚Äî through cupping, understanding the parameters, and careful observation ‚Äî there should be a way to translate and scale those profiles to another roaster. I currently use a Huky 500.

‚Ä¢	Can do up to 200g batches, which would be convenient when I just want a quick, plug-and-play roast for home coffee for my parents without worrying too much about profiles.


**Nucleus Link**

‚Ä¢	Can customize profiles as well

‚Ä¢	Comes with a lot of profiles to choose from.

‚Ä¢	Available via a local distributor(so warranty might be easier to handle, though I‚Äôll still have to confirm with them if they actually help with this..).

‚Ä¢	I‚Äôve heard they roast light very well, and they also have espresso profiles if I ever need them.

‚Ä¢	Can do 50g batches but limited to 100g max.

‚Ä¢	Has extra features like adjusting for elevation and density. (I don‚Äôt travel to coffee farms, but maybe in the future? Then again, with different countries having different voltages, it might not even be that useful on the go.)

Now I understand why Zuko's teas were terrible,"A friend of mine gifted me matcha green tea powder from Japan, it's not like instant coffee, but it's grounded up tea, and since this was my first time making it and the packaging is in Japanese, I just winged it and brewed this tea, which tasted terrible. After researching, matcha green tea is delicate and sensitive to water temperatures, so I waited 30 minutes while my boiled water rested inside a thermos and I brewed the tea again, this time the tea tasted great.

Now I understand why Zuko's teas were terrible, it's because Zuko was so filled with hate and anger that the temperature of his firebending reflected this, causing the tea he made for Iroh to be bitter, in other words, Zuko burned the tea, and after joining Team Avatar and learning from the Sun Warriors that making his fire too strong can result in uncontrollable fire, while making his fire too weak will cause the fire to burn out, so Zuko learned how to balance the temperature of his firebending and therefore, Zuko also learned to control his temper and not let it control him as it once did, resulting in him making better tasting teas which he serves Team Avatar and Iroh later.

Being korean, allows to search useful resource a bit easier and appreciate reddit users posting their journey and that English pdf file.

Out of youtube, i find this user mr.homebrew quite good as he go over various korean traditional alcohols.
 https://youtu.be/dx3aTzI0lv8?si=dz7FNvMzWyYQe_an

Pretty much i decided to home brew, as it dam expensive if you live oversea and some times even hard to get makgeolli. I'm in canada btw.

This is what i did and have questions for experienced users. 

The class I took, showed what unfiltered ÏÉù makgeolli was how much better it was compared bottles you can find easily on the shelf. When i was in korea, you have so many choices and varieties. Tried a few, and there wasn't much difference between cheapest and mid price maekgeolli. This changed my mind when i tried unfiltered.

In class, we used sweet rice and super nuruk. Nuruk that is more enhanced by science than something more traditional. This made makgeolli much sweeter, carbonated, had a yogurt drink flavour the one you see in asian grocery store, a bit of fruity notes without added sugar. I like heavy texture like creamy and sweetness. 

I think i got confused with gluten vs gluten-free rice, and sweet and non sweet rice. Sweet rice is ÎßµÏÇ¥ and non sweet rice Ï∞πÏÇ¥.

So for home brew i did non sweeten rice. That's the rice we eat at home. Also, to make life easier, used electrical rice cooker. Searching for recipe that used electrical rice cooker was almost non existant. Use what ever nuruk was available at korean grocery store. Nuruk is pretty much going to determine the alcohol and flavor. 

Pretty much standard recipe 1kg rice, 1L of water and 100g of nuruk. You will need to soak the rice for min 2 hours and wash until no cloudy water. Surprisingly 1kg of rice do fit in regular size electrical cooker. I have cookoo bap. One thing i miscalculated was rice expands and the jar was too small. I got ikea glass jar that hold 3kg and with everything mix it was full. I had to split the batch in half as the mixture can rise during fermentation. 

Did 1 batch 1:1:.1 ratio and 1:1.5:.1 ratio to be more drier. Stir for 3 to 4 days and just waited for 10 days before filtering. I used a fine nylon mesh. You just need to move the liquid and it should strain easily and get leftover only which are jigemi. Because it was non sweet rice, it similar to dry white wine. I was surprised the one i put more water more palatable and used monin banana syrup to sweeten it. Wanted something like banana milk. Put half the bottle and a bit of water (300g of syrup) It doesn't mix that easily. Taste like milkis. Because it's regular nuruk, i see more clear liquid.

So i realize because the type of rice i used is the opposite of my target makgeolli being sweet and creamy. I do get better cheonjoo so have to settle with that. Overall success in terms making alcohol, but failure because not the result i wanted. Getting sweet rice or thinking 2yangju or 3yangju, which i need help understanding. 

Also, it very important to sanitize your equipment. Best to 70% isopropyl.  I think that is better than ethyl alcohol. 

Here is my questions for the veterans.

1) what can you do with left over sediments? It seems like you can make Ïà†Îπµ alcohol bread or make another drink Î™®Ï£º which seems similar to ÏàòÏ†ïÍ≥º. Can you store the sediment in freezer or does that kill the nuruk? I would like to minimize.ize wastage

2) i heard you can repeat the process 2 or 3 times. Apparently samyangju is really good and it's even easier to make. Most of the recipe i've seen requires to rice powder and nuruk and a lot of water. Than put ggoldol bap Íº¨Îì§Î∞•, and repeat few times. Can you just do that from makgeolli you made or do you need to start from the powder? It's looks like ddok and you ferment that as first stage? And any smaller batch recipe?

3) in terms of flavouring, I've seen people put fruits and stuff from the start. Should i let it ferment for first 3 days then put flavoring like fruits or other liquid? If so, how much should i put?

4) realized if I screw up the batch, i will just use the liquid and make soju. Any info on distiller equipment? Looks like moonshine kit, or find adequate tube/hose and collect the steam from pressure cooker. Don't think water distiller will work because of rice sentiments. Any tip, recommendations or experience? 

5) anyone tried making their own nuruk? I looks like you are trying to make your own mold. Ideally it should be white. Using grains and let it dry. Otherwise, use yeast? Seems like wine, champagne, koji and bear yeast is popular. 

6) i heard you can put higher alcohol content to kill nuruk and make alcohol stronger. Don't know what they are called. i need to make good base first

Appreciate if anyone can answer my qunadry as i want to shorten my learnjng curve and increase success rate. Being coffee created this obsession minimize wastage. Also, please correct me if i have something wrong",1,1750895030.0,makgeolli,0,1.0,False

If you‚Äôve been feeling drained, unfocused, or just plain low on energy lately, you‚Äôre definitely not alone. In our busy, always-on world, it‚Äôs common to feel like your energy tank is constantly running on empty. That‚Äôs where Mitolyn comes in‚Äîa supplement designed to support your body‚Äôs tiny energy factories called mitochondria. But is it really worth trying? Let‚Äôs dig into everything you need to know about Mitolyn and whether it can actually help boost your energy and mental clarity without the usual jitters.

***>>***[***IF YOU'RE EVEN CURIOUS, GRAB IT WHILE IT'S STILL 75% OFF‚ÄîSTRAIGHT FROM THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE.***](https://4c216olnxn7mes1lon1a-f1taw.hop.clickbank.net/) Mitolyn review, natural energy booster, mitochondrial health supplement, brain fog solution, Mitolyn NAD+ booster, energy without caffeine.

What Is Mitolyn?

Mitolyn is a dietary supplement that targets mitochondrial health to naturally boost your energy production. Your mitochondria are microscopic organelles inside every cell that act like power plants‚Äîturning the food you eat into energy your body can use. When these little powerhouses slow down or get damaged, it leads to fatigue, brain fog, and decreased stamina.



Unlike energy drinks or caffeine pills that give a quick but temporary boost, Mitolyn works at the cellular level to help your mitochondria function better. This means more sustained, clean energy throughout your day.



How Does Mitolyn Work?

The key behind Mitolyn‚Äôs effectiveness lies in its unique blend of ingredients that support mitochondrial function. Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown:



Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for energy production and protecting cells from oxidative stress. Think of it as fuel for your mitochondria.



Pyrroloquinoline Quinone (PQQ): Helps your body generate new mitochondria‚Äîa process known as mitochondrial biogenesis. More mitochondria means more energy production capacity.



L-Carnitine: Transports fatty acids into mitochondria to be burned for energy. This helps your body efficiently convert fat into usable fuel.



Nicotinamide Riboside (NR): A form of vitamin B3 that boosts NAD+ levels, a crucial molecule for energy metabolism and DNA repair. NAD+ declines with age, which can contribute to feeling tired and slow.



Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A potent antioxidant that protects cells and supports brain health.



This combination works synergistically to not only increase your energy but also support your brain, heart, and overall cellular health.



Who Should Use Mitolyn?

If any of these sound like you, Mitolyn might be worth a shot:



You often feel tired even after a full night‚Äôs sleep.



You struggle with brain fog or poor concentration.



Your energy dips significantly in the afternoon or early evening.



You want to support your health as you age naturally.



You dislike stimulant-based energy boosters or want a cleaner, more balanced energy lift.



Mitolyn is designed for adults who want to feel more vibrant and mentally sharp without relying on coffee or energy drinks.



How to Take Mitolyn?

It‚Äôs simple: just take two capsules daily with a meal and water. For best results, consistency is key‚Äîgive it at least 3‚Äì4 weeks to notice real changes.



Since Mitolyn targets mitochondria and energy production, some users report subtle improvements in focus and stamina after just a week. Full benefits usually build up gradually over a month.



What Can You Expect? My Experience and Common User Feedback

When I first tried Mitolyn, I was skeptical‚Äîjust another supplement promising energy, right? But within days, I noticed a shift. The afternoon slump wasn‚Äôt hitting me as hard, and my focus during work calls improved. By the end of week two, I felt more motivated to exercise and less dependent on caffeine.



Commonly reported benefits include:



Steady, jitter-free energy throughout the day



Improved mental clarity and sharper focus



Enhanced mood and reduced stress



Better quality sleep at night



Unlike quick stimulant fixes, Mitolyn‚Äôs effects feel natural and balanced.



Are There Any Side Effects?

Mitolyn‚Äôs ingredients are natural and generally safe for most people. However, some may experience mild digestive discomfort or a slight headache during the first few days as their body adjusts. These effects are usually temporary.



If you have a medical condition, are pregnant, nursing, or on prescription medications, it‚Äôs best to consult your healthcare provider before starting Mitolyn.



Is Mitolyn Worth Buying?

Mitolyn sits at a mid-range price point compared to other energy supplements. But what you get is a science-backed formula that works on your body‚Äôs energy system instead of masking fatigue.



If you spend money on coffee, energy drinks, or random vitamins, investing in Mitolyn could actually save you money and improve your quality of life. Real, sustainable energy‚Äîwithout crashes or jitters‚Äîis priceless.



Where to Buy Mitolyn?

To avoid fakes or expired stock, always buy from the official website or trusted retailers. The official site often offers discounts, bundles, and sometimes a money-back guarantee if you‚Äôre not satisfied.



Final Verdict: Should You Try Mitolyn?

If you‚Äôre tired of feeling tired, struggling with mental fog, or want to support your aging cells with a natural, stimulant-free supplement, Mitolyn is worth trying. It‚Äôs not a magic pill but a smart way to empower your body‚Äôs energy production right at the cellular level.



With consistent use, many users‚Äîincluding myself‚Äîhave found it to be a reliable tool for improving day-to-day energy, focus, and overall well-being.



Give Mitolyn a shot‚Äîyou might just find your energy switch again.

I currently work in a Vets for Pets, inside a Pets at Home store; the music that plays in the store is not controlled by staff, and it's always the same playlist of songs that, up until I started working there, I'd never heard anywhere else. I've shazam'd/listened with google to identify some of the songs, and while some of them are on spotify, others are only available on youtube or bandcamp.

When searching for some of these songs, I found one of them on youtube and to my surprise a lot of the comments on it were things like ""I always hear this song at B&M"", ""found this song after constantly hearing it at The Range"", ""who else is here because they heard it in Trespass"" and so on. Then, a few months ago, I went to a coffee shop (not a chain one) close to where I work and quickly realised that the exact same playlist was playing there, too. 

  
Here are a few of the songs that I've managed to identify, in case anybody who happens to see this post knows any of them!

FTM here, 27 with a 9-month-old baby. 
My husband (31M) and I have been together for 3 years and something happened recently that I just can‚Äôt shake.

He owns his own business, so he often works very late or stays out overnight. That‚Äôs never really bothered me because I know how demanding his work is. But this time felt‚Ä¶ different. He left for work as usual and didn‚Äôt come home until around 11 AM the next day. During the night, his texts were just enough to seem normal, but still felt off. And he ignored a couple of my calls, which is unlike him.

When he finally came home, he acted completely normal. But I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling, so I told him I had a bad gut feeling and asked to look through his phone just to ease my mind. He handed it over willingly and everything seemed normal.

So I checked his bank statements and found:
	‚Ä¢	A charge at a high-end restaurant at 10 PM.
	‚Ä¢	A hotel charge at 11 PM. (I called and they confirmed he had a room but couldn‚Äôt give anymore information)
	‚Ä¢	A delivery app purchase for tampons at 11:30 PM.
	‚Ä¢	A coffee purchase at the same hotel the next morning around 10 AM.

When I confronted him:
	1.	First, he said he was working at his office all night and even slept in his chair.
	2.	Then he admitted he went out drinking with friends but didn‚Äôt tell me because he didn‚Äôt want me to know he was spending a lot of money even though I‚Äôve never had a problem with that. He works hard and I‚Äôve always supported him blowing off steam when he needs to.
	3.	Then he said they went to the hotel bar and he booked a room IN CASE he got too drunk to drive.
	4.	He claimed that he, his friend and a girl the friend brought just hung out, drank and ‚Äúchilled‚Äù in the hotel room until he left at around 2 AM.
	5.	As for the tampons? He said the girl needed them and he bought them ‚Äúto be nice.‚Äù He says he didn‚Äôt even talk to her or know her name.
	6.	He even called that friend on speaker and said, ‚ÄúThose tampons I bought were for the girl you were with, right?‚Äù And of course, the friend backed it up.

I pointed out the coffee charge at the hotel around 10 AM and he claimed he was just driving past, had a meeting nearby and stopped to get a coffee because he likes the coffee there. I don‚Äôt know what to believe anymore.

He keeps insisting nothing happened and that I‚Äôm overthinking, being paranoid, and making a big deal out of nothing. But I just can‚Äôt get over how inconsistent his story is. I feel like I‚Äôm being gaslit. I want to believe him, but I just‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt.",61,1750894758.0,beyondthebump,72,0.98,False

I had focus, energy, and drive that lasted approximately 6-7 hours. It didn‚Äôt take long for my body to acclimate, though. After a few days‚ÄîI was getting 4 hours max, and then 1 1/2 hours.

Today I took 50 mg today for the first time and to be honest‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt really feel much of a difference. I was slightly more motivated and my mood was elevated. I‚Äôd say the effects lasted for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

I‚Äôm drinking coffee now as Vyvanse is not providing enough energy as is.

I‚Äôm metabolizing this drug ridiculously fast. I‚Äôm scared 60 mg or 70 mg won‚Äôt even work.

I‚Äôm trying to improve my sleep, I‚Äôm eating well, and hydrating, too. I always take Vyvanse with a meal, usually a protein source.

For the past month or two, I started tracking my diet. The app I‚Äôm using gave me a 2,100-calorie daily window (I think), but I just can‚Äôt seem to lose weight. I‚Äôve been eating below that limit and switched to lighter dinners‚Äîmostly steamed vegetables or specific meals I make (I‚Äôm a really picky eater). But theres NO progress. I even feel bigger and the scale stays the same.

I‚Äôm 19, weigh 215 pounds, and recently got a job, so I‚Äôve been walking and moving around more than usual and being the oldest daughter I‚Äôm basically living the life of a single mom with 4 kids.

So a typical day looks like:

Work from 9 AM to 4 PM (lots of coffee and like a cup of noodles)

From 5 PM to 7 PM, I come home, clean up the house, work on some online school, and rest my brain for a second (lay on the floor till my back stops hurting)

From 7 PM to 9 PM, I cook

From 9 PM to 10 PM, The family eats

From 10 PM to Midnight, I prep lunch for the next day, do the dishes, clean the kitchen, shower

edit: I forgot to add. I stay up till like 2 am most night just to get some time to myself. Scroll social media, Watch comfort shows, Play animal crossing. It's like a mental recharge. If I dont get time alone I'll tweak tf out. anyway.

I really need advice because I don‚Äôt have time for workouts or anything extra.

In today‚Äôs fast-paced world, it‚Äôs easy to run on empty. But what if there was a natural, mitochondria-supporting solution that could help you feel more energized, focused, and just plain better?

Let‚Äôs dive into this honest review of the Mitolyn supplement, what it does, how it works, and whether it‚Äôs worth adding to your daily routine.



üåü What is Mitolyn?

Mitolyn is a mitochondrial health supplement designed to help your body produce energy at the cellular level. Unlike typical energy boosters that rely on stimulants like caffeine, Mitolyn works at the root of your energy system‚Äîyour mitochondria. These are the little power plants inside your cells that convert nutrients into usable energy (ATP). When your mitochondria are healthy and active, you feel more awake, alert, and balanced.



The formula behind Mitolyn is science-backed and made with key ingredients that promote mitochondrial function, detoxification, and metabolic health.



‚ö° What Makes Mitolyn Different?

There are tons of supplements out there promising more energy. So, what sets Mitolyn apart?



Stimulant-Free Energy:

No jitters. No crashes. Mitolyn helps you feel naturally energized without relying on caffeine or sugar.



Cellular-Level Support:

It doesn‚Äôt just mask fatigue‚Äîit targets the source. By supporting your mitochondria, it helps improve how your body actually makes energy.



Brain + Body Boost:

Users report not just physical energy but also improved mental clarity, sharper memory, and better mood.



Clean, Clinically-Inspired Ingredients:

The supplement uses high-quality nutrients like NAD+ boosters, CoQ10, and L-Carnitine that have real research behind them.



üß™ Key Ingredients in Mitolyn (And Why They Matter)

Let‚Äôs break down the magic behind the formula:



Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10):

A crucial antioxidant that fuels mitochondrial function and protects cells from oxidative stress. It‚Äôs especially important for heart and brain health.



L-Carnitine:

Helps transport fatty acids into mitochondria so they can be burned for energy. It‚Äôs like fuel delivery for your cells.



PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone):

Supports the growth of new mitochondria‚Äîa process called mitochondrial biogenesis. This is next-level cellular support!



Nicotinamide Riboside (NR):

A precursor to NAD+, which is essential for energy production, DNA repair, and overall cellular function. NAD+ levels naturally decline with age, so replenishing it helps reverse that fatigue.



Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA):

A powerful antioxidant that helps reduce inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity, and support brain function.



üë• Who is Mitolyn For?

Mitolyn is ideal for people who:



Constantly feel tired, even after a good night‚Äôs sleep



Struggle with brain fog or low focus



Experience low motivation or mood swings



Want to age more gracefully and preserve cellular health



Prefer natural, non-stimulant energy solutions



Whether you're a busy professional, a student juggling multiple responsibilities, or someone over 40 who wants to feel young and vibrant again‚ÄîMitolyn can fit seamlessly into your wellness routine.



üíä How to Take Mitolyn

Each bottle comes with easy-to-swallow capsules. The recommended dosage is typically 2 capsules per day, preferably with food for better absorption. Most people start noticing subtle shifts in energy and mental clarity within 1‚Äì2 weeks, with more pronounced effects after 30 days of consistent use.



Pro tip: Hydrate well and pair it with a healthy diet for best results!



‚úÖ My Personal Experience with Mitolyn

I started using Mitolyn during a period when I was juggling too many work deadlines and my brain felt like mush by 2 PM. Within the first week, I noticed I wasn‚Äôt reaching for my afternoon coffee anymore. By week three, I felt significantly more ‚Äúon‚Äù‚Äîlike my brain had finally gotten out of first gear.



No jittery side effects, no weird crashes‚Äîjust a smooth, steady sense of vitality. I even slept better, which I wasn‚Äôt expecting.



For me, the biggest win was mental clarity. Tasks that used to drain me felt more manageable, and I had more mental bandwidth to actually enjoy my evenings instead of collapsing on the couch.



‚ùó Are There Any Side Effects?

Mitolyn is made from natural ingredients and is generally well tolerated. However, everyone‚Äôs body is different. A few users might experience:



Mild stomach upset if taken on an empty stomach



Headaches (rare, usually during detox)



Temporary adjustment symptoms during the first few days



If you‚Äôre on medications or have pre-existing health conditions, it‚Äôs always a good idea to check with your healthcare provider before starting any new supplement.



üí∞ Is Mitolyn Worth the Price?

At around $40‚Äì$60 per bottle, Mitolyn isn‚Äôt the cheapest supplement on the market‚Äîbut you‚Äôre paying for high-quality, clinically-supported ingredients that actually do something. Plus, if you‚Äôre spending that much on coffee, energy drinks, or random vitamins every month, this might be a more effective (and healthier) swap.



Most users agree that the results justify the investment‚Äîespecially for those who‚Äôve tried everything else and are still feeling drained.



üì¶ Where to Buy Mitolyn

To avoid counterfeits and get the freshest product, it‚Äôs best to buy Mitolyn from the official website or a verified retailer. Some sellers even offer bundle deals, autoship discounts, or money-back guarantees.



If there‚Äôs a free trial or coupon available, grab it while it lasts!



üîö Final Thoughts: Should You Try Mitolyn?

If you‚Äôre dealing with low energy, mental fatigue, or just want to support your long-term health in a smarter way‚ÄîMitolyn is 100% worth considering.



It‚Äôs not a quick fix or a miracle pill, but with consistent use, it can help you feel like you again‚Äîmore alive, more focused, and more balanced. And let‚Äôs be real, in today‚Äôs world, we could all use a little more of that.

Preferences: We‚Äôre both into specialty coffee and love beans with floral and stone fruit notes, although the fruit preference shifts a bit seasonally. We also really like rye whiskeys.

Wash (10s) - old leather-bound books, dirt and mushrooms in the aroma

Steep 1 (flash) - mud, coffee, hint of black licorice and dried cherries, touch of cinnamon brings baked cherry cobbler vibes, sweetness hits fast and is already starting to coat the mouth, just enough of that old library vibe to remind you it's an aged sheng, but so much more going on already 

Steep 2 (flash) - some black tea notes giving this a sweet tea with berries vibe, forest floor and old leather armchair note in background, but nearly vanishes as mint leaves come in then fade to lemon candy and more cherry cobbler. Sweetness is early and potent

Steep 3 (5s) - mouthfeel isn't super thick, but still coats nicely with the faintest tingle developing, sweetness is present from the start, but never cloying. 

Steep 4 (10s) - similar flow, earth and bookstore fades instantly into sweetness, and some late dark fruit notes. A hint of smoke is flitting in and out now. Sweetness has a deeper character like turbinado or jaggery rather than the cotton candy and powdered sugar I get from young sheng

Steep 5 (20s) - southern sweet tea with a hint of smoke, starting to feel some energy 

Steep 6 (20s, reboil) - some cinnamon spice and nutty/woody notes showing up in this steep. The dried fruit has faded a bit, leaving me between carrot cake and pecan pie

Steep 7 (30s) - nutty/woody notes creeping back up, mint leaves making another appearance, sweetened cocoa powder, mint chocolate milkshake as the finish lingers 

Steep 8+ (45s+) - walnut skins turning to praline

Overall impression - Wow! I've been on a young sheng kick for a few months now. I'm not sure what made me reach for this, but I'm glad I did. This is like drinking a pastry shop. There is plenty to sink your teeth into, and a nice evolution over the course of a session. I haven't had a lot of Bing Dao, but if this tea is typical of the area, then I get why this is such a desired region

Even though astringency isn't a flavor, it certainly affects how you perceive flavors. This isn't a super drying tea, but there is enough astringency to give it some heft. And it certainly leads to the sweet tea impression early and the pecan pie and praline character I got later on in the session. It certainly hits the right balance in this tea.",7,1750893964.0,puer,1,1.0,False

One is a very modern store, and one is very run down and a classic style Morrisons

The out-of-town store had to be rebuilt due to structural issues, and it has turned into a French-style hypermarket with a market street kitchen cafe (now closed). Very odd idea, as you had to queue for each individual menu item, which is an interesting approach if you have a family. 

The one thing Morrisons did well was the cafe. They decided to market Street Kitchen, these (now closed), or close down their traditional cafes. Surely, they could have just put in those touchscreens with table service to make things more modern or efficient. Rather than close them and lose their USP. Surely it can't have been that hard to use touchscreens, whetherpoons style coffee machine and simple menu items that are friend, microwaved or merry chefed. 

I now live near Nottingham and have been into the Gamston morrions. An older style store, but in good nick. Has an efficient pizza counter system on a touchscreen, but the new Morrisons hypermarket in Clacton doesn't have this system, even though its a newer store.

Some stores are really old and in desperate need of repair, and some are French hypermarkets. But even the super modern French hypermarket style morrisons never had the self scanners put in and still has those awful morrisons self service machines. 

I recember going to a morrisons up north as a kid once. The expirence still sticks with me as it was quite unique. The little market street fridges and felt very authentic to the brand.

We are devastated but unwilling to make a decision based on our pain rather than his, which has become undeniable. 

He rightfully earned the nickname Teeth. In the first six months of our lives together, we saw a lot of his.  We adopted him at 11 and quickly realized he was not dog or kid-friendly, despite reassurances from his first family that he was both of those things. He was food aggressive and fickle in his affections. He once caused a minor flood after eating through my parents' bathroom plumbing. He got lost for a day after hopping into someone's car when the front door lock broke (I can't really blame them for not calling my number on his tag). Even before going deaf, he never listened. He was willful and dignified, but over time, he became incredibly loving in his way and an absolute gentleman.

He's helped me weather an emotionally taxing job, a miscarriage, my partner's cancer diagnosis, a difficult pregnancy, and my son's newborn stage. I first noticed his decline in December and pleaded that if he held out until the summer, I'd do right by him. 

He was not a ""good dog,"" but he has been an incredible companion. I wish he could live forever, but it's my turn to hold up my end of the bargain.

The only thing he really gets excited for anymore is human food, so far, we have planned:

1lkknvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1lkknvv/i_need_some_dating_advice/,I need some dating advice.,"TL;DR:
Seeing guy since January. Started off as a hookup. He continued to message me and hangout. Things developed a romantic twist. We started seeing each other outside of sex, going on dates, spending time together, doing day trips, etc. We are exclusive, he told me he has feelings and I have feelings for him. I asked what he's expecting of this. He said he can see potential for a relationship with me but has a lot going on right now that he's trying to resolve, doesn't feel he can be in one right this moment. He'd rather just let things slowly evolve and unfold naturally but can totally understand if I have a shorter timeline and would prefer scale things back to just a friendship and see other people. Not sure what to do.

So to start, for a while I had given up on dating and relationships. It was just a disappointment and a letdown being constantly ghosted, or meeting people who lead you on but run away from commitment, etc. so for the past couple of years my mindset has shifted to I'm not actively looking for a relationship but I'm also not not opposed to one either. If something happens to come along where I feel there's a connection that could lead to more I'm prepared to put the effort and time in.

So this leads to my story. 6 months ago this really hot guy that I met on Grindr came over for a hookup. He had on his profile a similar thing where he's not actively looking for a relationship but not opposed. Anyways, the sex was really good, I assumed it would just be a hookup nothing more and all was good...

After that, he kept messaging me to hang out and hook up which we did and it eventually started taking on a little bit more of a romantic twist. We were going on date nights and then he was coming back to my place to hook up after and sometimes staying over. And then it progressed to where we were hanging out, going on dates and spending time with each other without even hooking up. Every time he saw me even in public, he would kiss me, he would swing by my work place on my break and bring me coffee/snacks, we'd go on hikes with his dogs, he'd have me over his place and cook me dinner, etc... we both are exclusive and not seeing anyone else.

Even though it wasn't spoken of it was clear that at this point there were some sort of feelings involved and it was more than just a hookup or friends with benefits but I didn't know where it was going... I didn't want to bring up the conversation at first because I didn't want it to seem like I was being pushy or trying to press a relationship but at the same time I wanted to know what his intentions were and what his end goal was And see if we were on the same page.

I finally got up the courage to have the conversation with him now at about 6 months in... What he told me was that it obviously started off as just to hook up and he had no intentions of anything more, but as we continued to hang out and hook up he saw my personality, what a good person I was and caught feelings and those feelings continued to grow for him as we continued to hang out. He wasn't expecting to catch feelings and for it to turn into this ongoing thing... He likes me a lot, enjoys getting to know me a little more each time we hangout and ultimately would like a committed relationship, but right now he has a lot of things in his life that he's trying to settle like financially, with his health and with his ex, family and stuff. Because of that, he doesn't think that he has 100% of his time to devote to me that he feels you should be able to devote to someone while building a romance/ committed relationship... He can see the potential for a relationship with me but isn't going to force it and drop all of the other things he's trying to settle. He'd rather just let it evolve naturally and slowly over time while he takes care of the other things he needs to do. He told me he's torn because since he really likes me, he wants to continue to build on this and get to know me more but said that at the same time he also doesn't expect anyone to wait around for him to figure his stuff out. He said he feels bad and feels that I could be using this time to spend with someone who can devote 100% of their time to me right now and that if I have a shorter time line and I'm looking to be in a committed relationship right now, he wouldn't fault me or blame me if I wanted to dial things back and just be friends while I put myself back on the dating market and see other people. He said either way I'm a great person and he wants me in his life in some capacity. 

Now, to me that all sounds very legit and he does seem like he's being sincere when he's saying that. For me even though yes my life is at a point where I'm ready for a committed relationship now I still feel like why rush things? I don't have a timeline. So if his timeline is longer I'm willing to continue to build on whatever we already have going and let things continue unfold.

My friends however when I told them this said that he's just telling me what he thinks I want to hear. They think he's just giving me false hope and stringing me along, that has commitment issues and just wants the benefits of a relationship without the title. Or they said that when he said he's not ready for relationship he just meant he's not ready for a relationship with me specifically. In any case they think I should just put myself back out there and keep dating other people. But the problem I see is there is nothing else out there. I'm 35 and have yet to have a relationship or meet someone who I really had feelings for like this guy or who showed me affection like he does as opposed to just viewing me as a sex object. With that said, I feel like if someone good like him comes around you should absolutely cherish it and do whatever you need to to try to make it work.

What are your thoughts on all this? Any suggestions of what I should do?

I (30F) started dating this guy (25M) I love I few months ago and I need advice to overcome my anxiety to our age gap.

First of all, I know the problem is me since I am worried about other people opinions about us, but I am slowly trying to solve this issue with myself. He is the sweetest and still the most mature and gentle man I know, and even if 25 and 30 are pretty different chapters in life, I do know that it is going to be better as soon as he reaches 27-28.

More than our age gap, this is all about the age gap with his friends. 

We are in a long distance rls and most probably it will be me the one that moves to his city, but I feel kind of worried about not fitting into his life. Our lifestyle with our closest friends are hugely different. While I enjoy a coffee date with my best friends, they are having dinner in McDonald (not him luckily, he hates fast food and enjoy a good restaurant). They are just a bunch of 20-25 yo guys living the best moment of their life, which is nice! But now I am into a more relaxed vibe.

I guess I worry about being seen as the big sis instead of their friend‚Äôs gf.

Would you give me some advice about my anxiety?

We are close to border with another country too, so there's even more people across a bridge, although the city is 1/4 of size of mine.

We are thinking about a simple coffee place, or something with music or arcades to attract more people and use the students to our advantage. 

For the students, having arcades or hangout events for dating, karaokes, live soccer, Brazil night, indian night, etc, seem easy to attract people.

  
How to validate the idea? Just asking around? We know students don't have lot's of money, so we don't want to exclusively cater to them, but it seems like a good opportunity.

-hypnosis meditation 
-delaying breakfast/skipping coffee 
-doing pushups to break the ritual of continually running back to the bathroom .
-watching funny videos

I had my first vertigo episode about 3 years ago, and was off work for 6 weeks, and then again for 5 weeks a few months later.  I just couldn't walk in a straight line, and I was nauseous all of the time.  My doc told me I had BPPV. Since that first vertigo episode,I stopped drinking booze, caffeinated coffee, decreased my salt intake(not great at this, I love a salty snack!), at the advice of my audiologist and physiotherapist.  Despite those changes, I continued to have pressure in my ear, nausea, and sometimes unsteadiness. I had a vertigo episode last week.  I saw a different doctor, and he said, this sounds like Meniere's disease.  I had vertigo testing 3 years ago, so I am going to book a hearing test to confirm if there is any hearing loss in my left ear.  

My doctor told me 3 years ago, I had to give it time and work on my anxiety. This doctor gave me medications (betahistine and ativan) and told me what to do if I have another episode. I am feeling much better knowing there is a plan. I am so glad there is a community of people here sharing their experiences with this disease.

When we were sat watching a movie, he sat next to me. At this point we were sharing a blanket and pillow, with our legs resting against each other. The first ten minutes of the movie, I counted he glanced at me me four times. The fifth time I look at him and he shot his head away.

When he was stood behind me, I turned to look at him, the same thing happened again.

Other times, he'll hold his stare and we just look at each other with a look of understanding, or a blank expression. He will sometimes smile back me, if I do so first.
