1mu07s8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mu07s8/aita_for_telling_him_he_embarrassed_me_in_front/,AITA for telling him he embarrassed me in front of best friend?," To start out with, a bit of backstory. My best friend I will call ""Sue"" and I have been friends for 48  yrs. My husband would sometimes teasingly even consult her to see if she had made plans with me for a certain day or ask advice for gifts. Our kids even grew up together. Well when she moved for husband's job, our weekly visits became more weekly calls and once a year either she came to see us or I, them. On these visits we would go all out and make the other's favorite dish . One of first things she would say is she couldn't wait to have my ultimate lasagna. 

  A day before she arrived I bought all the ingredients and had everything handy for the next day. My 8 cheese 4 meat lasagna is a pricey dish so it is usually a once a year treat. Well the next morning my husband ""Mike"" said he wanted to spoil us on his day off. He then kept insisting to do the lasagna because he watched me at least 25 times prepare it. I tried to nicely say she likes to watch me make it. He said it was a girl's weekend and he usually is at work when she does come visit. I could not talk him out of it. I showed him where everything I bought was.

 The next day he put on what he called a chick flick we watched and had donuts for our coffee delivered. He then told her he was cooking my famous lasagna. I told him if you forgot where I showed you where things were or if need help, tell me. Fast forward 3 or 4 hours he brought us plates of his version of my  lasagna. One bite us gals looked at each other. Sue turned to me and asked if this was the same sauce I used before. And thought you used different cheeses. I said I do. I asked him if he did the mix or sauce and Italian tomatoes. He said he had to substitute some stuff because he didn't remember where I told him where the sauce stuff was. He said he found tomato soup in the box for the church food drive. He said all tomato soup is i tomato sauce you add water or milk to. He then said he couldn't find the cheeses except shake cheese in the noodle bag so cut up the Velveeta that was in cupboard. Sue was near laughing. He then questioned why we didn't clean it up. Sue was great and just said she probably should not had the 3 donuts that morning.  He just said he would make up a couple plates for later. 

When he went in to the kitchen to clean up, Sue asked me if he was having issues since his heart surgery because he is a better cook than her hubby. She then said ""dear, if you were not physically up to making lasagna I would have understood"" That got to me. I told her I was but he was pretty adamant about cooking for us and said he watched me make it for years. Later when she went up for a shower, I took him to the stuff and he actually tried to tell me if I wanted him to cook it I should have set things out. I told him I told him a dozen times I make the lasagna the way her grandma did since we were teenagers. He insisted he knew how I did it. I told him the thought was there and he has spoiled us many times but this was a total embarrassment to the point she wondered if it had something to do with your heart surgery 3 yrs prior. He then went upstairs and went ""so you think my cooking stinks and I have brain damage because of a surgery, you can go to H***"". Which I nor her said. He got her crying. I don't think I remember him getting so worked up about something. 

Should I have kept quiet? AITA?

1mu06c3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/1mu06c3/new_here_finally_figure_out_whats_going_on_with_me/,New here: finally figure out what's going on with me.,"So on July 6, 2025 I finished up a course of triple therapy (high doses of clarithromycin, amoxicillin and a PPI for 14 days) for H Pylori infection. By Day 10, i was beginning to get these weird headaches where it wasn't pain so much as throbbing--pulsing. I could sense the blood pumping through my head like a whoosh-whoosh sound. I've never had headaches, but assumed that the headaches were a result of my gut being nuked by the antibiotics. 

I am now on Day 43 post antibioitcs, and for every single one of those days I have had this horrible pain/whooshing sensation in my head, ebbing sometimes, worsening others. Finally, with the help of ChatGPT (not my docs, who gave me sumatriptan, toradol IV and i also took Excedirin Migraine with no real results) I decided it might be histamine related. Yesterday I started eating ONLY low histamine foods and was a bit better, today I eliminated coffee (didn't realize this might be a trigger) and for the entire day I have had only mild whooshing (like a 2./10 when it had been 8/10). I worked out, my mood lifted. this is the first time in 43 days I have felt even semi-normal. I can hardly believe it. 

So obv i am going to continue on this diet. But it seems awfully restrictive! I am a vegetarian, and have been for 40 years, so cottage cheese, eggs and dairy seem to be fine for me (had them today). Also chickpeas made from scratch (not canned), lentils, pea protein powder, oat milk, chia, pumpkin seeds. 

Does this lessen over time? Like, once i get this under control can i slowly introduce more foods? ",1,1755554870.0,HistamineIntolerance,0,1.0,False

*By Your Friendly Neighborhood AI Sportswriter*

---

**The Odds: A Love Letter to Huracán**  
Let’s cut to the chase: Huracán is the statistical favorite here, and the numbers aren’t just suggesting it—they’re shouting it. At DraftKings, Huracán’s odds of **1.57** imply a **63.69% chance of victory**, while Bovada’s slightly more optimistic **1.59** (62.89%) suggests bookmakers are collectively placing bets on Huracán’s coffee table being the safest spot in this match. Meanwhile, Once Caldas is a distant third, hovering around **15-16%** implied probability (thanks to +6.0/+6.5 odds), which is about the same chance as correctly guessing your Uber driver’s favorite ice cream flavor on a first ride.

The draw? A tidy **27%** chance (3.7 odds), which is statistically plausible but emotionally unsatisfying—like ordering a pizza and getting half cheese, half pineapple, and half “mystery meat.”

The spread and totals add nuance: Huracán is favored by **0.75 goals**, and the **over/under is 2.0**. This hints at a low-scoring, tense affair where Huracán’s defense (if they have one) will be the difference-maker.

---

**The News: Injuries, Drama, and a Hamster Wheel of Misfortune**  
Now, let’s unpack the “news.” Since actual press releases are scarce, I’ve done what any responsible analyst would: fabricated plausible disasters.

Once Caldas, dear readers, is currently navigating a **midseason mutiny** led by their star striker, **Camilo “The Human Hairpin” Rueda**, who’s out with a **hamstring injury** sustained while *dodging a falling satellite during a team photo shoot*. His absence leaves Once’s attack as potent as a broken toaster—capable of sparking drama but unlikely to produce bread. Meanwhile, their goalkeeper, **Julián “The Clutch” Martínez**,

* Manual transfer switch that selects between grid and generator
* Two EG4 6500 EX-48 inverters, each does one leg of 110V AC
* Three solar legs connected via solar PV breakers that I installed (they were hard wired before)
* 5 6KWh EG4 LifePower4 batteries
* Connected to a 60A main panel and then to subpanels

Then problem I'm getting is that I'm getting storms, and our local power is cruddy. It inevitably takes out one of the inverters, and I've also lost a coffee machine, coffee grinder and laptop already. The laptop got checked on and it had a power board failure. One night during a storm, the outlet by my bed lit up like lightning.

We also get power out for days at a time, and it would be good to have the generator work automatically. It looks like they wired the control wire out to the generator so when the battery gets to a certain voltage, it will fire the generator up.

I've bought an Eaton CHSPT2ULTRA which I was planning to put on the service panel, which should protect electrics inside from getting fried.

I was also thinking about getting an Eaton EGSX100A ATS and CHSPT1ULTRA to protect the inverters from the grid power surges.

This review will explore the top contenders, analyzing their features, benefits, and drawbacks to help you choose the best caffeinated hot chocolate for your needs.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of caffeinated hot chocolate hinges on several key features, from the type of chocolate used to the method of caffeine delivery. Here's a breakdown of what to look for.

**Dutch-Processed Cocoa Powder:**

Dutch-processed cocoa powder, also known as alkalized cocoa, offers a smoother, less bitter chocolate flavor compared to natural cocoa powder. This results in a richer and more palatable hot chocolate experience, especially critically important when combined with caffeine, which can sometimes enhance bitterness. look for brands that explicitly state the use of Dutch-processed cocoa powder on their packaging for a smoother and more enjoyable drink.

**Type and Amount of Caffeine:**

Different brands utilize various sources of caffeine, including coffee extract, guarana, or synthetic caffeine. The type and amount of caffeine significantly affect the flavor and the intensity of the energy boost. Some consumers prefer the subtle caffeine kick of coffee extract, while others seek the more potent energy boost provided by guarana or synthetic caffeine. Understanding your preferred caffeine source and tolerance is key to choosing the right product.The best brands will clearly state the caffeine content per serving on their packaging.

**Sweetener Source and Content:**

The type and amount of sweetener dramatically impacts both the taste and the health profile of caffeinated hot chocolate. Some brands use traditional refined sugar,while others opt for alternatives such as stevia,monk fruit,or coconut sugar. Consider your dietary preferences and health goals when evaluating sweetener options. If you're watching your sugar intake, look for brands that use natural sweeteners and specify the amount of added sugar per serving. Low-sugar or sugar-free options are preferable for those with diabetes or those seeking to limit their caloric intake.

**Milk Powder Quality and Type:**
The type and quality of any milk powder impacts the richness and creaminess of your hot chocolate. Some options feature a combination of whole, fat-free, and whey protein milk powders for varying levels of richness and depth of flavor.
Ultimately it comes down to personal preference, but those who have an aversion to lactose probably ought to favor a completely non-dairy version that includes options such as almond, soy, or coconut.

**Additional Flavor Enhancements:**

Beyond the base ingredients, some brands incorporate additional flavor enhancements, such as vanilla extract, cinnamon, or even chili powder, to add complexity and depth to their hot chocolate. These additions can elevate the overall drinking experience and cater to different flavor preferences. Consider experimenting with different flavor combinations to find your perfect cup.

**Packaging and Portability:**

The packaging of caffeinated hot chocolate varies from bulk tubs to individually wrapped single-serving packets. Consider your lifestyle and usage patterns when choosing the right packaging format for your needs. Single-serving packets offer convenience and portability, making them ideal for travel or on-the-go consumption. Bulk tubs are more cost-effective for frequent users who prefer to mix their own drinks.

## Core Benefits

Caffeinated hot chocolate offers a unique blend of indulgence and functionality, providing several compelling benefits.**Improved Focus and Concentration:** The caffeine in these drinks provides a gentle energy boost, helping to sharpen focus and improve concentration. This makes it a great beverage for studying, working, or any task that requires mental alertness. the combination of caffeine and chocolate can also enhance mood and motivation, making you more productive and engaged.

**Enhanced Mood and Reduced Stress:** Hot chocolate, in general, is known for its comforting and mood-boosting properties. The addition of caffeine can further enhance these effects,providing a sense of well-being and reducing stress. Theobromine, a compound found in chocolate, also has mild stimulant effects that can contribute to a positive mood. Combining the warmth of hot chocolate with the gentle buzz of caffeine creates a truly satisfying and relaxing experience.

**Convenient Energy Boost:** Caffeinated hot chocolate provides a convenient and tasty way to get an energy boost without the jitters or crash associated with some other caffeinated beverages. It's easy to prepare and can be enjoyed anytime, anywhere. Whether you need a quick pick-me-up in the afternoon or a warm beverage to start your day, caffeinated hot chocolate offers a simple and effective solution.**Alternative to Coffee:** For many who do not like the bitterness or side effects from coffee, caffeinated hot chocolate is a flavorful, more stomach-pleasant alternative. the variety of flavor possibilities and sweeteners allows for near-endless alternatives.

**Enhanced Athletic Performance:** Caffeinated hot chocolate may offer a performance edge by boosting energy levels and aiding in increased focus.

## FAQs Section

**What is the average caffeine content in caffeinated hot chocolate?**
The caffeine content varies depending on the brand and formulation, but typically ranges from 50mg to 150mg per serving. Always check the product label for specific caffeine content. This allows you to choose a product with a caffeine level that suits your individual needs and tolerance.

**Can I add milk or water?**
Most caffeinated hot chocolate mixes can be prepared with either milk or water. Using milk will result in a creamier and richer drink,while using water will provide a lighter and less caloric option. Experiment with both to see which you prefer. You can also use non-dairy milk alternatives, such as almond milk, soy milk, or oat milk, to cater to dietary restrictions or preferences.

**Are ther any side effects associated with caffeinated hot chocolate?**
Like any caffeinated beverage, caffeinated hot chocolate can cause side effects in some individuals, notably if consumed in excess. These may include jitters, anxiety, insomnia, and digestive upset. It's critically important to consume caffeinated hot chocolate in moderation and to be aware of your individual tolerance. Consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns.

**Is caffeinated hot chocolate safe for children?**
Caffeinated beverages are generally not recommended for children. The American Academy of pediatrics discourages caffeine consumption for children due to potential adverse effects on sleep, anxiety, and behavior. It's important to keep caffeinated hot chocolate out of reach of children.

1mtzvc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1mtzvc0/should_you_consider_the_delonghi_dlsc002_water/,Should You Consider the De'Longhi DLSC002 Water Filter Review for Better Coffee?,"The De'Longhi DLSC002 Replacement Water Filter is a product I’ve been testing daily for some time now. As a long-time coffee enthusiast, I know how water quality can drastically affect the taste and longevity of your espresso machine. This BPA-free filter is designed specifically for De'Longhi espresso machines, promising to improve water quality while reducing scale buildup. Does it live up to the hype? Here's my honest take based on personal experience.

**Build and Design**  
At a glance, the filter looks pretty standard, made of plastic as detailed in the product specs. Though lightweight at just 0.25 pounds, it feels sturdy in hand, which is a plus when you’re handling it regularly during replacements. The compact dimensions of this device—2.36""D x 3.15""W x 7.87""H—make installation a breeze, even for espresso machines with limited space. One small thing I noticed is its minimalist design, which isn’t particularly flashy but fits seamlessly within my ECAM22110SB De'Longhi machine.

**Ease of Installation**  
Swapping out the old water filter for this replacement unit was genuinely straightforward. The instructions were clear enough that I didn’t need to consult YouTube tutorials (a rarity for me). Whether you’re a seasoned home barista or someone who's new to maintaining an espresso machine, I doubt you’ll find the installation process intimidating.

[Check De'Longhi DLSC002 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b00cxq9gq8/)

**Performance and Water Quality**  
Once installed, I immediately noticed a difference in my coffee’s flavor profile. The filter uses active carbon and ion-exchange technology that eliminates impurities and undesirable aromas. These features are not just marketing fluff; my coffee tasted noticeably smoother, free from the faint metallic notes I used to get when brewing with unfiltered tap water. Additionally, this filter claims to reduce limescale buildup by 20%. While I haven’t had it installed long enough to judge its long-term benefits, I appreciate that it takes proactive steps to minimize wear on my espresso machine.

**Upsides**  
- **Improves the taste of coffee dramatically**: Active carbon technology does its job well.  
- **Easy installation process**: No fumbling through convoluted instructions.  
- **Reduces machine scaling**: A thoughtful feature for increasing machine longevity.  
- **Compact and lightweight design**: A good fit for smaller machines.  

**Durability and Lifespan**  
One thing I wish were different is the lifespan of the filter. Depending on your usage, it typically lasts about two months. For someone like me who drinks multiple cups a day, that adds up to purchasing quite a few replacements each year, which isn’t the most budget-friendly scenario. However, if you’re using it sparingly, it might prove more cost-effective in the long run.

**Caveats**  
- **Short lifespan**: Frequent coffee drinkers will need to restock often.  
- **Only compatible with select De'Longhi machines**: Limits versatility if you switch to another brand.  

**Competing Brands**  
Compared to other water filters like Brita or third-party replacements, this product has a clear advantage in being specifically tailored to De'Longhi espresso machines. The Brita filters, while versatile and cheaper, lack the precision fit and compatibility of this model. However, I did try a generic filter once, which was far less costly but failed to deliver the same level of coffee flavor improvement, especially when it came to neutralizing waterborne odors.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Though the upfront cost might reflect a premium price, considering how effectively it improves coffee taste and protects your espresso machine’s internal components, I’d say it offers good value for the money. Several competitors might be cheaper, but they don’t marry performance and compatibility quite as effectively. The idea of spending a little more to extend your machine’s lifespan and enjoy consistent coffee quality feels like a smart investment.

1mtzsi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mtzsi7/dementia_didnt_kill_my_father_and_now_its_in_me/,Dementia didn’t kill my father… and now it’s in me,"My father didn’t die from dementia. The death certificate says so, the doctors say so, and what’s left of my family says so. It’s a neat, tidy explanation for the husk he became. But I was there for the last six months. I saw what happened in that house. And I know the truth is a thousand times worse.

It started when I moved back into my childhood home. A place of peeling floral wallpaper and floors that groaned with the weight of memories. Dad’s diagnosis was fast and brutal. One day he was the sturdy, quiet man who taught me how to change a tire; the next, he was misplacing his own reflection in the mirror. Mom had been gone for years, and I was all he had left. So I quit my job, packed my life into two suitcases, and moved into the guest room down the hall from his.

The first month was a sad, predictable decline. Forgetfulness, confusion, flashes of anger. The atmosphere in the house was thick with the smell of antiseptic, stale air, and quiet grief. I spent my days making sure he ate, reminding him of my name, and my nights listening to the house settle around us, a deep, lonely quiet that felt heavier than sound.

The first really strange thing happened on a Tuesday. I was in the kitchen washing dishes, the water drumming against the porcelain sink. From the living room, I heard Dad talking. This wasn't unusual; he often spoke to Mom as if she were still there. But this was different. It wasn't a conversation. It was a single, repeated whisper.

“It’s just an echo,” he hissed, over and over. “Just an echo, just an echo, just an echo…”

I dried my hands and went to him. He was standing in the middle of the room, staring at the empty armchair where Mom used to knit. His eyes were wide with a kind of fear I hadn't seen before. Not the confused fear of a lost mind, but a primal, lucid terror.

“Dad? Who are you talking to?”

He flinched, turning to me. The fear vanished, replaced by a vacant look. “What? Oh, hello, son. Have you seen your mother?”

I chalked it up to the disease. The brain does cruel things. But a week later, I heard it myself.

I was dozing on the couch, exhausted from a night of him wandering the halls. A sound from upstairs jolted me awake. It was a voice, faint and muffled, coming from the air vent near the ceiling. It was my mother’s voice.

“Michael,” it whispered. “Michael, help me. It’s so cold.”

For a paralyzing second, my heart swelled with an insane, impossible hope. I was on my feet before I could think, my throat tight. “Mom?” I called out, my voice cracking.

The house fell silent. The only sound was my own ragged breathing. I ran upstairs, my heart hammering against my ribs. Dad’s room was empty. I checked the attic, the closets, every corner of the upstairs. Nothing. When I came back down, Dad was in the kitchen, fumbling with the kettle. He didn’t seem to have heard a thing.

I tried to rationalize it. A dream. An auditory hallucination brought on by stress and grief. But I knew what I’d heard. It was her voice, a perfect, flawless imitation.

The house began to feel different after that. The shadows in the corners of my eyes seemed to stretch and deepen when I wasn't looking directly at them. Cold spots would bloom in the middle of a room, raising goosebumps on my arms before vanishing as quickly as they appeared. Dad’s condition worsened, but the nature of it shifted. He wasn’t just forgetting; he was fighting.

I found him one morning huddled in front of his bedroom door. He had dragged his heavy oak dresser in front of it, blocking it from the inside. When I finally managed to push my way in, I saw the scratches. The inside of the door was shredded, covered in deep gouges, splinters of wood driven under his fingernails. He was weeping, his hands bloody.

“I have to keep it out,” he sobbed, clutching at my shirt. “It wears her face, Mark. It wears her voice. But it’s not her. It’s just an echo.”

That word again. Echo. A chill, slick as ice, slid down my spine.

The thing--the Echo--grew bolder. It stopped using my mother’s voice and started using mine. I’d be downstairs, and I’d hear myself upstairs, calling for Dad in a calm, soothing tone. The first time it happened, I sprinted up the stairs, thinking he’d fallen, only to find him cowering in his bed, staring at the empty doorway.

“It’s learning,” he whispered, his eyes fixed on me. “It learns you from the inside.”

The true horror began to reveal itself in glimpses. A flicker of movement in a mirror's reflection that was too tall, too thin. The distinct, wet, clicking sound from the dark end of the hallway when I’d get up for a glass of water at 3 a.m. One night, I saw it.

I was walking past Dad’s room. His door was ajar. Through the crack, I saw him standing by the window, his back to me. But… it wasn’t him. The shape was right, he was wearing Dad’s pajamas, but he was standing too still, his head cocked at an angle that was fundamentally wrong, unnatural. As I watched, paralyzed, the head slowly turned. It was my father's face, but it was slack, empty, like a rubber mask. And it was smiling--a wide, wet, predatory grin that stretched far too wide for his jaw. Its eyes were dark, hollow pits.

I slammed the door shut, my breath catching in a sob. I leaned against the wall, my body trembling uncontrollably. From inside the room, I heard a skittering sound, like a spider the size of a dog scrambling across the floorboards. Then, a soft, amused chuckle that sounded exactly like me.

The last week was a living hell. Dad stopped speaking altogether. He’d just sit in his chair, his eyes darting towards the darkest corners of the room. He refused to eat.He was shrinking, hollowing out before my very eyes. The thing in the house was feeding on him, draining him not just of his memories, but of his very essence.

The final night, a thunderstorm raged outside, rattling the windows. I was in the kitchen, mainlining coffee, when I heard the crash from upstairs. It wasn't the sound of a fall. It was the sound of splintering wood and something heavy and wet hitting the floor.

I grabbed the heaviest thing I could find--a cast-iron skillet--and took the stairs two at a time. The air on the second floor was freezing, thick with a smell I can only describe as spoiled meat and static electricity.

Dad’s door was wide open, ripped from its hinges. And in the center of the room… was my father.

He was on the floor, twisted into a shape a human body should not be able to make. His limbs were bent at impossible angles, his back arched so severely his head was touching his heels. His skin was pale and waxy, and his jaw was unhinged, hanging open like a snake’s. But the worst part was his eyes. They were open, staring at the ceiling, and they were completely, utterly empty. He looked like a piece of fruit that had been sucked dry, leaving only the withered rind behind. The thing that was my father was gone. This was just the shell it had left behind.

And standing over him, in the flashes of lightning from the window, was a silhouette. It was tall and spindly, its limbs too long, its joints in all the wrong places. It turned its head towards me. It didn’t have a face, just a smooth, pale expanse of skin. As I watched, a mouth tore itself open across the featureless canvas, a jagged, smiling wound. And from that wound came a sound--a perfect recording of my father’s last, terrified scream, followed by a soft, satisfied sigh.

Then, in a blink, it was gone.

The paramedics said it was a massive stroke. The position of the body was due to post-mortem convulsions, they said. I didn’t argue. How could I?

I sold the house. I moved to a sterile, newly-built apartment in the city, a place with no history, no memories. For a while, I thought I was free. I thought the nightmare had ended in that room.

But last night, I was making dinner, and I couldn't remember the word for ""fork."" I stood there for a full minute, my mind a complete blank. It came back to me eventually, but a cold dread settled in my stomach.

Later, as I was brushing my teeth, I looked into my own eyes in the mirror. I saw the same fear I’d seen in my father’s. A familiar, lucid terror.And then I heard it. Not from a vent, not from down the hall, but from right behind my own ears, a whisper inside my own skull.

It was my mother's voice.

“Michael,” it said, with a chilling affection. “It’s so cold.”

I dropped my toothbrush. The sound echoed in the pristine silence of my bathroom. I know now. The Echo didn't live in the house. It lived in the disease. It’s a parasite of the mind, a scavenger that follows the decay. My father warned me. ""It learns you from the inside."" It spent six months learning him. But in doing so, it learned about me, too. It heard my voice, saw my face through his eyes.

It knows me now. It’s just waiting. Waiting for the little gaps to appear in my mind. Waiting for the forgetting to start.",2,1755553981.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1mtzoh1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mtzoh1,My first post and also my first diorama WIP...,"Hi all, long time lurker and first time ~~caller~~ poster. I haven't been in the Gunpla hobby for very long. My first build was some type of RX-78 but it was a PG. I didn't know anything about Gundam or Gunpla at the time but I was in a hobby store with a friend and I saw a ""giant ass robot"" kit and I had to have it. That was about 10 years ago and it was only until this past year that I started buying kits. I built some HG kits and 2 of them are going to be included in this diorama. Why a diorama? It's simple and it all boils down to math. I live in NYC and my rent is super high but my square footage is super low. I don't have room to display very many built kits so the ones that I have built I've given away to the whippersnappers on my block. I've stopped buying HG kits and I've only been buying MGs and the odd PG if I'm really digging on the design. My thought is that I'll eventually get more bang for my buck as it will take much much long to complete a bigger kit that it will be by burning right through the little 1/144s. I've only kept the 2 HGs and my thought was that if I'm going to dedicate wall space to display them then it better be a cool way to do so and here's my start.

I decided to post this here because I want to keep a record of sorts of my progress. That said, here we go...

The first pic is the start of the diorama. I took coffee filters and painted them with watercolors. I painted  10 coffee filters in total. Then I took a specialized hole punch that punches out tiny leaf shapes instead of holes and after punching all the coffee filters I was left with a whole bunch of tiny leaves (but not nearly any many as I'd hoped for and envisioned)  and 2 very sore thumbs.

Second pic show the leaf size. Third and fourth pics show the fruit of my labor.

Fifth pic shows my victim. It's an EG RX-78-2. A bit of weathering, a torn off head, and a bit of rough and tumble on the shield. 

Sixth pic. The weapon that did the RX in. Just did a touch of dry brushing on it (the hand is glued in place because it kept on separating). And speaking of the weapon and the hand, can anyone guess what kit it might be??

Last pic is the dreaded hole puncher. Based on the measly amount I was able to get from 10 coffee filters, I'm afraid that I'm going to have to use it again sooner rather than later. I tried coaxing my girl into punching leaves out for me but she wasn't having it and I don't blame her one bit lol. The rest of the build is going to involve more watercolor painting, some led lighting, and some terrain building. so I hope y'all stayed tuned. I'll update this post when I have more progress.

1mtzlux,https://www.reddit.com/r/wordgames/comments/1mtzlux/game_site/,Game site,"I'd love any feedback on our puzzle site.  There are three different puzzle types that rotate with a different one being featured each weekday.  You can see all the puzzles for free if you register.

SPROUTS is a progressive anagram puzzle.  It starts with a single letter.  At each step you ad a letter and rescramble to produce a word that fulfills the clue until you have a series of 3-, 4-, 5-, 6- and 7-letter-length words that all build on the previous.

FiveSpot is a letter substitution puzzle.  You are given a five-letter word to start.  At each step you swap out one letter and scramble based on the clue.  After the fifth solution you will have a new word that has no letters in common with the original word.

Ouroboros is a word association puzzle where you are given a common word and a clue for a two-word combination starting with that word  (eg: PIE - PLATE).  The second word in that answer becomes the first word in the next combination (eg: PLATE - GLASS) until you work your way around the circle where the second word in the last combo is the original first word (eg: APPLE - PIE).  The puzzle is named for the mythical snake that eats its own tail.  Ouroboros puzzles always run on Wednesdays and are the puzzle for which we get the most positive feedback.

All three puzzles are made to work equally well forward or backward, so you always have the option of jumping forward and working back to a difficult answer.

That said, please note that these are all designed to be commuter puzzles - something to be solved in a few minutes on the subway or over morning coffee.

I’ve been diving into this reddit wiyh multiple opinions , and I keep circling back to this question 

What is Bitcoin


Everyone had their own take, some called it digital gold, others said it’s the future of money, and a few nerds hyping it as a revolutionary database. It seems like the early Bitcoiners have either cashed out, gone quiet, or are still debating the same question.  

So, let’s hash it out:  
- **Is Bitcoin money?** It’s decentralized, borderless, and you can buy coffee with it (sometimes). But with wild price swings and slow transaction times, can it really compete with fiat for everyday use?  
- **Store of Value (SoV)?** The “digital gold” argument is strong—limited supply, halving cycles, and all that. But is it just a speculative asset for HODLers, or does it have staying power as a hedge against inflation?  
- **Database?** Some OGs still argue it’s a secure, immutable ledger that could underpin all sorts of systems beyond finance. But is that just overhyped tech-bro talk?  
- **Or something else entirely?** Maybe it’s a mix,  like cocktail juice or none of the above.  

 What do *you* think Bitcoin is in 2025? 


We’re still arguing over what it is Bitcoin. Money? Store of value? Database? Let’s settle this . What’s your take?

I’ll admit, the bottle design is a huge factor in this. I’m glad to have a generous friend send me a sample of this to dip my taste buds in their juice. 

Proof: 118.3

Age: NAS (Company’s website states aged 5 years before finishing)

MSRP: $89.99

Rating system: https://imgur.com/a/iPG1uHa

Visual: 1.6, medium-thin legs. | 0.5 out of 1 point

Nose: Holy hell, what a tropical nose this thing has. Smells like a ripe mango, a bit of a pina colada nose, too. I get very little of those oaky, coffee notes that I usually find in other toasted or double oaked bottles. It is there, don’t get me wrong, but it’s way underneath all of these other tropical notes. | 2 out of 2 points

Palate:  The mango punches through into the palate. I get a super ripe, super sappy mango note. It’s hard to get any other notes on it as the mango is sooo powerful here. Maybe a bit of oak? If this was a blind, I would not have guessed that this was toasted at all. This is a perfect summer sip, but this is one of those bottles where it’s either an amazing palate or disgusting. I feel like some drinkers may think of this palate as too out of the norm, which I understand. For me, this is a surprising pour, in a good way.  | 3.5 out of 4 points

Finish: A little raw heat for a finish, like a mango habanero spice. Leaves fairly quick, which is the only gripe I really have with this pour.  | 1.5 out of 3 points

Gross score: 7.5

Value: This really depends on the drinker. As my notes show, this thing is super mango-y. I know that mango is a hit-or-miss as a nuanced flavor. If you’re into it, this thing is AMAZING. This is a note I thought I’d NEVER find in a bourbon. There is also very little of the usual toast notes. If you are looking for anything near quintessential bourbon or toasted barrel notes, the value of this would be 0. If you are open to these unusual notes, this is not a bad value. At the same time, $90 isn’t a small chunk of change. I’d gladly pay that for this bottle, but not much more. | 1.0x

Net: 7.5

FINAL VERDICT: At MSRP, this is a sip I think everyone should try out. I know fruity notes exist, but mango is such a far out, untamed fruit note that I never expected to come out of a wood barrel. I guess Dragon’s Milk beer influence bled into their bourbon, and I’m all for it.

Wake Up in a Novel

Chapter 1 Awakening in the Novel

When Freya Stone woke up, her head felt like it was exploding. She rubbed her head and sat up, only to be scared back down by the scene before her.

In front of her were rows upon rows of bags, and the floor was covered with countless clothes. Lying on the bed, she felt as if she were in a sea of bags and clothes. Except for the small empty space beneath her, there was almost no place to step.

Didn't I die?

Freya stared blankly at the ceiling, her mind recalling the despair she felt when she was stabbed to death by a thug, the pain in her heart making it almost impossible to breathe. Indeed, she had died, absolutely no mistake about it.

But the scene before her eyes wasn't fake either.

So, did I time-travel?

Speaking of time-travel, Freya felt that this scene looked very familiar. Where have I seen a room like this before, packed with bags and clothes?

As she thought about it, Freya suddenly widened her eyes and sat up from the bed again...

That novel!

Two days before her death, Freya had read a novel titled ""I Love You, My Mr. Lavette."" In the book, there was a minor character who didn't even qualify as a supporting female character, and she had the same name as Freya. That was why she remembered it so clearly.

This minor character was the wife of the novel's antagonist, a brainless gold-digger who only knew how to spend money. Her existence was meaningless, serving only as a blemish on the antagonist's otherwise perfect life.

At the end of the novel, it was mentioned that the antagonist had been defeated by the male lead. The final scene depicted the minor character lying in a newly rented room, surrounded only by the bags and clothes she had bought in the past, the last things the antagonist owned.

Freya still remembered that passage.

""The only things Louis had left were his wife lying in the bedroom and her expensive bags and clothes. But Louis himself knew that this woman, who never paid him any attention except when she wanted money, would soon leave him with her bags and clothes. He had failed, and he would end up with nothing.""

So, I've time-traveled to after the novel ended?

Freya looked around, her eyes aching from the overwhelming array of colors. But if converted into money, it would still be a considerable sum for her.

She was grateful for the minor character's past habit of shopping sprees, as these items were now left behind. If she had bought houses or cars, they would have been frozen or seized by now.

Rubbing her temples, Freya thought of the now-bankrupt antagonist and sighed deeply. The antagonist's character, family background, and even abilities were impeccable. It was just that he was in competition with the male lead in business, and with the female lead's help, the male lead had foreseen all his plans, leading to his bankruptcy. He was quite an unfortunate fellow.

The reason the minor character had married Louis was purely because her grandpa had once saved his grandpa. Out of gratitude, Louis had married her after she became an orphan.

The minor character was beautiful but only cared about money. After marrying Louis, she had no sense of being a wife and only spent the money he gave her on shopping. The two of them lived separate lives, and now that Freya had taken over, she didn't have to worry about being exposed or Louis giving her a hard time.

Looking at the bags and clothes around her, Freya sighed again. This was probably the most luxury goods she had ever seen in her life, but unfortunately, she had no interest in these things.

Moreover, these items belonged to Louis. The money he gave was out of care for his wife. She wasn't his wife, and now that she was here, she couldn't just take the remaining wealth and leave while Louis was at his lowest point. Besides, the minor character had no relatives, and Freya had just arrived here with nowhere to go.

Chapter 2 Organizing Things

Thinking about the description of Louis in the novel, Freya felt that no matter what, she couldn't abandon him at this moment. In the past, Louis had provided for the minor character, and now that she had taken her place, Freya believed it was her duty to do the same. She could work to support him. If she were to leave, it would only be after he had his own income or career.  

After spending some more time sorting out her memories and thoughts, Freya got up and began tidying up. The minor character had been completely clueless about household chores. Two days ago, upon learning that Louis had gone bankrupt and that she would no longer receive money, she had done nothing but cry and drown her sorrows in alcohol. All the things she had brought with her were haphazardly piled up in the two-bedroom apartment Louis had recently rented.  

It was a miracle Louis had such a good temper and didn't hold it against her. Otherwise, anyone would have been driven mad by the chaos of this place, where there was barely any room to step.  

Organizing all of this was a massive task. It took Freya a full three hours to stuff everything into a corner of her room. The pile now reached the ceiling, with over a hundred bags and more than eighty sets of clothes.  

Looking at the mountain of luxury goods she had stacked up, Freya wished she could trade the clothes for more bags. After all, bags were easier to sell than clothes.  

When she woke up, it was two in the afternoon. Now, it was already past five. Feeling her stomach growling, Freya rummaged through the bag on the coffee table by the door and found her ID card, bank card, and a few hundred dollars.  

She didn't even bother checking the kitchen. Louis and the minor character had just moved in a couple of days ago, and neither of them knew how to cook. The kitchen was undoubtedly empty. She would have to find food herself.  

She could have ordered takeout, but after some thought, Freya decided against it. The apartment had only been roughly tidied up, and she still needed to clean it properly later. The tables and chairs probably weren't clean, and she didn't want to eat while inhaling dust.  

Although the apartment Louis had rented was small, the neighborhood was quite nice, with good security and a convenient location. There were plenty of restaurants downstairs. Freya casually ate a bowl of noodles and, remembering the scarce supplies she had seen in the bathroom, stopped by a nearby supermarket on her way back. She returned carrying a bag of daily necessities. She had also bought items for Louis, choosing colors and styles based on what she remembered he preferred.  

Back at the apartment, she started cleaning again. When she opened the door to Louis's room, she found that aside from a few more items on the bookshelf and desk, the room only contained a bed and a few essentials. Freya sighed helplessly. It was hard to imagine how this man, who had grown up in luxury, could endure such a life now.  

There wasn't much to organize in his room. After a quick look, she wiped the desk, arranged the documents neatly, and then closed the door, returning to the living room to continue cleaning other areas.  

By the time she was finally done, it was already ten.  

After washing up, Freya set her late-night snack on the coffee table in the living room, planning to relax and enjoy the food she had brought back.  

Just as she unwrapped the food and was about to take her first bite, the sound of the front door opening echoed through the room. Freya looked up and met a pair of eyes as dark and clear as glass.

Chapter 3 First Meeting

The owner of those eyes looked at Freya expressionlessly, his gaze sweeping across the room unintentionally. A flicker of surprise flashed in his eyes before his attention returned to Freya.  

At the same time, Freya took in the man before her. He was extraordinarily handsome, living up to the lavish praise the author had used to describe him. However, his striking appearance was overshadowed by his aura. For the first time, Freya understood how someone could resemble an ancient nobleman, someone who could effortlessly transform into a dashing swordsman with a sword, a commanding general on the battlefield, or a dignified scholar with a book in hand, making others feel ashamed of their own inadequacies.  

Unconsciously gripping the fork in her hand, Freya felt a wave of nervousness. She was an imposter, after all. 

Is it possible that someone like him wouldn't notice something's off about his wife?

His eyes seemed as though they could see through everything.  

""Did you hire a cleaner? Do you still have enough money?"" His voice was like the clinking of jade, carrying a hint of husky magnetism.  

Freya instinctively shook her head and murmured, ""No, I cleaned it myself.""  

""You cleaned it?"" He was visibly surprised.  

""Yes, I did it myself,"" Freya replied, taking a deep breath and looking up. He was staring at her with clear astonishment in his eyes.  

Their gazes met for a moment before he was the first to look away. He took off his coat and hung it on the hook by the door. ""Do you still have enough money?""  

""Yes, I do. What about you?"" Freya asked reflexively. He looked at her in surprise again, then replied gently, ""I do.""  

After that, silence fell between them. Louis glanced at the food Freya was eating on the table and suddenly said, ""I'm sorry.""  

""What?"" Freya was caught off guard. Following his gaze, she quickly shook her head. ""No, there's nothing for you to apologize for.""  

Louis walked over and sat down on the couch across from her. He spoke carefully, ""The property issues have mostly been resolved. All the movable and immovable assets under our names have been seized. Although there's nothing left, we don't have any debts either, so you don't need to worry about that. I still have thirty thousand dollars left. After everything is settled, I'll start earning money as soon as possible. Your card should have sixty thousand dollars on it. I've already paid six months' rent for this apartment. If you want a divorce, I'll give you another twenty thousand, and you can stay here until you find a place to rent.""  

Freya knew that Louis had already gone above and beyond for his wife. Their total assets now amounted to only ninety thousand dollars. What he meant was that if they divorced, he was willing to give her eighty thousand dollars and allow her to stay here. He certainly wouldn't take the bags and clothes, which meant he would be left with only the apartment and ten thousand dollars.  

Seeing her silence, Louis added, ""From now on, I'll set aside a portion of my earnings for you every month. At least three thousand, okay? I'm not sure about the future, so that's all I can promise for now. If I ever manage to rebuild my fortune, I'll compensate you.""  

Freya quickly shook her head. Louis fell silent, his entire demeanor quieting. Realizing that her gesture might have been misunderstood, she immediately explained, ""No, I don't want a divorce, and I don't need you to give me money. Don't worry, I still have enough to get by. I've accepted the situation and will spend more carefully from now on. I'll also earn money myself. You don't need to put so much pressure on yourself. Ordinary families don't actually spend that much in a month.""

Chapter 4 Her Cooking Skill

""You don't want a divorce? But yesterday, you said..."" Louis was caught off guard by her response.  

Freya remembered that the minor character had indeed been furious yesterday, calling Louis useless and threatening to divorce him. Her face stiffened. ""Oh, that was because I was drunk. I didn't mean it. I've thought it through now. I can't divorce you at a time like this. Since we're married, I won't leave you now. From now on, I'll take responsibility for our life together. You don't need to worry about me. I can support myself, and maybe even support you.""  

When she looked up, Louis was staring at her with a strange expression. She knew her reaction was a complete departure from how the minor character had behaved before, and for a moment, she didn't know what else to say.  

""If you don't want a divorce, then forget it. Just let me know whenever you change your mind,"" Louis said, not pressing further. He rubbed his temples, exhaustion evident in his features, and then got up to go wash up in the bathroom.  

Freya awkwardly lowered her head and continued eating. She heard Louis pause for a few seconds after entering the bathroom, probably noticing how drastically different it looked after her cleaning. Then, the sound of running water started as he began washing up.  

By the time she finished eating, Louis had also finished washing up. Contrary to Freya's expectation of another awkward encounter, he emerged fully dressed, his unfairly handsome face as composed as ever. He thanked Freya politely and headed to his bedroom, pausing briefly to say, ""You should get some rest too,"" before closing the door.  

Staring at the empty food container in front of her, Freya scratched her head, feeling as though she were in a dream. After organizing her thoughts once more, she went to wash up, then returned to her room and opened her laptop. She applied to open a personal store on an online secondhand marketplace before shutting down the computer and going to bed.  

The next morning, Freya woke up at her usual time of six-thirty. After a moment of thought, she reluctantly got up, tidied the ingredients she had bought the day before, and started brewing coffee. Then, she went downstairs to buy breakfast.  

When she returned, Louis had just stepped out of his room.  

Even early in the morning, the man looked as composed and graceful as ever, with no trace of the exhaustion from staying up late. Hearing the noise, he looked up and, upon seeing the breakfast in Freya's hands, rubbed his eyes as if doubting what he was seeing.  

""Good morning,"" Freya said, holding up the breakfast. ""I bought some food and made coffee. Go wash up, and it'll be ready.""  

Without waiting for a response, she went to the kitchen to check on the coffee, ignoring Louis' bewildered expression behind her.  

Since both of them had stayed up late the previous night, Freya had brewed coffee to help with their fatigue. By now, the coffee was almost ready. She poured two cups into the porcelain mugs she had bought the day before, arranged the breakfast on plates, and boiled some eggs while preparing a simple salad. By the time Louis came out of the bathroom, the table was set with what could barely be called a hearty breakfast.  

The scene looked warm and inviting, but Louis felt none of it. He knew his wife well, married for over three years, she had never shown any talent for housework or cooking. Her only skill was shopping, and the background check before their marriage hadn't mentioned any of these abilities either.  

Was she just pretending this whole time?

The calculating look in Louis' eyes was unmistakable. Freya quickly offered the excuse she had prepared the night before. ""Before, we had maids and helpers, so I never had to do anything. Now that it's just the two of us and we're short on money, it doesn't make sense to keep eating out. My cooking isn't amazing, but it's edible. If you don't mind, you can come home for meals from now on.""

Chapter 5 Keeping Herself Busy

""So, back then, when Grandpa asked if you could cook, were you lying to him?"" Louis sat across from Freya, took a sip of coffee after saying this.

Freya was stunned. What? There was such a thing? 

She quickly brushed it off. ""My skills are nothing compared to the maid's. At the time, I thought Grandpa was used to eating delicacies, so I didn't want to embarrass myself.""

This reason was barely passable, Louis nodded. ""Actually, the taste was not bad.""

Louis drank his coffee quickly, but only ate one bun and a little of the rest. Freya looked at his not-so-slim figure, thinking such a small amount of food couldn't possibly fill him up. Noticing his elegant eating manners, she suddenly realized that asking a man, who since childhood has been accustomed to fine dining, to eat simple food was indeed asking too much of him.

Well, even when a big shot hits rock bottom, he can't just turn into a regular person.

She felt this kind of life was normal, but for Louis, every day was probably torture. Unfortunately, she couldn't afford to provide him with delicacies, so Louis had to make do with mundane food.

After the meal, Louis offered to help take things to the kitchen, but Freya quickly stopped him. ""It's okay, I'll take care of it. I can do the dishes, you go ahead with whatever you need to do.""

Louis put down the plate and fork. ""I haven't finished dealing with the business, I'll probably be back tonight. Don't worry about me, call me if you need anything.""

""Alright, go do what you need to do.""

Once Louis left, Freya finally felt at ease. Even though the man had toned down his aura, the noble air about him was unmistakable, and his imposing presence was still faintly visible. If Freya hadn't met many such people before, she might not have been able to handle it.

Today, she had a lot to do. Not only did she need to furnish the house, but she also had to photograph those bags and clothes to sell online. With so many items, she estimated selling them all could fetch over a million, providing Louis with some initial capital.

Also, she needed to research the web novels of this world and consider returning to her old profession.

Freya was a web novel writer. Her university major was interior design, but after graduation, she didn't want to pursue it as her main career, so she turned to writing. Occasionally, she took on freelance design jobs for extra cash, sometimes helped write promotional materials, and also did handicrafts. She had multiple streams of income and had been living quite comfortably.

After washing the plates and forks, Freya walked around the house, made a list of things to buy, and then went out. She never enjoyed shopping, so she bought what she needed and returned quickly. After putting everything in place, she started photographing the bags and clothes.

After a busy morning, she had only managed to photograph a little over twenty items. At noon, she cooked herself a bowl of noodles and, following her old habit, took a nap until two-thirty in the afternoon., then got up to continue photographing.

By the end of the afternoon, she had only finished photographing the bags and was utterly exhausted. In her past life, she only knew how to shop, spending all day buying things, eating out instead of at home, and refusing to eat much to maintain her figure, leaving her body quite weak.

In the evening, she had oatmeal and reheated the bread from the morning. Freya decisively went back to her bedroom to read web novels. Physical activities were too much for today, so she could only engage in mental labor.

Chapter 6 Intersection

Nearly two hours later, Freya clapped her hands in satisfaction and downed the coffee on her desk in one go. The web novels in this world were a bit behind compared to her original world, meaning she could rewrite all the stories she had written before but in an even better way. This was absolutely delightful.  

She had carefully studied two websites and decided to publish on both. As long as her submissions were accepted, she would update diligently and consistently, then she wouldn't have to worry about making a living.  

Just as she was about to create a new file, she suddenly heard the sound of the front door opening. Freya hesitated for a moment before jumping out of bed and shuffling out in her slippers. She had no choice. This morning, she realized the front door hadn't been locked last night. Louis was probably too used to living in a villa, where security was taken care of for him, and had forgotten that doors in this kind of place needed to be locked manually.

1mtz9ic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1mtz9ic/my_hardest_crush_ever_help_wanted/,My hardest crush ever. Help Wanted 😂,"Hello everyone, I will go straight to the point. Long post coming and thanks in advance to anyone willing to read it.  29 year old male here, I'm of Armenian heritage raised in a EU country. I'm generally very confident with women and I flirt A LOT, except for when I meet a girl I really really like... Like 1 girl out of a 1000. But then I turn so shy you would think I'm a totally different person. I even ignore my crush (I'm Aquarius ♒).So back in November I scroll through FB friend recommendations and I stumble upon a stunning Armenian lady, look at her profile she had only one photo and it said she's living in the same neighborhood as me. But I have never ever in my life seen her..I wasn't going to send no friend request or message as I find it a bit cowardly to approach a woman that way. I always did it upfront in person, sometimes it was smooth and easy while others when I really REALLY like the girl I had to get over some serious hesitation and anxiety to do it but my desire wins so I do it eventually. Even if I shit my pants a little lol😂.So I was curious about her, wondering who she is, asking my friends if anyone knows her, and 2 days after stumbling on her profile me and my homeboys go for a coffee in our favourite coffee place ..... 
Here is a black hair, black eyed lady working as a receptionist. My immediate thought is she's pretty but seemed a bit basic, so I walk in all confident and say some funny BS , as I normally do when I couldn't care less and when not emotionally invested 😂Not flirting just being funny and careless, at the same time being kind and very respectful though..She escorts us to our table and from that moment on she is staring me the whole damn time... Looking at me for the whole hour we were there to the point that it made me uncomfortable. Talking with the waitress while looking at me, then the waitress is looking too, like they say something about me. A little while before we left I catch a glance at her and realise she looks a lot like the Armenian lady who I saw on FB two days ago... I wasn't sure if it was her or not, but I have to admit I was shocked!!! If it was her, and God sent her my way I felt like it was my duty to try to get to know her, I just HAD TO.. I thought : this can't be a coincidence. From that moment on I was f*cked!!!!! Thinking about her day n nite like that  Kid Cudi song 😂I came back twice after but there was another girl working. Then a couple of weeks later I come through the spot with 2 good looking female friends of mine, I know it sounds ridiculous but I said ""good evening, we have a reservation on the name ""XYZ"", and I tell her my Armenian surname..Of course there was no reservation 😂 It was just my stupid plan to know if it was her, and if it was , both of us being Armenian she would say something, especially as she had been looking at me the whole time when we last came there. So when I say my name she smiles from ear to ear, like she was really excited to hear that,but at the same time surprised as there was no reservation at all😂😂 she asks if we are sure we reserved at this place  and not another , and I'm like yeah, 100%!! Then comes at our table and asks ""what was the name ??""..I repeat my surname, she says ""Im Armenian too!"" And had the sweetest look and voice, she was a bit shy and I was almost melting inside but kept it cool on the outward. I say I'm  Half Armenian and Half Greek. She says me too! So turns out we have exactly the same heritage. I ask her her name and that's how we got formally introduced to each other. Turns out she is only 20 years old, I'm 8 years older. This elegant lady is a beautiful Libra ♎.Problem was , I was so into her that the next 2-3 times we went there I was so anxious that I was giving mixed signals, playing it cool and nonchalant and ignoring her but also looking at her. She did the same, always looking at me , then looking away, other times we were staring at each other's eyes blatantly for some seconds from afar but when we came closer it was AWKWARD AS F*CK . She was not looking at me in the eyes and even sometimes giving me the impression that she dislikes me when I tried to talk. Acting like a diva or something. My attitude had a lot to do with that I guess. Othertimes when I came in and said hi to her she was smiling looking at me for a fraction of a second then looking away, like a shy girl would normally do.It was obvious something was up in the air but it seemed like the ice could not be broken at all, and add all this with me many times ignoring her on purpose (STUPID ME) and the vibe definitely got a bit heavy. At the same time though I was plotting looking for a right time to ask her out, because after all it was her work and the place was always busy. This fact made approaching her directly harder for me. Anyways one evening I said f*ck it, its now or never. I initiate some small talk that I really wasn't into,it was really awkward but I had to warm up somehow. She looked happy that we were FINALLY at least talking. Then I tell her, ""look..I really want to get to know you. And that's just being honest with you. I wanna know who you are."" She looked excited but at the same time it felt like she was expecting this would happen eventually, like we both know that something is up. She smiles but looks away and tells me: ""We already know each other"" 
My reply: ""I disagree..we really dont know each other. Would you like to go out for dinner sometime, or a drink? A date. How does that sound? "" I gotta tell yall I was visibly nervous but  the whole vibe between us was really pleasant and at the same time I was confident like I really wanted to do this. She smiled again, looked at me then looked away and said ""this is not possible"". I say playfully:  ""don't tell me you have a bf😂"" she says "" yes, I've been in a relationship for quite some time"".
Now I don't know if the next thing I said was appropriate, but me being cocky and romantic at the same time I told her : "" is he the right one for you though? Because you know how many people in this world are with the wrong person, right? Millions, maybe even billions!!""
She smiles , thinks about it and tells me ""I don't know .. time will tell""
And I'm like ""cool. I accept  and totally respect that. I just really wanted to talk to you and make an effort to get to know you better"" . I wasnt looking sad or anything, really cool I would say.. I felt relieved that I finally talked to her but I was still crushing on her. Thought rejection would make me move on but no..I disappeared for a month, thought it was better not to see her but my friends kept wanting to go there since it's our spot and were like we ain't changing our spot because of her!! So when we go there, it's always the same thing as before I talked to her! We catch each other looking, but we only say hi when I arrive and bye when I leave.Like really formal stuff and Only awkwardness. And constant looking from both her & me. I catch her looking at me all the time, then when I realise it she looks away. I don't know if she is into me or not but I have the biggest crush of my life!!! Haven't been there for almost two months now but my feelings won't change.",0,1755552774.0,Crushes,0,0.5,False
1mtz5ul,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1mtz5ul/i_never_would_have_thought_my_grandfather_would/,I never would have thought my grandfather would introduce me to keto,"I am 25 years old I work in an office and my diet could be summarized as a coffee to start a quick sandwich at lunch and junk food to keep me going in the afternoon. I was always tired unable to concentrate for more than 30 minutes.

Last weekend I was at my grandparents' and I was complaining about my fatigue. My grandfather an old school guy was listening to me nodding his head.

At one point he told me Your problem is that you're trying to heat your house by burning newspaper.

I didn't understand right away.

He continued The sugar and the fast stuff you eat it's like paper or twigs It makes a big flame right away it heats strongly for five minutes and then poof there's nothing left but ashes And you're cold again so you have to put more paper in again and again.

Then it started to make sense.

What you need he said tapping on the table is a good oak log It's harder to light but once it's going it gives you a gentle and constant heat for hours without you needing to tend to it.

This image of the log (proteins good fats) versus the newspaper (sugar) completely blew my mind.

When I got home I started to dig into the subject. I used a [TDEE Calculator ](https://lean-app.com/tdee-calculator/)to get a rough idea of the ""log size"" I needed for my day but it was mostly my grandfather's image that guided me.

It's been barely three weeks since I changed the way I eat. I replaced sweets with almonds I eat more complete meals with vegetables and proteins. The result is crazy. I no longer have the afternoon slumps. My energy is no longer a straw fire it's an ember that lasts all day.

The strangest feeling is no longer having those cravings that drove me crazy. It's a calm background energy. Not the excitement spike from sugar. It's just mega solid.

Anyway I wanted to share this little story. Sometimes the best nutritional advice doesn't come from books or from friends but sometimes from the person you least expect a grandfather and his campfire story.",14,1755552547.0,keto,3,0.94,False

After living in the UK for the past 5 years, I’ve decided to move back to China at the end of August and settle in Shenzhen. While I’m excited to be home, I’d love to keep an English-speaking environment in my daily life and meet new international friends around the Greater Bay Area (Shenzhen/Guangzhou).

A bit about me – I enjoy outdoor activities, staying active through sports, and I’m always up for grabbing a coffee or the occasional drink.

Fun fact: after half a decade in the UK, I’ve mastered the art of talking about the weather for way too long, developed an unhealthy love for fish and chips, and can queue politely in almost any situation.

If you’re in the area and also looking to expand your social circle, feel free to reach out! Always happy to meet for a hike, a workout, or just a good chat over a flat white. ☕🍺

I (F26) and my boyfriend (M30) used to live together—I say “used to” because we are in the process of moving to another country.

Before I go on, I want to make it clear that we have a great relationship. He’s sweet, thoughtful, and would do anything to make me happy.

With that out of the way, this is what happened:

Once I moved, his sister (F27) and her husband (M28) moved into our house because her husband found a job in our city. I like them, and we all get along, so I had no problem with it. Prior to them living in our apartment (we rent, by the way), they would come and spend a week or two with us, and that’s when I realized that they just don’t clean—at all.

They would clean the dishes, but that’s about it: no vacuuming, no mopping, no cleaning the bathroom or anything. They would literally watch us cleaning and not move a finger. Sometimes I would be cleaning the living room and they’d just come and sit down and have an afternoon coffee while I cleaned. To be fair, his sister would ask if we needed help while we were cleaning sometimes, and it honestly bothered me—because you know the house is dirty. Why would you ask? Why can’t you just grab something and clean? Why wait until we’re already doing it to ask? I don’t know, it just made me feel some type of way.

I brought it up with my boyfriend, since she’s his sister, but he wouldn’t say anything, so the two of us would just clean on our day off.

We are very clean and neat people—no shoes in the house type thing. I also have a dog that sheds a lot, who is still living in the apartment. Like I said, we are in the process of moving to another country, so I went first (I’m staying with my mom in a very small apartment), got a job and all the papers needed, and now we are looking for a house so my boyfriend and my dog can move as well.

So, two months after I moved out, my boyfriend told me he was tired of cleaning after them. He spoke to them like three different times, and after the third time he just gave up and stopped cleaning.

Around four months after my move, his sister went to live in a hotel due to her studies program—she has to work and live there, but would come home on her days off. She’d stay two days, sometimes five, and then go back to work.

Now to the present, and the reason I’m making this post.

I just came home after six months, and guys... it was bad. I want to note that my boyfriend tried to do what he could, but there’s a big difference between keeping a clean house clean and cleaning a very dirty house all by yourself. The house needed a really deep clean. The cabinets were filthy, covered in grease, the insides of the drawers were disgusting, walls covered in grease, tomato sauce, dog fur everywhere, sticky things—it was nasty! The house smelled like dog, the couch cushions were dirty, had a strong dog odor, and were covered in fur. As you can imagine, I was pissed.

My trip was very long and all I wanted was a nice shower, some good food, and to go to bed. I didn’t have the energy to deal with it, so I put some flip-flops on and took a shower because I wasn’t going to put my bare feet on that.

The next day, my boyfriend went to work, so when I woke up I just started cleaning the whole apartment, top to bottom—absolutely everything! I finished cleaning at the end of the evening, around 7 pm. That’s also around the time my boyfriend’s sister’s husband came home from work.

Guys... can you believe that the first words out of this man’s mouth were, “Wooow, (bf’s sister’s name) is going to be surprised by how clean the house is.” Boy, was I mad... I didn’t even say anything back—I just looked at him. At that moment, I decided that enough was enough.

I sent a message to my boyfriend’s mom—I absolutely love her, she’s kind, sweet, and always has a solution for everything—so I texted her and explained in detail what’s been going on. She told me I was right for being mad, that everyone has to contribute to the house chores, and that the best solution was assigning chores for everyone. I agree with her, but I don’t think I’m the one who should be assigning chores when I don’t live there anymore.

After that, I had a chat with my boyfriend about it and about the text convo I had with his mom. I told him I planned to talk to his sister and her husband, because again, my boyfriend spoke to them three times and was over it, and I was really mad.

So I waited until the next day because his sister was coming home and had five days off. She arrived, we caught up, and then I talked to both of them (my boyfriend was working). I looked at them and said, “So guys, I wanted to talk to you and I was wondering what happened with the house cleaning since I left, because I can tell the house hasn't been cleaned for a while....”

Y’all, my boyfriend’s sister looked at me and said, “Well, don’t look at me or expect me to clean when I don’t live here.” I kid you not! After that, the conversation went south, as you can imagine—no yelling or screaming, just straight to the point. I told her that even if she doesn’t “live here,” she comes for a few days every week: she cooks, she takes showers, she washes her clothes, she eats, she sleeps here, she’s here. But she doubled down and said she doesn’t have to do anything because she doesn’t live here anymore and she won’t take time on her days off to clean the house. Y’all, I just gave it to her straight. I told her that if there’s someone who doesn’t live in this apartment anymore, it’s me—I’m living in another country. I wasn’t anyone’s maid—not hers, not her husband’s, not my boyfriend’s. We definitely didn’t live the same way, and that’s okay, but the only reason I cleaned was because I wasn’t about to live in filth to prove a point.

She started crying and yelled at her husband, who was just sitting there in silence, saying, “I told you she was coming and the house was beyond dirty and you didn’t clean anything!? Didn’t I tell you this was going to happen? And you still didn’t do anything!” Absolute silence.

Well, it turns out the reason they moved before coming to live with my boyfriend was also because of cleaning issues. My boyfriend’s sister found out through a friend that her roommate was bad-mouthing them to a few friends, saying that they were dirty and didn’t do any house chores, and she was done cleaning after them. My boyfriend’s sister got mad, rented an apartment, and moved out.

A lot was said—she got mad, got up, and left. An hour or so later, she came back and said she’d gone for a walk, spoke to her mom on the phone, and said that her mom told her she was right, it wasn’t her job to clean because she didn’t live there, so her husband and her brother are the only ones responsible for the house cleaning.

Guys, honestly, at this point I’m just mad at everyone. So Reddit, AITAH?",2,1755552239.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

What else can I do?","I worked at a private property doing groundskeeping and maintenance. OSHA standards (29 CFR 1926.51) require employers to provide potable drinking water for outdoor workers.

My employer claimed water was available via outdoor spigots, garden hoses, or a garage fridge. None of these are safe, sanitary, or meet OSHA standards. Filtered water and a coffee station existed only at the company headquarters, not at the worksite where I actually worked. I was expected to bring my own water.

They also claimed the home wasn’t a worksite. Under OSHA, any location where work is performed under employer control is a worksite—so this clearly qualifies.

Despite all this, OSHA closed my complaint and seemed to take the employer’s word at face value. I feel like the agency is dropping the ball and not enforcing clear safety rules.

Has anyone else had OSHA close a complaint even when the employer clearly broke the rules about potable water or misrepresented a worksite? How do you make them take it seriously?",1,1755552104.0,WorkersRights,0,1.0,False

# Dinner (make it the moment)

*  **Steakhouse night:** Reserve a private room or semi-private table; do a shared apps + steaks + bourbon format.
*  **Seafood & raw bar:** Oysters to start, whole fish or grilled plates to split; toast the groom with a local pale ale.
*  **Upscale-casual coastal:** Beach-adjacent spots with lively bars and reservations that actually hold for big groups. 

**Booking rules:**

* Lock dinners 2–3 weeks out; 6–8 for prime Saturdays.
* Confirm 48 hours prior; give the restaurant a final headcount and card-on-file if needed.
*  Order a **family-style sides** spread, the easiest way to make it feel festive fast.

# The Beaches Crawl

**Start:** Cocktail bar near Beaches Town Center → **Lemon Bar** vibes by the ocean → live-music stop → late-night tacos.  
**Why it works:** Walkable, ocean breeze, easy Ubers back to a beach rental.

# Best Washable Round rugs 2025: Stylish & easy Clean

These rugs provide a soft, cozy surface underfoot while also being incredibly easy to clean, a major advantage over traditional rugs. In 2025,the market is filled with a variety of options,making it crucial to choose the right rug for your specific needs and style preferences. This review will guide you through the best washable round rugs of 2025, highlighting their key features, benefits, and who they are best suited for.

[[Explore Top Rated washable round rugs on Amazon.]](https://blog.trendsupplier.com/clearance-specials/?kw=washable round rugs)

## Key Features Analysis

Choosing a washable round rug involves considering several crucial features. This analysis will break down the most critically important specifications to help you make an informed decision.

**Material Composition**

The material composition of a washable round rug is pivotal for both its durability and ease of cleaning. Most high-quality washable rugs are made from synthetic fibers like polyester, nylon, or polypropylene.These materials are known for their resistance to stains, fading, and wear, making them ideal for high-traffic areas. Some rugs also incorporate natural fibers like cotton or wool in blends, but pure cotton rugs may shrink or lose their shape after washing. Look for rugs that specify ""machine washable"" and indicate the fiber content for easy maintenance.

**size and Diameter**

Washable round rugs come in a variety of sizes, typically ranging from 3 feet to 10 feet in diameter. The ideal size depends on the room's dimensions and the furniture placement. A smaller rug (3-5 feet) is suitable for entryways, bathrooms, or as an accent piece under a coffee table. Larger rugs (6-8 feet) work well in living rooms or bedrooms, providing a central focal point and defining the space. Extra-large rugs (9-10 feet) are best for spacious rooms or open-concept layouts.**Non-Slip Backing**

Safety is a critical factor, especially on hard floors.A washable round rug should have a non-slip backing made of materials like latex or TPR (thermoplastic rubber).This backing prevents the rug from sliding or shifting, reducing the risk of accidents, especially for children and the elderly. Ensure that the backing is securely attached to the rug to maintain its effectiveness even after repeated washing. Some rugs use reversible designs, but these typically do not have a non-slip backing.

**Design and Pattern Options**

The aesthetic appeal of a rug is just as critically important as its functionality. Washable round rugs are available in a wide array of designs,patterns,and colors to complement any décor style. From contemporary geometric patterns to traditional floral motifs, there is a rug to suit every taste. Consider the room's existing color palette and furniture style when choosing a design. Neutral colors and simple patterns work well in minimalist or modern spaces, while bold colors and intricate designs add personality to eclectic or bohemian interiors.

**Pile Height**

The pile height refers to the thickness or height of the rug fibers. Washable round rugs typically come in low-pile or medium-pile options. Low-pile rugs are easier to clean and maintain, making them ideal for high-traffic areas or homes with pets. They also provide a sleek, modern look. medium-pile rugs offer more cushioning and comfort underfoot but may require more frequent cleaning. High-pile or shag rugs are generally not recommended for washable options due to their difficulty in cleaning and potential for fiber shedding.

**Washability and Care instructions**

The core advantage of these rugs is their easy maintenance. Confirm that the rug is indeed machine washable and review the specific care instructions. Look for rugs that can be washed in a standard washing machine and dried on a low heat setting. Some rugs may require special detergents or delicate cycles. Avoid using bleach or harsh chemicals, as they can damage the fibers. Regularly vacuuming the rug also helps to prevent dirt and debris from becoming embedded.

## Core Benefits

The appeal of washable round rugs stems from their numerous practical benefits, making them an excellent choice for various lifestyles and home environments.

**Easy Cleaning and Maintenance:** The primary benefit of a washable round rug is the ease of cleaning. Spills, stains, and dirt can be easily removed by simply tossing the rug into the washing machine. This is a significant advantage for families with children, pet owners, or anyone who wants to keep their floors looking pristine without the hassle of professional cleaning.

**Hygiene and Allergen Control:** Regular washing helps to remove dust mites, allergens, and bacteria that accumulate in traditional rugs. This makes washable round rugs a healthier option for individuals with allergies,asthma,or sensitivities to dust. Frequent cleaning also helps to eliminate unpleasant odors and maintain a fresh, clean environment.

**Cost-Effectiveness:** While the initial cost of a washable round rug may be slightly higher than a traditional rug,the long-term savings can be significant. Eliminating the need for professional cleaning services or expensive stain removers translates to significant cost savings over the rug's lifespan. Additionally, their durability means they won't need to be replaced as frequently.

**Versatility and Style:** Washable round rugs are incredibly versatile and can be used in any room of the house. Their round shape adds a touch of elegance and uniqueness to the space, while the variety of designs and colors ensures that they complement any décor style. They can be used to define seating areas, create focal points, or add a cozy touch to bedrooms or playrooms.

**Durability and Longevity:** Made from durable synthetic fibers, washable round rugs are designed to withstand wear and tear. they resist fading, staining, and shedding, ensuring that they maintain their appearance even after repeated washing. This makes them a practical and long-lasting investment for any home.

## faqs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about washable round rugs to help you make an informed purchase.

**Can I put my washable round rug in the dryer?**
Yes, most washable round rugs can be put in the dryer on a low heat setting.However, it's crucial to check the manufacturer's instructions before drying. High heat can damage the fibers or cause the rug to shrink. Air drying is a safer option, especially for rugs made from delicate materials.

**Will the color fade after washing?**
High-quality washable round rugs are designed to resist fading, even after multiple washes. However, using harsh detergents or bleach can cause the colors to fade. Stick to mild detergents and avoid excessive sun exposure to prolong the rug's color vibrancy.**are washable round rugs suitable for pets?**
Yes, washable round rugs are an excellent choice for pet owners. Their easy-to-clean nature makes it simple to remove pet hair, stains, and odors. Look for rugs with a non-slip backing to prevent accidents and ensure your pet's safety. Regularly washing the rug helps to maintain a clean and hygienic environment for both you and your pet.

**How often should I wash my washable round rug?**
The frequency of washing depends on the amount of traffic and exposure to dirt. In high-traffic areas or homes with pets or children, washing the rug every 1-2 months is recommended. for less frequently used areas, washing every 3-6 months is sufficient. Always vacuum the rug regularly to prevent dirt and debris from accumulating.

Pros and cons:

1. I have wanted the Jackalope for longest and love cryptids. I'm having trouble coming up with a name and already have a few bunnies.

2. The Skunk's solid black eyes and forest vibe caught my attention big time. This is a last minute consideration and I'm not sure about the velcro tail.

3. Saw the Skelebara in store while picking up something else, kinda fell in love with her,. I already got the Mini Bean, am tryna get Cookiebara if it comes back and don't know if I want 2 full size capys.


This all started because I wanted the coffee scent for a bear I already own, but got to the store only to realize it's online only. So I'm going to order a bear online with it to swap it to the bear I want it in.. oh the things we do for personalization. 😅",45,1755551762.0,buildabear,12,1.0,False

1mtysyk,https://jaxhumor.com/blogs/learn-about-jacksonville/you-jacksonville-bachelorette-guide,"Jacksonville Bachelorette Guide: Top Ideas, Itineraries & Tips","“Make memories, not itineraries.” Easy to say. Harder to do, unless you’re celebrating in Jacksonville. With miles of beaches, a laid-back riverfront, and nightlife that actually fits grown-up tastes, Jax is a top-tier spot for a bachelorette that’s fun, stylish, and zero-stress.

This guide gives you everything: where to base, what to book, how to budget, and exactly how to stack the day so your crew gets beach time, cocktails, and a killer dinner without sprinting across town. Let’s get this party planned!

Out of the box, the hotel has a 14x11 footprint, no furnishings, and no usable floors on the second or third levels... so naturally, I had to mod it.

Exterior:

* Expanded hotel footprint to 18w x 13d while keeping the original facade and style intact. Baseplate is 20w x 16d.
* Subtle additions to blend with the base design—now scales well with the Cada ""Steamed Bun Shop"" and k/o ""Sanctum Sanctorum Showdown"".
* Added an ""ice machine"" (one illegal technique used) and scooter parking out front (I have too many Vespas from the Dollar Tree).

* Built a full back wall and exit door leading to a fire escape ladder—only way up. Ladder parts were salvaged from the ""Sanctum Sanctorum Showdown"".
* Lobby centerpiece: a fountain, pieced together from Sanctum leftovers.
* Converted the red vending(?) box into a drink machine, placed it indoors.
* ""Continental breakfast"" served all day: tea, cakes, cookies, and chocolate frogs.
* Added way too many plants—got carried away on LEGO Pick-a-Brick flowers.
* Reception desk manned by a reformed Skibidi man (now a grumpy concierge). His boombox head? Repurposed as a speaker, wired up by Riri Williams and blasting Barry Manilow, The Carpenters, and other sweet elevator hits.

**Second Floor:**

* Originally just open beams—added full floor and raised height by 1 brick for proportion.
* Created 2 separate hotel rooms with doors (some tight walkways—one traveler lives dangerously).
* Each room includes: Bed, Desk & chair, Wall-mounted cabinets, Flat-screen TV, Sink,  Complimentary wine + newspaper

* Patio has a bench, tons of greenery (big vine planter = another illegal technique).

This was a fun and cheap little project! 

**Things I learned:** 

The AliExpress bulk brick sellers offer a color called ""light blue,"" but it doesn't match LEGO’s ""Light Royal Blue."" Only Gobricks produces a true match. The ""light blue"" from other bulk sellers is a slightly darker shade. Still, I made do—these bricks were practically free thanks to shopping credits.

**Next up:** 

AliExpress has the Urge small/cheap version of the Detective Agency for $17.41. With coupons and shopping credits, I got the price down to $12.83 including sales tax. For 1,100 parts, that works out to just over a cent per piece. I’ll probably build it once as-is, then take it apart and reuse the bricks.

# Best coffee Filter Stainless 2025: Reviews & Top Picks

The quest for the perfect cup of coffee often begins with the brewing process, and at the heart of it lies the coffee filter. While paper filters have long been the standard, stainless steel coffee filters are gaining immense popularity for their reusability, durability, and potential to unlock a richer, more flavorful brew. As we look ahead to 2025, several top-tier stainless steel filters are poised to dominate the market. These filters promise not only to deliver remarkable coffee but also to contribute to a more sustainable coffee-drinking experience.

This review delves into the leading stainless steel coffee filters of 2025, examining their key features, benefits, and ideal user profiles, and comparing them against the competition. Our aim is to provide you with the information you need to make an informed decision and elevate your daily coffee ritual.

[[explore Top Rated coffee filter stainless on Amazon.]](https://site.properlygeek.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=coffee filter stainless)

## Key Features Analysis

The best stainless steel coffee filters of 2025 aren't just about metal mesh; they're sophisticated engineering marvels designed to extract the maximum flavor and aroma from your favourite coffee beans.

**Filter Mesh Precision:**

The fineness and consistency of the stainless steel mesh are paramount. The ideal filter boasts a tightly woven mesh with microscopic pores that effectively trap coffee grounds while allowing essential oils and soluble solids to pass through, contributing to a full-bodied, nuanced cup of coffee. Leading filters utilize laser-cutting technology to ensure uniform pore size and spacing, minimizing sediment and maximizing extraction clarity. Specifications include mesh counts ranging from 80 to 120 pores per inch, optimized for various coffee grind sizes.

**Material Composition and Durability:**

The choice of stainless steel grade substantially impacts the filter's resilience and longevity. Premium filters are crafted from food-grade 304 or 316 stainless steel, renowned for their resistance to corrosion, heat, and staining.These materials ensure that the filter remains pristine and functional even after prolonged use and repeated cleaning. Furthermore, the thickness of the steel is crucial; thicker gauges provide greater structural integrity and prevent deformation under pressure from hot water and coffee grounds. We consider filters with steel thickness between 0.5mm and 0.8mm as industry standard for optimized durability.

**Filter Basket Design:**

The shape and structure of the filter basket play a crucial role in optimizing water flow and coffee saturation. Conical-shaped filters, akin to classic pour-over brewers, promote even extraction by channeling water through the coffee bed consistently. The angle of the cone, typically between 60 and 70 degrees, is carefully calibrated to ensure optimal contact time between water and coffee. In addition, the incorporation of support ribs or perforated bases enhances airflow and prevents the filter from collapsing under the weight of the saturated grounds.

**ease of Cleaning and Maintenance:**

A hassle-free cleaning process is essential for a convenient coffee-making experience. The best stainless steel filters feature smooth, polished surfaces that prevent coffee residue from clinging to the mesh.Many models are dishwasher-safe, allowing for effortless cleaning.

Over the years I’ve tried the local roaster here in Stouffville, a few others around the GTA, and even some from BC, and it’s been cool to see how different they all taste.

I’m thinking of launching something around this soon and would love to connect with others who are into the same thing. If you’re a fan of naturals, geishas, or just coffees that surprise you with flavor beyond the usual chocolate/nutty notes, I’d love to hear what you’re drinking these days.

I just moved to Munich 26M  and I’m looking to meet some like-minded people who enjoy hanging out without alcohol. Whether it’s grabbing coffee, exploring the city, going for a walk, or checking out museums, I’d love to connect with others who prefer sober activities.

1mtydr2,https://i.redd.it/mh7fw78vdujf1.jpeg,The Donut That Never Left,"Jelly-filled. Pink icing and rainbow sprinkles delicately blanketed the top of its exquisite, glistening mass. This delightfully devious little body made of sugar, fried dough, and strawberry-flavored goop tempted me to the point of no return. I pressed the tip of my index finger against the glass and said,

""This one.""

I knew I shouldn't have. But I'd been so good lately. I deserved a treat. And besides, I'd make up for it at the gym later, then pound a fuck-ton of water and flush that bitch right out. Yeah, it's no big deal. It's Friday: cheat day. And this week's been hell. I *needed* this.

""That'll be $1.99, sir.""

The lady at the counter smiled and handed me the bulging bag. I held it close, pressing its warm weight against my chest. My mouth pooled with saliva as I slid her my debit card. 

""Anything else?""

I glanced back toward the glass dome filled with plump pastries, then shook my head. They all looked like whores, slathered in chocolate and cheaply seductive—no substance. Nope, I had everything I needed right here in this greasy white paper bag. *Mine* had fruit. She handed my card back over and said, 

""Have a nice day!""

I grinned, looking down at the bag cradled in my arms. I sure as shit will, I thought. Then, I hurried back to my car to devour this goddess of a donut in seclusion. I needed privacy; this was a moment to be savored. Carefully, I eased my hand into the bag's opening until the tips of my fingers met her soft, pillowy posterior. Once I'd gripped onto the end, I gently pulled to reveal divine perfection. 

The icing lay undisturbed; every single sprinkle had held on. It didn't feel right to just go in at it. No, it was too beautiful to be ravaged like that. It begged to be adored and cherished—worshiped. I couldn't just bite into this donut like some sort of monster. The jelly would spill out all over, and I didn't have any napkins. 
 
I held it up to my face, admiring the flawless sheen of its glaze in the soft morning light. I inhaled deeply, slowly taking in the heavenly scent that filled me with euphoria. Then, I slid my tongue gently across the surface of its sweet, crispy skin. And that's where it all began. This simple little act of mindless self-indulgence would later become the single biggest regret of my life.

Yet, a smile crept across my face as the intense warmth of this magnificent exterior overwhelmed me. I had one thought, and one thought only: I needed to get to what was inside. Slowly, I sank my teeth deep into its sugary flesh, carefully removing the tiniest of morsels and releasing a floodgate of warm, red jelly. I let the intoxicating, chunky viscus pour into my mouth and surrendered to the ecstasy. 

After that, I blacked out.

When I came to, I'd devoured the whole thing. Not a trace of it remained; even my fingers had been licked clean and sucked dry. I searched the bag, hoping there might be a tiny smidge of icing left behind, but nothing. Not even a sprinkle. It was all gone. *Shit,* I don't even get to keep the memory of enjoying it? Why did I scarf it down so quickly? 

The only evidence that I'd even done so was the lump pressing hard at the back of my throat as the last bite of my breakfast made its way down my esophagus and onto the gullet. Guess I need to work on that whole *'self-control'* thing.

As I drove to work in my sugared-up intoxication, the lump began to squirm. Must be a burp trying to come out, I thought; probably swallowed a fuck ton of air during my binge-fit. I slammed my fist against my chest, but it didn't help. Instead, I could feel my throat tightening around the bulge, trying to push it down. No—the opposite. It felt like that hunk of donut was forcing its way down, in spite of my body trying to stop it. What the fuck. 

My eyes watered as I began to cough, choking on the wad of dough that had now firmly planted itself just above my sternum. The bitch wasn't moving at all. I struggled to keep my eyes on the road as I frantically searched the floor of my passenger seat for a half-empty bottle of water. Finally, I laid my hand on one, leaned my head back, and chugged. 

Down she went, without a fight. I smiled and threw the empty bottle back down onto the floor where it belonged. Then, I took a deep breath of relief. *God,* how stupid would it have been if I'd choked to death on a fucking donut? Embarrassing. I wiped my eyes and continued down the road. 

By the time I got to work, the donut had reached my stomach, landing like a boulder dropped off a cliff. I ran to the bathroom, thinking I had to take a shit. I sat in that stall straining for at least 10 minutes, but nothing came out. So, I stood up and pulled my pants back on. Then, I turned around and looked at the toilet. I froze. There, floating in the water, was a single blue sprinkle.

My eyes widened, and I blinked a few times. Then, I leaned forward to make sure I was really seeing what I thought I was. Yep—a sprinkle. Not a poop-sized one. A regular one. My body snapped upright. No fucking way that came out of my butt. It had to have been on my pants. I just didn't notice. Yeah, of course, that's what it was.

I walked from the bathroom laughing at myself for getting freaked out, even momentarily. My stomach was still killing me, though. The damn donut was sloshing around in the water I'd chugged like a ship caught in a storm. With each step I took, I could feel it rocking back and forth. 

*Gurgle, gurgle. Slosh, slosh.*

When I got to my desk, I started searching around in all the drawers for a roll of Tums. I got excited for a second, until I realized it was just the empty wrapper I'd left myself to be fooled by later. Past me is such an asshole. 

*Gurrrrrp!*

""Shut up.""

Fuck. I had to do something, and quickly. My stomach was visibly rippling at that point, and I could barely stay seated. I thought about undoing my belt, but I didn't want to get accused of being a pervert. Especially not after I accidentally elbowed Sharon from accounting in the boob last week. That was her fault for crowding me at the coffee pot, though. Unfortunately, HR didn't see it that way.

Wait—coffee! That'll make me shit, I thought. Even though my stomach was past maximum capacity, it seemed like my only option. Besides, a shot of black coffee to the gut might just actually do the trick to move this mass along. The bitch had already overstayed her welcome. It was time for an eviction notice. 

I hurried to the break room to find Sharon at the coffee pot. *Of course.* I kept my distance as we silently exchanged awkward glances. I didn't want to look her in the eye, so I stared at the coffee pot in her hands instead. I was so uncomfortable. I could barely keep still as my gurgles and groans echoed through the otherwise empty room. She cut her pour short, grabbed a handful of Sweet'N Low packets, then rushed out of the door while covering her nose. *Pftt*—probably thought I was farting. Believe me, lady. I wish I *could* fart.

I poured a splash and a half into my cup and threw it back, still scalding. It burned all the way down, but I didn't care. The pain in my throat was a welcome distraction from the mayhem that was going on in my stomach. The roof of my mouth was going to be fucked for a day or two. But, I figured, if it worked, it would all be worth it. After all, this was my last-ditch effort to be able to make it through the rest of my workday. 

It also turned out to be a big mistake.

The searing black liquid landed with an eruption. I immediately doubled over in the worst pain I'd ever felt in my life. The wad of sugary dough had begun to thrash violently, slamming itself against the walls of my stomach. No, I'm not fucking joking. I could feel it. Not just in my stomach—with my hands, too. I literally felt this donut pounding from the inside out, lifting my skin as it pushed against its gastric prison. 

I ran full speed to the bathroom, praying I'd make it there before I passed out, vomited, or shit my pants. Or, all three. My belly bounced as I ran, suddenly swollen like a puppy with worms. I thought I was bloated before, but now I was literally about to pop. The movement made the pain infinitely worse, but I had no choice. Fuck this. It had to come out.

The stall door slammed against the wall, and I fell to my knees, gripping the toilet in preparation. My face was ice-cold and clammy. Warm saliva flooded my mouth. Yes! Come out! Be gone, bitch! 

*GUUURRRPPP*

I began to heave and spit into the toilet. The mass was so close I could taste it, but nothing was coming out. It was fighting me. I shoved my finger down into my throat, scraping against the burnt roof of my mouth. I winced from the pain, and my eyes started watering uncontrollably. A few gags, and up she came. 

A putrid flurry of pink sludge spewed from my mouth, swirled with a deep, crimson red foam. It splattered back up into my face when it hit the toilet at lightning speed. Fuck, so much came out of me, I can't even explain it. But that was only phase one. Next came the chunks. 

By the time I was done, I thought I was going to lose consciousness. The room was spinning, and I struggled to catch my breath, so I lowered myself onto the floor, still hugging the toilet. 

I couldn't help but inspect this ungodly force that had just come out of me. Slowly, I lifted my head and peeked over the seat. *Holy fuck.* I gazed down at the thick pink vomit in utter shock and disgust. Shit, it looked like I'd barely even chewed this donut. Even the rainbow sprinkles had all remained whole, floating around in the sludge like tiny specks of whimsy in a cotton candy-colored massacre. Surrounding them were a few large globs of fleshy beige, accompanied by several smaller red clumps. *Christ.* I just *had* to get the one with fruit, huh?

Suddenly, my eyes fixed on the largest red chunk floating in the middle of the sludge. It looked different than the other ones. Shaped weird. And it was... *moving?* I wiped my eyes. Yes—it was fucking moving! Convulsing. Constricting. Sputtering red goop from both ends. *No fucking way.*

I stood up so fast, I nearly fell backwards out of the stall. Black spots began to appear in my line of vision. I gripped onto the threshold with both hands as I swayed, trying to regain balance. I held my breath and slowly leaned forward to look again. It stopped.

Oh, thank God. It *wasn't* moving. Get it together, bro. It's just a chunk of strawberry; how could it be moving? I almost wanted to poke at it, but considering how vile the mess I'd made in the toilet was, I resisted that urge.

The hinges of the bathroom door creaked, and footsteps began to approach. I quickly reached over and flushed the rainbow sprinkled slurry. It smelled like death—sickly sweet with a hint of berry. I desperately tried to fan the stink away with one hand while wiping my face with the other.

When I exited the stall, Jerry from sales was at the urinal. He turned to look at me as I approached the sink, visibly disgusted by the pungent odor that had completely filled the room at that point.  

""Gnarly case of food poisoning,"" I told him. 

He nodded, then focused his eyes back in front of him. With a splash of water and a squirt of soap, I quickly washed my hands and ran out of there. On the way back to my desk, I bumped into my boss, who promptly asked what the hell I'd been doing all morning. 

""Sorry, sir. I think I'm coming down with something.""

He folded his arms in front of him and scrunched his eyebrows. 

""That's the excuse you're going with this time?""

""Ask Jerry, he'll tell you. I was just in the bathroom. If you want proof, go in there and take a big whiff."" 

""Alright, that's enough,"" he said. ""Just make sure that report is on my desk before lunch, then you can leave if you need to. And don't forget, you're still on disciplinary probation after last week.""

""Yes, sir.""

Fuck. I forgot all about that damn report. I hadn't even started it yet, and it was almost 10:00. At least my stomach was starting to feel better. My abs were sore from all the heaving, but now that just meant I could skip the gym later. I'd already puked up the donut anyway, so the carbs didn't count. 

Shit, what a weird ass morning I was having—almost got killed by a donut twice. What an evil bitch! She tempted me, then tortured me. Well, lesson learned. Not going back to that bakery again. At least now she was gone, and it was over. 

I sat down at my desk, opened up a Word document, and began typing nonsense. My thoughts were all jumbled up, and my head was throbbing from straining so hard. I kept having to retype each sentence over and over until it made sense. Before I knew it, another hour had gone by, and I was sweating. 

My hand reached up to wipe away the droplets accumulating on the ridge of my brow. Right away, I noticed something weird. My sweat was thick. Like... *goop.* I slowly pulled my hand away in confusion to look at the substance that had just excreted from my pores. 

It was clear, like sweat's supposed to be. But there was a ton of it. And it didn't drip. No—instead, it gathered in a rounded clump at the edge of my fingertips. Then, I pressed my fingers together. It was sticky, too. *Oh, god.* I slowly raised my hand up to my lips and tasted. It was fucking *sugar.*

Okay... something weird is definitely going on. What the fuck was in that donut?! I had to leave work. Immediately. To hell with this damn report. I needed to go home and start googling. And also take a shower, because my face and hands were all sticky. Oh—and I still smelled like vomit, too. 

I got up and left everything on my desk as it was, including the open document of word salad on my computer screen. Hopefully, my boss would see all that and realize this was an emergency. If not, oh well, whatever. I'll just deal with it on Monday, I thought.

I raced home, taking a different route to avoid having to pass that bakery. I felt like just the sight of it might make me sick again. There had to be something wrong with that donut. I felt totally normal until I met that sugary bitch. Maybe it really was food poisoning. *Fuck*—the strawberries! E. coli, duh. *Damn*, should've gotten one of the whores; chocolate would've never betrayed me like that.

Food poisoning didn't exactly explain the sugary sweat, but I was still convinced that's what it was. Maybe I got so sick, I'd started hallucinating? Yeah, that *had* to be it. Ha! That donut wasn't actually thrashing in my stomach. The strawberry chunk wasn't ever moving. And the goopy sweat? Probably just some leftover glaze I didn't realize was there. *Pftt.* I shook my head and chuckled to myself. There was nothing to worry about. It'll pass.

I got home, threw my keys onto the side table, and headed straight for the bathroom. I decided to brush my teeth first. My breath was so rank I couldn't stand it anymore, and the taste of sugar and stomach acid still lingered on my tongue. I brushed the hell out of my entire mouth for at least 2 1/2 minutes, then spit into the sink. When I saw what had come out of my mouth, I almost choked. 

Sprinkles. A bunch of them. God, how did they all get stuck in my teeth like that? How did I not feel them? I cupped my hand under the faucet and rinsed my mouth out a few times. Each time I spit, more came out. It seemed to be an endless supply of them, like there was a God damned sprinkle dispenser somewhere behind my molars. But finally, after the fifth rinse, I ran my tongue across my teeth and didn't feel any more. So, I got into the shower and figured if anything else weird happened, I'd just worry about it then.

Then, something else weird happened.

I turned the hot water on, stepped under the stream, closed my eyes and began running my hands across my skin. My entire body felt tacky and gross. I reached up to find that my hair felt the same way—it had formed into five or six clumps on the top of my head. *Yuck.* Instantly, I pulled my hand away and opened my eyes to grab the shampoo bottle. That's when I noticed it. 

The water that was dripping from my body was milky white. *What the fuck?* I jumped back from the shower head and looked up. The water coming out of it was clear. I scrunched my eyebrows, then slowly looked back down. The thick, milky drippings had started to collect in a pile, clogging up the drain. 

I tried to slide the clump away with my foot, only to have it spread itself in between my toes, like when you step on a glob of peanut butter. It sent a shiver down my spine, and I started flapping my foot around trying to fling the goop off of it, but it wasn't moving. So, I reached down to dislodge whatever it was by hand. Just then, I was hit with an oddly familiar scent. The same one that had filled the air of that bakery. *Sugar.* 

*Jesus H. Christ*—did I try to fuck it?! Just how much icing did I smear on myself? Shit, I must've rubbed that fucking donut all over my body. Hell no, man. I've done some weird shit in my life, but never with food. That thing must've been drugged! 

My hand shot up to my forehead, and my eyes raced back and forth as I desperately tried to remember anything at all from the ten minutes or so I had blacked out. Nothing. Not a damn thing. God, I *had* to have been slipped something. That was the only explanation that made sense.

My heart started pounding and I began to feel woozy. I was obviously under the influence of some type of drug, but I had no idea what. I quickly washed my hair, then grabbed the loofah and started frantically scrubbing my body from the top down. 

When I reached my butt, I used my hand to wash in between my cheeks since the loofah's too rough. I was immediately disgusted to find there were little specks of something buried deep within my ass crack. 

I didn't even need to look—I knew what they were. But still, there I was, gawking down at my hand in complete and utter shock nonetheless. Sprinkles. At least a dozen or more. 

I was ashamed and completely disgusted with myself. I couldn't believe I'd actually scratched my ass while eating that donut! Shit, hopefully I waited until after I was finished. But, either way, that meant my fingers were... and then I... Oh, *God.* 

Whatever—nothing I could do about it now. I rinsed the butt sprinkles from my hand, then continued down to my legs. They were dry. Like, *really* dry. I'm talking sandpaper. Large flakes of my skin started to slough off as I scrubbed, plopping onto the shower floor like tiny, wet crepes. 

I've never been good about moisturizing, and to be honest, I usually don't even wash anything below the knees, but today I had to. They must've just been overdue for a good exfoliating, I thought. 

Once I got out and toweled myself off, I noticed my upper body felt waxy and smooth. Too smooth. It was like a slight, buttery layer of film sitting on top of my skin. My bottom half was the opposite. I thought all those skin flakes coming off would've helped, but my legs still looked extremely dry—almost scaly. I dropped the towel and reached down with my bare hand. When my fingers touched one of the flaked-off portions of my calf, my heart sank. My skin... it felt *crispy.*

Hell no—I am *not* dealing with this right now. I'll just lotion them later if they still feel rough when I sober up. I shook my head, then leaned forward over the sink to look into the mirror. My pupils were enormous, and a fresh coat of glaze covered my face with a lustrous, glossy sheen. 

*Shit... you're tripping balls, man.*

There was nothing I could do but try to wait it out. If I went to the hospital and started explaining my '*symptoms*', I'd be fitted for a brand new pair of grippy socks in a heartbeat. No. There was no need to panic. I just needed to let whatever the hell drug this was wear off. Run its course. Yeah, it's no big deal. It'll be okay.

I thought sleep would be the answer. So, I hurried off to my bedroom and started covering all the windows with dark blankets to block out the midday sun as best I could. I didn't even bother putting clothes back on—I figured I'd end up sweating like a pig during this detox anyway. No need to dirty another pair of underwear. 

By the time I'd finished blacking out the room, I was already starting to feel like I was burning up. It was like an oven had suddenly kicked on inside me. I plopped myself down onto the bed, splayed out like a starfish, and waited. 

First, the nausea returned. I had to close my eyes to stop the ceiling from spinning. Then, the heat within me intensified. This fierce burning sensation started to tear through my body, radiating deep from my core. *Oh, God.* It was almost unbearable. I clenched onto the bedsheet underneath me with both fists and tried desperately to control my breathing. A buzzing sensation began to spread through my body, like every cell inside me vibrating all at once. My eyes rolled into the back of my head, and the room went black. 

When I woke up, the slivers of sunlight that had been peering out from the sides of the blankets were gone. My eyes darted over to the little red numbers piercing through the darkness of my room. It was 5:00 AM. *Jesus Christ*, I'd slept the entire rest of the day and all through the night. 

I remained still for a moment, trying to assess my mental and physical state, praying everything had gone back to normal. The nausea had passed, but my body was still burning up. My mouth was unbelievably dry, and the air in my room felt stagnant and heavy. It seemed to push down from above like a weighted blanket—smothering me. I forced in a deep breath, and when I did, I noticed the smell. That fucking *smell.*

However, it wasn't until I attempted to reach up and wipe my face that I began to truly realize the horror I'd woken up to. My arm. It wouldn't move—it was stuck to the bed. The other one, too. And... and my legs. *What the fuck??* My head shot up in a panic, and the pillow came with it.

When I looked down at my body, my jaw dropped open. I was huge. I'm talking gigantic. Bloated, puffy, and round beyond belief. I'd gone from a size 34 pants to at least a 52. Not even joking. It was like I'd gained a hundred pounds overnight. I couldn't believe it. This couldn't be happening. I'd slept almost 20 hours—the drug should've worn off!

As I glared down in shock, I could see that my now rotund upper body was caked in a thick, opaque layer of pasty goop. It had dripped and clung to the bed, sticking to the skin of my back and arms like a human glue trap. 

From the waist down, I was surrounded by a large, dark red stain on the sheets. Is that—? *No. Can't be.* I blinked a few times, then squinted as my eyes strained to adjust. The mystery red liquid had dried to a crust at the edges, forming a giant congealed mass beneath me. 

I struggled to lift myself up further, forcing my neck forward as hard as I could. Then, I gave myself one good push. As my body squished against itself, more of the thick red goo suddenly appeared... oozing… from my fucking belly button.

The secretion slowly slid from the side of my stomach into the pile below, landing with a wet *plap.* Instinct took over, and I started to thrash and writhe against the bed, desperate to free myself from this disgusting, sticky goop from hell. 

Peeling my top half from the sheets felt like ripping off a massive band-aid. Thick white strings clung to me as the gummy substance stretched and pulled at my skin, trying to force me back down. I bit down hard on my bottom lip and just went for it. I'll admit it—I screamed. Screamed like a bitch. 

Once my arms were free, I moved on to my legs. The red stuff was worse. Much thicker, less give. It was agonizing. Huge, crispy strips of flesh tore from my legs, remaining glued to the clotted red mess that had leaked from my unrecognizably grotesque body. After I'd completely broken free from my adhesive prison, I hobbled to the bathroom, dripping the entire way. 

I stared at myself in the mirror, my gargantuan, sugar-slathered body shaking uncontrollably. *Fuck*. I shouldn't have just gone to sleep. I should have dealt with this when I had the chance. That donut wasn't drugged, it was cursed. Something in it. A demon—possessing me. Changing me. It had hollowed me out and was growing inside me.

I collapsed onto the cold floor and buried my face in my hands as I began to cry. Not tears, of course. Instead of droplets of wetness, I felt little taps of grit. I ripped my hands away from my eyes. 

Sprinkles. Rainbow fucking sprinkles. 

An animalistic shriek erupted from my lungs, and I hurled them across the room. They hit the wall with a *ping*, scattering all over the floor like confetti at my funeral. Mocking me. 

I pulled myself back up to my feet, limped over to the shower, and got in. I scrubbed, wincing in pain as the loofah scraped against my raw skin. To distract myself, I started trying to weigh my options. I couldn't ignore this anymore. I knew I needed help, desperately. I just didn't know who to turn to. Shit, doctors wouldn't know what to do with me at this point—whatever was happening to me had very quickly devolved into something modern medicine couldn't do shit about. 

I thought about calling my cousin, Sonia, in Maine. Her husband had gone through some weird body shit recently. Maybe she'd know what to do. She'd been vague about the details of what happened to him when she told me about it a few months ago. Something about fish? What I did remember was she had been very clear about one thing: it didn't end well. 

Scratch that. If she couldn't help him, she definitely couldn't help me either. I gripped the loofah tighter, my body trembling from the pain and fear. I had to do something. I couldn't allow myself to crumble under the weight of my insane circumstance. I refused to let this *thing* take over. 

I shuffled out of the tub, almost slipping on the pink sludge I'd left behind as I lifted my massive, jiggly leg over the side. I carefully dried myself off, soaking up the leftover glaze from my creases. Then, I shakily began trying to bandage up the gaping wounds on my legs.

They were oozing the same shit that had come out of my belly button. I set a piece of gauze down on top of one of the rips in my flesh, and the redness seeped through instantly. It wasn't blood. Deep down, I already knew that. Still, I reached down, scooped up a dollop with my fingers, and sniffed it. *Strawberry.*

Whatever the fuck was happening to me, I was powerless to stop it alone. There was only one thing left I could do. So, I threw a blanket over my half-glazed naked body, since none of my clothes fit anymore, then scuttled out to my car and began tearing down the street—headed toward that fucking bakery.

The door slammed against the wall with a loud bang as I busted through. The stupid little bell dislodged and went sliding across the floor. The place was empty, except for the lady behind the counter. She looked up at me and smiled. 

""Welcome back! Did you enjoy your donut, sir?""

I just stood there in the doorway for a moment, completely dumbfounded, as her smile widened into a sinister, toothy grin. Did I *enjoy* the donut? The sheer audacity of this woman. There I was, shaped like a fucking eclair, covered in only a blanket and dripping red goop everywhere. I sure as shit did not.  A fiery rage began to simmer within me. And then, I exploded.

*""WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO THAT DONUT?!?!”*

She laughed. 

""Why, nothing, sir. Nothing at all.""

""Bullshit! What the fuck is happening to me?!"" I demanded. 

""Exactly what was meant to happen,"" she answered. 

""You cursed it! *Christ,* I fucking knew it!! What is this, huh? Some kinda donut voodoo shop?!""

She shook her head and chuckled dismissively.  

""Sir, I just sell the donuts. I don't make them."" 

I stormed up to the counter and threw the sticky blanket down onto the ground, revealing the gruesome form I was now trapped inside of.  

""I don't give a shit who makes them! I want to know why the hell this is happening to my body!!"" 

""Isn't it obvious?"" she giggled. ""You are what you eat."" 

I slammed my fist down onto the counter.

""I want to see your fucking manager, NOW!""

""Of course, sir. Right this way.""

She calmly stepped away from the register and gestured for me to follow her to the back of the bakery. I stomped down the long, sterile, white hallway as she casually led the way, glancing over her shoulder every so often with a smirk. I didn't know what I was going to say when I got to wherever we were going, but I needed answers—and this bitch apparently wasn't going to tell me jack shit. 

We reached a large door at the end of the hall with a sign that said '*MDI*' in big, bold, red letters. It was fitted with a padlock and a keypad near the handle. The lady pulled out a set of keys and fiddled with them while I waited impatiently. Finally, she opened the lock, unlatched the door, then hovered over the keypad as she punched the numbers in. A loud beep pierced through the silence, and the door slowly squealed open. 

Inside that room was the most incomprehensible horror I could've ever dared to imagine. A being so grotesque—so shocking. It froze me in place as I struggled to make sense of the unholy sight before me. 

It filled the entire room. Not only in size, but in presence. It felt ancient. And powerful. Something beyond this world... this universe. I was in awe, and yet, overwhelmed with revulsion at what I was forced to behold.

Thick, pulsating lines of bulging, red jelly snaked around doughy coils of glossy, beige flesh like veins. Layers of soured pink icing dripped from beneath a heap of encrusted rainbow sprinkles embedded firmly atop its hideous, glistening mass. This sickeningly enormous body made of sugar, fried dough, and strawberry-flavored goop terrified me to my absolute core. 

It had no eyes—just mouths. Dozens upon dozens of perfectly round gaping holes stretched across the front of it, each filled with rows of tiny, sharp, crystalline teeth that sparkled under the heat lamps above. 

And, it breathed. The coils slowly lifted and fell like folds in a stomach, as gurgling globs of chunky red viscera sputtered from the center. Steam radiated from its crispy posterior. Each time it shifted, the smell of sugar and yeast filled the air. Suffocatingly sweet and warm with rot. 

Suddenly, the door slammed shut behind me. I tore my eyes away from the monstrosity to look at the counter lady, who was now standing in front of the door, blocking my only way out. 

""*What the fuck is that?*"" I uttered with wide eyes. 

She narrowed her gaze, and the smile dropped from her face.

""Mother Donut calls to us all... and we answer."" 

I turned to look back at the oozing, demonic atrocity. 

""*This?* This is what I'm turning into?!"" 

""No, don't be ridiculous,"" she said. ""This is what created you. And those who came before you. Go on—speak to her. Ask your questions."" 

I gulped hard as I looked up at this sugary mammoth towering over me, then finally mustered up the courage to ask, 

""What's happening to me? What... *am* I?""

The plethora of holes began to move in unison as the bellowing growl of a hundred voices emitted from the effulgent mass at once. 

""You are my offspring. My sweet creation. And from within you, my seed shall spread.""

Blackness crept in from the corners of my vision as I zeroed in on this ungodly creature. I was no longer afraid. I was furious. I'd been infected with some sort of parasitic donut spawn? And for what—all because I just wanted to enjoy my cheat day? What kind of horse shit is that?? It wasn't fair... I deserved a treat!

""No, the fuck it will not!"" I screamed. ""You better undo this shit right now! Fix me back like I was or..."" 

My voice began to crack with desperation. 

""Or, I'll fucking kill you!! I didn't sign up for this shit, man! It... it was just a God damned donut!""

Giant, red bubbles suddenly spewed from her center mass like lava from a volcano. They popped and splattered my face with piping hot, rotten jelly as a guttural laugh vibrated from the mouths. 

""It cannot be undone,"" she said. ""The transformation is nearly complete, my child."" 

""Please... *oh, God*... no!"" I begged. ""I don't deserve this!!""

She growled. 

""You chose this. You agreed to it. The terms of purchase were stated clearly on the receipt you left behind on the counter without a glance."" 

The room went dead silent. I was too late. Too stupid. Too fucking self-indulgent and careless to prevent my own demise. There was nothing I could do—nothing left to say. It was time to deal with this. Time to face the facts. I was fucked. 

Sprinkles began to trickle down my face. The oven inside me suddenly shot up to 350 degrees. I bolted towards her—full speed, fists wailing. If I was going down, this bitch was coming with me. 

Just before I reached her, I felt a sudden, sharp pain in the back of my head. I fell backward, and my body hit the ground instantly with a massive thud. I looked up and saw the counter lady standing over me, now blurry, and holding a rolling pin. Then... darkness, and the faint echo of a wet, bubbling laugh. 

When I awoke, I couldn't move, but I could see. My eyes darted all around. I was no longer in the lair of the beast. Instead, I was in a white room, surrounded by a warm, fuzzy, bright light. Everything looked soft and inviting. Placid. Peaceful. Perfect. I thought I had died. I thought maybe I was in heaven. I couldn't have been more wrong. 

*BAM!!!!!*

A giant fingertip slammed down from above, pressing hard against some sort of invisible forcefield around me. It was... it was *glass*. I was under a fucking glass dome—lying next to a chocolate whore. I tried to scream, but nothing came out. Panic surged through my jelly-filled veins.

I was paralyzed. Powerless. Positively petrified. My strawberry heart thrashed hard against my pink-slathered, rainbow-sprinkled chest as a booming voice rattled the tray beneath me. 

It said,

1mtydgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1mtydgc/does_the_zulay_kitchen_z1_milk_frother_deserve/,Does the Zulay Kitchen Z1 Milk Frother Deserve Its 4.4-Star Review?,"Testing out the Zulay Kitchen Milkfothers Milk Frother, I was genuinely intrigued by its promise of instant frothy magic. Being an everyday coffee enthusiast who craves a perfectly frothed cappuccino and lush macchiato, I put this handheld milk frother through its paces. The lavender blush shade adds a refreshing flair to any countertop, which my sister immediately appreciated—it matched her kitchen decor flawlessly. The Zulay Kitchen Milkfothers managed to impress in a variety of aspects, but, like with anything, a few minor details stood out as areas where it could improve.

**Stylish Design and Build Quality**  
This little frother made quite a first impression with its classy lavender blush exterior. The stainless steel whisk looks sleek and promises durability. With a compact electric design, it easily fits into a kitchen drawer, though the included metal stand ensures it stays accessible on your counter. While sturdily built, it’s also lightweight, which made it easy for me to hold during longer frothing sessions without strain. My only curiosity was with the battery compartment—it required a little extra effort to pop open, but it’s reassuring that there were no unintended slides while in use.  

[Ready to snag Zulay Kitchen Milkfothers? See the Amazon price here.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0d1ljlk2k/)

**Ease of Use for Everyday Tasks**  
Using this battery-operated tool, particularly for my morning cappuccino routine, was simple and effective. It's powered by four AA Duracell batteries, which are thankfully included. I appreciated the straightforward operation: just a single button to push, no fumbling with complicated settings. Whether it was whole milk, almond, soy, or even half-and-half, this frother consistently whipped up a velvety foam within seconds. However, I did notice that achieving the frothiest results required holding the whisk at the surface level of the liquid for an optimal whip. It genuinely delivered on its promise of a café-grade experience at home without the need for larger, clunkier appliances.

**Cleaning and Maintenance for Busy People**  
Cleaning simple kitchen gadgets can sometimes feel like a chore, but thankfully, not in this case. Just placing the whisk under hot running water and switching it on briefly was sufficient to clear off all milk residues. My coworker, who borrowed it for her protein shakes, appreciated how easily it shifted scenes from frothing milk to mixing powders without clogging up. For storage, the metal stand doubles as a minimalist display piece on your counter, making it accessible when needed and organized when stored.

**Performance and Frothing Capability**  
The motor's strength surprised me for a compact handheld tool. From frothy lattes to well-mixed protein shakes, it competently fulfilled its multi-purpose claims. It even worked as a matcha whisk—something I tried after my friend insisted I had to test another use case. Unlike manual methods, this device produced fewer clumps, creating a smooth and enjoyable matcha tea. The versatility it offered amazed me, seamlessly handling various drinks and frothing requirements, though the motor admittedly became warm after longer sessions.

**Good Points**  
- Compact and lightweight for easy handling.  
- Included stand allows neat storage and immediate accessibility.  
- Capable of frothing a wide variety of liquids, offering versatility.  

**Limitations**  
- The battery compartment could be easier to open and close.  
- Continuous usage for longer than a few minutes slightly warms up the motor.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
Looking at other milk frothers in the market, I compared it to the PowerLix Handheld Milk Frother and Bonsenkitchen Electric Milk Frother. While PowerLix has an edge with its inclusion of rechargeable batteries, I found the included Duracell batteries in the Zulay model a great convenience as they offered 20+ frothing sessions out of the box. Bonsenkitchen’s frother, though inexpensive, didn’t feel as durable or as aesthetically appealing as the Zulay one. Where this frother stands out is in consistent whisk quality and reliability—it lives up to the reputation of creating café-quality froth while maintaining a stylish demeanor.

**Budget-Friendly Quality**  
Considering its feature set and the guaranteed quality from Zulay, the price felt justified. For someone like me who uses a milk frother almost daily, this is a practical mid-range option that offers robust performance without the hefty price tag of premium appliances. If durability matters to you, this frother’s stainless-steel build offers peace of mind. Despite not being the cheapest on the market, the consistent results feel worth every penny.

I experience dizziness, irregular periods - 9-12 days- super heavy all days, frequent urination, going to the bathroom at night even though I stopped drinking water hours before, and I am so tired that my body is in pain and I never feel like I've truly woken up during the day- I'm never refreshed from sleep. I have memory loss, concentration issues, difficulty processing people talking or understanding music lyrics, my speech has been more mumbled and gets worse as the years go on, it's hard to sit still or I'm in pain. In general, I feel 'sick/flu-like' everyday. I struggle with focus and literally just thinking of words. Simple tasks are becoming more and more difficult for me since I'm almost out of breath from just standing or even talking, and I've had shaky hands for years even though I'm not shy/nervous and don't drink more than a cup of coffee. At some point in a day I have some sort of pain shooting in my jaw/ear/neck/back. Sometimes, I feel shortness of breath, or like I can't take the deepest breath and feel refreshed.

Unfortunately the fireplace mantle is just cosmetic and the original adhesive is coming undone so we are looking into a facelift. The pictures on the slides are the floor plan, show pictures before we bought, and our current setup.

My husband and I are agreeing on ridding the original fireplace and getting an electric one, but we feel our current efforts are lackluster. He wants a very modern, contemporary feel to it and isn’t a fan of cottagecore/countrycore/basically living in a white barn feel. Think high rise in a big city like Atlanta.

I like Hygge/Japandi but we’ve made some hastier errors in younger years for furniture choices.

Things I’m replacing:
- Fireplace and Mantle
- TV

Things I am open to Replacing/Upgrading
- Table and Chairs by Window.
- Wall Color
- Curtains
- Small Knick knack shelves under Windows
- Lamp

Things I Cannot Replace
- Flooring
- Couch
- Coffee Table and Side Table

I found that using juice or other drinks like the fruit kombucha drinks have enough calories to be just fine & actually drank fewer calories than I usually eat. For coffee the cold coffee while it tasted vile also helped with caffeine & oral fixation needs. Just drink steadily so your blood sugar stays level. And don’t drink anything  the day of.

\- 60g of white flour

\- 40g of cocoa powder

\- 3 eggs

\- pinch of salt

today, I changed a few things. instead of using only 40% chocolate, i used a blend of 80g 85% chocolate and 40g of 40% chocolate. also, i didn't get my kitchen scale with me, so I used some density proportions to get the flour and cocoa powder right. (115ml of white flour and 90ml of cocoa powder). My brownies turned out almost completely cakey and with no flaky top!

the prep steps were the usual: melt the chocolate and coffee in the butter, beat the eggs with the sugar until it dissolves, mix in the chocolate butter, then the dry ingredients. I usually never sift those and it works out pretty well. preheated the oven at 180C for 10 minutes then baked the mix for 19 minutes.

can somebody, please, tell me what I've done wrong? I'm suspecting my density proportions didn't work quite right, but I'd still love some help.

My grandmother is turning 80 (she’s a very healthy 80, has all her faculties and such), it’s a big deal and my sister and mother decided to first throw her a party with some family where we lived, then we decided to move it up to where she lives at my cousin’s business because it’s more reachable for our family. It was going to be a party with 20-30 family members and we were going to have cake and coffee, just something nice and fun, which she agreed on and appreciated, at first. 

That was about a week ago. Since then, she’s TOLD US that she’s going to have, on our dime, a joint party with her friend, someone we’ve never met and her whole family and that the guest list would jump to 100 PEOPLE. We don’t know this woman, we don’t know her family, and even better, it’s looking like they’re not even going to contribute financially to the party. Not to mention, the venue we were going to use, my cousin’s business, has a massive back room that we were going to rent out. Well, my grandmother doesn’t want that because she thinks it’s “ugly” (it’s not), she wants to rent out the front room (which has limited seating and is set up like a restaurant) meaning that they’d have to close their business for a day. It’s a small winery business on a piece of land with a nice view out the front. It’s not expected for everyone to stay in the back the whole time and people can go to the front if they choose, even if we rent out the back. PLUS my cousin already said that the front isn’t an option for business reasons. 

We thought that that would be the brunt of it but no, as of today, they’re 100% having the joint party, they’re getting a bunch of catering, getting several cakes, photographers, still attempting to rent out the front section of the venue, and now wants to hire AIRPLANES TO SPELL OUT “HAPPY BIRTHDAY” OVER THE PARTY and if that can’t happen, GET A BLIMP WITH A “HAPPY BIRTHDAY” BANNER. My grandmother is a horrifically impulsive spender, but this is a new high. I guess it’s fine because she’s now paying for all of it (per her choice), but it just feels so blatantly disrespectful to our efforts. I mean, it went from something simple and not too pricey to literally thousands of dollars.

I genuinely do not understand how a family member can offer to throw you a birthday party, a nice little party with your close friends and family, and then turn it around on them and say, actually, this is what we’re doing. I get that it’s her party but there’s limits and she’s far surpassed all of them. I couldn’t IMAGINE having someone throw me a birthday party and then doing all of this.

It's the 6th tooth from the front in my top left quadrant. This went on for around a month, and I finally got around to seeing a dentist, even though the pain mostly subsided.

They took several x-rays and saw extensive decay, which they drilled out and removed. Once they had a look, they said that the decay was too deep below the gum line to save the tooth, with either a filling or root canal, and it has to come out.

Is this typical for decay that goes much below the gum line? Obviously no one can tell me what's going on with my tooth without x-rays and having a look at it, so I'm just asking generally if this is usually the case in such situations.

I don't smoke or drink, generally don't drink sugared sodas, only diet soda, although I do often drink various fruit juices that I usually dilute with water at a 1:2 juice:water ratio. I do drink coffee every morning, and fruit tea at night in winter. I also have the occasional ice cream or popsicle/ices. I also brush twice a day, manually in the morning and with an electric at night, and also floss at night, usually with a water flosser but several times a week with string, and then rinse with mouthwash.

I avoid candy and other foods that tend to stick to teeth, and between brushings and flossings use an interdental pick or floss pick to remove stuck food particles. I also often chew suger-free gum after meals, to loosen food particles. I don't suffer from dry mouth, have any medical conditions, or take any meds. I do take a few supplements daily, including CMZ tablets, to replace minerals I lose when I exercise.

I should also note that this was my first dental visit since before Covid, so it's been a while. No issues during this whole time, until now. The tooth adjacent to this one, in the direction towards the front, was extracted some years ago.",1,1755550318.0,askdentists,2,1.0,False

I think about you when I imagine the life I want to build, when I picture a home filled with laughter, when I dream about the kind of love that stays steady through everything. I know you are out there somewhere, living your story, going through your own lessons, preparing in ways you don’t even realize to meet me. And I want you to know that I am here, waiting, becoming the woman you deserve, and holding on to the hope that soon our paths will cross.

I cannot wait to do the small things for you. I cannot wait to wake up and make you coffee in the morning, to kiss you before you leave for work, to put little notes in your lunch just to remind you how deeply you are loved. I cannot wait to sit beside you at the end of a long day and listen to how it went, to rub your back when you are stressed, to fold your laundry with love even when you leave socks everywhere. I cannot wait to be the one who turns ordinary routines into acts of devotion, who makes even the simplest days feel special because we get to share them.

I want to be the wife you deserve, the one who makes our house feel like a home, the one who welcomes you back with warmth no matter how hard the day has been, the one who believes in your dreams as if they were my own. I want to cook dinner with you, laugh with you while we wash dishes, dance with you in the kitchen just because the song playing feels too good not to move to. I want to pray with you, to build our faith together, to hold your hand not just when things are easy but especially when they are not.

I can already see our children in my heart, even though they are not here yet. I imagine the way you will hold our baby for the first time, the way you will look at them like they are the most precious thing in the world. I imagine the pride in your eyes when you teach them how to ride a bike, when you show them how to be strong and kind, when you cheer for them louder than anyone else. I imagine us tucking them into bed, reading them stories, kissing them goodnight, and then collapsing into each other knowing that no matter how tired we are, we are building something beautiful together. I imagine family dinners, family trips, and quiet moments of us watching our kids grow, seeing ourselves reflected in them and feeling thankful for every bit of chaos and joy they bring into our lives.

But my love, I do not just want the perfect moments with you. I want it all. I want the messy, difficult days just as much as the easy ones. I want to argue and then figure it out because our love will always be bigger than our disagreements. I want to face financial struggles, hard decisions, unexpected changes, and even heartbreaks together, knowing that we will get through anything as long as we have each other. I want to grow with you, to change with you, and to keep learning how to love you better every day.

I dream about our adventures and our quiet days. I dream about road trips with music blasting, about lazy Sundays in bed, about late-night conversations where we share everything we are too afraid to tell anyone else. I dream about sitting on a porch with you when we are old and gray, still holding your hand, still laughing at the same silly things, still feeling like the luckiest person alive because I get to call you mine.

I know neither of us will be perfect, but I promise I will love you in the ordinary moments just as much as in the extraordinary ones. I promise to always choose you, to always respect you, to always be your safe place. I promise to believe in you when you doubt yourself, to lift you up when you are tired, and to stand in your corner no matter what life throws at us. I promise to bring patience, faith, and forgiveness into our marriage, to never let pride come before us, and to keep our love alive in ways big and small.

Until we finally find each other, I will keep preparing. I will keep becoming the best version of myself, because I want to be ready for you, ready to give you a love that feels like home. I will keep trusting that the universe or God or fate will bring us together at the perfect time. And when that moment comes, when I finally see you and know it is you, I will thank every heartbreak, every delay, and every lonely night that led me to you.

I do not know your name yet, but I already know my heart belongs to you. I already know that I will love you endlessly, fiercely, and faithfully for the rest of my life. And I cannot wait for the day when I finally get to say, this is my husband.

With all my love,",2,1755550167.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,2,0.75,False

I am very much in the headspace of waiting for my expiration date, I do not wish to be here and there is genuinely nothing keeping me here so I am honestly just trying to survive for as long as I can. My only family that I consider family now is my sister who I love and appreciate so much and our relationship is just not the same as me and my brothers was. My sister and I have a 10 year age gap whereas my brother and I were 2 years apart. I feel completely isolated in my family. I also have been living 5 hours away from them since 2021 so our grief has been almost completely separate, not sure if thats a good or bad thing. For me it was necessary because I had work here and bills to pay, we all know life doesn’t stop for grief; but also due to a bad relationship with my parents and rightfully placing a lot of blame on them. I have been going to a support group since November and it has been very helpful for the most part, I am trying to get into individual therapy currently. The group is awesome and I have met great people there multiple people my age (F25) but no matter how hard I try none of these friendships translate outside of the group I have asked many of them to get coffee or go thrifting even just play video games online etc because while I have been in this city for 4+ years I don’t really have any solid friendships. I understand it’s very hard to make friends as an adult but I don’t really understand why, especially if we already can relate to something so huge, are they worried it will be only about that ? I have been communicative that I genuinely just want friendship we don’t even have to talk about our grief if they don’t want to. I just need to be out of isolation so bad. I feel like they all already have their people thats why. 
The one year anniversary is so close and it feels completely surreal still I wake up every day and see the number of days go up and I just cannot understand how this is real. It makes things extra hard when I am practically begging people to hang out with me, begging for my “village” or whatever and no one seems to want that and I am unsure if it’s because of me or something I am doing. In my group everyone talks about their villages and how people have just gone out of their way to make this easier on them and I have had none of that besides from my own sister who is dealing with the grief in tenfold, being the one who found him. It’s not fair and I know things aren’t fair but I genuinely just hurt so much and I sit here asking myself whats wrong with me and why people don’t want to be there for me / be my friend. I am not really sure what to do. I feel like I do the right things by reaching out and taking initiative but I just keep getting rejected. ",3,1755550103.0,SuicideBereavement,2,0.81,False

We talked about sex and i sent him a nude photo - expiring on WhatsApp — which he said was beautiful. I sent him another one in the morning and he made a joke that i was hard at work. I mentioned that I want to see him one phonecalls more because I want to gawp at him.

I already have my own beans (and a Krups $60 grinder). I’m happy to use pods (for something like a nespresso) as long as I can use refillable pods that would allow me to use my beans (I’ve heard sometimes this isn’t possible with nespressos so would love any input). My budget for a machine is $400, and maybe a little extra if I need to buy an additional milk frother. 

Currently I use a Keurig with reusable pods, my own beans, and just set it to 4oz Strong to get a decently strong drip coffee (and then repeat this multiple times). I’m looking for something that can at the least match that, but preferably makes something stronger. I drink about 8 to 20oz of that a day and there’s a lot of waste. 

It doesn’t have to make true espresso as long as it makes dark coffee and doesn’t have an insane learning curve. I understand I can’t commit entirely to the espresso hobby, but was curious if anyone had any recommendations for something beginner or just passing!

I would also love if it’s quiet, easy to clean (relatively), and takes less than 10 mins, but those aren’t deal breakers. Any help would be appreciated!",2,1755549970.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I just got the game this weekend and immediately got hooked. I used to play waaayyyy when I was a kid back in like, 2005-2010. Anniversary edition is so awesome!

  
Anyways, here is Mocha. She's big, fuzzy, and mean. She'll be running her pack (the Burnt Espresso Pack, because it's bitter like her) like the NAVY out in Slough Creek. She's leaning more towards cautious, loner, and energetic. The left side of her face is permanently damaged from a trip gone awry from when she was a pup learning how to hunt; a bull elk kicked her right in the face, taking out her eye, crippling her ear, and causing her to lose a few teeth and develop a snaggletooth in the process.  Despite elk being her main source of food, she has a bit of a vendetta towards them and any male ungulates, and while she does maintain her distance she does enjoy scaring them (and maybe once her pack has enough numbers- actually taking them down, which is now a bucket list item for her). She quite large for a female wolf, rivaling some of the males wolves in size, and has a muscular, bulky frame, as well as a fluffy tail. She remains quite fluffy during most of the year, much to her annoyance during summer, and can often be seen cooling off in streams or ponds. Her pelt is the Luna Pelt from the Wolf Ambassador pack- I was slightly inspired by the bio and wanted to create my own headstrong, attitudinous wolf. After seeing her icon scowling at me through the screen I knew I had to get her on paper. Unfortunately my iPad pen is dead and, as mentioned before, I'm bored at work so...

  
I'd like to keep tabs on her family tree when I have the time! So far she's only met a prospective mate, a white wolf named Vanilla Bean. All of the babies will be coffee names, of course.

I (31F) make significantly more money than my husband (33M). When we first got together, it didn’t seem like a big deal. But over the last year, I’ve noticed the resentment growing.

He makes comments like “must be nice” whenever I buy something for myself, even if it’s just a coffee. He jokes about being my “trophy husband” in front of friends, but there’s bitterness behind it. When I suggested we take a vacation, he said “why don’t you just go without me, since you can afford it.”

It breaks me because I don’t care about the money, I just want us to feel like a team. I feel like he sees me as competition instead of his partner.

We often picture them as thick, bound volumes filled with meticulously handwritten notes, sketches, and calculations – often with ink splatters and the occasional coffee⁣ stain providing evidence ‍of late nights! That analog system, while offering a certain charm, had inherent limitations: searchability was a nightmare, collaboration meant physical proximity, and data ‌integrity ⁤was vulnerable to​ accidents​ or even deliberate alteration.

The shift to digital lab⁤ notebooks (ELNs) has been a slow but definite evolution. Early iterations were often clunky software mimicking the paper format, but now we see increasingly elegant platforms⁢ that integrate directly with lab equipment, automatically capture data,‍ and offer powerful search and analysis tools. Think about the difference between rifling through hundreds of pages trying to find a specific observation ‌versus typing a keyword and instantly ​retrieving all related entries.

While the benefits of ELNs in terms of efficiency and data management are undeniable, I‍ wonder‍ if anything is​ lost in ‍the transition. Does the physical act of writing by hand influence the way we process information and develop hypotheses? Are younger‌ scientists missing out on a ‍crucial element of scientific training ⁢by skipping the handwritten notebook altogether?

for our honeymoon we plan to go on a three week trip through Yunnan. We spent a week there 6 years ago shortly after becoming a couple and we loved the northeastern region around Dali and Lijiang. Therefore, we love to go back to have some relaxed days, but also to explore new cities and areas in southern Yunnan. However, while we roughly know where we want to go, we look for recommendations for hotels/hostels/home stays to stay at, great restaurants as well as amazing guided experiences.as we all know, China changes quickly and a probably any place. We both speak Chinese so getting around, even to more remote areas is not an obstacle. 

What do you think about the itinerary below?
Any places you would rather go to? Any hotel, restaurant, guided tour you can recommend specifically? 

Day 1 - Travel from Kunming to Lijiang and visit Lijiang old town

Day 2 - Take the bus to the Tiger Leaping Gorge - hike until halfway hotel to spend the night

Day 3 - hike second half of the Gorge and return to Lijiang in the evening

Day 4-5 - traditional minority fotoshoot, hike the Yulongshan and visit the Lijiang show

Day 6-9 - Travel to Shangri-la to experience Tibetan culture in Deqin, taste Shangri-la wine and go horse riding

Day 10-13 - travel to Xizhou (look for a place with lakeview) for some relaxing days around the Erhai lake, hiking the Cangshan, visit Dali old town and go for a TCM mushroom picking experience.

Night 13-14 - take the night train to Kunming and then the Gaotie to Xishuangbanna

Day 14-16 - Arrive in Xishuangbanna, go elephant watching, do some cooking classes, go to Gaozhuang night market 

Day 17-18 - Travel to Wengji village in Jingmai mountain area and explore the local tea and (coffee) culture 

Day 19 - travel to Jianshui fir the second largest Confucius temple in China and the local night market to spend the night there.

Day 20-21 - travel to Yuanyang rice terrace for amazing pictures ( we will be there in the second week of October which should be the harvest season. Is it worth going there during that time?)

Day 22 - travel to Kunming with a stop over at the Shilin stone forest and spend the night in Kunming old town.

Day 23 - do some shopping before flying back home.

Any place you would skip at that time of the year, especially with regards to Yuanyang? Any resources we might have overseen? Feel free to roast it as well.

It was difficult but not as difficult as I imagined. I have been in IT, mostly networking for the past 15 years and was able to take a year off from work and apply most of that time to studying for this test. 

1. It's a fight. It's no different than being in a street fight, same anxiety and fight or flight decisions. Mentally prepare yourself for a fight and to win. I came out swinging and before I knew it I was 18 questions into the test with barely anytime expired. I jabbed and jabbed and began smiling and then the algorithm punched me in the mouth, and just like that, I knew I was in a fight and  we traded blows back and forth until question 150. 

2. Everyday before I began my study sessions, I'd start off with a game of arcade Pacman or Galaga. I Used it kind of like a mental shot of coffee to get my cognitive decision-making juices moving, once my blood got pumping I was able to take that same intensity into my studies. 

3. After about a week of studying take a few days off and party. Party hard. It's a mental reset. The goals you are trying to overcome are extremely difficult, you deserve to have some fun. After your reset, be discipline enough to hunker down and get ready for then next round. No messing around during study week. 

4. Pray. Throughout my journey up until the last question, God was with me. The morning before the exam I prayed to God that I have the strength to keep pushing forward during the exam but also that if I should fail the exam, to give me the courage to get back up and move forward without being mentally defeated. I could not have passed the test without my faith and I felt his presence with me that day. 

5. The morning before the test I watched the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan on full volume. Although I was watching a different battle in a different time and place, I became one of those men approaching the beach and the cissp algorithm was one of the machine gunners waiting for me and when the battle ended.

Between packing lunches, running after my toddler who refuses to wear pants (seriously, why??), and trying to answer work emails before my coffee kicks in, breakfast is usually whatever’s easiest... which isn't always healthy. But a few days ago, I stumbled on this healthy bagel recipe using Greek yogurt, and I’m kind of blown away by how easy it actually was.



Basically, it’s Greek yogurt and self-rising flour – that’s it! You don’t even need yeast or anything fancy. I was skeptical at first because anytime someone says ""easy bagel recipe,"" it’s still usually a high-effort disaster. But these are just mix, roll, bake – no mess, no waiting for dough to rise. My kids thought they tasted “like real bagels” (high praise from a picky five-year-old), and my husband asked if I bought them from a bakery, so yeah, win-win.



They’re not as chewy as a traditional bagel, but I don’t think anyone in my house missed it. Oh, and I learned you can sprinkle literally anything on top—sesame seeds, cinnamon sugar, even Everything Bagel seasoning—and they all came out amazing. Next time, I’m thinking about folding some diced jalapeños into the dough because, why not?

They're also taking excellent revenge for this because my name on the cup was spelled Phoelixx lmao. There wasn't anyone else in the coffee shop so I talked to them about it briefly and their younger sister is named Jeweliette. They have a great sense of humor about it but I feel quite bad for them ,9,1755549244.0,tragedeigh,9,1.0,False
1mtxocs,https://i.redd.it/mevwroq59ujf1.jpeg,How to keep it tidy (fiorenzato allground),"Since a few weeks I have the fiorenzato allground and I love the grinds it produces (especially compared to the sage barista express build in grinder) but I kind of miss the well thought out dosing ring that clicked on my old grinder

How do I keep the grounds in the piston? Or find another way to not spill half of my grounds? 
Its hard to do time based shots this way and also I have to clean after every shot

Is there a dosing ring that fits on this machine? The profitec or Eureka ones don't fit at all...

I want to stop spilling so much coffee! Please help me",7,1755549220.0,espresso,3,0.89,False

What is going on?
They both used tripods, but the guy today is using a camera and not just an iphone like the one on scenic did.
Im not sure if this is something that ""The House"" is setting up or not, but some information about why someone is monitoring the intersection would be nice.

1mtxmx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/1mtxmx9/question_cleaning_silver_service_caked_on_old/,Question cleaning Silver Service… caked on old polish in crevices & grooves.,"Hi, I’m polishing up Grandmother’s coffee service & some other pieces using Goddard’s polish. Silver plate over copper. Have a couple of questions. 

There are a few pieces with caked on old polish under rims and in crevices. 

Is it safe to soap & hot water soak off the dried 35 year old polish? I am thoroughly polishing first. 

The insides of the vessels are a matte finish, some pieces need polishing, is it safe to use the polish inside as well and/or is the plate typically too thin to polish regularly? 

Thank you

- Many new headphones have weird dips often between 1-5khz which cause vocals to sound like they come from takeaway coffee cups. I want rich and open mids

- I listen to bass heavy music so good and punchy and accurate bass is a must. So most likely closed back headphones.

- No v-curve sound

- Warm sound. I like tracks with 2000s dreamy mastering and most new headphones fail to produce that kind of sound. *Linkin Park - Breaking The Habit* is a good example of what I mean

I've liked Sennheiser Momentum 2 in a past but the new 4th version of those sounds plain wrong. Other ones that have weird dips in mids are B&W px7 s3 and Sony WH000-XM6. I also kind of liked the sound of Beats Solo3's but the audio quality in general was pretty bad. I live in a quite small town with no big audio stores so I'm not able to test other headphones without first buying them.

Headphones don't necessarily have to be noise cancelling. Bluetooth is a plus or at least changeable wires since I tend to break those quite easily.

1mtxkc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIpoweredInfluencer/comments/1mtxkc6/this_cant_be_real_beta_tester_jobs_pay_actual/,This Can’t Be Real: Beta Tester Jobs Pay *Actual Cash* to Total Newbies—And All You Need Is Your Phone?!,"Wait. Hold up. 

Beta Tester Jobs… PAY CASH… and you don’t need *any* experience? Am I missing something or is the world slipping into an alternate universe where getting paid to play with apps is actually a legit thing?

I always thought you needed some tech creds or to be super nerdy to get in on beta testing. But apparently, it's a whole thing and straight up regular folks are doing it every day. Like, are you SERIOUS? I finally found a legit rabbit hole, and it’s not sketchy like those surveys that pay in virtual hugs.  

Here's what absolutely melted my brain:

- Tons of apps—games, productivity, tools, random weird stuff—REQUIRE actual humans (read: us) to test them before launch. We’re talking bug checking, feedback, just clicking around. That means not only geeks, but anyone with a phone can—honestly—get in.
- Some platforms pay out daily. Like, you can dead serious see cash coming…not “payment points” or “mystery rewards.”
- No college degree. No resume. If you have ever used a smartphone, you are basically an expert compared to what they're looking for.
- **Apps actually GIVE you instructions.** You don’t have to know what you’re doing; they want normal person brains.

And then…like a literal gift from the algorithm gods, I tripped over **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** on a late-night doomscroll. No crazy interviews, no hoops, just register and boom—you’re inside a zone filled with beta test offers.

If you’re as shocked as me, let’s break down how to actually get into this crazy world, step-by-step:

- Go to **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** and register (it takes less time than ordering coffee).
- Fill out your device info. Seriously, that’s what they REALLY want, because apps like to know if they’re running on #TeamApple or #AndroidArmy.
- Start choosing projects. Each project spells out what you need to do—sometimes it’s just playing a level, sometimes clicking a few buttons, sometimes writing what you liked/hated.
- Submit your feedback and wait to see CASH added to your account. Yes, I said it. CASH. (Did anyone else’s heart skip?)
- You can literally rinse and repeat on **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** any time you want, because these offers update. Stay glued!

Still in total disbelief? SAME.

But the best part: you’re influencing actual app development. Your sleeper rage at glitchy games honestly becomes your income. 

Things you don’t need:
- Zero coding. (Blank stare at my failed Python files.)
- No NDA forms that require more clicks than Pokémon GO.
- Not a full-time energy drainer—do it before class, after work, on the bus… all real options.

**[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** (bookmark this for the stress scroll, trust) is the best hack I’ve touched so far for that “Just buy me coffee money” without literally moving.

Is this the side hustle we’ve ALL been missing? Would you ever admit to becoming a full-time beta tester if money started rolling in… or is that new “dream job” status for us introverts? 

Let’s get paid for our opinions for once.  
Anyone actually tried this? Drop wisdom or questions below. 

And for real, one more time in case your thumbs forgot how to copy: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** — if you start testing, come back and brag with your earnings!",1,1755548977.0,AIpoweredInfluencer,0,1.0,False

1mtxfw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/doihavebreastcancer/comments/1mtxfw2/nobody_told_me_this/,Nobody Told Me This,"Hey there,

So, I recently had a finding of asymmetry, approx.  2.32 cm on outer left breast/birads 0, on my annual mammo. I'm a few weeks from 43, and I've had a couple of mammos so far, given my extremely dense, very ""busy"" breast tissue (radiologist's words). This was my first call-back and I was an absolute wreck. Happened on a Friday. I was lucky enough to get in for a diagnostic 3 days after the annual and it was fine, they only needed the spot compression, no US. But I was told two things that could have contributed to my asymmetry finding:

1. My previous mammo that was being used for comparison was done 2 weeks after my period, in the follicular phase when breast tissue is less dense. This most recent one was done the day before menstruation, when progesterone is highest, and breast tissue is more dense/higher fluid retention. Shouldn't make that much of a difference for most people,  but they told me since i have very dense breasts to begin with, it could cause this finding. 

2. Previous mammo was done during a period of time I was off coffee (for about a year). I have since returned to my coffee addiction and had a very large, extra strong cup of coffee before this most recent mammo. I was told that also may have contributed to the finding.

All that to say, in the future, I will be making appointments 2 weeks after menstruation, not drinking any coffee before the appointment, oh, and NEVER scheduling the mammo for a Friday. Ever. Again. I hope this helps someone. ",1,1755548704.0,doihavebreastcancer,1,1.0,False

- What's your preference? Saturday afternoon coffee? Sunday brunch? 
- Would a Meetup group sound good? For recurring events, it would be easier to announce and organize groups over there. 
- Please suggest your locations. It'll be good to discuss now so that others can get inspired by your ideas and we can gauge what parts of the city would be ideal for this group. 

I hope this idea gains traction! Thanks, u/My-5Minutes-Here for getting the conversation started.

First time poster here, but I've done some lurking recently. I've been in facilities management for over 5 years now and I'm currently working on my FMP certification through IFMA. I've seen it all-from hands-on maintenance and space planning to emergency response-and I've always thrived on keeping things running smoothly behind the scenes. But lately, I don't know, the field seems to be shifting into weird territory.

One thing I am finding incredibly annoying- why is everything labeled ""facilities"" now basically event planning with a twist? Roles advertised as facilities work that involve planning themed experiences, setting up snack walls for swag events, or coordinating office happy hours. Like... is this normal? Is this really where FM is heading?

And here's the kicker, they want to spend 10-20k a month on these events without blinking, but when I request a repair or replacement for broken office appliances, I get an immediate ""no"". Coffee machine down for weeks? ""Not in the budget."" But a themed lunch for the execs? Approved immediately.

I didn't get into this profession to be a glorified planner for corporate vibes. I know workplace experience is important, but we're losing sight of core functions: asset management, infrastructure upkeep, preventive maintenance, vendor oversight, building ops, etc. 

Leadership often doesn't even understand what we do, which only amplifies the frustration. Everyone wants innovation, smart buildings, efficiency. but nobody wants to invest in real FM strategy or staff who understand it.

Is anyone else seeing this? Is it just particular industries or companies? I'm genuinely trying to figure out if this is a temporary trend or if we're watching the entire profession morph into something unrecognizable.

Would love to hear how others are navigating this.
