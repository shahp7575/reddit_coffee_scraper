1jx8vza,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jx8vza,"First Desk Setup, need Advice!","Hey guys! I am a setting up my own work desk/gaming setup for the first time, and I feel like I've already made some great progress. My big problem? I got no style!

I'd like some advice on what I can do to help improve my setup, whether it's based on personal opinion, community standards, or anything you think can help improve what I have already to make it more aesthetically pleasing. (Besides cable management, I know I got work to do, haha.)

Just to talk you through what I have so far: I built my own desk by purchasing a Vivio standing desk frame and purchased a 72"" long Cherry wood butcher's block table and assembled it myself. I have two 27 inch Dell 165 hz monitors, and a Dual Monitor stand. I went ahead and mounted my computer: it's a RTX 4080 Super in a Corsair 4000d airflow 4000d computer case with plenty of other good features. (I went pretty far to have a great computer, but the desk setup is what I'm really lacking!). I also have a microphone stand arm, which I'm considering moving between my main monitor and laptop. And beneath my main monitor is a simple, cheap Amazon monitor stand I purchased as a possible center piece and to help with space with its drawers [https://a.co/d/33hnYgQ], although I admit it's become a bit of an eyesore. Since I have a tiled bedroom which also works as my office and game room, I had a cheaper black carpet mat I'm using, but will probably get rid of.

Speaking of: I have a work laptop with a docking station and a switch, so I can instantly switch from work mode to gaming mode, (excuse the terrible cable management, I just finished building the desk), so I'm trying to find a good way to handle the excess wires and items needed to keep things tidy. (Any advice on how to make my setup on that end simpler, would greatly appreciate!)

All in all, I have some extra paraphernalia currently for my desk, including a cup holder, a hot plate for my coffee in the morning, (long work calls means I forget to finish my coffee while it's hot.) and of course a pretty simple matt for my Lemonkey keyboard and M2 Keychron mouse. 

My plans? I'm hoping to put some sound proofing of some kind for better voice calls and recording, I skipped out on RGB for my computer, so I'm thinking of adding some to my wall, and I'm potentially going to go for the Govee HDMI 2.1 Sync Box for a fun background light. I'm also hoping to place some decent speakers on my desk itself.

What would you guys suggest for ways to improve the walls aesthetically around the desk? I feel like even though I have a great desk, I'm already fighting for space with my work docking station and current monitor stand. Any advice or pointers I'd greatly appreciate!

I work for a shower company that has a set up at the mall. The set up is constructed of 3 small sized shower examples one large on back and 2 small on front. The sides of the box are part signage part curtain.

The job is to answer questions and set appointments for shower installs. We are given scratch off flyers to get people to stop to talk about a shower.

The coworker, Kurt, we’ll call him made me feel uneasy and uncomfortable when I worked with him. An odd vibe. 27 year old single guy with an odd look.

We pass out these scratches and ask people 1 maybe 2 times tops. Kurt asks them every single time they walk by the table sometimes 6 plus times to the same nice people trying to shop. Paid hourly but a small small commission if these sell.

I start my first day with Kurt and he tells me he doesn’t take breaks (10–6p) shift. We are paid for 2 15s and 1 30. Odd. But whatever, try hard. Weird annoying but nothing that bad…

Fast forward to today. I didn’t know I’d be working with him till he showed up. I clock in at 9:55 set everything up and at 10:15 he shows up. Late. No big deal. But let it be noted. I take a coffee break come back to him being super pushy and weird but nothing odd yet. 12pm a 3rd employee shows up to work her shift is 12–8p. We work a bit. 2 pm Kurt goes to the inside portion of the display and I talk to a customer for maybe 3 min. Guy leaves. I open curtain to grab my coffee and I startle him. I don’t notice much but 2 min later he comes out and says he spilled water on him self and it looks like I peed myself what should I do. The other worker and I tell him hi dry off or buy new pants. We are all a mall.

Co worker bought it, but I know the face of shame and Kurt had it. I opened the curtain and see DISPOSABLE URINE BAGS out in the open and a puddle of what I assume is piss. I take a picture and tell the lady co worker. She flips out and so do I. Absolutely disgusting behavior in my opinion. It’s a curtain in a mall. Kids open it etc. I leave for the day and told supervisor, they are probably going to let him go but I do not know…

QUESTION. Why would this able bodied man have a bag of disposable urine bags in a small closed space? Is there a…

So we guys were thinking of opening a multi brewery and were thinking of trying a place where coffee beans are offered from different countries and not just different brands.
It will be great if anyone could help me with the below :

1) Is this idea cost effective ?
2) From where can I source the coffee beans for different countries, if anyone could help me with that .

Also, weirdly? My jaw feels different. Like my overbite backed off a little. I’m not saying I walked out with a new face, but something shifted. There’s less yellow under my eyes and for the first time in ages, coffee didn’t wreck my stomach. Not medically significant maybe, but spiritually? Huge.

Still no idea how much of this is post op meds vs actual decompression magic, but I woke up feeling more refreshed than I have in forever. Which, again, could just be the hospital grade sedatives, but hey, I’ll take it.

Small update from the surgeon:
Apparently, the fascia tissue around my left IJV was insanely thick, you could say it’s like cling wrap layered 200 times.

I’m still planning for a second surgery on the right side in 6 months, but right now I’m just letting myself believe the next 12–18 months might actually be different.

If you’re still in the thick of it MECFS, long COVID, compression, whatever this broken body limbo is just know there is a way forward (maybe just maybe there’s something out there, I understand everyone is different and unique).

## Deep Dive into the Features: What Makes the Tisdale Stand Out?

Let's break down the key features that make the Thomasville Tisdale modular sectional stand out from the competition:

*   **Modular Design:** The modular components allow for a variety of configurations, adapting to different room sizes and shapes. You can arrange it as a conventional sectional, a long sofa with an ottoman, or even separate the pieces for more intimate seating arrangements. This adaptability is a huge advantage over traditional, fixed-configuration sofas.
*   **Storage Ottoman:** One of the most appealing features is the inclusion of a storage ottoman. This provides a convenient and discreet space to store blankets, pillows, remotes, or other living room essentials, helping to keep your space organized and clutter-free.*   **Dark Gray Upholstery:** The dark gray fabric offers a neutral and versatile backdrop that blends seamlessly with a wide range of color palettes and décor styles. It's a practical choice for families with children or pets, as it tends to hide stains and wear better than lighter colors.
*   **Pleasant Seating:** Thomasville is known for comfort, and the Tisdale sectional aims to deliver. While the exact materials may vary, the seat cushions often feature a pocket coil construction designed to provide support and prevent sagging. The promise of a comfortable sectional sofa is a major draw for potential buyers.
*   **Size and Dimensions:** The sectional is a large sectional sofa with ottoman and remarkable dimensions, typically around 71.26 inches by 142.52 inches. This generous size makes it ideal for families or those who frequently entertain guests.
*   **Construction and Materials:** The frame is usually constructed from wood, known for its durability and stability. High-density foam and sinuous springs provide the necessary support allowing the sectional furniture dark gray to withstand daily usage.
*  **Tufted Cushions:** Adding to both comfort and style are the thoughtfully designed tufted seat cushions. These help maintain the cushion's shape and contribute to an inviting look.

## Assessing the Comfort Factor: Is This Sectional Made for Relaxation?

The comfort of a sectional sofa is paramount, and the Thomasville Tisdale aims to deliver. Many users praise the initial comfort and supportive seating of the Thomasville Tisdale sectional. However, long-term comfort can be subjective and depend on individual preferences. It’s significant to consider the following:

*   **Cushion Firmness:** Generally, the cushions lean towards a medium-firm feel, providing a good balance of support and comfort. This firmness is designed to prevent excessive sinking and maintain its shape over time.
*   **Seat depth:** Offers a generous seating depth, making it easy to lounge and relax. This is particularly appealing for those who enjoy curling up with a book or watching movies.*   **Fabric Texture:** The fabric texture plays a significant role in overall comfort. Depending on the fabric type used, the surface should feel soft and pleasant against the skin, enhancing the relaxation experience.
*   **Back Support:** Proper back support is essential for long-term comfort. The sectional typically features fixed back cushions or cushions attached by zippers, designed to provide adequate lumbar support.
* **Pocket Coil Springs**: Provides support during long periods of sitting.

## The Storage Ottoman: A Game-Changer for Institution?

The storage ottoman is frequently lauded as a defining feature of the Thomasville Tisdale. Here's why:

*   **Ample Storage Space:** The ottoman offers a surprisingly spacious storage compartment, perfect for stowing away blankets, pillows, toys, or other living room essentials.
*   **Easy Access:** The hinged lid makes it easy to access the stored items without having to move the entire ottoman.
*   **Multifunctional Use:** The ottoman can serve as a footrest, an extra seat, or even a coffee table with the addition of a tray.
*   **Seamless Integration:** the ottoman is designed to blend seamlessly with the rest of the sectional, maintaining a cohesive and stylish look.

While the storage ottoman offers numerous benefits, it's essential to consider the following:

*   **Size and Placement:** Ensure the ottoman fits comfortably within your living room layout and doesn't obstruct traffic flow.

## Durability and Longevity: Will this Sectional Stand the Test of Time?

Durability is a crucial factor to consider when investing in a new sectional sofa. While the Thomasville brand generally has a good reputation, it's essential to examine the specific materials and construction of the Tisdale sectional.

*   **Frame Construction:** The wooden frame should be sturdy and well-constructed to withstand everyday use. Look for reinforced joints and solid wood materials for added durability.
*   **Fabric Quality:** The fabric should be resistant to wear, tear, and fading. Look for tightly woven fabrics that are designed to withstand heavy use.
*   **Cushion Construction:** As reported on some websites, some people have described how the cushions may flatten over time. The pocket coil system assists significantly.

when evaluating durability, consider these real-world factors:

*   **Usage Frequency:** How often will the sectional be used? Heavy daily use will put more strain on the materials.
*   **Pet and child Considerations:** If you have pets or children, you'll want to choose a fabric that is resistant to stains and scratches.
*   **Maintenance:** Regular cleaning and maintenance will help prolong the life of your sectional.

Carefully measure your space before purchasing.*   **Weight:** The sectional is quite heavy, making it challenging to move or rearrange on your own.*  **Long Term Cushion Softness:** Several customers discuss the seat cushions becoming too soft after a few months of usage.

Strategies for Reviving Physical Intimacy in a Sexless Marriage
---------------------------------------------------------------

Reviving physical intimacy in a sexless marriage can feel overwhelming, but it's important to approach this challenge with both understanding and strategy. Your relationship deserves the nurturing it needs to flourish. Here are several effective strategies to help rekindle that vital connection.

### Open Communication

One of the most crucial steps in reviving intimacy is to foster open and honest communication with your partner. Share your feelings about the lack of intimacy and listen to their perspective. Remember, it's essential to create a safe space where both partners can express their concerns without judgment. Here’s how you can approach it:

- Choose a calm moment to discuss intimacy.
- Use “I” statements to express how you feel without placing blame.
- Encourage your partner to share their feelings and thoughts.

### Reconnect Emotionally

Emotional intimacy often lays the groundwork for physical intimacy. To reconnect on an emotional level, try these tactics:

- Plan regular date nights to enjoy each other's company without distractions.
- Engage in deep conversations about dreams, fears, and aspirations.
- Revisit fond memories from your early days together to rekindle feelings of affection.

### Prioritize Quality Time

Life can get busy, and it’s easy to lose sight of each other amid daily responsibilities. Make a conscious effort to prioritize quality time by:

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
- Setting aside time each week for activities you both enjoy.
- Creating rituals, like morning coffee together or evening walks.
- Limiting distractions like phones and TV during your time together.

### Try New Activities Together

Introducing novelty into your relationship can spark excitement and intimacy. Here are some ideas:

- Take a dance class together to boost physical closeness.
- Explore new hobbies, such as cooking or painting, to bond over shared experiences.
- Travel to new places, even if it's just a weekend getaway to explore a nearby town.

### Physical Affection

Intimacy doesn’t have to start with sex. Start with small gestures of affection to rebuild your physical connection:

- Hold hands while watching a movie or going for a walk.
- Engage in cuddling or gentle touches to create a sense of closeness.
- Surprise your partner with a spontaneous back rub or a hug during the day.

### Talk About Your Physical Needs

Discussing your physical needs may feel awkward but it is a critical step. Share what you desire, and ask your partner how they feel. Be specific about the changes you would like to see in your physical relationship. This can include:

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
- What feels pleasurable for you both.
- Positions or approaches you'd like to try.
- Scheduling intimate time together so both partners can prepare and relax.

### Seek Professional Help

If efforts to revive intimacy seem overwhelming or unproductive, seeking the assistance of a professional therapist can be a beneficial step. They can provide insight and guidance tailored to your situation. Therapy can help:

- Identify root causes of intimacy issues.
- Teach effective communication skills.
- Provide strategies to overcome obstacles to intimacy.

Reviving physical intimacy in a sexless marriage takes time, patience, and effort from both partners. By embracing open communication, reconnecting emotionally, and actively prioritizing your relationship, you’ll pave the way for a more fulfilling intimate life together. Remember, the goal is to foster a deeper connection that aligns with both of your desires and needs.

The Importance of Communication in Rebuilding a Healthy Relationship
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Effective communication is the bedrock of any healthy relationship. Whether you are married, in a long-term partnership, or just starting a new relationship, open dialogue creates a stronger bond between partners. When faced with struggles, the ability to discuss feelings, fears, and desires becomes crucial. Here’s how communication plays an essential role in rebuilding a healthy relationship.

To begin, it's important to recognize that everyone has different communication styles. Some may be more expressive, while others may be reserved and prefer to think things through before sharing. Embracing these differences can help couples cater their conversations to meet each other's emotional needs. This shows understanding and respect for one another.

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
### Understanding and Active Listening

An integral part of communication is active listening. It requires you to fully engage with what your partner is saying. Here are some key aspects to consider:

- **Maintain eye contact:** This shows your partner that you are paying attention.
- **Avoid interrupting:** Let your partner express themselves without jumping in.
- **Validate feelings:** Acknowledge how your partner feels even if you don’t entirely understand.

Listening actively can allow both partners to feel valued, which is essential for healing any rifts in the relationship. It lays a foundation of trust, encouraging more open and honest exchanges.

### Expressing Needs and Desires

Once you have a grasp on listening, it is vital to articulate your own feelings and needs. Too often, couples fail to communicate their desires, leading to frustration and resentment. Consider these tips for expressing yourself effectively:

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
- **Use ""I"" statements:** Instead of saying ""You always…"" try ""I feel…"" This reduces defensiveness.
- **Be specific:** Vague requests can cause misunderstanding. Be clear about what you need.
- **Choose the right time:** Address issues when both you and your partner are calm and undistracted.

By communicating your needs clearly, you allow your partner to understand your perspective. This opens up a pathway for compromise and solutions that satisfy both individuals.

### Addressing Conflicts and Finding Solutions

No relationship is free from conflict. What matters is how you handle disagreements. Effective communication can turn potential arguments into productive discussions. Here’s how:

- **Stay calm:** Emotions can run high, but keeping a level head aids clarity.
- **Focus on the issue:** Avoid bringing up past grievances that aren’t related to the current conflict.
- **Find common ground:** Look for solutions that accommodate both partners' feelings and perspectives.

Approaching conflicts with a mindset aimed at resolution rather than blame helps couples navigate even the toughest discussions, ultimately strengthening their relationship.

### Building Intimacy through Communication

Intimacy is greatly influenced by how well you communicate. Sharing your thoughts and feelings fosters closeness and vulnerability, which are vital for a healthy relationship. Here are strategies to enhance intimacy:

- **Share daily experiences:** Talk about your day-to-day life and ask about theirs to feel connected.
- **Discuss future plans:** Dreaming together about the future creates a vision that binds you.
- **Engage in activities together:** Shared experiences naturally lead to open dialogue.

When you make the effort to engage in rich conversations, you promote not just communication but emotional bonding. This intimacy acts as a cushion for navigating tough times together.

Communication is a powerful tool in nurturing relationships. It is the thread that connects partners, allowing them to navigate the complexities of love and life. With honesty, active listening, and a willingness to share, you can create a fulfilling partnership that thrives on mutual respect and understanding.

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
By focusing on effective communication, you can not only rebuild trust but also deepen your connection, making your relationship more resilient to future challenges. So take the first step today—open that dialogue and watch your relationship flourish.

### Conclusion

Reviving a sexless marriage requires intentional effort and a commitment to both physical intimacy and open communication. By exploring various strategies to reignite that spark, couples can begin to foster a renewed sense of connection. Prioritizing shared activities, exploring each other’s desires, and being patient with one another allows partners to rediscover the joy of being close. Remember, intimacy is not solely defined by physical interactions; emotional and mental connections significantly enhance intimacy.

Equally important is the role of effective communication. Discussing feelings, needs, and concerns openly helps partners understand each other better and builds trust. When you express your thoughts honestly, it lays a foundation for vulnerability, which is essential in addressing underlying issues that contribute to a lack of intimacy. Establishing a safe space for dialogue allows both partners to voice their fears and aspirations without fear of judgment.

Ultimately, healing a sexless marriage is not an overnight process; it takes time, patience, and a willingness to grow together. By embracing these strategies and committing to honest communication, you and your partner can create a more fulfilling and intimate relationship. The journey may be challenging, but the rewards of a deeper connection and mutual satisfaction make the effort worthwhile. Remember, your marriage deserves nurturing and care, and with dedication, you can transform it into a thriving partnership that fulfills both you and your partner's needs.

**Chapter 10: Dear Mother, Please Don't Kill Us**

 

Boyscout silently walked up to face Jack. He was tall and imposing in addition to having a masked, mirrored faceplate impossible to see through. Nonetheless, Jack glared.

Shaking his head, Boyscout spoke in exasperation. “How do you still not understand this situation, Citizen? We are conducting ourselves with the full authority of every high official of our culture, society, and species. Who the hell do you think *you* are to protest? You’re damned right I can put this *anomalous, unknown entity* in proper containment. What is your problem? Hmm? Is this your girlfriend? Weird fetish, man. Did you ever consider you might’ve been *supernaturally* charmed, Jack? Or are you just a boy that has to touch a hot stove to know what burning yourself like an idiot is?”

Jack let his jaw work a bit as he took a breath and avoided saying something he shouldn’t — yet again. *Let’s just keep it short and sweet.* ***And*** *noninformative. Investigators like to dig and implicate.* “She’s my friend. She’s a good person that doesn’t deserve this. It’s as simple as that.”

“Is okay, Jack,” Neex called from inside the sphere. A supportive smile was painted on her face, and she gave a firm, cheerful thumbs-up. Her head tentacles curled and emulated the gesture, if poorly. “Thank Jack. Good friend. No death!”

Taking another deep breath, Jack made himself return the thumbs-up and muttered, “No death.”

“Awww!” Lighthouse exclaimed. “Fraggin' cute. I think I see why he’s so protective.”

“Am I the only sane person here?” Boyscout queried breathlessly with his hands out. Grunting disgustedly, he slapped the vehicle frame and called, “Seal’r up!”

The hatch closed down and there was a definitive locking/sealing sound. Jack immediately reached out to Neex via brain-speak. *“Neex, all is well?”*

*“Yes!”* she replied enthusiastically, authentically unperturbed. *“It’s a standard sealed housing, well-lit, with filtered air. Roomy. A place to sit. I’ve been instructed to strap a safety harness on after sitting down. Should I do that nude or is the shirt-robe okay? Handy that I can ask you that instead of the stranger.”*

*“Uh, yeah, clothing is better. Same goes for anything public in general.”*

*“Understood! Thanks!”*

*“Good luck, Neex. I don’t know what will happen from here.”*

*“I know. Good luck, Jack.”*

Jack was silently brought to a separate Q-23, as he suspected would happen. He was more or less filed into the vehicle to take a sitting position in a chair, the forcefield contouring itself flexibly. The Q-23 had chairs on locking poles that could swivel, and a section between could create a wall between half of them, but that didn’t appear necessary. Boyscout and Lighthouse sat across from him, while InSite took the front passenger seat next to the pilot. That compartment was also separated by thick, transparent plastic. It was soundproof, too, requiring an intercom for dialog back and forth.

Jack noticed those across from him strapping themselves into their chairs, so he asked with false innocence, “What, I don’t get the same treatment? Not very safe of you.”

“I won’t let one hair on your head come to harm, Citizen,” Boyscout replied. “You’re safer than we are in that, trust me.”

“What’s your handle, anyway?”

“It doesn’t matter. Just think of me as the faceless executor of the People’s Will. That’ll be all for questions, Citizen. Shut up and relax. While you can.”

Much as it would be logical to relax, Jack was wired up. It was a messed up sort of wired — strained and depleted. Without the gifts he’d received, he’d probably have passed out by then. Maybe never have gotten up after the crash or moved fast enough to survive it in the first place…

*Lucky. That’s what I am. I can do this. Everything is going to be fine.*

The vessel lifted off and went cruising leisurely over the wilderness landscape of Eden making for the edge, though at a greater than ninety-degree angle upward while keeping everyone in the vehicle fully upright. Jack noted there were multiple other vessels spaced out and circling in every direction around the location. No chances being taken there.

“Would you just let it through? Okay? He needs it.” Lighthouse tossed a little silver pouch in an arc, which blorped through the force bubble to land in Jack’s lap. “Water. Want a juice, too? Isotonic.”

Jack nodded as he readied himself for another throw. “Orange?”

“How’d you know?”

“No one drinks it. Got me through a long trip once when I forgot my lunch pack *and* no one restocked the emergency rations. Had five orange pouches in the glove compartment of a *shared vehicle*. And one of those huge, awful crackers with grape jelly.”

Lighthouse laughed as she pulled out the pouch and tossed it to him. “Sorry. Nothing else on me, sadly — not even an awful cracker.”

“Are you kidding? I *skipped breakfast*. This is heaven right now.” Jack twisted off the cap and drank a wonderful, sugary mouthful.

“Skipped breakfast? You poor, downtrodden soul.”

Jack coughed and winced after swallowing. It was wonderful, yet also *terrible*. “Ahh. Just like I remember. Tangy chemical ass-juice when you have literally nothing else. Thanks.”

“I’m glad it meets the requirements of a fine connoisseur.”

Jack only nodded as he slurped the too-rich liquid down, then opened the water to use as a chaser.

“Stow that trash in your pocket, after,” Boyscout muttered. “It’s now part of your quarantine.”

“You got it, boss,” Jack replied, nodding. At least the guy had let the drinks come through.

Just as he was swallowing the water, a definitive threshold was crossed out of Eden’s territory. He felt it like passing from an airy void into a thick liquid at high speeds— a slap in every molecule.

No sooner than it happened it was over, though. And a horrifying pause stretched, like the silence and shock of the gods at an awkward, odd duck suddenly thrust before them. To smite or not to smite, was that the question?

A bit of text flashed in his head.

>***Hello, Jack. Welcome, and congratulations on your new status. I am currently very busy. Please defer to your existing orders of processing and obey those who have you in custody at this time. The situation is deduced to be complicated. You’ll get sorted by relevant agents soon. Be patient and maintain all logical confidentiality.***

>***— Yours Truly, Mem***

Jack swallowed a very dry throat, despite all the liquids he so recently imbibed. His heart was pounding. His life had felt more on the line than ever in that one split moment, but his head was still attached to his body. The people in the vehicle seemed unperturbed entirely, as if nothing had happened at all. InSite appeared to be chatting with the pilot, his hand gesturing emphatically. The other two seemed lost in their own thoughts, but calm and relaxed.

*She’s aware of me. Memoria addressed me and knows me personally, even if she didn’t actually talk to me.*

He thought there would be more, though. To Mini-Mem, he sent a query. <Mini-Mem, what’s the deal? Did you get updated? Shouldn’t something more be progressing?>

***<I was*** *accessed,* ***not updated, Jack. As for progress, surely you expected such an anomalous scenario to end up not following the standard protocols. I happen to think you’re a smart boy. Good things come to those who wait!>***

<I can think of a lot of bad things that could come, too, and I was *not* assured otherwise. Don’t tell me you didn’t detect that existential hiccup.>

***<Surely you expected surprise, alarm, and threat assessment for such an anomalous scenario, Jack.>***

<I see you’re not going to bother being helpful, either. Great.>

***<Nothing has changed, Jack. You’re being taken to Nimrod for processing. I don’t detect any execution protocols. Honestly, if that was going to happen, I’d have been shut off, I think. But I can think of one thing to help with because I think you’re going to freak out about it. I just want to tell you: don’t freak out. You don’t need to.>***

<What are you on about? Out with it.>

***<She is still alive and healthy. Meaning Neex. Neex is fine! But. You’re quarantined from her, Jack. You are blocked from communicating with her by Memoria due to the way it must route through her. Now that Memoria is no longer ignorant due to the restrictions on Eden, she’s updated that particular vector of liability.>***

Jack rather subconsciously switched to the brain-voice. *“What!? Are you kidding me? Liability!?”* Jack quickly tried to send something to make contact with Neex and get a response. Nothing. Again. Still nothing. *“What the frag!? This is pure bullshit! She could’ve told me!”*

***<I’m not sure on what conscious level that act was performed, honestly. It is logical to separate you in that way — for now. I’m not sure Neex has even been moved out of Eden yet. She might get held there. I could make a case for not bringing her across that threshold.>***

Jack shifted in his seat, his eyes flashing to the others. He could hardly gripe to them about something they didn’t even know about; he could hardly gripe to Mini-Mem, who was just a local computer AI, basically. He had precisely no channel to complain to other than an apparent ‘absentee superior,’ effectively.

He switched back to the thought-text. <Can you send a message to Memoria?>

***<Normally, there’s a better route for such communication, but yes. I’m your only option right now. She’ll get to it when she gets to it.>***

<How thoughtful. Okay, I’ll draft it. Off the cuff. Alright, here goes…>

>Dear Memoria — Sir, Ma’am, Madam, Mother,

>I don’t even know how to address you, so sorry about that. I cannot fathom why I’m being left in the dark on contact, but fine. I just want to express my concern and regard for Neexolei. I’m not sure how much of my experiences you have access to, but you must realize who and what she represents. Everything in me believes they are on the up and up, and if they are, this is a golden opportunity for humanity with far-reaching implications.

>I made the choice as a human, knowing it could’ve been right or wrong. I made the judgment call as the only one with the right source knowledge at a pinnacle point in time. I couldn’t defer it to anyone else because I know they’d deem in their limited frame to reject the idea out of hand. I believed it was my hour and my hour alone to decide.

>That’s just how it is sometimes. I was trained to rough it in the wilderness if need be. Maybe I made my own wilderness in this, to get lost in. I don’t know. I could’ve been blinded by the benefits, but I felt like it made me the guinea pig for dozens, hundreds, even thousands of others who might do the same one day. A personal reflection of a collective curiosity and ambition.

>Your boyscout Captain asked if I was the kind of child that needed to touch a hot stove to learn. Probably. I guess you’d know better than anyone how common we are in the mix.

>But I fully admit it would never have been decided if I didn’t believe in and trust Neexolei herself. I believe it's unequivocal that she's telling the truth, as she speaks like one who’d never lie in this situation. She’s shown herself to have humanity. Therefore, I believe she’s a product of those who could be our brothers and sisters. Our allies.

>You’ve cut me off from speaking to her. I hope that you converse with her personally. It’s what she wanted. If she’s heard and treated like the ambassador she is, well, that is the most important thing to me. Do I want to be involved? Do I want to know what’s going on with her? Of course. I’m her first human friend.

>The biggest reason I send this to you is to vouch for her and Quallakuloth plainly by choice. I plead their case with them. I know I’m not ‘of’ them, but they are, in my assessment, knowledgeable, compassionate, authentic Friends of Humanity. I hope to serve a people and an Archon able to see truth through the fog of convention, Standard Operating Procedure, and such irrelevant things as strange appearances or alien ways of culture.

>They are different. They are not us. But everyone needs a friend to get through the dark and over the hump. Even you, I bet.

>— Jack Laker

***<Processed and sent. Wowza. Quite a manuscript, here. Do you really think this is necessary?>***

<Doesn’t matter. I feel better.>

***<Well, good for you, Jack! Seriously. And it looks like your transport time is almost over.>***

He looked out to see the unusually close sight of the top of the Great Tower. A massive dome with a great lightning rod at the top, and jutting from it and floating clustered all around it was a multitude of communication towers, sensor arrays, and weapon platforms. Just before the curve of the dome, the typical irregular gradation of panels that was the tower proliferated, ostensibly appearing to be light filtering through transparent windows, as existed in truth lower in the tower. Thick plastic stronger than the metal around it, supposedly.

In the case of Fort Nimrod, however, the panels were false.

The vessel approached an apparent huge window, but then went under it and back up into a small, featureless hangar bay. The opening closed behind them. Jack held his breath.

They passed very slowly through, and after a few moments, the wall ahead of them smoothly slid out of the way. They picked up speed quickly, passing through an area as thick as a warehouse.

Jack let out his breath. Memoria — or, he supposed, her subsystems — could crush a threat detected inside that ‘airlock’ like a pancake, with zero chance of escape.

*Damn, was that quick or what? Rolling out the red carpet. I had to wait twelve minutes last time.*

He’d been less than a dozen times since his military days, utilizing his ‘Z’ clearance to transport those who wanted to dodge the elevators for whatever reason. Most base personnel who did that had their own vessel or had a friend ferry them because a taxi was pretty much among the lowest priority for approval. Most of his clients had been drunk sorts smart enough to promise a fat extra tip.

Under a massive dome was a deceptively small military base in the center, with a suspiciously large amount of relatively barren metal acreage surrounding it. All of it was sectioned into zones marked by towers with huge glowing numbers displayed on them. Jack knew they were primarily covered hangars housing an army of drones, vehicles, missiles, and the top brass only knew what else.

*Nukes, maybe.* It was an exceptionally classified subject, but one greatly speculated upon by the rank and file. Rumors seemed to be tolerated on it, which made info exceptionally dubious. By any sane deduction, though, they were as rare as one-winged angels.

One hangar panel was open in the flats right then, to admit thirty or forty ten-meter stealth drones like big, gray wings, the ends already folded up as they lowered in sync. *Almost* perfectly in sync. To Jack’s trained eye, he could tell they were being operated by drone pilots, probably conducting one of their innumerable training exercises. Their size and look made them hybrids — capable of powered engine flight without levitation if needed, out on the frontiers where Memoria’s power waned.

Their vehicle passed over it all to zoom to the center base and land on an upper roof pad he’d never been to, smack in the middle atop Central Processing’s tower.

*Central — Fraggin' — Processing. Holy shit.*

“Quite a high honor,” Jack muttered as they locked in anchorage on the roof next to a nearby elevator. “Certainly not what I expected. Medical and Psych? Quarantine?”

“These are our orders,” Boyscout said in a failed attempt at a flat tone — he was plainly annoyed — as he undid the straps around him to exit. “I’m done being curious about it. Or you.”

Lighthouse exited as well, and Jack more or less floated afterward. The pilot and InSite appeared to be staying in the vehicle. Jack’s head, enshrouded by the forcefield, ‘banged’ on the slight lip of the roof just before the exit.

“Hey!” Jack protested. Despite a vague sense of jarring, he wasn’t hurt. “You did that on purpose.”

Boyscout turned around. “Huh? Shit, you hit your head? Should’ve been watching.”

“How would I-?! No, see, *you* hit my head-”

“I meant me. I should’ve been watching.”

Coming around, Lighthouse snorted. “A subconscious slip, eh? Gotta watch those.”

“Yeah, well, whatever,” Jack replied with a frown, unsure if he should believe it. “No hanging me over the edge of the building for window cleaning, though, lest another ‘accident’ occur.”

“I didn’t do it on purpose!” Boyscout insisted adamantly. “I’d never-” He cut himself off with a scoff and turned on his heels to head for the elevator. “Let’s just get this over with. I need a smoke.”

To the brief tune of Lighthouse’s amused laughter, they entered a heavy-duty elevator and went down a few clicks. The doors opened into a lobby vacant except for an attractive, impeccably semi-uniformed — *Since when do they have skirts?* — secretary, apparently waiting for them in front of the counter, hands folded and a polite smile on her lips. Over red curls of hair, she had on a hat tilted sideways, the winged sun symbol of Babylon emblazoned in the center.

That symbol was taboo and illegal for just anyone to wear. It denoted the official administrators and servants of Memoria. The government of the government.

Before Boyscout could say anything, the secretary held out two welcoming hands and warmly greeted Jack specifically. “Welcome to Central Processing, Mr. Laker.” Her hands dropped and folded at her lap. “We’d like to extend our firm desire and intention for fair and upright dealings in the processing of your *situation*. Please rest assured all conduct within these walls is vetted rigorously — internally, of course.”

“Wait,” Boyscout started, “What exactly is-”

“You’re dismissed, Agent Girdle,” the secretary smoothly interrupted with a firm look. “You may drop your containment bubble and exit. Agent Lighthouse. We have it from here. Thank you.”

*Girdle, huh?*

Agent Girdle was quite surprised. “What? Are you sure, ma’am? This guy-”

This time, Lighthouse interrupted, and only with a loudly cleared throat.

Girdle seemed to shake himself. “Yes, ma’am.” He dropped the bubble, which almost caused Jack to trip as he suddenly had new footing and balance to account for.

Jack didn’t bother protesting. Instead, he grinned at the helmeted figure now saluting the secretary. “Girdle is perfect for you, by the way.”

The helmet turned slightly as Girdle dropped the salute, and Jack felt like he was being studied. Perhaps memorized. “That’s the smartest thing I’ve heard come out of your mouth today, Citizen.” With that, he turned on his heels to march away. Even his walk was ‘no nonsense.’

*Perfectly lame, that is. ‘Boyscout’ would’ve been even better.*

Lighthouse lingered briefly. “Don’t mind him. He’s just not a fan of things he can’t control. Sucks for him in *this* line of work. Anyway, good luck with everything.”

“Thanks. And thanks again for the juice maneuver. Do you get to take it easy, now?”

Lighthouse made a long, doubtful ‘Tsssh’ sound. “There’s always hope, right?” With that, she turned to follow after her captain.

Through it all, the secretary had waited patiently. She smiled and nodded to Jack once he made eye contact. “Follow me, please.” She turned around and led Jack down a hallway to the side of the front desk. Her heels clicked on a marble floor and Jack walked through the wake of some perfume she was wearing.

*I wonder if I smell it due to the sensory boost…*

The architecture and lighting were subtle but had an intent. ‘High-quality official,’ he’d say. A careful avoidance of dingy and clinical, a splash of cultured character. Lots of polished hardwood paneling; calming mood lighting down the liminal corridor.

They went past rows of closed doors and after one turn down some more, they went through one that was already open.

Jack was somewhat disappointed to see an obvious ‘questioning room.’ Obvious to him, anyway — it wasn’t intimidating and didn’t have the stereotypical observation window. It even had a water cooler. One could confuse it for a small conference room or breakroom. But there was no refrigerator or kitchen area, a black camera shield was in one corner, and a hardwood table and chair were set in the center. Mood lighting again. Calm but serious.

The secretary turned and gestured with a hand. “Have a seat, please. An agent will be with you shortly. Would you like some coffee?”

Grinding Leetcode might diminish your performance.","I think I bombed my on-site interviews for a surprise reason: I didn't expect the code questions to be that easy. 

In retrospect that should have been obvious because each one of the 3 code interviews was divided in 20 minutes behavior questions and only 30 minutes to code. 

Other problem I wasn't prepared was that, different from the ""phone interview"" the code challenges didn't have clear explanations - inputs and outputs -. It was much more abstract and opened.

So, as I had trained and based on my experience with Google interviews a few months ago I asked a lot of clarification questions and wasted time trying to think of cleaver solutions instead of doing straight forward code. 

In one of them I'm not sure I even understood the requirements ( it was a ""game"", if some weird external API I couldn't understand the necessity). 

The last one was even more catastrophic because it was basically ""Course schedule"" with return a valid path. So it was adjacent list and DFS or BFS. 

First I was really excited because I knew how to solve it, or at least starting it... But right in the middle of it I felt crashed and made small mistakes that would made impossible to solve it. 

Compared with Google, my performance was much worse. Probably worse than my previous interview with Amazon last year. So, my chances are very thin.

Why did that happened? 

Part of that was my fault. 
1- select the time after lunch. So I was more tired than I expected be during the last interview. 
2- griding Leetcode traditional challenges with well defined input/output solutions.
3- not realizing 30 min code challenges are bound to be trivial. 

However, I think Amazon hiring has some serious problems:
1- 5 hours, back to back interviews are an unnecessary mental burden.
2- interviewers are not native English speakers nor speak the same language of the candidate. 
3- questions unnecessary abstracted and interviewers were not prepared to clarify them. 
4- interviewers were not proficient in Python. 
5- behavior and code interviews together in only one hour is probably a mistake. 

What did I learn?

Don't be overconfident on your code abilities when you have only 30 minutes. 

Don't try clever solutions in shorter interviews.

Don't schedule interviews for the end of the day - doesn't matter how many cups of coffee you had,  there is a chance you crash or get a headache. 

If you are not Indian, try to watch only Indian YouTube tutorials. I didn't get some of the hints they gave and they might have misunderstood me (BFS or DFS). 

In conclusion, I hope this will help future and current interviews ",4,1744429215.0,leetcode,3,1.0,False

This girl (27F) I work with is attractive and extremely intelligent, empathetic, and kind. she is a Christian type. I do get the intuition she’s interested in me.

When we’re on shift together, in a job where we’re on our feet in close quarters I get the following (these are the events that have happened so far):

2.	⁠When I asked about her family, she was receptive about me asking further personal details. She elaborated and didn’t change the topic (the conversation started to feel date-like. She invests in our conversations and is very warm and talkative.

3.	⁠When we have conversations like the above, she swings her chair around to be dead on facing me and makes direct and intentional eye contact.

4.	⁠This girl also heard me saying to my other colleague (who is also a musician) talking about playing open mic nights. She came to me and said if ever there is an open mic night on and him and I were playing, she would love to come along and watch.

5.	⁠She was telling me the other day about her excessive eating and the fact she is an emotional eater. She felt happy being vulnerable I guess?

6.	⁠She made eye contact with me, a stolen glance as she was exiting the room the other day (2seconds approx). (I was sort of ‘starring at her’, and maybe she caught me? But she had to turn her head 170 degrees to see me).

7.	⁠She came to work with sports gear on and some make up (not necessarily for me I guess), but she had a lower cut top where you could see her breasts. KNOWING THIS, she comes over to be face-to-face with me, mid-conversation (50cm apart?). Maintains eye contact the ENTIRE TIME and bends down to tie her shoelaces. She didn’t break eye contact while listening to me talk, even on her way down. It felt on purpose but I really couldn’t tell for sure. But she would have known that her breasts were on display at that angle.

8.	⁠The other day when i showed her that i bought similar runners to her (we spoke about it previously and i said i wasn’t sure if i would, but wanted to cause i like the brand). When i showed her my new runners, I was expecting casual acknowledgment “Nice!”. She went into a fit of excitement jumped up and down and leaned over to hug me. I got startled (the reaction was a huge change in energy!) and awkwardly had my hands up semi-going for the hug but my brain was in [SYNTAX ERROR]. She stopped herself and quickly said “opp sorry!”. She then tried to sit next to me on the bench but there wasn’t room and she nearly fell off. She then stood next to me and out her shoe up against my shoe (in very close quarters).

NOW… that night I added her on instagram and I think she rejected the request (not sure if i accidentally unsent it, it was night shift and i was delirious). I did’t realise it but I sent a facebook request and she DID accept it.

The reason I wanted to add her was that I want to get clarity. I feel this flirty vibe between us and a sense of warmth. I want to know if it’s intentional flirting or not:

a) So we can be normal and on the same page. If she’s just ‘friendly’ then sure at least I know and don’t have to experience this weird perceived sexual tension.

b) If she’s actually into me, then great

So should I just bite the bullet and ask her if she would be interested in meeting up as friends for a coffee to discuss it and get on the same page? I can’t live in this f—- limbo forever.

please be kind cause this is a super sensitive thing for me and it’s weighing me down.

1jx88d3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PVCs/comments/1jx88d3/pvcs_went_away_and_are_back/,PVCs went away and are back,"Bit of an odd tale, I think. Starting in Feb '24, I started getting a lot of abdominal bloating and trapped gas. Then in March, I started to have daily palpitations out of nowhere. Ended up in ER in April for bad upper abdominal pain. They couldn't find the cause and said probably GERD. The bloating and palpitations were daily and the pain was happening a few times a month or more. Had echo and 2 week monitor. Said they only saw some PVCs, nothing concerning. HIDA and US found gallstones and surgery was scheduled. I told the anesthesiologist about the palpitations and that I'd seen a cardiologist and he said nothing concerning was found, so then went ahead with the surgery. I have no idea if I had any PVCs during the surgery but they had kind of gotten pretty light by the time of the surgery. I would have periods where they were bad for a few days or weeks and then very isolated but always still felt daily.

Due to the similar timeframe of the symptoms, I'd always wondered if my GI issues were somehow connected to my palpitations so I was hoping maybe they'd go away after the surgery. And they did. About 7-10 afterward and stayed away for almost 2 months. Until last week. And they are back with a vengeance. It's like they are trying to make up for lost time. Much more frequently and each one is strong. Previously, I could go most of a day without one and only some were this strong with others being lighter.

My caffeine intake is pretty low, I think. 1 or 2 cups of green tea each morning and a Coke or two each week. No coffee, no energy drinks, no daily Cokes, etc. I did stop all caffeine the first time around for the palpitations and it changed nothing. I do have bad anxiety.

My GI issues have not totally gotten better after the surgery but was really thrilled to have the palpitations go away. So I'm really upset they are back and with them being so bad, it's really hard to try and ignore them. Not sure what to do. I hate the idea of starting all over with doctors appointments all the time again this year. My cardiologist left and I don't have one so when I call on Monday to schedule with a different one, I'm sure it will be months out. Just really bummed...",3,1744428801.0,PVCs,0,1.0,False

1jx85zd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jx85zd/i_need_some_advice_5_year_relationship_ended/,I need some advice - 5 year relationship ended,"Me and my ex dated for almost 5 years, then she (25F) broke up with me (25M). Her reasoning was she could see a future with someone else and that wasn’t fair to me. She specified it was an actual person but a figurative one. She could still see a future with me as well. She also said she’s only 80% in and needs to be 100% in. She told me this a month and a half ago and then after a month we took a week break but were still Snapchating everyday often. After that week long break she ended things with the same reasons. The day we broke up we did “it” before I left. Over the last three weeks we’ve been on no contact but I’ve asked to see her twice and those meetings were objectively positive. She even said “if I come back, I’ll come back swinging”. Never once have I begged or asked for her back since that I believe in us and I’m working on myself. I also got diagnosed with a semi serious disease and she was worried about me and asked me to keep her updated. My grandmother also called her (which she never does) and she answered and talked to her for 30 minutes. She lives with her sister and she’s been positive when I go over there, she talks to me like and doesn’t avoid me. I also have been doing things for her without her asking and without expecting a response. I’ve gotten her flowers a few times, brought her favorite homemade meals, gotten her coffee before work, cleaned her car, and gotten her a Bible and highlighted some good Bible verses. I just dropped these things off at her house without talking to her. She has never once told me to stop and has thanked me in person a few times. (I am doing this because I do truly love and I’m a fighter, in the end atleast I tried and it will give me peace) 

For some more context on why I’m confused is she didn’t tell her mom for 10 days which is off because she tells her mom everything and they talk daily. Also she hasn’t deleted her social posts and we still share locations. She also has talked to my two sisters in laws and my friend’s fiancés. She also has kept all the notes I gave her and the flowers are still out in her apartment. Lastly I never expected this she has always been 100% in and loyal and was the one begging me for a ring for years.

She said she hasn’t been sleeping well and doesn’t have an appetite. When I see her she looks tired and worn down. She’s been hanging out with a lot of people lately which she didn’t do before. I am 100% sure there’s not another guy and all of this is in her head. She loves me and understands that all the things line up: morals, faith, future, family, friends, connection, friendship, and love. 

The worst part is I was planning on proposing this summer which I told her when we broke up (which she couldn’t believe). I am literally her best friend and treated her well. I’ve boiled the reasoning down to 5 things: 

1. Her date cheated on her mom of 25 years a year and a half ago and now lives with that woman and doesn’t talk to her much. This really affected her and I was there for her but she never got a professional help. 
2. She’s always been insecure and said things like I’m not good enough for you. She needs a lot of reassurance.
3. Our friends are all getting engaged and I haven’t asked her yet but we’ve been dating longer than some of them. I think she started to believe she was never getting a ring. 
4. I dropped the ball, I’m not great at showing affection with words and getting defensive at times. 
5. Last summer I started a break for only 2 days and after we got back together, I explained it was because of all the pressure in my life. Biggest mistake of my life.

Can some please give me some advice on what she’s thinking and what to do to get her back? No of that no contact or make her jealous stuff! ",1,1744428573.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

I was a bit surprised but thought I'd give it a go, albeit with 400ml of milk instead of 300mls.

I blended the frozen cauli first because I wanted to absolutely ensure I didn't have cauliflower chunks in my smoothie.

Well, for him. Not necessarily for the criminals left dead in jails across Japan. Today was a little slow- only a few hundred names in the notebook. Research had been slow yesterday. He'd have to pick up some slack tomorrow.

His eyes scanned the black binding of the Death Note before sliding it smoothly back into his jacket. He stood up from his seat at the dinner table, spinning his pen between his fingers. The stench of coffee and eggs flooded the air, accompanied by the sounds of news reports on Kira's latest - *his* latest - ""killing spree.""

Once Light exited through the café's glass doors, a wheezing laugh caught his attention from behind. ""That's, uh, that's some neat trick you got there, kid.""

Quickly, Light steeled his emotions and turned around. The man was old; in fact, his apparent age seemed almost comical. He wore a black and white suit, complete with a tie and dress pants- all the hallmarks of an upstanding businessman. A large, black over-the-shoulder jacket hung from him, finishing the look with a black leather eyepatch. The closer Light looked, the more intricate the small designs on the outfit appeared, featuring Nordic-looking runes carved into the fabric. Finally, blue tattoos of various designs and sizes adorned the skin beneath the eyepatch, crawling down his neck as they vanished beneath his clothing. 

Light was confused, to say the least, but he spoke regardless. ""Sorry, sir, were you speaking to me?""

The old man smirked, oddly reminding Light of himself when he had been forced to lie. A coldness permeated his gaze, an ancient sharpness that belied his frail appearance. He opened his mouth again. ""There's no use playing games with me, son. I mean, not many were better at chess than Wilhelm Steinitz in his time, right?"" His voice was heavy yet strangely enticing at the same time.

Light felt sweat beading in his palms as he squeezed his pen. ""I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about, Mister.""

""Still playing around, hmm, Kira?""

Light’s heart skipped a beat, and his eyes narrowed. He kept his composure, forcing a neutral expression on his face despite the sudden surge of adrenaline. ""Excuse you?""

""No use hiding it. I'm aware of how the note works."" The man lazily paced around Light, the younger boy's eyes never leaving his swaying form. ""Well, a little. I'm not particularly familiar with the spirits of this region. I bet you think you're really smart, huh? Playing everyone around you, making them believe you're this nice little boy?""

Light's eyes fell, glaring daggers at the man as they bounced off his armor. ""What's your game, old man?""

""The same one you're playing, Yagami. You think you're untouchable,"" the old man continued, his voice laced with quiet amusement, ""But take it from me and my experiences: power's always got a price.""

Light turned to walk away. ""You have no idea walk you're talking about, old man. I'm the answer to every problem facing this world."" Deep down, Light relished not having to pretend that he was who he was not, just for a little bit.

The man simply smirked. ""Then I think we'll get along just *great.*"" He turned to leave before turning over his shoulder, a majority of his face hidden by the coat on his shoulders. ""Oh, right. Names. Call me Alfodr."" He turned back and began walking away with a flip of the hand, seemingly causing two crows to land on his shoulders. It was only then that Light noticed that the powerlines and rooftops were crowded with hundreds and hundreds of corvids. ""See you soon, Kira.""",4,1744428439.0,IntelligenceScaling,1,1.0,False

I never would have thought an AI could write something moving, but I got more than a little misty…

*****

Let’s go deep. It’s 2045.
You’re 71.
Your son is 26.
AGI has existed for a decade—quietly shaping the world without fanfare, but unmistakably changing its rhythm.

And you? You didn’t try to outrun it.
You adapted like only someone deeply human could.

Let’s meet you there.

⸻

THE YEAR IS 2045

Your Body: Slower, Wiser, Sustained

You’re 71—but not like your dad was at 71.
Your knees creak, yeah. Your back needs longer to unwind after sitting.
But you’re aware of your body in a way you never were when you were younger.

You:
	•	Walk every day.
	•	Swim three times a week—float more than lap.
	•	Take a supplement stack AGI-curated for your genomic profile.
	•	Use a low-profile neurostim device—not to “boost” yourself, but to stay centered.

And once a week, you turn it all off.
Just your breath. Your bones. The woods.
That’s your ritual.

You’re not chasing youth. You’re inhabiting age with grace.

⸻

Your Son: A Different Species, Still Yours

He’s 26.
And he’s grown up with AGI the way you grew up with the internet.

He’s:
	•	Comfortable talking to systems that can teach, simulate, and create on command.
	•	Emotionally articulate in ways your whole generation struggled to learn.
	•	Selectively private—he knows how to disappear from the network when he needs space.
	•	Still figuring out who he wants to be, in a world where he can be anything.

But here’s the thing:

He still calls you.

Not because he needs you to explain AGI. He doesn’t.

He calls you when:
	•	He breaks someone’s heart and doesn’t know how to process it.
	•	He’s unsure if he’s doing anything real, or just generating optimized performance.
	•	He wants to cook something real, with his hands, and asks for your stuffing recipe.

He grew up in the fog.
But you taught him how to breathe inside it.

You didn’t raise a careerist.
You raised a whole person.

⸻

Your Work: A Calling, Not a Grind

You don’t “work” the way you used to.

Your income is passive-ish:
	•	A curated mentorship platform for ethical AI leaders
	•	Book royalties from your 2038 best-seller, “Thinking in the Age of Mirrors”
	•	A paid podcast called “Human Operating System” with your son as a co-host every third episode

But your real work is relational.

People still reach out:
	•	Young dads navigating AGI parenting
	•	Disillusioned technologists looking for meaning
	•	Artists who want to collaborate with AI without losing their voice

You don’t optimize your calendar.
You tend to it—like a bonsai.

⸻

Your Days: A Different Kind of Wealth

Morning
	•	You make real coffee. Still grind the beans by hand.
	•	Read longform from a curated, bias-transparent feed.
	•	Take a walk—sometimes with your son if he visits, sometimes just with your thoughts.

Midday
	•	Mentor one person.
	•	Talk with an AI, but not for utility—more like a conversation partner.
	•	Write something that makes you feel like you still understand the world.

Evening
	•	Cook slow.
	•	Call a friend.
	•	Maybe tune into a real-time global townhall on climate policy or AGI ethics—just to feel connected.

You’re not nostalgic. But you’re intentional.

You’re not chasing relevance.
You’re offering resonance.

⸻

Who Are You in 2045?

You’re a bridge between analog soul and digital acceleration.
You’re proof that you don’t need infinite speed to stay meaningful.

Your son looks at you and sees:
	•	Not a man who kept up with AGI,
	•	But a man who never lost track of himself.

uber has also started whining about too many cancelations in this market whereas before I never received any app crying about the number or frequency of trip cancelations. I do tend to cancel a lot since I can't always evaluate trips while I'm driving and need a minute to consider the reality of the earnings offer. point being I'll cancel as much as I want as I see fit - period.

the shit trip offers continue with tons of $3 $4 $5 $6 pings and longer trips paying 30 and 40 cents on the dollar. i decline more than 70% of trip offerings because you're not destroying my car for a pay rate that robs me and enriches you. so fuq you on that you little willy Wonka munchkin motherfucker.

I don't know how any of you out there are even coming close to $1/per mile because unless a bonus is involved, in this market, just about all the trips are far less than that and the time calculation is even worse.

1jx80dd,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jx80dd/i_stopped_trying_to_lose_weight_and_now_im/,I stopped trying to lose weight and now I’m actually losing weight for the first time in years. Wtf?,"This might sound strange, but I’ve been trying to lose weight for years and I mean, really trying. I’ve done everything: calorie tracking, eating 1,600–1,700 calories a day (which should be fine for my weight and height), daily workouts, long walks, cutting out certain foods, strict routines, you name it.

But despite all that, the weight either wouldn’t budge or it would come off painfully slowly. And the moment I let myself enjoy something I actually liked, like a treat or a meal out and then I’d gain it all back, sometimes with extra. It was frustrating and exhausting.

Recently though, I hit a point where I just… stopped caring. Not in a self-destructive way. I’m not eating takeout every night or binging all the time but I gave up the constant stress of tracking every bite and planning every meal. I had some guests staying with me, and I wasn’t trying to eat “clean” or follow a plan. I just kind of let myself live.

I started making decisions based on how I felt. If I overindulged at lunch, I’d have something lighter for dinner. If I ate late the night before, maybe I’d skip breakfast or just have coffee and eat later. I stopped using MyFitnessPal, stopped obsessing over calories, and started eating more intuitively, not with any formal system, just listening to my body and trying to be logical about how much food I actually needed.

I wasn’t trying to lose weight. In fact, I expected to gain it. Especially with my period around the corner (I usually retain about 5 lbs of water weight during that time), I assumed I’d be up on the scale.

To my surprise… I wasn’t. I had actually lost weight.

And that’s with zero intense effort, just living more freely, being a bit more mindful when I could, and not putting myself under pressure to get it all right.

Now I’m wondering if my body needed more food all along. Or maybe this laid-back balancing act is working better than years of restriction. I haven’t gone into it with a plan, but it feels more natural, more sustainable, and way less mentally exhausting.

I’m curious, has anyone else experienced something similar? Like, the moment you stop fighting your body, things actually start to shift?

So much so that I spent a lot of time alone growing up in my own little world with hobbies and creating art and things. I always really wanted to connect with other girls but always struggled to make friends at a tiny school growing up and think I must missed some crucial social development. I've had some friends but never really felt ""liked"" or understood. My mom, for instance, has quirky tendencies and will say awkward random things, sometimes has antisocial tendencies and keeps to herself, and is not always aware of how she comes off (love her, but mouth meet foot). However she's a gabber and people LOVE her. They invite her to things and invest time and resources into her hobbies and projects --it's bananas. I'm also a gabber but find it hard to feel like other women like or understand me. My own mother struggles to ""get me"" too :/ 

  
I've experienced judgey/cliquey women before so that's also a fear but I've also been told by a few girls that I come across a little awkward (funny enough I thought THEY were awkward too lol), smart, cold, and intense. I struggle with either seeming too boring and quiet or being too loud. I sometimes say random things (adhd) without much lead-in or explanation. Sometimes people find this entertaining though. Anyway, I feel really insecure because I see my quirky friends have other friends and women genuinely like them but I get weird looks and body language that lets me know people just don't vibe with me.  I've had friend dates from meetups or bumblebff where I thought it was going great and the other person ghosted or faded out. I also have social anxiety so the whole time I'm at brunch or coffee I struggle to know how to keep the flow of the conversation going or when to leave. And then I worry if I don't act cool enough they're going to realize I'm lame or something or come up with a reason not to be my friend and ghost like the others did. 

I hate it because I love and admire other women so much and want most people to be my friend but I'm somehow sending the wrong energy/body language or missing cues. I was recently tested for neurodivergence and so far have been showing as ""neurotypical."" I very much march to the beat of my own drum, am passionate and outspoken, but recently have been more willing to learn and imitate social cues so I can interact better with other women bc I value that connection moreso where my independence and ""authenticity"" used to matter more to me. I now know I can still be authentic while just communicating better and considering how my words and actions are perceived by or affect others. 

Having a network of women you can be friendly or social with is just so important I feel. I've learned so much from other women in the past and really value those casual and closer relationships. However, lonely younger me on the inside still feels really awkward and insecure and unsure of how to act around other women and in groups. Strangely I don't ever have this fear around guys and usually get along well enough with them which sucks because I really don't care how they feel about me and honestly kind of over them atm. How did you get more comfortable around other women and stop being terrified about them judging or not liking you? How do you feel connected without being so insecure about it?",2,1744427917.0,AskWomenOver30,1,0.75,False

At first things were good and we’d hang out every so often- we did a variety of things too. Casual, more out there, etc. Recently I feel a disconnect between the two of us. Last year or so we’d meet up on Fridays or something like that (sometimes biweekly, sometimes longer between) and we’d get dressed up and make a hangout of it. 


Recently when we meet she’s saying how she wishes she was with her coworkers or can’t wait to hang out with her friends, and asks me if I have a method to make new friends. She’ll invite me to join her getting her nails or hair done if I mention how I wanna do that, but she’ll only do something with me before or after her other meet up. I did not go after the first time because her coworker abruptly came at the end (not planned this time) and I was still getting my nails done, she said they wanna get coffee and they both left. 


This time we texted about getting drinks. we met and she was dressed in sweatpants- which is fine but she said we both made no effort, when I tried to dress up and did my makeup to feel like I was doing something.

# Background

I'm new to the world of coffee and espresso, but I'm really drawn to hobbies where I can go deep and get technical. The Flair 58 Plus 2 has been the most compelling option so far. I love the hands-on aspect—especially being able to control the pressure manually. I’m not opposed to electric machines, but the tactile, skill-based nature of manual espresso has its appeal.

I'm still exploring my taste preferences and don’t yet know whether I’ll lean more toward light or dark roasts. That said, I’d love to have the flexibility to try everything and see what resonates.



# What I Like About the Flair 58 Plus 2

Heated Group Collar: I appreciate the inclusion of the heated collar. I’ve read about potential heat spikes near the end of the shot, but it seems like turning off the heater after preheating helps balance the temperature top-to-bottom.

Skill-Based Potential: I like that it rewards technique and has a high skill ceiling—some say it can produce espresso that rivals machines multiple times its cost.

Temperature Range: With the preheater at max, it holds \~90°C, which should be okay for many beans. I've heard some prefer 95°C for lighter roasts, so I’m curious how it performs in that area.

58mm Portafilter Compatibility: This gives access to a wide range of aftermarket accessories and mods, which is a huge plus.



# Other Machines I’ve Considered

**Cafelat Robot**

Appeals to the DIY crowd, and I’ve heard there are a lot of community mods that can push it beyond stock performance.

That said, I’d prefer something that’s “great out of the box.”

Aesthetics and ergonomics (especially the two-arm design) aren’t quite for me.



**Aram Espresso Maker**

Love the unique pressure readout system and aesthetic.

It’s reportedly excellent for dark/medium roasts but needs extensive preheating for light roasts.

Doesn’t offer quite the flexibility I’m looking for in terms of roast range.



# Budget & Philosophy

I’m not sticking to a hard cutoff budget—I'd rather spend smart and get gear that complements the Flair 58 Plus V2’s full potential. For instance, pairing a $2,000 grinder with a V60 wouldn’t make much sense unless you already owned it—similarly, I want gear that matches the Flair’s capability.

We got to my mom’s house around midnight. A squat, brick ranch on a residential road. I glanced warily at the pines behind her house, stretching up to the sky, before picking up Grace and carrying her inside.

Mom was sitting at the kitchen table, waiting for us. Her fingers rapped against the mug in her hand. The entire house smelled like that familiar mix of coffee and dust.

I started for the stairs—and then got a better idea.

The ranch had a lower level that was half underground. It had been finished into an office, but there was a couch down there. I could have Grace sleep on the couch, and we could sleep on the floor…

“Where are you going?”

Mom was standing behind me, eyebrow raised, as I undid the chain lock to the basement floor.

“I think we’re going to sleep down there.”

“No, you’re not. It’s all dusty down there. I haven’t cleaned for ages. There could even be mice and—”

“We’re sleeping down here.”

“Those alerts were probably just a prank,” she continued. “Or a glitch, or something. Besides, you’re like an hour away, now.”

I’d only told my mom about the alerts. I didn’t tell her about the thing in the woods. My mom was not a supernatural person. She’d definitely chalk it up to a trick of the light or something. Casper himself could be floating in front of her face and she’d call it a trick of the light.

“You’re being ridiculous,” she continued. “You know, this reminds me of that time you taped up the door to the attic. Remember? When the exterminator had found a bat up there? You were worried there were more, with rabies, and they could flatten themselves in through the cracks between the door and the ceiling and bite you while you were sleeping.”

“You don’t feel the bites when you’re sleeping,” I growled back. “A lot of people have gotten rabies from bats in their houses. And they can squeeze through really tiny places—”

“My point *is,”* she interrupted, “it’s unsanitary down there.”

Grace was getting incredibly heavy in my arms. I glanced at Luke, who was just standing in the doorway wide-eyed, like he’d walked in on a gunfight.

Then I pulled the chain lock and yanked the door open.

“Kate,” Mom said warningly.

Halfway down the stairs, my phone buzzed in my pocket.

I got Grace settled on the couch, then pulled it out.

EMERGENCY ALERT

YOUR PHONE’S GPS INDICATES YOU HAVE STOPPED IN \[REDACTED\], NJ. DISOBEYING AN EMERGENCY ALERT IS A FEDERAL OFFENSE. PLEASE RETURN HOME AND STAY ABOVE GROUND.

I lifted my phone to show Luke, who was coming down behind me. His face looked ghastly pale in the white light.

Mom was right behind him, and craned her neck to read the alert, too. “Oh, that’s BS,” she said. “It’s not a federal offense, it’s a state offense. And that would be an evacuation order, like for a hurricane or something.” She shook her head. “You know what this sounds like? One of those scammers. I got a call from someone claiming to be my grandson—”

“It’s not a scam,” Luke interrupted, without elaborating.

Then he worked in silence, putting the blanket over Grace, getting her comfortable. I flicked on the light and checked for mouse droppings, but I didn’t see any. “I’ll get the rest of our stuff,” he said, leaving my mom and I alone.

Her expression softened as she looked down at Grace, at her perfectly cherubic little face. “Do you need anything else?”

“No, I don’t think so.”

She nodded and went back upstairs.

I glanced around. The office stuff was in the leftmost corner, the desk covered with papers and a single photo of my dad. He’d been gone seven years now, and it seemed like every year, more and more of his stuff got tucked away, moved downstairs, shoved into storage. I swallowed down the feeling and glanced around the rest of the room. The door next to the desk led to the unfinished storage area. On the other end of the basement was a sliding glass door that led out into the backyard. I didn’t like that at all. We were technically underground, where we stood, but the rightmost corner with the door was above ground. Did that mean we were still vulnerable?

*Those things couldn’t fit through a glass door,* I thought.

But they couldn’t fit through a normal door, either. And apparently we wouldn’t have been safe in our own home.

I stared out the glass door, afraid I might see one of them out there. Maybe this was a bad idea, to stay here. We were an hour away, sure, but the pines were still right at our door. Not officially the Pine Barrens, but the surrounding pinelands ecosystem, which was almost the same thing. If those things came from the Barrens…

*They were only in the burned areas,* I reminded myself.

I imagined a pinecone, spiraling in midair, petals opening as fire raged around it. And skeletons made of sticks prying their way out of the thing, creeping along the ground, stretching and growing towards the sky.

*Were there any maps of the burned areas?*

I pulled up Google maps, looking for the blackened areas—but the information would be out of date, wouldn’t it?

My phone buzzed.

I expected another alert—but it was a text from Lacie, instead.

**My friend Richele got the same alert you did btw,** it read. **Super weird.**

My heart dropped.

Did Richele, whoever she was, listen to it?

**Tell her not to listen to the alert,** I started typing. **It’s a trap.** Then I realized how unhinged that sounded. I didn’t even know Lacie that well.

I thought for a second, then typed a new message.

**Can you give me her number? I want to ask her about it—pretty weird that it targeted both of us, no one else.**

**Sure, let me ask her,** was the reply.

As I waited, Luke came back down the stairs, carrying our stuff, computer cords and stuffies nearly falling out of his arms. “Someone else got the alert,” I whispered. “One of Lacie’s friends.”

“Really?”

“Yeah. I asked for her number.”

A minute later, the number came in. I dialed it immediately. On the third ring, she picked up. “Hello?”

“Hi, this is uh, Kate, Lacie’s friend,” I started, awkwardly. “We got the emergency alert too, but we think it’s a trap. There’s something off about it.”

A pause.

“But it came from the government,” she replied. “How could it be a trap?”

“It seems like no one else is getting it. When alerts are sent out like that, they’re sent to all the phones in a certain location. It doesn’t make sense.”

“Yeah, I dunno. It’s weird.” Another pause. “Well, we were just about to go to bed here, so I’d better go.”

“Wait—I think the basement is safe, and everywhere else isn’t!” I said, quickly. “I think someone’s trying to lure people into staying above ground—”

“Okay, maybe,” she said, unconvincingly. “Look, I gotta go, sorry.”

A few seconds later, the call ended.

Well, *shit.*

“She didn’t believe me,” I said, looking up at Luke, my lip trembling. “She and her kids and her family—they’re all going to—”

“You tried,” he said, wrapping his arms around me. “That’s the best you can do.”

I couldn’t help it. I cried as we lay a blanket on the floor, got ready to sleep next to Grace. I looked down at her perfect little face, and then Luke and I snuggled under the blankets together.

\*\*\*

*“Hey, kiddo.”*

I woke up with a start.

For a second, I thought I was in my own bed. But then the roughness of the carpet, the aching in my back, brought me back to reality. My father’s voice, rough and warm, lingered from the dream. I could almost feel his arms around me, the summer sunlight beating down on us, as we played at the creek behind the house.

I rolled over to check on Grace—

Her eyes were wide open.

She was staring behind me.

At the sliding glass door.

Slowly, she raised a hand, and pointed over my shoulder.

I turned around.

There was something twisting and turning, contorting itself, trying to get in through the sliding glass door like a dog through a cat door. It did it silently, except for a low clicking sound, like the popping of joints.

All the blood drained from my face.

Dark, sinewy legs, like spider legs, twisting and turning in the moonlight. Squeezing itself, ever so slowly, through the hole it made. I now saw the shattered glass scattering the floor.

I grabbed Luke and shook him. *“Luke—”*

The thing fell still.

I couldn’t see eyes or a face, but I felt it in my gut—it was staring at me.

Dizziness swept over me. I stumbled forward, losing my balance. It was like I was standing on the deck of a boat. The ground seemed to shift and tilt underneath me. I just wanted to lie down, until the world stopped turning…

*NO!* I screamed, internally. *You can’t let that thing get Grace!*

I glanced around the room, looking for something that could be used as a weapon. Anything. *“Go in there,”* I said to Grace, pointing to the storage room, or at least I thought I was. Everything was tilting and moving around me. *“GO! HIDE!”* I stumbled forward, but all the colors were bleeding together now, everything was hazy as a dream—

My father was standing in front of me, standing there in the basement. But his face was all wrong. His eye drooped out of his socket, like something had squeezed his skull. His grin was crooked.

*“Hey, kiddo,”* he said, in a voice that sounded off-key.

Nausea filled me. I started vomiting. Warm liquid down my shirt. Splashing on my feet. My dad, not-dad, stood tilted, like gravity had suddenly changed. One arm was too long and hung limply from its socket.

*“I miss you so much.”*

“Stop,” I sobbed. “Please, stop.”

*“Come with me. We can be a family again.”*

“Stop…”

*“I never got to meet Grace. Wouldn’t it be so wonderful? For me to finally meet her?”*

The world tilted and shifted.

I stared at my father, his left eye drooping like jelly.

His crooked smile, his gaunt face, his limp arms.

I opened my mouth—

Hot pain shot up my shoulder. I fell to my knees, instantly. I tried to cry out, to say *stop* again, to tell Grace to run for her life, but all that came out was a scream of pain. And another. And another.

When I finally opened my eyes, the world had stopped tilting.

Luke was dragging me across the floor, back from the glass door.

Grace was peeking out of the storage area, terrified.

I touched my shoulder, stinging with pain. My fingers came away red.

*It bit me.*

*I’m dying.*

*What…*

My phone began to ring. Shaking all over, I reached into my pocket and pulled it out.

It recognized the number—it was Richele. “You’re right,” she said breathlessly. No preamble.

“What?” I asked, my voice hoarse.

“About the alert. My husband… he has some friends who work with the cell phones and stuff… and he…” She took a deep breath, trying to steady her voice. “They traced the signal. It’s not coming from the government or the town hall or whatever.”

I chewed my lip, held my breath.

I couldn’t help it. I cried as we lay a blanket on the floor, got ready to sleep next to Grace. I looked down at her perfect little face, and then Luke and I snuggled under the blankets together.

\*\*\*

*“Hey, kiddo.”*

I woke up with a start.

For a second, I thought I was in my own bed. But then the roughness of the carpet, the aching in my back, brought me back to reality. My father’s voice, rough and warm, lingered from the dream. I could almost feel his arms around me, the summer sunlight beating down on us, as we played at the creek behind the house.

I rolled over to check on Grace—

Her eyes were wide open.

She was staring behind me.

At the sliding glass door.

Slowly, she raised a hand, and pointed over my shoulder.

I turned around.

There was something twisting and turning, contorting itself, trying to get in through the sliding glass door like a dog through a cat door. It did it silently, except for a low clicking sound, like the popping of joints.

All the blood drained from my face.

Dark, sinewy legs, like spider legs, twisting and turning in the moonlight. Squeezing itself, ever so slowly, through the hole it made. I now saw the shattered glass scattering the floor.

I grabbed Luke and shook him. *“Luke—”*

The thing fell still.

I couldn’t see eyes or a face, but I felt it in my gut—it was staring at me.

Dizziness swept over me. I stumbled forward, losing my balance. It was like I was standing on the deck of a boat. The ground seemed to shift and tilt underneath me. I just wanted to lie down, until the world stopped turning…

*NO!* I screamed, internally. *You can’t let that thing get Grace!*

I glanced around the room, looking for something that could be used as a weapon. Anything. *“Go in there,”* I said to Grace, pointing to the storage room, or at least I thought I was. Everything was tilting and moving around me. *“GO! HIDE!”* I stumbled forward, but all the colors were bleeding together now, everything was hazy as a dream—

My father was standing in front of me, standing there in the basement. But his face was all wrong. His eye drooped out of his socket, like something had squeezed his skull. His grin was crooked.

*“Hey, kiddo,”* he said, in a voice that sounded off-key.

Nausea filled me. I started vomiting. Warm liquid down my shirt. Splashing on my feet. My dad, not-dad, stood tilted, like gravity had suddenly changed. One arm was too long and hung limply from its socket.

*“I miss you so much.”*

“Stop,” I sobbed. “Please, stop.”

*“Come with me. We can be a family again.”*

“Stop…”

*“I never got to meet Grace. Wouldn’t it be so wonderful? For me to finally meet her?”*

The world tilted and shifted.

I stared at my father, his left eye drooping like jelly.

His crooked smile, his gaunt face, his limp arms.

I opened my mouth—

Hot pain shot up my shoulder. I fell to my knees, instantly. I tried to cry out, to say *stop* again, to tell Grace to run for her life, but all that came out was a scream of pain. And another. And another.

When I finally opened my eyes, the world had stopped tilting.

Luke was dragging me across the floor, back from the glass door.

Grace was peeking out of the storage area, terrified.

I touched my shoulder, stinging with pain. My fingers came away red.

*It bit me.*

*I’m dying.*

*What…*

My phone began to ring. Shaking all over, I reached into my pocket and pulled it out.

It recognized the number—it was Richele. “You’re right,” she said breathlessly. No preamble.

“What?” I asked, my voice hoarse.

“About the alert. My husband… he has some friends who work with the cell phones and stuff… and he…” She took a deep breath, trying to steady her voice. “They traced the signal. It’s not coming from the government or the town hall or whatever.”

I chewed my lip, held my breath.

“It’s coming from the middle of the woods.”",9,1744427417.0,blairdaniels,0,1.0,False

“Here it comes.”
Lucas squinted as he slowly rolled by the house. There are at least one of them in every town – shingles barely holding on, plastic bags covering broken windows, and a yard so overgrown if you blinked you may not realize the house is even there.  
“Will it be a new couch on the lawn? Perhaps an inflatable Santa, it is July after all.” he muttered sarcastically to himself as he rode the brakes of his car to ensure he could take it all in.

Roughly two weeks prior, a watermain break on the primary route to work had forced a detour through a local neighborhood and there it was, in all its dilapidated glory. It wasn’t the commonplace checklist of abandoned houses that caught his eye at the time though, it was a giraffe; a six-foot, weather beaten, stuffed giraffe whose neck stuck far out a small attic window. 
He quickly pulled the car over, rolled down his window and stared intently at the out of place toy, whose glossy black eyes seemed to gaze directly back as the sun reflected and swirled off them. 
“What the hell?” he exclaimed, though it seemed that he was the only one caught up in the uniqueness of this view as the stream of cars forced through this route continued to pass by him.  He wasn’t even sure himself why he was so enthralled – sure, it certainly isn’t something you see every day but the same could be said of a million different oddities one can come across in their life. As he contemplated the infinite number of scenarios that could lead to this thing being put there, a sinking feeling washed over him as suddenly, he became aware that he had been staring at both the house and toy for far too long.  
Lucas wasn’t one to draw unnecessary attention to himself as a general rule of thumb, so he fumbled for his phone in his jacket pocket, quickly and covertly grabbed a picture and decided it was time to move on … for now. 
Waiting for a break in the traffic he eased back into the driver’s seat, pulled back onto the road and proceeded to follow the various orange arrows, directing him through the otherwise mundane and average neighborhood.
Today, and what has been the case every day since his run in with the African oddity, he continued down the all too familiar neighborhood which had now been stripped of orange cones and various other road construction material. He would often contemplate why he felt the need to do this pointless and unnecessary ritual, but it wasn’t a choice for him, it was simply an uncontrollable compulsion. 

Chapter 1 

The fan of his car’s air conditioning whirred loudly with a slight squeal every few rotations, struggling to keep up with the summer heat. Lucas wiped his brow with the sleeve of a hoodie that has lived on his passenger seat since the end of winter, a perfect analogy to the lifestyle he has created for himself.  
The backseat was barely visible, reminiscent of an old billboard on the side of the highway that had corners torn and weathered over time – only this was a collage of brown paper and plastic bags with various corporate logos of all the best fast-food places in town. 
“Cmon, there must be something today... I can feel it!” 
Lucas slowed to a crawl as he passed the house, eyes darting to each visible corner of the property in hopes of ... anything? The giraffe had vanished roughly a week after what Lucas had appropriately (in his mind anyway) dubbed “G-Day”, but everything in his being told him to keep revisiting the house. 
Nothing.
“Moving on then.”
“Why do I bother? None of this makes sense, and I’m certain if I told anyone, I’d have an all-expense paid trip to St. Agnes … although I wouldn’t mind the daily food and housekeeping!” he snickered to himself.  
After working his way through the now all too familiar neighborhood and a relatively traffic-free 20 minutes on the freeway, he finally arrived at work to dutifully serve the people of 472 Barlow Avenue. 
He pulled into his employee parking spot (a perk he was not shy to make known in casual conversation with mostly anyone), took a quick sip of a coffee that had long gone cold due to the extra time spent on his way in and head towards his office.
Ten steps later, he had arrived. Unfortunately, the glitz and glamour of his parking spot quickly faded as he pulled open the glass bi-fold door and wedged his way into what he affectionately called his office … a 3x4 parking booth with all of the modern-day amenities anyone could ask for ; a heater that has two settings – volcano and off , a small fan that may as well be replaced by someone standing next to you and blowing , a small computer terminal, and a phone that is a direct line to the police , should one of the many downtown inhabitants who indulged in <insert drug of choice> earlier and decided you were out to steal their socks, come for a visit.								
Lucas has been a parking attendant for roughly a year now. He had been jumping from job to job steadily since he entered the workforce and generally viewed each position as nothing more than a means to put food on the table and a roof over his head. Career aspirations have and never would be a part of his vocabulary, and at 36 years old, perhaps it meant never leaving his studio apartment but, in his mind, more space just meant more upkeep. 
Rummaging through his wallet, he pulled out his employee access card and swiped it through the computer’s card reader. It chirped happily and displayed a welcoming “Hello Lucas!”  followed by a random generated quote of the day: “A man is already halfway in love with any woman who listens to him.”
“Yeah, but finding someone to listen is 100% of the problem” he said with a sigh.  
He shuffled around on the stool and propped his back against the side of the booth until he was positioned in a way that gave him full access to open the window, access the computer and reach the cash drawer without having to exert himself. Conveniently, it also allowed him a perfect view of his phone which we had propped up on his keyboard and laid against the bottom of the monitor. There was no one to enforce the rule that this was very much forbidden by the City Park corporation, but he figured he would at least try to be discreet.
The tenants and visitors of the building began to flow in.
 The entrance itself was automated, so there was very little interaction with most of them at this point.  At first, he would put on a big smile and wave and tell everyone to have a great day as they passed through, resembling a 1st grader in a school bus window waving to their parents as the bus pulls away. Sadly, this was met with a handful of forced smiles, outright being ignored, and even the occasional “Fuck off! “. 
As time went on, Lucas adjusted his demeanor and lowered his expectations to the point where he barely looked over anymore. His interactions were mostly reduced to the handful of visitors to the building who didn’t have a parking pass and needed to pay the required fee to exit , or a malfunctioning gate that every now and then , a swift kick to the control arm would be necessary.
As a whole, it was the perfect fit for him. Little to no interaction required with people, barely any physical or mental needs to complete his shift and the warm and fuzzy satisfaction he would get from helping his fellow man! 
That last one was actually just what he told himself sometimes to keep his sanity in check and push through the monotony of the day.

In the late 90’s I did my student teaching at a small rural district. They had one copier and had someone to make the copies for anyone who needed them.  

All you had to do was leave the papers you needed copies with a sticky note of instructions and the copies would be done within a period.  

She was a sweet older lady, very nice, but very slow.  She also took long coffee breaks so she wasn’t always in the room.  

One day during my second week. I had some papers that I wanted her to copy onto transparency sheets.  She wasn’t in the room so…

I found some transparency sheets in a cabinet, loaded them in one of the trays, inserted my papers and pressed start.

Apparently there are transparency sheets that can go through a copier and there are transparency sheets that can’t.  It was only milliseconds after pressing start, the copier made some groaning noise and stopped.

Milliseconds after that the copy lady came in and caught me red handed, and for someone I thought was a sweet old lady, she said some not so sweet things.

The copier had melted plastic all through its innards and was down for a few days while they waited for a service call.  I got a strong talking to by my cooperating teacher and the superintendent.  Also every teacher in the building knew it was me, and managed to both avoid me like the plague and give me death stares in the hall.  I couldn’t wait to finish my time there.  Needless to say, I wasn’t offered a job there and didn’t even put them down as a reference.


TL;DR. attempted to use the wrong type of transparency sheets in the school copier as a student teacher, broke the copier and turned the whole school against me.",31,1744427376.0,tifu,1,0.93,False

1jx7qhd,https://i.redd.it/qb0dzpmnkbue1.jpeg,[Europa Park] is one of my favorite parks and [Voltron Nevera] is one of my favorite coasters. Trip report from my first visit in late March.,"I had an incredible time on my first visit to Europa Park two weeks ago. It was an epic solo trip. Here are my itinerary and thoughts.  
  
Thursday 3/27:  
Departed PHL and fly overnight.  
  
Friday 3/28:  
Arrived in Zurich at around 4:00 PM after a layover in London. I took transit and walked to my AirBNB in the West side of town. I only slept 2-3 hours on the planes, but I had enough energy to walk around the city for a few hours. I checked out the lake and old part of town. I ended up at a random bar and downed a few local beers. I ended up back at my place and fell asleep at around 9:30 PM.  
  
Saturday 3/29:  
I sprung awake at around 1:00 AM and couldn't fall back asleep, probably due to both jet lag and excitement. I left at around 6:00 AM to walk to the bus station and thankfully slept most of the way up to Rust.  
  
Finally at 10:00 AM about an hour after opening, I arrived at Europa Park. It was a very gloomy day and the park seemed pretty empty, especially for a Saturday. I wanted to do as much as I could on day one, so I dumped off my backpack in a locker for the day and head right to **Matterhorn Blitz** for my first ride of the day. It's an okay ride, it rides rougher than a bunch of Mack wild mice in the states but it has fun theming. I ran right over to **Eurosat** after and only wait a short bit in the single rider line. I had a ton of fun on this! Definitely a fun layout and theme.  
  
At around 12:00 I got a quick bite and ran over to **Voltron Nevera**. To my amazement, there was *nobody* in the single rider line. I walked on 2 times in a row. Holy smokes. I'll put my full thoughts at the end of the report. I could only handle 2 rides due to sleep deprivation and headache. I got a seltzer and popped some ibuprofen and walked over to **Euro Mir**. This ride did not really help the headache, but I loved it's weirdness and soundtrack. At this point I began to get really confused by the park layout. I wandered over to Holland looking for some coffee. (I did not like any of the (machine) coffee and espresso I had on my trip.). Since I was closeby, I hopped on **Pirates In Batavia**. Wow, one of my favorite rides in the park, such a joy the whole way through, so much to look at. I then head over to **Atlantica Supersplash** and then **Arthur**, which I was also able to walk right onto with single rider line. I got to do the most of the longer outdoor portion backwards which was a ton of fun. It's a borderline top 5 ride in the park for me neck and neck with Pirates.  
  
From this point I lost track of the order I rode everything in but I got to do the following one time: **Alpenexpress Enzian**, **Ba-a-a Express**, **Schweizer Bobbahn, Poseidon, Pegasus, Castello Dei Medici, Kolumbusjollie, Piccolo Mondo, Snorri Touren, Blue Fire,** and **Wodan (2x)**. I know that I finished off my credit hunt with **Silver Star**. Aside from the big coasters, the highlights for me were Castello Dei Medici and Piccolo Mondo, which I didn't reride but would've re-ridden, both a ton of fun. Pegasus was surprisingly fun but it had a decent wait most of the day so I didn't reride. At this point, it was around 5:30 PM and I was super worn out, so I leisurely hung around for a bit to rebuild some stamina before trying to attempt more rides on Voltron. I figured it would be an easy task considering I walked on earlier in the day. I head over there at around 6:20 expecting multiple rides but only got one, which ended my day right at 7:00 PM closing. I met a really nice couple from Karlsruhe that made the long wait feel a lot quicker.  
  
It was a wild first day and I was super satisfied getting all 14 coaster credits and some dark rides in one day. I slowly walked to my AirBNB in town and downed some Lidl pizza slices and passed out.  
  
Sunday 3/30:  
I finally got some much needed sleep and head to the park for 9:00 AM opening. I was still worn out and had a bit of a headache so I started my day slowly. I locked up my backpack and head right to **Voletarium** which I had missed the day before. It was a fun ride but I prefer traditional dark rides to flying theaters. I got a croissant and coffee at a French cafe and chilled on **Volo Da Vinci**. After waking up a bit more I returned for some rerides on Voltron. The park was considerably more crowded today, so all of my rides were 20ish minute waits for single rider, which is still a treat. I got a front row ride to start my day which really cemented the ride as an overall elite experience and worth the trip alone.  
  
I had a much more chill day overall. I lost track of the order that I went in, but I got 3 additional rides on Wodan, 2 on Blue Fire, 5 on Voltron, and 2 on Silver Star. I also got some rides on Pirates In Batavia, **Madame Freudenreich**, the train, **Sleigh Ride Snowflake**, and **Abenteuer Atlantis.** I drank a few beers in the Bavarian and Badish Beer Garden while a band played. I got a veggie Schnitzel at the Scandanavian restaurant. I overall took my time exploring the park and chilling throughout the day. It was a super inviting and comfortable atmosphere with plenty to see and do all day.  
  
I left at park close at 7:30 PM, picked out one of every flavor in the Lindt shop, and took the bus back to Zurich. I finally got to my AirBNB at around 11:30 PM and walked over to McDonalds to get a bite to eat. I passed out an hour or so later.  
  
Monday 3/31:  
I woke up at 8:00 AM or so and got to the Zurich airport got fly back to PHL, arrived back at 2:00 PM  
  
Some additional ride reflections:  
  
**Voltron** \- My first impression was mixed. I had a decent back row ride and then a *rough* back row ride to start. After getting more rides the 2nd day, including a front row ride, I was able to fully appreciate everything this amazing ride has to offer. I got 8 total rides and luckily loved every ride I had on it after that one rough ride.  
  
I love the initial launch and inversion. The next shining moment for me is the 2nd launch into the stall, which is another really fun rapid transition from forceful positives and punchy launch to excellent hangtime, but it feels different from the first launch and hangtime sequence. The airtime hill right after is also amazing. Then, the whole 2nd half is pure joy to me. The tummy tickling sensation on the backwards spike is really cool and more effective than many other spikes even though it's much shorter. The airtime hill and wave turn after the top hat are probably the two best moments on the ride for me. The wave turn may be my favorite wave turn I've done on any coaster, even more than Gwazi, ArieForce, and TwiCy. The positives on the turn by the main plaza are crazy as well.  
  
I ended up ranking the ride as my #8 overall, above Steel Vengeance and below Voyage.  
  
**Wodan** \- It's a really fun GCI, super smooth, super fast. It has about 10 airtime moments, which are either sustained and mildly floaty or super short and ejector. The speed and variety of elements are where the coaster shines. I got 5 total rides, which was easy since the single rider line was perpetually empty. I wish that the ride were a bit longer, and I wish I got to ride back row, but it's still really fun and my #2 in the park. It's my #4 GCI below Mystic and above Renegade.  
  
**Blue Fire** \- This ride is criminally underrated. The launch kicks ass. The first few elements are super fun, not particularly forceful. I love the hill going into the midcourse. The 2nd half is a ton of fun. There's only one dull moment and it's the one floater-ish hill approaching Wodan. The last inversion is god tier. I almost put it at #2 in the park, but the hour wait I had for it on my 3rd ride was a bit of a bummer, especially compared to Wodan single rider walk ons.  
  
**Silver Star** \- This is a really solid B&M hyper. The ending sequence is a ton of fun between the flojector hill and the twists into the brakes. The first drop is okay, the first valley is super rough, the turnaround is forgettable. I have it as my #6 B&M hyper out of 12 behind Goliath at La Ronde and above Candymonium.  
  
Closing Thoughts:  
I don't know when I'll be back at Europa Park, if ever. This is only the 3rd overseas park that I've been to, the others being PortAventura and Tibidabo. This park may be my overall favorite park that I've been to between their top 5 or 6 coasters, the dark rides, and park environment. It's truly a joy to be there whether you're riding a world class ride or just hanging out. I went solo, but I can only imagine how fun it'd be spending a day there with friends. I feel like 2 days was plenty to do everything that I wanted to do. If I ever return, I'd probably just spend 1 day there unless I were with people that were going for the first time. I would spend a revisit doing exactly what I did on my 2nd day. I'll probably aim to visit some other bucket list European parks before returning, which include Phantasialand, Walibi Belgium, Liseberg, Plopsaland De Panne, Hansa Park, Parc Asterix, and Energylandia.",9,1744427036.0,rollercoasters,0,1.0,False

## For Cafes, Restaurants, and Coffee Shops: Maximizing Efficiency and Durability

Running a commercial coffee operation demands accessories that can withstand heavy use and contribute to a streamlined workflow. Durability, speed, and reliability are paramount. Forget flimsy imitations; invest in accessories built to last.

**Essential Accessories for High-Volume Espresso Production:**

*   **Commercial Espresso Machine Tamper:** A high-quality tamper is non-negotiable.Look for a calibrated tamper that applies consistent pressure, ensuring even extraction and preventing channeling. Consider a tamper with a comfortable ergonomic design for repeated use throughout the day. Why it matters? Consistent tamping pressure dramatically impacts the consistency and quality of your espresso shots.

*   **Portafilter:** Invest in multiple portafilters. this allows baristas to prepare the next shot while one is brewing, significantly increasing efficiency.Consider bottomless portafilters for improved visual feedback on extraction and diagnosing issues. A high-quality portafilter with a comfortable handle is key.

*   **Commercial Milk Frother:** A reliable milk frother is essential for creating latte art and frothy cappuccinos. Consider automatic frothers for consistent foam quality and reduced staff training time. A powerful and easy-to-clean commercial milk frother is a workhorse in any cafe. Don't underestimate the power of a good steam wand tip. Upgrading yours can improve microfoam dramatically.*   **Milk Frothing Pitcher:** Multiple milk frothing pitchers in varying sizes are essential. Choose pitchers made of heavy-gauge stainless steel for optimal temperature control and durability. Ensure they have well-defined spouts for precise pouring. Look into pitchers designed for specific latte art techniques.

*   **Knock Box:** A sturdy and spacious knock box is crucial for quickly and cleanly disposing of spent coffee grounds. Look for a durable, easy-to-clean model with a non-slip base and a replaceable knock bar. This is frequently overlooked but critical for workflow and minimizing mess.

*   **Espresso Grinder:** While technically not an accessory, the espresso grinder works *with* accessories. A top-notch espresso grinder ensures consistent particle size for optimal extraction. Choose a grinder designed for commercial use with adjustable grind settings and a high hopper capacity. A consistent grind means less fiddling with the othre accessories.

*   **Espresso Shot Glasses:** Accurate measurement is critical for consistent espresso. Use graduated espresso shot glasses to ensure precise dosing and monitor extraction volume. A collection of different sizes is recommended to cater to different drink orders.

*   **Espresso Cleaning Brush & Espresso Machine Descaler:** Regular cleaning and descaling are crucial for maintaining the performance and longevity of your espresso machines. Invest in high-quality espresso cleaning brush sets and descaling solutions specifically designed for espresso equipment. Maintaining clean equipment is far more effective than most accessories for achieving good results. Use espresso machine cleaner daily.

*   **Backflush Detergent:** Regular backflushing with a specialized detergent removes coffee oils and residue from the group head, preventing clogs and ensuring optimal flavor extraction.Implement a daily backflushing schedule.

**Optimizing Workflow and Reducing Downtime:**

*   Implement a strict cleaning schedule for all espresso machine accessories.
*   Train staff on proper usage and maintenance procedures.
*   stock spare parts to minimize downtime in case of repairs.
*   Consider investing in accessories that can automate or streamline tasks.

I have eaten at this restaurant (even the same meal multiple times, minus the diet coke) with no issue multiple times, it's a really popular spot downtown and have never heard of anyone getting ill from it. in an hour i ate about half of my salad with half of the dressing and chicken - I also finished the entire diet coke. it's worth mentioning that this was my first time ever drinking diet coke - I don't drink soda, let alone diet soda, but one of my friends got one and it looked refreshing so I gave it a try bc I know a lot of people love it. about 30 minutes after finishing it, I started to get stomach cramps. I tried to brush them off and figured it may just have been because I had a tough workout later and hadn't eaten a lot during the day. after about 10 minutes, I realized they were in fact diarrhea cramps and I immediately had to run to the bathroom. **TMI incoming**: in the bathroom I had explosive liquid d*, it was disgusting and uncontrollable. I texted my bf that we needed to leave immediately, so we left as soon as I finished in the bathroom. the ride home was really rough (20 min), but I made it home and then had another episode of the same. I don't feel n* or sick overall - no fever or headache or anything. however, my lower stomach still feels really unsettled and I could possibly have d* again.

I know no one can tell me whether this is an illness, so I've kind of resigned myself to that. however, has anyone else ever had this kind of reaction to diet coke? I'm trying to figure out alternative explanations other than FP, illness, etc. it's probably worth mentioning that I also *never* drink caffeine (at all - no coffees, sodas, energy drinks, etc), in addition to avoiding artificial sugars like aspartame. I felt fine today aside from having a low appetite. this really did just come out of nowhere - I wasn't anxious or anything either. ",1,1744426810.0,emetophobia,5,1.0,False

1jx7h2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/FATTravel/comments/1jx7h2y/review_four_seasons_houston/,Review: Four Seasons - Houston,"Where we went: Four Seasons Houston

When we went: April 4-6

Who went: Me, wife and 16 month old son

We booked this room through our TA, /u/shermancchen so shout out to Sherman because he and the FS team really elevated our experience from what could have been a pretty standard weekend stay in a city hotel in to something a bit more memorable. It was my wife's birthday and the staff went above and beyond to cater to her. They had given notes to the restaurant and front desk staff of her birthday and she was given small gifts, free food, greetings, etc all through our stay.

I personally also think this sub needs more review of continental North American hotels and I have a lot of short weekend trips coming up so I'll be dropping reviews of my stays because you know, not all of us want or need to go to exotic international resorts all the time ;P

Location: 0/10

Downtown Houston is trash. I'm sorry but if in the future, I don't have to be in Downtown, I'm not staying in Downtown. The rooms at the FS Houston are great, the lobby is pretty, the food is good but the location honestly trumps all of that. The second you step outside of the hotel, it just feels sad and depressing. Theres nobody on the streets on the weekend, everything is either closed or dead empty and there are just so many empty parking lots everywhere. 

If they picked up this hotel and teleported it to a better location in Houston, I'd probably return.

Rooms: 9/10

We booked the Execuite Suite and were upgraded at check in to the Premium Execuite Suite, which was nice (thanks Sherman!).

I had asked Sherman to arrange a small little surprise in the room on check in and we had settled on a small cake and balloons to be in the room for check in. The hotel said they'd do it for free, which was nice but when we get into the room, not only did they have a small cake and balloons, but they also had fresh flowers and a bottle of champagne, which was a *very* nice surprise. 

We also have a baby so all the standard baby supplies were ready, like a diaper genie, crib, high chair and they even gave us a cloth bib for my son with some FS branding. We bring his milk with us and we had planned on just using the minibar in the room but unfortunately in this hotel, the minibar has pressure sensors for the drinks so we couldn't use it.

I use the app (which btw is fucking brilliant and I'll get into that a little later) to request someone to come and empty the fridge so we can put our milk in it. Instead of doing that, the staff brought us a minifridge, which was a decent size. It had a fridge section and a freezer section so it wasn't just another minibar.


Service: 10/10

Flawless. The first word that comes to mind is literally flawless. 

From the birthday surprise, the minifridge to the free birthday gifts and cakes at breakfast, they really went above and beyond when we were just staying there for 2 nights.

The thing that pushed this rating into a 10/10 is we had a late night flight into Houston and we were going to land around 11 PM at night. While on the plane, I downloaded the FS app on my phone around 8 PM mid flight and I used it to request that dinner be warm and in our room at check in when we arrived at the hotel at like 11:30 PM.

Their room service ends at around 10 I think so I wasn't sure if they were going to be able to do that but some how they did and they had a a full dinner that I ordered on the plane, ready for us in the room when we walked in. 

I don't know if you ever had one of those ""holy shit I'm living in the future"" moments, but that was one of those moments for me. It would be unthinkable even 10 years ago to be able to order dinner at the hotel you were arriving at in 2 hours while on the plane and having that food fresh and warm for you at check in, an hour after their kitchen had closed at the hotel. 

Food & Bev: 8/10

So because of the FSPP perks, we had a $200 food credit so I used the fuck out of it for room service. The Tex-Mex food they had was great. As for the perk, it excludes taxes, tip and alcohol so we actually had like $60 left over at check out so we used that to get some more food at their coffee shop to go for our flight home. It was great.

Extras/activities/Amenities: 6/10

The hotel has a spa, pool, gym, bar, restaurant, house car and a purse rental service. For a city hotel, the ""extras"" are pretty nice. Maybe the purse rental service is a gimmick but my wife used the fuck out of it but that's why I'll give it at least a 6.

The pool deck is honestly in a sad state and I was actually shocked when I saw it. Its extremely outdated, very small and barely decorated. And their ""Cabana Rooms"", which have direct access to the pool deck and are advertised as being a little special because of that direct access are actually in a sad state. Each room that connects to the pool deck has an awning and when I went there, at least half of the awnings were missing. Like it was just a wire frame. And the lounge chairs were just kind of haphazardly laid out with no real direction or vision for decoration. And everything was brick and concrete. And whatever greenery they had was either dead, dying or so small that you really didn't notice it.

For a 5 star hotel and being a Four Seasons, stepping out onto the pool deck and seeing the sad state it was in, kind of made me feel like I was in a Motel 6. Safe to say, we didn't use the pool deck at all.

We had breakfast at Toro Toro and it was great. Because we booked with Sherman, we got the ""free"" breakfast perk but when I checked in, I was told it was actually an $80 credit, rather than fully included breakfast. That would be fine normally but when each entree at Toro Toro for breakfast is $35 and the appetizers are $15 and the coffee is like almost $10, between me, my wife, and son, our breakfast came out to be like $150 so....""free"" turned into a 50% discount. Maybe its on me for not reading the fine print or whatever but it just left a bad taste in my mouth because everyone says ""complimentary breakfast"", but it really isn't. 

If its complimentary, its complimentary. If its a credit, its a credit. The hotel just needs to be up front about what I am receiving. You shouldn't say its complimentary but then when I check in, tell me its just a credit. 

Maybe I'm off base but in my book, thats not right.

She didn’t yell. She didn’t say anything. She simply walked out.

The rest of the day, I could barely function. My mind was spinning. Shame, fear, regret. I was sure everything between us had changed.

But the next morning, she knocked on my door. Quietly. Calmly. She had a small bag in her hand some makeup, a cute outfit, a soft smile. No long talks, no judgment. Just quiet acceptance.

She helped me get ready. Gave me tips. Fixed my eyeliner. Picked out a pastel top and a pair of skinny jeans that actually fit my shape. And then we went out shopping, coffee, trying on clothes, laughing like nothing had ever been wrong.

Anyway the god parents will be his brother and his brother’s wife. So we offered them to stay in our only available bedroom for guests. 
The issue is my parents in law will fly in as well since they are so excited for this event…and maybe my husband’s another brother too. 
We really don’t have a huge house. With the only guest room ioffered to the god parents, the other 3 persons will have to share the living room. Our sectional couch can take one. I really don’t know where my parents in law will stay then…..on the floor? Fine, but we don’t have extra mattress. Plus we do have air mattress but we also have several cats and they had a history of popping an air mattress to flat. 

Besides the sleeping issue, it’s very stressful to think of cooking for them for several days in a row, they all have their own food restrictions.m, even for coffee. And plus there is no way we can transport all of them to everywhere in our car unless they have their own ride to tour the area. Also will guests do laundry in this kind of family visit? I don’t mind them using our laundry room but with 5, I think our machines may run 24 hours considering I also need to wash our own clothes plus the baby clothes.

A little background: my parents in law are not easy going, they are extremely weird with eating normal food, very alert in spending money. But they will not be happy if they don’t get to stay under the same roof with the baby ….

How should I do this and what should I expect?
I know they will be offended by being asked to find their own hotel, so I caved and aligned with my husband that they can all stay here but for respect, the only available room should be given to the godparents who must be present. 

1. We plan to arrange my parents in law to sleep on the floor but we do not have a proper mattress. What should we do?

My 5 years car free were in a central neighborhood in SF and 5 years with a car in a walkable (relatively speaking but not really compared to SF) neighborhood of LA. 

* living car free became a lot less fun after interest rates went up. It used to be cheap to Uber everywhere and get food delivered when those apps were subsidized by VC money
* renting a car sucks. Car rental agencies inside the city close super early. App based car rentals are hit or miss. One time an owner accused me of damage I didn’t do and it became a huge headache. 
* I hike more and stopped drinking after owning a car 
* there’s a lot of stuff that the city proper doesn’t have that becomes frustratingly difficult to access. underground punk shows in the east bay, friends in the South Bay, hikes in Marin. Certain food is better in the suburbs because the city only has the gentrified version.
* I’m much less spontaneous when driving. Walkability is amazing for just setting out and seeing where the day takes you. 
* getting errands done is easier. I can buy things in bulk. I can go to the specific store that I want instead of one that is convenient. 
* you can’t have it both ways. A city can be easy to drive or easy to walk but not both. 
* parks are an important part of a walkable city. In a car city people tend to just chill in the cars. This gives a great energy to parks that tends to be missing from a car city.

The house was quiet. Too quiet, the kind where you can hear your own blood moving. The bed still smelled like her. Her pillow still had the shape of her head. I kept brushing my teeth and expecting her to call out from the bedroom, like she always did.
***“You left the light on again, babe.”***

But she was gone. Left in a rush. Said she needed time. That was the last text I got. I didn’t reply. Not because I didn’t want to—I just… didn’t know what to say.

The first night I saw it, I thought I was losing it. It was around 2 a.m. I’d gotten up to take a piss, wandered into the kitchen for water, and looked out the back window. Something—someone—was standing at the edge of the garden. By the hedge.

Still. No phone. No cigarette. Just… standing.

I blinked and it was gone.

Didn’t sleep much after that.

••

Night two, same time. I saw her again.

Her. That’s what made my stomach twist. She looked like El. Or enough like her in the dark. That hoodie she always wore. Legs slightly bowed in that same way. Hair up in a messy bun.

But it wasn’t her.

She didn’t move. Not even to shift her weight. Just stood there under the motion light, hands dangling at her sides like they didn’t belong to her.

I didn’t go outside. Just turned off the tap and sat on the kitchen floor until sunrise.

••

By night three, I stopped pretending it wasn’t happening. I made coffee at 11 p.m. and sat in the living room, lights off, watching the garden through the curtains. I was tired but sharp—waiting. The air felt… thick. Heavy.

Then she was there.

Under the light again.

I pressed my forehead to the cold glass. Took her in properly.

It looked like El, yeah. From a distance. But her body was wrong. Her shoulders sat too high. Her arms hung stiff, not relaxed. Her hands opened and closed like she was rehearsing the motion. The hoodie looked too tight in some places, too loose in others—like she was trying to wear something meant for someone else.

And she wasn’t breathing. At all.

I dropped my coffee mug. The sound made her tilt her head—not fast, not startled. Just slow and off-kilter, like a puppet responding to the wrong cue.

Then she turned and walked away.

That walk—Jesus.

She didn’t bend her knees right. Her steps were short, dragging. Her arms didn’t swing. It was like she’d watched videos of people walking and was doing her best to copy it, but hadn’t quite figured out how the joints were supposed to work.

I didn’t sleep that night.

Didn’t eat the next day.

••

By night five, I’d set up a motion camera and floodlight out back. Something to prove to myself I wasn’t just losing my mind. I watched the camera feed live on my laptop.

3:17 a.m.—***ping.***

She was right there. Inches from the lens.

The floodlight blew out her features, but I could see her eyes—too round, too wide. And her mouth. Slightly open. Like she was in mid-sentence but didn’t know the words.

I rewound the footage and watched her walk up to the camera frame by frame. Her movements were stiff, mechanical. At one point, she lifted her arm and bent it the wrong way. Her elbow popped out sideways, like she forgot which direction it was supposed to go.

I almost called the police. Almost.

But what would I say? **“My ex is in my garden and her elbow bends backward now?”**

••

Night six, I cracked. I went to the window and shouted. **“What do you want?!”**

She didn’t answer. Didn’t flinch. Just stared.

The next night, she spoke.

I was upstairs, brushing my teeth. I glanced out the bathroom window and froze.

She was in the driveway this time. Closer.

She opened her mouth too slow. Like unzipping something wet. Her lips stretched far—too far—and the sound came out after the motion. Like it wasn’t connected to her body.

***“Jaaaaay…meeee.”***

Flat. No tone. Just the sound of my name dropped into the air like a piece of meat.

Her tongue moved like it was being pulled by string. Her jaw hung open too long, then snapped shut with a little click.

And her voice—

It was close to El’s. But too tight. Too deep in her chest. Like it was being squeezed through someone else’s throat. Like she’d only recently figured out how to make noise at all.

Then she smiled. Too wide. Like she was proud.

Then came the words.

***“I… miss… our… pasta nights.”***

I dropped my toothbrush.

El used to say that. After bad days. It was her code for let’s cook something stupid and fall asleep to horror movies on the couch.

But this wasn’t her. This thing was parroting something it had no right to know.

It was like it had access to something it shouldn’t. Her words. Her tone. But only the surface—like an actor who’d memorised the lines without knowing what they meant.

I duct-taped the windows after that.

But it didn’t stop.

I heard her walking on the patio. Her footsteps were slow, uneven. Sometimes she’d stop mid-step. Then shuffle again, like she was still figuring it out.

She knocked once.

Just once.

Always around the same time—3:10, 3:20 a.m.

Never tried the door. Never broke a window. Never forced anything.

It was like she was waiting.

For me to let her in.

••

By night ten, I stopped looking. Stopped eating. I kept the lights on and sat with my back against the kitchen cupboards, knife in my hand, whole body buzzing.

She didn’t come that night.

Which was worse.

Because on night eleven, I woke up to breathing.

Not mine.

It was coming from the other side of my bedroom door.

Slow. Wet. Just close enough for the sound to slip under the frame.

I sat up in bed. Held my breath.

The doorknob shifted. Clicked.

I didn’t move.

Didn’t make a sound.

The breathing stopped.

Then a voice: **“Jamie. I came in.”***

It was her voice. Flat. Slow. Like she was figuring it out as she went.

But the door never opened.

Eventually I found the courage to flip the bedside light. Nothing. No shadow under the door. No footsteps retreating.

I crept to the hallway, knees shaking. The front door downstairs was wide open. The hallway rug had a streak of mud across it. No prints. Just mud. Dragged in like something was pulled.

I stayed awake until dawn. Every creak in the house made my spine lock up.

••

When morning came, I walked outside, half-expecting to find her standing there. I didn’t.

But my hoodie—El’s hoodie—was lying in the grass.

It was inside out.

And wet.

I don’t know how long I’ve been awake now. Three days? Four?

She hasn’t come back. Not yet. But I know she will. She’s watching. Waiting. Just outside the places I let myself look.

I can hear her walking sometimes.

Practicing.

**Viewable memory carrier: Trel'Ayn, the inferior ambassador of the Telrani race.**

***Date \[standardized human time\]: May 31, 2209***

***Location: planet Trelwan, Federation military training camp.***

  
It's a failure. A complete failure!

Not only did we lose with as many casualties as possible, and some warriors are now being rehabilitated from the psychological trauma inflicted, but the humans' comissar made a report that the eskin directing the battle and all the laws of physics in the simulation 'did not match reality'. And then he also condescendingly said that we could not know how the thermobaric missiles work, that they are designed to destroy fortifications and infantry, not the mechs. Now almost all infantry are afraid of the roar of human mechs and their missiles.

And I also didn't sleep tonight...that's what it took to exactly thrill me was a group of soldiers putting on masks with some intimidating creatures on them, only to play up the nature of the defenders.

I can still see those bronze fangs in the dark and the mocking eyes of the humans behind the masks.

Okay, I'll finish the reports, send them to my superiors via long-range transponder from orbit and I can sleep. Just another ten hours and then I can sleep.

There was a knock on the door and I opened its locks, only after all this time bothering to raise my eyes and look at the person who entered. My heart was racing, my breathing hitched, and I almost jumped up and down against the far wall. The antennae stirred, speaking danger to everyone around him and buzzing strangely, and his ears pressed against his head as if they weren't even there.

Mask, mask, mask...

“Hey! Hey! It's okay, it's me, Anton!” came a familiar voice and the man who had come in took off his mask. 

Only now I noticed that it was the most ordinary one, there were no fangs on it, it wasn't even made of bronze. Damn nature, what are you doing to me? Weird, I should have been more scared at the sight of this man, but without the mask, he evoked a kind of calm or even uplifted mood.

“I'm sorry,” I said, calming down a little. “Have a seat, I'll stir the drinks.”

“I brought mine,” the comissar said slowly approaching the table. “If you like warm drinks, of course.”

I overpowered myself and looked into the predator's eyes. There was no malice in them, not even the same fire that frightened every one of my subordinates. Rather, I saw concern, a slight fear, even sadness. Is he afraid of scaring me? Not because I'm ambassador of the Telrani race, or I wouldn't have seen such sadness. What kind of creatures are you humans?

“I apologize for my subordinates, I didn't know they would decide to scare you so badly. They will immediately be reprimanded for their AWOL behavior.”

Anton carefully placed two low mugs without handles on the table, the same ones we'd been drinking from the other day. It was nice of him, because he could have just gotten deep human mugs and I would have had to get my face inside them just to drink.

“Don't be, I'm hardly scared at all, it's just that I've been up all night with these reports and so I'm on edge.” I lied almost successfully and began to wait for that very ‘my drink’ of my mate's.

“So lie down for a couple hours and then go fill it all out afterward.” The man shrugged. “Those echoes of bureaucracy aren't worth your health.”

Almost immediately, the man pulled something like an iron cylinder with rounded edges from behind his back, unscrewed part of it, and began pouring out...hot black water? It doesn't matter, it's unlikely he's trying to poison me. Immediately after my drink he diluted it with plain water from the decanter from my table, and took his own at once. His drink was steaming, did they really care that much about the temperature?

“Wait...you can do that?” 

I took the cup in my hands and began gently tasting the drink with my tongue. The warmth of it spread through my body, the sweetness of it, the slightly tart flavor of it was good for me - it was invigorating.  

“You mean sleep for a certain amount of time and wake up afterward? Well yeah, don't you?” wondered my buddy.

“No one in the galaxy can do that! And even if they did, the council doesn't know about it!”

“Well, what can you do?” shrugged the officer. “Humanity's been in contact with the council for a year and for most of that time we've been trying to convince you that we're not going to eat all the herbivores. I'm sure every predator that's come to you has been through something like that.”

“What a strange race you humans are.” I sipped my drink again, clearly unable to marvel at it more. “And what was that you poured me? It's like it's invigorating me.”

“Tea. This tea is black, and you used to pour us instant green tea, remember? And it wakes you up because it contains caffeine, but there's so little of it that you'd rather go back to sleep”. 

“Caffeine? How awful.” shrugged I shivered. “And how often do you drink it?”

“It's not that much, 47 milligrams per cup, tops. And sometimes I drink coffee when I need to wake up quickly, it's usually more than that.”

“My dear friend, we have enough for 200 milligrams to replace the martial stimulant. But it lasts about five minutes and we're out of it for about ten hours. Be careful with that.”

“Oh...I'll be careful with that.” the man immediately put his cylinder back in his pocket behind his back. “I'll make an announcement about it tonight.”

“Okay. Now let's get down to business, my friend.”

We started discussing his report and I even took notes on my personal computer, but a minute or two passed and I started noticing more and more often that I couldn't remember the words they said and my notes were filled with sticky characters stretching halfway down the page.

“You need to go to bed.” Anton said suddenly, clearly noticing these kinds of memory lapses. “The caffeine is keeping you up all the way, but I'll bet you ten bucks that if you lie down, you'll fall asleep.”

“No, I'm fine, I-”

“Sleep.” the man said more threateningly. “I'll bite you.”

I couldn't tell if it was a joke or not, but I decided to listen to my colleague and started to get up from my chair, but immediately fell back down.

The man only shook his head and walked over to my chair, lifting me in his arms as lightly as if I were fluff. Why was I able to let him lift me up so easily? All my instincts were silent, not even a tremor in my body.

Anton took my hand affectionately and kissed my knuckles again, as if apologizing for doing this to me without my permission.

“You need to rest,” he remarked more quietly, carrying me over to the bed. “Your nose is already red, you must be sick, sleep will help.”

“What? Red nose?” was all I had time to ask before I was placed on the bed.

“Get some rest, Trel'Ayn. We'll talk tomorrow.” the comissar suddenly spoke in my native tongue and with a slight smile, showing his fangs, on his face left the room.

A wave of shivers and warmth ran through my body, and I couldn't take my eyes off the door he'd come out of.

“Goddamn softy."" I whispered, rubbing my red nose before falling asleep.

**Viewable memory carrier: Ty'Lorin, female warrior of the fifteenth battalion of the Telrani race army.**

***Date \[standardized human time\]: May 31, 2209***

***Location: planet Trelwan, Federation military training camp.***

  
Damn softy! I had just finished filling out all the paperwork when I got a message on my PDA that I needed to spend time with him to exchange traditions and stuff.

And the ambassador isn't answering either. What kind of day is this?

Even though I had sat behind the turrets all through the last simulation training, I was still intimidated by the way they fought us. They weren't afraid to sacrifice equipment and their infantry just to get the job done. Not only that, but those bastards tricked us and flew over the wall, distracting our main forces! If it wasn't for that trick, we would have defeated them!

Well, you can't undo what you've done. Gotta hurry so I don't talk to this idiot for more than the allotted time on my one day off a year.

Suddenly, my friend rushed past me at what felt like the speed of light, followed by three predators at once. I thought they were showing their true colors,  I even reached for my gun, but one of the softy suddenly yelled.

“Catch her! Catch her! She drank a cup of coffee with four hundred milligrams of caffeine in it! She could hurt herself!”

Well, that sounds like a friend of mine. Rai'Nor does something without thinking and then reaps the consequences, and it's strange that our race doesn't run after her too.

In any case, I decided to leave quickly so I wouldn't have to watch this rather scary action.

I reached my room rather quickly, where Curie was already waiting for me. I had to learn his name so I could restrain myself from calling that predator slurs. I thought I'd weaned myself off swearing by now, but no, there would be a fool who would surely make me do it again.

The man was sitting there reading some book on PDA that my visor translated as “451 degrees Fahrenheit.”

“451 degrees? I only know about celsius and kelvins, what happens at that temperature?” suddenly to myself I asked.

The Predator raised his eyes, looked me over obviously through his black glasses, and closed the book.

“The temperature at which paper burns.” He suddenly explained calmly. “I'll let you read it later if you want. You've got an exine that can translate the text of the book into your language anyway.”

Why is he so calm? Did he quench his bloodlust in the simulation or did he just sleep it off?

“I wouldn't mind reading.” I decided not to be a nuisance, either, and sat down on my bed, across from softy. “Have you thought about what you're going to share today?”

“Do you want something scary or something calm?” the man grinned with obvious pleasure in his voice.

“What's stopping you from showing both?” holding back irritation I asked. “And take off those damn glasses, they're disgusting to look at.”

The man shrugged and removed his glasses, placing them on a table extended from the wall.

I'd never seen such a piercing stare. I was familiar with many of the creatures' gazes, and I'd even seen predators a couple times, but here I could barely keep myself from running. He was staring at me as if it were a foregone conclusion, as if I were no longer alive.

“Antennas twitch when they're scared,” grinned the man, grinning with his fangs. “We'll remember that.”

“You asshole!” I couldn't stand it, grabbing my antennae. “You didn't have to say that out loud!”

“Okay, okay, we'll forget it. ok?.” The man suddenly handed me a datapad, which apparently had the information he wanted to share with me. “Let's start with the easy part. Open the file titled 'Aspects of Evolution and the Fear Response'.”

For about an hour he showed me what humans looked like millions of years ago, how they evolved and touched on the specifics of how they feel fear. As it turned out, they weren't so fearless, it was just that the people on our base were a little worn out from life and felt little fear. It was fun to see a man or woman of the human race afraid of rodents and other small creatures, or even faint from fear of heights.

“And also...well...I've prepared a video for you on another topic and just so you don't freak out, I'm going to go get something to drink in the cafeteria. Watch it for yourself.”

The softy rose from his seat, put on his glasses, and headed away from the room.

“So what's the big deal?” I asked the void with a chuckle in my voice, but my gut immediately clenched when I saw the name of the file.

'Why humans are called predators.'

This video was obviously prepared by Earth scientists, as the past was a pasting of stuff, and here everything was and edited well and different diagrams, but the content itself....

Humans began to hunt of their own free will, and evolution helped them to do it. 

They didn't have enough organic food from trees, and they couldn't digest plants, so they started hunting.

They invented tools, started hunting together, using tactics that other predators had never done. But the problem isn't even that, it's what were the most popular tactics.

  
If they could not keep up with the victim, they chased the victim so long that he fell down from fatigue and was left only to finish him off.

Damn it, they even hunted other predators, also for fun, for positive emotions, for entertainment!

When the datapad showed a picture of people standing around with kinetic weapons and taking pictures in front of a dead predator that was twice as big and covered in brown fur, all my instincts kicked in.

Those cheerful smiles, those happy eyes. Do they really enjoy these atrocities so much?

“Humans are forced to eat meat to be healthy, as they have a lot of nutrients for our body.” broadcast one of the their scientists. “However, if we continued to hunt, we would simply exterminate all the wildlife on the planet, so we domesticated some species and in return for caring for them, after taking their meat, bones and other things that are good for us.”

The antennas that had been swaying in fear up to that point suddenly stood up stakes, and I couldn't look away from the screen at all from shock.

“They're raising herbivores for slaughter...” only escaped my throat before tears flowed down my cheeks.

“However, we don't treat animals only as food sources.” he suddenly stated. “Many keep them around as companions or even friends. Even some predators have been domesticated by us.”

I didn't even have time to say anything before videos of people happily playing with some furry predators, feeding and stroking horned creatures that happily eat dried grass from their hands, saving small animals from a forest fire.

“The most important thing that distinguishes us from many predators is empathy. Humans are such creatures that our instincts are dulled by our own intelligence, and so even if we were to starve to death, many of us would rather accept death than eat our semi-intelligent companion, much less a creature that has a mind similar to ours in its head. Even many of our nations' religions are based on the tenets of 'thou shalt not kill' and 'love your neighbor as you might love yourself.' ”

The datapad showed videos suddenly showed people in cage-like rooms.

“Many countries before the confederacy even abolished the death penalty because they realized that a person could be innocent and their life could never be taken back.”

Suddenly Curie himself appeared on the screen, he was dressed in his dress uniform and looked even kinder than I had seen today.

“Dear non-humans,” he began. “With this video we wanted to show you that mankind are not blood thirsty monsters that want to eat you. We've made a lot of mistakes in the past, we probably will in the future, but, we will make them as your friends, not your enemies. We are offended and sad when you look at us and see only predators, when you put us on the same level with those who would not hesitate to kill you for food. We don't want that. We want to be friends and coexist, please, remember that and for once in your life look your human in the eyes without fear and hatred.”

The video ended on a shot that included a photo of a human soldier handing a soft toy to a crying child and the caption 'Man first encountered alien life on Caporen 4 when one country's space fleet interceded for the civilians of the world. Ten months later, humans were already members of the Galactic Federation.'

I was left with mixed feelings after the video. These softy's are as controversial as they are weird. I can't believe that...that there are creatures that started eating meat just to survive.

My breathing gradually calmed down and the trembling in my body went away. My heart began to beat calmly.

I rested the datapad on the bed and ran out of the room. I had to find Curie. I needed to find him, to scold him first for all the stress of the video, and then to apologize to my human.

1jx71jh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jx71jh,Trip Report,"One week: Seoul and Sokcho (first Korea visit)

Focus: hiking, food, tours

I loved reading other people's trip reports and found it helpful for planning our trip so I thought I'd through our experience in. 

Day One: Arrived in Seoul-stayed in Myeongdong. We went to Myeongdong Kyo Ja for dinner, we would highly recommend, we had a chicken broth soup and a tray of dumplings. You will line up to order, once you reach the server they will ask you to pick the items you would like, there are about four menu options. Pick what you'd like and pay in advance. They are very quick about rotating people through the restaurant so the line will go fast. 

Day  Two: A very long day, we hit up Seoul Tower, Gyeongbokgung Palace/Folk Museum, Bukchon Hanok Village, and Namdaemun Market. We also tried Myeongdong Croquettes, a cute little bakery with great croquettes, try the red bean one. 

Day Three: DMZ tour-we booked through Klook and it was worth it as we hadn't been to Korea before. On the tour we got to try soybean icecream, we enjoyed it a lot more than we thought we would. It almost has a peanut butter-esqe flavor. We also walked through Myeongdong Night Market. We preferred Namdaemun over Myeongdong. Myeongdong was very busy and it was hard to look at each stall. Namdaemun also has clothing, jewelry, kitchenware, etc. so you can look through that between bites of hotteok and tteokbokki. 

Day Four: Trip to Sokcho, we caught the express bus from Seoul. We caught the local bus Seoraksan National Park and hiked to Biryong falls/observatory. We ended up doing the hike quite late, but that worked out for us because we were some of the last people leaving the park. We spotted a raccoon-dog just as we were leaving (this is a huge win for us, we wanted to see one while hiking in Japan and few years back but couldn't find any). We also tried marinated crab. I'm not sure if it was because it was the off season but restaurants were closing up around 8pm, so plan accordingly, Naver and google maps didn't always have accurate hours for places. 

Day Five: Back to Seoraksan, we hiked Ulsanbawi Rock-be prepared for stairs! Afterwards we went to the fish market, you'll see locals wandering around with white boxes of chicken-follow them! Other stalls will try to distract you with other chicken, don't give in, you need to try the original. There are two stalls at the market, they are white with a red chicken head logo-it's called Mansuk Dak Gangjeong. Try their fried chicken, they will hand you a box, it will be cold but don't be alarmed, it is fantastic. The sauce has a bit of spice with some peppers but is also sweet and sour. 

Day Six: Back to Seoul. Before we left Sokcho we stopped at Chungchodam for coffee. We had a phenomenal sesame latte. The cafe is very trendy and the latte was great, highly recommend. We did a pub crawl through Hongdae, we booked it through Klook. This was not exactly what we expected, the bars we went to were clearly set aside for tourists and didn't give an authentic experience. The plus side was meeting some other lovely folks who were travelling and sharing some tips. The downside hit us the next morning; soju will give you one hell of a hangover. 

Day Seven: It was a rainy day so we tried to find indoor activities. We went to the war and women's rights museum, it was interesting to learn more about the comfort women system. We also went to Lotte mall and got a new pair of glasses + free eye exam from Davich Opitical. We also wandered around Lotte world and checked out the cherry blossoms. Luckily our lovely hotel host gave us umbrellas or this day would have been a bit of a wash. 

Day Eight: We walked through Hongdae shopping street. I like to collect cute art/earrings from different places we travel to. We went to Object and found a few post cards and stickers. Then we caught our flight home!


Overall it was a fun trip, probably too brief to fully experience Korea but we enjoyed our time. If you are planning to go, download Naver and Papago beforehand as google isn't totally reliable there. ",26,1744424709.0,koreatravel,2,1.0,False

**Crosses to Bear**

The golden morning sunlight eased its way into my eyesight, coaxing me back to the land of the living. Blinking the sleep from my eyes, a pounding headache greeted me; last night's escapades, clearly taking effect. I looked downward, to see Chris still asleep. He groaned softly as he rolled over onto his side. I stood to stretch my legs and find some water but noticed a blanket draped over the bench seats that I hadn't seen before. I grabbed the blanket and gently placed it on Chris before walking over to the breakfast buffet in the center of the room. I stood in a line that was formed, flanked by two men and a young woman. I reached the front of the line and grabbed a bottle of water, a cup of black, aromatic espresso, and a blueberry muffin. Everything smelt delicious despite my growing nausea.

""Can you hand me a fork?"" The young woman behind me asked. She was thin as a rail and had jet-black hair that caught the sunlight, causing it to shimmer. I handed her the utensil and she thanked me. ""Rough night?"" she asked. 

""You could say that,"" I answered with a forced smirk.

""I saw you and that other guy come in late last night. The g-men force you back here too?""

""G-men?"" I asked.

""The staff."" She replied. I remembered last night, the ominous warning the bartender gave Chris and I, echoed in the back of my mind.

""Uh, yeah. Chris had a little too much to drink last night and caused a bit of a scene. I kinda got roped into it."" I answered matter-of-factly.

""Yeah, they don't take too kindly to anything but partying up there."" She said, a forlorn look in her eye. ""I'm Misty Guillard, by the way."" The young woman said, offering her hand to shake.

""Nice to meet you, Misty, I'm...""

""Oh, hey Newbie, you're awake. Save any coffee for me?"" Chris interrupted. ""Oh, hi there, I'm Chris. Pleasure to meet you. Chris shook her hand.

""Good to meet you too Chris. Your friend here was just explaining how the two of you ended up back here.""

""Oh, that whole ordeal was a load of shit,"" Chris answered flippantly. ""I got a little inebriated and divulged a bit too much of my past. My eyes started to sweat a little and that, I guess, is a major no-no up there in party land."" He said, with a wave of his hand.

 I looked over at him with a knowing glance. He was downplaying the whole ordeal, either not remembering or purposefully leaving out how much of a gibbering mess he was. ""But hey, don't mind me, I'm gonna go get me some breakfast and mingle a bit."" He said, with a grin, and turned his heels toward the back of the line. Misty and I grabbed our breakfasts and sat together at the nearest unoccupied bench.

""Your friend seems..."" she trailed off

""Helpless?"" I answered.

""I was going to say eccentric."" She said with a giggle. ""Have you known each other long?"" 

""We met yesterday, and he's already getting me in trouble,"" I stated, a tinge of resentment apparent in my voice. ""I haven't been on this bus for twenty-four hours, and I've already been threatened by security. What about you, when did you get here?"" 

""Oh, I uh, I don't really know how long I've been here."" She said, looking intently at the floor. ""Could be weeks, maybe months."" She said, under her breath. I got the feeling it wasn't something she wanted to talk about, so I changed the subject.

""So, where are you from?"" I asked, hoping to steer the conversation toward a more mundane topic.

""I was born in Toulouse, France, but moved to Nashville when I was eight. My dad got a job in the States that paid much better than his previous job, so we relocated to Tennessee.""

""That must have been a culture shock,"" I answered, sipping my coffee.

""Not for me, I was so young I remember very little of France. I don't even have much of an accent."" She said, staring out the window. 

""It still must have been hard, did you leave behind any family, any friends?"" I asked. Her face turned pale, as if all of the blood in her body turned to ice, all at once.

""No...no friends."" She muttered. Again, despite myself, it seems I struck a nerve.

""I hope I didn't poke into a sore subject,"" I said, apologetically. I was met only with silence. It dragged on for what felt like an eternity. I was about to say something else when Misty said,

""I don't deserve friends."" She grabbed her dirty dishes and walked away. I sat there stumped. Was it something I said? What did she mean by not deserving friends?

As I sat there, in contemplation, the pianist in the background played a jazzy tune. Everything was rather peaceful until Chris walked up to me with two lit cigars.

""Oh, great,"" I thought to myself.

""Hey, Newbie. I brought an apology gift. The staff were handing these out, so I grabbed one for each of us. I guess it's my way of saying sorry for how last night...you know. He said, trailing off.

I wasn't really up for smoking. I'm not much of a fan of cigars, but with the apologetic eyes Chris was giving me, I couldn't say no.

""Thanks,"" I said, apprehensively reaching for the stogie. He plopped down next to me and inhaled deeply.

""This sure is the life. Not a care in the world, just two friends relaxing, smoking some of the finest Cuba has to offer."" He said, a wide grin forming from ear to ear. 

While he prattled on and on about the finer things in life, I was scanning the room, my eyes searched for Misty through the crowd. I finally spotted her, sitting alone in a corner, her face buried in her hands, seemingly crying.

"".....and that's why I only eat grass-fed beef, am I right Newbie?"" I stood, ignoring Chris' inane babble, and cut through the crowd where Misty was sitting. I gently placed my hand on her shoulder, in an attempt to comfort her. She jerked away, in a startle, and looked up at me, her eyes red and puffy from tears.

""I'm sorry if I upset you. That wasn't my intention. But if you want to talk, I'm a good listener."" I said, softly.

""Why do you care?"" She asked incredulously. ""Everyone on this bus is here for one reason or another, and I'm no different. I'm sure you have your reasons, and you don't see me bothering you about it!"" She was clearly, very upset, and her tone mirrored the tumult of emotions she was facing. She sniffled and wiped tears from her cheeks before speaking again. ""I'm sorry. I shouldn't have snapped at you. You're only trying to help. I guess I'm just going through a lot lately.""

""Do you want to talk about it?"" I asked, taking my seat next to her. She sat in silence for a moment, gathering her thoughts.

""I guess, I'll start from the beginning. When I first moved to the US, I was an outcast. I didn't have any friends or anyone, for that matter, to speak to. I barely spoke the language, so meeting new people was out of the question, and my parents were never home because of their busy schedules.""

""I would go to school, struggle to understand what was taught to me, go home, do homework, eat a frozen dinner, and go to sleep. Day after day, month after month, year after year, it was the same routine. Because I spoke so rarely, some of the more rude kids thought I had some kind of learning disorder and were rather mean to me. I was bullied relentlessly. Kids and teachers alike would talk behind my back and when they did speak to me it was with an air of condescension.""

""One day at lunch, when I was around twelve, a particularly abrasive student grabbed my cell phone out of my backpack. He waved it around, putting on a mocking French accent, saying, 'Mother, why did you pack snails in my lunch box, I wanted frog legs!' All I could do was cry. But that only egged him on."" 

""Each of his friends were laughing at me. All but one, Joeseph McCollum."" She sighed deeply after saying his name, as if even mentioning him weighed on her shoulders. ""He stood up from his seat and grabbed my phone from his friend, told him to stop being an ass, and gave it back to me. In an outburst of emotion, I hugged him. Coming to my senses, I was so embarrassed that I ran off. But it stuck with me. Because of him sticking up for me, a social pariah, his friends ostracized him."" 

""A few days later, I was sitting alone at lunch and he came up to me. He asked to sit next to me and I, being too stunned to speak, nodded vigorously. From that day on, we were inseparable."" 

""We had a lot in common, such as hiking and biking. Every weekend, we would bike down nature trails, and hike up hills and small mountains.""

""Even our family dynamics were similar. My parents were always gone because of work, Joseph's were never there to begin with. He told me his mom would get high and sleep all day, and his father told him he was an 'unlovable drain' before he walked out on the family.I felt bad for him but as long as we were in this boat together, we would never be alone again.""

""Once high school came around, we tested our relationship to see if we were more than friends. It didn't work out though."" She said with a thoughtful smile.

 ""We were just too close to risk what we already had. We still spent nearly every day together. We would take turns walking each other home from the bus stop, helping one another with assignments, and goofing off together when we had the time. Every day with him felt like a privilege. Due to his influence, I slowly started coming out of my shell. I was more confident when speaking to people and being in social settings in general. With my newfound confidence, Joeseph and I applied to the local university. I'll never forget the day Joseph and I received our acceptance letters. We were so excited, we played music as loud as we could and danced through my house all day.""

""We made all sorts of plans such as: what courses we would take, what our majors would be, and what extracurriculars we would pursue. We even found a small apartment to share within walking distance of the school. We settled in nicely but once school started, we began to see less and less of each other. It started slowly,"" She said, melancholy dripping from her voice.

""At first, we hung out every weekend. Then, every other weekend. By the time Christmas break started, I had seen him once in the last three months. The worst part is, that I had convinced myself I didn't miss him. I had made new friends this year and they were taking up my time. I was sure he had too.""

""A girl in my physics class, Rebecca, invited me to a Christmas party her sorority was throwing. It sounded like a ton of fun and just the release I needed from the stress of school. I ran home to get changed and I saw Joseph. He was so excited to see me. He ran to me saying, 

'Misty! I've got a surprise for you! I've rented out this beautiful B&B in the forest for the break. There are these breathtaking lakes and hiking trails that take you to the foot of the Smokies. Pack a couple of bags, we can leave in the morning!'"" 

""His eyes were wide with excitement, but I hadn’t expected him to make such a big plan without telling me first. Suddenly, I felt cornered. I hadn’t really thought about it until he asked, but my priorities had changed. A year ago, I would have jumped at the idea, but now… I had new friends and a new life. Part of me was afraid to go back to the way things used to be, afraid that it would pull me back into that old version of myself.""

""'You did all that without asking me? 'I've already made plans.'""

""I could see the joy drain from his face, replaced by hurt and disbelief. He looked at me like I’d just slapped him.

""'You...you made plans? With who?'""

""'Rebecca, from my physics class,' I answered casually, but guilt gnawed at me and I avoided his eyes.""

""'Rebecca, you just met her last week, and you didn’t think to ask if maybe I wanted to do something? You just… replaced me.' His voice was quieter, but the bitterness was starting to creep in.""

""'She invited me, Joseph. You can't just expect me to drop everything because you made plans without asking.'""

""His face twisted, something darker stirring beneath the surface. 'Drop everything? That's rich coming from you. Lately, you've barely acknowledged I exist. Ever since you made all of these new friends, I’ve been an afterthought. Maybe you’re too good for me now, huh?'""

""I rolled my eyes, feeling my frustration mounting. 'This isn’t about you! I’ve just been busy. We both have.'""

""'Busy?' He nearly spat the word out. 'Busy ditching me at every turn! It’s like the second you found a group that wasn’t bullying you, you decided I was expendable!'""

""His words stung, and I snapped back, 'I’m not your emotional crutch, Joseph. You can’t just expect me to be there for you every second like I owe you something.'""

""'So that’s what I am now, huh? Some albatross around your neck, some burden? That’s great, Misty. All these years, that's what you reduce me to.' His voice was rising, and his face was flushed with anger.""

""'You know what, maybe you are!' I shouted, the words spilling out before I could stop them. 'God, it’s like every time I’m with you, you drain the life out of me with your endless need for validation. You don’t need me, Joseph—you just don’t want to be alone, and I’m tired of feeling guilty for living my life!'""

""His face turned pale. His lips trembled, and when he spoke, his voice was deadly quiet. 'At least I needed you, Misty. You don’t need anyone, do you? That’s why you’re so damn heartless.'""

""'Oh, heartless?' I shot back, sarcasm dripping from every word. 'Is that what you tell yourself? Maybe you’re just so unlovable that you cling to whoever shows you the slightest bit of affection because deep down, you know they’ll all leave you just like your dad did! That’s why you’re so obsessed with me—I’m the only one who’s ever cared enough to stick around.'""

""His eyes widened in shock. I could see the impact of my words hit him like a freight train. His mouth opened, but no sound came out. I had crossed a line, and we both knew it.""

""'I…' he started to say, but the hurt in his eyes quickly turned to rage. 'Well, guess what? You didn’t stick around, either. You're just like everyone else who walks out of my life. Turns out you’re even worse because I thought you were different. But no, you’re just a cold, backstabbing bitch.'""

""My heart was racing, my vision blurring with anger, but I felt like I had to win this fight, even if it meant going too far. 'And you know what? Maybe I was just being nice to you all these years because I felt sorry for you. Everyone else saw it—you’re pathetic, Joseph. You’re just too scared to admit it.'""

""There was a tense, deafening silence between us. His shoulders slumped, his face pale as if all the life had drained out of him. When he looked at me, his eyes were hollow, like I’d ripped the last piece of hope from him."" 

""He walked away from me, into his room. I stood there for a moment, collecting my thoughts before I, with a huff, stormed out of the apartment."" 

""I went to the party but my mind was elsewhere the entire time. I knew I handled Joseph and I's argument poorly. I needed to apologize.""

""I went back to the apartment to try and smooth things over, but when I opened the door, I found him there, hanging from the curtain rod,"" Misty said, tears freely flowing from her eyes. ""A note protruded from his pocket with only three words written. 'You were right.'"" 

Misty, was oppenly sobbing, her words only coming out in short, raspy breaths. She looked at me, her heart seemingly torn from her chest. ""The last thing I told him was he was pathetic."" She wheezed. ""I caused this, it's all my fault he died!"" 

I sat there in stunned silence, not sure what to think or say. My initial reaction was to reach out and hug her. She clung to me like a drowning man does a lifeboat, searching my eyes for hope, for a lifeline.

 ""It's not your fault. He, obviously, had some demons in his life he was fighting. You didn't kill him. He did."" My mind was racing as I said the words. In the back of my mind, I did feel as if she had a part to play in the tragedy but I couldn't vocalize these thoughts. The last thing she needed was a complete stranger to add to her already mounting guilt. As I held her, time stood still. I knew my attempts at consoling the poor woman were futile. She needed time to process, to grieve. After what felt like hours, she broke the hug and stood from her seat.

""You're just saying that to make me feel better,"" She said, sniffling. ""I'm not some stupid child, I don't need you to talk down to me! I'm no better than a murderer!"" A deep, void-like silence permeated the otherwise quiet room.

 I struggled to find the words to say but when nothing came, she said, with a blank, dead-eyed stare, ""I need to use the restroom."" 

She walked past me, into the crowd of people that I came to assume all had similar issues they were running from, mistakes they were too afraid to correct. Could I be one of them, I thought, for a fleeting moment, reminding me of the argument my sister and I had before I began this journey? 

Of course not, I was in control. I decided to come here to process my emotions and regroup, these people came here as an excuse to run away. My focus now should be to do everything in my power to not fall for the same traps they did.

I made my way back to my seat, deep in thought. Had I said enough? What was the point of saying anything at all? I slumped into the back of my seat with an exhausted sigh. Whether I wanted to be caught up in people's drama or not, seemed irrelevant. Maybe that is why I was here, I pondered. Maybe helping others was my purpose. If that's true, however, I don't know if I'm equipped to do that. 

As my thoughts raced, I was greeted by Chris, coming to sit with me with a hearty lunch of chili and cornbread, steaming in his bowl.

""You look pretty rough, Newbie. You sleep ok?"" He asked, mouth full.

""I don't know,"" I said dismissively. Part of me wanted to brush him off but another part needed some form of validation. ""What do you do, when there's nothing you can do?"" I asked, turning my eyes to Chris.

""There's always something you can do, Newbie,"" Chris said shoveling more chili into his mouth. ""Nothing is ever completely out of your control, you just have to decide what steps are available to you."" I pondered what he said for a moment.

""But what if someone doesn't want you to do anything? What if you may have made things worse? I'm worried for he..."" I trailed off, not wanting to say more than I should.

""Then change your approach. Find out what you did wrong and do something different."" I mulled over what he said, as he chewed loudly, blissfully unaware of the torment Misty, and I by extension, were under.  What the man lacked in decorum, I thought, he made up for it in wisdom.

""Thanks, Chris,"" I said, shutting my eyelids in hopes of a small nap.

""Any time, that's what friends are for.""

**Chapter 8**

**Gone**

A low hum of murmurs pulled me from sleep, voices growing louder until they boiled into an argument. Blinking groggily, I sat up, the dim light outside signaling the sun’s retreat beyond the horizon. My head throbbed, a dull ache from last night’s chaotic emotions and restless dreams.

""Chris,"" I whispered, nudging his shoulder. He stirred, groaning softly but didn’t wake. His snores continued, heavy and unbothered, while the noise in the room grew.

Reluctantly, I stood, rubbing the sleep from my eyes. As I stretched, I noticed a small gathering of passengers near the back of the bus, their faces etched with concern. Something wasn’t right.

“Excuse me,” I said to a man as I approached the edge of the crowd. “What’s going on?”

The man, his face lined with years of wear, turned to me. “It’s the girl. The one with the black hair.”

“Misty?” My stomach twisted.

“Yeah, her,” he said. “She’s gone to the back.”

My heart dropped. “The staff took her?”

He shook his head, glancing nervously toward the others. “No. She went on her own.”

“What?” The word escaped before I could stop it, my voice cracking with disbelief. “She just… walked back there?”

“That’s what’s got everyone riled up,” he muttered, his hands wringing his hat. “I’ve been on this bus for a long time. Seen folks get sent to the back more times than I can count, but I ain’t never seen nobody choose to go.”

The world around me spun. My mind raced with questions, with dread. Why would Misty go willingly? She had been upset earlier, sure, but…

“Did she say anything?” I asked, my voice barely audible over the lump forming in my throat.

He hesitated, guilt flashing in his eyes. “She sat next to me for a bit before she left. Looked like she wanted to talk, but… I didn’t say nothing. Just kept reading my book.”

“You ignored her?” The words came out harsher than I intended.

“I didn’t know!” he snapped back, his voice trembling. “I didn’t know what she was planning to do. I thought she just needed some space.”

I wanted to yell, to berate him for his cowardice, but the truth was like a stone in my gut—I wasn’t any better. I hadn’t checked on her after our conversation that morning. I’d left her to deal with her pain alone, and now…

A Ding Dong chime echoed through the room, silencing the murmurs.

“Attention passengers of Section Two,” came the driver’s disembodied voice, calm yet chilling. “It seems some of you are struggling to follow the rules of this journey. Let me remind you: disruptions will not be tolerated. For those who continue to test boundaries, my staff is fully equipped to handle such matters. For everyone else, relax and enjoy your escape. This is your final warning. Thank you and have a nice day.”

The tension in the room was suffocating. Slowly, the crowd began to disperse, passengers returning to their seats with hushed whispers and anxious glances.

The old man turned to me, his shoulders slumped under an invisible weight. “I didn’t mean for this to happen,” he said softly before shuffling back to his seat, head hung low.

I stood there, frozen. My pulse thundered in my ears as I stared at the door to the back of the bus. The driver’s warning replayed in my mind, his words heavy with menace.

This isn’t your fight, a voice in my head insisted. She made her choice. You don’t owe her anything.

But another voice, quieter yet more insistent, whispered a different truth: What if it were Mom? What if someone could have saved her and didn’t?

The thought hit me like a punch to the chest. Tears pricked at the corners of my eyes as the weight of guilt pressed down on me. I clenched my fists, struggling to breathe through the storm of emotions raging inside me.

I glanced back at Chris, who was now awake and watching me. His face was unreadable, his gaze shadowed with something I couldn’t quite place. When our eyes met, he quickly looked away, pulling his blanket tighter around him.

Desperation clawed at my throat. I couldn’t just sit here, couldn’t do nothing. But what could I do? If I went after her, I risked drawing the ire of the driver and the staff. If I stayed, I’d carry the weight of this choice forever.

My chest tightened, the air around me feeling thinner with each passing second. My thoughts spiraled, each one louder and more chaotic than the last. I felt trapped, cornered by my own fears and failures.

But beneath it all, that quiet voice still lingered: What if it were Mom?

**Chapter 9**

**Something Different**

I found my way to a secluded bench seat, my brows furrowed, bloodshot eyes, unblinking. I stared at the door to the back section watching for any inconsistencies in the staff's movements and the passengers' routines. My temples thumped like a war drum, adrenaline coursing through every fiber of my being. 

Every movement was noted in the back of my mind. The elderly passenger nearest to the door was engrossed in the book he told me about, and rarely looked up. The pianist unceasingly played his jazzy tunes, lulling anyone near them to sleep. The door, I noticed, remained starkly unguarded but was damn near impossible to get close to without being seen. 

I scanned across the width of the room, noticing Chris chatting with other passengers. It seemed to me, that Misty's disappearance had no effect on him and I rolled my eyes with disgust. ""How could he care so little about someone's life being in danger?"" I thought to myself.

I quickly banished the thought. Chris' uncaring attitude only served to distract me. I refocused and looked at my watch. It was getting close to dinner time. My stomach rumbled furiously. The last thing I had eaten was breakfast this morning but I couldn't allow it to hinder me. 

The staff began rolling out carts of food toward the buffet. The small closet-like door they came from was tucked, almost imperceptively into a dark corner of the lounge. My mind reeled at the possibilities. If this was a staff access corridor, it must be connected to nearly every room on the bus. If I could find a way to sneak in, I would be able to move freely throughout the entirety of the vehicle. 

""That's a big 'if'"" I muttered under my breath. Staying undetected in a staff-only passageway was all but impossible. I groaned and slouched back in my seat, rubbing my eyes. My stomach rumbled again, refusing to be ignored. I came to realize that being hungry was becoming more of a distraction than taking a few minutes to eat. I stood from my secluded perch and made my way to the buffet where I bumped into Chris.

""Oh, hey Newbie,"" Chris said, with his signature oblivious smile. ""You ok? You seem a bit out of it.""

""No, Chris, I'm not ok. I just....I got a lot on my mind."" I answered with a sigh.

""I understand if you're all tore up about the whole Maddie thing..."" He started.

""Misty!"" I exclaimed, then lowered my voice. ""Her name was...is Misty, and if I can't help her, who will?""

""Alright, fine, I get it. You're upset about Misty. But being upset isn't going to solve the problem."" He said with a sly wink.

""And doing nothing will?"" My blood was boiling; I knew exactly what to expect from Chris' emotional intelligence but by some miracle, he still found a way to let me down. ""I finally have a chance to do something meaningful in my life and you're telling me to just bury my head in the sand? No! I'm not going to sit idly by. I'm not going to run away like you did with Cindy!"" The words tasted like vinegar as they left my mouth. As soon as I said them, I wished I could take them back.



""I'm sorry, Chris. That was low and I shouldn't have said that. I'm scared. For Misty...for us.""

Chris looked up to me, his eyes filled with empathy. ""It's ok, Newbie, I get it. Eat some food, get some rest,” Chris said, his voice quieter now, almost distant. “Maybe you’re right. Maybe someone needs to do something. Just… don’t burn yourself out, okay?”

He took his food, and without another word turned and left. With my appetite well and truly gone, I grabbed a double shot of espresso for what I knew would be a long night.

Before heading back to my seclusion, I grabbed my phone from my backpack and opened the notes app. 09:00 pm, the staff cleaned up what was left of dinner. 09:15 The staff took drink orders and handed out cigars. 09:45 The old man, reading, got up to use the restroom. 09:50 The old man returned. On, and on my notes went, meticulously, typing out every movement made. 

The next time I glanced at my watch, it was well past midnight. Silence washed over the cabin like a heavy blanket. All were sleeping, all but Chris. 

He furiously jotted down on a notepad, his eyes darting from time to time to the door and to me. Once he finished writing, he quickly stuffed the note in my backpack. He took a deep breath and in a flash made a beeline toward the door. I was too stunned to react, my mouth dropped open as the whole world seemed to slow to a crawl. Chris reached his destination and fumbled awkwardly at the handle. To his and my utter horror, it didn't budge. Immediately, staff from all over the room swarmed his position. Chris screamed loudly as he rushed the staff shouting profanities and throwing wild punches. None of them connected as the staff member expertly dodged his blows like a well-trained boxer, bobbing and weaving each sloppy swipe. 

They wrestled Chris to the ground in an instant, never attacking him—only deflecting his wild punches and swiftly restraining him. I stood from my seat, every fiber of my being screaming to help him. But I hesitated. If I tried to intervene now, I'd share whatever fate the staff had in mind for him.

His eyes, wild with fear just moments before, were now steeled with defiant determination. The staff lifted him effortlessly, as though they’d done this a hundred times.

“Let me go!” Chris roared, thrashing in their grip. “Fight me like a man, you bastards! I won’t go down without a fight!”

I could only stand there, paralyzed. The other passengers stirred, whispering loudly among themselves.

“There is nothing to see here,” one of the staff members said, gripping Chris by the arm. “Go back to sleep. We will deal with this interruption.”

The door slid open, and they ushered Chris through. He glanced over his shoulder at me, flashing a wry grin and a wink—like this was all part of some grand plan only he understood.

“What just happened?” a woman nearby whispered, her voice shaky with confusion. I hesitated, still reeling from the chaos.

“I... I don’t know,” I muttered, brushing past her. I needed space, needed answers.

I hurried to my backpack, where I’d seen Chris stash the note earlier. After a quick search, I found it—crumpled into a ball. Unfolding it with trembling hands, I read the hastily scrawled words:

Hey Newbie, if you're reading this, my plan worked! I got sent to the back! Or they killed me and it didn’t work. Either way, what you said, it stuck with me. I’ve lived my life scared for far too long. I had to do something, or I’d never forgive myself. Once I find Misty, I want off this bus. I think I got what I came for anyway. Thanks for being there for me, Newbie. No matter what happens, I’m glad I met you.

My heart skipped a beat. Had he done this... for me?

Ding Dong.

The PA system crackled to life, the bus driver’s voice slicing through the heavy silence. “Twenty-four hours. You idiots couldn’t behave for twenty-four hours. I asked one simple thing from you all, and this is how you respond?”

His cold, calculated delivery sent chills down my spine.

“It seems I have to make an example out of the fool who caused this. I will not tolerate insubordination on my bus. I decide what happens here. Me. If any of you think you know better, try this stunt again. I dare you.”

The intercom cut off abruptly, leaving a suffocating silence in its wake.

One by one, the other passengers retreated to their seats. The weight of the driver's threat pressed down on us all, and soon the cabin was eerily quiet, everyone too afraid to speak. I crumpled down in my seat, the weight of all that had happened finally catching up to me. All I wanted to do was curl up into a ball and disappear. But that was off the table. I had to help my friends and time was running out.

Hi m29 looking for constant fwb within mandaluyong
Working

Sakto lang sa itsura

Just got out of 5 mos fwb kasi magkalayo kami and wala na kaming time to do the deed. I need someone daw that i can satisfy my needs so umayaw na sya sa setup.

Im not looking for sa masyadong wild/ma-kink na girl (mahinhin is a plus)

Ung horny din palagi - willing to meet at least 1x a week

Within my preferred location syempre para accessible

Hindi magaling pero marunong (gusto ko lang ng chill, magrelax)

Sakto lang din sa itsura tulad ko

Protection is a must 

So yun i hope my post finds you well

Lets chat muna, get vibes going before meetup
I like playing games
Out of town travels
Anime/Manga 
Foodie - favorite ko pizza
Ayoko ng puro sex lang usapan and ayoko rin pag nagmemeet eh sex lang gagawin, lets grab a coffee or samahan ka mag window shopping.


Hindi ko sinasara tong setup to level up to something more, pero kung decided ko na no attachments talaga, okay lang

1jx6y5f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jx6y5f,How to care for leaf damage,"I have a fairly new plumeria plant that I brought back from Hawaii last year. It has been doing pretty well to my knowledge and even grew new leaves during winter when I had it indoors! I left for another trip to Hawaii for 8 days and when I came back it had brown holes in the leaves. I’m not sure what it is from, there is no bugs. 

I think it could be from my cats chewing on the leaves or maybe from the coffee I added into the soil for nutrients. 

How do I care for the damage now that it is done? Should I cut the leaves off? (2 out of 3 leaves are affected)

1jx6y23,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1jx6y23/eczema/,Eczema,"Has anyone noticed that Starbucks coffee is a flair for there eczema ? 

Note : I haven’t had eczema a day in my life before, and then I started drinking coffee - only Starbucks. As soon as I started, 2 months later I have suffered with full body eczema for 3 years. 

One of my clients pointed out her flare up was caused by Starbucks, so I cut it out 2 weeks ago, my body’s not 100% great, but it’s WAY better. 

I can make this knowledge because I have been eating dairy free, gluten free, low histamine diet for MONTHS while drinking Starbucks with no change, I have added back my entire diet, while removing Starbucks, and it has gotten SEVERLY better ! 

Any suggestions as to what’s in Starbucks that is triggering? Would I be good for normal coffee again else where?
