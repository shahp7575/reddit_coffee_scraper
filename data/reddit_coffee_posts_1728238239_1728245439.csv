Never in my life have I experienced such severe insomnia as I did after reading the details of John‚Äôs ‚Äúsecond translocation‚Äù. By the time I began attempting to fall asleep that night, It felt like all of the residual thoughts and questions surrounding the contents of that entry had actually begun to occupy physical space in my head. Everytime I restlessly repositioned my head on my pillow I could feel the weight of those ruminations slosh around in my skull, the partially coagulated thoughtform taking a few moments to completely settle out like the fluid in a magic eight ball. Eventually, I gave up on sleep entirely. I resigned myself to replaying the events described in John‚Äôs logbook, trying to inspect each piece of it from every possible angle in order to glean an epiphany, as if that epiphany would act as some sort of mental Ambien. Unfortunately, it became clear that I was still missing some crucial components to this narrative, and I could divine nothing additional from the information I already had absorbed that would pacify my ragged psyche. I needed more.¬†

Cup of coffee in hand, I reluctantly sat back down at my office desk. I glanced over at the clock - 330 AM. After taking a few deep, meditative breathes, I did what I could to brace myself and I flipped over another menu.¬†

For the next several logs I read that night, I don‚Äôt believe there will be any utility to me reproducing them here in their entirety. First and foremost, there is a certain amount of redundancy to some of the entries that may only serve to cast a fog over the throughline of the events described. Maybe more critically, however, is my fear of incompletion. My health has again worsened since the last time I uploaded a post. I am anxious to put a pin in this, so I will use the space below to synthesize those entries in an effort to keep things moving at a reasonable pace. Before I begin, I do feel like I need to address how I scarred my left eye.¬†

Death marches indifferent towards all of us from the moment we are born - sometimes slowly, sometimes rapidly. If you had asked me a year ago which was preferable, assuming you were forced to make a selection, I would say a rapid death, without a single shred of hesitation in my response. Bearing witness to the stepwise loss of my dad‚Äôs identity over the last five years has been indescribably tortuous. And to clarify, I really do mean that it is indescribable. I generally don‚Äôt know the appropriate words to describe the abject horrors of dementia. God knows I‚Äôve tried to find them. It‚Äôs like watching someone‚Äôs soul rot. Each passing day, a new small piece of your loved one is involuntarily divested, dissolving into the atmosphere like steam. But, unlike with my fiance, I did have ample time and space to say my goodbyes, I suppose.¬†

Without any creativity whatsoever, my response to John‚Äôs disease was to bottle up my emotions and turn to liquor as a means to dull my senses. Tale as old as time. Wren, my fiance, tried to help me. But I was ritually intoxicated, forlorn and distracted, and when it mattered most, I did not see the stop sign. In complete contrast to John, I lost her instantaneously. Meanwhile, I only sustained a deep laceration to my left eye and a few fractured ribs. She knew I loved her, thankfully. Learning from John, I had taken the time to let her know how much she meant to me, telling her that she was my kaleidoscope, a comparison that I had adapted from John early in my life. When I looked through her, the bleakness of the world was replaced with a fulfilling radiance. But I have been irreparably guilt stricken from this unforgivable transgression. In another twist of the knife that almost feels poetic, John didn‚Äôt have the wherewithal to talk me through how he processed the guilt of his crash in the context of ignoring the risks of driving with a new seizure disorder by the time my crash occurred.¬†

I need to move on from this topic, otherwise I'll never complete this. Just know that after the events of the last year I don‚Äôt have such a clear cut answer for which death is worse, not anymore.¬†

Selected excerpt 1: April, 2005

*‚Äú\[...\] One thing I have noticed upon reflection is that some of my memories in the past few years do not feel completely my own. I have spent months recovering from my crash (seizure and seemingly translocation free, thankfully), which has allowed me the opportunity to review my cache of recollections in full. From at least the year 2000 and on, I feel like I have only the imprints of my memories - they are just files stored on a biological harddrive. I can access them, open and close them, but I do not feel like I myself experienced them. Lucy attributes this all to the stress of my position at CellCept, with a resulting depression draining those more recent memories of their inherent technicolor. I have considered this, but I am not so sure. Although I have taken the time to confirm these abnormally textured memories are not false, i.e. confirmed with others that they did actually happen as I can recollect them, I just do not feel I was there when they were made. But I clearly was \[...\]‚Äù*

An important insight. I will come back to it soon.¬†

Most of the entries before and directly after his crash are very introspective and well put together. After explaining his theorem regarding why sound disappears with the arrival of Atlas in his translocations and how that could represent the ‚Äúinverse of a memory‚Äù (see the end of¬†[post 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1fwf1w2/after_my_father_died_i_found_a_logbook_concealed/)), he does pick up where he left off in trying to prove the existence and scientific underpinnings of his translocations. To save you all the trouble, I have omitted most of the entries dedicated to systematically proving his translocations. Personally, I had grappled with the ‚Äúnoise canceling headphones‚Äù metaphor and how that relates to everything for quite awhile before I felt like I had a vague idea what he was trying to relay. Little did I know that this was the equivalent of kindergarten arts and crafts when compared to his subsequently described theorems. If you have a PhD in calculus, biophysics and electromagnetism, feel free to message me privately and I‚Äôll send over some pictures. For us laypeople, it‚Äôs best to skip ahead to this next piece:¬†

Selected excerpt 2: July, 2005

*‚Äú\[...\] the biophysical motion as calculated does seem mathematically sound. However, to complete my postulates, I will need to perform an experiment in spacial relativity. To do this, I will need to adopt a sort of metaphysical vigilance. At some point, I expect I will begin translocating again. When I do, I will need to somehow recognize that my consciousness is out of its expected position in spacetime before Atlas makes its presence known. To this end, and to Lucy‚Äôs very pleasing chagrin related to a lack of spousal consultation, I went out and got my first tattoo this morning. Specifically, one of the logos for The Smashing Pumpkins covering the majority of my right forearm (the one with the heart and ‚ÄúSP‚Äù in the center). My reasoning is this: if my consciousness is receding into a memory, I think I should recall what was and not what currently is. Therefore, it stands to reason that if I‚Äôm mid-translocation, in a memory, I will NOT have this tattoo on my forearm. There are a few caveats here: first and foremost, it is possible that I will simply merge how I am now with how I was then, resulting in me visualizing myself with the tattoo on my arm even though it would not have happened yet. If the countless studies on the unreliability of courtroom eyewitness misidentification are any indication, our memories are very fallible and subject to external forces. Second, if in the future I am translocating to a memory that occurs AFTER I got my tattoo, this will obviously not be very helpful. Lastly, even if it does work, I do not know for sure that the evidence I am looking for will even be perceptible to me. If this works however, and I am able to appreciate that I am translocating before Atlas arrives, I hope that I can find my tether \[...\]‚Äù*

There are no entries dated between July 2005 and the end of 2007. In early 2008, they resumed, but they actually just start over with the description of his initial translocation, with some differences. The first appreciable difference is the time stamp. The second and more disturbing difference is how they fracture and devolve.¬†

Excerpt from March 2008:

*First translocation.*

*The morning of the first translocation was like any other. I awoke around 9AM, Lucy was already out of bed and probably had been for some time. Peter and Lily had really become a handful over the last few years, and Lucy would need help giving Lily her medications.*¬†

*Wearily, I stood at the top of our banister, surveying the beautiful disaster that was raising young children (immediate, harsh scribbles directly after the world children)*

*John, put NLRP77 in SC484. John, put NLRP77 in SC484. John, put NLRP77 in SC484. John, put NLRP77 in SC484. John, put NLRP77 in SC484.*¬†*John, put NLRP77 in SC484. John, put NLRP77 in SC484.

*I then began to appreciate the figure before me. He stood at least 10 feet tall. His arms and legs were the same proportions, which gave his upper extremities an unnatural length. which gave his upper extremities an unnatural length.*

*which gave his upper extremities an unnatural length.*

*His skin was taught and tented and taught and tented and taught and tented on both of his wrists, tired flesh rising about a foot symmetrically above each hand. Dried blood streaks led up to a center point of the stretched skin, where a fountain of mercurial silver erupted upwards. Following the silver with my eyesFollowing the silver with my eyesFollowing the silver with my eyesFollowing the silver with my eyesFollowing the silver with my eyesFollowing the silver with my eyes\[...\]‚Äù*

It continues like that for a while, then cuts off into more scribbles. Of note, the scribbles were intercut with sketches of the sigil ([see here for reference](https://imgur.com/a/symbol-above-every-entry-Rb2VbH)). There are a lot of entries like this, with the only new dialogue being ‚Äú*John, put NLRP77 in SC484*‚Äù. None of those numbers meant anything to me the first time I read them.¬†

When I looked up from my desk, dawn had apparently arrived. I had maybe ten or so entries left to go, but I decided to stop for now. I had obligations to attend to, involving Lucy, my mother. I knew I had to ask her about the deathbed logbook, but I dreaded it deeply. Not because I was afraid of her reaction or her emotional state after reading it, or that I was under the impression she would not know anything, very much the opposite - I was afraid of what she might know.¬†

I carried my sleep deprived body over to the house I had grown up in. After John‚Äôs passing, my mom had planned on finally taking the time to declutter and downsize their belongings, intending on eventually moving in with Greg and his family. She answered the door with a very on-brand cherry disposition, but her mood shifted to one of concern when she saw my bloodshot eyes.¬†

I think John fell into love with my mother for the same reasons he was jealous of Greg. Lucy took life in stride, and this made her ineffably resilient to change and strife. Despite this, my father‚Äôs dementia had undeniably sapped her of some of her effervescence. You could tell that cherry disposition rang slightly hollow nowadays. That being said, her ability to still conjure and maintain the disposition, even if slightly hollow, is perhaps the utmost attestation to her resilience.¬†

After assisting her with various tasks that morning, we sat down at the kitchen table for lunch and I finally manifested the courage to show her some of the logs. I only brought bits and pieces for review, not wanting to disconcert her with the more violent imagery. John never mentioned any 10-foot tall ‚ÄúAtlas‚Äù to her, she remarked with a characteristic chortle. Credit where credit is due, the abruptness and absurdity of that question is objectively funny, and Lucy was still able to find humor in these darker days.¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou know honestly honey, I think it's all just remnants of his mind having a bit of a last hoorah.‚Äù She said after completing her review. ‚ÄúI know this has cut you so deeply, especially since you were busy with your residency training the last few years. You have enough on your plate with what happened to Wren, try not to overburden yourself‚Äù.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think it's odd that dad was able to write this, in secret, while on hospice? With us needing to help him with everything like we did‚Äù?

Lucy had to take a moment to determine her impression of that statement. Eventually, she replied: ‚ÄúI think dad spent his last few years in a power struggle with his dementia, whether he appreciated it or not. I know you weren‚Äôt around to see this, but some days were great, he was almost himself.‚Äù She paused and decided to rephrase the last statement: ‚ÄúWell no that‚Äôs not quite right, he was always himself, to his last day. On his good days though, he had¬†*the ability*¬†to act like himself. This would include writing, as you well know‚Äù

‚ÄúYou never saw him writing¬†*anything*¬†while visiting him at hospice?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, Pete, nothing, but that doesn‚Äôt mean he couldn‚Äôt or that he didn‚Äôt. Also you know how overworked the aides are in the memory unit - just because they didn‚Äôt see or don‚Äôt remember seeing him write, doesn‚Äôt mean he didn‚Äôt or couldn‚Äôt‚Äù. I can tell, just barely, that I had pinched a nerve.¬†

We were silent for a while after that, cooling down from the exchange.¬†

‚ÄúIt reminds me a lot of the way he would write his research, actually. I wish we could ask Majorie‚Äù she said, solemnly¬†

This is the turning point.¬†

‚ÄúWait, that's a great idea. Why can‚Äôt we ask her?‚Äù

Majorie, as a reminder, was dad‚Äôs co-researcher at CellCept. They had met in graduate school and were fast friends in spite of the large, fifthteen year age gap. As you might imagine, there were not a lot of options for academic kinship when my dad was earning his PhD - cellular topography is a niche avenue of investigation now, to my understanding, let alone back in the 80s (see[¬†post 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1fvm64g/after_my_father_died_i_found_a_logbook_concealed/)¬†for a more complete description). Lucy and Majorie had also gotten along very well, but in a flash of realization I now appreciated that I had not seen them together since I graduated middle school.¬†

Lucy put her hand to her mouth, coming to terms with the fact that she had let something slip: ‚ÄúWell, shoot. We didn‚Äôt want to tell you when you were a kid, love. It was right after dad‚Äôs crash - you were still very shaken up about death and dying.‚Äù

‚ÄúMajorie‚Ä¶is dead?‚Äù I asked, disbelief taking hold of me

From here, Lucy filled in a few critical gaps in the story. After John‚Äôs crash, Majorie went on to be the sole researcher on a project that they had both recently been promoted for. CellCept was a pharmaceutical company interested in developing medications targeted at improving human longevity at the cellular level. They had both been working there since grad school (so at least a decade) without a sizable increase in their pay before this new project. The goal was this: another branch of the company had found a line of uniquely immortal stem cells, and it became John and Marjorie‚Äôs job to try to determine on a cellular level why that was the case (Lucy thinks these cells were found ‚Äúat autopsy‚Äù of someone who had donated their body to science, but that is all she can remember of their origin). In the timeline, my mom thinks that the promotion occurred in early 2004, predating the first entry in John‚Äôs logbook by a few months at the very least. After the crash put John out of commission, Majorie was expected to work double time at mapping the interior of that infinitely dividing cell line. In the overwhelming chaos of the crash, and in caring for John‚Äôs extensive health needs after he was released from the hospital, Lucy had lost touch with Majorie. She explained to me that her assumption was that Marjorie was absolutely consumed with work, now that she was the only one on the project, and that's why she did not see much of her in those months after the crash. There was a point in time while my dad was recovering that he considered not returning to CellCept - per Lucy, ‚Äúhe had felt more alive in that recovery time then he did since he accepted the job‚Äù. Maybe he would become a stay-at-home dad. Lily, my sister, still had health issues after her childhood cancer that would always benefit from increased supervision.¬†

One night in May of 2004, however, John received an unexpected call from Marjorie‚Äôs wife. Over the last few months she had developed rapid onset neurologic symptoms, and was unlikely to live for more than another week or so. She had been diagnosed with ‚Äúsporadic CJD‚Äù, also known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

CJD is a wildly progressive and incredibly rare entity, estimated to affect about one american in a million per year. Essentially, the pathophysiology involves ‚Äúprions‚Äù - self-propagating proteins that proliferate in brain matter, causing injury and subsequent degradation of neurons. This disease is not well understood, because it is the only disease (that I am aware of) where proteins alone act like an infection. Proteins are the fundamental molecules that allow all cells to function - building blocks to human cells, bacterial cells, viral cells, so on and so on. Canonically, though, they are not really considered to be ‚Äúalive‚Äù. And yet, these proteins are able to ‚Äúinfect‚Äù a human host if prion-infested tissues are consumed (they are cases in Papua New Guinea of aboriginal tribespeople developing a subset of this disease due to ritualistic cannibalism of human brain tissue). There is no treatment, and diagnosis of the disease is usually presumed in patients who have all the cardinal findings of CJD as well as MRI and lab findings that are in support of the diagnosis. However, it is important to note that the only way to definitively make this diagnosis is through a brain biopsy, which is rarely if ever performed due to the risk of spreading the infectious, deadly protein. Most patients die within one year of symptom onset. The punchline of all of this is that the symptoms of CJD are, broadly speaking, the same symptoms as Alzheimer‚Äôs Dementia, John‚Äôs diagnosis. They just occur and progress much quicker. When I asked if she had any seizures, she said Marjorie did. I would later exhaustively research CJD, only to find that seizures are actually incredibly uncommon in a disease that is already a one in a million diagnosis (The National Institutes of Health quotes that less than 3% of cases of CJD are accompanied by seizures). She passed a week after my dad got that phone call. No brain biopsy was ever performed on Marjorie. Because CellCept wanted the project to continue, after Majorie‚Äôs death they threatened John‚Äôs potential severance package and reputation in the field if he did not come back to work. Under that coercion, he did return to CellCept in September of 2005.¬†

I was initially staggered by these revelations. I could tell, with an unexplainable extrasensory insight, that all of this was relevant. I just didn‚Äôt initially know why it was relevant. Seemingly, John experienced all the same symptoms that Marjorie did, she just succumbed to her disease much quicker. Yet, something was amiss here. John certainly did not develop CJD - he would have never lasted so long with that diagnosis. If you look at it from the opposing perspective, Majorie developed all the same symptoms that John,¬†*including*¬†seizures, which do not fit with the diagnosis of CJD, or are at least an exceptionally rare manifestation of an already exceptionally rare disease.¬†

Knowing that digesting this new information would take time, I put it on the backburner and resumed helping Lucy pack. In doing so, I ended up being tasked with taking apart the bedframe in John‚Äôs old room. I say John‚Äôs room, because they had been sleeping in different bedrooms for at least a decade before his death. This was not the sign of a dissolving marriage, rather, John was an impossibly light sleeper and Lucy eventually was diagnosed with sleep apnea and needed to wear a CPAP machine overnight. If you‚Äôre not familiar with how CPAP machines looked in the early 2000s, it is worth a google - they were loud, heavy machines in their infancy. John would have better luck sleeping in the same room as a practicing mariachi band.

As if the last twenty four hours had not already been dizzying enough, in the process of dismantling the wooden bedframe I discovered something hidden in the exact same part of the bed that I had found his logbook. In his hospice room, those papers were sequestered under the mattress in the top left-hand corner. In his old bedroom, I found a singular key taped to the underside of the frame in the same, top left-hand corner. Engraved on the key were the numbers ‚Äú484‚Äù.

As much as I want to finish this, I need to rest. To introduce what is coming in the next post (which may be the penultimate or ultimate post, depending on my energy levels in the coming few days), the SC484 in the phrase ‚Äú*John, put NLRP77 in SC484‚Äù*¬†referred to storage container numbered 484 at a warehouse half an hour from my childhood home. When questioned, Lucy did not know of its existence. No one did.¬†

Days later, I would develop the prerequisite bravery to find and unlock that abhorrent vault. Inside an eight hundred square foot container lay thousands of moth-eaten marble notebooks, stacked in unorganized, schizophrenic piles as well as the final grim piece to understanding the¬†[sigil](https://imgur.com/a/symbol-above-every-entry-Rb2VbHP). John Morrison was correct when he said he knew it wasn‚Äôt the depiction of an eye, or, more accurately, wasn‚Äôt just the depiction of an eye.¬†

You don't notice me, of course. Why would you? But I see everything.

Although I have taken the time to confirm these abnormally textured memories are not false, i.e. confirmed with others that they did actually happen as I can recollect them, I just do not feel I was there when they were made. But I clearly was \[...\]‚Äù*

An important insight. I will come back to it soon.¬†

Most of the entries before and directly after his crash are very introspective and well put together. After explaining his theorem regarding why sound disappears with the arrival of Atlas in his translocations and how that could represent the ‚Äúinverse of a memory‚Äù (see the end of¬†[post 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1fwf1w2/after_my_father_died_i_found_a_logbook_concealed/)), he does pick up where he left off in trying to prove the existence and scientific underpinnings of his translocations. To save you all the trouble, I have omitted most of the entries dedicated to systematically proving his translocations. Personally, I had grappled with the ‚Äúnoise canceling headphones‚Äù metaphor and how that relates to everything for quite awhile before I felt like I had a vague idea what he was trying to relay. Little did I know that this was the equivalent of kindergarten arts and crafts when compared to his subsequently described theorems. If you have a PhD in calculus, biophysics and electromagnetism, feel free to message me privately and I‚Äôll send over some pictures. For us laypeople, it‚Äôs best to skip ahead to this next piece:¬†

Selected excerpt 2: July, 2005

*‚Äú\[...\] the biophysical motion as calculated does seem mathematically sound. However, to complete my postulates, I will need to perform an experiment in spacial relativity. To do this, I will need to adopt a sort of metaphysical vigilance. At some point, I expect I will begin translocating again. When I do, I will need to somehow recognize that my consciousness is out of its expected position in spacetime before Atlas makes its presence known. To this end, and to Lucy‚Äôs very pleasing chagrin related to a lack of spousal consultation, I went out and got my first tattoo this morning. Specifically, one of the logos for The Smashing Pumpkins covering the majority of my right forearm (the one with the heart and ‚ÄúSP‚Äù in the center). My reasoning is this: if my consciousness is receding into a memory, I think I should recall what was and not what currently is. Therefore, it stands to reason that if I‚Äôm mid-translocation, in a memory, I will NOT have this tattoo on my forearm. There are a few caveats here: first and foremost, it is possible that I will simply merge how I am now with how I was then, resulting in me visualizing myself with the tattoo on my arm even though it would not have happened yet. If the countless studies on the unreliability of courtroom eyewitness misidentification are any indication, our memories are very fallible and subject to external forces. Second, if in the future I am translocating to a memory that occurs AFTER I got my tattoo, this will obviously not be very helpful. Lastly, even if it does work, I do not know for sure that the evidence I am looking for will even be perceptible to me. If this works however, and I am able to appreciate that I am translocating before Atlas arrives, I hope that I can find my tether \[...\]‚Äù*

There are no entries dated between July 2005 and the end of 2007. In early 2008, they resumed, but they actually just start over with the description of his initial translocation, with some differences. The first appreciable difference is the time stamp. The second and more disturbing difference is how they fracture and devolve.¬†

Excerpt from March 2008:

*First translocation.*

*The morning of the first translocation was like any other. I awoke around 9AM, Lucy was already out of bed and probably had been for some time. Peter and Lily had really become a handful over the last few years, and Lucy would need help giving Lily her medications.*¬†

*Wearily, I stood at the top of our banister, surveying the beautiful disaster that was raising young children (immediate, harsh scribbles directly after the world children)*

*John, put NLRP77 in SC484. John, put NLRP77 in SC484. John, put NLRP77 in SC484. John, put NLRP77 in SC484. John, put NLRP77 in SC484.*¬†*John, put NLRP77 in SC484. John, put NLRP77 in SC484.

*I then began to appreciate the figure before me. He stood at least 10 feet tall. His arms and legs were the same proportions, which gave his upper extremities an unnatural length. which gave his upper extremities an unnatural length.*

Following the silver with my eyesFollowing the silver with my eyesFollowing the silver with my eyesFollowing the silver with my eyesFollowing the silver with my eyesFollowing the silver with my eyes\[...\]‚Äù*

It continues like that for a while, then cuts off into more scribbles. Of note, the scribbles were intercut with sketches of the sigil ([see here for reference](https://imgur.com/a/symbol-above-every-entry-Rb2VbH)). There are a lot of entries like this, with the only new dialogue being ‚Äú*John, put NLRP77 in SC484*‚Äù. None of those numbers meant anything to me the first time I read them.¬†

When I looked up from my desk, dawn had apparently arrived. I had maybe ten or so entries left to go, but I decided to stop for now. I had obligations to attend to, involving Lucy, my mother. I knew I had to ask her about the deathbed logbook, but I dreaded it deeply. Not because I was afraid of her reaction or her emotional state after reading it, or that I was under the impression she would not know anything, very much the opposite - I was afraid of what she might know.¬†

I carried my sleep deprived body over to the house I had grown up in. After John‚Äôs passing, my mom had planned on finally taking the time to declutter and downsize their belongings, intending on eventually moving in with Greg and his family. She answered the door with a very on-brand cherry disposition, but her mood shifted to one of concern when she saw my bloodshot eyes.¬†

I think John fell into love with my mother for the same reasons he was jealous of Greg. Lucy took life in stride, and this made her ineffably resilient to change and strife. Despite this, my father‚Äôs dementia had undeniably sapped her of some of her effervescence. You could tell that cherry disposition rang slightly hollow nowadays. That being said, her ability to still conjure and maintain the disposition, even if slightly hollow, is perhaps the utmost attestation to her resilience.¬†

After assisting her with various tasks that morning, we sat down at the kitchen table for lunch and I finally manifested the courage to show her some of the logs. I only brought bits and pieces for review, not wanting to disconcert her with the more violent imagery. John never mentioned any 10-foot tall ‚ÄúAtlas‚Äù to her, she remarked with a characteristic chortle. Credit where credit is due, the abruptness and absurdity of that question is objectively funny, and Lucy was still able to find humor in these darker days.¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou know honestly honey, I think it's all just remnants of his mind having a bit of a last hoorah.‚Äù She said after completing her review. ‚ÄúI know this has cut you so deeply, especially since you were busy with your residency training the last few years. You have enough on your plate with what happened to Wren, try not to overburden yourself‚Äù.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think it's odd that dad was able to write this, in secret, while on hospice? With us needing to help him with everything like we did‚Äù?

Lucy had to take a moment to determine her impression of that statement. Eventually, she replied: ‚ÄúI think dad spent his last few years in a power struggle with his dementia, whether he appreciated it or not. I know you weren‚Äôt around to see this, but some days were great, he was almost himself.‚Äù She paused and decided to rephrase the last statement: ‚ÄúWell no that‚Äôs not quite right, he was always himself, to his last day. On his good days though, he had¬†*the ability*¬†to act like himself. This would include writing, as you well know‚Äù

‚ÄúYou never saw him writing¬†*anything*¬†while visiting him at hospice?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, Pete, nothing, but that doesn‚Äôt mean he couldn‚Äôt or that he didn‚Äôt. Also you know how overworked the aides are in the memory unit - just because they didn‚Äôt see or don‚Äôt remember seeing him write, doesn‚Äôt mean he didn‚Äôt or couldn‚Äôt‚Äù. I can tell, just barely, that I had pinched a nerve.¬†

We were silent for a while after that, cooling down from the exchange.¬†

‚ÄúIt reminds me a lot of the way he would write his research, actually. I wish we could ask Majorie‚Äù she said, solemnly¬†

This is the turning point.¬†

‚ÄúWait, that's a great idea. Why can‚Äôt we ask her?‚Äù

Majorie, as a reminder, was dad‚Äôs co-researcher at CellCept. They had met in graduate school and were fast friends in spite of the large, fifthteen year age gap. As you might imagine, there were not a lot of options for academic kinship when my dad was earning his PhD - cellular topography is a niche avenue of investigation now, to my understanding, let alone back in the 80s (see[¬†post 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1fvm64g/after_my_father_died_i_found_a_logbook_concealed/)¬†for a more complete description). Lucy and Majorie had also gotten along very well, but in a flash of realization I now appreciated that I had not seen them together since I graduated middle school.¬†

Lucy put her hand to her mouth, coming to terms with the fact that she had let something slip: ‚ÄúWell, shoot. We didn‚Äôt want to tell you when you were a kid, love. It was right after dad‚Äôs crash - you were still very shaken up about death and dying.‚Äù

‚ÄúMajorie‚Ä¶is dead?‚Äù I asked, disbelief taking hold of me

From here, Lucy filled in a few critical gaps in the story. After John‚Äôs crash, Majorie went on to be the sole researcher on a project that they had both recently been promoted for. CellCept was a pharmaceutical company interested in developing medications targeted at improving human longevity at the cellular level. They had both been working there since grad school (so at least a decade) without a sizable increase in their pay before this new project. The goal was this: another branch of the company had found a line of uniquely immortal stem cells, and it became John and Marjorie‚Äôs job to try to determine on a cellular level why that was the case (Lucy thinks these cells were found ‚Äúat autopsy‚Äù of someone who had donated their body to science, but that is all she can remember of their origin). In the timeline, my mom thinks that the promotion occurred in early 2004, predating the first entry in John‚Äôs logbook by a few months at the very least. After the crash put John out of commission, Majorie was expected to work double time at mapping the interior of that infinitely dividing cell line. In the overwhelming chaos of the crash, and in caring for John‚Äôs extensive health needs after he was released from the hospital, Lucy had lost touch with Majorie. She explained to me that her assumption was that Marjorie was absolutely consumed with work, now that she was the only one on the project, and that's why she did not see much of her in those months after the crash. There was a point in time while my dad was recovering that he considered not returning to CellCept - per Lucy, ‚Äúhe had felt more alive in that recovery time then he did since he accepted the job‚Äù. Maybe he would become a stay-at-home dad. Lily, my sister, still had health issues after her childhood cancer that would always benefit from increased supervision.¬†

One night in May of 2004, however, John received an unexpected call from Marjorie‚Äôs wife. Over the last few months she had developed rapid onset neurologic symptoms, and was unlikely to live for more than another week or so. She had been diagnosed with ‚Äúsporadic CJD‚Äù, also known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

CJD is a wildly progressive and incredibly rare entity, estimated to affect about one american in a million per year. Essentially, the pathophysiology involves ‚Äúprions‚Äù - self-propagating proteins that proliferate in brain matter, causing injury and subsequent degradation of neurons. This disease is not well understood, because it is the only disease (that I am aware of) where proteins alone act like an infection. Proteins are the fundamental molecules that allow all cells to function - building blocks to human cells, bacterial cells, viral cells, so on and so on. Canonically, though, they are not really considered to be ‚Äúalive‚Äù. And yet, these proteins are able to ‚Äúinfect‚Äù a human host if prion-infested tissues are consumed (they are cases in Papua New Guinea of aboriginal tribespeople developing a subset of this disease due to ritualistic cannibalism of human brain tissue). There is no treatment, and diagnosis of the disease is usually presumed in patients who have all the cardinal findings of CJD as well as MRI and lab findings that are in support of the diagnosis. However, it is important to note that the only way to definitively make this diagnosis is through a brain biopsy, which is rarely if ever performed due to the risk of spreading the infectious, deadly protein. Most patients die within one year of symptom onset. The punchline of all of this is that the symptoms of CJD are, broadly speaking, the same symptoms as Alzheimer‚Äôs Dementia, John‚Äôs diagnosis. They just occur and progress much quicker. When I asked if she had any seizures, she said Marjorie did. I would later exhaustively research CJD, only to find that seizures are actually incredibly uncommon in a disease that is already a one in a million diagnosis (The National Institutes of Health quotes that less than 3% of cases of CJD are accompanied by seizures). She passed a week after my dad got that phone call. No brain biopsy was ever performed on Marjorie. Because CellCept wanted the project to continue, after Majorie‚Äôs death they threatened John‚Äôs potential severance package and reputation in the field if he did not come back to work. Under that coercion, he did return to CellCept in September of 2005.¬†

I was initially staggered by these revelations. I could tell, with an unexplainable extrasensory insight, that all of this was relevant. I just didn‚Äôt initially know why it was relevant. Seemingly, John experienced all the same symptoms that Marjorie did, she just succumbed to her disease much quicker. Yet, something was amiss here. John certainly did not develop CJD - he would have never lasted so long with that diagnosis. If you look at it from the opposing perspective, Majorie developed all the same symptoms that John,¬†*including*¬†seizures, which do not fit with the diagnosis of CJD, or are at least an exceptionally rare manifestation of an already exceptionally rare disease.¬†

Knowing that digesting this new information would take time, I put it on the backburner and resumed helping Lucy pack. In doing so, I ended up being tasked with taking apart the bedframe in John‚Äôs old room. I say John‚Äôs room, because they had been sleeping in different bedrooms for at least a decade before his death. This was not the sign of a dissolving marriage, rather, John was an impossibly light sleeper and Lucy eventually was diagnosed with sleep apnea and needed to wear a CPAP machine overnight. If you‚Äôre not familiar with how CPAP machines looked in the early 2000s, it is worth a google - they were loud, heavy machines in their infancy. John would have better luck sleeping in the same room as a practicing mariachi band.

As if the last twenty four hours had not already been dizzying enough, in the process of dismantling the wooden bedframe I discovered something hidden in the exact same part of the bed that I had found his logbook. In his hospice room, those papers were sequestered under the mattress in the top left-hand corner. In his old bedroom, I found a singular key taped to the underside of the frame in the same, top left-hand corner. Engraved on the key were the numbers ‚Äú484‚Äù.

As much as I want to finish this, I need to rest. To introduce what is coming in the next post (which may be the penultimate or ultimate post, depending on my energy levels in the coming few days), the SC484 in the phrase ‚Äú*John, put NLRP77 in SC484‚Äù*¬†referred to storage container numbered 484 at a warehouse half an hour from my childhood home. When questioned, Lucy did not know of its existence. No one did.¬†

Days later, I would develop the prerequisite bravery to find and unlock that abhorrent vault. Inside an eight hundred square foot container lay thousands of moth-eaten marble notebooks, stacked in unorganized, schizophrenic piles as well as the final grim piece to understanding the¬†[sigil](https://imgur.com/a/symbol-above-every-entry-Rb2VbHP). John Morrison was correct when he said he knew it wasn‚Äôt the depiction of an eye, or, more accurately, wasn‚Äôt just the depiction of an eye.¬†

Event occurred 3 weeks after divorce proceedings.","MAN SHOOTS FORMER WIFE

BERT LIGGETT SHOOTS MRS. SADIE LIGGETT WITH COLT‚ÄôS REVOLVER

Turns Weapon on Himself and Inflicts Serious if not Fatal Wound.

Herbert L. Liggett shot and instantly killed his former wife, Mrs. Sadie Liggett, last Monday evening and then turned the weapon, a 32 Colt‚Äôs revolver, upon himself and inflicted a serious gun shot wound in his own head.

The deplorable affair occurred in the Palace cafe on North Montana street shortly after 9 o‚Äôclock and it is alleged that Liggett fired three shots at the woman, a fourth shot missed exploding. There were five cartridges in the gun and he saved the last one for himself, sending it crashing through his own skull after he was sure he had killed his former wife. The bullet entered his right temple, coming out over the left eye, destroying his sight. The man is now at the Curtis hospital hovering between life and death and it is thought he cannot live many days.

A coroner‚Äôs inquest was conducted yesterday afternoon at the county courthouse by Coroner L.C. Ford and a verdict was returned that Mrs. Liggett met her death from gun shot wounds inflicted by a gun in the hands of Bert Liggett and that the shooting occurred between 9 and 10 o‚Äôclock Monday evening.

According to evidence submitted by witnesses to the shooting, Liggett had been loitering about the Palace cafe, where his former wife was employed between the hours of 6 o‚Äôclock in the evening and 2 in the morning. He then proceeded to the restaurant and entered through the saloon to the back and entered the cafe through a door entering from the rear of the saloon. He no sooner entered than he saw Mrs. Liggett and began firing at her. She was carrying a cup of coffee across the room when the first shot was fired and it struck her left thumb. With a cry she started for the first booth and was just entering when a second shot was fired. Those in the cafe ran out to get a policeman, but they heard a third and a fourth shot. Examination of the body revealed the fact that two mortal wounds had been inflicted, one entering the head just back of the right ear and one right between the eyes. Although no witnesses could testify as to the second and third shots, it is presumed that the second shot struck the fleeing woman, as she entered into the booth and the other after she had fallen to the floor.

It appears that Mrs. Liggett had married Bert Liggett several years ago. Heavy drinking had been the cause of much domestic unhappiness, it is claimed by those who were intimate with the couple, and that about a year ago Mrs. Liggett decided that they must separate, and she had not lived with him since, although she did not obtain a divorce until three weeks ago. It is alleged that Liggett had often threatened to kill her or do her bodily injury.

The unfortunate woman was born in Missoula 33 years ago. She had lived in Dillon about eight years. Her parents, Mr. and Mrs. O. Neubert, four uncles and aunts, and a sister arrived this morning from Hall, to investigate the tragedy, and her brother, Hugh Neubert, is expected here this evening from California. The remains will be taken to Hall for interment.

Bert Liggett has resided here for about seven years and has worked as a bartender and barber. He has a mother and brother residing here (Dillon Tribune, August 14, 1918, Page A1, A8. via Newspapers.com (https://www.newspapers.com/article/dillon-tribune/156660072/ : accessed October 6, 2024).",2,1728245007.0,DeathCertificates,1,1.0,False

Never in my life have I experienced such severe insomnia as I did after reading the details of John‚Äôs ‚Äúsecond translocation‚Äù. By the time I began attempting to fall asleep that night, It felt like all of the residual thoughts and questions surrounding the contents of that entry had actually begun to occupy physical space in my head. Everytime I restlessly repositioned my head on my pillow I could feel the weight of those ruminations slosh around in my skull, the partially coagulated thoughtform taking a few moments to completely settle out like the fluid in a magic eight ball. Eventually, I gave up on sleep entirely. I resigned myself to replaying the events described in John‚Äôs logbook, trying to inspect each piece of it from every possible angle in order to glean an epiphany, as if that epiphany would act as some sort of mental Ambien. Unfortunately, it became clear that I was still missing some crucial components to this narrative, and I could divine nothing additional from the information I already had absorbed that would pacify my ragged psyche. I needed more.¬†

Cup of coffee in hand, I reluctantly sat back down at my office desk. I glanced over at the clock - 330 AM. After taking a few deep, meditative breathes, I did what I could to brace myself and I flipped over another menu.¬†

For the next several logs I read that night, I don‚Äôt believe there will be any utility to me reproducing them here in their entirety. First and foremost, there is a certain amount of redundancy to some of the entries that may only serve to cast a fog over the throughline of the events described. Maybe more critically, however, is my fear of incompletion. My health has again worsened since the last time I uploaded a post. I am anxious to put a pin in this, so I will use the space below to synthesize those entries in an effort to keep things moving at a reasonable pace. Before I begin, I do feel like I need to address how I scarred my left eye.¬†

Death marches indifferent towards all of us from the moment we are born - sometimes slowly, sometimes rapidly. If you had asked me a year ago which was preferable, assuming you were forced to make a selection, I would say a rapid death, without a single shred of hesitation in my response. Bearing witness to the stepwise loss of my dad‚Äôs identity over the last five years has been indescribably tortuous. And to clarify, I really do mean that it is indescribable. I generally don‚Äôt know the appropriate words to describe the abject horrors of dementia. God knows I‚Äôve tried to find them. It‚Äôs like watching someone‚Äôs soul rot. Each passing day, a new small piece of your loved one is involuntarily divested, dissolving into the atmosphere like steam. But, unlike with my fiance, I did have ample time and space to say my goodbyes, I suppose.¬†

Without any creativity whatsoever, my response to John‚Äôs disease was to bottle up my emotions and turn to liquor as a means to dull my senses. Tale as old as time. Wren, my fiance, tried to help me. But I was ritually intoxicated, forlorn and distracted, and when it mattered most, I did not see the stop sign. In complete contrast to John, I lost her instantaneously. Meanwhile, I only sustained a deep laceration to my left eye and a few fractured ribs. She knew I loved her, thankfully. Learning from John, I had taken the time to let her know how much she meant to me, telling her that she was my kaleidoscope, a comparison that I had adapted from John early in my life. When I looked through her, the bleakness of the world was replaced with a fulfilling radiance. But I have been irreparably guilt stricken from this unforgivable transgression. In another twist of the knife that almost feels poetic, John didn‚Äôt have the wherewithal to talk me through how he processed the guilt of his crash in the context of ignoring the risks of driving with a new seizure disorder by the time my crash occurred.¬†

I need to move on from this topic, otherwise I'll never complete this. Just know that after the events of the last year I don‚Äôt have such a clear cut answer for which death is worse, not anymore.¬†

  
Selected excerpt 1: April, 2005

*‚Äú\[...\] One thing I have noticed upon reflection is that some of my memories in the past few years do not feel completely my own. I have spent months recovering from my crash (seizure and seemingly translocation free, thankfully), which has allowed me the opportunity to review my cache of recollections in full. From at least the year 2000 and on, I feel like I have only the imprints of my memories - they are just files stored on a biological harddrive. I can access them, open and close them, but I do not feel like I myself experienced them. Lucy attributes this all to the stress of my position at CellCept, with a resulting depression draining those more recent memories of their inherent technicolor. I have considered this, but I am not so sure. Although I have taken the time to confirm these abnormally textured memories are not false, i.e. confirmed with others that they did actually happen as I can recollect them, I just do not feel I was there when they were made. But I clearly was \[...\]‚Äù*

An important insight. I will come back to it soon.¬†



Most of the entries before and directly after his crash are very introspective and well put together. After explaining his theorem regarding why sound disappears with the arrival of Atlas in his translocations and how that could represent the ‚Äúinverse of a memory‚Äù (see the end of [post 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1fwf1w2/after_my_father_died_i_found_a_logbook_concealed/)), he does pick up where he left off in trying to prove the existence and scientific underpinnings of his translocations. To save you all the trouble, I have omitted most of the entries dedicated to systematically proving his translocations. Personally, I had grappled with the ‚Äúnoise canceling headphones‚Äù metaphor and how that relates to everything for quite awhile before I felt like I had a vague idea what he was trying to relay. Little did I know that this was the equivalent of kindergarten arts and crafts when compared to his subsequently described theorems. If you have a PhD in calculus, biophysics and electromagnetism, feel free to message me privately and I‚Äôll send over some pictures. For us laypeople, it‚Äôs best to skip ahead to this next piece:¬†



Selected excerpt 2: July, 2005

*‚Äú\[...\] the biophysical motion as calculated does seem mathematically sound. However, to complete my postulates, I will need to perform an experiment in spacial relativity. To do this, I will need to adopt a sort of metaphysical vigilance. At some point, I expect I will begin translocating again. When I do, I will need to somehow recognize that my consciousness is out of its expected position in spacetime before Atlas makes its presence known. To this end, and to Lucy‚Äôs very pleasing chagrin related to a lack of spousal consultation, I went out and got my first tattoo this morning. Specifically, one of the logos for The Smashing Pumpkins covering the majority of my right forearm (the one with the heart and ‚ÄúSP‚Äù in the center). My reasoning is this: if my consciousness is receding into a memory, I think I should recall what was and not what currently is. Therefore, it stands to reason that if I‚Äôm mid-translocation, in a memory, I will NOT have this tattoo on my forearm. There are a few caveats here: first and foremost, it is possible that I will simply merge how I am now with how I was then, resulting in me visualizing myself with the tattoo on my arm even though it would not have happened yet. If the countless studies on the unreliability of courtroom eyewitness misidentification are any indication, our memories are very fallible and subject to external forces. Second, if in the future I am translocating to a memory that occurs AFTER I got my tattoo, this will obviously not be very helpful. Lastly, even if it does work, I do not know for sure that the evidence I am looking for will even be perceptible to me. If this works however, and I am able to appreciate that I am translocating before Atlas arrives, I hope that I can find my tether \[...\]‚Äù*

There are no entries dated between July 2005 and the end of 2007. In early 2008, they resumed, but they actually just start over with the description of his initial translocation, with some differences. The first appreciable difference is the time stamp. The second and more disturbing difference is how they fracture and devolve.¬†



Excerpt from March 2008:

*First translocation.*

*The morning of the first translocation was like any other. I awoke around 9AM, Lucy was already out of bed and probably had been for some time. Peter and Lily had really become a handful over the last few years, and Lucy would need help giving Lily her medications.*¬†

*Wearily, I stood at the top of our banister, surveying the beautiful disaster that was raising young children (immediate, harsh scribbles directly after the world children)*

*John, put NLRP77 in SC484. John, put NLRP77 in SC484. John, put NLRP77 in SC484. John, put NLRP77 in SC484. John, put NLRP77 in SC484.* *John, put NLRP77 in SC484. John, put NLRP77 in SC484.

*I then began to appreciate the figure before me. He stood at least 10 feet tall. His arms and legs were the same proportions, which gave his upper extremities an unnatural length. which gave his upper extremities an unnatural length.*

*His skin was taught and tented and taught and tented and taught and tented on both of his wrists, tired flesh rising about a foot symmetrically above each hand. Dried blood streaks led up to a center point of the stretched skin, where a fountain of mercurial silver erupted upwards. Following the silver with my eyesFollowing the silver with my eyesFollowing the silver with my eyesFollowing the silver with my eyesFollowing the silver with my eyesFollowing the silver with my eyes\[...\]‚Äù*

It continues like that for a while, then cuts off into more scribbles. Of note, the scribbles were intercut with sketches of the sigil ([see here for reference](https://imgur.com/a/symbol-above-every-entry-Rb2VbH)). There are a lot of entries like this, with the only new dialogue being ‚Äú*John, put NLRP77 in SC484*‚Äù. None of those numbers meant anything to me the first time I read them.¬†

When I looked up from my desk, dawn had apparently arrived. I had maybe ten or so entries left to go, but I decided to stop for now. I had obligations to attend to, involving Lucy, my mother. I knew I had to ask her about the deathbed logbook, but I dreaded it deeply. Not because I was afraid of her reaction or her emotional state after reading it, or that I was under the impression she would not know anything, very much the opposite - I was afraid of what she might know.¬†

I carried my sleep deprived body over to the house I had grown up in. After John‚Äôs passing, my mom had planned on finally taking the time to declutter and downsize their belongings, intending on eventually moving in with Greg and his family. She answered the door with a very on-brand cherry disposition, but her mood shifted to one of concern when she saw my bloodshot eyes.¬†

I think John fell into love with my mother for the same reasons he was jealous of Greg. Lucy took life in stride, and this made her ineffably resilient to change and strife. Despite this, my father‚Äôs dementia had undeniably sapped her of some of her effervescence. You could tell that cherry disposition rang slightly hollow nowadays. That being said, her ability to still conjure and maintain the disposition, even if slightly hollow, is perhaps the utmost attestation to her resilience.¬†

After assisting her with various tasks that morning, we sat down at the kitchen table for lunch and I finally manifested the courage to show her some of the logs. I only brought bits and pieces for review, not wanting to disconcert her with the more violent imagery. John never mentioned any 10-foot tall ‚ÄúAtlas‚Äù to her, she remarked with a characteristic chortle. Credit where credit is due, the abruptness and absurdity of that question is objectively funny, and Lucy was still able to find humor in these darker days.¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou know honestly honey, I think it's all just remnants of his mind having a bit of a last hoorah.‚Äù She said after completing her review. ‚ÄúI know this has cut you so deeply, especially since you were busy with your residency training the last few years. You have enough on your plate with what happened to Wren, try not to overburden yourself‚Äù.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think it's odd that dad was able to write this, in secret, while on hospice? With us needing to help him with everything like we did‚Äù?

Lucy had to take a moment to determine her impression of that statement. Eventually, she replied: ‚ÄúI think dad spent his last few years in a power struggle with his dementia, whether he appreciated it or not. I know you weren‚Äôt around to see this, but some days were great, he was almost himself.‚Äù She paused and decided to rephrase the last statement: ‚ÄúWell no that‚Äôs not quite right, he was always himself, to his last day. On his good days though, he had *the ability* to act like himself. This would include writing, as you well know‚Äù

‚ÄúYou never saw him writing *anything* while visiting him at hospice?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, Pete, nothing, but that doesn‚Äôt mean he couldn‚Äôt or that he didn‚Äôt. Also you know how overworked the aides are in the memory unit - just because they didn‚Äôt see or don‚Äôt remember seeing him write, doesn‚Äôt mean he didn‚Äôt or couldn‚Äôt‚Äù. I can tell, just barely, that I had pinched a nerve.¬†

We were silent for a while after that, cooling down from the exchange.¬†

‚ÄúIt reminds me a lot of the way he would write his research, actually. I wish we could ask Majorie‚Äù she said, solemnly¬†

This is the turning point.¬†

‚ÄúWait, that's a great idea. Why can‚Äôt we ask her?‚Äù

Majorie, as a reminder, was dad‚Äôs co-researcher at CellCept. They had met in graduate school and were fast friends in spite of the large, fifthteen year age gap. As you might imagine, there were not a lot of options for academic kinship when my dad was earning his PhD - cellular topography is a niche avenue of investigation now, to my understanding, let alone back in the 80s (see[ post 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1fvm64g/after_my_father_died_i_found_a_logbook_concealed/) for a more complete description). Lucy and Majorie had also gotten along very well, but in a flash of realization I now appreciated that I had not seen them together since I graduated middle school.¬†

Lucy put her hand to her mouth, coming to terms with the fact that she had let something slip: ‚ÄúWell, shoot. We didn‚Äôt want to tell you when you were a kid, love. It was right after dad‚Äôs crash - you were still very shaken up about death and dying.‚Äù

‚ÄúMajorie‚Ä¶is dead?‚Äù I asked, disbelief taking hold of me



From here, Lucy filled in a few critical gaps in the story. After John‚Äôs crash, Majorie went on to be the sole researcher on a project that they had both recently been promoted for. CellCept was a pharmaceutical company interested in developing medications targeted at improving human longevity at the cellular level. They had both been working there since grad school (so at least a decade) without a sizable increase in their pay before this new project. The goal was this: another branch of the company had found a line of uniquely immortal stem cells, and it became John and Marjorie‚Äôs job to try to determine on a cellular level why that was the case (Lucy thinks these cells were found ‚Äúat autopsy‚Äù of someone who had donated their body to science, but that is all she can remember of their origin). In the timeline, my mom thinks that the promotion occurred in early 2004, predating the first entry in John‚Äôs logbook by a few months at the very least. After the crash put John out of commission, Majorie was expected to work double time at mapping the interior of that infinitely dividing cell line. In the overwhelming chaos of the crash, and in caring for John‚Äôs extensive health needs after he was released from the hospital, Lucy had lost touch with Majorie. She explained to me that her assumption was that Marjorie was absolutely consumed with work, now that she was the only one on the project, and that's why she did not see much of her in those months after the crash. There was a point in time while my dad was recovering that he considered not returning to CellCept - per Lucy, ‚Äúhe had felt more alive in that recovery time then he did since he accepted the job‚Äù. Maybe he would become a stay-at-home dad. Lily, my sister, still had health issues after her childhood cancer that would always benefit from increased supervision.¬†

One night in May of 2004, however, John received an unexpected call from Marjorie‚Äôs wife. Over the last few months she had developed rapid onset neurologic symptoms, and was unlikely to live for more than another week or so. She had been diagnosed with ‚Äúsporadic CJD‚Äù, also known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

CJD is a wildly progressive and incredibly rare entity, estimated to affect about one american in a million per year. Essentially, the pathophysiology involves ‚Äúprions‚Äù - self-propagating proteins that proliferate in brain matter, causing injury and subsequent degradation of neurons. This disease is not well understood, because it is the only disease (that I am aware of) where proteins alone act like an infection. Proteins are the fundamental molecules that allow all cells to function - building blocks to human cells, bacterial cells, viral cells, so on and so on. Canonically, though, they are not really considered to be ‚Äúalive‚Äù. And yet, these proteins are able to ‚Äúinfect‚Äù a human host if prion-infested tissues are consumed (they are cases in Papua New Guinea of aboriginal tribespeople developing a subset of this disease due to ritualistic cannibalism of human brain tissue). There is no treatment, and diagnosis of the disease is usually presumed in patients who have all the cardinal findings of CJD as well as MRI and lab findings that are in support of the diagnosis. However, it is important to note that the only way to definitively make this diagnosis is through a brain biopsy, which is rarely if ever performed due to the risk of spreading the infectious, deadly protein. Most patients die within one year of symptom onset. The punchline of all of this is that the symptoms of CJD are, broadly speaking, the same symptoms as Alzheimer‚Äôs Dementia, John‚Äôs diagnosis. They just occur and progress much quicker. When I asked if she had any seizures, she said Marjorie did. I would later exhaustively research CJD, only to find that seizures are actually incredibly uncommon in a disease that is already a one in a million diagnosis (The National Institutes of Health quotes that less than 3% of cases of CJD are accompanied by seizures). She passed a week after my dad got that phone call. No brain biopsy was ever performed on Marjorie. Because CellCept wanted the project to continue, after Majorie‚Äôs death they threatened John‚Äôs potential severance package and reputation in the field if he did not come back to work. Under that coercion, he did return to CellCept in September of 2005.¬†

I was initially staggered by these revelations. I could tell, with an unexplainable extrasensory insight, that all of this was relevant. I just didn‚Äôt initially know why it was relevant. Seemingly, John experienced all the same symptoms that Marjorie did, she just succumbed to her disease much quicker. Yet, something was amiss here. John certainly did not develop CJD - he would have never lasted so long with that diagnosis. If you look at it from the opposing perspective, Majorie developed all the same symptoms that John, *including* seizures, which do not fit with the diagnosis of CJD, or are at least an exceptionally rare manifestation of an already exceptionally rare disease.¬†

Knowing that digesting this new information would take time, I put it on the backburner and resumed helping Lucy pack. In doing so, I ended up being tasked with taking apart the bedframe in John‚Äôs old room. I say John‚Äôs room, because they had been sleeping in different bedrooms for at least a decade before his death. This was not the sign of a dissolving marriage, rather, John was an impossibly light sleeper and Lucy eventually was diagnosed with sleep apnea and needed to wear a CPAP machine overnight. If you‚Äôre not familiar with how CPAP machines looked in the early 2000s, it is worth a google - they were loud, heavy machines in their infancy. John would have better luck sleeping in the same room as a practicing mariachi band.

As if the last twenty four hours had not already been dizzying enough, in the process of dismantling the wooden bedframe I discovered something hidden in the exact same part of the bed that I had found his logbook. In his hospice room, those papers were sequestered under the mattress in the top left-hand corner. In his old bedroom, I found a singular key taped to the underside of the frame in the same, top left-hand corner. Engraved on the key were the numbers ‚Äú484‚Äù.

As much as I want to finish this, I need to rest. To introduce what is coming in the next post (which may be the penultimate or ultimate post, depending on my energy levels in the coming few days), the SC484 in the phrase ‚Äú*John, put NLRP77 in SC484‚Äù* referred to storage container numbered 484 at a warehouse half an hour from my childhood home. When questioned, Lucy did not know of its existence. No one did.¬†

Days later, I would develop the prerequisite bravery to find and unlock that abhorrent vault. Inside an eight hundred square foot container lay thousands of moth-eaten marble notebooks, stacked in unorganized, schizophrenic piles as well as the final grim piece to understanding the [sigil](https://imgur.com/a/symbol-above-every-entry-Rb2VbHP). John Morrison was correct when he said he knew it wasn‚Äôt the depiction of an eye, or, more accurately, wasn‚Äôt just the depiction of an eye.¬†

During those two weeks, our realtor would treat us to Tim's coffee, picked up at one of Moncton's (then) 21 locations. It was during the *Rrroll-Up-The-Rim* promotion, but during our two-week stay, we never once got a winning cup, which I believe was against the statistical odds of a win.

We flew out of Halifax, N.S., at the end of our stay; we were waiting at the boarding gate for our flight at the Halifax Airport, and I said, ""Hey ... I'll run to Tim Horton's and get us both a coffee.""

Hi everyone!

Just a little background on my situation- a little over a year ago (Sept 2023) I took my first international trip outside of the US. I went to Ireland & Scotland with a tour group of ladies. I met a guy on hinge while I was just looking for recommendations from locals in each city. Didn‚Äôt really have any intention to meet up, was really just looking for the good spots to check out. We chatted a lot, really hit it off, but I was only in his area for one night so we didn‚Äôt have a chance to meet up. We kept in contact while I continued to travel, he gave recommendations here and there and then once I got home, we still continued to talk everyday. Sending memes, sharing laughs, and venting about our day to day problems. May 2024 I had booked a trip back to Ireland with a friend to explore more and take the countryside a little slower. I planned to be back in his city near the end of my trip so we could meet up and see if we hit it off. We had the best first date I‚Äôve ever had. He picked me up from the hotel, we went to a market to get some breakfast, drove about an hour to a spot for hiking, while stopping at cute little towns and coffee shops along the way. After talking and hiking for hours, he dropped me back at the hotel and we planned to meet up for dinner. Picked me back up for dinner, then parked near the water to watch the northern lights. Such a good night. 
He stopped by once more after work to see me before I had to fly home. We both just clicked so well immediately. He works overnights and overtime often, so his schedule is very difficult.
After I got back home, we continued to talk everyday. I had a flight credit that I had already booked back to Ireland before I even met him, so it didn‚Äôt go to waste. I mentioned it while we were together and he said great, we will see how things go between now and then.
September came up quickly. The month before i mentioned that it would be fun to come back to Ireland but id love to take advantage of the cheap flights from Ireland to somewhere else in Europe. So we booked flights and hotels for Spain. I was soooo excited.
We went on the trip and had such a good time. We went all over Spain and just complimented each other‚Äôs travel styles so well. We seemed to be on the same page about everything. 
While getting to know him more, I can tell he has a little wall up overall because he has been hurt really badly by someone he loved in the past. 
So we get to the end of the trip and I ask him where he sees things going between us and he tells me, he‚Äôs just not sure how it would work with the distance. He said with the way his schedule is and how far apart we are, we seem to be setting ourselves up for heartbreak. That I am going to grow tired of him not being able to give me the time and energy that I deserve and I‚Äôll eventually break up with him. That is not how I am as a person. If I am fully invested in someone, then I will put up with the distance for now while we figure out the rest. He told me with the stress of his job, he wants someone in person. I‚Äôm trying not to be upset, because I think he just doesn‚Äôt trust me enough yet (we have only been together in person a couple times- one being a long Spain trip) and is very afraid to get hurt. He wants to continue talking and see where things go but I‚Äôm kinda discouraged and confused. If he doesn‚Äôt want to do distance then I don‚Äôt see why we are still talking.
On the flip side of this, since I visited Ireland for the first time, I knew I wanted to live there. This is with or without him being in my life. I am planning to vacation/work from there for a month next year to test it out and see if it‚Äôs something I really want. He is aware of this but he just doesn‚Äôt want to be the reason why I‚Äôm moving overall in case things don‚Äôt work out between us. I‚Äôm sure we would see each other while I‚Äôm there. I would probably be staying 1.5 hours from where he is at, so it would still be long distance.
Anyways, I guess I‚Äôm just looking for some advice on how to navigate this situation. I got home last week from our trip, the texting and communication are still the same but I‚Äôm just feeling upset that he doesn‚Äôt want to progress things with me right now. Maybe he just isn‚Äôt there yet? Which I understand, but it‚Äôs getting past the feeling like I‚Äôm not enough to jump in with both feet for. Also I know it likely doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with me. If he needs an in person relationship then I understand that long distance would not be appealing but we both like each other so much. He said we would absolutely be dating if we lived closer but the long distance just wouldn‚Äôt make sense right now with how little spare time he has. The next time we would ideally see each other might be 6 months from now. I could book something sooner but I‚Äôm confused on how much energy I should be putting in at this point.

**Hey everyone,**


I‚Äôm a bit of an introvert with a playful streak ‚Äì I love teasing and joking around with the people I care about, but when the moment calls for it, I can be surprisingly thoughtful and serious. I guess it‚Äôs about striking that balance that keeps things interesting.

I‚Äôm 23, and I‚Äôve got a pretty diverse set of interests. I‚Äôm really into spiritual practices, and I‚Äôm currently diving deep into Sanskrit grammar (yes, it‚Äôs as fascinating as it sounds). I‚Äôm studying it as a core subject and hoping to build a career around it one day. Aside from that, I enjoy gaming as an occasional escape, reading to feed my curiosity, and staying active with fitness. I also love getting into debates about philosophy and ancient texts ‚Äì I find it‚Äôs a great way to keep growing and challenge myself.

Now, when it comes to relationships, I‚Äôm pretty straightforward ‚Äì no need to complicate things. Loyalty and strong character are everything to me, and I believe love and commitment should go hand in hand. I‚Äôm looking for someone who‚Äôs not just a good communicator, but also knows when to be silent and let moments speak for themselves. I think sometimes, a simple connection can say more than words ever could.

I‚Äôm not expecting to find someone who shares *all* my interests, but I do hope to meet someone who values loyalty and mutual respect. Maybe she‚Äôs hardworking and traditional in some ways, but with her own thoughts, dreams, and aspirations. I believe it‚Äôs the character that makes a lasting bond, more than anything else.

Whether you're here for something casual or a long-term commitment, I‚Äôm open to getting to know you. If we click and you‚Äôre looking for the same kind of connection, I‚Äôll be fully in ‚Äì loyalty is key for me when the bond is real.

At the end of the day, I‚Äôm looking for a trustworthy companion, someone I can depend on and share my life with. If you value simplicity, loyalty, and genuine connection, I‚Äôd love to hear from you.

Feel free to DM if you'd like to talk more or share some interests! Looking forward to meeting you.",1,1728244392.0,find_a_date,0,1.0,False

During this time, it kept running through my mind the same curiosity I‚Äôve always had. What it was like to date a woman. I‚Äôve always had crushes on girls and really always thought about one day being with another girl but I never took a step in that direction. 

As I was exploring these thoughts mentally, I explored dating apps that catered to curious women. It felt freeing but also extremely different like something so foreign. After some time just swiping, I came across and matched with one of my long term friends. Her and I ended up messaging as she was shocked to see me on there and was wondering if I was really on there. I knew she was bi and recently single but I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd see her. 

She ended up asking me out to get coffee and just talk about things since I was confused. Her and I met up had coffee and ended up talking about pretty much everything related to my thoughts and curiosity. She invited me back over to her place after coffee and just to relax and talk more. Needless to say things only escalated. We ended up seeing each other a few more times before she asked me to be serious with her. I was super hesitant. I ended up saying yes but that I was scared to come out. She told me it was okay and that she wants to help along the journey.

Hi, I (m 32) met online a girl (f 29). It clicked almost immediately and we set a first date a couple of days after meeting online. We kissed briefly for a goodbye on the second date. I told her I was intersex on the fourth date. For context, we didn't rush things. The dates were typical - a restaurant, coffee shop, cinema. The third date was in public and she had to quickly leave not to miss the train home.

On that fourth date, I asked her to talk in a quiet place and explained everything, answering every question she had. She didn't take it very well. Nonetheless, she decided to stay and continue our relationship. After a year of our relationship, she decided that she didn't believe I was intersex (I have obvious physical features), and what in her opinion was the worst thing is that I waited too long to tell her the truth.

1. AITA for telling her I was intersex on the fourth meeting? 

2. She says I am TA because she was already very invested and I took advantage of that. She thinks if I was telling her the truth I would present her with all my medical records. She asked them after a year, and at that point I told her no. In my opinion in that point of the relationship (after having sex with me so many times) she should have trusted me.

Some time has passed since she left me but I'm still thinking about that as I was left with a guilt that I don't totally feel. What should I have done differently? I am thinking mostly about the relationship to come.",2,1728243965.0,AITA_Relationships,4,1.0,False

But it doesn't make sense that one is instantly seen as an ""adult"" preying on a ""child"" (instead of a teenager). For example, with Drew and Zoe, I keep seeing posts accusing Drew of grooming Zoe (even though they're like 3 years apart, and he would have barely been 18 at the time). I've even seen this same thing with people accusing Spinner/ Jane of being grooming, and this was a 2-year age gap (""Why is a fully-grown man at a nearby coffee shop who should be out of high school hitting on a CHILD at the school"")

I even wanted to touch on Matt (Mr. Oleander) and Paige. I want to make it clear I don't think as an assistant teacher, he should have been dating any students ever and should have been fired. However, it seems odd if people are accusing him of grooming and pedophilia when the age gap was 3 years. A 3 year age gap, even one where the older person had a position of authority over the younger one, and this made it inappropriate, I don't see how it would be pedophilia with such a small age difference, or that one is a fully-grown adult and the other is just a little child, despite being a teenager who is almost graduating high school, and the other is still college age. So based on that, he shouldn't have dated her at all, but I wouldn't put him on the same level as Mr Yates or Coach Carson. (Basically, he was inappropriate due to his power dynamic and deserved to be fired, but isn't a literal pedophile either). 

Peoples brains grow gradually. You aren't the same at 16 as when you were 11. You aren't the same at 18 as when you are 25. I don't have any actual interest in defending people who genuinely harm others, and want to do the exact opposite, but when it comes to age gaps, it doesn't make much sense, specifically when people look at an 18 year old with a much older adult (like over 30 even) and see it as 2 consenting adults, but also think a 2/3 year age gap between a 15-17 year old and an 18-20 year old as pedophilia and grooming.

Anyways, re the missed connection. Had coffee at Habitual yesterday/this Sunday, and had a very good feeling na eye to eye contact with this guy who was there as I was waiting for my take out order. He was packing up and dun na kami nagkatinginan and as woman, we are most of the time, never wrong about gut feeling. And I swear, I really felt weird (but good kind of weird ?? when I met eyes with this guy). Mej natagalan lang sa order ko and he left.

Got my order and sakto na palabas ako, he was there in front, as if nag double take siya; instead of walking to Kodawari/Wildflour/Crosta path, he went back and started walking to Aparment 1A (?) restaurant and headed to Ayala Triangle Park. So, ako naman, chill lang. Baka namali lang siya and I walked behind him but I crossed the street, so dun na ako sa path ng Apartment 1A heading to PSBank main office and he was headed to Paseo Center.

Dun sa crossing ng Valero, nakatawid na ako kasi pwede na and as a loser, I was just ""forget about this you are watching way too much early 90s romcoms"" so I just walked pa stairs ng underpass to the park.

Napalingon ako sa Paseo Center side and I saw him keeping up pace with me. Again, as a loser, I ignored and as I was about to go pababa na sa stairs, I saw him, less than 5 secs away from the stairs sa side ng Paseo Center, looking at my direction, as if checking na bababa din ba ako. Again, a loser, so I ignored it. Delulu lang ako.

Nung nakababa na ako, obviously, nauna ako, I heard loud footsteps and yung escalators may glass di ba. Nakita ko yung reflection ng shoes niya: air jordans low cut in aquatone. That's one of the things I remember. Nagmamadali siya bumaba. And as a loser who don't have much experience, I took a sharp turn and just walked like nothing is happening. Hindi na ako nag look back kasi nahihiya ako, I guess?? 

Nakapasok na ako ng park and as I was about to reach the big space where they setup the stages during events, he eventually caught up to me. I know he made a short run because he slowed down on my left as I slowly walked (I was reading a message on my phone) and in my peripheral vision, I saw him looked down on me and he just walked pa MSE side. 

I'm also bipolar and nagka manic episode ata ako so I sat down muna sa bench to calm down. Again, loser na shunga na watched too many romcoms, I said na maglakad ako sa restaurants side and if nagkita uli kami sa may underpass stairs or sa side ng Ayala ANE Buendia bound, meant to be kami. (Lel praning lang)

Di ko na siya nakita.

Pasensya na naging vent out na but yeah so just trying out my luck here. 

Aside from the air jordans na low cut in aquatone, looks artsy, indie, bookish type. He has a macbook. Short, almost around the nape wavy hair. Wears glasses. Has minimal facial hair. He was also wearing a tagpi-tagpi style ng jacket (na mukhang mamahalin) and the back is half dark green/half beige/almost dirty white ish color. Height is around 5'9"" to 5'11"" max. Fair skin. Pa medium build. Malapad likod niya. Sturdy so di siya payat na tatangayin ng hangin. I know he's from around the area kasi ang liit ng tote bag niya. Enough to fit the macbook and wallet, I guess.

This was around 5pm to 5:30pm. So if naglakad kayo din around Salcedo, Triangle, Legazpi Greenbelt area, baka nakita niyo siya lol again just trying my luck ü§û 

I just really have a good feeling with this guy. He's so my type and I want to at least introduce myself to him. Gusto ko lang matahimik ang kaluluwa ko.

So, yun lang po. Pasensya na po in advance if this is the incorrect space. Thank you for listening and happy work week.

1fxolri,https://www.reddit.com/r/recycling/comments/1fxolri/keurigstyle_coffee_podswhy_not/,Keurig-style coffee pods--why not?," I am well aware that coffee pods are bad for the environment and I've been told they're ""impossible to recycle"" which is one reason why I have never used them. (The other reason is that I generally drink 35-70 ounces of coffee a day so an individual K-cup is not only cost ineffective but doesn't save any effort or time.)

However, I do have a coffee maker that, in addition to the normal basket, has an adaptor for use with K-cups. And, for reasons too complicated to get into, I have recently come into possession of a free box of 96 K-cup s (not Keurig but that form factor). They are bought and paid for and will need to be disposed of either way so I may as well use them.

My question is, why should I not be able to recycle them? After using one to make a cup of coffee I opened it up and it's just a #5 plastic (PP) container with a tiny filter and coffee in it. The filter and coffee were easily removable and can be composted and my city accepts #5 plastic for recycling so what would be the issue here? I've always been told they were next to impossible to recycle but that doesn't seem to make a lot of sense now that I've opened one up and seen what's inside.",1,1728242801.0,recycling,2,1.0,False

I'd love to know your thoughts on that.

Additionally, I'm curious what you think about whether or not >!Tommy knows/knew that Des & Liam had found a shipwreck & treasure and were cutting him out. I think not because at one point he mentions how Liam was living on a quarter of the family business' income & Tommy doesn't know how since the Keelys are barely surviving on it.!<

My big toe also isn‚Äôt super close to the head of the shoe (distance represented somewhat by my thumb) but I do prefer that generally since anything closer usually squishes my feet and makes it painful. 

Should I aim for something more snug? This is the first pair of nice dress shoes I‚Äôve ever bought or owned. I‚Äôm not sure if I shpuld expect them to loosen more or get more snug. Should I ask for a smaller size? 

Also, I noticed the glue job on the insole is kinda messy. Is this common? I don‚Äôt mind that much since it‚Äôs on the inside but I was a bit shocked. 

Maybe I‚Äôm just overthinking this. I‚Äôve never spent this much on a pair of shoes in my life so any advice is appreciated! ",0,1728242185.0,ThursdayBoot,2,0.25,False

I‚Äôm in the process of furnishing my small apartment and could use some advice to nail down the design. I‚Äôve got natural oak parquet flooring, and I‚Äôm visualizing a kitchen where the cabinets are in a light kashmir/sand color (I‚Äôve attached a mockup). The wooden-like cabinets, dining table, countertop, and outlets are where I‚Äôm feeling stuck.

I like the idea of the wood matching the floor, but I‚Äôm open to experimenting with other finishes for the wooden elements if it makes sense. My apartment is small, so I‚Äôm trying to keep everything cohesive and simple, especially since the carpenter making the kitchen will also do my bed and coffee table. I want everything to flow together, but I‚Äôm no design expert.

The only other thing I‚Äôve decided on is a brick red or barn red sofa for the living room. Apart from that, I‚Äôm pretty flexible and open to ideas. What wood finishes, color combos, or materials do you think would work well with the oak floor and red sofa?

I appreciate any tips or suggestions!

Thanks a lot! :)

I am on either week 4 or week 8 of this (not sure if the first month I was feeling bad was mono related, but September is when all the crazy sick symptoms came along).

I was hospitalized for a couple days last week and that is how I found out I have mono. I was hospitalized for also developing pneumonia, which I think the hospital killed off with its IV antibiotics.

Now that I know I have mono, it puts a different tint on how I have been viewing this constant state of feeling bad. One of the weird things is that it feels like whenever I do any type of activity right now, the fatigue worsens and creates this feeling that my brain is shutting down. It is worse than a headache, but more like a nervous system freakout. I went on a 30 minute walk yesterday and it put me in a place where I felt groggy, nauseous, in pain, and unable to keep my head out of a pillow. It makes it hard to think, ibuprofen / acetaminophen doesn't help, and ice packs on my neck only loosely help. Today, I went to a coffee shop with my roommate for 45 minutes, and just having to have a prolonged conversation and sit in the very hot car seems to have triggered this for me right now.

Does this sound about right for mono? Like, doing ANY activity with my body causes this to happen. Sometimes, just existing throughout the day causes this type of flare up to happen around nighttime. This is the hardest part of this illness for me, and it has been stopping me from being a normal person for 2 months now with no end in sight.

I'm feeling isolated going from a really social environment to living alone with no one around. I contacted my old school mates who are local and didn't go to uni and feel like we're not on the same page anymore. Everyone else is living at home with their parents which is fair game but I don't really want them coming back to my flat to socialise so it gives me the option to leave early if I get tired without having to end the night for everyone else. I've noticed there's two categories they're all fitting into. Sleeping until past midday, couldn't keep a job for the past four years and unreliable. The second being working full time as many hours as they can get and having no time to socialise and go out one evening, doesn't drink and sleeps early, which is perfectly fine.

This has left me sitting in my flat for a month now and the loneliness is creeping in. I was meant to meet a friend and left after an hour of waiting for them only to find out they had overslept until the afternoon. I even double checked with them the night before if the plans were still happening because I takes me ages to travel there. I just felt defeated after this and still waiting for someone to tell me any good days when they're free to organise something. I took this as the last time I'd put in the effort to be the one to organise things again. I still hadn't met anyone yet. I can't meet my uni friends because they've moved back home to the other end of the country. There was also group drama when I wasnt there so I don't have many people to talk to now people left the group.

How can I meet more people? When I leave the house to go to a coffee shop or gym or just go on a walk I've never met someone that way. I'm not brave enough to go to the club or a bar alone.

I would like to first off start by saying that he isn‚Äôt a bad man or father. Yes we have had our fights and we have both been asses at times. I‚Äôm not perfect either, like at all. 

I got pregnant on my birthday in 2012. Four months after we started dating. He was supportive in every way possible. He told me he would be there whatever I decided to do and that even if I wanted to end the pregnancy he would be there to get me through it. He is amazing with animals, extremely talented artist and can build or fix anything you put in front of him. 

Over the last 3 years, we have not gone on a single date, he barely talks to me, he just seems so indifferent, he spends time with our two younger kids and it feels like my oldest and myself may as well not even exist. Then he will belittle me at times about things I could or need to do for the kids. I am a full time sahm and I take care of everything regarding the kids, which I have no problem with until he starts telling me I am doing it wrong. I‚Äôll give an example of something small. 

I made dinner for my son‚Äôs birthday. He had a nice steak and we all had angus burgers cause it would have cost over 200$ just for the steaks and we just couldn‚Äôt afford it at the moment. I had cooked 6 of the burgers and had them in one of those foil pans, he comes out and scoffs and asks why there‚Äôs no cheese on it. I was finishing the other six burgers and the steak was in the oven and I was still working on the Mac and cheese so I was going to put them in the oven to keep them hot so putting cheese would have been stupid at that moment. I lost my cool immediately because this isn‚Äôt the first time he has done this. I said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre more than welcome to make dinner, I didn‚Äôt see you volunteer so just stfu‚Äù his grandmother who was helping me get the stuff ready immediately starts backpedaling on my behalf (she is old school and subservient when it comes to the men around her) she starts prepping the cheese slices and I made her stop. I told her that no we are not kissing his ass just because he has no idea what he‚Äôs talking about. 

I would also like to add we‚Äôre not married or engaged. I have also never been afraid of him. I am just sick of the passive aggressive comments. 

I have communicated to him that I don‚Äôt enjoy being belittled and told I‚Äôm doing things wrong when he doesn‚Äôt do any of what I do. I take the kids to school, I do all of our laundry, I cook, clean and he has never filled out any paperwork or gone to any doctors appointments. Yet will get pissy because our daughter was sick and he wanted me to drop everything and take her to the doctor, she had a viral infection of some sort and I knew it would pass. 

I have also explained I don‚Äôt mind not being married but I would like to at least be engaged after over a decade of being together. 

I have explained myself more times than I care to count and I‚Äôm just done. I don‚Äôt hate him and would never try to screw up his relationship with his kids.  I‚Äôm just done. I used to send him paragraphs of exactly how I go the extra mile to make sure he‚Äôs happy, I get his clothes together in the morning so he doesn‚Äôt have to spend a lot of time getting ready. I make his coffee and make a bag of snacks for him and his dad for the day. (They work together). 

Today was the final straw. I was folding clothes and he was supposed to do an 8 hour class this weekend. He woke up late yesterday which is whatever so he was supposed to do it today. He woke up late again. Just a while ago he was taking our youngest outside and was like ‚Äúsupposed to do something for eight hours today‚Äù 

Yeah? That‚Äôs somehow my problem? I sent him a text and asked why he didn‚Äôt set an alarm and decided to wake up and start watching football instead of getting on the computer?? No response. 

I am done being his mother and idk how to get out of this without a job, I applied to Uber eats today so I can save some money but I still have my little with me so I am going to have a friend ride with me to help with him while I‚Äôm running orders. I know it won‚Äôt be enough but I am willing to get him into a preschool soon so I can work more. I feel stuck cause the kids love their dad and I care so much about his family. I have also been recently daydreaming about my ex that would just do little things to make me smile and I miss that so much. I am not a high maintenance person. I just want to feel valued and I‚Äôm done fighting.

I‚Äôm heading to see my GI NP tomorrow after about 3 wks of my first acid reflux flair ever.

Summary of my issues: 
Started in earnest Sep 13th with nausea and bad taste in mouth. 

Symptoms: 
- Nausea: I‚Äôve been having some nausea on and off, not more than once every few weeks. Passes within an 1hr. 
- Bad taste in back of mouth 
- Dizziness 
- Acid backwash in mouth (once a day maximum, more like once every few days) 
- Burning feeling in back of throat
- Horse voice 
- Increased burping, occasionally accompanied with acid 

What I‚Äôve tried: 
- Tums (took for first two weeks, didn‚Äôt notice a difference) 
- Limiting acidic foods and coffee consumption (one 16oz cup a day) 
- Not drinking fluids an hr before or after eating 
- Not eating 3hrs before bed 
- Stopped taking my iron pills 
- Limiting tomato products 
- switched my vitamin to breakfast vs bedtime

What has helped: 
- reducing fluids around meals 
- Stopping iron supplements 

Most pressing issues: 
- burning feeling at back of throat
- Acid reflux 
- Hoarse voice 

Question: 

Should I push my NP to refer me for an endoscopy? I lose good insurance in January. 

An extra comment: 
I just started reading the Acid Watchers Diet book and I am now terrified I have Barrett‚Äôs or real damage. 

I only have throat symptoms, but they truly only started this summer, like 3 months AT MOST. Is it possible it‚Äôs been going on longer and I just didn‚Äôt know? He said he sees people in their 20s with only throat issues who already have Barrett‚Äôs! ",1,1728241204.0,GERD,4,1.0,False

Later down the line I wanted to get help as it's hard to maintain work, family and my wife is just in pieces with; me (a non medicated adhd), my 16yo daughter (a medicated adhd inattentive type), and my 8yo son (currently on the waiting list for adhd and asd (100% has it)).

All my medical history before 2006 is destroyed as I moved to another county and apparently 20 years they destroy records. So I had to start again. But I knew as an adult the nhs wasn't going to be easy. So I've had to pay private. This is a very expensive lesson but whatever I'm hopefully gonna reap the benefits.


I've been diagnosed with adhd - combined type, which wasn't new information.
So I've been on meds now for 4 weeks. Titration period stared me on 20mg elvanse. However on the same day I stopped drinking coffee as discussed with the psych dr. 
When I say I drank coffee, 2 heaped scoops in a cup with 2 heaped sugars. The meds did sweet fa. Check up time and the dr said that the meds must of just replaced the energy from the caffeine. So she put me on 40mg. Been on that 1 week and still nothing. 

I have 2 days merd left and gotta wait til Tuesday for delivery of new script to arrive. 

So I decided to rather than miss 2 days try my daughters meds. I took 50mg of medikinet xl. Ok this did something. Took 4 hours to kick in, but when it did it kicked in. I went to my home office and pushed through 2 days worth of work in 3 hours. And I mean it's was as if it was too easy. However the down side was I ate nothing yesterday and had the worst cotton mouth in history. 


My question to those who have been back and forth on these  meds is;

How  long did it take to find that sweet spot?

Did you find that 1 drug helped but the other didn't?

Do you think I'd be OK have 1 or 2 caffinated coffees in the morning before the meds kick in, bare in mind my caffeine intake previously?

Thanks for the read and I hope that your experiences can help me. I don't expect medical opinions as I know none of us are hehe.",0,1728241015.0,ADHDUK,6,0.33,False

1fxntt3,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1fxntt3/rf_a_man/,[RF] A man.,"Day One

A man stands by the window in his tiny apartment. Outside, as if by magic, the tree branches dance to barely audible music. The man drinks coffee and wistfully gazes at the lawns and the first leaves. In the distance, a cat runs by, followed by another. The long-awaited spring has arrived in the city. The man is very annoyed by the sunlight and its warmth, which shamelessly burns his face even through the high-quality and expensive double-glazed window. Never before has the man felt such a strong desire to simply walk out of the building and wander aimlessly, without a route or destination. In the past, the man would hardly have noticed the arrival of spring, still running errands, sitting in the office in front of the monitor, and only occasionally, when returning home from work in the evening, catching an irresistibly persistent fresh and juicy gust of wind with the scent of the first apricot blossoms.

But the man is locked in. He is fully convinced that in five or six days, he will be allowed out, and besides, the food supplies will last just that long: two packs of grains sit on the shelf, a tired sack of potatoes, onions, and apples lies on the balcony, and in the fridge, chicken eggs, sausage, and a jumbo pack of mayonnaise have their honored spots. But within an hour, the news on TV, across all channels, will report with concerned faces that a massive cloud of unknown locusts is flying from city to city, destroying all living things in its path. The man has no choice but to tightly close the window. And wait.

Day Six

Hours pass, then days. The food ran out much faster than expected. Neighbors in the building began bartering food, quite successfully‚Äîthe man‚Äôs bag of apples was traded for a pack of dumplings. The anxiety on the news grows with each new episode‚Äînow the locusts are eating people, even the young and well-educated. The man decides to read books, listen to classical music, and expand his knowledge of home aikido.

Day Fifteenth

The man is irritated by the birds‚Äô singing. Even with the window closed, their disgusting, squeaky chirping is audible. No one remembers when they last washed their hair or did laundry. The man will definitely do all this, and even clean the apartment, but tomorrow. The deadly cloud is still not visible on the horizon, but the news is becoming more tragic‚Äîthousands of people and trees are dying, and there clearly won‚Äôt be a strawberry harvest this year, which is unfortunate‚Äîthe man loved strawberries. A neighbor behind the wall sings a sad song to a guitar, the neighbors downstairs continue to drill the walls, and inside, a vague sense of sadness‚Äîdepression‚Äîcreeps in on soft paws.

Day Forty-Ninth

The man reads on tattered pages: ‚ÄúYou must find and discover yourself. Only you can change this world, find all the keys to happiness, and open all the new doors.‚Äù Yes, this is what‚Äôs needed. Discover yourself. Find your true self. Believe in your strength. In the evening news, the anchor in a red tie reports that the TV tower has been attacked by locusts, and this might be their last broadcast, ‚ÄúGod bless you‚Äù‚Ä¶ The transmission is interrupted, and colored bars appear on the screen.
The man feels sad‚Äîhe liked that anchor. Turning off the TV, the man sits in an armchair and starts staring at the wallpaper. If you stare at one spot long enough, your head begins to spin and colored circles appear in your eyes, which is quite amusing!

Day Fifty-Fifth

It seems the man has accidentally discovered a superpower. He can easily move objects on the table with just a glance, the toothbrush comes to him from the bathroom on its own, water boils in the pot just from his thoughts, and the neighbor behind the wall now sings in Phil Collins‚Äôs voice‚Äîalso purely a product of the man‚Äôs mind. Nothing amuses him more than new knowledge, which he can play with like in a sandbox. A neighbor stopped by. Pretty, they exchanged vermicelli, and she mentioned that it will be a while before everyone can go out, as the cloud is very close and it‚Äôs unknown how quickly it will all end. She asked him to take care and stay home. Apparently, she also hasn‚Äôt washed her hair in about three weeks, resulting in a neat little ponytail.

Day Sixty-Second

The man stands by the window in his tiny apartment. He looks at the blue sky with fluffy clouds. The radio broadcasts the latest reports, according to which the locusts are very close and everyone will suffer. The man cannot bear the thought that no one will know about his superpowers. He absolutely has to tell everyone about it. He gets up from the couch, goes to the wardrobe, takes out his best jeans, which he bought a year and a half ago, pulls on a white shirt with black buttons, finds a pack of clean socks, and gets dressed. Now he is once again handsome and attractive. Standing in front of the mirror, he licks his palm and smooths his hair‚Äînow everything is perfect. Then he slips on his slippers and leaves the apartment.

In the communal hallway, it smells different. The lives of many people have mixed in this narrow passage. The man stood there, rooted to the spot‚Äîhe couldn‚Äôt decide what to do‚Äîknock on every door or scream as loud as possible to call everyone out at once? Or maybe it‚Äôs better to go down to the first floor, find all the tenants‚Äô phone numbers in the directory, and nobly invite everyone to the show? He‚Äôs confused and scared. Something needs to be done, he needs to move! He shot out onto the stair landing and ran down. Reaching the first floor, even sweating a little, he saw the large entrance doors, already covered in cobwebs. In his mind, he is now a superhero who will instantly save the world from boredom and despair, from the economic crisis, and from something else, he just needs to take a deep breath of fresh air and feel alive! So he did. With one movement, he flung open the heavy doors, and a rush of warm air hit his face. He ran a few meters forward, a smile beaming on his face, and his heart pounding out of his chest‚Äîthis was a moment of absolute happiness!

Suddenly the sun disappeared. The sky turned black and ominous, the birds fell silent, and only a distant rumble could be heard. One arrow, then another. The man starts fighting back, trying to resist what‚Äôs happening, but the insects are merciless. Somewhere above, on the fifth or sixth floor, the pretty neighbor stands at her window. Even with the window closed, her scream is clearly heard: ‚ÄúI TOLD YOU TO STAY AT HOOOME!!!‚Äù

All that remained of the man were dust and slippers.
It‚Äôs a shame, such a shame, that there won‚Äôt be any strawberries this season‚Ä¶",1,1728240831.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1fxntbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/crossword/comments/1fxntbk/a_review_of_the_first_midwest_crossword_tournament/,A review of the first Midwest Crossword Tournament,"TL;DR It was a great event. I'm very grateful to the organizers for finally creating a premier Crossword event for us in the middle of the country. I can't wait for next year.

I went to the first Midwest Crossword Tournament yesterday hosted at UIC's student center. More info here:  [https://www.mwxwt.com/](https://www.mwxwt.com/)

It was a terrific event, very well attended, well-organized, and just a lot of fun. If you've never been to a crossword tournament before and this one is convenient to you, you should put it on your calendar for next year. I've attended the ACPT in the past but I stopped mainly because Stamford, CT is just a pain to travel to and there's not much else to do there

I got the sense there were about 250 people there. We were seated at round tables in a very large room with a stage and screen that was used by the hosts. There was a separate room for the judges/scorers and a lobby area for registration and a puzzle table.

What I really liked:

1. Like all of these competitions, everyone is really friendly. I liked the circular table seating since it made it much more of a social event for those of us attending alone. The ACPT has long rows of seating and it's much more isolating. I enjoyed chatting with my table-mates between puzzles.
2. They provided coffee. This was great to be able to fill up on a cup of coffee between puzzles in the morning.
3. The puzzles were fun plus a lot of giveaway puzzles on paper from other constructors.

What I'd change / improve on. Minor quibbles:

1. You can leave the room when you finish your puzzle and most of the ""elite"" solvers finish quickly. They filled up the area right outside the room and just made a lot of noise that filled up the solving room. It was doubly distracting for those people to get up and leave and then to hear their noise. There needs to be another area for early finishers to go to that's not right outside the door.
2. I wasn't fond of the scoring system that went down to the precise seconds on the clock. It discourages you from taking a chunk of time to scan your puzzle for errors. I like the method where you have until the end of the full minute.
3. There was one extra-hard puzzle of the day and it felt way too hard. I don't expect a level playing field between the elite speed solvers and the rest of us, but it's puzzles like that that really widen the gap. The elite solves are finishing that puzzle in minutes and more than half the room struggled to finish at all. It just felt like a ""wedge"" rather than fun.
4. There were some non-competition activities at the end of the day before the finals (like ACPT does on day 2) but I didn't fully stick around. It felt like too much packed into one day for me. By 3:30, I needed a break from that room and wasn't really ready for two more hours of stuff there. Kinda felt like two days of stuff packed into one day. But, really cool if you traveled to Chicago for it (which it seemed like a LOT of people did).

Again, a thousand thank yous to the organizers for putting on this much needed event. Can't wait for 2025!",5,1728240798.0,crossword,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a size medium or small most of the time so my goal for losing weight is solely for wanting to be prettier. As a woman I just felt like it would be better to turn to my mom for this weight loss routine that I found since I just wanted to talk about it to someone. Instead of encouraging me she brought up about how I ate chocolate earlier not once but three times which really hurt me. I have a binge eating problem for as long as I was a kid and I have been self aware about this issue. The conversation went like this:

Me: ‚ÄúIt says the pilates was really helpful and walking too‚Äù

Mom: ‚ÄúYeah you need discipline for that‚Äù (a good comment)

Me: ‚ÄúDid you know that coffee makes you gain weight? This celebrity prefers tea and they never ate fast food, I should try that‚Äù

Mom: *laughs* ‚ÄúYou just ate so much chocolate earlier‚Äù (this WAS okay)

Me: ‚ÄúYeah I know I did that‚Äù

not even a minute later I just proceeded talking and she brought the same sentence up two times more. She was just laughing at me for eating lots earlier. My mom knows I have a sweet tooth and that I found it hard to control myself which I entirely blame on myself. 

I told her that I was gonna change that and I got irritated from her repeating the same thing over and over so I called her out on it (wrong move for someone like her) I told her that I get it, I get what she‚Äôs saying I even acknowledged it. I got really upset and asked her why she loved shutting me off and just hurting me. Btw, prior to this she was just talking about how pretty my other sister was before I started the conversation of wanting to start my weight loss journey. I told her ‚ÄúWhy are you always disregarding the things I have to say?‚Äù and she always denies it. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me being too sensitive. I honestly don‚Äôt know and I feel so lonely. Is she a mild case of a narc parent or am I just the problem? I have no one else to talk to about my own issues at home except for her (my dad is a certified bad case of narc who I had to call the police on several times so he‚Äôs worse) because she sometimes tries to understand but it always ends up with her making fun of what I‚Äôve done in the past instead of putting in some encouragement.

It has not had a particularly easy life. At 6 months old I accidentally attempted to fold it in half with a rocking chair, bending the entire thing into a slight V-shape‚Ä¶ but other than a very small crack in the carbon fiber LCD cover and a mark on the LCD, nothing has progressed further. It has been dropped numerous times, and while it is not a commuting laptop, it has never lived in a sleeve and the paint on the edges is showing it.

Issues:
- the second USB-C port is shorted out due to bent contacts, and plugging a charging cable into it (even accidentally) will start it smoking. The primary USB-C port is also wearing and causing erratic charging, and I suspect what will kill this thing is the complete inability to supply any power to it.
- the CPU fan started screeching / stopping, but after removing it, cleaning out hair, and repasting, it seems to have solved it for now.
- due to a coffee spilling accident the arrow keys are a bit weird but still work.
- after a drop the clickpad became stuck, but I was able to disassemble and repair.
- the LCD has started to occasionally flicker black (like once a week for a half second) but I haven‚Äôt figured out what‚Äôs causing it as it doesn‚Äôt seem to be related to movement or pressure.

Observations:
- it has been extremely stable and never crashes. I have it slightly undervolted, and I‚Äôm able to work it without constant overheating.
- the finish and keyboard have both held up shockingly well. At least a half million words worth of novels have been written on this thing.
- the performance is‚Ä¶ vaguely okay, but nothing to be proud of. Definitely do not try to play games on this thing.
- the sound sucks. Period. I believe 7th gen is when they first improved it.
- Battery has done well. The laptop has been kept plugged in and kept on 100% charge for most of its life, and is reporting 299 cycles and 51,000 out of 57,020 capacity.

I wish I had gotten a picture or video of this but I had a good amount of members ordering for lunch, so I didn‚Äôt have time. since then, the lid blew away in the wind, these ladies here are stragglers still hanging around the sugar that‚Äôs left over.

Anyway after not beign able to sleep for 7 months and dealing with big waves of dispersinalization i start getting panic attacks and they are the worst especially if they are combined with ocd 
However i repeatedly thank god for what am gonna share with you now 
You simply have to cut down anything that effect your mood from drugs, cigarettes to caffeine and lastly and the hardest is dopamine, not forever that's impossible but for a good period of time. personally ive done it for 2 weeks and the results are worth all the pain
For my personall experience the hardest part was the caffein not the dopamine im gonna tell you why 
Im addicted to coffe in the morning so much that ive never imagine i can live without it and whenever i try i end up falling for it again and loving it even more 
But as you may know the worst feeling you may experience is a panic attacks especially around people or while working 
And all i simply did was believing that coffee triggers my anxiety and that lead to a panic attack that starts when i feel my heart rate speeding up
So that give me a huge courage to deal with my caffeine addiction and thanks god ive done it although my head was crushed during the whole week plus no cigarettes hurts too and in the end what ive got is my first week of no panic attacks no anixity and my ocd was low i was so amazed and proud . Here you may ask why did i not cut dopamine 
Im literally working 12h 
And when i have some free time i do go hang out with my friends 
(My productivity is high af but the time and energy i spend in work doesn't allow me to benefit from it , this is just a note for anyone thinking about dopamine detox)

I want to take a step back from him for couple of weeks . ,"Im in my 20s and I currently live with my parents (I am a student ) and the last few years I am very lonely .
I lost most of my friends and I don't go out anymore (once in a while with a friend for a coffee it can be even once a 3 months ) . 
My parents really judgemental to me they always see me as a liar , insecure and someone you can't trust on  and it effects me very much . More than that I used to be bullied since I was a BABY(yes)  on my looks . 

Anyway , my brother kinda know what I am facing with ,and I just notice that he talks to me odd like I am different and not in a good way , he speaks to me like I talk to my 6 yo niece . I just realized it yesterday how he actually sees me as someone who need a special attention. 

I went to visit him and his wife at the hospital to congrats him for having a baby , and when I came all exited hug him and congrat him he looked at me like and told my parents ""aww look at her how sweet she is congrats me "" with a tone like he talks to a little child, and it just kept going in other situations and I was kinda off because of it  the whole evening, because I got tired from it so I felt uncomfortable and wanted to leave ASAP but I couldn't because I came with my parents so I didn't have how to return (he lives far) . 

After few minutes her cousins  came to visit and I just went for a second to take my phone and my brother was behind me and he forced me to come back and said ""hey come in where are you going"" like I am running away from something and I just couldn't stand the way he talks to me like something is wrong with me all the fuckin time ! 
Anyway i sat and just felt really bad and uncomfortable because I felt like I am being treated differently. my brother was next to me and put his hand on my shoulder like he support me or whatever. 
I felt like I am about to snap and get out , I couldn't be around him anymore I just sick from the fact that he talks above me and treat me like that . 

Today he called me and  asked me out of no where ""why were you so off yesterday when the family of his wife got in were you shyy from them ? That's whyyy?""
I felt like I couldn't handle it anymore and I am about to snap any second  so I got quite for a second on the phone and said ""omg seriously you called me for asking me if am i shy from her family ?wth ? I said I was TIRED "" And just told me I need to go and then he said ""but talk to me yes ? Okay ? "" And I just said okay I got to hang up now bye . 

He knows I am dealing with a lot of things right now, I am very lonely and not able to be social also I think I developed kind of a social anxiety so I see him always tests me around people and I can notice it and it bothers me so much that the he reminds me of it everytime he is around and makes me feel like I need some special treat. 
Later I just was so mad and sad at the same time I almost breaked down and was about to cry because I realized I have nobody that can treat me, he called me twice on my way home and I didn't answer him because I knew the moment I'll hear him I'll just start to say things I'll regret for saying .

At first it was a god-send and it made me feel really good. My anxiety was sorted, I was more pro-social and while I had a feeling of not being able to grasp words as easily, it was mitigated because it still felt like I was better at it than before I went on the medication.

For years I felt like this was the answer for me and it has allowed me to do things I normally wouldn't do. But over time, particularly in the last 2 years, I've had a feeling of becoming brain-dead and just depressed. I have done some cool things - been to Milan, Budapest. But all the time I just don't enjoy it. I walk around feeling moody or in a haze, can't put my thoughts into words. Occasionally I have a good day. But most days I have to have the strongest coffee that Starbucks have in order to give me 5 or 6 hours of feeling alright before I go back to that feeling of being dumb again. I'm not dumb, but I feel it.

Some days I am so tired and brain dead, I just lie on the sofa all day. I don't know what to do other than come off lyrica but that's also so hard to do. Does anyone else feel this way and have they been able to mitigate it at all? There are still rare times where I feel 'normal' but otherwise I'm so tired. I have noticed if I have an espresso martini my brain seems to work like it should but I can't have that every day.

At a loss and don't really know what to do. I know that I'm lucky in a way that I'm not taking it for pain management as I know other people will have a harder choice when deciding to give it up, but for anxiety I think it's just impacting my life too negatively to continue.",3,1728239286.0,pregabalin,4,1.0,False

As do I, but not nearly as much. And we are hated by our older employees because of our ages.

The problem is that our great uncle doesn't see that. He only comes in about every 6 months and usually complains about stupid things and critiques everyone including my cousin. Last year she improved sales by 20% on her own and he yelled at her over how much she's spending on coffee considering other companies can offer us cheaper coffee and save us a thousand dollars a year (our revenue is 40-50 million a year). 

And it was the same story this week, he was complaining and yelling at her about her behavior and she snapped and called him a frustrated old F word in front of everyone. The thing is that was always a rumor about him, being gay that I always denied although it might be true.

Chaos is about to happen and I don't know whose side to be on. She'll probably get fired and she might take people with her. I know how she is. 

I feel like my life is about to change drastically. I love my uncle but he never has a nice thing to say about anyone, but at the same time he gave me a job. And I grew up with my cousin. This might divide the family. What do I do?",1,1728238695.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

Context: I wanted to make a coffee table book from our proposal and engagement photos that our guests could write notes and sign essentially like a yearbook so I did! However, my mom went ahead and bought a traditional guestbook for me and was so excited to give it to me that I don‚Äôt have the heart to not use it. 

Would it be weird to put both out at our wedding? I thought of maybe using one for personalized notes and maybe using the other for Polaroid pictures? 

I need them to be different enough I guess so that we don‚Äôt end up with a bunch of sparse pages. 

Open to any ideas truly!

1fxmvdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1fxmvdb/am_i_21f_in_a_situationship_with_this_guy_21m_i/,"Am I (21F) in a ""Situationship"" with this Guy (21M) I have a Fat Crush On? ","So, 7 years of my life up until today, I (21f) thought I was Aro/ace and was pretty convinced of it. I never dated anyone, never found attraction in another person (man or woman), rejected the couple of offers I got from guys to date when I was in highschool, and didn't have any of the urges that most people have when it comes to romance. 
Well that was until this year. Here I am about to graduate college, and I have just now gotten my first crush. I fell hard for a friend of mine (21m), like so hard that I gave myself a concussion and probably broke my nose in the process. He is very charming, incredibly intelligent, considerate of everyone (always checking in on how his friends are doing/feeling in the moment, always the biggest cheerleader when encouraging his friends both academically and non-academically, always making sure he is communicating clearly with his friends), and is one of the most beautiful men I think I have ever laid eyes on. He is a light-haired ginger, big blue eyes, 6""6' (my god). 
Three weeks into realizing that I indeed had a crush on him, I consulted our mutual friend (I will call her Kay, and I'm mentioning that she is a lesbian only because I have had people misinterpret her as his crush without me giving them that information) about her opinions on me telling him of my crush. After that, I told him that I had a crush on him about 3-4 weeks ago. He gave me the biggest hug and said that he was so proud of me telling him, because that's not an easy thing to do. Unfortunately, he said he wasn't at a place in his life currently where dating in an option. He is currently studying for a big exam for grad school applications, is barely getting any sleep at night because of insomnia, and said he had little free time to dedicate what should be dedicated to a relationship. I was heartbroken, but I understood. He said if I needed space that he would understand, but I said I was fine. We have sat next to each other in lecture since classes started in August, and we still do after I told him of my crush; he hasn't made it awkward in the slightest. 
The day after I told him of my crush, I was even over at his apartment all day so we could both study for our first orgo exam (because I brought a gigantic whiteboard to study with and didn't want to lug it into a coffee shop where it would take up 2 tables). Nothing happened. We studied as one would when stressing about a chemistry exam. 

Here are where the questions of ""situationship"" come in. 

That night after we got done studying, we decided to take a walk on the Greenway near his apartment to wind down. I left my jacket in our mutual friend Kay's car the day prior, and briefly mentioned that earlier in the day to him when talking. So before we left, he asked if I needed a jacket. I told him I was fine, but he wasn't buying it, so he insisted that I take his jacket. I said thank you but I'm okay again, but I ended up wearing it on our walk anyways because he knew I was lying (I was actually very cold but it felt wrong to take his jacket). We went on a hour-long night walk on this pretty Greenway and it was great, but the jacket was a little mixed signal-y for me. I talked to Kay about this alone and she agreed that the jacket was a dumb move on his part considering he had just rejected me a day earlier, but I digress. 

He has been hanging out with me more and more, and going out of his way to do so. I talked to Kay again and told her that I was having a hard time getting over the crush. She told me that I shouldn't give up hope, because you never know what can happen. I told her that he isn't up for dating right now but once he is, it likely won't be with me, so I should get over it. She then said ""girl, read between the lines"" and implied that he likes me back, but that she couldn't outwardly tell me that because it would hurt the mutual trust they have in their friendship. She had said ""he made me swear not to tell you"", and I said ""...tell me what?"" And at that point she said she has already said too much. She is bad a keeping exciting secrets though, so that was what she told me instead of answering my question when I asked her ""does he like me back?"".
Anyways, now I am being led to believe he likes me. All of my friends say he likes me too, and I think they are delusional. Could I be denying the possibility because I want to protect my emotions? Maybe, but he does have a flirty personality by nature that he himself has said ""gets him into trouble"". 

However he is talking to me alot, when I offer plans for us to go do something but they don't work for him time-wise, he always reccomends an alternative time for us to do the same plans, but at a time he can go. We meet for 3 hours every single Friday morning to ""study"", but it really is just him and I yapping for the majority of the time and not getting any studying done. Him and I have so much in common it's crazy, like music taste, favorite movies, favorite everything, you name it and we probably both have it in common. He is so interested in the field I am going into and asks me questions about it, and says some things that just feel so genuine. Example, we talked about scholarships one day and I briefly mentioned how they were important to me considering I was raised by a single mom and didn't think college was in the cards for me with our low income. To this, he replied with ""I hope your mom is proud to know that not only did she have a full time job to pay the bills, but she also had another full time job raising a child on her own and was still able to raise such an incredible daughter""...LIKE WHO SAYS THAT?? He compliments my outfits, wants to know about my day, walks me to the busses when I'm on my way to class, drove me to my class last week when it was so rainy and he didn't want me waiting for the bus in the rain (I had an umbrella fyi), he is constantly reminding me of how intelligent I am, especially when we got that orgo exam back (which I did poorly on, as one does). Him and Kay have a tradition of Friday movie nights, so when he asked if I wanted to do a movie night at his apartment on Friday last week (which is where him and Kay normally do their movie nights), I assumed that it would be me, him, and Kay. However that wasn't the case, Kay didn't get an invite, and it was just him and I. We watched 2 movies and it was great, I didn't get home until about 1:30am. Him and Kay then came over to my house that Saturday and we watched more movies/ate lunch at my house together. After our orgo exam, him and I got dinner and he stayed out with me until about 11pm, which is something he never does. Kay and him have been friends for two years now, and he has never offered his family Sundays to her to hang out on. Those are his sacred days and he doesn't hang out with friends on his Sundays. Well according to Kay, I'm getting special treatment because he told me that if I ever wanted to hang out on a Sunday, he isn't busy *every* Sunday and could make it work if I wanted him to be free.
He isn't the type to stay on campus late, yet has been open to staying late on campus with me to study, as we have done many times now. Also rather than staying home when he didn't have any classes last Friday, he still came to campus and we studied/talked together from 7am to almost 1pm in the library. He gave me one of his airpods so we could listen to music together in the library, and gave me the password to his phone so I could queue what songs I wanted to. 

Does he like me? Am I crazy? I have friends who have said that this is the ""most non-dating dating"" situation they have ever seen, because it's almost like we are dating, but neither side has labeled it as dating, so it isn't that just yet.
