This shot was setup when I got the bag of beans, fresh from the roaster. Did the usual weighing and timing and the shot poured well.

After about a week the shots start to look like this. I know that freshness is important but we drink a lot of coffee in our house so we get through the coffee bags fairly quickly. Surely 1-2 weeks wouldn't be enough time for the beans to go off?

Any help would be appreciated!

1l0jnqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1l0jnqd/help_with_insomnia/,Help with insomnia,"Hey guys,

I've been struggling with insomnia for the past 1.5 years. It all started during a particularly stressful period in my life‚Äîmainly due to work and an overall unhealthy lifestyle. I had trouble falling asleep and would lie in bed for hours. Sometimes I managed to fall asleep, but only for about four hours, waking up around 3 or 4 a.m., with no chance of getting back to sleep. A couple of times it happened that I laid in bed from 10pm to 7am with no sleep at all. It was driving me insane.

Of course, it started affecting my quality of life and productivity, so I decided to see a doctor. I went twice. The first time, my doctor prescribed me some mild herbal pills with valerian, which, unsurprisingly, didn‚Äôt help. The second time, she refused to prescribe anything stronger, saying those medications are addictive. Instead, she offered to prescribe antidepressants. I was furious‚ÄîI'm not willing to take antidepressants just to treat my insomnia, and I hate how casually some doctors hand them out like candy.

That was about a year ago. Since then, I‚Äôve drastically changed my lifestyle. I quit coffee and smoking, I exercise 5‚Äì6 times a week (never too late in the evening), and I removed major sources of stress from my life. I don‚Äôt eat right before bed, I eat healthily, and I‚Äôve stopped looking at my phone before bedtime‚ÄîI read a book instead. And guess what? No effect.

For the past four nights, I‚Äôve been lying in bed from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m., unable to fall asleep. I ended up taking the strongest sleeping pills I could find, because I felt like I was going crazy. Last night, I took 2.5 pills just to get some rest (usually 0.5 is enough for me). Sometimes I try melatonin spray‚Äîoccasionally it helps, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt.

Two weeks ago, I had three nights of normal sleep‚Äîseven hours without any pills or melatonin. For those three days, it felt like my insomnia was gone. But now, for the past week, the problems are back. I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing wrong, and it‚Äôs driving me nuts. 

What can I do? 

I‚Äôve been thinking about going back to the doctor and insisting that she actually figure out what‚Äôs wrong with me. Last time, she didn‚Äôt run any tests or try to get to the root of the problem‚Äîshe just wanted to prescribe antidepressants, and that was it. This time, I want them to do proper blood work, maybe some sleep studies‚Äîanything that could help identify what‚Äôs really going on.",1,1748765116.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False

Gonna try this again. 

If you‚Äôve ever screamed internally while pretending to be normal, accidentally trauma-dumped on a new friend, or spent six hours hyperfixating on your D&D character‚Äôs tragic backstory‚Ä¶ this post is for you.

A bit about me:
I‚Äôm turning 30 this year (cue dramatic music) and have been on a journey of self-discovery, healing, and figuring out how to build a life that feels actually good‚Ñ¢. Been leveling up in therapy, investing stat points into self-love, and finally learned how to make a breakfast that isn‚Äôt just coffee and vibes.

But despite all that, I‚Äôve realized something‚Äôs missing‚Äîpeople. My people. Fellow weirdos.
So here I am, casting Summon Internet Friends at 9th level.

Looking for:
	‚Ä¢	Fellow queer, neurodivergent, artistic goblins
	‚Ä¢	People who like to talk regularly, whether it‚Äôs deep convos, chaotic memes, or ‚Äúlook at this cursed item I just found in Baldur‚Äôs Gate‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Creatives! I‚Äôm a writer‚Äîif you draw, paint, write, or cosplay, let‚Äôs trade inspo!
	‚Ä¢	Bonus points if you‚Äôre into D&D, TTRPGs, cozy/indie games, or just screaming about your OC‚Äôs trauma arc at 2am
	‚Ä¢	Furries welcome‚Äîif you have a sona, I already want to know everything about them
	‚Ä¢	Age range: ideally 25-35ish, but 21+ is the only hard rule. Any time zone is cool with me if it‚Äôs cool with you.

I‚Äôm not expecting overnight besties, but I am hoping to build real, long-term friendships. The kind where we accidentally stay up till 4am talking about life, drop hype in each other‚Äôs inboxes, and maybe even co-write chaotic worldbuilding lore for no reason other than fun.

If you made it this far, you‚Äôre probably at least a little weird. So what are you waiting for? Slide into my DMs like a bard with maxed-out Charisma and zero impulse control.

It was time to retire to bed and I pulled out my guest air mattress and told him he's sleeping in the living room and if he dared come to my room I would taze him. He had the most confused look on his face coz he couldn't tell if I was being serious or not. He sure tried to get me to sleep in the living room and I just told him that my warm bed awaits. Morning came and he received news that his family member passed away. My door was cracked open and I could see him standing a few inches away calling out to inform me the news. Honestly I felt no sympathy for him. It took me a few minutes to stop doom scrolling and go be present in the next room where he was at. He was trying to talk to me saying all this things and all I could do was roll my eyes and sigh from the inside. I just wanted him out of my space, thankfully he decided to leave. Of course I made the ""you can stay a little longer"" comment, just to sound comforting, but deep down I really didn't mean it. When he walked out the door, I just said goodbye and he stood there looking at me, turned to look at the hallway then back at me and  I closed the door even before he decided to take the second step. I think he had the idea that I would walk him to his car. He called me when he was on his way and asked why I had not made him tea like I used to and I told him there's coffee shops that you can get tea from. I didn't follow up to check up on him and ignored his texts when he reached out. AITAH for not offering a shoulder to cry on?! ",1,1748764511.0,AITAH,8,0.67,False

1l0jeh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1l0jeh0/questionsconfusion_about_mega_churches/,Questions/confusion about mega churches,"Some back story: I‚Äôm a 26 year old female, and I live in the US. I was raised Lutheran, and grew up attending a very ‚Äúconservative‚Äù/traditional Lutheran church. I converted to Catholicism a few years ago (did OCIA, had my confirmation, I am an active parishioner at my parish, and I take my Catholic faith seriously).

I remember the first time I ever went to Catholic mass at the beginning of my conversion a few years ago, I was nervous because I wasn‚Äôt sure what it was like or what to expect. But then I got there and realized that it was pretty similar to the Lutheran church service I grew up attending. So in my whole 26 years of life, even before my conversion to Catholic, my church experience has always been very traditional - and I love it that way.

Anyways, I have seen some stuff online lately about mega churches, and it reminded me: back in 2019 before my conversion, one of my friends asked me to go one Sunday to her church with her. I asked her what kind of church it was, and she said it was a non-denominational Christian church. I honestly had no clue at that time what that even meant, but I agreed to go since she seemed to really want me to join her.

We got there and I immediately felt out of place. The lobby had a coffee shop, an ATM, couches, a giant slide that went from the loft back down to the main floor (yes, like the type of slide you see at a playground), and everything was millennial grey style. Then through the double doors was the ‚Äúauditorium‚Äù, as they called it, which is where they hold the service. 

The service felt strange to me because the pastor was dressed in jeans & a t-shirt, and he also didn‚Äôt actually read from the bible but instead shared his own life stories and how those related to God. It felt more like I was listening to a motivational speaker than attending church. Then these massive screens would come down that would play videos of people who attend their church talking about themselves and their lives. 

Then they also had their live band, which honestly performed so many songs that it was literally half the service, and felt like it was a concert. 

Idk, everything there felt like it was more about the pastor, band, and staff, and not actually about what church should be about. 

I left there knowing that that‚Äôs not the type of church for me personally, and haven‚Äôt ever attended anything like that again. I am not trying to seem like I am judging anyone that attends these types of churches, truly I don‚Äôt want to be judgmental, but those were just my key takeaways and it‚Äôs definitely not for me. 

My questions are:

Have you ever attended a church like that? If so, did you leave with similar feelings that I did, or am I actually just being judgey even though I don‚Äôt mean to?

It's not just a superficial retro aesthetic; it seems to go deeper than that. Take, for example, the resurgence of physical buttons and dials in audio equipment. While touchscreens are ubiquitous, ther's a tactile satisfaction and a more immediate sense of control that designers are bringing back from older hi-Fi systems.

Beyond just interfaces,you see the influence in overall form factors. Look at some modern synthesizers or even coffee makers. Many echo the boxy, functional designs of the 70s and 80s, a purposeful choice that balances minimalism with a sense of robust reliability. It's like designers are mining the past for elements that feel more authentic and grounded than purely digital interfaces.

My night shift coworker suggested I posted it here so I could get the frustration out of my system.

So for context, I work at a hotel and we have a contract with an airline to keep their pilots here on special reservations. That afternoon was no different, it was a pretty busy day so I was in a bit of a bad mood. Then this pilot came in with his captain, and I wasn't really in the mood to deal with them.

I give them the forms they need to sign to check in, but then the pilot pretends to drop his phone. He then looks at me and laughs, saying ""wow, look at that! I can't believe I almost dropped it!"" It was so cheesy, so I just gave him a ""Ya, but you didn't tho"". 

At that point, that captain asked for some waters they got as part of their special reservation, with a snack included. At this point, the pilot chimed in and claimed that he wanted one too, and I obliged. When I came out, the pilot then said to me ""Dang, guess you can be nice after all"". Caught me super off guard, crazy! 

The thing was, we needed a number for their accounts in order to give them these rewards, I didn't think to collect them til after. The captain gave me his when I asked, but the pilot didn't have his so I just let him go. But after things were done he came back down and gave me his phone number.

This is where I f****d up! I thought his phone number was so that I could pull up his account number in our system, which I did. Not thinking about it, I immediately tore it up and threw it away. Afterwards I went to go make coffee, and apparently while I was gone the pilot came looking for me like some kind of lost puppy...

It wasn't til after I got back and the pilot was already gone that my coworker clued me in to how I messed up. Even all this time later I still feel like such an idiot! Now I can't help but wonder if we would've hit it off or something and I'm crushing on the guy. I also can't just pull up his number off our system and call him that way as that would be VERY illegal so fml. Seriously this guy was so hot this sucks so much

I used to be a very big bar rat and party girl in general but now my evenings are spent doing quiet activities... like diamond painting and coloring (and silently praying to the christmas version of jesus my sharpener doesnt wake my cellmate up.) My change in priorities has resulted in disinterest from my former friend group (which I totally get) but I still crave adult interaction. 

I fear that if I continue down this path, i could become sociopathic (joke). Honestly though I just want a buddy to bullshit with. I want something to keep me sane during torture worthy paw patrol reenactments (while its streaming simultaneously). I want to have a back and forth... an exchange of wit and humor with a grown up. I want to have someone to back me up that my toddler is bat shit crazy after he scolds me about how I ""did not listen"" to his illogical demands that his Dino nuggies be cooked vertically. If you're looking for someone who understands the chaos of balancing work, and sane adult life in all its variants... im your girl. 

Trigger warnings as follows:

I have a potty mouth.
I have a dark sense of humor (side effect of line of work).
P.C. principal and I would NOT be friends. 

If we are likely to not get along, we dont need to experiment. Seeking a friend to add to my days as a highlight... I dont have time to red ink everything I think or say out of fear i might hurt someone's feelings. 

So yea, let's connect. I promise to bring the laughs and genuine support/empathy when needed. Bonus points if you also appreciate/allow 2 AM meme exchanges because sleep is a myth and filters are for coffee.

Ever find yourself constantly looking around, waiting for someone to give you the green light that you've ""made it""? üëÄ Yeah, I've been there too. And here's a truth bomb: if you're doing this, you're giving away your power.



**Real Success is an Inside Job**



Success isn't about:

‚Ä¢ Gold stars from others

‚Ä¢ Fancy titles

‚Ä¢ External approval



Success IS about:

‚Ä¢ Feeling aligned with YOUR values

‚Ä¢ Pursuing YOUR vision

‚Ä¢ Living authentically



**How to Take Back Your Power**



Here are the game-changing strategies I've learned:



**1. Define Success on YOUR Terms**

What actually lights you up? Not what your parents/society/Instagram thinks - what makes YOU feel alive? Write it down.



**2. Celebrate Your Wins (No Permission Needed)**

Crushed a goal? Took a scary step? Give yourself credit. Buy that fancy coffee. Do a victory dance. YOU decide what's worth celebrating.



**3. Progress Over Perfection**

Every step forward counts. Stumbles are just part of the journey, not stop signs.



**The Bottom Line**



Success is an inside job. No one can give it to you. No one can take it away. Unless YOU let them.

-To her, lemon mint gum is tasty and refreshing, she always makes sure to have some stocked

She also tolerates spice and cold pretty well compared to the rest of us, and our Little can't handle pain. As for music, we definitely have shared favorites, but if there's a song I love that another doesn't, to them, when it plays, it's ""just noise"".

Initially all I could get were weak and bitter shots, which after trying different strengths, grind adjustment and water adjustment, I managed to improve upon apart from using the ground coffee bypass option, which till tastes weak and bitter. 

I used 3 different types of beans (Costco house blend, grind house blend and grumpy mule, plus grind house blend decaf ground coffee), but after many shots, adjustments and lots of frustration, the best I could do is get it to a drinkable but not massively enjoyable coffee with the grumpy mule beans. 

I finally gave up and bought lavazza beans as I had used in previous delonghi manifica bean to cup for over 12 years. This at least gave me something comparable to work against. 

I sit here now with a better coffee (setting water to 30ml, strength to 5 and grind to 2) that is a double shot americano with some milk, but still not comparable to what the delonghi managed and it is still a bit weak tasting, the crema is almost non existent having put the hot water and milk in first. 

So the question is, am I doing something wrong still after all the adjustment and around 60-80 shots now, is this machine faulty in some way or should I just give up and get another delonghi?

Business-casual pantsuit, no visible signs of mental illness or performance art, just calmly stabbing the foil pouch with that weird little straw and sucking it dry in three long, unblinking pulls. No phone. No earbuds. No visible coping mechanisms. It wasn‚Äôt ironic. It wasn‚Äôt kitsch. It wasn‚Äôt giving anything. She was just doing it. Drinking a child‚Äôs lunchbox juice in complete spiritual neutrality while the rest of us negotiated our delicate, performative breakfasts. oat milk lattes, sad protein bars, $19 smoothies.

At first I thought maybe she was neurodivergent, like in the increasingly fashionable Tumblr sense. no. There was something too smooth about her presence. Too composed. She wasn‚Äôt masking; she had transcended the need to. I watched her flatten the pouch with two slaps, like a soldier folding a flag.

But in the same way seeing a child in political merch is uncomfortable. Like, why do you have access to this aesthetic? What are you trying to tell me? She looked like someone who unironically references their Myers-Briggs type during foreplay.

After she left, I stood there unsure of whether I‚Äôd just seen a radical act of individualism or a symptom of civilizational rot. And the worst part was, I kind of respected her. Not admired ‚Äî respected, the way you respect a sea creature that has survived unchanged since the Cambrian explosion. Or a man who eats drywall.

1l0j0c1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoCodeCommunity/comments/1l0j0c1/godaddy_alternatives/,GoDaddy Alternatives,"Remember when choosing a web host felt like picking your first smartphone? You'd go with the biggest name, trust the flashy ads, and hope for the best. That's exactly how millions of website owners ended up with GoDaddy ‚Äì and why so many are now desperately searching for alternatives.

I've been in the hosting game for over eight years now, and I've watched countless business owners get burned by renewals that doubled overnight, support tickets that took days to resolve, and performance that made their websites crawl slower than dial-up internet. The **good news**? There are hosting providers out there that'll treat your website (and wallet) with the respect they deserve.

Whether you're running a personal blog, scaling an e-commerce empire, or managing client websites, this guide will walk you through the best GoDaddy alternatives that actually deliver on their promises. We've tested performance, compared pricing, and even dealt with their support teams at 3 AM (because let's be honest, websites don't choose convenient times to break).

# Why You Need a GoDaddy Alternative in 2025

# The Price Shock That's Driving Everyone Away

Here's what typically happens with GoDaddy: You sign up for that sweet $1.99/month deal, feeling pretty smart about your purchase. Fast forward to renewal time, and suddenly you're staring at a $14.99/month bill. **That's a 650% increase!** It's like ordering a coffee for $2 and getting charged $13 when you come back next week.

I found GoDaddy's price-to-value ratio disappointing. It offers fewer features than I have come to expect from modern hosting providers, especially at this price point. With Hostinger's starting price at $2.69/month and Bluehost's $1.99/month, both offering more generous feature sets even with their cheapest plans, GoDaddy's introductory pricing of $6.99/month with fewer features feels overly expensive.

# Security Concerns That Should Worry You

Just when you thought things couldn't get worse, the Federal Trade Commission dropped a bombshell in January 2025. The FTC alleges in its complaint that, since 2018, GoDaddy has failed to implement reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect and monitor its website-hosting environments for security threats, and misled customers about the extent of its data security protections on its website

That's not exactly the kind of headline you want to see about your hosting provider, especially when your website contains customer data or business information.

# The Support Nightmare

Ever tried calling GoDaddy support? It's like being trapped in phone tree purgatory. Their customer service is not good, because the person attending the calls are not technical and ask to hold the line while consulting with experts. That takes 20-30 mins. When your website is down and every minute feels like an hour, waiting 30 minutes just to talk to someone who can actually help is absolutely infuriating.

# Limited Features for Growing Websites

GoDaddy might work fine if you're planning to run a basic website forever. But the moment you want to add advanced features, optimize for speed, or scale your traffic, you'll hit walls faster than a bird flying into a clean window. Many modern hosting providers include features like staging environments, advanced caching, and developer tools as standard ‚Äì things GoDaddy charges extra for or doesn't offer at all.

# Top GoDaddy Alternatives for Different Needs

# Best Overall Alternative: Hostinger

**Pricing**: Starting at $2.69/month  
**Best For**: Beginners to intermediate users wanting great value

Hostinger has quietly become the hosting industry's best-kept secret. While everyone's fighting over the ""enterprise"" market, Hostinger focuses on giving regular people exceptional hosting without the enterprise price tag.

**What makes Hostinger special:**

* **Lightning-fast speeds** thanks to LiteSpeed servers and built-in caching
* **Free domain** included with annual plans (that's $12-15 saved right there)
* **100GB storage** even on the cheapest plan
* **Weekly automated backups** included
* **30-day money-back guarantee** that they actually honor

Hostinger offers more features for less. Starting at $2.69/month, it includes a free domain, email, and backups ‚Äì features GoDaddy charges extra for, despite its $6.99/month starting price.

The interface is incredibly user-friendly too. I've set up websites for clients who barely know how to send emails, and they had no trouble managing their Hostinger accounts.

# WordPress Specialists: Bluehost

**Pricing**: Starting at $1.99/month  
**Best For**: WordPress websites of all sizes

Bluehost isn't just another hosting company slapping ""WordPress"" on their marketing materials. Bluehost is officially endorsed by WordPress so if you want to build a new site using the CMS you're definitely in the right place. This official endorsement means they've met WordPress.org's strict hosting standards.

**Why WordPress users love Bluehost:**

* **One-click WordPress installation** that actually works
* **Automatic WordPress updates** so you never fall behind on security
* **WordPress-specific support** team that understands the platform
* **Free SSL certificate** (crucial for SEO and trust)

These plans come bundled with a customizable storefront theme, marketing credits, various shopping carts, and more.

# Cloud Hosting Excellence: CloudWays

**Pricing**: Starting at $11/month  
**Best For**: Growing businesses, developers, and performance-focused websites

Here's where things get really interesting. While traditional shared hosting crams hundreds of websites onto a single server, **CloudWays** takes a completely different approach. They give you the power of cloud hosting without the complexity of managing servers yourself.

**What makes CloudWays a game-changer:**

CloudWays doesn't own servers ‚Äì instead, they partner with the best cloud providers in the business. Cloudways works with 5 different cloud networks to deliver advanced hosting solutions for various use cases. Its prices start at just $10 per month for a Digital Ocean plan with 1GB of RAM, 25GB of storage, and 1TB of bandwidth.

You can choose from:

* **DigitalOcean** (best for most websites)
* **AWS** (enterprise-grade reliability)
* **Google Cloud** (cutting-edge technology)
* **Vultr** (global reach)
* **Linode** (developer-friendly)

**Performance that'll make you smile:** Based on our 12-month data, Cloudways excels in TTFB and load-handling performance. We're talking about websites that load in under 500 milliseconds ‚Äì fast enough to keep both visitors and Google happy.

**Scaling that actually works:** Remember how I mentioned hitting walls with GoDaddy? CloudWays eliminates that frustration completely. When you create a new website at Cloudways, you can choose any cloud host of your choice and server size which you can always scale whenever required. Need more resources for a traffic spike? It takes literally two clicks and happens instantly.

**Support that gets it:** The team is very responsive, and the agents we spoke with were knowledgeable and very happy to help. Unlike GoDaddy's support roulette, CloudWays support agents actually understand hosting technology.

**Why I recommend CloudWays:** After testing dozens of hosting providers, CloudWays consistently delivers the best combination of performance, reliability, and scalability. Yes, it costs more than basic shared hosting, but when you factor in the performance improvements and peace of mind, it's actually cheaper in the long run. If we compare it with its top competitors like WP Engine, Kinsta, and WPX, Cloudways pricing is certainly less expensive. Cloudways pricing starts at $11/mo while WP Engine starts at $24/mo, Kinsta starts at $35/mo, and WPX starts at $24.99/mo.

# Budget Champions: A2 Hosting

**Pricing**: Starting at $3/month  
**Best For**: Budget-conscious users who don't want to sacrifice quality

A2 Hosting is one of the best GoDaddy alternatives on the market for users who are on a budget. Shared hosting plans at A2 start at only $3 per month, which is only about half of what GoDaddy charges.

But here's the kicker ‚Äì A2 doesn't just compete on price. They offer something almost unheard of in the hosting world: A2's famous 'anytime money-back guarantee'. Thanks to this generous and unique refund policy, users can benefit from risk-free hosting for the whole duration of their contract.

**A2 Hosting highlights:**

* **SSD storage** on all plans (faster than traditional hard drives)
* **Free site migration** from your current host
* **24/7 support** that doesn't make you wait forever
* **Global data centers** for better performance worldwide

# Feature-Rich Hosting: HostGator

**Pricing**: Starting at $2.75/month  
**Best For**: Users wanting lots of features without complexity

HostGator has been around since 2002, and they've used that experience to create hosting plans that just work. HostGator comes in a close second on our list of GoDaddy alternatives. With good value for money, HostGator has some of the best shared hosting plans on the market.

**What sets HostGator apart:**

* **Unlimited disk space and bandwidth** (within reason)
* **Free website builder** with drag-and-drop functionality
* **45-day money-back guarantee** (longer than most competitors)
* **99.9% uptime guarantee** with compensation if they fail to meet it

When we started up a conversation on the HostGator live chat, answers were quick and helpful. Their support quality has improved significantly over the years.

# How to Choose the Right GoDaddy Alternative

# For Beginners Just Getting Started

**Go with Hostinger or Bluehost.** Both offer excellent onboarding experiences, plenty of tutorials, and support teams that won't make you feel stupid for asking basic questions.

# For WordPress Users

**Bluehost is your best bet.** The [WordPress.org](http://WordPress.org) endorsement isn't just marketing fluff ‚Äì it means they've proven their WordPress expertise to the people who actually built the platform.

# For Growing Businesses or High-Traffic Sites

**CloudWays is worth every penny.** The performance difference is night and day, and the ability to scale instantly means you'll never lose customers due to slow loading times or crashes.

# For Tight Budgets

**A2 Hosting delivers remarkable value.** Their anytime money-back guarantee means you can try them risk-free, and their performance often surprises people who expect budget hosting to be terrible.

# For Feature Lovers

**HostGator packs in more features than a Swiss Army knife.** If you want unlimited everything and lots of built-in tools, they're hard to beat.

# Making the Switch: Migration Made Simple

Switching hosts doesn't have to be scarier than a root canal. Most quality hosting providers offer **free migration services** ‚Äì and I strongly recommend using them instead of trying to DIY your way through it.

**Before you switch:**

1. **Backup everything** ‚Äì even if your new host offers migration, having your own backup is crucial
2. **Check your current contract** ‚Äì some hosts charge cancellation fees
3. **List all your domains and email accounts** ‚Äì you don't want to forget anything important

**During migration:**

* Don't cancel your old hosting immediately
* Test everything on the new host before switching DNS
* Update any hardcoded URLs that might point to your old server

**Pro tip**: Schedule your migration during low-traffic periods. While good hosts minimize downtime, it's better to be safe than sorry.

# The Bottom Line: Time to Break Free

Sticking with subpar hosting because ""it's what you know"" is like staying in a bad relationship because changing seems too hard. The hosting landscape has evolved dramatically, and you deserve better than overpriced renewals, mediocre support, and security concerns.

Whether you choose the budget-friendly reliability of Hostinger, the WordPress excellence of Bluehost, or the scalable power of **CloudWays**, you'll wonder why you waited so long to make the switch. Your website (and your blood pressure) will thank you.

The best time to switch was yesterday. The second-best time is right now. Pick a provider from this list, take advantage of their free migration offers, and finally get the hosting experience your website deserves.

*Ready to make the switch? Most of these providers offer free trials or money-back guarantees, so you can test drive your new hosting without commitment. Your future self will thank you for making the leap.*",1,1748762466.0,NoCodeCommunity,0,1.0,False

1l0ixkc,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1l0ixkc/i_feel_ashamed_and_no_reason_to_be_proud_of/,I feel ashamed and no reason to be proud of myself after receiving my master's degree and feel like I failed.,"I (24M) graduated with my Masters Degree in Marine Science May 3rd and feel I have nothing to show for it. This story starts after I was accepted for the school I applied for in Florida a little before completing my undergrad and getting my Bachelors of Science degree in biology in Missouri. Before going to the school to get your masters its always recommended be in communication with one of the professors there to be your advisors as you work on your thesis which I did and was in contact with. After graduating with my degree I got ready to move to Florida to start school and soon met with my professor in person to start working on my thesis (process for thesis pick a topic, find advisor, write a proposal, experiment, and thesis defense).

The semester begins and I was hit with bad news when we had our first meeting, due to a combination of factors for my advisor the main ones being that due to his age and budget cuts from the school he was forced to retire early at the end of the semester, leaving me without an advisor. For me to graduate I'm required to complete my classes and a thesis to get an MS (Masters of Science), I'm required to have an advisor for my thesis and was basically told that I would have to look for a new one. That Fall semester I had two big problem trying to find a job after moving to a new state I lived on campus so housing wasn't issue but I did need money for stability and a new advisor to work with for my thesis. This problem continued through the spring semester in which since I was struggling with looking for a job and looking for an advisor I deiced to just focus on classes for the time being. Other Professors told me that its not uncommon for grad students to have to stay for a bit longer for their degree in which I understood and believed them so I took what they said in good faith and tried not to stress about possible being here for 3 or 4 years. They said if I needed help just ask (I asked and they didn't help but that will come up later). I was doing good in my classes to the point that the amount of classes I was taking I would be done with my required credits for class by the end of my 3rd semester. While in the mean time I was working on my proposal figured I might as well be productive and ask professors to take a look at it and see what I can do to improve it.

During that time of me taking my classes I asked all the professors if they were looking on taking on any grad students and would be my advisor, every time I asked I was deferred to someone else. I ended up asking the entire department in which I was delivered with one of the three responses they were already advising to many students (The lowest was 3 and the highest was 15), they feel with what they specialize in they couldn't help me with what I wanted to do after reading my proposal, or the professor was to new and couldn't take on anyone at the moment. Since they couldn't help me with finding an advisor I asked if they could help me find work in which they said they don't know about anything at the moment but would let me know if they find anything (they never did). I was apply for jobs of all kinds left and right that by the time Summer was around I applied to 836 individual jobs and internships (this is not including the amount that I applied to the same job multiple times). Summer 2024 rolls around in which I really needed money after the first year of school and was only able to get two jobs one at a coffee shop and the other at pet groomer. I no longer have either job the coffee shop I was laid off due to budget cuts and was the newest worker, the pet grooming place was flooded and destroyed by hurricane Helene.

In my third semester I'm struggling in my well being, financially, and still didn't have an advisor I was asking my department so much that they eventually had start referring me to teachers in other departments on campus. Financially I had to start donating blood and plasma to pay for school and bills, start pulling all nighters to keep up with class, and still was asking for help finding work and a advisor. Eventually a professor was willing to accept me though she was out side of my department and I wanted to create a sound scape of a estuary and she worked with birds not even specializing in marine or aquatic just birds the only reason she wanted to work with me was cause I was able to get hydrophones from a grant proposal and some of the professors that rejected me still wanted to use the hydrophones I got from the grant(which pissed me off like you couldn't help me and you still wanted to use the stuff I got with the work I done).

I was happy that I was finally able to get an advisor, I showed her my proposal that was good enough for the grant and she said I had to redo the whole thing. I asked what I should do to fix it and she told me to read more papers on the topic. That response I wont lie mad me mad but I swallowed my pride thinking hey I may not know what I'm doing and she is a professional and tried rewriting the whole thing trying to look at the papers and find what I'm missing. My second attempt she told me that it was to complex and to follow the k.i.s.s method (keep it simple stupid) and told me to try reading more papers. So tried again and keep it simple and then she said it was lacking and wasn't enough. I stated asking more and more specific questions and tried to figure out what I was missing and instead of actually giving me advice she once again deferred me to just reading more paper again. She was quick to critique and call out the flaws and problems with the proposal but never actually offered any solutions. I kept trying to get it right in which school, looking for work, and the thesis started taking its toll on me emotionally, mentally, and physically.

The last semester really the last month was where I was just screwed over. With all of required classes done I could put all of my effort into trying to find a job and working on my proposal for my thesis. Making multiple attempts over and over I finally made a good enough proposal for her to actually read over and try to submit it for approval. I was prepared for being here for another year or two to get my MS since all my classes are done I could put all my focus in the thesis. I got and email on the April 2nd that changed how id have to do everything. From her over simplifying it said ""Your proposal is still not there and with our last talk and considering your health and situation you should consider switching from a MS to a MA (Master of Arts). I know your anxious to find a job but a MA could still help you find a job."" Reading I was so many thing frustrated, angry, discouraged, disappointed breaking myself finding any kind of job that I could do to pay bills, loosing sleep to try and get my work done, downing myself trying force myself to believe that if I push a little bit further to be able I could reach my goal and all that was worth it. In going to the people that said they would help every step along the way I was deferred to someone else every time instead of actually getting help. Then a week later news hit our school with a decision that was made 7% of the faculty and staff were laid off this included all of the arts faculty and teachers that were hired within the year. This included the advisor I was currently working with, that was the moment I finally broke down.

So with this it was that either I try and stay with a school in a understaff department in which I asked everyone who deferred me to someone else, try and suddenly transfer to a new school once again this was during the last month of school being hit with this information, or just take the switch the MS to the MA and graduate this May. With limited options and money I was forced to graduate early and to move back to the Midwest in what feels like shame in not completing the degree went in for. I feel ashamed in that after all of that work, effort, and stress I understand I got my degree and that some people would see it as an accomplishment but after graduation I didn't feel pride I got a piece of paper, debt, and no job. I understand that I just graduated but as of my time from graduation I have though a combination of indeed, LinkedIn, zip recruiter, handshake, AZA jobs, Pathways to science, and many more have applied to over 4783 jobs between my time in grad school to now and in every interview in which I brought up my masters I got rejected due to it being an MA and not and MS. I want to say encouraged and I'm trying to constantly hearing it will get better is just draining, asking for help just hearing the same answer from a different person after a certain point just wears you down.",2,1748762161.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1l0iwyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/pmp/comments/1l0iwyp/pmp_exam_day_my_impressions_and_tips_for_the_day/,"PMP Exam Day- My impressions and tips for the day itself (I PASSED, April 2025)","\>>reposted cos original title was misleading. This is about the day of the exam not about the study prep. 

So I finished my 35 PDUs at the start of March and booked an exam date somewhere that didnt feel too scarily close; 19 April in fact.  
The closest test centre to me with any available dates was actually in another country. So that was a bummer but because the exam was so important to me I ended up booking a hotel for the night before and allowed myself all day to get there (its only about 2hrs on train but still). This worked well but it was a big investment of course and if I had failed well....  
Anyway. Arrived at the hotel the day before and then deliberately walked to the test centre so I knew exactly where it was and how long it took to get there.

1. Highly recommend you dry run getting to the test centre, whether you are driving or on public transport.
2. Take your breaks in the exam and definitely EAT something. Your brain needs fuel. I brought a banana and walnuts (omega 3s!). The banana was ideal and really helped sharpen me up in the hour or so after consumption. I also drank coffee (available at the test centre).
3. Think about how the environment will be different to where you are currently doing your full length exams. I work off a laptop ALWAYS and did expect a monitor in the exam (I was right) but what I didnt expect was that an issue I have with my eyes where they react to too much light from a close by screen was triggered by the big ol' monitor. So my eyes were dry and itchy which I could handle but with a bit of thought I could have prepared for that (brought my screen glasses and had some eye drops waiting for in the break). Some people have reported a lot of noise outside the test centre; I didnt have that but indeed its something to consider. I also had to use a mouse which I wasnt used to (but again, I did expect this). The monitor meant I had to move my neck way more than I was used to (the question was stretched out across, to me, acres of screen!) so through the exam I started to get a headache. Pathetic I realise but Im just saying think about how it might be. The room was cool (ideal for me but as others have said, perhaps dress in layers?) and not bright. all the cubicles faced the wall. theres a camera watching you and there was some equipment on the desk not relevant for PMP exam. Chair and desk height were great for me but if you are maybe very tall or short think about maybe you have to compromise if the desk doesnt adjust. I mean just dont let something small surprise you on the day really; expect and accept everything.
4. Im doing this all out of order but anyway...at the test centre, there were maybe 10 people at my timeslot, some doing PMP but mostly doing other tests. Tests that were shorter actually. The proctor or test centre supervisor was lovely man very understanding and very clear. All my personal belongings go in a locker. I mentioned I would want my snacks at the breaks and he said to take them and put them in the locker by the front so he could see easily when I took them out I wasnt getting study notes or anything. I also had my yellow good luck teddy sitting with the snacks (he wasnt allowed in the room!).  I had to show empty pockets and also that behind my ears there were no devices. He gave me blank paper and a pen. No phone also while waiting, everything in the locker. Then come the day, come the hour :), we all lined up to go into the test room. The proctor took us in one by one and gave us a seat. ie- I did not start at 10am as I thought, I probably started at 10:12 or something. Of course I still had my full 4 hours but just that it wasnt exactly at 10.
5. I had noticed, at home that every single test exam I did I ALWAYS failed the first question. It became a point of amusement tbh. All I am saying is that if the first question throws you, dont worry. If the first 10 questions are awful, dont panic. Either flag them or accept them. You will get in the groove. And you are anyway, there, you are committed. Just give it your best; in the absolute worst case scenario it will be worth it for the practice.
6. Over 9 practice full length exams I finished the questions in MAX 3 hours so I was very confident regarding time management. However!! I found the exam reallllllllly hard; really. Questions are shorter than in SH exams but the phrasing was still distinctly different imo. And I am native English speaker. Sure I was probably stressed but traditionally (OK, 25 years ago when in college!!) I am a really good test taker; chilled and good results. Anyway....point is....regardless of why, I NEEDED ALL the 4 hours to complete the exam despite at home finishing fast. Now, unlike at home I did flag some questions for review; maybe 4-8 in the first section of 60 and a full 12 in the last section of 60. Those were the hardest cos I was running really out of steam and was convinced I failed. If you already struggle with time of the full length exam I would say dont worry about what I said. I am obviously not as careful an exam taker; I tend to read fast and select an answer fast. You obviously, do not. Which is to your credit and it means, I think, that your time management is much, much more consistent and you will manage fine. PMI know what they are doing wrt time I genuinely do believe. The only reason I mention my shock that I needed all the 4 hours is in case anyone else is like me; currently doing exams well within the time- just keep in mind that the exam, because its an exam will likely slow you down; but dont panic.
7. Questions. I got honestly 50-60% waterfall questions so do NOT ignore that aspect. If you are PMI member, download the free Process Guide in pdf and read it. I wanted to read it but I couldnt face it! The free Agile guide and PMBOK7 guide I did download and read. These are good and short. I got one ""knowldge of SPI"" question; like is 0.89 good or bad kind of thing. .And I did get one EVM question which required the use of paper. That question was quite a relief tbh as it felt like something I could really be sure I could do (although, first time I did it my result DIDNT match ANY answer lol. So I picked a random answer and flagged the question. When I went back at the end of the exam I was much more relaxed and could see what I missed, recalculated and got a matching answer that Im 99% sure was correct \[and no, the answer I had randomly picked first time around was NOT the correct one\]). I got no drag and drop questions as fas as I can remember. Some questions seemed to bear no relation to the list of answers. In those cases (and in general for most scenario questions) you need to fall back on Risk Management. Anything thats stoppping your project running perfectly is a Risk in some size shape or form. So use your Risk handling knowledge to assess the scenario  (do I avoid, mitigate, accept etc) and pick the answer that matches best.

Good Luck to all; if you dont underestimate it and prep well you will be fine. I am sure of that.",2,1748762100.0,pmp,2,1.0,False

Feeling like I can't take any actions no matter how much I want to.,"Hi, I've never really posted before but reading all these posts is the first time I've felt so understood. I'm not diagnosed and I'm not seeking a diagnosis here, I could just really really use some advice or at least hear about some similar experiences if that is appropriate to ask for. I'm really sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, I mean no disrespect. If you can recommend any alternatives please do :)

I know all the things I want & need to do. Whether its for my self care, creativity, career, physical health, etc. I have such good strong plans, but I have absolutely no capability of taking action. It feels like putting myself out there in any way will ruin my life. I know the life I want to live, but there's some deep rooted wiring inhibiting me. I'm constantly torn between the person I want to be and the person I am.

Every blue moon I feel capable enough to take some action, as if my mindset shifted overnight. But  I usually end up feeling worse. I show up to the gym or a school or work event and can't help but worry that I'm on a prank show. Or that there is something very clearly off about me that everyone knows about but won't tell me. Like I'm an alien or robot and everyone knows but me. I just can't handle embarrassment of any kind, but I feel like it comes so easily to me.

I've done so much work, inner child stuff and meditating and etc and it's all helped a ton. I know my next step is to start taking intentional, consistent, self-motivated actions. I know the steps to reach my goals. I want to take them... theoretically. It's just as if the parts of me that ""gets up and does things"" and ""feels good about trying things"" don't work. I get so anxious to even start a homework assignment that I push it off and end up feeling guilty and terrible about myself, but I also feel like I didn't try hard enough if I start early.

Also, I am very grateful to have some really meaningful relationships, but I noticed that doing things feels a million times safer, easier, more enjoyable when these people are with me... especially if they are inviting me to join them on their activities rather than me inviting them to my activities (which I never do unless it's something we've done a ton before, like grabbing coffee).

1l0iole,https://i.redd.it/mkj5xr5wk94f1.jpeg,Help finding Similar style notepad,"TLDR - Running low on paper. Would like identical notepad but cannot find similar options. (Picture included. NOT the Padfolio btw just the pad)

My current pad is-
8.5‚Äùx11‚Äù Reverse Cornell style pad. With college ruled lines in the Noted section on the left. A Dotted Cue section on the Right. A Blank Summary section below.
I enjoy the minimalism and lightness of the lining, with the structure the layout offers. I cannot find similar replacements online in the same style or tone. Help?

End here if you don‚Äôt want a rant about my Padfolio but-

I got this back in February as a Personal gift / Business expense. I just began my new company with two partners and wanted to find a ‚Äúbinder with notepad‚Äù to serve as a mobile office. I wanted something that was simple, looked decent and hand pockets. 
I really didn‚Äôt think Target would have exactly what I wanted. But I saw this (ASMBLD Padfolio by BlueSky).
By no means is $20 a lot of money. But I‚Äôve never spent that much on a binder or anything like this before. 
So I grabbed it.
It deserved better than Dollar store Highlighters and Pens. So I grabbed-
$11  8-Pack PILOT, G2 Premium Gel Roller Pens, G2 Rainbow Colors Pack
$10 Sharpie¬Æ Pocket Style Highlighters, Chisel Tip, Assorted, 6/PK
$7 GraphGear Auto Drafting Pencil
$10 Notepad 5‚Äùx8‚Äù pack of 5
(I also stuffed a clipboard without the clip in the pocket the notepad goes into to give it giving it rigidity)

All in all it was roughly $60 for this new notepad. But after the last 4 months I am very happy to have spent that.
In fact with the Quality the Padfolio is in after these 4 months it gives me confidence that once I reach my 1year mark with it I will invest in a more expensive Padfolio as a reward. Somewhere in the $100-$200 range. 
I‚Äôm writing, planning and Tracking much better than before. I am using a Pencil (rather than pen) more than I ever have in the last 10 years.
I consider it a treat to step away from the Computer doing work and sitting at a desk, table or Coffee shop and write in my Padfolio. 
I really enjoy it. I want to keep enjoying it.

I had woken up and didn't know if she was still alive. Barely, took a few minutes for her to wake up. Very slow and low energy. Made the appt for 1 yesterday and ordered in all the foods she loved and various chocolate items and she got coffee 2 days in a row!!  She loved her day and all the activities. The only thing missing, was my husband and her day would have been the best ever. But, she went inside to lie down as it was better on her even though she loves the sun so much. 

Woke up, she had a great morning. The vet came, we talked about her health and vet agreed, she wouldn't feel okay doing hospice palliative care. So, I held my sweet girl, and the husband held our tiny dog. I helped the vet carry her out. Made the arrangements. Etc. 

Came in to the husband being insanely angry at me because I killed his dog. I asked him why he had been putting her in my room for the past few months, and he said he couldnt handle waking up to her gone. Oh. Okay. What??? He has been making jabs since and calls me a murderer every time he sees me. 

This has been the hardest ever. And for my Tiny Dog. It is her first time as an only pet. I mean, the husband has a cat but she pees everywhere and if he isnt watching her, she can't hang out. So, cats stays in his spacious room and I make sure she gets a few hours out 3-4x a week. So, me and Tiny have just been trying to figure out the things, and grieving, and playing together, and there is this man. Yelling at Tiny and at me. 

Has anyone else dealt with this?? It's, its so hard. Missing my heart dog and dealing with keeping Tiny feeling okay and this person being awful. It's not his first loss. ",2,1748760945.0,Petloss,2,1.0,False

1l0ilka,https://www.reddit.com/r/dysautonomia/comments/1l0ilka/i_found_the_cause/,I Found The Cause,"Greetings all. 2 months ago, I made a post titled ""Will I ever get better?""

I've been struggling with symptoms consistent with dysautonomia for about a year or so. I experienced things like migraines, dizziness, very frequent and strong palpitations, tachycardia with little movement, anxiety, panic attacks, abnormal response to coffee and other stimulants, and the list goes on.

I'm writing this post to let you all know you should probably go get tested for H Pylori. I tested positive a month ago and found that this annoying bacterium can be responsible for many of these symptoms. Since completing treatment, at least half of my symptoms are gone. Hell, even last week I was sipping coffee, eating in n out, and going to the gym again like my life was normal and I couldn't believe it. Although now I am dealing with other stomach issues from it like suspected ulcers. I have to once again follow a strict diet and take it easy since I got too excited too fast and damaged my stomach more.

The point is, if you are one of the ""lucky"" ones (depending on how you see it) your dysautonomia could be caused by H Pylori. Look it up and read the possible symptoms. Aside from the textbook upper abdominal pain and burping, I read so many horror stories of people complaining of panic attacks, palpitations, anxiety, headaches, etc. all because of this bacteria. It can seriously affect the nervous system in many people who have it while others can harbor it with no issues. 

If you're unsure why you are having symptoms consistent with dysautonomia, it's worth a shot in my opinion. My symptoms have improved about 50% since eradicating it and I have more hope for the future. I remember when I was positive for it, if I even took a small sip of caffeine my palpitations would go crazy, and I would get a hot flash. Now, that doesn't happen anymore. 

Hope this helps someone out there.",8,1748760861.0,dysautonomia,0,1.0,False

**4. Could They Have Reached the Best Answer?**

‚îî 4-1. Possibility of Compromise

‚îî 4-2. Methods of Compromise

‚îî 4-3. If Compromise Fails

‚îî 4-4. Possibility of Maelle‚Äôs Canvas Addiction Improving

**4. Could They Have Reached the Best Answer?**

As examined above in section 3, if all three had each taken just one step toward compromise, they could have easily reached a happy ending for everyone. If even one among the three had listened to all the stories of their loved ones instead of suppressing them violently, a lot could have changed.

Of course, one might wonder, *‚ÄòIs such a compromise realistically possible?‚Äô* If so, it is necessary to examine whether that compromise is ‚Äòrealistically‚Äô possible.

**4-1. Possibility of Compromise**  
In the real world, we often see people pursuing common interests or making small concessions to achieve the greatest happiness. Of course, there are also many cases where people reject each other and mutually destroy themselves. Especially those engrossed in game theory concepts like 'prisoner‚Äôs dilemma' and Nash equilibrium often claim that ""humans will inevitably betray if the gain from betrayal is large."" But is that really true? It is not.

In reality, the total gain from cooperation is always greater than the total gain from betrayal, which leads to concessions and compromises. This is because the real world is a space where countless people interact simultaneously, and a single act of betrayal can prevent future cooperation from many others.

Of course, if one person is overwhelmingly powerful‚Äîfor example, one rich individual among many poor people, or a superpower nation among several impoverished countries‚Äîthe 'balance of power' breaks down, and the predictions of game theory come into play.

Therefore, moderate concessions and negotiations require two conditions for both sides: 1) the gain obtained through concession and 2) the loss suffered if betrayal occurs. Without the first, the need for negotiation disappears; without the second, the possibility of betrayal increases.

As you might have guessed from the mention of game theory so far, the compromise plan I proposed in section 3 has a two-track structure of 1) concession and cooperation conditions and 2) betrayal and punishment conditions to enable tit-for-tat. Both Renoir and Maelle have favorable terms to offer each other and ways to retaliate if the other betrays them. Therefore, from a theoretical standpoint, the possibility of cooperation is very high‚Äîassuming they think carefully and act accordingly.

Ah, what about Verso? Verso‚Äôs position is different. He has no conditions to offer. In reality, in such cases, a third party often mediates between the two and gains benefits. Sometimes the mediator gains even more than the two parties. This frequently happens in human or international relations. If you just thought of a country that starts with 'S' and ends with 'S,' you are correct.

\-

Also, there is a thought that ""humans are emotional animals, so cooperation is impossible."" This is a very foolish idea, firstly because humans possess reason stronger than emotion, and secondly because the instinct to avoid a 'Mexican standoff' exists even before reason.

Let‚Äôs look at emotions first: negative emotions such as anger, hatred, and jealousy often worsen situations. Many people misunderstand that the 'mind' is a single entity that changes in real-time, but in fact, hundreds of thousands of switches in the brain turn on and off depending on the situation to make judgments. Anger and hatred are just types of amygdala responses, more like neural reactions than concrete entities. Therefore, if handled calmly and patiently, reason can soothe these emotions.

If you have read the previous columns, you might have seen mentions of the survival mode that activates amygdala responses and suppresses frontal lobe responses, causing humans to become enraged‚Äîthis is the fight-or-flight switch. Yes, that‚Äôs why all good negotiations are basically done after eating well, sleeping enough, and calming the mind comfortably and leisurely. Only then can the prefrontal cortex be fully activated, enabling rational and high-level thinking.

The three people at the final stage have emotions and stubbornness, but they also possess reason. They also have enough time and a conducive environment for conversation. Therefore, it is difficult to say that the possibility of compromise completely vanished due to momentary emotions. I will explain this more in detail below.

\-

Secondly, avoiding the ""Mexican standoff"" is an instinctive reaction. What we call reason or emotion is actually a kind of 'judgment system' developed to continue the species in the natural world. And 'instinct' is also a part of that judgment system.

Things like finding symmetrical faces beautiful, disgust toward spiders or snakes, attraction to sexual appeal, desire for tasty food, pursuit of happiness, and avoidance of unhappiness are all part of a vast process for survival and gene transmission.

Even animals, which we say lack 'reason' and act only on instinct, still judge when to attack, when to defend, or when to compromise.

On the plains, hyenas often eat leftovers from lions. If hyenas try to forcibly take the lion‚Äôs prey, fights break out. If many members die in these fights, survival becomes difficult afterward. Conversely, lions also yield leftover food to hyenas because lions risk injury or danger to their young or weak members when fighting hyenas.

Simply put, whether human or beast, everyone instinctively tries to avoid a 'Mexican standoff' because, in many cases, such a standoff ends in mutual destruction‚Äîa fact understandable even without reason.

The most famous real-world example of avoiding a ""Mexican standoff"" is the Cold War. Everyone feared nuclear war, so despite the production of many nuclear missiles, they were never launched.

Thus, at the level of instinct before emotion, humans possess the instinct to avoid the worst-case scenario. This clearly indicates the 'possibility of compromise,' so the claim that 'humans are emotional animals, so compromise is impossible' is not logically valid.

\-

Moreover, Renoir, Maelle, and Verso do not hate, resent, or rage against each other. All their instincts, emotions, and reason are seeking the possibility of compromise.

The problem is that the situation becomes complicated when the three suddenly act selfishly, overpower the others with violence, or behave like mentally ill people trying to ruin the situation. Frankly speaking, this part is very artificial narratively. It is not necessarily inevitable. I will deal with this narrative issue more thoroughly in column #6, so let‚Äôs leave it here for now.

**4-2. Methods of Compromise**  
Earlier, I said that ''they have enough time and favorable conditions for dialogue.'' In reality, cooperation often fails not because of issues of reason or emotion, but due to a lack of time and suitable conditions. In that sense, their possibility of compromise can be considered significantly high.

The way they utilize the given time and conditions is as follows:  
(1) Renoir and Maelle slowly put down the knives they aimed at each other, kick them far away beyond their reach, then relieve the tense atmosphere between them by sharing embraces, kisses, and smiles.

(2) They spend time together enjoying a vacation on String Meadow coast, playing catch, ping pong, obstacle courses, building sandcastles, and other recreational activities to understand each other sufficiently. However, volleyball must be excluded. In this worldview, volleyball excessively damages a person‚Äôs character. Less difficult and less stressful activities would be better.

(3) After enough rest, they prepare a large blackboard, sweet snacks, and fragrant coffee to hold a workshop where each explains their claims and reasons in detail to find a point of compromise. Perhaps a better plan than the one I suggested might emerge.

(4) The Lumi√®re citizens, including Rune and Sciel, can do their best to ensure this event proceeds joyfully because this issue is directly linked to the world‚Äôs survival. The only thing they must be careful about is refraining from serious crimes such as offering alcohol to Maelle, who is only sixteen.

(5) Verso mediates between Renoir and Maelle and acts as the workshop moderator, while playing music with Rune to create a good atmosphere. In fact, his role is the most important‚Äîmore the mediation than the playing.

Even if the entire process takes about three months, it is no problem. Those three months (100 days) are only a single day in reality.

**4-3. If Compromise Fails**  
Of course, in reality, unpredictable and outrageous events often occur without any plausibility, so the above compromise plan cannot be guaranteed to succeed. The compromise possibility and method I mentioned are merely indications of possibility, not certainties.

However, if one tries their best to compromise and still fails, the risks are much, almost entirely reduced compared to attempting violent suppression. As repeatedly mentioned in previous columns, when a person in a dangerous situation is treated aggressively, there is a higher chance of panic, hatred, or extreme behavior. Actually, the game proceeded that way too.

Many police officers in various countries receive training or are advised by seniors on the scene: when someone behaves dangerously and must be stopped, immediately aiming a gun and shouting ''Hands up, you bastard!'' risks escalating into the worst scenario (e.g., a shootout).

Therefore, unless the current situation is already the worst-case scenario (such as an ongoing shootout), even if the situation worsens and the worst is imminent, gently conveying friendly and empathetic words like ''Don't misunderstand, I only want to help you,'' ''Friend, I have children,'' or ''It‚Äôs still reversible; no fatal problems have occurred'' acts as a powerful safety mechanism to prevent catastrophe.

Many people in danger, on the brink of self-destructive or irreversible actions, regain restraint just by hearing one warm phrase like ''Uh... wait, this doesn‚Äôt seem like a good idea.'' And at the last moment, even a three-second hesitation can change a lot.

\-

Furthermore, these compromise attempts are excellent not only at avoiding a ''Mexican standoff'' to prevent the worst outcome but also greatly reduce the likelihood of cruel retaliation that often follows defeat by violence.

For example, if Renoir has made sufficient efforts to compromise before losing in violence, Maelle is very likely to return to reality even briefly. This is because the justification for Maelle‚Äôs extreme and destructive ''isolated death inside the canvas'' choice‚Äîthat if she leaves, Renoir will burn the canvas‚Äîdisappears. Therefore, after calming down sufficiently, she may change her mind, and those around her have more chances to persuade her.

If Maelle has tried to compromise enough before losing in violence, Renoir is likely to reconsider multiple times before destroying the canvas. He also feels uneasy about how Aline and Maelle might change after destroying it, and emotionally he does not want to destroy the canvas, which is a memento of his deceased son. Moreover, there is a possibility that he will take the best course by helping Maelle protect the Lumi√®re canvas from Aline and by monitoring and aiding Aline‚Äôs recovery.

Though less so than the above two cases, if Verso has tried enough to compromise before losing in violence, Maelle is more likely to treat him better than with the ''broken puppet doll'' punishment. She might treat him so he does not suffer, or instead of completely Gommage-ing him, might just stop time for him. There are many methods. How it is done is just a means; what matters is Maelle‚Äôs willingness to help him and ease his suffering.

**4-4. The Possibility of Maelle‚Äôs Canvas Addiction Improving**  
Many people say *‚ÄòMaelle‚Äôs canvas addiction is like drug addiction, and it can only be cured by destroying the Lumi√®re canvas.‚Äô* I also compared Maelle‚Äôs canvas addiction to drug addiction in a previous column.

However, real drugs and the canvas do not correspond one-to-one. The canvas does not cause addiction simply by use like real drugs do, nor does a single use damage the nervous system or internal organs.

The danger of the canvas only arises when someone *‚Äòexcessively‚Äô* indulges in it and stays *‚Äòtoo long.‚Äô* Renoir created many canvases and spent time inside them without any problem because he fundamentally recognized that it is a *‚Äòtype of virtual reality (for example, a game),‚Äô* understood the *‚Äòobvious fact‚Äô* that it must not erode reality, and enjoyed it as a safe play.

For example, real games are as safe as the canvas, but there are quite a few cases where people become addicted to games, leading to their lives falling apart or even death. These addicts do not only have the options of *‚Äòfacing reality and quitting all games‚Äô* or *‚Äòjust dying inside the game.‚Äô* They can clearly reduce their game use and find a balance with reality. Many doctors and scholars research this, and the reason the WHO classified gaming addiction as a disease code lies here. The important point I emphasize is the very clear fact that none of these researchers propose *‚Äòforcibly taking away and smashing the gaming devices‚Äô* as a treatment.

\-

Whether it is drugs, games, or anything else, humans are beings capable of attachment and obsession. For example, the reason many people fail at dieting is *physically* exactly the same as why they cannot voluntarily quit drugs. Dopamine activated when blood sugar spikes gives them happiness (a sugar high), and when that is abruptly cut off, it causes terrible pain (a sugar crash), which is why despite many diet foods and methods, most still fail at dieting.

The only way to overcome this and succeed at dieting is through the person‚Äôs own effort. If you confiscate all their food, they will find ways to get food by any means and may even resort to physical violence in the process. Only the person themselves can control their desire, and interference by others tends to significantly increase the likelihood of diet failure due to emotional backlash.

The mechanism of what is called *‚Äòwithdrawal symptoms from attachment (or adrenaline withdrawal symptoms)‚Äô* that occur when a human has attachment to something and then loses it happens exactly the same whether the attachment is to drugs, alcohol, coffee, food, games, or a loved person. The difference is that drugs can affect dopamine much more directly, rapidly, and violently than anything else.

Therefore, unlike real drugs, the *‚Äòrelatively safe‚Äô* canvas life is more likely to be treated by gradually reducing time spent going back and forth between the canvas and reality. In that case, the canvas could become a wonderful hobby that temporarily lets Maelle forget the pain of reality. Renoir is living proof of that.

**+. The Problem of Mental Illness**  
‚îî +1. Renoir  
‚îî +2. Clea  
‚îî +3. Painted Verso

**+. The Problem of Mental Illness**  
This part is somewhat distant from the original theme of this column, but I add it to explain a bit more about the previously mentioned ''mental illness'' and to supplement the problems each character has.

**+1. Renoir**  
On the surface, Mr. Renoir appears to be a very dignified gentleman. His manner is polite, his speech calm, and even when talking to the ''creatures'' that he could sweep away with a single gesture from his position, he does not forget courtesy. In reality, it is extremely rare to meet such people. We all know well how difficult it is to become a true gentleman.

However, a great gentleman is not necessarily a great father. When Verso told Maelle, ''You can freely move between the canvas and reality, so go in and out,'' Maelle said, ''The moment I leave, Father (Renoir) will burn the Lumi√®re canvas.''

What can be understood from this conversation is the clear fact that, just as abusive parents violently and emotionally abuse their children, Renoir is the one who ''gave up all possibilities of compromise and pushed Maelle to the point of death on the canvas.'' This is entirely separate from how much he loves Maelle.

It is evident that Renoir has an excessively authoritarian and controlling tendency. He is not very empathetic, and so he could not even comfort his wife when she was suffering from the fear of death. Rather than trying to understand or negotiate with his wife and daughter, he violently snatched his son's mementos from their hands, deceived them, and tried to dominate them. Despite genuinely loving them. His obsessive behavior even suggests some paranoid tendencies.

Of course, considering that he was a member of the 19th-century French upper class, some of this can be understood. Because at that time, the culture treated women and children as byproducts of men, or to put it harshly, as part of the property. For example, it was common knowledge that educating women would negatively affect childbirth and childcare. Women were not given inheritance rights or voting rights.

\-

Therefore, it is understandable why Renoir became such a person. The problem is whether someone like him can solve the Desandre family‚Äôs problems. Because the method Renoir, who said, ''I can no longer live a single day with a corpse,'' chose was a mad act that created yet another corpse.

Look at Aline. When she was expelled from the canvas by the efforts of the 33rd Expedition, did she become fine? No, at that time she looked exactly like an addict deprived of drugs. Watching her like that, Renoir decided, ''Oh, wonderful. Now I have to do the same to my daughter.'' This gave a glimpse into how Renoir's parents had broken his character under the pretext of ''helping'' him when he was a young boy.

So Renoir ultimately passed over the tragedy that did not have to happen‚Äîtragedies that would have disappeared or at least been reduced if he had tried to understand his family with a more tolerant and broad mind‚Äîand said something like, ''Oh well... in the end, my entire family returned to reality. Great. All problems are solved.''

Among those ''all tragedies'' is also the fact that the 33rd Expedition members, whom I, that is, the player loved, cherished, and was attached to, vanished meaninglessly like crushed flies.

\-

In other words, from a cold and objective perspective, it is true that the series of tragedies started by Verso‚Äôs death triggered the rapid collapse of the Desandre family, but the Desandre family was not a very good family even before, and it was already slowly collapsing.

In reality, such families are very difficult to handle. Family members, especially the father, cannot even think they are wrong. People, especially parents, who believe ''love in the family can overcome anything,'' often find counselors crying only after they are mercilessly abandoned by their independent children.

And by that time, it is already difficult to reverse the situation because the children refuse counseling. Such parents always say, ''I gave everything for my children, and that was the right path.'' When they insist that, the reply is always the same: ''There is no right path. If you love, you must learn how to love.''

Therefore, regrettably, apart from the real tragedy of Verso or the canvas issue, the statistical truth is that the Desandre family‚Äôs chance of recovery is not very high.

**+2. Clea**  
Let's leave Aline aside. Anyone who expects a mother who lost her child to be mentally stable is a psychopath. There is no need to explain that she is not stable and has little chance of becoming so.

Even excluding Aline, the problems of the Desandre family are clearly reflected in Clea's personality traits. Clea shows an unusually cynical, cruel, and calculating personality. This is a common personality trait of the eldest daughter raised in an authoritarian large family.

As the first child, she receives many expectations and oppressions from her parents, and since she cannot break through by force, a cynical side develops. Because she has to control her younger siblings, her way of control tends to be authoritarian and cruel, imitating the authoritarian parents. She also has a dual and calculating attitude as a representative of the children toward the parents and as a proxy of the parents toward the younger siblings. The same logic applies to the second child developing servile and obedient traits or the youngest developing free-spirited, innocent, and selfish traits.

Of course, personality traits result from many factors acting simultaneously, including innate ones, beyond simple parental and sibling relationships, so one cannot say that ''the eldest daughter necessarily becomes such a personality.'' This is generally the likelihood that the eldest daughter will develop such traits.

And the core point discussed in this paragraph is that such personality traits of the eldest daughter are likely to develop because of family problems, especially authoritarian parents.

\-

Also, considering that Clea has not married at least until the age of 28, that she struggles desperately to somehow save her broken family, and that despite her free-spirited personality shown in her clothes, she bears all sorts of responsibilities, the likelihood that her remaining life will not be very pleasant is high. The fact that her symbolic ''carrier'' Exon carries a heavy load and that she is already ''dead'' is also significant symbolism.

Therefore, considering not only Renoir and Maelle but also Clea, the future of the Desandre family does not seem promising at all.

**+3. Painted Verso**  
In Verso‚Äôs case, expecting him to be mentally stable is itself unreasonable. He clearly has paranoid tendencies and obsessively desires the destruction of the world and his own suicide. Until Act 2, he appears to be making efforts for Aline, whom he believes to be his ''mother,'' though she is not his real mother, so to some extent, his actions can be motivated.

However, from then on, it is difficult to find consistency or clear motives in his behavior. He says he seeks eternal rest but cooperates with Maelle, and yet shows no active will to preserve the Lumi√®re canvas. It is hard to tell what he really wants because his thoughts and actions are all mixed up.

From his perspective, considering he is an incomplete being who inherited the memories of the original person, identity confusion, and suffering over a hundred years, it is clear that he is not mentally healthy.

In other words, based solely on how he is depicted in the work, he is likely:  
(A) a person very similar to someone with a severe mental illness  
(B) a person with a severe mental illness

And ultimately, his psychopathological traits cause numerous tragedies.

Truly regrettable.

\----

**In conclusion,** both of the tragic endings in this game were entirely avoidable, and there was clearly a possibility of reaching a better outcome. Of course, they did not achieve that, but I hope that those of you reading this‚Äîregardless of the method‚Äîcan reach a better conclusion in any situation.

As you may have sensed while reading the main text, I consider Renoir to be the character who bears the greatest responsibility for this series of tragedies. Verso had too little authority or duty to change the situation, and Maelle was too young. Renoir is the oldest of the three, a father, and the person with the most power and authority. Therefore, he should have approached the situation more cautiously and with a more open attitude than anyone else.

Of course, it cannot be denied that Renoir also suffered deeply from the family tragedy and the Canvas problem. However, it is equally clear that such suffering does not grant him an exemption from blame.

If Renoir were a real person, I would say to him:

*‚ÄúPlease, if you love your family, care about them, listen to their stories, and try to compromise with them. I agree that this is not always possible, but at least when you are in the middle of violently trying to seize and burn the belongings of your dead son, believe me, you absolutely, definitely must try to compromise first!‚Äù*

*----*

That‚Äôs all for now. Thank you for reading this long text. I hope it was enjoyable.

Have a great day!

I loved it. I did shorter slower days for 10 days. I went back in 2018, 2022, 2023 and 2024. I am still fat but not as unfit. I still walk slower, but my endurance is up so I can do longer days than before.

I say, there is never a perfect time for a Camino. And as long as you listen to your body and dont compete with others almost anyone can do it. Don‚Äôt pack to much, do shorter/slower days, give yourself some rest along the way. And enjoy!

I have never felt prepared for my caminos. Or better said, I learned after the second or third that I was prepared no matter what.

Of course there are some basics that need to be in place, but those are also different for different people. And I have managed with both less and more, softer shoes and harder shoes, smaller backpack and larger backpack.

**To round it up**

Free yourself as much as you can and let yourself go with the flow!

And take my and others advice with a huge grain of salt. We are all different and the camino turns out different for everybody/everytime. You might just get hooked (like many of us do)!

**Being fat on the Camino**

I am fat. I have walked both the Frances, Norte and the Portuguese. I don't speak any Spanish or Portuguese other than being able to order coffee. I haven't had any trouble with accommodation.

It is the most amazing adventure.

My first Camino I did the first 200 km of the Frances totally untrained, fat and not a walker back in 2016. Started really slow and got hooked. Now I have walked on the camino 5 times. ¬†

My three biggest tips:

* hikers wool and some ""fat cream"" on feet (eucerin aquaphor)
* dont carry more than you need
* be wary of chafting - a bikeshort is good for walking, a good body glide or anti-chafting stick is a life saver

**Feet**

This is my standard advice - light, non-waterproof shoes that will dry through the night (but my first and second camino I did in waterproof shoes and that worked as well). I put Eucerin aquaphor on my feet to ""waterproof them"", and then wool socks. This made even wet feet good.

As for the blisters, I have done five caminos and only got blisters once (when I tried something new...). Everyone has to find their own routine, but I will mention mine:

* light breathable shoes that are big enough
* wool socks
* eucerin aquaphor or something like that on my feet every morning
* I have hikers wool with me and use on hot spots when I feel them

**App and other sources**

I have used the app Wise Pilgrim - which has a possibility to help you with sending WhatsApp messages to accommodation. If the accomodation has their Whatts app listed you can long press the number and an option will come up where you choose how many people and what date and it will write a message in spanish for you, asking if they have free beds. Loved that! Afterwards, I would just use Google translate to continue the conversation if necessary.

**Websites**:

* All about the Camino ‚Äì stages/route/elevation/accommodation/tips: [https://www.gronze.com/](https://www.gronze.com/) (in Spanish, but Google Translate does a good job ‚Äì also translates names so you have to jump back and forth between languages)
* distances: [https://godesalco.com/plan/frances](https://godesalco.com/plan/frances)
* Public transport - planning: [https://www.rome2rio.com/](https://www.rome2rio.com/). Remember that a lot of spanish public transport companies dont put up their tickets before 4-6 weeks in advance. Do not panic if no rides are available. They have maybe not been published yet.

**Over the Pyrenees**

You can walk as far as you want up the mountain (to the Virgin Cross for example), and then get picked up by the Express Bouriccot shuttle (they have an illustration of the stops at their page).

They will drive you back to SJPDP and then back the same place to continue the next day.

**Alternatives on the Norte**

I would suggest reading through this one and choosing costal alternatives when you can/want.¬†Less asphalt. [https://www.caminodesantiago.me/community/threads/coastal-alternatives-to-the-nortes-asphalt.49578/](https://www.caminodesantiago.me/community/threads/coastal-alternatives-to-the-nortes-asphalt.49578/)

**Arriving in Santiago**

For my three arrivals to Santiago I have had a tradition of stopping just short of Santiago the day before (Lavacolla on the Frances, Monte del Grozo on the Norte, O Milladoiro on th Portuguese). I love walking into the city while the sun is going up and the square being empty.

My experiance is that I find Santiago lovely for a day or two after a Camino. More than that i get antsy. I loved taking the bus to Fisterra and then walking to Muxia split over two days. Muxia was for me a perfect ending after my first arrival to Santiago.

**Pilgrim pass/Credential** ‚Äì ordered in advance or purchased when you start ‚Äì most larger places along the route sell them. You collect stamps in these along the way, from accommodations, bars, churches, etc., to document your journey. To qualify for the Compostela when you reach Santiago, you must collect two stamps every day for the last 100 km.

[https://www.santiagodecompostela.me/products/official-pilgrim-credencial-pilgrim-passport-from-the-pilgrims-office-in-santiago](https://www.santiagodecompostela.me/products/official-pilgrim-credencial-pilgrim-passport-from-the-pilgrims-office-in-santiago)

In Santiago, you can then be issued a Compostella (proof that you have walked the Camino) and a Distance certificate that confirms how far you have walked. You can get these at ‚Äúthe pilgrim office‚Äù. Very close to the cathedral in Santiago. You can register in advance or when you arrive (QR code outside). The guards also help. They have a very good system and there is rarely a long wait.

[https://oficinadelperegrino.com/en/pilgrimage/the-compostela/](https://oficinadelperegrino.com/en/pilgrimage/the-compostela/)

[https://oficinadelperegrino.com/en/pilgrimage/certificate-of-distance/](https://oficinadelperegrino.com/en/pilgrimage/certificate-of-distance/)

NEW RULE 2025 - I am still not totally sure how this works! 

Now you can walk 100 km on any part of an official Camino and then the last stage into Santiago. No longer need to walk the last 100 km.

For bicycles ‚Äì 200 km ‚Äì electric bicycles are out.

**Accommodation**

* Can be booked in advance or on the way. The day before has also worked well. WhatsApp is used a lot. Many of the accommodations are also on Booking.com. An overview of accommodations can be found on gronze.com, or an app such as WisePilgrim, Buen Camino or similar
* Albergue ‚Äì dormitories ‚Äì so many different, private/municipal/donativo
* It is necessary to bring a sleeping bag or liner, early in the year I have used a ‚Äúthermal‚Äù sleeping liner from sea to sumit which is warmer than a regular sleeping bag

**Food**

* Pilgrim‚Äôs menu ‚Äì Menu del dia ‚Äì very often a relatively cheap dinner option ‚Äì starter (soup/pasta/salad) + main course + dessert (ice cream, fruit, yoghurt) ‚Äì often served at a specific time
* Sometimes Menu del dia is served earlier in the day and is a little bit different from the pilgrims menu as it is geared towards the locals. Even better.
* Communal meal ‚Äì meal served in community, good experiences, both the social and the food
* Breakfast ‚Äì hard to find, often toast, some marmalade, low protein

**Clothes**

* Generally two of everything.
* Clothes are washed every day when you arrive at your accommodation. Most places have hand washing facilities and many also have washer/dryer facilities (see gronze.com).
* I love wool t-shirts/tops even for summer. I have found out I prefere to walk in tights so I bring a shorter and a longer version of the same.

**Backpack++**

* Up to 40 liters ‚Äì since you carry everything ‚Äì it is said that about 10% of your body weight is the maximum. I have been carrying around 7kg (without water)
* Poles ‚Äì I have them with me and use them occasionally.
* A couple of clothespins and a couple of safety pins to hang clothes to dry either at the hostel or on the backpack if they are not dry.

**Sleep ‚Äì liner**

I have used this one on all my Caminos - Sea To Summit Reactor Extreme. It is a liner but from thermal fabric. It is also stretchy so it is easier for me as a stomach sleeper to be comfortable.

I also always have a base layer in wool that I sleep in when cold, or use during the day if I get cold.

On all my caminos I have had one night where i could not get warm and it was in April on the Norte.

**Sleep ‚Äì alarm clock**

I put my phone on vibration if I needed to make sure I got up. Mostly, you go to bed early and you wake up more or less gently because of others getting up.

BUT - twice it happened to me that I woke up in an empty albergue around 8.30-9 o'clock. Once in a fairly big common sleepingroom - probably more than 30 beds. I really dont know how I slept through all that. Hahahaha! But I needed it!

**Raingear**

I swear by my Altus Poncho. And I walk inn leggings or shorts and just let my legs get wet.

**Is the Camino a hike**

But, my question is - is the Camino a hike? It's maybe just my definition of a hike that is off?

I love the Camino - been there walking 5 times and going back again. But I wouldn't call it a hike. A long walk, yes. Some sections can resemble a hike, but mostly is a walk, if not a stroll.

Done the Frances, Norte and Portuguese. The Camino keeps me level. But I am worried people would be disappointed if they are expecting a hike.

**Agency or no agency**

I have done 3 caminos over 5 different years/times. No agency used other than having my backpack transffered a couple of days over the years. It always worked out on the spot.

I love the freedom of not having my days planned out. I loved that I could take it as slow or as fast as I felt was suiting. I could also decide to sync up with fellow pilgrims when I wanted.

**Luggage transport**

* France: [https://www.expressbourricot.com/persons-transport/](https://www.expressbourricot.com/persons-transport/) (can also be used for people if you want to take the trip over the Pyrenees in two stages, or be transported up part of the mountain)
* Spain (easiest to book on the way from place to place, there are probably others too): [https://www.jacotrans.es/en/](https://www.jacotrans.es/en/) ¬†, [https://www.elcaminoconcorreos.com/en/rucksack-transfer](https://www.elcaminoconcorreos.com/en/rucksack-transfer)
* Can often be booked at the accommodation itself - the ‚Äúreception‚Äù has envelopes that you fill out, attach to your backpack, put money inside, and send a message to the phone number on the envelope with the pick-up location.
* There is also transport in Portugal - I think Tui is one of the companies

**Safety**

I (female, 44yo) walked the Camino Portuguese alone 2 years ago. Started walking the caminos when I was 36. I have done both the Frances and Norte, always traveling alone, over 1500km. I have felt really safe on all routes. I have had situations where I was nervous - starting really early out of Ponferada (a biggish city), walking in pitch darkness through woods going from O Millodeiro to Santiago etc. But all those were ""regular fears"" not a objectively dangerous or unsafe situation. If you feel the call, I would strongly encourage it! It changed my life!

There will be people around and your confidence will probably rise. But situations can always happen so i suggest having the phone number of cops saved on your phone, and in Spain there is an app - Alert Cops.

**Mosquitos**

I am allergic to mosquitoe bites. I do the whole shabang. Allergy tablets and some cream for the bites. And a product/spray with deet to keep them away from me. You can buy it in different strengths. Some are sceptical due to the chemicals, but I don‚Äôt care. The allergic reaction is worse!",24,1748759462.0,CaminoDeSantiago,0,1.0,False

We have casual banter throughout his meal and at one point he starts asking me some questions about myself.

At this point I‚Äôm positive now. He also asks me what time I‚Äôm working until today and that he may try to come back down before I leave.

I just wanted to share how I destressed and prepared myself the day before to go in with the clearest mind.

The day before, I didn't set my alarm. I let myself sleep in as long as I needed. The day before, I had made a tentative schedule for the day: wake up, eat, light review, cat cafe, hangout for the rest of the day. Instead, I woke up and watched grey's anatomy until 11am and THEN did super light review on high-yield topics until like 2:30pm. And even then all I did was draw metabolism pathways with different colored pens because I love biochem and drawing lol it didn't feel like studying.. picking something that I knew I was familiar with allowed me to feel like I was having fun :)

I really missed my family cat and knew that hanging out with a cat would help me chill out, so I found out that a cat cafe had opened nearby so I just went in there and hungout for an hour. I grabbed dinner on my way home.. I showered and ate before 7 and backseat played Mario party while my roommate played. I made sure to call (almost) everyone in my support system that day or in the days leading up.. my parents, stepmom, grandparents, siblings, girlfriend.

By 8pm I wanted to start getting settled into bed so I just sat in my room in silence doing more super light review until 9pm. Brushed my teeth, called my parents, took my melatonin, called my girlfriend again, and was in bed asleep by 9:45pm latest.

Woke up around 5:30am the next day and prayed with my family -- if you are religious then I recommend it, and if not, meditation is a perfect substitute!! I brushed my teeth and ate around 6am, had a super small cup of coffee to empty my bowels because for too many practice MCATs I had to shit during C/P since I drank coffee too late. I did anki until 6:45am to just pass time and make myself feel better, took my adderall (I have adhd and a prescription lol don't take unprescribed meds), and then brushed my teeth before I left because I hate coffee aftertaste.

I was super lucky to live 2 minutes away from my testing center lol so my roommate and I left around 7:30am, she dropped me off because I was terrified that I wouldn't go if I had to drive myself.

Before I got out of the car, I prayed again, and then went ""ALRIGHT IT'S GAME DAY"" and jumped around and did jabs into the air like I used to do during les mills bodycombat classes.. got my blood flowing..

Between sections, I jumped around and did jumping jacks.. shook out my nerves and mentally reassured myself. Always made sure to be back early before my next section started, drank water and peed between every section even if I didn't have to, ate lunch even though it felt like I was trying to swallow sand. During my extra time after I ate (because I ate five chicken nuggets and a forkful of pasta before deciding I couldn't eat more), I paced in the hall outside of the center for ten minutes just sipping water and reassuring myself. 

This shit was tough, but staying focused and doing things to be physically and mentally well the week leading up to + throughout the day of the exam I think attributed to my calm demeanor during the exam. Regardless of how I did, which I'll find out next month, I went into the exam with a clear mind and didn't panic. Best of luck to everyone testing‚ù§Ô∏è",5,1748758801.0,Mcat,0,0.99,False

Shamrock - Gemini


Gunko - Saggitarius


Sommers - Cancer/Scorpio


Killingham - Pisces or aquarius


 Now I don't go in for astrology at all, but if there's a crazy idea that hasn't been explored, I'm going for it, plus it fits the stellar theme of the celestial dragons.


Ok.  Hear me out.


The man with the burn scar, someone who works for the government, rides a black ship and can summon whirlpools.


The steamships in japan were known as black ships as they had never known steamships before.


Historically, the steamship replaced the xebec, a common sailing ship up until the 18th centurary.


Pisces, a zodiac sign with associations to whirlpools, and fish theme. Or aquarius, still water themed, but an association to freedom.


The man with the burn scar is a gods knight, or former gods knight, who was the one to defeat xebec, has some form of aquatic or fish based power, and rides a steamship.  They have the burn scar from xebec, as xebecs flag is the Jolly roger skull on fire.   And/or burn scar from torching his tattoo like like sun pirates


Xebec could very well be the man marked by flames, if marked is more akin to ""chosen."" 


I guess also, if xebec did have fire powers that you could use the heat to create whirlpools with temperature differences in water, but that's stretching it haha.  He's definitely important to the series in some way.


  Additionally, they may have left the world government and stolen the poneglyph to protect the it, its the closest to the world government, and did this after being affected by xebecs words.
