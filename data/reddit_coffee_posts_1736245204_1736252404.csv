1hvq5nm,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_anhonouredone/comments/1hvq5nm/the_day_the_coffee_machine_went_rogue/,The Day the Coffee Machine Went Rogue,"Look, I love my job at MacGuffin's Meme Shop. It's never boring, there's always something strange happening, and it's basically like working in a constant fever dream of internet culture. But some days? Some days really test your patience. Take last Tuesday, for example. What started off as a regular day spiraled into complete chaos, all thanks to one machine that had simply had enough.

So, like every morning, I roll into work, say my ""good mornings"" to the team (which, at this point, feels more like a ritual than anything), and then I make my beeline for the coffee machine. A vital part of any meme warrior‚Äôs day, right? You can‚Äôt meme on an empty stomach... or without caffeine.

I put my cup under the nozzle, press the button for my regular black coffee, and then‚Äînothing. The machine gurgled like it was processing an existential crisis, and then suddenly... it exploded. I mean, *exploded*. Hot coffee shot everywhere: all over the counter, the floor, and tragically, my favorite hoodie. If you‚Äôve never had the joy of cleaning hot coffee off a laminate floor, let me tell you, it‚Äôs a real life test of patience.

So, as I'm standing there, coffee dripping off my face, I hear footsteps approaching. It‚Äôs Greg. The man, the myth, the legend. Greg is our manager. Imagine a cross between a caffeine addict and an internet dad who‚Äôs only recently discovered TikTok. He looks at the coffee machine, then at me, then back at the machine, and says, ""Looks like the coffee machine finally ascended to meme status."" Thanks, Greg. Real encouraging.

And here's where the story takes a *weird* turn. Someone from the store next door overheard the commotion, whipped out their phone, and started recording. Before I knew it, our coffee machine was trending on TikTok. Yes, *the coffee machine*. The video went viral within hours‚Äîpeople in the comments were making memes about the machine ""fighting back"" and calling it ""the true face of chaos.""

Now, to make things even more surreal, the coffee machine became a meme icon of its own. We started getting requests from customers asking if we sold ""Rogue Coffee Machine"" merchandise. At first, we laughed it off. But as the requests piled up, we realized there was some untapped potential here. Who knew that a malfunctioning coffee machine could become the shop's unofficial mascot?

In the end, we printed a batch of ‚ÄúRogue Coffee Machine‚Äù mugs and shirts. They sold like hotcakes, and we made enough to buy a new, less rebellious coffee machine. But hey, I‚Äôll always remember the day the coffee machine rebelled. It‚Äôs a strange kind of legacy, but I‚Äôll take it.",1,1736252242.0,u_anhonouredone,0,1.0,False

1hvq44z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hvq44z,Correct size Premier Low Top ordered and delivered but obviously small. Not confident in my exchange experience. ,"I received a pair of Coffee Premier Low Tops for my birthday. I‚Äôm a size 10 and that‚Äôs what was ordered for me. I‚Äôve been wanting a pair for a long time so I was very happy to get them. 

However, when I finally went to put them on I couldn‚Äôt even get half of my foot in. It felt ridiculously small. So I put one next to another of my shoes that is also a 10 and it‚Äôs obvious that the Thursday sneaker is smaller. 

I contacted customer service who had me send a bunch of pictures and agreed to do an exchange as a ‚Äúone time courtesy‚Äù.

 They‚Äôre sending me an 11 now but my concern is two fold. 

First, the website says to order your regular shoe size so that‚Äôs what we did. But, when the ones I got, even though they‚Äôre labeled as a 10 obviously aren‚Äôt. So how is replacing them a one time courtesy? The order was made following the directions on Thursday‚Äôs site and the product doesn‚Äôt fit correctly. Replacing them should be the basics of customer service, not a courtesy. 

Second, I‚Äôm afraid when the 11s arrive that they‚Äôll be too big and I‚Äôll have to contact customer service again. But I don‚Äôt exactly have confidence that they‚Äôll be willing to extend that courtesy again.

When planning gifts for Japanese friends, it can be challenging to find authentic Philippine-made souvenirs that go beyond attractive packaging. A traveler from Baguio has already picked up some local favorites like ube jam, alfajor, and peanut butter‚Äîclassic treats that showcase the flavors of the region. However, they‚Äôre exploring additional options, including alcohol and other unique products, that can be purchased online or in NCR.

For alcohol, Philippine craft spirits make an excellent choice. Options like **Lambanog** (coconut wine), **Don Papa Rum**, or **Barik Supremo** offer a distinctly Filipino taste while presenting well as gifts due to their premium packaging. These are readily available in major supermarkets or specialty liquor stores in Metro Manila.

Beyond alcohol, locally crafted items such as **handwoven textiles** or small items made from them (like coin purses or scarves) highlight Philippine artistry. The traveler can explore brands like **Anthill Fabric Gallery** or Kultura, which offer products that showcase Filipino craftsmanship and culture.

For snacks and food, other regional delicacies such as **dried mangoes**, **polvoron**, or specialty **chocolate** like Malagos from Davao or Theo & Philo are always appreciated. These are not only delicious but also packaged attractively for gifting. For a more playful twist, unique snacks like **Chicharon** or **adobo peanuts** can add a Filipino flair to their selection.

If ordering online, platforms like Lazada, Shopee, or specialty websites can provide a wide range of options, from gourmet **coffee blends** like Kalinga or Benguet coffee to sustainable home goods crafted by Filipino artisans.

With these suggestions, the traveler can bring a thoughtful mix of flavors and culture to Japan, showcasing the best of the Philippines in every pasalubong.",1,1736251893.0,philtravel,0,1.0,False

","Hey Reddit fam,

I can't believe this moment is finally here ‚Äì my SaaS product just got its FIRST subscription for $100, and I‚Äôm over the moon! üåï

**A Little Backstory**

I started this journey with just an idea. A small, scrappy prototype built during late nights, fueled by endless cups of coffee (and a few mental breakdowns üòÖ). Honestly, I doubted myself a million times. Who would care about my product? Who would even pay for it?

But last night, as I was about to go to bed, I got¬†**the notification.**¬†You know the one ‚Äì ""You've received a payment of $100."" It took me a second to process, and then it hit me like a freight train.

**What My Product Does**

The product is a¬†**dashboard tool**¬†that allows you to connect and view data from multiple sources like¬†**Google Analytics**¬†and¬†**Search Console**¬†all in one place. No more switching between tabs or getting lost in data overload ‚Äì everything is neatly organized, making it easy to track performance and make data-driven decisions without the hassle.

It‚Äôs aimed at small businesses, marketers, and anyone who wants a simpler way to monitor their online performance. And clearly, there‚Äôs at least one person out there who saw enough value to subscribe!

**Why This Means So Much to Me**

I‚Äôm not some big startup founder with investors throwing money at me. I don‚Äôt have a fancy office or a huge team. It‚Äôs just me, grinding every day, figuring things out as I go. This $100 is so much more than just money ‚Äì it‚Äôs validation. It‚Äôs proof that someone, somewhere, found enough value in what I‚Äôve built to actually pay for it.

**What‚Äôs Next?**

For me, this is just the beginning. Now that I know people are willing to pay, it‚Äôs time to double down. More features, more marketing, and maybe even more subscriptions? Let‚Äôs see how far this can go.

Thanks for reading, and if you‚Äôve been grinding on your own project, let‚Äôs hear about it in the comments. Let‚Äôs inspire each other. üöÄ

1hvpybj,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1hvpybj/im_a_vietnamese_american_person_born_in_the_us/,I'm a Vietnamese American person (born in the US) who recently traveled to Vi·ªát Nam. I miss Vi·ªát Nam so much. Requesting advice for learning Southern Vietnamese.,"For context, I started writing this at 4:45 AM for me locally. It is now 6 AM... I'm still jetlagged, and I'm returning to work in the morning after taking about 4 weeks off (all unpaid, as I'm currently an intern) üòÖ

TLDR: It's a massive ADHD ramble, but my family and I visited Southern Vi·ªát Nam. I'm supposed to go to work in a few hours, but got a panic attack because I missed Vietnam and now want to learn more Vietnamese because my Vietnamese sucks (as in not fluent enough). I miss the coffee (Highlands Coffee and Trung Nguy√™n [if anyone in corporate sees this post, either of you two, PLEASE MAKE A US LOCATION, PREFERABLY AT LITTLE SAIGON AT HOUSTON]. I ESPECIALLY MISS YOU TWO), the food, the culture, Saigon Centre, etc. I'm still young and I know that I have more time to see and visit Vietnam more once I graduate from University and make more money. I may go back to Vi·ªát Nam sooner than later. Depends on finances.

Requested advice on how to be more fluent in Southern Vietnamese, and mentioned that I'm currently using Duolingo to refresh my vocabulary, despite the dialect difference with Northern Vietnamese (just reading the words in Southern Vietnamese).

My family and I recently went on to a trip to Vi·ªát Nam, the motherland in my eyes. I cannot stop thinking about wanting to travel back there again already... It's so bad to the point where I essentially had a very small and mild panic attack and led me to make this discussion post to ease myself before returning to work.

For context for the trip, we started at S√†i G√≤n (HCMC), and then went on a scenic 10-hour-bus trip to C√† Mau, then S√≥c TrƒÉng, then Tr√† Vinh, and then back to S√†i G√≤n befoee we had a small tour around Thailand (Pattaya and Bangkok) before going back to Vi·ªát Nam to go to B√† R·ªãa and then finally going back to S√†i G√≤n before leaving to go back to the US. So overall, I traveled a lot around South Vi·ªát Nam. Reason why we went from C√† Mau and went slowly north back to S√†i G√≤n was because we were traveling to see bridges that we helped (we didn't build the bridges, but my dad helped spread awareness of some of the more dangerous bridges and helped with some donation efforts to build safer bridges, especially in the more rural side of Vietnam so that everyone (especially school children) can travel much more safely.

It also didn't help that it was a trip full of many firsts. For instance, it's my first international trip to Asia, my first time ever in Vi·ªát Nam, first time ever on a motorcycle (there are much fewer motorcycles in the US, and I feel that it is more dangerous to be on a motorcycle in the US versus in Vi·ªát Nam), first time on a ferry (ph√† between S√≥c TrƒÉng and Tr√† Vinh), first time meeting extended family, etc. Let's just say that experiencing all of this was a very good high for me, compared to living a student/corporate America life. I especially loved how cozy B√† R·ªãa was. It's to the point where I'd considering living down there to retire, depending on MANY circumstances. 

But regardless, I love and miss Vietnam. Although I would never want to drive down at S√†i G√≤n (the only way I can describe S√†i G√≤n traffic is it's like an organized kamikaze [it really is like you go or you'll never make it to your destination]), I still ironically miss that S√†i G√≤n traffic. I also miss the relatively affordable food and drinks were, especially the B·∫°c X·ªâu from Highlands Coffee and the C√† Ph√™ Mu·ªëi from Trung Nguy√™n. For context, (assuming $1 USD to 25,000 VND conversation) a large coffee in Star Bucks back the states (admitted also too large here) is $6+ (150K+ VND). A large coffee in Vi·ªát Nam (albeit with a much more manageable cup size) is at most 61K VND (~$2.44 for Trung Nguy√™n's C√† Ph√™ Mu·ªëi). Like, I missed coffee that was really good, balanced, and affordable, especially in terms of US coffee and its pricing. Also, those were the two drinks I was comfortable ordering in Vietnamese, as my Vietnamese cannot even rival a first grader. If there are other drinks I should get from those places, let me know. Also, my family and I skipped out on Ph√∫c Long for no reason other than we saw Highlands and Trung Nguy√™n first. I also saw that according to Google Gemini that Highlands may make a US-based location... I don't know how true that is... But if it is true, PLEASE MAKE ONE IN LITTLE SAIGON, HOUSTON, TX!!!

Also miss having X·∫° X·ªâ soda nearly every day. Another thing I'd like to say is that I'm really glad that the Vietnamese food at Vi·ªát Nam does match up with the Vietnamese food at my area. Last major thing that I miss (I'm missing a lot here) are ironically the malls (all of the Vincom Plazas and the Go! Mart). Those turned out to be one of my main highlights, as the malls in the US (Texas at least) have one or two floors. I still miss all of the Vincom Plazas there, especially Saigon Centre.

Regarding my mini panic attack, I think it stemmed from my relative lack of Vietnamese, I now heavily regret not relearning Vietnamese when I was younger, as I would've been in much better standing today (I started talking in Vietnamese to my parents when I was a toddler before they had to rush teaching me English, since US-based schools obviously teach in English. It also was the main reason why I pretty much lost all of my Vietnamese at first). With my new-found motivation, I started pickup up the pace on Duolingo to relearn all of the missing vocabulary that I missed and now need to find a way to be more fluent in Vietnamese (the Vietnamese that I currently have is enough to order food and drinks and MAYBE some light small talk [especially with my grandmother], and that's about it). Any tips, tricks, and advice is welcomed regarding how to be more fluent in Vietnamese. I think I saw a post earlier about Learn Vietnamese with Annie or something like that. And for reference, I want to focus on speaking Ti·∫øng Vi·ªát Nam Mi·ªÅn Nam (southern Vietnamese or Saigonese), as that's the dialect that we use locally in my area and my family (for more obviously reasons). Will need to learn Northern Vietnamese (Ti·∫øng Vi·ªát Nam Mi·ªÅn B·∫Øc), since it's the official dialect (still doesn't change the fact that I liked and am more biased to Southern Vietnamese/Saigonese.) 

I'm now at the point where my nerves have been eased and that I can finally try to sleep again for about an hour before returning to work. If you have read up to this point, thank you so much for listening to my ADHD ramble. Sorry if there are any typos or other grammar issues, as I'm typing this on my phone and Reddit mobile is acting so weird. Not to mention, it is now 5:45 local time for me now that I'm at this part of the post. Anyway, I know that I'm still young and that I have more time to experience Vi·ªát Nam later on. I still can't help but miss it and want it now... I'm now at the point where I'm reconsidering joining with a friend to travel all of Vietnam once we graduate from University (despite not having the necessary funds now... I'm also considering taking out a loan if I have to). That or I may tag along with my extended family if they go to Vi·ªát Nam again. I seriously went from I need a newer car (2009 Toyota Venza with messed up piston rings with oil-burning issues) to the newer car can wait. Vi·ªát Nam now ü§£

Also, notes to myself to when (not if, but when) I return to Vi·ªát Nam:

1. Bring toilet paper 
2. Bring hand sanitizer 
3. Bring Albuterol (I have asthma and also saw how bad the air quality was/is in H√† N·ªôi)

While shifting the seats, my mom accidentally dropped her hot coffee on the floor of one seats, and also on her entire one leg. Her whole jeans got soiled, and since we had just bought the coffee, ofc she got burnt as well! 

But instead of helping my mom out or even asking if she was okay, the girls throughout the movie were commenting like how we dont have any etiquettes, like we spoiled their seats and were so mannerless! 

Like, we apologised for the whole mistake, which was a very generic and honest mistake! The coffee dropping as well, was an honest mistake which harmed none other than my mother, and we still received these comments. Didnt say anything to them at that time, cause my mother didnt want to spoil the movie.

However, this incident raises a very serious question in my mind‚Ä¶.where are we,as a generation heading to, in terms of emotions and empathy? Are emotions like kindness, and caring about others no longer in existence? Are we this mean, that we only care about soiled seats?

I'm a writer from Barcelona. I'm currently in the middle of writing a short story happening in Petrovaradin. I was there for a couple of weeks and thought it would be a nice homage since I fell in love with the city. I don't exactly where, but I remember reading about traditional coffee readings in Serbia and other Balkan countries, and I guess I got fixated with the idea. Within the story, the character recieves a coffee reading and, having never taken part in one, I'd love to know if it rings true. Now, I need help knowing if the process of what I've found feels right, not the writing part (because I'm translating it from Catalan and it's supposed to feel both mechanic and uninteresting). Here it goes:

First, she drank the coffee from just one side. Then, she put the plate on top of the cup. She made a wish. She turned the cup upside down. She rotated the cup counterclockwise multiple times. Finally, she placed a coin to scare away evil spirits and omens.

Is there anything I haven't collected? I don't even know if it's *that* traditional, but from what I've gathered seems pretty ingrained in popular culture. Thanks!",1,1736251448.0,AskBalkans,0,1.0,False

I can't believe this moment is finally here ‚Äì my SaaS product just got its FIRST subscription for $100, and I‚Äôm over the moon! üåï

**A Little Backstory**

I started this journey with just an idea. A small, scrappy prototype built during late nights, fueled by endless cups of coffee (and a few mental breakdowns üòÖ). Honestly, I doubted myself a million times. Who would care about my product? Who would even pay for it?

But last night, as I was about to go to bed, I got **the notification.** You know the one ‚Äì ""You've received a payment of $100."" It took me a second to process, and then it hit me like a freight train.

**What My Product Does**

The product is a **dashboard tool** that allows you to connect and view data from multiple sources like **Google Analytics** and **Search Console** all in one place. No more switching between tabs or getting lost in data overload ‚Äì everything is neatly organized, making it easy to track performance and make data-driven decisions without the hassle.

It‚Äôs aimed at small businesses, marketers, and anyone who wants a simpler way to monitor their online performance. And clearly, there‚Äôs at least one person out there who saw enough value to subscribe!

**Why This Means So Much to Me**

I‚Äôm not some big startup founder with investors throwing money at me. I don‚Äôt have a fancy office or a huge team. It‚Äôs just me, grinding every day, figuring things out as I go. This $100 is so much more than just money ‚Äì it‚Äôs validation. It‚Äôs proof that someone, somewhere, found enough value in what I‚Äôve built to actually pay for it.

**What‚Äôs Next?**

For me, this is just the beginning. Now that I know people are willing to pay, it‚Äôs time to double down. More features, more marketing, and maybe even more subscriptions? Let‚Äôs see how far this can go.

Thanks for reading, and if you‚Äôve been grinding on your own project, let‚Äôs hear about it in the comments. Let‚Äôs inspire each other. üöÄ

Did my running but skipped the shower. I love running when it is cold. I just love it! Caught the early Ferry. I will have time to order a breakfast sandwich and coffee at the food truck

On Sunday my therapist Susan sent me a link to a workshop she once gave to artists and writers who were experiencing creative blocks. It was fascinating!

Here's a key point that stuck with me. Never suffer in silence or shame. Instead, tell everyone, ask for ideas! ‚ÄúYou are just not you! You are you plus all of your connections. You're the leader of Team You and intelligence is your collective intelligence. Mine it!‚Äù

So I called up my Jammy sisters and we decided to collectively ask our teachers for ideas. Strange? Not really in a school designed for artists.

The best idea came out from our French teacher (we all have her but in different sections). ‚ÄúFor two years I've been teaching you the songs of the great French chanteurs and chanteuses! So far I have only heard you sing that one song by Jacques Dutronc. What about all of the others we have listened to?‚Äù

The idea clicked with us. Original, surprising, and doable program.

That gave me the courage to call up Anita. I was thoroughly coached by the girls. Express gratitude for all the opportunities they gave us. Accept her offer very graciously. But push back a little bit. I told her that if we work hard to put together a playlist, could we have two back-to-back days? It just doesn't make sense for us to come up with new shows if we can only use them on a single day. I told her about our French music program. 

We had found out that quite a few clients were disappointed we weren't there. She was very receptive about our proposal because they have a significant population of West Africans in the community. So she agreed pending the owners approval! She tentatively gave us the last Saturday and the last Sunday of each month through June. That's perfect for us because I will be able to go to KRG on the first weekend, FD on the 2nd, and my discussion meeting on the 3rd. We will have a full month to prepare a quality program and we will have more time for all the college prep stuff. ‚ÄúMarchons, marchons, qu'un sang impur abreuve nos sillons!‚Äù

June is especially excited with her to-die-for silky and sulky voice. She wants to be our point person for this gig. Go, June, go!

And what about if I rent an accordion and learn a thing or to for our next gig? I've never seen it, but maybe there is one locked up in the band room that I can fool around with.",1,1736251375.0,LoHeidiLita,0,1.0,False

Me(28) and my husband both are phD students.
I started my third year last october and according to me phD programm, I need to submit my phD paper by around this December so that it gets accepted by 2026 May and get the degree by October. 
I still don't have any publish quality data neither do I have any bare minimum help/guidance from my professor. I am completely on my own. But thankfully, last year, I managed to get a project and seems like I can get some data by this year. 
On top of that 1.5 years ago I got diagnosed with ADHD that was really devastating for me to accept. I started taking medication but only medication didn't seem to help much. 
As a side effect of ADHD, I also developed an anxiety disorder thinking of constant negativity related to my phD, got severe panick attacks 3 times in these whole time. Later, counselling sessions really helped me to find out behavior modifications that seem to be singnificaly helpful for me. Gratefully, from last few months, I stated doing really well mentally as I learned to accept myself and working towards a happy life.
Me and my husband planned to have baby next year after I submit my thesis and also to give myself some time to recover from my bad habits (working at night/ not sleeping or eating for 30 hrs/only having coffee etc). 
But last week i find out I am 4 weeks pregnant for the first time. I am absolutely not ready for it at this stage of my life where I am still gathering myself. Besides, we live abroad where we are completely on our own and will have no help. The first thought was, terminating the pregnancy but I am feeling immense guilt about it causing me a second thought of continuing it. I am not ready but also feeling like I am being selfish. I can't stop my crying don't know why.

In that same vein, if you do have issues with the blank page on digital, how do you usually combat it? The more I play with ideas I find that using a textured background like old coffee stained colored paper, or even just putting lines like a composition notebook helps me get through the blank page stage, but recently I've been thinking of just changing the color of my background to a shade of gray or something that will make colors look more properly placed than if the character is standing in a blank white room.

That look on her face‚Äîa mix of pain and gratitude‚Äîstuck with me all day. Hours later, while walking back from lunch, I saw her again! She was boarding a bus, but the necklace wasn‚Äôt around her neck... It was lying on the pavement, unnoticed.  

I froze. Should I scream? Run after her? But instead, I just stood there‚Äîparalyzed. *""She will come back for it,""* I kept telling myself. But what if she didn‚Äôt? Finally, I picked it up, opening the locket in a desperate search for a clue. Inside was a small photo of a boy, around five years old. No name. No contact info. Just his bright, innocent smile staring back at me.  

For days, I walked back and forth, searching for her. I scoured the coffee shop, the bus stop‚Äîanywhere she might be! The guilt was unbearable... What if that necklace was her anchor to someone she‚Äôd lost?  

Then, yesterday, I saw her! She was sitting on a park bench, staring at her hands. My heart raced as I walked up to her and handed her the necklace. She looked at it, then at me, and tears instantly filled her eyes.  

*""I thought it was gone forever,""* she whispered, her voice trembling as she clutched it tightly. She sobbed as she explained‚Äîit belonged to her son, who had passed away a year ago.

Understanding Teeth Whitening and Dietary Considerations

Teeth whitening temporarily makes your teeth more porous and sensitive, creating a critical period where your diet can significantly impact the treatment's effectiveness. Your teeth become more susceptible to staining and potential sensitivity immediately after the whitening procedure. During this crucial time, the foods and beverages you consume can either help maintain or potentially compromise your results.

H2: Can You Eat Eggs After Teeth Whitening?

Good news for egg lovers! Eggs are generally considered a safe food to consume after teeth whitening. Unlike many other foods that can potentially stain or irritate your newly whitened teeth, eggs are:

‚Ä¢ Neutral in color
‚Ä¢ Low in acidity
‚Ä¢ Soft and easy to eat
‚Ä¢ Nutritionally beneficial

click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

H3: Why Eggs Are a Safe Choice

Eggs offer several advantages for those who have just undergone teeth whitening:

1. White and Light-Colored Food
The light color of eggs means they won't stain your newly whitened teeth, which is crucial during the first 48 hours after treatment.

2. Gentle on Sensitive Teeth
Soft-cooked eggs are easy to eat and won't cause additional sensitivity or discomfort.

3. Nutritional Benefits
Eggs provide protein, vitamins, and minerals that support overall health without compromising your teeth whitening results.

H2: Foods to Avoid After Teeth Whitening

While eggs are safe, other foods can potentially damage your whitening results:

‚Ä¢ Dark-colored beverages (coffee, red wine)
‚Ä¢ Acidic foods
‚Ä¢ Deeply pigmented fruits
‚Ä¢ Tomato-based sauces
‚Ä¢ Colored condiments

click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

H3: Recommended Preparation Methods

When eating eggs after teeth whitening, consider these preparation methods:

1. Scrambled eggs
2. Soft-boiled eggs
3. Poached eggs
4. Egg whites

Avoid heavily seasoned or strongly colored preparations that might compromise your teeth's appearance.

H2: Timing Matters: When to Eat After Teeth Whitening

Most dental professionals recommend following a **white diet** for the first 48 hours after teeth whitening. This means:

‚Ä¢ Choosing colorless foods
‚Ä¢ Avoiding strongly colored ingredients
‚Ä¢ Prioritizing foods that won't stain

click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

H3: Potential Risks of Improper Diet

Consuming the wrong foods can:
‚Ä¢ Reduce whitening effectiveness
‚Ä¢ Cause temporary tooth sensitivity
‚Ä¢ Create new stains
‚Ä¢ Compromise your dental investment

H2: Expert Tips for Maintaining Your Whitened Smile

To maximize your teeth whitening results:
‚Ä¢ Drink plenty of water
‚Ä¢ Use a straw for colored beverages
‚Ä¢ Maintain good oral hygiene
‚Ä¢ Follow your dentist's specific recommendations

Conclusion

Eggs are an excellent, safe food choice after teeth whitening. By understanding dietary considerations and making informed choices, you can protect and maintain your bright, beautiful smile. Remember that individual experiences may vary, so always consult your dental professional for personalized advice tailored to your specific teeth whitening treatment and oral health needs. Your newly whitened smile is an investment worth protecting, and with the right care and dietary choices, you can enjoy long-lasting, stunning results.",1,1736250324.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False

Time to pay and it's a 12 oz cup for $5.75. Thought I would be getting a the Cortado at the venti blonde roast price, with the coffee machine being down and all, or at least a venti Cortado.

I'm(f19) planning to surprise my ex bf(m20) we've been for 1 year but a month before my flight we broke up. So I'm planning to ask him out for coffee and usap usap lang but nahihiya ako baka di ako siputin. siya kase yung nakipag break and yung break up namin healthy break up naman, but this week my ex nalaman niyang pupunta ako sa lugar nila. so nag reach out siya sakin nagulat ako akala ko kase ayaw niya na ko makita. And he offers me to stay at their house pero sabi ko na i could book a hotel nalang and sasamhan niya daw ako gumala sa lugar nila(mabait naman po siya guys haha). what could you suggest or advice for me?

ps. non refundable po kase yung ticket ko kaya po tumuloy ako 

Attempts: Nag refuse po ako na sa house nila kahit na kilala ako ng parents niya, pero di pa alam ng parents niya na nag break na kami.",2,1736250050.0,adviceph,5,1.0,False

Still shit obviously, obviously want to smoke etc etc, but there's good moments too. I just hope to get well enough to go out and distract myself, I have such good distractions lined up. But I feel so weak and shaky all the time, like I had a fever. 

I have a quitting buddy I chat with every day and ir helps so much. I drink a mix of mineral water and cranberry juice and am hooked (of course). Contemplating on going back to coffee (had to quit coffee because adhd meds but if I don't smoke perhaps my heart could take coffee??)

Sorry about the ramble. It's not my first quit but it feels different, I'm in so much better place mentally and just want to shed this tobacco stuff I have no need for it anymore.",3,1736250019.0,stopsmoking,2,1.0,False

Deciding between returning her sentimental items and moving on. ,"So, I (29M) met this girl (25F) about 3 ¬Ω months ago ‚Äì we hit it off and hooked up. I didn‚Äôt think much of it at the time, but I felt a deep connection with her, and she asked me to exchange phone numbers. What was weird is that she trauma-dumped on me during the night we hooked up, telling me how her mom passed away when she was a kid.

The first few times we hung out, she seemed really into me, but she was flaky and always late. She would constantly lie about small things that I didn‚Äôt even care about. I called her out on it, and she stopped ‚Äì except for the lying part. She told me how she didn‚Äôt want anything serious, how she hadn‚Äôt been in a relationship for six years, and how she only hooks up, etc. So, we agreed on a FWB-type scenario where I emphasized the friendship part. However, after one time, she started distancing herself ‚Äì never initiating contact but always agreeing to hang out.

¬†

We started hanging out regularly‚Äîat least once a week‚Äîfor several hours (sometimes 7-8 hours), but it was usually at a bar. Over time, I felt like we were growing closer, and there was a clear sense of romantic tension. She began opening up more; however, by the end of our meetups, she would always reiterate that she didn‚Äôt want anything serious. At times, she could be blunt or critical, making comments about me being boring, even though she consistently chose to spend so much time with me. She also insisted on tagging along with my friends when I had other plans, which made things awkward.

Fast forward a bit, and our hangouts turned into 2-3 times a week ‚Äì after which she would always distance herself even more. She was doing this dance where she would literally invite me to her place, start getting close to me, like putting her legs over me or sitting extremely close to me, and then pull away panicking like she didn‚Äôt know what to do. She would make comments like, ‚ÄúWe should have a scientific experiment where you blindfold me and we get physical,‚Äù but when I got close, she would pull away. This lasted for some time. I suggested that we should start dating ‚Äì she wouldn‚Äôt say no but rather ¬†invite me to her place. At that time, she started lending me some books.

She got sick, so we hadn‚Äôt seen each other for a few weeks ‚Äì but when we met in person, we continued where we left off. We decided to go out drinking one night with my friends. I offered to pick her up, and she accepted but made a big deal out of it because ‚Äúwe are arriving together.‚Äù She invited us to her place after that, where she was extremely affectionate, sitting in my lap in front of my friends, touching my legs, etc. She suggested we send them home and that I stay over ‚Äì so we called them a cab, but immediately after they left, she started pulling back again, saying she didn‚Äôt feel like having sex. I told her that I didn‚Äôt understand what was going on. We hung out for half an hour more, and I told her I was going to bed. We cuddled and held hands for hours in bed ‚Äì just chatting, and then she hit me with, ‚ÄúThis is wrong, but hand-holding made me horny. Let‚Äôs get physical, but if we do, we aren‚Äôt allowed to see each other ever again.‚Äù I told her no, and she said, ‚ÄúNo kissing then,‚Äù which I also refused ‚Äì and then we had the most passionate kiss ever. I left in the morning, and she lent me another book (I had asked about it a long time ago but didn‚Äôt even remember anymore ‚Äì she just gave it to me). It was a personal book, which was her mom‚Äôs gift to a friend who later gave it to her. However, there was a lot of stuff underlined in the book, so I asked her who had underlined it ‚Äì after which she pulled away again.

¬†

After that, she was extremely distant. She avoided meeting up for three weeks. We finally met up with a friend of mine, and she told me she had been avoiding me because she got into a relationship two weeks ago and it wouldn‚Äôt be fair if she were still hanging out with me (but she had no problem sleeping with a married guy before that, and she would even defend him, saying how considerate he was because he didn‚Äôt want to divorce because of the kids). I told her I would still like to continue hanging out and that I would respect her choices because, honestly, I really do care about her and wouldn‚Äôt want to cut her out of my life. She mentioned multiple times that we wouldn‚Äôt hang out one-on-one ever again. After the bar closed, I told her to come to my place so I could give her stuff back (which she had mentioned multiple times how sentimental it was). I was already in the car, and she called me, telling me to come to another bar. She then proceeded to attack me ‚Äì saying she would never date me, that she was only hanging out with me because she didn‚Äôt have anyone else to hang out with, that she only accepted my invitations to hang out because she didn‚Äôt want to be rude, and tried gaslighting me that stuff that happened never happened. In all of that, she said something along the lines of, ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt even experienced anything in your life‚Äù ‚Äì which I took to mean I hadn‚Äôt traveled a lot or similar. I sarcastically answered, ‚ÄúNo, you did,‚Äù and then she started crying and told me again how young her mom was when she died. I tried explaining that I didn‚Äôt understand her comment in that context. I asked her if she wanted to talk about what happened as well. I have some stuff that I‚Äôve been through (not as heavy, obviously), so I opened up as well, and at that point, we were both crying. She told me she was sorry she ever met me, that she just lost all respect for me, and then blocked me on socials in front of me. She told me she was going to the bathroom, then messaged me a few minutes later saying she had to leave because she was not in the mood to talk anymore and that we would see each other next time. She didn‚Äôt even send me a happy new year text (she didn‚Äôt block my phone number).

Now ‚Äì I know this is quite a story; however, I really do care about her and would like to stay in her life as a friend. I have no idea why. I have no idea how to proceed with this. At the very least, I would like to return the stuff she lent me, as she mentioned multiple times how important it is to her. I was thinking of sending her a message asking if she wants to pick her stuff up, if I should mail it to her, or if I should bring it next time when we see each other (if ever). This is hard for me because I feel like I lost the last bit of self-respect I had, especially after she told me she was only hanging out with me because she didn‚Äôt have anyone else to hang out with (which seems contradictory ‚Äì multiple times she left coffee with her friends to hang out with me ‚Äì unless she was lying). But I don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôm hurting someone by not returning their sentimental belongings.

TL;DR: I (29M) met a girl (25F) 3.5 months ago and developed a complicated FWB relationship. She often sent mixed signals‚Äîbeing affectionate, spending hours with me, and lending me sentimental items‚Äîonly to pull away, act rude, and remind me she didn‚Äôt want anything serious. Recently, she revealed she started dating someone else, avoided me for weeks, and told me she only hung out with me out of politeness. During an argument, she claimed I hadn‚Äôt ‚Äúbeen through anything in life.‚Äù I misunderstood and responded sarcastically, which made her cry and bring up her mom‚Äôs death. We both got emotional, and she ultimately blocked me on socials but not on my phone.

I still care about her and want to stay friends, though I don‚Äôt know why. At the very least, I want to return the sentimental items she lent me (she‚Äôs mentioned how important they are). I was thinking of messaging her to ask if she wants to pick them up, mail them, or wait until we (potentially) see each other again?",1,1736250010.0,relationships_advice,2,1.0,False

If you really want any meaningful change you need to boycott businesses with practices you do not support. Nothing is accomplished by you staring down a 15 year old and saying no tip, buy a coffee maker or go to a local cafe. It‚Äôs ridiculous to be upset about rising prices, tipping integration into all POS (half of these places do not tip out employees) and heavy handed corporate pressured training tactics and somehow emerge with the opinion that it‚Äôs the fault of the cashier or drive thru attendant. YOU ARE PATRONIZING THESE BUSINESS AND KEEPING THEM AFLOAT. Vote with your wallet, explore your area and talk to the people serving you, I worked for starbucks for a little bit and I promise you not a single person wants to stick their entire body out of a tiny window and beg someone death staring you for 35 cents, it‚Äôs humiliating.

We get on really well, give ourselves tasks to do every day, we're  laid back unless we need to have a big discussion about things. That being said, our brother is being difficult at the moment. Currently, he is the only person working a full-time, 9-5 job, since my sister works flexible hours as cover for sickness, and I'm currently off long-term sick (lots of health stuff going on). We generally don't tend to bother him because we know he gets stressed about the fact that he works so much, so anything we do ask him to do is either because we really need help, or it's something small that wouldn't make much of an impact when asked to do it. He is also the only one who is able to drive, having gotten his licence just over a year ago, due to neither myself or my sister being able to financially afford to buy a car. (Myself, I've had lessons in the past, and was close to passing, but then covid happened, and since then my mental and physical health has continued to decline. I've had to reduce my hours, which just gives me enough every month to pay for rent, food, and just recently gifts for Christmas.)

However, he is autistic and has ADHD. So asking him to do things is always a touchy subject, and sometimes we don't know how he's going to react. Sometimes he can be OK with it and act upon things with the new knowledge that it is important to us, and other times he'll roll his eyes, moan and groan, sigh, and exaggerate his movement to show that he's doing it but he's not happy.

Over Christmas, he was especially distant and frustrated, because our parents returned home. My dad can drive, but he had a hand operation which meant he couldn't drive for 2 weeks. My brother was the one we had to rely on, mostly for shopping and hospital appointments (for my parents), and one time to collect medication for our cat with epilepsy. Previously, a week before Christmas, I had to ask my brother to take me to A&E because I was suffering with severe pain and bleeding. He asked me if I could take a taxi instead. It did turn out that he had been visiting the same hospital for routine health stuff over the previous couple weeks and didn‚Äôt want to go back, but for me this was an emergency and I hadn't asked him to do anything else for me up until this point. He reluctantly took me, but went straight home afterwards. My sister was with me, and eventually my dad took over (as this was 2 days before his operation).

Turns out I might have cancer. We told him this, because he's family and needs to know, and he didn't seem phased. Of course, it could be due to his autism that he didn't know how to process it, but since then he hasn't shown any concern or support when I'm struggling with pain. I don't expect him to run and jump to do anything, but he hasn't shown nearly the same amount of support as my parents and sister have. There is a chance that it might not be cancer, and I'm not milking for sympathy because I'm not that kind of person, but he's clearly not bothered by this information.

Now, on to the actual issues. He's leaving his empty cups of coffee out in the living room and on the dining table, that he has every morning before work. We've spoken to him about it multiple times before and he usually starts to clean it up again, but I'm reluctant to ask him again since he's been so busy the last few weeks. We have this rule, that if we leave something out then we have to clean it up, not leave it to other people (we do this because our parents were the opposite and used to make us clean up after them all the time). He knows this is the rule.

He also likes to cook, which is amazing and he's a great cook, but afterwards we have to clean up after him. Not pots and pans and utensils, but food and liquid and herbs and spices that he's used to make the food. Again  we've asked him to clean up after himself, but he forgets after a while.

There are other small things that, normally, we wouldn't worry about asking him to do, but I feel bad asking him after all that he's done recently. So, would I be the asshole if I did?",1,1736249161.0,AmItheAsshole,2,1.0,False

First time that‚Äôs happened in over a dozen years. I think I‚Äôm actually doing it this time!,"Hi everyone. I‚Äôve been a very heavy drinker for 12 years and decided to quit smoking and drinking as a New Year‚Äôs resolution. I‚Äôve had the same resolution every year and never made it more than a couple days, but this year is different.

I‚Äôve been a 8-10 beer a night guy for over a decade and decided I‚Äôm tired of feeling like crap and missing memory making opportunities with my kids because I wait til they go to bed and spend three hours getting loaded then waking up hung over. 

So I quit on 12/31. Haven‚Äôt had a drop or smoke since. Last night my wife had some wine and I didn‚Äôt want any, just had no interest. I guess my body is really telling me it‚Äôs ready to stop.

The only downside is I can‚Äôt sleep more than 6 hours and that 6 hours is tossing and turning. It‚Äôs 4am and I‚Äôm sitting here awake because I fell asleep at 10pm. I don‚Äôt need to be up for 3 hours and I would prefer to be asleep, but I‚Äôm wide awake. But better than waking up groggy and hung over.

I‚Äôve quit dozens of times and none felt like this. I never just had no interest in drinking previously, I had to fight. This time is different. Not sure why. Maybe because of a medication I‚Äôm on for weight loss? Not sure. But I‚Äôm loving sobriety.

Also, had sex last night and it felt better than I can remember it feeling in years. Does long term drinking affect sensitivity down there? Not sure, but things just felt more sensitive than they have in years. Could be my imagination.",23,1736249003.0,stopdrinking,7,1.0,False

1hvpaxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcissistic_People/comments/1hvpaxp/narcissistic_predator_ex/,Narcissistic Predator Ex,"It started like any typical day in my life as a 32-year-old waitress working in a casino. I was full of life, content with my job, and surrounded by friends. I had no idea how everything would change that fateful night. I was standing at the bar when he‚Äîthe regional operations director‚Äîapproached me. He asked me about my job, where I was from, and about my life. At first, I found him charming enough, but something about his presence unsettled me. His aura had this dark energy that I couldn‚Äôt shake off.

After my shift ended, I went home and thought nothing of it. A few days later, though, he added me on Facebook. I found it odd‚Äîwhy would someone so high up in the casino hierarchy want to be connected to someone like me, a waitress? Still, I accepted the request, trying to give him the benefit of the doubt.

Then, on Christmas Day, he sent me a message wishing me a Merry Christmas‚Ä¶ and added a kiss at the end. It was strange, and it felt out of place for someone I hardly knew. I brushed it off, though, not wanting to overthink it. Over the next few days, we exchanged messages, and before long, we were texting every day. He was funny, charming, and appeared to have an adventurous, positive outlook on life. I was intrigued, yet cautious. We talked like we had known each other for years, and he sold himself as someone I should want to be around.

After about a month, he asked me out to dinner. At this point, I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect. I agreed, hoping to learn more about him. From the moment we met in person, I sensed the same dark energy that had unsettled me when I first met him. He spoke about his trauma‚Äîhis mother‚Äôs mistreatment and how his ex had cheated on him. It was heavy for a first date, and I felt uncomfortable. But I didn‚Äôt walk away.

As the evening continued, I saw something that raised more red flags: he stared at another woman who walked by. It was inappropriate, and it struck me as a sign of how little respect he had for me. But it didn‚Äôt end there. As we continued talking, he got angry over something trivial he had brought up. I could feel the tension rise, and the conversation became uncomfortable. I quickly changed the subject, but it was a moment I should‚Äôve walked away from.

I didn‚Äôt, though. The night ended, and I thanked him. He asked me to grab coffee later that week, but I told him I was busy. He didn‚Äôt let up, though, continuing to text me every day, each message more charming than the last. He seemed like a genuinely nice guy, and part of me was still unsure whether to trust my instincts.

A couple of weeks later, we went on another date, and this time, he appeared to be fine. We got along well, and a few days after that, we became official‚Äîboyfriend and girlfriend. But this is where things took a dark turn.

He began asking about my whereabouts all the time. He‚Äôd go through my phone without my permission. He told me to cut ties with my guy friends‚Äîfriends I had known for years and who were like brothers to me. He also wanted me to cut off some of my female friends. He told me to quit my job at the bar because ‚Äúguys could approach me there.‚Äù It was clear now: he was projecting his insecurities onto me, trying to control every aspect of my life.

The manipulation didn‚Äôt stop there. He started pressuring me for sex, even when I was tired or unwell. He didn‚Äôt care. If I resisted, he would accuse me of cheating or lying. If I wanted to have space or even just go for a haircut, he would twist it into something sinister, as if I was betraying him. My life became a constant cycle of justifying my actions, trying to prove my innocence, and living in fear of his anger.

I looked like a mess‚Äîtired all the time, emotionally drained. He had my full attention, but it wasn‚Äôt enough. He sucked the life out of me. Every argument we had was toxic, going around in circles for hours, with him painting me as the villain and himself as the helpless victim. The verbal abuse was relentless. He‚Äôd scream at me, call me names, and raise his voice to the point I couldn‚Äôt think straight. I couldn‚Äôt get a word in edgewise. He didn‚Äôt care.

I tried to break up with him many times, but each time, he would love-bomb me, sending me flowers or showering me with affection, only to fall back into the same toxic behavior. Then came the worst news: I found out I was pregnant with his child. I was terrified and confused, but I told him.

His response was cold and cruel. He initially said he‚Äôd be there for me, but then he turned on me, questioning if the baby was even his. He created more arguments and even suggested abortion, only to later claim he would pay for it. He twisted everything, making me feel like I was the one at fault for something that was entirely his responsibility, too.

I made the heartbreaking decision to have an abortion, and his reaction was beyond cruel. He didn‚Äôt comfort me. Instead, he cried for himself, called me horrible names, and threatened me with death. The emotional abuse was suffocating. He didn‚Äôt care that I was suffering; he only cared about controlling me and forcing me to believe his twisted narrative.

It didn‚Äôt stop there. Even when I tried to get away, he would send Uber Eats deliveries to my home‚Äîcoffees, chocolates, meals, always with ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù messages attached. He would send letters through the post. I blocked him everywhere, but he found ways to contact me. His manipulation was constant, trying to reel me back in with sweet words, only to continue the abuse once I was back.

The worst was when he kicked me out in the middle of the night, at 3 a.m. I had no place to go. I cried, begging him to let me back in, but he reveled in the power he had over me. I felt trapped, and it was killing me.

Eventually, I found out something that made everything worse: he was on anti-depressants and schizophrenia medication. His doctors had given him advice to cope with his toxic thoughts and breathing exercises to keep him grounded in reality. But he didn‚Äôt listen. Instead, he used his mental health as an excuse to manipulate and control me, putting me in the exhausting position of constantly defending myself and justifying my actions.

I tried leaving so many times, but each time, he escalated things‚Äîscreaming in my face, throwing objects, threatening me with police involvement. I was terrified. He would cry, beg me to come back, and threaten to harm himself when I tried to leave. The worst part was when he promised to discredit me to my employers, my family, and anyone else in my life. He wanted me to feel the pain he felt, and he was willing to destroy me to get that satisfaction.

And yet, there I was, still with him, feeling like I had no escape. I was trapped in his manipulative web, and I didn‚Äôt know how to break free. Every time I tried, he sucked me back in with promises that he would change.

I was living in a nightmare. A 39-year-old man with four children‚Äîhe should have known better. But his behavior was toxic, and he refused to see it. I was nothing more than a pawn in his sick game of control. The emotional toll it took on me was unbearable.

Finally, after two years of hell, I knew I had to cut ties. I blocked him everywhere, but his attempts to reach me continued. He used bank transactions to send me money, followed by cruel messages like ‚Äúcheater, liar,‚Äù and then an ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù mixed in. He even reached out to my mom, trying to paint me in a bad light.

But my parents saw through his lies. They told me to cut him out of my life for good.  They said they we know who you are and we have your back no matter what. They reminded me of my strength and light and to run far from his toxicity and cut him off, And I did. His words are now nothing but noise. It was calming to hear my father support me when I felt so scared by this man.

He still contacts me to this day. It went from  60 No Caller ID calls to three per day now. But I don‚Äôt care anymore. I finally realized that I deserve peace, respect, and love‚Äînot manipulation, control, and fear. His karma will come.

And I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm moving on, reclaiming my life, and never looking back.

This is my story. It‚Äôs tragic. But I survived it. And I will keep surviving.",1,1736248953.0,Narcissistic_People,0,1.0,False
1hvpapf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hvpapf/problem_at_the_grocery/,Problem at the grocery,"Hopefully I can make this short but some of the problems that have arisen from this are causing an uproar. 
It was Tuesday morning grocery shopping on senior day and the night before I had a party at my house with friends to kick off the new year with a chili cook-off. Good times for had by all. 
I had to go to the grocery to resupply my pantry as we used up most of the stuff in the refrigerator and pantry for the party. I had forgotten that it was senior day and every single senior citizen in the neighborhood apparently was doing the same thing. The dread was beginning to well up inside me as I realized that it was going to be tough to navigate the isles to find what I needed and get out of there at a decent time. It was the usual boomers and retirees blocking the aisles and squinting at the shelves looking for the items they needed. I was losing my patience and my sanity. 
I kept searching for aisles that had fewer people in them so I could get to the areas that didn't have as many seniors roaming around. I grabbed a gallon of milk, some eggs, sliced cheese and a carton of orange juice and then wanted to check out the breakfast cereal aisle and then grab a bag of flour and rice and get the hell out of there.
I made it to the serial aisle okay and then look down the aisle where the flower, baking goods, oil rice and coffee were. It was jammed with about 15 seniors and they were all talking to each other. I knew I had little chance of making it so I parked my cart at the end of the aisle and started to push my way down the aisle when suddenly a bad case of bubble gut hit me. I was thinking this was the worst possible time and I knew I only had moments to find a restroom but I was trapped in the middle of a gauntlet of senior citizens on the scene. 
The first release of gas was immense and was possibly the absolute most evil and foul smelling I had ever produced in my life. I quickly started pushing my way through trying to get to the rear of the store where the restrooms were. I knew I didn't have much time left before a major disaster. 
I was grouped by another bout of noxious gas and I tried to release it as slowly as possible but this time I was barely able to clamp my ass shut and a little squirted out this time. I knew it was going to be bad but I made it to the end of the aisle and only had about 10 more steps to reach the restrooms but I had encountered two old ladies at the end of the aisle that were blocking my exit. I looked around and said excuse me and when I looked around all of the other seniors had left the aisle. They were gone. They disappeared. 
My fart was so noxious that every single person in the aisle silently left in a hurry. 
The two old ladies moved to side and I got to the toilet just in time to release and explosion of volcanic proportions into the porcelain throne. I braved the sigh of relief and then got hit with the same noxious gas that I had released in the aisle and I nearly passed out right there. AITA? ",0,1736248926.0,AITAH,2,0.5,False

Just to know that he is not even intermediate passed fellow but a Para medical lab technician who is faking as doctor in the city and diagnosing the patients and selling medicines and claiming to be doctor (RMP) AND Pharm D. Graduate.


I felt insulted, It's an insult to every serious NEET Aspirant, To every doctor who works hard and studied hard thru out the years to get that Prefix, that designation, that professionality. 


And here are the clowns who sits in self made hospital and self claimed doctors. 


I felt insulted because I very much value education as I'm from the field of education. 
Last 2 3 months I've been studying hard just to qualify an exam. 
I have disqualified twice already. And these clowns, these people are insult to us. 

If u think I'm Shaming them, yes I am. It's shame for all the doctors.
He could have not claimed to be doctor and be respectful towards my father, and be honest with him. He could've just said, I just wrote it for fun and manipulate people, I'm just a delusional man. 

(Nenu tittukoleni buthulu levv) 


TLDR : OP got a proposal from a self claimed doctor, after asking certificates, he avoided sending, OPs' father sent a relative to this self claimed delulu doctor to check the certificate, came to know he is vocational lab technician whose certificate is expired.",12,1736248839.0,bondha_diaries,15,0.93,False

1hvp9bg,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hvp9bg/2nd_hand_espresso_machine_700/,2nd Hand Espresso Machine [700‚Ç¨],"Hi fellow baristas,

I came across with the Rocket Espresso Milano Cellini on Facebook Marketplace. I require all of your expertise regarding the points I should be careful while inspecting before buying it. Pictures are enclosed below, I know it doesn't say much but the case of the machine is not so important for me. Please enlighten your fellow fella who is dreaming about rocket espresso machine since 2016..

Retail price is tagged as 420 ‚Ç¨, but I think I can lower it easily to 400. Portafilter is missing so even though, I was granted to make a demo espresso shot it is not possible..

I read previous posts about second hand espresso machines and I will try to inspect the following points,

* Test all buttons, switches, and knobs to ensure that they work properly.
* the steam wand and hot water dispenser function .
* the pressure gauge for proper readings.
* Removing the top cover and inspect for signs of leaks or overheated wiring connections.

seller doesn't have an idea about water treatment practices¬†or maintenance history of the machine. so it is a gamble that I am kind of aware.

I worked during my university years in coffee shops as barista, and I believe basic things I can try to fix by myself. This machine is intended for house use for me, typically 5-10 drinks. Usually black occasionally we'll do of course some drinks. I will pair it with my hand grinder Commandante for beginning.  

Thank you dears!

I am talking about a proper, strong, icy coffee with perfect proportions of ice/milk/espresso that you can actually taste the coffee. Bonus points if it‚Äôs made with a double shot of acidic espresso and premium milk that gives you nutty flavor. But I don‚Äôt expect that. I‚Äôm not delusional. I‚Äôd happily settle for an iced latte that simply doesn‚Äôt taste like mildly coffee-flavored milk. But even that is asking for a miracle here. Even regular hot latte in Europe is generally way too mild, because obviously real adults only drink espresso.

Everyone here, especially the very classy and sophisticated French and Italians, think I don‚Äôt know how to drink coffee because I like a kid‚Äôs drink. ‚ÄúIced coffee isn‚Äôt real coffee, you should come to France for real coffee,‚Äù they say. Well, I‚Äôve been there many times and your coffee shit. You think iced coffee is bad because you don‚Äôt know how to make a good one!

I tried ‚Äúiced coffee‚Äù all over Europe and it‚Äôs a nightmare every single time. Shakerato is a joke. You make hot coffee, toss it in a shaker with one only ice cube, and call it a day? Excuse me? That‚Äôs not iced coffee. That‚Äôs an espresso and foamy milk having an identity crisis. And don‚Äôt even get me started on the espresso itself. It‚Äôs like they keep the worst beans and most bitter shots for us uncultured tourists because we don‚Äôt know the real coffee.

Even when they do have iced lattes on the menu, it doesn‚Äôt mean anything. Either they don‚Äôt know what that means, or pretend they don‚Äôt know what it is, or simply don‚Äôt have it(mind you they have it in the menu) and I get kicked out, or charge me a lot more for a bad milkshake. Or they‚Äôll make a single shot latte with way too much milk, so it‚Äôs just milk at that point, and add three little sad iced cubes ~because I paid more for that~ that melt instantly. It‚Äôs like drinking icy coffee-ish soup. Well, at least it‚Äôs icy.

It‚Äôs a whole other nightmare if you dare to order it in winter. You‚Äôll see how judgemental Europeans can be very quickly. Relax lady, I didn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm drinking it outside in the snow. Although I could, and I would enjoy it very much. It‚Äôs quite refreshing honestly, give it a try.

So I just paid 8.90 euros for one and a half cups of iced latte (the first was single shot so I had to order another) in an extremely cheap country in Europe, and it‚Äôs pure trash. But I should be grateful that they have it at least, especially in winter. The barista was nice, the place is cozy and quiet, so it‚Äôs still a much better experience than most. So here I am, sipping my sad excuse for a latte, typing out this rant.

What I don‚Äôt understand is, if your culture doesn‚Äôt do iced coffee and locals don‚Äôt drink it, why make some abomination and insist that‚Äôs what iced coffee is? If you are only making it for clueless tourists like me, why not just copy how it‚Äôs done elsewhere? Why give me some weird version of shakerato or whatever that shit is, when I ordered an iced latte?

Being addicted to specifically iced lattes is pure torture when you live in Europe. Their winters arn‚Äôt cold enough for hot coffee anyways. Thanks Europe, for making my caffeine addiction so miserable.",0,1736248659.0,CasualConversation,6,0.22,False

Just like (presumably) most women, I match with a large percentage of men I swipe right on - these are mostly 'average' men in my age group, not male models, billionaires or anything like that; not in any ways 'out of my league' I would say.

In maybe 90% of cases, men ask me to meet pretty much straight after matching. Let's say hi how are you / where are you from etc., really basic message exchange, then they ask if I want to meet for lunch / dinner / coffee. When I tell them I would like to converse longer first to see if we have things in common, in the vast majority of cases they simply unmatch immediately, or send a message along the lines 'I am not looking for a penpal' etc.

I am not looking for a penpal either, but it does not make sense to me to spend my time getting ready for dates and meeting lots of men I did not even have a basic conversation with, just based on a few photos and hi how are you. Is this happening to other people, if so, how are you all handling it? I am kind of new to online dating and not sure what to make of this. 

Since it kept happening, I eventually agreed to meet one guy I hardly spoke to beforehand, but it was such a negative experience - he completely misrepresented himself in his profile and had no social skills etc., I was desperate to leave after the first 5 minutes, and I spent over an hour getting ready for that date doing my hair, makeup, nails etc. and then travelled and paid for a very expensive coffee I didn't need and wasted a couple of hours of my life. I really don't want to be in this situation again but what else can I do - is it normal that men don't want to have a conversation before the first meeting?",8,1736248232.0,Bumble,38,0.83,False

I spent a bit of time in read-only mode but I feel like I can express my somewhat specific thought here. I'll do a little intro, it's just important to explain my thought, sorry!

I'm a lesbian woman but I like shipping. I don't usually limit myself to WLW pairings, I like everything at once, but today while I was drinking coffee and scrolling through reddit, a thought was spinning in my brain like an annoying dwarf looking for a precious vein. We all know that hoyo uses the fanservice strategy for women and gay people as a hidden ship of two characters. After all, someone has to buy the merch lol.

And for the most part, I don't like the pairings that hoyo is pushing on us. I've already gotten a couple of death wishes in some sub for saying that I don't like the pairings Aventurine x Ratio, Dan Heng x Blade, and Argenti x Boothill.

I don't have an ounce of negative emotions towards these pairings, they're just not my rice bowl. But there is one possible one that worries me.

Anaxa and Phainon. I'll be honest with you. Su is one of the most bland characters in hi3 in general. My stages of this pairing were something like indifference (why, there's the beautiful Mei) - some interest - indifference again (Otto is my baby and the toxic relationship of two idiots). I'm not even sure that Anaxa is an expy at all, and not the Alhaitham situation. But everyone around is sure and everyone around is also sure that the hoyos are obliged to pair him with Phainon. Or with MC, which is even worse lol.

And I'm sitting with my Mydei. And I hope that what Hoyo started now (and for now the hidden fanserfic is happening between Phainon and Mydei) will continue. And I just feel that it can become as toxic as always, if you dared not to like the ""main"" pairing. And every time I think of situations on twitter, when Blade and DHIL shippers bullied everyone else and then Ratio and Aventurine shippers attacked and filth in the Topaz and Aventurine and Ratio and Argenti tags.

I don't know why I'm writing this, probably because I want to talk about it a little.

Then, on Christmas Day, he sent me a message wishing me a Merry Christmas‚Ä¶ and added a kiss at the end. It was strange, and it felt out of place for someone I hardly knew. I brushed it off, though, not wanting to overthink it. Over the next few days, we exchanged messages, and before long, we were texting every day. He was funny, charming, and appeared to have an adventurous, positive outlook on life. I was intrigued, yet cautious. We talked like we had known each other for years, and he sold himself as someone I should want to be around.

After about a month, he asked me out to dinner. At this point, I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect. I agreed, hoping to learn more about him. From the moment we met in person, I sensed the same dark energy that had unsettled me when I first met him. He spoke about his trauma‚Äîhis mother‚Äôs mistreatment and how his ex had cheated on him. It was heavy for a first date, and I felt uncomfortable. But I didn‚Äôt walk away.

As the evening continued, I saw something that raised more red flags: he stared at another woman who walked by. It was inappropriate, and it struck me as a sign of how little respect he had for me. But it didn‚Äôt end there. As we continued talking, he got angry over something trivial he had brought up. I could feel the tension rise, and the conversation became uncomfortable. I quickly changed the subject, but it was a moment I should‚Äôve walked away from.

I didn‚Äôt, though. The night ended, and I thanked him. He asked me to grab coffee later that week, but I told him I was busy. He didn‚Äôt let up, though, continuing to text me every day, each message more charming than the last. He seemed like a genuinely nice guy, and part of me was still unsure whether to trust my instincts.

A couple of weeks later, we went on another date, and this time, he appeared to be fine. We got along well, and a few days after that, we became official‚Äîboyfriend and girlfriend. But this is where things took a dark turn.

He began asking about my whereabouts all the time. He‚Äôd go through my phone without my permission. He told me to cut ties with my guy friends‚Äîfriends I had known for years and who were like brothers to me. He also wanted me to cut off some of my female friends. He told me to quit my job at the bar because ‚Äúguys could approach me there.‚Äù It was clear now: he was projecting his insecurities onto me, trying to control every aspect of my life.

The manipulation didn‚Äôt stop there. He started pressuring me for sex, even when I was tired or unwell. He didn‚Äôt care. If I resisted, he would accuse me of cheating or lying. If I wanted to have space or even just go for a haircut, he would twist it into something sinister, as if I was betraying him. My life became a constant cycle of justifying my actions, trying to prove my innocence, and living in fear of his anger.

I looked like a mess‚Äîtired all the time, emotionally drained. He had my full attention, but it wasn‚Äôt enough. He sucked the life out of me. Every argument we had was toxic, going around in circles for hours, with him painting me as the villain and himself as the helpless victim. The verbal abuse was relentless. He‚Äôd scream at me, call me names, and raise his voice to the point I couldn‚Äôt think straight. I couldn‚Äôt get a word in edgewise. He didn‚Äôt care.

I tried to break up with him many times, but each time, he would love-bomb me, sending me flowers or showering me with affection, only to fall back into the same toxic behavior. Then came the worst news: I found out I was pregnant with his child. I was terrified and confused, but I told him.

His response was cold and cruel. He initially said he‚Äôd be there for me, but then he turned on me, questioning if the baby was even his. He created more arguments and even suggested abortion, only to later claim he would pay for it. He twisted everything, making me feel like I was the one at fault for something that was entirely his responsibility, too.

I made the heartbreaking decision to have an abortion, and his reaction was beyond cruel. He didn‚Äôt comfort me. Instead, he cried for himself, called me horrible names, and threatened me with death. The emotional abuse was suffocating. He didn‚Äôt care that I was suffering; he only cared about controlling me and forcing me to believe his twisted narrative.

It didn‚Äôt stop there. Even when I tried to get away, he would send Uber Eats deliveries to my home‚Äîcoffees, chocolates, meals, always with ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù messages attached. He would send letters through the post. I blocked him everywhere, but he found ways to contact me. His manipulation was constant, trying to reel me back in with sweet words, only to continue the abuse once I was back.

The worst was when he kicked me out in the middle of the night, at 3 a.m. I had no place to go. I cried, begging him to let me back in, but he reveled in the power he had over me. I felt trapped, and it was killing me.

Eventually, I found out something that made everything worse: he was on anti-depressants and schizophrenia medication. His doctors had given him advice to cope with his toxic thoughts and breathing exercises to keep him grounded in reality. But he didn‚Äôt listen. Instead, he used his mental health as an excuse to manipulate and control me, putting me in the exhausting position of constantly defending myself and justifying my actions.

I tried leaving so many times, but each time, he escalated things‚Äîscreaming in my face, throwing objects, threatening me with police involvement. I was terrified. He would cry, beg me to come back, and threaten to harm himself when I tried to leave. The worst part was when he promised to discredit me to my employers, my family, and anyone else in my life. He wanted me to feel the pain he felt, and he was willing to destroy me to get that satisfaction.

And yet, there I was, still with him, feeling like I had no escape. I was trapped in his manipulative web, and I didn‚Äôt know how to break free. Every time I tried, he sucked me back in with promises that he would change.

I was living in a nightmare. A 39-year-old man with four children‚Äîhe should have known better. But his behavior was toxic, and he refused to see it. I was nothing more than a pawn in his sick game of control. The emotional toll it took on me was unbearable.

Finally, after two years of hell, I knew I had to cut ties. I blocked him everywhere, but his attempts to reach me continued. He used bank transactions to send me money, followed by cruel messages like ‚Äúcheater, liar,‚Äù and then an ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù mixed in. He even reached out to my mom, trying to paint me in a bad light.

But my parents saw through his lies. They told me to cut him out of my life for good. And I did.

He still contacts me to this day. But I don‚Äôt care anymore. I finally realized that I deserve peace, respect, and love‚Äînot manipulation, control, and fear. His karma will come.

And I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm moving on, reclaiming my life, and never looking back.

How can I deal with this?,"As the title says my (F49) bf M(50) of 1,5 year keeps on disappointing me. And I'm sure my expectations aren't extreme since I had a fulfilling relationship with my late husband. To give some examples, he comes to my place about 1 day in the weekend but almost always arrives around dinner time so there isn't much time left to do something together that day. In the 1,5 year we've been together we haven't gone out for dinner once, never went to the cinema, theatre, musea of similar. We did go on a week long vacation half a year into our relationship but that was not great. It was al organised and paid for by me. He took zero initiative to do anything. Every time we left the apartment it was initiated by me. Also we had unnecessary fights that left me very confused. Whenever I address the lack of fun things we do he just respons with yeah, we can do that. And that's it. Mostly If I want to do something, he just tells me to go by myself. So I'm disappointed. But there's more. He comes to bed very late (early morning late) and as a result also sleeps in until late afternoon. Then he has some coffee plus a smoke and goes home because he has things to do. So also on the next day there just isn't time to do anything together. Al we do is watch movies and smoke weed. That's it. He also keeps disappointing me in not wanting to meet my family and friends. Or introducing me to people that are important to him. I'm not allowed to see his house because he's ashamed of the place. Because all these things are lacking I find it difficult to call what we have a real relationship and I also don't see a future if it doesn't improve. The last 6 months it even became worse because he is denying me intimacy. I had an injury last summer that made me struggle a lot and I was frustrated about the situation. Apparently that was such a turn off for him he now flat out refuses to be intimate. He hugs me but doesn't really touch me. I have addressed my disappointment about this as well and he responds by saying next time he'll make it up to me. Well, as you can guess, he doesn't. He always promises to make things up to me but doesn't. And as a result I'm disappointed. Basically every time we meet, something happens (or better said, nothing happens) and I have to deal with disappointment. This is really starting to take it's toll on my mental health and I'm feeling down for almost a year now. But I stay with him because I love him and he says he loves me a lot as well. But right now I'm not so sure if my love for him is enough to put up with all this anymore. About 10 months ago I already had a conversation with him about all my dissatisfactions (careful with not making it accusations) but nothing has changed. I plan to repeat this conversation in the near future and now also include the lack of intimacy as a point. So far his response to these type of conversations are to threat to end the relationship, throw accusations in my face  and then just leave my house. I would really like to hear some advice from outsiders on how to deal with this. Or perhaps learn I am being unreasonable in my expectations.",2,1736246822.0,relationship_advice,18,0.75,False

1hvorfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadviceformen/comments/1hvorfy/fairweather_feminists/,Fairweather Feminists ,"The baristas at my favorite coffee shop flirt with me every time I visit, but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre going to anymore.

A few weeks ago, as I was writing an essay at my desk in the shop, one of the the pipes in the kitchen sink burst, provoking a barista to shout,

‚ÄúDoes anyone know how to turn off a water valve?!‚Äù

I was the only guy there, so every woman instinctively oriented their attention towards me to save the day. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm not mechanically inclined whatsoever, so I had no idea what a water valve looked like, let alone how to turn one off.

I told them I didn‚Äôt know how to solve their problem, and the panic that was on their faces instantly switched to that of complete disgust and confusion; like they couldn‚Äôt fathom how the guy they admired was incapable of doing something that a man should¬†know how to do.

After I revealed my ineptitude, a woman stepped up, told them how to shut the valve off, and everyone went on about their day.

This was unequivocally and emphatically the most embarrassed I‚Äôve ever felt in my entire life.

# Feelings of Incompetence

I‚Äôve extensively written about masculinity and the importance of men being able to do what society expects from them at any given time, but that day I failed.

I know that as a man embarking on a journey to become more masculine, I need to become more handy and learn how to repair and maintain vehicles and domestic items, because people (especially women) will believe I am a less capable and competent man otherwise.

In spite of this, I‚Äôve still made no effort at improving this aspect of my life. And as one would expect, women who formerly thought I was one of the hottest guys in the city, effectively lost all attraction for me in an instant.

Frankly, I don‚Äôt care about the baristas no longer being attracted to me ‚Äì there are 4 billion women on the planet, I‚Äôll encounter more who are.

What I am concerned about are the intense feelings of incompetence and uselessness that I sustained after not being able to help them when they needed me. I never want to feel like I‚Äôm not a man ever again.

# Gender Roles Exist For A Reason

Contrary to what women ‚Äì especially feminists ‚Äì say, they will instinctively default to a man‚Äôs authority when shit hits the fan, or a problem arises that men are expected to know how to solve.

Women throw any semblance of equality right out the window the second a man is truly needed for anything; there‚Äôs no woman in her right mind who would want to take turns confronting a burglar every time one invaded their home. They‚Äôd expect their husband to do it while she hides away.

Of course, most women would never overtly state this because a) society has conditioned them to believe and espouse the idea that men and women are equal, and b) it‚Äôs unflattering.

Thanks to the heinous and idiotic media and education system that indoctrinates children the second they enter pre-kindergarten, both men and women alike oppose their nature and regurgitate nonsense that they don‚Äôt agree with subconsciously.

There‚Äôs a reason that EVERY SINGLE WOMAN in the coffee shop looked at me when the water valve broke despite their social conditioning. They subconsciously knew that a man was most likely the most capable of solving the problem, as it was one men are expected to know how to solve.

And this isn‚Äôt just a one-off situation. There have been numerous times in which women have gladly defaulted to my authority when a problem that men are expected to know how to solve arises.

Violent homeless guy walks into a bar and starts threatening customers? Women look at me to deal with it.

Woman needs her car jump-started after her battery died? She steps aside, and follows my lead without being directed to.

Strange noise at the front door in the middle of the night? Looks at me for instruction and lets me handle it.

Of course, women can tell men to leave them alone, watch YouTube videos to fix their vehicle issues, and purchase guns to defend themselves, but their instinct in situations like these (and especially ones in which their safety is compromised) is to follow a man‚Äôs lead. They only stop following men when they demonstrate ineptitude.

Moreover, women don‚Äôt reveal truths like this because it‚Äôs unflattering. You can‚Äôt expect women to openly say stuff like, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a man, you should just know how to do this.‚Äù or,‚Äú Yeah, I‚Äôd obviously prefer a male police officer's help over a female cops when someone‚Äôs trying to break into my house.‚Äù because it makes them look bad to men and women who reinforce mainstream ideas.

Women evolved to be more agreeable and kind than men (and they‚Äôre conditioned to behave this way from a young age) so they‚Äôre more concerned with making others feel good, even if that means blatantly lying about their sincere desires.

So, the next time you hear a delusional woman debase the utility of men, ask her who she would want by her side when her life‚Äôs on the line. If she responds with anything along the lines of, ‚ÄúThe person most capable of helping me.‚Äù she‚Äôs too far gone.

I love my daughter, make no mistake, but this baby thing suck ass. I wonder if it even makes me depressed. 

We had a very rough birth without going into details. The following 3-4 months was pretty good I think, but I ran mostly on adrenalin and coffee. 

We're at 10 months now and she has almost always slept relatively well at night. I won't complain about it. She typically wakes up 2-4 times and sleeps about 12,5 hours a day with two 30-60 min naps (one is always 30 minutes). The short day naps have always been short and it is what it is. 

I think what absolutely drains me is the lack of normality. I can't go to the gym, golf, play tennis, go to the pub or anything without feeling guilty. I haven't watched television in about 6 months. Can't chill for 10 minutes if she's awake. My wife has tried giving me breaks to do stuff now and then, but it's like a piss in the ocean. Doesn't help much at all. But my wife is a great person so she keeps trying. 

Playing alone is obviously not happening at this age.

Refuses to cuddle. 

She doesn't want to be changed. It's always a complete warzone. 

She just got out of a regression we think and instantly turned super whiny during the day. It's WA WA WA WA  whining all the time. Suppose it's teething. 

She wants to walk, but can't. 

She wants everything she can't have and anything she gets is fun for about 2 minutes. 

Never a relaxing moment. Never. 

Haven't had sex in fucking eons. 

Have headaches almost daily. 

I feel I've given up everything in my life I enjoyed, to endure bullshit all the time every day. And it never seems to fucking end. 

If I could click a button and age her 5 years I honestly would consider it. I obviously wouldn't do it, but you know what I mean. 

I would never walk out on my child or wife, but this stuff has honestly made me understand why some people do it and can't hack it post birth.

My life has become a fucking chore where everyday consists of surviving to bed time.

Why anyone likes this baby stuff is nuts. Beyond me.

Well, here I am once again looking for love on Reddit. I suppose there are worse places‚Ä¶right? Anyways‚Ä¶

So, a bit about me. I am really introverted (INFP for those of you keeping score at home), but I‚Äôm told I don‚Äôt shut up once I‚Äôm comfortable with you. My love language is sharing music :) I love having deep conversations over coffee or tea. 

I love enjoy reading. History, (particularly U.S. and intellectual history), philosophy (I enjoy dabbling in existentialism in particular), and literature (Kafka, Chekhov, Milan Kundera, and Raymond Carver are among my favorite writers). I love film, especially foreign film and films that are a bit more cerebral or absurd. Wes Anderson, Charlie Kauffman, the Coen brothers, and Ingmar Bergman are among my favorites. I often find meaning in music. Cloud Cult has been especially comforting for me this year. I also love Bright Eyes, the National, Okkervil River, and Leonard Cohen‚Äîto name a few. I also love writing poetry and short stories. 

Physically, I‚Äôm 6‚Äô5‚Äù. I have green eyes and brown hair. I‚Äôm a normal weight. I like to be active. My favorite form of exercise is taking long walks. 

I‚Äôm looking for someone who might be open to a relationship at some point. These things take time, so I‚Äôm not looking to rush things. I‚Äôm looking for someone who loves having deep conversations. Someone who wants to explore art museums or discussing their favorite literature or philosophy. Someone I can share music with and help each other through our days. Building an emotional connection is important to me. 

I‚Äôm in the CST time zone, but I work really early hours, meaning I‚Äôm up in the middle of the night sometimes. So the time difference isn‚Äôt always a problem for me if you think we might hit it off. I am open to voice and video chatting too once we are comfortable with each other. Thanks for reading. I hope everyone finds their person soon. I know how lonely this process can be. 

I guess to finish, I will channel my inner Macbeth and ask: 

‚ÄúIf life is but a walking shadow, a poor player, who struts and frets his hour on this stage. A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury signifying nothing‚Ä¶how would you like to be the leading lady in the tragedy of my life?‚Äù

Some days, it gives me energy and motivation to complete my tasks, while on other days, it causes drowsiness, laziness, and poor focus.

I‚Äôve tried many solutions. For instance, I‚Äôve taken Vyvanse on an empty stomach, and I‚Äôve taken it after eating. I‚Äôve tried the keto diet and a low-sugar diet. I‚Äôve used it with coffee and with matcha. I‚Äôve tried taking it after a high-protein meal and even increased the dosage. I‚Äôve also tried exercising, especially cardio, and using electrolytes.

However, none of these attempts have given me the consistent benefit I‚Äôm looking for. The problem lies in the unpredictable effects of Vyvanse‚Äîit sometimes energizes me, but other times it makes me sleepy and unproductive.

Do you have a specific diet or method that makes Vyvanse work better? My productivity at work has noticeably declined, and I‚Äôm eager to improve it. Please share your experiences.",5,1736246084.0,VyvanseADHD,6,1.0,False

I want to complain, to hate, send memes, laugh and wallow together. Oh right. Im looking for a friend (friends?) to vibe with day to day. Tell me what you're eating, send me pics or tiktoks, or tell me what video you're watching or what you're doing at the moment. Tell me how you're feeling, too.

I feel like I cannot get my husband on the same page as myself. 

I have lost my job and I am looking really hard to secure another one. Husband makes a good amount of money for both of us to have a good life. The issue here is that we relocated to a new country a year ago and all of his family members and friends with kids want to come and visit and stay in our home. We do not have kids yet and our apartment has only 2 beds and 2 baths.  Which is fine if it was for a few days, but it is for weeks. Which means, we will be covering food expenses for them, my husband will fund their coffees, restaurant bills when they all go out together, trips to visit new cities, and food at home. I will be cooking for them, BUT I have said to my husband I will no longer cook and accommodate everyone's different dietary requirements.   
One family member leaves, and we eventually have a few weeks alone until the next family members want to come. 

I have made myself clear with my family that they cannot visit until I have a job. 

I have spoken with my husband to ask him for his family members and friends to delay the trip until I find a job and I am out of the house. He is not on the same page as me, saying we have money, covering their bills is not a big issue, it is only a small amount etc. 

I do not want us treating other people, they will not contribute towards even a coffee for us and we have to pay for everything when they visit us. I think it is a bit too much. The worst thing is because I have not been able to find a job yet, I am at home most of the time so whenever I wake up early, I need to clear the mess from the guests, ask them for coffee etc. I just don't want this.

I have been a Reddit lurker for ages, but thought I would bite the bullet and open an account because I just wanted to share something for anyone going through a breakup right now and feeling like they‚Äôll never be okay again. 

I was that person a few months ago ‚Ä¶ crying constantly, I couldn‚Äôt eat or sleep and spent my time questioning everything, and feeling like my world had completely fallen apart. I honestly couldn‚Äôt see a way forward.

But here‚Äôs the thing: I am okay now. In fact, I‚Äôm better than okay. And I want to tell you what really helped me get here.

First, I started exercising. I hated the idea of it at first‚ÄîI was more of a ‚ÄòNetflix and cry‚Äô type of person‚Äîbut I dragged myself out for walks, then jogs, and eventually proper workouts. Honestly, it‚Äôs not just about getting fitter; it‚Äôs about giving your brain a break from the endless cycle of thinking about your ex. It made me feel stronger, mentally and physically.

Second, I leaned on my friends and colleagues more than I ever thought I could. I used to keep everything bottled up, but talking to people about how I was feeling helped so much. Even if it was just a rant over coffee or someone saying, ‚ÄúYeah, that really sucks,‚Äù it reminded me I wasn‚Äôt alone.

But the biggest thing? Going no contact. This was a game-changer for me. At first, it felt impossible. I wanted to check his social media, respond to his messages, and just‚Ä¶ keep that connection. But I read this book called Silence Is Your Superpower (It was someone on here who recommended it and I also highly recommend it, by the way), and it helped me understand how important no contact is. It gave me the tools to stick to it, and honestly, that‚Äôs when things started to shift for me.

I also started journaling my feelings. Like, really letting it all out on paper ‚Ä¶ the anger, the sadness, the regrets, everything. It‚Äôs wild how much it helped me process stuff.

And now? I wouldn‚Äôt take him back for all the tea in China. I see so clearly how much better off I am without him and how much I‚Äôve grown through this process.

If you‚Äôre reading this and struggling, I promise you: it gets better. Take small steps, keep showing up for yourself, and trust that one day you‚Äôll look back and be so proud of how far you‚Äôve come. You‚Äôve got this.

Love,
Someone who‚Äôs finally okay ‚ù§Ô∏è",4,1736245586.0,BreakUps,2,0.83,False

I've enjoyed exploring different coffees (bought with the Moka Pot grind I don't own a grinder).

Lately I've been thinking about upgrades and changes that I should make to enhance my experience further. Don't want it to be too expensive maybe something in the 4-6k range. Here are key questions - 1. Should I buy a grinder and continue with the Moka Pot? Is the difference that noticeable? 2. If not grinder should I move to an Aeropress? How different is that in taste to a Moka Pot?

Basically the question really is, how do I get the largest upgrade possible to my coffee with an investment of 4-6k? I like my coffee with Milk and light sugar (also use a generic milk frother).",2,1736245548.0,IndiaCoffee,2,1.0,False

I typically tend to default to apartment or house rentals rather than hotels. I was in love with these stays in Cappadocia, Fethiye, Istanbul, and Gocek if you want a sneak peek!

Rentals were a little weird for a while in Istanbul, but I believe that VRBO and Airbnb are now much smoother to use.

I‚Äôve frequently used Booking with great success in Turkey, although it‚Äôs important to know their website can‚Äôt operate in Turkey (unless you have a VPN) so have their and their or your hotel‚Äôs phone numbers handy when you travel just in case. TripAdvisor is great as well.

# A perfect 7-day Turkey itinerary

**Day 1:** Arrive in Istanbul, transfer flight to Cappadocia (this entire day is travel)

**Day 2:** Explore Cappadocia

**Day 3:** Morning in Cappadocia, fly to Fethiye

**Day 4:** Explore Fethiye, Ol√ºdeniz, other towns (consider paragliding!)

**Day 5:** Get to Gocek mid-morning, board boat for sailing trip

**Day 6:** Sailing

**Day 7:** Return to Gocek, fly from Dalaman to Istanbul; explore Istanbul

**Day 8 (through 10):** Istanbul in the morning, fly home

Istanbul could technically go on either end of the itinerary. HOWEVER, there are some logistics to consider. If you decide to return to your home country NOT from Istanbul (e.g. take a flight from Dalaman), it will need to connect through Istanbul anyway, and there‚Äôs always a chance of delays or cancellations that could make you miss your international flight home.

So with that said, I decided to do Istanbul at the end because it felt safer to fly to Turkey and immediately catch the connection to Cappdocia (with a long enough layover built in)

# Days 1-3: Cappadocia

After a 24-hour trip, I reached Cappadocia at midnight and went to sleep right away. The next day, I got up early. With just over one day there, I reserved two mornings for the hot air balloon ride and hotel viewing to make the best use of time.

Hot air balloons usually fly around 250 days annually, but bad weather can ground them. Sadly, I had bad luck as the wind stopped the flights on both mornings. However, I witnessed a beautiful (though freezing) sunrise on the second morning.

Cappadocia is famous for its charming caves and ‚Äúfairy chimneys‚Äù. You can admire them from the balloons and also explore them closely. I took a taxi to U√ßhisar Castle as a start and arranged with driver Osman to visit several places.

I was lucky to have a good guide. But if you're short of time and without a vehicle, it's better to choose quality local tours.We made short stops at Pigeon Valley, Panoramic Viewpoint and Love Valley. I explored Pasabag Valley with its unique features.

Osman took me to Zelve where I watched pottery-making and bought a statue. We also stopped at Devrent Valley briefly and ended at G√∂reme Open Air Museum.

It was a great day except for the absence of blue skies for nice photos. Zelve Open Air Museum, unnoticed in my research before, was the highlight. It has cave houses and churches showing ancient architecture and paintings. I highly recommend it. Osman also took me to a shop where women made delicious gozleme.

Despite the cloudy sunset, I watched it from Sunset Point in G√∂reme. For a better view, plan ahead. A tip: Skip testi kebab. Check my post for more.

# Days 3-4: Fethiye and Oludeniz

I chose Fethiye to stay along the coast as it's quieter and has less of a party vibe. Once the ancient city of Telmessos, Fethiye has a beautiful shoreline, distant hills and accessible ancient Lycian tombs.

I hiked to the Tomb of Amyntas in town which offers great city views. I rushed back down the hill to watch the sunset from my hotel balcony.

Next morning, Deep Blue Travel drove me to nearby Ol√ºdeniz. Its paragliding is world-class. Since I went skydiving for my 30th birthday, this seemed like a new tradition in the making.If you're considering it and want to book in advance, start researching companies here.

I spent a whole day in Ol√ºdeniz. I paid to enter the Blue Lagoon but liked Ol√ºdeniz Beach more. You can relax on the pebble beach listening to waves while paragliders float above, or enjoy a drink and lunch on the boardwalk and watch people.

# Days 5-7: Sailing the G√∂cek Islands

I met Sadi and Meryam at the harbor and boarded their boat ‚ÄúNirvana S‚Äù . I got some snacks and drinks from the store, but Meryam's great cooking took care of my meals and more snacks.We set off for the G√∂cek Islands and first stopped at Paradise Island.

Meryam guided me up a trail to the island's top for a panoramic view of the various shades of turquoise water, other islands, and fellow boaters.We spent much time on the water. I enjoyed the sun, drank tea and wine, read my Kindle, and relished my choices. We stopped at different places daily like Cleopatra/Hamaam Bay and Seagull Bay, and anchored differently each night.

I swam sometimes and indulged in Meryam's delicious cooking. The water's colors changed often, and we saw Lycian tombs along the shore. At Seagull Bay, Meryam led me to a magical private beach. One morning it rained and I stayed cozy in the cabin with tea and my Kindle. On my birthday morning, it was cool and clear. I watched the sun rise over the water with tea and took lots of pictures.

# Days 7-8 (or 10): Istanbul

I had a short time in one of my favorite cities, Istanbul. If you've never been, it deserves 2 - 3 days, but I wasn't as rushed this time as I'd seen many sights before. Even with little time, iconic places are close together, and I have a post on seeing major historical sites in 24 hours.

Consider the day of the week when visiting as mosques may have limited hours on Fridays and Hagia Sofia is usually closed on Mondays. Check closings, times, dress rules, etc. in advance. You could take a private tour with a local for a smooth visit.

For a first visit, prioritize like this: Hagia Sofia, Blue Mosque, Suleyman the Magnificent Mosque, food tour, ferry ride, Galata Bridge at sunset. If time allows, explore Galata Bridge area, Galata Tower to Istiklal Street, Spice Market. Grand Bazaar etc. are lower priority.

I wandered favorite areas, revisited Suleyman the Magnificent Mosque, watched sunset from Galata Bridge. I had a special birthday dinner at Mikla, which offers a modern take on Anatolian dishes. Turkish food is amazing, and food tours are great for trying different things.

On my last morning, I wandered Beyoƒülu's streets, soaked in the ambiance, found street art, interacted with cats and drank lots of coffee. I also tried some top coffee shops and you can consider a guided coffee tour for more experiences.",1,1736245536.0,u_5ber-eSIMCard,0,1.0,False

For a first visit, prioritize like this: Hagia Sofia, Blue Mosque, Suleyman the Magnificent Mosque, food tour, ferry ride, Galata Bridge at sunset. If time allows, explore Galata Bridge area, Galata Tower to Istiklal Street, Spice Market. Grand Bazaar etc. are lower priority.

I wandered favorite areas, revisited Suleyman the Magnificent Mosque, watched sunset from Galata Bridge. I had a special birthday dinner at Mikla, which offers a modern take on Anatolian dishes. Turkish food is amazing, and food tours are great for trying different things.

On my last morning, I wandered Beyoƒülu's streets, soaked in the ambiance, found street art, interacted with cats and drank lots of coffee. I also tried some top coffee shops and you can consider a guided coffee tour for more experiences.",1,1736245452.0,5ber_eSIM,0,1.0,False

I am quite doxable¬†so need to remain a bit vague. I've also rounded numbers since my spending is mostly in foreign currencies whose exchange rates with the USD vary.

Also, I am not u/sendhelpandthensome who had a great post yesterday about changing jobs in the international humanitarian/development sector. I suspect her MD would be quite different than mine (and probably much more interesting¬†than my basically-an-office-job!) I wrote this MD a while ago and was finally inspired to post it after seeing the interest in her post.

**Job Context:** I am an American working for an international humanitarian/development organization that operates across multiple countries. I frequently travel between those countries to manage my organization's research and evaluation activities in a region of Africa. My job involves managing a team of permanent staff as well as overseeing consultants/contractors who conduct research/evaluation activities on our behalf. It also involves duties like briefing and advising senior officials, staying up to date on events in the countries where we operate and the latest research, writing up and presenting our research/evaluation findings, managing the research/evaluation portfolio's budget and contracting, etc.¬†

# Assets and Debt

**Retirement:** $117,436, split between a Roth IRA, Rollover IRA, and my current 401k. I have had limited access to tax-advantaged retirement accounts for lots of my career (working for non-American companies, having limited US taxable income, etc.), otherwise more of my money would be in these accounts.

**Brokerage Account:** $222,029 in index funds.

**Savings Account:** $5,000. I only keep the cost of a flight home in my savings account. I am lucky to have people who could support me if my life were to turn upside down (plus there's always the option to withdraw from my brokerage account if worse comes to worst).

**Checking Account:** $6,377.

**Homeownership:** Nope.

**Debt:** None. Credit card is paid off every month. My parents + a small scholarship paid for my undergraduate degree from a state school, and a very large scholarship + around $10k from my grandfather + part time jobs paid for my Master's degree.

# Income

**Current Compensation:**¬†My base pay is $12k a month. I earn allowances (hazard pay, per diems, etc.) up to around¬†+30% per day¬†on top of my salary depending on my location on any given work day. I travel to a different country around every two weeks on average, so my pay is quite variable.¬†My employer covers most of my taxes (amazing perk for the obvious financial reasons, but also because my taxes would be pretty complex otherwise) and contributes 6% of my base pay to my 401k¬†(not yet vested). I pay $116 a month for health insurance. I contribute $1,917 per month to my 401k to max my yearly contribution. My monthly take-home after allowances, deductions, some small taxes, etc. is therefore around $11,000, although it varies based on time spent in various countries. My total compensation in the title is accordingly also an estimate.

**Income Progression:** Omitting details for privacy here, but suffice it to say that my current salary is by far the most money I have ever made in my life. It took a lot of low-paid jobs and internships to get to this point. Without graduating with two degrees debt free and having my family as a safety net, it would have been very difficult, if not impossible, to get here. This is a big challenge in this career field, as it is in many ""passion"" fields.

**Inheritances and Family Support:** In addition to support from my family to graduate with my degrees debt-free, I received around $30k total in inheritances from family members in the past five years, which I invested.

**Significant Other:** I am in a committed relationship but we're long distance, so do not combine any finances. My partner works in a similar-ish field and his income is comparable to mine.

# Expenses

**Rent:** \~$1,550 a month for a two bedroom apartment in my ""home base"" country. My rent includes all utilities/wifi and a cleaner every weekday.

**Renter's Insurance:** $11 a month.

**Phone:** I don't budget this as a monthly expense, because I use pay-as-you-go and it varies depending on how much I'm travelling. (Often averages around¬†$7 a month.)

**Subscriptions:** $11.99 a month for Spotify. $1.77 a month ($21.19 annually) for Google data storage.

**Gym Access:** \~$5 a month (\~$60 paid annually).

**Savings and Investments:** I do not set aside a fixed amount each month (outside of retirement). Instead, every couple pay periods, I put everything in my checking account in excess of around $5k (depending on projected upcoming spending, for example if I have a vacation planned) into my brokerage account. Since my expenses are fairly low and I don't spend excessively, this works well for me.

# Diary

**Day One (Tuesday):** I wake up at 7:30 and get ready for the day. I am working from my ""home base"" country this week. This country has a good quality of life - it's safe, you can travel within the country, there's¬†good restaurants and availability of diverse food, fun bars and nightlife, etc.

I pack lunch: tofu, veggies, and rice. I take a taxi to work as rain looks imminent. Taxis are ridiculously cheap here; it costs only around $2, including a small tip, to get to work. I arrive at work around 8:20, make coffee, and start editing some documents before a management meeting.

I eat my lunch after the meeting and get back to work. We recently hired a new member of my team who starts in country X next week and I want to be around to help with his orientation, so I check with my boss to confirm if I can travel next week and then email our admin assistant to book me flights to X for next Monday-Friday. X is a ""high risk"" country, and while I'm there I stay in secure accommodation and don't have much freedom to move around, but make extra money (hazard pay and per diems). The flights, taxis to/from the airports, and my visa are booked and paid for by work,¬†and work also arranges my accommodation.

After work, a coworker and I go out to grab pizza and a drink. I am in the midst of a two month sober stint which ends this Sunday, so we both get juice. I decided to pause drinking to try and improve my health, which is definitely affected by all my work travel, but I've missed drinking socially and feel like my health hasn't changed much. It's been good to take a step back and evaluate my relationship with alcohol, in any case.

Over our food and drinks, my coworker and I have a mostly positive, but very overwhelming, chat about office politics, our organization, and how I can best approach some challenges. I feel exhausted at the end of the talk. Expectations are high and I am stressed. My coworker pays for our pizza and juice, and I tip the waiter around $1.50 (I realize this sounds ridiculously cheap, but tipping is not the norm here). I then take a taxi home as it's almost dark, spending around $2 again.

It's been an overwhelming day, but my poker group is hosting a beginner's night tonight which I'd planned to attend. I play regularly with the group and am not a beginner, but I enjoy teaching people the basics. I almost back out but decide it'll be good for me to go and get my mind off work. I take a taxi to the host's house for around $3. Normally the group plays with a $20 buy-in, but since it's mostly beginners, we don't play for actual money tonight. I have a lot of fun and am glad I went.¬†At the end of the night, my friend gives me a ride home, and I fall asleep around midnight.

**Day Two (Wednesday):** Same morning routine,¬†same packed lunch. I walk to work, which takes around 30 minutes, and arrive at 8:30. My work day isn't particularly busy but is somewhat stressful, as we have a couple high profile reports that are pending edits and a bit out of my hands at the moment. The day ends on a decent note with a couple productive meetings about¬†finances and contracting, and then a nice catch up with one of my organization's technical specialists.¬†

I walk straight home after work, with no plans for the night. I eat some leftover stew and cook chickpeas, sweet potatoes, bell pepper, and broccoli for a second dinner and lunch tomorrow. Then I waste time on my phone before calling my partner Q for an hour.

As I head to bed at 10:30PM, music suddenly starts blaring. I'd actually woken up to music in the morning but assumed it was coming from a nearby school. Seems that it's coming from a new downstairs neighbor instead. I debate what to do and finally make a very mature decision to go downstairs and ask them to turn it down. Turns out to be a great decision because the neighbor is really nice and apologetic and immediately turns the music down to a reasonable volume. Success!

**Day Three (Thursday):** Same morning routine, with yesterday's leftovers packed for lunch. I walk to work and the weather is¬†the nicest it's been all week - hooray! My mood is immediately better. At work, I kick off a¬†new project with one of our research partners, related¬†to gender equity in our programs. Afterwards, I do some boring contract review work and do a data quality check on some internal program data.

Near the end of the day, I manage to get my boss on a ten minute call to follow up on some outstanding tasks. At the end of it I bring up a personal matter - I was¬†hoping to visit Q for a¬†long weekend in a month, and need my boss's permission to do so as it would affect my work travel plans. My boss is totally okay with it,¬†but because Q lives and works in a location that's classified as ""medium risk,"" he needs to¬†talk to our security team about it. Keeping my fingers crossed.

After work, I was planning to drop into a spin class. However, as I walk home, I pass a restaurant that has great food and outdoor seating where I can enjoy the nice weather. I can't help myself, and decide to skip the spin class to get some food. I message a friend who works nearby and she joins me. I get a lemonade, sandwich, and dessert for $20.20 before walking the rest of the way home.

I feel a little bad about skipping the spin class (although the food was delicious), so once I get home, I go for a quick 20 minute swim in my apartment's pool. I'm a new¬†swimmer - I only started swimming for exercise because I injured my ankle earlier this year - but am quite enjoying it. Afterwards, I eat the last piece of carrot bread I made for a dinner party last weekend and watch a couple episodes of Mare of Easttown before going to bed at 10:30.

**Day Four (Friday):** I didn't sleep well and wake up slightly late and a bit grumpy. After I walk to work, I send a local artist $12 to reserve a spot in a painting workshop two weeks from now. I then spend the morning reading some research papers on gender equity in country Y while waiting for my boss to arrive and give me guidance on the final edits for a report. One of my coworkers brought some food (bread, cookies, fruit, and nuts) to share, so I snack on that throughout the day instead of eating a proper lunch. 

My boss finally provides his guidance in the afternoon, and luckily the changes he wants aren't major, so I'm able to make the edits and leave a bit before 5.¬†I take a taxi ($2.70) to my gym for a group workout with some friends, then taxi home around 7:30 ($3.30). After the workout, I have a quiet Friday night. I order vegetarian sushi and a large seaweed salad for $31, talk to Q for an hour, and finish watching Mare of Easttown. I go to sleep around 11.

**Day Five (Saturday):** I wake up at 9AM and make a cup of tea, which I drink on my balcony while listening to This American Life. I debate going for a walk, but decide to stay home and make bagels instead. A good bagel is a rare commodity on this continent. I haven't made bagels in almost ten years, but they turn out pretty tasty! As I'm waiting for them to proof and bake, I eat my leftover sushi for breakfast and make coffee in¬†my moka pot. I also order more drinking water - the water quality here is good enough for me to cook with, but it's safer to drink bottled water. I order two 20 liter jugs to replace my two empty jugs, which costs $11. The empty jugs are returned to the water company, who will reuse them.

After the bagels are baked and I've eaten one, I head out to buy mimosa¬†ingredients to bring to a friend's brunch tomorrow. I walk about 20 minutes to a grocery store and spend $26 on prosecco, orange juice, and passionfruit juice. I also buy a small bottle of baby shampoo, which I'll use to hand wash some silk shirts, for $4.50. As I'm leaving, I drop by a nearby home goods store. Earlier in the week I'd noticed some gorgeous handmade green bowls that I think Q would like. I buy one for $9.

I walk home, where I eat another bagel and the leftover seaweed salad before going for a 40 minute swim. After cleaning up and¬†eating my third bagel of the day, I decide to make a sweet potato, carrot, and lentil soup to use up some ingredients in my fridge. I eat a bowl of the soup, the rest of my leftover stew, and some chocolate for dinner. Then I do some online shopping for work clothes - a friend is visiting me in a few months and offered up some of her luggage space to bring me things. I buy three shirts from¬†Brooks Brothers for $270.50. I spend the rest of the night reading Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver and scrolling on my phone.

**Day Six (Sunday):** I wake up around 8AM and have another lazy morning putzing¬†around and watering my plants. At noon, I take a taxi ($3) to a friend's for brunch, bringing the bagels I made yesterday and the mimosa ingredients. My friend made egg salad to go on the bagels, a side salad, and dessert. All delicious! We hang out for hours, drinking plenty of mimosas, before I take a taxi home ($2.70).

Once home, I pack for my travel tomorrow - it's a one week trip, so I just pack a carry-on. Around 6, I walk to my neighborhood Indian restaurant and pick up a bunch of veggie samosas for dinner ($7). As I'm eating dinner, my friend texts me to say that a plane heading to country¬†X caught fire this morning. I wonder if it's the same plane I'm supposed to take tomorrow, but no one's messaged me, so I assume it's okay. I talk to Q for an hour and go to sleep a bit early, around 10, since I have an early flight.

**Day Seven (Monday):** I wake¬†up at 4AM and question my life and my choices. The pre-booked taxi picks me up around 4:30, and I arrive at the airport at 5AM, where I run into my coworker who's also travelling to X this morning. He is leaving the airport, because apparently our flight has been cancelled - I guess it's the same plane that caught fire yesterday! Super annoying. I message our admin assistant with the update and ask if she can book me on a flight leaving later that afternoon. Then my coworker and I share a taxi back to our respective homes (he pays, to be reimbursed by work), and I fall back asleep until around 9AM.¬†

When I wake up, I see a message that I've been booked on a new flight leaving at 3PM. I work from home until noon, eat broccoli and two eggs for lunch (about all I have left in my house to eat, since I was trying to finish as much as possible before I travelled), then take a taxi to the airport ($8.50, but will be reimbursed). I buy water and a Snickers at the airport for $5. This flight has no mishaps, thankfully, and I finally arrive at X in the evening, where¬†a taxi picks me up and takes me to my accommodation a short drive away from the airport. I eat dinner of rice,¬†lentil stew,¬†and vegetables, which is included with the accommodation, before heading to my room. I'm feeling a bit sick and exhausted after the weird travel day, so I talk to Q for 45 minutes then go to sleep around 10.

# Reflections

Overall, this represents a fairly average week for me in terms of work, social life, spending, eating, exercise, etc. However, I purchase clothes pretty rarely; I haven't tallied up spending from last year but probably spent under $1.5k total on clothes, and certainly under $2.5k. So a $270 purchase on clothes in one week is quite a bit higher than average.

Anyhow, AMA though I may decline to answer for my privacy :) Despite some fuzzy details, I thought this would interest people as it is a somewhat unusual career field.",11,1736245268.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,3,0.92,False
