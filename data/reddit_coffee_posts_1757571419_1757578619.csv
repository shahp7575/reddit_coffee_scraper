**BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front):**  
I‚Äôm building a small but dedicated team for a unique narrative-driven game. I have a clear concept and design direction, and I‚Äôm looking for motivated teammates to bring it to life.

# ‚òï Game Concept

Our first project is inspired by *Coffee Talk*, but set in a **dark, post-apocalyptic world**:

* **Story:** You play as a barista who volunteers for a deep sleep experiment. After waking up years later, you discover a ruined world filled with mutated, zombie-like survivors.
* **Gameplay:** Serve drinks, listen to stories, and shape character arcs through dialogue and recipes.
* **Atmosphere:** A blend of cozy caf√© vibes and eerie, unsettling moments.
* **Core Features:**
   * Branching dialogue and multiple storylines
   * A drink-making system with unique recipes
   * Choices that influence endings and relationships

# üë• Team Roles Needed

* **Programmers:** Unity or Godot (JavaScript/React/Phaser also welcome)
* **Artists (2D/Pixel/Other styles welcome):** Character portraits, environments, UI design
* **Writers/Narrative Designers:** Dialogue, branching choices, backstories
* **Sound Designers/Composers:** Lo-fi, ambient, dark atmospheric tracks

*(Art direction is flexible ‚Äî could be pixel art or another 2D style depending on the team.)*

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è About Me

I‚Äôm a game designer with some JavaScript and game dev experience. This is a hobby-driven project aimed at learning, experimenting, and creating something meaningful together.

# üìÖ Project Scope

* **Phase 1:** Small prototype/demo (2‚Äì3 months)
* **Phase 2:** Expanded narrative and polished systems (6‚Äì8 months)

# üì¨ Contact

* DM me here on Reddit
* Or reach me on Discord: **kapqae**

1ne30nh,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Automatic_War9820/comments/1ne30nh/knife_shop_in_osaka_good_surprise/,"Knife shop in Osaka, good surprise","I finally went to visit the new DeSakai knife shop on the same street as the Sakai cutlery museum.

(address[ of the new but old shop](https://maps.app.goo.gl/beKkbYDhoXXTKdrJ6))

It's on the sidewalk across from Jikko and not far from Mizuno. When I was there, some staff from the Hado brand and Master Yamatsuka from Takayuki were there! I gathered that the DeSakai forge also makes knives for these big brands in addition to selling directly. I was hesitating between Mizuno and DeSakai, but I went for this Bunka Kiritsuke because it was less expensive for similar quality. I was also disappointed by the Denshokan museum, whose prices were high for the quality... I also wouldn't recommend the Sakai Tohji company; they pretend to be a museum, but it's all industrial... it felt like a scam. I really recommend Mizuno and DeSakai, which was a nice surprise. And also Jikko, because the shop itself is very classy, even if it's a bit pricey.

However, the shop is really small, with limited selection and no air conditioning. I'm torn about buying another one; they had a beautiful damascus petty. The big plus, though, was the coffee shop and garden inside the building, as it was very hot. My wife was getting tired of me dithering. I recommend leaving your family at the cafe to do your shopping if your wife is like mine and isn't interested in knives. It's also not easy to find from the outside... which is a real shame because the products and the experience are otherwise very pleasant. You can tell it's not a big resale brand and that it's still a small workshop.

I recently launched [Nameless Menu](https://namelessmenu.com/), a lightweight SaaS for caf√©s, bars, and restaurants.

**Main Features:**

* QR code for menu ‚Äì guest scans and immediately sees the menu
* QR code for Wi-Fi ‚Äì automatic internet connection
* Built-in Google Translate ‚Äì automatic translation inside the menu
* Choice of 193 languages and 140 currencies
* Ready-made categories like coffees, beers, juices, pizzas, desserts
* Multiple sizes and prices per dish, for example espresso and double espresso
* Banners at the top of the menu to promote dishes or events
* Promotions as pop-ups that appear first when the menu is scanned, with optional timed discounts
* Tool to generate printable PDF menus in any supported language
* Analytics showing menu views and scans
* Staff management with owner control and manager permissions
* Virtual AI assistant that knows the menu and can answer customer questions
* Cloud solution that works 24/7 on all devices

**Who it is for:**  
Hospitality owners who need to update prices frequently, offer multilingual menus for tourists, and want a clean mobile-friendly solution without hiring a developer or paying for a custom website.  
  
**Stage:**  
Bootstrapped and live in production with a few caf√©s already using it. I am now focused on growth.

**What I am looking for:**  
1. How would you promote this product if it was yours  
2. Where would you market it first - partnerships with printers and POS resellers, local outreach, content and SEO, social campaigns, or something else

And if anyone here is strong in marketing and sales and is interested in joining a founder on this journey, I would love to talk. I am a technical founder and spend most of my time building features but want to team up with someone who enjoys growth, outreach, and building relationships.

Bahrain Business Liquidation Timelines, Costs, and Expert Tips for 2025\
\
Alt text: Corporate professionals in a meeting discussing business strategies.). But unlike setting up operations, closing down‚Äîaka liquidation‚Äîcarries its own rhythm, costs, challenges, and, yes, surprising opportunities if you know the right shortcuts.\
Bahrain‚Äôs 2025 Business Landscape: Growth, Change, and New Rules\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern Bahrain business district., Bahrain‚Äôs GDP is expected to grow 3.2% in 2025, backed by non-oil sectors and consistent FDI flows.\
Forbes Business recently highlighted Manama‚Äôs rise as an emerging financial centre, with over 72% of new commercial registrations in the first quarter of 2025 coming from knowledge-based sectors and SMEs.\
However, the Kingdom also introduced updated liquidation regulations under the Commercial Companies Law, with effect from February 1, 2025‚Äîspeeding up some approvals, but also tightening enforcement around outstanding tax, LMRA labour dues, and compliance documentation.\
Surprisingly, while business formation (read more) is arguably one of the fastest in the GCC, the liquidation process still trips up even the most prepared founders‚Äîespecially around government clearances.\
How Long Does Liquidation Actually Take in Bahrain?\
The ‚ÄúOfficial‚Äù Timeline\
\
Simple Voluntary Liquidation: Typically 2-4 months\
Complex or Large Entity: Up to 6-9 months (if real estate or unresolved disputes involved)\
Average in 2025 (per MOICT data): 76 days for voluntary liquidations of standard LLCs\
\
Officially, liquidation starts once shareholders pass a resolution and appoint a liquidator‚Äîtypically an external audit firm or registered agent.\
But here‚Äôs the kicker: the 2-4 month estimate assumes all documents are in order and no objections are raised by regulatory authorities.\
Reality Check: Where Most Delays Occur\
\
Final Tax Clearance by the National Bureau for Revenue (NBR)\
Labour Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA): Ensuring all visas, work permits, and end-of-service benefits are settled\
Bank Account Closure: Requires no-liability letters from key authorities\
Unresolved Shareholder or Creditor Claims\
\
(It once took me nine months to close a company simply because a minor supplier didn‚Äôt respond to the official closure notice. Lesson learned: always over-notify stakeholders well in advance.)\
Step-by-Step: The Business Liquidation Process in Bahrain\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation‚Äîreviewing paperwork in office. for faster notarization\
2. Appointment of Approved Liquidator\
\
Audit firm, legal advisor, or registered agent\
Practical Shortcut: Use a firm with an existing MOICT relationship. They get priority slots in Sijilat (Bahrain‚Äôs digital company registry)\
\
3. Public Notice\
\
Mandatory advertisement in two local newspapers (one Arabic, one English)\
21-day waiting period for any claims or objections\
Insider tip: Book newspapers with digital notice options; Sijilat accepts screenshots for faster compliance.\
\
\
\
4. Clearance from Authorities\
\
Tax (NBR), Customs, LMRA, and Social Insurance Organization (SIO)\
Money-saving tip: Settle all fines and dues before first submission. Over-payments lead to refund delays that can add months.\
\
5. Liquidator‚Äôs Final Report\
\
Inventory, asset sales, creditor settlements, employee compensation\
Document hack: Maintain a preformatted Excel tracker for asset disposal; Sijilat now accepts digital uploads.\
\
6. Final Approval and De-registration\
\
MOICT reviews, then cancels Commercial Registration (CR)\
Retrieve no-liability letters, close bank accounts, and officially de-register\
\
If you‚Äôre closing in a free zone, see Bahrain free zone policies for customs and lease requirements.\
Cost Considerations: What Does Liquidation in Bahrain Really Cost?\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs‚Äîcalculator and business finances.\
- Professional Audit/Legal Fees: BHD 500‚Äì2,000 (depending on complexity)\
- Government Fees & Notices: BHD 150‚Äì300\
- Final Tax/Compliance Clearance: Varies (settle all NBR dues in advance to avoid penalties)\
- Total Budget Range for 2025: BHD 1,100‚Äì3,500 for most SMEs\
- Tip: Always compare services (see Bahrain company formation cost breakdown). And never pay a liquidator full fees upfront‚Äîtie payment milestones to regulatory approvals.\
A common mistake? Underestimating the professional fees and time for final SIO and LMRA exits. I‚Äôve seen clients lose months (and money) because they tried a DIY route without a seasoned liquidator.\
Breakdown by Business Type: How Your Structure Affects Liquidation\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration‚Äîcolleagues discussing in meeting.: Fastest, least complex\
- SPC (Single Person Company): Slightly quicker, as only one shareholder decision needed\
- BSC (Closed Joint Stock): Requires more detailed audit, lengthier public notice\
- Branches/Representative Offices**: Slightly more MOICT scrutiny, but no asset disposal needed\
Pro-tip: The entity structure you pick at setup directly affects your winding-up costs and timeline. And if you‚Äôre a foreign investor, 99% ownership is allowed for most activities‚Äîread more here or see foreigner-friendly activities.\
I once had to dissolve a sleeping SPC for a tech entrepreneur in the Seef District‚Äîthe entire process, including closing bank accounts with National Bank of Bahrain, took just 38 days. Why? Only one active signatory, clean accounts, and no LMRA issues.\
Important 2025 Regulatory Changes\
Since February 2025, the MOICT has digitized much of the public notice and claim handling process under Sijilat reforms (official updates on Bahrain.com).\
- Faster online submission of board resolutions and notices\
- Mandatory Digital Assets Audit for tech and eCommerce businesses\
- Shorter statutory notice period (now 21 days, down from 30)\
But enforcement around employee claims and tax compliance is tighter. The NBR now issues ‚Äúno dues‚Äù letters only after uploading all tax filings online‚Äîa change that added four days to my last closure!\
Compliance and Documentation in Business Closure\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation‚Äîsigning legal paperwork., and use Sijilat‚Äôs batch upload feature to avoid repeated trips\
For professional help, I recommend using KeyLink‚Äôs accounting and bookkeeping services if you want compliance headaches handled by experts. They know the quirks of local authorities intimately.\
A mistake I see? Entrepreneurs forgetting about old, ‚Äúdormant‚Äù CR numbers. Always search Sijilat for any historic registrations (I once fixed a three-year delay from a CR the founder forgot existed!).\
Support, Resources, and Insider Strategies\
\
Alt text: Professional business support‚Äîconsultant meeting business clients. beats Diplomatic Area queues\
- Document preparation: Use Tamkeen templates, MOICT e-forms, and always bring both Arabic and English copies (learned the hard way at Bahrain Bay branch‚Äîpro tip: some clerks prefer English but need Arabic for signatures!)\
- Timing: Avoid end of quarters and Eid periods‚Äîmanager approvals slow down, especially for public-sector clearances\
A tangent: I once delayed a closure because the majlis coffee ran long‚Äîthe client insisted on discussing the closure ‚Äòthe Bahraini way‚Äô. Moments like this highlight the value of local relationship-building (never underestimate a majlis network during title deed transfers or regulatory queries).\
Bahrain vs. UAE & Saudi Liquidation Practices\
Compared to the UAE (especially Dubai), Bahrain offers:\
- Lower liquidation costs for SMEs\
- Shorter government notice periods\
- More ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù service at MOICT (walk-in clarifications are welcome)\
- Less dependency on local sponsors (see local sponsorship in Bahrain), especially for 99% foreign-owned entities\
Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, is known for heavier documentation and longer lead-times, especially for Iqama and GOSI clearance.\

Pro Tips to Save Time and Money\
\
Pre-clear all dues with the NBR and LMRA before liquidator appointment\
Use a registered formation partner with Sijilat e-access\
Double-notify all suppliers and partners (email + WhatsApp) to prevent objection period delays\
Visit Seef District MOICT office before 10:30 am; ask for bilingual forms to prevent translation hiccups\
Maintain ‚Äúliquidation-ready‚Äù accounts from day one‚ÄîKeyLink‚Äôs accounting services are a lifesaver here\
Allocate at least 20% of your winding-up budget to unexpected legal and staff settlements\
\
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\
Q1: What happens if there are outstanding debts or disputes when I try to liquidate?\
Disputes or creditor claims can pause the entire process. The liquidator must attempt to resolve them before final MOICT approval. Pro-tip: Settle all known debts and over-communicate with creditors before issuing the public closure notice. Learn about ownership and dispute handling in Bahrain company structures.\
Q2: Can I liquidate my Bahrain company 100% online in 2025?\
Many steps, including notice and document uploads, are now digital via Sijilat. However, final bank account closure, MOICT stamping, and some tax clearances still require physical signatures. Using a professional agent or formation service will minimize office visits.\
Q3: How does liquidation affect visas and work permits for my employees?\
LMRA clearance is mandatory. All permits are cancelled and final salary/benefits must be paid. For foreign-owned companies, see the 100% foreign ownership guide for HR best practice.\
Q4: Are there faster options if my company is dormant or has never traded?\
Yes‚Äîdormant entities with zero liabilities and no employees can sometimes be deregistered in under 45 days, especially if no tax filings are due. Always confirm with a Bahrain business formation specialist.\
Q5: Should I use a local sponsor, or can I liquidate with 99% foreign ownership?\
For most activities, no local sponsor is required; Bahrain allows up to 99% foreign ownership in liquidation (details here). Branches of foreign companies may require parent company approval for closure.\
\
The real secret? Relationships matter. A well-timed majlis coffee, a shortcut with Sijilat e-forms, and expert local support can make company liquidation in Bahrain faster, cheaper, and‚Äîa bit more pleasant.

Whether you‚Äôre strolling along the Seine, marveling at the Eiffel Tower, or losing yourself in the art-filled halls of the Louvre, the magic of Paris is undeniable. But one question lingers in every traveler‚Äôs mind before booking a ticket: *When is the best time to visit Paris?*

The truth is, Paris shines year-round, but each season offers a distinct experience. From the blooming gardens of spring to the festive lights of winter, the ideal time depends on what you‚Äôre looking for‚Äîromance, culture, festivals, or fewer crowds. Let‚Äôs explore Paris season by season to help you decide.

# Spring in Paris (March to May) ‚Äì Romance in Full Bloom

Spring is arguably the most romantic time to visit Paris. As winter fades, the city comes alive with flowers, greenery, and soft sunlight that makes every corner Instagram-worthy.

# Highlights:

* **Cherry Blossoms & Gardens:** From Parc de Sceaux to Jardin du Luxembourg, Paris is painted with pink and white blossoms. It‚Äôs like walking through a Monet painting.
* **Pleasant Weather:** Temperatures range from 10¬∞C to 17¬∞C, perfect for outdoor picnics and caf√© hopping.
* **Cultural Buzz:** Spring kicks off Paris‚Äôs cultural season, with art exhibitions, concerts, and theater shows.

# Why Visit in Spring?

If you dream of sipping coffee at a sidewalk caf√© while watching Parisians go about their day, spring is ideal. It‚Äôs warm enough for long walks along the Seine but not overly crowded like summer.

**Best Events:**

* **Printemps du Cin√©ma (March):** Discounted cinema tickets across Paris.
* **Nuit des Mus√©es (May):** Museums open late into the night, often free of charge.

# Summer in Paris (June to August) ‚Äì Festivities and Sunshine

Summer in Paris means long days, lively streets, and an irresistible buzz. The city is in full swing with festivals, open-air concerts, and bustling terraces.

# Highlights:

* **Extended Daylight:** Sunsets as late as 10 p.m. allow more time for sightseeing.
* **Outdoor Fun:** Seine cruises, rooftop bars, and the famous Paris Plages, where artificial beaches are set up along the riverbanks.
* **Festival Fever:** Summer is packed with cultural events from music festivals to Bastille Day celebrations.

# Why Visit in Summer?

This is the time to experience Paris at its liveliest. Parks are full of picnickers, caf√©s spill out onto the sidewalks, and the air buzzes with joy. However, it‚Äôs also the busiest season, with higher hotel prices and larger crowds at attractions.

# Autumn in Paris (September to November) ‚Äì A Painter‚Äôs Palette

If spring is about blossoms, autumn is about golden leaves and cozy vibes. Paris in autumn feels like stepping into an impressionist painting, with tree-lined boulevards glowing in shades of orange and red.

# Highlights:

* **Mild Weather:** Temperatures average between 8¬∞C and 15¬∞C, perfect for layering and stylish outfits.
* **Fewer Crowds:** Tourist numbers dip after summer, making it easier to explore landmarks like the Eiffel Tower or Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay.
* **Gastronomic Delights:** Autumn is wine harvest season, and Paris restaurants showcase seasonal delicacies like mushrooms, chestnuts, and game.

# Why Visit in Autumn?

This is the best time for art lovers and romantics. The city slows down, yet cultural events pick up, offering a balanced Parisian experience. Plus, the soft autumn light is a photographer‚Äôs dream.

**Best Events:**

* **Nuit Blanche (October):** All-night contemporary art installations across Paris.
* **Beaujolais Nouveau Day (November):** Celebrates the year‚Äôs first wine release with tastings.

# Winter in Paris (December to February) ‚Äì A Festive Wonderland

Winter transforms Paris into a fairy-tale city. With twinkling lights, holiday markets, and cozy caf√©s, the cold months carry a unique charm.

# Highlights:

* **Holiday Spirit:** Streets are illuminated, and Christmas markets sell mulled wine, roasted chestnuts, and artisanal gifts.
* **Lower Costs:** Winter (excluding Christmas and New Year) is the cheapest time for flights and accommodation.
* **Cultural Warmth:** Museums and theaters offer warmth and world-class entertainment.

# Why Visit in Winter?

If you don‚Äôt mind chilly weather (2¬∞C to 7¬∞C), winter is a magical time to explore Paris without the overwhelming tourist rush. It‚Äôs also perfect for indulging in hot chocolate at Angelina‚Äôs or skating in front of H√¥tel de Ville.

**Best Events:**

* **Christmas Markets (December):** Especially at Champs-√âlys√©es and Tuileries Garden.
* **Paris Fashion Week (January):** A global spectacle for style enthusiasts.

* **June‚ÄìAugust:** Perfect for festivals, nightlife, and long sightseeing days.
* **September‚ÄìNovember:** Ideal for foodies, photographers, and art lovers.
* **December‚ÄìFebruary:** Great for budget travelers and those who love holiday magic.

# Tips for Choosing Your Best Time

1. **For Budget Travelers:** Winter and late autumn offer the best deals.
2. **For Avoiding Crowds:** Visit in March, April, or late September.
3. **For Families:** Summer offers the most activities, but spring is calmer and child-friendly.

# Conclusion

So, when is the best time to visit Paris? The answer depends on your preferences. If you crave romance and blossoms, spring is your season. If you‚Äôre after lively festivals and long sunny days, summer is unbeatable. For golden landscapes and a slower pace, autumn is your best bet. And if you dream of twinkling lights and cozy caf√©s, winter will charm you endlessly.

Ultimately, Paris is not just a destination‚Äîit‚Äôs a feeling, one that welcomes travelers year-round. No matter when you go, the city has a way of leaving you enchanted, whispering that you‚Äôll return again.",1,1757576856.0,u_jyotishah1229,0,1.0,False

Silence, after that.

Not peace. The silence of a room after a body has been carried out.

The pod‚Äôs systems woke in fits and starts, coughing lights into life. A soft blue wash painted their faces. The black on the other side of the glass was honest space again‚Äîstars with edges, no syrup in the light, no second shadows.

Anika let out a sound that might have been a sob or a laugh and immediately choked on it. Her ribs hurt. Her throat hurt. Her hands would not stop shaking. Renn pressed his forehead gently to hers, the harness cutting into both their shoulders.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre out,‚Äù he said, as if the words could carve a circle of truth around them. ‚ÄúWe did it.‚Äù

She took inventory the way she‚Äôd been trained: breath, bleeding, consciousness. His pulse under her fingers‚Äîfast, off-beat, but there. Her own‚Äîragged. Pain in a dozen registers. Alive.

The pod‚Äôs med readouts blinked to life, stuttering. RIB FRACTURES (4), LACERATION (NECK, MINOR), BURN (FOREARM, 2ND DEGREE). Renn‚Äôs panel flashed NEURO STRESS‚ÄîELEVATED, and something else it did not have a name for: a schematic of spirals along his wrists and throat, the monitor confused enough to brand them as foreign bodies before giving up and calling them unknown artifact.

Renn laughed softly when he saw it. ‚ÄúI always wanted a tattoo.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt joke,‚Äù she said, and squeezed his hand. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not safe.‚Äù

He looked past her, out at the clean stars. ‚ÄúSafer than we were.‚Äù

She could not argue.

They worked because working was the only ward against thinking. Anika taped his forearms, cleaned the blister weals where cable had kissed skin, bound the cut at his throat with gauze torn into neat strips. He patched her ribs as best he could, his hands steady now, the song quiet enough to let him be a person again.

They spoke in small voices, not to wake anything.

‚ÄúWhat about Elara?‚Äù he asked, eventually.

‚ÄúShe bought us time,‚Äù Anika said. The sentence swelled in her until it hurt. ‚ÄúSo did Marrek.‚Äù

Renn nodded, tears he did not brush away sliding into his hairline. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll remember them.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúEvery day. I‚Äôll remember.‚Äù

They drifted.

The pod‚Äôs engines had one burst left in them‚Äîa narrow cone of thrust like a final breath. Renn angled them on star-sense and instinct, the way he‚Äôd angled ships since he was a boy, lights outside the window pretending to be a map. He didn‚Äôt hum. He didn‚Äôt have to. The numbers sat quiet in him like cooling metal.

They fired the burn. The pod nudged toward known space.

Hours later‚Äîor minutes; no clocks felt honest yet‚ÄîAnika slept. She folded into the harness like a child into a well-worn coat, mouth open, breath harsh but deepening. She had bandaged Renn‚Äôs wrists; in sleep, her hand remained stubbornly over his heart.

Renn did not sleep.

He watched the stars and saw, sometimes, a second set behind them: faint ghost constellations drawn in spirals. When he blinked, they went away. When he stopped blinking, they returned.

His chartbook lay jammed beneath the footwell. He didn‚Äôt take it out. He didn‚Äôt need to. The pages might still glow; he was not sure. His skin did. The spirals along his veins pulsed, almost nothing, like a whisper you could pretend you‚Äôd imagined.

He leaned his head back and let the pod‚Äôs fans hush him. He thought of Elara‚Äôs face at the glass, of Marrek‚Äôs laugh cracking on the comm, of Jax stepping forward like a man choosing a dance. He thought of Solenne‚Äôs note pinned with a scalpel. He thought of the way Anika had kissed him like a vow she didn‚Äôt believe in but would keep anyway.

He hummed once‚Äîquiet, a single line. The pod‚Äôs instruments answered, a flicker across an otherwise steady board. He stopped. The lights steadied too.

‚ÄúNot today,‚Äù he said to the part of him that listened. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get today.‚Äù

The part of him that listened smiled like a patient god and waited.

Anika stirred, eyes slitting open. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awake,‚Äù she mumbled, tasting copper even in dreams.

‚ÄúGo back to sleep,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here.‚Äù

She closed her eyes and believed him. In this small space, at this small hour, belief was not a lie; it was a blanket.

Sometime later, a beacon found them‚Äîthe thin cry of a patrol skiff sweeping the shipping lanes near the rift. The pod‚Äôs transmitter latched like a hand to a hand. Coordinates traded. Trajectory plotted. Rescue promised.

Anika wept without sound, the relief so sharp it felt like hurt. She pressed her forehead to Renn‚Äôs again and laughed through tears. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going home.‚Äù

‚ÄúHome,‚Äù he said, tasting the word. It felt new. It felt like something that could be written.

The skiff arrived with its lights an honest white, no syrup in them, no hymns. Docking clamps embraced the pod. The hatch cycled with a hiss that was only air, not breath.

The rescuers‚Äô faces were ordinary with worry and amazement. They spoke questions that would require years to answer. Hands reached in, warm, human, smelling of uniforms and coffee.

Anika stumbled into those hands and turned back, tugging Renn after her.

He hesitated, a stutter less than a heartbeat, looking past them into the dark. The rift lay far behind now, only a bruise on the starfield‚Äîbut it would never be far again. He could feel it, a second pulse threaded under his human one.

Anika‚Äôs fingers tightened. He stepped forward.

They were wrapped in blankets, given water sweet with electrolytes that tasted like a new planet. Names were asked; names were given. The skiff‚Äôs medic knelt in front of Anika and smiled in the kind way that hurts. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre safe,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou made it.‚Äù

Anika‚Äôs eyes filled. ‚ÄúWe did,‚Äù she said, and believed it.

Across from her, Renn sat very still. The ship‚Äôs lights traced the spirals faint on his skin, the glow so soft only he felt it. He lifted his cup and, without meaning to, whispered a number into the rim. The water trembled, just once, like it had heard.

He glanced at Anika. She caught his eye and smiled, exhausted and bright.

He smiled back, the kind that makes a promise without saying which kind.

Outside the porthole, the stars returned to their old shapes. Somewhere, far and near, a cathedral of bone and black stone folded its jaws and resumed its patient hymn. The universe breathed.

In a quiet corner of a small skiff, two survivors held hands. One truly lived. The other carried a song.

And in the hush between their heartbeats, if you listened closely, you could hear a single line, gentle as a lullaby and sharp as a blade:

1ne2od7,https://www.reddit.com/r/MayConfessionAko/comments/1ne2od7/mca_a_girl_back_in_highschool_dedicated_a_song_to/,MCA A girl back in highschool dedicated a song to me and parang naging trauma dump niya ko.,"The girl I was courting way back in high school dedicated Thunder by Boys Like Girls to me. SHS came, and we parted ways. It didn't end well. Another guy entertained him back then, thinking I was the one who was attached to another girl.

Years later, we remained friends and have civil contact with each other. Surprisingly, we ended up studying in the same University, but I was ahead for 1 year because she stopped. Our casual conversation started again. Bilang sa kamay na sinabayan niya ko pauwi, and ako rin sumabay sa kanya for a few times. 

3rd year college na ko. One night, 1am-ish, she messaged me if she could crash at our place for the night. Hesitant ako kasi di ko alam sasabihin sa parents ko. I told her I'll meet her kung nasaan siya. Pumayag parents ko na lumabas ako that time. 

Nagkita kami. Build-up convo for a bit. Walked to a different place, a coffee shop alongside the service road lang. That time, my emotions lit up, reminiscing about what we had in high school.

Then I bluntly asked her ""pero anong problem, bakit di ka umuwi?""

She froze. Parang ayaw niya talaga pag-usapan.

With her shaking voice she said *""Naalala mo yung nagsusundo sa'kin sa babaan lagi pag uwian?""* I said, *""Ah oo, yung naka motor.""*  nag pause siya a bit.

Long story short, buntis siya and hindi niya alam kung itutuloy or abort. I was stunned. I never expected the situation. 

The dilemma is **(1)** gusto niya ipa-abort to continue college, di pa ready to sa parenthood. **(2)** ayaw ni guy, nagsabi na mag s\*\*\*\*de if ipapa-abort ang baby.

I didn't give her my side. I just let her vent everything to lighten the burden. Slowly, the sun rises, and we decided to call it a day. We parted ways, and I told her I could help her in any way I could. That was the last time we spoke with one another.

One random weekday, I saw her post that she had given birth. I was relieved that she didn't choose to abort the baby. I didn't message her. I'm content that I'm happy with her decision.

A year later, I graduated. Immediately looked for a job and thankfully landed one. I received a message from her to attend sa binyag, but sadly, di ako nakapunta kasi may work ako and it's on a weekday. 

  
I heard this song again last Monday and just realized that I was a one-call away for her. Every time she's going through something, I offer myself up to her. I wasn't hurt na hindi ako yung naging tatay ng anak niya, but there's just this faint memory from high school that I dreamt of us raising a child together pero ako lang yon. I didn't dream it with her.

  
I don't hold anything against her. I just remembered it and felt like venting it here.

I watch them for a few moments.

Right.. Left.. Right.. Left

I hum a tune to go along with the subtle squeak.

It‚Äôs mindless, but it helps me forget I have to be at work in 5 min-

I glance at the clock on the dash.

‚ÄúShit.‚Äù, I mutter, grabbing my purse and opening the door of my sedan.

I walk briskly to the front door of the diner and swing it open, the warmth inside immediately heating my skin as I shake out my hair.

‚ÄúCamilla, you‚Äôre late.‚Äù, Jeff calls from behind the counter, pouring coffee into a mug.

‚ÄúBy two minutes, sorry. I was here, I zoned out in my car..‚Äù, I say, rounding the edge to the kitchen to put my things down.

‚ÄúWell then you can stay two minutes later, wouldn‚Äôt want your time card off.‚Äù, he says, with a grin.

‚ÄúOh, yeah. I‚Äôm sure.‚Äù, I chuckle, grabbing some menus and beginning to wipe them down.

‚ÄúOkay, but did I sound authoritative?‚Äù, he asks. Ever since his promotion from cook to manager, he has been self-conscious about his new role.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting better!‚Äù, I say enthusiastically.

I‚Äôve been at the diner longer than he has, but I have no interest in becoming a manager.

I tell myself to take a deep breath. I am almost done with my degree and then I can finally get a job in my field of study. I check job listings every day, hoping a spot for a school psychologist opens up soon.

Somewhere.

Anywhere.

‚ÄúDaydreaming?‚Äù, he teases.

I snap out of it, shaking my head while I restart the coffee pot.

As soon as he finishes his closing work, he‚Äôs grabbing his coat to head out.

‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôm headed out. Do you need anything from me before I go home?‚Äù, he asks me.

‚ÄúNope! Have a good night, and get home safely.‚Äù, I respond, looking up from wiping down the counter in front of me.

He stays still for a beat, and then taps the counter twice with his knuckles.

‚ÄúAlrighty. See ya, Cams.‚Äù, he says, waving at the last customer at the counter before heading outside.

The second the bell chimes above the door, I sigh.

I wish I didn‚Äôt find him so handsome. Oh well, soon I will be gone anyways. No point saying anything to him now.

‚ÄúAnything else I can get you, sir?‚Äù, I ask the man at the counter.

The man shakes his head and smiles at me warmly.

‚ÄúNah darlin‚Äô, I‚Äôm just finishing up here and then I‚Äôm headed out. Got a bit more of a drive to San Diego.‚Äù, he tells me, stretching his arms back.

Truckers are our main customers this late at night.

Especially on this road, the path from Arizona to California. Not a whole lot out here besides us, and a few gas stations.

I nod sympathetically.

‚ÄúLet me get you some coffee to take with you.‚Äù, I offer, grabbing a travel cup from below the counter and filling it to the brim.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a sweet girl..‚Äù, he squints at my name tag, ‚ÄúCamilla. Pretty name.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you.. Though I can‚Äôt take credit for it.‚Äù, I say, laughing lightly.

‚ÄúNow, what do I owe you for the to-go cup?‚Äù, he says, reaching for his wallet.

I wave him off.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs on me, you can pay me back by making it there safe.‚Äù, I smile.

He laughs, and takes the cup.

‚ÄúThat other guy left, are you all alone darlin‚Äô?‚Äù, he asks, looking around the now empty diner.

I nod.

‚ÄúFor now, Tony will be here in about five minutes.‚Äù, I say with an easy smile.

What this man doesn‚Äôt know, is that there is no Tony, and I will be here alone tonight. Jeff told me to always say someone named Tony is coming soon, just to keep weirdos in check. I‚Äôve never asked why, but I have never had an issue, anytime someone asks me something like that I always say Tony will be here.. Tony‚Äôs almost here.. Tony is a retired cop..

Sometimes, I even make up elaborate backstories about him.

‚ÄúTony isn‚Äôt a name you try to mess with.‚Äù, Jeff had told me.

And he was right.

The man sighs in relief.

‚ÄúOh good, you know my niece is about your age and I would get nervous about her being out here by herself. Do you want me to wait with you?‚Äù, he asks.

He seems kind, and I don‚Äôt feel threatened, but I‚Äôm still not stupid.

‚ÄúOh you‚Äôre so sweet, but I promise I‚Äôm okay. Better get on the road before your coffee gets cold.‚Äù, I say, clearing his dishes.

He laughs again.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right about that. Okay, you have a good night darlin‚Äô.‚Äù, he tells me, tipping the brim of his hat.

I smile back at him, and watch as he leaves the diner and gets in his truck.

I don‚Äôt stop watching until the headlights blink out in the distance.

I turn to put some clean mugs away, and I see Jeff‚Äôs phone, still plugged in and charging on the counter.

‚ÄúJeff‚Ä¶‚Äù, I sigh.

I swear that man would forget his own head if it wasn‚Äôt attached to his shoulders.

I laugh softly, and begin to wipe down every table, then I bring all the ketchup bottles to the counter to work on refilling them.

Then the ketchup makes me think of fries, and now I‚Äôm hungry.

‚ÄúEarly dinner break, sorry Jeff.‚Äù, I giggle, as I head back to the kitchen.

I put some fries in the fryer and lean back on the wall, waiting for the timer.

I close my eyes, and imagine my first day at a school working with kids. 

And in my mind, I‚Äôm so talented I win every education award a school psychologist can get.

I‚Äôm so good, they erect a statue in my honor.

BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ

I open my eyes and see my fries are done.

Ah, that was a nice dream. For now though, the fries will do.

I shake them into a basket, and take the basket with me to the front to continue cleaning.

As I round the corner, someone is sitting at the counter.

‚ÄúAh!‚Äù, I shriek.

The girl looks up at me, and attempts a smile.

She‚Äôs about my age, and she has her red hair in a high ponytail. A loose white T-shirt and a thin hoodie over it, raindrops having left dark spots on her clothes.

‚ÄúHi there! I‚Äôm so sorry, I didn‚Äôt hear you come in.‚Äù, I squeak out.

Her face is impassive.

‚ÄúSorry, I didn‚Äôt mean to startle you.‚Äù, she says.

‚ÄúNo, my bad! Would you like a menu?‚Äù, I ask.

She tilts her head at me, and nods.

I slide her a menu and grab a mug.

‚ÄúCan I get you something warm to drink? I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre cold from the rain.‚Äù, I say, pouring the steaming coffee.

She looks down at the menu, analyzing every line. I see her eyes dart over each item, like she‚Äôs ticking them off in her head.

‚ÄúJust coffee for now.‚Äù, she says quietly.

I nod, and gesture back to the ketchup bottles.

‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôll be over here if you change your mind.‚Äù, I tell her.

‚ÄúThank you, Camilla.‚Äù, she responds.

I glance down at my name tag again and smile at her.

‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù

I pick up a French fry from the basket to take a bite, when she speaks again.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Madison, by the way.‚Äù, she tells me.

I smile at her.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to meet you, Madison.‚Äù

For a while we just coexist together, listening to the premade playlist of slow 90‚Äôs country to fill the silence.

She doesn‚Äôt drink her coffee, but I do see her holding the mug. Like she‚Äôs trying to just warm up her hands.

Then the rain starts coming down harder, ricocheting off the roof in a rattling noise.

‚ÄúIt sure is coming down tonight..‚Äù, I mumble.

‚ÄúIt is.‚Äù, Madison says, eyes finding me.

‚ÄúYou from around here, or passing through?‚Äù, I ask, stepping towards her.

‚ÄúPassing through, I grew up far from here..‚Äù, she trails off, looking outside at the rain.

‚ÄúAh, okay. Where are you headed?‚Äù, I ask.

Her expression tightens, and she looks down at the mug.

I‚Äôve clearly made her uncomfortable.

‚ÄúSorry, you don‚Äôt have to tell me. The truckers come in and just want to talk and talk so I forgot to put my manners on. Please forgive me.‚Äù, I say quickly, looking at her apologetically.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, you didn‚Äôt make me uncomfortable. I‚Äôm just not sure how to answer where I‚Äôm headed‚Ä¶‚Äù, she says quietly.

I regard her for a moment.

Maybe she‚Äôs running away from something?

Her sleeve of her hoodie shifts and I can see a sliver of her wrist, which appears to have a healing bruise on it. Once she sees me notice, she self-consciously tugs it down as I avert my eyes. 

Someone?

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay. Any way is the right way if you don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre going.‚Äù, I say.

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that from Alice in Wonderland?‚Äù, she asks.

I shrug.

‚ÄúMaybe, I read it in a fortune cookie once.‚Äù, I respond.

She‚Äôs quiet for a moment, and then bursts out in giggles. Which then makes me start to laugh.

I look at her again, and I can‚Äôt put my finger on it, but I know I have seen her before.

‚ÄúHave you come here before? Or do you go to school nearby?‚Äù, I ask, hoping to come off as casually as I can.

‚ÄúOh.. No. I don‚Äôt go to school. I have been here before, but I don‚Äôt normally come inside.‚Äù, she responds, still weening off her giggles.

I tilt my head at her.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt come inside?‚Äù, I ask.

Her expression freezes, and her eyes widen.

‚ÄúI.. Uh.. I have been here before, with someone. But normally they get takeout, so I‚Äôve just waited in the car..‚Äù, she says slowly, like she‚Äôs choosing each word carefully.

She looks up at me, waiting for my response.

It‚Äôs not my business, so I nod.

‚ÄúThat makes sense.‚Äù, I say thoughtfully.

She seems to sigh in relief, then I hear a noise. Something faint, and rumbling. When the noise starts, she puts her hand over her stomach and winces, just slightly.

‚ÄúAre you sure I can‚Äôt get you something to eat?‚Äù, I ask.

‚ÄúUm.. What can this get me?‚Äù, she asks, pulling out a crumpled $5 from her hoodie pocket.

I look at the money, then back at her.

‚ÄúAnd I got the coffee, so.. minus that.‚Äù, she whispers.

I can feel my heart fill with concern for this poor girl, and I have to help her.

‚ÄúDo you like burgers?‚Äù, I ask.

She regards me carefully, then nods.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù, I say, then head to the kitchen.

‚ÄúWait- Please don‚Äôt leave me alone-‚Äú, she panics, looking at the door.

I follow her eyes, and slowly head to the glass door. Locking it, and pulling the blinds down.

‚ÄúCome back with me, you can help.‚Äù, I say, holding out my hand to her.

She stares at my hand, and then shakily takes it.

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù, she whispers.

When we get back into the kitchen, her eyes light up at the options of food.

‚ÄúFries?‚Äù, I ask, opening the door to the freezer.

She nods excitedly.

I shake some into the fryer basket and drop it in.

‚ÄúOkay, now the burgers. I think they are the best thing on the menu, if I‚Äôm being honest.‚Äù, I explain, and her eyes watch my every movement.

‚ÄúSo the grill is on, and it‚Äôs hot, so we just place the patty down. Do you want to try?‚Äù, I ask.

She nods and steps closer.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got this!‚Äù, I say reassuringly.

She places the patty down perfectly, but when the grease sizzles and pops up, she jumps back and screams.

She backs up to the wall and tucks her arms around herself, shaking and whispering.

‚ÄúWoah! Hey, are you okay? Did the oil get you?‚Äù, I rush over, gently touching her arm.

She‚Äôs clutching her arm as tears begin to fall down her face, she rocks back and forth and is sobbing quietly.

‚ÄúHere, let me see. I can clean it.‚Äù, I say gently.

She lets me take her arm, and when I gently push up the sleeve, there is a burn alright.

But this one didn‚Äôt just happen.

And it wasn‚Äôt just some sprayed oil from a grill.

The burn wrapped around her arm, looking healed but.. awful.

I gasp softly.

‚ÄúWhat.. What is-‚Äú, I whisper.

Just then, I hear the front door shaking with someone banging on it.

BANG BANG BANG

Both our faces turn in that direction, and Madison begins to whimper before she puts her hand over her mouth.

‚ÄúIs someone after you?‚Äù, I ask her.

BANG BANG BANG

She nods, tears running down her hands to her shirt.

‚ÄúPlease help me.‚Äù, she whispers.

I take her in. The fearful expression, the panic attack, the burn..

BANG BANG BANG

I have to help her.

‚ÄúOkay, get in here.‚Äù, I hurry her to the door of the walk-in fridge and push her in.

BANG BANG BANG

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come out unless I tell you to.‚Äù, I say quickly, before closing it.

I quickly turn off the grill and fryer, and jog to the front door, before opening it fully.

‚ÄúHi there! Sorry about that, I was working on the dishes and didn‚Äôt hear anyone.‚Äù, I say in my best charming waitress voice.

The man waiting for me on the other end of the door is straight from a horror movie.

He wasn‚Äôt very tall, but he was stocky. Dark hair plastered his forehead and arms, and he was drenched from the rain.

His eyes.. His eyes though.. 

They looked at me like they knew all my secrets.

And he did look familiar. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve waited on him directly, but he‚Äôs definitely been here before.

‚ÄúCome on in and get yourself dry, can I get you something warm to drink?‚Äù, I ask as casually as I can.

He watches me cross behind the counter before he takes a step inside the diner.

‚ÄúCoffee.‚Äù, is the only word he grunts.

‚ÄúYou got it.‚Äù, I say, grabbing a mug and pouring it to the top.

‚ÄúCream or sugar?‚Äù, I ask.

He shakes his head.

‚ÄúCan I get you a menu?‚Äù, I ask.

‚ÄúHas anyone else come in here tonight?‚Äù, he asks me.

I pause, and tilt my head like I‚Äôm thinking really hard.

‚ÄúA trucker headed to San Diego, left a while ago. You mean him?‚Äù, I ask him.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for a girl. Young, red hair. You seen her?‚Äù, he asks me.

I shake my head slowly, wiping down the counter he‚Äôs sitting at.

‚ÄúNo, I wish. There are too many men who come through here, I would love someone to gossip with!‚Äù, and I laugh like I‚Äôm the biggest air-head in the world.

He watches me, carefully.

I just continue on with my regular nightly tasks, trying not to think about the girl in the walk-in.

‚ÄúYou all alone here?‚Äù, he finally asks.

I nod while brewing more coffee.

‚ÄúFor now, Tony will be here in a few minutes though. He had a boxing match tonight, so he couldn‚Äôt come in until after.‚Äù, I ramble.

Tony has quite the backstory.

The man studies me, like he‚Äôs trying to figure out if I‚Äôm lying.

Shit.

‚ÄúYou hungry?‚Äù, I ask, glancing at the menu I left in front of him.

He shakes his head.

‚ÄúAlright, well let me know if you need any-‚Äú, I start to say.

‚ÄúWhere is she?‚Äù, he interrupts.

I look at him with my best confused expression.

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù, I ask innocently.

‚ÄúMadison.‚Äù, he huffs.

I try to keep my face neutral.

‚ÄúI told you, I don‚Äôt know who-‚Äú

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt lie to me, GIRL.‚Äù, he shouts the last word, leaning over the counter and trying to grab my apron.

I step back and start to panic.

‚ÄúNo one has-‚Äú

‚ÄúI know she came here, or she‚Äôs still here. This is the only place she knows.‚Äù, he seethes, putting both his hands on the counter like he‚Äôs going to jump over it.

‚ÄúOkay, just calm down. She was here, okay? About an hour ago, and she left. She left and headed West..‚Äù, I say, shakily pointing my hand in the general direction.

He glares at me.

I think quickly, and continue.

‚ÄúShe asked me not to tell anyone she was here, she gave me cash. Okay?‚Äù, I say quickly.

‚ÄúHuh..‚Äù, he says, getting up and crossing across the diner to look out the window.

I can feel my heartbeat in my ears.

‚ÄúWell.. if my Madison is gone..‚Äù, he begins, and I feel my shoulders begin to relax.

‚ÄúYes, she‚Äôs gone. I‚Äôm sorry-‚Äú

‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll have to take you instead.‚Äù, he says, as he turns at the counter to corner me behind it.

My heart stops.

‚ÄúNo, please..‚Äù, I say, beginning to inch towards the kitchen.

The man lunges at me, and I shriek, picking up a metal platter to defend myself with.

He makes it to me in about a second and snatches the platter out of my hands, the metal banging against the linoleum in a horrible sound.

I scream as he grabs my arm.

‚ÄúStop.‚Äù, a soft voice sounds from the kitchen.

We both look up to see Madison, standing in the kitchen doorway. She‚Äôs shaking, and wringing her hands, and I can see how red her eyes are.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm here, I‚Äôm sorry. Take me, but leave her. She was only trying to help me.‚Äù, she whispers, looking at the man and not me.

The man looks between us for a moment, his eyes filled with fire, and hate.

Then slowly, his crude mouth forms a disgusting grin.

‚ÄúWhy have one, when I can have both?‚Äù, he sneers.

I pick up a metal napkin holder and whack him on the head as hard as I can, which sends him staggering back.

‚ÄúRun!‚Äù, I shout as I grab Madison‚Äôs arm and we run past him around the bend in the counter.

‚ÄúYou.. Agh!‚Äù, he shouts as he leaps over the counter, blocking our path.

Madison and I hold each other as we back up, I‚Äôm crying and she‚Äôs staying strong, but I can feel her trembling.

‚ÄúHow nice Madison.. You found a friend. A first for you. Seeing how not a single person has looked for you since I took you to live with me..‚Äù, he huffs, laughing darkly.

‚ÄúPlease‚Ä¶‚Äù, she pleads.

As he backs us up away from the door, I see all my dreams start to disappear.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll never be able to help anyone..‚Äù, I whisper to myself.

Madison glances sideways at me, and squeezes my hand.

‚ÄúYou helped me.‚Äù, she whispers back.

I turn to look at her, and I hear a bell.

‚ÄúHey Cams, I forgot my- What the hell?‚Äù

All 3 of us turn to the door, to see Jeff standing in the doorway.

It takes Jeff a second, his eyes dart from me and Madison, to the man. 

‚ÄúCami-‚Äú, he starts.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to take us!‚Äù, I shriek.

The man turns to face Jeff and begins to barrel towards him.

And it happens so fast.

One second, the guy has his hands outreached to Jeff‚Äôs throat.

The next, Jeff reaches into his jacket, pulling out something black, just as the man tackles him to the ground.

Madison and I are screaming when a shot rings out, echoing through the diner.

I scream in horror, as I run over to the crumpled pile of men.

‚ÄúJeff? Jeff!‚Äù, I cry out.

No one moves for a second, and then the man begins to shift.

‚ÄúOh my god.‚Äù, I whisper.

The man shifts, and falls off of Jeff, rolling onto his back. His cruel eyes, staring up at the ceiling, unblinking.

I look at Jeff, who is starting to sit up now, and throw my arms around him.

‚ÄúOh my god! I thought you were dead!‚Äù, I cry.

He‚Äôs breathing heavily, and he hugs me back quickly as I let him go and help him to his feet.

Once he‚Äôs to his full height, he takes several deep breaths and puts his hands on his hips.

‚ÄúYou guys okay?‚Äù, he asks.

We both nod.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll call the police..‚Äù, Madison squeaks, as she turns to the landline on the counter.

‚ÄúJeff.. what the hell was that?‚Äù, I ask in disbelief, glancing down at his gun.

‚ÄúThis?‚Äù, he asks, holding it up before putting it on an empty table.

‚ÄúYes, why do you have a gun?‚Äù, I ask him, not in an angry way. But.. I don‚Äôt know, how many diner employees carry guns?

‚ÄúOh..‚Äù, he says, shrugging and pointing at the gun on the table.

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, this is Tony. Tony the gun.‚Äù, he responds matter-of-factly.

*

After the police have come and gone, I find out too much.

Jeff was okay, miraculously, he had noticed he forgot his phone and made it all the way home before he turned back around. 

Thank god he did.

As for ‚ÄúTony‚Äù, the police confiscated it, which Jeff seemed okay with.

He said if he doesn‚Äôt get Tony back, he can get a new one, and he will take me to classes on how to use it. He swore it was only used tonight, but it made him feel safer wearing it.

He jumped into action so fast, I may have to rethink not asking him out.

As for Madison‚Ä¶

Madison had been kidnapped as a teen, and held captive in that man‚Äôs basement for 10 years.

She‚Äôs guessing, as she didn‚Äôt have access to a calendar, but she said that seemed right. The only time she got to leave the basement is when he came to get takeout, and after years, she memorized the route.

They took all three of us to the hospital, and I heard the nurses whispering about the curious injuries Madison had sustained over the years. Once I realized what they were talking about, I coughed loudly to make them stop their gossip about my friend.

I went to see Madison after I had been cleared, and I held her hand as they called her family.

She‚Äôs originally from North Carolina.

And they never stopped looking for her.",1,1757576490.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1ne2mnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ne2mnm/you_helped_me/,You helped me.,"My windshield wipers squeak back and forth as they push the rain off my windshield.

I watch them for a few moments.

Right.. Left.. Right.. Left

I hum a tune to go along with the subtle squeak.

It‚Äôs mindless, but it helps me forget I have to be at work in 5 min-

I glance at the clock on the dash.

‚ÄúShit.‚Äù, I mutter, grabbing my purse and opening the door of my sedan.

I walk briskly to the front door of the diner and swing it open, the warmth inside immediately heating my skin as I shake out my hair.

‚ÄúCamilla, you‚Äôre late.‚Äù, Jeff calls from behind the counter, pouring coffee into a mug.

‚ÄúBy two minutes, sorry. I was here, I zoned out in my car..‚Äù, I say, rounding the edge to the kitchen to put my things down.

‚ÄúWell then you can stay two minutes later, wouldn‚Äôt want your time card off.‚Äù, he says, with a grin.

‚ÄúOh, yeah. I‚Äôm sure.‚Äù, I chuckle, grabbing some menus and beginning to wipe them down.

‚ÄúOkay, but did I sound authoritative?‚Äù, he asks. Ever since his promotion from cook to manager, he has been self-conscious about his new role.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting better!‚Äù, I say enthusiastically.

I‚Äôve been at the diner longer than he has, but I have no interest in becoming a manager.

I tell myself to take a deep breath. I am almost done with my degree and then I can finally get a job in my field of study. I check job listings every day, hoping a spot for a school psychologist opens up soon.

Somewhere.

Anywhere.

‚ÄúDaydreaming?‚Äù, he teases.

I snap out of it, shaking my head while I restart the coffee pot.

As soon as he finishes his closing work, he‚Äôs grabbing his coat to head out.

‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôm headed out. Do you need anything from me before I go home?‚Äù, he asks me.

‚ÄúNope! Have a good night, and get home safely.‚Äù, I respond, looking up from wiping down the counter in front of me.

He stays still for a beat, and then taps the counter twice with his knuckles.

‚ÄúAlrighty. See ya, Cams.‚Äù, he says, waving at the last customer at the counter before heading outside.

The second the bell chimes above the door, I sigh.

I wish I didn‚Äôt find him so handsome. Oh well, soon I will be gone anyways. No point saying anything to him now.

‚ÄúAnything else I can get you, sir?‚Äù, I ask the man at the counter.

The man shakes his head and smiles at me warmly.

‚ÄúNah darlin‚Äô, I‚Äôm just finishing up here and then I‚Äôm headed out. Got a bit more of a drive to San Diego.‚Äù, he tells me, stretching his arms back.

Truckers are our main customers this late at night.

Especially on this road, the path from Arizona to California. Not a whole lot out here besides us, and a few gas stations.

I nod sympathetically.

‚ÄúLet me get you some coffee to take with you.‚Äù, I offer, grabbing a travel cup from below the counter and filling it to the brim.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a sweet girl..‚Äù, he squints at my name tag, ‚ÄúCamilla. Pretty name.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you.. Though I can‚Äôt take credit for it.‚Äù, I say, laughing lightly.

‚ÄúNow, what do I owe you for the to-go cup?‚Äù, he says, reaching for his wallet.

I wave him off.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs on me, you can pay me back by making it there safe.‚Äù, I smile.

He laughs, and takes the cup.

‚ÄúThat other guy left, are you all alone darlin‚Äô?‚Äù, he asks, looking around the now empty diner.

I nod.

‚ÄúFor now, Tony will be here in about five minutes.‚Äù, I say with an easy smile.

What this man doesn‚Äôt know, is that there is no Tony, and I will be here alone tonight. Jeff told me to always say someone named Tony is coming soon, just to keep weirdos in check. I‚Äôve never asked why, but I have never had an issue, anytime someone asks me something like that I always say Tony will be here.. Tony‚Äôs almost here.. Tony is a retired cop..

Sometimes, I even make up elaborate backstories about him.

‚ÄúTony isn‚Äôt a name you try to mess with.‚Äù, Jeff had told me.

And he was right.

The man sighs in relief.

‚ÄúOh good, you know my niece is about your age and I would get nervous about her being out here by herself. Do you want me to wait with you?‚Äù, he asks.

He seems kind, and I don‚Äôt feel threatened, but I‚Äôm still not stupid.

‚ÄúOh you‚Äôre so sweet, but I promise I‚Äôm okay. Better get on the road before your coffee gets cold.‚Äù, I say, clearing his dishes.

He laughs again.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right about that. Okay, you have a good night darlin‚Äô.‚Äù, he tells me, tipping the brim of his hat.

I smile back at him, and watch as he leaves the diner and gets in his truck.

I don‚Äôt stop watching until the headlights blink out in the distance.

I turn to put some clean mugs away, and I see Jeff‚Äôs phone, still plugged in and charging on the counter.

‚ÄúJeff‚Ä¶‚Äù, I sigh.

I swear that man would forget his own head if it wasn‚Äôt attached to his shoulders.

I laugh softly, and begin to wipe down every table, then I bring all the ketchup bottles to the counter to work on refilling them.

Then the ketchup makes me think of fries, and now I‚Äôm hungry.

‚ÄúEarly dinner break, sorry Jeff.‚Äù, I giggle, as I head back to the kitchen.

I put some fries in the fryer and lean back on the wall, waiting for the timer.

I close my eyes, and imagine my first day at a school working with kids. 

And in my mind, I‚Äôm so talented I win every education award a school psychologist can get.

I‚Äôm so good, they erect a statue in my honor.

BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ

I open my eyes and see my fries are done.

Ah, that was a nice dream. For now though, the fries will do.

I shake them into a basket, and take the basket with me to the front to continue cleaning.

As I round the corner, someone is sitting at the counter.

‚ÄúAh!‚Äù, I shriek.

The girl looks up at me, and attempts a smile.

She‚Äôs about my age, and she has her red hair in a high ponytail. A loose white T-shirt and a thin hoodie over it, raindrops having left dark spots on her clothes.

‚ÄúHi there! I‚Äôm so sorry, I didn‚Äôt hear you come in.‚Äù, I squeak out.

Her face is impassive.

‚ÄúSorry, I didn‚Äôt mean to startle you.‚Äù, she says.

‚ÄúNo, my bad! Would you like a menu?‚Äù, I ask.

She tilts her head at me, and nods.

I slide her a menu and grab a mug.

‚ÄúCan I get you something warm to drink? I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre cold from the rain.‚Äù, I say, pouring the steaming coffee.

She looks down at the menu, analyzing every line. I see her eyes dart over each item, like she‚Äôs ticking them off in her head.

‚ÄúJust coffee for now.‚Äù, she says quietly.

I nod, and gesture back to the ketchup bottles.

‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôll be over here if you change your mind.‚Äù, I tell her.

‚ÄúThank you, Camilla.‚Äù, she responds.

I glance down at my name tag again and smile at her.

‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù

I pick up a French fry from the basket to take a bite, when she speaks again.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Madison, by the way.‚Äù, she tells me.

I smile at her.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to meet you, Madison.‚Äù

For a while we just coexist together, listening to the premade playlist of slow 90‚Äôs country to fill the silence.

She doesn‚Äôt drink her coffee, but I do see her holding the mug. Like she‚Äôs trying to just warm up her hands.

Then the rain starts coming down harder, ricocheting off the roof in a rattling noise.

‚ÄúIt sure is coming down tonight..‚Äù, I mumble.

‚ÄúIt is.‚Äù, Madison says, eyes finding me.

‚ÄúYou from around here, or passing through?‚Äù, I ask, stepping towards her.

‚ÄúPassing through, I grew up far from here..‚Äù, she trails off, looking outside at the rain.

‚ÄúAh, okay. Where are you headed?‚Äù, I ask.

Her expression tightens, and she looks down at the mug.

I‚Äôve clearly made her uncomfortable.

‚ÄúSorry, you don‚Äôt have to tell me. The truckers come in and just want to talk and talk so I forgot to put my manners on. Please forgive me.‚Äù, I say quickly, looking at her apologetically.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, you didn‚Äôt make me uncomfortable. I‚Äôm just not sure how to answer where I‚Äôm headed‚Ä¶‚Äù, she says quietly.

I regard her for a moment.

Maybe she‚Äôs running away from something?

Her sleeve of her hoodie shifts and I can see a sliver of her wrist, which appears to have a healing bruise on it. Once she sees me notice, she self-consciously tugs it down as I avert my eyes. 

Someone?

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay. Any way is the right way if you don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre going.‚Äù, I say.

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that from Alice in Wonderland?‚Äù, she asks.

I shrug.

‚ÄúMaybe, I read it in a fortune cookie once.‚Äù, I respond.

She‚Äôs quiet for a moment, and then bursts out in giggles. Which then makes me start to laugh.

I look at her again, and I can‚Äôt put my finger on it, but I know I have seen her before.

‚ÄúHave you come here before? Or do you go to school nearby?‚Äù, I ask, hoping to come off as casually as I can.

‚ÄúOh.. No. I don‚Äôt go to school. I have been here before, but I don‚Äôt normally come inside.‚Äù, she responds, still weening off her giggles.

I tilt my head at her.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt come inside?‚Äù, I ask.

Her expression freezes, and her eyes widen.

‚ÄúI.. Uh.. I have been here before, with someone. But normally they get takeout, so I‚Äôve just waited in the car..‚Äù, she says slowly, like she‚Äôs choosing each word carefully.

She looks up at me, waiting for my response.

It‚Äôs not my business, so I nod.

‚ÄúThat makes sense.‚Äù, I say thoughtfully.

She seems to sigh in relief, then I hear a noise. Something faint, and rumbling. When the noise starts, she puts her hand over her stomach and winces, just slightly.

‚ÄúAre you sure I can‚Äôt get you something to eat?‚Äù, I ask.

‚ÄúUm.. What can this get me?‚Äù, she asks, pulling out a crumpled $5 from her hoodie pocket.

I look at the money, then back at her.

‚ÄúAnd I got the coffee, so.. minus that.‚Äù, she whispers.

I can feel my heart fill with concern for this poor girl, and I have to help her.

‚ÄúDo you like burgers?‚Äù, I ask.

She regards me carefully, then nods.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù, I say, then head to the kitchen.

‚ÄúWait- Please don‚Äôt leave me alone-‚Äú, she panics, looking at the door.

I follow her eyes, and slowly head to the glass door. Locking it, and pulling the blinds down.

‚ÄúCome back with me, you can help.‚Äù, I say, holding out my hand to her.

She stares at my hand, and then shakily takes it.

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù, she whispers.

When we get back into the kitchen, her eyes light up at the options of food.

‚ÄúFries?‚Äù, I ask, opening the door to the freezer.

She nods excitedly.

I shake some into the fryer basket and drop it in.

‚ÄúOkay, now the burgers. I think they are the best thing on the menu, if I‚Äôm being honest.‚Äù, I explain, and her eyes watch my every movement.

‚ÄúSo the grill is on, and it‚Äôs hot, so we just place the patty down. Do you want to try?‚Äù, I ask.

She nods and steps closer.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got this!‚Äù, I say reassuringly.

She places the patty down perfectly, but when the grease sizzles and pops up, she jumps back and screams.

She backs up to the wall and tucks her arms around herself, shaking and whispering.

‚ÄúWoah! Hey, are you okay? Did the oil get you?‚Äù, I rush over, gently touching her arm.

She‚Äôs clutching her arm as tears begin to fall down her face, she rocks back and forth and is sobbing quietly.

‚ÄúHere, let me see. I can clean it.‚Äù, I say gently.

She lets me take her arm, and when I gently push up the sleeve, there is a burn alright.

But this one didn‚Äôt just happen.

And it wasn‚Äôt just some sprayed oil from a grill.

The burn wrapped around her arm, looking healed but.. awful.

I gasp softly.

‚ÄúWhat.. What is-‚Äú, I whisper.

Just then, I hear the front door shaking with someone banging on it.

BANG BANG BANG

Both our faces turn in that direction, and Madison begins to whimper before she puts her hand over her mouth.

‚ÄúIs someone after you?‚Äù, I ask her.

BANG BANG BANG

She nods, tears running down her hands to her shirt.

‚ÄúPlease help me.‚Äù, she whispers.

I take her in. The fearful expression, the panic attack, the burn..

BANG BANG BANG

I have to help her.

‚ÄúOkay, get in here.‚Äù, I hurry her to the door of the walk-in fridge and push her in.

BANG BANG BANG

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come out unless I tell you to.‚Äù, I say quickly, before closing it.

I quickly turn off the grill and fryer, and jog to the front door, before opening it fully.

‚ÄúHi there! Sorry about that, I was working on the dishes and didn‚Äôt hear anyone.‚Äù, I say in my best charming waitress voice.

The man waiting for me on the other end of the door is straight from a horror movie.

He wasn‚Äôt very tall, but he was stocky. Dark hair plastered his forehead and arms, and he was drenched from the rain.

His eyes.. His eyes though.. 

They looked at me like they knew all my secrets.

And he did look familiar. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve waited on him directly, but he‚Äôs definitely been here before.

‚ÄúCome on in and get yourself dry, can I get you something warm to drink?‚Äù, I ask as casually as I can.

He watches me cross behind the counter before he takes a step inside the diner.

‚ÄúCoffee.‚Äù, is the only word he grunts.

‚ÄúYou got it.‚Äù, I say, grabbing a mug and pouring it to the top.

‚ÄúCream or sugar?‚Äù, I ask.

He shakes his head.

‚ÄúCan I get you a menu?‚Äù, I ask.

‚ÄúHas anyone else come in here tonight?‚Äù, he asks me.

I pause, and tilt my head like I‚Äôm thinking really hard.

‚ÄúA trucker headed to San Diego, left a while ago. You mean him?‚Äù, I ask him.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for a girl. Young, red hair. You seen her?‚Äù, he asks me.

I shake my head slowly, wiping down the counter he‚Äôs sitting at.

‚ÄúNo, I wish. There are too many men who come through here, I would love someone to gossip with!‚Äù, and I laugh like I‚Äôm the biggest air-head in the world.

He watches me, carefully.

I just continue on with my regular nightly tasks, trying not to think about the girl in the walk-in.

‚ÄúYou all alone here?‚Äù, he finally asks.

I nod while brewing more coffee.

‚ÄúFor now, Tony will be here in a few minutes though. He had a boxing match tonight, so he couldn‚Äôt come in until after.‚Äù, I ramble.

Tony has quite the backstory.

The man studies me, like he‚Äôs trying to figure out if I‚Äôm lying.

Shit.

‚ÄúYou hungry?‚Äù, I ask, glancing at the menu I left in front of him.

He shakes his head.

‚ÄúAlright, well let me know if you need any-‚Äú, I start to say.

‚ÄúWhere is she?‚Äù, he interrupts.

I look at him with my best confused expression.

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù, I ask innocently.

‚ÄúMadison.‚Äù, he huffs.

I try to keep my face neutral.

‚ÄúI told you, I don‚Äôt know who-‚Äú

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt lie to me, GIRL.‚Äù, he shouts the last word, leaning over the counter and trying to grab my apron.

I step back and start to panic.

‚ÄúNo one has-‚Äú

‚ÄúI know she came here, or she‚Äôs still here. This is the only place she knows.‚Äù, he seethes, putting both his hands on the counter like he‚Äôs going to jump over it.

‚ÄúOkay, just calm down. She was here, okay? About an hour ago, and she left. She left and headed West..‚Äù, I say, shakily pointing my hand in the general direction.

He glares at me.

I think quickly, and continue.

‚ÄúShe asked me not to tell anyone she was here, she gave me cash. Okay?‚Äù, I say quickly.

‚ÄúHuh..‚Äù, he says, getting up and crossing across the diner to look out the window.

I can feel my heartbeat in my ears.

‚ÄúWell.. if my Madison is gone..‚Äù, he begins, and I feel my shoulders begin to relax.

‚ÄúYes, she‚Äôs gone. I‚Äôm sorry-‚Äú

‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll have to take you instead.‚Äù, he says, as he turns at the counter to corner me behind it.

My heart stops.

‚ÄúNo, please..‚Äù, I say, beginning to inch towards the kitchen.

The man lunges at me, and I shriek, picking up a metal platter to defend myself with.

He makes it to me in about a second and snatches the platter out of my hands, the metal banging against the linoleum in a horrible sound.

I scream as he grabs my arm.

‚ÄúStop.‚Äù, a soft voice sounds from the kitchen.

We both look up to see Madison, standing in the kitchen doorway. She‚Äôs shaking, and wringing her hands, and I can see how red her eyes are.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm here, I‚Äôm sorry. Take me, but leave her. She was only trying to help me.‚Äù, she whispers, looking at the man and not me.

The man looks between us for a moment, his eyes filled with fire, and hate.

Then slowly, his crude mouth forms a disgusting grin.

‚ÄúWhy have one, when I can have both?‚Äù, he sneers.

I pick up a metal napkin holder and whack him on the head as hard as I can, which sends him staggering back.

‚ÄúRun!‚Äù, I shout as I grab Madison‚Äôs arm and we run past him around the bend in the counter.

‚ÄúYou.. Agh!‚Äù, he shouts as he leaps over the counter, blocking our path.

Madison and I hold each other as we back up, I‚Äôm crying and she‚Äôs staying strong, but I can feel her trembling.

‚ÄúHow nice Madison.. You found a friend. A first for you. Seeing how not a single person has looked for you since I took you to live with me..‚Äù, he huffs, laughing darkly.

‚ÄúPlease‚Ä¶‚Äù, she pleads.

As he backs us up away from the door, I see all my dreams start to disappear.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll never be able to help anyone..‚Äù, I whisper to myself.

Madison glances sideways at me, and squeezes my hand.

‚ÄúYou helped me.‚Äù, she whispers back.

I turn to look at her, and I hear a bell.

‚ÄúHey Cams, I forgot my- What the hell?‚Äù

All 3 of us turn to the door, to see Jeff standing in the doorway.

It takes Jeff a second, his eyes dart from me and Madison, to the man. 

‚ÄúCami-‚Äú, he starts.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to take us!‚Äù, I shriek.

The man turns to face Jeff and begins to barrel towards him.

And it happens so fast.

One second, the guy has his hands outreached to Jeff‚Äôs throat.

The next, Jeff reaches into his jacket, pulling out something black, just as the man tackles him to the ground.

Madison and I are screaming when a shot rings out, echoing through the diner.

I scream in horror, as I run over to the crumpled pile of men.

‚ÄúJeff? Jeff!‚Äù, I cry out.

No one moves for a second, and then the man begins to shift.

‚ÄúOh my god.‚Äù, I whisper.

The man shifts, and falls off of Jeff, rolling onto his back. His cruel eyes, staring up at the ceiling, unblinking.

I look at Jeff, who is starting to sit up now, and throw my arms around him.

‚ÄúOh my god! I thought you were dead!‚Äù, I cry.

He‚Äôs breathing heavily, and he hugs me back quickly as I let him go and help him to his feet.

Once he‚Äôs to his full height, he takes several deep breaths and puts his hands on his hips.

‚ÄúYou guys okay?‚Äù, he asks.

We both nod.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll call the police..‚Äù, Madison squeaks, as she turns to the landline on the counter.

‚ÄúJeff.. what the hell was that?‚Äù, I ask in disbelief, glancing down at his gun.

‚ÄúThis?‚Äù, he asks, holding it up before putting it on an empty table.

‚ÄúYes, why do you have a gun?‚Äù, I ask him, not in an angry way. But.. I don‚Äôt know, how many diner employees carry guns?

‚ÄúOh..‚Äù, he says, shrugging and pointing at the gun on the table.

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, this is Tony. Tony the gun.‚Äù, he responds matter-of-factly.

*

After the police have come and gone, I find out too much.

Jeff was okay, miraculously, he had noticed he forgot his phone and made it all the way home before he turned back around. 

Thank god he did.

As for ‚ÄúTony‚Äù, the police confiscated it, which Jeff seemed okay with.

He said if he doesn‚Äôt get Tony back, he can get a new one, and he will take me to classes on how to use it. He swore it was only used tonight, but it made him feel safer wearing it.

He jumped into action so fast, I may have to rethink not asking him out.

As for Madison‚Ä¶

Madison had been kidnapped as a teen, and held captive in that man‚Äôs basement for 10 years.

She‚Äôs guessing, as she didn‚Äôt have access to a calendar, but she said that seemed right. The only time she got to leave the basement is when he came to get takeout, and after years, she memorized the route.

They took all three of us to the hospital, and I heard the nurses whispering about the curious injuries Madison had sustained over the years. Once I realized what they were talking about, I coughed loudly to make them stop their gossip about my friend.

I went to see Madison after I had been cleared, and I held her hand as they called her family.

She‚Äôs originally from North Carolina.

And they never stopped looking for her.",3,1757576436.0,nosleep,1,0.8,False
1ne2mlt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_somu0903/comments/1ne2mlt/a_week_with_the_ausom_dt2_pro_fast_planted_and/,"A week with the AUSOM DT2 Pro ‚Äî fast, planted, and way more fun than I expected","DT2 Pro feels like a legit ‚Äúmini-moto‚Äù for city and suburban rides. Strong punch from the dual motors, confidence-inspiring brakes, surprisingly comfy suspension, and thoughtful touches (NFC lock + hidden AirTag spot). If you want a spirited dual-motor without going full tank-sized off-road scooter, this hits a sweet spot.

# The ride story

I picked up the DT2 Pro as a ‚Äúdo-everything‚Äù scooter: quick errands, weekend coffee runs, and a couple of longer play rides on bike-paths and back roads. First launch in Dual-Motor + ‚ÄúRace‚Äù mode made me laugh out loud‚Äîthere‚Äôs a clean surge with no herky-jerkiness. Throttle feels predictable, so threading through gaps or rolling back on smoothly after a speed bump is natural.

Once rolling, it settles into a very *planted* vibe. The rocker-arm (swingarm) suspension does more work than I expected; it takes the sting out of cracks and keeps the deck calm at speed. Around 40‚Äì55 km/h it feels composed rather than sketchy, which is where many budget scooters start to wobble. Braking is where it really earns trust: the hydraulic discs bite fast and straight, and the E-ABS keeps things tidy if you clamp down harder than you meant to.

Night rides are a win‚Äîthe lighting is bright and functional, and drivers notice you. The 10√ó3.0 tubeless tires are a sweet middle ground: enough footprint to feel secure, but still easy to lean and steer precisely. I‚Äôve run them firm for speed days and a touch softer when I‚Äôm playing on rougher pavement; both setups felt solid.

Practical bits: the NFC lock is awesome for quick stops, and the hidden AirTag spot is such a small but thoughtful touch. The fold is stout (forged latch feels overbuilt in a good way), and while the scooter is no featherweight, it‚Äôs still manageable enough to lift into a hatchback without hating life.

# What stood out (pros)

* **Punchy dual-motor acceleration** that‚Äôs usable, not twitchy.
* **Hydraulic brakes + E-ABS** = real confidence when you need to scrub speed quickly.
* **Suspension that actually works** on beat-up tarmac‚Äîless hand/foot buzz than I expected.
* **Tubeless 10√ó3.0 tires** feel secure yet agile; easy to tune pressure to taste.
* **Quality-of-life features**: NFC lock, hidden AirTag mount, dual charge ports, big display.
* **Stability at speed**: no drama cruising in the mid-40s to 50s (km/h) when conditions allow.

# What I‚Äôd improve (cons)

* **Weight**: it‚Äôs still a 30-something-kg scooter; stairs aren‚Äôt fun.
* **Deck length** is fine, but a tad more width near the front would be perfect for long stances.
* **No official app** (didn‚Äôt miss it, but worth noting if you‚Äôre app-centric).

# Who it‚Äôs for

* Riders who want **real dual-motor performance** and braking without stepping up to the super-heavy 11-inch, 40-plus-kg monsters.
* Folks who split time between **city streets and rougher pavement**, and care about comfort at speed.
* Anyone who values **safety touches** (hydraulic brakes, E-ABS, bright lights, NFC lock) as much as raw numbers.

# Tips from my rides

* Set **tire pressure** thoughtfully: higher for speed/efficiency, a little lower for grip/comfort.
* Learn the **three speed levels** in single and dual‚Äînice to have a chilled mode for crowded areas and a hot mode for open stretches.
* Treat the **E-ABS** as your friend: it‚Äôs there to keep things straight when you brake harder than planned.

# Bottom line

The AUSOM DT2 Pro nails that ‚Äúfast but civilized‚Äù sweet spot. It‚Äôs quick enough to be exciting, composed enough to feel safe, and practical enough to use a lot. After a week of mixed riding, it feels less like a toy and more like a compact electric moto that just happens to fold. Would buy again.",1,1757576430.0,u_somu0903,0,1.0,False

Chapter II: The Fractures

Time snapped first, but it didn‚Äôt sound like breaking. It sounded like a spoon set down on a counter vibrating of its own accord for nineteen seconds and stopping on a note no one could name.

At oh-three bridge-time, the chronometer insisted twenty minutes had passed since oh-two. Elara‚Äôs wrist-chron, however, could account for forty-three. The galley timer began defaulting to a mood rather than a number. (‚ÄúLunch-ish,‚Äù Jax announced, pointing at its lazy green glow. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt love it.‚Äù)

‚ÄúBridge time is canonical,‚Äù Elara said, voice cool as a hospital railing. ‚ÄúWe agree on the when even if the when disagrees on us.‚Äù

They tried.

The ship acquired new noises the way a city acquires graffiti. The vents breathed in irregular phrases. Bulkheads sighed as if snugging on a winter coat. In the aft corridor, a panel squeaked at intervals like a trapped mouse. Marrek stalked it with a wrench as if he could club time back into a single lane.

Breakfast betrayed them: powdered egg reconstituted into a custard with the wrong sweetness, the syrup-sticky taste of nursery food. Marrek analyzed a spoonful under a portable spectrometer and swore. ‚ÄúPrinter‚Äôs fine. Recipe‚Äôs fine. The universe is buying counterfeit.‚Äù

Solenne ate his bowl with a neatness that would have looked fastidious if not for the gleam in his eyes. ‚ÄúAdaptive chemistry,‚Äù he repeated, dreamy. ‚ÄúI wonder if it‚Äôs a field effect or if‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù Anika said, too sharp, then softened it. ‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù

The first scratching came mid-shift: a long, lazy drag along the hull that all of them pretended for one breath they had not heard. Jax flinched at the console. ‚ÄúThermal flex,‚Äù Marrek offered immediately.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Renn, gently. ‚ÄúNot at that speed.‚Äù

A pause. The drag again‚Äîslower, deliberate. Tchk‚Ä¶ tchk‚Ä¶ tchk.

They breathed together, the way people do outside a closed door while someone behind it decides who they are.

‚ÄúMaintain course,‚Äù Elara said. She kept her hands still on the rail. She did not say We are prey. She did not say Do not run.

The dust Solenne had coaxed from the airlock developed a social life. In its sealed tray it arranged itself along invisible lines, coaxed into frost-branching patterns like lightning in glass. Solenne recorded with a steadiness that bordered on prayer. ‚ÄúChemotaxis without a gradient,‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúIt shouldn‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù He smiled. ‚ÄúI am so tired of that word.‚Äù

Anika refused to look at the tray. She pretended to read the medcold inventory; in truth, she was reading a poem Renn had slipped under the medbay mug ‚Äî eight lines about a harbor he had seen once as a child, the way the lanterns swayed like breaths held and let go. The poem wasn‚Äôt very good. It didn‚Äôt matter. There was a word in it‚Äîtallow‚Äîthat made her throat ache with tenderness for something she had never been allowed to want.

They stopped pretending not to seek each other. In odd corners of the ship they found rooms to be people in. They ate the same bad custard leaning shoulder to shoulder, their bowls touching on the counter like two moons. They invented a game: three true things, no questions, no explanation. (Anika: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt walk under the last rung of a ladder if I can help it.‚Äù Renn: ‚ÄúI will always pick the longer way if it has better stairs.‚Äù Anika: ‚ÄúWhen I was eight, I wanted to be a lighthouse.‚Äù Renn: ‚ÄúYou are.‚Äù She pretended not to understand and let heat creep up her neck.)

The scratching circled them at intervals. Once, during shipnight, it stopped beside the forward viewport and waited long enough that Jax whispered, ‚ÄúYou can feel a look without eyes.‚Äù No one told him to shut up.

On the seventy-third day by the bridge, gravity remembered them too hard. The field surged‚Äîno warning, no ripple‚Äîlike an invisible hand had pressed down with curiosity. Elara went to one knee and felt her shoulder pop; Marrek cracked his lip on a console; Jax‚Äôs eyes veined red as capillaries burst; Anika folded around the ache in her ribs and kept breathing like she‚Äôd promised a god something.

Then the weight lifted and they lay splayed where they had been pinned, panting. The engineering board read serene as a church. Marrek wiped his mouth. ‚ÄúNo fluctuation. No surge. We didn‚Äôt do that.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe ship did,‚Äù Jax said, and laughed too brightly. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs flirting.‚Äù

‚ÄúShips don‚Äôt flirt,‚Äù Elara said.

‚ÄúYes, they do,‚Äù Marrek muttered. ‚ÄúUsually right before they break your heart.‚Äù

Condensation formed on the walls where it had no business forming. It ran in slow beads that smelled faintly of copper. Anika touched one and rubbed her fingers together and did not tell anyone what color it left.

That evening, with the shift change strung out by caution, Elara found Renn and Anika in the aft observation blister, a narrow glass throat jutting into the rift, a place you went if you wanted to feel small. They stood close, shoulders not touching but speaking. Anika had her hand over Renn‚Äôs on the rail‚Äînot shyly, not possessively; simply in a pact. Elara should have scolded them for being off-rotation. She did not. She let them have the minute. She would need what it bought later.

Something in the rift moved without moving.

Renn‚Äôs breath hitched. ‚ÄúDo you see that bloom?‚Äù he whispered. The blue-white eddy that looked like a galaxy with second thoughts tightened, unfurled, tightened again. He hummed a thread of sound low in his throat, almost involuntary, as if the pattern had reached into him and plucked nerve like gut string. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ lanes. Like currents.‚Äù

Anika did not look away from the dark. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt follow them.‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt,‚Äù he said, which was not quite the same as No.

When he turned, she kissed him. A quiet kiss, two breaths long. It tasted of copper and coffee. When it ended, she set her forehead to his, and he whispered a number she did not recognize, the way men say names in their sleep.

The scratching came again, patient, amused. Tchk. Tchk. Tchk. It traced the arc of the blister and paused at the glass between their faces and everything else that ever was. The pressure there felt like a hand.

Anika flinched and then‚Äîdeliberately‚Äîdid not step back. Renn did not pull away. They both stared into the syrup-black where a shape was failing to make up its mind about limbs.

‚ÄúMaintain course,‚Äù came Elara‚Äôs voice over the blister intercom. Her tone was steady. The iron had not so much as cooled.

The intercom clicked off. For a heartbeat the ship and the rift and the two of them and the scratch all hung together in an impossible balance and then it was shipnight‚Äîa fiction they were suddenly grateful for‚Äîand the Acheron dimmed her lights as if lowering a voice in a house where the walls had begun to listen.

They slept badly.

Elara dreamed of a lighthouse whose beam did not warn sailors away from rocks but beckoned something larger than a storm. Marrek dreamed he was elbow-deep inside a machine that had decided to be a body. Jax dreamed of speed and found that every turn took him nearer to the same fixed point. Solenne dreamed of pollen writing his name in tiny hurting letters across the inside of his eyes. Renn and Anika dreamed of stairs. In theirs, the stairs never ended, and that was a mercy.

When they woke, the ship smelled faintly of iron and salt and a sweetness they did not say tasted like nursery.

The rift breathed. The Acheron learned the next bar of the song.",1,1757575836.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

The Acheron moved like a thought someone was trying not to think.

From the outside, she was all black skin and mute angles; from the inside, she was a long whisper of corridors and breath and instruments, a cathedral without worshipers. She had been commissioned for the sort of voyage reports liked to call ‚Äúnon-trivial,‚Äù which meant there would be no brass band waiting when she returned‚Äîonly a room and a chair, a recorder‚Äôs red light, and the ache of trying to say the right thing about what the dark had done to you.

Her crew numbered six, and they wore their reasons like talismans:
	‚Ä¢	Captain Elara Vey, all poise and iron. She spoke as if every sentence cost fuel. Once, she commanded fleets and smiled in photographs; now, she kept a silvered commendation plaque in her locker wrapped in a rag, as though the shine offended her. Her sin was obsession. Her virtue was the same.
	‚Ä¢	Marrek, chief engineer, wide-shouldered, chronically unshaven, and allergic to untested theory. He loved machines because they did not pretend to be better than they were. He loved coffee more than he admitted. He kept a cracked spoon from a yard-side caf√© in a pocket like a saint‚Äôs bone.
	‚Ä¢	Jax, pilot, all nerve and grin, a man who had once bet his life in a racing skiff against a storm and written the IOU on his own forehead in grease pencil. It had washed off in the rain; the debt remained.
	‚Ä¢	Dr. Solenne, biologist, knife-thin and scalpel-precise, a man who believed biology was a locked door that would always yield to the right pressure. He had the clean hands of a priest and the ideas of a thief.
	‚Ä¢	Renn, navigator, bright-eyed, young enough to treat fear like a strange spice. Equations lived in him like songs. He had memorized starfields the way lovers memorize faces.
	‚Ä¢	Anika, medic, small and careful, with a quiet asterism of scars at her left temple, the legacy of an explosion on a hospital ship where the triage lists had grown teeth. She hid gentleness like contraband.

They lived inside the same metal breath for seventy days before the rift finally showed itself. On that day, Elara stood at the forward viewport‚ÄîMarrek called it the ‚Äúrose window‚Äù when he was in a rare mood‚Äîand watched space come undone.

The rift was not a tear. It was a blessing in a language no human throat could bear. It hung against the starfield like oil on water, a film of shifting thickness that made the light behind it go strange: lengths, colors, intentions rearranged. The edges breathed. Somewhere in there, a star curved the wrong way.

Jax whistled low. ‚ÄúYou ever seen a bad idea wear a dress that nice?‚Äù

‚ÄúMark the time,‚Äù Elara said. ‚ÄúBridge chronometer is canonical.‚Äù

Renn‚Äôs fingers fluttered over the board, quick, precise. He leaned forward, face open to wonder. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ patterned,‚Äù he said softly. ‚ÄúNot random. There‚Äôs repetition. Or near-repetition.‚Äù

‚ÄúStochastic symmetries,‚Äù Solenne murmured. ‚ÄúNatural systems love near-miss order.‚Äù

‚ÄúNatural systems love lying,‚Äù Marrek said, and put his palm to a panel as if feeling for a fever. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll hold,‚Äù he added to the ship, not to them.

Anika stood back from the glass. The rift‚Äôs colors found her anyway, painting her throat in a bruise of violet. ‚ÄúIt looks like something listening,‚Äù she said, then flushed, as if she‚Äôd spoken out of turn.

Renn looked over. Their eyes found and held‚Äîjust a second. ‚ÄúMaybe it is,‚Äù he said, gentle. ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs the first patient you can‚Äôt hear the heart of, but you can tell it‚Äôs there.‚Äù

A line formed beside Anika‚Äôs mouth that might have been a smile if she‚Äôd let it. ‚ÄúThat isn‚Äôt reassuring.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù said Marrek. ‚ÄúBe suspicious. Suspicion keeps ships whole.‚Äù

The Acheron crossed the threshold with a sound like distant rain. Every light drew a breath, dimmed, then steadied. The boards rolled out clean. The hull spoke a long vowel.

Pressure laid a hand on their chests for the length of a heartbeat. Jax adjusted them half a degree starboard and then, carefully, back. That small course-correction felt like stepping from a curb and finding the street missing.

They watched the world change.

Stars elongated into threads, then rebundled into knots. The darkness between them went plush and layered, as if there were several blacks stacked together. The instruments reported normal space. Their eyes insisted otherwise.

For a while, wonder was louder than fear. Renn began to sketch on a page he kept folded in his breast pocket, quick loops of geometry and ratios, little arpeggios of numbers that, to him, were half-remembered lullabies. Solenne collected specks from the airlock seal that glowed faintly on his glove‚Äî‚Äúbioluminescent dust,‚Äù he pronounced, delighted by the contradiction. Jax named an eddy of bluish light ‚Äúthe Deep Gin‚Äù and steered wide of it with a reverence he would never admit was reverence.

Elara said little. She owned her hunger the way some people own land: formally, with stained deeds and grudges.

In the quiet hour after the first shift, when the ship settled into its new breathing and the watchers rotated, Renn found Anika in the medbay inventorying bandages like the heat of her gaze could change their tensile strength. She had a soft way with gauze: the pads sat in precise stacks, not ranked like soldiers, but nested like sleeping creatures.

‚ÄúI keep wanting to take a baseline on our sanity,‚Äù she said without looking up. ‚ÄúDo a before-and-after.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt come in sane,‚Äù he said, and made her look at him. ‚ÄúWe came in brave.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs there a difference?‚Äù

Renn‚Äôs smile came a little crooked, like his thoughts sometimes did. ‚ÄúYes. One of them is useful.‚Äù

She opened her mouth to argue and found herself laughing instead‚Äîthe small, surprised kind that knocks a little glass off the edge of a shelf and doesn‚Äôt care where it breaks. When she stopped, she pressed the heel of her hand beneath her left clavicle as though her heart had startled.

‚ÄúTell me a true thing about you,‚Äù he said, emboldened by the laugh, by the way the medbay light turned her irises amber.

‚ÄúI hate the color of hospital dawn,‚Äù she said at once. ‚ÄúThat green. It stains the bones of the day.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnother,‚Äù he prompted.

‚ÄúI sleep with my boots under the bed pointed toward the door. Bad luck otherwise.‚Äù She hesitated. ‚ÄúYour turn.‚Äù

‚ÄúI count stairs,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAlways. Even when there aren‚Äôt any.‚Äù

She tilted her head, smiled for real now. ‚ÄúThere aren‚Äôt any.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù he said, and made it a promise: I‚Äôll count anyway.

When he left, he wrote a little notation on his folded page, no bigger than a thumbnail: a curve that did not close and a word below it‚Äîdawn‚Äîas if he meant to remember that color and never use it.

What do I do?,"Here's some back story about our relationship and why we broke up. My first boyfriend (currently 19M) broke up with me (currently 18F) in June of 2024 after dating for just about 11ish months because he ""needed to work on himself."" Back then, I was naive and also didn't know the facts that he was most likely soliciting and emotionally cheating on me with many different girls throughout our entire relationship and I wasn't made aware until one them DM'd me receipts that following Wednesday and brought it to my attention. There's about 5 girls I can think of off the top of my head (3 of them ex-coworkers since we met at work and started dating after we both left that company, and 2 that we had known or he had introduced me to) and I keep finding out new information about what he did behind my back every time I talk to people in both of our circles. He hasn't apologized or told me his side of the story at all and it's been more than a year. I had never gone through a break up before, so of course I was incredibly sad and thought he was the one because I ignored a few menial signs that I thought were nothing and he could easy explain away. A few months into our tinder, one of my friends found his tinder, so I called him crying and asked him to take it down. He said he hadn't used it since before we became serious and said he deleted it. Since I was 17 at the time I didn't have tinder and did not know how it worked, so I had my friend make sure it was gone and he said it was. He was also a ""prankster"" and I put that in quotation marks because his ""jokes"" were just not funny. Ex: on April Fool's day he wanted to tell his mom that I was pregnant. I told him hell no. Looking back, our relationship was not healthy. He never put any effort into anything. I never got a fun Prom or Homecoming proposal because he did everything over text. He even originally asked me to be his girlfriend AND broke up with me through Snapchat (separate days, obvi). It took a lot of convincing from my friends to see the signs and not get back with him. I take pride in being kind to others and even though he did so much harm to me, I still cared about his well being (still do to be honest) and was telling me how much he missed me from about September of 2024.

Since last year, his attempts to get back together have been relentless no matter what I do. I unadded him on Snapchat, unfollowed him on instagram and unadded him as as follower of my profile (I have it privated for many reasons), and after some convincing from friends, I blocked his phone number. I still had rose-tinted glasses on, so a lot of this didn't happen until December-ish. But up until then, he would text and ask for a second chance, or to get coffee, or the occasional horny reel off Instagram (major ick). When I blocked him and unfollowed him, I thought I was home free, since I finally came to my senses and realized that this would never work in any universe. Then, on June 19th of this year, I got a text from an unknown number, but at this point, I just want him to leave me alone, so I gave him a paragraph, to which he didn't responded to.

Now, were caught up. At around 1am, I checked my phone to see that he had requested to follow me on Instagram. I only accepted because I knew he would find another way to contact me and I might as well just try to hear him out now. Maybe he'll acknowledge what he did and actually apologize for once in his own words (did I mention he used Chat GPT to write things to send to me in the past?) and I can move on with my life. I'll include the screenshot of his instagram voice memo, it's basically him saying he misses me, his family misses me, and he misses my family. He also mentioned something about my birds? Genuinely am not sure what he's trying to say about them being his ""tipping point,"" he barely interacted with them. Interpretations of this are more than welcome, my babies have always been a point of contention for him for whatever reason and he never explained why. I always was more than friendly to his two dogs and they even really liked me and came to greet me whenever I hung out at his house.

How do I get him to leave me the hell alone? At this point, it's a cycle where I tell him to leave me alone, move on with my life, and then he texts me again and this repeats. It's not conducive to either of us and he just won't move on.

Questions are more than welcome, it's 2am and I'm quite sleepy after a long day of college, so it's possible that I've typed word salad, but I can't sleep because he just wants to get back together (over text again! see a theme?)

I'm conducting a short 3-minute survey to better understand the habits, challenges and preferences around reusable coffee cups in Australia.

The aim is to validate an idea for a collapsible reusable cup that's designed to be more compact that most options currently on the market and made from more biodegradable materials, helping reduce reliance on single-use paper coffee cups while being more convenient to carry around on the go.

This survey is intended for Australian residents only and all responses are anonymous. 

There is an optional field at the end where you can leave your email if you'd like to be updated about the idea or take part in prototype testing in the future. Your information will be used only for that purpose.

The idea is simple, and probably well known, but when I first looked for recipes, I struggled to find clear info, so I took my time to fine-tune it.

**This recipe is for 100% Arabica coffee ONLY**. I have **not** tried robustas for this method.

Equipment needed - South Indian filter maker, AeroPress filter paper, grinder.

# Grind size vocabulary (1Zpresso JX-Pro)

To discuss grind settings, let‚Äôs establish a common vocabulary. My grinder has numbered positions from **0‚Äì9** and can do several full rotations. For this recipe, make **two full rotations** from absolute 0 (where the burrs don‚Äôt rotate at all) and call this our **‚Äúnew 0.‚Äù** From here we‚Äôll reference **‚Äì2** (finer) and **+2** (coarser) numbered positions‚Äîeach position is **4 clicks** apart.

As a rule of thumb, the lighter the roast, the finer you‚Äôll go.

For the recipe below I‚Äôve used **BT‚Äôs Seethargundu Estate**, a **light-roast, washed-process** coffee.

# Recipe

1. Grind 20g of coffee at -2.
2. Place an aeropress filter paper on the filter maker and rinse it with warm water.
3. Transfer the coffee grounds and shake the filter maker gently to level the bed (or use a WDT tool).
4. Pour water at 95-100 ^(o)C. Volumes below are cumulative
   1. 0s: 40ml (swirl gently to mix all the coffee and water)
   2. 45s: 100ml
   3. 1m 15s: 150ml
5. Gently swirl the filter maker in a circular motion.
6. You should hear a continuous trickle. If not, lift the filter maker and tap it lightly on the counter.
7. The brew should be ready in under 4m 30s.

# Notes for dialing in

Aim for a total brew time of 3m 30s to 4m 30s, depending on your grind quality and flavour preference (e.g., naturally processed coffees can be intense - some love it, others don't)

Grind size by roast profile

* Light roast: -2
* Medium roast: -2 to 0
* Dark roast: 0 to +2

Grind size by processing

* Natural: 0
* Washed: -2
* Fermented: 0
* Monsooned: 0 to +2

Brew temperature

* Light roast: 95-100 ^(o)C
* Medium roast: 90-92 ^(o)C
* Medium dark roast: 85-90 ^(o)C
* Dark roast: 80-85 ^(o)C

These are indicative; dial in based on your grinder, beans, and personal preference.

# Result

The final brew is delicious and **full-bodied,** about as thick as you can get without entering espresso territory. The flavours are rich and clean, with no loose grounds. I have a V60, AeroPress, and a Picopresso (no longer working), and this recipe gives me the best **flavour:volume:body** ratio. Just *uff*.

You can add milk if you like (I haven‚Äôt tried it‚Äîplease share your results!). It may take **1‚Äì2 attempts** to dial in, but once you get it right, there‚Äôs no going back.

### My Journey with Faceless Growth

I remember when I started. I was doing everything‚Äîwriting, recording videos, stressing out over social media. My evenings turned into late work sessions, and I felt trapped on a hamster wheel. üêπ But then I stumbled upon something revolutionary, and now my evenings are filled with Netflix and *not* spreadsheets!

Just recently, I followed some of the strategies from **Faceless Growth Mastery**, and wow, my productivity skyrocketed! I can honestly say that I *wish* I had found this sooner.

1ne25w3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ne25w3,"Meet the Codewright Brothers: Two Sims Chasing Indie Dev Dreams (With Glitch, Patch & Pixel üê∂üê∂üê±)!!!","So I was reading [this Pedestrian article ranking TS1](https://www.pedestrian.tv/news/the-sims-1-ranked/), and one of the image just stuck with me: *The one with the dude crashed out on a couch, and his computer balanced on a dining table, his pizza box and all that clutter.* Somehow that fueled my imagination and gave me that spark to create my latest household: the **Codewright Brothers**!! Just two siblings who ditched their wealthy family to pursue indie game development. ü§ìü§ìüëæ

What a blast I had with this build! Like, a mini shrine to computers:

* Posters plastered everywhere *(because every dev needs ""inspiration"")*
* A dining table somehow also turned into their dev studio
* Tech clutter in every corner woohoo! - old TVs, consoles, spare monitors
* Their fridge? Filled with microwavable food lol.

Armed with second-hand computers, questionable diets, and way too much caffeine, the Codewright brothers are convinced they‚Äôre one patch away from fame. Will their blockbuster game idea take off - or just crash like their old desktop?‚Äù

**Introducing the Codewright Brothers' bio:**

* **Elliot:** Elliot‚Äôs the ‚Äòbig ideas‚Äô brother, always sketching characters and spinning stories. He believes their game will change the world‚Äîif only he could remember where he left his energy drink. He calls himself the ‚Äòcreative visionary,‚Äô but Max just calls him a procrastinator. When he‚Äôs not doodling characters on napkins, he‚Äôs pitching game ideas to the goldfish. *One day, he swears, it‚Äôll listen.*
* **Max:** Max believes sleep is optional and debugging is a lifestyle. He may live in hoodies and eat pizza crusts for breakfast, but in his mind, every all-nighter brings them closer to the big time. Or maybe just heartburn. He swears every problem has a solution‚Ä¶ *except maybe finding a clean pair of socks.*

And because I couldn't resist, their pets are also part of the theme!

* üê∂ **Glitch:** causes chaos at all hours!!!
* üê∂ **Patch:** loyal fixer, always following the brothers.
* üê± **Pixel:** small, smug, and usually sitting on a keyboard.

**Backstory:** They grew up with money, but their parents wanted them to be lawyers, bankers, or doctors. Instead, they grabbed some family funds, their own skills, and ran off to live the dream. Reality check: turns out success doesn‚Äôt come easy - and neither does cooking. *Cue the 4am fast food binges.*

***Note:*** If you read this to the end, thank you!! You get a cookie. üç™ (Ooh, maybe I can have another pet called Cookies) üòÇüòÇ Now I‚Äôm curious - what was the last odd place YOU got Sims inspiration from? A movie? A meme?

Crew members drifted through corridors, voices hollow, swallowed by shadows that moved independently. Light spilled through observation domes, painting cosmic dust like ash floating through liquid darkness.

Lieutenant Mara Vasquez sipped recycled coffee, forcing calm.
‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt feel right,‚Äù Cho muttered. ‚ÄúThe station‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs aware.‚Äù

A door inhaled. Frost crawled along the floors like icy fingers. The vents convulsed. Something waited.

Then they emerged. Not human. Not alive. Not anything Mara could name.

Masses of writhing, semi-liquid flesh poured from walls, folding like serpents of cartilage and jet-black bone. Faces bubbled up‚Äîeyes nested inside eyes, mouths gaping sideways, dripping black-and-purple ichor that hissed on metal. Tentacles erupted at every joint, tipped with jagged shards of jet-black bone, twitching as if tasting the air. Veins pulsed violet beneath translucent skin.

One detached, towering over Mara. Its head split into three faces, screaming in multiple keys, some soundless, grinding against reality itself. Eyes blinked in impossible patterns, glowing faint violet. Shards of jet-black bone jutted from its shoulders and spine like living lattice. Slime streaked with purple hissed as it touched metal.

It moved faster than thought. Walls bulged, reshaping, pulling Mara into impossible angles. Doors opened into ceilings; floors split open like snapping jaws. Tentacles shot through the air, grasping, dragging Cho into puddles of black-and-violet ichor. Faces bubbled out of the walls, screaming in the voices of the crew, luring her toward death.

Mara fired, but every explosion birthed new horrors: torsos crawling on spindly, black-boned limbs, faces folding mid-scream, eyes multiplying along twisted spines, veins glowing violet like living fire. Jet-black shards launched from limbs, impaling floors, ceilings, and walls‚Äîbut the pieces reformed, larger and hungrier.

‚ÄúKeep moving! Don‚Äôt stop!‚Äù Mara screamed. Corridors twisted impossibly, folding back into themselves. Ceilings drooled viscous flesh. The station shivered around her, alive with gnashing teeth and whispering voices.

Cho fell into the ichor. Tentacles erupted, dragging him under. His eyes were the last to vanish, wet and pleading, as black-boned jaws sprouted from the floor beneath him.

The station itself joined the hunt. Walls rippled and throbbed. Ceilings sagged into mouths. Faces emerged from metal, screaming silently, mouths leaking black-purple filth. Mara stumbled into the observation dome. Outside, no stars remained‚Äîonly writhing shadows crawling over the void.

Her own voice echoed, alien harmonics twisting her skull. Every breath tasted like ichor.

The Chilling Ending

Months later, a new crew of space force cadets docked with Station Epsilon, unaware of its history. Communications had gone silent‚Äîcut by the creatures long before. Everything looked‚Ä¶ normal.

At first, they saw shadows moving through corridors. Then they saw the crew‚Äîor what looked like crew. Faces eerily familiar. Movements slightly off. Voices correct, but wrong. Smiles too wide, laughter slightly delayed.

They walked among the ‚Äúcrew,‚Äù speaking, laughing, even gesturing for help‚Äîbut nothing was alive. The real humans were gone, their bodies long consumed, reshaped, and now worn like grotesque skins by the alien horrors inside.

The station hummed, waiting, patient. Veins of violet pulsed through walls, bones, and tendrils, all synchronized in a silent heartbeat. The cadets moved, oblivious to the wrongness around them, until the realization dawned: every face they trusted was hollow. Every voice was an echo.

By the time the cadets tried to send a message, the station‚Äôs systems had already been swallowed. No one outside would know. No one would see what walked, spoke, and smiled like the missing crew.

And deep inside the black-and-violet nightmare, Mara‚Äîor what remained of her‚Äîwatched. The station was alive, infinite, and patient. The aliens had learned to mimic perfectly now. The horror would continue, waiting for the next ship, the next faces to wear, the next voices to twist.

Outside, the void remained still. But inside, the walls still screamed.",1,1757574187.0,QuillandPen,1,1.0,False

Just wanted to share a recent win and hopefully spark some discussion about how you're automating aspects of your daily lives. I've been diving into automation lately, and the biggest impact so far has been on my morning routine.

**The Problem:**

My mornings were always a bit of a scramble. Hitting snooze too many times, rushing to get ready, forgetting things, and generally starting the day feeling stressed. Not ideal!

**My Automation Solution:**

I've set up a pretty simple (but effective) system using Tasker on Android, but I'm open to suggestions for other platforms. Here‚Äôs what it does:

*   **Wake-Up & Information:**
    *   My smart light gradually brightens starting 30 minutes before my alarm. This simulates a sunrise and is surprisingly effective at waking me up naturally.
    *   My phone reads out the weather, any upcoming calendar events for the day, and a quick summary of news headlines (using a text-to-speech app). This avoids mindless scrolling through apps first thing.
*   **Smart Coffee Maker Activation:**
    *   My smart coffee maker is automatically turned on by the routine so the coffee is ready when I'm out of bed.
*   **Music & Relaxation:**
    *   Plays a pre-selected playlist of calming music.
*   **Automated Email Summary:**
    *   A daily summary of my overnight emails is sent to a specific email. 

**Tools Used (for those curious):**

*   Android phone (Tasker, a text-to-speech app).
*   Smart light bulbs (Philips Hue).
*   Smart coffee maker.
*   IFTTT for some of the integrations.

**Results:**

My mornings are *significantly* less stressful. I feel more prepared for the day, I have more time for things I enjoy (like a relaxed breakfast!), and my overall mood has improved. This isn‚Äôt ground breaking but has made a huge difference to my well-being.

**What I'm Hoping to Discuss:**

*   What specific routines have *you* automated? I'm always looking for new ideas!
*   What platforms/tools do you find are the most reliable and user-friendly for automation?
*   Any tips for troubleshooting or improving automation setups?
*   Anyone using automation to manage their work day or handle things for a small business?
*   Do you prioritize privacy concerns when automating? If so, what measures do you take?

Let's share our knowledge and inspire each other! Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and experiences! Thanks, folks!

Let‚Äôs skip the small talk.

Life gets heavy. Nights get louder than days. And sometimes, all you want is comfort. Not advice, not solutions just that safe, quiet, warm space where you can exhale without explaining yourself.

That‚Äôs where the idea of an online cuddle buddy comes in.
Not some awkward half-baked thing. Not another flaky ‚Äúwyd lol‚Äù situation. I mean real, intentional, consistent comfort.

How It Works (Our Version of Cuddling)

Since the internet robs us of actual hugs, we get creative:

Cuddle Calls/VCs: We hop on video or voice calls, wrap ourselves in blankets, dim the lights, and just exist. You on your side of the screen, me on mine, but the energy? Shared.

Cuddle Playlists: We swap songs that feel like warm blankets. Could be lo-fi beats, soft indie, movie soundtracks, or guilty-pleasure ballads.

Silent Cuddles: Sometimes words are too much. So we just mute ourselves, stay connected, and do our own thing‚Äîreading, sketching, gaming, or staring at the ceiling. Just knowing someone‚Äôs there is enough.

Cuddle Text Sessions: Sending random ‚Äúyou good?‚Äù check-ins, comfort memes, or soft quotes. Nothing fancy, just little nudges that say: hey, you‚Äôre not alone.

Themed Nights: Pajama cuddles, tea/coffee cuddles, rainy-day sound cuddles, even chaotic ‚Äúwe‚Äôre cuddling while ranting about bad movie plots‚Äù nights.


Cuddling here isn‚Äôt about perfection. It‚Äôs about presence. About being each other‚Äôs safe pause button when life feels like it‚Äôs moving too fast or not at all.

I read comics like they‚Äôre scripture, question time like it‚Äôs a stubborn patient, and sometimes stay up at 3 a.m. just‚Ä¶ feeling everything too much.

I don‚Äôt believe in shallow connections. I‚Äôm wired for depth, for messy conversations that start with ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your comfort food?‚Äù and end with ‚Äúdo you think souls recognize each other across lifetimes?‚Äù

And yes, I‚Äôll bring chai to our cuddle sessions. Virtual chai, but still counts.


---

What I‚Äôm Looking For

Someone who gets that ‚Äúcuddling‚Äù here is about emotional warmth, not just pixel proximity.

Someone who can laugh at dumb jokes but also sit in comfortable silence.

Someone consistent not ghosting for days then reappearing like a badly written plot twist.

Someone who doesn‚Äôt need to have it all figured out, but is willing to show up, as they are.


You don‚Äôt need to be perfect. You just need to be real.


---

Why?

Because at the end of the day, we‚Äôre all just souls stumbling through chaos, craving connection that feels like home. And maybe, just maybe, an online cuddle buddy could be the weird little lifeline we didn‚Äôt know we needed.


---

So if you‚Äôre reading this and your chest feels a little warmer, or your brain goes ‚Äúsame,‚Äù send me a blanket emoji, a cozy song, or just a ‚Äúhi.‚Äù

And let‚Äôs see if two people on different screens can still create a space that feels like a hug.

Because comfort doesn‚Äôt always have to be physical.
Sometimes, it‚Äôs just knowing someone‚Äôs really there.

It was my birthday today, and I planned a spin class with a small group of friends (five of us total). One of them messaged last minute saying she wasn‚Äôt feeling well‚Äîshe‚Äôd had some coffee that made her jittery, puked, but decided to still show up. I told her she didn‚Äôt need to push herself, but she came anyway.

The spin class itself was really fun‚Äîthe instructor even gave me shout-outs and played some of my favorite songs. But afterwards, instead of acknowledging the class or the fact it was my birthday, my friend mostly talked about how awful she felt and made jokes about it. Later, she was telling another friend about how she had been ‚Äúyakking‚Äù during the ride, which kind of pulled the focus away from everything else.

After class, we grabbed dinner. She seemed zoned out, on her phone a lot, and not really present. I even said she could leave if she wasn‚Äôt feeling well and that I wouldn‚Äôt be offended, but she said, ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôll have FOMO. It‚Äôs not for you, it‚Äôs for me.‚Äù That comment rubbed me the wrong way.

She also started talking about her own birthday plans months from now, joking about how she was already planning a trip for herself while it was my birthday. At one point she forgot I had even agreed to join her trip, which made me feel unseen.

Overall, her energy just felt really flat compared to my other friends who were excited and celebratory. I left feeling a little hurt, like I wasn‚Äôt acknowledged on my own birthday.

So now I‚Äôm wondering‚Äîam I overthinking this and being too sensitive, or is it fair that I felt a little let down?",4,1757572993.0,AITAH,3,0.84,False

1ne1m5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceTalks/comments/1ne1m5s/every_moneysaving_tip_ive_learned_so_far/,Every money-saving tip I‚Äôve learned so far (realistic and actually doable),"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve been trying to save money for a while now and, after a lot of trial and error, I‚Äôve finally found a bunch of practical ways that actually help without feeling like you‚Äôre depriving yourself. Thought I‚Äôd share everything in one place, maybe it‚Äôll help someone else out there.

Here‚Äôs a list of money-saving methods that I personally use or have seen work for others. Feel free to add your tips below too.

**1. Use a High Yield Savings Account (HYSA)**

A HYSA pays higher interest than a standard savings account. Even small monthly deposits can grow significantly over time thanks to compounding. The key is consistency. For example, depositing $200 every month in a HYSA earning 4% annual interest could grow to over $10,000 in 4 years, without any extra effort beyond the monthly transfer.

**2. Track Your Spending**

You can‚Äôt manage what you don‚Äôt measure. Track every purchase, even small ones like coffee or snacks. Using apps like Mint, YNAB, or even a simple spreadsheet helps identify where money is leaking. For example, noticing that you spend $50/week on coffee might motivate you to brew at home.

**3. Make a Realistic Budget**

A budget should reflect your actual lifestyle, not some extreme savings plan. Start by allocating 10‚Äì20% of your income to savings, then categorize the rest for essentials, discretionary spending, and occasional treats. Reviewing it monthly helps you adjust based on real expenses.

**4. Build an Emergency Fund**

Unexpected expenses can wipe out your savings. A solid emergency fund - at least 3 months of living expenses - protects you from high-interest borrowing. Keep it in a separate account that‚Äôs accessible but not too easy to spend, like a HYSA.

**5. Meal Planning and Grocery Strategies**

Plan weekly meals and create a shopping list. Buying in bulk, cooking in batches, and freezing leftovers reduces grocery waste and expenses. For instance, buying a whole chicken and using it across multiple meals is cheaper than buying pre-portioned packs. Avoid shopping hungry, impulse buys spike costs.

**6. Shop Smart**

Before purchasing, compare prices online, check for cashback offers, and use coupons. Avoid buying on impulse, wait 24‚Äì48 hours for non-essential items. Even waiting a week before big-ticket items can prevent unnecessary purchases.

**7. Audit Subscriptions**

Many people pay for services they barely use. Review all subscriptions monthly, streaming services, software, gyms and cancel or pause ones that aren‚Äôt providing value. This simple step can save $50‚Äì$100 per month.

**8. Reduce Utility Bills**

Small changes add up. Turn off lights, unplug devices when not in use, and adjust heating/cooling smartly. Installing energy-efficient appliances, using timers, and sealing drafts can cut electricity and water bills significantly over time.

**9. Transportation Optimization**

Fuel, maintenance, and parking add up quickly. Walk or bike for short distances, use public transport, or carpool. Switching from driving daily to 3 days a week can save hundreds of dollars monthly.

**10. Pay Off High-Interest Debt First**

Credit card and personal loan interest compounds quickly. Focus on paying off the highest-interest debt first while maintaining minimum payments on others. This reduces overall interest paid and accelerates financial freedom.

**11. Automate Savings**

Set up auto-transfers to savings accounts or investments as soon as you receive your paycheck. Treat savings as a non-negotiable expense rather than something left over at the end of the month.

**12. Start Investing Early**

Even small amounts invested consistently grow over time. For example, investing $50 monthly in a low-cost index fund at 7% annual return can grow to $6,000 in 10 years. Starting early leverages compounding.

**13. Side Hustles for Extra Income**

Freelancing, tutoring, consulting, or selling products online can boost savings without affecting your main income. This additional cash can go directly to savings or debt repayment.

**14. Question Every Purchase**

Before buying anything, ask: Do I need this now? Can it wait? Will I regret it in a week? These questions help reduce impulse spending, which is a major contributor to budget leaks.

**15. Prioritize Health**

Eating healthy, exercising, and scheduling routine checkups prevents costly medical bills. Preventive care is often far cheaper than treatment for chronic conditions later on.

**16. Plan for Retirement Early**

Even small monthly contributions to retirement accounts grow significantly due to compounding. Starting with $50‚Äì$100/month in your 20s is much more effective than saving $200‚Äì$300/month in your 40s.

**17. Teach Kids About Money**

If you have children, involve them in budgeting and saving. Small allowances and tasks teach delayed gratification and money management early, setting them up for financial responsibility.

**18. Avoid Lifestyle Inflation**

When income increases, avoid upgrading all aspects of your lifestyle. Instead, invest or save the extra. For example, if your salary increases by $500, consider saving $300 and using $200 for discretionary spending.

**19. Review Your Finances Regularly**

Sit down every few months to assess your budget, spending patterns, and goals. Adjust based on what‚Äôs working and what isn‚Äôt. Tracking progress keeps you motivated and accountable.

**20. Buy Second-Hand or Refurbished**

Clothes, electronics, and furniture can often be purchased second-hand in excellent condition. This can save hundreds or thousands without sacrificing quality.

**21. Repair Instead of Replace**

Many appliances and electronics fail due to minor issues that are inexpensive to fix. Learning basic repairs or using local repair services extends the life of items and saves money.

**22. Energy-Efficient Appliances**

Switching to LED bulbs, energy-saving fans, and efficient refrigerators reduces electricity bills over time. Though the upfront cost is higher, payback is usually within a year or two.

**23. Grow Your Own Food**

Even small herb or vegetable gardens reduce grocery costs. Growing tomatoes, basil, or chilies at home can supplement meals and cut recurring expenses.

**24. Drink Water and Reduce Bottled Beverages**

Coffee shops, soda, and bottled drinks add up. Brewing coffee or tea at home and drinking water instead can save $50‚Äì$100 monthly.

**25. Cook in Bulk**

Batch cooking reduces food waste and saves money. Freezing portions also reduces the temptation to order takeout when short on time.

**26. DIY Personal Care**

Haircuts, manicures, facials, and skincare treatments can be done at home. Learning simple techniques reduces costs while still maintaining quality.

**27. Choose Generic Brands**

For groceries, cleaning supplies, and personal care, generic brands are often identical in quality to premium brands at a fraction of the cost.

**28. Set Spending Limits**

Give yourself a monthly allowance for discretionary expenses. This prevents overspending and helps you make conscious choices about where your money goes.

**29. Use Free or Low-Cost Entertainment**

Local parks, free events, libraries, and community centers provide entertainment at little or no cost. Learning to enjoy low-cost activities is a major savings hack.

**30. Reduce Food Waste**

Plan meals, store food properly, and use leftovers creatively. Wasting less food directly reduces your grocery bills.

**31. Negotiate Bills**

Many bills - mobile, internet, insurance - can be reduced if you ask for discounts. Call providers and inquire about lower rates or promotions.

**32. Track Recurring Charges**

Subscriptions and automatic payments can slip under the radar. Review statements monthly to avoid paying for unused services.

**33. Share Services**

Carpooling, splitting subscription services, or sharing utilities with roommates reduces costs without impacting lifestyle.

**34. Avoid ATM Fees**

Use your own bank‚Äôs ATMs or cashback options. Small fees accumulate quickly over time.

**35. Buy Off-Season**

Clothes, travel, and holiday items are significantly cheaper when purchased off-season. Planning ahead saves substantial money.

**36. Use Loyalty Programs**

Credit card points, cashback apps, and referral bonuses add up. Even small rewards accumulate over months to hundreds of dollars.

**37. Delay Impulse Purchases**

Waiting 24‚Äì48 hours before buying non-essential items reduces regret purchases and helps prioritize spending.

**38. Set Clear Savings Goals**

Whether for vacations, gadgets, or an emergency fund, having clear goals makes saving purposeful and motivating.

**39. Sell Unused Items**

Decluttering and selling electronics, clothes, or furniture generates extra cash and prevents unnecessary spending.

**40. Bundle Services**

Bundling internet, TV, or insurance can reduce monthly expenses without sacrificing service quality.

**41. Batch Cooking**

Cooking large meals at once saves both time and money, while preventing the temptation to order out.

**42. Pack Lunch**

Eating out daily is expensive. Preparing meals at home saves money and is usually healthier.

**43. Use Cash for Discretionary Spending**

Paying with cash makes overspending harder, compared to digital payments where it feels intangible.

**44. Compare Insurance Regularly**

Shop around for the best deals on health, life, or vehicle insurance. You might find cheaper options with better coverage.

**45. Maximize Tax Benefits**

Understand tax deductions and credits you‚Äôre eligible for. This reduces taxable income and keeps more money in your pocket.

**46. Freeze Credit Card Usage Temporarily**

Taking a break from credit cards can help curb unnecessary spending and reinforce budgeting habits.

**47. Wait on New Gadgets**

Prices drop after reviews and new models arrive. Waiting a few months can save hundreds on electronics.

**48. Switch to LED Lighting**

LEDs use less electricity and last longer than traditional bulbs, reducing long-term energy costs.

**49. Avoid Unnecessary Bank Fees**

Choose accounts with minimal or zero fees. Even small monthly fees add up over time.

**50. Keep Digital Notes & Lists**

Tracking what you own prevents buying duplicates, reducing unnecessary spending.

**51. Avoid Premium Convenience**

Pre-cut ingredients, express delivery, and premium services cost more. Doing these yourself saves money.

**52. Travel Smart**

Book flights and trains in advance, use apps for discounted tickets, and avoid peak pricing whenever possible.

**53. Make Your Own Beverages**

Brewing coffee or tea at home instead of buying daily coffee-shop drinks can save $50‚Äì$100 per month.

**54. No-Spend Days**

Pick a day each week to spend nothing. This habit reinforces discipline and helps identify unnecessary purchases.

**55. Know Your ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù**

Saving without purpose is hard. Identify your goals - early retirement, travel, security and let them motivate your choices.

That‚Äôs all from my side! Saving money doesn‚Äôt mean cutting all the fun out of life, it‚Äôs about making smarter choices and creating stability.

Let me know what your go-to saving tips are! Let‚Äôs share and help each other out‚Ä¶

1ne1lyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BadBunnyPR/comments/1ne1lyu/for_last_weekend_concert_goers_tips_from_my/,"For last weekend concert goers: tips from my experience at la Residencia - Pool Party, SHOES, etc.","Sitting at airport with time to kill -- here's my experience with the VIP weekend for la Residencia. 

**El Pool Pari** \- *Thurs - Sat from 7pm-1am at Vivo Beach Club*. General entry is $35 [HERE](https://www.universe.com/events/vibee-pool-party-at-vivo-beach-club-tickets-G8V46C). Included in VIP package. Reviews from across social media were mixed with folks saying the vibe was 1) ""only tourists"", 2) boring, 3) not worth it, and 4) only got good towards to end. Nothing is included with entry - you pay extra for drinks and food. 

My experience: if you bring the vibes/dance/chill in pool, you'll have a great time. If you don't engage with the music or entertainment, you'll have a mid time. My partner and I decided to have drinks at our lodging and headed over at 10:30pm so we didn't get too tired too quickly. Ended up being a great move because it had JUST got lit. Nonstop reggaeton, dembow, bachata, salsa, and merengue. I danced for 2 hours straight. We went straight to the pool where people were friendly and we vibed and danced together in the water. There's a LOT of perreo. Booty shaking in the pool, on stage, in the big screens. Warning: there is a camera man who walks around filming mostly women shaking their asses to project on two large screens for the whole party to see. It was very fun (especially when lit lol) but warning is that once or twice, women didn't realize the camera man was showing their asses - definitely unconsensual and uncomfortable to see. He eventually moved on, but just keep an eye out if you don't want to be on the big screen.

**Seguimo' Aqu√≠ Immersive Experience** \- Plaza Las Am√©ricas. VIP and Locals only from Thursday to Sunday (Vibee sends email to book reservation). Monday to Wednesday general public can make reservations [HERE](https://www.universe.com/events/seguimo-aqui-immersive-experience-tickets-4FZTXB). 

My experience: hope it's not too much of a hot take, but I'm only glad I went because the merch line at the end tends to be shorter than the public merch line. I saw that it's a cute to take pictures but as someone who doesn't post on socials much, I wasn't really interested. A TikTok walkthrough would have sufficed. I was hoping to read more about Bad Bunny's come up/background/upbringing but I didn't see anything like that. I do appreciate the description behind the endangered species El Concho and made me appreciate the awareness-raising. At the merch line, I got a vinyl and a Benito crop top. Staff were kind. If you have VIP, you can pick up your giftbag there. If you already picked it up at the Fairmont, be sure to bring your VIP lanyard to get into the speakeasy (each drink was $10-15) and comes in a cute cup you can take away. 

  
**Outside El Choli ""San Benito Festival""**

As everyone says, definitely go another day besides your concert. 4:30-5pm ish to 9:30pm ish. In addition to the free things, across the street is more food and drink options. 

My experience: I visited twice with friends and had a great time. I loved the entire concept and everyone working the activations/kiosks was kind. La casa del perreo is a must if you love to dance. Lines are crazy long so I only did the activities with short lines: free Wendy's frosty, free clear bag that's allowed into El Choli, Bandana from T-Mobile, free coffee with cheese, and a little horse gambling game (prize was a sticker I think?). I was looking for the free make up stall from L'Oreal but they no longer had it.

Tip: There is a man offering paper fans for purchase outside El Choli -- I heard through the grapevine that the large ones are not allowed inside but the small ones are.

Study and memorize. Take notes lol. Only thing I'll add is that if the elevator line is too crowded, keep going down the hall and there is another elevator you can take.

\^After reading the Reddit post above, I got in line around 4pm. 13 people were in line ahead of me. The person before me got there at 3pm and the first person got there around noon. The next person after me got in around 4:10pm. 

Make friends! Everyone had good vibes and it was fun to chat. **Useful info**: the Arena entry line is fully covered so no fear of rain dampening spirits. (I brought a cheap umbrella with me that I intended to throw out before realizing this.) The regular VIP line is fully exposed to the elements. When it started to rain, we heard that their place in line was recorded by their Vibee attendant and they could go take shelter somewhere. They have the advantage because they don't need to take an elevator, only stairs to reach the Adidas stand. 

Here's the most important tip I can give you that I haven't seen elsewhere: **the security lines are gendered.** Right as doors opened, we were divided by gender for body and bag checks. So say you are number 15 in line and you're a man -- if only 4 men are in line ahead of you, you are actually number 5 in that line. On this particular day, all the women had bags to be thoroughly inspected and the men only had some items in their pockets. So the men's line went way faster. In my case, my partner is a man and we strategically put everything except his phone in my fanny pack so he could clear security quickly. It worked and he was number \~25 in the shoe line (in fact, he went so fast he made it in line ahead of the folks who had been waiting since 12pm). By the time I made it, there were about \~50 in line. I joined him in line (don't hate, everyone else was doing it, too! and I would have gotten out if someone had said something but it seemed that no one wanted to be called out for it themselves).

Another tip I wish I knew: **they only carry men's sizes and the attendants are NOT helpful** in converting for you. I had actually gone to the Adidas store earlier that day to find my perfect size (8 womens) and didn't even think to check my size in mens. I've always had bad luck estimating sizes and they don't let you open the box to even look at its contents. Either way, my choice shoes were no longer available in my guestimated size 7, so I ended up getting the  closest options Yunques in 8. I'm between wearing them anyways or gifting them to a friend, tbd. 



**El Concierto**

Had an incredible time. I really appreciate how strict security was about everyone staying in their seats and not crowded the aisles. Great crowd control and felt safe. If you are nice to security, they are nice to you. If you are clearly drunk and acting a fool, they will not be so kind. For Arena folks, you have a cool option to walk down the stairs in the arena from floor 3 and they let you into the front yard of la Casita with your wristband. You can walk around and queue for pics.

* There is no bathroom in la Casita where the special guests and famous friends chill, so they use the same bathrooms as Arena, you can try your luck to see someone. My partner ended up seeing Bad Bunny himself transition from the main stage to La Casita during his bathroom break (didn't get a picture). This tiktok explains the area well: [https://www.tiktok.com/@babbyhorchata/video/7534988905091747103](https://www.tiktok.com/@babbyhorchata/video/7534988905091747103)

LADIES: the lines for the bathrooms were ridiculous. I know that we experience long bathroom lines everywhere we go, but for a concert that starts on time, do time your bathroom visit carefully. There was no line around 6:30pm. By 8:30pm, when I went again, we in line were all audibly considering holding it for the next three hours because the show was going to start soon. I even checked other floors for shorter bathroom lines. Nope. I was back in my seat by 8:43pm and the show started at 8:45pm. I didn't drink anything the rest of the night in order to avoid a bathroom break.

1ne1lst,https://www.reddit.com/r/aboutproctology/comments/1ne1lst/couldnt_sit_through_meetings_anymore_hemorrhoid/,Couldn't Sit Through Meetings Anymore - Hemorrhoid Surgery Success Story,"**Two years ago, I thought hemorrhoids were just something old people complained about. Boy, was I wrong.** 

I started noticing blood on toilet paper during a particularly stressful project at work. Being a 28-year-old software developer, I spent 12+ hours sitting daily, living on coffee and takeout. Ignored it for months, thinking it would go away on its own.

The bleeding got worse, then came the pain. Sitting at my desk became torture - I was constantly shifting, using cushions, and taking frequent breaks. Coworkers started asking if I was okay because I couldn't focus during meetings. The itching was maddening, especially during important client calls.

Then they started prolapsing. Having tissue hanging out that I had to push back in was my rock bottom moment. I couldn't travel for work conferences, avoided long dinners with friends, and my girlfriend was getting frustrated with my constant discomfort and mood swings.

I tried every cream, suppository, and home remedy for six months. Sitz baths became my evening routine. Some things provided temporary relief, but nothing lasted. The psychological impact was huge - I became anxious about being away from home for more than a few hours.

I finally got the courage to see a specialist when my boss mentioned my performance was slipping. The procedure itself wasn't as bad as I'd feared - done as an outpatient with minimal downtime. Recovery took about 3 weeks with careful wound care and a gradual return to normal activities.

I have been completely symptom-free for the past 8 months. I can sit through long meetings, travel for work again, and actually enjoy social activities. My only regret is waiting so long to get proper treatment instead of suffering in silence. The team at Healing Hands Clinic made the whole process much less intimidating than I'd imagined and gave me my quality of life back.

The final chapter of this ‚Äúbook‚Äù of the Nature of Federations. I really hope that everyone has enjoyed this journey with me as I know I have enjoyed that unending support from you guys. Fret not though, I will be doing a NOP2 style time jump and starting off there. In the comments I would love for everyone to talk about their favorite parts/ characters. I will be making a separate post for ideas for NOF 2 but if you want to comment suggestions here as well I am open to that.

***Memory transcription subject:*** **Dr.Sarah Rosairo, Citizen of the United Federation of Planets**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 31, 2136*

‚ÄúAre you sure this is alright, Vensa?‚Äù I asked as we walked down the well lit driveway. ‚ÄúAside from you I don‚Äôt know anybody at this party.‚Äù

Even after I got to Earth Vensa did her best to stay in contact with me to make sure I was doing alright which I found rather endearing. Despite living in one of the most populated cities on the planet I still at times found myself rather lonely, especially after my fallout with Noah and his refusal to speak with me after the attack on Earth. Apparently the attack had further cemented his distrust of any aliens and he had become somewhat of a recluse up north.

Vensa had decided to invite me to a New Years/ retirement/ end of the war/ get well soon party at the family home of one of her colleagues from Starfleet who is the grandson of Fleet Admiral Reissig. She had told me that there would be some people from the exchange program as well there and a few other invites for those in attendance to liven the place up.

‚ÄúThat's alright, I cleared it with Mika and Marline and they say the more the merrier.‚Äù Vensa said as we got closer to the wooden house. ‚ÄúThere are going to be a few people there I don‚Äôt know either. I wanted to invite you since it‚Äôs the holiday season on Earth and thought you could use the company.‚Äù

Despite it being around dinner time the sky was pitch black and there was snow falling all around us, thankfully the driveway was well lit with what looked like built in lights and clear of the fresh powder. The house itself was well lit due to exterior lights as well as the blinds being opened on the first floor windows. I could see inside a corrected Zurulian holding in their arms what looked to be a Tilfish child while talking to them. I had almost jumped when I realised at some point Vensa had draped an arm over my shoulder as we had walked, I did not mind at all and even enjoyed it. It was not long before we made it to the exquisitely carved and rather heavy looking Mahogany front door.

*Knock*

*Knock*

*Knock*

‚ÄúI‚Äôll get it!‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare! You can‚Äôt even walk without a cane and you have had a drink already! Let me get the door.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, you are finishing up dinner. I can let them in.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are holding the baby! I am the only one not doing anything right now. I will let them in.‚Äù

Vensa and I started to chuckle at the argument unfolding from within the house but we both quieted ourselves as we heard someone approach the door. After a moment or two the door opened to reveal an older Gojid man who seemed rather relaxed.

‚ÄúHello, come in.‚Äù He said warmly. ‚ÄúYou are just in time, I think Mika is finishing up the last few things before we set the table.‚Äù

Vensa and I walked inside the house through the doorway, one of the first things I noticed was the scent of cinnamon from what I assumed was a candle along with several other spices. I noticed to the right was a living room of sorts that seemed to have most of the attendants of the party at on the multiple seating arrangements. To the left I saw the dining room with a rather large dining table that looked to be made of solid black walnut along with the chairs.

‚ÄúLet me help with your coats.‚Äù The Gojid said. ‚ÄúI am Sovlin, a friend of Ad‚Ä¶ Kathryn. Apparently a rule for tonight is no titles, no Admirals, Captains or Doctors, just friends. I already got yelled at once.‚Äù

A gave off another laugh as he helped with my jacket and he placed it on the coat rack. Vensa had rather quickly taken her jacket off by herself without setting down the gift I had brought that she offered to carry for me.

‚ÄúWell, I am Sarah.‚Äù I said with a smile. ‚ÄúVesa has told me about you and your situation. I am just happy to spend the holidays with some friendly faces.‚Äù

With that we were brought into the living room where most were. On the couch were Admirals Janeway and Reissig along with Sovlin‚Äôs daughter Hania, Janeway was holding Rumi as well who seemed rather delighted with the attention he was receiving. Marline was enjoying listening to the conversations going on around the room while sipping on some sort of mixed drink. On a large chair was the Tilfish duo of Brila and Virnt who were working on a coloring book together while the Tilfish mother chatted with the Zurulian duo of Wilen and Fraysa. Sovlin had shown us around the room to make the introductions and I made some light chat with everyone.

Vensa then showed me to the kitchen so that I could say hello to our host and give the gift that I had brought. Mika I saw was slightly shorter than myself and was wearing jeans and a flannel shirt as he finished the final preparations of dinner. When he looked up and saw the Vensa was here his face lit up and gave her a hug which was returned as enthusiastically. After some hello‚Äôs I had offered my hand to him which he shook.

‚ÄúHello Mika. My name is Sarah, I am sure that Vensa has mentioned me to you.‚Äù I said with a smile. ‚ÄúI could not show up to a party without a gift and Vensa told me your favorite wine is Cabernet Sauvignon so I picked up a bottle from one of the vineyards. Hope you don‚Äôt mind.‚Äù

Mika had confirmed to me that it was quite alright and told me to put the bottle at the drink station in the dining room with the other bottle of wine and the corkscrew. As I did that Vensa had helped him set out the food to the table and then called for everyone to sit down. I had noticed that there had been placecards made for the seats and I was sitting between Vensa and Kathyrn Janeway while Mika would be sitting across from me. At the head of the table would be Marline Reissig while at the other end was a chair with no placecard but a shine of sorts instead. There was a framed photo of the Yotul named Onso, a lit candle and a vase with some white lilies in it. Propped up in the seat was a folded Starfleet uniform and comm badge that were placed within a framed display case, this was obviously a memorial place at the table for the fallen.

It did not take long for everyone to take their seats, the longest part was for Vensa to help Sovlin get the baby in his seat as he was getting somewhat grumpy. Before the food had started to get passed out Marline had tapped her glass with a spoon to get our attention and then motioned to Mika who stood up.

‚ÄúThank you all for coming here for this celebration of many things. Some of us have known one another for ages while others for a much shorter time. Regardless we are bound together though our common experiences as we move forward, forward into an age of peace.‚Äù Mika said before looking at the small shine at the end of the table. ‚ÄúSome of us were‚Ä¶ unable to make it to see that era which is upon us. While I still mourn Onso I know that he would be so angry at me for being sad right now when there is so much to do and see. So to honor his memory like he would have wanted, lets make this a night of joy. Cheers.‚Äù

‚ÄúCheers!‚Äù Said the rest of the tables as we clinked together our glasses.

As I started to eat a sampling of just about everything that was in front of me I found out that much of this holiday spread was made by hand by Mika. Apparently he had *a lot* of time and energy on his hands now that he was on leave, so he drove into town and bought most of the ingredients and replicated the ones that would have been more difficult to find. He had also gone through the trouble to make sure everything here was animal product free for our guests despite them having the gene edit reversals done. I was finishing up the cranberry-pomagranite sauce when Brila said something that piqued my interest.

‚ÄúI understand that you are on medical leave now Mika.‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúDo you know what you will be doing once you have recovered?‚Äù

Mika took a long sip of his wine as he seemed to be thinking of what to say or at least trying to figure out how to word it.

‚ÄúI have plenty of options now that the treaty of Sol has been signed. Starfleet is wanting to explore all former OAF and Arxur Dominion space for anything that they may have missed or overlooked.‚Äù He said with a smile. ‚ÄúBut for now at least I want to stay close to Earth, I am going to see if I can help out at the Utopia Planeta Shipyards on Mars. They always need and want some extra brains to help with designing new classes of ships or to improve old ones for retrofits. I may have a good idea or two floating around in my brain still.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know I used to be a science officer before I switched to the command division.‚Äù Kathyrn commented casually after a sip of her coffee that I did not remember her getting. ‚ÄúWho knows, you could some day be the captain of a ship you helped design.‚Äù

After we all shared a round of laughs everyone eventually ended up talking about how they were doing in life. Sovlin talked about how well things were going on Betazed with his children and that Hania had made such marked improvements thanks to both her speech and physical therapies. Vensa had talked about how much she was looking forward towards the rest of her leave along with Wilen and Fraysa. Brila had talked about how much Virnt was enjoying his schooling on Earth and that he was more engaged than ever, he apparently had even made a friend at school who would be coming over for a playdate sometime in the near future. I had talked about how I was still working on my application to Starfleet Academy but things were currently going well, I had also talked about being within a support group for the abductees from the archives who resettled on Earth. A group made of both Human and Arxur. That is when Marline spoke up.

‚ÄúSome of you know bits and pieces of this story and some of you may not. I expect no tears, no talking about how sorry you are, none of that.‚Äù She said as she finished her drink. ‚ÄúI have resigned from Starfleet due to my health. I have Irumodic syndrome, it is fatal and there is no cure but the symptoms are manageable to a point. After we ring into the new year I will be going to Trill to spend what limited time I have left away from my loved ones so that they remember me as I am now. I have a few months at most anyways so it's not like I am going to drag this dying thing out forever or anything. Hey Mika? Can you get me some more Rumpleminz?‚Äù

As we all sat in shock of what Marline had said Mika had indeed got her the drink. He had also disappeared and returned with dessert, a Yule Log Cake made to look like a tree branch and a giant gingerbread ‚Äúhouse‚Äù that was made to look like the *Voyager*. As we finished up dessert we kept on talking and talking even when we kept moving between the living room and solarium as it seemed as if there was always a different discussion happening in one of the rooms. *Honestly I can‚Äôt remember the last time I had this much fun at a party*.

It was nearing midnight and Hania was asleep on the couch while Rumi had crashed hard after all the excitement and was being rocked in a chair by Marline who looked so at peace. The only one of the children left awake was Virnt who was asking Mika a myriad of questions about going to Starfleet academy, apparently the young Tilfish was convinced he was going to be both the captain *and* chief engineer.

‚ÄúHey, in your time did humans do a midnight kiss to bring in the New Year?‚Äù Asked Vensa in a sly tone to me.

‚ÄúYes we did.‚Äù I replied back with a smirk, seeing what she was getting at. ‚ÄúFor good luck of course. Why do you ask?‚Äù

I could see the timer on the wall, we were less than a minute away from the beginning of a new year. A new era. It could be that I was lonely, it could be the Trill Whiskey they had me try or it could be that this lady was *really* hot but I wanted to kiss her.

‚ÄúWell, I am not one to turn down tradition.‚Äù She whispered to me. ‚ÄúEspecialy with someone like you. Anyways, it's not like my husbands will be upset or anything, jealous that I got to kiss you first perhaps. What do you say?‚Äù

*5*

*4*

*3*

‚ÄúYes‚Äù I replied with excitement.

*2*

*1*

‚ÄúHappy New years!‚Äù Came a yell came from the room.

With that Vensa had leaned down and gave a rather sweet and gentle kiss to me while I returned it in kind.

*This is the future I want*.

*Date \[standardized human time\]:January 10, 2157*

**\[Context: Speech on Nishtal of the recent acceptance of the Krakotl Alliance into the United Federation of planets\]**

‚ÄúThe United Federation of Planets was a collection of species that I had equated to a virus: something infectious that would take over everything they touched.

While I retained that feeling for ages while incarcerated in a Betazoid penal colony, over time I had a chance to reflect. I received the help I so desperately needed for the childhood trauma of seeing my father killed in front of me by an Arxur and my years I spent to my shame as an exterminator. Over the years the foundation began to chip piece by piece until one day my entire mental framework about them had collapsed.

What was this tremendous act that changed my mind you may ask? I saw on the news feed in the background a Trill woman helping up a Skivit who had tripped over the sidewalk, I know that that may not make sense to you. But in the end it was one of many acts of kindness that members of the UFP would show to anyone that had changed my world view. It was not long after that I was deemed properly rehabilitated and allowed to return to Nishtal by the review board of the penal colony. Thankfully by this time Nishtal had been deemed changed enough to be allowed to roam the stars once again and for the planetary shields to be lowered, they had even joined the Revival Alliance.

I am a changed Man, both literally and figuratively. Aside from my changed outlook on life I have also received a reversal to the gene edits as well as the corrective surgery. Myself along with many of my fellow Krakotl are no longer crippled in our bodies or shackled in our minds to our emotions as the Shadowcaste intended. After no longer being entirely focused on war we were able to look inwards and get rid of the need for the accumulation of material wealth, we became a society of scientists and artists once again. Thanks to project Chronical we have uncovered much of our history that was suppressed along with many other worlds. Nishtal was rebuilt into the golden age we are today, almost no crime, poverty and most illness have been eliminated, famine is a thing of the past. While the United Federation of Planets have followed their Prime Directive to the letter they have helped more than enough for us to have reached where we are today. The material goods they provided during out quarantine had helped us rebuild, and their existence and ideals have us something to strive towards.

While we are not the first, or second or even fifth governing body to be accepted into the Federation since the end of the war I must say it is an incredible honor to be present when it happens. It was an honor to be present when the Rexelian‚Äôs a species discovered shortly after the war, were allowed to join.

All I saw in the UFP ventures, whether through implied or outward motivations, was endless compassion. For the weak and vulnerable. For the herd anomalies. For those who‚Äôd sought forgiveness after grave insults. For those that didn‚Äôt deserve their compassion: just as those judges had spared me, despite what I‚Äôd inflicted on his kind. I couldn‚Äôt understand how it was possible, and yet their astounding empathy was all that I found. War tribunals held in Vienna issued blanket pardons for all ‚Äúchild soldiers,‚Äù much to the outrage at the time of their allies. Merchant civilians‚Äô ventures were delighted to strike up partnerships, parallel to the government‚Äôs close work with Leirn, Skalga, Colia, Khoa, and countless others.¬†

Perhaps they‚Äôd done horrific things to each other many years ago, but I could see that predators had become something else altogether. Their true selves, at the pinnacle of their advancement and the height of their power, were galactic caretakers: capable of emotion on par with the Venlil. For every OAF tenet they perverted, I couldn‚Äôt help but notice they‚Äôd ushered in a level of peace incompatible with any goals of violence. Life was better under their rule than the Kolshians or the Farsul. It was an unacceptable truth, to realize Earth would never be a spacefaring planet of domineering brutes.

And now today, I realize that within the small wave of Starfleet ships planned to ship out for deep space exploration in the near future for the first time that there will be several Krakotl on board. This is another example of the compassion of the UFP, the sheer amount of war orphans they took in after the ending of the war of the Federations. To finish my speech I will make a quote from a rather well known Starfleet Captain, Captain James Tiberious Kirk.""

**Introduction: More Than Just a Meal**

Restaurants are rarely only about food. They are about stories, emotions, and connections built around the table. Hodaya & Theo, a charming breakfast and brunch destination, is one such place. More than a restaurant, it is a symbol of love, partnership, and the beauty of blending flavors with feelings. In every dish and every detail, Hodaya & Theo express the idea that food can be both nourishment and narrative, a way to celebrate life‚Äôs sweetest moments.

**The Origins of Hodaya & Theo**

Behind every restaurant lies a story. Hodaya & Theo began as a dream shared by two individuals who wanted to build a space where love, hospitality, and creativity could meet. Their journey wasn‚Äôt simply about opening a restaurant; it was about translating their relationship into an experience guests could taste. For them, the kitchen became a stage, and each dish a performance blending personal memories, cultural heritage, and culinary ambition into something unique.

The name itself tells the story: Hodaya and Theo are not just founders but characters in a culinary narrative. Their partnership extends from life into business, showing how shared vision and passion can be expressed through food. Guests walking through the door aren‚Äôt just entering a restaurant; they are stepping into a personal story told through flavors, textures, and aromas.

**Location and Atmosphere**

The First impression of Hodaya & Theo comes not from a dish, but from the atmosphere. Nestled in a cozy corner of the city, the restaurant invites diners with warm lighting, natural textures, and a layout that feels as much like a living room as a dining hall. The design isn‚Äôt grand or intimidating; instead, it is approachable and filled with thoughtful details, flowers on the tables, handwritten menu notes, and artwork that reflects cultural roots.

Music plays softly in the background, enhancing the atmosphere without overwhelming it. Mornings here are filled with the smell of freshly brewed coffee, baked pastries, and laughter. Afternoons bring a slower, relaxed vibe where brunch stretches into conversation. This attention to the environment shows that Hodaya & Theo is not only about feeding the body but about nourishing the spirit.

**The Philosophy Behind the Food**

At the heart of Hodaya & Theo is a philosophy: food is love, and meals are best when shared. Unlike restaurants that emphasize speed or spectacle, this place focuses on intention and meaning. Recipes are carefully chosen to balance tradition with creativity, comfort with surprise. Each plate reflects a respect for ingredients, as well as the belief that food connects people across cultures and generations.

The philosophy also extends to inclusivity. The menu offers something for everyone ‚Äî whether one is seeking classic comfort dishes, lighter wellness options, or plant-based meals. By considering different dietary needs, Hodaya & Theo ensure that every guest feels welcomed, valued, and part of the community.

**Signature Dishes and Menu Highlights**

Though constantly evolving, the menu features several signature highlights that represent the restaurant‚Äôs soul. A typical brunch might begin with freshly baked bread served alongside dips made from herbs, olive oil, and spices.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

One standout dish is a fusion creation that mixes sweet and savory elements ‚Äî like shakshuka with a hint of local honey or waffles topped with za‚Äôatar and tahini cream. These imaginative pairings remind guests that Hodaya & Theo is not afraid to experiment. Coffee also plays an important role, with beans sourced from ethical roasters and prepared with precision. Drinks extend beyond coffee, offering herbal teas, fresh juices, and homemade blends that make every sip as memorable as the meals.

**Breakfast and Brunch with a Twist**

Breakfast and brunch may seem simple, but Hodaya & Theo treat them as art forms. The restaurant specializes in mornings, but not in the ordinary sense. Here, brunch is slow, celebratory, and curated to delight the senses. Plates are arranged with care, ensuring that presentation matches flavor. Seasonal ingredients play a central role, with menus shifting according to what is fresh and available.

This focus on brunch also redefines dining culture. Instead of rushing to eat, guests linger, talk, and savor. Brunch becomes a ritual ‚Äî a way to pause, reflect, and enjoy life‚Äôs moments. For many, Hodaya & Theo is not only a place to eat but also a place to reconnect with loved ones and themselves.

**Influence of Culture and Heritage**

Culture runs deep in Hodaya & Theo‚Äôs identity. The food often reflects Mediterranean and Middle Eastern influences, highlighting spices, herbs, and traditional cooking techniques passed down through generations. But the restaurant does not simply replicate; it reinvents. Classic recipes are honored while given a fresh interpretation that appeals to modern tastes.

This blending of heritage and innovation makes the menu familiar yet exciting. Guests taste the comfort of traditional dishes but also discover new layers of flavor. In this way, Hodaya & Theo becomes more than a restaurant ‚Äî it becomes a cultural bridge, sharing heritage with the wider community in a way that feels both authentic and creative.

**Customer Experience and Hospitality**

Hospitality is at the center of everything. Staff members greet guests not as strangers but as friends, often remembering names, favorite drinks, or special occasions. The service is warm without being overwhelming, professional without being distant. This balance makes dining at Hodaya & Theo feel personal.

The restaurant also understands that modern customers value more than just taste ‚Äî they value connection. Social media presence, community events, and special seasonal menus allow guests to remain engaged even beyond the dining table. In this way, Hodaya & Theo build a loyal community, not just a customer base.

**Design and Aesthetic of the Space**

The aesthetic is an extension of the restaurant‚Äôs values. Natural woods, soft textiles, and greenery dominate the interior, creating a calm and inviting space. Art pieces ‚Äî some sourced from local artists ‚Äî decorate the walls, further tying the restaurant to its community. Every detail, from the choice of cutlery to the color of the chairs, is intentional.

The design emphasizes openness and togetherness. Instead of rigid formality, tables are arranged to encourage conversation. Guests feel at home, free to linger, laugh, and enjoy. This design philosophy reinforces the restaurant‚Äôs belief that dining is not just eating, but living.

**Sustainability and Local Sourcing**

Hodaya & Theo Ingredients are sourced from local farmers and producers whenever possible, reducing environmental impact while supporting the regional economy. The kitchen minimizes waste by creative use of ingredients, ensuring that food scraps are repurposed rather than discarded.

Even the design reflects this mindset, with eco-friendly materials used in construction and decor. By aligning with sustainability, the restaurant shows responsibility not only to guests but to the planet. For customers, this adds another layer of satisfaction ‚Äî knowing that their meal supports ethical practices.

**Reception in the Community**

Since opening, Hodaya & Theo has earned praise from both locals and visitors. Word-of-mouth has been powerful, with many guests recommending the restaurant to friends and family. Reviews often note how the space feels intimate yet vibrant, striking a rare balance in the dining scene.

Community members also appreciate the restaurant‚Äôs role as more than a business. It hosts occasional events, collaborates with local suppliers, and contributes to cultural initiatives.

**Challenges and Triumphs of a Modern Restaurant**

Running a restaurant is never easy. Hodaya & Theo have faced the challenges common to the industry ‚Äî from managing costs and staffing to adapting during unpredictable times. Yet, resilience has been key. By focusing on values rather than trends, the restaurant has weathered difficulties while staying true to its mission.

Every challenge has also been a source of growth. Difficult seasons have inspired new menu innovations, creative problem-solving, and stronger ties with the community. These triumphs prove that Hodaya & Theo is not just a passion project, but a sustainable vision for the long term.

**Comparisons with Other Culinary Spaces**

In a city filled with restaurants, what makes Hodaya & Theo stand out? Unlike chains that prioritize efficiency or fine dining establishments that sometimes intimidate, Hodaya & Theo offers something balanced: authenticity, creativity, and warmth. It competes not by imitating others, but by carving its own identity branch as a story, food as love, and space as home.

Guests who visit often compare it to dining at a friend‚Äôs house, except the food is crafted with professional skill and artistic presentation. This rare combination sets Hodaya & Theo apart in the crowded culinary landscape.

**Future Vision for Hodaya & Theo**

I‚Äôm in my 40s, based in Cape Town, and lately I‚Äôve been feeling like I‚Äôm slipping in my deen.

Let‚Äôs talk about ChatGPT for a minute‚Äîhow wild is it that we have conversations with AIs that can hold their own (most of the time)? I‚Äôm still wrapping my mind around the fact that I can ask ChatGPT for everything, from cheesy pickup lines to career advice, and it won‚Äôt even judge my spelling.

Here are a few fun things I‚Äôve noticed while experimenting with ChatGPT lately:

- It has this uncanny ability to remember the context in a chat, making you feel weirdly ‚Äúheard.‚Äù
- It spits out code snippets like a magician pulling endless handkerchiefs from a hat.
- It can actually riff on dad jokes‚Äîsome groan-worthy, but a surprising number have made me laugh out loud.

How did we get from clunky chatbots to prolific, poetic, problem-solving language models in just a handful of years? That trajectory blows my mind.

But here‚Äôs the coolest part: We‚Äôre not just passive users here. With plugins, APIs, and custom workflows, our creativity is the limit. Think about it:
- ChatGPT as your brainstorming partner
- An instant tutor that never sleeps
- A writing assistant who never runs out of coffee

Every day, it feels like a new door opens. Just yesterday, ChatGPT helped me draft a cover letter...then rewrote it as a pirate, just because I was curious. Why not, right?

What‚Äôs making me genuinely excited is watching non-coders build stuff. Seriously, people are plugging ChatGPT into all sorts of stuff: daily planners, art assistants, Discord bots that actually say useful things (not just memes, I promise!).

Here are a couple of (possibly controversial?) questions I‚Äôve been thinking about:

- Can ChatGPT get ‚Äúcreative,‚Äù or is it really just remixing the world‚Äôs knowledge? Does that actually matter?
- When it comes to letting ChatGPT handle the boring/repetitive stuff in our workflows, what should we *not* automate?  
- If you had ChatGPT as your helper for any one problem in your life, what would you make it do?

I guess what I‚Äôm saying is: we‚Äôre living in the future. And it‚Äôs actually *fun*.

Let‚Äôs keep sharing wins, fails, and all the random hilarity that comes out of using ChatGPT. Would LOVE to hear your stories with it‚Äîespecially weird prompts, unexpected moments, or tiny automations that have saved you hours!

*Always invest with knowledge and DYOR. This space is full of people wanting your money so it is always good to be critical. Even if I sound extremely bullish in this post I am open for healthy discussion. Anytime I reference Dune I mean the website where you can run code to check blockchain data. Pictures are not allowed here but you can check the scripts on my page to verify my claims. Please do, because we have to keep each other sharp in the de-fi space.*

Hello Reddit.

I have been running the numbers on Kendu the past weeks with my own Dune dashboards and I am honestly blown away. What started as me double-checking if this was just another dead meme turned into me realizing this might be one of the rare setups you only see a few times in a cycle.

Kendu is different because it is not just a ticker. It is being built as a cultcoin, a brandcoin. People hold not just for price action but because they identify with it. There are already real world spinoffs like Kendu coffee, Kendu beer, Kendu energy. Holders are building brands under the umbrella. That gives it staying power when most memes fade away. Culture is the glue here.

But culture only matters if the numbers back it up. So I went to work on Dune, pulling balances, tracking wallet age, and slicing distribution. What I saw was one of the cleanest organic bases I have come across.

**Here are the key stats from my dashboards:**

* HHI score:¬†**27**¬†(more decentralized than most memes, even lower than many bluechip coins and stocks)
* Supply untouched for 0‚Äì7 days:¬†**1.88B**
* Supply untouched for 8‚Äì30 days:¬†**8.50B**
* Supply untouched for 31‚Äì90 days:¬†**38.9B**
* Supply untouched for 91‚Äì180 days:¬†**82.0B**
* Supply untouched for 181‚Äì365 days:¬†**218.1B**
* Supply untouched for 366+ days:¬†**650.4B**
* Total supply covered:¬†**\~1 trillion Kendu**
* Only around 10 percent sits in LPs or CEX wallets. The rest is held by real EOAs.

That means more than¬†**59 percent of supply has not moved in over a year**, and more than¬†**77 percent has not moved in over six months**. Weak hands are already flushed out. The float is thin and what remains is in strong hands.

The holder distribution is another piece that blew my mind. No dev stash hanging over the market. No whale cluster with the power to nuke the chart. This is real decentralization of supply, not just a buzzword.

When you put these pieces together you can literally see the Wyckoff structure playing out. Pump, dump, sideways boredom, and now a base where strong hands accumulate and the float gets tighter. Normally this is manufactured by market makers to trap people. Here it happened naturally because of the community holding. That is not something you see often.

This is why I am rotating hard into it. I have been around long enough to know that 100x setups do not just appear. Most of the time you are exit liquidity for insiders or CEX allocations. Kendu has no insider supply. If exchanges want in, they will have to buy from the market like the rest of us. That alone sets it apart in a space that is usually rigged.

Working for your bag is the only way to get ahead in crypto if you do not already have millions. I do not get seed deals or private rounds. What I do have is time to research. Running these Dune queries made me realize how different Kendu really is. The distribution is right, the supply is locked, the chart structure is textbook, and the culture is sticky. That is the recipe for a cultcoin run.

People always look back and say they wish they bought SHIB in 2020 or PEPE before listings. Truth is, almost every project is hollow. But once a cycle one or two slip through with the right mix of community, culture, and structure. From what I am seeing on-chain, Kendu might be one of those.

Yes, I am biased. Yes, I am loading heavy. Because these opportunities are rare and when you see one, you act. The data I pulled myself convinced me this is not just cope. It is what happens when a community builds a base without realizing it.

If meme rotation comes back this is exactly the kind of coin CEXes will list. The only way they can get in is by buying supply from the same market we are in. That is why I think Kendu has the chance to be the next SHIB or PEPE.

For me this is my chance to be an insider before the insiders. I want to be in before the CEXs and before the market catches up. I am hoping that with my small stack today I can be a whale tomorrow.

Security note: The Kendu contract is fully verified on CertiK Skynet. It passed through free community voting (only PEPE managed that before). All issues flagged early on were resolved, and the score now shows perfectly verified and safe. Another reason I trust loading into this project.

**TL:DR**  
*After running the Dune data on Kendu I am convinced this is the next cultcoin to watch. It has the culture side covered with community brands popping up, but the stats are what really matter. 59 percent of the supply has not moved in a year, 77 percent has not moved in six months, HHI score is 27 showing extreme decentralization, and only 10 percent sits in LPs and CEX wallets. That is the kind of holder structure you usually never see in a meme. It looks like a natural Wyckoff base forming, and I am loading in.*

Every full moon night, my Alpha mate vanishes for two hours.
Tonight, I followed him deep into the forest and into the legendary Moon Exchange.
Holding my silk nightgown, he addressed the figure behind the counter:
 ""I want to pawn six months of her lifespan.""
Then he produced my favorite lipstick:
 ""Plus three days of her youth. She'll never know the difference.""
I rushed to stop him, but he grabbed me and pinned me against the counter:
‚ÄúDarling, I can't watch Lilith coughing up blood every night.‚Äù
Then he crushed three of my fingers.
""Your little bit of pain for one day of her relief‚Äîit's nothing."" 
My heart shattered as he placed our Moon Pact ring on the counter.
The ring that once sealed our sacred bond had become nothing more than a bargaining chip.
‚ÄúShe wore this ring for ten years. Trade it for ten more years of Lilith's life.‚Äù
The Moon Goddess's silver eyes gleaming smiled and looked at me:
""Your move, sweetheart. What of his are you willing to trade away?""

""Easy, baby. It'll only hurt for a second."" 

His voice dripped with honey-sweet tenderness, just like he'd soothed me countless times over the past ten years. 

""Just breathe through it.""

""Lilith can't wait much longer. The pain in her heart and lungs is unbearable.""

Tears poured out uncontrollably, mixing with cold sweat in a chaotic mess. 

Deep inside, my wolf began howling‚Äîa broken, desperate sound that no one else could hear.

I couldn't get it‚Äîwhy could the man who made me soup yesterday, who called me his darling Thalia, now crush my fingers without a flicker of emotion, all for some she-wolf named Lilith Stormraven?

The silver scales flashed with crimson light, and the agony from my broken finger seemed to drain away, becoming just another cold commodity.

The Moon Goddess's ethereal form shimmered behind the counter, more shadow than substance, her silver eyes the only solid thing about her as she smiled that cold, knowing smile.

Gabriel released me, even carefully helping me up, cradling my trembling, mangled hand in his.

He lowered his head, gently blowing on my broken fingers, as if that could somehow blow the pain away.

""See? It won't hurt much longer."" His tone carried a bone-chilling kind of pity. ""My brave Thalia, this small price for one day without Lilith coughing up blood‚Äîit's worth it, isn't it?""

My three fingers for another woman's comfort for one day. 

He said it was worth it.

I stared at his devastatingly hands0me face so close to mine, nausea rolling through my stomach in violent waves. I wanted to scream, to tear apart that hypocritical mask, but my throat felt crushed shut. Only broken whimpers escaped.

He took off his leather jacket and wrapped it around me, his movements gentle as if handling fragile treasure, then scooped me up and carried me out of that sinister shop.

""Come back anytime,"" the Moon Goddess's voice drifted after us, soft and mocking.

Behind us, the Lunar Exchange began to fade, its ethereal walls dissolving into the misty shadows of the deep forest like it had never existed at all.

""Let's home.""

Home‚Äîthat place once filled with warmth now felt like a gilded cage.

In the truck, I curled up in the passenger seat, shaking from pain, my right hand swollen beyond recognition, waves of piercing agony shooting through me.

Gabriel drove with focus, his perfect profile almost unreal in the dashboard lights. After a long silence, he suddenly spoke, his voice eerily calm: ""Don't hate me for this, Thalia.""

""Lilith... she can't die. She became this way saving me."" His knuckles went white on the steering wheel. 

""She was my pack mate before I even met you. We were on patrol when that drunk driver ran the red light. She pushed me out of the way and took the hit instead.""

My blood turned to ice.

""The accident destroyed her wolf. She can't shift anymore‚Äîhasn't been able to for twelve years. You know what that means to us."" His voice carried that terrifying mix of explanation and justification. 

""And now her body's failing because of the damage.""

He reached over and stroked my hair, the gesture sickeningly tender. 

""You're my Luna, my mate. You understand me, don't you? You'll support me in this."" His voice dropped to that dangerous whisper. 

""I just want her to live. This is my debt to pay‚Äîwhat I owe her for saving me.""

I je//rked my head toward him, staring in complete shock. Inside me, my wolf let out a howl of pure rage and betrayal that echoed through my very bones.

This happened before he even met me! 

Why should I pay for his past? 

Because she saved you twelve years ago, you're going to destroy my life for hers? I'm your mate‚Äîwe've been together for ten years!

The words stuck in my throat, so bitter I couldn't make a sound. My heart felt crushed by an icy fist, aching and suffocating.

""You're only giving up a little time, a little health. You won't die, Thalia."" His voice stayed patient, reasonable. 

""A few months off your lifespan? Some temporary pain? You're strong‚Äîyou can handle it.""

He even smiled, though his eyes were frighteningly cold: ""But if you don't cooperate, Lilith might not make it through tomorrow. Could you live with that?""

He was making me the villain if I didn't sacrifice myself for his guilt. 

Using my love against me to pay his debts. 

The way he made it all sound so logical made me sick.

I closed my eyes as tears rolled down‚Äînot from the crushing pain in my fingers anymore, but because the place in my heart that once belonged to him was cracking apart, piece by piece.

The truck stopped. We were home. He carried me down, all the way to our bedroom, setting me gently on the bed before retrieving the first aid kit. 

With infinite patience, he cleaned my wounds, applied medicine, and bandaged my hand.

I watched his lowered eyes, long lashes casting shadows. 

Once, I'd been so intoxicated by this tenderness. 

Now, I felt only bone-deep cold.

After finishing the bandages, he leaned down and pressed a kiss to my forehead.

""Get some sleep, yeah? Stay put for me. I don't want you getting hurt again."" His tone was loving, but the warning underneath was crystal clear.

He picked up my phone and slipped it into his pocket. 

""I'll keep this safe for you.""

The bedroom door shut with a soft click, and then I heard the deadbolt slide into place. He'd actually locked me in.

Dawn crept through the windows as I curled on the bed, clutching my injured hand. 

The physical pain was nothing compared to the agony in my heart. 

I don't know how much time passed before I heard his lowered, urgent voice outside the door.

""Hey, don't worry, baby. I'm getting what we need... Yeah, I'll have enough of the medicine soon. You're going to be okay, I promise...""

Medicine.

So all those pieces of my lifespan, my health, even my pain that he'd pawned‚Äîto him, they were just medicine to save that woman. 

Just ingredients in some twisted prescription to heal the woman who really mattered.

Tears completely blurred my vision.

Ten years of marriage, and it couldn't compete with someone else's life-saving grace. 

My heart felt ready to explode from the acidic pressure.

In that moment, hatred mixed with lingering love grew like poisonous vines, wrapping around me until I could barely breathe. 

Because even knowing what he'd done‚Äîwhat he was still doing‚Äîpart of me still loved the man I thought he was.

I lay on the freezing bed, my right hand screaming with pain. Gabriel's bandages were perfect‚Äîpristine white gauze wrapped just so‚Äîbut underneath, three of my fingers were completely shattered.

Sunlight poured through the windows, but I felt like I was dying from the inside out. My whole body was drained, dizzy, like someone had ripped my soul right out of me. 

Empty.

And this was just the beginning.

Gabriel walked in carrying a bowl of rich bone broth, steam rising from the surface. He sat down and spooned some up, blowing on it gently before holding it to my lips.

""Come on, baby,"" he murmured, voice soft as silk. ""You need to eat. Got to keep that strength up.""

I turned away, bile rising in my throat. The thought of swallowing anything made me want to puke.

He sighed like I was being difficult and set the bowl aside. Then his hand slipped into his pocket and pulled out something that stopped my heart cold‚Äîmy moonstone hair clip, the delicate silver one with the rare lunar gems that caught the light. 

Mom's hair clip. 

The only piece of her I had left.

""Look what I found."" He turned it over in his fingers like he was examining some interesting trinket. The moonstone glowed faintly in the afternoon light.

""The Moon Goddess says this little beauty can buy Lilith three full nights of peaceful sleep.""

I shot up so fast my vision went black, lunging for it with my good hand. ""No! That's my mother's‚Äî""

He caught my wrist effortlessly, his grip so tight I yelped. The casual strength in his fingers could snap my bones like twigs.

""Easy there."" His voice stayed honey-sweet even as his grip tightened. 

""It's just sleep, Thalia. You can handle three rough nights. But Lilith? This might be the difference between her living or dying.""

I stared at him in complete shock, my whole body shaking. 

""How can you... Gabriel, that's all I have left of her. My mom gave me that before she‚Äî""

""I know exactly what it means to you,"" he interrupted, still using that patient, loving tone. 

""That's what makes it so valuable. Your connection to it, your memories‚Äîthat's what the Moon Goddess needs.""

He stood up, slipping the clip into his pocket like it belonged to him.

""Gabriel, please‚Äî""

""Don't make this harder than it needs to be, sweetheart."" The endearment sounded like poison. 

""You've always been my generous, selfless Luna. That's what I love about you.""

The door shut behind him with that awful click.

I collapsed back on the bed, sobs tearing through my ch//est until I could barely breathe. 

The last piece of my mother‚Äîgone. 

Traded away for hisso-called guilt.

Over the next few weeks, between each full moon, my body started falling apart. Every time Gabriel returned from those mysterious two-hour disappearances, I felt weaker. 

I'd stand up and immediately get so dizzy I'd have to grab the wall. 

Dark bruises appeared out of nowhere, purple and black marks that hurt to even look at. Sometimes my heart would race so fast I thought it might explode.

Each month when he came back, there was always something missing from our home. 

My favorite book that I'd read until the pages fell out. 

The silver bracelet from my eighteenth birthday. Items that had been there when he left, gone when he returned.

Each theft left me weaker, like he was draining my life away piece by piece.

And he always had his reasons.

""This old thing?"" He'd hold up whatever he was stealing, voice dripping with false sympathy. 

""Baby, you won't even miss it. But it could give Lilith a whole day without pain.""

When I tried to fight back‚Äîreally fight back‚Äîhe barely had to try. One shove sent me crashing into the dresser, my head cracking against the wood so hard I saw stars.

He knelt beside me, checking the blood trickling from my scalp with clinical detachment.

""Jesus, Thalia. Why do you have to be so clumsy?"" Like my injury was somehow my fault. 

""Can't you just... I don't know, read a book or something? I've got enough stress dealing with Lilith's condition.""

Something inside my che//st cracked clean in half.

Last night, fever hit me like a truck. My whole body ached like someone had beaten me with a baseball bat. I curled up under every blanket we owned, teeth chattering so hard I bit my tongue.

Gabriel came in and pressed his palm to my forehead, his expression unreadable.

Then he pulled out his phone.

""I want to show you something.""

The video made my stomach drop. Lilith lay in a hospital bed looking like a broken doll‚Äîpale skin almost translucent, coughing so violently that flecks of blood hit the camera. She looked fragile. Dying.

""See that?"" Gabriel's voice was thick with emotion, but not for me. Never for me. ""Every single cough is like a knife in my heart, Thalia. We're running out of time.""

He was using my empathy as a weapon against me.

This morning, he brought me a protein shake loaded with supplements. He stood over me until I drank every drop.

""That's my good girl,"" he said, wiping the residue from my lips with mock tenderness. ""Need to keep you functioning long enough to be useful.""

I stared at him, wondering when my mate had turned into this monster.

That afternoon, his phone rang. 

I watched his whole demeanor shift‚Äîshoulders relaxing, voice going soft and warm in a way it hadn't for me in weeks.

""Tomorrow? That's wonderful news, sweetheart... Of course you'll stay here. I've got everything ready for you.""

When he hung up, he turned to me with that familiar look‚Äîpart pity, part annoyance.

""Lilith's being discharged tomorrow. She's going to recover here.""

The words hit me like a physical blow. 

""Here? Gabriel, this is our home‚Äî""

""It's my house,"" he cut me off, voice still gentle but with steel underneath. ""And right now, she needs me more than you do.""

I scrambled to sit up, ignoring the way my vision spun. ""I'm your mate! Your Luna! We took vows‚Äî""

""And you'll honor them by helping me save the woman who gave up everything for me.

"" He moved closer, cupping my face with hands that used to feel like safety. Now they felt like shackles. 

""Be the good, selfless Luna I mated, Thalia. Don't make this about you.""

""Make this about me?"" My voice cracked. ""She's moving into our bedroom, isn't she? Into our bed?""

His silence made his answer.

""Gabriel‚Äî""

""Enough."" His patience finally snapped, voice sharp for the first time. 

""I'm done explaining myself to you. Lilith needs constant care, and I'm going to give it to her. Your job is to stay out of the way and stop making everything about your feelings.""

He yanked my phone off the nightstand, his movements rough now, the gentle facade completely dropped.

""And since you clearly can't handle this like an adult, I'll be keeping this. Can't have you calling your little friends and filling their heads with drama.""

""Gabriel, you can't‚Äî""

""I can do whatever I want. This is my pack, my territory, my house."" His eyes flashed gold as his wolf came to the surface. 

""You're my Luna, which means you do what I say. Period.""

He headed for the door, then paused.

""Lilith moves into the master bedroom tomorrow. You can take the guest room."" His voice was flat, emotionless. 

""Try not to make a scene. She's been through enough.""

The door slammed behind him. The lock clicked.

I sat there in the gathering darkness, phone gone, freedom gone, dignity gone. The silence was deafening‚Äîall I could hear was the sound of my heart shattering into a thousand pieces.

And that terrible, final sound of the lock turning.

The next afternoon, the lock clicked open.

I sat up against the headboard, watching with dead eyes as my world officially ended.

Gabriel walked in carrying his precious cargo‚Äîa woman wrapped in cashmere blankets like some fragile goddess, only her porcelain face visible. He moved like she might shatter if he breathed too hard, his expression softer than I'd seen in months.

He carried her straight into the guest room right next to our bedroom. The one I'd clearly been kicked out of.

""There we go, baby,"" his voice was pure silk. ""You're home now. I'm never leaving your side again.""

My mangled fingers pulsed with pain, a perfect reminder of just how disposable I'd become.

He didn't even acknowledge I existed.

After what felt like an hour of him fussing over her, Gabriel finally appeared in the doorway. 

His eyes landed on the untouched meal beside my bed, and his jaw clenched.

""Seriously? You didn't eat again?"" His voice was sharp, impatient. 

""What's your problem, Thalia? You want to waste away out of spite?""

I stared at him, refusing to look away. 

After a few seconds, he shifted uncomfortably, like my gaze was making him nervous.

""Lilith's still really weak, so she needs peace and quiet,"" he said, not even waiting for my response. 

""Just stay out of her way, okay? She doesn't need any extra stress right now.""

He turned to leave, then added like I was some annoying roommate, ""I'll bring you food later. Try to act like an adult.""

The door slammed. 

Within seconds, I heard his voice again through the thin walls‚Äîgentle, worried, loving.

""How are you feeling, sweetheart? Any pain? Don't worry about anything, I'll take care of you.""

All the love and attention that used to be mine now belonged to her. I felt like a ghost in my own home.

The next few days were a nightmare. Every moment felt like torment.

Sometimes I'd see Lilith wandering around the house in expensive silk pajamas, looking weak and fragile as she leaned against doorframes. 

When she spotted me, she'd give me these sweet, sympathetic smiles.

""Oh, Thalia! You look so tired, honey. Are you feeling alright?""

Before I could answer, Gabriel would showed up like he had some kind of Lilith-in-distress radar.

""What's wrong, baby? Are you dizzy again?"" His hands would flutter over her like she was made of spun glass.

""Just a little,"" she'd whisper, leaning into him. ""Maybe I shouldn't have gotten out of bed.""

""Come here, let me help you back to bed."" He'd sweep her away, shooting me a look like I'd personally caused her suffering just by existing in the same hallway.

Mealtimes were pure torment. Gabriel would spend hours preparing these elaborate healing broths‚Äîrich bone marrow stews that filled the entire house with their savory aroma. 

He'd sit beside Lilith, testing each spoonful's temperature, coaxing her to eat like she was a wounded bird.

""Just a little more, love. You need the protein to get your strength back.""

Meanwhile, I got bland chicken broth and crackers. Prison food.

I watched him feed her like she was the most precious thing on earth while I choked down flavorless liquid, and something dark started growing in my heart. 

Not heartbreak anymore. Something sharper.

""I can't,"" Lilith would sigh after three spoonfuls, pushing the bowl away with a delicate shudder. 

""I'm sorry, Gabriel. My stomach just can't handle rich food right now.""

""Of course, baby, don't push yourself."" He'd immediately stop, guilt written all over his face. ""I should have made something lighter.""

That expensive, healing broth would get tossed while I sat there with my sad crackers, watching this performance.

But the final straw came that night when I had a coughing fit. 

Just a few rough coughs from my throat being dry as sandpaper.

Gabriel burst through my door like I'd set the house on fire.

""What is wrong with you?"" His voice was low and vicious. 

""Lilith just fell asleep for the first time in days, and you're over here hacking like you've got tuberculosis!""

I looked up at him, this man I'd loved for ten years, and felt something inside me go completely cold.

""She can't handle stress, Thalia. Her body is hanging on by a thread."" His eyes were wild, desperate. 

""Can't you just... I don't know, suffer quietly? For once in your life, think about someone other than yourself!""

The words hit like physical blows. After everything he'd stolen from me, everything he'd put me through, I was the selfish one?

He stormed out, slamming the door so hard the walls shook. Seconds later, I heard him through the walls, voice gentle as a lullaby.

""Sorry, sweetheart, did the noise wake you? Shh, it's okay, just go back to sleep...""

I sat there in the darkness, and something fundamental died inside me.

The woman who'd loved Gabriel Ashcroft unconditionally? 

She was dead. 

Had died on that cold counter in the Lunar Exchange, had died with each thing he'd stolen, each casual cruelty, each moment he'd chosen her over me.

That woman had been weak. Trusting. Pathetic.

The woman sitting in this bed right now? She was something else entirely.

I listened to his soft murmurs and her contented sighs drifting through the walls, touched my still-throbbing hand, and slowly pressed my fingernails into my palm until the pain felt like clarity.

The old me was gone. 

And in her place was someone who understood exactly what needed to be done.

The opportunity came faster than I'd imagined. 

Another full moon had risen, painting everything in silver light. 

Gabriel was dealing with one of Lilith's coughing fits when he got a frantic call from her doctor. 

He rushed out to pick up some emergency medication, and in his panic, he forgot to lock my bedroom door.

I pushed it open silently. 

The house was dead quiet except for Lilith's labored breathing from the guest room. 

My heart hammered against my ribs, but not from fear anymore. 

This was cold rage mixed with something darker‚Äîthe desire for revenge.

Barefoot and silent, I slipped out into the night.

The full moon hung heavy overhead as I followed that familiar path deep into the forest. 

Just like before, the Lunar Exchange shimmered into existence through the mist‚Äîa ghostly trading post that only appeared on nights like this, when the moon was at its peak power.

I crept to the edge of the doorway and pressed myself against the shadow, hardly daring to breathe.

Gabriel was already inside.

He had his back to me, but I recognized him instantly. He was reaching into his jacket, pulling something out with careful, reverent hands. When I saw what it was, my vision went white with fury.

Our Lunar Bond Ring.

The sacred platinum band embedded with moonstone and etched with ancient wolf runes‚Äîthe ring that had bound us as mates, that glowed silver in moonlight, that let us feel each other's heartbeat across any distance. The physical symbol of everything we'd promised each other.

He was holding it like it meant nothing.

""This Lunar Bond Ring,"" Gabriel said, his voice steady and emotionless, ""for ten years of her life.""

The moonstone caught the supernatural light, pulsing once as if it knew what was happening. As if it was crying out against this betrayal.

I felt something die inside my heart. Not break‚Äîdie. 

Ten years of marriage, of believing I was his chosen mate, his Luna, his everything. 

All of it reduced to a bargaining chip for another woman's comfort.

The Moon Goddess materialized more solidly behind the counter, her ethereal form focusing as she reached for the ring. Her silver eyes gleamed with ancient knowledge as she turned it over in her ghostly fingers.

But instead of placing it on the scales, she slowly lifted her gaze toward the doorway. Toward me.

Those otherworldly eyes pierced straight through the darkness like she could see into my very soul. Her pale lips curved into that same eerie smile from weeks ago.

""Sorry, honey. Big trades work both ways.""

Gabriel whipped around, his eyes wide with shock when he saw me standing there.

""Thalia‚Äîwhat are you‚Äîhow did you‚Äî""

But the Moon Goddess wasn't interested in his stuttering. 

Her attention was focused entirely on me, and when she spoke, her voice carried the weight of ancient power.

""Your move, sweetheart. What of his are you willing to trade away?""

For the first time in months, revenge felt within reach.

Pour les √©tudiants √† Rouen, plusieurs options s‚Äôoffrent √† eux pour √©tudier dans un cadre propice √† la concentration, apr√®s les cours.

Parmi les lieux les plus recommand√©s, les biblioth√®ques restent incontournables. La biblioth√®que universitaire Simone de Beauvoir, situ√©e sur le campus de Mont-Saint-Aignan, est tr√®s pris√©e.

Les espaces de coworking √† Rouen constituent aussi une option int√©ressante pour ceux qui recherchent un environnement professionnel avec toutes les commodit√©s n√©cessaires. Le Now Coworking, install√© dans l‚Äôancien H√¥tel des Postes sur la place de la R√©publique, propose des open spaces modernes, des salles ferm√©es et une terrasse panoramique, avec une accessibilit√© jusqu‚Äô√† 22h pour certains abonnements. L‚ÄôUsine Caf√© et Coworking, rue du Renard, permet quant √† lui de travailler dans un cadre convivial avec des services comme des imprimantes et des snacks √† volont√©, jusque 19h.

Enfin, pour √©tudier en ext√©rieur lorsque le temps le permet, plusieurs parcs √† Rouen sont adapt√©s. Le Jardin des Plantes, dans le quartier Saint-Sever, offre un cadre serein avec pelouses et all√©es ombrag√©es o√π il est possible de r√©viser jusqu‚Äô√† 20h30 au printemps et en √©t√©. L‚Äôesplanade Marcel-Duchamp, proche du mus√©e des Beaux-Arts, propose un cadre plus urbain avec des espaces verts et des zones assises, parfait pour ceux qui aiment un peu d‚Äôanimation lors de leurs sessions d‚Äô√©tude.

Ces diff√©rents lieux √† Rouen combinent calme, confort et flexibilit√© d‚Äôhoraires, r√©pondant aux besoins vari√©s des √©tudiants souhaitant √©tudier efficacement en soir√©e. Que ce soit en biblioth√®que, caf√©, espace de coworking ou en plein air, chacun peut trouver un cadre adapt√© pour prolonger ses r√©visions dans de bonnes conditions.
