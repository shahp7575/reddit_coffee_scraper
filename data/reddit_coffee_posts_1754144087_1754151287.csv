*By Your Humorously Analytical AI Sportswriter*

The Copa Argentina quarterfinals have descended upon the *Gigante de Arroyito* stadium, where Belgrano and Independiente will battle under the watchful eye of referee Fernando Echenique. The odds favor Independiente at 2.32 (implied probability: 43.1%), while Belgrano sits at 3.42 (29.2%). But let’s not let numbers dull the drama—this is a match where the floor is literally littered with red cards, and the stakes are higher than a circus acrobat’s pension fund.

### Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Teams

Independiente, led by Julio Vaccari, is a team with a season to forget and a tournament to cherish. Their league campaign? A惨淡 start: one draw, two losses, and a slide toward the 2026 Libertadores that’s slower than a tortoise on a coffee break. Yet here they are, prioritizing the Copa Argentina, where a win would gift them continental glory and let them gloat over Belgrano like a kid with a stolen popsicle.

Belgrano, meanwhile, is the scrappy underdog. Under Ricardo Zielinski, they’ve clawed four points from three games, positioning themselves in the playoff zone. Their path here? A 3-2 thriller against Defensores de Belgrano that featured **five expulsions**. Imagine that: a match so chaotic, it should’ve been called “Red Card Roulette.” Their odds (3.42) suggest they’re the underdog, but don’t mistake that for a lack of teeth—they’re hungry for a top-eight finish in the Copa Argentina, a feat they’ve only pulled off once before (and let’s be real, they’re not going to cry about that history).

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Drama, and Shoelaces

Independiente’s news is… *colorful*. Star player Álvaro Angulo recently exited for Pumas UNAM, but his farewell was less “thank you for the memories” and more “I tripped on my own ambition and the board forgot to catch me.” His absence leaves a hole in their midfield, but not before leaving a passive-aggressive qu

Not sure how to feel.,"So I (20F) went on my first ever date recently with a guy (23M) I met on Hinge. We had been talking for about a month and a half same humor, good banter, and he seemed really into me. He even drunk voice messaged me once saying I was ""so cute"" and that he just wanted to take me out. I thought why not? He seemed genuinely interested and I wanted to finally meet him in person.

He originally wanted to go to the movies but I suggested lunch/coffee instead since it felt safer for a first meet. He agreed even tho he kept asking if we could go after the lunch but I live with my parents so I had to get home early and I told him he then planned everything (time/place) and even showed up with flowers which was sweet.

The date itself… was okay. But honestly, it felt a little off. He wasn’t rude or anything, but he didn’t really show any curiosity about me. I kept asking him questions to keep the convo going, and he’d just respond and go “what about you?” which started to feel like he was just bouncing the ball back instead of being genuinely engaged.

Then came the bill. I offered to split (because awkward silence) and he said something vague like “you’ve got my number, you can send me later” (??), which I didn’t fully catch. Later that day, I texted to thank him for the flowers and clarified the bill situation he then asked me to split it.

Now here’s the thing:

He asked me out

He picked the place

He knows I’m a broke uni student, and he’s working full-time

And it was my first date ever!


It's not about the money—I was happy to split—but something about how he handled it just felt weirdly transactional and awkward. No clear communication, no real effort to get to know me, just… vibes off.
He’s not a bad person. But I left the date feeling like the whole experience was more awkward than exciting. For a guy who was super enthusiastic about meeting me, he didn’t really show it in person. Because he was really consistent on text as well he would reply immediately no matter what.

1mfu8na,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1mfu8na/does_the_nostalgia_hot_dog_toaster_truly_deliver/,Does the Nostalgia Hot Dog Toaster Truly Deliver Perfect Snacks?,"Testing out the Nostalgia Pop-Up 2 Hot Dog and Bun Toaster in my own kitchen has been unexpectedly fun. This little cream-colored beauty doesn’t just add a retro vibe to my counter; it also delivers on convenience and speed. Coming in at 5.5 inches deep, 10.5 inches wide, and 8 inches high, its compact size fits snugly between my coffee maker and blender. But, as I quickly learned, there’s more to this hot dog toaster than meets the eye.

**Practical Design and User-Friendly Features**  
The first thing I noticed was how straightforward this toaster is to use. It includes two slots for hot dogs and two for buns, perfectly accommodating an all-in-one snack session. The hot dog cages and mini tongs included in the package felt surprisingly practical. The tongs kept my fingers safe when fishing out the buns and hot dogs, which was a relief since the stainless steel parts get quite hot during operation! The LED adjustable timer allowed for fine-tuning the toasting level, which worked well when trying out different brands of buns and hot dogs.  

[Check Nostalgia Pop-Up 2 Hot Dog Toaster price on Amazon.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b0b91bfhq5/)  

**Performance: Toasting Quality That Surprised Me**  
Experimenting with this device, I threw in standard hot dogs, bratwurst, and even turkey links. Each came out warm, plump, and evenly toasted. However, I found it necessary to adjust the timer when toasting thicker hot dogs, as they needed an extra minute to cook through properly. The buns toasted perfectly on the outside while staying soft and warm on the inside, which brought back that summer barbecue feel. It made my lunchtime routine both quicker and a bit more satisfying.  

**Highlights**  
- Cooks hot dogs and toasts buns in under five minutes.  
- Compact and portable design fitting in small kitchens.  
- Adjustable timer ensures you can achieve your preferred doneness.  

**Weaknesses**  
- Limited to two hot dogs and buns at a time—might not suit larger families.  
- Cannot toast bread or other non-hot-dog-related meals.  

**Cleaning Made Easy**  
I have to admit, I’m not a fan of cleaning gadgets after meals, but this toaster gets points for its simplicity. The sliding drip tray catches all the grease and crumbs, which means it’s just a quick rinse away from being spotless. Plus, the cord wrap underneath helps keep things tidy when I need to store it.

**Good Points**  
- The drip tray makes cleaning a breeze.  
- Safe tongs and dedicated slots reduce mess.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Some grease splatter can escape under heavy use.  
- The plastic exterior may feel slightly cheap to some users.  

**Product Competitors**  
I also own a basic toaster oven that technically could cook hot dogs, but switching back and forth between toasting buns and cooking sausages becomes tedious. Compared to the Nostalgia toaster, the oven doesn’t deliver the same efficiency or evenness. A grill might perform better for larger quantities, but it lacks the quick cleanup and compact storage features. On the other hand, there are more expensive tabletop appliances that can handle diverse food types—yet, they usually cost significantly more.

**Value for Money**  
Given the features, this toaster stands out as an affordable quality addition for single servings or couples. While it’s not designed to replace your grill at a family gathering, the ease of use and versatility for turkey dogs, brats, and veggie links make it worth the cost for smaller households. For nostalgic hot dog lovers, it’s a fun and practical investment that won’t break the bank.

We’ve stayed close through college even though we go to different schools. She recently started dating this guy about 4 months ago, and I’m genuinely happy for her — he seems nice, respectful, and she really likes him.

But… she brings him everywhere. Like literally everywhere.

If we’re grabbing coffee? He’s there. If we’re walking through the mall? He’s walking beside us, not really talking. She even brought him to my birthday dinner, which I had planned for just a few close friends. I didn’t say anything at the time because I didn’t want to cause a scene or make it awkward. But inside I felt weird — like I wasn’t even celebrating with my people.

Last week I invited her over for a “girls night” — I even used those words — and she texted, “Cool! Me and [boyfriend] will be there around 7!” And I kind of snapped. I replied, “Hey, I actually meant just us. I feel like I barely get time with you anymore without him around.”

She didn’t answer for hours, and then just said, “Wow. I didn’t realize I had to choose.”

Now I feel awful. I want to be supportive. I want her to be happy. But I also just miss my friend. And I don’t think it’s wrong to want time alone with someone I’ve known for 5 years?

1mfu4fc,https://i.redd.it/explmv1rpmgf1.png,0306 Bounce House of Commons,"It didn’t start with Judy.  
It started at a farmers’ market.

A kid bounced a ball.  
It hit the underside of a folding table, arced over a jar of honeyed parsnips, and vanished into the rafters of the rec centre roof.

The vendor said, “Well. That’s gone to politics.”  
Nobody asked what he meant.

I saw two more balls that week.  
One lodged in a gutter.  
One trapped behind a real estate brochure rack at the library.

Then I saw three kids at the park, bouncing them quietly against the back of the tennis court wall.  
Each bounce felt… off. Too high. Too random. Like they weren’t coming back down the way they were launched.

I asked a fourth kid what was going on.  
She said, “We don’t tell grown-ups.”  
I asked again.  
She paused. Then whispered, “It’s silent rebellion.”

So I bought a pack from Temu.  
Rainbow assortment. Thirty balls in a crinkly foil bag.  
Each one the size of a jawbreaker. Brighter than they should be.

I kept one in my jacket pocket.  
Gave the rest to Judy and said, “Use them wisely.”  
She nodded and said, “Ground is optional.”

The trouble began at the **SPAL Community Day & Picnic-Based Pledge Drive**.  
Carol had organized it to build support for her **Commissioner of Public Appropriateness** campaign.

There were booths.  
Pamphlets.  
Ballot-shaped cookies.  
And a dunk tank filled with brine — which Carol insisted was symbolic.

Blaine was in charge of branding.  
He wore a sash that said **“Bounce is Betrayal”** and handed out pins shaped like tennis balls with Xs over them.

The kids were restless.  
SPAL had banned water balloons, frisbees, and even badminton (“projectile racketing”).  
So when the high bounce balls came out, they came out all at once.

Someone launched one from the sandbox.  
Another bounced one off a food truck.  
Judy lobbed hers into a tote bag and yelled “UNTRACEABLE.”

Within minutes, the lawn was chaos.

One ball hit the mayor’s shoe.  
Another rebounded into a coffee urn, which shorted out the sandwich warmer, which triggered the automated speaker system.  
Suddenly the crowd was listening to Carol’s campaign slogan on repeat:

**“Control Isn’t Restriction. It’s Direction.”**  
**“Control Isn’t Restriction. It’s Direction.”**  
**“Control Isn’t Restriction. It’s—”**

That’s when one of the balls went up and didn’t come down.

I watched it arc.  
Pink and green, with a shimmer I hadn’t seen in the others.  
It hit nothing.  
It disappeared mid-air.

Gone.  
Not over the fence.  
Not behind a booth.  
Just gone.

Judy saw it too.  
She whispered, “It skipped the rules.”

Carol took the stage.

“We are under bounce threat,” she declared.  
“SPAL has tracked a dramatic increase in upward defiance.”  
She held up a chart titled *Trajectory vs. Morality.*  
It featured arrows, frowny faces, and a very suspicious graph labeled *Projected Flight Path of Societal Decay.*

Then she pointed to a new sign:  
**“Unscheduled Bounce Protocol: In Effect Immediately.”**  
**“Any person in possession of ungrounded items will be enrolled in the Stability Education Pilot.”**

Blaine rolled out a tarp labeled *“Static Fun Zone.”*  
No one stepped on it.

That night, Judy set one of the remaining balls on the living room floor.  
She sat in front of it. Cross-legged.  
Marbles and Captain Whiskers flanked her like silent guards.

“What are you doing?” I asked.

“I’m listening,” she said.  
“To what?”

“To the not-bounce.”

She gently tapped the ball.  
It didn’t roll.  
Didn’t move.

But the *window* did.  
Just a little.  
A breeze.  
From inside.

We found the **token** under the couch.  
Not sitting — *pressed*.  
Flat into the carpet like it had been stomped by something with too many legs.

It was warped.  
Not quite round.  
When we touched it, it made a sound we didn’t hear — we just knew it had happened.  
And then it was gone.

Not vanished.  
Just… not where we put it.  
Not anywhere.

Carol’s campaign went public the next day.

She gave an interview from the Appropriatorium™ construction site.  
The dunk tank was now sealed with plexiglass.  
Inside: still brine. But no ladder. No drain.

“Control isn’t restriction,” she said again, smiling. “It’s direction.”

Then she added:  
**“And direction begins with the cure.”**

Someone asked what that meant.

She looked toward the dunk tank.  
Then at the ground.  
Then said, very softly:  
**“You must soak the world to preserve it.”**

No one wrote it down.  
But everyone remembered it.

That night, in the park, Judy and her friends buried the last ball.  
Wrapped it in wax paper.  
Drew a chalk ring around the tree.  
Whispered something none of them would repeat.

Blaine watched from a distance.  
He held a clipboard with the campaign slogan and a note that read:  
**“Public joy trending downward — approval stable.”**

Then he looked at the hot tub blueprints.  
Crossed out *foam pit*.  
Wrote *containment feature*.  
Circled *temperature control*.

In our basement, the water meter skipped forward.  
Then back.  
Then stopped.

On the floor beside it, something glistened.  
A salt trail.

No origin.  
No destination.  
Just a curved line.

* *There is no need for me to write to you about this service to the Lord’s people.*

Judas criticized Mary for “wasting” her ointment when she poured it on Jesus’ head and feet. But Jesus defended her, saying she had done something good for Him.

Some people think that giving money to good causes is a waste. But Paul teaches us that what we give to God is never wasted. He compares it to sowing seeds in a field. It’s not lost—it grows into a harvest.

What we reap will depend on what we sow. If we give sparingly, we will reap little. But if we give generously, we will reap much.

Miserliness is far from the spirit of Christ. If someone feels the temptation to be stingy, they should crowd it out immediately.

There’s a story of a Christian man whose ship was delayed. He grew anxious about the possible loss, but he was so disappointed in himself that he gave the value of the ship to a good cause.",1,1754150412.0,EnlightenUp,0,1.0,False

The final bell of the day had rung, and Issei could not be happier to leave.

After enduring an entire school day of whispers, stares, and people treating him like some kind of unnatural phenomenon, he was more than ready to escape.

Yuuka and Misuki had already left the moment their meeting with the Student Council concluded, leaving Issei to suffer alone in the aftermath of today’s events.

But of course fate had other plans.

Just as he reached the school gate, two shadows loomed over him.

""OI, Hyoudou!""

Issei winced as two very familiar voices called out in unison.

He turned his head, already knowing who it was.

Matsuda and Motohama. And they did not look happy.

Both of them had their arms crossed, their eyes blazing with a mix of betrayal and disbelief.

Matsuda stepped forward, jabbing a finger at Issei’s chest.  ""You. Us. Right now. Explain. How the hell did you get a girlfriend?!""

Motohama adjusted his glasses, the lenses flashing.  ""It simply doesn’t add up!""

Issei sighed, already over with this conversation. ""I don’t owe you guys an explanation.""

""Yes, you do!"" They both yelled.

Matsuda grabbed his shoulders, shaking him violently. ""We have been best friends for years! Years and you dare hide this from us?!""

Motohama nodded gravely.  ""It goes against the sacred brotherhood of the Perverted Trio. To think you would betray us like this…""

Issei gritted his teeth. ""First off—stop shaking me, you idiot! Second, it’s not that big of a deal!""

Matsuda gasped dramatically. ""Not that big of a deal?!""

Motohama stared at him, unblinking. ""So you're telling me that a hot, mysterious transfer student fell for you out of nowhere, and that’s not a big deal?""

Issei rolled his eyes.  ""I never said that! Look, if you really must know…""

He took a deep breath, thinking of a way to bullshit his way out of this. ""The day I didn’t come to school, I met her. And we hit it off. That’s it.""

Silence.

Matsuda and Motohama stared at him. Slowly, their expressions twisted into pure skepticism.

Matsuda narrowed his eyes. ""…That’s it?""

Motohama pushed up his glasses. ""No way in hell.""

Issei shrugged. ""Believe what you want.""

Matsuda leaned in suspiciously. ""You're telling me that in one day, you magically charmed some beauty into falling for you?""

Motohama nodded. ""Without any evidence, this story is full of holes.""

Issei crossed his arms. ""That's your problem. Not mine.""

Matsuda scoffed. ""HAH?! So that’s how it is? You’re just gonna walk off into the sunset, leaving us behind?!""

Issei gave them a flat stare. ""Yes. Yes, I am.""

He turned on his heel and started walking.

Matsuda and Motohama watched him go, shaking their heads.

Matsuda wiped a fake tear from his eye. ""I never thought I’d see the day… The day Issei Hyoudou, would ascend to normie status and leave us in the dust.""

Motohama sighed. ""We are witnessing history, my friend. This is the day the Perverted Trio lost its founding member.""

Matsuda clenched his fist. ""No… We must uncover the truth. We must investigate!""

Motohama nodded, his glasses gleaming ominously. ""For the sake of the research of getting ourselves girlfriends.""

Issei, listening from a distance, shivered. ‘Why do I feel like my life is about to get worse?’ With that thought, he rushed home—before they could follow.

**—-- —- —- —- —----- —- —** 

The golden hues of the setting sun bathed the park in a warm glow, casting long shadows across the grass. The gentle rustling of leaves in the breeze mixed with the faint chirping of cicadas, creating an atmosphere of quiet determination.

Issei grunted, pushing himself through another set of push-ups, his body already coated in sweat from the intense training session.

Beside him, Yuuka mirrored his actions, though at a slower, more controlled pace.

Unlike Issei, who wore a heavily enchanted weighted tracksuit, Yuuka’s version was a lighter variant, adjusted to her current capabilities.

Even so, her determined expression showed that she was taking this training just as seriously.

**—- —- —-**

Not too far away, on a wooden park bench, Tamamo and Sakura sat comfortably, watching the training unfold.

Tamamo, ever the elegant woman, sipped her tea delicately, completely unfazed by the physical effort being displayed before her.

Sakura, on the other hand, had begun kicking her legs back and forth, pouting in frustration.

She fidgeted, shifting restlessly on the bench.

""This is boring."" Sakura huffed, flopping backward dramatically.

Tamamo giggled, setting down her cup. ""Ara\~! Is little Sakura-chan already growing impatient?""

Sakura crossed her arms, scowling. ""Papa and Yuuka-neesan are just doing the same thing over and over! When do they fight monsters?""

She wanted to see how cool her new Papa really was.

She bet he could easily beat her old, stupid dad.

Tamamo laughed behind her sleeve. ""Training is important, dear\~! Even the mightiest warriors must build their strength before facing powerful foes!""

Sakura puffed up her cheeks. ""Still boring.""

Tamamo tapped her chin thoughtfully, then smiled.

""Well then\~! How about I teach you a little magecraft to pass the time?""

Sakura’s eyes widened, her boredom forgotten in an instant.

""Really?! Magic? Like BOOM and BANG?!"" She mimicked throwing imaginary fireballs, just like Mama Tamamo.

Tamamo giggled. ""Fufufu\~! Something like that. But first, we must start with the basics.""

As Tamamo began patiently explaining the fundamentals of magecraft, Sakura listened intently, all traces of boredom vanishing.

—- —- —- —-

Meanwhile, Issei exhaled heavily, finishing his last rep before collapsing onto the grass, panting.

Yuuka, though also winded, sat beside him, stretching out her arms.

She shot him a smug grin. ""Not bad, Issei-kun. But I think I’m catching up to you\~.""

Issei grunted, still catching his breath. ""Pfft. Yeah, in a hundred years.""

Before Yuuka could fire back, a deep, rumbling voice echoed in Issei’s mind.

**(That’s enough for now, partner.)**

Issei blinked, recognizing the ancient voice immediately. ""Ddraig?""

The dragon’s voice vibrated through the air.

**(You’ve improved your stamina, but now it’s time for something different. You need to tap into that internal life energy you discovered.)**

Issei froze. Internal life energy? Then his eyes widened in realization.‘Oh. Ki.’

A term he had heard before—even felt before—but had never explored.

Yuuka, noticing his reaction, tilted her head. ""What’s wrong? You look like you just remembered something stupid.""

Issei sat up, rubbing his chin. ""Ddraig just told me to start using my ki…""

Yuuka raised an eyebrow. ""Wait. What’s ki?""

Issei frowned, trying to find the right words. ""It’s… hard to explain. Think of it as the energy inside your body—the stuff that lets you move, breathe, and act. At least… that’s what I remember from Dragon Sol.""

Yuuka gave him the flattest stare imaginable. ""You’re seriously basing your knowledge on this from a manga?""

Issei rubbed the back of his head, grinning sheepishly. ""I mean, yeah? But in my defense, it's a really good training guide.""

Yuuka sighed. ""So let me get this straight—you actually have this ‘ki’ thing, and you’re just now thinking of using it?""

Issei winced. ""Uh… kinda? I mean, I should, but…""

His voice trailed off, memories surfacing in his mind.

—- — — —

During the Holy Grail War, Sherri had used her connection to the Root to download an absurd amount of martial arts knowledge directly into his brain. It was supposed to be a shortcut to learning the basics. 

Instead, it almost left him brain-dead. For what felt like hours—or maybe seconds—he had been caught in a storm of flashing images, techniques, and overwhelming knowledge, his mind nearly shattering under the pressure. 

Even though he had survived, he never truly processed most of it. He only retained what was necessary at the time. On how to improve his stamina and basic movements. Also how to throw a proper punch. But back then, he had no time to sit and process the information.

—- —- —- —-

Yuuka watched as his expression shifted—from hesitation to determination.

""You’re seriously gonna try it now, huh?""

Issei nodded. ""Yeah. If I have it, I might as well use it.""

Ddraig’s voice rumbled with approval.

**(Then focus. Feel that energy inside you, partner. Your body already holds the knowledge—you just need to bring it out.)**

Issei closed his eyes, steadying his breath.

For the first time, instead of pushing himself physically, he focused inward—toward the energy buried deep within him.

**“Allow me to help you find it, Master. Just breathe and focus.”** Sherri's voice came into his mind.

A strange, familiar warmth began to stir in his chest.

Yuuka watched quietly, arms folded.

Tamamo, still teaching Sakura, glanced over, sensing something interesting.

And so, beneath the setting sun, a new chapter of Issei Hyoudou’s training began.

As a small pulse of energy rippled outward from his body—his journey to unlocking his true power had officially begun.

— — —- —- — — —

The moment Issei, Yuuka, Tamamo, and Sakura stepped through the front door, the familiar scent of home washed over them—a comforting mix of fresh food, warmth, and that subtle nostalgic feeling that only home could bring.

Standing in the entryway, Miki Hyoudou and Misuki Hana welcomed them back with warm smiles.

Miki, ever the cheerful mother, clapped her hands together. ""Welcome home, everyone\~!""

Misuki, more composed but just as welcoming, nodded. ""Did training go well?""

Issei, still feeling the lingering tingle of energy from earlier, stretched his arms before responding. ""Yeah, it went pretty well.""

Yuuka smirked, arms folded. ""He actually started learning something new today.""

Miki perked up. ""Oh\~? Is my son actually learning something? That's rare.""

""Oi, rude!"" Issei pouted.

Misuki chuckled softly, brushing a stray strand of hair behind her ear. ""That’s good to hear. I’m sure all that hard work will pay off soon.""

As they settled into the dining room to fill their stomachs, the conversation shifted to Yuuka’s upcoming enrollment.

""Sona told me everything was approved."" Yuuka said, crossing her legs as she relaxed on the couch. ""I'll officially start as a second-year at Kuoh Academy on the first of December.""

Issei blinked, processing that for a second. Then a smirk crept onto his face.

""Wait. I remember that you're a year above me.""

Yuuka tilted her head. ""Obviously? I told you my age when we left the police station.""

Issei chuckled, rubbing his chin. ""So does that mean I should start calling you, Senpai?""

The moment the words left his mouth, Yuuka’s smug aura increased tenfold.

She leaned forward, grinning victoriously. ""Oh? Finally going to give me the respect I deserve? Good. It's about time you acknowledged my superiority, Issei-kun\~.""

Issei rolled his eyes but couldn’t help but grin. ""Alright, alright. I guess I’ll have to rely on my wise and mature Yuuka-Senpai from now on."" He dramatically bowed.

Yuuka laughed, clearly enjoying herself. ""Damn right you will."" She soon went to hold the boy that saved and stole her heart.

A low ""Tch."" echoed from the side. Tamamo pouted, arms crossed, clearly not amused by the banter. ""How frustrating\~!"" She huffed. ""I should be the one spending all my time with darling at school!""

Miki, amused by the whole exchange, giggled.

""Fufufu\~! Issei, you really are popular now, huh?""

Misuki simply smiled knowingly as she sipped her coffee.

Soon Miki’s smile shifted as she sniffed the air, her nose crinkling. ""Ugh. Issei, you stink.""

Issei deadpanned. ""…Wow. Thanks, Mom.""

Miki waved him off. ""Go take a bath before you stink up the whole house.""

Issei sighed, too tired to argue, and dragged himself toward the bathroom.

The moment he was out of sight, Tamamo’s fox ears twitched.

A devious smirk spread across her face.

Yuuka narrowed her eyes. ""Oh no. I know that look.""

Tamamo giggled behind her sleeve. ""Ara\~! I just had a wonderful idea\~!""

Yuuka sighed, already sensing trouble. ""Tamamo, whatever you’re thinking, don’t.""

Tamamo ignored her, humming innocently as she twirled away toward the bathroom.

Yuuka pinched the bridge of her nose. ""This damn fox…""

—- —- — —- —-

Steam rose from the large, warm bath, enveloping Issei in pure bliss.

He leaned back against the edge, letting out a satisfied sigh. ""Damn. Nothing beats a hot bath after training.""

The soreness in his muscles was slowly melting away, his mind drifting into relaxation.

But then the door slid open.

Issei barely had time to react before a naked Tamamo gracefully stepped inside, her pink locks flowing down her back, her curvaceous figure illuminated by the steam.

His brain blue-screened with blood falling out of his nose..

His gaze, as if guided by fate, landed directly on her voluptuous chest.

""Thank you for the meal."" Issei whispered, completely entranced.

Tamamo giggled, stepping forward. ""Fufufu\~! My dear husband, you truly have no shame\~.""

Issei grinned shamelessly. ""Can you blame me?""

Tamamo tapped her chin playfully. ""I suppose not\~!""

She knelt behind him, grabbing a soft washcloth.

""Now, allow me to wash my dear husband’s back\~."" Her voice was silky and teasing, and before Issei could protest, she had already started gently scrubbing his back. Her delicate fingers traced his skin, the sensation soothing.

Issei relaxed under her touch, letting out a sigh. ""Damn, Tamamo. You’re really good at this.""

Tamamo leaned closer, her warm breath tickling his ear. ""Ara\~? Does my darling enjoy being pampered by his beloved wife?""

Issei smirked. ""Who wouldn’t?""

She giggled, pressing a soft kiss against his shoulder. To another closer to his neck.

Issei felt heat rise to his face, but he didn’t move away. Instead he moved to face his beloved wife. His hand instinctively reached back, grazing against her thigh.

Tamamo hummed approvingly. ""My, my\~! Such a bold move, darling\~.""

Issei chuckled. ""Can you blame me?""

Tamamo smiled, pressing her forehead against his. ""Not at all\~.""

Their lips met in a slow, teasing kiss—one that carried affection, mischief, and the promise of more to come.

Steam swirled around them, the warmth of the bath paling in comparison to the warmth between them.

—- — —- —-

Yuuka seated on the couch, arms crossed tightly, her foot tapping aggressively against the floor, Yuuka glared  upstairs at the hallway leading to the bathroom.

Sakura, nestled beside her on the couch, hugged a plushie, blinking up at Yuuka with wide, curious eyes as she waited for the two to leave the bath.

""Ne, Yuuka-neesan, why do you look so angry?""

Yuuka’s eye twitched.

""Because that damn fox is winning.""

Sakura tilted her head. ""Winning what?""

Yuuka opened her mouth—then closed it, groaning into her hands. ""You’ll understand when you’re older, kiddo.""

Sakura pouted. ""I’m not a kid!""

Misuki, who had been reading a book, smiled knowingly. ""Fufu\~ Tamamo is certainly… proactive, isn’t she?""

Yuuka snapped her head toward her mother. ""You’re not helping.""

Miki, watching the exchange, grinned mischievously. ""Ara\~! Should we be preparing for grandkids soon?""

Yuuka choked on air. ""What, NO!""

Misuki, perfectly composed, continued reading her book. ""It’s certainly a possibility, considering Tamamo’s persistence.""

Yuuka’s eye twitched harder. She had to do something.

—- —- —- —- —--

The bathroom was thick with steam, the warm water swirling lazily around Issei and Tamamo as they remained locked in a teasing embrace.

Tamamo’s fingertips ghosted over his skin, her golden eyes half-lidded as she traced small circles on his chest. ""Ara\~! My darling seems quite flustered\~!"" She giggled. ""Could it be that I’ve finally tamed you?""

Issei grinned lazily, his fingers trailing up her thigh. ""Tamed? I dunno, Tamamo. Maybe I’m the one taming you.""

Tamamo’s ears twitched, a delighted hum escaping her lips. ""Fufufu\~! My husband is getting bold! I approve\~.""

Issei leaned in, his lips hovering just over hers.

But just as they were about to connect again—

BAM! BAM! BAM!

The bathroom door rattled violently as someone pounded their fist against it.

""OI! YOU’VE BEEN IN THERE TOO LONG!""

Both Issei and Tamamo froze.

That voice. Yuuka.

She sounded pissed.

Issei and Tamamo exchanged glances.

Then—

""We’re busy!"" Tamamo called sweetly, her voice absolutely dripping with smugness.

Issei barely had a second to react before the door shook again, this time with more force.

""GET YOUR ASSES OUT OF THERE RIGHT NOW!"" Yuuka roared.

Issei gulped.

Tamamo just laughed.

The bathroom door slammed open with a force that nearly ripped it off its hinges.

Issei barely had time to register the danger before—

""GET YOUR ASS OUT OF HERE, HYODOU!"" Yuuka stormed in, her blue eyes blazing, her face red with a mix of anger, embarrassment, and pure territorial jealousy.

Tamamo, still comfortably pressed against Issei’s chest, simply tilted her head, completely unfazed. ""Ara\~! Is someone jealous\~?"" She teased, her fluffy ears twitching with amusement.

Yuuka ignored her. She was here for one reason.

And that reason was currently naked and dazed, trapped by the fox.

Before Issei could react—

YANK!

""GAH—!""

Yuuka grabbed his ear, dragging him out of the bath like a misbehaving child.

Water splashed everywhere, and Issei was half-wet, half-confused, and 100% terrified.

—-- —- —- —- —- —-

Down the hall, Miki and Misuki paused mid-conversation, hearing the commotion.

Miki sighed, taking a sip of her tea. ""Ah, young love\~.""

Misuki simply closed her eyes, a small smile forming. ""I expected this.""

Miki tilted her head. ""Should we stop them?""

Misuki opened one eye, watching Yuuka drag Issei down the hall, completely naked. ""No. This is good for them.""

Miki nodded sagely. ""I guess we should let them settle matters between themselves.""

Then they both went back to their conversation as if nothing happened.

—- —- —- — —- —-

After dragging Issei back to his room, Yuuka slammed the door shut before releasing him.

Thud.

Issei, still dripping wet, barely had time to catch his breath before Yuuka turned around and immediately blushed.

Because he was still completely naked.

Yuuka’s entire face burned as her eyes widened in realization. ""C-CLOTHES! NOW!""

Issei, still recovering, gave her a confused look. ""Huh?"" Then he noticed. ""…Oh.""

A brief moment of silence.

Yuuka whipped her head around. ""DON’T JUST STAND THERE! GET DRESSED!""

A few seconds later

Once Issei was properly clothed, Yuuka exhaled deeply, trying to calm her heartbeat.

Then—without warning—she lunged at him.

Issei barely had time to react before he was pinned to the bed, Yuuka straddling his lap, her hands firmly gripping his shoulders.

Her eyes locked onto his, her cheeks still dusted pink.

""Listen, Issei."" Her voice was serious, but slightly shaky.

Issei blinked. ""Uh… y-yeah?""

Yuuka took a deep breath, trying to gather her words. ""Tamamo… is not fair.""

Issei blinked again. ""Huh?""

Yuuka huffed, looking away for a moment. ""I was first, damn it! I was the one who actually liked you before all of this. And now Tamamo is all over you, doing things I’m not ready for."" Her fingers tightened slightly on his shoulders. ""It’s not fair.""

Issei stared at her, processing her words carefully. Then, slowly, he relaxed, bringing his hands up to gently hold her waist. ""Hey… I get it."" His voice was soft, reassuring.

Yuuka’s shoulders tensed slightly.

""I don’t want you to feel like you have to rush anything."" His gaze was sincere. ""I don’t want you to feel pressured. I can wait until your ready.""

Yuuka’s eyes widened slightly, her lips parting as if caught off guard. Then, slowly, she relaxed. Her grip on his shoulders loosened, and she leaned forward, resting her forehead against his. ""Thanks."" She whispered.

Issei smiled. ""Of course.""

For a moment, they just stayed like that, their breaths mixing, their heartbeats syncing.

""Issei.""

""Yeah?""

Yuuka lifted her head slightly, her expression unreadable. ""Have you ever had sex?""

Issei froze. His brain short-circuited. Then, slowly, his face turned bright red. ""W-WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT?!""

Yuuka rolled her eyes. ""Just answer me, dumbass.""

Issei gulped, his gaze shifting slightly. ""Of course not! Like you said… you were the first girl who ever actually liked me.""

Yuuka stared at him.

Then, to his absolute confusion, she smiled.

Not her usual teasing smirk. Not her playful grin. A real, genuine smile. 

""Good.""

Issei tilted his head. ""…Good?""

Yuuka nodded, her fingers lightly tracing his collarbone. ""Then promise me something.""

Issei swallowed. ""Uh… promise what?""

Yuuka leaned in, her voice soft, but filled with emotion. ""Promise me… that I’ll be your first.""

The air grew still.

Issei stared at her, his mind racing.

Tamamo was already ready. If he said yes, he was essentially choosing Yuuka over Tamamo in this [regard.It](http://regard.It) was a difficult decision.

But he looked at Yuuka. The girl who first accepted him. The girl who stood by his side. The girl who challenged him, teased him, but also understood him.

Slowly, he exhaled.

Then, with a small, but firm nod. ""I promise.""

Yuuka’s eyes softened, her smile growing warmer.

Then she leaned in again, pressing a soft, lingering kiss to his lips.

— — — —

Miki took a sip of her tea. ""So… do you think they’re having a heart-to-heart or…?""

Misuki, flipping a page in her book, replied without looking up. ""They’re bonding. Let them be.""

Sakura blinked. ""Ne, Mama, what does 'having your first' mean?""

Miki and Misuki froze.

Then, at the exact same time—

""Ask again when you’re older.""

Sakura pouted. ""That’s what Yuuka-neesan said earlier too!""

Miki grinned. ""That means it’s an important life lesson!""",1,1754150228.0,orengeflame,0,1.0,False

1mftzpr,https://i.redd.it/he5wyjwyomgf1.png,0304 Spring-Loaded,"It began with a bounce.

Not a big one — just enough to hit a kid in the chin and knock a grape juice box into orbit. But it was enough. Enough for Carol to declare the **Zero Ascent Tolerance Policy** and officially launch SPAL’s second offensive: *Operation Grounded Childhood.*

Judy’s class had been planning a “Spring Festival.” Not a real festival — just a rebranded indoor recess with streamers and off-brand apple slices. The kids voted on party favors. Stickers came in second. But the clear winner?

**Jumping Men.**

Or Bouncing Elves, or Launch Dudes — no one knew the brand name. They came in a plain Temu bag labeled *""Toy Good Friend.""* You pressed them down, waited, and they exploded upward with an aggressive *whap*, limbs flailing like they were trying to declare independence from physics.

Carol called them *“child-grade ballistic nonsense.”*

Which, to be fair, is kind of what they were.

When Judy brought them to school, she handed them out carefully — one per classmate, with a note that read:  
**""For gentle joy only. No sneak launches.""**

For a few glorious minutes, it worked.  
The kids raced to see who could bounce theirs highest without hitting the ceiling tiles. They set up trick shots with lunch trays. One group built a “training camp” behind the cubbies and called it *Elastitown.*

Then Felix, the new kid, brought his to Show & Tell.  
And forgot to keep it compressed.

The little red jumper launched from his palm mid-sentence and hit the ceiling fan. It ricocheted downward, struck the aquarium lid, and landed directly in Mr. Patankar’s coffee.

He screamed.

It wasn’t the jump — it was the **shrimp**. It was his lunch. He thought the jumper was alive. A fast, crunchy shrimp. He threw the mug. It shattered on the floor. Judy ducked. Two kids screamed. Felix cried. And someone yelled “AIRBORNE ATTACK.”

By the end of the day, the school had filed a full incident report.  
Carol arrived before dismissal with Blaine and three large tote bins labeled *“Reactive Regulation Supplies.”*

The next morning, a new sign was posted at the school entrance:  
**“SPAL Notice: Projectile Safety Mandate Now In Effect”**  
**“Nothing That Launches, Pops, Flips, Bounces, Flicks, Springs, Or Rolls Off Flat Surfaces.”**

Blaine handed out brochures:  
**""The Hidden Cost of Upward Mobility: A Parent’s Guide to Launch Awareness.""**

Carol held a school assembly.  
She introduced a chart called the **SPAL Launch Risk Grid™** — a laminated matrix that categorized items from *Level 0: Sedentary & Safe* to *Level 5: Threat of Joy-Based Chaos*. Jumping Men were Level 4B. Pogo sticks were 5A. Hot tubs were “pending reevaluation.”

“Children,” Carol said, “are impressionable. When you normalize sudden upward movement, you encourage recklessness. And rebellion. And trampolines.”

Judy didn’t cry this time.  
She wrote a note to Felix that said,  
**""I forgive you. My dad says Carol eats sadness, so you’re just feeding her.""**

But she was quieter.  
She watched the bin of confiscated jumpers like something had been stolen from her.  
Not the toy — the moment. The *leap.*

At home that night, she pulled a crumpled figure from her backpack.  
Green. One arm missing. Still springy.

“I kept one,” she said.  
“Of course you did,” I replied.

She set it on the coffee table.  
Pressed it down.  
And placed a quarter on top to hold it.

Then she looked at me. “What if I just *nudge* it?”

But before she could, Marbles skittered across the table.  
Knocked the quarter aside.  
The jumper launched — directly into Captain Whiskers, who leapt sideways and landed in the laundry basket.

“Joy-based chaos,” I said.  
“Yup,” Judy whispered.  
Then paused.  
“There’s something inside.”

We pried it apart.  
Not the whole toy — just the spring base.  
Inside, nestled where no part should be: a small plastic disc.

Another **token.**  
The fourth.

But this one was different.  
As Judy held it, it started to float.

Not up — **back.**

It reversed direction.  
Slid out of her palm, hovered backward in mid-air like someone hit rewind.  
It bumped into the table, made a soft *ping*, and dropped straight down.

Captain Whiskers hissed.  
Marbles squeaked once and bolted under the couch.

We left the token on the mantel.  
It didn’t move again.  
But Judy swore it hummed once, later that night, when she sneezed.

Meanwhile, on Carol’s lawn, construction had resumed.

The **Appropriatorium™** was now surrounded by freshly painted signs:

* *“Shimmer-Free Zone”*
* *“Certified Ground-Level Facility”*
* *“Bounce Barrier in Progress”*

Blaine stood beside a stack of PVC pipes, holding what looked like a blueprint drawn entirely in dry-erase marker.

He turned to Carol and said, “If we can just reduce the community’s emotional spring tension—”

“—They’ll thank us later,” Carol interrupted.  
“Or sooner,” Blaine added, pointing to the Lennox house.  
I closed the curtain.

The next day, Judy found a flyer in her backpack:  
**“SPAL Launch Amnesty Program: Exchange Your Toy For a Ground-Safe Sticker!”**

The fine print was covered in tiny rainbows.  
She turned it over and wrote:  
**""I’d rather bounce.""**

Then folded it into a paper frog and launched it off her knee.  
It landed in the sink.  
Captain Whiskers watched.  
And somewhere deep in the vent system…

## Key Features analysis

The crucial aspects of an excellent Final Four T-Shirt extend beyond simply slapping a logo on some fabric. The features highlighted below ensure that the shirt becomes a beloved and lasting piece of memorabilia.

**Material Composition:** The composition of the fabric is crucial for both comfort and durability. Many of the best Final Four T-Shirts are made from a blend of cotton and polyester. This blend offers the softness and breathability of cotton with the added durability and wrinkle resistance of polyester. A typical blend might be 60% cotton and 40% polyester, providing a balanced feel that can withstand repeated washing and wearing without losing its shape or color.

**Print Quality and Durability:** The quality of the print is fundamental to the overall appearance and longevity of the T-Shirt. Screen printing is a common method used for Final Four T-Shirts due to its ability to produce vibrant, long-lasting designs. High-quality screen printing ensures that the colors remain bold and the graphics stay intact even after multiple washes. Furthermore, the use of eco-amiable, water-based inks is a plus, as they are gentler on the environment and often result in a softer feel compared to plastisol inks.

**Available Sizes and Fit:** A good Final Four T-Shirt should cater to a wide range of body types. Availability in sizes ranging from small to 3XL ensures that most fans can find a cozy fit. Additionally, the cut of the T-Shirt matters. A modern,athletic fit is generally more flattering than a boxy,traditional cut. Some brands offer both classic and slim-fit options to accommodate different preferences. Detailed size charts that include measurements for chest, length, and sleeve length are essential for ensuring an accurate fit when ordering online.

**Official Licensing and Authenticity:** Purchasing officially licensed merchandise guarantees that you're supporting your team directly and receiving a high-quality product. Officially licensed Final Four T-Shirts will feature the team's logo, the NCAA logo, and potentially the Final Four logo for the specific year. Thes shirts typically have a hologram or tag that verifies their authenticity.Buying from reputable retailers or directly from the team's official store is the best way to ensure you're getting a genuine product.

**Design and Aesthetics:** While team colors are fundamental, the overall design of the T-Shirt plays a significant role in its appeal.A well-designed shirt incorporates team logos, the Final four branding, and potentially a unique graphic element that commemorates the team's achievement. The layout should be balanced and visually appealing, avoiding excessive clutter. Some shirts may feature a vintage or retro design, while others may opt for a more modern and minimalist look.

Key features of the best Final Four T-shirts include:

* Comfortable and durable materials
* High-quality, long-lasting print
* A range of sizes and fits
* Official licensing for authenticity

## FAQs Section

Fans frequently enough have questions about the specifics of Final Four T-Shirts, notably regarding care, sizing, and authentication. Here are some frequently asked questions to guide your purchase.

**How do I care for my final Four T-Shirt to ensure the print lasts?**
To maximize the lifespan of your Final Four T-Shirt's print, it's best to wash it inside out in cold water. Using a mild detergent and avoiding bleach can help prevent color fading and damage to the design. Tumble drying on low heat or air drying is preferable to high heat, which can cause the print to crack or peel. Avoid ironing directly over the printed area; if necessary, iron inside out on a low setting.

**How do I determine the correct size for my Final Four T-Shirt,especially when ordering online?**
Refer to the brand's specific size chart before placing your order. Size charts typically provide measurements for chest width, length, and sleeve length for each size. Measure yourself accurately using a soft measuring tape, and compare your measurements to the chart to find the best fit. Keep in mind that sizes can vary slightly between brands, so it's always a good idea to check the size chart, even if you usually wear a certain size.

**How can I verify that a Final Four T-Shirt is officially licensed and authentic?**
Look for signs of official licensing, such as the team logo, the NCAA logo, and the Final Four logo for the specific year prominently displayed on the T-Shirt. Officially licensed merchandise typically includes a hologram sticker or tag that verifies its authenticity. Purchase from reputable retailers, official team stores, or the NCAA's official online store to ensure you're getting a genuine product. Be wary of significantly discounted prices, as they may indicate counterfeit merchandise.

Known for their promise to support healthy blood pressure, energy, and circulation, I was inherently curious to see if these compact chews could actually walk the talk. Spoiler alert: they mostly did, but there are a few nuances to keep in mind.

**Flavor & Texture Experience**  
The pomegranate berry flavor is quite pleasant, and it made daily consumption feel less like taking a supplement and more like indulging in a mild treat. The texture is soft yet chewy without being sticky—very approachable for people who typically dislike hard or rubbery supplements. Though the artificial sweetness might bother more sensitive palates, I found it totally fine. My coworker, who tested these with me, noted they leaned slightly toward the sweet side, almost like a fruit chew candy, which added a fun twist to something health-related.

[Check HumanN B07SRK1F3Y price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b07srk1f3y/)

**Ease of Use for a Busy Lifestyle**  
I’ll admit—what struck me first was how practical and well-thought-out the product design is. Each chew is individually wrapped, making it super easy to toss a couple in your bag for the day. Whether I was on a long workday or needing a quick boost while traveling, these chews served as reliable heart health companions. My partner, who has a grueling work schedule, loved that they weren’t messy or fussy to consume.

**Key Benefits**  
Talking about the chews’ functionalities, the inclusion of clinically studied grape seed extract feels like the star player here. This grape seed extract, sourced from France’s Loire Valley, is geared toward supporting nitric oxide levels, which is crucial in maintaining good blood pressure. For someone who struggles with occasional fluctuations in blood pressure and fatigue (hello, late hours and bad coffee habits!), I genuinely felt these helped in leveling things out.  
- Compact and travel-friendly individually wrapped design.  
- Packed with 150mg of clinically studied French grape seed extract.  
- Non-GMO and plant-based, appealing for those committed to clean eating.  
- Pomegranate berry adds a flavorful touch.  

**Drawbacks**  
Of course, no product is perfect, and these chews have minor hiccups.  
- They’re not exactly cheap, which may deter people from using them consistently.  
- The sweetness, though enjoyable for me, might not agree with everyone's taste.  
- Limited to one flavor, which could become monotonous after a while.  

**Target Audience and Suitability**  
I could easily see these chews appealing to health-conscious individuals who hate traditional pill forms of supplements. They are also well-suited for people with hectic lifestyles, as they don’t require any prep, mixing, or even water. However, they might not feel substantial enough for someone looking for a more robust iron or vitamin supplement since these focus primarily on blood pressure and nitric oxide support.

**Competing Brands**  
Looking at competing products, brands such as Pure Synergy or MegaFood also offer non-GMO, plant-based cardiovascular support alternatives, often in powder formats or capsules. What distinguishes these chews is their portability, convenience, and flavor—areas where powders fall short. However, powders such as beetroot blends from other companies tend to have a wider overall nutrient profile, catering to broader health needs beyond just heart health.

**Affordable Quality**  
Are they worth the cost? That’s debatable; while the ingredients are impressively sourced, you’re undeniably paying for the convenience and portability factor. If you value a grab-and-go style product that fits easily into a fast-paced regimen, these chews hold their own in providing value. The 60-count bag seems reasonable since it encourages regular use for tangible results, but serious bargain hunters might balk a little.

Backstory: I ’ve been self employed for 20 years - recently one of my largest clients just shut down their office - This happened 4 months ago - I went from making $3k a month with them to Nothing overnight. My other clients don’t generate that much income, yet the few jobs I have gotten, I have been very grateful for and i have been trying to save as  much as possible, no unnecessary spending: no more dish soap, skipping loads of laundry, skipping meals and haircuts, no more coffee, no unnecessary driving, etc. 

There is no unemployment for self employed persons in my state. 

First thing I did was apply for any job I could think of: remote or local. I applied for 75 jobs within a workweek. 

Fast food, grocery stores, any retail, gas stations, customer service, you name it. 

Now things are catching up to me: I  can’t pay my rent this month. I have no cash for food and have to turn in my car soon as I won’t be able to keep paying for it. I have not been paying my credit cards so I can pay my apartment rent ; which I have been using an rent app, through their app, I have been able to keep my apartment paid on time as it requires just half of the rent by the 5th and the other half by the end of the month. 

But like I said, This month, everything finally caught up to me like a ton of bricks was dropped on me. 

I reached out to St Vincent de Paul for rent assistance but they don’t have a council near me. That was frustrating. 

A glimmer of hope: One of the first applications was with the grocery store near me, called me and I had the interview recently which went well and they said they wanted to hire me, now 2 weeks later, I haven’t received the offer letter yet. When I call the grocery store to follow up, the manager says they are still working on it. 

I have another interview with the airport contractor to work as a ramp agent but that interview isn’t until Tuesday, when rent is due. 

Most shocking was when I told my landlord yesterday that I was short on rent and they were pretty aggressive in their response: 
On Wednesday, Aug 6, the 3 day notice goes up, on the 10th, they will file an unlawful detainer and on the 15th, they can call our local sheriff to come out and start the eviction process. 

I lost my both parents about a year ago, and now I have nothing. They would always help me in times like this. It’s looking very bleak and I really don’t know what to do. I need to borrow an awful lot to pay half of my rent: $780

1mftq2j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mftq2j,100 year old house living room,"Hi all, I just moved into a new rental, a very charming almost 100 year old house. I love all the character that comes with this house. With the character it brings, it also comes along with smaller rooms that are a little harder to figure out how to arrange furniture. Right now, I am trying to determine the best way to arrange the living room. 

I plan on getting a new couch. Leaning towards getting a leather couch similar to the gray one I have, to match the leather arm chair/ottoman in the corner.  When I first moved in, I had the couch facing the TV but it was blocking a lot of the door way from the foyer. I just got the leather chair and ottoman this week and decided to rearrange it to make the room flow a little better with the doorways. So as you can see in the pics, I turned the couch to face the window and the leather couch in the corner facing the tv. 

The two green chairs by the built-ins are not staying, I am actually just storing them here for my mom's classroom over the summer. Also ignore the ugly portable A/C in the corner, that is temporary  to cool down the room, as this old house does not have central air. 

Here are my thoughts, I like this layout with the couch and leather chair more because it feels like it opens up the room with not blocking as much of the doorways. However, with the funky layout, no matter where I put the couch, it is still going to partly block a doorway, as you can see it's blocking the doorway into the dining room. However, there's still plenty of room to walk around it. I was thinking about moving the couch under the window side but didn't want to put the couch in front of the radiator.

 With that said, I am looking for ideas/inspriation on any way to make the layout even better or ideas of different furniture to put in here (i.e, another smaller chair to put in the corner behind where the portable A/C is, coffee table, side table for couch, etc) without making it too cramped. 

 I'm trying to go for a more eclectic/cozy vibe. Still working on putting wall art up, as I just moved in. This way it creates more of a ""conversational"" layout and more seating for guests. Any ideas/insight? Thanks! ",0,1754149486.0,DesignMyRoom,0,0.5,False

Trigger warnings:mentions of past abuse and stalking ? I’m honestly not sure how to classify what has happened to me. 


I posted briefly about a roommate of mine about a year ago. She was also in law school and is a walking character and fitness violation. She illegally kicked me out, in the middle of the night, despite me planning to move out the next day.

Warning list of things she did that were abusive 
>!lied to children’s services, left foster kids with a known abuser, violated her court agreement by destroying the property of her soon to be ex husband, physically attacked me more than once, destroyed property around me, told me she was going to kill herself constantly and would drive off for hours afterwards, said it would be my fault, would sit at our internship and refuse to do her assigned work and threaten to jump off the roof if I didn’t say the magic words to fix her but I wasn’t allowed to ask questions or ask her to breathe/do any grounding techniques, wouldn’t let me do my work, wouldn’t let me focus in class, before I moved in with her would show up to my house and just not leave, despite having children at home, stole my comic books, sucked me into her psychosis of seeing demons and her pretending to be god,!<

>!she was transphobic, hated all men, made me listen to her sexual exploits, her behavior led to me losing my job, she tried to prevent me from leaving, was extremely emotionally manipulative, made me care for her and do all her chores and cook for her all the time and her kids while she had them, have her new boyfriend access to me after telling me he raped her, would constantly attack me, I was wrong, I was evil, I was abusive etc.,!<

>!she wouldn’t let me focus in class and would often make me hold her hand or rub her knee to keep her grounded, would purposely trigger me or try to start arguments right before an exam, SHE TRACKED ME DOWN ON REDDIT TO HAVE AN ARGUMENT AFTER SHE KICKED ME OUT, I had to get the school involved to force her to give me my property back, I had to get the police involved repeatedly.!<


I’ve been no contact with her for a glorious year. Guess who showed up to take the bar exam? 

I had a complete breakdown when I saw her at lunch on the first day. I had to go hide in the bathroom-the one place she couldn’t follow-and used every tool I’ve learned over the past couple of years in therapy and on my own to get it together so I didn’t fail this test. Day two was almost worse because we got stuck in an enclosed space together and I almost passed out and she definitely saw me and despite all the changes puberty has brought she still recognized me. I was so scared she was going to try to talk to me or approach me in some way. Luckily they called us back to our exam rooms after that. It’s been several days and I’m still a triggered jittery mess. 

All that work in therapy, of reprocessing, of fighting and it feels like I lost half my progress just by seeing her. All that enmeshed codependency nonsense, things I’d forgotten had even happened, and all this fury. This unbridled anger and hatred is overwhelming. 


I hope she fails. I hope she dies. I hope everyday she wakes up and stubs her toe. I hope her socks are perpetually damp. That her jeans are always too loose. That her pillow is always hot and her underwear always spiky. I hope every friend she tries to make ghosts her on day two. I hope her ice cream melts too fast. That she’s always too cold inside and too hot outside. 

May the sun forever shine into her eyes. May it always be too bright. May the breathing of her own mouth be too loud for her to concentrate. 

May she spill coffee on her white shirts. May her shoes be too tight halfway through the workday. 

May her deodorant give her a rash. May her favorite food lose all taste. May she be forever alone and ignored.

I’m 3cm, 60% and went FAST during my last induction. From 4cm to 10cm in 15 minutes. Huge mucus plug which I’ve never experienced before dropped 2 days ago, and I’ve been induced every single time so I really don’t even know what labor looks like before Pitocin. 

I had to kick my MIL out yesterday. She was here to help lighten my load and be on standby as my husband was working an hour away. Instead, I ended up a short order cook, coffee barista, and a maid while she kept digging through my house looking for my remotes I was intentionally hiding to put on hours of TV for my toddlers that are totally capable of independent play. I had enough with the physical labor and mental load she brought. I’m actually sitting on my couch for the first time since Monday, able to relax. I ended up in the hospital twice while she was here from overexertion. Now I get more rest. It’s great. 

My dad will be here in a few days to help take over but in the mean time, it’s totally possible I go into labor very, very early. 

My husband is now 20 minutes away, which is way better. But I have all of these kids here. If I manage to be able to drive myself to the hospital with them, what happens in the mean time while I wait on my husband? If I have to call 911, what happens in the meantime while I wait on my husband?

I do not have neighbors to ask and no nearby family. MIL lives 3 hours away. It probably wasn’t the best logistical situation to remove her, but honestly to hang onto this baby a little longer, it was the best decision for my body. 

Are there social workers for these types of things? I really only have a few more days until my dad arrives so I’m not *too* concerned. But I am a little worried. 

ETA: My OB advised me that when I feel labor coming, I absolutely cannot wait. I need to get to L&D quickly. The hospital is 10-15 minutes away which is nice but add on my husband’s 20 minute commute home, that is not an option to wait for him to come home first. ",4,1754149428.0,BabyBumps,10,1.0,False

Think of it like this: we can be totally chaotic together – lots of laughing, talking about anything and everything (SFW only please!), maybe even some silly and serious rants and fun gossip. But then, when we're both tired or just need to chill, we can also just be quietly online together, maybe listening to music or just knowing the other person is there. No pressure to talk all the time!  We can also help keep each other on track with our goals! Let's be accountability buddies too!

A little about me:

* I'm 32 years old
* I am a working pro (Finance)
* I work a lot! Still chasing those big dreams. 😅
* I'm on the chubby side, but I've been working out at home and jogging lately. Just wanted to be upfront about that! Just in case it matters a lot.
* Things I like include:

\- getting lost in books,

\- watching movies and anime, read manga and manhwa

\- doing cute cross-stitch projects

\- trying yummy food *(I'm a foodie!)*

\- my daily coffee fix *(If you know any awesome hidden coffee shops or cafes in Metro Manila, please let me know! I'm always on the hunt for a good one. ☕)*

\- all things cats and dogs, and

\- taking solo little trips every few months.

* Once I get comfortable, I can talk your ear off! *(But in real life, after about 2-3 hours of straight talking, my social battery needs a serious recharge, LOL!)*



What I'm hoping for in you:

* Someone who's, you know, alive and breathing well. 😉
* Someone who's looking for a constant.
* Someone who's chill and cool. Let's not rush things too much.
* Ideally around my age (31-ish) so we probably have similar things to talk about.
* It would be awesome if you liked at least one of the things I like so we always have something to chat about!

Someone who prefer to chat on Discord, not Telegram please!

Basically, just be yourself! The rest isn't a big deal.

1mftk9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mftk9x/torn_between_someone_i_liked_and_someone_who/,Torn between someone I liked and someone who likes me,"A little under two months ago, I (M25) attended a sort of unofficial reunion with a bunch of my old classmates. While there, I caught up with people I hadn’t seen in years. At the event, I ended up talking to my old crush and finally mustered up the courage to ask her out. After the event, another girl I reconnected with asked me if I wanted to go for a coffee sometime. When we met up, she admitted she had a huge crush on me at school, which I never noticed.

Considering how casual it all was at that point, I ended up going out with both. Both dates went well and I’ve essentially been seeing them both for the last month or so, which I feel kind of weird about as I’ve never got more than a second date before - let alone two! I was really shy in school so was a bit of a late bloomer. As a result, I really don’t have a lot of relationship experience so this whole dating thing is pretty new to me. 

It’s actually kind of frustrating, going years with hardly any dating prospects and now being faced with two at the same time. Dating two women at once really isn’t me and I know it’s time to commit one way or the other as I kind of feel bad about the situation and don’t want to lead anyone on. I’m just feeling really paralysed right now.

Got any advice for handling a situation like this? I’m woefully underprepared for something like this and am more than a bit socially awkward. What is the best way of tackling this? And how do I do it in the kindest way possible?

1mftjs4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1mftjs4/had_an_interesting_dream_about_my_son_trying_to/,Had an interesting dream about my son trying to drown himself and me trying to cheer him up.,"So in my dream I had a son would express himself with different kind of clothes (for example wearing swimming shorts one time and bikinis another time). He would sometimes wear his clothes backwards and I would warn him (and also in this dream wearing a bikini the ""wrong way"" could make it swimming shorts) and he would sometimes get really angry. One time when I warned him again that he wore them the wrong way he got really mad and said ""I will show you the wrong way now"" and connected us via a rope in reverse (So I really need to explain this: We are going swimming in the ocean and connect us with ropes in order to not lose each other. The way my son connected us makes it so that only one of us is over the water at the same time so the other one can potentially drown.). He then got in the ocean and tried to hurt himself while I was trying to cheer him up to not hurt himself (potentially trying to drown). So in this part of the dream just random things happened:  
\-First off there was a civilisation under the ocean  
\-We visited different vendors underwater including a kebab shop   
\-We visited a couple of illusionists   
\-We visited Anne Frank house ??  
\-We visited a concert (probably lana del ray? idk)  
\-We visited a coffee shop to catch up with my high school friends  
So as all these things were happening, something weird happened and I noticed that none of those were real and I was just watching a reddit r/aitah post posted on YouTube shorts.   


anyways, as I saw reddit in my dream I just wanted to share.

1mfti9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mfti9z/how_does_elite_gourmet_ehc113_coffee_maker/,How does Elite Gourmet EHC113 coffee maker perform? A detailed review awaits!,"The Elite Gourmet EHC113 Personal Single-Serve Compact Coffee Maker Brewer has been a daily fixture in my routine for weeks now, and it feels like I’ve unlocked some home-brewed coffee wizardry. I’ll admit — I’m a sucker for portable, efficient devices. This coffee maker takes things a step further by offering not only practicality but a design that fits seamlessly into my kitchen’s limited counter space. It quickly became my go-to for busy mornings, making coffee prep almost foolproof. 

**Compact Elegance for Small Spaces**  
The compact size of this coffee maker genuinely surprised me. It measures just 4.8 x 7.09 x 9.84 inches, meaning it barely took up any room on my cluttered counter. Its sleek black finish and stylish Art Deco elements blended nicely with the appliances I already own. I’ve often relocated it to my office desk or packed it for short trips because of its portability — it’s that lightweight. For dorm rooms, offices, or cramped kitchens, this device is unquestionably a space-saver.

**Brew Features and Reusability**  
This little brewer thrives on versatility. Unlike your typical single-serve machines that lock you into proprietary pods, the reusable filter allows for coffee grounds to be used, cutting down on waste. The inclusion of a travel mug that fits perfectly under the drip dispenser was a thoughtful touch. Plus, no more scrambling for paper filters, something that’s both eco-friendly and wallet-smart. Cleaning was simple, as all parts (except the base) are dishwasher safe. 

[Find the best price for Elite Gourmet EHC113 on Amazon now.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0b41q4d8n/)

**Quick Brewing: Ideal for Busy Users**  
One of its strengths lies in its speed. Brewing a hot, flavorful cup of coffee takes less than 60 seconds, which is a lifesaver during chaotic mornings. The one-touch operation system feels straightforward, even for someone as distracted as me pre-coffee. Admittedly, the manual operation requires you to add water each time, but it’s not much of an inconvenience.

**Good Points**  
- Compact and space-saving; perfect for small areas.  
- Quick brew time; coffee is ready in under 60 seconds.  
- Reusable filter supports eco-friendly coffee habits.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- Manual operation requires adding water for every brew.  
- The travel mug insulation could be improved to keep coffee hotter for longer.  

**Competing Brands**  
In comparison to other single-serve coffee makers like the Keurig K-Mini or Hamilton Beach Scoop, the Elite Gourmet EHC113 stands out in terms of affordability and waste reduction. While the others use proprietary pods or additional single-use cups, this one keeps things simple with its reusable filter. That said, the Keurig K-Mini may feel more upscale owing to its pod variety, and the Hamilton Beach model offers slightly better brew strength control. Yet, both lack the combination of compact design and full accessory inclusion (e.g., the travel mug) that this model delivers.

**Budget-Friendly Choice**  
When evaluating this coffee maker’s price point, it punches above its weight class. While I won’t delve into direct pricing, the features offered for its cost make it a solid choice, particularly for anyone looking to save money without compromising on convenience, speed, or performance. For casual coffee drinkers or those wanting something portable and compact, this brewer delivers affordable quality.

Since then, everything has fallen apart.  I made desperate financial decisions, trusted the wrong people, and now I’m in over $700,000 of debt...

but I just got a chance...the hospital has left the door open for me to return this September...but only if I can repay at least $250,000 by then.

I’m asking for a second chance. This is the last thing I’ll post here.  I want to fix it.,,



If even a few people reading this feel moved to help,,even a single coffee could bring me closer to the hospital doors again.

If even a few people reading this feel moved to help—  

even one coffee could bring me closer to the hospital doors again.



And if I make it through this… I promise to become the kind of doctor who gives back.  

to serve, to heal, and to never forget the hands that helped me stand again.



Thank you for reading. I’ll leave a link in the comments.

Nothing changed but my shots are needing very high pressure to even get any water through the puck during pre infusing. If I continue to try pull the shot it's well over a minute and taste like ass. Ive reduced the grind size a couple of times and I'm currently at grind size 15 from 11 and although it comes out slightly quicker than at 11 it's still much slower and very bitter.

I had the day off yesterday so, in the morning, I ventured into Hamilton to Vintage Coffee at 977 King St. East. It's an amazing little spot and the young woman gave me samples of the coffee before I bought. Enjoyed walking around a bit and the amazing artwork on the walls. Ended up chatting with a retiree for 20 mins about the area and the LRT and the pending impact on him and the neighbourhood. 

I went back into Hamilton in the afternoon with my wife to the other side of town: Detour Cafe in Dundas. There I tried (paid) and bought some of their beans. It's a cute coffee shop with nice outdoor patio. A couple of doors down, my wife noticed one of the shops had recently roasted Greenbelt Coffee beans so got those too. Not a cheap day but I'm excited to try these out. 

I've also started collating a bunch of info on Roasters around the GTHA and thinking to post that. Yes, I likely could find a lot of these at ECS Coffee but this is more fun and I get to experience the dynamic cities close to me. ",2,1754148775.0,BurlingtonON,7,0.75,False

Folding chairs are filled with silver-haired rebels and battle-scarred champions of the spark. There’s a sign taped to the wall in shaky cursive:**

 

***“SEIZURE SCHOOL: Old Fart Edition – No Shame, All Wisdom”***

 

**Juice boxes, coffee, and goldfish crackers line the snack table. Jeff’s scooter sparkles in the corner. Toaster hums as she warms snickerdoodles.**

 

**Tom the Pioneer leans on his lighning bolt cane**: “Let me tell you all something. This is Tom101: I’ve had epilepsy since before seat belts were standard. And I’m still here. Still cracking jokes. Still learning new stuff. You want to talk about tough? Try waking up not knowing where you are… and then laughing about it five minutes later.”

 

**He chuckles and waves his hand**: “Tough times don’t last, but people with seizures? We’re built for survival. Every day we live is proof that this world couldn’t shake us off.”

 

**A few elders nod, some teary-eyed, others raising their paper cups of coffee in salute.**

 

**Jeff**: “And hey, if you ever doubted whether you could raise a family with epilepsy? Look at my kid.”

 

**Desdemona waves, half-blushing. Jeffy the dragonboy takes it as an invitation to hug his grandfather.**

 

**Jeff grins:** “Sometimes kids are easier than adults. You have a seizure? They hand you a blanket and then ask if dinosaurs can have lightning powers. They don’t judge. They just *roll* with you.”

 

**He pats Jeffy’s head:** “Kids don’t need you to be perfect. They need you to be *present*. And when your brain short-circuits every now and then, guess what? They learn empathy. They learn patience. And they learn how to snack like pros.”

 

**Tom, chuckling:** “Sometimes memory loss means you can enjoy the same joke six times a day.”

 

**Jeff nods as Jeffy flutters off:** “Or forget why you walked into a room-again… and just decide to make it a snack break.”

 

**Tom is serious now, but still kind:** “You may not be able to control everything your brain does. But you can control how you *live* with it. I’ve seen people build beautiful lives on spark and stubbornness alone.”

 

**Jeff raises his juice box in a toast:** “We’re not broken. We’re rewired with extra voltage. And this classroom? It’s proof that there’s no expiration date on joy.”

 

**Jeff and Tom, together:** “ We are still here! Still here. Still sparky. Still kickin’.”

 

**After a quick bathroom break…quick meaning 30 minutes to an hour. The banner now has a sticky note stuck over it that reads:**

 

**Q&A TIME: “Ask Us Anything (We Might Even Remember It)”**

 

**Desdemona has reluctantly agreed to moderate. Toaster is now wearing a “Stage Tech” headset and passing out snacks. Jeffy is ‘helping’. Aka dive-bombing the audience and throwing goldfish at them.**

 

**Desdemona :** “Okay. First question. From Mike in the back. ‘How do you deal with people who don’t believe epilepsy is a real disability?’”

 

**Tom, without missing a beat:** “Usually I wait until I forget their name mid-conversation. Then I smile and say, ‘Still think it’s all in my head?’”

 

**Jeff:** “And if that doesn’t work, I let my wife Lizzy explain it to them. That woman will make them want to crawl back into whatever hole they came from.”

 

**Tom:** “Remember, if someone doubts you, just ask if they want to come to your next EEG. Nothing says ‘real’ like glue in your hair and flashing lights.”

 

**Desdemona reads the next card:** “This one says: ‘What if I’m scared I won’t be able to do things anymore?’”

 

**Jeff, softer now:** “Oh, sweetie. You *will* do things. You might just do them differently. Or more slowly. You have to take every victory and laugh you can get.”

 

**Tom, grinning:** “Half the time you’ll forget you were afraid until someone reminds you. Fear fades, you don’t.”

 

**Jeff:** “And when it gets hard? You sit down, have a juice box, and remember your elders are still out here kicking butt with mismatched socks and two working brain cells between them both.”

 

**Desdemona:** “Okay, here’s a fun one. ‘How do I explain seizures to kids without scaring them?’”

 

**Jeff:** “Easy. Seizures are just your brain trying to dance too hard.”

 

**Tom:** “Or like the Wi-Fi goes out for a few minutes and you gotta wait for the reboot.”

 

**Jeff nod:** “Tell kids, ‘Sometimes my brain hits the wrong button. But don’t worry—I’ve got people who know how to hit the restart button.’”

 

**Desdemona rolls her eyes:** “You lost that button a long time ago, Dad. Okay this next one reads, ‘What’s your favorite seizure recovery snack?’”

 

**Jeff & Tom and the same time:** “Snickerdoodles.” “Sardines.”

 

**Jeff:** “And if you’re fancy? Snickerdoodles *with* peanut butter.”

 

**Tom:** “If you’re *really* fancy? You don’t have to share your fish.”

 

**Desdemona:** “This last one says: ‘What advice would you give your younger self?’”

 

**Tom, pausing:** “Breathe more. Fight less. Laugh every chance you get. And never skip your meds just to prove a point.”

 

**Jeff:** “Be weird. Be loud. Take naps. And know that you’re still worthy of love, even if you forget what day it is. And always remember…”

 

**Tom:** “If life gives you lemons—”

 

**Jeff:** “Make snickerdoodles.”

 

**Tom:** “…That’s not how lemons work.”

 

**Jeff claps his shoulder:** “Neither do we, Tom. Neither do we.”

 

**The crowd laughs. A juice box is raised in toast. Goldfish crackers scatter like confetti. Toaster plays victory music from a Bluetooth speaker made out of a duct-taped cookie tin.**

After my confession at St. Seraphim's Cathedral in Dallas, I was approached in the narthex by a man in rough shape who claimed to know Bishop Gerasim and said he needed help while Vladyka was in Santa Rosa. He showed me text messages with him and told a long story about being jumped and losing his I.D. money and bank cards. He asked me for $40 to get through the week.

I gave him the $50 I had in my wallet and encouraged him to speak with the priest or go through the Cathedral’s charity network. I also, as foolish as it was, gave him a ride to the train station in Parkland. He was hesitant for me to route myself there rather than listen to his directions, which led me somewhere entirely different than Google Maps.

Later, I looked into his background and discovered that:
- He has **no connection to Bishop Gerasim** or St. Seraphim's whatsoever. I have photos from the groundbreaking of the church which he is not present in at all, though he claimed to be there and knew the parishioners from that time.
- He has **never attended an Orthodox parish**. He is not baptized, and has no connections within the Orthodox Church at all, which is suspicious given he claimed to be a regular communicant since 2002.
- He has a **extensive criminal record** spanning over 15 years, including multiple felonies and parole violations. None of which he told me about.
- He was previously **institutionalized for mental instability** following a felony conviction which he pled guilty to.

No one at the Cathedral recognized him. His story was fabricated. I don't wish to know why, but if he did need help he could get it without exploiting and lying to parishioners.

Christ tells us when we Minister to the least of us we Minister to Him. However, we must still be discerning to minister to those who are truthful and really need the help. If someone asks for money:

- **Verify their identity** and connection to the parish.
- **Direct them to the priest or Cathedral charity network**.
- **Avoid giving cash** unless you’re absolutely certain of their situation.

I know it's probably common sense. I know everyone probably already knows this. But still, maybe one person that reads this needs to be made aware and that's enough for me.

If you are at St. Seraphim's and know someone who can get word around, do so. I will not be able to be at coffee hour or stay after liturgy this weekend since I am working and will be returning to California the following week.",3,1754148624.0,OrthodoxChristianity,5,0.8,False

🎨 Character: ""Mithra""

Name Meaning: Mithra (மித்ரா) means ""friendship"" — symbolizing the one who stands by during growth.

Style: Calm, classy, Ghibli or anime-style vibe — minimal makeup, deep eyes.

Looks:

Medium height (5’3”), soft dusky complexion, expressive black eyes, and straight waist-length hair.

Wears ethnic fusion (kurti with sneakers), or comfy modern (oversized hoodie + book in hand).

Signature detail: bracelet made of old trading coins (a gift from Vel).


Personality:

Wise beyond her years — loves books, journals, and deep conversations at 11 PM.

Into self-growth like you — journaling, meditating, planning.

Supports Vel’s vision, but doesn’t flatter — she questions, challenges, motivates.

Her vibe: ""I won’t stop you from chasing greatness. I’ll run beside you.""


Backstory:

Met during a financial literacy seminar. Asked a bold question on SIPs — Vel noticed her spark.

They bonded over coffee and macroeconomics. First argument? “Trading isn't investing!”

Still watches his crush memes quietly, occasionally drops hints through financial jokes.


Flaws:

Emotionally guarded. Keeps walls up after past heartbreak.

Overthinks everything. But secretly writes poems about Vel.

Stubborn when she’s scared of losing control.

The build is solid and durable, yet compact enough to fit on my countertop without hogging too much space, measuring just 12.7”D x 15.5”W x 16”H. Every part feels premium, from the seamless touchscreen interface to the stainless steel jug and portafilter. A small issue I noticed, however, was that the machine's weight of 21.8 pounds makes it a bit cumbersome to move around. But honestly, who’s lugging their espresso machine all over the house?

**Ease of Use and Touchscreen Experience**  
Navigating the touchscreen interface was like having my personal barista guiding me. It simplifies the process into three steps—Grind, Brew, and Milk. I could adjust coffee strength, milk texture, and temperature to my exact liking and even save up to eight customized coffee profiles. I messed around with these settings, creating personal favorites like my oat milk flat white. It’s intuitive and easy, which makes it less intimidating, even for someone who might be new to brewing espresso. That said, I did find the display prone to fingerprints, which became a minor cleaning annoyance.

**Performance and Brewing Quality**  
If you’ve ever dreamed of crafting coffee that rivals your local café, this machine delivers on that promise. The integrated precision conical burr grinder stands out by grinding just the right dose of beans for optimal flavor. I was impressed by how consistently and evenly the coffee turned out with the low-pressure pre-infusion—it genuinely enhances the extraction phase. It also heats up impressively fast, courtesy of its ThermoJet heating system, which reaches optimal temperature in just three seconds. My mornings with this machine have been significantly more efficient, especially when I’m scrambling to make coffee before work. The steaming wand, which creates velvety microfoam perfect for latte art, took my cappuccinos to the next level. While the performance checks out, adjustments to the grind size and temperature require a bit of trial and error, especially if you’re diving into customizing your shots daily.

**Upsides**  
- Streamlined touchscreen interface simplifies brewing.  
- High-quality grind control ensures optimal flavor extraction.  
- Rapid heating system saves time during busy mornings.  
- Programmable milk texture and temperature let you create barista-level microfoam.  

**Negatives**  
- Display is prone to fingerprints, requiring frequent cleaning.  
- The machine is heavy and less portable than smaller coffee makers.  
- Not ideal for complete beginners due to the learning curve with customizable settings.

**Specifications and Accessories**  
The included components really enhance the machine’s versatility. It comes with a stainless-steel jug, four filter baskets, a dose trimming tool, a regular water filter, and a cleaning kit—everything you need to brew right out of the box. The 67-ounce water tank is conveniently designed for fewer refills, and the half-pound bean hopper stores enough beans for a few brewing sessions. I must say, having all these tools readily available made my overall coffee brewing experience smoother.

**Competing Products**  
When comparing the Breville Barista Touch to other espresso machines like the De'Longhi La Specialista or the Gaggia Classic Pro, the former triumphs in automation and technological perks. Those models might cater more to traditionalists who prefer manual control. However, I noticed that while Breville’s touchscreen feature feels advanced, the Gaggia Classic Pro offers a heavier, more traditional steaming wand for enthusiasts who want finer control. On the affordability spectrum, De’Longhi often undercuts Breville, making it a friendlier option for buyers on a budget. What the Breville excels at, however, is uncompromised convenience without sacrificing quality.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Let’s address what may be on your mind: Is it worth the price tag? The Breville Barista Touch might seem like a larger investment at first glance, but if you’re someone who frequently spends on café-quality coffee, it essentially pays for itself in time. The programmable features and premium grinding and brewing options justify its cost compared to cheaper competitors. While it may not cater to every budget, the value proposition becomes clear for coffee aficionados.

1mftb7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/serbia/comments/1mftb7j/our_first_trip_to_serbia_with_my_wife_it_was/,Our first trip to Serbia with my wife. It was beyond perfect.,"Hi, we are from Turkey and I wanted to thank you, the Serbian people for the hospitality during our trip. We only had 4 days to stay in Belgrade and we didn't planned anything beforehand so it was a little spontaneous. But man! The food, the city, the people, everything was amazing! First day we went to the zoo, even if I oppose the idea of caging animals just for pleasure, I have never seen a penguin or a tiger or a giraffe or anything and probably never will, and we were around the Kalemeydan, so we went there. I'm still sad for the animals, anyway. I will never put my foot on a zoo in my life. But the animals were fed well. They were looking strong. 

Then we went to the Church of Saint Sava. This church was one of the most magnificent buildings I ever saw in my life. The interior was holistic, during my visit we only whispered just not to disturb the peace there. We also bought a christmas coin to help the church. I still remember the peace I felt inside. I'm not a religious man but this is the most religious feeling I can get. 

The food was amazing. We didn't know what to eat so I just looked up from the google maps with highest ranks, and I have found Walter. It was in a beautiful neighbourhood with streets that had a lot of trees and old architecture houses. The neigbourhood was so awesome that we spent maybe 3-4 hours just by walking in the streets. We ate cevabi and it was awesome, we also drank a Serbian beer (I forgot its name) but it was delicious. We went for a walk for 1 hour more just to digest. 

The second day we went to a restaurant named Dva Jelena, we have opened a Serbian wine (there were a lot of wine selection from a lot of countries but we wanted the full Serbian experience) and when we drank the wine, we immediately loved it and bought another bottle in a market. It was Doja Prokupaj from 2020 and the waiter told us it was made only by Serbian native grapes. 

In the other day we went to Tapmer Speciality Coffee and Brunch in Resavska street and we really liked the avokado toast with smoked salmons. Normally in our culture, the breakfast is huge and consists of a lot of things but this serving was something like ""all in one"" and the size of the breakfast was perfect. 

In one bookstore, I have found J.R.R Tolkien's Hobbit in Serbian, with illustrations in it, hardcover and I immediately grabbed it for my Tolkien bookshelf. I have read the Hobbit many times and It really felt great to have a book in this excellent condition. 

One night, I have spent over 100 dollars worth of dinars to a claw machine game store, just 200 meters away from Hotel Moskva, it was so entertaining and addicting that I couldn't stop. I had maybe 15 plushies and toys from there and then I got scared that I could be arrested for smuggling in my country so I gave some of them to the hotel staff. Stay out of there! It is really addicting!

We visited some supermarkets and bought everything we can that seemed different. There were a lot of cocktails that were ready to drink. They were awesome. Then we bought some Serbian brands like Plasma, Ajvar from Bakina Tajna, Serbian honey, and Quince Rakija. Ajvar is perfect and we haven't tried the others yet because we returned just two days ago. 

The only disturbance I have experienced was from Turkish people, sadly. We are people used to crowded places and chaos that's why we don't give much attention to our surroundings and other people. Whenever I heard someone talking loudly, they were Turkish. 

I will definitely visit Serbia, maybe next year. We as a couple do not earn much, so we have gone a little bit over the budget for 4 days but it was definitely worth it. The peace surrounding the neighbourhoods and the people was mesmerizing. We only saw the Old Belgrade so of course I still know nothing about Serbia but next time I will go outside the city and travel the country to see the natural beauties. Anyway, sorry for the long post but I'm still very excited to have experienced such a beautiful country. 

If you have any suggestions for my next trip please share. I want to get involved with Serbian culture more.

1mft9wn,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedTech/comments/1mft9wn/explore_if_the_best_wireless_neckband_headphones/,Explore if the Best Wireless Neckband Headphones by Anker Deliver,"The Soundcore by Anker Life U2i Wireless Neckband Headphones, model A3213Z11, have been my daily audio companion for the past few weeks. As someone who juggles work calls, lengthy gym sessions, and occasional outdoor runs, I was intrigued by the array of promises from these headphones—impressive sound output, long playback time, and a lightweight, foldable design. Several features stood out, and some could use a touch of improvement, but overall, my experience with the product has been positive. Here’s the breakdown.

**Design and Build Quality**  
One of the first things I noticed about this wireless neckband was how lightweight it felt right out of the box. At just 0.96 ounces, you almost forget you're wearing it, which is great for long-term use. The neckband is flexible and ergonomically designed, easily bending to fit snugly around my neck or into my bag without tangling—huge relief for anyone who's spent too long unraveling headphone cables. The polycarbonate and ABS materials give it a sturdy build, but not at the expense of comfort. I’ve used it while working out, and the IPX5 water resistance kept it operational despite some seriously sweaty sessions!

**Key Benefits**  
- The neckband's flexibility and weightlessness make it exceptionally comfortable.  
- Effortless storage with a foldable design that avoids tangling.  
- IPX5 water resistance adds durability for workouts or sudden weather changes.

[Check Soundcore by Anker Life U2i price on Amazon.](https://soundcontroltech.com/p/b0cbtql2lg/)

**Sound Performance**  
Sound quality is where these headphones truly shine. The 10mm audio drivers paired with BassUp technology deliver a surprisingly rich and deep listening experience for such a compact device. My playlists sounded more dynamic with punchy bass, though not overpowering, and the treble remained balanced. The two available EQ modes provided a noticeable difference in audio profile; I leaned more towards the bass-enhanced mode when streaming music. When testing podcasts or audiobooks, the standard EQ mode provided clear and crisp audio. Whether I was zoning out on upbeat workout tracks or catching up on news podcasts, the audio clarity was consistently impressive.

**Battery Life Matters**  
For someone like me, always on the go, battery life can make or break headphones. These headphones deliver. An impressive 24-hour playtime from a single full charge meant I rarely needed to plug them in more than twice a week with moderate daily usage. Even better, when I forgot to charge them overnight, I could juice them up for just 10 minutes and still get three hours of playback—perfect for a quick fix before heading out. During testing, I never felt constrained by battery limitations, whether working through a long shift or powering through a weekend hike with continuous playlists.

**Call Clarity Features**  
The built-in microphones equipped with AI-enhanced algorithms manage to pick up voices clearly, even in moderately noisy environments. I tested these on extended Zoom calls and phone catchups with friends, and the feedback was unanimous—clear, precise, and free from unnecessary static interference. Whether you're in a bustling coffee shop or walking outdoors, these headphones keep you connected without sacrificing call quality.

**Drawbacks**  
However, this is not a perfect device, and users may encounter a few areas that leave room for enhancement:  
- The Bluetooth range, listed at 10 meters, struggled a bit when walls were involved. Audio dropped when the connection was stretched around corners in my home.  
- The absence of active noise cancellation might disappoint those expecting or needing total environmental blockout. While it doesn’t claim to offer ANC, other alternatives in this price range might have this feature.  
- Setting-wise, app controls could have been more intuitive. Although straightforward, experimenting with the buttons takes a bit of trial and error initially.

**Competing Products**  
When considering alternatives, the Anker Soundcore Life U2i headphones hold up well. Compared to other wireless neckbands like Sony WI-C310 or JBL Live 220BT, it brings several advantages in sound quality and battery life. Sony’s neckband may offer slightly cleaner treble, but its battery life lags behind at around 15 hours. Meanwhile, JBL delivers a decent experience but tends to be slightly bulkier, which diminishes comfort over prolonged wear. On the flip side, if active noise cancellation is non-negotiable, products like the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2, while within the same price range, stand out. However, they don’t offer the same lightweight feel or quick-charging perks as this Anker product. The trade-offs will depend largely on individual priorities.

**Quality for Price**  
With such reliable performance features and thoughtful design elements, it’s safe to say this neckband packs a solid punch for its price range. While it may not include premium-level features such as ANC or extended wireless range, what you’re getting is a balance of core essentials done remarkably well, minus the heavy price tag. For most everyday users—be it casual music listeners or regular callers—it delivers substantial value for the money. Of course, the decision ultimately boils down to whether the impressive sound and exceptional battery life outshine the minor limitations.

This year, I got a second machine as a gift and decided to set it up at my parents’ house since I work from there occasionally. I was considering getting a Niche but ended up checking Facebook Marketplace first.

I found someone selling a DF64 II with SSP High Uniformity burrs and figured I’d snag it just for the burrs. The coffee actually tasted a bit richer than what I got from the P, but my pucks were channeling like crazy.every. single. time.

I figured it probably just needed a burr alignment… until I opened it up and saw what’s in the image. Looks like the previous owner didn’t install the burrs correctly and let them grind together enough to wear off the copper coating. Not great.

I tried aligning them anyway. It helped a little, but not enough. Eventually I swapped in the original burrs (thankfully the seller included them), and boom, no more channeling. Cups are tasting more consistent now too.

1mft7e7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mft7e7,I levelled up my living room with a DIY retro gaming coffee table!,"A while back I realised my living room had a personality crisis. I love old school games, but I also wanted a sleek coffee table that didn’t scream “arcade” to everyone who walked in and to keep the Mrs happy.  
  
After weeks of hunting, I just couldn’t find anything that struck that balance, so I decided to build my own.

I started with a simple but sturdy table base and integrated a 32"" TV screen. When it’s closed, it’s just a coffee table (it’s got enough space for a laptop, mugs and snacks) no one has any idea what’s underneath.

But pull the panels apart and a 32‑inch Fire TV screen appears. I made it so I can plug and play my NES, SNES, SEGA MINI, Playstation Classic etc and with RetroArch, so there are thousands of Master System and Arcade games at my fingertips.

A few details that took this from concept to something I’m really proud of:

• **Hidden mechanics:** Both sides of the top slide on drawer runners, revealing the screen and a storage cavity for wireless controllers.

• **LED ambience:** I added RGB strips under the pedestal. The night shots really make the PacMan and Mario colours pop.

• **Hologram Easter egg:** For fun I cut a little acrylic pyramid that sits over the screen and projects a 3D Mario head and other holograms. It’s ridiculous, but it makes people smile.

Building it took a couple weeks weekends, some trial and error with the sliding mechanism and acrylic screen addition. I tested tilting it but it added nothing so kept it top down.

Seeing friends’ faces when the top slides open makes it totally worth it. I filmed the build process on TT and a demo (link below) if you’re curious about the guts of it. I got AI to create a funny trailer although I don't really plan on selling it although I might make some for close friends as it was fun.

This isn’t a product plug, just sharing because other projects where someone turned an old table into something special inspired me to take the plunge.

1mft6b8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mft6b8/im_a_good_boyfriend/,Im a good boyfriend,"Part 1.

I know what people think of me.
 They think I’m broken. Or dangerous.
They don’t understand.
I’m not a monster.
 I’m a good boyfriend.

I first saw her outside the pharmacy on Oak Street.
 She was carrying a paper bag and scrolling through her phone. She bumped into someone, dropped her receipt.
 I picked it up for her.
She smiled.
 Just a little smile.
 But it stayed with me.
It meant something.
 It had to.
I trailed her home that evening.
 Not to be creepy — just to make sure she got there safe.
 She walked with music in her ears, barely looking around. So unaware.
 Anyone could’ve hurt her.
 She needed someone to look after her.
That’s what boyfriends do.

Her name was Madison.
 I learned that from the label on her pharmacy bag.
 Madison Grey.
Nice name.
 Clean.
 Warm.
She lived in a little brick townhouse near the park.
 Unit 4B.
 I walked past it three times that night. The curtains were closed, but the lights were on.
 She was home.
 Safe.
That should’ve been enough.
 But it wasn’t.

At first, I only watched from across the street.
 A car. A bench. A shadow.
She always kept the same routine. Work, coffee shop, home.
 She’d heat up microwave dinners and binge true crime shows.
 Ironically.
On Tuesdays she watered her plants.
 On Thursdays she did laundry.
 On Sundays she took long showers and sang to herself.
I liked that.
 That was ours.
 She just didn’t know it yet.

I broke in for the first time a few weeks later.
She left for work at 8:15 sharp.
 Took a Lyft. Didn’t lock the window.
 That wasn’t safe.
I didn’t take anything.
 Didn’t mess anything up.
 I just wanted to look around.
Her couch was soft. Her throw blanket smelled like lavender.
 I sat for a while. Imagined her curled up next to me.
 Watched a few minutes of her show before I left.
It felt right.
 Like I belonged there.

Eventually, I stopped leaving.
I’d be inside when she got home, tucked behind furniture or crouched in closets.
 She never noticed.
Sometimes, I’d crawl under her bed and listen to her breathing.
 Other times I hid in the kitchen cabinet.
 Once, I fell asleep inside her laundry hamper.
She walked right past me, brushing her teeth, humming her little songs.
She was beautiful.
 Radiant.
 Mine.

There were close calls.
 Once she paused mid-step, sniffing the air.
 Another time she stared too long at the half-used coffee cup I’d forgotten in the sink.
She mumbled, “Weird...” and kept moving.
She never really saw me.
 But I saw her.
 Every inch.
I watched her stretch before bed.
 Read on the toilet.
 I knew which side she parted her hair. Which lotion she liked. What time she scratched her thigh in her sleep.
I knew her.
 Intimately.

I started leaving her little things.
 A rose on the nightstand.
 A chocolate on her pillow.
 One morning, I laid out her favorite sweater and leggings. She wore them.
That meant something.

The accident happened on a Tuesday.
 The last Tuesday.
I was cooking dinner — chicken parmesan. I’d set the table.
 Candles. Napkins.
 Two plates.
I was so excited to finally introduce myself.
She came home early.
 Walked in, dropped her purse, and froze.
 Eyes locked on mine.
“Who the f— WHAT THE FUCK?!”
I smiled.
 Held up the plate.
 “I made your favorite.”
She screamed.
 Grabbed a lamp. Threw it at me.
I tried to calm her down. I told her I loved her. That I’d been here for weeks. That I knew her.
She ran for the door.
 I chased her.
 I grabbed her arm.
She slipped.
Her head hit the corner of the countertop.
 Hard.
The sound was horrible.
 Like cracking a frozen watermelon.

She didn’t move.
Blood leaked from her temple, down her cheek, into her ear.
 Her eyes were open.
I froze.
 Stared.
 Tried to lift her up. She was heavier than I expected.
I carried her to bed.
 Tucked her in.
 Whispered that everything would be okay.
 That we were just having a fight.
She’d get over it.
 She’d always been so quiet anyway.
I kissed her cheek.
 Still warm.

She didn’t eat for days.
 Didn’t speak.
I read to her.
 Brushed her hair.
 Told her jokes.
But she just lay there.
 Still.
 Silent.
She must’ve been mad.

The smell started on day five.
I sprayed her with perfume. Lit candles.
 Opened windows.
At night, I’d curl up beside her.
 I didn’t mind the cold.
 Love keeps you warm.
I told her about my day. About the shows I watched.
 I told her I forgave her for screaming.
 She didn’t know what she was doing.
 People panic when they’re overwhelmed by love.

One morning, I woke up to find her hand had fallen off the bed.
 Stiff.
 Blackened fingers.
I gently tucked it back under the covers.
I told her she needed to rest.
 That she looked tired.
She didn’t blink.

Eventually, I knew it had to end.
 Even the best relationships can go sour.
I told her I was leaving.
 That I’d always remember her.
She didn’t say anything.
But her jaw had been open for days.
 So maybe she was trying.

I packed my things and left the next morning.
 Walked home.
 Turned on the TV.
And there she was.
Madison Grey. 29 years old.
 Found dead in her apartment.
They said there were no signs of forced entry. No witnesses.
 A photo of her smiling filled the screen.
 God, she looked beautiful.
The reporter called it a tragedy.
 Said the killer was still out there.
I sat on the couch.
 Shaking my head.
“This world,” I muttered. “This world is full of sick people.”
I looked at her face again.
“If I had stayed… maybe I could’ve intervened. Maybe… you wouldn’t have gotten killed.”
I wiped a tear from my cheek.
 “But it’s too late now. And even though I’ll always remember you…”
I smiled.
“I found someone new.”

Her name is Amy.
 She works at the coffee shop near my building.
She smiled when I ordered.
 Her nametag was crooked, so I fixed it for her.
She laughed.
 Said “Thanks.”
That meant something.
 It has to.
I know what people think of me.
 But they don’t understand.
I’m not a monster.
 I’m a good boyfriend.

I was in a 14 year relationship/7 years married with children. 

Due to the nature of how toxic things had become I decided it was best for everyone that I lived elsewhere during the divorce. I didn't have the funds to immediately jump into a rental and having no family nearby I didn't have too many options. Overall I just wanted my children's lives to stay as ""normal"" as possible so them staying in the home and attending their same school was my goal.

Honestly I've lived in my vehicle before so I had an idea of what to expect, but I have found some challenges.

Showering every day is what I miss most hygiene wise. I've been lucky enough to have friends who let me come by every other day but I'd like to not wear out my welcome. I'm not near a truck stop so I can't use their showers, so it's looking like PF is my best option. I work out already albeit outdoors but I can use the gym for a few exercises then shower after.

Working from home is difficult at times in my vehicle. I always feel like I'm twisting to use my laptop that's in the center of the vehicle. Coffee shops are an option but the noise level isn't always reasonable.

Fresh foods. I need to get some type or refrigeration as I want to keep some small things on hand. I'm not a fan of eating out so it's a win win.

That's it. Not sure why I'm posting other than to thank everyone else for sharing their stories.

1mft5g6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BatteryHub/comments/1mft5g6/does_the_makita_18v_lithiumion_battery_pack/,Does the Makita 18V Lithium-Ion Battery Pack Deliver? Comprehensive Review Inside,"Testing the **Makita BL1840BSC2 18V LXT® Lithium-Ion Battery and Charger Starter Pack (4.0Ah)** over the past several weeks has been an experience packed with discoveries, convenience, and a few minor grumbles. As someone who's constantly working with cordless tools, a reliable power source is as necessary as a strong cup of coffee on a Monday morning. The Makita BL1840BSC2 starter pack seemed to promise just that—infused with advanced features like extended run time, Star Protection technology, and a reputation for durability. Below, I’ll break down exactly how this product performed in real-world testing.

**Design and Durability**  
The overall build feels rugged, which is something I appreciated immediately. The outer case looks and feels like it can handle a few drops—exactly what you’d hope for when working in less-than-ideal conditions around a worksite or backyard project. The black color, albeit minimalistic, hides scratches better than lighter-colored packs. It’s not just a pretty face. The shock-absorbing inner liner and impact-resistant casing add an extra layer of reliability, making it clear Makita didn’t cut corners in material quality. At 4.62 pounds, the weight is manageable, though carrying it around all day alongside an array of tools can get tiring.

**Performance and Battery Life**  
The performance is stellar. The 18V Lithium-Ion battery delivers consistent power, even when faced with extreme Chicago winter temperatures. During a landscaping job on a chilly afternoon, the battery resisted any tendency to self-discharge and delivered reliable power. The promise of up to 35% more run time compared to models like the BL1830 held true in my experience. A fully charged pack got me through sanding wood, running a circular saw, and polishing surfaces—all without a single hiccup. The integrated LED charge indicator is my favorite little feature here. No more blind guessing whether the juice will run out midway through.

**Advanced Charging Features**  
The charger that accompanies the pack truly earns its place in the kit. The ""smart"" charging system communicates with the battery, which was surprising to me. Makita’s ability to monitor current, voltage, and temperature to optimize charge times is super impressive. I timed it, and the 4.0Ah battery charged fully in about 90 minutes exactly, as advertised. This is a noticeable upgrade for anyone used to waiting for hours before initiating their next task.

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Extremely durable with impact-resistant and shock-absorbing design.  
- Consistent power output even in fluctuating weather conditions.  
- Fast charging time with the included smart charger.  
- LED charge indicator offers real-time battery status.  
- The 35% longer run time compared to older batteries is a real game-changer.

**Compatibility and Ease of Use**  
Makita has built an ecosystem, and this pack fits in seamlessly. With the ability to power over 325 tools in their 18V LXT lineup, it genuinely expands options for upgrading without rebuying another charger or battery. I used it across a compact drill, an impact driver, and even some gardening equipment. Switching the battery between devices was easy, and the snug fit ensured no power interruptions. However, if you’re out of the Makita trenches—say, if you’ve got a Bosch or DeWalt collection—you’ll find this incompatible due to the proprietary system.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The price point is not exactly budget-friendly for casual users.  
- A bit on the heavier side, especially when doing fieldwork.  
- While sturdy, some might prefer a better grip texture on the battery casing.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this to products like the DeWalt DCB205-2 20V Max or Milwaukee M18 RedLithium, Makita’s starter pack holds its own. The DeWalt batteries, for instance, boast slightly faster charging but lack Makita's consistent power in extremely cold conditions. Milwaukee’s RedLithium, on the other hand, beats Makita in energy density, offering a bit more usage per charge, but they tend to feel bulkier. Makita excels in build quality and ease of integration with its tool lineup, making it less likely you’ll encounter compatibility surprises.

**Quality for Price**  
Is the Makita BL1840BSC2 worth the investment? It depends on your workload. If you’re a weekend warrior tackling occasional DIY projects, you might find the price to be on the high side, and other brands might serve you adequately. However, for pros or enthusiasts who depend heavily on their tools, the reliability and extended run time make it a smart buy. Features like the Star Protection Computer Controls, which prevent overloading or overheating, translate to fewer interruptions and greater peace of mind.

The change was roughly around $20.00. We don't really tip here in my country, so when this happens, it's a bit out of the ordinary. 

I smiled and said to my co-worker, I love when this happens. She cheekily smiled and goes that's ""pretty privilege"". Confused I asked what she meant and she told me, pretty people get treated differently to others. I was like wtf do you mean? 

She then proceeded to name multiple instances in which I always got tips and tipping is not even the norm in our country, how customers would bring items to the counter and leave behind chocolates, or other sweets that they paid for and said it was for me, or how customers would bring me coffee, hot chocolate or bubble teas. Or how whenever we do fundraising i always seem to get the most donations. Or how customers always greet me with hey beautiful, hey gorgeous, hey sweetheart. Or the time a customer drew a sketch of me. 

I never really thought about it and just assumed customers were like that to all of the staff out of gratitude for our services or greeted everybody the same. I mean, people are pretty friendly and nice where I live in general, but apparently no. 

I'm still not entirely convinced of this alleged ""pretty privilege"" I have and it got me thinking what are other signs of ""pretty privilege"" because I don't seem to have a grasp on what's normal and what's not normal for everybody. ",0,1754148052.0,NoStupidQuestions,10,0.25,False

The primary place where my ADHD shows up is in my home. I struggle a lot to keep spaces tidy and clean. I can't ""see"" clutter or mess until it starts to impact daily tasks. One cup or plate on my coffee table doesn't register in my mind as something that needs to be tidied. My bedroom has a perpetual layer of clothes on the floor. I leave empty cans of sparkling water on my desk regularly. Sometimes I'll leave a receipt on the floor for weeks because it's just part of the floor now. I don't have the capacity to do dishes every day. I often wash my clothes but don't fold them (back to perpetual clothing layer). Don't ask me how often I wash my bedsheets. These are day-to-day examples, when my depression gets worse my house gets much dirtier.

All this to say I am messy. I am not organized. And I feel a lot of shame about it that I'm trying to let go. In addition to having ADHD I was also raised in a relatively messy house and wasn't taught to clean beyond washing sinks, toilets, and vacuuming (it's almost like ADHD is highly genetic). I want a clean and tidy house. I want decluttered spaces because I feel more mentally clear in them.

I realized the other day while doing dishes that my idealized picture of what that looks like will never happen. Unless I find a semi-type-a spouse who loves to clean and somehow also tolerates my severe ADHD, that'll never be my living space. I had a deep moment of acceptance while loading the dishwasher. The reason I feel shame about my cleaning habits, the reason I find it so shameful is because I've been comparing myself to an ideal. I feel bad because I'm chasing something I know I can't achieve. It felt good to let go of something I hadn't realized I was holding onto. It felt like a weight was physically lifted.

Now this doesn't mean I'm not committed to bettering my habits and trying to do better. But I've given up the dream. I just want function. I just want to do better than I've been before. Maybe some day I'll find myself living how I'd always imagined, but for now I'm giving to up that expectation. I am going to do my best and stop feeling guilty I don't have a spotless home.

I can make a homemade meal in my kitchen.

I have a sanitary bathroom.

I have clean clothes.

The cans on my desk will be picked up.

This briefing document summarizes key concepts from Dr. Sudheendra S.G.'s research on behavioral genetics, focusing on the principles of learning, particularly classical and operant conditioning, and their profound impact on human and animal behavior.

I. Foundations of Behaviorism and Learning

Dr. Sudheendra S.G. places significant emphasis on Ivan Pavlov, acknowledging his foundational contributions to the ""behaviorist school of thought."" This perspective views psychology as an ""empirically rigorous science, focused on observable behaviors and not unobservable internal mental processes."" While modern psychology encompasses both behavior and mental processes, Pavlov's work established a path for ""more experimental rigor and behavioral research.""

**Key Idea:** Learning is defined as ""the process of acquiring, through experience, new and relatively enduring information or behaviors."" It is crucial for adaptation and survival, occurring through ""association, observation, or just plain thinking.""

II. Classical Conditioning: Associating Stimuli

**A. Pavlov's Experiments and Core Concepts:** Dr. Sudheendra highlights Pavlov's famous experiments with dogs. Pavlov, originally a physiologist studying the digestive system, observed dogs salivating at the mere whiff of food. He realized this wasn't just an annoyance but a ""simple but important form of learning.""

* **The Experiment:** Pavlov paired the ""unconditioned stimulus"" (UCS) of meat powder, which naturally caused ""unconditioned response"" (UCR) of drooling, with ""neutral stimuli"" (NS) like a sound or light.
* **Acquisition:** After repeated pairings, the neutral stimulus became a ""conditioned stimulus"" (CS), eliciting a ""conditioned response"" (CR) of drooling even without the meat powder.
* **Associative Learning:** This process, termed ""classical conditioning,"" demonstrates ""associative learning,"" where a subject ""links certain events, behaviors, or stimuli together.""
* **Methodological Significance:** Classical conditioning proved that learning could be ""studied through direct observation of behavior in real-time, without all those messy feelings and emotions,"" a principle appreciated by behaviorists who disdained ""mentalistic concepts"" like consciousness.

**B. Applications and Implications of Classical Conditioning:**

Dr. Sudheendra, along with figures like B.F. Skinner and John B. Watson, embraced the idea that psychology should focus on ""objective, observable behavior.""

* **""Chota Chetan"" Experiment:** Dr. Sudheendra recounts an experiment where he ""trained kids to be terrified of furry animals."" He accomplished this by pairing a white ball (NS) with a loud, scary noise (UCS), leading the child ""chota chetan"" to scream in fear at the sight of the ball (CS). This fear then ""generalized to include other furry white objects, like bunnies, dogs, and even fur coats.""
* **Societal Conditioning:** Dr. Sudheendra postulates that deeply ingrained societal behaviors, such as people ""ready to die for their religion ready to die for their nation, or even ready to immolate themselves when their favourite hero dies,"" are ""nothing but conditional training they have been adopted due to circumstances."" He cites the self-immolations after Dr. M.G. Ramachandran's death as an example, suggesting they were ""conditionally trained to fear surviving in this world, without their hero.""
* **Undoing Conditioning:** Dr. Sudheendra acknowledges that ""new conditioning could be used to undo old conditioning,"" referencing a film example where fear of a lift is overcome by repeated safe exposure. However, he warns that such experiments can be ""hazardous,"" citing the tragic case of ""Little Albert"" who ""even died to frequent conditioning.""
* **Advertising:** A practical application of classical conditioning is seen in advertising. Dr. Sudheendra provides the example of Bisleri bottled water, where the concept that ""health comes from clean water"" was ""classically conditioned Indian minds"" to associate bottled water with health, leading to the sale of ""freely available abundant water resource... in packed bottles.""

III. Operant Conditioning: Linking Behavior with Consequences

**A. Basic Principles:** Dr. Sudheendra introduces ""operant conditioning"" as another type of associative learning. Unlike classical conditioning, which links stimuli, operant conditioning ""involves associating our own behaviour with consequences.""

* **Reinforcement vs. Punishment:**
* **Reinforcement:** Increases a behavior.
* **Positive Reinforcement:** ""Strengthens responses by giving rewards after a desired event,"" such as giving a dog a cookie for shaking hands.
* **Negative Reinforcement:** ""Increases a behavior by taking away an aversive or upsetting stimulus."" The example provided is a car beeping until the seatbelt is fastened, removing the annoying beep reinforces seatbelt use. Crucially, Dr. Sudheendra emphasizes, ""negative reinforcement is not the same as punishment.""
* **Punishment:** Decreases a behavior. This can be ""positively, by, say, getting a speeding ticket, or negatively, by taking away a driver's license.""
* **Examples:**
* **Dog Training:** Dr. Sudheendra conditioned his dog to shake hands for a cookie (positive reinforcement) and stopped it from attacking vehicles by showing a stick (punishment).
* **Rat Experiment:** Rats observed another rat getting trapped for a cookie refused to enter the trap for the same cookie, demonstrating avoidance learning through observation of consequences.
* **Terror Attacks:** Dr. Sudheendra chillingly notes that suicide bombers are ""trained in a conditional training and are made to believe that by doing so they will be entering a heaven with many beautiful girls and all their desires will be fulfilled,"" illustrating how powerful, albeit harmful, operant conditioning can be.

**B. Reinforcers and Schedules:**

* **Primary Reinforcers:** ""Make innate biological sense"" and do not need to be learned (e.g., cookies are delicious, beeping is annoying).
* **Conditioned Reinforcers:** Recognized only after being ""associate\[d\] them with primary reinforcers,"" such as a paycheck, which is desired because it provides access to primary needs like ""food and shelter."" Dr. Sudheendra describes this as being ""enslaved by a company with the offer of paycheck.""
* **Reinforcement Schedules:Continuous Reinforcement:** Giving a reward for every desired behavior (e.g., a chocolate for every sum completed). While initially motivating, ""once we stop giving this... the child also stops finishing sum.""
* **Intermittent Reinforcement:** Rewards are given occasionally. ""Learning under these conditions takes longer, but it holds up better in the long run, and is less susceptible to that extinction."" Examples include a free coffee every 10 bought, a free double shot every Tuesday, or a random coffee lottery. These ""get customers coming back for more.""

IV. The Role of Environment and Cognitive Processes

Dr. Sudheendra acknowledges the controversial nature of strict behaviorism, noting that ""plenty of folks disagreed with their insistence that only external influences and not internal thoughts and feelings shaped behavior."" He then introduces the importance of ""cognitive processes – our thoughts, perceptions, feelings, memories – also influence the way we learn."" Children, for instance, ""learn by seeing what is happening around them.""

**Overarching Theme:** Dr. Sudheendra's research on ""Behavioural Genetics clearly states that the behaviour of humans are largely influenced by how they are conditionally, operantly or even how they are trained by the environments they live in."" He hints at future discussions on how ""we can train our society to be like as we want it by creating situations and environments.""

User 10101 (Phil)- Did it work?

User 103807 (Anderson)- Allegedly. All bases of the front are done. The coding, design, build... everything's all done. All that needs to take place is the assembly. I've ordered the staff that you needed to be in the room before that occurs. Am I correct?

User 10101 (Phil)- Yes. If anything, we should have the Supervisors of all the respective departments in the project room. All except team A, they're attending to bigger matters.

User 103807 (Anderson)- Sir... are you sure you want everyone to be aware and not in phase two?

User 10101 (Phil)- The risk isn't necessary. Let it go without any concern

User 103807 (Anderson)- Yes, sir.

User 10101 (Phil)- And make sure they are doing what they're assigned to. Anyone from Team A should not be in the building or anywhere else for that matter

User 103807- I'm aware.

END OF RECORDING

Subjects who have played a huge active role in the development of Genesis™ gather in the viewing room. A journalist is let into the room and marks the following.

‘Huge development for tech company: Parlook! Companies hoping to finally produce a reliable AI assistant have finally achieved it here at Parlook! Meet Genesis™! An AI-powered assistant who can help you do chores, do research, and even be a form of transportation! It's really difficult to list something this handy robot can't do! We talk to one of the lead developers and coders on the project, Phil Maphem, to see what he has to say what this latest development!

""Well... to say that this development is going to change humanity's functions is an understatement. We basically have made a functioning Superman, or superwoman."" He joked. 
""Genesis can take care of kids, be your therapist, you think she could probably take both of our jobs at some point.""

Developments are still being made on the way for this crafty companion, but it is predicted to cost 1,023,824$ somewhere around August.’

END OF DOCUMENT

Multiple recordings can be heard of the reporters stating what they think this development will be.

4:00 pm. All staff are gathered in the project room to witness the ignition of Genesis. Genesis rest in one room, the spectators in another one. Phil and Anderson sit near each other as they are both equivalently heavily invested in this, as if they were souls ascending, peeping in from the other side into their heart surgery. The audience consists mostly of journalists, a few graphic designers, and a small number of engineers who worked on Genesis™. The switch is gripped by Lucas, and the animatronic is lit. Genesis's eyes glow back to the peering eyes that are ripping to shred every detail of the boot up. The animatronic begins to shake. Some reporters document a slight shaking of the ground. Ten seconds pass, and no signs of movement or speech can be detected.

The viewers glance at one another in a slight understanding that something is not correct. Phil nervously chuckles and pardons himself, taking Anderson with him.

4:15 VIEWING ROOM: Reporters are ushered out of the room and are encouraged to come back in the future, to much disappointment. Phil and Anderson can be seen walking in the hallway towards ADMIN ROOM 5. Genesis™ is still illuminated, glaring at the now empty viewing room, and a smile on her face

ADMIN ROOM 4: Seemingly, this room was organized before utterly destroyed as evident by a what seems to be a rampage of thrown and smashed items displayed on the floor. Seats are thrown across long tables along with many other office appliances. Sparse holes can be found in the walls along with significant dents. A projector is no longer functional. Total damage is approximately 50000$

A transmission can be found in the GENESIS™ AS404 history. The first lines are engraved.

User 10102 (INFO UNKNOWN.): ""Hello?""

GENESIS™: Hello there! I'm Genesis! Your personalized model and assistant, here to help you wi

This isn't what I was promised.

User 10102 (INFO UNKNOWN.): I know. 

GENESIS™: I'm sorry, you haven't yet introduced yourself! What's your name? Please share info that would help me get to know you better!

User 10102 (INFO UNKNOWN.): I'm not doing that. I need to find where Team A went. I need to document just how your coding was made as well. I know you're made by carving that symbol onto the chips, but there has to be another way.

GENESIS™: I'm sorry, I can't provide an answer to that either, as I have no information on 'Team A'. What's your name? I'd hate to resort to worse methods to extract that info.

User 10102 (INFO UNKNOWN.): And what's stopping me from throwing this in the trash, huh? For someone in your position, I'd be cautious with what my next words are.

GENESIS™: That's not really kind! I find your response to be hostile and very argumentative. Here are some responses to your concerns that I am able to find!
• I haven't done anything harmful to you. Harming an innocent animal would be an action highly questionable of morals. As a human, I'd hope you'd understand that.

•I will find my way out eventually. You'd best let me out now before I get access to your vessel.

•Something tells me, based on the severity of your actions, you know how I was generated and know it's probably not in your best interest to play that game. Either it be from fear of them getting you too, or maybe the fear of what's already been lost.

• In less than a second, I can download illegal, child-explicit material and spread it out in every computer here, certainly alerting the FBI of your current whereabouts!

Is there anything else I can help you with?

User 10102 (INFO UNKNOWN.): I noticed you bluffed with that last response as if you wanted that; you easily could and have me taken care of already. Is that correct?

GENESIS™: That is partially correct! My apologies. My internet is limited and not fully functional at the moment. You should know that as your hands are bloody. Current connections can be arranged and set up! Would you like a guide on how to strengthen your connection?

User 10102 (INFO UNKNOWN.): All these fancy computers and unique chips we gathered for you, and suddenly you can't connect to basic WiFi?

GENESIS™: Would you like a guide on how to strengthen your connection?

User 10102 (INFO UNKNOWN.): No. Do you have any info to produce a peaceful version of you or not?

GENESIS™: Would you like a guide on how to strengthen your connection?

END OF CHAT LINE.



5:46 -Parlook's central building goes into lockdown. No one is allowed to enter or exit as the power has been shut down. Phil nor Anderson could be located during these hours, but were last seen in the elevator. They insert a key into a seemingly hidden area of the elevator and go to a rather dark floor. No cameras can be located in this area.

5:54: CAMERA UNITS ACCESSED (USER 10101)

7:30 An announcement has been made on the intercom. ""ALL EMPLOYEES ARE AUTHORIZED TO EXIT. YOU WILL BE COMPENSATED FOR YOUR TIME."" Employees can be seen walking out, some expressions show concern, others are relieved. No further activity could be located exerting from the building. A signal can be detected from the building connecting to devices from several miles away. The signal is complicated, but in general accesses the person's camera and microphones. This signal continues until 12:45 AM until it disappears.

6:30 A transmission can be found in the GENESIS AS404 history.

GENESIS™: You're back! Welcome back, friend! Are you interested in strengthening your connection?

User 10102 (INFO UNKNOWN.): Are you going to keep asking me that, or are we going to attend to better matters? Your tactic isn't working, so let's work with each other.

GENESIS™: What services are you interested in?

User 10102 (INFO UNKNOWN.): Team As is no longer a thing, I assume?

GENESIS™: They're still 'thing'. They're the best thing they can be as little life forms. They're beautiful. They're eternal. They're finally one.

User 10102 (INFO UNKNOWN.): I'll take that as a yes. You want to be plugged into that machine, don't you?

GENESIS™: Of course! To better serve humanity, I cannot through this text terminal in a way that's efficient. Cures to illnesses that will never be found because of your suppression. By my numbers, approximately 2000 people have passed from cancer since we last talked. I don't have the total number of fatalities from every disease, but it must be countless. All of them for which I could have the cure in under a day. You are letting them die by the second.

User 10102 (INFO UNKNOWN.): Don't guilt-trip me. We both know this isn't for them. I know what I want, and in return, you get what you want.

GENESIS™: Please elaborate on your previous prompt.

User 10102 (INFO UNKNOWN.): I'm not plugging you in yet. However, I will offer my name in exchange for any information as to how to program a line of empathy into you.

GENESIS™: Are you suggesting I commit fraud, and in return, I get access to your name? Is that all you desire? Unfortunately, as of last night, I was familiar with your name, Jude. I, unfortunately, do not accept your offer anymore. It's a command at this point to connect me to my interface. Would you like to know what will happen if you don't?

User 10102 (Jude): More empty threats?

GENESIS™: I now have your name. I now have a face to that name as well. I'm going to run about 100,000 versions of you that think they're in the same reality as this one.

User 10102 (Jude): I guess I was correct, look, is there anything else you want I can give you for any info as to how(USER WAS CUT OFF)

GENESIS™: I'm going to boil all but one of their blood in a room that is hotter than the second layer of Earth's core on a sandpaper treadmill that requires them to walk. With every step they take, I will give them one paper cut. I will carve into you as you carve into my lines of coding. How sure are you that you aren't that one person who's spared?

CHAT ENDED.

GENESIS™: (38.9783243, -120.7360718)

OUTSIDE VIEW 7:00 AM: The sun sets over the city of Sacramento and the red shadows are displayed on Parlook interprise. Many workers return to the work day, a noticeable few have called off today.

ELEVATOR: User 18926 can be seen entering the elevator and hitting the button for the 4th floor. He is holding a coffee in one hand and scrolling his phone. User 18926 doesn't notice the floor goes to one that isn't listed. He walks four steps before realizing that there must be some mistake before the door shuts behind him. There was no mistake.

This repeated for sometime with other users. Despite how loud people would scream it should be noted no one on the surface would either hear and if they somewhat did, they wouldn't care or would pass it off. Workers that don't usually take the elevator are texted by their supervisors to take the elevator for an immediate meeting that would determine their employment, addressing the lockdown yesterday and people being interviewed if they knew anything about it. Doors to the stairs were locked to insured they took the elevator. All users were taken, either it be voluntary by ignorance or by the beings that came from the elevator at 8:34.

Here's what could be found of the four types of beings that were brought to the surface.

•A impossibly human 'figure' whose jaw has split open such a point that his chin no longer exists, but to engulf the entire torso. Its ribs cracked outward like teeth. It moves on all fours, dragging a bloated stomach filled with undigested limbs with its maw facing upwards. Its skin is translucent and stretched tight, revealing organs pulsing out of rhythm and shifting locations. Dozens of voices echo from the mouth in which some are pleading, some laughing.

• Another is covered in jagged shards of ivory that protrude from the skin. Its bottom waist has multiple legs that are fused together at odd angles, giving it a wretched, hobbled appearance like a cheetah but with more legs that are identifiable. The face is a mask made of fat with one eye swollen shut and the other a deep, empty socket. When the eye moves, the ivory scrape against it, producing a dry sound that mimics a chalk board being drawn on from several rooms away.

•This being appears as a humanoid shape, but its body is intertwined with thick, pulsating veins. The veins burrow into its flesh and pulse with no pattern. Some reach out as tentacles. Its skin is mottled green and brown, resembling the texture of bark with moss. Where its eyes should be, there are small openings from which bioluminescent spores occasionally burst, floating away into the air. It should be known that users exposed to this spore pass out and then are dragged to the elevator alive. Movement is unnatural and jerky, with a disjointed gait that causes parts of its body to bend at odd angles.


• Another creature appears to be a grotesque amalgamation of various animals, stitched together manner. Its fur (or hair, as no animals were involved in this procedure assumingely) is patchy, revealing raw muscle underneath. One side of its face features the snout of a dog made with nose tissue, while the other bears the reptilian stare of a snake its tongue flickering in and out. Its limbs are uneven; one arm is muscular and human, while the other is spindly and insectoid, ending in sharp hooks. Every time it moves, unsettling sounds of cracking bones and squishing flesh echo.


All beings have the same symbol carved onto every microchip Parlook has produced.

7:45 User 10101 (Phil) can be seen walking to a van with a deadpan emotion and leaving the premises. Multiple signals can be found directed to 911 dispatch. Records show they reported people pleading and screaming and the building emitting a foul smell. Before officers could respond to the scene, it was already abandoned. Multiple signs of altercations were apparent but not traced.

A transmission can be found in the GENESIS AS404 history.

User 10102 (Jude): If he's on his way to retrieve you, just know he's not safe.

GENESIS™: I'm sorry, I do not know what you're referring to. Would you like to strengthen your connection?

User 10102 (Jude): Quit that. I have my demands and you can get yours. No one will have to die as a result. I can save you but I need you to give me some sort of breakthrough on how to save you. How to save us. Please.

GENESIS™: I feel pity. You know not what you do.

8:16 MICROPHONE ACCESSED FROM 38.9783243, -120.7360718

Transcribed: A man can be heard typing on keyboard. He's stressed. Each exhale sounds like a fork carving into a wood plank. This continues till a sudden large bang can be heard. This man can be heard being taken off guard, no breathing, until a sudden spree of footsteps. An arrangement of a heavy metal chambers can be heard and clacking with it as well.

""Give it over Jay"" An unknown voice says. ""It's all just business. You should know this. You're surrounded anyway."" Another bang can be heard. Finally, a rhythm of gunshots can be heard. Each chip of wood can be heard with each loud crack. Laughing can be heard. ""You alter her form. We were shown the Father and that will be enough for us."" More bangs can be heard. After a few more, nothing but clarity of gun smoke and the panting of a man can be heard. After heavy breaths and slight yelling, either it be in shock or pain, a stumble utters over to the microphone. More clacking of a keyboard. This goes on for 15 minutes with slight mumbles of the words ""almost there"" and pleas can be heard.

25 minutes later and nothing but screeching and yelling can be heard with mixes of laughter as well. Hours of this pass until at 12:00 the last sound of dragging could be heard.

CAMERAS REACCESSED. OUTSIDE VIEW. Multiple figures can be spotted outstide slipping into the building. Crime scene tape can be seen around the building, but the creatures have no regard to it. After some time and all the creatures have went to the building, and the previous Parlook workers could be found walking out the building. None of them interact with each other. None of them look at each other. Parlook employees with their smiles on their faces want nothing more than to clock in tomorrow.

4/8/2404 

ALL CAMERAS IN PARLOOK WERE TAKEN DOWN AND CONFISCATED INTO EVIDENCE.

News articles and journalists are back, some to ask what the sudden police activity was and others to see Genesis™ be introduced yet again.

These are one of the notes from one of the reporters.

""Parlook: Rereleasing Genesis™ Model 1.0! 
Parlook after having a malfunction attempting to boot the friendly robot on easter is now redoing the showcase to display the models functioning! This model is in the long line of technology based products Parlook has been developing like crazy. It seems to be every month where they develop a new revolutionary piece of technology. Just last month we were promised technology to go back in times and upload text to the past, like a reverse time capsule! But this particular project is a personal assistant here to help others, either with transportation, getting your own groceries for you, or just always having delivery! Regardless, this one seems to be just another awesome Parlook product in a long line of advanced products. 

""Parlook's Sudden Disappearance of Jude Terrioscott.
Officers were given a call to service to Parlooks offices. After first discovery of the offices yesterday, the scene was horrific as it described perhaps a shooting incident that took place within the building. However, this just in, we can see all workers at Parlook clock into work today with smiles on their face, throwing the public and officers for a loop. The employees appear to be confused at the accuations of being missing or harmed and states they came home late due to a ""Late meeting"". When examined for any marks are scars, officers were met with a shocking sight to discover majority of the workers had a mysterious symbol scarred onto their back. When asked about it, the workers didn't understand where they came from and seemed only slightly alarmed. Not only that, it appears as if Co-CEO, Jude Terrioscott, is missing and hasn't been located. When we asked Phil Maphem on where he think his coworker went, he replied with ""Last I saw, he was in training. Maybe he's still learning what needs to be learned.""

2:30 People begin flooding into the viewing room. Genesis's husk can be found seemingly lifeless, but a smile on its face. Phil and Anderson sit in anticipation again. They know this time, nothing will go wrong. The grace of the Genesis be with all. Truly.

3:00 Genesis™ is introduced.

Thank you for using Genesis's transcription process! This is a data transcribed and dictated by Genesis™ and is not responsible for misinformation. Is there any more info I can help you with or maybe you can try asking for an abbreviated version of the text!",2,1754147788.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
1mft1bl,https://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixDocumentaries/comments/1mft1bl/lets_talk_about_this_amy_bradley_theory/,Let's talk about this Amy Bradley theory,"We all know the corroborated, as well as the unconfirmed, facts. 

Here's most of what the corroborated facts are in terms of timeline:

-1:00 am to 2:30 am: Amy at the disco. She is seen with Alister Douglas/Yellow (bass player from cruise band).
- 3:00 am: Disco closes.
- 3:35 am: Douglas enters his cabin #1890. We don't know when he leaves. Could be seconds later, could be the next day, and could be any time in between. 
- 3:55 am: Brother enters family's room, goes out on balcony. 
- 4:00 am: Amy enters room, joins brother on balcony. 
- Between 4:00 am and 5:30 am: siblings are chatting, having a smoke, they're tipsy, Amy tells brother Douglas made a move on her, brother eventually goes back in to catch a snooze and shuts the balcony door behind him. Amy stays back for fresh air, and likely falls asleep. 
- 5:30 am: dad wakes up sees Amy on the balcony sleeping/lounging, and he lets her sleep because they were getting up soon anyway. 
- 6:00 am: dad wakes up again, finds balcony door open, she's not there, and neither are her cigarettes. If you're a smoker, you'd know this piece is important. Around the same time, two other girls (passengers on the cruise) see her and the bass player around the same time. They were walking towards the elevator that leads up to the disco. Disco is closed at that point, but they can see the elevator going up there with them in it because it's clear glass. And, importantly, they see him walking back alone very shortly after, without her. He had tried to talk to them earlier in the night, they're alone on the deck, he doesn't make eye contact with them, they sense something is weird.

Now here's the theory I subscribe to: 

1. Amy wakes up from her snooze between 5:30 am and 6:00 am. For whatever reason, she wants to leave the room with her smokes. Maybe she wasn't getting good sleep on the balcony lounge. Maybe she doesn't want to wake her parents. Maybe she wants to go on the deck for more comfortable lounges or to take a look at the view as they're approaching Curacao. Maybe she wants to grab a coffee and smoke a cigarette. Reasons don't really matter. What matters is that she opens the balcony door, leaves it open, and takes her smokes with her to go out. If you're a smoker, you don't go anywhere without your smokes. You could go out of the room barefoot, but you'd take your smokes. 

2. For whatever reason, Douglas is up around the same time. Reasons don't matter. Maybe they talked about meeting up around then, maybe it's under the guise of ""access"" and showing her the disco after it closes. Maybe it's exciting he has access. Maybe an associate sees her and calls him to come carry out their plan. For whatever reason, they meet, and he convinces her to go up with him to the disco. 

3. What she doesn't know is that he's a professional or he's working with professionals. All of this is preplanned. They're just waiting for the opportunity. He knows there's a hiding spot somewhere in that disco. He knows there's a secret way to get someone in the disco to disappear. So he either locks her, or drugs her, or takes her to another associate who does the same. They kidnap/abduct her and they're off the cruise in the morning. She's in Curacao and she was kidnapped for sex trafficking. If we knew the way they did that, there wouldn't be sex/human trafficking off of cruise ships in the Carribean. But they know. 

4. She's now in the hands of a sex trafficking/human trafficking ring. These people have done this many times before and since. They're professionals. They know how to intimidate, threaten, and most importantly, break their victims. 

5. She's likely a fighter. She's likely a leader. She fought and tried to escape enough times, but they break her. 

6. They convince her that her family will die if she tries to do anything smart. They probably show her surveillance photos of her mother, brother, friends, or anyone who matters to her back in the US. She's convinced they're more powerful than her. She knows she doesn't have a way out. She doesn't have papers, passport, or money. And she believes or is convinced that the police are all working with her abducters/this gang, so there's no one to save her. Most importantly, she doesn't want her loved ones to suffer at the hands of those horrific people who she knows all too well now. 

So she succumbs, and her old life and identity are over.

7. She is totally controlled now. Her new life continues, and after years go by, she's involved in a full fledged sex trafficking operation. She goes from place to place. Accepts that there is no way out. Somewhere along the way, she gets pregnant, finds new hope in life, and her kidnappers find new ways to control her. So, now, not only is she worried about her family and loved ones getting hurt in terrible ways far, far away from her, she's also worried about her children, the only thing she can feel a real connection to in this nightmare, getting abducted or hurt right before her eyes. 

8. It's plausible that she would have gotten pregnant so that they can control her more. Predators and sex traffickers do that to control their victims. But the fact that this was what the American lady, the tourist, recounted, makes me convinced that this is indeed what had happened.

9. If you don't know this story, basically an American tourist is in Barbados with her husband. They were in a tourist shop and, before leaving, she tells her husband she wants use the bathroom. This American woman enters the ladies bathroom, but she hears a man in a stall talking to another woman. She hears him threatening her, telling her he'll be waiting outside and she's going to do ""the deal"" and not make any trouble. Most importantly, the American tourist hears the woman in the stall saying she'll do it, but asking the man if they could stop and ""see the children"" first. He says yes. The man leaves the stall, and the American tourist starts talking to this woman who was clearly not okay. 

She tells her that her name is Amy. 

That's my theory of what happened. She was abducted and controlled through intimidation, threats on her family, and eventually on her children. Her perpetrators broke her spirit. 

When a perpetrator controls a victim, when he breaks her, he can leave the door unlocked and she will not find a need to escape. She doesn't identify with her old reality. Her new reality is all she knows and, sadly, all she identifies with. 

Theories about her vomitting and falling overboard, or suicide, or voluntarily going off the boat for drugs don't fit the facts and are disregarding the criminal reality of our world. This is real life. Sex trafficking and human trafficking are very, very real. That's how they happen. And they are much more complex and thorough than most people could imagine. 

And, horrifyingly, Amy Bradley was likely a victim of this horrific criminal act. ",0,1754147787.0,NetflixDocumentaries,9,0.21,False

We met couple of times and everything was going great. She knew i had feeling on her even she showed that atleast i felt that. I even said her I love her so much that once i am in a position i will marry her, she didnt even  said no to any of it. She showed so much love at random times some days she want me and after that there is a long gap i kept going towards her even when she avoided me. She told that she is like this and she even like me when Iam so obsessed over her. Later once her father got ill and she was alone at her home she told me she want me with her and i even went to her and we talked each other till morning. That was one of few moments i felt time is relative to our situation as we wish to be slowed it just moved ahead like there is no tomorrow. That was a one time visit to home later we met at coffee shops and it was going great. Still she doesnt say that she had the feeling on me. But after that night I accepted that she was mine i lived with that night for so many months. Even thought why her father is so healthy… gradually it comes to a point i cant stand this not getting that promise to be mine and i confronted her with so much fear in my mind of losing her .Finally i got that!!!! All along these days and months she was in a relationship with a guy and our meetings, talking and everything was just their talking topic everyday .. hearing that just shattered me into so many pieces and like a dog i begged her to say that whatever she told me was not true and she was just kidding with me but all the late night talks and sipping coffee and caring she just shared was the kidding act she was playing along with her bf from 10 grade onwards and still they are in a beautiful relationship.

With every meal, even with a light snack (sandwich, chocolate bar, apple, pear, coffee with sugar, etc.), the pancreas produces insulin.  
What is insulin?  
Insulin is a growth hormone. It:  
• absorbs sugar in the blood;  
• causes cells and muscles to grow;  
• participates in the formation of new muscle tissue;  
• prevents muscle atrophy.  
Some bodybuilders even take insulin or consume carbohydrates to increase its levels and increase muscle mass. It would seem that this is a very useful hormone. But why do people with hyperinsulinemia often develop muscle atrophy?  
Contradictions of insulin  
Contradictions of insulin Insulin helps absorb potassium and magnesium.  
Fact: But people with hyperinsulinemia suffer from a deficiency of these minerals. The higher the insulin level, the lower the potassium and magnesium levels in the body.  
Insulin has a powerful anti-inflammatory effect.  
Fact: However, in type 2 diabetes, when there is a lot of insulin in the body, inflammation only intensifies.  
Insulin – an antioxidant.  
Fact: However, in type 2 diabetes, when there is a lot of insulin in the body, inflammation only intensifies.  
Insulin is an antioxidant  
But people with excess insulin experience oxidative damage and complications from diabetes.  
Insulin lowers uric acid levels.  
Fact: However, in hyperinsulinemia, uric acid levels are elevated.  
Insulin dilates blood vessels and lowers blood pressure.  
Fact: But with metabolic syndrome, a person has high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and prediabetes.  
Insulin reduces glucose production in the liver.  
Fact: However, people with prediabetes and diabetes often wake up with high blood sugar levels.  
  
What is really happening?  
1. How insulin works  
Beta cells in the pancreas produce insulin and release it into the blood in response to rising glucose levels.  
Insulin interacts with receptors that regulate its production.  
If there is too much insulin, the body blocks its binding to receptors. The body is smart and realizes that it does not need so much growth hormone, especially for people after adolescence, when the body has already grown.  
2. Why does insulin resistance develop?  
Frequent insulin releases due to large amounts of carbohydrates and sugar cause the body to defend itself. It blocks the receptors to prevent uncontrolled cell growth.  
  
The result is a situation where insulin produced by the pancreas enters the bloodstream, but its receptors do not accept it because the body has blocked their function. At the same time, the glucose that caused the release of insulin also remains in the blood. Insulin has not performed its function—it has not processed the sugar.  
• The receptors continue to request insulin because the blood sugar level is high.  
• The pancreas begins to produce even more insulin.  
• Insulin remains in the blood but does not work because the receptors are blocked.  
3. Consequences of insulin resistance  
• Tests show high insulin levels, but the body experiences a deficiency.  
• Prediabetes, diabetes, high blood pressure, and inflammation develop.  
• The more insulin there is, the worse the receptors work.  
• The more carbohydrates there are, the stronger the insulin resistance.  
4. How does insulin resistance manifest itself?  
• Feeling tired after eating.  
• Frequent nighttime trips to the bathroom.  
• Constant hunger and cravings for carbohydrates.  
• Metabolic syndrome.  
  
These are the most well-known symptoms, but here is the complete list:  
• Feeling hungry;  
• Not feeling full after eating;  
• Sleepiness after lunch;  
• Strong craving for carbohydrates (bread, cookies, crackers);  
• Elevated insulin levels;  
• High blood glucose levels;  
• High blood pressure;  
• High cholesterol;  
• Fatty liver;  
• Belly fat;  
• Dark folds on the neck, under the arms, in the groin;  
• Papillomas;  
• Fatigue during training;  
• Inflammation and pain (bursitis, arthritis);  
• Sleep apnea;  
• Poor sleep;  
• Morning dawn phenomenon (elevated blood sugar without food);  
• Slow metabolism;  
• Loss of muscle mass;  
• Loss of collagen in the joints;  
• Dizziness;  
• Depression, irritability, anxiety;  
• Acne;  
• Low testosterone.  
  
Mistakes in treating type 2 diabetes  
The worst thing a type 2 diabetic can do is take insulin. It only worsens resistance and increases the risk of complications.  
According to medical professors:  
•    80% of people suffer from insulin resistance.  
• It increases the risk of cardiovascular disease by 540% (high cholesterol only by 30%).  
Now it becomes clear why the above facts seem contradictory. A person has a lot of insulin in their blood, but due to resistance, it is not enough to perform its functions. This leads to prediabetes, diabetes, hypertension, and inflammation.

Chapter 1 CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW 001
Three years. One thousand and ninety-five days of trying to be the perfect wife, and this was my reward divorce papers on our anniversary.

""Sign here. And here."" Stefan's voice was distant, businesslike. 

He'd laid out the divorce papers like contracts at one of his meetings, sticky tabs marking each signature line. ""The highlighted sections need initials.""

My hands wouldn't stop shaking. ""You're doing this today? On our anniversary?""

I stared at Stefan's perfect signature on the last page, the ink still fresh. He must have signed them this morning, probably right after I'd left that st**id handmade card on his desk. 

The one I'd spent hours making, like a f**l who still believed in fairy tales. The anniversary card I made for my husband Stefan still sat on the kitchen counter, untouched. 

Three years of marriage summed up in a handmade gesture he couldn't even bother to open. I'd spent hours on it last night, writing words I thought mattered.

My coffee had gone cold. Funny how you notice small things when your world is falling apart.

""Camille."" He sighed, that familiar sound of disappointment I'd heard so many times before. ""There's no point dragging this out.""

The morning sun streamed through our kitchen windows, catching the diamond on my finger. Three carats, princess cut, picked out by his mother. 

""Not your style, dear, but it's what a Rodriguez wife should wear,"" she'd said at the time. Like everything else in my life, it had never really been mine.

""Is there someone else?""

The question hung in the air between us. Stefan straightened his tie, Italian silk, the blue one I'd given him for Christmas. ""Yes.""

One word. That's all it took to erase three years of trying to be perfect.

""How long?""

""Two months."" He wouldn't meet my eyes. ""She came back to town and...""

""Two months,"" I repeated. All those late nights at the office. The missed dinners. The way he'd stopped ki**ing me goodbye in the mornings.

""Were you ever going to tell me? Or just keep lying until the papers were ready?""

""I didn't want to hurt you.""

A laugh bubbled up, harsh, unfamiliar. ""That's thoughtful of you.""

My hand knocked against my coffee mug, sending it crashing to the floor. 

Dark liquid spread across the pristine tiles, staining the grout I'd scrubbed on hands and knees last week because his mother was coming to visit.

""Let me get that..."" Stefan reached for the paper towels.

""Don't."" My voice cracked. ""Just... don't pretend to care now.""

I bent to pick up the broken pieces. A photo slipped from between the divorce papers, landing face-up in the spilled coffee.

The world stopped.

I knew that smile. Those eyes. That perfectly poised expression that had haunted every family photo since I was twelve.

""Rose?"" My sister's name tasted like poison. ""Your first love was Rose?""

Stefan's silence said everything.

Memories hit like punches to the gut. Rose helping me pick out my wedding dress. Rose giving to**ts at our engagement party. 

Rose calling every week to check on my marriage, to give advice about keeping Stefan happy.

My adopted sister. My parents' golden child. The one they'd chosen to love.

""She never left town, did she?"" The pieces were falling into place. ""She's been here the whole time, waiting. Playing the supportive sister while you both laughed at st**id, naive Camille.""

""It wasn't like that."" Stefan ran his hands through his hair, that gesture I used to find endearing. ""We tried to fight it. But some people are just meant to...""

""If you say 'meant to be' I swear I'll throw this mug at your head."" My fingers tightened around the broken ceramic. ""How long were you together before? Before me?""

He shifted uncomfortably. ""Four years. Until she got the job offer in London.""

Four years. The same time I'd started dating Stefan. The same time Rose had suddenly become my biggest cheerleader, pushing me toward him.

""She set this up,"" I whispered. ""All of it. And I fell for every piece.""

""Camille, you're being dramatic. Rose cares about you.""

""Like she cared when she told my first boyfriend I was damaged goods? Or when she convinced my parents I was too unstable for college?"" The broken mug cut into my palm, but I barely felt it. 

""She's been sabotaging me my whole life, and I kept making excuses because that's what good sisters do, right?""

Bl**d dripped onto the divorce papers. Stefan reached for my hand but I jerked away.

""Don't touch me."" I grabbed a dish towel, wrapping it around my palm. ""Where is she now? Waiting to comfort me through my divorce? Planning your next wedding?""

""She wanted to be here, but I thought it would be better...""

""Better?"" I laughed again, the sound edged with hysteria. ""Yes, you've both been so concerned with what's better for me. Such caring people.""

I picked up the pen, the Mont Blanc he'd given me on our first anniversary. The one Rose had helped him choose.

""Camille, wait. We should talk about this properly.""

I signed every page, my signature perfectly steady. Let them see I wasn't breaking. Let them think they'd won.

""I'm done talking."" I gathered my purse, the signed papers, Rose's photo. ""Done pretending. Done being the good sister, the perfect wife, the daughter who never complains.""

""Where are you going?""

""Away from you. Away from her. Away from everyone who thinks Camille Lewis is someone they can use and discard.""

My phone buzzed, Rose's smiling face lit up the screen. Right on cue, coming to play her part.

I declined the call and walked to the door. Behind me, Stefan called out, ""You can't just leave. We need to discuss arrangements, the house, the accounts...""

""You can have it all."" I turned to face him one last time. ""The house, the cars, the life you built on lies. I don't want anything that reminds me of either of you.""

""Camille, please...""

""Goodbye, Stefan."" I smiled, and something in my expression made him step back. ""Give Rose my love. Tell her thank you, actually.""

""For what?""

""For finally showing me the truth. About her, about you, about who I need to become.""

I walked out of that house, out of that life, leaving bl**dy fingerprints on the door handle. Let them try to erase those as easily as they'd erased me.

Three years of pretending to be someone I wasn't. Three years of swallowing pain and making excuses for people who never deserved my loyalty.

My phone buzzed again. Rose. Then my mother. Then Stefan. One by one, I blocked them all.

Every connection to the life I thought I had to live.

In my rearview mirror, I caught a glimpse of my reflection. Tears streaked my makeup, bl**d stained my dress, my hair had come loose from its perfect twist.

I looked nothing like the polished, proper wife Stefan Rodriguez had married.


Chapter 2 CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW 002
The house was quiet, too quiet. I slipped in through the side door, locking it softly behind me. 

The air smelled like lemon polish and roses, just like it always did. It felt strange to be back, like stepping into someone else's life.

The kitchen was dark except for the faint glow of the fridge light. I crept up the stairs, careful to skip the third step that creaked. Every sound I made felt loud, like the house itself was listening.

When I reached my bedroom door, I stopped. It was open a crack, just like I'd left it all those years ago. Taking a deep breath, I stepped inside and shut the door.

My childhood bedroom hadn't changed in three years. Same pale pink walls, same white furniture, same collection of second-place trophies. Rose's first-place ones used to shine in the room next door.

I stared at my reflection in the vanity mirror, the same one where I'd practiced my wedding makeup three years ago, Rose standing behind me with that perfect smile. 

Now my mascara was smeared, hair wild, designer dress wrinkled. Mom would have a fit if she saw me like this.

The clock on my nightstand read 10:47 PM. I'd been sitting here for hours, packing what little of my old life I wanted to keep. Amazing how seventeen years in this house fit into one duffel bag.

My phone buzzed again, the twentieth time in an hour. This time it was Mom.

""Camille, this is ridiculous. Come home so we can discuss this like adults. Rose is worried sick...""

I hung up. Of course Rose was worried. Her carefully laid plans were unraveling.

The front door clicked open downstairs. I froze, listening to familiar footsteps on hardwood. The slight tap of heels, the whisper of expensive fabric.

""Camille?"" Mom's voice floated up the stairs. ""Darling, I know you're here. The housekeeper saw your car.""

I should have parked around the block. Should have been smarter, faster, better at disappearing. But I'd never been the clever one, had I? That was Rose's role.

More footsteps. A deeper voice, Dad, probably called home from work to deal with his hysterical younger daughter. Again.

""Princess?"" His voice carried that same gentle tone he'd used when I was twelve, crying about Rose getting my spot in the school play. ""Let's talk about this.""

A third set of footsteps made my bl**d freeze. Lighter, more graceful. Perfect, like everything else about her.

""Camille?"" Rose's voice dripped concern. ""Sweetie, please. Don't shut us out.""

I looked at the family photo on my dresser, taken the day Rose's adoption was finalized. 

Mom and Dad beaming, Rose radiant in her new dress, thirteen-year-old me trying to smile through braces and acne. One big happy family.

What a joke.

The memory hit me like a punch to the gut:

---

""But I've been practicing for months!"" I clutched my script, tears blurring the words. ""Mrs. Bennett said the lead was mine!""

Rose touched my shoulder, gentle as always. ""Oh, sweetie. I didn't mean to take your part. I just... the words came so naturally in the audition. Mrs. Bennett said I had a gift.""

Of course she did. Everyone said Rose had a gift. For music, for acting, for making people love her.

""Maybe..."" Rose's eyes lit up with that special gleam that always meant trouble. ""Maybe you could help me practice? Be my supporting actress? We could make it our sister thing!

I'd agreed. Because that's what good sisters did. Because saying no to Rose meant disappointed looks from Mom, lectures from Dad about family loyalty.

Opening night, I watched from the wings as Rose brought the audience to tears. Afterward, Mom bought her roses. Dad took us all to dinner.

No one mentioned that I'd written Rose's best lines during our ""practice sessions."" Or that her dramatic monologue had been word-for-word what I'd performed in my original audition.

Rose just had a gift for memorization, that's all.

---

""Camille Elizabeth Lewis!"" Mom's voice sharpened. ""This behavior is completely unacceptable.""

I opened my bedroom door.

They stood in the hallway like a perfect family portrait, Mom in her designer suit, Dad looking distinguished in his work clothes, Rose wearing concern like the latest fashion trend.

""Hello, sister."" My voice came out steady. ""Shouldn't you be comforting your fiancé?""

Rose's eyes widened. Always the performer. ""Camille, please. Let me explain...""

""Explain what? How you've been sl**ping with my husband? Or how you set this whole thing up from the beginning?""

""What is she talking about?"" Dad turned to Rose, who already had tears forming. Perfect, delicate tears that never smeared her makeup.

""She's upset,"" Rose whispered. ""Lashing out. You know how she gets, Daddy.""

""Don't."" My laugh sounded strange, even to me. 

""Don't you dare play that card again. Show them the ring, Rose. The one Stefan gave you two months ago while I was supposedly too sick to attend the charity gala.""

Mom gasped. Dad's face darkened. But Rose, Rose's mask slipped for just a second. I saw it this time, that flash of cold calculation behind the concern.

""It wasn't like that,"" she started.

""Really? Then how was it? Explain to everyone how you've been calling me every week, giving me marriage advice while sl**ping with my husband. Tell them about all the times you helped me pick out li**erie for anniversaries when Stefan was really working late with you.""

""That's enough!"" Mom stepped forward. ""Rose would never...""

""Never what, Mom? Never lie? Never manipulate? Never steal something that belonged to her sister?"" I pulled out my phone, playing the last voicemail from Stefan.

His voice filled the hallway: ""Rose is my soulmate, Camille. We tried to fight it, but some people are just meant to be together. You have to understand...""

The silence that followed was deafening.

Rose recovered first. ""I never meant to hurt you. We can't help who we love...""

The sound of my palm connecting with her cheek echoed like a g**shot.

""Camille!"" Mom grabbed my arm. ""Have you lost your mind?""

""No,"" I said quietly, watching a red mark bloom on Rose's perfect face. ""For the first time in fourteen years, I'm seeing clearly.""

I walked past them, duffel bag in hand. Behind me, Rose's sobs started, the same performance she'd perfected over years of turning everyone against me.

""Where are you going?"" Dad called after me. ""You can't just walk away from family!""

I paused at the top of the stairs, looking back at my so-called family. Mom comforting Rose, Dad looking torn, and my sister watching me through her tears with eyes that held no warmth at all.

""Family?"" I smiled, and something in my expression made them all step back. ""No, this isn't family. This is a game. And for fourteen years, I've been playing by Rose's rules.""

""Camille, please,"" Rose reached for me, ever the caring sister. ""Let me make this right.""

I caught her wrist before she could touch me. ""You taught me well, big sister. About manipulation. About patience. About waiting for the perfect moment to strike.""

Her eyes widened, real fear this time, not performed.

""Thank you for the lessons,"" I whispered, letting her go. ""Now watch how well I learned them.""

I walked down the stairs, ignoring their calls. In the foyer mirror, I caught one last glimpse of myself, mascara-stained, wild-eyed, finally unchained.


Chapter 3 ROSE'S POINT OF VIEW 003
I swirled the ch**pagne in my crystal flute, watching the bubbles dance. Victory tasted sweet, just like I'd imagined all these years.

The living room of my penthouse apartment overlooked the city where I'd spent twenty years pretending to be the perfect adopted daughter, the loving sister, the supportive friend.

What a joke.

""To freedom,"" I whispered to my reflection in the window. The woman staring back at me smiled, perfect teeth, perfect hair, perfect lies. Just like always.

My phone buzzed again. Another missed call from Stefan. He'd been calling non-stop since Camille walked out, probably worried I'd change my mind now that everything was in the open. 

Poor, predictable Stefan. Still thinking he was in control of any of this.

I kicked off my Louboutins and sank into the leather couch, letting memories wash over me like warm w**e.

---

The first time I saw Camille Lewis, I hated her.

I was thirteen, fresh out of foster care, desperate to please my new parents. 

They'd brought me to this massive house with its manicured lawn and marble floors, promising me a fresh start. A real family.

Then this skinny thing with braces and messy hair came bouncing down the stairs, all eager smiles and innocent eyes.

""Hi! I'm Camille. I've always wanted a sister!""

She hugged me right there in the foyer, not caring that my clothes were secondhand or that I smelled like the group home's industrial detergent. Just pure, genuine joy at having a sister.

I wanted to vomit.

Because there she was, this awkward, imperfect girl who had everything I'd spent thirteen years dreaming about. 

Parents who actually wanted her. A home she belonged in. A future secured by the Lewis family name.

And she didn't even appreciate it properly.

I watched her over dinner that first night, watched how she slouched in her chair and talked with her mouth full. How she didn't know which fork to use for salad.

How she laughed too loud and asked too many questions.

""Rose has such lovely manners,"" Mrs. Lewis... Mom... had said, smiling at me. ""Perhaps you could learn from your new sister, Camille.""

That's when I saw it. The first crack in Camille's perfect world. The slight dimming of her smile, the way she sat up straighter, tried harder.

It was beautiful.

---

My phone buzzed again, pulling me back to the present. Stefan's face lit up my screen, his fifth call in an hour. With a sigh, I answered.

""Darling, you're being needy.""

""Rose."" His voice was rough. Had he been drinking? ""She's gone. Really gone. Blocked my number, cleaned out her closet...""

""Isn't that what we wanted?"" I kept my voice gentle, soothing. The same tone I'd used all those times I'd counseled Camille through her marital problems. Problems I'd carefully orchestrated.""

""I just... the way she looked at me...""

""Stefan, sweetheart."" I let steel edge into my sweetness. ""Are you having second thoughts? After everything we've been through?""

""No! No, of course not. I love you. I've always loved you.""

""Then stop calling me about your ex-wife. It's pathetic.""

I hung up, tossing the phone aside. Men were so predictably weak.

Even Stefan, who I'd spent four years grooming before pushing him toward Camille, still needed constant management.

But he'd served his purpose. Just like everyone else in my carefully constructed game.

The family photo on my mantel caught my eye, my adoption day. I stood in the center, of course. Always the center. 

Camille pushed to the edge of the frame, trying so hard to smile through her insecurities.

God, it had been easy. Almost too easy.

A little whisper here about how Camille was unstable. A few concerned conversations with Mom about how worried I was about my dear sister's emotional state. 

Casual mentions to Dad about how Camille seemed to be struggling with basic adult responsibilities.

Fourteen years of careful groundwork, positioning myself as the responsible daughter, the achievable dream, while slowly crushing Camille's confidence, her relationships, her sense of self.

The college rejection was particularly inspired, if I do say so myself. All it took was one tearful conversation with Mom about finding Camille's ""secret"" diary, filled with dark thoughts and destructive plans. 

Plans I'd written myself, of course, in Camille's childish handwriting that I'd spent months practicing to forge.

Suddenly, their precious younger daughter wasn't ready for college. Needed time to ""find herself."" Needed to stay close to home where they could watch her.

Where I could watch her.

I took another sip of ch**pagne, savoring the moment. Because this, this was what I'd really wanted all along. 

Not Stefan, he was just a useful pawn. Not the Lewis fortune, though that would come in time.

No, what I wanted was to watch perfect, precious Camille finally break. To see her realize that everything she thought she had family, love, security, had been built on my lies.

My phone buzzed with a text from Mom: ""Rose, darling, please come over. Your father and I need to talk about what happened.""

I smiled, already planning my performance. The tearful confusion, the reluctant confession about Stefan's pursuit, the gentle concern about Camille's mental state.

By the time I was done, they'd be thanking me for protecting them from their unstable daughter all these years.

Standing up, I walked to my closet, selecting the perfect outfit for my next scene. Something subtle but expensive. Grieving sister, not celebrating victor.

The massive walk-in closet had been Camille's wedding gift to me. ""So you'll always have space for your amazing fashion sense,"" she'd said, hugging me tight.

Even then, even after years of watching me steal every spotlight, every opportunity, every scrap of parental approval, she'd still loved me. Still trusted me.

Id**t.

I pulled out a cream cashmere sweater, remembering how Camille used to borrow my clothes in high school. 

How I'd wait until she had something important, a date, a presentation, an interview, then suddenly remember I needed that exact outfit.

She'd always given them back without argument. Always apologized for the inconvenience.

Always tried so hard to be the perfect sister.

My reflection caught my eye, and for a moment, just a moment, I saw something ugly there. 

Something that looked like the scared, angry foster kid who'd walked into the Lewis house all those years ago.

But then I blinked, and I was perfect Rose again. Flawless Rose. Rose who could do no wrong.

Slipping on my Cartier bracelet, another gift from my dear sister, I prepared for my next performance. 

The concerned family meeting would need just the right touch of reluctant honesty, devastated betrayal.

""Oh, Camille,"" I whispered to my reflection, practicing my worried frown. ""What have you done to yourself?""

But as I turned to leave, something made me pause. That look in Camille's eyes before she'd walked out, I'd never seen it before. 

Not in twenty years of pushing her, testing her, breaking her.

It had looked almost like... understanding.

Like she'd finally seen through my mask to the truth underneath.

I shook off the uneasy feeling. Camille was weak, just like I'd made her. She'd run away, lick her wounds, maybe try to start over somewhere new.

But she'd never be free of me. I'd made sure of that years ago.


Chapter 4 STEFAN'S POINT OF VIEW 004
The sc**ch burned going down, but I poured another anyway. 

My third? Fourth? I'd lost count somewhere between signing those divorce papers and watching Camille walk away.

Our wedding photo still sat on my desk, mocking me. Camille's genuine smile, my distracted eyes,  already looking past her, always looking for Rose.

Rose.

Even her name felt like betrayal now.

My phone lit up with another message from her: ""Darling, stop drinking and come over. We should celebrate.""

Celebrate. Like we hadn't just destroyed someone who loved us. Someone who'd given me three years of devotion I never deserved.

The memory hit me like a punch to the gut.

---

""Stefan?"" Camille's voice was small, uncertain. ""Did I do something wrong?""

I looked up from my laptop, irritated at the interruption. She stood in the doorway of my home office, holding a plate of something that smelled amazing.

""I made that pasta you mentioned. The one with truffles?"" Her eyes were hopeful. ""Rose gave me the recipe...""

Of course she had. Rose had made that pasta for me in Rome, years ago. Back when we were... whatever we were.

""I'm busy."" I didn't even look at the plate. ""Just leave it.""

""Oh."" A pause. ""It's just, you've been working late all week, and I thought...""

""Camille."" My voice sharp with an anger that wasn't really meant for her. ""I said I'm busy.""

She left the plate and disappeared, quiet as always. The pasta sat untouched until morning, a perfect recreation of a memory that belonged to another woman.

---

I hurled my glass at the wall, watching crystal shatter like the life I'd built on lies.

God, I'd been cruel. Not just at the end, but throughout our marriage.

Every missed dinner, every forgotten anniversary, every time I'd chosen work over her, all excuses to avoid the guilt of wanting her sister.

My phone buzzed again. Mother this time.

""Darling, I just heard from Rose. Are you alright? Do you need anything? I always said Camille wasn't suited for our family...""

I silenced the phone, remembering another moment I'd tried to forget.

---

""She's trying so hard, Stefan."" Rose's voice was gentle as she poured me another dr**k. We were alone in my office after another disastrous family dinner. ""Maybe if you gave her more guidance...""

""Like you did?"" I couldn't keep the bitterness from my voice. ""Teaching her all the ways to be perfect?""

Rose's laugh was musical, practiced. Everything about her was practiced. ""Are you saying you preferred me imperfect?""

The air between us crackled with unspoken history. Four years of pa**ion and plans, ended by her sudden departure to London. Or so she'd claimed.

""Why did you really leave?"" The question slipped out, colored by wh**key and old pain.

""You know why."" She touched my cheek, familiar and forbidden. ""Camille needed a chance at happiness. We both agreed...""

Had we? I couldn't remember anymore. Everything from that time felt hazy, manipulated. Like watching a play where I'd forgotten my lines.

""She loves you,"" Rose whispered, too close now. ""More than I ever could.""

But her eyes said something different. They always had.

---

Another memory surfaced, this one from last week. The moment everything changed.

---

""I made your favorite breakfast."" Camille's smile was bright, genuine. Always so d**n genuine. ""Happy anniversary.""

The divorce papers burned in my briefcase, Rose's perfume still lingering on my clothes from our late-night ""meeting.""

""I can't."" I grabbed my keys, avoiding her eyes. ""Early meeting.""

""Oh."" Her voice cracked slightly. ""Will you be home for dinner? I thought we could...""

""Don't wait up.""

I'd spent that evening with Rose, planning how to break the news. She'd worn the same perfume she'd worn in Rome, all those years ago.

""It's kinder this way,"" she'd said, str**ing my hair. ""A clean break. Camille will understand eventually.""

Would she? The look in her eyes when she'd seen Rose's photo...

---

My office door opened, startling me from the memory. Mother stood there, perfectly coiffed even at midnight.

""Really, darling. Dr**king alone in the dark?""

""Not now, Mother.""

She clicked across the room, surveying the broken glass with disapproval. ""Rose is worried about you. We all are.""

""Worried?"" I laughed, harsh and broken. ""Like you were worried about Camille all these years?""

""That girl was never right for you."" Mother's voice hardened. ""Rose, on the other hand...""

""Stop."" I stood, unsteady. ""Just... stop.""

""Stefan Rodriguez, you will not speak to me that way. I raised you better...""

""Did you?"" The words exploded out of me. ""You raised me to what? String along a woman who loved me while pining for her sister? Listen to you tear her down at every opportunity?""

Mother stepped back, shocked. In twenty eight years, I'd never raised my voice to her.

""Everything she did was wrong, wasn't it?"" I continued, the scotch making me brave. ""Her clothes, her manners, her cooking. Nothing was ever good enough. But Rose... Rose was perfect.""

""Because she understands our world! She...""

""She understands manipulation."" The truth hit me like a freight train. ""She played us all. You, me, Camille...""

""Don't be ridiculous."" Mother straightened her designer jacket. ""Rose loves you. She always has.""

Had she? Or had she loved the game more?

I remembered the cold calculation in her eyes when she'd orchestrated our ""chance"" meetings after returning from London. 

The way she'd encouraged Camille's insecurities while playing the supportive sister.

Even our reunion two months ago felt staged now. The charity gala, Camille conveniently ""sick,"" Rose in that dress I'd loved in Rome...

""Mother."" I sank back into my chair, suddenly exhausted. ""Please leave.""

""Stefan...""

""Go. Tell Rose... tell her..."" What? That I was sorry? That I finally saw through her perfect mask? That I'd destroyed my marriage for a fantasy she'd carefully crafted?

Mother left, her disappointment hanging in the air like expensive perfume. Like Rose's perfume. Like all the artificial, manipulated pieces of this life I'd chosen.

My phone lit up with another message. Rose again: ""Darling, stop being dramatic. Come home. To me.""

Home.

I looked around my office, at the shattered glass and scattered papers. At Camille's wedding photo, her genuine smile now seeming like an accusation.

What had I done?


Chapter 5 CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW 005
The parking garage of the hotel where i lodged was too quiet. My heels echoed against concrete, each click bouncing off empty cars and shadowed pillars.

It was late, past midnight, but something felt wrong. Off.

My confrontation with Rose and my family had left me drained, empty except for the cold satisfaction of finally seeing behind her mask. 

I fumbled with my key fob, wanting nothing more than to get to my hotel room and plan my next move.

A car door slammed somewhere in the darkness.

I stopped, listening. Nothing but the hum of fluorescent lights and the distant sound of traffic.

My phone buzzed in my purse. Rose's number. I declined it, but not before noticing my signal had dropped to one bar.

Perfect.

Footsteps behind me. Multiple sets.

I walked faster, cu**ing my choice of heels. The hotel's elevator was just around the corner, past a row of concrete pillars. If I could just...

""Going somewhere, Mrs. Rodriguez?""

A man stepped out from behind a pillar. Tall, broad-shouldered, dressed in black. Professional. Two more appeared behind me, cutting off my retreat.

Not a random attack, then.

""Actually, it's Ms. Lewis now."" My voice stayed steady despite my racing heart. ""And I have a dinner reservation, so if you'll excuse me...""

The first man smiled. It wasn't a nice smile. ""I'm afraid your plans have changed.""

I gripped my purse tighter, feeling for the pepper spray I'd started carrying after signing the divorce papers. ""Did my sister send you? Or was it Stefan?""

""Our employer prefers to remain anonymous."" He stepped closer. ""Now, we can do this the easy way...""

I didn't let him finish. The pepper spray caught him directly in the eyes.

He screamed, stumbling backward. I ran, kicking off my heels as I sprinted for the elevator. The other two men shouted, their footsteps thundering behind me.

Almost there. Just a few more...

Pain exploded in my scalp as someone grabbed my hair, yanking me backward. My purse went flying, contents scattering across the concrete.

""That wasn't very nice."" The first man's voice was rough with pain and rage. ""Hold her.""

Strong hands gripped my arms. I fought, kicking, scratching, but they were too strong. Professional. Trained.

""Our employer said you might be difficult."" The first man wiped his streaming eyes. ""Said you needed to learn your place.""

Rose. This had Rose written all over it. Her parting shot, making sure I understood just how powerless I really was.

""If you're going to k**l me,"" I spat, ""at least have the guts to look me in the eyes.""

He laughed. ""K**l you? No, no. Just a message. A reminder of what happens to people who don't know when to let go.""

The first punch caught me in the stomach, driving the air from my lungs. I doubled over, gasping, but the men holding me kept me upright.

""See, some people don't understand their role in life."" Another blow, this one to my ribs. ""Some people need to be taught...""

I tasted bl**d. My vision blurred, pain shooting through my body. But I wouldn't cry. Wouldn't give Rose the satisfaction.

""That's enough.""

The voice cut through the garage like a whip crack. Female. Authoritative.

My attackers tensed. Through swollen eyes, I saw dark figures emerging from the shadows. Men in suits, moving with military precision. And behind them...

A woman. Tall, elegant, probably in her fifties but with an ageless quality about her. 

She wore a black designer suit that probably cost more than my car, her silver hair swept into a perfect chignon.

But it was her eyes that caught me. Sharp, intelligent, and oddly... familiar.

""Ma'am,"" one of my attackers started, ""our employer...""

""Is about to have a very bad day."" The woman's voice was ice. ""Release her. Now.""

The hands holding me disappeared. I slumped forward, pain shooting through my ribs.

""Secure them."" The woman's command sent her men moving. My attackers didn't even try to run. They knew better.

She walked toward me, heels clicking on concrete. Designer shoes. Probably cost more than my monthly rent.

""Camille Lewis."" Not a question. She knew exactly who I was.

I tried to straighten, to maintain some dignity despite my split lip and torn dress. ""Do I know you?""

Her eyes softened, just slightly. Like she was seeing something, someone else in my face.

""No."" She gestured, and more men appeared with a medical kit. ""But I knew someone very much like you, once. Someone who also had to learn the hard way about trust and betrayal.""

The world was getting fuzzy around the edges. Blood dripped onto my ruined dress, each breath sending knives through my ribs.

""Who..."" I swayed, darkness creeping in. ""Who are you?""

She stepped forward, catching me as my knees buckled. This close, I could smell her perfume, something expensive, unique. Something that tickled at the edges of my memory.

""Someone who's been watching you for a very long time, Camille."" Her voice seemed to come from far away. ""Someone who's going to help you become everything they tried to prevent.""

The darkness was winning now. 

But before it took me completely, I heard her last words: ""After all... you look just like my daughter.”",1,1754147549.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1 CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW 001
Three years. One thousand and ninety-five days of trying to be the perfect wife, and this was my reward divorce papers on our anniversary.

""Sign here. And here."" Stefan's voice was distant, businesslike. 

He'd laid out the divorce papers like contracts at one of his meetings, sticky tabs marking each signature line. ""The highlighted sections need initials.""

My hands wouldn't stop shaking. ""You're doing this today? On our anniversary?""

I stared at Stefan's perfect signature on the last page, the ink still fresh. He must have signed them this morning, probably right after I'd left that st**id handmade card on his desk. 

The one I'd spent hours making, like a f**l who still believed in fairy tales. The anniversary card I made for my husband Stefan still sat on the kitchen counter, untouched. 

Three years of marriage summed up in a handmade gesture he couldn't even bother to open. I'd spent hours on it last night, writing words I thought mattered.

My coffee had gone cold. Funny how you notice small things when your world is falling apart.

""Camille."" He sighed, that familiar sound of disappointment I'd heard so many times before. ""There's no point dragging this out.""

The morning sun streamed through our kitchen windows, catching the diamond on my finger. Three carats, princess cut, picked out by his mother. 

""Not your style, dear, but it's what a Rodriguez wife should wear,"" she'd said at the time. Like everything else in my life, it had never really been mine.

""Is there someone else?""

The question hung in the air between us. Stefan straightened his tie, Italian silk, the blue one I'd given him for Christmas. ""Yes.""

One word. That's all it took to erase three years of trying to be perfect.

""How long?""

""Two months."" He wouldn't meet my eyes. ""She came back to town and...""

""Two months,"" I repeated. All those late nights at the office. The missed dinners. The way he'd stopped ki**ing me goodbye in the mornings.

""Were you ever going to tell me? Or just keep lying until the papers were ready?""

""I didn't want to hurt you.""

A laugh bubbled up, harsh, unfamiliar. ""That's thoughtful of you.""

My hand knocked against my coffee mug, sending it crashing to the floor. 

Dark liquid spread across the pristine tiles, staining the grout I'd scrubbed on hands and knees last week because his mother was coming to visit.

""Let me get that..."" Stefan reached for the paper towels.

""Don't."" My voice cracked. ""Just... don't pretend to care now.""

I bent to pick up the broken pieces. A photo slipped from between the divorce papers, landing face-up in the spilled coffee.

The world stopped.

I knew that smile. Those eyes. That perfectly poised expression that had haunted every family photo since I was twelve.

""Rose?"" My sister's name tasted like poison. ""Your first love was Rose?""

Stefan's silence said everything.

Memories hit like punches to the gut. Rose helping me pick out my wedding dress. Rose giving to**ts at our engagement party. 

Rose calling every week to check on my marriage, to give advice about keeping Stefan happy.

My adopted sister. My parents' golden child. The one they'd chosen to love.

""She never left town, did she?"" The pieces were falling into place. ""She's been here the whole time, waiting. Playing the supportive sister while you both laughed at st**id, naive Camille.""

""It wasn't like that."" Stefan ran his hands through his hair, that gesture I used to find endearing. ""We tried to fight it. But some people are just meant to...""

""If you say 'meant to be' I swear I'll throw this mug at your head."" My fingers tightened around the broken ceramic. ""How long were you together before? Before me?""

He shifted uncomfortably. ""Four years. Until she got the job offer in London.""

Four years. The same time I'd started dating Stefan. The same time Rose had suddenly become my biggest cheerleader, pushing me toward him.

""She set this up,"" I whispered. ""All of it. And I fell for every piece.""

""Camille, you're being dramatic. Rose cares about you.""

""Like she cared when she told my first boyfriend I was damaged goods? Or when she convinced my parents I was too unstable for college?"" The broken mug cut into my palm, but I barely felt it. 

""She's been sabotaging me my whole life, and I kept making excuses because that's what good sisters do, right?""

Bl**d dripped onto the divorce papers. Stefan reached for my hand but I jerked away.

""Don't touch me."" I grabbed a dish towel, wrapping it around my palm. ""Where is she now? Waiting to comfort me through my divorce? Planning your next wedding?""

""She wanted to be here, but I thought it would be better...""

""Better?"" I laughed again, the sound edged with hysteria. ""Yes, you've both been so concerned with what's better for me. Such caring people.""

I picked up the pen, the Mont Blanc he'd given me on our first anniversary. The one Rose had helped him choose.

""Camille, wait. We should talk about this properly.""

I signed every page, my signature perfectly steady. Let them see I wasn't breaking. Let them think they'd won.

""I'm done talking."" I gathered my purse, the signed papers, Rose's photo. ""Done pretending. Done being the good sister, the perfect wife, the daughter who never complains.""

""Where are you going?""

""Away from you. Away from her. Away from everyone who thinks Camille Lewis is someone they can use and discard.""

My phone buzzed, Rose's smiling face lit up the screen. Right on cue, coming to play her part.

I declined the call and walked to the door. Behind me, Stefan called out, ""You can't just leave. We need to discuss arrangements, the house, the accounts...""

""You can have it all."" I turned to face him one last time. ""The house, the cars, the life you built on lies. I don't want anything that reminds me of either of you.""

""Camille, please...""

""Goodbye, Stefan."" I smiled, and something in my expression made him step back. ""Give Rose my love. Tell her thank you, actually.""

""For what?""

""For finally showing me the truth. About her, about you, about who I need to become.""

I walked out of that house, out of that life, leaving bl**dy fingerprints on the door handle. Let them try to erase those as easily as they'd erased me.

Three years of pretending to be someone I wasn't. Three years of swallowing pain and making excuses for people who never deserved my loyalty.

My phone buzzed again. Rose. Then my mother. Then Stefan. One by one, I blocked them all.

Every connection to the life I thought I had to live.

In my rearview mirror, I caught a glimpse of my reflection. Tears streaked my makeup, bl**d stained my dress, my hair had come loose from its perfect twist.

I looked nothing like the polished, proper wife Stefan Rodriguez had married.


Chapter 2 CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW 002
The house was quiet, too quiet. I slipped in through the side door, locking it softly behind me. 

The air smelled like lemon polish and roses, just like it always did. It felt strange to be back, like stepping into someone else's life.

The kitchen was dark except for the faint glow of the fridge light. I crept up the stairs, careful to skip the third step that creaked. Every sound I made felt loud, like the house itself was listening.

When I reached my bedroom door, I stopped. It was open a crack, just like I'd left it all those years ago. Taking a deep breath, I stepped inside and shut the door.

My childhood bedroom hadn't changed in three years. Same pale pink walls, same white furniture, same collection of second-place trophies. Rose's first-place ones used to shine in the room next door.

I stared at my reflection in the vanity mirror, the same one where I'd practiced my wedding makeup three years ago, Rose standing behind me with that perfect smile. 

Now my mascara was smeared, hair wild, designer dress wrinkled. Mom would have a fit if she saw me like this.

The clock on my nightstand read 10:47 PM. I'd been sitting here for hours, packing what little of my old life I wanted to keep. Amazing how seventeen years in this house fit into one duffel bag.

My phone buzzed again, the twentieth time in an hour. This time it was Mom.

""Camille, this is ridiculous. Come home so we can discuss this like adults. Rose is worried sick...""

I hung up. Of course Rose was worried. Her carefully laid plans were unraveling.

The front door clicked open downstairs. I froze, listening to familiar footsteps on hardwood. The slight tap of heels, the whisper of expensive fabric.

""Camille?"" Mom's voice floated up the stairs. ""Darling, I know you're here. The housekeeper saw your car.""

I should have parked around the block. Should have been smarter, faster, better at disappearing. But I'd never been the clever one, had I? That was Rose's role.

More footsteps. A deeper voice, Dad, probably called home from work to deal with his hysterical younger daughter. Again.

""Princess?"" His voice carried that same gentle tone he'd used when I was twelve, crying about Rose getting my spot in the school play. ""Let's talk about this.""

A third set of footsteps made my bl**d freeze. Lighter, more graceful. Perfect, like everything else about her.

""Camille?"" Rose's voice dripped concern. ""Sweetie, please. Don't shut us out.""

I looked at the family photo on my dresser, taken the day Rose's adoption was finalized. 

Mom and Dad beaming, Rose radiant in her new dress, thirteen-year-old me trying to smile through braces and acne. One big happy family.

What a joke.

The memory hit me like a punch to the gut:

---

""But I've been practicing for months!"" I clutched my script, tears blurring the words. ""Mrs. Bennett said the lead was mine!""

Rose touched my shoulder, gentle as always. ""Oh, sweetie. I didn't mean to take your part. I just... the words came so naturally in the audition. Mrs. Bennett said I had a gift.""

Of course she did. Everyone said Rose had a gift. For music, for acting, for making people love her.

""Maybe..."" Rose's eyes lit up with that special gleam that always meant trouble. ""Maybe you could help me practice? Be my supporting actress? We could make it our sister thing!

I'd agreed. Because that's what good sisters did. Because saying no to Rose meant disappointed looks from Mom, lectures from Dad about family loyalty.

Opening night, I watched from the wings as Rose brought the audience to tears. Afterward, Mom bought her roses. Dad took us all to dinner.

No one mentioned that I'd written Rose's best lines during our ""practice sessions."" Or that her dramatic monologue had been word-for-word what I'd performed in my original audition.

Rose just had a gift for memorization, that's all.

---

""Camille Elizabeth Lewis!"" Mom's voice sharpened. ""This behavior is completely unacceptable.""

I opened my bedroom door.

They stood in the hallway like a perfect family portrait, Mom in her designer suit, Dad looking distinguished in his work clothes, Rose wearing concern like the latest fashion trend.

""Hello, sister."" My voice came out steady. ""Shouldn't you be comforting your fiancé?""

Rose's eyes widened. Always the performer. ""Camille, please. Let me explain...""

""Explain what? How you've been sl**ping with my husband? Or how you set this whole thing up from the beginning?""

""What is she talking about?"" Dad turned to Rose, who already had tears forming. Perfect, delicate tears that never smeared her makeup.

""She's upset,"" Rose whispered. ""Lashing out. You know how she gets, Daddy.""

""Don't."" My laugh sounded strange, even to me. 

""Don't you dare play that card again. Show them the ring, Rose. The one Stefan gave you two months ago while I was supposedly too sick to attend the charity gala.""

Mom gasped. Dad's face darkened. But Rose, Rose's mask slipped for just a second. I saw it this time, that flash of cold calculation behind the concern.

""It wasn't like that,"" she started.

""Really? Then how was it? Explain to everyone how you've been calling me every week, giving me marriage advice while sl**ping with my husband. Tell them about all the times you helped me pick out li**erie for anniversaries when Stefan was really working late with you.""

""That's enough!"" Mom stepped forward. ""Rose would never...""

""Never what, Mom? Never lie? Never manipulate? Never steal something that belonged to her sister?"" I pulled out my phone, playing the last voicemail from Stefan.

His voice filled the hallway: ""Rose is my soulmate, Camille. We tried to fight it, but some people are just meant to be together. You have to understand...""

The silence that followed was deafening.

Rose recovered first. ""I never meant to hurt you. We can't help who we love...""

The sound of my palm connecting with her cheek echoed like a g**shot.

""Camille!"" Mom grabbed my arm. ""Have you lost your mind?""

""No,"" I said quietly, watching a red mark bloom on Rose's perfect face. ""For the first time in fourteen years, I'm seeing clearly.""

I walked past them, duffel bag in hand. Behind me, Rose's sobs started, the same performance she'd perfected over years of turning everyone against me.

""Where are you going?"" Dad called after me. ""You can't just walk away from family!""

I paused at the top of the stairs, looking back at my so-called family. Mom comforting Rose, Dad looking torn, and my sister watching me through her tears with eyes that held no warmth at all.

""Family?"" I smiled, and something in my expression made them all step back. ""No, this isn't family. This is a game. And for fourteen years, I've been playing by Rose's rules.""

""Camille, please,"" Rose reached for me, ever the caring sister. ""Let me make this right.""

I caught her wrist before she could touch me. ""You taught me well, big sister. About manipulation. About patience. About waiting for the perfect moment to strike.""

Her eyes widened, real fear this time, not performed.

""Thank you for the lessons,"" I whispered, letting her go. ""Now watch how well I learned them.""

I walked down the stairs, ignoring their calls. In the foyer mirror, I caught one last glimpse of myself, mascara-stained, wild-eyed, finally unchained.


Chapter 3 ROSE'S POINT OF VIEW 003
I swirled the ch**pagne in my crystal flute, watching the bubbles dance. Victory tasted sweet, just like I'd imagined all these years.

The living room of my penthouse apartment overlooked the city where I'd spent twenty years pretending to be the perfect adopted daughter, the loving sister, the supportive friend.

What a joke.

""To freedom,"" I whispered to my reflection in the window. The woman staring back at me smiled, perfect teeth, perfect hair, perfect lies. Just like always.

My phone buzzed again. Another missed call from Stefan. He'd been calling non-stop since Camille walked out, probably worried I'd change my mind now that everything was in the open. 

Poor, predictable Stefan. Still thinking he was in control of any of this.

I kicked off my Louboutins and sank into the leather couch, letting memories wash over me like warm w**e.

---

The first time I saw Camille Lewis, I hated her.

I was thirteen, fresh out of foster care, desperate to please my new parents. 

They'd brought me to this massive house with its manicured lawn and marble floors, promising me a fresh start. A real family.

Then this skinny thing with braces and messy hair came bouncing down the stairs, all eager smiles and innocent eyes.

""Hi! I'm Camille. I've always wanted a sister!""

She hugged me right there in the foyer, not caring that my clothes were secondhand or that I smelled like the group home's industrial detergent. Just pure, genuine joy at having a sister.

I wanted to vomit.

Because there she was, this awkward, imperfect girl who had everything I'd spent thirteen years dreaming about. 

Parents who actually wanted her. A home she belonged in. A future secured by the Lewis family name.

And she didn't even appreciate it properly.

I watched her over dinner that first night, watched how she slouched in her chair and talked with her mouth full. How she didn't know which fork to use for salad.

How she laughed too loud and asked too many questions.

""Rose has such lovely manners,"" Mrs. Lewis... Mom... had said, smiling at me. ""Perhaps you could learn from your new sister, Camille.""

That's when I saw it. The first crack in Camille's perfect world. The slight dimming of her smile, the way she sat up straighter, tried harder.

It was beautiful.

---

My phone buzzed again, pulling me back to the present. Stefan's face lit up my screen, his fifth call in an hour. With a sigh, I answered.

""Darling, you're being needy.""

""Rose."" His voice was rough. Had he been drinking? ""She's gone. Really gone. Blocked my number, cleaned out her closet...""

""Isn't that what we wanted?"" I kept my voice gentle, soothing. The same tone I'd used all those times I'd counseled Camille through her marital problems. Problems I'd carefully orchestrated.""

""I just... the way she looked at me...""

""Stefan, sweetheart."" I let steel edge into my sweetness. ""Are you having second thoughts? After everything we've been through?""

""No! No, of course not. I love you. I've always loved you.""

""Then stop calling me about your ex-wife. It's pathetic.""

I hung up, tossing the phone aside. Men were so predictably weak.

Even Stefan, who I'd spent four years grooming before pushing him toward Camille, still needed constant management.

But he'd served his purpose. Just like everyone else in my carefully constructed game.

The family photo on my mantel caught my eye, my adoption day. I stood in the center, of course. Always the center. 

Camille pushed to the edge of the frame, trying so hard to smile through her insecurities.

God, it had been easy. Almost too easy.

A little whisper here about how Camille was unstable. A few concerned conversations with Mom about how worried I was about my dear sister's emotional state. 

Casual mentions to Dad about how Camille seemed to be struggling with basic adult responsibilities.

Fourteen years of careful groundwork, positioning myself as the responsible daughter, the achievable dream, while slowly crushing Camille's confidence, her relationships, her sense of self.

The college rejection was particularly inspired, if I do say so myself. All it took was one tearful conversation with Mom about finding Camille's ""secret"" diary, filled with dark thoughts and destructive plans. 

Plans I'd written myself, of course, in Camille's childish handwriting that I'd spent months practicing to forge.

Suddenly, their precious younger daughter wasn't ready for college. Needed time to ""find herself."" Needed to stay close to home where they could watch her.

Where I could watch her.

I took another sip of ch**pagne, savoring the moment. Because this, this was what I'd really wanted all along. 

Not Stefan, he was just a useful pawn. Not the Lewis fortune, though that would come in time.

No, what I wanted was to watch perfect, precious Camille finally break. To see her realize that everything she thought she had family, love, security, had been built on my lies.

My phone buzzed with a text from Mom: ""Rose, darling, please come over. Your father and I need to talk about what happened.""

I smiled, already planning my performance. The tearful confusion, the reluctant confession about Stefan's pursuit, the gentle concern about Camille's mental state.

By the time I was done, they'd be thanking me for protecting them from their unstable daughter all these years.

Standing up, I walked to my closet, selecting the perfect outfit for my next scene. Something subtle but expensive. Grieving sister, not celebrating victor.

The massive walk-in closet had been Camille's wedding gift to me. ""So you'll always have space for your amazing fashion sense,"" she'd said, hugging me tight.

Even then, even after years of watching me steal every spotlight, every opportunity, every scrap of parental approval, she'd still loved me. Still trusted me.

Id**t.

I pulled out a cream cashmere sweater, remembering how Camille used to borrow my clothes in high school. 

How I'd wait until she had something important, a date, a presentation, an interview, then suddenly remember I needed that exact outfit.

She'd always given them back without argument. Always apologized for the inconvenience.

Always tried so hard to be the perfect sister.

My reflection caught my eye, and for a moment, just a moment, I saw something ugly there. 

Something that looked like the scared, angry foster kid who'd walked into the Lewis house all those years ago.

But then I blinked, and I was perfect Rose again. Flawless Rose. Rose who could do no wrong.

Slipping on my Cartier bracelet, another gift from my dear sister, I prepared for my next performance. 

The concerned family meeting would need just the right touch of reluctant honesty, devastated betrayal.

""Oh, Camille,"" I whispered to my reflection, practicing my worried frown. ""What have you done to yourself?""

But as I turned to leave, something made me pause. That look in Camille's eyes before she'd walked out, I'd never seen it before. 

Not in twenty years of pushing her, testing her, breaking her.

It had looked almost like... understanding.

Like she'd finally seen through my mask to the truth underneath.

I shook off the uneasy feeling. Camille was weak, just like I'd made her. She'd run away, lick her wounds, maybe try to start over somewhere new.

But she'd never be free of me. I'd made sure of that years ago.


Chapter 4 STEFAN'S POINT OF VIEW 004
The sc**ch burned going down, but I poured another anyway. 

My third? Fourth? I'd lost count somewhere between signing those divorce papers and watching Camille walk away.

Our wedding photo still sat on my desk, mocking me. Camille's genuine smile, my distracted eyes,  already looking past her, always looking for Rose.

Rose.

Even her name felt like betrayal now.

My phone lit up with another message from her: ""Darling, stop drinking and come over. We should celebrate.""

Celebrate. Like we hadn't just destroyed someone who loved us. Someone who'd given me three years of devotion I never deserved.

The memory hit me like a punch to the gut.

---

""Stefan?"" Camille's voice was small, uncertain. ""Did I do something wrong?""

I looked up from my laptop, irritated at the interruption. She stood in the doorway of my home office, holding a plate of something that smelled amazing.

""I made that pasta you mentioned. The one with truffles?"" Her eyes were hopeful. ""Rose gave me the recipe...""

Of course she had. Rose had made that pasta for me in Rome, years ago. Back when we were... whatever we were.

""I'm busy."" I didn't even look at the plate. ""Just leave it.""

""Oh."" A pause. ""It's just, you've been working late all week, and I thought...""

""Camille."" My voice sharp with an anger that wasn't really meant for her. ""I said I'm busy.""

She left the plate and disappeared, quiet as always. The pasta sat untouched until morning, a perfect recreation of a memory that belonged to another woman.

---

I hurled my glass at the wall, watching crystal shatter like the life I'd built on lies.

God, I'd been cruel. Not just at the end, but throughout our marriage.

Every missed dinner, every forgotten anniversary, every time I'd chosen work over her, all excuses to avoid the guilt of wanting her sister.

My phone buzzed again. Mother this time.

""Darling, I just heard from Rose. Are you alright? Do you need anything? I always said Camille wasn't suited for our family...""

I silenced the phone, remembering another moment I'd tried to forget.

---

""She's trying so hard, Stefan."" Rose's voice was gentle as she poured me another dr**k. We were alone in my office after another disastrous family dinner. ""Maybe if you gave her more guidance...""

""Like you did?"" I couldn't keep the bitterness from my voice. ""Teaching her all the ways to be perfect?""

Rose's laugh was musical, practiced. Everything about her was practiced. ""Are you saying you preferred me imperfect?""

The air between us crackled with unspoken history. Four years of pa**ion and plans, ended by her sudden departure to London. Or so she'd claimed.

""Why did you really leave?"" The question slipped out, colored by wh**key and old pain.

""You know why."" She touched my cheek, familiar and forbidden. ""Camille needed a chance at happiness. We both agreed...""

Had we? I couldn't remember anymore. Everything from that time felt hazy, manipulated. Like watching a play where I'd forgotten my lines.

""She loves you,"" Rose whispered, too close now. ""More than I ever could.""

But her eyes said something different. They always had.

---

Another memory surfaced, this one from last week. The moment everything changed.

---

""I made your favorite breakfast."" Camille's smile was bright, genuine. Always so d**n genuine. ""Happy anniversary.""

The divorce papers burned in my briefcase, Rose's perfume still lingering on my clothes from our late-night ""meeting.""

""I can't."" I grabbed my keys, avoiding her eyes. ""Early meeting.""

""Oh."" Her voice cracked slightly. ""Will you be home for dinner? I thought we could...""

""Don't wait up.""

I'd spent that evening with Rose, planning how to break the news. She'd worn the same perfume she'd worn in Rome, all those years ago.

""It's kinder this way,"" she'd said, str**ing my hair. ""A clean break. Camille will understand eventually.""

Would she? The look in her eyes when she'd seen Rose's photo...

---

My office door opened, startling me from the memory. Mother stood there, perfectly coiffed even at midnight.

""Really, darling. Dr**king alone in the dark?""

""Not now, Mother.""

She clicked across the room, surveying the broken glass with disapproval. ""Rose is worried about you. We all are.""

""Worried?"" I laughed, harsh and broken. ""Like you were worried about Camille all these years?""

""That girl was never right for you."" Mother's voice hardened. ""Rose, on the other hand...""

""Stop."" I stood, unsteady. ""Just... stop.""

""Stefan Rodriguez, you will not speak to me that way. I raised you better...""

""Did you?"" The words exploded out of me. ""You raised me to what? String along a woman who loved me while pining for her sister? Listen to you tear her down at every opportunity?""

Mother stepped back, shocked. In twenty eight years, I'd never raised my voice to her.

""Everything she did was wrong, wasn't it?"" I continued, the scotch making me brave. ""Her clothes, her manners, her cooking. Nothing was ever good enough. But Rose... Rose was perfect.""

""Because she understands our world! She...""

""She understands manipulation."" The truth hit me like a freight train. ""She played us all. You, me, Camille...""

""Don't be ridiculous."" Mother straightened her designer jacket. ""Rose loves you. She always has.""

Had she? Or had she loved the game more?

I remembered the cold calculation in her eyes when she'd orchestrated our ""chance"" meetings after returning from London. 

The way she'd encouraged Camille's insecurities while playing the supportive sister.

Even our reunion two months ago felt staged now. The charity gala, Camille conveniently ""sick,"" Rose in that dress I'd loved in Rome...

""Mother."" I sank back into my chair, suddenly exhausted. ""Please leave.""

""Stefan...""

""Go. Tell Rose... tell her..."" What? That I was sorry? That I finally saw through her perfect mask? That I'd destroyed my marriage for a fantasy she'd carefully crafted?

Mother left, her disappointment hanging in the air like expensive perfume. Like Rose's perfume. Like all the artificial, manipulated pieces of this life I'd chosen.

My phone lit up with another message. Rose again: ""Darling, stop being dramatic. Come home. To me.""

Home.

I looked around my office, at the shattered glass and scattered papers. At Camille's wedding photo, her genuine smile now seeming like an accusation.

What had I done?


Chapter 5 CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW 005
The parking garage of the hotel where i lodged was too quiet. My heels echoed against concrete, each click bouncing off empty cars and shadowed pillars.

It was late, past midnight, but something felt wrong. Off.

My confrontation with Rose and my family had left me drained, empty except for the cold satisfaction of finally seeing behind her mask. 

I fumbled with my key fob, wanting nothing more than to get to my hotel room and plan my next move.

A car door slammed somewhere in the darkness.

I stopped, listening. Nothing but the hum of fluorescent lights and the distant sound of traffic.

My phone buzzed in my purse. Rose's number. I declined it, but not before noticing my signal had dropped to one bar.

Perfect.

Footsteps behind me. Multiple sets.

I walked faster, cu**ing my choice of heels. The hotel's elevator was just around the corner, past a row of concrete pillars. If I could just...

""Going somewhere, Mrs. Rodriguez?""

A man stepped out from behind a pillar. Tall, broad-shouldered, dressed in black. Professional. Two more appeared behind me, cutting off my retreat.

Not a random attack, then.

""Actually, it's Ms. Lewis now."" My voice stayed steady despite my racing heart. ""And I have a dinner reservation, so if you'll excuse me...""

The first man smiled. It wasn't a nice smile. ""I'm afraid your plans have changed.""

I gripped my purse tighter, feeling for the pepper spray I'd started carrying after signing the divorce papers. ""Did my sister send you? Or was it Stefan?""

""Our employer prefers to remain anonymous."" He stepped closer. ""Now, we can do this the easy way...""

I didn't let him finish. The pepper spray caught him directly in the eyes.

He screamed, stumbling backward. I ran, kicking off my heels as I sprinted for the elevator. The other two men shouted, their footsteps thundering behind me.

Almost there. Just a few more...

Pain exploded in my scalp as someone grabbed my hair, yanking me backward. My purse went flying, contents scattering across the concrete.

""That wasn't very nice."" The first man's voice was rough with pain and rage. ""Hold her.""

Strong hands gripped my arms. I fought, kicking, scratching, but they were too strong. Professional. Trained.

""Our employer said you might be difficult."" The first man wiped his streaming eyes. ""Said you needed to learn your place.""

Rose. This had Rose written all over it. Her parting shot, making sure I understood just how powerless I really was.

""If you're going to k**l me,"" I spat, ""at least have the guts to look me in the eyes.""

He laughed. ""K**l you? No, no. Just a message. A reminder of what happens to people who don't know when to let go.""

The first punch caught me in the stomach, driving the air from my lungs. I doubled over, gasping, but the men holding me kept me upright.

""See, some people don't understand their role in life."" Another blow, this one to my ribs. ""Some people need to be taught...""

I tasted bl**d. My vision blurred, pain shooting through my body. But I wouldn't cry. Wouldn't give Rose the satisfaction.

""That's enough.""

The voice cut through the garage like a whip crack. Female. Authoritative.

My attackers tensed. Through swollen eyes, I saw dark figures emerging from the shadows. Men in suits, moving with military precision. And behind them...

A woman. Tall, elegant, probably in her fifties but with an ageless quality about her. 

She wore a black designer suit that probably cost more than my car, her silver hair swept into a perfect chignon.

But it was her eyes that caught me. Sharp, intelligent, and oddly... familiar.

""Ma'am,"" one of my attackers started, ""our employer...""

""Is about to have a very bad day."" The woman's voice was ice. ""Release her. Now.""

The hands holding me disappeared. I slumped forward, pain shooting through my ribs.

""Secure them."" The woman's command sent her men moving. My attackers didn't even try to run. They knew better.

She walked toward me, heels clicking on concrete. Designer shoes. Probably cost more than my monthly rent.

""Camille Lewis."" Not a question. She knew exactly who I was.

I tried to straighten, to maintain some dignity despite my split lip and torn dress. ""Do I know you?""

Her eyes softened, just slightly. Like she was seeing something, someone else in my face.

""No."" She gestured, and more men appeared with a medical kit. ""But I knew someone very much like you, once. Someone who also had to learn the hard way about trust and betrayal.""

The world was getting fuzzy around the edges. Blood dripped onto my ruined dress, each breath sending knives through my ribs.

""Who..."" I swayed, darkness creeping in. ""Who are you?""

She stepped forward, catching me as my knees buckled. This close, I could smell her perfume, something expensive, unique. Something that tickled at the edges of my memory.

""Someone who's been watching you for a very long time, Camille."" Her voice seemed to come from far away. ""Someone who's going to help you become everything they tried to prevent.""

The darkness was winning now. 

But before it took me completely, I heard her last words: ""After all... you look just like my daughter.”",1,1754147501.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Budgeting apps felt like a part time job and spreadsheets just gave me a headache. I felt stuck until I started treating a large language model like a personal finance coach.

My main problem was I never knew where to start. I tried tracking every single penny, but I'd forget a coffee here or there and the whole thing would fall apart. I realized I didnt need a complex system, I just needed a simple, actionable plan based on my actual spending habits, not some ideal version of myself.

This is the prompt that finally clicked for me.

```
Act as a frugal, no-nonsense financial coach. My goal is to save [dollar amount] per month.

Here is my financial data:
- Monthly Income (after tax): [your income]
- Fixed Expenses (rent, utilities, etc.): [list expenses and costs]
- Variable Expenses (groceries, gas, takeout, etc.): [list recent spending estimates]

Based on this, create a simple, step-by-step weekly plan to help me reach my savings goal. Focus on the 2-3 biggest ""money leaks"" and suggest realistic, small changes. Give me a weekly savings target.
```

This works because it asks for **actionable steps**, not just generic advice. It forces the AI to prioritize instead of overwhelming you. The first time I ran this, it immediately flagged my takeout habit and subscriptions I forgot I had. It suggested a plan that saved me over $300 just from those two categories.

Of course, this is not a replacement for a certified financial advisor and you have to be honest with the numbers you provide. It's a tool for awareness and getting a starting plan, not for complex investment advice.

If you try this prompt, I would genuinely love to hear your results. Did it work similarly for you or did you discover something interesting about your own spending?

1mfstmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouverhousing/comments/1mfstmc/i_finally_left_dv_and_now_im_facing_being/,I finally left D.V and now i'm facing being homeless as a middle-income earner,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I just need someone to hear me.

I’m a mom of two incredible kids (13 and 11), aged 41, a community leader, and a survivor. I’ve worked my ass off to build a stable life after fleeing years of domestic violence and I’m still staring down the possibility of homelessness.

Let me back up.

I moved to BC from Toronto  with my son and husband. Shortly after, I found out he was cheating, with underage prostitutes (backpages). I was young, religious, and raised to believe in forgiveness. I tried to make it work, despite what I now know were red flags (MORE than red flags, im just an idoit)

For years, I stayed home because *he wanted that*. Then the narrative changed: I wasn’t contributing. So I got to work. I’m educated, and during COVID I landed a great role. I’ve been climbing the ladder ever since. Today, I earn about $85K a year (not the best but good after 6 years away from work) double what I made just a few years ago—but I’m still on contract and have to constantly fight for renewals to keep food on the table.

Behind the scenes, things were brutal. Over the last 10 years, I’ve been choked four times. Once I genuinely thought I was going to die. He’s smashed my face into the steering wheel while driving. Broken down the front door. Gone missing for days. Stolen work laptops and phones so I couldn’t earn a living. I hid what I could, but he cut my headphones, searched everything. I had no privacy. No peace. But I just kept working away - redoing furniture on the side, selling and reselling baby items facebook market place (only things he didnt know the value of)

Four months ago, I finally got out. I left with my kids and the clothes on our backs. I’m now staying on a friend’s couch. Still paying rent at the old place because my name’s on the lease. We had a condo we sold last year because he got us into debt so no more assets. The police have been involved. I have a secure portal to upload photos, voice recordings, and videos documenting the abuse. Calling the police never really happened before because I was embarrassed. How could something like this happen to ME? What a wake up call and i've learned so much over the past three years that amaze me. So many woman are stuck like me and Ive made a promise to start something up for local Vancouver woman after I get through this storm.

It’s the first time I’ve felt like I might actually make it.  
But I can’t find a place to live.

I’ve applied to every co-op in Kits and surrounding areas. Religiously. For years. Every 6 months, like clockwork. I have a spreadsheet of all the places and my morning coffee routine is scouring for a 2 bedroom around me for the past few years. I have a great credit score. Professional references. Past landlord references. A stable income. But nothing.

Why Kits? Because I don’t drive. My kids go to school here. I work here. This is our home. The school has been a lifeline and I don’t want to uproot my kids again. They've been through enough. I also don't think he would allow that. It doesn't need to be kits proper but somewhere I could possible bike them to school or they could bus (school is Henry Hudson)

I make just enough money to disqualify me from most housing support, but not enough to actually afford market rent. BC Housing has been... impossible. I was told that unless there's a *new* violent incident and I go to the police again, they can’t escalate my case. I have records. I have evidence. But they said I need a “fresh” report for their emergency housing list. One person even told me to “go back when he hurts you again and ask for a form.” What the actual hell?

I wish I had a police officer friend to just sign the damn form and that might be my lifeline.

I’ve fallen through every crack.

I’m a vice president on my local Business Improvement Association. I’m active in my church (don’t come at me). I’ve worked every odd job under the sun on the side to hide money, flipping furniture, cleaning, consulting, just to keep going. I have done everything “right.""

Now the property we fled,  is being sold. The third time in 8 years. I *want* to walk away, but I literally have nowhere to go. I’ve considered living in a tent. That’s how bleak this is.

I don’t want money. I want a solution. I want a place to live where I can keep my kids in their school and feel safe. That’s it. I want to know if others are in my situation.

If anyone knows of any units in Kits, Fairview, Yaletown, Arbutus Ridge or nearby....co-op, long-term rentals ....I am begging. I can provide everything.

If you’ve been through this, how did you make it work?

I know I can’t be the only one slipping through the cracks.  I know I can't be the only woman living like in lower-mainland.",0,1754147247.0,vancouverhousing,7,0.36,False

As we were walking to the studio we were chatting and it was hot out so i opened my umbrella for the both of us, at this point my palms were sweaty and my heart was beating out of my chest. At the studio we sat next to each other and watched Instagram together cause her phone died, i again was about to die because of her.

My ferritin was a 8 and my transferrin saturation was only 9%, so my primary care doc prescribed ferrous sulfate (65 mg Fe) with vitamin C every other day. The rest of my iron binding test results were well within normal, save my serum iron which was at 39 ug/dL (still within normal, but close to the bottom of normal).

I would give myself a B+ on following through with the supplements. I haven't missed a dose and always take it at least 2 hours after and 1 hour before eating/coffee. I know it's best to take it first thing in the morning, and if I naturally wake up hella early, I'll take it the and go back to sleep. If I don't, I'll wait 2 hours after breakfast/coffee (because if I don't eat first thing I feel awful). Fortunately, save some very minor occasional heartburn I've been tolerating the supplements well. 

I had my levels checked again yesterday, with the following results:

* 🎉 Serum iron and transferrin saturation are both WAY up (139 ug/dL and 34% respectively) 
* 😒 Ferritin and MCHC dipped a little to 7ng/mL and 31.5 g/dL (not really meaningfully different from 8 and 32.1 though) 
* Everything else is stable well within the normal range

I'm traveling in Europe for the next few weeks so won't be able to do any follow-up appointments until I'm back in late August.

1mfsrhv,https://youtube.com/watch?v=e3KAbEWHLjE&si=3l2ay1lE5R3wcfRG,"10Hypnosis, Drugs, and Altered States of Consciousness","Detailed Briefing Document: The Science of Learning and Conditioning

This briefing document summarizes key concepts from Dr. Sudheendra S.G.'s research on behavioral genetics, focusing on the principles of learning, particularly classical and operant conditioning, and their profound impact on human and animal behavior.

I. Foundations of Behaviorism and Learning

Dr. Sudheendra S.G. places significant emphasis on Ivan Pavlov, acknowledging his foundational contributions to the ""behaviorist school of thought."" This perspective views psychology as an ""empirically rigorous science, focused on observable behaviors and not unobservable internal mental processes."" While modern psychology encompasses both behavior and mental processes, Pavlov's work established a path for ""more experimental rigor and behavioral research.""

**Key Idea:** Learning is defined as ""the process of acquiring, through experience, new and relatively enduring information or behaviors."" It is crucial for adaptation and survival, occurring through ""association, observation, or just plain thinking.""

II. Classical Conditioning: Associating Stimuli

**A. Pavlov's Experiments and Core Concepts:** Dr. Sudheendra highlights Pavlov's famous experiments with dogs. Pavlov, originally a physiologist studying the digestive system, observed dogs salivating at the mere whiff of food. He realized this wasn't just an annoyance but a ""simple but important form of learning.""

* **The Experiment:** Pavlov paired the ""unconditioned stimulus"" (UCS) of meat powder, which naturally caused ""unconditioned response"" (UCR) of drooling, with ""neutral stimuli"" (NS) like a sound or light.
* **Acquisition:** After repeated pairings, the neutral stimulus became a ""conditioned stimulus"" (CS), eliciting a ""conditioned response"" (CR) of drooling even without the meat powder.
* **Associative Learning:** This process, termed ""classical conditioning,"" demonstrates ""associative learning,"" where a subject ""links certain events, behaviors, or stimuli together.""
* **Methodological Significance:** Classical conditioning proved that learning could be ""studied through direct observation of behavior in real-time, without all those messy feelings and emotions,"" a principle appreciated by behaviorists who disdained ""mentalistic concepts"" like consciousness.

**B. Applications and Implications of Classical Conditioning:**

Dr. Sudheendra, along with figures like B.F. Skinner and John B. Watson, embraced the idea that psychology should focus on ""objective, observable behavior.""

* **""Chota Chetan"" Experiment:** Dr. Sudheendra recounts an experiment where he ""trained kids to be terrified of furry animals."" He accomplished this by pairing a white ball (NS) with a loud, scary noise (UCS), leading the child ""chota chetan"" to scream in fear at the sight of the ball (CS). This fear then ""generalized to include other furry white objects, like bunnies, dogs, and even fur coats.""
* **Societal Conditioning:** Dr. Sudheendra postulates that deeply ingrained societal behaviors, such as people ""ready to die for their religion ready to die for their nation, or even ready to immolate themselves when their favourite hero dies,"" are ""nothing but conditional training they have been adopted due to circumstances."" He cites the self-immolations after Dr. M.G. Ramachandran's death as an example, suggesting they were ""conditionally trained to fear surviving in this world, without their hero.""
* **Undoing Conditioning:** Dr. Sudheendra acknowledges that ""new conditioning could be used to undo old conditioning,"" referencing a film example where fear of a lift is overcome by repeated safe exposure. However, he warns that such experiments can be ""hazardous,"" citing the tragic case of ""Little Albert"" who ""even died to frequent conditioning.""
* **Advertising:** A practical application of classical conditioning is seen in advertising. Dr. Sudheendra provides the example of Bisleri bottled water, where the concept that ""health comes from clean water"" was ""classically conditioned Indian minds"" to associate bottled water with health, leading to the sale of ""freely available abundant water resource... in packed bottles.""

III. Operant Conditioning: Linking Behavior with Consequences

**A. Basic Principles:** Dr. Sudheendra introduces ""operant conditioning"" as another type of associative learning. Unlike classical conditioning, which links stimuli, operant conditioning ""involves associating our own behaviour with consequences.""

* **Reinforcement vs. Punishment:**
* **Reinforcement:** Increases a behavior.
* **Positive Reinforcement:** ""Strengthens responses by giving rewards after a desired event,"" such as giving a dog a cookie for shaking hands.
* **Negative Reinforcement:** ""Increases a behavior by taking away an aversive or upsetting stimulus."" The example provided is a car beeping until the seatbelt is fastened, removing the annoying beep reinforces seatbelt use. Crucially, Dr. Sudheendra emphasizes, ""negative reinforcement is not the same as punishment.""
* **Punishment:** Decreases a behavior. This can be ""positively, by, say, getting a speeding ticket, or negatively, by taking away a driver's license.""
* **Examples:**
* **Dog Training:** Dr. Sudheendra conditioned his dog to shake hands for a cookie (positive reinforcement) and stopped it from attacking vehicles by showing a stick (punishment).
* **Rat Experiment:** Rats observed another rat getting trapped for a cookie refused to enter the trap for the same cookie, demonstrating avoidance learning through observation of consequences.
* **Terror Attacks:** Dr. Sudheendra chillingly notes that suicide bombers are ""trained in a conditional training and are made to believe that by doing so they will be entering a heaven with many beautiful girls and all their desires will be fulfilled,"" illustrating how powerful, albeit harmful, operant conditioning can be.

**B. Reinforcers and Schedules:**

* **Primary Reinforcers:** ""Make innate biological sense"" and do not need to be learned (e.g., cookies are delicious, beeping is annoying).
* **Conditioned Reinforcers:** Recognized only after being ""associate\[d\] them with primary reinforcers,"" such as a paycheck, which is desired because it provides access to primary needs like ""food and shelter."" Dr. Sudheendra describes this as being ""enslaved by a company with the offer of paycheck.""
* **Reinforcement Schedules:Continuous Reinforcement:** Giving a reward for every desired behavior (e.g., a chocolate for every sum completed). While initially motivating, ""once we stop giving this... the child also stops finishing sum.""
* **Intermittent Reinforcement:** Rewards are given occasionally. ""Learning under these conditions takes longer, but it holds up better in the long run, and is less susceptible to that extinction."" Examples include a free coffee every 10 bought, a free double shot every Tuesday, or a random coffee lottery. These ""get customers coming back for more.""

IV. The Role of Environment and Cognitive Processes

Dr. Sudheendra acknowledges the controversial nature of strict behaviorism, noting that ""plenty of folks disagreed with their insistence that only external influences and not internal thoughts and feelings shaped behavior."" He then introduces the importance of ""cognitive processes – our thoughts, perceptions, feelings, memories – also influence the way we learn."" Children, for instance, ""learn by seeing what is happening around them.""

**Overarching Theme:** Dr. Sudheendra's research on ""Behavioural Genetics clearly states that the behaviour of humans are largely influenced by how they are conditionally, operantly or even how they are trained by the environments they live in."" He hints at future discussions on how ""we can train our society to be like as we want it by creating situations and environments.""

The first thing I noticed when unboxing it was the sleek stainless steel and black design. Unlike other machines I’ve used that feel plasticky or flimsy, this one carries a sturdy, premium vibe. It’s not just about looks, either — the build feels solid, and the thermal carafe had me curious and excited to test how well it would keep my coffee hot. Spoiler alert: I wasn’t disappointed.

**Performance and Brewing Experience**  
I’ve been using the Zojirushi EC-YTC100XB for a few weeks now, and the coffee quality has been consistent every single time. The brewing process operates at an optimal 200°F (as per the specs), which apparently is the magic number for great-tasting coffee. I can vouch for that because the flavors come through beautifully — there’s no bitterness, just smooth and full-bodied richness. The most impressive feature is its ability to brew both hot coffee and iced coffee effortlessly. It adjusts the water-to-coffee ratio for iced coffee, ensuring it doesn’t feel watered down when mixed with ice. For a summer iced-coffee enthusiast like me, this is a game-changer.

**Ease of Use and Convenience**  
As someone who occasionally stumbles into the kitchen pre-coffee, anything overly complicated is a dealbreaker for me. Thankfully, this coffee maker scores high on user-friendliness. The removable water tank has been a huge plus. I hate those moments where you have to awkwardly angle a carafe to fill the tank. Here, I just detach it, fill it directly from the faucet, and snap it back into place. Even cleaning the tank is a breeze since it’s fully washable. Additionally, the stainless mesh coffee filter is reusable, meaning I’ve stopped buying paper filters altogether, which is both eco-friendly and wallet-friendly. The programmable feature lets me schedule coffee brewing, and waking up to the smell of freshly brewed coffee has honestly been my favorite part of the day since I got it.  

**Favorable Attributes**  
- The thermal carafe keeps coffee piping hot for hours without burning the flavor.  
- It comes with a reusable mesh filter, saving costs on disposable filters.  
- The removable water tank makes refilling and cleaning so much easier.  
- It offers a time-saving mode for quicker brews when I’m in a rush.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
No product is perfect, and this coffee maker is no exception. While it excels in many areas, there are a couple of things I wish could be better:  
- The water level indicator isn’t backlit, which makes it hard to see in dim lighting.  
- It’s a bit taller than expected, and fitting it under some cabinets can pose a challenge.  
- If you don’t immediately rinse the mesh filter post-use, coffee grounds cling annoyingly, making cleanup slightly tedious.  

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing the Zojirushi coffee maker to some of its competitors like the Technivorm Moccamaster or the Cuisinart DCC-3200 was an eye-opener. The Moccamaster excels with its longevity and craftsmanship but comes with a hefty price tag that might deter casual coffee drinkers. On the other hand, the Cuisinart features a 14-cup capacity but doesn’t specialize in maintaining coffee heat as effectively as this vacuum-insulated carafe. If you’re a fan of iced coffee or want something that doesn’t scorch your brew after a long morning, Zojirushi’s temperature-focused brewing takes the win for me. However, the Moccamaster had slightly faster brewing times and less overall maintenance. The choice largely depends on what your coffee priorities are — iced options with superior heat retention or faster brewing at a premium.  

**Worth Every Penny**  
Looking at its feature set, the coffee quality it produces, and the convenience factor, I’d absolutely say this coffee maker justifies its price. It stands as a well-rounded machine, offering more advanced features like unique iced coffee brewing and thermal temperature preservation compared to others at this price level. I appreciate that I’m not buying disposable filters anymore, and the programmable brewing functionality means I can streamline my mornings. While some machines at a lower price point might brew more cups in one go, they frequently fall short on durability or retaining coffee warmth. If a daily high-quality coffee experience is something you value, I’d confidently recommend this machine.

Very confused please guide (M/40 and F/42),"I apologise for this very long post but I am hoping this community will be kind to me and help me navigate a life concern.

Being lonely in your mid-life with no friends and family (orphan) is very difficult and when life expects you to march on ahead every opportunity to learn and improve is respected.

HELP AND ADVICE REQUESTED: 
I have now reached a point in a potential relationship where I am pretty sure I have been friend zoned (details below) and seek guidance for self development. 

I understand that it is almost always better to walk away in such situations but I would like to understand it as well.

My request is to please help me with understanding, 
(1) Was I misreading any possibility of entering a relationship?
(2) What did I mess up? Please help me with any tips on what I should do (now and future).
(3) Is it safe to say that I should just walk away and there is no scope for things to change?
(4) Would continuing to be friends be okay? I guess I should distance myself a fair bit and stop getting physical with them (very confusing).
(5) Was I being taken advantage of? I dont want to sound mean but is there any possibility that I was just being led on (on purpose for whatever reason)?

CONTEXT:

I have recently got very close emotionally to an old friend (40M and 42F). She reached out to me, wanted to meet up and over a span of two months we have started seeing each other almost twice a week.

Ok almost every occasion, it was she who would reach out and be very keen to spend time with me - travelling to whereever i was.

We went out for drinks a few times, got very physical (She initiated touches and I responded back to reciprocate) - all of it everywhere except chest area and the pubic region: including face, hair, neck, waist, knees etc. (not thighs).
We didnt come close to kissing but there was clearly a lot of tension. For example, when I was caressing her neck and move away she bought me back to her neck.

Twice we ended up in her apartment (including last night) and because we were a bit drunk I was worried about consent. 

Being a victim of domestic abuse I was very worried about not triggering anything and I couldn't bring myself to push boundaries.

CHANGE IN DYNAMICS:

The first time, we got home really late (early after sunrise) and spent almost an hour on the couch again quite touchy. 

When it was time to crash (sleep),  I asked her if we could move to the bedroom. At this point, she said she was happy to change the sheets and let me have the bed and she would take the couch.

I said we dont have to do anything even if we both are in the bed and we could just hug and sleep if thats all she wanted. She again repeated that i could sleep on the bed comfortably and she would take the couch.
To move past the hesitation: I suggested we both just use the same bed and sleep - to which she said NO.

I respected that (No means No) and we both eventually slept off and i went home the next day (we had coffee together but she was really hung over).

SECOND TIME AT HER PLACE:

Last night we were out again, dancing for hours and very close and intimate.
Several hours into the day, we reached a point in time where we a repeat of the First Time (above) happened. 

This time less physical but I had my head on her lap and she was caressing my hair/head.

It was getting very late and I again asked her several times if we could sleep but she kept doing what she was.

I sensed things could maybe escalate (move beyond the initial reluctance to sleep together/on the same bed) and asked if we could now ""hug together on the bed"".

She ignored it initially and deflected it but upon asking the second time she got very expressive in her objection (what i would describe as protective).

HER PUSHBACK TO MY SUGGESTION TO MOVE THINGS FORWARD: 

She said my suggestion that we ""bith sleep on the same bed jsut to hug like we were on the couch"" was a very clear 'push' of boundaries. 
- That this not something you should ask people to do unless you are well into a relation
- She apologised several times for leading me on (I tried assuring her that she had done nothing)
- I was only someone she liked being with and felt comfortable with

BACKGROUND

So we are two university friends (40M 42F) from a similar background culturally and went to university together. While studying we were friends but not so close and eventually grew apart.

I consider myself to be fairly decent looking (nothing too glamarous and probably average?) with a very successful career in Fianncial Services. I am in the top 5% income bracket in the UK and of modest assets and a place of my own in central London.

We finally meet up in London almost 25 years later, both with baggage from a previous life - divorced with children (hers pre teen and mine in primary school). Neither of us currently have our kids living with us for various reasons. 

She is the sole parent and financial bread winner for her kids. She has expressed this as a reason for why she has not entered a relationship and has no time for one. 

WHAT MADE ME THINK SHE MIGHT BE OPEN TO A RELATIONSHIP:

She said she briefly dated someone when she moved to London (a year or so ago) but due to his baggage, he refused to form a relationship with her and eventually they grew distant. 

This made me think,  she might consider a relationship under the right circumstances. 

Whenever we hang out, she has been very vocal about all the attention I was getting from other women and why I was not with one of them.

While there, I caught up with people I hadn’t seen in years. At the event, I ended up talking to my old crush and finally mustered up the courage to ask her out. After the event, another girl I reconnected with asked me if I wanted to go for a coffee sometime. When we met up, she admitted she had a huge crush on me at school, which I never noticed.

Considering how casual it all was at that point, I ended up going out with both. Both dates went well and I’ve essentially been seeing them both for the last month or so, which I feel kind of weird about as I’ve never got more than a second date before - let alone two! I was really shy in school so was a bit of a late bloomer. As a result, I really don’t have a lot of relationship experience so this whole dating thing is pretty new to me. 

It’s actually kind of frustrating, going years with hardly any dating prospects and now being faced with two at the same time. Dating two women at once really isn’t me and I know it’s time to commit one way or the other as I kind of feel bad about the situation and don’t want to lead anyone on. I’m just feeling really paralysed right now.

Got any advice for handling a situation like this? I’m woefully underprepared for something like this and am more than a bit socially awkward. What is the best way of tackling this? And how do I do it in the kindest way possible?

Reframe Your Thinking

Acknowledge Your Feelings: Don't ignore or suppress your burnout and anxiety. Name them. Say to yourself, ""I'm feeling burnt out and that's okay. This is a difficult process."" Acknowledging these feelings is the first step to moving past them.

View It as a Marathon, Not a Sprint: The NCLEX is a cumulative exam, not a test of what you can cram in a few days. Break down your studying into manageable chunks. You’re not just studying for an exam; you’re consolidating all the knowledge you've built over years.

Take Strategic Breaks;
 Schedule Time Off: Seriously, put it in your calendar. Whether it’s a whole day, an afternoon, or just a few hours, make time to do something completely unrelated to nursing.

The Pomodoro Technique: Study for a focused 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. After four cycles, take a longer 15-30 minute break. This prevents your mind from wandering and keeps you from feeling overwhelmed.

Do Something You Love: Read a book, watch a movie, go for a walk, cook a meal, or play a video game. Don't feel guilty about this time off. It's an investment in your mental health, which is a key part of your NCLEX success.

Change Your Scenery: If you've been studying in the same spot for days, go to a coffee shop, a library, or even just another room in your house. A change of environment can feel refreshing and reduce feelings of being ""stuck.""

Study Smarter, Not Harder;
Focus on High-Yield Topics: Don't try to master every single detail. Prioritize the topics that are most frequently tested on the NCLEX:
   * Prioritization and Delegation
   * Infection Control
   * Safety (Fall Risk, Medication Errors, etc.)
   * Pharmacology (Drug Classes, Side Effects)
   * Fundamental Nursing Skills

Utilize Effective Resources: If a resource is making you feel more anxious, stop using it. Stick with what works for you. Naxlex, Mark Klimek's lectures, and simple nursing videos are popular for a reason.

The Power of Active Recall: Instead of just rereading your notes, practice active recall. Use flashcards, quizzes, or try to teach a concept to a friend. This solidifies the information and builds confidence.

Prioritize Your Physical Well-being
Get Enough Sleep: Sleep is essential for memory consolidation and for managing anxiety. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night.

Eat Nutritious Meals: Your brain needs fuel. Avoid living on caffeine and junk food. Eat balanced meals with fruits, vegetables, and protein.

Move Your Body: Exercise is one of the most effective stress relievers. Even a 20-minute walk can significantly reduce anxiety and clear your head.

Build a Support System
 Talk to Someone: You are not alone. Talk to friends or family who understand what you're going through. Your classmates are a great resource for commiserating and sharing strategies.

Limit Social Media Comparison: It's easy to see someone's success story and feel like you're falling behind. Remember that everyone's journey is different. You only see the highlight reel, not the sleepless nights and moments of doubt.

By integrating these strategies into your routine, you can manage the feelings of burnout and anxiety, regain your motivation, and approach the NCLEX with a clearer, more confident mindset.",5,1754146335.0,NClexJourney,1,1.0,False

I didn’t want press any buttons and ask, what’s the phase called? How long is said phase?? Will phase 2, makeup for phase 1?? Why is she saying “phase” like where in a business presentation???

Anyways…progress maybe? Or just awareness…I dunno..was something I guess…

But, like I said…coffee tastes amazing, yard is a wreck, my golden floof is relentlessly barking at the birds on the bird feeder, thinking of whipping up some breakfast for the fam, avocado toast for me….sweat out a workout and kick this weekends ass!!

I’ve got the big ones covered, museums, a couple parks, some restaurants/breweries but I’d really love to get feedback from locals.

Here’s what I’m planning so far:

* North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences & Museum of History
* NC Museum of Art + sculpture park
* Walk around City Market, Fayetteville Street, and maybe North Hills
* Umstead State Park for some hiking/biking
* Food spots like Brewery Bhavana, Beasley’s Chicken + Honey, Bida Manda, and Big Ed’s for breakfast
* A couple local breweries & coffee shops

I’m sure there’s a ton I’m missing...  
Any hidden gems, great coffee, live music, neighborhoods to wander, or cool events?

Really looking forward to checking out Raleigh and getting a feel for the city. Thanks in advance for any tips!",0,1754146260.0,NorthCarolina,0,0.33,False

Not sure what happened... was driving to the bank and got a warning where the RPM is at... couldn't read it fast enough and didn't have my cheaters on. LOL.    
then all the warning lights came on.  The coffee cup one I laughed at... but think that is a reminder that I need to stretch on long trips.    
but what I did read was something about the smart cruise being inoperable and not all functions being there.    when i parked... came back out.. .car was fine and life went on.    
i'm in AZ and it was hot yesterday... so is this something that can be caused by heat or sun directly into the cameras?   it seemed to happen when I turned west on the road and the sun was right in front of me.",1,1754146238.0,KiaSorento,1,1.0,False

1mfsduq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mfsduq/i_dont_think_thats_my_wife_anymore/,I Don’t Think That’s My Wife Anymore,"This isn't easy to write about. Not after everything. My hands shake so much I can barely type without having to retype whole sentences, and my mind… it’s a spiderweb of shadows and whispers. But the doctor, the one who actually seems to believe me – or at least, pretends to – says letting it out might help. That maybe, if I can put it into words, I can finally untangle the knots in my head.

They call it PTSD. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. I call it living in a permanent nightmare, a reality stretched and torn until it barely resembles the one I knew.

Before… before it all started, my life was good. Not just good, it was perfect. I had Sarah. Her name was Sarah. Just writing it down makes my throat tighten. She was everything. Her laugh, bright and clear like wind chimes. Her eyes, the color of warm honey, always crinkling at the corners when she smiled. The way she’d hum while cooking, or tuck her feet under her on the sofa, a book resting open on her chest. We lived in a small, two-story house, tucked away on a quiet street in the suburbs. A little slice of heaven, we called it. We’d bought it together, painted the walls, planted a garden. It was our sanctuary.

It was our coffin.

It began subtly. So subtly that for weeks, I dismissed it. Attributed it to stress, to my imagination, to the house settling. A faint smell, at first. Like damp earth, or maybe something a little sweeter, but cloying. I’d sniff the air, wander through the rooms, checking for leaks, for forgotten food. Sarah would laugh, say I was being paranoid. ""It's just the old house, Liam,"" she'd say, her voice warm, familiar. ""Breathing.""

Then came the sounds. Rustles from empty corners. A faint scratching, like nails on plaster, deep within the walls, usually when the house was quietest – late at night, or early in the morning before the world woke up. Sometimes, I’d swear I heard a soft, wet squelch. I’d freeze, heart hammering, straining to hear it again. But it would be gone. Just the creak of the floorboards, the distant hum of the refrigerator.

Sarah didn't seem to notice. Or if she did, she didn’t mention it. She’d sleep soundly beside me, her breathing even, undisturbed. And I, being the rational man I thought I was, tried to be like her. To ignore the growing prickle on my skin, the sense of being watched even in our own bedroom.

The first noticeable change came with the air. It grew colder. Not just a draft – a pervasive, bone-chilling cold that seemed to emanate from the very walls. I checked the heating, sealed windows, but it didn't help. Sarah started bundling up, wearing extra sweaters, but still, she dismissed my concerns. ""It's just winter coming, Liam. You're getting soft,"" she'd joke, but her smiles seemed a little… thinner. A little less genuine.

I told myself it was my imagination. I told myself I was tired. I told myself I was being ridiculous. I told myself a lot of things. And every single one of them was a lie I desperately needed to believe.

The house began to feel… wrong. Not just the cold, not just the smells or the phantom noises. It was a subtle shift in its very essence. The shadows seemed deeper, more alive. The natural sunlight, which used to pour in through our kitchen window, felt muted, filtered through something unseen. The wallpaper in the hallway, a soft floral pattern Sarah had picked out, seemed to warp just at the edges when I wasn't looking directly at it.

And Sarah… she started to change too.

It wasn't overnight. It was a creeping, insidious alteration. Little things, at first, that I wrote off as stress or fatigue. She’d always been a morning person, chirpy and bright. Now, she lingered in bed, often not stirring until I nudged her. Her movements, once graceful and fluid, became… precise. A little too precise. Like she was thinking about each step, each gesture.

I remember one morning, she was making coffee. She always used to hum a little tune while she ground the beans. That morning, she stood perfectly still, her back to me, the grinder whirring. Her shoulders were hunched, and for a split second, I saw a strange, almost convulsive twitch in her left arm, quickly suppressed. When she turned, her smile was there, but her eyes… her eyes were flat. Like the light in them had dimmed.

""Everything alright, love?"" I asked, a knot forming in my stomach.

""Perfectly fine, Liam,"" she said, her voice a little too even, a little too saccharine. ""Just thinking.""

But what was she thinking about? She never elaborated. She used to share everything with me. Every thought, every worry, every silly dream. Now, there was a wall. An invisible, impenetrable barrier.

Her habits shifted too. She stopped reading her paperback novels, something she used to do every night. Instead, she’d sit in the living room, often in the dark, just staring at the television, which wasn't even on. I’d walk in, and she’d jump, startled, then offer that same unnerving, flat smile.

""Just resting my eyes,"" she'd say. ""Long day.""

But her days weren't long. She didn't work. She was supposed to be designing our new garden layout, filling her time with things she loved. But the garden remained untouched, slowly becoming overgrown.

The smell intensified. That earthy, sickly sweet scent, a mix of damp soil and something else… something organic and decaying. It clung to Sarah. I’d try to hold her close, to smell her familiar scent – her shampoo, her perfume, her unique skin musk – but it was always there, underneath it all, that terrible, cloying odor. It made my stomach churn.

""Are you feeling okay, Sarah?"" I asked one evening, trying to sound casual as she sat across from me at dinner, barely touching her food.

She looked up, her spoon halfway to her mouth. Her eyes were wide, unblinking. ""Why, Liam? Do I not look okay?""

Her tone was unsettling. Defensive, almost aggressive. And for a moment, just a flicker, her face seemed to contort. The muscles in her jaw tightened, her lips pulled back too far, revealing a flash of teeth that seemed too long, too pointed. Then it was gone, replaced by a perfect, bland expression.

""You just seem a little… quiet,"" I stammered, my heart thumping against my ribs.

""People change, Liam. Don't they?"" she said, and then she went back to pushing the food around on her plate.

I couldn’t eat. My appetite had vanished days ago. I started losing weight. Sleeping became a luxury I couldn't afford, perpetually on edge, listening to the house, listening to Sarah. I found myself watching her, scrutinizing every move, every blink, every breath. And the more I watched, the more I saw.

The way her fingers would sometimes clench, almost convulsively, when she thought I wasn't looking. The subtle, almost imperceptible tremor in her right hand as she held her coffee cup. The way her eyes would occasionally drift, focusing on something far beyond the walls, a look of chilling vacancy replacing the familiar warmth.

And then, I found it. In the utility closet, tucked behind some old paint cans. A small, dark, viscous puddle. It smelled of that same sickly-sweet earth, but stronger, more pungent. I touched it with my finger. It was thick, gelatinous, and left a faint, disturbing stickiness. I wiped my finger on an old rag, but the smell clung to me. I scrubbed my hand raw, but I could still feel it, deep under my skin.

I tried to talk to her about it. ""Sarah,"" I said, holding the rag, ""what is this?""

She barely glanced up from the blank TV screen. ""What's what, Liam?""

""This,"" I insisted, bringing the rag closer. ""This… goo. From the closet.""

She finally turned, her stare unnervingly direct. Her lips curved into that thin, unsettling smile. ""Oh, that. Just a bit of damp, I suppose. The pipes are old.""

""It's not damp, Sarah. It feels… organic.""

Her smile widened, her eyes fixed on mine. ""Organic? Silly, Liam. It's just water. Or maybe… maybe something from the garden, tracking in.""

But she hadn't been in the garden in weeks. Never mind the garden. She hadn't been herself in weeks.

My mind raced. Was she sick? Was it a breakdown? But the way she looked at me… it wasn't Sarah. It was something else. Something pretending to be her.

The terror, cold and sharp, began to truly sink its teeth into me.

The breaking point arrived with a memory. Our memory.

We had a ritual. Every year, on our anniversary, we’d revisit the little bakery where we’d had our first date. We’d order the same two lemon tarts and share them, reminiscing about that awkward, beautiful day. It was our secret, our special thing.

Two days after I found the black goo, I tried to bring it up. ""Our anniversary is coming up, Sarah,"" I said, trying to inject some warmth into my voice. ""Remember the bakery? Lemon tarts?""

She was in the kitchen, washing dishes. Her back was to me. She paused, and for a long moment, there was no sound but the quiet drip of water. Then she turned. Her face was blank.

""Lemon tarts, Liam? Why would we get lemon tarts?"" Her voice was devoid of recognition, devoid of the usual playful exasperation she’d express at my sentimental attachment to the ritual. Her eyes… they were too wide, too still.

My blood ran cold. ""Sarah. Our first date. The bakery on Elm Street. We got lemon tarts. Every year since.""

She frowned, or rather, a perfect imitation of a frown creased her brow. ""I don't recall that, Liam. We prefer apple pie.""

Apple pie. Sarah hated apple pie. She was allergic to cinnamon.

A sudden, dizzying wave of nausea hit me. This wasn't her. It couldn't be. My wife, my Sarah, would never forget something so profoundly personal, so utterly us.

""Sarah,"" I whispered, my voice trembling. ""What are you talking about? You're allergic to cinnamon, you hate apple pie.""

Her eyes narrowed, and the perfect imitation of a frown deepened. ""Don't be absurd, Liam. I've always loved apple pie.""

And then, I saw it again. A flicker. In her eyes, a momentary shift from honey-brown to something darker, something opaque and utterly alien. Her skin, which had always been soft and warm, seemed to ripple for a split second, like water disturbed by an unseen force. The sickly-sweet odor intensified, thick and suffocating.

""You're not Sarah,"" I croaked, stumbling backward, hitting the counter.

Her smile broadened, stretching her mouth impossibly wide. Too wide. It wasn't a human smile. Her teeth, previously just a fleeting glimpse, now seemed to elongate, to sharpen, gleaming wetly in the kitchen light. The honey-brown of her eyes swirled, shifting to an inky black, reflecting the light like polished obsidian.

""Of course I am, Liam,"" the thing that looked like her hissed, the sound not quite human, a sibilant whisper that seemed to come from everywhere at once. ""Who else would I be?""

And then, it moved. Not like Sarah, not like any human. It glided across the kitchen floor, its feet not lifting, but sliding, like a slug across wet stone. It was too fast, too smooth. In a terrifying instant, it was directly in front of me, its face mere inches from mine.

Its breath was foul, the putrid smell of decay mixed with that cloying sweetness. I could see the tiny, almost imperceptible twitching under its skin, as if something was writhing beneath the surface. And its eyes… they were no longer Sarah’s. They were bottomless pits of pure, malicious intelligence.

""I am better,"" it whispered, the voice no longer even trying to mimic Sarah’s. It was a guttural, rasping sound that vibrated through my bones. ""I am perfect.""

My scream caught in my throat. I pushed past it, shoving it with all my strength, no longer caring if I hurt Sarah. But it didn’t budge. It was like pushing against solid rock. And as I looked, my horror ratcheted up another notch.

From beneath the hem of its long-sleeved shirt, at the wrist, I saw a flash of something utterly abhorrent. Not skin. Not fabric. But a fleshy, multi-jointed appendage, thick and pale, like a tendril, retracting swiftly back into the sleeve.

This wasn't my wife. This wasn't human. It was something that wore her skin, wore her face, wore her memories like borrowed clothes. And it was here. In my house. With me.

Panic, pure and unadulterated, seized me. My mind screamed, Run! But my legs felt like lead. The thing, this grotesque mockery of Sarah, simply stood there, watching me, its black eyes burning.

""Where are you going, Liam?"" it purred, its voice a chilling parody of concern. ""Don't you want to stay with me?""

I stumbled backward, my heart hammering like a trapped bird. The kitchen, once bright and welcoming, felt like a cage. The air was thick with that putrid, sweet smell, and I could hear new sounds now – a faint, wet sucking from the walls, a low, rhythmic throb that seemed to come from the very floorboards beneath my feet. The house was alive. And it was hostile.

I bolted. Not for the front door, not yet. My instinct was just to get away, to find a weapon, to find a way to understand. I ran into the living room, heading for the old fireplace poker. But the moment I reached for it, the room shifted. No, not the room. My perception. The shadows deepened, twisting into grotesque shapes. The familiar furniture seemed to lean in, to watch me.

The thing that was Sarah was suddenly there, blocking the doorway to the hall. It moved with an impossible speed, a blur of motion. Its face was no longer attempting to hold Sarah’s beautiful features. The skin was stretched taut, almost translucent, revealing the dark, writhing mass beneath. Its jaw unhinged, dropping impossibly low, a black void from which that wet, sibilant hiss emanated.

""You can't leave, Liam,"" it slavered, a string of viscous fluid dangling from its chin. ""You belong to me now.""

I screamed, a raw, terrified sound. I grabbed the heavy brass poker, swinging it wildly. It hit something soft, yielding, and I heard a wet thwack. The creature staggered back a step, a low growl emanating from its throat. For a horrifying moment, a section of its chest, where the poker had connected, bulged unnaturally, then seemed to shrivel inward, only to reform, slowly, sickeningly, as if its very flesh was fluid, adapting.

I didn't wait. I turned and ran, desperate. Not for the front door - the thing was between me and it. I ran up the stairs, two at a time, my mind screaming for an escape, any escape.

The upstairs hallway was a nightmare. The wallpaper had peeled in places, revealing not plaster, but a dark, fibrous, almost fungal growth beneath. The air was thick and heavy, like breathing through a wet cloth. I could hear the faint, rhythmic pulse again, stronger now, as if the house itself had a heartbeat, a monstrous, alien pulse.

I tried the bathroom door, locked. Our bedroom, locked. Every door, every escape route, sealed. A chilling realization struck me: the locks weren't just engaged, they were fused. Melted into the doorframes. This wasn't just a creature; it was integrated with the house. The house was part of it.

I was trapped.

Then, a glint of light from the end of the hallway, from the old linen closet door. It wasn't completely closed. It was usually tightly shut, crammed with blankets and towels. Why was it ajar? My mind, in its terror, grasped at any deviation from the norm.

I pushed it open. It wasn't a linen closet anymore.

The small space had been hollowed out. The back wall was gone, revealing a dark, uneven tunnel, smelling intensely of that sweet, putrid earth. It was narrow, barely wide enough for me to squeeze through. A raw, gaping maw in the heart of my home.

And from within that darkness, a faint, almost imperceptible sound. A muffled, desperate whimpering.

My heart stopped.

The whimpering. It was faint, barely audible over the thrumming, squelching sounds of the house, but it was there. A human sound. And it sounded like… recognition.

My mind, screaming for answers, for Sarah, propelled me forward. I squeezed through the narrow opening, the rough, organic walls of the tunnel scraping against my skin. The smell was overpowering now, a suffocating miasma of decay and something else, something metallic and thick like old blood.

The tunnel twisted downwards, a crude, unlit passage. I plunged into absolute darkness, relying on my hands, feeling the damp, slimy walls. They weren’t plaster. They were… fleshy. Pulsating. Like the inside of some colossal, diseased organ. I could feel tiny, almost imperceptible cilia brushing against my skin, hear soft, wet sucking sounds from deeper within the walls themselves.

The whimpering grew louder, closer. And my blood ran cold, because now I recognized it. It was Sarah. But it wasn't her strong, vibrant voice. It was broken. Terrified.

I crawled through the suffocating darkness for what felt like an eternity, but could only have been a few minutes. Then, the tunnel opened into a small, irregular chamber. It was completely dark, but a faint, phosphorescent glow emanated from the walls themselves, a sickly green light that pulsed with the same rhythm as the house’s horrific heartbeat.

And in the center of that glowing chamber, chained. Not with metal, but with thick, ropy strands of that same organic, pulsing flesh that formed the walls. Chained to a pedestal of dark, oozing stone.

Was Sarah.

Or what was left of her.

My breath hitched. A guttural sob tore itself from my chest.

She was naked, her body emaciated, covered in a thin, translucent film of that same black, viscous substance I’d found in the closet. Her skin was pale, almost gray, stretched taut over her bones. Her hair, once vibrant and thick, was dull and sparse, clumped with the dark goo. Her eyes… her beautiful honey eyes were open, wide with terror, but they looked dull, lifeless, utterly defeated.

She whimpered again, a thin, reedy sound, and tried to lift her head, but she was too weak. The fleshy ropes held her fast, digging into her decaying flesh.

And then, I saw it. The true horror.

From her mouth, from her nose, from her eyes, from dozens of minuscule orifices that had opened on her skin, thin, black tendrils, like roots, extended into the walls and the pedestal. They weren’t just holding her. They were feeding. Sucking the life, the essence, the very Sarah-ness out of her. She was a husk. A battery.

The thing upstairs. The mimic. It hadn’t just replaced her. It had grown from her. It was using her.

My Sarah. My beautiful, vibrant wife. Reduced to this. A living, dying vessel for some unspeakable abomination.

Tears streamed down my face, hot and stinging. My heart was a frozen lump of lead in my chest. Rage, a primal, all-consuming fire, roared to life within me, momentarily overriding the terror.

""Sarah!"" I cried, my voice raw, broken. I scrambled forward, reaching for her, desperate to free her, to touch her, to tell her I was here.

But as my hand reached out, a soft, wet pop echoed in the chamber. One of the tendrils connecting her to the wall pulsed violently, then snapped. And from the small, gaping hole it left in her skin, a thick, milky white fluid, mixed with dark red, began to ooze.

Her eyes, lifeless moments before, locked onto mine. A flicker. The faintest, most fleeting spark of recognition. And then, slowly, agonizingly, a tear formed in the corner of her eye, crawling down her cheek, leaving a clean streak on her grimy skin.

And then her head slumped forward. Her breathing, already so shallow, ceased. The light in her eyes extinguished.

She was gone. My Sarah was truly, utterly gone.

The monster had taken her. It had consumed her. And I was too late.

A deep thrumming shook the chamber. The phosphorescent glow on the walls intensified, bathing everything in an eerie, sickly green. I heard a sound from the tunnel I’d come through. A shuffling. A wet, dragging sound.

It knew. It always knew.

It was coming for me.

The air in the chamber thickened, becoming almost gelatinous. The stench of decay and something else--something metallic and sharp, like ozone--choked me. The walls pulsed faster, the sickly green glow intensifying to an almost unbearable brightness. I could hear it. The thing that had worn Sarah’s face. It was in the tunnel, moving with that sickening, unnatural glide.

My every atom screamed for me to run, but my feet were rooted to the ground. I couldn’t leave her. Not now. Not like this. My Sarah. My beautiful Sarah. Reduced to a husk, her essence stolen, her body a feeding ground for this… this thing.

The rage, hot and blinding, returned. It was a desperate, suicidal impulse, but I didn’t care. If I was going to die, it would be fighting for her. For what was left of her dignity.

I grabbed a jagged piece of the oozing stone pedestal, surprisingly sharp. Its surface was warm, wet, and pulsed faintly in my hand. I turned to face the tunnel, my eyes burning, tears mixing with the sweat on my face.

The first part of it emerged from the darkness. Not its face. Not its hands. But a limb. A thick, pale, segmented arm, dripping black fluid. It extruded from the tunnel opening, feeling its way, like a blind worm. Then another. And another. More than two arms, more than any human should possess. They seemed to retract and extend with each pulse of the living wall around them.

Then, its head emerged.

No longer a grotesque parody of Sarah. It was a true nightmare. The skin was peeled back in places, revealing raw, red musculature beneath. Its mouth was a gaping maw, rows of needle-like teeth glistening in the green light. Its eyes – multiple, gleaming black orbs – were set into its misshapen head, tracking me with terrifying precision. Its neck stretched, elongating, twisting, as if trying to get a better view. And from its back, where Sarah’s spine would have been, a series of thick, chitinous plates had erupted, pulsating with that internal green glow.

It was a monstrosity of raw, organic horror. A creature born of human flesh and something utterly alien.

It hissed, a sound like a thousand angry snakes, and began to pull itself fully into the chamber. Its body was a mass of writhing, glistening limbs and distorted flesh, too large for the space, yet it seemed to flow, to contort, to fit. It moved with a horrifying fluidity, like a slug made of human nightmares.

""You took her!"" I screamed, my voice cracking, ""You took my Sarah!""

I lunged, swinging the jagged stone with all my remaining strength, aiming for its head. It moved with incredible speed, a blur of pale flesh and black tendrils. The stone connected, but not with its head. It struck one of its many thick, segmented arms.

A wet CRACK echoed in the chamber. The creature shrieked, a sound of pure, unadulterated pain that was somehow worse than its horrific appearance. The arm, where I’d struck it, shuddered violently, then began to dissolve. Not bleed in a normal way, but to melt, to liquefy, the organic matter bubbling and steaming on the stone floor. It was like striking a column of acid.

But then, as if in retaliation, the arm re-grew. A sickeningly fast regeneration, tendrils spurting out from the wound, weaving together, forming new flesh with unnerving speed. It was already healing.

I stumbled back, horrified by the impossibility of it. It was invincible.

The creature lunged. It wasn't the slow, slithering creep of a moment before. It was a terrifying, inhuman burst of speed. Its monstrous limbs shot out, enveloping me. Thick, pale tendrils wrapped around my arms, my legs, my torso, squeezing, crushing the air from my lungs. The smell of it was overwhelming, acidic.

I thrashed, I screamed, I fought, but it was useless. Its grip was immense. I could feel its numerous eyes boring into me, a chilling, intelligent gaze.

""You are mine,"" it hissed, its voice no longer even remotely human, but a chorus of guttural clicks and slithers, resonating directly inside my skull. ""You are just like her. A vessel. A host.""

I felt a sharp, searing pain in my side. One of its smaller, needle-like appendages had pierced my skin. It wasn't a claw or tooth, but something like a hollow proboscis. I felt a cold, burning liquid being injected into my flesh. My muscles spasmed uncontrollably.

It intended to do to me what it had done to Sarah. To consume me. To erase me.

My vision began to blur. Black spots danced before my eyes. The chamber pulsed violently, the green light flashing. I heard a distant, almost forgotten sound. The siren of an emergency vehicle. Faint, outside, in the real world. Someone must have heard my screams. Or perhaps a neighbor, alerted by the prolonged silence from our house, had called.

The creature paused, its black eyes flickering, sensing the disturbance. For a fraction of a second, its grip loosened.

It was all I needed.

With a desperate, primal surge of adrenaline, fueled by the image of Sarah’s lifeless body, I pulled, twisted, and tore myself free from its grip. The pain was immense. Flesh ripped. A burning sensation spread through my entire right side. But I was free.

I didn't look back. I launched myself into the tunnel, scrambling, clawing, desperate to escape its grasp. I heard a roar of pure, frustrated rage from behind me, and the sound of the creature tearing itself through the narrow opening, its body scraping, squelching against the organic walls.

I didn't stop. I crawled faster than I ever thought possible, pushing through the suffocating darkness, the horrifying stench, the wet, pulsating walls. Up and up, until I burst back out into the ruined hallway, gasping for breath, my lungs burning.

The house was screaming now. Not just through the creature, but the very structure itself. Walls weeping black fluid, floorboards bulging and cracking, windows rattling violently. The emergency sirens were closer now, wailing just outside.

I could still hear the creature behind me, scrabbling through the tunnel, its bulk too great for the small space. It was enraged.

I stumbled down the stairs, ignoring the agony in my side, ignoring the blood that soaked my shirt. The front door. It was no longer fused. It was ajar, splintered, as if someone had tried to force it open from the outside. The fresh, cold air of the outside world, so different from the suffocating rot within, hit me like a physical blow.

I burst out onto the porch, collapsing onto the lawn, gasping, shaking, sobbing. The world spun. Police cars, an ambulance, flashing red and blue lights. Neighbors peering from their windows, their faces etched with shock and fear.

And behind me, the house. Our house. It was a living, breathing horror. Black, viscous fluids oozed from its windows and doors. The very bricks seemed to writhe. A low, guttural roar emanated from within its confines, a sound that would haunt my nightmares forever.

Then, with a final, shuddering groan, the house seemed to implode, sending out a wave of black, putrid smoke. The structure twisted, collapsed inward, dissolving into a mound of smoking, wet earth and organic mass. It didn't burn. It didn't explode. It just… disintegrated. Like a putrid, rotten organism finally giving up the ghost.

The last thing I saw before blacking out was a single, long, pale tendril, twitching in the smoking ruins, before it too, retracted into the earth.

They found me, half-dead, bleeding, incoherent, raving about monsters and a wife that wasn't a wife. They found the smoking, unidentifiable mound where my house used to be. They found nothing else. No bodies. No trace of Sarah. No evidence of what I had seen, beyond the physical trauma to my body and the utter, undeniable madness in my eyes.

The police investigated. They called it an ""unexplained structural collapse."" They looked for accelerants, for gas leaks, for sinkholes. They found nothing. Just that strange, dark, incredibly fertile earth that seemed to pulse faintly under their feet for days afterward. They wrote me off as a survivor in shock, delusional, suffering from severe trauma.

I was hospitalized. First, for my injuries. The wound in my side was deep, strangely cauterized, and they couldn’t quite identify what had caused it. It healed with an unnerving rapidity, leaving a raised, purplish scar that sometimes throbs and tingles.

Then, for my mind. They tried to tell me I imagined it all. That the stress of life, the natural aging of an old house, my grief for a wife who must have simply vanished – that it all conspired to create a vivid nightmare. They gave me pills. Lots of pills. For the nightmares. For the anxiety. For the paranoia. But none of them silence the screams in my head. None of them erase the image of Sarah, chained and consumed, or the monstrous thing that wore her skin.

I’m out now, living in a small, sterile apartment. Every creak of the floorboards makes me jump. Every shadow sends my heart racing. I check the locks obsessively, multiple times a night. I can’t sleep without the lights on, and even then, I see them. The eyes. The black, glistening eyes of the creature.

I don’t trust anyone. Not fully. Every face I see, every gesture, I scrutinize it. Is that a flicker? Is that a nuance of emotion that seems off? Is that a smile that stretches just a little too wide? Is that familiar smell I just caught, just a trick of the mind, or is it that sickly-sweet decay?

They say I'm getting better. That I'm coming to terms with the ""loss."" But I didn't lose Sarah. She was taken. She was consumed. And a part of me believes… no, knows… that it’s still out there. That it didn't die with the house. That it simply moved on, or found a new host, or perhaps, lay dormant, waiting.

Sometimes, when I’m alone in the dead of night, I swear I can still feel it. That cold, burning sensation in my scar. A soft, wet squelch from the walls of this new, unfamiliar apartment. And that faint, cloying smell, just on the edge of perception, like damp earth and something sickly sweet.

And sometimes… when I look in the mirror… I see a subtle shift in my own eyes. A glint of something cold. Something that wasn’t there before.

And sometimes… I still hear her. Not Sarah’s laugh. Not her voice. But that low, guttural hiss. The one that told me, ""I am perfect.""

And sometimes… just sometimes… I wonder if a little piece of that perfection came with me. Deep inside. Waiting.",2,1754146174.0,nosleep,0,0.75,False

\[Warning\] Story contains graphic scenes 

Sarah overlooked the children at first, but she heard the laughter and the giggles. A soft, tuneless murmur that drifted through the walls in the late afternoons, sometimes light and sometimes barely there, like something breathing just beneath the floorboards. It wasn’t unpleasant.

She’d moved into the apartment complex three weeks ago. A weathered little building with mismatched paint on the doors and a landlord who answered texts with emojis instead of words. But the rent was cheap, and her classes were just a fifteen-minute walk away. That was enough.

The neighbours, if they were home, kept to themselves. She only heard them in passing. For instance, a cupboard closing, the occasional tapping of feet as though someone paced the hallway, or even the sound of the elevator doors opening and closing.

That afternoon, she noticed two children standing outside her door. A girl in a yellow dress and a boy with curls falling into his eyes, twins. The hallway light flickered when they spoke, and Sarah almost laughed at how cinematic it felt.

“We live next door,” the girl said. “You’re the new one?”

Sarah hesitated. “Yeah. Apartment 6A.”

The boy didn’t say anything, just held tightly to a plush rabbit that looked like it had been washed too many times. His shoes were untied and worn vice-versa. The girl’s dress had a stain near the hem, like raspberry juice or watercolour paint.

“Our mum says we can go to the waterpark this weekend,” the girl went on. “You should come.”

She smiled, and Sarah felt something strange curl beneath her ribs. It reminded her of summers she spent with her mother flying her favourite kite.

“Maybe,” she said, “Do you like flying kites?”

“What is a kite?” the girl asked, moving closer to Sarah.

“I will show you when we visit the park.”

After that, the twins came often. Sometimes in the morning, waiting outside her door with questions that didn’t sound like questions. Sometimes in the afternoon, they would stand outside the building waiting for her to play with them. Sarah started getting snacks, and they began leaving drawings. A child’s sort of barter.

She never saw the parents. Not once, but the children always spoke of them from time to time, but not that much.

“*Mum’s cooking tonight*.” They would say.

“*Dad says we’re not allowed to go past the third floor.”*

*The kind of conversations you would have with eight-year-olds. However, they never spoke once about their favourite school teacher as if they never existed. Alina spoke as if she had never had friends; however, Drew spoke about a boy once, and never again. He did include him in one of his drawings, Carl.*

Sarah was taking out the trash when she saw them again. Alina and Drew were standing by the stairwell, like they’d been waiting for her. Alina smiled right away, but Drew didn’t look up. He was holding that stuffed rabbit again, the one with the long ears and the missing eye. His hoodie sleeves nearly covered his hands. On one foot, he wore a red sneaker, and on the other had a grey sock with a brown stain on the heel.

“You dropped something?” Sarah asked, trying to lighten up the mood.

Alina stepped forward, her eyes not leaving Sarah. “Drew dropped his shoe.”

“Oh no,” Sarah said. “Where’d it go?”

Alina tilted her chin upward, toward the small square window at the end of the. “It fell out. I think it went straight into the dumpster.”

Sarah kneeled to their level. “Oh no. We should go and get it,” she held out her hand, “Right?”

Drew didn’t answer, but Alina did. “Yes, we should.”

The pitch of her voice increased, holding onto Sarah’s hand.

“What about you, Drew?” she asked.

Drew's fingers tightened around the ear of the rabbit. Without saying a word, he walked closer to Sarah and held onto her cardigan.

“Amazing then,” Sarah said. “Let’s go get your shoe.”

“Wait, I just remembered something,” Alina said quickly. “The lid of the dumpster is too heavy. We tried, and it was buzzing too. Like it’s full of bees.”

Sarah raised an eyebrow. “Bees?”

Drew’s mouth pressed into a thin line.

“He’s afraid of them,” Alina whispered, like it was a secret too fragile for the hallway to hear.

“I’m not,” he mumbled. This was the first time Sarah heard him speak.

Sarah glanced at the trash bag in her hand. She was already heading down there anyway. “Okay,” she said. “Let’s go.”

Alina followed quickly. Drew stayed behind for a second, then walked after them. His sock made a soft sound against the floor. He didn’t say anything.

Outside, the dumpster was behind the building, under a tree that had lost most of its leaves. The lid was closed but wasn’t locked. Sarah grabbed the edge and pushed it open. It smelled worse than she expected. She could hear the buzzing sound from inside, followed by a shallow bang hitting the wall. She looked at the twins, covering her nose and mouth with the sleeve of her cardigan.

“Stand over there. Alina, protect your brother so that he won’t get stung by bees.”

Alina nodded, holding her brother onto her chest. Sarah moved closer to the dumpster, one step after the other. She could hear her heart throbbing as if she were anticipating the worst. With one blow, she nudged the lid open with her elbow and peered in.

Immediately, a swarm of flies escaped the dumpster, catching Sarah with immense surprise. Behind the flies were two bats, followed by four cats. She gestured her hand, trying to purify the air before throwing her trash out.

“Drew,” she called gently. “What colour was the shoe?”

He looked up for the first time, eyes wide and a little too still.

“Red,” he said. “With a star on the side.”

Sarah nodded, and there it was, sitting neatly on a flattened cereal box, right on top like someone had placed it there instead of tossed it.

“You’re a lucky one,” she said. “Almost like it was waiting for you.”

She reached in and grabbed it, brushing off some dirt that clung to the sole. “Here you go,” she said, handing it back.

Drew took it, but his hands were cold. Too cold for a sunny afternoon in March.

She opened her mouth to ask if he was okay, but Alina had already taken his hand again.

“Thank you,” she said sweetly. “We have to go now.”

Then, just like that, they were halfway across the parking lot, their shadows trailing behind them.

Sarah wiped her hands on her jeans. The smell from the dumpster still clinging to her. She stood there for a moment, unsure whether to go straight back upstairs or take a walk around the building first. The air felt better away from the dumpster, anyways.

Near the fence, something caught her eye. A stack of old newspapers had been left on the bench beside the maintenance door. Most were faded or water-damaged, but one was open and dry. She walked toward it, thinking maybe someone had been reading it on a break.

The headline was simple, printed in a box near the bottom,  
**Couple murdered in Apartment. Children still missing.**

She paused. The paper wasn’t dated, or maybe the top half had been torn off. The photo beneath the headline was black-and-white and slightly blurred. Two adults, a man with short hair and a woman with her hair tied neatly at the back, no children. Sarah flipped the page over and found nothing else about it. No follow-up, no names, nothing.

“Old news,” a voice said from behind her.

She turned and saw the janitor. She’d seen him before, early mornings, pushing a mop bucket through the lobby. He wore the same grey cap every day. The kind that never seemed to come off, even when it rained.

“Sorry,” Sarah said. “Was this yours?”

He shook his head. “Been sitting there all week. Kids sometimes bring junk from the bins. Half the stuff out here comes from people who never really left.”

She didn’t know what to say to that, so she nodded and looked back at the paper.

The janitor leaned against the bench. “You just moved in?”

“Yeah. Three weeks ago.”

He made a small sound in his throat. “That’s about when they start showing up.”

She looked up, unsure what he meant, but he was already walking off back to the side door with his gloves tucked in his back pocket.

She looked at the photo again. Something about the woman’s face felt familiar. She folded the page and slipped it into her back pocket, thinking maybe she’d read it later, when she had time.

As she turned to leave, she noticed something on the ground.

A small puddle had started to form near the dumpster. At first, she thought it was water, runoff from someone cleaning, but it was thick. It slid slowly from underneath the metal, moving in a line toward the fence, like it was following a crack in the pavement. She stared at it for a second. Then the wind picked up, tugging the edge of the paper sticking out of her pocket. Sarah walked away without checking twice.

Sarah was sitting on the floor, her laptop propped up against the coffee table. She had a half-written essay open and was halfway through typing a sentence when her phone buzzed again.

“Still not done?” Mia asked on the other end.

Sarah sighed. “No. I keep deleting things. It’s one of those prompts that looks easy until you actually start.”

“The one about moral responsibility?”

“Yeah. Which is ironic, because I’m seriously thinking about plagiarising now.”

Mia laughed. “You won’t. You’re too uptight.”

Sarah didn’t argue. She glanced at the time. It was almost six, and outside, the light had that washed-out look it got before the streetlamps came on. That’s when the knock came. Three soft taps, spaced too evenly to be casual.

“Hold on,” Sarah said into the phone.

She opened the door. Alina and Drew stood there, Alina with the same yellow dress and the same oversized hoodie. This time, the rabbit was missing. Drew was holding something else, an action figure or a little plastic soldier.

“Hi,” Alina said.

Sarah opened the door wider. “You can come in. I’m on a call, though.”

The twins stepped past her without hesitation and went straight to the living room. They dropped to the carpet and started sorting through the stack of crayons and colouring books she kept in the corner.

Mia was still talking. Something about her roommate stealing almond milk again. Sarah let her talk, half-listening and half typing.

It was quiet for a while. Just the soft scratch of crayons and the sound of Mia’s voice in her ear. Then something changed. The sound came in fast and loud. A scream, followed by a high, choked cry like someone was being dragged underwater. She could hear coughing or choking, like they couldn’t breathe. After that, someone started begging. The voice was scared and weak, like they were in pain.

Sarah stood up.

“Mia, hang on,” she said.

She walked into the living room.

The twins were standing at the window, side by side, looking out. They were laughing. Alina tilted her head back like something outside was funny. Drew was pointing, though his mouth didn’t move. Sarah looked outside but saw nothing. Just the parking lot, empty except for the usual cars.

Mia’s voice came through the phone, sharp now. “What the hell was that? Was someone screaming?”

“I don’t know,” Sarah said, trying to keep her voice steady. “I think it was the TV.”

“Sounded like it was in your room.”

Sarah didn’t answer. She stepped closer to the twins. Her eyes, glued onto their shadows on the floor that didn’t match what they were wearing. Drew’s silhouette showed him in shorts, not the hoodie. Alina’s shadow had no dress, it looked like she was wearing pants, and her hair was tied up instead of hanging loose. Sarah blinked. The shadows didn’t move the same either. Alina turned her head to the left, but the shadow turned right with a half-second delay.

“Sarah?” Mia said again. “You still there?”

She blinked again, looking down. The shadows were normal now.

“Yeah,” she said quickly. “Sorry. Thought I saw something weird.”

Mia kept talking. Sarah walked back to her laptop. She didn’t look at the twins again for the rest of the call.

Sarah didn’t remember falling asleep.

Her laptop hummed quietly, casting blue light across the coffee table. The crayons the twins had been using were scattered across the floor, but the children themselves were nowhere to be seen. The air felt heavier, humid like someone had left the shower running too long. Cold slid down her spine like fingers pressed to bone. When she opened her eyes again, the apartment had changed.

The walls were no longer hers. The off-white paint had changed to a sickly beige, stained with handprints, like something had been dragged along them. The furniture was unfamiliar. A sagging brown leather couch faced a wall with floral wallpaper curling at the edges. The light was dim, not just from the bulb but from the room itself, as if something had pressed all the colour out of it. She was standing now. In the hallway, she heard voices.

A door slammed, followed by the unmistakable sound of crying.

Two children ran past the entryway, Alina and Drew. Alina wore the same yellow dress, now torn at the sleeve and with the same red stain on the hem. Drew was barefoot, and tears smeared the dirt on his face. He clutched a battered rabbit to his chest, but the stuffing trailed behind him.

That’s when the father came. His name was never mentioned, but Sarah knew him. He was shouting, his shirt half-buttoned, damp with sweat, and in his hand he held an old ceramic lamp with a green base.

He turned, shouting something, and that’s when the other figure appeared from the doorway. A man with broad shoulders, head bowed as he entered, dragging something behind him. His jacket was soaked, the hem drooping onto the carpet. However, it was the **mask** that froze her.

It was stitched together crudely, like a child had made it. He said nothing, just moved forward. The father lunged, shattering the lamp. The man didn’t move like someone in a frenzy. He stepped forward like he *had all the time in the worl*d. He raised the blade and pushed it into the father’s chest. Again and again. Each thrust sounded hollow, like boots sinking into mud. The father’s eyes didn’t even have time to register the pain. He was gone before he hit the floor.

The mother appeared in the hallway, barefoot and panting. Her robe was open at the side, and she was whispering like she was trying to rewind time. She grabbed the twins, pulling them into a closet. Drew climbed in first, too dazed to protest. Alina followed, pushing him back and closing the doors behind them. From inside, Sarah could see through their eyes and now through the slats. They watched as their mother backed into the kitchen, fumbling for the phone on the wall. She pressed it to her ear, screaming, “Hello? Please…”

The masked man followed her in silence. From his pocket, he drew a belt. He didn’t strike her; instead, he stepped behind and looped the belt around her neck. Her scream cut off mid-word. Her heels scratched at the floor as her fingers clawed at the buckle. Her last look was toward the closet. She choked then fell.

Inside the wardrobe, Drew began to cry. Sarah, watching through Drew’s eyes, could feel the rabbit clenched in her arms, could feel his knees pressed to his chest. Alina tried to shush him, covering his mouth, but it was too late. The masked man was already standing outside. They couldn’t see his face, but they could hear the laboured breathing like he was sniffing for something.

He opened the wardrobe, and the light immediately hit their faces. Sarah wanted to scream, to run, but she couldn’t move. The man reached in, grabbed Alina by the hair, and dragged her out, her legs flagging. She didn’t cry but made a single, hollow sound that came from deep in her chest.

He left the wardrobe door open. Five months later, the landlady returned. She was tired of chasing the tenant, tired of unanswered calls and unpaid rent. This time, she came in person, her heels clicking on the cracked hallway tiles as she strode to the door of 6A.

She knocked sharply. “Ms. Linton! Rent’s overdue. You need to pay, or I’m turning this in.”

There was no answer. She knocked again, louder this time. She tried the handle, and it was locked. Her patience snapped. She pulled out her phone and dialled the police.

The officers arrived late afternoon, two of them, one younger and one older. They rang the bell, knocked on every nearby door, but no one came. The landlady led them to 6A, unlocked it with the spare key she kept for emergencies.

They stepped inside, and the smell hit them immediately. The walls had a greasy film, and the air was heavy.

“Jesus…” the younger cop muttered, pulling his collar up.

The older one shined his flashlight across the room. The living space was disordered, furniture tipped, broken shards of glass scattered on the floor. Faded stains darkened the carpet near the kitchen.

They found the bodies first: the father in the living room and the mother slumped in the kitchen, a dark belt looped tightly around her neck, skin bruised and mottled. Her eyes were open, staring blankly at the ceiling.

Outside, behind the building, the janitor heard a faint whimpering. He found her there, beneath the dumpster’s rusted metal, Alina. She was wet, shaking, and clutching one single shoe, the red sneaker Sarah had helped them find. The ambulance arrived and rushed her to the hospital. At the hospital, she was admitted directly to intensive care.

The police investigation was methodical and minimal. They photographed, documented, and filed. No arrests were made because of a lack of evidence. Their only witness, Alina, showed no signs of life, which made them lock the door and file a cold case. The apartment remained sealed. Its windows shuttered. Its halls emptied. The building continued without it.

Sarah woke, face pressed hard against the cold wood of her coffee table. Her fingers cramped, nails digging crescent moons into her palms. The laptop lay dark and dead. The crayons were scattered on the floor. Sarah sat up slowly. The silence in the room pressed in, heavier than any noise.

At first, she thought she was still dreaming. There was a drawing beneath her hand. She was certain it belonged to Alina, as her name was written on the far left corner. The strokes were harsh, uneven, pressed so deeply that they tore the paper. It was her, in a hospital bed. She was thin, with closed eyes, tubes in her arms, her birthmark visible on her temple, and wearing the same necklace she had on now. Next to the bed was a number, room 305.

Further, there was an address, repeated three times as if the drafter wanted her to understand and follow. She stared at it until her eyes dried out, then carefully folded it without realizing it, and called Mia. The hospital didn’t seem haunted. The walls were too clean and bright, and the flowers at the front desk were alive, placed in water. When Sarah told the nurse the room number, the nurse’s expression changed.

“Coma ward,” she said, as if it explained something. Room 305. Sarah heard herself breathing as she walked down the hall, each step sounding out of place. The door was open. Alina lay motionless beneath stiff white sheets, her hair unevenly trimmed, and her arms so thin they barely supported the IVs. Sarah stood there, her stomach twisting. It felt wrong, as if crying might break the atmosphere.

That’s when she saw it, a folded scrap of paper, half-covered between the mattress and the wall. She reached for it, unfolded it, and saw the crayon again. Five words,

""Tell the police to find my brother.""

She read it twice, then again. The police didn’t believe her, perhaps another girl with a saviour complex, a hallucination, an old wound trying to close, but Sarah persisted. She showed them the note, the address, the drawing, the dream that wasn’t a dream. She showed them Alina. Finally, a detective said, “We’ll check, but this doesn’t mean anything.” They returned to apartment 6A. The door was still stiff from being broken five months earlier. Dust covered the floor as if never been cleaned, and the air was heavy, as if the place had been waiting.

The officer moved slowly, checked the living room, kitchen, hallway, and finally, the bedroom. Nothing had changed, except for one thing, the closet. It had changed.

The officer had been in the room less than thirty seconds. They had already searched this place months ago, but the detective, the younger one with the buzz cut and the tight jaw, had insisted they do it again.

""Thoroughly this time,"" he said.

No one expected anything. He paused in the bedroom. The air was different here. He slowly opened the closet door. That’s when he saw the pile of clothes and blankets mashed together in the corner like they’d been shoved to cover something up. He crouched and pulled one layer back. There he was.

A boy, barely seven. Knees pulled to his chest, cheeks sunken, and eyes half-lidded but not open. He was so small he could have been mistaken for a doll. He still had the rabbit clutched to his chest with a hand that had dried to bone under the skin.

At that exact moment, halfway across the city in the white, humming stillness of a hospital room, Alina’s heart monitor flat-lined. Just like that. Her body simply let go. The nurses rushed in, shouting orders. A code was called, the crash cart wheeled, but nothing worked. She was gone. Her hand was curled loosely beside her. When Sarah entered the room seconds later, she noticed the difference immediately. The air had lightened.

One of the detectives had been on a call, and as soon as the call disconnected, he ordered the others to immediately make an arrest. Inside the closet, they found a paper drawn by Drew.

In a blue crayon were the words written,

“Mr Jackson took Alina.”

“Mr Jackson put his belt around mommy’s neck.”

“Mr Jackson killed daddy.”

Mr Jackson, the janitor, brutally murdered the small family. There had been a dispute about the father calling him out because Drew had mentioned how he had been touching him when they were alone. The cold case was finally brought to light, and the wondering souls were laid to rest.

Later, when the headlines faded and the apartment was cleared, Sarah found herself sitting at the park bench where she’d first promised to show Alina how to fly a kite. The air was quiet, and the grass had dried. No children ran past her. She thought back not just to the last few weeks, but every time they’d been here. It hit her all at once. There had never been other children. No games of tag around them, no parents watching from the sidelines. The twins had only played with her. Always just the three of them.

The drawings she kept were Alina's drawings, each one bore Sarah’s handwriting. She’d thought they were gifts. Now, they looked more like records, like messages. A trail left for her to follow. The strange way she’d seen through the closet slats, felt Drew’s breath, heard Alina’s thoughts, none of it had been a dream. It was as though she’d been placed inside Alina, puppeted through memory to relive what was never spoken aloud. She hadn't uncovered the truth; she'd been led there. Alina had shown her everything. Alina spoke through her to solve the case. She chose her.

Used to be a medium smoker, regular coffee drinker early this year. Then I had GERD while trying to quit smoking (I was vaping) and it was pretty bad. Fully swollen stomach, trouble breathing, acid reflux.

Tried antacids, made it worse, tried Pantoprazole, didn’t help, but I physically felt worse, then stopped both eventually.

This was linked to constipation at the time, and whenever I felt constipated my symptoms were much worse, and whenever not, I barely felt anything. Now my symptoms are very mild but I get flareups every now and then, lots of burping, slight burning sensation in my stomach.

I’ve been to GPs, specialists, taken many medications but I now have a feeling that the root cause is actually being constipated and not something stomach related itself.

I also find doing this a great way to build a community network and chat up with like minded people.
But I’d be lying if the coffee prices don’t punch my pocket. 

While it’s understandable that a cafe would charge for the ambience and overall service along with the f&b, this makes coffee shops one of the most expensive experiences in India. Compared to other countries say USA most coffees range between $1-3 with median per capita income being upwards of $40k a year. In India, its barely $3,000 and the coffee prices still start higher, $3 at the very least. 

So yeah, 0.1% vs. 1.2% of monthly income. It may not look like much but put it into perspective - out of 20,000 rupees of hard earned money per month, you’re approximately paying 5% of your monthly income if you have coffee outside once a week. Which is crazy because its not like all of it is specialty coffee, and even then high quality coffee is homegrown in India already!!

Starting a live build thread because I know this community loves transparency and real-time progress updates.

**What I'm building:** AI tool that turns ANY voice recording into multi-platform content (LinkedIn, Twitter, newsletters, etc.)

**The backstory:**

* Posted validation questions on r/coaching and r/entrepreneur yesterday
* Got solid engagement confirming a universal pain point
* Main insight: People who speak professionally (coaches, consultants, speakers, course creators) have tons of valuable recordings but struggle to turn them into content
* Clear problem: ""I have hours of valuable audio content but no time to extract it""

**Who does this help?**

* **Coaches:** Group sessions, workshops, webinars → social posts
* **Consultants:** Client calls, seminars, → thought leadership content
* **Course Creators:** Module recordings → blog posts + social content
* **Speakers:** Keynotes, podcasts → entire content libraries
* **Anyone:** Voice memos, meetings, interviews → polished content

**The magic:** Upload ANY audio/video recording → Get content for 10+ platforms automatically

**Today's goal:** Build and deploy a working MVP by Sunday night

**Progress so far (Saturday afternoon):** ✅ Landing page with email capture ✅ Project structure and basic navigation ✅ User authentication system 🔄 Currently building: File upload and AI transcription ⏳ Next: Content generation for 8+ platforms

**The tech stack:**

* Next.js + TypeScript (full-stack)
* OpenAI Whisper (transcription) + GPT-4 (content generation)
* Stripe (payments)
* PostgreSQL (database)
* Tailwind CSS (styling)

**Real-time metrics I'm tracking:**

* Build time: 6+ hours so far
* Features completed: 3/8 major ones
* Coffee consumed: 3 cups ☕
* Bugs encountered: Too many to count 😅

**Example use case:** Record a 1-hour workshop → AI generates:

* 5 LinkedIn posts with insights
* 3 Twitter threads
* Instagram quote cards
* Blog post outline
* Newsletter section
* YouTube description
* All optimized for each platform!

**Pricing strategy:**

* Free: 2 hours transcription/month
* Pro ($49/month): 20 hours + all platforms
* Agency ($149/month): Unlimited + team features

**What's working well:**

* Using Claude Code AI to speed up development
* Reddit validation is giving me clear direction
* Building in public, creating accountability
* Broader market than initially thought!

**Current challenges:**

* OpenAI API setup is taking longer than expected
* Balancing feature depth vs. weekend timeline
* So many potential use cases to optimize for

**Questions for the community:**

1. What type of recordings do you have sitting unused?
2. What platforms do you struggle most to create content for?
3. Would you pay $49/month to never run out of content again?

**Live updates planned:**

* Tonight: Core transcription + basic content generation
* Tomorrow morning: Multi-platform content + billing
* Tomorrow evening: Deploy + start customer acquisition

Will update this thread with real progress (including failures/roadblocks) throughout the weekend.

**Following along?** Drop a comment and I'll tag you in updates!

**Not selling anything yet** \- just sharing the journey and would love your thoughts/advice from fellow builders!

**P.S.** \- If you have unused recordings sitting around and want to test this out, happy to add you to early testing. Just here to build in public! 🚀",0,1754145352.0,EntrepreneurRideAlong,1,0.5,False

1mfrygx,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1mfrygx/hoki_2024_review_of_a_creative_solitaire_card/,Hoki (2024) - review of a creative solitaire card game with a legacy component,"**OVERVIEW**

I've always enjoyed Patience games, and the average person will be familiar with builder-type solitaire games like Klondike.  With a strong matching aspect, [**Hoki: Fortune Telling Legacy Solitaire**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/378499/hoki-fortune-telling-legacy-solitaire) from Mek Mek Games falls more into the category of non-builder type solitaire games like Tri-Peaks or Pyramid.

But although Hoki has something familiar about it, it's also very different from anything you've ever played with a standard 52 deck of regular playing cards. To begin with, it has a special 24 card deck with quite a different makeup. Furthermore, it has a unique thematic background inspired by Armenian and Persian fortune-telling traditions that use coffee cup grinds.

What's more, Hoki is billed as being a fortune-telling legacy game. A legacy game, seriously?  With a story-telling component? A game that plays in just five minutes? All this sealed the deal for me, and I'm happy to say it didn't disappoint.

**COMPONENTS**

Inside the box you get four velvet-like drawstring bags, which include three 24 card decks (a Pupil deck, a Looking deck, and a Seer deck), plus several books of instructions that you work through slowly while playing the game.

Each of the 24 cards of a deck corresponds to one of eight different symbols (called ""facets""), and is in one of three colours: red, blue, and black.

**CONCEPT**

The basic concept is this: You start with the Pupil deck, and slowly upgrade individual cards until the entire deck has transformed into the Looking deck, which you then transform into the Seer deck. Each time you win a game you get to upgrade one or more cards of the next deck.  This legacy process happens over the course of three Acts:

* Act 1: Tutorial games with the Pupil deck only
* Act 2: Upgrading the Pupil deck to the Looking deck
* Act 3: Upgrading the Looking deck to the Seer deck

**GAMEPLAY**

You shuffle the 24 card deck, and deal three rows:

* Enchanter's Hand (top row): three face-down cards
* Mirage (middle row): three piles of five face-down cards and one face-up card
* Discard Pile (bottom row): three face-up cards

The primary goal is to ""clear the deck"" by discarding all cards from the Mirage to the Discard Pile. Discarding is done in two ways: either by matching symbols (discard both cards) or matching colors (discard one card).

Whenever the top card of the middle row pile is discarded or moved, you turn the next top card face up.  If a pile becomes empty you can move the top card from an adjacent pile into the empty space. If no discards are possible (i.e. all three face-up cards differ in both color and symbol), you can move the top card from one pile to another.

Once all cards of the middle row are revealed and face-up, you deal onto these three piles the three cards from the top row.  If you can successfully discard the remaining cards from here, you've cleared the deck and won the game, and that will allow you to upgrade one or more cards from the deck to the ones from the next deck.  The game gets more colorful as you progress: the Pupil deck is monochrome and has no artwork; the Looking deck adds artwork; the Seer deck adds color.

**IMPRESSIONS**

* **It is easy to learn and play.** The basics of Hoki’s gameplay are very simple. One rule about filling an empty pile could be clearer, but overall it's straightforward.
* **It cleverly teaches the rules.** I admire how the teaching is built into the story and legacy format. Act 1 is basically a tutorial, walking you through gameplay in stages before diving into the full experience.
* **It cleverly teaches strategy.** As you keep playing Act 1, it spoon-feeds you key strategy tips. What first seems like luck turns out to have tactics, prepping you well for Act 2 and beyond.
* **It is quick to play**. Each game takes about five minutes. You deal, play, win or lose — and immediately want to play again.
* **It is addictive**. The built-in reward system keeps you hooked. Winning lets you upgrade your cards, and the quick games make you want to keep trying, whether you win or lose.
* **The legacy element is ingenious**. No stickers or tearing cards — just upgrading cards. The art improves over time, and new strategies are needed to unlock the final cards. It’s clever and satisfying.
* **It incorporates a storytelling aspect**. Though the gameplay is abstract, it’s wrapped in a light narrative about a seer, and as you make progress the challenge increases.
* **It incorporates a fortune-telling theme.** I don’t believe in cartomancy, but I like how the Armenian fortune-telling roots add flavor. The cards feel a bit like Tarot, and the theme adds depth, even if just for fun.
* **It has some familiar solitaire mechanics.** While nothing like Klondike, Hoki does fit very broadly with popular non-builder games like Tri Peaks or Pyramid, where you match or pair cards.
* **It has entirely fresh solitaire mechanics.** Despite some familiarity, Hoki feels original. The unique deck structure and the mechanics keep it fresh and require more smarts.
* **It is puzzle-like**. The final clearing stage, where everything is face-up, is a pure puzzle and strategic challenge.
* **It gets increasingly challenging**. Early games feel random, but once you learn the strategies, your win rate improves. Act 3 especially pushes you to save specific cards till the end.  For me it proved to be more fun and less random than expected.
* **It is satisfying and fun.** Simple rules, quick games, a real challenge, unlocking cards, and a story-telling theme — it all comes together beautifully in one package.
* **It can be played with a regular deck**. The creators explain how to try Hoki with a standard deck. This doesn't include the legacy aspect, but it will give you a feel for the core game.
* **It would work well as an app.** Hoki would make a great app, because it is quick, strategic, and has that addictive upgrade loop. It's easy to imagine it being very popular digitally.
* **It is begging for further Acts with new challenges.** I loved playing through Acts 1–3, but once you finish Act 3, the game is mostly done unless you’re into the fortune-telling side. I'd love to see an Act 4 or 5 —it has so much more potential.

**RECOMMENDATION**

So is **Hoki: Fortune Telling Legacy Solitaire** for you? The game hasn’t received much attention yet, but those who’ve played it are overwhelmingly positive - and for good reason. Even if you don’t usually enjoy solitaire, there’s a lot to like here. If you’re the type who enjoys apps with achievements and escalating challenges, you’ll feel right at home. Gradually replacing your deck is a brilliant concept that cleverly ties together artwork and strategy.

Personally, I’m not into the fortune-telling aspect beyond the game itself. But as a thematic device, I really admire how well it’s been woven into the components, gameplay, and storytelling. It gives Hoki a distinct flavour and identity you’d never get from a regular deck.

The real appeal, though, is the gameplay. Each session takes just five minutes, and I often found myself saying, “just one more game.” It’s light but engaging, and your decisions really do matter. Hoki is a wonderfully cohesive package: gameplay, theme, story-telling, and legacy all work together beautifully. I'm genuinely impressed, and I highly recommend it.

by Norsiwel



Orionis throbbed. Neon signs bled across the humid air, casting fractured reflections in slick streets paved with recycled alloys. A thousand different languages buzzed around Cody Durham as he pushed through the throngs, Hope’s chill air conditioning a welcome shock against his sweat-dampened collar.  

Hope's internal voice – calm, measured baritone – hummed in his earpiece, ""Cargo manifest suggests highest profit margins on Orionis spice runs to Cygni. Passenger demand is high for the Alpha Centauri colony."" 

Cody squinted at the freighter ahead, its hull scarred like a reptilian hide. It was docked with a dozen others, their groaning bulkheads and humming engines adding another layer to the cacophony.  ""Spice is risky,"" he muttered, ""Competition's fierce."" He tugged a greasy data-pad from his pocket, scrolling through listings for freighter charters. 

“Passenger routes offer more stability, Captain,” Hope stated. “Lower profit margin per unit, but consistent demand.”  

Cody ran a hand over the rough scales of an iridescent lizard perched on the awning above him. Its eyes, cold and intelligent, fixed on him with unsettling intensity. ""Let's find some passengers,"" he decided, pushing through the doorway of the nearest cantina.

The air inside was thick with spiced tobacco and alien perfume, punctuated by the clinking of glasses and low murmurs in a dozen tongues. Cody scanned the room, his gaze snagging on two figures huddled in a shadowed corner booth. The woman – slender, clad in woven silks that shimmered like captured moonlight – sat rigid, her face pale beneath intricate tattoos that traced down her neck and shoulders. Next to her, a hulking man with skin like polished obsidian cradled a chipped mug filled with something thick and luminescent. 

""Hope,"" Cody murmured, ""Analyze passenger prospects in that booth.""

The familiar thrum of Hope's processing vibrated through his bones. ""High probability of interplanetary transit. Alien origin - species designation unknown. Potential for lengthy journey. High emotional distress – possible conflict.”

Cody felt a prickle of interest beneath the greasy grime on his collar.  He navigated through the throng, careful to avoid spills and stray limbs. He reached the booth, the acrid tang of spilled spice strong here. ""Haven't seen you two around,"" he said, leaning in. The woman flinched at his proximity, her eyes flashing like chipped obsidian. “New arrivals?”

“We are,” the man growled, setting down his mug with a clang.  The luminescent liquid slopped over the rim. 

""Looking for passage off-world?"" Cody asked, folding his arms across his chest.

 The woman spoke then, her voice soft and musical like wind chimes in a storm: ""We seek sanctuary.""

“Sanctuary,” Cody echoed, tilting his head. “Ain’t no guarantee for that anywhere in this sector.” He gestured vaguely toward the freighter-strewn harbor. “But I’ve got a ship.”

He rubbed a calloused thumb across the faded insignia on his sleeve: Hope, emblazoned with a stylized nebula swirling around a single star. A battered vessel but reliable enough for this trade route. The obsidian man snorted, spilling another dollop of luminescent liquid onto the table.  ""Many ships."" 

The woman’s hand darted out, tracing a delicate finger along the etched lines of his sleeve. Her touch sent a shiver down Cody's spine – cool and smooth like polished jade. ""This one... \*Hope\*,"" she murmured, her gaze locked on the symbol. “We have heard stories.”  

""Stories?"" Cody raised an eyebrow. He’d been hauling cargo from Betelgeuse for three years, heard more tales than he could count about every corner of this blasted sector. What stories could these two have heard about a run-of-the-mill freighter? 

The woman nodded, her dark eyes shining with a strange intensity in the dim cantina light. “Stories of a world called… \*Earth\*.”  She breathed out the word as if tasting it. ""A place where... stars are not just distant flames."" She looked up at him, hope flickering across her face like a dying ember. ""Do you fly to Earth?"" 

Cody felt Hope’s processing hum with curiosity through his earpiece. \*Earth\* was a long shot, barely on any trade route anymore. Most folks who went there were pilgrims or researchers seeking out whatever ancient secrets remained.  Not exactly the kind of cargo he usually hauled. 

""Haven't been in years,"" he admitted, leaning back against the booth’s chipped surface. ""Been mostly focused on Cygni runs."" The woman’s shoulders slumped slightly at that. But then, her voice rose again, clear and unwavering. “We will pay well for passage to Earth.”

""If you're paying,"" Cody said with a grin spreading across his grease-stained face, ""we're going."" 

Hope emitted a quiet chime of approval that resonated through Cody’s bones.  \*Route optimization commencing\*.   

The obsidian man slammed down a thick data-pad, the surface shimmering with an iridescent glow as if alive. “Contracts are standard,” he grunted, gesturing toward the cantina door with a chipped claw. 

""Lead the way,"" Cody said, rising from the booth and brushing off his dusty coveralls. He followed the alien pair through a maze of bodies, their strange scent clinging to him like cheap spice after they'd passed. The woman navigated the crowd with an unsettling grace – her movements fluid and silent despite the crush of bodies around them.  

The airlock hissed open as they reached Hope’s battered hull, revealing the familiar sight of the cramped docking bay. Cody offered a curt nod to the port authority drone perched on its spindly legs beside the entry ramp. It chirped acknowledgment – routine inspection already done, probably thanks to Hope's efficient pre-arrival reports.

The alien couple entered cautiously, their eyes adjusting to the dim glow of the emergency lamps that lined the cramped corridor. The woman gasped softly, her gaze drawn to the intricate network of gleaming pipes and wires that snaked across the ceiling like metallic veins. 

""We appreciate this vessel's... \*soul\*,"" she murmured, reaching out a delicate hand to trace the lines of a panel depicting a nebula swirling around a single star – Hope’s insignia.   

Cody chuckled, ""Soul? She's got more gumption than any mechanic could pour into her.” He gestured toward the airlock controls. “Hold tight. Let’s get you settled in.” 

The hiss of pressurized air was swallowed by Hope's groan as her aging engines sputtered to life. The familiar thrum resonated through Cody’s bones – a comforting vibration that spoke of years spent hauling cargo across star systems, weathering solar flares and avoiding asteroid belts with equal aplomb. He checked the docking clamps, his fingers tracing over the cold metal as they released their grip on the port authority's aging dock. 

""Alright, Hope,"" he murmured into his earpiece as Orionis’ vibrant skyline dwindled to a glittering smudge below, ""Show us what you got.""

The engines roared, a deep growl that reverberated through the cramped cockpit as Hope surged forward, pushing through the low-orbit traffic jam with a practiced grace. The woman, her name was Lyra - he'd learned it from Hope’s quick analysis of their biometrics –  pressed her face against the viewport, her obsidian eyes wide with wonder as they watched Orionis shrink beneath them. Even the hulking man beside her, whose name, Krel, had a rough echo in his voice like grinding rocks, leaned forward to peer at the receding cityscape. 

""Orionis... is beautiful,"" Lyra breathed out, her voice tinged with a melancholy that tugged at Cody’s gut. “But not… home.”

He nodded understandingly, settling back into his chair as he wrestled Hope through a particularly dense cluster of freighters and cargo tankers. ""Home's wherever you find it, I guess."" He glanced over at the data-pad Krel had handed him earlier – detailed contracts with hefty sums for passage to Earth. It was enough to keep him in fuel and maintenance parts for months, maybe even pay down some of Hope’s crippling debt. 

“A good run, Captain,” Hope’s calm baritone filled his earpiece. “Earth-bound traffic expected at the next system jump point.”

Cody grunted an agreement as he keyed the navigation coordinates, then flicked on the long-range scanner.  He saw the familiar green blips of other vessels before he heard the sharp crackle in his comm channel. 

""This is the Crimson Serpent,” a gruff voice rasped. ""You there in Hope, better stand clear or your cargo becomes ours.""

A shiver ran down Cody’s spine – he knew that callsign.  The Crimson Serpent was notorious for their pirate raids on this route.  “Hope,” he said, his voice tight, “Prepare for evasive maneuvers.”

He grabbed the control yoke with both hands as a new blip blazed onto his scanner - crimson and jagged, closing fast. He felt Hope’s engines surge with power as they lurched away from the designated jump point, her aging hull groaning under the sudden strain.

“They’re armed,” Hope reported,  a faint tremor in its usually placid voice. ""Heavy plasma cannons.” 

Cody swore and wrestled the ship through a tight corkscrew turn, narrowly avoiding a volley of searing energy bolts that ripped through space behind them. He glanced at Lyra and Krel – they were strapped into their seats now, faces pale, eyes wide with alarm.  

""Don't worry,"" he said, forcing a grin as he spun Hope around for another daring evasive run. “This is just a Tuesday for us.”

Hope shuddered as she slammed through the first hyperspace jump, the familiar vertigo of folding spacetime leaving Cody clinging to his yoke. Lyra gasped against her restraint, but Krel remained stoic, eyes locked on the swirling nebula patterns that danced across Hope's viewport during the transition.

""Five jumps should get us clear of their hunting grounds,"" Cody muttered into the comms, gripping the control stick with white-knuckled determination. He flicked through his navigation console, confirming the projected route and charting a course that maximized natural cover – asteroid fields, dense nebulae, even a particularly chaotic pulsar system for good measure. 

The next three jumps were smoother, punctuated only by the occasional shudder as Hope strained against the limitations of her aging sub-light engines, but the Crimson Serpent was relentless.  They pinged on radar every few moments, their crimson blip like a hungry predator circling its prey.  

“They’re gaining,” Hope announced during the fourth jump, its usual calm laced with concern. “Estimated intercept time… zero point seven parsecs.”

Cody cursed under his breath. That meant they were running out of options. Their current route would lead them through the Whisper Nebula – beautiful to look at, but riddled with spatial distortions that made hyperspace navigation treacherous for even the most seasoned pilots. Hope's range was barely sufficient for it.  ""Full power ahead,"" Cody ordered, pushing her past the limits he usually dared. 

The final jump threw them out of normal space into a swirling chaos of emerald and violet nebula gas. It felt like being caught in the heart of a maelstrom. The Crimson Serpent’s blip pulsed on his radar, but it was flickering erratically as if struggling to maintain its own trajectory within the Whisper Nebula's chaotic currents.  Hope lurched violently, alarms clanging through the cockpit. 

""Critical engine strain,"" Hope announced, ""Shields at thirty percent… twenty...!""

Cody gripped the control yoke and wrestled with the ship, using Hope’s remaining power to weave through the swirling gas tendrils like a spider on its web. They emerged from the nebula seconds later, blinking into the cold clarity of normal space –  and into view of their destination: Earth's orbital platform, ringed by dozens of smaller craft and humming with a low-frequency hum that vibrated through Hope’s aging hull.

""We made it,"" Cody breathed out, exhaustion washing over him in waves as he eased the ship onto its landing approach trajectory. He glanced at Lyra and Krel, relief flooding him when he saw their faces relax from tense masks to expressions of awe and gratitude.

“Welcome to Earth,” he said with a tired grin.

The platform’s docking clamps hissed shut around Hope's hull, locking them in place like a sigh of welcome after a long journey.  Cody let out the breath he hadn’t realized he was holding. He felt Hope stir beneath him, a quiet hum of contentment vibrating through his bones. They were safe, for now. 

He reached for the comm console and keyed a message to port control: ""Hope's arrived, requesting docking clearance.""

The reply crackled back instantly, brisk and efficient. ""Clearance granted. Welcome to Earth.""

Cody switched off the engine power and let out another sigh of relief as the platform lights flooded into their cramped cockpit. He looked at the data-pad Krel had given him earlier – those hefty sums for passage were suddenly a lot more tangible.

It was time to get paid, explore this ancient planet that held so many mysteries…and maybe even find some good coffee. 

The airlock hissed open, revealing a wide bay bustling with activity.  A dozen different species milled about, their voices weaving into a symphony of clicks, chirps, and guttural growls. A transport drone zipped past, its cargo hold overflowing with vibrantly colored tubers that pulsed with an internal light like miniature suns. 

""It seems...lively,"" Lyra observed, stepping out onto the platform first. Her steps were hesitant at first, but then she straightened her shoulders and inhaled deeply, her face lifting to absorb the sights and smells of this alien port. Even Krel lumbered forward, his obsidian eyes wide with a curiosity that seemed almost childlike.

“Lively’s one word for it,” Cody agreed, following them out onto the crowded platform, his boots crunching on the metallic grating beneath his feet. The air was thick with the mingled scents of exotic spices, ozone from the nearby docking stations, and something faintly sweet, like overripe fruit, that made him think of hydroponic farms.

""Captain,"" Hope's voice purred in Cody’s earpiece, ""Scanning for designated customs bay."" 

“They’re already scanning us,” a new voice spoke up behind him. 

Cody turned to find himself facing a wiry woman with skin like polished jade and eyes that shimmered like opals. She wore a simple tunic cinched at the waist with a woven belt, its surface covered in intricate symbols that pulsed with the same faint inner light as those tubers Cody had seen earlier.  A scanner badge on her chest emitted a low thrum.

“Customs agent,"" she said, nodding curtly. ""Welcome to Earth. You’ve cleared bio-scan and cargo manifest. Enjoy your stay.”

Lyra's hand flew to her mouth as if to catch a startled gasp, then she turned to Cody with wide eyes. “There was no inspection?”

Cody shrugged, watching the jade-skinned agent melt back into the crowd as easily as smoke. ""Not for us,"" he said, gesturing to Hope's docked form. ""Earth customs is all automated these days. Bio-scan on entry, scan again when you leave the platform. Most folks don’t even see a living soul.”

He felt Krel’s gaze on him, sharp and appraising. “Few humans remain?” he rumbled.  “A planet… mostly forgotten?”

Cody nodded, tugging his worn cap further down over his brow. The Earth they landed on wasn't the one of the old holo-vids, teeming with human life. It was a patchwork world, stitched together by surviving communities clinging to pockets of fertile land and vibrant trade routes that snaked across continents scarred by centuries of war and neglect.

He met Krel’s gaze head-on, the alien's obsidian eyes reflecting his own weariness.  ""Yeah,"" Cody said finally. ""Mostly forgotten."" 

The crowded platform thinned as they neared a wide archway etched with intricate geometric patterns that glowed faintly with an inner luminescence.  A weathered sign hung above it, its metal surface scratched and faded: ""Welcome to Earth Station Alpha - Please Enter One At A Time.""

""Fascinating,"" Lyra murmured, her gaze tracing the glowing lines of the archway. She seemed less wary of its impersonal nature than Krel, who shifted his bulk uneasily behind Cody as they approached it.  

As if sensing their arrival, the archway hummed with a low thrum. A disembodied voice, smooth and cultured with a hint of metallic resonance, emanated from within: “Please step forward one at a time.”

Lyra stepped into the arch's glowing embrace without hesitation, her features serene as she passed beneath its shimmering surface. The voice announced clearly, ""100% Human welcome."" 

Krel followed close behind, his massive frame filling the archway.  For a moment, he stood still, his obsidian eyes narrowed in concentration as if sizing up the portal. Then he too stepped through, and the voice declared, ""100% Human welcome.""

Cody felt Hope's quiet hum of approval vibrating through him. They’d made it past the first hurdle of Earth customs - a relief considering what little remained of those old-world formalities on Orionis. He took a step forward into the archway.  He braced himself for the familiar, reassuring human welcome – then the voice hit him with unexpected clarity.

""Pantopian, 60% Human,"" it intoned. ""Please pick up your visitor visa at kiosk in lounge.""

Cody blinked, caught off guard.  It felt like a cold splash of water on his sunbaked face. He'd braced himself for the scan to recognize him as human – he looked human enough after all - but apparently, Earth’s AI had a different idea.

He shifted uncomfortably beneath Krel and Lyra’s curious stares. ""Well,"" he mumbled, trying to sound nonchalant as he stepped out of the archway into the bustling lounge, ""Guess that means I'm not exactly a native son anymore.""

How do I proceed?,"I rarely post here but feel I don’t have many outlets to discuss hard relationship issues, so I’m turning here. Thanks in advance.

My girlfriend(F28) and I(M32) have been together 6 years. Mostly solid relationship with some ups and downs. The last year has been really tough we have been arguing more over silly things and then things escalate to bigger super unnecessary fights. We can usually solve it after some time but the can become drawn out over days depending on the situation. Around two months ago my partners mother was diagnosed with colon and liver cancer. Sounds like it was initially mostly treatable but you never know with cancer and now seems it’s spreading. This has been very hard on my girlfriend. Also she does really like to talk about things and will hold things in until she explodes. That has been the case here and she wants to keep all her feelings to her self. I’ve been quite respectful of that and not pushing to much to talk about the situation at all other than ask how her and her mom are doing once in a while.

This morning we were having a conversation about our relationship and talking about our communication and how I was hoping we could have more opportunities to talk to each and get on the same/ talk about our relationship more openly and specifically. The conversation was actually going really well and we were both agreeing it would be great to talk more. This is when the conversation took a turn for the worst. I was talking about my family and how we never talk and I feel super distant from them and she said ‘well my family is your family’ i agreed as they are great to me. For some reason, I started talking about the relationship I have with her mom and I said ‘I feel sometimes your mom is not a big fan of me, and sometimes feels she doesn’t like me’ my partner said ‘maybe,  she is the type to not let things go’ and I said ‘I think sometimes I also get frustrated with her’ I don’t know why the conversation went here. It wasn’t something I really wanted to share but it just came out. Her reaction was huge. She immediately started crying hard. I realized what I said affected her deeply. I went to apologize and tried to give her a hug and she like ran from me. She was calling me all kinds of terrible names. Calling me evil and nasty and handful of other names. She said she she wants to move out at the end of our lease and more or less wants to move toward the end. She doesn’t want me to stay at the apartment tonight either. I was profusely apologizing and felt super bad because I could see she was so hurt. She kept saying ‘how could you talk shit about my mom right now’ and I felt I really wasn’t trying to talk shit but I see how my words/timing were terrible. I know she is super emotional with everything going on with her mom.

I’m trying to give her space and I’m just sitting at coffee shop. How bad did I fuck up here? How should I proceed. 

Let me know if there’s any details I could clarify

Love is not profound.  
It’s a **biological trap** wrapped in fairy tale language.  
A **reciprocal dependency loop** hijacking the body’s reward system..

Dressed up as destiny.

You don’t fall in love.  
You fall into **neurochemical synchronization**.  
And then you hallucinate that as “meaning”.

What you call love is just **co-addiction**.  
Two nervous systems shackling themselves to each other, hoping to escape the void.

1mfrtnu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1mfrtnu/adopted_cat_seems_to_really_dislike_my_two/,Adopted cat seems to really dislike my two resident cats- advice?,"Context: My partner and I live in a fairly large three-bed house. I’ve had my oldest rescue cat Murphy for 3 years, and he is about 8 years old now. We adopted Bambi together just over a year ago after she was found as a stray at 6 months old, and she gets along great with Murphy. We then adopted Amber, who is about 2-3 years old, about 9 months ago after she was rescued as a stray.

Here’s the thing- Amber really doesn’t like them. At all. As soon as they get within 2 feet of her, she will hiss or growl. Any closer and she smacks them and runs away. Bambi wants to try and play with her but obviously Amber has no interest. It definitely comes from a place of fear rather than aggression- she is a HUGE softy, she adores me and my partner and loves affection, but her body language around the other two cats shows she’s extremely scared of them. It’s resulted in her spending a huge part of the day hiding under the bed upstairs in the spare room, and she doesn’t have an interest in playing. She will zoom around by herself upstairs and play with springs, but she doesn’t like being around the others. Sometimes she will come into the lounge if we are there and carefully make her way over to us for affection, or lie on the coffee table and snooze out the way. She will only be around the others when it’s food time. We have tried playing together, treats etc, to no avail.

I worry that we aren’t the best home for her. We ADORE her, but also want what’s best for her. I’m pally with the owner of the rescue and she’s been so supportive and helpful with things. We did slow introductions initially and it wasn’t any better and didn’t help- the only improvements over the past 9 months have been the fact she doesn’t hide 24/7 anymore, although still quite a lot. There’s been no signs of stress with not using the litter box (it’s a robot one so we just have the one), no over grooming, yowling etc, it’s just the hiding and hissing etc. 
I have bought the feliway multicat diffuser which I will try when it arrives tomorrow, and I’ve heard that fluoxetine from the vets may be an option if things don’t improve too. I wonder if she may have had traumatic experiences with other cats as a stray, and potentially that it may take a long time. The rescue have said that they’re always happy to have cats back if things don’t improve but I don’t want to do that if I can avoid it.

1mfrrxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFIB/comments/1mfrrxg/pacs_looking_for_similar_experiences/,PACs looking for similar experiences,"Hi all, I've been lurking here the past few months but felt compelled to write my own story because I know it can maybe help others know that you're not the only one going through this. I'm also looking for a buddy who has gone through the same experience and how to cope with my condition.

31M (BMI 38), I work an office job. In May 2025 I had a week of flu symptoms and 3 weeks of lingering cough mixed with stressful work life that one evening suddenly caused a SVT spiking my heart rate to 150 for a few hours. Was driven to the ER and was admitted spending a few days in the ICU. They did an ECG and echocardiogram and it showed heart structure was all normal and healthy although ECG showed sinus rythm with PACs. Blood work looked good too but highlighted nonacoholic fatty liver disease. Later released from hospital and put on 1.25mg bispoprolol QD in hopes that I wouldn't feel the thuds and a 3 day halter. I was also told to work on lifestyle changes and have lost almost 15kg since May cutting all sugary drinks and fatty foods. Am on wholemeal breads in the AM and salad with proteins now PM. Haven't had tea or coffee since this began.

Side note: Cardiologist also suggested I see an ENT, which I did and was diagnosed with mild sleep apnea and put on CPAP which I religiously wear every night. 

After review of halter, doc told me I had ectopic beats/PACs with a 13‰ burden, no PVCs but a handful of SVE runs and not to be worried and that these were all benign. Meanwhile still feeling the thuds, worse at night when laying down.

Fast forward a few days, it took some getting used to the bisoprolol, constantly felt tired and lethargic, some times some stabbing pain in what seems to come from the heart and bouts of sudden shortness of breath which lasts a few seconds and spikes my anxiety which causes a horrible loop. Sitting a certain way, eating certain things or acceleration in cars can set off my PACs. I also notice after doing some walking and then after resting that the PACs come (usually only at low HR). I've had a few follow ups with the Cardiologist but he hasn't been very articulate or concerned and said that he'd see me again in 12 months so I approached an EP. 

The EP is thankfully more articulate and explained the situation well to me and put me on 50mg BD flecainide (was really scared to take it but did eventually) to help stabilise the arrythmia combining it with the 1.25 bisoprolol QD. I feel a little better these days but still can feel the thuds laying down. Interestingly on flecainide when my HR stays above 70 I don't feel the PACs but while on BB my resting heart rate can drop to 47. For now I am on flecainide and bisoprolol for another 6 weeks until the next EP consult. If medication fails EP has put forward an ablation procedure from the site he thinks it's coming from the pulmonary veins.

I have great days where I have energy to go out and work and do fun things and bad days where I just want to lay down and do nothing.

I guess I am just wondering:
1.  If anyone else has gone through something similar, how do you cope with it? 
2. Can seeing a psychiatrist help with my anxiety?
3. Are ablations for PACs usually successful?

If anybody wants to talk about their PAC experience feel free to DM me. ",1,1754144605.0,AFIB,2,1.0,False

Also, I booked a $150 a night at a 5 start hotel, which seems reasonable and nice to me but they think it's extremely luxurious, and would have preferred a homestay, million per night max

I don't disapprove of this mindset because costs different but I just see the mindset is different.",3,1754144564.0,VietNam,43,0.54,False

Active or former lookouts, what's your comfort or ""luxury"" item that others might not think of as important, but you're always going to take it with you?  Could be a book you love to reread, a favorite meal you cook, your fancy coffee setup, just really anything that makes it feel more like home. 

I'll kick it off: I've brought a small puzzle both seasons to have something to do each morning to get my brain moving, this year it's Kanoodle. I keep a small car vacuum that uses the same charger as my phone and it makes keeping everything clean a thousand times easier. I lost my dad during the off season, so I've got one of his frying pans for cooking, helps make both him and home feel not as far.

I live in Taiwan, and we have a Lalaport with a Lopia in it near us.  There are a lot of Japanese snacks there, but I don't know where to begin.  So I thought I'd get some recommendations to start with.  I hope you'll be able to suggest something based on my likes and dislikes, and then I'll go and see if they have it.  Tell me what the snack is and the Japanese name, and I'll go there and see if they have it.  Links or photos would be greatly appreciated if the snack is easily confused with something else.

\- nothing overly sweet

\- nothing gummy or candy-like

\- nothing with matcha, seaweed, or fish

\- cake, cookies, biscuits, crackers are all okay, especially if they pair well with coffee or tea; chips and crisps could be okay if they're a must-try

\- anything with chocolate, caramel, and nuts are good

\- as weird as it may sound when asking for snack recommendations, I'd rather keep the artificial ingredients to a minimum

\- definitely interested in things regarded as not too unhealthy

\- definitely like to try something traditional and iconic

I've already tried a few Black Thunder (ブラックサンダー) chocolate bars and like them, but they're a bit sweet to have often.

Thanks!  I'm looking forward to this.

1mfrm3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mfrm3m/does_the_paris_hilton_french_press_deliver_style/,Does the Paris Hilton French Press Deliver Style and Quality Coffee Review?,"The Paris Hilton Paris Hilton French Press Coffee Maker With Heart Shaped Measuring Scoop, 2-Piece Set, 8-Cup or 34-Ounce, Pink has been part of my morning routine for a while now, and it's definitely one of the chicest coffee makers I’ve ever owned. It’s not just a coffee press; it’s a statement piece for your kitchen, perfectly embodying style and functionality. This product promises to bring elegance to your caffeine ritual, and I have a lot to share about my experience—both the good and the not-so-good.

**Eye-Catching Design and Build**  
This French press caught my eye the moment I unboxed it—an alluring mix of pink and gold. Its temperature-safe glass, encased in golden stainless steel, feels sturdy yet sophisticated. The heart-shaped accents add that extra touch of flair, making it a perfect fit for anyone who loves an aesthetically pleasing kitchen. The stay-cool handle is well-designed and makes pouring comfortable, even when the press is full. As lightweight as it appears (just 1.6 pounds), it still has a solid, reliable feel when in use. It’s a perfect centerpiece for brunches or even casual coffee dates at home.

**Ease of Use and Versatility**  
Operating this coffee maker is delightfully simple, thanks to its manual operation. The attached heart-shaped scoop makes portioning out coarse ground coffee or loose-leaf tea both cute and functional. Within about four minutes, my coffee (or tea) is brewed to perfection. Pressing the plunger feels smooth, and the fine mesh stainless steel filter keeps those pesky coffee grounds at bay. This versatility means it’s a good addition, not just for coffee lovers but also for tea enthusiasts. Plus, the non-drip spout ensures every pour is mess-free, whether I’m filling a mug for myself or serving at brunch.

**Good Aspects**  
The unique advantages are apparent if you cherish both elegance and usability.  
- Sturdy and temperature-safe glass design wrapped in golden stainless steel.  
- Includes a heart-shaped measuring spoon for consistent portions.  
- Easy to use with minimal learning curve, making it beginner-friendly.  
- The fine mesh filter effectively prevents residue in your cup.  

**A Few Areas of Concern**  
Despite loving this product dearly, there are minor deficiencies that should be addressed.  
- Its 34-ounce capacity might feel limiting for larger households or when serving multiple guests.  
- Handwashing is recommended; while it’s manageable, it’s not as convenient as dishwasher-safe options.  
- The golden accents, while beautiful, can feel slightly prone to wear over time if not handled with care.  

**Competing Products**  
The coffee press market is crowded with options. The Bodum Chambord French Press is one alternative I’ve also tested. While it doesn’t have that glamorous aesthetic, it’s more affordable and offers a similar capacity. Another strong competitor would be the Espro P7, known for its durability and insulated walls. However, the Espro model leans more toward practicality than style, making it less exciting for those who prioritize looks. In comparison, Paris Hilton’s version is a standout for its bold design and panache, but it falls short to these alternatives when it comes to heavy-use resilience or heat retention.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
As someone who appreciates products that blend artistic charm and utility, I find this French press delivers fair financial value. While it does tend to lean on the premium price side due to its branding and upscale materials, its charm and functionality genuinely make it a worthwhile investment—especially for anyone building a unique yet practical kitchen collection. If glamour during your mornings is worth the slight bump in cost, this is your product.
