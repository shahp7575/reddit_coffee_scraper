My husband has dementia and I wasn’t able to set up our portable generator without asking a neighbor for help. He was a saint…stopping what he was doing and using almost two hours of his own prep time to make sure our refrigerator and coffee pot worked when the power went out. Which it did for 11 hours. Some people in our area have been without power for three days, and their estimated power restore date is October 17. 

I made up my mind that we won’t be a burden to anyone when the next storm hits. I’m considering purchasing a Generac generator for the whole house, but the reviews on newer models aren’t favorable, even when people do the required maintenance. 

Does anyone have thoughts and suggestions to share? Maybe another brand besides Generac? I know these units aren’t cheap, but I’m willing to put a price on aggravation to make life less stressful during hurricanes and power outages. ",1,1728799914.0,HomeImprovement,0,1.0,False

1g2j7eq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Empaths/comments/1g2j7eq/am_i_an_empath_or_just_weird/,Am I an empath or just weird?,"For the longest times I’ve kept people that hurt me continuously in my life. I had a best friend who I kept in my life for 20 years because she was my oldest friend and that was the excuse. I always forgave her every single time. 2 years ago she did something inconceivable and it was the last straw for me. But for context, it was years of mental abuse, and often sociopathic behaviour on her end.

More recently, a year ago, I met someone at my old work, and she was lonely, and quiet. No one would talk to her. So I made the effort to take her out, get drinks me, go for coffee, drink wine at her place on several occasions. I ended up switching jobs and realizing we didn’t haven’t anything in common besides work and there just being a huge age gap as well. I think of her every so often, but she texts me a lot, and I don’t want to really hang out with her because we just don’t have much to talk about. But in the beginning I had this insane feeling that I had to be her friend so she wouldn’t be alone. And now I feel like I have to do it forever and can’t break her heart because I know what loneliness is like.

Again, at my current job (not the one where I met the previous person), somebody I knew got fired. She was disabled and had a speech impediment- she tried her absolutely hardest every day, at a certain call centre that is absolutely evil, and they booted her. When I found this out I had those most immense anger and anxiety and frustration that I had to go and ‘save’ her. Obviously she didn’t need me. But I found her phone number, and called her and made sure she was okay. She is and she really appreciated the phone call.

I help people everyday. I open doors, I help people in wheelchairs get up steep curbs, I give cigarettes away, I give money away like it’s nothing. It fills my heart up and makes my day. And I don’t tell people about it, it’s not like I’m doing this for attention. 

But I feel, that it’s gotten too intense. I go out of my way to help people, and I end up so emotional about people that I forget that it might not be my place to seek them out and help them.

Has anyone else had similar experiences? Is this a savior complex thing? Or am I just an empath?

On one specific occasion, she had negative feelings, she identified them as red and green. She had mentioned that there was a door at the front of her heart (whatever that means lol), so I used that in the process. I had her lay on her back, imagining holding a cup of hot coffee. As I rubbed my hand around her, I told her that it was hot as well. I had her imagine that all of this heat was making the red and green turn into steam inside of her. I told her steam rises and that the steam can rise out of the ""door at the front of her heart"" since she was laying on her back, so the door was up. She reported feeling relieved of the feelings as well as the colours. 

Even though I walked her through this process, trying to use her own creative visualisations in this process, I find that I'm not creative enough to come up with visualisations, or walk myself through any of this on my own.

we were young and each other’s first love. we dated late 2018 to early 2020, and has been my longest relationship to this day. it was a very wholesome relationship and we enjoyed each others company, never fought and i always felt myself around him. me and (we’ll call him J) J ended because of distance and him basically cheating (he went on a 3 month trip and kissed a girl while abroad) and the breakup was the hardest one i’ve ever dealt with. i did the most healing after him and ever since then i haven’t been able to experience a connection like i did with him. it felt so genuine and easy until he left on his trip and things went south with us. 

after us, he got into a relationship and dated this girl for 3 years (2021-2024). i had forgiven him at this point and was pretty much over him. i was actually genuinely happy to see him happy and with someone. although i realized one thing.. she looked just like me. 

i would check in on him here & there (as any ex would lol) and noticed that his girlfriend was copying my style, outfits & photos. i have multiple screenshots of side by sides of our pictures compared and the dates , where i would post something first and she would later post something VERY similar. i thought this was very strange. 

early this year i received a DM from his girlfriend, saying something along the lines of “i know this is weird but me and J broke up and I have been looking at your profile for quite some time and i think we have a lot in common, i would love to talk and get to know you :)” .. she was very sweet in her message and although i thought it was a bit strange, i responded and offered a coffee date. i was honestly curious why they ended things and thought maybe she went through something similar to me and i could give her some good advice. subconsciously this was also my way of knowing how J was doing. our hangout went well but i noticed she was OVERLY observant of me. and told me that J talked about me a lot during their relationship. i was a bit uncomfortable and i genuinely felt bad for her. i didn’t want her comparing herself to me.

about 6 months after we hung out J found out and reached out to me. he wanted to tell me his side of things and that i should not be spending time with his ex because he said (and i quote) “she hates you”. 

although i minded my own business and never broke no contact with J though out his entire relationship with this girl, apparently I was a big problem in their relationship. which i was completely unaware of.

after J and I caught up and talked about everything I realized that we still have a very special connection that I have been missing.. but now me and his ex are “friends” and after hearing all of this information i feel uncomfortable with her & i being acquainted. especially now that me and J are reconnected and i understand the situation. 

i genuinely feel like J and I were meant to find each other again and now we have the chance to. He later told me that he still has love for me and we both came to the realization that we miss what we had with each other and there could be a possibility of us starting again. i have seen so much growth in him mentally and i could see myself being with him now. 

im just feeling held back because of his ex and what she would think.. and also what she would do..

1g2j0e2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_GallantArmor/comments/1g2j0e2/the_lost_spark/,The Lost Spark ,"Jack awoke in the cold, sterile confines of the medbay, the hiss of machines and soft beeping of monitors surrounding him. His chest ached, a deep, sharp pain that hitched with every breath.

He winced as he tugged at the bandages, seeing a jagged scar snaking down his chest. In a flash he was back in the blissful darkness, warmth enveloping his face, a feeling a fullness inside him like he had never felt before.

But that was gone now.

He couldn’t explain it, but ever since the surgery, there was a hollow sensation in his chest. His body had rejected the alien embryo, purging it with a violent immune response. The doctors called it a lucky fluke, an evolutionary anomaly that made his body a hostile environment for the parasite. Others in his unit hadn’t been so fortunate—the creatures inside them killing them in gruesome, horrifying ways. Jack had seen the aftermath. It should have been him, too.

Yet, Jack couldn’t shake the feeling that something had been lost. Not just the creature… something else. A part of himself, perhaps. The embryo had been inside him, trying to survive, and his body had killed it before it could take hold. At first, he thought it was just relief mixed with the trauma of the event, but as the days passed, it became something deeper. A strange sense of guilt.

The others in the medical wing congratulated him on his survival, his rare ‘gift’. His commander slapped him on the back and called him a walking miracle. But Jack could barely muster a smile. At night, when the medbay lights dimmed and the machines droned on in the background, he felt a creeping emptiness gnawing at him. He found himself touching the spot on his chest where the embryo had been, running his fingers over the puckered, scarred skin. This didn’t feel like a victory.

The dreams started a few nights after the surgery. Vivid, unsettling nightmares where Jack could feel the fetus growing inside him. In the dreams, it was struggling to grow, trying to bond with him. He could feel its pulse, faint at first, then stronger, syncing with his own heartbeat.

But then, just as quickly, the pulse would weaken, fade away, leaving him alone, cold, and hollow. He woke up each time drenched in sweat, the ghost of that lost connection lingering in the dark.

Jack didn’t tell anyone about the dreams. They’d think he was crazy. The doctors had already warned him about post-traumatic stress, which was common after near-death experiences. But this was something more. To him, the embryo wasn’t just a mindless monster. It was… his. It had fought to survive, and his body had killed it.

Jack sat hunched over in the dimly lit research terminal, the soft glow of the screen casting shadows over his face. His eyes scanned line after line of encrypted data, field reports, and classified medical studies.

He had been at this for hours, losing track of how many cups of stale coffee he’d consumed. But he was close. He could feel it, the answer he had been searching for.

The alien species, designated Xenomorph-A79 had been a mystery to the scientific community for over a century. Every encounter seemed to end the same way: death. Hosts were torn apart from within, their bodies devoured as the creatures burst forth.

But what intrigued Jack the most was the note at the bottom of the report:

“The symbiotes appear to incorporate genetic material from their hosts during the gestation period, adapting to the host's specific physiology. This enables the creature to not only survive but thrive in its environment, growing stronger with each iteration.”

Jack leaned back in his chair, the words bouncing around in his mind. The aliens didn’t just feed off their hosts. They were merging with them to build something more powerful.

His stomach churned with the realization. The embryo hadn’t been trying to kill him. It had been learning from him. Perhaps when it had scanned his body, sifting through his genetic makeup, it found something... lacking. His immune system had fought it off, yes, but maybe that wasn’t the real reason it died.

The embryo had rejected him.

Jack’s breath caught in his throat, his pulse quickening as he stared at the screen. He felt a mixture of rage and shame creeping into his mind, twisting his thoughts. All this time, he had thought he was spared, his survival a fluke. But no, he hadn’t been spared at all. He had been passed over. Cast aside.

He clenched his fists, leaning forward until his forehead rested against the screen. He could feel the raw anger rising in his chest, the sense of inadequacy gnawing at him. The alien had judged him, found him lacking, and let him live out of pity. He wasn’t good enough to be a host. It had seen him for what he truly was.

Weak.

The feeling of loss deepened as time went on. Jack retreated from his fellow crew members, craving solitude. He couldn't shake the idea that something had died inside him—not just the creature, but part of himself.

It wasn’t just grief—it was longing.

\---

Jack sat in the sterile, softly lit therapy room, his fingers twitching in his lap as he stared at the wall. The therapist, Dr. Renford, sat across from him, her notepad resting on her knee. She had been assigned to him after the surgery, a mandatory part of his recovery.

She cleared her throat softly. ""Jack, I need you to talk about what’s really going on. About how you’re feeling.""

He kept his eyes on the floor, unwilling to meet her gaze. The walls felt too close, the air too thick. He’d been doing these sessions for weeks, but every time she pressed, it made the knot in his chest tighten.

“It’s not that simple,” Jack muttered, his voice low and gravelly.

""Then explain it to me,"" she said, her tone calm, but firm. “You’ve been through an extraordinary trauma, Jack. You survived something no one else has.”

After a lengthy pause, he closed his eyes. “I can still feel it,” Jack said, almost in a whisper. “The thing that was inside me—it’s not gone. Not really. A part of it stayed behind.”

He risked a glance at her, expecting skepticism. But Dr. Renford’s expression was neutral, her pen poised above the notepad.

“Go on,” she encouraged.

Jack exhaled heavily, his frustration mixing with the hollow ache in his chest. “It’s like it didn’t fully die. It’s still... there, somehow. And every time I close my eyes, I can feel it.”

Dr. Renford made a note, but her voice remained steady. “That must be incredibly traumatic, to feel something so invasive still lingering.”

“No!” Jack cut her off, shaking his head. “It’s not trauma. I’ve been looking through the reports—\*classified\* files. I know what these things do. They pull in genetic material from their hosts. They adapt. They grow stronger.” His voice wavered for a moment. “But it didn’t finish. It died because I wasn’t... I wasn’t enough.”

Dr. Renford’s eyes softened. “Jack, are you saying you feel like the embryo rejected you?”

Jack shook his head. “You don’t get it. It was evolving, adapting to me. It was using my DNA to become something more. And when it realized I was unsuitable, it died.”

Dr. Renford’s expression remained calm, but there was a flicker of concern in her eyes now. “Jack, it’s important that we talk about these feelings. You’re placing an incredible burden on yourself for something that was beyond your control.”

Jack’s jaw tightened, his hands trembling slightly. “It wasn’t beyond my control. I’m not the same as I was before. It’s still in me. And I need to find out why it didn’t work, why it rejected me. There has to be a way to... fix it.”

“Fix it?” Dr. Renford repeated, her voice cautious. “Jack, the alien was a threat to your life, and it is gone now. There’s nothing to ‘fix’.”

Jack stayed silent, the cold ache of loss settling deeper into his bones. Maybe this was all just trauma, his mind clinging to some twisted sense of failure. But deep down, he didn’t believe that.

\---

Then came the night when Jack made his decision. He couldn’t live like this—half-alive, haunted by the remnants of the embryo that had tried to bond with him. He needed to finish what had been started.

It was insane. He knew that. But, he no longer feared the creatures—he craved them. It had given him something, a spark of life, a purpose that his body had stolen. He wanted it back. He wanted to feel the alien’s pulse inside him again, to know what it was like to be part of something bigger, something beyond human understanding.

Jack started making arrangements. He had contacts who dealt in illegal alien tech and biological specimens—people who could get him what he needed. He knew the risks, knew he might not survive the next encounter. But this time, he wouldn’t fight it. He wouldn’t let his body reject the creature. He would embrace it, welcome the spark of life that had once flickered inside him.",1,1728798652.0,u_GallantArmor,0,1.0,False

My kid is super smart.,"My dad told me he never bragged about his kids to people in public because his kids did well for themselves while other people's families might not have had such luck and he didnt want to rub it in. I get that but I cant help it and I feel a need to flex.  

My son is 3.5 and autistic.  He has an IEP and is in the special ed class.  He requires routines, flips out if he doesnt follow the routine for just about everything.  He is obsessed with elevators.  All he wants to do in any public space is find and ride the elevators.  He's stubborn, always has been.  Willful, defiant, difficult to train.  He is behind on motor skills and his social skills are taking a lot of work.  He doesnt like other kids his age.  He is very clumsy. He fears dogs.  He toe walks. Repeats himself.  He flaps his arms. etc.

But his math is insane.  At 3.5 years old he can count well into the hundreds.  He has counted to over 300 out loud in the car.  He could keep going but we got where we were going.  He can count backwards.  He can add.  ""5+3"" ""11+7"" ""61+5"" He doesnt carry the one in his head quite yet, but he will with finger counting.   He can add numbers such as 200+300 and 3000+7000.  He can also do 200+75 =275. He answered ""If grandpa is 71, how long until he's 91?"" correctly and instantly, which means he is applying numbers to real world concepts.  An elevator had 2 columns of 7 buttons and I asked him how many were in a column.  He counted.  How many columns, he said ""two"" so what does that make ""14!""  I saw him do 9*4 visually (four grids of nine objects).  He can skip count by 2's 3's 4's 5's 10's and 11's. He can also do some subtraction problems.  He can tell time on a digital clock and is getting there on an analogue clock.

He also remembers details from years ago with perfect clarity.  Multiple situations, people, characters, as far back as 15 months old.  

His imaginative play is through the roof.  His games are complex, he builds elevators for his stuffed animals out of anything he can find.  Repurposing hair dryers because they have 2 buttons for the 'up' and 'down' button.  He uses books for the doors and the kids chairs for the inside of the elevator.  The books slid into each other and reticulate the way some elevator doors do.  We had to buy him wooden boards about 18 inches by 18 inches so he'd stop damaging every book that size by stuffing them into each other to make elevator doors. He has made many other creative things out of his toys.  Onetime making me a coffee grinder out of some blocks and a plastic cup, reasoning that I like coffee, coffee grinders have clear plastic tops and that I'd like this gift.

Oh, and he also hates the school gym teacher already and refused to participate in the gym class.  He tells us he doesnt like Coach because Coach tries to tell him what to do and he doesnt like to do what the coach says. They've given up making him participate. Getting out of gym because you hate it is an advanced skill that this kid has also mastered.

I dont have a question or anything.  I think people in my life are sick of me bragging about my kid.  At the end of the day, I know no one wants to hear it.  But I want to scream it from the rooftops.  He has his issues, and he'll need support in life.  But he's got that brain going for him, so I think he'll be ok.",12,1728798543.0,daddit,2,1.0,False

The sunny smell of honey, the sour tang of wild berries in my breath instead of coffee.
I want the flowers to dye my clothes yellow.
I want to lie in the middle of the field of flowers when I am dead and gone, to let them consume me. To have a purpose to nurture. To live and die under the sun.",0,1728798103.0,writers,3,0.5,False

1g2iord,https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1g2iord/should_i_stay/,Should I stay?,"I found out that my husband of 6 years has been on tinder for the last 2 years when he’s traveling for work. He has chatted with people for just a night to a few days (so he says at least). He met up with 1 person to have coffee but didn’t try anything physical (she is how I found out. She found my profile and told me). He says he hasn’t met up with anyone else, and for reasons hard to explain concisely here I think I do believe that. 

He has apologised profusely. Said that he was so stressed with his work that he was always behind but then so stressed at home because we always needed him home more (2 young kids) so he couldn’t stay back late to get on top of work. So he just wanted to be able to have a conversation with someone where he didn’t feel like he was failing in some aspect. And tinder seemed like the best way to be able to talk to people quickly. (Yeah I know, convenient story.) 

Apart from this, he is an insanely hands on and doting father, my best friend for the last 15 years. We’ve always had so much fun. He works hard and earns good money so I’m able to work part time to stay home with our kids extra days. He wants to fix things between us. He has set up his old phone to be a mirror of his current phone so I can see exactly what he’s doing whenever I want. And is keen to go to therapy together whenever I’m ready. 

If I left, I’d need to go back to work full time most likely, and would never get a break from parenting, which he gives me as often as he can. He travels a lot for work so he’d never get anything close to 50/50 custody. More likely I’d get full custody or he’d maybe get a couple of hours on the weekend. And although I’d obviously prefer having my kids with me, never having a break is also a daunting concept. 

If I can find a way to move past this, should I? He’s not abusive in any way, he does so much around the house and for the kids. I can’t even imagine wanting to find someone again after this. But the thought of being alone for the rest of my life is also very lonely. I’ve also heard it’s just hell in the dating world now. 

Thought and opinions welcome. Especially from men. If he hasn’t ever touched another woman, did he just justify that it wasn’t really cheating somehow? Is that how men’s brains work?",0,1728797247.0,Infidelity,4,0.5,False

Down bad so I'm taking this to reddit wow can't believe it.,"So I met this cute girl last semester at an event and don't think much of it. Then, this semester she happens to be in 3 of my classes and I start sitting next to her. I think she's cute so I ask for her number after class (since she is in a lot of my classes). At the beginning, we kind of just text about school stuff. But last week, I asked her to go study for our test and she agreed. I bought her a coffee and we went to a building with the intention to study but we ended up talking for 3 hours, it was vibes, she even missed her class. The next day, her friend, who is also my friend, but I didn't even know they knew each other, sends me a picture of both of them with a kissy face with the caption ""just wanted to say hi"" on a night out. I was kinda hype but also kind of confused bc I seriously never mentioned this girl to my friend, who she apparently also knew (hopefully this wasn't confusing). Since then, vibes have been better sitting next to each other in class and she has been texting me randomly throughout the day, mostly about school stuff but it feels as if she uses the school stuff as an excuse to start a conversation, or talk to me. I also find her laughing at my jokes, just good vibes idk. Last weekend, she randomly texts me if I was going to the bar (which she doesn't like going to- so I joked with her that I couldn't believe it). She sent me pics of her getting ready to go out. I finally get to the bar and her friend who sent the kissy face said I had to go find her. When I finally go up to her, she does give me a hug but then she literally gives me the cold shoulder and acts mad weird around me and like turns to her friends when I try to talk to her. She didn't seem mad, she just seemed like awkward. I would like try to say something to her and she would just like nod her head and smile and try to talk to her other friends.

We grew up in the same neighbourhood and we attended all of the same schools from Kindergarten through to grade 12, often in the same classes. I honestly don’t really remember ever having any significant interactions with her except for two instances. In grade six some of the male students had taken to calling her a very rude name that I will not write here. I ended up telling the teacher on them. (It turns out that tattling on people in front of them is not a good way to make friends lol.) And then in either grade 10 or 11 one of Cassie’s friends approached me after class and told me that there was a girl in the class who had a crush on me. I, being completely oblivious to this sort of thing (still am, but that’s another story for another time), asked her who it was. Her response was to tell me that she couldn’t tell me specifically but she could let me know that her name started with the letter C (not the actual letter). Well, there were two girls in the class who had names starting with the letter C and let me assure you that I blurted out the incorrect name. Apart from those two interactions I only really remember that she was nice and kind of shy. We never really talked much and while I eventually knew she was kind of into me, I was just not that interested.

Fast forward to several months after graduation  (December 2014) and she sent me a message over Facebook looking to catch up. We sent a couple of messages back and forth and we agreed to meet for coffee, but that eventually fell through due to conflicting schedules. She messaged me again in the new year (January 2015) and I guess I just never responded. In hindsight maybe I should have, but I honestly don’t remember what was going through my mind in 2015. Over the next four years she would proceed to message me over Facebook one to three times per year. I never responded. The last time she messaged me was in 2018.

Fast forward to about a week ago and I received another Facebook message from Cassie. I didn’t really think too hard about it and when she asked how I have been I casually responded. We have since messaged back and forth a couple of times, but I don’t really have any desire to reconnect. This is someone I never knew well and who I have not spoken to in a decade. We are both now living in completely different provinces, and based on our recent conversation I feel we likely still have very little in common.

I guess what I am wondering is how I should proceed. WIBTA if I told her the truth that I’m genuinely not interested? Do I just ghost her? Do I continue to engage in the conversation? I don’t really see a good option here and I don’t want to hurt her feelings. To be fair, she has not brought up anything about relationships or dating life as part of our current conversation, so I may be entirely reading into this too much. Would it be worse to tell her I’m not interested if she hasn’t even broached the subject yet? I just don’t know what the best option is and I already feel like an ass no matter what I end up deciding.

1g2ijq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVpnEng/comments/1g2ijq1/how_to_install_nordvpn_on_your_omada_router/,How to Install NordVPN on Your Omada Router,"If you're looking to boost your online privacy and security, setting up NordVPN on your Omada router is a game-changer. This guide will walk you through the process step-by-step, so you can protect all your devices with one fell swoop.

# Why Install NordVPN on Your Omada Router?

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty, let's talk about why you'd want to do this in the first place:

* **Whole-network protection:** Every device connected to your router gets the VPN treatment
* **One-and-done setup:** No need to install VPN software on each gadget
* **Always-on security:** Your VPN stays active 24/7

Sounds pretty sweet, right? Let's get started!

# What You'll Need

Before we kick things off, make sure you've got:

* An active [NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/SH93W) subscription
* A compatible TP-Link Omada router (double-check your model supports VPN protocols)
* Your router's admin credentials
* A bit of patience (and maybe a cup of coffee)

# Step-by-Step Guide to Install NordVPN on Your Omada Router

# 1. Update Your Router's Firmware

First things first, make sure your router's running the latest firmware. This'll help avoid any hiccups down the road.

1. Log into your router's admin panel (usually at 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1)
2. Look for a ""Firmware Update"" option
3. If there's an update available, go ahead and install it
4. Reboot your router once it's done

# 2. Enable the VPN Client

Now that your router's up to date, let's turn on the VPN client:

1. Head back to your router's admin panel
2. Find the ""Advanced Settings"" or ""VPN"" section
3. Look for ""VPN Client"" and toggle it on
4. Save your changes

# 3. Choose Your VPN Protocol

Omada routers typically support OpenVPN and WireGuard. OpenVPN's a bit older but rock-solid, while WireGuard's the new kid on the block with faster speeds. Pick your poison:

# OpenVPN Setup

1. Grab the OpenVPN config files from NordVPN's website
2. In your router's control panel, create a new VPN profile
3. Enter your NordVPN username and password
4. Upload the OpenVPN config file you downloaded
5. Save and apply the changes

# WireGuard Setup (if supported)

1. Head to the ""VPN > WireGuard"" section in your router settings
2. Add a new profile using NordLynx settings (NordVPN's WireGuard implementation)
3. Enter the VPN endpoint, private key, and allowed IPs (you'll get these from NordVPN)
4. Save and apply

# 4. Tweak Your DNS Settings

To keep your browsing on the down-low, let's use NordVPN's DNS servers:

1. Find the ""Network > WAN > Advanced"" settings in your router's control panel
2. Set the primary DNS to 103.86.96.100
3. Set the secondary DNS to 103.86.99.100
4. Save those changes

# 5. Test Your Connection

Now for the moment of truth – let's make sure everything's working:

1. Check the VPN status in your router's dashboard
2. Visit a site like whatismyip.com to see if your IP address has changed
3. Try accessing a geo-restricted site to see if you can get in

# Troubleshooting Tips

Hit a snag? Don't sweat it. Here are some common issues and how to fix 'em:

# Connection Failures

* Double-check your NordVPN credentials
* Make sure your config files are up to date
* Try a different NordVPN server

# Slow Speeds

* Switch to a closer NordVPN server
* Try UDP instead of TCP for OpenVPN
* Consider using WireGuard if your router supports it

# Routing Problems

* Check your VLAN settings if you're using them
* Make sure all traffic is being directed through the VPN tunnel

# Advanced Configurations

Ready to take your VPN game to the next level? Here are some pro tips:

# Split Tunneling

Want some devices on the VPN and others off? Here's how:

1. Set up VLANs in your router settings
2. Configure policy routing to direct specific devices through the VPN
3. Leave other devices on your regular network

# Kill Switch

Keep your data safe even if the VPN drops:

1. Look for a ""Kill Switch"" option in your router's VPN settings
2. Enable it to cut internet access if the VPN connection fails

# FAQs

# Will this slow down my internet?

It might a bit, but using WireGuard or a nearby server can help minimize the impact.

# Can I still access local devices?

Yep! Your local network should still work as usual.

# What if my router doesn't support VPN clients?

You might need to flash custom firmware like DD-WRT or OpenWrt, but that's a whole other can of worms.

# Wrapping Up

There you have it – your very own NordVPN-powered Omada router! You've just leveled up your home network security. Give yourself a pat on the back, you tech wizard.

Remember, the internet's a wild place, so keep your VPN running and stay safe out there. And if you run into any trouble, don't hesitate to reach out to NordVPN's support team – they're pretty helpful folks.

Now go forth and browse with confidence, knowing your entire network's got that sweet, sweet VPN protection. Happy surfing!",1,1728796643.0,TheVpnEng,0,1.0,False
1g2ijgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/House1000Designs/comments/1g2ijgv/modern_four_bedroom_house_designs/,Modern Four Bedroom House Designs,"Innovative Features in Modern Four Bedroom House Designs
--------------------------------------------------------

Modern four bedroom house designs are realizing the potential of innovative features that not only enhance functionality but also improve the overall comfort and aesthetic appeal of a home. In today’s world, where space is often at a premium, these designs creatively balance convenience, sustainability, and style. Let's explore some of the key innovative features that can elevate a four bedroom house from ordinary to extraordinary.

One of the most sought-after innovations is the incorporation of open floor plans. This layout provides a seamless flow between the living room, dining area, and kitchen, creating an inviting atmosphere that encourages family interaction and socializing. By removing unnecessary walls, these designs maximize natural light and create a sense of space that often feels much larger than its actual square footage.

Another standout feature is the incorporation of smart home technology. Modern four bedroom houses often include smart thermostats, lighting systems, and security measures that residents can control right from their smartphones. This technology not only improves convenience but also enhances energy efficiency, which can lead to significant savings on utility bills. Imagine being able to adjust your home’s temperature or lock your doors from anywhere in the world!

Sustainability is a critical feature in contemporary design. Energy-efficient appliances are now a standard in many designs, reducing energy consumption and promoting a healthier environment. Homeowners are increasingly opting for solar panels, rainwater harvesting systems, and sustainable building materials. These choices not only benefit the planet but can also increase property value.

In addition, outdoor living spaces are becoming integral to many modern four bedroom house designs. Patios, decks, and outdoor kitchens create cozy spaces for relaxation and entertainment. These areas are designed to extend the living space of a house into the outdoors, allowing families to enjoy nature while still being close to home. Bi-fold doors that open completely can blur the lines between inside and outside, promoting a greater sense of unity with the natural environment.

Another innovative feature is multi-functional rooms. Flex rooms can serve various purposes, such as a home office, gym, or playroom, depending on the family's needs. This adaptability is especially beneficial for growing families or those who frequently change how they use their space. Having rooms that can serve more than one function keeps the home dynamic and responsive to its occupants’ changing lifestyles.

- **Smart Home Features:** Integration with voice-activated assistants, automated lighting, security cameras, and integrated sound systems.
- **Green Technology:** Use of low-flow fixtures, sustainable materials, and energy-efficient heating/cooling systems.
- **Spacious Storage:** Built-in shelves, walk-in closets, and attic storage designed to keep the home organized.
- **Natural Elements:** Incorporation of indoor plants, large windows for natural light, and the use of natural materials like stone and wood.

Modern four bedroom house designs also emphasize personalization. Customizable features allow homeowners to tailor their spaces according to their tastes. From unique cabinetry in the kitchen to accent walls in the bedrooms, these personal touches make each home feel unique to its occupants. This personal investment in design can lead to greater satisfaction and pride in one’s home.

Moreover, safety features are paramount in contemporary designs. With family safety in mind, many homes are designed with secure entry points, advanced fire safety mechanisms, and strategically placed windows for visibility and security. Families can feel at ease knowing their living environment is engineered to keep their loved ones safe.

Energy-efficient landscaping complements the house's exterior. Thoughtful gardens, strategically placed trees, and xeriscaping not only enhance curb appeal but also offer shade and reduce cooling costs. This harmonious blend of landscaping and architecture creates a visually appealing and sustainable living environment.

Modern four bedroom house designs embody a fusion of innovative features that make homes not only beautiful but also functional and environmentally conscious. By embracing open plans, smart technology, sustainability, and personalized touches, these homes cater to the needs and preferences of today’s families, creating richer living experiences for everyone involved.

Maximizing Space in Contemporary Home Layouts
---------------------------------------------

When it comes to contemporary home layouts, maximizing space is crucial. Many homeowners face the challenge of living in smaller areas while still wanting functionality and style. You can achieve a perfect balance with a few thoughtful design choices. Innovative designs and clever use of space make a modern four-bedroom house not only livable but also enjoyable.

### Utilizing Open Floor Plans

Open floor plans are a hallmark of modern design, and for good reason. They create a seamless flow between the kitchen, dining, and living areas. This layout increases natural light and makes the space feel larger. When the walls come down, you can also choose multifunctional furniture. For example, consider:

- **Expandable dining tables:** These tables can accommodate guests and fold down when not in use.
- **Ottomans with storage:** Use them as a coffee table or extra seating while keeping items hidden inside.

### Smart Storage Solutions

In contemporary homes, maximizing space goes hand-in-hand with smart storage. Look for creative ways to incorporate storage into your designs. Some options include:

- **Built-in shelving:** Install shelves around doors or windows to utilize under-used spaces.
- **Utilizing vertical space:** High ceilings can support tall cabinets that draw the eye upwards.
- **Under-stair storage:** Transform the area below your staircase into a closet or a cozy reading nook.

### Multi-functional Rooms

Creating multi-functional rooms is key to maximizing space. For a modern four-bedroom house, you can design rooms that serve more than one purpose. Here are some ideas:

- **Guest room and office:** A pull-out sofa bed can convert a home office into a guest space when needed.
- **Playroom and study area:** Consider a quiet corner for homework in a playroom, using flexible furnishings that can be moved around.

Having flexible spaces allows the home to adapt to your family’s changing needs.

### Outdoor Living Areas

Maximizing space doesn’t stop indoors. Modern designs often extend living areas outdoors. This addition can turn even the smallest yard into an oasis. Here are some suggestions:

- **Decks and patios:** Create outdoor seating areas that blend well with your landscape.
- **Vertical gardens:** Use wall space for planting to encourage greenery without consuming ground space.
- **Outdoor kitchens:** Enhance your indoor cooking space by moving some of the appliances outside.

### Minimalist Design Principles

Embracing a minimalist design can also be a smart way to maximize space. By reducing clutter and focusing on essential elements, you can create an open, airy feel. Consider these tips:

- **Choose neutral color palettes:** Soft colors can help to visually expand your space.
- **Limit decorative elements:** Select a few key pieces that reflect your personality instead of overcrowding your space.

### Sustainable Materials and Energy Efficiency

Today’s modern homes often focus on sustainability. Using eco-friendly materials not only helps the environment but can also create a healthier indoor atmosphere. Think about:

- **Recycled building materials:** Incorporate reclaimed wood or recycled metal into your design.
- **Energy-efficient appliances:** Invest in appliances that save space and reduce energy consumption.

To sum up, maximizing space in contemporary home layouts is about making smart choices. By utilizing open floor plans, incorporating smart storage, designing multi-functional rooms, and extending living areas to the outdoors, you can craft a modern four-bedroom house that feels spacious and welcoming. With sustainable practices and a minimalist approach, you can create a home that is not just stylish but practical as well. With these strategies, your home can be both functional and beautiful, perfectly tailored to your lifestyle.

### Conclusion

As you explore modern four bedroom house designs, you'll discover that these homes are more than just shelter; they are thoughtfully crafted living spaces that prioritize comfort, functionality, and style. The innovative features showcased in these designs—such as open floor plans, eco-friendly materials, and smart home technology—are tailored to meet the dynamic needs of today's families. Each element works harmoniously to create a welcoming environment that enhances daily life.

Maximizing space is another hallmark of contemporary layouts. With clever storage solutions and multi-purpose rooms, modern four bedroom houses make every square foot count. This thoughtful approach allows families to enjoy spaciousness without sacrificing aesthetics. From expansive windows that invite natural light to flexible spaces that can adapt over time, these designs offer a perfect blend of utility and beauty.

When designing or choosing a four bedroom home today, consider how these innovative features and space-maximizing strategies can contribute to your lifestyle. Whether you prioritize entertaining, family time, or a peaceful retreat at home, you can find designs that cater to your specific needs. The essence of modern living is about creating a balanced, harmonious environment.

Aliens only dipped a ""finger"" out of their whole multidimensional body structure. ","Spiritual, multidimensional, timeless and spaceless. Please think about this words. They describe entities that only partially exist or penetrate our reality. Keep in mind their “other part” is in realm unimaginable to us.

   How is that possible? Thought experiment: Downscale our 3D world to 2D as if we are people on a flat sheet of paper, and higher dimension, represented by a cube can go through our flat world and at every moment of time there would be only a single “slice” of a cube inside the sheet of paper fabric.

But that’s not it! Aliens are not material higher dimensional cubes. They are something “3D” that feels in our imaginable “2D” world as narratives, events, stories only when it ""goes"" through us in a certain manner! 

Do you get it? Event types like walking to school or drinking coffee, browsing reddit - it is something you can imagine and something you can put as a goal and live through your life toward it. So the event like “drink coffee” is timeless and spaceless itself, fundamental as math. It happened to many people before you and will happen again. And for aliens that is one single moment and place!

**“Drinking coffee” and all that leads to and from it is a single case that is a “body structure part” of an alien in our reality. Same as all other ever existed in past and existing in future TYPES of narratives and events.**

You have the illusion that you run your body. It is run by some aliens from higher realms that propagate through your consciousness that consist of narratives created and detected in time. It's probably true because neither you nor I understand for 100% what we live for, what is the goal? You live and understand reality only because you follow some ideas and goals. And their fundamental meanings are a mystery to us.

It is obvious as bees that don't see beekeeper but suspect he exists.

We are now in the final days, it seems. She has been in the hospital for 3.5 weeks, declining each day. Since Wed of this week, she has weakened to the point of sleeping 99% of the time. She was still interacting, minimally Wed, Thurs, a bit. She was still attempting bites of yogurt, but almost no food, just Ensure and a bit of coffee.

By yesterday, she had 3 Ensures in 24+ hours, nothing else. Today, 2 half spoons of applesauce to take pills (which the nurses finally agreed that she doesn't need). No drinks at all. Yesterday, she seemed to finally realize that the end is near, acknowledge it verbally, and seem more at peace with it. Yesterday, she would briefly perk up for visitors, maybe a few minutes here and there, but that means open one eye, smile, wave, accept hugs. 

Today, we've had a total of less than 10 minutes of that. Maybe 15 if I'm generous. As for actually speaking, maybe 5 to 10 whispered words all day, usually 'can't breathe '.

The day shift dr, who has been awesome and here visiting at length every day for 5 days, said we could switch to constant Dilaudid PCA whenever we felt ready...but the night shift dr says she's not in enough pain or struggling enough, and he won't approve it because it will hasten death. 

So...any tips on what I should be requesting or pushing for? I hate seeing her eyes come half open every 2 hrs, gasp, get meds, go back to sleep. I just want her to go into that deep sleep until she passes. She is suddenly almost deaf, barely comprehending, when she is half alert (ish) she shakes her head no to visits from family... But, it sounds like we just sit in this cycle. 

And...do you go sleep? I'm staying 10 min from the hospital (I don't live here), so it's quick to come back. But, I don't know if I should stay or go sleep a bit. She could be like this for hours or days, it seems.

**I Completely Messed Up and May have lost my husband.**

&#x200B;

Me (34F) and my husband (35M) have been married 5 years and together for 9. From the start, I totally felt like I won the boyfriend / husband lottery cause he’s definitely out of my league. He’s handsome, very fit and athletic (wrestling and boxing and ju jitsu), and super charming. I see the way women look at him and I am very aware of how attractive he is.

My husband has never given me any reason to think he has been unfaithful. He’s wonderful provider and father to our 2yr old son. However, about 6 weeks - there was a change in his routine that made me suspicious. My husband is an engineer - doesn’t work crazy long hours but does bring work home usually. I work part time from home (2 or 3 days a week) - and we have a spare bedroom that my husband made into a beautiful office.

Usually when my husband comes from work (I am done working by the time he comes home), he usually eats something and then finishes up some work or he goes and works out. However, I do admit kinda pestering him for things while he is working or exercising. If he can reach something for me, move a box, take the trash out. Or our son wants to see him and play or be read to. I admit that it is probably very distracting, but he never has indicated to me that it bothered him.

So about six weeks ago, my husband started to leave for work very early. He always woke up first, made breakfast and coffee, fed our son. And then he would leave when I would wake up. But lately, he would leave for work about an hour earlier, he would make coffee still but would leave before our son got up.

My stupid friends told me he was probably cheating. So they convinced me to sneak into his phone. I looked at his phone while he was in the shower (he doesn’t keep it locked) I found nothing - no texts or phone calls. But I did share the location of his phone to mine.

Next morning, he leaves early as usual - and I track his phone. Turns out he was going to a hotel! I am livid - I ask my neighbor to watch our son for me and head to the hotel to try and confront him.

When I get to parking lot, I can kind of see on my phone that he is on direction of this little restaurant associated with the hotel. It was a little diner and that’s where I found my husband. He was in a booth, by himself with his laptop doing work and having breakfast. My husband spots me and asks what I am doing there.

I felt so relieved and told my husband my suspicions and what my friends told me (my husband hates my friends). I saw how disappointed he looked. He didn’t say much to me except “I can’t believe you thought I would do that and that you would trust your dumbass friend over me.” He ended up going to work and I went home and tried to be the best wife ever. I even made dinner for him which I never do cause he is a way better cook.

I don’t know what to do though, my husband has been very distant last few days and slept in the guest room past 3 nights which totally broke me. And today I found out, my husband will not come home today, he’s staying with a friend. I am totally panicking now. How can I fix this Reddit?

*H: Oh I’m kinda tired of cooking and found this diner I like and do some work at*

**socool111**

*I think from your post it’s clear that YOU are self conscious. You even say he’s out of your league. I think you need to confess that the suspicions were not a notion that he wasn’t trustworthy but a failing on your own self worth.*

*Any apology that is “I should have trusted” or “I had no reason to doubt” won’t hold any water as that’s exactly what you did.*

*You need to tell him that after internalizing: you failed him, and not him having a problem.*

*As others said of course he could of communicated more. But regardless of communication, she didn’t have his trust. Communication isn’t necessary to say “I’m not cheating”. Sure he should have communicated to make his life better and relationship better. But that has nothing to do with OP not trust and being suspicious.*

*You have to lay your cards out and be vulnerable to him and prove to him that this is your short coming, and not just a “I made a bad decision in the moment”. It’s a “I have to give myself more self worth, and I instead turned it on to you”*

&#x200B;

**call-me-mama-t**

*Why would you listen to your friends instead of asking your husband? Learn how to talk to each other! He’s probably pissed because now he knows that your friend group thinks he’s a cheater. How would you feel if the tables were turned? Not good, I guarantee you. You have some groveling to do!*

&#x200B;

**Grimwohl**

*Why would you listen to your friends instead of asking your husband? Because realistically, most people IRL give the same advice they give on reddit. Mistrust and projection of fear and trauma tends to catch easily. I think after finding nothing in his phone, you owed him a conversation. You had already technically proven to yourself he was innocent or very, very good at hiding it.*

**Mini Updates in the same post**

&#x200B;

I just heard from my husband through text. He changed his mind said he will come home tonight (thank god!). He said the part he was upset about the most was that I told my friend about the issue instead of talking to him. I kinda know how much this would bother him because he always makes comments about how much he dislikes when people talk about their spouses negatively. So, Reddit, I am going to apologize profusely, I know I messed up. But I need to save this.

&#x200B;

**2 Hours Later**

He’s coming home in a few hours. He says he doesn’t have to do any work when he comes home (yay!). I am not really sure how to approach it - do I let him talk to me? Do I just apologize and tell him I was worried about losing him?

I’m not sure what to do about my friends. I’ve known these girls since elementary school and we are doing a girls trip to Nashville in like a month. I haven’t told them what happened but i haven’t been really in the mood to talk on the group texts. But for some context, yes, I am the only one out of all them who is married.

*I wouldn’t take advice on my marriage from friends that aren’t married. I would cut that out completely. You don’t have to drop the friends, but keep your marriage off limits.*

**GothicGingerbread**

*At a bare minimum, OP needs to back away from those friends. And skip the trip to Nashville.*

&#x200B;

**Update - 1 day later**

&#x200B;

Good morning Reddit, last night went well I think. I was rehearsing all day what I wanted to say to him but when he come home, I just broke down. I cried and my husband just hugged me. He told me that we can talk later after we put our boy to bed.

After our son went to sleep, that’s when we talked. To be fair to my husband, he was telling me the night before that he was leaving early for work and was really only doing that if I wasn’t working the next day. I apologized every other sentence but I asked him what I could do to make things easier on him, how I could help? If he feels safe at that diner, how could I do that at home? So I told him that I was going to start waking up with him in the morning, I can get our son up and dressed and get both him and my husband fed. I told him he can even work in the morning and I will stay out of the way too. I think he really appreciated that cause he kinda choked up and said “that would be really nice.” We slept together too!

As for my friends, there is a backstory there. My husband didn’t say never to talk or see them but I am not going on the trip and I am going to definitely distance myself from them.

*Lesson learned OP. I hope it works out. You seem like a nice lady who just needs to mature and get some confidence.*

*Just remember, next time a “friend” says something stupid - always remember who would be rooting for you? Who wants you to succeed? Who wants you happy? Seems to me your husband through his actions has proven he wants the best for you and your son.*

**Final Update - 1 day later**

&#x200B;

Update: Hi Reddit! This will probably be my final update - I put it here - makes it easier to find. My other updates are scattered in the comments.

So…definitely having one of those epiphany moments - like I have been asleep past few years and now I am awake and aware. I woke up with my husband and my son. Lazy sunday feelings :) both of my boys at the kitchen table while I made breakfast and fed them both. All of a sudden I’m just hyper aware of everything in the moment - my husband and son being silly, my husband tickling me and pranking me, my son and my husband chasing me around the kitchen. I just about peed my pants when my husband yelled “get mom!” And they both started to chase me around the kitchen.

I know it won’t be like this everyday but for the first time, I was very aware of how much power I have to make my home that safe and happy place.

A lot of people were messaging me about my friends. I haven’t spoken to them since everything happened and quite frankly - I’m terrified of anyone finding out what happened. But when me and my husband first started dating - they talked very badly about him and some of what they said made it back to my husband from a mutual friend. He had always stayed cordial with them but there was one day (years ago), my friends were over for wine at my home. My friend was in the middle of a story and my husband had just walked in the house from work. She said “can you go somewhere else, I’m telling a story!” And she basically yelled that at him (she can be obnoxiously loud). My husband absolutely flips out on her - he walked right up to her, got in her face and yelled “Who the Fuck do you think you are?! You are in my fucking house! You go somewhere else!” My husband had raised his voice at me like once ever - so I was in shock to see my husband do that.

Wine night was over to say the least haha! But ever since that moment - my husband was very openly hostile towards my friends.

Reflecting on everything that’s kinda happened - I feel very ashamed. I think I dodged a huge bullet and I hate how I have been acting, contributing so little to our marriage. Amazing how a mundane Sunday morning can at the same time, be the best thing ever. My husband forgave me, I just now need to try and forgive myself. Thank you, Reddit.

1g2iafd,https://www.reddit.com/r/projectors/comments/1g2iafd/easy_starter_tripod_screen_for_living_room/,Easy Starter Tripod Screen for Living Room,"Hi all,

  
I might be in the wrong place since I'm very much not looking for a high end setup (at least not yet). I just want to get a sense of whether a projector would be good for me and serve my needs before I commit to mounting one on my ceiling along with a motorized screen. To start, I'm going to try one of [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B092D8W3NB?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) (I'm a gamer as well as a cinephile) on my coffee table, and get a screen on a tripod that I can set up and take down relatively easily (maybe 75"" or so). 

My question is twofold: 

  
1) Are there tripod or otherwise portable screens that are easy (30s or less) to set up and take down when not in use? My ideal thought would be a tripod where I can just roll/retract the screen up, then rotate it vertically to store with the closed tripod in a corner. 

2) Is my intention here, to dip my toe in by putting the projector on a table and unfolding an easily portable screen, even really viable for testing whether I want to go further and mount? Or is it a fool's errand/incomparable to the full commitment?   
  
I ask in part because I want to make sure that the projector's range will work well for my room and setup distance before I explore stud-finding/DIY carpentry/mounting.

I could never verbalize what I feel properly. I was never good at that. Sorry for wrong grammar or spelling and for the long post. But this is mostly for the cosplay ph community huhu I'm not sure where to post it there anonymously lol. And I want to write this down. I cannot carry it anymore. I don't want him to think that I was faking everything when in reality I have always been honest.

Hello! I hope you have a prosperous artistic career and love life. I know you keep saying that you are dedicated with your art but in reality you uses that as a defense mechanism. You’re afraid to get hurt and when you hurt someone you could easily say that line. I’m not mad at you nor do I hate you. I repeat I don’t hate you and I am not mad at you. Everything I write here is in the tone of care, you know I don’t know how to raise my voice.

I hate myself for hurting you. You were my friend and friends shouldn’t hurt each other. I will forever carry the guilt that I hurt a friend. I wonder if you feel the same guilt that I do? I hope one day we’ll see each other so I can apologize properly. The last time we met I think you we’re the only one who apologized, I was so hurt I didn’t even know what was happening. All I remember is that in the end we talked about cars and how loyal you are with Mazda. It’s weird that’s all our conversation goes to, if not about cars, it’s about memes or boobs. I wished we talked about the most important parts of relationship like our goal, dreams, how we should communicate and how we really feel about each other. It’s so fucked up we both like each other. We know we like each other. Don’t deny it. I liked you and you liked me but we are too scared to admit it verbally but I want you to know I did like you very much. I wished we actually talked.

So what happened? Let’s begin:

I decline your commission because I was insecured about myself. You have no idea how insecured I was oh boy. And then you started sending me memes. You were the only one constantly talking to me thank you for that. Then you asked me to hangout. I honestly didn’t even realized it was a date I thought it was just a hangout hangout like friends do – I am that dense. And then after a few more talks we decided to agree to it. It’s weird we trusted each other from the get go, I did because I just trusted you, you were the only one who talks to me, I considered you my friend. You probably wanted to do it because of horniness regardless thank you for trusting me. But you don’t even know my name that’s because you don’t like to talk about personal matters. I would ask you about your family and childhood and you would decline, I can tell you’re sensitive to it so I didn’t push out of respect but then I ask “Is there any questions you have for me?” I thought you would ask about my family too but then you just said “What’s your breast size?” And that’s how most of our conversation goes. I don’t mind because I didn’t read too much into it. This was my first time talking with a guy. I’m not sure if it is a red flag or not. You always just want to talk about boobs and I was to scared to ask ask you the tough questions. I don’t mind us talking about nsfw stuff it was really funny but we went nowhere because most of our convo just revolves around memes and cars and that okay. I accepted the fact you love talking about breast and I won’t hold it against you. I’m glad you showed that side of you to me because there is nothing wrong with that I fully accepted you that’s why it broke my heart when you unfriended me because I created a new account, (it felt like you let go of our fun memories but you could say the same thing about me when I created a new account) more so when you deleted our entire convo. I felt like you really let go. I wasn’t gonna use that against you I’m glad you showed me the real you. I recall you even said “you finally had someone to talk breast about” lol. I don’t really know if that’s a red flag but I accepted you none the less.

I’m not even sure what trauma response this is. I want to say you didn’t know what you were doing but that would be a lie. We would meet in a mall and you’ll be in the parking lot wanting me to fetch you there only for you to touch me. We would go to the cinema and you’ll walk faster than me to follow you at the back so no one would see you touching me. I told you no multiple times not to touch me in the car or anywhere public but you still do. I guess our problem was not communication but understanding. You don’t understand consent. One yes does not mean all yes. I remember we watched Barbie and you specifically choose to sit in the back while watching you whispered to me “May gusto akong matry” Me not knowing anything just asked “Ano?” and then you just groped me. Sabi ko wag baka maymakakita sabi mo takpan ko nalang. Hinding hindi ko makakalimutan un. I kept making excuses for you. I really don’t know if it’s my fault for not setting firmer boundaries or you not really caring about me. Writing this now makes me want to cry. It’s so weird. But then I think I should be grateful cause you pay for the transpo and the tickets but all those comes with a price of touching me. Now that I write this down it truly is toxic and just downright abuse. I would like to say that we both don’t know any better but waiting in the parking lot and walking faster than me to go at the back of the cinema are pretty calculated moves. You never tell me anything. You never communicated anything. You never tell me your intention. You make everything a joke. God now that I’m writing this shit is scary but I still have the hope that if we communicated properly you wouldn’t make me feel that way because I know you care about me. Is this a victim justifying her abuser? Wth???

That’s the main issue we never really talked. But even when we talked you don’t understand it. It’s so weird.

It hurts. As what Edgar Allan Poe said “Years of love destroyed in a minute of anger”

You got too comfortable around me (which I’m glad you did. Friends should be comfortable with each other) but at the detriment of me. You being too comfortable with me made me too uncomfortable with you. Until one day you told me about that gay man when you were a child. When you told that to me I spiraled thinking about your childhood. I kept wondering if you were harmed. There are signs why you don’t talk about your families and why you don’t talk about personal stuffs so it concerned me to no end that what we might be doing is harming you more. I could not get that out of my head. You can’t tell me things like that and expect me not to care. You know how much I care about you! I stay awake at night waiting for your chat that you just got home because I care so much about you and your safety so when you told me about that part of your childhood I wanted to ask you more. I will never forget that night I was at a buffet party, it was a party but I was tearing up thinking of you and how I need to confront you with this information, it was a buffet but I barely ate because I was so concerned for you.

Until one night I couldn’t take it anymore I was so concerned that I had to beg you to meet up just for coffee and you said it’s too late for coffee let’s just checkin? It’s weird that it’s to late for coffee but not for checking? God I wish I was more stubborn and not a people pleaser in that way I would be able to tell you all my feelings and thoughts and how much I’m concerned for you! God I wish I was better at communicating then and stood my ground or that I waited a few days before I meet you but my concern for you was too much I was crying all throughout the week and so I agree. Hindi ka na kasi mayaya for coffee ng walang s\*\*ual stuffs na nangyayari. God I was so stupid not to realize that. I wish I was more mature and honest with my feelings. I care so much but not properly communicate it well.

We were hurting each other by not communicating. You and I were both the jealous type. I begged you for coffee just so we could talk but what you want is that we had to check in as well. I could never ask you to just have coffee with me anymore and just talk like friends do. I wanted to know you beyond your art.

Then I brought my gift to you. My sister and I went to Tagaytay and I saw a scalp massager and I thought about you! You were the first person I thought about because you told me you want me to massage your head. So I bought it for you. I should have just left it at home if I knew what was going to happen.

It happened so fast. I don’t even know what you we’re thinking but that was a complete violation of my trust. I just felt it. I know you stopped when I said no. I’m glad you did. But what if you didn’t? What if I froze due to fear and not said no? I wonder what you would do? Why would you even do that? Without asking for my consent? This made me think how you always do what you want without thinking about me. I was your friend, you should have at least think if I was feeling good or feeling safe.

I didn’t even eat after. I felt so sick. And again MRT was closed. I had to walk to the EDSA Carousel bus in the middle of the night, alone, thinking repeatedly what you just did.

And then we fought. I tried to tell you , you shouldn’t use a scalp massager that way but you just haha it. It all happened so fast. I’m so sorry I’m half of the reason why our relationship crumbled to the ground. Why our friendship died. You sent me those pics knowing I’m sensitive to them, knowing I told you not to. You promised me you'll never send them. I made a post and everything just broke. I’m so sorry. It happened so fast. I was scared and you were too. We didn’t know who to trust.

Then we met. I wasn’t ready yet. I still had all this sadness and pain inside of me now that all fell into pieces. It was weird. I just wanted to know more about your childhood, take a pause of what were doing because it might be hurting you. Asked you to be in therapy and be there for you all throughout the way. I never wanted us to stop being friends and more.

Then my worst suspicion was confirmed. This was the reason I was begging you to just meet when we last hangout because my heart couldn’t take it anymore. I kept thinking about your childhood and what you were going through. There were signs, why you’re not close to your siblings, why there’s an age gap and why you didn’t want to talk about it. I just wanted to get to know you more and help you as much as I can. I wanted to be there for you.

I could ask you to just forget all the things we said when I blocked you but I know the axe forgets but the tree remembers. I was crying the entire time. And I lied, I wasn’t calm, the moment I started typing I started crying. It was never my goal for to hurt you and I’m sure you didn’t want to hurt me too. I never wanted our friendship to stop and break. I said I’ll be your biggest fan and that means supporting you forever. I’ll always be here. Even after I sent that long ass chat (it’s supposed to be an email, I don’t know your email lol) I forgot to tell you thank you. I even followed up that with concern after what my coworker did. I still cared for you. Always have, always will.

The pressure of trust you gave me was something I just could carry anymore so I made a post. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. We hurt each other so much. We did bad things. We said bad things. I’ll forever carry the guilt that I hurt a friend – I wonder if you think the same?

I wish we didn’t hurt each other. I truly do. I wish we were more mindful about our actions and words. You said I needed to be in a relationship but the truth is it was you who needed it, you were the one who DMed me, you were the one who asked me out and you were the one who proposed this idea, I wish you were the one to confess too lol. I wish we waited and actually talked about ourselves more. I told you you had so much walls built around you.

In the end I want to say thank you! Thank you so much for being a friend, like for real. Thank you for trusting me. Thank you for showing your quirky side, I’m glad I get to see it. You only showed it to me because you were comfortable and I’m glad you were comfortable with me. I’m sorry I ruined that comfort. I guess I was your home. I’m really sorry. I’ll cherish those memories.

Is this another victim romanticizing and justifying her abuser? I really don’t know. And I’ll really don’t know because we never talked. In the future I hope we do. I really hope we do. I mean you did tell me the first thing you notice in a girl is their chest.

Is this me romanticizing abuse or not? I need to learn self-worth.

Give yourself a chance to be in a relationship for it and it will hopefully make you happy. You’re going to be a better husband to your wife and a better Father to your kids (if you want) more than your dad will ever be! You already are a better man than him, unless of course you include the things you did to me then I don’t know (joke) but on a serious note I wish we were friends when we were kids, I would have defended you against those scary adults that hurt you.

I don’t think your true colors was being an abuser so please don’t think I showed you my true colors like that when I was crying and hurt the whole time. If I ever hurt you through my words and actions, I’m sorry. I believed I acted the right way when SA is involved. I need to defend myself after being violated.

We might not be official but I know what we felt was real. If either of us blatantly said the words “I like you. Would you want us to be officially in a relationship now?” Either of us would jump in and said Yes! But it did not happen, we were both so weak and you hate me now. I don’t hate you. I just wanted watch movies with you. Thank you for the art! I wished you showed me your drawings of me. It broke my heart when you deleted them without me even knowing you were drawing me. You know how much I love seeing your art. It was an honor every time you show me your wips.

I was willing to go all the way with you because I trust you so much, you were my friend. I just wanted to take our time and paused because of the thing you told me about your childhood. I thought it was damaging you further. You have a problem with intimacy and that’s okay. I told you I won’t push you if you don’t want to, I just don’t understand why you have a problem with communications before you do things to me.

And No I was not really looking for a relationship, you just came into my life and things happened but please remember that no one and I mean no one needs to be in a relationship with someone before they are respected.

We took each other for granted. I can’t justify if you were just a little broken boy wanting to just be loved and accepted but I think that’s what you are. With all the money you have you can’t fix that, all you need is a companion and friend who would support you and I ruined that. I’m sorry I stood up for myself, I wish I did in a way that didn’t break us up. All the money you spent for me, I could spend that too. All I wanted was to just spend time with you talking about everything. Walking around is enough for me I swear. It’s my favorite hobby. That’s what we did in BGC remember? Watching movies or just playing video games.

I want you to know I was honest all throughout the way. Just our last hangout made me suffered from empathy fatigued. What’s important for me was not important to you. I just really wanted to talk to you that night about your childhood because again, it effed me up when you mentioned about that gay man, you can’t say things like that to me and expect me not to care (even though dampi lang yon). You know I care so much about you but you made me feel that I can no longer talk to you without having to do any s\*\*ual thing. It hurts me to know you deleted our entire convo because the is our past and I will never use that against you because I accepted who you are. It felt like you really let go of us.

Also, I know how you refer to the girl that wronged you by calling her hoe or the b word, please don’t refer to me like that, an ex-friend will do. I hate myself for saying and doing the things I did. I’m sure you hate yourself for hurting me too, right? Am I really the only one carrying the guilt of hurting a friend?

I don’t want to look back in anger. I want this to be a treasured memories even though this spiraled me into depression and made me want to ki\*\* myself. It’s okay. We both put each other in that position. I’m sorry I caused you pain. I’m sure you're sorry for causing me pain too. There is no point in wishing anymore, you can’t turn back time. As my favorite LotR quote says: “I wish it need not have happened in my time,” said Frodo. “So do I,” said Gandalf, “and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to do is decide what to do with the time that is given to us.”

Thank you for this experience. As much as hurtful this is, I can see the beauty in it. Thank you for being vulnerable with me, I would never use is against you, never have and never will. You’re my friend so I am accountable and responsible for your actions. I learned so much about myself. I’m sorry for breaking your heart. I love you too.

Man, I wanted to say soo many things this is just word vomit. This is my healing process. Please remember I never meant to hurt you. I’ve always been poetic in some sense, I guess we’re both artistic in a way.  I’ll go now but if we happen to see each other in the future, I hope we forgive each other and start all over.  Always take care!

I'll be selling all the generic things: cakes, cookies, brownies, pies, donuts, coffees, teas, etc but a friend of mine also wants to sell her new aesthetic products in my store, which I'm open to. They'll be potions from D&D with glitter, ribbons, wax, all the crazy details she can spare! So, I think I'll make the theme like a nerd cafe or something. I also want to do a cat cafe, but that seems to be more of a pipe dream since I haven't really done any planning for that and haven't thought about it much.

Name's I came up with were: Flourishing Meadow Cafe and Homestead Bakery because I have a small farm on my land and make most of my ingredients from scratch. I was also thinking about Organic Issue bakery, since it's the name Reddit chose for me and might fit the aesthetic, but it feels more orange than anything...

1g2i626,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimCorner/comments/1g2i626/marriage_he_expects_me_to_work/,"Marriage, he expects me to work? ","Salam Aleikum brothers and sisters. I have a question about marriage, gender roles, etc. Mashallah, I (f27) have met someone (m30) whom I have a great connection with. There have been a few bumps in the road but I believe we have communicated through them and I am happy to proceed and I have faith and trust in him. My next concern with him is that when I explained to him that ideally if we have multiple children, I would prefer not to work. At the most I would like to work part-time, because I do like my profession which is social work. I do like helping people and helping them improve their lives and become happier and healthier people, Alhamdulillah. However, when I explained this to him, he did not agree and said that I must work and contribute to the house. I completely disagree that I should be *required* to work, especially full-time. Because I feel that it should be my responsibility and I feel like most responsibility will naturally fall on me as I assume my natural role and fulfill my innate skills to be a caregiver for my children and also my husband. I want to care for my children, I want to have the emotional availability for my children and husband, I want to have the time to cook for our family and also to keep our house clean to my standards. I know myself, and there is absolutely no way I can work full-time and become the mother or wife that I would love to be, and then have the energy to also workout and take care of my body.

On top of this, I have non-negotiables when it comes to my health that is best for me and the greater good of my family. Every now and then I need time for myself in peace, maybe an hour to read at a coffee shop, and also about 5-10 hours per week to work out. Running is a passion of mine, it makes me happy, feel good, and feel healthy, and also pilates.

I have a large concern with the fact that at the beginning of this journey with him he seems adamant that I must work, no hesitation. 

I know that as a woman, and knowing myself, I have a certain amount of emotional and physical thresholds. I can swear to you now, that I will not be able to work full-time, tend to all of my children and husbands needs, and take care of the house, and then also spend several hours a week taking care of my own health and physical health. I feel like what he expects in terms of working and caregiving is not realistic for me to handle. If I am honest, only in my personal opinion, I feel men should provide, and that it is simply a bonus if your wife contributes. I am not an expensive girl, I don't need all fancy cars and brand name clothing, or thousands of dollars annually on my esthetic such as hair and nails, I feel beautiful naturally Alhamdullilah. I am happy with a healthy, happy home and maybe a small garden. That is all I need. What I am saying is, I don't ask for much. He doesn't need to be rich. Where we live, he would be able to manage our life on his own, for sure. 

When I explained to him that I would rather work part-time maximum, so I could focus on the family and the household, he said he did not agree, I must work, and that it will be OK because we would be splitting all responsibilities. He would be helping me with childrearing, cleaning etc. I believe that he will. But I also internally believe that women and men are different. I don't mean to sound sexist, but I feel like there are things to do in terms of childrearing, caregiving and cleaning that men just don't understand and he is underestimating what it will take. 

Brothers and sisters my question to you is do you think that I am being sexist or possibly overthinking this? Or, am I right in thinking that it would be best for me and my family if I would part-time at most. If so, how do I navigate this conversation with him? What if he doesn't change his mind? Must I let him go to find someone who is on the same page as him?

[Bambino & Eureka Mignon Manuale]","I have had a Bambino (non Plus) for a year now. All I want is a decent cup of espresso. But all I have been able to produce is sour shots.

I enjoy espresso black or with a scoop of sugar, I have no interest in milk drinks (hence I got the non plus bambino).

At first I tried using pre-ground with the pressure basket. Was terrible.

I added bottomless porta filters, puck screen, different baskets to try 14g-20g doses. WDT tools, spring loaded tamps, etc.

I was having issues with my existing grinder not getting fine enough to allow a shot to pull at 25-32s for a 1:2, was always too fast of an extraction.

I upgraded grinder to a Eureka Mignon Manuale. Wow, now I can finally go TOO fine and choke the machine. Dial it down to where I can successfully get shots to hit 30s and 1:2.

But STILL sour, I have yet to even EXPERIENCE an over extraction.

I have read blogs, watched days worth of videos, and practices it all. My only conclusion at this point is the Bambino doesn't get hot enough by what I have read. I have tried all the tips, run an empty porta filter. Keep the porta filter in hot water between uses. Run the steam wand right before extracting and do a quick purge of the steam in builds up. I am getting marginally better results from all this, which is great, but hundreds spent on tools and even MORE spent on coffee I am just at my limit. I have gone through BAGs of coffee. I don't think anything I have gotten is light roast. Medium to Dark is what I'd say. But all this time I can't figure it out and want to blame this on a machine issue for my own sanity. 

My process:

I have found my grinder ""Zero point"", I'll dial it back a few notches (while running of course!), and start to dial in a 14g shot to get 30g out in 28-32s. I grind ""hot"" letting the beans hit the burrs while it's on. I start with the only change being grind size until I get the ""ratio"" to work then tatse and go from there.  I am able to get the 1:2 ratio in 30 seconds and it's sour. I try to hit a 1:3 in 30 seconds its sour. I try these ratios at 35s still sour.... I feel my puck prep is totally adequate (have had hundreds of times to get better at it at this point). I don't see any signs of channeling with watching the bottom of the porta filter or when I dump the puck. I have tried with and without the puck screen, although I seem to find it works best with and it leaves the machine cleaner so I like that.

My latest adventure I just spent half my Saturday going through an entire bag of Tony's Sugar Bee and sure if I load it with sugar and milk it's fine, but do that to anything it would be good. I have a bag of Equator Jaguar and Tigerwalk with a roast date of 3 days ago to probably waste next. Before I do though I figured reaching out for help. Because I don't even know what to do at this point.

My plan is the try dialing in the Jaguar, I figure that is a ""proper"" dark roast and would hopefully be a test as my understanding darker roasts are easier to prevent under extraction. But before I do I am hoping to get any feedback, tips, so I can try and finally make a shot of proper extracted espresso.

Or else I am about to go sell my car and buy a new machine with proper PID because i don't know what else to do, and all I want is that shot of espresso I would get when vacationed in Italy, with my little spoon of sugar and 1 second of thick heaven to start the day.",2,1728795041.0,espresso,7,1.0,False

I'm not the same person as when we first met. This year has changed my perspective, on so many things. On Everything. I pause with sadness when i recall a time when i confessed to you in tears that even the thought of the future i'm currently living, brought on nothing but the deepest and darkest feelings of pure dread..

A future, without you..

His gone, now, though. Suffocated by his unquenched need for connection and honesty. He had hope. He had the illusion that help existed. That trust was something not to be broken. That as a whole, things in life will pan out. But at every turn, people saw weakness and took advantage. Hands cautiously put out for help were slapped away and scolded for trying. Even hired help does nothing but hand ball in a system as nothing but a number.

It would of been so painful to read how ""fucking hard"" you've been trying to move on if he was still here. He would of felt a black hole in his stomach, a mind spinning out of control with guilt and confusion, an overwhelming pit of sadness into which he could curl and comfort himself. After all, your actions sound based in anger, in retribution. Your temper may not be loud, or have much to say, but this last year has taught me you can twist a knife without a word and the only sound will be my scream. God only knows what you've done to try ""so fucking hard to move on"". I'm sure i don't want to know.

And thats kind of the point, right? There was a time when i wanted to know everything. I wanted to be there just to see you succeed irrespective of \*what\* that success was. And now, there are entire relationships in your life that were built on the back of my misery. Entire time periods where your actions where dictated by trying to forget me. And i want nothing to do with any of it. I don't ever want to hear that delinquent degenerate ""roommate"" of yours name, ever, let alone all the low IQ horse shit that narcissist grandpa spews. Not to mention everything else. Betrayal truely does force you to completely re-evaluate how you see people.

And who am i now? Definitely not the social butterfly you've blossomed into, thats for sure. I bet his over the top peter pan excitement over the most mundane of shit must be refreshing. I too, sometimes revel in the joy a stick brings to a dog, sometimes i even wish i was simple enough to enjoy it myself. But alas, people, sticks and low IQ crack heads, just arn't for me. I'd rather be alone than hang out where everything is edited to look good or has a fucking filter on it, where the world is a glistening piece of candy, feed with toxic ass positivity because im too stupid to work out an editing program without a 4 year degree.

I told you day one he'd put on a full show to stop you looking backstage. But you still pay rent to a guy who calls you ""his problem"" behind your back, and who ""rents"" his family home from his ""whore"" of a landlord, his mother.

But then, thats just it, I was always the problem wasn't I?

Do you remember what you consoled me with in those few weeks? Let me remind you. I was holding you back. I was the cause of your depression, because when you're with him you find yourself asking ""am i even depressed?"". You wanted a life partner, a team mate. Just only on his team. Because the team work we had wasnt good enough. Or in your eyes, didnt even exist. My inability to help myself, turned into me not \*wanting\* to help myself. My suffering, turned into an emotional weapon used to beat you. My hesitation in opening myself to you, just plain me not wanting you. Our relationship dynamic, an excuse for treating me without respect. Your actions, only invoked by me. You only did everything because I wanted you to. You hadn't been happy for most of our relationship. I was to blame for your car. I made your life difficult. My reaching out after you ghosted me with my car, harassment. Always interrupting you ""getting on with your day"".

What still gets me is the speed. I'm not 100% convinced you two didn't premeditate this tbh. That reddit account, pretty good timing. The other option being you genuinely believed in less that 24hr that you had found a better connection than ours built over 2.5 years.

Realistically, they're both as bad as each other. And makes it clear just how much i meant and what i'm worth.

You left to heal, to work on yourself.. and you were never even alone. Not even a single night.

I miss who i was with you, i miss being able to find joy in doing the small things. Bringing you coffee in bed, holding your hand while i drove you places, encouraging you to keep painting because what you do is amazing. I miss feeling safe, feeling like i had a partner. A friend. A soul mate.

But really, i don't know who \*you\* are mourning, it's been evident since you walked out that you had no idea who i was - those were your words. You took his words as oath. While my words, confessing my love to you each and every day, expressing how beautiful and how proud of you i was, and how exceptionally happy being with you made me, as you so eloquently put it that day on the patio, ""weren't worth anything, i have no idea who you are"". But you did know who i was, it was just through his vision.

Funny how you weren't mourning when i was in tears at your doorstep. You say you held on hope for so long, but thats all you did. You never reached out. We both know why.

But yes, whatever, mourn the person who you thought i was before this stranger i am to you now.

Because i too, am mourning the stranger i am to myself. I just chose to do it alone, instead of in the arms of someone else..

But like you say, it is what it is..",6,1728794697.0,letters,13,0.88,False

I’m waiting for the call. Lots of cigarettes and coffee; phone in hand. It’s always this way. The call comes after six in the morning. They finally found the family.

- 

My car won’t start. I have no idea what’s wrong with it. I have to call a cruiser. I’m going to be late to my own crime scene. 

-

My partner is already on scene. He’s one in a room full of cops, all sick to their stomachs observing the work of a serial killer. 

My work.

Six years of doing this, and I’m still turned on by it. Coming back to the scene, still in charge of it, but from a different side. I keep my coat buttoned to hide how hard I am. 

My partner gives me the rundown. A family butchered and then all the pieces are stitched back together in a mismatched mass. No blood. They still don’t know how I do that, but to be fair, it took me years to figure it out.

As he talks, I survey the room. Everything is perfect. Exactly how I left it. A work of art.

Wait.

The stuffed teddy bear in the corner is facing away from the family. That’s not right. 

My heart drops. My scene was tampered with.

“Did you hear what I said, Joe?” I give my attention back to my partner. As he talks, I keep thinking about the bear. My throat tightens.

It’s not right.

“...let himself in through the kids window…”

I nod. I’m starting to sweat. Why is the bear facing the wrong way?!

“...switched out the eyes…”

My eye twitches. I inch toward the bear. Maybe someone hit it with their foot? 

No. 

It’s clearly the exact opposite of where I had it.

“They’ll be in to take the pictures in a few minutes.”

“Wait! What?!” 

“Pictures, Joe. Did you not get enough coffee?”

Pictures?! My scene is wrong! Someone shit on my canvas!I can’t let them take pictures! It’s all fucking wrong!

“Joe?!”

“What?!”

“Did you bite your lip? You’re bleeding.” 

My partner ushers everyone out of the room. I stay behind. I take the only chance I have. I reach down and grab the bear. I turn around, and my partner is staring at me. He’s holding his gun.

“What are you doing, Joe?”

“I thought I saw something, but I didn’t.”

“Then put the teddy bear back. We need to take pictures of the scene.”

I swallow. My hands are shaking. The bear stares back at me.

“Put it back.”

“No… it’s not right.”

“Make it face the wall, Joe.” 

“My work.”

“I’ve had my suspicions for a while now. You were late, so I took a chance and moved it myself. I figured it would drive you nuts.”

“Fuck you!”

I pull my gun and his bullet slams into my chest.

With my dying breath, I reach over and face the bear toward the family. 

My work is done.

1g2ht0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/1g2ht0h/cleaning_out_dads_house_hes_fine_just_moved_to/,"Cleaning out Dad's house (he's fine, just moved to assisted living)","Fair warning -- I tend to be wordy, lol, so this will be a fairly long post. Mostly just me venting, I suppose. I would prefer to add flair saying ""in progress"", but there isn't any, so I marked it as ""success story"".

My Dad is in his early 80s, and while he's not in bad health for a guy his age, he has also never taken care of his health or even gone to doctors -- it's actually amazing that his health is as relatively good as it is. Anyway, my sister and I have been trying to get him to move closer to us for at least 5 years -- his house, where we grew up, is about 1.5 hours from where we live now. As he's aged, he's developed mobility issues, he's fallen a number of times, etc., and as a result of his last fall we *finally* convinced him to move, and found a *great* assisted living apartment for him, so that's all working out very well, thankfully.

That was the hard part. Now comes the rest -- he cared for his house about as well as he cared for himself, and even when we lived there he never repaired anything or fixed up the house or cleaned, but it was reasonably liveable because at least my sister and I cleaned.  After we moved out (years ago; we're both in our 50s now) the house *really*  went downhill, and he sort of semi-hoarded -- he does have some hoarding tendencies, but with him it was really mostly a matter of not being sufficiently mobile to do any cleaning or putting stuff away, on top of his never having really done much of that anyway.  SO, now me, my sister, and my brother-in-law are having to go to the house every week or two and clear out all the crap. We moved a few pieces of furniture into Dad's assisted living apartment -- pieces that he likes and which are in good shape -- we've donated a couple of pieces of furniture, and we will be throwing out most of the furniture (it's not in good shape, it really is trash), via one of those junk removal companies. We've brought our Dad's books and cameras up to him (he was a professional photographer for years), his personal items, etc. -- but not much else, so that his new apartment stays neat, clean and organized, while still being homey for him.  Thankfully, he's ok with all that. 

So far my sister and BIL have made about 5 trips down, and I've gone with them on 2 trips (I can't go with them during the week, due to work, but I go with them for the trips on the weekends).  We have gotten rid of and are still getting rid of *SO* much stuff! So far I've taken one big box of donated kitchen stuff to the thrift shop, and in my trunk currently are two more boxes of kitchen stuff (his new apartment has a small kitchen area, but just with a sink, microwave, small fridge, and cabinets/drawers -- no stove, as all meals are provided by the facility, but of course he has the fridge and cabinets for snacks, beverages, etc.). There's at least one more box of kitchen items in my sister's garage, and two more boxes of kitchen stuff still at the house (we couldn't fit any more in the cars). Because my Dad never cleaned, and because he used to do a lot of cooking and had a lot of cookware, pots, gadgets, etc., and since his mobility issues eventually kept him from cooking (we arranged a Meals-on-Wheels sort of thing), there was sooo much, and it was so dusty and somewhat grimy, so I had to wash *every* item (while my sister and her husband were clearing out other rooms). We made one of the trips today, and were down there for about 5 hours just cleaning, sorting, throwing out, etc. Many of the kitchen gadgets we just had to throw out, because they were so gross. Those that were ok we cleaned and will donate (crockpot, rice cooker, toaster oven, etc.).  We're donated lots of pots/pans, dishes, mugs, Pyrex (new food storage containers), colanders, coffee and teapots, about 20 good Mason jars, etc. 

All this is a pain in the ass. If our Dad had kept up with the house, this whole process would be so much easier, but at least it is doable. We will be selling the house (likely to a flipper who will take it down to studs, rebuild, and sell), and the money will be used to pay for his assisted living place.

For those of you in similar situations, even if not so extreme, definitely try to get your elderly parents to sort through their stuff while they're still in relatively good health and able to make decisions regarding their own stuff. We are so thankful that our Dad is in a much better living situation now, for his sake and because we can see him much more often now (the place is only about 15 minutes away from us), but also because he is able to weigh in on what he wants to do with the stuff that's important to him.

Ok, end of vent for today, lol.  I'm exhausted.

And a couple months ago we had a big fight, we have never fought before and we haven’t fought since. This all started January 2024. So one day I was at a church young adults event and I was hanging out with two of my friends, let’s call them Sophie and Jill, and we decided that we should hang out again the following Thursday because we had all just gotten our licenses and wanted to meet up (this was on a Friday) so the Thursday rolls around and we haven’t made any plans yet, and for me Thursday was crazy cuz my mom wanted to switch fridges and it was so chaotic and we had been working on this for hours atp, it was about 7 pm. So Jill texts me and asks if I wanted to go to Walmart with her and her younger sister and my sister, I said yes and right as I was about to leave, Sophie calls me and asked if I wanted to hang out and I said I couldn’t cuz I was going to Walmart with Jill, and I could tell she was hurt but I didn’t invite her cuz I knew my mom didn’t want me out super late ( I just recently got my licence) and I needed to keep cleaning. So we got to Walmart and we left Walmart within 20 mins and I got home within 30 mins of leaving my house, because I new I wouldn’t take forever, I didn’t invite Sophie, that and it wasn’t my plan, I didn’t plan anything and I didn’t want to ruin anything Jill had planned. So I got home, cleaned and went to bed, but the next morning I woke up and I had this huge paragraph from Sophie telling me I was a bitchy friend for not inviting her and that I was an awful person, so I was stunned and shocked and heart broken. We ended up calling that same day and an hour after the call she texted another paragraph telling me I was “victimizing myself” meaning I said I was hurt and I was crying and that I was still a bitch. So after that text I didn’t respond and just tried forgetting, but she texted even madder cuz I left her I on read. So we ended up going for coffee and talked it out, but the thing is, I really didn’t get any closure cuz I apologized and I explained myself and I forgot to bring up what she did cuz I hate fighting and I hate losing friends so I just wanted to forgive and forget. But now, 10 months later I can feel those feeling are still there and I don’t want to bring it up to her cuz she is a very manipulative person and she is also a gaslighter so she would make me feel like it’s my fault, and I can feel that these feelings are affecting how I think about her and are affecting the quality of the relationship.

Couldn’t ask for a better start to the week, right? 😂

Anyway, I’m 23, just joined the exciting world of corporate life (which basically means trading my soul for a paycheck, one coffee at a time). I’ve moved to a new city too, and trying to keep up with the pace of this place is like running a marathon while juggling flaming bowling pins. But enough about my adulting struggles, let’s talk about something more fun!

A little about me: I’m into anime (who isn’t these days?), manga, chess (I promise not to make the first move too quickly 😏), trekking, and traveling. Oh, and I recently became single, but no worries—I’m not here for romance, just a chill chat. Let’s vibe!

But let’s make a pact: if you slide into my DMs, don’t be that one person who just says “hey” and leaves it at that. At least tell me about your day or your weirdest hobby. Let’s keep things fun, yeah? Also, I’d appreciate it if you're around 20+—maturity is always a bonus, but hey, I’m down to chat with anyone!

# The Way of the Ishtarite: An Inclusive Guide to Worship of Inanna-Ishtar by Siri Nin

[Paperback $15 \(left\) and Hardcover $50 \(right\) editions.](https://preview.redd.it/hqtv6h9rtfud1.jpg?width=3519&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e8c6cd536013fa20e48f0b74f890e564dee5b77)

[The definitive LGBTQ+ inclusive guide for anyone looking to worship the Ancient Mesopotamian Sumerian and Akkadian Goddess Inanna-Ishtar. This book teaches you all about this Goddess of Divine Femininity and instructs you on the basics of forming your own spiritual practice in the style of Mesopotamian Polytheistic Paganism, complete with selections of her most important Stories, Prayers, and Rituals.](https://preview.redd.it/ny5pbgg39gud1.png?width=2809&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b715cef3e8251c2284b48990526da748dc81028)

This book represents the culmination of all my efforts to forge a comprehensive yet approachable, informative, and spiritually transformative guide to building your own meaningful and fulfilling pagan practice centered on devotion to 𒀭Inanna-Ishtar. My main goal for this book is for it to contribute towards filling the unfortunate void in literature that is inclusive beginner and intermediate level instructional books for the Mesopotamian Polytheistic Pagan. From the very start I set out to write a book that not only caters to the inclusivity required by a Neurodivergent, Intersex, Transgender, and Queer feminist woman such as myself, but to also create a book that is equally as welcoming and meaningfully representational of all people regardless of their sex, gender, sexuality, neurotype, or heritage. Writing this book has been a labor of love and an act of passionate devotion, 𒀭Inanna and all she represents and champions has literally saved my live many times over, and it is my greatest joy to continue to serve her by sharing this work with the world.

I consider myself to be a ""Reconstructionist-Inspired Revivalist"" and that is how I would categorically define the academic approach and interpretive tone of the practice-building instructional information contained within my book. I intentionally did not at any point outlay a set of directive instructions for the new pagan to follow blindly in order to build their practice as an echo of my own because it is my sincerest belief that every practitioner should develop a practice that is truly their own, not a copy of someone else's. This is not a ""Loving Inanna-Ishtar for Dummies"" book, but it is a thoughtful and comprehensive manual for building your own practice that will bring you close to the Goddess whom I love so very much, while hopefully bringing her close to you in ways that are unique to you. I meticulously included all of the core activities that a meaningful and fulfilling devotional practice should in my opinion contain, while also including all of the reasoning behind those activities, and the nuanced perspectives and context that one needs to perform them for themselves and not just because the author says so. I included a wealth of foundational information so that anyone, regardless of spiritual or religious background, can pick up this book without having any prior knowledge about *our* Goddess and get to know her. I also included context about how her worshipers in ancient Mesopotamia practiced, so that the meaning behind their spiritual ways of life can be brought back to life in one's own practice today. I endeavored to always keep information concise and direct to the point so that there are no excessively long chapters or meandering passages for the reader to get lost within.

This book starts off by clearly describing my intentions for this book, and my background and a bit about the circumstances of my writing this book. It then includes a very brief primer about reading and pronouncing Sumerian and Akkadian words, and goes on to talk about the symbology of 𒀭Inanna, who the Anunnaki are, the theological context of her family ties and variations in belief, the world ordering and theological schema of reality, and finally eschatology. Then the the reader reaches the heart of the book which contains a selection of mythos and stories about our Goddess with included interpretations to their meaning and their context within one's practice, why one would want to begin a practice devoted to 𒀭Inanna, and how some people choose to execute their practice, followed by the spiritual Tenets and Paths of Worship of an Ishtarite - someone who is devoted to 𒀭Inanna. The conclusion of the book focuses on information about, instructions for, and examples of Ishtarite Prayer, Rituals, and development of one's own Ishtaric practice. Below you can see the full Table of Contents and several sample images from the book.

Vendors & Distributors:  
Two vendors are available currently, with expanded global distribution coming in the following months. Currently you can buy my books direct from my publisher, Lulu, and from my distributor Amazon.

All sales made through Amazon are are subject to high distribution expenses and I'm projected to make less than the cost of a gas station cup of coffee on each sale. I chose to distribute my books globally through Amazon and to charge the absolute minimum price allowed of me because I want my books to help as many people as possible, I do not want to withhold my knowledge from those who are on a tight budget.
