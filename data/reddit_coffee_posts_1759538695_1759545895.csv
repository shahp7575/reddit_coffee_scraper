I drink lots of coffee to balance out the liver-damaging effects. Europeans drink more than Americans and they live longer. I only drink Friday and Saturday to get drunk, and then have a couple at lunch Sunday but none Monday through Thursday. And if it ever does get out of hand I'll just go to rehab. But frankly I stay under the 14 unit a week max that the CDC has put in place. I do think I'm a weekend alcoholic mind you, but I think it's a calculated risk that won't take too many years off my life. I'd rather party like fuck every weekend and die 5 years earlier than lice 5 years longer and not party like fuck. What do you think?",1,1759545545.0,AskMen,4,1.0,False

I’m leaning toward green tea because it has lower caffeine and contains L-theanine.

Interestingly, I sometimes drink a Celsius or an Alani, and it doesn’t really make me feel extra anxious, not nearly as bad as coffee. That makes me wonder if it’s something specific about coffee and not just caffeine.

1nxi8qt,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nxi8qt/why_wont_my_portable_mug_warmer_turn_on_properly/,Why won't my portable mug warmer turn on properly?,"Hey everyone! I've been dealing with this frustrating issue with my mug warmer lately, and I thought I'd share my experience and what I learned along the way. Maybe this can help someone else who's facing similar problems.

So, I got this portable mug warmer a few months ago because I was tired of my coffee getting cold while I work. At first, it worked great, but then it started acting up. Sometimes it wouldn't turn on, and other times it would shut off randomly. Super annoying, right?

After some research and testing, I discovered several common reasons why mug warmers might not work properly:

1. Power Connection Issues
The most basic problem is often the power source. Make sure the USB cord (if it's USB-powered) is firmly connected and not damaged. Also, check if you're using the right voltage adapter. Some mug warmers need specific power requirements to function correctly.

2. Surface Detection Problems
Many modern mug warmers have automatic sensors that only activate when they detect a mug. If your cup isn't making proper contact with the heating surface, it won't turn on. Sometimes, the bottom of your mug needs to be completely flat for the warmer to work properly.

3. Auto-Shutdown Feature
This one caught me off guard - many mug warmers have built-in safety features that shut them off after a certain time. I thought mine was broken, but it was just the auto-shutdown doing its thing.

After dealing with these issues, I decided to upgrade to a more reliable model I found on Amazon (https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer). The difference has been night and day - no more cold coffee!

Here are some maintenance tips I've learned to keep your mug warmer working properly:

- Clean the heating surface regularly
- Check for loose connections
- Use mugs with flat bottoms
- Keep it away from water or spills
- Don't leave it plugged in 24/7

If you're still having issues with your current mug warmer and want something more reliable, I highly recommend checking out this model (https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer). It's been working perfectly for me for the past few weeks.

One last thing - don't forget to check your warranty if your mug warmer is relatively new. Sometimes what seems like a malfunction might be covered under warranty, and you could get a replacement.

What's your experience with mug warmers? Have you found any other solutions to keep them working properly? Let me know in the comments!",1,1759544877.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

1nxi6zn,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/1nxi6zn/leaves_of_november/,Leaves of November,"About Me:
Hey! I’m looking for a creative and detailed writing partner interested in slow-burn romance, character development, and immersive storytelling. I write in third-person, multi-paragraph style, and I’m hoping to find someone who loves tension, subtle emotional build-up, and characters with depth and flaws. My character is a rugged Marine stationed in New York — tough on the outside, emotionally closed-off, but deeply human.

Prompt Setup:
📍 Staten Island, NYC — Early November.

Cody  (M, 28), a battle-hardened Marine home on station for a few months, is used to noise, discipline, and distance. Life has been reduced to schedules, deployments, and moments of solitude that feel more like survival than peace.

One morning during his run, he stumbles across a second-grade teacher taking her class on a fall scavenger hunt. He wasn’t looking for a distraction — especially not someone so warm, grounded, and full of life. But somehow, the way she talks to her students, the way she lights up when they discover a red oak leaf, lodges itself in his mind.

Their worlds couldn’t be more different — she lives by lesson plans and laughter, while he’s haunted by things he never talks about. Still, week by week, they cross paths, text, grab coffee. A fling sparks — unexpected and magnetic.

But when emotions creep in, Cody starts pulling away, falling back into old habits: bar hookups, detachment, pretending he doesn’t care. Only to realize what he’s been running from… might be exactly what he’s been missing.

What I’m Looking For in a Partner:
	•	You’d play the teacher (F) — bright, emotionally intelligent, maybe a little guarded from her own past.
	•	You enjoy character-driven scenes, not just romance but real life moments — field trips, quiet dinners, small fights, and even holiday events.
	•	Slow burn! This isn’t insta-love. Let’s build tension, hesitation, longing, and vulnerability over time.
	•	Bonus points if you love seasonal vibes (cozy fall aesthetics, snow-covered sidewalks, Christmas tree lots, classroom crafts, etc).

Potential Scenes/Ideas to Explore:
	•	Thanksgiving dinner invite: she wants him to come, but he flakes — regret ensues
	•	A Christmas school event where he shows up last-minute to surprise her
	•	A snowstorm strands them together in a cabin or her apartment — finally forcing a heart-to-heart
	•	He buys her a thoughtful Christmas gift that shows how much he’s been paying attention — even if he can’t yet say “I love you”

Other Info:
	•	21+ partners only please — romance will include mature themes (emotionally and potentially physically)
	•	Third-person, multi-paragraph (no one-liners)
	•	Comfortable writing emotionally complex, flawed characters
	•	Flexible posting pace — 2–4 replies a week ideal

1nxi4e1,https://www.reddit.com/r/alberta/comments/1nxi4e1/education_has_struggled_long_before_the_ucp_heres/,"Education has struggled long before the UCP - here’s why it’s worse, and much more urgent.","Alberta, we need your help. I’m begging you to help us. Your age, job, income, religious beliefs - whether you are a parent or not - are irrelevant. All of us will suffer if we continue down this path. 

I’m a school administrator who works in a program that has more resources than most. I am fortunate. My staff are fortunate. My students and families deserve the support we provide. The criminal lack of resources in our schools is absolutely critical, but there is something more that you need to know about what the UCP is doing. Despite all my resources and my power, I can’t protect my students from this government. 

This means more than a bad year for a few kids. This is lasting, significant destruction of our collective population. The students and you and me. 

I need the general public to understand what the UCP has done to education. Classroom size and complexity are huge issues that they inherited. What I need to do is tell you the things that the UCP didn’t inherit. The things being done to our children and to us. All I will say about salary is that MLAs have had a 119% increase in wages in the last 15 years, and teachers have accepted a 0% pay raise twice in order to maintain classroom funding grants. Grants that have been removed, along with public reporting of classroom sizes. 

I have to acknowledge the many issues with UCP governance that go beyond education. It feels like a horrible, overwhelming game of wack a mole: AISH, healthcare, incompetent spending, corruption, Indigenous rights, the LGBTQ+ community, our economy, the environment - and more still. 

I know that education is not the only urgent concern in our province. But please understand that education is the road that leads to all others. There are no health care workers, no CEOs, no small businesses, no farmers, no services, no progress and no protections without education. There are no teachers without education. 

I want to walk you through my days. I want you to see a first hand account of the repercussions and consequences of allowing the UCP to continue to destroy us. I want you to feel the urgency and fear that I feel because we need your help.

I want you to watch while I tell my teachers that we have to use hours of time we don’t have to comb through their books and remove them from their classrooms based on vague notions of “classics” and subjective views of “sexually explicit” materials. Books that they read to anxious children in the comfy chair that they thrifted and made their partner set up with them over the weekend. Books that make a child feel safe, books that show them that their family is beautiful the way it is. Books that help them be brave, books that show them they’re not alone, books that help them respond to the unknown with curiosity and love rather than hatred and fear. Make no mistake, the fact that they walked it back (not enough) doesn’t mean they won’t try it again. Soon. They didn’t need to “clarify” - they changed it because they got caught. 

I want you to see our kids as they look at the shelves and see where a book they love used to be and hunch their shoulders as they walk to their desks. Subdued, silent and afraid of what will be taken away next. The book ban is just that - a ban. We must provide lists and answer questions, justify our educational choices to unqualified government appointees. The workload for this is immense and serves to exhaust us into compliance. It serves to sew distrust between us and the families we serve. The people that dedicate their lives to your children are painted as untrustworthy, incompetent pornography peddlers. 

We can no longer be trusted to select educational materials about sexual health. Instead, I must now spend hours filling out forms to apply for approval of resources that aren’t in the sparse and incomplete list provided by people who have never set foot into a classroom for non promotional purposes. 

I want you to sit with me while I tell a beautiful, vibrant, brave child that she must stay silent or be outed. Outed by me. The person who has always told her she matters and is safe with me. Watch her look away from me and tell me it’s “fine”. Watch her stop coming by my office to have tea with me. Watch me lose her. 

I want you to watch me tell my staff that they have to deadname a child while they stare at the floor and prepare to harm a child because I told them they have to. I want you to watch them stumble over their words as they try to use “sweetheart” and “friend” - anything but the deadname. I want you to watch that child shrink away from them, now nameless. 

I want you to watch me sign the form that forces me to agree to make my families tell me that their daughter was assigned female at birth. If I don’t, none of my students can participate in athletics. Girls sports teams are already folding - low registration has resulted in significantly fewer female teams. No games, nothing. I want you to see the students that don’t bring the form back, don’t try out for volleyball, and don’t come to school at all that day. Watch them as they stay home for longer and longer. Watch as I desperately encourage them to hang on. Watch when I fail to reach them all. One is too many. 

I want you to watch grown adults narrow their eyes at a girls basketball game, obviously focusing on the athlete that looks too masculine to them. You need to know that people can report, in writing, if they think an athlete playing on a girls team was not born female. I want you to see her face turn red and tears roll down her cheeks. Watch her quit the team. Watch her begin to wear baggy clothes and skip lunch. I want you to watch how the adults who humiliated her make her hate herself. Watch me lose her, too. 

Watch my teachers stop laughing with each other. Watch them use their time together to quietly talk about finding ways around the policies. Watch them deflate as they see that there is no magic loop hole, no middle ground, no options. Watch them stare into the distance during professional development because they don’t have any room left to learn something new. Watch me adjust their schedules, watch me reallocate resources, watch me bring them coffee and focus on the little wins, watch me as they cry in my office. Watch me cry with them, and then lose them too.

Watch as I spend countless hours reading UCP policies, writing my own awful policies because I must. Watch as I try to track accountability and communicate changes, watch me monitor compliance and die inside every time I do. Watch me fall behind with the real work - connecting with vulnerable students, debriefing with staff after a hard day, calling a parent who’s seeking help, applying for grants and finding field trips, cheering on our basketball team and popping into classrooms. Watch as I get up early and work late into the evening, spending hours on the weekends trying to keep up. Watch me spend more and more time away from my family. 

I can’t sleep, I barely eat, and I’m far from the only one. Watch as I question my ability to continue doing the thing that I love so much. 

These are not experiences that are unique to me. In fact, I have more resources and support at my disposal than most administrators. I really thought that this would mean I could find a way to at least protect my little community of kids. I want so badly to somehow stop this. I can’t see any way to save my kids or my staff or myself. 

Teachers will burn out even faster. The profession will take too much from even the most dedicated educators. The quality of instruction in our classrooms will tank. Something has to give and it shouldn’t be our kids. It needs to be the people who refuse to stop hurting them. 

We’re hurting our children in real and lasting ways. This kind of damage is not temporary and has profound effects. These kids cannot grow into adults that form relationships, find work and become the next generation of people that make things better. We are failing them and in turn they will fail us when we need them. 

I don’t really know what all of you can do to stop this, either. I guess I’m hoping that if enough people really see how truly awful things are, they will understand and start talking, posting, calling, showing up at offices. I’m telling everyone I know and encouraging outraged families to contact their representatives. If enough of us sound the alarm over and over, and more national attention puts a spotlight on these monsters, maybe we can stop them.

I've been advised to trial a low carbohydrate diet to see if it helps digestive issues I've had.  

I will be consulting a dietician but having realized the milk and sugar in  my daily coffees and teas is over 25g of carbs I thought I would ask here for some suggestions.

I have found Allulose at Woolworths which will hopefully solve the sugar substitute issue.  Will be buying some next week.  An advantage of this is that unlike the sugar alcohols this won't have a negative effect on my SIBO.

As for a milk substitute / creamer for coffee and tea  I tried an unsweetened Soy milk (Vitasoy) but it gave the coffee and tea a weird taste.

Is there a milk or creamer that has a creamy neutral taste?  

I understand some people use double cream?  But I'd prefer something I can pour if possible.  Having had Gall Bladder surgery I have to be careful regards to fat content as well.

Hydration is a cheat code for performance, mood, and presence. Try this test today: drink 20–30 oz on waking, another 20–30 oz by lunch, then tell me your brain isn’t sharper and your body isn’t looser.

# What You Unlock When You’re Fully Hydrated

**Mental Edge**

* Sharper focus and memory
* Less brain fog
* Better decisions under pressure
* Calmer stress response

**Physical Output**

* More strength, endurance, and pump
* Faster recovery
* Fewer cramps, less joint irritation
* Better hormone regulation

**Sleep & Energy**

* Deeper sleep
* Easier wake-ups
* Stable energy across the day
* Fewer afternoon crashes

**Skin & Appearance**

* Clearer, tighter skin
* Less under-eye puff
* Healthier lips, hair, and nails
* Glowy instead of dry and dull

**Sexual Performance**

* Better blood flow and erection strength
* More stamina
* Improved sensitivity control
* Higher natural lubrication and output

**Internal Function**

* Smoother digestion and bowel movements
* Kidney and liver support
* Fewer infections from better fluid balance
* More efficient nutrient absorption

# Hydration Game: Cheat Codes

**1) Start With 20–30 oz on Waking**  
Before food or coffee. You wake up dehydrated by default. Rehydrating first flips your system back on.

**2) Add Minerals So Water Actually Absorbs**  
Pure water flushes. Water with minerals hydrates.  
Quick mix at home:

* 24–32 oz water
* Pinch of salt (Himalayan or sea)
* Squeeze of lemon or a splash of 100% juice
* Optional: a clean electrolyte packet

**3) Daily Target That Scales**

* Minimum: half your bodyweight in ounces
* Add 20 oz per hour of training
* Add 8–12 oz for each caffeinated drink
* Add 16 oz for each alcoholic drink

**4) Pair It With Habits**

* Before meals
* After peeing
* While scrolling
* Between sets

**5) Go Warm or Room Temp**  
Better absorption, smoother digestion, less bloat. Cold can slow digestion, especially in the morning.

**6) Watch Your Urine**

* Light yellow = on track
* Dark = behind
* Crystal clear all day = probably overdoing it

**7) Stack It With Your Supplements**

* L-citrulline feels stronger with solid hydration
* Beet powder flows better with water
* Zinc picolinate, magnesium glycinate, creatine all need water to move and do work
* Sleep and blood flow both depend on your hydration status

**8) Timing Rules**

* Morning: 20–30 oz with minerals
* Pre-workout: 12–20 oz in the 60–90 minutes before
* During training: sip, 6–12 oz every 15–20 minutes if sweaty
* Post-workout: 12–20 oz with minerals
* Evening: sip, don’t chug, to protect sleep

# Red Flags And Fixes

**Dehydration signs**  
Dry mouth, dark urine, headaches, low pump, brain fog, elevated resting heart rate.  
Fix: front-load water + minerals, steady sips, not last-minute chugs.

**Overdoing it**  
Crystal-clear urine all day, frequent nighttime trips, muscle weakness.  
Fix: add electrolytes, salt your meals, drink to plan not panic.

# Simple Daily Blueprint

* 20–30 oz on waking with minerals
* 32 oz during work or training
* 20–30 oz with lunch
* 12–20 oz post-workout
* Evening sips only

**Food boosters**  
Water-rich foods help too: cucumbers, oranges, melons, grapes, soups.

**Safety note**  
If you have kidney, heart, or electrolyte issues, talk to your clinician first.

# Tiny Tracker You Can Screenshot

* Waking 20–30 oz
* Pre-workout 12–20 oz
* During workout sips
* Post-workout 12–20 oz
* Lunch 20–30 oz
* Evening sips

*Hydration Game unlocks your next level as a man. Show up fueled and that's how u stay stay sharp.*",1,1759544375.0,GettingBiggerHQ,0,1.0,False

*Crackle…*

***POP!***

Si struggled to maintain her balance as she materialized. The change in air pressure wrecked her sinuses. She’d specifically requested not to be sent to a rainy day.

“Oh fae,” she swore, stumbling over to a fire hydrant and leaning on it for balance. Her stomach threatened to remind her of lunch.

She tugged her wristlet free of the leather jacket sleeve and activated the hologram display. No signal.

*Can’t trust cheap wizards,* she thought, pinching the bridge of her nose.

“Hey, Clippy,” she said. The hologram shifted into a paperclip with lovely almond-shaped eyes.

“Good day, Si!” it said in a sweet and husky voice.

“Fuckin’ discount scrying didn’t foresee that I’m already in this timeline.” The short haired bluenette turned around to lean-sit on the fire hydrant. ""TimeJump protection spells kicked in and now I'm not sure when I am.""

“My apologies! I’ll leave a two-star review on Yelp-powered-by-YahooTube.”

“Can you get me directions to Dee’s place?” Her girlfriend was always happy to see her stop in when she was in the area.

“Of course.” Clippy vanished and streamed data to Si’s contact lenses. She saw an arrow appear at the top of her vision and a blue line guided her down the sidewalk and around a corner. Ten minutes later she was on Dee's street and turned off the contacts’ Heads-Up-Display, recognizing the apartment building. Same facade, fewer holographic displays. Gentrification had to be coming soon.

The front door opened with a quick tug of the handle and shove of the shoulder. No need to ring a buzzer and wait when maintenance never did its job. Elevator out-of-order; she had to climb six flights, nausea worsening with each step.

She slammed her fist three times against Dee’s door. It opened and Si was surprised that Dee was still a brunette.

“Uh, can I help you?” Dee asked, her eyebrows knit together.

“Yo, Dee” Si said, stepping past Dee. “Sorry about the water, I’ll mop it up in a minute. Got any Imodium? I was shunted from the TimeJump and feel like I'm gonna vomit."" She kicked off her wet sneakers inside and continued into the main room. ""Couldn't conjure any Tums on the way here, either.""

""You were... what?""

Si was midway through peeling off her soaked jeans as she looked around the apartment, stopping when she took in the decor. A floral-pattern couch? Static wall photos? Minifridge?

Looking at Dee again, and seeing her natural brown eyes and long hair pulled back in a sloppy bun, Si ran some numbers through her head as best she could while the other woman looked very shocked and flustered at Si's current position.

""You... work at the cafe, right?"" Si asked.

Dee shook her head. ""I, uh, work at Costco?""

""Oh, *fae*!"" Dee yanked her pants up and hurried to the door. ""I'm so sorry! I got confused and-"" she slammed her foot into the corner of the wall. Another expletive was forming on her lips as she hunched forward from the pain, banging her head on the same wall.

Dee chuckled before reaching out and grabbing Si's arm, stopping her from toppling.

""Woah there, are you drunk or something?""

""No, I- uh, yes! Yes I'm drunk and I'm sorry, I mixed you up with someone else."" Her stomach lurched again as she stood up with Dee's help. She tried to excuse herself but bile rose, and she rushed to the bathroom.

\---

Thirty minutes later, Si lay on the scratchy floral sofa with an ice pack and hot tea.

""So, how do you know me?"" Dee asked, perched on the edge of the coffee table.

""Can't say. What year is it?""

""Twenty-Twenty-Five. I've read enough scifi to know that's a time-traveler question.""

""Not confirming nor denying.""

Dee puffed her cheeks, eyes narrowing. She reached for Si's wristlet, but the bluenette pulled it away.

""No touchy. No looky, either.""

""Fine, I'll just wait until you're asleep.""

""I'm not gonna fall asleep. I'm gonna wait for this headache to go away then leave.""

""You will. I put Benedryl in your tea.""

*Fae, I should have seen that coming.* ""But... that's..."" Si tried to find the words.

Dee shrugged. ""An uninvited intruder barges in, starts undressing, gets sick, and ruins my bathroom? Legally, I could do worse than give you sinus medicine.""

Si closed her eyes. ""I forgot how much of a bitch you were."" She yawned and felt Dee tug at the wristlet.

My kitten is a little more than a month old, weighs 1.3 lbs, I dont know anything about cat breeds or if that even matters right now. I was obviously very scared for her and took her to the vet. I paid about 200 dollars for some dewormer and a flea topical, as well as the exam fee, Im not sure if that's a good price or not but also not the point of my post. The vet's advice was to make sure she eats and drinks and she'll be perfectly fine, outside of extenuating circumstances, like a disease the mom passed on or something. Anyway I get home, and she has drank a few times, but isnt touching her food. I'm giving her wet kitten food. Also im a bit worried the vet may have missed something, I was feeling her ribcage and it feels like 1 side is missing a rib, and when I scratch around that area she gets mad and bites me. To the vet's credit she is marginally more energetic and is walking around a bit again, but for the rest of the time I've had her she's been a super energetic kitten, so this is still not normal behavior.

To put it concisely, I'm wondering if I should be concerned about this potential missing rib the vet missed when I took her earlier today, or if she was missing a rib it would have been super obvious to them and I'm just overthinking everything. Thanks in advance.",1,1759544226.0,AskVet,1,1.0,False

I can’t clean my room. I can’t maintain basic hygiene. I can’t keep any kind of routine. My eating is trash - some fruits and vegetables, decent dinners, but mostly sugar and caffeine. I down at least 6 coffees a day plus energy drinks just to function.

I smoke weed heavily and can’t stop. I have credit card debt. I’m working a warehouse job I hate - hour-plus commute each way, minimum wage, lifting boxes that destroy my back. No car, no post-secondary education.

I used to have energy. I used to cycle - even rode my fixed gear solo from Toronto to Montreal. I haven’t touched my bike since. The toll smoking has taken makes everything harder. I feel like a fraud for even thinking about going back.

I’ve been trying to build an AgTech business. I have skills (self-taught in development, design, electronics, woodworking, hydroponics, and mushroom cultivation). But I can’t focus. I can’t execute. I just smoke and feel guilty.

I went downhill in my last year of high school when my mental health got worse. COVID isolation made it worse. Now I’m just… stuck.

I feel so isolated and delusional. I’m drowning. Suicidal thoughts are daily. I have little hope and I don’t see a future for myself anymore.

I also have anxiety. Im 28 now, and as I’ve gotten older, my fainting triggers have become very specific, and the symptoms have worsened. My triggers are all medical related; doctors offices, hospitals, seeing or smelling blood, conversations about blood or injuries, and surgery. I tore my ACL at work on September 10th. While at a doctors appointment today, we were discussing the location and type of incisions I’d have following the surgery. Once my doctor mentioned the incision, I felt my face become hot and I knew I was going to pass out. I was able to lay down, and fainted while I was laying there. When I woke up, I was confused and didn’t know where I was for a few seconds. I didn’t recognize my doctor. Then, I started vomiting on myself and the room. There was nothing in my stomach, so it was just coffee and water. The embarrassment set in after I finished puking. I realized on my drive home that I bit the front of my tongue when I fainted, which has never happened before. I don’t know how I’m going to get through this surgery. I don’t know how to help myself. I feel like I’ve tried so many things and no matter what I do, I always end up passing out, throwing up, and causing a scene during medical appointments. It’s so embarrassing and I hate every second of it. I’m losing sleep every night because I lie awake in bed thinking about surgery, imaging how it’ll go, if I’ll faint, if I’ll throw up, etc. I just want this to be over. I’m scared that there is more wrong with me than I’m aware of, but my anxiety and history of fainting when around medical settings is keeping me from doing anything about it.

Like I said I tried over-the-counter sleeping pills. I’m really sensitive to medication, so I cut the pills into quarters. One night I tried half instead. That night, I fell asleep but woke up an hour later, wide awake, and couldn’t fall back asleep until 5/6 am. The next night I tried a quarter again, and it did absolutely nothing. This was only my third night in a row taking them, and it already felt like I’d built up resistance. And with the links to dementia risks, I don’t want to take them regularly. So I stopped.


I think part of what’s messing me up is being unemployed right now. When I was first let go, I still had a lot on my plate—doctor’s appointments, applications, to-do lists that I finally had time to get through. Having all those tasks gave me structure and a sense of purpose, and my sleep schedule was a lot more stable.

Now most of those things are done. I DO have things left that are things I’d enjoy doing—personal projects, hobbies—which you’d think is good, but since they’re not urgent, but I don’t feel the same drive to get them done.

On top of that, I’ve dealt with depression for a big portion of my life. Years ago, I went through extreme suicidal depression, and I’ve never felt the same since. When I finally got a stable full-time job and built financial security—emergency savings, retirement contributions—that really improved my mental health.

But now, I feel myself sliding back again.

So Alongside working on my sleep, I want to start adding things back into my days that give me a sense of purpose:

	1.	Start going to the gym. I’d love to get into strength training, but I’ve never done it before and don’t want to injure myself. Ideally I’d have a personal trainer, but that’s expensive, so for now I’ll focus on cardio and machines. At the very least I want to get my heart rate up and stop being sedentary. Exercise is supposed to help mental health, so I think it could make a difference.

	2.	Work on my photos. I’ve got a backlog of images from trips I’ve taken that I want to go through, edit, and maybe finally share. I’ve been meaning to do this for a long time, but when I was working full-time, I didn’t have the energy.

	3.	Get back into language learning.

These are all things I genuinely want to do, and I think diving into them would help give me structure and a sense of purpose again and help with sleep!!

So…  yeah. any helpful tips for fixing my sleep schedule would be great. I’ve already tried staying up all night multiple times in the last week and half ALONE, and it’s never worked. If the best option really is to just force it with sleeping pills for a few days, I’ll give that another shot.

I may continue to post here to keep myself accountable too.  ",1,1759543277.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

i’ve had to start whitening my teeth, to undo all of the staining that my excessive vaping, coffee and energy drink habit has caused. 

side note, i’ve recently managed to kick my nicotine habit (yahoo!!). i realised it wasn’t necessarily a nicotine addiction, but a things-in-my-mouth addiction. an oral fixation, a way of stimming for me. 

thing is, teeth whitening strips are kinda annoying to use. i’ve been using them at night before bed. they get gunky and nasty halfway through because of all the saliva mixing. 

i had a brain wave today though! for the Power Hour where my vyvanse takes charge in the mornings, i tend to get pretty intense cotton mouth.

no saliva = perfect teeth whitening strip adherence. the hour of wear also goes by faster, since i’ll be locked in on uni work. such a win!

I'm looking for help with this problem. I've done what troubleshooting I can on my own, but I'm stumped. I know the Deck is capable of downloading game files from my Steam account on my desktop PC over the same network. I also know Steam on two separate PCs can download game files from one another, making it a better option for installing games if your internet connection is slow.

The issue I'm having is with Baldur's Gate 3. I have it installed on my computer. I *had* installed on my Deck until a new update required a massive download that would take over a day to download. I've been downloading games onto an external drive via my laptop during trips to a coffee place that has insanely fast wifi because my connection at home sucks hard. BG3 on my computer is up to date. I figured I'd just uninstall it completely from the Deck and then use my home network to download the game from my computer. (Wife's computer can't run BG3 and she wants to play it on my Deck.)

However, when I start the download, it inevitably stops downloading from my PC. Wife just recently downloaded a game she got (that I already owned and installed) via Steam's file transfer, making it quicker than downloading normally. So I know that function works.

I've tried using my phone as a hotspot and connecting both computer and Deck to the signal, same result. I went into the Deck's settings, turned on Developer Mode to make a change I saw somewhere else, still no luck. I've gone into desktop mode and tried downloading through the Steam application there, same result. I've tried downloading a different game I have installed on my computer, same thing, if it even tries to download from my computer.

My Deck is up to date on Software updates. I changed out the internal hard drive a long time ago. I had some issues installing the OS, but otherwise it works fine. I don't have enough space on that drive for BG3, so I'm installing it on an SD card (I know it has enough space).

I'm at a loss. I don't have an SD card slot on my computer or I'd try copying to that. I don't have a big enough flash drive for BG3. My computer won't show my dedicated Steam Deck external hard drive when I plug it in. If I could just connect my Deck to my computer for the transfer I would, but I know that doesn't work. I would greatly appreciate any advice anyone might have.

Hi! Im lvl 100, just finished my first Detective League. (Did all the 7 weeks). I started playing around 9 weeks ago so the majority of my June experience has been around my club. 

Learned a lot, got to meet nice wonderful teammates. We all speak the same foreign language, so i guess we bonded faster. So a little background story: my club always goes for the Sherlock, they play low points initially for the first weeks and then when they find themselves in a ""HARD"" week, the take a break and come back with all the 6 week. (We won it). To ensure that win, we played really restricted the first weeks. I couldn't even do DN cases for the side games/ quest, like the FF or Clock (Dont really remember the name). At first i was like "" I want to get all the decorations, im new, etc etc.) But i understood it was for the greater good of the club so I stayed in the lower points area. 

Later in the club a lot of stuff happend: In the CM, even though I was new, i had to make 6 clues sectors with 15 cost badges (not everyone served coffes), and yeah i got my diamonds terminated hahah, but then there were the ""old teammates"" who were always busy to do the sectors so because they did good on the competitions they had a skip on not doing it (not even helping with time button) . Finally the sherlock week, the ""old teammates) saved their resources (even the green bushes) and ask us to buy diamond coffee for blue points instead of cutting down some 50 gold bushes that they desperately demanded us to send for this specific week i we ever needed them. 

In the end even though we won Sherlock 2 teammates left before the prize was given. And two more are waiting to leave. I tried telling the ""old teammates"" why everyone was so dissatisfied but the vice leader response was ""you are leaving, why you care), so the conversation endeed there.


With all that story, I want to know, are all clubs like that? Are Sherlock clubs like that? Do i have to be careful now that im searching for a new club of leaders that take advantage of new teammates for the Sherlock? Help. Cause after all we won the sherlock, but i feel like the atmosphere is so tense and unjust... should i make a club myself, with the teammates that left? BUT I want to get all the decorations/ competitions. (I really like this game, with all that was happening/ fighting, i still ended as i high score in my club in the Sherlock week with no diamonds) I DONT KNOW what to do.

I'm a 32F and until about five months ago, my periods were regular — consistent timing, flow, and symptoms. But things have changed recently, and I'm hoping someone here might have experienced something similar.

For the past five months, I’ve been getting spotting a couple of days before my actual period starts. Then I get my regular period (with usual flow and cramps), and things seem normal. But about halfway through my cycle, I get spotting again — usually light, sometimes with mild cramps. After that second spotting, I get a regular period again, just like before.

This has been happening consistently every month for the past five months.

Around the time this started, two things changed:

1. I started drinking coffee regularly (which was new for me but I have stopped drinking it since last one month)
2. I did a short stint of light weightlifting (about 4lbs in each hand), but I stopped that after the first time because I worried it might have caused an issue.

My diet hasn't changed significantly, my weight has been stable, and I haven’t been under unusual stress. I'm not on birth control or any medication.

I’d love to hear from anyone who's been through something similar. Unfortunately, I can't afford to see a gynecologist right now, so I'm trying to gather as much information and insight as I can.

Thanks so much in advance for any help or advice.",1,1759542577.0,menstruation,0,1.0,False

1nxhdt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1nxhdt2/mf_tbi/,[MF] T.B.I,"Beneath cold, uncaring white lights, two men sat together. One wore a blood-splattered lab coat; the other, a black jumpsuit and a shot-ridden armor vest. Despite their still-beating hearts, they were both nothing more than dead men. Beyond them, dozens of boots trampled a war-torn laboratory, dirtying its pristine white floors with bloody and muddy footprints.

“Will it…work?” asked the man in black, numbed.

“I... don’t know. I hope it does...” the man in white answered. His hands trembled with the strange needle-like device in them. “Or all of this... would’ve been for nothing.” His eyes wandered forward, past the man in black, into his own mind.

For a moment, there was quiet ─silence.

The quiet hum of lab equipment, refrigerators, fans and centrifuges was gone, replaced by the steady whir of the mechanical needler in his hands. The smell of disinfectant and stale coffee was gone too, replaced by iron, smoke and dust.

Eight minutes late to work, today of all days.

  
Distant gunshots brought him back, and he quickly set to finish his patchwork surgery. His patient, the man in black, sat still, unflinching ─even as small wiring had being introduced onto his flesh, his bones, and all throughout his mind.

On the right side of his head, a small slit shone like chrome, while cold veins of metal descended from it and reached his right hand. He raised it slightly and turned it to see it better.

From his head, down to his shoulder, and then from the underside of his arm all the way to his thumb, index and middle finger ran a river of crimson fuel, given no time to heal nor scar.

“I pray this works,” the man in white said “I’ve never used a live subject before.” He lied, adding the finishing touch. “Ready?”

“Ready.”

The man in black grunted as he struggled to stand.

“Feel anything yet?”

“I…I see a…small red…reticle?”

“Good, good…it’s on then. Now, what else do you see?”

“I…some…numbers?”

""…numbers?”

“Yes, just some…numb─”



 “*My name*”, a voice rang like a gunshot from behind him.

The man in black turned his head to face his impromptu surgeon.

“Whose name?”

“Name? What name?” he answered, confused.

""You just said─”

“*MY NAME*”, a shout pierced his mind with searing white-hot pain.

The man in black screamed in agony, holding his head with both hands and falling to his knees. His vision corrupted and distorted.

The corruption spread instantly, completely obscuring his sight with dark crimson vertical lines that seemed to fall from an invisible, impossibly high ceiling and imprison him. He found himself caged once more, behind unbreakable digital bars.

Only those small numbers on the edge of his vision remained, in an endless dark hallway of red lines. Yet they never sat still. They changed.

  
*They shifted*

*Squirmed*

*Restless*

*And disturbed*

*Thoughts blurred*

*Erased and replaced*

*A one for a zero*

*A zero for a one*

*A number for a letter*

*A letter for a name*

*A name for a scream*

  
In a mere microsecond, his sight returned. Now and then, the crimson reticle glitched slightly. The small red circle, with a miniscule red dot within, appeared to blink.

“Wha…what was…that?” The man in black struggled to stand yet again, shaken to his core.

“There might be…minor issues that needed some ironing out, but we don’t have the luxury of time right now. We must move.” The man in white answered, helping him to his feet.

“The…numbers are gone?”

“What?”

“They aren’t there…just some…letters.”

“Again, probably some glitch, we hadn’t tested it on a live subject yet. Let’s go.”



As the man in black finally stood steadily, the ground shook and loud bang erupted from the opposite end of the hallway. Their hastily barricaded door was blasted open, sending debris and shrapnel everywhere.

The once crystal-clear windows of the adjacent labs and offices turned into a heartless blizzard of shattered glass, masking the entrance of a dozen armed men storming the room.

Like a beautiful, carefully practiced dance, they entered ─weapons ready and aimed.

  
Shielding his face with his arms, the man in white was blind to the danger before him, powerless.

Cold, focused eyes, hidden beneath shatter-proof goggles, aligned both the rear and the front sights of a rifle. A trained index finger firmly squeezed the trigger. Its dark metal, worn out by extensive use, was pushed back, and the gun roared to life.

Trained muscles and dark cloth met recoil; bullets met air.

  
For the man in black, the world froze as he raised his right arm and the muzzle flash left the gun’s barrel.

Thin silver strings slowly appeared in the air between him and the firing squad. They grew upwards from behind them, like vines growing upside-down, and curved slightly in the air, suspended. Like yarn on water.

They slowly approached his outstretched hand, like calm, curious snakes, slithering about in absolute silence, returning home.

*They wrapped themselves on him*

*On his index, middle and thumb*

*Reaching deep into the rivers of chrome*

*Like needles touching bone*

*Boring deep into his core*

  
The dot within the reticle stopped glitching, and as a whole it blinked ─a digital eye staring directly into the dead man’s mind.

“*My name*…” again the voice shot out from beyond the veil of his mind, “***pull*** … *and hear my name.*”

The silver strings turned bright red and they too froze in time. For his hand, their relaxed waviness felt wrong ─horribly, disgustedly and painfully wrong─ so he firmly yanked them back.

  
The world unfroze. A rifle roared and the floating strings turned into the straighten lines ─tearing away from behind the firing squad’s heads.

*They broke into brutal, primal screams*

*Synapses fired, overloaded, and burned neurons in a blink*

*Veins and arteries burst and ruptured, flooding them from within*

*Organs churned and filled with blood*

*Nerves bloated, charred and turned to dust*

*Amidst the carnage, a grim scene of decimation's gust*

  
The man in white stumbled backwards and fell to his knees, grazed by a machine gun burst to his left side, and witnessed the horrors unleashed.

The screams bounced and echoed throughout the laboratory until they faded and dissolved into nothingness.

The man in black stood there, motionless, his hand clenched in a white-knuckled fist free from the strings.

""Wh…what the *fuck* was that?"" He asked, gasping for breath.

""You...I...,"" the wounded man stammered, staring at the twitching corpses of the firing squad.

Vital fuel gushed and poured from all their orifices. From their eyes, filling their goggles; from their mouths, overflowing their balaclavas; and from their ears, escaping from under the sides of their dark helmets.

“Let’s get out of here, now…” the wounded man ordered, taking a second to watch the slow spread of his own fuel across his once-white lab coat “…there will be more of them.”

The man in black lent him his left shoulder and helped him along the hallway. Step by step, they walked through the war-torn facility.

Shattered glass, debris, bullet-ridden equipment and papers littered every room they passed through, as well as the occasional lab coat wearing corpse of the facility’s workers.

  
Soon they came to an emergency stairway, its entrance marked by rotating emergency lights that painted the doorway a somber amber color. Taking a deep breath, the man in black pushed the door opened with his right hand ─and his world disappeared and turned pitch black.

*He no longer felt the weight of the wounded man on his shoulder.*

*He no longer felt the numbness of his right arm*

*The sweat dripping from his face*

*The fear in his heart*

*In fact*

*He felt nothing at all*

*He tried to raise his hands and look at them, but they weren’t there.*

*He tried to look down to see himself, but he wasn’t there.*

*He tried to scream, but he had nothing to do so.*

*He tried to breath, but he had nothing to do so.*

*He tried to leave, but  there was nowhere to go*

*He tried to live, but it wasn’t his choice anymore.*

*He was and wasn’t.*

*Neither alive nor dead.*

*He was now but a witness.*

*A passenger.*

  
The thin crimson lines rained down again, surrounding him, imprisoning him, caging him once more.

From amidst the endless storm, the red reticle glitched into existence and the small dot in its center shifted downwards ─like a pupil, it stared at the man.

“*My name…*” a digital lightning flashed beneath the reticle, followed by a whisper “*…do you…know…my name…?*”

 “Wh…what? Who…are you?”

The reticle glitched and shifted violently, its image distorted and the rain became a brutal blizzard.

“*MY…NAME…SAY…MY…NAME.*” A deafening, digitalized thunder roared, unleashing untold pain onto the trapped man.

His scream broke through his unseen gag and shot-out across the crimson darkness like a meteor, cleaving a path across the blizzard. The raging storm halted almost immediately, its ferocity dissipated into an eerie, unnatural stillness, leaving only the echo of his cry reverberating through the empty, blood-red void.

“*THAT IS…MY…NAME*”, the numbers and letters at the edge of the trapped man’s vision shifted again and grew more and more, until the very image corrupted and displayed ‘*4-TR0-PH05*’.",1,1759542262.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1nxhd59,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1nxhd59/my_girlfriend_says_she_doesnt_love_me_as_much/,"My girlfriend says she doesn’t love me as much anymore. No reason, but feels “empty”.  “How to proceed/process?","TLDR: So I just had a revelation. My (35M) girlfriend (28F) of 6 months says she feels “empty” and doesn’t love me as much anymore. Our chat is down there. How can I proceed and process this?  

It’s a partially long distance relationship. We hadn’t met for 5 weeks. She had expressed frustration with this. This was the longest stretch away because I was sick, normally it’s 50% long distance and 3 weeks was the longest separation. I don’t think this is necessarily the reason, but it may or may not have contributed. 

So when we met today, she was generally a little less touchy-feely than normal (but not awfully different) but I also didn’t press for more touchy-feely, because I thought she was tired. I picked her up after work. She had slept particularly late last night. So I thought she is just tired. We had a nice time, we had coffee chatted, laughed, ate dinner. The usual. I thought we meet tomorrow again and get back to our usual rhythm. 

She said that some things between us feel diminished, specifically “our love”. After I said not for me, she said then “for her”. But she couldn’t explain how or why. She feels empty and also she’s sorry, mostly for herself.

I was shocked, because this felt so sudden. Just days before, everything seemed fine. She appeared very excited I was coming back. “I’m expecting you…” I asked a few questions (see chat below) but there appeared to be no reason. 

My question is: is this a usual occurrence where a partner suddenly feels “empty” and says their love isn’t as strong anymore? Was this about the relationship, or more about their own internal state? I have had heartbreak but this kind is new. How did you process this?

I don’t want to pressure her or beg, but I’m also very upset about the (almost certain) possibility of losing her. Right now I’m trying to show care and give space, but inside I feel as anyone would.

Any other advice on how to handle this, or how to respond to her reasonably would be welcome. 

Thank you all!.

I smoke weed heavily and absolutely cannot for the life of me seem to stop. I have a lot of credit card debt and not a lot of opportunity it seems. 

I've been trying to build an Agritech business and I’m a 21-year-old with Bipolar and it's probably going to kill me. I can't keep anything going, including cleaning and taking care of my room, routine and health like oral hygiene and poor day-to-day habits. Poor food mixed with fruits and vegetables and decent dinners I tend to eat meh. A lot of sugar and caffeine from coffee. 

I used to cycle a lot which gave me energy before I started smoking, and I highly recommend exercise. I even decided to take my fixed/single speed solo from Toronto to Montreal but I haven’t ridden my bike since and it's nowhere near as easy. I feel like a fraud for coming back to the hobby plus the toll smoking has had. 

Currently, I have little hope in life and hope not to fail my family, but I just don't see a future for myself anymore. I’ve even had thoughts of throwing it away in ways that would make a lot of money but would otherwise lead me down a worse path, and at times, it's tempting. 

My only option is to return to my part-time warehouse job over an hour-long bus ride away for minimum wage. It destroys my back with lifting boxes and I hate every second of it, sometimes lifting up to 8 skids worth of boxes alone. I seriously hate my life and everything I've come to. I don't own a car, no post, secondary etc. 

I went downhill in my last year of high school when my mental health got worse and after COVID, when I was isolated but heavily connected through social media. But yeah, I have some self-taught skills in development, design, product development, game design in Unity/Unreal (although basic), tons of woodshop stuff and carpentry, and physical mediums like painting, pastels, charcoal, and pencil. I've always been interested in tinkering, building robotics and stuff, cracking games, software and all that shit. I've explored hydroponics, mushroom growing, microgreens and eventually my AgTech product to aid in grow automation for growers. 

I just feel so isolated and delusional and I can't help but feel as though I'm drowning. 

Suicidality is a daily and I feel as though the inevitable is bound to happen eventually and be what ends me. I dont even know how the next week is going to go, I don't know when or how I'm gonna be able to return to work. I'm broke and have nothing but remnants of my past around me.

I really wanted to post on here to get help from those who may have been through what I've gone through or can help scope out my situation a little bit better than I can.

How do you manage this? How do you survive bipolar disorder in your early 20s when everything is falling apart? Do I need to give up on the business and just focus on surviving? Do I need hospitalization? I don’t even know what help looks like anymore.

I really need to hear from people who’ve been here. What actually worked?",1,1759541913.0,BipolarReddit,1,0.67,False

1nxh7ju,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1nxh7ju/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate.

The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table.

1nxh70c,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1nxh70c/my_girlfriend_says_she_doesnt_love_me_as_much/,My girlfriend says she doesn’t love me as much anymore and feels “empty”.  How to proceed/process?,"TLDR: So I just had a revelation. My (35M) girlfriend (28F) of 6 months says she feels “empty” and doesn’t love me as much anymore. Our chat is down there. How can I proceed and process this?  

It’s a partially long distance relationship. We hadn’t met for 5 weeks. She had expressed frustration with this. This was the longest stretch away because I was sick, normally it’s 50% long distance and 3 weeks was the longest separation. I don’t think this is necessarily the reason, but it may or may not have contributed. 

So when we met today, she was generally a little less touchy-feely than normal (but not awfully different) but I also didn’t press for more touchy-feely, because I thought she was tired. I picked her up after work. She had slept particularly late last night. So I thought she is just tired. We had a nice time, we had coffee chatted, laughed, ate dinner. The usual. I thought we meet tomorrow again and get back to our usual rhythm. 

She said that some things between us feel diminished, specifically “our love”. After I said not for me, she said then “for her”. But she couldn’t explain how or why. She feels empty and also she’s sorry, mostly for herself.

I was shocked, because this felt so sudden. Just days before, everything seemed fine. She appeared very excited I was coming back. “I’m expecting you…” I asked a few questions (see chat below) but there appeared to be no reason. 

My question is: is this a normal occurrence where a partner suddenly feels “empty” and says their love isn’t as strong anymore? Was this about the relationship, or more about their own internal state? I have had heartbreak but this kind is new. How did you process this?

I don’t want to pressure her or beg, but I’m also very upset about the (almost certain) possibility of losing her. Right now I’m trying to show care and give space, but inside I feel as anyone would.

Any other advice on how to handle this, or how to respond to her reasonably would be welcome. 

Thank you all!.

Then, okay (22:26)

How (22:27)
Please tell me (22:27)

D:
I felt that some things between us have decreased very significantly (22:35)

Me:
That’s possible, but not from my side (22:37)
Are you implying that your feelings for me have changed? (22:37)

D:
That’s how I felt (22:37)

Me:
But you should know this. You do know, don’t you? (22:37)

D:
Know what (22:38)

Me:

This (22:38)
I love you the same as before
but you don’t, right? (22:39)

D:
> I felt that some things between us have decreased very significantly
That’s how I felt (22:40)

Me:
What exactly decreased? (22:40)

D:
Our love (22:41)

Me:
Not from my side. Did I seem like I loved you less? (22:41)

D:
If it’s as you say, maybe it’s only “for me” like this. I don’t know (22:42)

Me:
I understand (22:42)
This is a hard question to answer: (22:42)
But what changed? (22:43)

D:
Not because something changed (22:43)

Me:
And when did you realize? When you saw me again? Why? (22:43) 

Me:
Answering these questions may be impossible, but you understand that I had to ask (22:44)

D:
There doesn’t need to be an event (22:44)
There’s no reason (22:44)

Me:
Yes, that’s true (22:44)
But I had to ask (22:45)

D:
I don’t know what will happen (22:51)
My mind and soul feel completely empty (22:51)
I feel empty inside again. (22:52)

Me:
I understand (22:52)
Thank you for telling me honestly (22:53)

D:
I’m sorry (23:02)
Mostly for myself (23:03)
Good night (23:04)

Me:
Don’t worry (23:05)
Good night (23:05)

P.S. I know some may come out and say she is cheeting and moved on, and I want to say, thank you, I find it unlikely, she would straight break up before doing that.

I weighed around 255 in July a few months ago 
I cut out all soda and sugary drinks and only drink water and black coffee and the occasional zero sugar energy drink at work 

I’m trying to cut more weight and started working out 5 days a week at work in the gym we have 

I really only eat 1-2 times a day. I mostly do intermittent fasting where I’ll have just water for a 16 hour window and give myself an 8 hour window to eat 

I eat around 1,500-2,000 calories a day and according to my Apple watch if it’s accurate I burn 1200-1350 calories a day at work between moving around/walking at work and lifting 

Do I really need to hit my protein goals everyday of 170-200g

Even If I’m lifting 5 days a week am I gonna lose that muscle if I’m not hitting those numbers?

I’ve never really worked out and started 4 weeks ago I’ve already seen some progress in My arms and a little in my chest

My family and I are relocating from South NJ to Fort Lauderdale in the next couple of months. My new job will be near E Broward St/Las Olas, and since we have a 1-year-old and dog, I’m trying to balance work convenience with a family-friendly environment.

We will be renting for the first few years - Apartment up to 5k for 2 br.

Here’s what matters most to us:

* Close to restaurants, coffee shops, and everyday amenities (ideally within walking distance so we’re not always relying on a car).
* Easy beach access - it doesn’t have to be “step outside and you’re on the sand,” but I’d love it if going to the beach could feel casual and not like a big planned trip.
* Clean, safe area with low crime rates.
* Family-friendly vibe since we’ll be spending a lot of time outside with our baby.

We’re coming from a quieter suburban area, so I know I may not get *everything* on my list, but being able to walk to restaurants and not worry too much about safety are big priorities for us.

If anyone has insight into specific neighborhoods or streets east of Federal that would make sense for a young family (but still close to Las Olas), I’d love to hear your recommendations.  
Also Considering looking into Plantation Areas, never been there though

Thanks so much in advance - moving with a baby is already a little overwhelming, so your advice would mean a lot!",0,1759541522.0,fortlauderdale,9,0.38,False

I'll update the table with any changes, uploads, and BetSam's picks before fight time.

The lock pending fighters will not be ""Locks"" if BetSam picks against them. Also, I'll be adding a risk warning for wmma fights and debuting fighter locks since these are usually the ones that miss. The wins/losses will still count towards the overall ""Locks"" pick rate. 

This past month has been crazy busy but I'm still feeling all the love and support from the mma betting community. 

I want to thank everyone for the donations you send on coffee and cashapp, and a special shout out to Adrian Perez. Brother you go crazy with the donos and they are very much appreciated. I started this as just something I did for myself back when I was betting more on MMA. Never did I imagine I'd even make $1 for posting this so big thanks again to all of you 💯 

And that's it.. Good luck with your picks and bets, stay safe and enjoy the fights!

A Handmaid wouldn't get far.

It's those other escapes.

The ones you can open in
yourself given a cutting edge.

Or a twisted sheet
and a chandelier.

I try not to think about
those escapes.

It's harder on ceremony days,

but thinking can hurt
your chances.

My name is Offred.

I had another name,
but it's forbidden now.

So many things are
forbidden now.

You can sit.

No, ma'am.

only not a very smart one.

for you this morning?

leaving your friend
outside waiting.

I want to tell her that Ofglen

is not my friend.

That I've exchanged barely
50 words with her

in the two months
since I got here.

I kind of want to tell her
that I sincerely believe

that Ofglen is
a pious little shit

with a broomstick up her ass.

Under His eye.

Sorry.

He's the Commander's driver.

Lives over the garage.

Low status. Hasn't even
been issued a woman.

Going shopping?

No, Nick, I'm gonna knock back

a few at the Oyster House Bar.

You wanna come along?
Yes.

If you're going to All Flesh,

you should avoid the chicken.

I read they've got
crazy levels of dioxin.

I'm going to Loaves and Fishes.

Oh, then you should
definitely avoid the tuna.

Mercury?

No, I just don't like
tuna very much.

Maybe he watches me.

Maybe he's an Eye.

Yes.

Very well, thank you.

in the Blue Hills.

Oh, yeah.

We should go.

Hey.

Did you see?
They have oranges.

Praised be.

The fighting in Florida
must be going well.

Your Mistress likes oranges.

Make sure
she knows you got them.

Don't let a Martha take
the credit.

I don't... I don't have
a token for oranges.

Tell them you're
Commander Waterford's.

He's really high up.

His name's in the news.

I didn't read it.
I promise...

We should get some oranges
before they're all out.

Praised be His bounty.

Take some.

I don't need oranges.

I need to scream.

I need to grab
the nearest machine gun.

the river?

That would be nice.

a doctor,

a gay man.

with chemicals and radiation

and poison!

So, God whipped up
a special plague.

The plague of infertility.

Welcome!

Find a seat, please.

As birthrates fell,
they made things worse.

Birth control pills,

morning-after pills,
murdering babies.

Just so they could have
their orgies, their Tinder.

No, thanks.

that paper tonight.

Oh.

Yeah.

For or against?

Moira, come swimming.

- Come on.

Mmm. All right. I'll be right there.
I'll be right there.

What'd she say?

She just said,
""Let's go to church.""

Oh, did she?

What's her name?

You don't know her name, do you?

Moira! Come on!
Write your paper!

There's a seat here.

Right there.

They were dirty women.

They were sluts.

But you

are special girls.

Fertility is a gift
directly from God.

you girls will serve the Leaders

of the Faithful
and their barren wives.

You will bear children for them.

Oh!

So privileged!

left out the part

about inheriting the Earth.

Fuck!

Where do your hands belong?

Girls.

Mmm.

I know this must
feel very strange.

But ""ordinary"" is just
what you're used to.

This may not seem ordinary
to you right now,

but after a time, it will.

This will become ordinary.

I tried to run...

but she's...

gonna end and then

we'll find her.

of the dyke purges.

She was reclassified as
an Unwoman

sent to The Colonies.

I can't...

Moira, what'd they do to her?

""If my right eye offends thee,
pluck it out.""

We're breeding stock.
You don't need eyes for that.

Moira isn't up there.

And that gives me hope.

It may be false hope,
but, hey, it's something.

Should we take the long way?

I can't.

I have to get ready
for the Ceremony.

Praised be.

We'll go straight home, then.

May God bless your endeavor

and bring forth His miracle.

Praised be.

A bath is required
before the Ceremony.

I am to make myself clean.

Washed and brushed
like a prize pig.

She comes to me
so clearly in the bath.

When do I come to her?

Does she remember me?

Please, God.

Let her remember me.

I want to know what I did

to deserve this.

The boys just kept
coming down into the basement.

For hours, it felt like.

I don't know, two,

maybe three at a time.

I knew most of them.

From school.

I just couldn't
believe they were doing it,

that it was actually happening.

But it did happen.

Didn't it?

Yeah.

And who led them on?

Whose fault was it?

I don't know.

Whose fault was it, girls?

Her fault! Her fault!
Her fault! Her fault!

Her fault! Her fault!
Her fault! Her fault!

Her fault!
Her fault!

Her fault! Her fault!

Go on, do it.

And why did God

allow such a terrible thing
to happen?

Teach her a lesson!
Teach her a lesson!

Teach her a lesson!
Teach her a lesson!

Teach her a lesson!
Teach her a lesson!

Those eggs you got
today were nice and fresh.

I wish they'd hurry up.

Some of us got
things to do, you know?

Hurry up and wait.

Late again, as usual.

What is it about men?

The knock is prescribed

'cause tonight
this room is her domain.

Come in.

It's a little thing,
but, in this house,

little things mean everything.

Good evening.

Dear.

Now, let's get started.

Excuse me.

""And when Rachel saw that
she bare Jacob no children,

""Rachel envied her sister,
and said unto Jacob,

""Give me children or else I die.

""And she said, 'Behold my maid,

""'...and she shall bear

""'that I may also have
children by her.'""

""And she gave him Bilhah,
their Handmaid, to wife,

""and Jacob went unto her.""

Get out.

Are you deaf?

The...

The... The chances are...
Are better if I...

If I lay on my back afterwards.

Just get out.

The moon's the same.

That's something.

They haven't changed that.

I'll think about the moon.

I can feel the Commander's
come running out of me.

I can smell it.

Have you heard about anyone?

I saw Gabby a few months ago.

She had a miscarriage.

That sucks.

Have you heard from Moira?

No.

Not since the Red Center.

Me neither.

Oh, she's dead.

Janine?

Quiet!

Janine?
Who's dead?

Moira.

Yeah.

Yeah, she tried to run away.

They caught her, and they
sent her to The Colonies.

So, she's dead.

She's dead by now.

To your places.

Quick, quick.

Kneel.

Well.

Good morning, girls.

Good morning, Aunt Lydia.

I am sure we are all aware
of the unfortunate

circumstances that bring
us together

on this beautiful morning,
when I am certain

we would all rather
be doing something else.

But duty is a hard taskmistress,

and it is in the name of duty

that we are here today.

This man

has been convicted of rape.

As you know, the penalty
for rape is death.

This disgusting creature
has given us no choice.

Am I correct, girls?

Yes, Aunt Lydia.

Offred.

But that is not the worst of it.

Now, you know that I do
my very best to protect you.

The world can be quite

an ugly place.

But we cannot wish
that ugliness away.

We cannot hide
from that ugliness.

This man raped a Handmaid.

She was pregnant.

And the baby died.

Quiet, please.

Now, girls, up.

Wings.

You may come forward
and form a circle.

You all know the rules
for a particicution.

When I blow the whistle,

what you do is up to you.

Until I blow it again.

Offred, are you all right?

Have a nice day.

Hey.

Sorry.
Fucking Uber.

Hey, it's okay.

You put our name in?

Uh, yeah, be about 20 minutes.

What?

We'll freeze our nuts off.
You want to go somewhere else?

Hi. What's wrong?

Sorry, I'm just... I'm trying
to get a hold of Luke.

He’s staying over in Essex
and there's, like,

shitty cell phone
reception there.

Oh, okay.

Um,

so, I think I'm pregnant.

What?

Oh, my God, are you...
Holy shit, come here!

Oh, my God!

What?

Don't worry.

Don't worry. Getting
pregnant is the hard part,

that's what they're saying.

And you did it.

That's not all they're saying,
though, you know?

I know five women at work
who've had miscarriages.

Some of them were
pretty far along.

Yeah, well, that's not
going to happen to you.

You know Linda from Marketing?
Uh-huh, yeah.

She actually carried
to term but her son

only lived a few days.

That's not gonna happen.

But you don't know
that, Moira, okay?

You don't know that.

It could happen.
Okay, all right, um...

If it does... Yeah?

You've got a good man.

And you've got me.

No matter what happens,
I'll be right here.

You and me, just like always.

I am so sorry about your friend.

Moira?

You knew her
from the Red Center?

And before.

Was there ever a ""before""?

This used to be
an ice cream place.

They had the most
amazing salted caramel.

It was better than sex.

Like, good sex.

I always thought you were
such a true believer.

So were you.

So frickin' pious.

They do that really well.

Make us distrust each other.

Eyes.

Come on.
Just keep walking.

How old is your daughter?

Eight.

She'd be eight.

My wife and I had a son.

Oliver.

He's almost five.

They had Canadian passports.

I didn't. I got caught
at the airport.

We tried to cross in Maine.

With my husband.

Then we split up.

They shot him.

They weren't going to let
any of us get away.

Not if you had a red tag.

This is your stop.

As they used to say.

It was nice to finally meet you.

You too.

There's an Eye in your house.

Be careful.

Blessed be the fruit.

Gentlemen?

Please, let's
continue in my office.

No rest for the weary.

We'll join you for dinner.

Go back to your room.

Someone is watching.

Here, someone
is always watching.

Nothing can change.

It all has to look the same.

Because I intend
to survive for her.

Her name is Hannah.

My husband was Luke.

My name is June.

I can actually look down and see my left kneecap where my right knee is still hidden by an overhang of fat.

Stage 2, very heavy thighs and overhang area above knees.  2 months ago I severely cut back dairy, gluten and sugar, increased my walking, 2 miles in the morning and again in afternoon, and started doing sit-stand squats and a couple leg machines at the gym, only set them to 20 pounds as that's all the strength I can do.  I try not to sit too long and have my fitbit to vibrate if I don't move at least 250 steps per hour. I also lay on the floor a couple times a day, usually after walking, and put my legs up on the wall, for about 30 minutes.

The last 2 months I've also increased my water intake, as well as using fresh ginger and tumeric in cooking, and I don't know if its a factor but I ordered mushroom coffee from ryze and add a spoonful to my morning coffee.

I've struggled with weight my whole life and know it's not possible to target fat loss in any one area, so I'm really hoping my left thigh is losing lipedemia inflammation. 

Thoughts on this, or your own experiences?  Tia.

Half the time Target, Walmart, or literally the brand's own site has a better deal.

Or maybe it’s the “free” delivery… yup nope not it. Coffee tables nowadays cost $60+ for delivery.

• IQ Requirements? None (but enthusiasm for niche knowledge and/or random facts is a plus)

My buddy (34m) and I are looking for up to 3 friendly, easygoing, and sociable people to join our trivia group. We’re not super competitive, mostly just want to hang out, drink beer, and enjoy some good pub food, but actually enjoying trivia is definitely a plus. 

About me: 29, work in tech, he/him. Into TTRPG‘s, travelling with my Fiancé, beer, coffee, hiking, Factorio, King Gizz, and weightlifting. 

You are: Somewhere in your mid-twenties to late thirties, based near Midtown (or willing to make the trip), open to meeting up in person beforehand, and down to commit one Tuesday night a month to the cause. 

Sound good? Please fill out this Google form (https://forms.gle/bZGo4vpoV5SojFjC7) and I’ll be in touch over Discord!

I was a fresh-faced junior dev, maybe three months into my first real coding job. I was buzzing with that classic newbie energy, eager to prove I wasn't a total fraud. My task was simple: clean up some old, unused tables from a development database. Easy, right? Famous last words.

I had two terminal windows open side-by-side: one connected to the safe, cozy development server, and the other… well, the other was connected to the live, breathing, money-making production server. I meticulously typed out my `DROP TABLE` commands, feeling like a real hacker from a 90s movie. In a moment of absolute brain-failure, I clicked on the wrong window, took a confident sip of my lukewarm coffee, and hit Enter with the force of a thousand suns.

For a solid 10 seconds, nothing happened. Then, the alerts started. My phone buzzed. Slack channels exploded with a level of panic I'd only ever seen in disaster movies. The website was down. The app was throwing errors. My heart didn't just sink; it plummeted into a dark abyss. I stared at the screen, the blinking cursor mocking me, as a cold sweat washed over me. I had done it. I had deleted the entire customer database.

I did the longest, most shameful walk of my life over to my senior dev's desk. I couldn't even form words, I just pointed at my screen. He looked, his eyes went wide for a second, and then he just sighed and said, 'Okay. Don't touch anything. Step away from the keyboard.' He spent the next hour restoring from a backup, and to his eternal credit, he was incredibly calm about it. He later told me everyone does something like this once. It’s a rite of passage.

It's been years, and I'm a senior dev myself now, but I still get a jolt of anxiety whenever I have to touch a production database. So, Reddit, what's the biggest 'oops' moment you've ever had at work that felt like a career-ending catastrophe at the time?",1,1759540572.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

The challenge is not that the present is hard to find, but that our minds are so often elsewhere. The secret, then, lies in learning to anchor your attention in the here and now, and this is a practice built on a few profound yet simple principles.



First, you must make peace with the reality of \*now\*. Often, we resist the present because it feels uncomfortable, mundane, or not as we would wish it to be. We mentally argue with it, wishing it were different. This resistance is the very source of our discontent. The first step toward presence is to consciously release this struggle. Accept this moment, exactly as it is, without demanding that it be more exciting, more peaceful, or different in any way. This acceptance is not passive resignation; it is a powerful act of saying ""yes"" to reality, which then frees your energy to engage with life fully, rather than fighting against it.



Next, you must learn to engage your senses. Your mind can dwell in the past or future, but your body is always right here. It is your most reliable anchor to the present. Pause for a moment and truly listen. Notice the layers of sound, from the most obvious to the most subtle. Feel the weight of your body in your chair, the texture of your clothing, the temperature of the room. Simply look at an object nearby and observe its color, shape, and shadow without labeling or judging it. This sensory immersion pulls you out of the abstract world of thought and into the tangible, vibrant reality of the immediate experience. The world comes alive when you meet it through your senses.



Finally, understand that presence is a quality you bring to your actions, not a state you achieve only in silence. The secret is to pour your entire being into whatever you are doing. When you drink your morning coffee, just drink the coffee. Smell the aroma, feel the warmth of the cup, taste the rich flavor. When you walk, feel the rhythm of your steps and the solid earth beneath your feet. When you converse with someone, offer them the priceless gift of your full attention. By bringing a singular focus to ordinary tasks, you transform them into acts of mindfulness, and your entire life becomes a meditation.



Living in the present moment is the art of showing up for your own life. It is in the ""now"" that you find peace, because the past and future have no power here. It is in the ""now"" that you discover joy, not as a fleeting emotion chased in the future, but as a quiet background contentment that arises when you are fully engaged. It is in the ""now"" that you access your true strength and creativity, for they are never found in yesterday's regrets or tomorrow's anxieties.



The secret is not a secret at all. It is a choice, made again and again, to return. To come home to your breath, to your senses, to this very moment. Do not strive for a perfect state of perpetual mindfulness. Instead, gently and compassionately, call yourself back from the wanderings of your mind. Each time you do, you are not just noticing the present moment; you are truly living it. And in that simple, profound act, you discover the deepest peace and the most vibrant life imaginable.",1,1759540539.0,mypersonaldevelopment,0,1.0,False

My husband was giving me coffee out of a frother that was full of a gross substance I’ve never seen? He has been screaming at me since.,"I don’t know if she was overthinking the situation. For about a week now, I’ve been feeling extremely ill. I do have an autoimmune disease so I chalked it up to that. 

We went out to eat for a family member’s birthday. With the autoimmune medication, the first couple of weeks it was tough but the side effects went away. Either way, I had a pretty clean meal. My stomach was hurting by Monday — said maybe it’s the medication or just some food poisoning. 

This all felt weird. Nothing like a food poisoning. Knocked me out of work. Struggled to move too much. 

Yesterday, I felt a LITTLE bit better. So while trying to eat something light, meal prep crossed my mind. I started that but noticed the kitchen was not clean so I was just wiping the counters off. Since being on my meds, my cleanliness OCD has gone wild. My husband is one of those people that really will not do something that could affect me to cut corners. 
I always just tell myself that it’s my OCD and this is just a really annoying trait. 

Well, when I felt like making coffee I find that the frother was full of this weird substance - then brown dots. It was nauseating. Still somewhat weirded out by what the hell that even was at — saying it was likely rotten milk or mold due to not washing properly and he goes into full anger mode. Starts shouting and that’s when it just pissed me off. There is no way a 35 year old could just let this thing get moldy and make me my coffee EVERY MORNING I’m sick?! He argued that it was cleaned. He spent all night arguing. 

Today, I got worse — started puking out of the nose (had no idea that was really possible). He then insisted to take me to a doctor but of course he did it by yelling at me after 2 hours of sleep. I just wanted this to go away, maybe get meds so the telehealth was the quickest way. The provider seemed concerned and told me to go to the ER - without him saying it was worrisome and not convincing that this wasn’t intentional. 

He is a cop. With a temper. We’ve been having marriage problems because of it — in counseling (just started) but now I am feeling uneasy. I’m far from a saint but this has all been very strange. I can’t really fathom someone his age would be *that* gross but now I don’t even feel safe enough to get a cup of water. Am I just being paranoid? ",327,1759540536.0,TwoHotTakes,115,0.96,False

She quickly worked out that I was uncomfortable by Justin’s presence in her life by their coffee meets, and her late night visits to his flat after his latest break-up.

1nxgow0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/1nxgow0/end_of_the_road/,End of the road.,"Been meaning to post this up for a few days now, but my head's been so mashed by this mouthwash binge I've kind of been in a haze for days, no small part of it simply passed out.

As one guy suggested I make a habit of, on a post of mine from years ago, I'll start this off with a tl;dr and get straight to the point: the long struggle is finally over and I lost. I'm being evicted, going into homelessness again, and I will have to give up Jonesy. This is not going to be a happy post.

I had a good week a couple of weeks ago. I was starting to get more job rejections instead of just total silence, and while I obviously would have preferred job offers instead, that at least showed more of my applications were actually getting through to people after I had ChatGPT rejig my resume. That made me feel a little more optimistic about the endless job applications I was firing off. 

And it looked like it finally paid off when I had a phone interview, my first interview since February. It went well; had some nice banter with the interviewer and was only weak on a couple of questions. Evidently I was a strong enough candidate, though, as the interviewer cheerily confirmed I'd passed and was through to the next round. I tried not to get ahead of myself but I felt *elated*. This could finally be it, the turning point. I was going to get this job and the sinking ship of my life was going to be righted.

I was in good spirits and decided a mouthwash celebration wasn't entirely out of order. I thought I'd earned it.

A few days later I came home from a booze run to find something unexpected and most certainly unwelcome: it was my landlord's business card wedged into the door with ""CALL ME!"" written on it. Oh shit. *This is not good*. 

I had recently lulled myself into a wee bit of a false sense of security, about being evicted, when I considered the unit next door and how it was vacant for around 9 months. The landlord had someone come in and do a fixer-upper, and I saw plenty of people come to view the property for months before someone finally moved in - and I strongly suspect the new tenants are personal friends of the landlord and paying mates rates because he couldn't find anyone to pay his asking price. 

Surely, I reckoned, the landlord would rather let my rent arrears slide than repeat the same thing he did with next door and lose revenue for months. After all, he doesn't know I don't have any money and for all he knew the next month I could finally pay all my arrears. That must have seemed a more financially sound option than kicking me out, paying someone to come in and do up the place, then sitting on a vacant, non-rent-paying, property for however many more months. Hell, the unit next door is bigger and better than mine; if he couldn't shift it for months he'd have more problems with my unit.


I didn't call him. It was early evening on a Friday night. He probably popped by mine on the way home from work (he runs a realty company, he's not a mom and pop landlord) and was enjoying his weekend. I'd call him...*later*. Besides, I wasn't drunk enough yet for an anxiety-inducing phone call. What could I tell him anyway, ""err, sorry about the late rents. I'm working on it. Been out of work for months. When can I get it all to you? Err, I can't say hehe. Been unsuccessful in finding work so I can't exactly give you an approximate date. Just please continue to standby""? 

If he was the jovial, mom and pop type, landlord there might have been a chance in hell I could have swayed him to give me more time. But he rents out multiple properties (CAG called him a slum lord) and more pressingly, we've never really liked each other. My old landlord, while we weren't exactly *friends*, was much more agreeable; he'd offer to drive me to the store and back for a cashier's check if I didn't have it to hand by the time he came to collect rent. If he came to visit the property for whatever reason he'd usually stop by for a pleasant chit chat with CAG and I. 

This guy, we've only had one pleasant chat - after he took over and introduced himself. After that it was usually just insincere smiles and waves (and low-key side-eye) when he came by. Things came to a head in 2022 when there was a water leak in the yard and he came by to investigate it. He thought the leak was coming from inside my unit and tried to walk past me, as we were talking on my porch, into my apartment. I was drunk and moody after my speculative cancer diagnosis that day and almost clotheslined him as he tried to get by. I don't recall the exact particulars, but I think I said some pretty stern words to him, like ""fuck off"" or I called him a ""parasite"".

Since then it's always been awkward and sometimes a little tense. He's moaned about the stuff stored around the side of the house, and in January he came by to bitch about late rent. I mean, I can understand the rent issue in principle; a landlord might need it paid on time to balance his books but as I said, he's not a mom and pop type landlord but rents out multiple properties. He's not exactly hurting for money. I've always been of the feeling that as long as he gets his rent before the month is out, who cares? Given his complaining about late rent earlier this year, though, the fact that I've rarely paid anywhere near the 1st also was certainly not going to endear me to him.

That weekend, I still didn't call him. I was of the persuasion he didn't work on weekends unless it was like a property emergency, and ""one more drink to feel calm and cool enough to talk to him and tell him I can't pay rent"" turned into just passing out in bed until sunset or early morning. He had my number and email; if it was that urgent he could always contact *me*.

Monday I got the bad news. I followed up with the company I had the telephone interview with. They had appended their confirmation I was through to the next round with the disclaimer if I didn't hear back from them in three working days to chase them up. As the days came and went I became a little worried because if I was that good with the telephone interviewer they would have contacted me in a day or two, right? But I consoled myself with the idea it was just HR paper-shuffling and they must have been taking their time sorting through dozens or hundreds of applications. 

I was sure I was still a safe candidate and they'd contact me in due time for that follow up interview so I let the three days elapse not overly concerned. When I emailed them in the morning they responded a few hours later with the dreaded ""we are sorry to inform you this position has been filled with another candidate..."" Gutted. I was absolutely gutted. He said I was through to the next round and I didn't even get that in-person interview. Not only did my first kind of any progress in months get shutdown almost immediately, I was right back to square one with the dread and anxiety over the job/housing situation, especially with the landlord leaving his card. 9 steps forward, 12 steps back. 

I figured ""why the fuck not?"" and turned the mouthwash celebration into a mouthwash pity party.

Tuesday was the day the axe blow fell. I was lying in bed with Jonesy, in a blue mouthwash haze, just on the verge of consciousness, when I heard a loud knock at the door. I thought here it is, the landlord's come to get my accounting of things. It took me a minute to struggle out of bed and I shuffled into the living room to see a piece of paper shoved through the crack of the door. With a sigh I opened the door to retrieve the piece of paper without damaging it, and talk to my landlord. There was no one out there on the porch. He just knocked, shoved the paper through the door, and left apparently. 

*Notice of intention to terminate lease agreement*, the paper is headed. This is it. I already knew what this heralded from the header alone, but my heart sinks as I read through the text: *pay the overdue rent or I'm going to court to get you evicted*. I just go numb. How else can I feel? This is the fate I've been dreading for months and now Damocles' sword had fallen.


I Google search and ask ChatGPT but, as expected, the answer is simple: there's nothing I can do. I might be able to stall for a few days but in the eyes of the law it's coming down to ""put up or shut up (and get out)"". Even if I were able to sell every fungible thing left in the apartment, and there's really nothing, I'd still be short of the 2-odd grand I owe.

The house takes on a depressing ""last days of Rome"" vibe. There was nothing to do but drink and wait until the curtain fell. I go the store every few days for another bottle of blue. Distantly, I wondered if the staff knew I was just straight up drinking this shit. In the past, when I had food stamps or more money, I would at least buy other stuff to disguise my reason for being there. Now, I was just heading straight to the dental hygiene section and running my bottle(s) through self-checkout. I wasn't exactly discreet. 

My heart breaks every time I interact with Jonesy. For months I felt guilty over him, having to neglect him when he wanted to play, in order to fire off yet more applications. ""I know you don't understand,"" I would say to him as he stood up to paw at my arm while I was sat at the computer, ""but I'm doing this for us."" *But what if we fail and you threw away all this time you could have spent with him?* I have to give him up now, we'll be parting ways. That's the grim truth of it. This is the end of us, him and I. 

A month or two ago I got a little sad, thinking about outliving Jonesy and how I would handle his passing. Now I was faced with the certainty I wouldn't be around to comfort him in his final days. I'd often thought, over the years, how nice it would have been if Brownie, my old dog who CAG lost, had been here with us; to see her playing with Jonesy. She was a boisterous, energetic, dog, and he's such a cheeky little chappy. They would have made a good couple of friends. Now I'm going to lose him as I lost her.

I reconnected with GG (remember her?), I was wasted and saw her active in contacts. I was so despondent I just wanted to talk to *someone* I'd had an emotional connection with, for comfort. I was distantly aware of how obviously drunk I sounded as I made several nonsense remarks, in my rambling, and avoided some cutting accusations she threw my way; ""so-and-so was right about you and I shouldn't have defended you."" Right about what lol? I don't care about boondocks drama and what someone I barely know thinks of me. There were rumors her and so-and-so were involved with drugs and GG probably just made all that shit up as bait or some meth-induced delusion. As the conversation carried on two things percolated up to my mouthwash-soaked brain: 

1) She had previously offered me a spare room at her place Jonesy and I could stay in, when I told her I was homelessness again in 2022. I had dismissed the idea back then for a few reasons: it was in the middle of nowhere, just up the road from the homeless veterans camp where I met CAG. The nearest shop was like a 3 hour walk away, one way, and there wasn't exactly much around where I could work and get back on my feet. I'd just be twiddling my thumbs in the middle of the Arizona desert. There was no public transport out there as well. [It was one of those places the road goes right on into the horizon and you absolutely need a vehicle to get around](https://imgur.com/a/7Ak13AL). I also wouldn't be able to drink as there would be no way for me to realistically acquire and sneak booze into the house and she'd made noises about negative encounters with alcoholics before. There was also the fact that, given the nature of our relationship, there would be some romantic entanglement. My stay would be entirely dependent on keeping in her (romantic) good graces. If we had a falling out or spat she could just kick me right out, and I be stranded in the desert with no way back to civilization. 

2) As we talked then, I was struck by how cold, callous, moody, and arrogant she was, and wondered why I ever liked her in the first place. (The answer being I didn't initially see that side of her until she'd turned on me for whatever reason). At least when she made the offer before, she had me under the impression she had feelings for me and we were a 'thing'. This time the mask was off and I knew how she could play games and be emotionally cruel and manipulative. I suspected she would be worse in person, especially since I wouldn't be able to escape her. In some ways her personality traits put me in mind of a less insane and highly intelligent CAG. Plus, I knew she was a randy old thing and would definitely try hitting me up, if only for the lack of talent out there. I don't feel the same way about her. I'm not into casual sex or laying with women I don't have feelings for and I'm not in a relationship with. If I moved out there I'd essentially be a live-in sex slave, trapped in the middle of nowhere, entirely dependent on her. That might sound great to some men, but that's horror to me.

When she asked ""how is Jonesy?"" I choked. For a microsecond I considered telling her about our situation. But I thought of the above and decided against it. Staying with her simply isn't an option for the reasons I listed. Besides, she could already have put someone else up in the room or wouldn't offer to take me in anyway. I decided to keep my dignity and say nothing. We'll probably never talk again anyway, so no point in admitting I'd soon be a homeless alcoholic loser.



I reached out to CAG for a possible Hail Mary. Her wage could more than cover the arrears. I'd kept a line open to her for the last few months, to sound her out in case of a possible return. I'd low-key been hoping she'd come back, *sober*, and we could return to our prior living arrangement, stopping this ticking clock of doom I'm now facing. If she became drunk and insane again I'd hopefully have a job by then so I could just say ""bye bye."" 

Since leaving here she had spent most of her time in Florida, the promised land. When we first reconnected it was nothing but drunk complaints from her. She offered no explanation for why she took off like that, in January. No apology. I wasn't bothered about it because I was used to it. That's the way she's always been; we always have to ignore her chaotic departures and the messes she left in her wake. 

She said she wasn't happy there, that the VA had 'failed' her somehow, despite her repeated bold statements of healthcare there being better than here, which was the ostensible reason she had specifically gone to Florida. She had also managed to find a charity that would put her into housing, but she bemoaned she didn't like it and the charity was taking too long to get her hooked up. 

I could only roll my eyes at the VA 'failing' her; I knew it was always a bullshit justification to keep bouncing back to Florida, but the housing situation made me chuckle - she'd been flying all over the country since 2020 chasing 'free' housing, and now that she'd finally acquired her holy grail she sniffed at it and wanted to leave the state instead. That was so typical of her 'just one thing' mentality, where she claims one thing - housing, healthcare, Florida, whatever - would complete her life, and she suffers without it, but as soon she attains it, or comes close to, she self-sabotages or discards said thing to repeat the victim cycle.


We had a fairly good rapport in August. She had gone to one of the Virginias to live with her dad - the source of many of her mental problems allegedly - and surprisingly managed to stay sober, when I thought her and her father were more likely to strangle each other, given the way she's always demonized him. We talked fairly frequently and while the discourse was rather pedestrian, it was inoffensive. She just whined about her dad's girlfriend and I had to bite my tongue and stifle a laugh as she obliviously ascribed traits to the woman CAG possesses herself. 

Late September, though, she ended up leaving, despite her parents both imploring her to stay. She went right back to Florida, apparently having learned nothing from her last experience there, and then New Jersey. It didn't take too long for her to relapse, which I suppose is the reason she wanted to leave the stability of her father's home. I knew right away she was back on the sauce when she'd call and be all giggly and say strange things like she'd always wanted us to work and it was only her putting the effort in, or talking about our past sex life, or how she'd always secretly hated my cooking (despite never complaining about it and often going back for seconds and leftovers). 

When I told her of the eviction notice she was initially indifferent, like ""man, that sucks, sorry. Is there anything you can do? Anyway, let's move on to some magical thinking topic."" Then she became faintly mocking, giggling in a sing-song voice *you're gett-ing evic-ted*. Then she started making noises about coming back here to pay the arrears, but first I *must* talk to a judge and indirectly threaten to get the place condemned. But she wouldn't give any solid pledge about her return, just ""I'll be back on the 1st to save you and Jonesy and our dwelling."" My asshole got a little twitchy when I suggested she could just wire me the money and I could pay then, and she could come back whenever she wanted to, but she kept dodging talk of a solid game plan, insisting I go speak to a judge first, implying she wouldn't do anything otherwise. I had a low-key feeling they were empty promises to make her feel good about herself; in June she made a similar offer to come back and take care of the finances but rescinded that offer in under an hour in order to drunkenly abuse me.

Then she took a dive into her classic CA rage mode. I had missed a couple of her calls due to being passed out on the mouthwash, but I sent her a text asking what was up in-between. When she called again she was seething, asking why we hadn't spoken for 24 hours. I told her I texted her before that and she could have responded. I was taken aback by how unreasonably furious she was over a couple of missed calls. She accused me of being on hard drugs because I missed her calls and I couldn't remember things she said (the talk to the judge stuff I shot down). I asked her if she wanted to discuss, in concrete terms, her return here and getting the arrears paid, or if she just wanted to be angry-drunk with me on the phone. 

That set her off, and she started saying shit like I was an asshole, she'd come back to get Jonesy but wouldn't pay, and I could 'enjoy' being homeless; or that she'd take me to court for all the stuff here she was going to lose. The red mist had descended and there'd be no getting through to her, so I just hung up and texted her we'd talk when she wasn't so angry. She kept blowing up my phone with angry texts, saying the same shit; ""you took my home from me!"" ""All the stuff I've lost over the years because of you, I should take you to court!"" ""You're evil!""

A couple of days later I straight-up asked if she was going to help or not, like she said she would, and she turned it into an argument about my unwillingness to see a judge for a payment plan - you literally cannot see a judge for a chit-chat on the side or before a court summons is issued and I had told her as such before - and it became clear that she was in the typical delusional stage of her drunk cycle. She was dangling help to me, to paint herself as the heroine in a story, and I was too mean and boorish to deserve it - because I pointed out her strategy simply wasn't legally possible - therefore she could pat herself on the back for her 'good deed' and gloat at me getting my just desserts. The call devolved into her just continuously insulting me before she hung up.

So that ploy failed. She's not coming back, she's not going to help Jonesy and I. She's too drunk right now and lost in delusion on planet CAG. (She even arrogantly boasted, out of nowhere, she was a ""hard act to follow"" since some of her exes were single). In about a week or so she'll have burned through the funds necessary to pay the arrears, anyway, and by the middle of the month she'll be completely broke. It's possible that *next* month she could be sober and actually be serious about coming back, but there's absolutely no guarantee of that and obviously it will be too late by then. More likely she simply never cared to help and her promises of salvation were always hollow. The narcissist's way of ""doing you a favor"". She wanted to craft a narrative where she's the noble heroine offering to save Jonesy and I, but I spitefully spurned her help so me losing the house is just 'karma'.

So much for CAG. 



I don't know what to do about practical planning. I'm too numb, drunk, and paralyzed with despair. It's like being in a nightmare and I can't breathe.  


I should be looking up shelters to take Jonesy to, but I can't face it. It's too painful. Would that I had a friend who could shelter him for (hopefully) a few months, but I don't. I'll have to hope I can find a no-kill shelter that will take him, but I'm trying not to think about how long he'd be trapped there. He absolutely hates strangers so the whole thing is going to be a terrifying and stressful affair for him. Well, for the both of us. Our last moments together on that dreaded day are going to be confusing and sad. He'll wonder why I am abruptly 'mean' to him when I pick him up and struggle to shove him into the pet carrier, which he hasn't used for years and hated; why we're going on a roaring car ride and, eventually, why I'm leaving him with a bunch of scary strangers and he never sees me again.

I should be planning logistics, like what I'm going to pack in my backpack to roam the streets, but it feels like such a monumental task I don't know where to begin. I was 'lucky', in my prior homelessness; the first time I became homeless I only had a backpack and two roll-on luggage that I'd just brought with me from England, but I had a friend who was willing to store the latter, so I could just rove with a backpack that doubled as a pillow. I also went into homelessness with a job so I could afford booze, cigs, new clothes, and other stuff. After that I bounced from homeless veterans camp to homeless veterans camp, and I could store such baggage, know it was safe, and had ready access to it for things like seasonal clothing. 

I can't roam the streets here with so much baggage. It just isn't practical. Never mind the everyday hassle of lugging around two roll-ons, you are all but screaming you're homeless, and the world has become considerably harsher for homeless people since I was last on the streets. So many more places I've seen with ""no backpacks"" signs or ""toilets not for public use."" I don't even want to think about the implications of the Ending Homelessness Act and potential interactions with the cops, *especially* if they catch me drunk.




Here, I have *so much* stuff acquired over the years and 99% of it is just getting binned. Clothes, books, collectibles, kitchen stuff, plants. Evidence of the life we'd built up together. I ruefully looked at my shirt rack the other day, thinking I'll only be able to take like 3 or 4; a collection built up over the years going right in the trash. I don't know if I'd call myself a super materialistic person, but it feels a damn shame for all this treasured, sentimental, stuff to just go right on to the trash heap.

The nights are getting colder and winter will be here soon. I'm already wearing a hoody/light jacket when I go out for a smoke at night. In 2018 night time temps here were colder than in Alaska. I lived in a busted out 1950's trailer, at my second homeless veterans camp, and had to sleep fully-clothed - like wearing a jacket, beanie, and socks - inside a sleeping bag, under like 3 duvets just to keep warm. The only thing I have now is a winter jacket but it's so big and puffy it's going to take up *so* much room in my backpack - and it's one of those extra-large military style rucksacks - space that could be occupied by more clothing. 

I don't know how I'm going to carry it all; homeless 'wisdom' is you should pack light but some stuff I simply can't leave behind like steel-toe boots for potential manual labor work, or smart shoes and office wear for interviews and more professional work. I'll also need a lot of weather-appropriate gear, like cold weather gear and hot weather clothing. Despite the fact temps are dropping at night, day time temps are still in the 90s and I'm very quickly going to get stinky and smelly roaming the streets in the day in anything more than tank tops and shorts. That leaves me carrying a lot of situation-specific clothing that's otherwise dead weight when not needed. If I had a mini storage locker I could store all that dead weight clothing there, but I'm not gonna be hitting the streets with a job this time so I can't even afford the $10-15 mini units.

I don't know what I'm going to do about the busted out bedroom window. I don't care about doing it for the landlord's sake, but I think under Arizona law that *could* be classed as criminal property damage. I could have a warrant out while I'm roaming the streets and not know it. Talk to a cop one time, they run my name, and it's off to jail for like a year. I'm not a lawyer, and I can't make heads or tails of whether the law reads the damage in itself constitutes the criminal element, or there needs to be a proven element of malice e.g. in retaliation for being evicted. Maybe someone with some legal knowledge could help me with clarification on that? It's ironic that CAG was the one who insanely did it, but because I'm the one left here and it's my name on the lease, I'm the one left holding the bag. One more turd in this shit pile.

I'm also low-key worried about a large hole in the wall, where a boiler used to be. The previous tenant pulled it out but never bothered filling the hole after. When this landlord took over he had an inspector come by to take photographs of faults in the unit. CAG and I specifically directed him to the hole and told him it was there when we moved in. It wouldn't put it past the landlord to conveniently 'forget' that, given he added a spurious ""daily late rent"" fee to his note, even though the lease I signed had no late rent fee - and he's never charged me one for the all the times I was late on rent.

From time to time over the year I've often thought about this disaster coming to pass and wondered how I would make it in daily life on the streets again. For example I've wondered where I could reliably use a bathroom; where could I sleep safely at night; where I could shower and clean my clothes; where I could simply chill in the day without getting moved along by the police. This might sound odd considering I've *been* homeless before. But like I said, I was lucky before. 

In my first stint of homelessness, in California, I had money. I could buy water and other drinks, use launderettes to clean my clothes or simply buy new ones. The small city I lived in had a relatively small homeless population, so I could sleep in a back alley undisturbed, and the duvet I stored there was safe from thieving hands when I left for the day. Just around the corner there was a Jack-In-The-Box open 24 hours, whose toilet I could use for the necessaries and the odd bird bath; I could waste a few hours in the morning charging my phone and having breakfast. Most of the staff knew me by sight and because I was buying coffee or food regularly, and not causing problems for anyone - aside from passing out drunk in the toilet a couple of times- I guess they knew I wasn't just some bum and left me alone. I could also frequent other diners and restaurants, buying meals (and booze) to pass the time. I had a workmate, who I eventually ended up living with, whose house I frequently visited for parties where I could use the shower.

In Arizona I only spent a few days sleeping rough, outside a major library where dozens of other homeless people slept on the sidewalk, before I went into my first homeless veterans camp. I had access to porta potties there, cooking facilities, fridge/freezers, bottled water was delivered daily from community well-wishers, there was an outdoor shower where you could get clean and wash your clothes too. Hell, we had so much plastic waste we would recycle it and buy tobacco and papers for all the residents; despite not having a job and no money in the 9 months I was there, I never went a day without a cigarette. The police and other, more deranged, homeless people didn't fuck with us so we were safe and you could just mess about on camp all day. 

The latter two homeless vet camps I stayed at were lacking in some of the facilities of the first one, but I at least had the bare minimum of safety, access to water and cooking facilities, toilets and showers. 

As I've considered these quandaries, all I can come up with is ""I don't know"" because I've never really had to deal with these homeless issues before. In California I originally slept off the beaten track in a park, but I was roused by the police after some do-gooder called it in, and I eventually found my alley. Can't do that here as the city has/had problems for years with homeless people infesting parks, so the cops are extra vigilant about stomping nuts there. On booze runs I've scanned the environment for potential sleeping areas but I haven't ranged very far, comparatively, and there's nowhere I've seen that's secluded enough to sleep safe from prying eyes. Wouldn't want to risk sleeping on a business property for fear of getting busted and copping a trespassing charge. Shelters are simply out of the question; never mind the breathalyzing, they have a notorious reputation among the homeless for things like assault, rape, theft, bed bugs etc. Plus you're never guaranteed a cot for the night.


I don't know where I can use the toilet after hours because AFAIK fast food places have switched to drive-thru only after a certain hour, perhaps simply to stop homeless people crashing out in their toilets at night. Obviously there's no more 24-hour grocery stores, and every gas station I've been to now appears to not allow the public to use their toilets. It might just have to come down to literally shitting in back alleys and hoping I don't get caught mid-asspiss flow.

Hygiene and clean clothes...I don't know. In California I sometimes used fast food bathrooms for bird baths, but from what I've seen and heard here, fast food places won't let you use the bathrooms unless you're buying something (they have those code-locked doors now) and staff come hollering at you after like a minute or two. Plus, there's the whole stigma about looking visibly homeless and the establishment not wanting ""those people"" hanging around.

I don't know how to strategize and make an action plan. I'm not going to hit the ground running. I'm going to hit the ground face-first and tumble end over end. This all so seems so enormous and dizzying and suffocating. The mouthwash-fried brain probably isn't helping. Neither is the crushing depression. I don't know how much time I have left, exactly. Best I can find from Google and ChatGPT is an estimated 10 days. I can't be sober for this nightmare and I just want to hang out with Jonesy in the remaining time we have left together. I'll act - maybe - when the court summons hits the mail. Every day I've been checking the mailbox with a knot in my stomach, dreading to pull out that court summons. In the mean time, that antiseptic blue helps to quiet the internal screaming and sterilize my brain.

Chairs all.

I work 4 days on and 2 days off so days off rotate back one day every week. 

I work from 12-8am with about a 45 minute to 1 hour commute. The longer commute being in the morning. 

I decided to try biphasic sleep basically splitting my sleep into 2 shifts. 

When I get home around 9am I take a shower and go right into bed. Black out curtains. Eye mask. Ear plugs. 

I find I’m usually asleep as per my Fitbit around 9:45am 

I set an alarm for 2:45pm 

I always get up (even if I don’t want to) take another quick shower just to help me wake up and grab a coffee and go outside for some sunlight.

I spend my entire day from around 3pm to 8:30pm with the family doing whatever. 

At around 8:30-9pm I’m back in bed take a 2 hour nap then head out to work.

1nxgizo,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseSharingStories/comments/1nxgizo/the_great_new_roommate_integration_and_the/,The Great New Roommate Integration (and the Dishwasher Truce),"I swear, for a minute there, I was convinced I was going to lose it over the dishwasher. Not the dirty dishes, mind you—those were a separate, daily battle—but the *clean* ones. Every morning, I’d wake up in our urban co-living apartment, grab my coffee, and inevitably find the sparkling, cycle-finished dishwasher untouched. My internal monologue was a lowkey scream, because who was leaving these perfectly clean dishes hostage?

Liam, our newest housemate, had moved in a month ago, bringing with him a contagious enthusiasm and, apparently, a blind spot for communal chores. Chloe, our resident social butterfly, was always out at some event, returning late and likely just grabbing whatever clean mug was on the drying rack without a second thought. Ben, our quiet, introverted tech wizard, would meticulously clean his own dishes, then retreat to his room, leaving the general chaos to ferment. I, your humble narrator, felt like the unofficial household manager, constantly nudging, constantly doing. Ngl, the silent resentment was building, and I was highkey ready to make a passive-aggressive Post-it note that simply read: ""Empty me. Please.""

The final straw came last Tuesday. I had an early work call, and I needed my favorite mug. The dishwasher was full, gleaming. The sink, however, was already accumulating Liam’s breakfast bowl and Chloe’s smoothie blender. I just stared at the clean dishwasher, then at the dirty sink, and a wave of pure, unadulterated frustration washed over me. I literally found myself sighing so dramatically, I think my cat, Mochi, looked at me with concern. This wasn't sustainable.

That evening, I decided to bypass the notes and actually talk. When everyone was finally home, I cornered them in the living room. ""Okay, so, lowkey, the dishwasher situation is kinda getting to me,"" I started, trying to keep my voice even. ""We've got a perfectly good, clean dishwasher that no one seems to want to empty, and then the sink just piles up."" Chloe immediately looked sheepish. ""Oh, my bad! I honestly just grab what I need and forget about the rest."" Liam, bless his oblivious heart, chimed in, ""Wait, we're supposed to empty it after it's done? I thought it was just a washing machine, not, like, storage."" Ben, surprisingly, spoke up. ""That's so valid, Sarah. I just didn't want to be the one to always do it, so I avoided it.""

We spent the next hour hashing it out. We realized we all had different assumptions. We decided on a simple, visible system: a small magnet that said ""Clean"" or ""Dirty"" on the dishwasher door. Whoever started a load would flip it to ""Dirty,"" and whoever emptied it would flip it to ""Clean."" Liam, surprisingly, volunteered to be the ""Dishwasher Monitor"" for the first week, setting a reminder on his phone. Chloe offered to make a communal grocery list for shared items like dish soap and paper towels. It felt good, for real, to just get it all out in the open.

The change wasn't instant, no cap. There were still a few times the magnet stayed on ""Clean"" a little too long. But now, instead of simmering resentment, we had a tangible system and, more importantly, open communication. The apartment felt lighter, the kitchen less like a minefield. We even had a spontaneous movie night that weekend, and Liam actually emptied the dishwasher before we started, completely unprompted. We were still figuring things out, but we were doing it together, and that felt pretty good. We love to see it.

Love is choosing each other when it’s not easy.When the days drag.When work wears you thin.When the words don’t come,and intimacy feels like a chore you don’t have energy for.

Why?Because of the fireworks in your laugh,the lightning in your eyes,the memories we haven’t made yet,the ones I can’t imagine making with anyone else.

It won’t always be this way.Our love can be thunder.It can quake mountains,it raised kids.Grown now.Good people.Our love did that.
But this chapter?It’s slow.Dormant.Smoldering coals on a cold October morning.

For now, it’s quiet.A whisper.A brush of your hand.
But that whisper?It holds the chorus of my favorite song.And that touch?It ignites the cold morning fireand warms the house that is my soul.

Hope you're all having a great week! I just finished a book that really got my heart racing, and I wanted to share some thoughts, especially for those of you who enjoy a good, pulse-pounding thriller. If you're anything like me, once you dive into a gripping story, you immediately start looking for more. That's why I often find myself searching for things like [Ben Coes Books In Order](https://pdfhive.com/ben-coes-books-in-order/)—because when you find an author or a genre you love, you just want to read *everything* that's out there!

Anyway, the book I want to chat about today is a recent read that falls squarely into the high-stakes, international spy thriller category. Without giving away any major plot points, it follows a seasoned operative who finds himself caught in a race against time. There's a looming global threat, a shadowy organization, and a deeply personal mission that adds a real emotional punch to all the action. Think complex conspiracies, nail-biting escapes, and a protagonist who has to make impossible choices. It’s the kind of story that keeps you guessing, right up until the very last page.

What I really enjoyed about this book was the relentless pace. From the moment you start, it's like you're strapped into a rollercoaster that just keeps climbing and diving. The author does a fantastic job of building suspense, sprinkling in clues without giving too much away. The main character, while incredibly skilled, also felt very human. He wasn't invincible, and you really felt the weight of his decisions and his struggles. The writing style was crisp and efficient, pulling me into the various locations – from bustling cityscapes to desolate hideouts – and making them feel incredibly vivid. I found myself thinking about the characters even when I wasn't reading, which is always a good sign for me!

On the flip side, if I had to pick something that didn't quite land perfectly, it might be that a couple of the supporting characters, while interesting, felt a little underdeveloped. I would have loved to see a bit more depth to their backstories or motivations. Also, as is often the case with thrillers, there were a few moments where the plot felt *just* a touch convenient to keep the story moving. But honestly, these are minor quibbles in an otherwise exhilarating read.

Would I recommend this book? Absolutely! If you're a fan of thrillers, spy fiction, or just enjoy a book that keeps you on the edge of your seat, you'll likely have a great time with this one. It's a fantastic choice for anyone looking for an escape into a world of intrigue and action.

Now, speaking of diving into books, I wanted to share some tips for anyone just starting their reading journey or looking to get back into it. Sometimes, getting into the habit can feel a bit daunting, but it doesn't have to be!

**A Simple Guide to Starting Your Reading Adventure:**

1.  **Find Your Niche:** Don't feel pressured to read what everyone else is reading. If thrillers sound exciting, start there! If fantasy worlds call to you, explore those. The goal is to find what *you* enjoy. Try looking up authors like Ben Coes if you like action, or explore popular fantasy series if that's more your speed.
2.  **Start Small:** You don't have to tackle a huge epic right away. Novellas (shorter novels) or even short story collections can be great entry points. They offer quick satisfaction and build your confidence.
3.  **It's Okay to Quit a Book:** This is a big one! If you're not enjoying a book after a few chapters, put it down. Life's too short to force yourself through something you're not connecting with. There are thousands of other books waiting for you.
4.  **Read for Joy, Not Duty:** Reading shouldn't feel like homework. It's an escape, a source of entertainment, and a way to learn new things. Approach it with curiosity and an open mind.

**Personal Tips for Building a Reading Habit:**

*   **Set Aside ""Reading Time"":** Even 15-20 minutes a day can make a huge difference. Before bed, during your commute, or with your morning coffee – find a consistent slot.
*   **Join a Community:** Talking about books makes reading more fun! Consider joining a local book club, or even a community here on Reddit dedicated to your favorite genres. Sharing your thoughts and getting recommendations is fantastic.
*   **Audiobooks Count!** If traditional reading isn't always possible, try audiobooks. They're perfect for chores, walks, or long drives, and they absolutely count as ""reading""!

**A Bit of Motivation:**

Don't get discouraged if you don't instantly become a voracious reader. It's a journey, and every page you turn is progress. The more you read, the easier it becomes to find books you love, and the more you'll open up new worlds and perspectives. Remember, the goal is to enjoy the experience and discover stories that resonate with you. If you're into the kind of thrilling adventures I've been talking about, you might find some excellent starting points by exploring resources like [Ben Coes Books In Order](https://pdfhive.com/ben-coes-books-in-order/) for authors who specialize in gripping narratives.

Warm, near hot at times, with a perfectly blue sky. The pets and wild animals enjoyed it just as much as I did. Peach and Cooper spent quite a lot of time outside with me watching the squirrels chase each other across the fence. A perfect day to finally be done with the husbands and able to move forward. I very much enjoyed writing today and it shows in how much I got done; I wrote 950 words for I'm Still Sisyphus. The chapter is nearly done. Two more days is what I'd anticipate it'll take before we are on to the sixth chapter, especially because tomorrow and the day after are supposed be just as wonderful and even warmer. Part of me wants to write more and I just might. We shall see.

Sadly, I do have some bad news as well. My dinner potatoes betrayed me. Twice I tried to make a baked potato and twice the damn things fucked me over by becoming as hard as rocks. I do know what caused it. I made a baked potato the exact same way from a potato from the exact some bag with no issues last week. How could they turn on me not once, but twice in a row? My ire could have boiled a kettle and eventually I had to give up and make myself scrambled eggs instead. Oh woe is me. I must give myself a sweet treat of some sort with my evening coffee to soothe this wound.

This is a text between my husband and another woman from a few years ago. We have talked about this multiple times and he swears nothing went on and that she is just overly friendly. As a woman, I read it as proof of an affair. I can not get past it and it keeps haunting me. I’m here to ask for help.

👨 “In case I don't see ya, have a great trip to Nashville. I know you'll knock everything out of the park as you always do. ❤️”

👩‍🦱 “Hey you! Was thinking about you earlier. I wish I could see you before I go- I'm leaving early Thurs am”

👨 “I may have to be in your area after lunch tomorrow but I'm assuming you're probably in meetings leading the next space mission to mars or something equivalent ;)”

👩‍🦱 “Haha!!! I wish! Depending on the time, I may be able to slip away”

👨 “Well I'm case you get free, l'm in that area from about 1pm until 3 or so and completely flexible”

👩‍🦱 ”Ok I'm gonna look at my calendar as soon as I get back to the office and see what I can move around. Would love to see you before I leave.”

I came here to ask the men, 30’s -50’s are these texts in some way innocent or am I right to feel there was more going on? Seems like there definitely was something leading up to this. For context, apparently she was only going out of town for the weekend. I can not fathom why it would be so important to simply catch up before a weekend trip. Also, he lied about plans on being on her side of town- he admitted that to me. Not only that, why does he speak to her like she hung the moon? What the hell is that?

I really don’t know how to move on from this and accept his explanation of “nothing happened, she is just overly friendly we reconnected and wanted to meet for coffee.” This seems way more urgent and warm than old friends 25 years after the fact wanting to catch up. I need clarity as I am trying to move past this and bury it. I am hoping the male perspective can help me so please be honest. Thank you.",1,1759539385.0,AskMenAdvice,45,0.57,False
1nxgfaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1nxgfaw/my_kidnapper_couldnt_feel_pain/,My Kidnapper Couldn’t Feel Pain,"I woke to a smell that shouldn’t have existed anywhere outside a morgue — bleach cut with rust and something sour-metallic like coins held in the mouth. My head throbbed; my eyes refused to open at first. The dark was so complete it felt like fabric pressed to my face. When I tried to move, pain shot through my shoulders and up my neck. My arms were suspended above me.

The bindings were layers of torn cloth cinched tight with plastic zip ties. My hands had gone cold and pale, fingers tingling, almost blue. Each time I tried to shift, a new line of pain flared — burning, stabbing, tearing — radiating out from my joints like cracking glass.

Somewhere, a sound began: a low humming, tuneless, at first far away, then circling me. My heart slammed against my ribs. I tasted bile in the back of my throat.
The humming stopped. Footsteps scraped concrete. A metallic click. A single fluorescent bulb stuttered to life above me, casting a greenish glare across cinder block walls.

The walls were wrapped floor to ceiling in butcher paper. Anatomical diagrams scrawled in black ink covered every surface — nervous systems, muscle groups, hospital pain scales with handwritten notations in the margins. Words like nociception, analgesia, stimulus written and underlined. In places the ink had bled, streaked downward like someone had pressed their face to it and wept.

“You’re awake,” a voice said.

They stepped into the light. At first they looked like a tired grad student: thin frame, pale skin, dark hair hanging in their eyes. But their arms told a different story — a network of pale scars crosshatched from wrist to elbow, stitched with surgical neatness. A missing fingertip sealed in shiny tissue. They wore a dark apron stiff with old stains.

“I’m glad,” they said softly. “You can help me understand.”

My mouth opened but only a hoarse rasp emerged. “Who… who are you?”

“They called me lucky. Congenital analgesia. No pain. But pain is how you know you’re alive.”

They raised a hand. A hypodermic needle pierced the fleshy web between thumb and forefinger. No blood. The wound had been cauterized. They twisted the steel shaft as if tuning an instrument. “This should hurt,” they whispered. “But it’s only pressure. Tell me — what would this feel like to you?”

I stared at the hole in their hand, nausea rising like acid. “Like… burning glass,” I croaked. “Glass under the skin.”
Their pupils dilated. “Burning glass,” they repeated. “Better than textbooks.”

They lowered me from the ceiling and bolted me into a wooden chair stained dark. My ankles were duct-taped to the legs; my wrists bound behind me. They draped a blanket across my shoulders — smelling of rust and bleach — like a caretaker preparing a patient.

“You’ll stay warmer this way,” they said. “Shivering corrupts the data.”

A clipboard appeared with fifty blank lines under Pain Vocabulary.

They began on themselves: hands plunged into ice water until their skin blued, then blasted with a blow dryer until flesh pinked, then blanched. Each time they asked me to describe it, my voice trembling.

“Needles under the skin,” I said. “Glass splinters. Heat like peeling sunburn alive.”

“Peel you,” they murmured, writing it down.

Then it was my turn. A rubber band snapping against my forearm, a pinch of tweezers to the thin skin between thumb and index. Even minor acts were magnified by terror, the stench, the inevitability of escalation.

By night (if it was night — the light never changed), my arms and hands trembled uncontrollably. My lips cracked from dryness. Tears streaked salt across my face. I pictured my apartment, my cat, the smell of coffee at dawn — normal life turning alien and unreachable.

On the second day, their fascination intensified. A small hammer, a steel plate, and a scalpel lay waiting on a tray.

They placed their own left hand flat on the plate, raised the hammer, and brought it down. A sound like a branch snapping. Their index finger bent at an unnatural angle. They didn’t blink.

“What would it feel like?” they hissed, eyes shining.
I gagged, bile rising. “Every nerve screaming… lightning inside… something wrong, ripped apart.”

They closed their eyes, whispering: “Wronged. Yes. That’s the one.”

Then came me. Rubber bands became clamps, tweezers became pinpricks of sharp metal. Every touch magnified by dread. My skin crawled. My nerves lit up like live wires.

I began crying without sound, tears running down my cheeks, soaking the blanket. My hands went numb. I tried to think of my name, my address, anything to anchor myself — but the basement smell dragged me back: bleach, rust, cooked meat.

Hallucinations began at the edges: whispers in corners, my own reflection in puddles where none existed, the sense of someone standing behind me even when I knew we were alone.

On the third day, they introduced electricity.
A car battery appeared on a metal cart, wires dangling from crude clips. Sparks popped when they tested the connection, filling the basement with the scent of ozone. Their broken finger was splinted, stained brown at the tips.

They sketched diagrams of the experiment on the wall with chalk, neat as blueprints. “This will be the one,” they whispered. “This will let me feel.”

First they shocked themselves. Sparks danced along pale flesh. Muscles twitched, lips parted, but they barely blinked.

Then they turned to me.
The wires bit into my forearms like insect mandibles. My muscles seized violently, my heart slamming so hard I thought it would rupture. The smell of ozone and burning cloth made me gag.

“Tell me,” they said. “Tell me what it feels like.”

“Fire,” I gasped. “Fire in my veins. Needles full of fire.”

They closed their eyes. “Fire in the veins. Yes…”

It was then I realized they weren’t immune to fear — only to pain. Their hand trembled over the switch. Their breathing came fast. A flicker of uncertainty crossed their eyes as I began whispering.

“You’re doing it wrong,” I rasped. “Pain isn’t just sensation — it’s fear, helplessness, losing control. You have to let go.”

They tilted their head. “Fear. Losing control.”

“Yes,” I whispered, throat raw. “That’s the key.”

By the end of the third day, my reality had thinned to a filament.

My skin was a map of bruises and pinpricks.
My muscles trembled uncontrollably.
My mind slipped in and out of hallucination.
Memories of sunlight and human voices seemed like a book I’d read long ago.

But a seed had taken root: the understanding that fear was their weakness, and my only way out.

When I came to again, there was no sense of day or night — just the single green bulb above me and a hollow ache through my arms and legs. My wrists were raw; the skin beneath the duct tape had turned angry red. My teeth chattered before I realized they’d placed a metal basin in front of me.

“Ice first,” they murmured. Their voice was thin from sleeplessness but eager.

They seized my hands, wrists clamped like a vise, and plunged them into the basin. The water was so cold it felt sharp. My fingers went bone-white, then blue. Pain raced up my arms in jagged streaks, each nerve shattering into splinters. My throat convulsed. I couldn’t tell if the sound coming out of me was a sob or a laugh.
“Describe,” they ordered, eyes on me as if I were the only object in the room.

“Like… a hundred knives in the marrow… like my bones are glass and someone’s rattling them,” I whispered.
They nodded, scribbling notes. Then, without warning, they drew my hands out and pressed warm cloths doused with some chemical that burned as it thawed my skin. The agony multiplied. My flesh felt as if it were peeling, nerve endings sparking like loose wires.

I thought of mornings in my apartment: sunlight cutting across a wooden floor, my cat blinking at me from the couch. It made me dizzy with grief. I had to swallow back a scream that wasn’t about the pain but the memory of normalcy.

“Shivering corrupts data,” they murmured again, almost fondly, and wrapped my shoulders in the damp blanket.

They rolled in the battery again. This time the wires were tipped with small clamps instead of crude paddles. Sparks popped when the clips met. Ozone stung my throat, metallic and acrid.

They clamped the wires to their own forearm first. The muscle jumped, the skin quivered, but they only breathed harder, eyes wide as though at the edge of revelation.

Then they turned to me.

When the current hit, my body went rigid. My jaw locked. My heart banged like a fist against my ribs. A taste like pennies filled my mouth. For a moment I thought my vision had shattered into glass shards.

“Tell me,” they whispered. “Tell me what it is.”

“It’s… fire inside a cage,” I rasped. “Like metal claws dragging through me. Like… like my blood turned to bees.”

They shuddered with a kind of hunger. “Blood turned to bees,” they repeated, writing furiously.

Something cracked inside me then. Between the burning of my skin and the trembling of my heart, I realized they were trembling too — not from pain but from anticipation, from their own strange excitement. And I began to see the thin seam of weakness: fear.

I woke to find a steel contraption standing in the center of the basement. It looked like a chair and a trap had been fused together: clamps for wrists and ankles, a collar brace, and a frame of steel rods.

“I built this for me,” they said quietly. “You’ll help me use it.”

My own terror rose up like bile. But some small hard core inside me whispered, This is your chance.

“If you want it to work,” I murmured, making my voice tremble but also low, hypnotic, “you have to let me set it up. You can’t know what’s coming or it won’t work.”
They hesitated, then nodded.

I tightened the straps across their arms, their legs, their chest. Every buckle was a drumbeat in my ears. They shuddered as control slipped from their hands. Their breath came quick, pupils dilated.

“You have to believe you can’t escape,” I whispered near their ear.

“Yes,” they breathed. “Yes. Show me.”

I clipped the battery wires to the metal pads at the armrests. Their muscles twitched under the clamps. A guttural sound escaped them — not pain but the first hint of genuine panic.

I could almost feel their terror radiating off them, electric, contagious. My own chest ached with adrenaline. I memorized their breathing, their expression. This is how they’ll break.

The next day they tried a different approach. No implements. No lights except a low, pulsing glow from a bulb strung somewhere behind me. They left me alone for what felt like hours.

Dripping pipes became a heartbeat. Shadows in the corners flexed and turned toward me like living things. I began to hear faint footsteps that weren’t there, a low voice humming words I couldn’t quite make out. My own voice whispered back without my consent.

I pressed my forehead against my knees and tried to remember the layout of my apartment, the taste of oranges, the texture of my cat’s fur. Each memory warped as soon as I called it up, turning into something grotesque.

When they returned, they stood silently, head tilted, studying me as if my hallucinations were as important as my flesh.

“You’re breaking,” they said softly. “Fear amplifies everything.”

“Yes,” I murmured hoarsely, realizing I could weaponize that truth.

By the eighth day, my sense of time had shredded. I measured it only by the sound of the pipes and the tremors of my own heart.

They brought back the ice water, the clamps, the battery, combining everything in rapid succession: cold so deep it burned, then heat, then electric shocks. My body reacted before my mind could; spasms, tears, animal sounds I barely recognized as mine.

But beneath the horror, I was learning. Learning their patterns. Learning how their breath changed when they were afraid. Learning how to speak in the tone that made them hesitate.

And a strange clarity came with that learning — a knowledge that if I could hold on a little longer, I could turn their hunger for understanding into their undoing.

When I woke, the green bulb flickered erratically, throwing knife-thin shadows across the cinder blocks. My throat felt sandpaper-raw from screaming the day before. On the floor near me lay a spiral notebook open to a fresh page. Their handwriting crawled across it, neat but frantic, filled with diagrams and phrases:
“PAIN = LIFE”
 “FIND THE EDGE”
 “SHE KNOWS MORE”

For a long time I stared at the words until they seemed to crawl like insects. The last line was underlined three times. She knows more. My stomach lurched — they had begun to believe in me as a kind of oracle.
They entered with a tray of syringes, their eyes bloodshot. “Tell me about hunger,” they murmured. “Tell me about deprivation.”

They had not eaten either. Their hands shook. They placed the syringes down, then held one up, examining the needle’s shine. I realized in a rush: their obsession was hollowing them out. If I could deepen their dependence on my words, I could pry the cracks wider.
I whispered: “If you want to understand deprivation…you have to give up something. Something you need.”

They hesitated, breath trembling. “What?”

“Sleep,” I murmured. “Close your eyes in the chair. I’ll record everything.”

They stared at me a long time, then at the syringes, then at the chair. Slowly, almost reverently, they sat.
I strapped them in again. The steel frame clanged faintly with each buckle. My fingers shook, but I masked it with clinical efficiency. They closed their eyes, trusting me. A tremor of triumph passed through me like static.

“You’ll feel nothing,” they whispered.

“You want to learn something,” I replied. “That means letting go.”

I clipped sensors to their skin — thin wires, a heart monitor I’d fashioned from scraps, anything to look real. Then, as they drifted in the edge of sleep, I whispered small things: “Your hands are heavy. Your breath slows. You are weaker than you think.”

They twitched. Their eyes flickered beneath lids.
I did not harm them yet. I only left them strapped, alone, as I backed away to a far corner. In that corner, hidden beneath a crate, I’d found a rusted screwdriver days before. I palmed it now, feeling the weight, the point. For the first time, the tool was in my hand.

They woke groggy. The green bulb had burned out sometime in the night, plunging everything into a dense amber glow from a backup lamp. Their voice was thin: “What did you see?”

“Everything,” I said. “You’re closer to the edge now.”
I handed them a cracked mirror I’d scavenged. “Look at yourself.”

They stared. Their pupils dilated, skin pale and damp with sweat. For the first time, I saw something like shame flicker across their features. They looked as if they’d aged ten years overnight.

“You need me,” I whispered. “You can’t understand pain alone. You’ll destroy yourself before you find it.”

They clutched the mirror. It slipped and cut their palm. Blood welled up, dark and slow. They stared at it, fascinated and horrified at once. “I…can’t feel it,” they murmured.

I leaned close: “But you’re bleeding. That’s the truth your nerves can’t hide.”

They shuddered. A tremor ran through their whole body. They were starting to doubt their invincibility — the one thing keeping them upright.

Food came less and less. Their hands shook when they tried to pour water. Their speech frayed, full of unfinished sentences. They had begun to smell sour, like someone fevered.

They still performed small torments — ice water, clamps — but they were half-hearted now, distracted. Each time they struck, their eyes darted to me as if asking permission.

That day I didn’t scream. I stared straight through them, whispering descriptions without being prompted: “Hot needles under my skin. Glass storm. Nerves screaming.” It unnerved them more than any cry.

“You’re not afraid,” they muttered.

“I’m past fear,” I said. “But you’re not.”

Their hands trembled so badly the clamp slipped and snapped against their own thumb. They hissed, startled, as if the absence of pain now frightened them more than the idea of pain itself.

They slept strapped in the chair that night. I had done the straps so tight their hands tinged purple. While they snored shallowly, I crept around the basement, mapping every corner, every bolt. I found the fuse box, the breaker, the small window high on the wall crusted with grime.

I tested the screwdriver against the window frame. Metal squealed softly but didn’t break. Yet. I knew with time I could pry it loose.

I also knew time was running out. They were spiraling fast, and a spiraling captor could still kill me by accident. I would have to break free during one of their experiments, when their hands were full.

I returned to them and whispered at their ear, not loud enough to wake them: “You wanted to know pain. I’ll show you. I’ll make you feel everything.”

The day began with them trying to repeat the ice-and-shock experiment. Their motions were clumsy. The battery slipped from their grasp, clanged to the floor, sending a spark. They flinched like a spooked animal.

“Let me help,” I murmured. I steadied the wires, set the clamps, murmured clinical observations. They sagged with relief, as if my calmness anchored them.
Then, in a moment of distraction, I looped one of the wires around their wrist instead of mine. My heart hammered so loud I thought they could hear it.

“You’re trembling,” I said softly.

They looked at me, eyes wide. “Describe,” they whispered, but their voice cracked.

I closed the circuit.
For the first time, they jerked, face contorting in a grimace that was almost pain but not quite — more like terror, the body’s reflex without the nerve’s permission. They gasped. Their knees buckled.

“It’s…nothing…” they whispered. But their eyes said otherwise.

I leaned close. “This is what you wanted. This is how it begins.”

I turned up the current. Their arms convulsed, head snapping back against the brace. The sight filled me with a surge of something dark and clean — not joy, but release. My hands no longer shook.

“You feel it,” I hissed. “You feel it now.”

Their mouth worked soundlessly. They were trying to form words but could not. I reached for the screwdriver, hidden in my waistband, and pressed the point just above their collarbone.

“Your experiments are over,” I said.

They slumped in the chair like a puppet with the strings cut. The greenish light trembled on their sweat-slick face; their eyes were two black pools reflecting me back. For the first time since I’d been dragged into the basement, the air didn’t feel like a lid pressing down on me — it felt full of cracks.

“You’re nothing without control,” I whispered. “And you’ve lost it.”

They twitched, lips barely moving. “More…please…”
It wasn’t triumph I felt then but a bitter, metallic taste, like licking a battery. I realized this was my last chance; if I waited even another day, they might recover, or kill me in some erratic gesture. My fingers moved almost on their own, tightening the last strap across their chest until it creaked.

I pressed my palm against their sternum. The heart under my hand beat quick and hard, an animal trying to claw its way out. My own heart matched it. For a moment we were one trembling system, predator and prey trading places so quickly it became meaningless.
Then I pulled away.

The high window glowed faintly with sodium-orange light from outside. I climbed onto a crate, balancing on bare feet slippery with sweat. The screwdriver dug into my palm. Each squeal of metal as I worked the frame felt like a gunshot. My breath came in ragged bursts; my teeth chattered from adrenaline.

Below me the chair creaked. They stirred, but the straps held. Their voice, hoarse: “Where…going…”
I ignored it, wrenching harder. Rust flaked onto my arms, stinging like sparks. My wrists screamed from old restraints. A piece of the frame gave with a dry snap.
“Don’t leave,” they croaked. “You’re the only…one…”

The screwdriver slipped, skittering to the floor with a clank. I almost sobbed. I dropped back down, snatched it up, and returned to the window. My hands shook so badly I could barely fit the tip into the crack. My vision blurred with tears.

Finally, with a sound like a rib breaking, the frame popped free. Cold night air slapped my face, smelling of rain and diesel and something clean — the first clean smell in days. I wanted to bury my nose in it like a starving person finding food.

The opening was barely wider than my shoulders. Shards of glass jutted from the edges like teeth. I wrapped my hands in a filthy rag and hauled myself up. Every inch of my skin screamed as glass nicked me. My knees scraped the sill, opening new cuts. But compared to what had been done to me inside, the pain was clarifying, almost holy.

I was halfway out when a sound rose from below: a ragged, animal wail. They were thrashing against the straps now, head jerking like a fish. For the first time they were loud, truly loud — a voice stripped of language.

“Come back,” they howled. “Come back!”

I hauled myself through the last gap and tumbled onto gravel outside. I lay there on my back staring at the stars, my chest convulsing. The sky was huge and black and indifferent. The sodium light turned my tears into small coins on my cheeks.

My legs felt like brittle twigs but they moved. Gravel to asphalt, asphalt to an empty lot, lot to a chain-link fence. Each footstep was an explosion of nerve endings, but it was movement, and movement was freedom. I could feel the shape of my own body again, not as an object in a room but as something moving through space.

I didn’t look back. I didn’t have to; their cries bled out through the window and echoed across the lot like a dying animal. The sound pushed me faster.

I stumbled onto a street, half-lit by an old sodium lamp. A payphone stood there like an artifact from another era. I lunged for it, hands shaking so violently I almost dropped the receiver. The number for 911 came out of me as a sob.

“Help,” I croaked. “Basement. Kidnapper. Hurry…”

When the cruisers came, blue and red lights washing over the industrial yard, I crumpled at the edge of the lot. Their boots thudded around me, voices sharp and clipped. Hands guided me into a blanket, into the back of an ambulance. Someone asked my name. It took three tries to remember it.

I heard shouting from the basement. Then silence. Then radio chatter.

One officer returned, face pale. “There’s no one down there,” he said quietly to a colleague. “Just a chair bolted to the floor.”

Fluorescent lights again — but soft, clean, sterile. IV tubing snaked into my arm, dripping clear fluid. Nurses murmured. Someone swabbed my cuts. The antiseptic smell made me gag. Every time I closed my eyes I saw diagrams on butcher paper, needles gleaming under green light.

A psychiatrist sat by my bed. “You’re safe now,” she said gently. “You were very brave.”

I stared at her and thought: Brave? No. Just the rat that finally found a hole.

At night I lay awake listening to the beep of monitors. My body was healing but my mind kept replaying the chair, the voice, the humming.

A week later, back in my apartment, the nightmares had begun to shift. Sometimes in them I wasn’t the one strapped to the chair — I was the one doing the strapping, clinical and calm. I woke with my own hands clutching the sheets like restraints.

That morning an email arrived. No subject. No text. Just an attachment.

I clicked. It was a grainy photograph of my street taken from across the road. In the lower corner: a gloved hand holding a hypodermic needle, faintly gleaming. Under the image, a single line:

“I think I felt it this time. Thank you.”

I sat frozen, staring at the screen. The city outside went on as if nothing had changed. But inside me, the world tilted, and I realized the experiment wasn’t over — not for either of us.

I’m a down-to-earth guy who’s well traveled with a professional career who's navigating a unique living situation right now. For financial and family reasons, I still share a home with my ex-wife (separate parts of the house). Just to be clear there is no romance, intimacy or chance we would get back together. We co-parent our kids under the same roof, and that’s where it begins and ends.

Semi-fit gym guy, clean shaven(head and face), enjoy going to the gym, bike riding, concerts, and social get together

What I’m Looking For:
I’d like to meet a person locally that I can genuinely connect with. Ideally, someone open-minded who understands that life isn’t always picture-perfect. I’m not looking to juggle multiple people, just hoping to build something real with the right person. A friends-with-benefits situation could work if that’s where things start, but if it naturally grows into something deeper, I’d be more than open to that.

About You:
You’re mature, understanding, and value honesty. Someone who wants a steady, no-games connection, whether it’s sharing laughs over coffee, spending time together, or exploring something more.

Growth Vault's AI Content Blueprints Are Exploding Right NOW 🔥,"**Ever feel like you’re stuck in a never-ending cycle of posting content manually?** 😩 You sit down with your coffee, ready to share something brilliant with the world, but instead, you’re hitting refresh for the millionth time while your brain runs dry. Let’s be real; who has time for that?! 

**Enter Growth Vault’s AI Content Blueprints.** 🚀 These little gems are changing the game, and I’m seriously excited to see how they’re exploding right now! Here’s why we should all ditch the manual grind and embrace the *future* of content creation:

- **Time-Saver Extraordinaire:** Imagine being able to crank out content without spending your entire day doing it. What if I told you that these AI blueprints can whip up engaging content in a fraction of the time? Think of all that extra time for… binge-watching your favorite series. Or, you know, actually enjoying life. 😉

- **Creativity Unleashed:** Once you hand off the repetitive posting tasks to AI, your creative brain can finally breathe! You’ll have more headspace for brainstorming innovative ideas that really resonate with your audience. Can you say “content renaissance”? 

- **Consistency is Key:** Want to grow your audience? You’ve GOT to stay consistent, and that’s where these blueprints shine. These tools help maintain a steady flow of content without the burnout. Plus, more content = more engagement. Can I get an *amen*? 🙌

- **Data-Driven Decisions:** These AI tools aren’t just throwing random content out into the void. They analyze what works, helping you fine-tune your strategy to create waves instead of ripples. My favorite part? You can focus on content that drives results instead of second-guessing every post.

- **Stress Less, Do More:** We’ve all experienced that overwhelming feeling when the “perfect” post is due in an hour. With AI by your side, you can wave goodbye to that stress. Talk about a game changer, am I right? 

Now, I get it; the tech can be intimidating sometimes. But honestly? If a *complete newbie* like me can figure this out and leverage AI effectively, so can you. I mean, remember when we were first introduced to TikTok? It seemed wild, but now we can’t imagine life without it. 

Is anyone else here already using Growth Vault’s blueprints? What are your favorite features? Let’s share our journeys and tips. Who knows? We might just inspire someone to stop the manual madness and step into the future together! 💡✨",1,1759539219.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

1nxgb1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nxgb1i/my_26f_by_32m_says_that_i_dont_spend_enough_time/,My (26F) by (32M) says that I don’t spend enough time with him and doesn’t like that I’m too busy. Advice on best way to make time for a bf?,"I (26F) have an admittedly busy schedule. My bf (32M) has been saying that I’m too busy and that I don’t make enough time for him. This was after a particularly busy week. I tried to text and call him but he wasn’t responding for a couple days (just saying stuff like “I’m busy” or “can’t call” via text. After two days, we were finally able to talk and said that he was upset because i ‘make time for everyone and everything else, but not for him’.

On the one hand, I can see where he’s coming from. I am super busy with a lot going on. And if he’s feeling neglected or left out, then what he’s feeling is valid. On the other hand, I disagreed with him saying that I make time for everyone else. This turned into an argument and I feel like my perspective wasn’t being heard. 

So my life looks like this. I work remotely from 8-2pm everyday. It’s a corporate consulting job so there’s tons of travel. I’m also taking a swim class at the local community college once a week around 5pm. My sister (25F) who’s still in college commutes and stays at my apartment Sunday and Wednesday nights. I volunteer at the animal shelter once a month and also do pet sitting on the side. I have a pretty good social group, with 3 or so friends in town, and a friend group that’s spread out. All of us have flexible corporate jobs do we travel maybe once every two months from city to city around the US (NY, SF, Austin, Boston, Miami and me in Detroit). Every Tuesday I spend time with my one friend ‘Jenny’ and every Thursday I spend time with my other fiend ‘Ally’. I usually spend my weekends and maybe 1-2 days in the week with my bf. However, i haven’t been seeing him that much during the week. 

On the surface I look really busy, but most of the times I spending time with other people I wouldn’t be able to spend time with my bf anyways. Or, he can spend time with me, but choses not to. 

For example, I see Jenny once a week because we both work remote. This is usually at a coffee shop during work hours. Then I’m free after work. 

Ally’s job is right across from my apartment so we usually have lunch together on her lunch breaks at my place. 

My bf’s also has a hybrid/flexible work schedule. He can work remote or in the office, and can choose his hours of work. He usually choses to work from 11:30-7pm in the office (some of his coworkers do 9-5 or 8-4). I’ve asked him if he’d like to work remotely together at a coffee shop, and he said no he likes the office. 

My swim class is from 5-6 on Wednesdays so he’s usually at work anyways.

I usually pet sit while I work remote at home. This is either doggy daycare from 9-3 or 30 minute dog walking on my lunch break. 

For travel, our company lets us take people with us! My coworker takes her husband and kids. Another took her fiancé on the work trip to Germany. Whenever I asked if he’d like to come, he usually says no because he’d feel awkward around my coworkers. 

I’ve also invited him on my friend trips and he’s said the same thing. 

I get that not everyone like to volunteer, but it’s something I’m passionate about. I’ve asked him if he’d be open to volunteering with me but he also declined- which fair, animal shelter are a lot. 

Lastly, he’s upset that my sister stays with me. I get that, but whenever shes over she is usually sleeping or in my office doing homework. She could literally care less what im doing. I’ve told him this before but he’s said that “i should spend time with my sister” instead of coming to his place. Again, i feel like i wasn’t being heard. 

I told him all of this and that i think the issue has more to do with our free time not aligning. I’m usually free after 2pm on weekdays. He’s free after 7pm and goes to bed around 2am. For most of last year, I’d got to his place in the evening. But this led to me going to bed around 1 or 2 and still having to wake up at 7 for work. I was always tired and was running on Celsius and adhd meds. A couple months ago, after a psych and physical exam I told him that i needed to prioritize my sleep schedule. He said he understood when i said that I couldn’t follow his sleep schedule anymore. 

His response to all of this was that I should stop doing pet sitting, volunteering and to travel with my friends less. I agreed that instead of traveling with my friends we could take more trips together, he said yes but then said it might be too expensive (he makes 80k i make 95 + 8k from pet sitting). He also suggested that my sister could stay with one of my other siblings (none of which she likes and they all have little kids in the house). I told him that pet sitting makes up a good part of my income and that he’s at work anyways so I’m not sure how it makes a difference. He then said “the reason I’m tired throughout the day is because of pet sitting, volunteering, my sister and my friends and that’s the reason I didn’t have energy to stay up with him at night and was loosing sleep”. 

I asked him why he couldn’t just wake up earlier and go to work at 9 so that we’d have more time during the day. He then said it wasn’t fair for me to ask him to change his work schedule because his job is ‘important’ (he does research on infectious diseases at the local university). At that point I lost it and said he was being selfish. 


Part of me wonders if I should take stuff off my plate. The other part of me wonders what’s normal for partners spending time with each other when then both have social and work lives. Any advice is welcome. 

TLDR; Bf 32M wants me 26F to do less social activities, volunteer and work less to spend time with him. However, most of the time I’m ’busy’ is when he’s at work. He has the choice to adjust his schedule to better fit with mine, but choses not to. Advice on syncing schedules and working through this argument? ",6,1759539022.0,relationship_advice,9,1.0,False

I’m a 36-year-old nerd from New England who lives for conventions, gaming, and cosplay. Fun fact: I even made my own dating site—and it actually got featured on the news.

Cosplay has given me a great community, whether I’m rocking Eddie Munson from Stranger Things or Leon from Resident Evil. I stay active, take care of myself, and I have an odd talent for winning raffles and sweepstakes (seriously, it happens way too often).

Now for the real talk: I’ve never been in a relationship before. Not because I didn’t want to, but because of shyness, timing, and life just not lining up. I’ve grown a lot, though, and I’m ready for something genuine. If you’re kind, nerdy (or at least nerd-friendly), and believe in connection over perfection, I think we could click.

Cosplay isn’t required—what matters is having fun, sharing laughs, and seeing where things go. If you’re nearby, I’d love to start with something simple, like grabbing a coffee.

1nxg9z8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nxg9z8,"Battle Brothers was the game that inspired us to get into game dev back in 2021. Four years later, our TRPG Lost in the Open launched and we just had to share it with you guys.","Howdy everyone! I’m Rafael, the lead dev at Black Voyage Games, a small studio based in Stockholm, and last Friday, after nearly 4 years of late nights and hectoliters of coffee, we’ve finally released our very first game into Early Access: [Lost In The Open](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2027380/Lost_In_The_Open/).

This low fantasy TRPG project has been our passion for a long time, and while it’s far from perfect, it’s something we’ve poured all our heart into! And a lot of that inspiration owes especially to Battle Brothers. The combat of BB is stellar, and we wanted to replicate that level of quality, combining it also with some other games like FTL whose core idea has inspired us since we started working on it.

You take on the role of King Nrvesk, who’s just survived an assassination attempt and now finds himself a fugitive in savage lands. With only a ragtag band of followers at your side, you’re forced to navigate a bleak, dangerous land where everyone either wants you dead or wants to use you for their own gain. Trust is fleeting, danger is constant, and every run edges you closer to returning to your throne. Or ending in tragedy if the King falls.

We know the Battle Brothers community understands the tension of harsh survival, the bittersweet bonds with mercenaries who might not live to see the next dawn, and the satisfaction of clawing through impossible odds. That’s the spirit we’ve tried to capture here.

We’d be honored if you gave Lost In The Open a look, shared your thoughts and maybe even joined us on this long road of shaping the game into what it’s meant to be. There’s also a free demo out in addition to the EA release, if you just want a peek.

Thanks for reading, and for letting us share this moment with you. ❤️",128,1759538941.0,BattleBrothers,21,0.95,False

I’m working on an idea for a **university-exclusive dating + social app** — something that feels more genuine than Tinder and less intense than Hinge. The goal is to make connecting with people on your own campus easier, safer, and less awkward (whether that’s for dating, friendship, or just grabbing coffee).

But before building anything, I want to **hear from real students**:

* What frustrates you about current dating apps on campus?
* What features would make you actually *want* to use a campus-only one?
* Would you prefer casual meetups (like coffee/study buddy mode) or something relationship-focused?
* Any creative or fun ideas you wish a dating app had?

I’d love to hear your honest opinions — even if it’s “don’t make another dating app.”  
Your feedback could shape how the next generation of university social apps is built.

Thanks in advance!",2,1759538806.0,umanitoba,7,0.58,False

I’m a 29 y/o working professional based in Cavite and I’m on the lookout for someone who’s also into food and cafe hopping. Would be cool to find a buddy (or even a small group) who’s down for spontaneous food trips or chill coffee sessions on weekends or weekdays afternoon - night!

I'm 5’10”, easy on the eyes (so they say lol), and a yapper by nature — more of a “kuya” figure if that matters 😅 

I’ve got a car, so I don’t mind picking someone up occasionally if you're nearby or if we’re running errands before/after.

📍 Preferred areas:

* Dasmariñas
* Silang
* Tagaytay
* General Trias
* Trece
*Tanza
* Imus
*Bacoor
* GMA
* Carmona
* Biñan
* San Pedro
*Santa Rosa
*Cabuyao
  (+ anywhere nearby those spots is still cool with me!)

If you’re also a foodie or just looking for someone to explore new restos or quiet cafes with, hit me up through chat or comment down below. Let’s make new memories over good food and better convos.

43-year-old federal employee , currently rediscovering what free time means thanks to the Federal Shutdown 2025: Electric Bugaloo Redux (yes, we're doing sequels now. Hollywood has clearly taken over Congress).

I made it through the DOGEing with my sanity (mostly) intact and now find myself with an abundance of coffee, food pics, memes, existential questions, and no coworkers to annoy. So I'm turning to Reddit. Is that a mistake? Time will tell.

Looking to chat with just about anyone who’s cool with casual conversation, food pics, government shutdown gallows humor, or deep dives into conspiracy theories at 2am. Bonus points if you know where “Birthdays was the worst days / Now we sip champagne when we thirsty” is from.

Whether you’re bored, procrastinating, or just vibing through life let’s chat! I promise to only bring up work furloughs like, once every 10 messages. Maybe.

He wanted to show him a bit around his place, and we watched some Netflix.  
He put out a chair for me to sit on, but then later, kept asking me to sit with him (on the floor, on a pillow or something). I kept politely declining, and he asked me if I was feeling shy, that he wanted to watch it sitting together, and have conversation.

It made me uncomfortable that he was asking me a few times.

It's hard to know how to interpret it. He was probably just being friendly (I believe he's outgoing). But... as a woman, how would you have taken it? And if you're man, why might a guy do that? Could I be mistaking it for him just being very friendly?",3,1759538696.0,CatholicWomen,12,0.8,False
