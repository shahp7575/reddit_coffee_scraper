1hr5tll,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1hr5tll/starting_the_process_to_no_caffeine_today/,starting the process to no caffeine today,"I've been drinking coffee for about 30 years. Once, about ten years ago, I stopped cold turkey for two months. But besides that I've been at it for a long time. 

I generally like my coffee strong. So I've been drinking 2-3 cups of strong coffee a day for years, decades in fact. Sometimes 4 cups. 

My motivation is sleep...my sleep hygeine has gone to shit. It's a combination of many things (smartphones and social media, lack of exercise, increased stress at work, general anxiety about myself and the world at large, getting older), and while it will take time to figure out how to navigate life with more exercise, better diet, less anxiety, less smartphone addiction, I know I can start by cutting out the chemical additive of caffeine. 

Coffee has run its course with me...it gives me a boost but then falls into a lull, it drys me out / feeling dehydrated (which i then counter with drinking lots of water, and thus I pee like 20 times a day), my teeth are stained, at work its difficult to find time to brush me teeth so I get the afternoon coffee breath, and of course, my mind races in like seven directions at once so I find myself sort of action prone without any solid focus. Just reactive to life.

Anyway, so my plan is to cut it down to one cup of coffee starting today. The month of January will be one cup in the morning, nothing else. I know I'll get fatigued in the afternoon after lunch, but I'll just have to either power through it (at work especially) or take a small nap on my days off. February I'll cut it down to a 50/50 mix of regular and decaf and go with that for a month. And in March, I'll take a day or two off from work and go cold turkey ... leave myself like 5 days to laze around for the acute phase. Eventually I'll return to work and like anyone else who has successfully quit, I'll have to just push my way through until the time comes when my body and mind have been fully rid of the effects of long time caffeine use.",2,1735747577.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

1hr5oav,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1hr5oav/my_neighbor_perched_himself_on_top_of_a_pine_tree/,"My neighbor perched himself on top of a pine tree and never came down. The sheriff of our small town did the same, only a day later.","When Henry perched himself atop that pine tree, I thought he’d just lost his damn mind. No amount of convincing from Jim or the sheriff could coax him down. He ascended into the canopy and never returned.

Never returned alive, at least.

He’d always been an eccentric. It wasn’t easy living next-door to Henry, but it certainly wasn’t dull, either. Between the small city of birdhouses he maintained around the perimeter of his two-story home, the free homebrewed mead that appeared on our doorstep the first of every month, and the early morning French Horn recitals, he was a handful.

I rather liked the ongoing spectacle, all things considered. Jim never really saw the humor in Henry’s mania. That said, crippling agoraphobia has prevented me from leaving the house for almost a year now, so my threshold for what qualifies as entertainment is quite a low bar to clear.

My husband was on his way to confront Henry about his newest hobby, metal detecting, when he first scaled that twenty-foot tall pine in our backyard. It wasn’t the act of metal detecting that bothered Jim - it was the many untended holes that vexed him. The sixty-something year old found himself too lost in paroxysms of archeological fervor to bother filling the quarries back up with soil after he made them. After days of steady excavation, it looked like Henry had been sweeping his property for landmines.

That morning, Jim saw the man creeping towards the edge of the forest thirty yards from our kitchen window, and he sprang into action. If I’m recalling correctly, he shouted something like, “*I’m going to nip this in the bud*” as he jogged out the front door, which now carries a cruel cosmic irony when examined in retrospect.

The scene unfolded before me through the dusty lens of our den’s cheap telescope, which has a lovely panoramic view of the backyard and the thicket beyond from where we keep it.

As much as it pains me to admit it, fear of the space outside my house has turned me into a bit of a snoop.

Jim sauntered up to our neighbor, but Henry didn’t turn around to greet him. Nor did he stop lurching forward. He didn't even react to Jim, as far as I could tell. It was like he was moving in slow-motion autopilot. Although irritated, it wasn’t like my husband’s molten rage drove Henry to the top of that pine out of a concern for his safety.

No matter what Jim did or said, Henry remained locked in an impenetrable trance. A man on a mission.

He gave up on catching Henry’s attention by the time he had made it three quarters of the way up. As Jim started to walk back, I kept watching. Henry, the sleepwalker, never changed his pace. Each identical movement was eerily slow and deliberate. After reaching the apex, he positioned himself to face our home, extended both arms palms up in front of his chest, and became impossibly still. An unblinking gargoyle baking in the early morning summer sun.

At least, I thought he was stationary.

When I checked on him an hour later through the telescope, however, he had spun his torso about thirty degrees west. Arms still extended, eyes still open, but his body had turned. Concerned and captivated in equal measure, I began observing him continuously.

While I watched, nothing seemed to change, and I was becoming progressively unnerved by his uncanny stillness. But when I paused my vigil after about twenty minutes, something occurred to me - he *was* moving. I could tell when I brought my eye away from the telescope. Looking through the den window, his torso had clearly pivoted another fifteen degrees clockwise. The motion was just so slow that I found it hard to perceive in real time.

I put my eye back to the lens of the telescope.

Henry’s skin was developing a red sheen. His unblinking eyes were dry and tinged with brown specks, like overcooked egg whites.

That’s when I called the sheriff.

The grizzled southerner and his doe-eyed deputy arrived quickly, seeing as they were only a three-minute drive down the road. They stood at the base of that pine for an hour, but couldn’t find the language to persuade Henry down either. Flustered and out of patience, the sheriff told us he would involve the fire department tomorrow if Henry remained in the tree.

When night fell, I couldn’t visualize Henry through the telescope anymore. But I could *hear* him. From our bedroom window, faintly sobbing somewhere in the blackness.

I found myself posted up in the den before the sun even rose, my mind burning with curiosity. Black coffee trickled down my throat, warming my marrow. For a moment, I felt ashamed of the excitement rumbling around in my chest.

The more I reflected on the sensation, however, the more I understood it. Journalism used to be my life before the cumulative horrors I documented manifested as a crippling fear of the world. In the grand scheme of things, this stakeout was pathetic. It didn't hold a candle to what I had done before, in a past life. But fascination, not dread, drove me to do it, and that held value.

Henry had not moved from his steeple, and by the time the sun appeared over the horizon, he had stifled his tears. His biceps were red and swollen, likely muscle breakdown from keeping them outstretched in the same position for over twenty-four hours.

A little after eight, Jim made his way downstairs. He was unusually quiet. Initially, I attributed his silence to low-level distress, secondary to Henry’s unexplained behavior. When I finally noticed him, he was standing by the front door, away from the view of our neighbor’s macabre display.

I asked him if he was doing alright, and he replied with an affirmative grunt, so I left him be.

Around noon, I felt a theory crystallize in my skull. Henry was twisting around the tree’s axis with a pace and direction identical to yesterday's. He must be watching something, I thought. That’s when it hit me.

Henry was angling his eyes and his body to constantly face the sun.

My mind scrambled to process this observation, but Jim’s heavy breathing behind me broke my concentration. It scared the shit out of me because I didn’t hear him approach. Startled, I urged him to explain what the hell he was doing.

*“Oh…fixing clock,”* he replied.

Except there was no clock. In actuality, he had his face pressed to the window that was to the right of me. He was staring at something.

I didn’t want to believe it at first. But by the afternoon, I was forced to confront the realization. From where I sat in the den, I could see Henry’s back through the telescope, and when I moved my eye away, I could see Jim’s back, silently gazing forward.

Early that morning, he had been watching the sun rise from our front door, just the same as Henry had from atop the pine tree.

My husband was following the trajectory as well.

Before I could dial 9-1-1, the sheriff and his deputy appeared in my peripheral vision. My burst of relief was short-lived when I observed how they were walking. Their footfalls were languid and protracted, the same as Henry’s had been yesterday.

As their hands contacted two different pine trees in unison, I refocused the telescope on Henry. To my horror, they were not climbing the tree where my neighbor sat to rescue him.

The possessed men were scaling their own trees, each equidistant from Henry’s.

In a state of detached shock, I moved a shaky hand to my notebook to jot down one last detail I had noticed about Henry.

Tiny mushrooms had sprouted from his eye sockets, palms, and his open mouth. A robin rested on his forehead, nibbling at the growing fungus.

A wave of primal terror washed over me, and I sprinted from the chair to my front door, pausing as my hand twisted the knob.

I tried to force myself through the threshold. My head pivoted back to Jim for motivation, who hadn’t moved an inch, in spite of the noise of the chair and the telescope crashing to the floor when I sprang up.

Unable to overcome my agoraphobia, I instead sat down on the doormat and placed my head in my hands.

Whatever Henry succumbed to, it had spread to the sheriff, the deputy, and my husband. I contemplated calling 9-1-1, but what if it just spread to emergency medical services as well?

I’m not sure how long I lingered there, catatonic. The blood-chilling wails of my husband returned my consciousness to my body.

It had become night.

The absence of natural light transformed Jim into a messy human puddle on the kitchen floor.

I tiptoed over to my husband, doing my best to ignore the pangs of terror vibrating in my spine. He had simply crumbled where he stood when the sun set, knelling unnaturally with his chest and torso leaning against the wall below our kitchen window.

Despite knowing he wasn’t, I asked if he was okay a handful of times, receiving no reply.

Standing over him, I tilted his shoulder, trying to see his face. Jim limply fell over in response. He was still crying softly, eyes open but producing no tears.

That’s when I noticed his chest wasn’t moving.

He wasn’t breathing.

When I found the courage to check, he had no pulse, and I lost consciousness.

I woke up a few hours later.

Through the telescope, I could see my husband perched on a pine tree of his own, arms outstretched and eyes still open. Hellish choreography modeled by Henry, mimicked by the sheriff, the deputy, and Jim.

My current theory is as follows: Henry must have accidentally unearthed something old and terrible digging holes in his backyard. A parasitic fungus lying dormant under the soil, infecting everyone who went near with inhaled spores once it was exposed.

I’m going to make it outside today. I'll grab a shovel from the garage, and I'll fill every single hole Henry made with layers of dirt. Maybe I’ll survive uninfected, but I suspect I will succumb to whatever this thing is as well.

It’s the least I can do to honor Jim’s memory.

I’m taking the time to document and post this for two reasons.

First and foremost, don’t end up like me. I hid from the world because it felt safer. But it wasn’t safer, it was just easier, and I wasted precious time.

Secondly, if you see anyone perched on a tree, eyes following the trajectory of the sun, burn the tree down or run. Whatever you do, cover your mouth, because that robin ingested some of the fungus that grew from Henry, and may disseminate the spores as far as it can fly.

The start of its life cycle? It’s unclear, and I think that, unfortunately, the world may have an answer to that question in a few days.

Short summary: She’s been awful ever since I got pregnant, and the last time she stayed at our house, she behaved terribly. DH told her she’s not welcome in '24 unless she apologizes to me. She hasn’t apologized yet.

So, MIL sent a Christmas card and included my name on it. She’s been in contact with DH through messages and calls, but thankfully, she hasn’t contacted me. We didn't send her Christmas card.
I also didn’t wish her a happy birthday in November—DH wished her on behalf of both of us.

Last night around midnight, she messaged me with New Year wishes and wrote something like, “I wish you lots of warmth, love, and light in the new year, and above all, enjoy (LO’s name).”

I told DH about it, and he said 'good, ignore it'.

I asked him what the plan is for 2025 since she still hasn’t apologized to me. He said she keeps saying she misses her grandchild and thinks it’s a pity she can’t see LO. But when he brought up that she should maybe apologize to me, she went straight into pity mode and made it about herself and how she can't see LO. She also mentioned she won’t stay at our place anymore (like she usually does) and said it’s a long drive for her (3.5–4 hours one way). She suggested meeting halfway for coffee or something.

I told DH that unless she apologizes and acts somewhat normal, there won’t be any meetups.

This morning, I mentioned again that she messaged me, and I’m not sure what to do about it. DH repeated to just ignore it. I feel a little bad because I’m not usually the type to ignore people and their messages, but I think DH is right.

On the surface, it’s a mechanism where investors bet on the decline of a company's stock price, profiting from market downturns. But as the practice has evolved, so have the complexities, controversies, and questions surrounding its ethics and impact.

**What is Short Selling?**

Short selling involves borrowing shares of a company from a broker, selling them at the current market price, and later buying them back at a lower price to return to the lender. The difference between the selling price and the repurchase price constitutes the profit. For example, if an investor borrows and sells shares at $100 each and later buys them back at $80, they make a $20 profit per share.

This strategy hinges on the belief that the company’s stock will decline, making it inherently risky. If the stock price rises instead, short sellers face potentially unlimited losses, as there is no ceiling to how high a stock can go.

**The Opposite of Short Selling**

While short selling bets on a stock’s decline, the opposite is known as **going long** or buying stocks outright. This approach involves purchasing shares with the expectation that their value will increase over time, aligning with traditional investment principles. Another less-discussed opposite strategy is **short squeeze trading**, where traders buy heavily shorted stocks, forcing prices higher and pressuring short sellers to cover their positions, often at a loss.

**The Origins of Short Selling**

Short selling began as an innocent, niche practice in the early days of the stock market. It was designed as a way to provide liquidity and expose overvalued stocks. Dutch merchant Isaac Le Maire is credited with pioneering the practice in the 17th century, using it against the Dutch East India Company. Over time, the strategy gained traction, evolving from a tool for market correction to a sophisticated trading mechanism.

**Modern-Day Short Selling: The Rise of Activist Short Sellers**

In recent years, short selling has morphed into a powerful and sometimes controversial financial weapon wielded by firms like Hindenburg Research. These firms position themselves as market watchdogs, claiming to expose fraud, mismanagement, or overvaluation in companies. However, their methods and motives often spark heated debate.

**The Hindenburg Playbook**

Hindenburg and similar firms deploy investigative strategies that go beyond traditional market analysis:

* **Hiring Whistleblowers**: These firms actively seek out insiders willing to share sensitive information, often incentivizing them with rewards.
* **Legal Loopholes**: They exploit gray areas in the law to protect their activities and avoid repercussions.
* **Narrative Crafting**: Reports are meticulously crafted to paint a bleak picture of targeted companies, sometimes based on incomplete or disputed data.

While these tactics have uncovered legitimate cases of corporate fraud, critics argue that they can also instigate market panic, eroding investor confidence and damaging otherwise stable companies.

**Global Perspectives and Bans**

The ethical implications of short selling have led some governments to restrict or outright ban the practice. For example:

* **Europe**: During times of financial crisis, several European countries temporarily banned short selling to stabilize markets.
* **India**: The country imposes strict regulations on short selling, requiring transparency and limiting speculative activities.

These measures underscore the dual-edged nature of short selling—it can serve as a market corrector but also as a destabilizing force.

**Impact on Economies and Companies**

Short selling’s economic implications are vast. Activist short sellers argue that they play a critical role in holding corporations accountable. However, the financial fallout from aggressive short campaigns can be devastating:

* **Case Studies**:
   * *Luckin Coffee*: Hindenburg’s report alleging fraud led to the company’s collapse, wiping out billions in investor wealth.
   * *Adani Group*: A recent Hindenburg report caused the conglomerate’s stock to plummet, resulting in an estimated $100 billion loss in market value.
* **Economic Consequences**: These campaigns not only hurt individual investors but can ripple through economies, causing job losses and stifling innovation as companies divert resources to defend against allegations.

**The Role of Whistleblowers**

One of the most contentious aspects of modern short selling is the reliance on whistleblowers. While whistleblowing is essential for exposing corporate malfeasance, incentivizing it with monetary rewards raises ethical concerns. In some cases, whistleblowers are paid a percentage of recovered funds, creating a profit-driven motive that may skew their testimonies.

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and other agencies have also adopted this model, further blurring the lines between justice and financial gain.

**Regulatory Oversight and the Path Forward**

Regulators worldwide are grappling with how to balance short selling’s benefits and drawbacks. Stricter disclosure requirements, limits on speculative trading, and enhanced oversight of activist firms are some of the measures being considered. The goal is to curb market manipulation while preserving the strategy’s legitimate uses.

**Thoughts**

Short selling started as a benign market mechanism but has evolved into a powerful, polarizing tool. While it has exposed corporate fraud and inefficiency, its misuse has led to economic devastation and ethical dilemmas. As governments and regulators work to strike a balance, the debate over short selling’s role in modern finance continues to intensify.

Ultimately, the question remains: Can short selling be reined in to serve its intended purpose without enabling financial havoc? Only time—and regulation—will tell.

A healthy discussion welcome here :-)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hmtm7l/update\_aita\_for\_refusing\_to\_share\_my\_late\_dads/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hmtm7l/update_aita_for_refusing_to_share_my_late_dads/)

Many of you sent kind and thoughtful comments my way, and I truly appreciate all the support.

**Update:**

**Update:**

I never thought I’d be writing this, but my friend has made a choice so profound and daring that it feels straight out of a storybook—one of those moments where the hero takes control of their destiny. After months of enduring relentless harassment, betrayal, and threats, she’s finally decided to reclaim her life, no matter the cost. And honestly, I couldn’t be prouder of her courage.

Just a few days ago, she began the process of selling every immovable property tied to her inheritance. These weren’t just assets—they were fragments of her past, pieces of her father’s legacy that carried the weight of countless memories. From her father’s serene farmhouse to the apartment that became a prison of fear, she let them go, one by one. Watching her sign those papers wasn’t easy. I could see the silent tears she fought to hold back, the inner battle between grief and relief. But she said something that stayed with me: *“These aren’t memories anymore; they’re anchors. It’s time to let myself drift free.”*

After every sale was finalized, she meticulously funneled the money into secure accounts—layers upon layers of protection to ensure no one could touch what was now hers. It was as if she had transformed into a chess grandmaster, thinking ten moves ahead. She consulted with a trusted lawyer and a financial advisor, people she had vetted thoroughly, to make sure every step was airtight.

Then came the part that hit me the hardest: cutting ties. She changed her number, deleted all her social media, and left no forwarding address. Even I, one of the few people she still trusted, was left in the dark. She sent me a single message before disappearing: *“I’m safe. I’m free. Please don’t worry about me.”*

From what little she shared before going silent, she’s moved to a completely new city—one where her past can’t follow her. She’s taken a new name, blending into her surroundings with the grace of someone determined to start over. She’s renting a modest apartment and has enrolled in a course that excites her, a small step toward the career she’s always dreamed of. Her days are quiet now, filled with simple joys like morning walks and the smell of fresh coffee.

There’s a bittersweet ache in all of this. The girl who once couldn’t imagine a life beyond her family’s home has now stepped into a world that even I can’t fully picture. She’s a stranger to the life she left behind, and maybe even to me. But there’s beauty in that too—a reminder that we all have the power to become someone new when the world pushes us to the brink.

For those of you who have been following this journey, I hope this update brings some sense of closure. She’s chosen freedom—not just from the people who tried to break her but from the chains of fear and doubt that held her back for so long. While her story might sound like the final act of a drama, I know it’s just the beginning of something softer, quieter, and infinitely more hopeful.

Wherever she is now, I hope she’s found the peace she’s been chasing. If anyone deserves it, it’s her.",0,1735746761.0,AITAH,3,0.29,False

1hr5dii,https://www.reddit.com/r/Moccamaster/comments/1hr5dii/q_moccamaster_cup_one_acidity_and_brew_question/,Q: Moccamaster Cup One - Acidity and brew question,"Hi reddit,

I recently got myself a Moccamaster Cup One. I heard many good things about the product.  
I also did some research around coffee, extractions and other factors that influence the taste.

There is something I cannot explain and therefore need some help/guidance.

**It is about the acidity and sourness of my brews.** I ordered freshly ground coffee specifically made for filter machines (From a coffee speciality shop). The grind size is medium to fine and I use 20g of grinded coffee per 296ml. See picture [here](https://imgur.com/a/m8Yqr70). --> I am in the process of researching proper grinders ;)

So far I have tried two different kinds of coffee. Medium strength with low acidity and high strength with even lower acidity. That's what it said on the packaging.

The coffee tastes quite sour, especially the second half of the cup. (This is probably the coffee that has been exposed the least amount of time to the water.) --> I think the coffee is basically under extracted.

Now, we know there are a couple of factors that can influence the extraction. HOWEVER, if I brew the same amount of coffee (percentage wise in grams) with my Aeropress, I get the exact flavor profile and low sourness that is described on the packaging. Therefore the beans etc. shouldn't be the issue.

**1, first question:** Is there such a big difference in the grind size and taste of an Aeropress and a Moccamaster? (The brew time of both methods are between 3-4 Minutes). I feel like that the grind size I am using is already quite fine. Normally when we talk about under extraction we get advised to grind finer. Could this really be an issue? Especially knowing that the Aeropress with the same grind size produces a much smoother and sour result.

**2, second question:** Is the Moccamaster Cup Once known to produce more sour/acidy results in general? I also tried stirring and pre-wetting the filter etc. The results were very similar.

**3, third question:** What would you advise me to do, in order to get closer to the Aeropress result.

I know this is a long post and explanation. However, I think it is important to know about the details in order to provide a helpful response.

THANK YOU and a Happy New New Year to everyone.

Albumin / Krea Ratio 50.7 (max max 30 mg/g)

I never had problems with too high cholesterol. Neither with Albumin. To mention that Albumin level 6 months ago was above the limit but still the half of the today’s value (round 25 mg/l).

Was it the best cup of coffee ever - No, but it is there in my most interesting ones. 

Grind Size: 1zpresso K-Max - 70 clicks

Recipe :
Ratio - 1:15.5
Water Temp - 95C

Time | Total brew volume | Notes
1. 00:00 - 00:45 | 50 ml |  Bloom and small swerve 
2. 00:45 - 01:10 | 100 ml | Slow pours from low height, did not disturb the bed
3. 01:10 - 01:55 | 150 ml | I let the bed drain a bit more, still low and slow 
4. 01:55 - 2:15 | 200 ml
5. 02:15 - 3:00 | 250 ml | Final pour and let it drain after a swirl 

What I will change next - 

Since I think that the body was not enough I will grind it finer, maybe 65. A 

I also have T-92 light roast filter paper, it tends to increase brew time  and allow a longer bloom upto 1 min without losing thermal mass. So will try that for sure. 

If anyone has experience with brewing a gesh. Please do share your experience and inputs. Or if you have thoughts on what I can do get a better output from this. ",6,1735746186.0,IndiaCoffee,2,1.0,False

1hr5bd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackSurvivalists/comments/1hr5bd8/powering_your_home_understanding_energy/,Powering Your Home: Understanding Energy Consumption for Generator Use,"When considering using a generator to power your home, it's crucial to understand the energy consumption of your appliances. This prevents overloading the generator and potentially damaging it. A common question is how much power a microwave or refrigerator requires. Many refrigerators draw around 700-750 watts.

https://preview.redd.it/aqau9gnvjeae1.jpg?width=275&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=40044a5ed5460ffa2c4e0c20517dec48f5989955

To avoid overloading your generator, create a list of everything you plan to power. This will help you determine how much you can safely plug in. For example, if you're planning a movie night and want to power your TV and DVD player, you need to factor in their energy consumption. Even simple meals like spaghetti require energy for heating water and potentially for other appliances used in preparation. Planning your meals and activities around your power capabilities is key to maintaining morale during power outages.

Therefore, assess your electrical needs and identify the appliances you want to keep running. This will help you choose a generator or power system with sufficient capacity.

1hr57f4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Helpanuglybitch/comments/1hr57f4/relationships_and_selfdiscovery/,Relationships and self-discovery,"
Stay a little and let’s talk. Recently, after a long time of staying single (and loving it), I got into a heated argument about politics in the school cafeteria. I’m maybe too old to be fighting over America's next president when I’m far away in Europe, but it's not my fault; an attitude is coded in my DNA. The fight was with a guy. After our heated discussion, he paused and said, “You know, it’s good to see someone who has your opinion and can provide arguments and not just be blindly following other opinions.” I don’t think I should disclose which side we both were on, just to not ruin the story with an unrelated bias. After that, when I came home, I received a friend request. I accepted it. There, we continued talking, and I was surprised by how well our conversations went. We had different views and opinions but still heard and accepted each other's perspectives. We skimmed through various subjects; I even discovered his slight liking for a little gossip. We joked about it, and he revealed he found it unmasculine, but he liked chatting about it.

Time skip: after a couple of weeks of talking, he asked me if I wanted to go to the city with him just to hang out. I accepted once again. We went out, and it was surprisingly great. I was whining to my mom about how I might change my mind, but she pushed me to go. I always loved security and freedom (quite a pair), maybe more of a free mind, like feeling unchained by expectations or standards. When we walked through the city, I was laughing like a madwoman, even making a pig snorting sound once. He paid everywhere we went, opened the door for me, and even offered to hold my purse when I needed to go to the bathroom. I had a blast. The day finished off when we rode an empty bus home; the lights were turned off, and we talked more. It was dark outside, and inside felt like a little dome. I didn’t see anyone, only focused on him. It seemed like life had stopped around us, but we were blooming and living like never before. (Later, he shared he couldn’t help but stare at me through the whole ride.)

When I got home, I received a text about how much fun we had. He told me he loved my calmness and intelligence but had a hard time controlling himself from dying after seeing me laugh like I was mad. I giggled and texted him back that I had a great time. The past few weeks went great; we started talking more in the hallway, sharing our lunches when we had something tasty. Then he got sick. It was like a two-week pause; he didn’t come to school and had a fever and a pretty serious illness. Thankfully, he healed and came back. At school, he started waiting for me at the bus stop (we both took the bus), though his bus was like an hour and a half wait, but he still came. In texts, he started showing clues of interest, like a small flirty line or an innocent compliment like ""pretty lady."" We went on more hangouts, and after two months of talking, he asked me out. I said yes. Instantly, he said, “I love you.” I didn’t love him. How could I love him after two months? What did I do? I told him I loved him back. My heart stopped a bit; it felt like I was lying to him, fooling him. Still, I proceeded to our next date as a couple. We went ice skating; when I got to the bus stop, he hugged me, and all my pink lip gloss stained his jacket. We both had a great laugh about it.

I liked him, but loved him? No. The date was perfect, like always, as they call it “princess treatment” and all the other stuff. We continued dating; he reminded me he loved me every day. I said it back, but I was sometimes screaming into my pillow about how much I hated saying it. I couldn’t decipher if I felt it or not; maybe it was an outcome of my unaffectionate household. My fear of vulnerability. He was perfect, leaving love notes in my locker, always calling me pretty, telling me he couldn’t sleep because he thought about me so much. He confessed his love day after day, each time pulling at my heartstrings. Then one day, I felt it. It felt like a warm feeling in my chest; it wasn’t butterflies, but just this adoration and warmth. I concluded this was love. A few days after, I told him I was forcing myself to say ""I love you"" at the start of our relationship. He took it quite well, telling me he told me he loved me not to hear it back, but for me to hear it.

As our next date, we held hands, drank our cute drinks together; he had coffee, I had tea. We hugged and laughed. I guess this is where we end the story. I have nothing more to say; just don’t be afraid of facing what you can’t yet understand. Maybe my question or asking for advice is this: how do you know you love someone? Can my hesitance to be vulnerable or openly emotional be because of household habits?",1,1735745756.0,u_Helpanuglybitch,0,1.0,False

it affects my health. Teeth brushing is the bane of my existence because I never know when to do it. (First thing and then Ruin it with coffee? After breakfast if I bother to eat? Last thing before going out the door to work?) Then I totally forget. I kept disposable tooth brushes in my car for a while but that’s too expensive and I have had many cavities and even lost a couple teeth because of it. There’s other things I don’t do regularly or consistently I know I should like wash my face and eat something and get organized for my day. I manage a shower every other day usually but it’d be easier if I could schedule it. When I’m disorganized and in a rush I often also forget to take my meds or intentionally don’t take them because I can’t remember whether I took them or not and don’t want to double dose.

At night I’m tired from work and am being bombarded by my kids who haven’t seen me since they left for school and I get home late in the evening due to my job being a therapist for children that sees the bulk of my clients in the afterschool hours until evening (3 to 7ish, but there’s never a guarantee I won’t have daytime appointments so I can’t just plan to sit down and take care of everything after kids get on bus) My husband works from home so he gets kids off the bus and usually cooks but sometimes can’t due to work commitments. So my evenings I might have to cook, then I just want to eat with my family and crash. But I have to remember to look in school folders, make sure my kids get baths and get to bed etc. Sometimes husband can help, sometimes he’s still busy with work projects. 

So now that I’ve info dumped all that…..(and thank you if you did read it) TLDR:my life is chaotic. I do better with routines but don’t know how to stick to them, What should be on my morning and evening routines that I can stick to and help me function?",1,1735745752.0,autism,1,1.0,False

I am 34m living with my girlfriend in Dublin. Started getting into personal finance a couple of years ago and this is my 2nd year tracking my spending. My main bank is revolut and where I also receive my wage each fortnight. It makes the tracking incredibly easy as it sorts payments into categories with a high degree of accuracy (But not perfect).

Thoughts and insights welcomed, this is just for entertainment purposes and for people who have an interest in this sort of stuff! Happy New year all 

**Some notes:**

The rent, groceries and restaurant payments come from joint pockets on revolut which myself and girlfriend contribute equally too. So therefore the spending amount for those are including her contribution as well which is approx 50%. 

**Some comparisons to 2023:**

Restaurants - €7,315

Groceries - €4,359

Retail - €3,299

Utilities - €2,387

Entertainment - €1,325

Health - €1,295

Transport - €1,011

Travel - €943

**Takeaways**

Spent a lot less this year in bars and restaurants which is good….i think 

Spent less on groceries, not sure how with the prices of things but we are conscious in the shops and usually go to lidl for the better prices

Saved over 600 euro on Utilities by switching from pay as you go electric

Retail spending has increased to the tune of 500 euro but not worried as have some decent clothes that will last me a while now",0,1735745506.0,irishpersonalfinance,2,0.5,False

What started my quest was seeing the Philips 800 on sale for $400. I was ready to pull the trigger when I thought of spending a little bit more. I have a Nespresso vertuo and a Nespresso OL that I use for espresso. I have to make my own drinks, the quality of the espresso is so-so and it's also getting expensive with the pods.    

All of the machines I am looking have lattego, latte cream systems which I prefer to traditional steam wand. Another important consideration is ease of use when it comes to cleaning and I know Philips has a better cleaning system for the milk container (?).    

I've heard the DeLonghi can make better stronger coffee and it is more reliable in general terms. I'm not familiar with any of the machines so I cannot speak from experience.    



DeLonghi dinamica at Costco $1130 including taxes.    

DeLonghi dinamica used from marketplace (looks barely used but from a residential environment but i don't know the seller and I don't think I'll have a warranty ) $800 cash.   

Philips 3200 at Costco $678 taxes in.    

   

I am at Crossroads. The DeLonghi is definitely pushing up the budget I want to have and I think I will be happy with any of the machines. They used machine is tickling my buying bone but I think I'm afraid of having no warranty with such an expensive item full of different electronic and manual parts.    

What does the sub suggest?

Went to Argentina, ate at Araburu, loved every second of it.

Setting - cool, dim, marble tables & leather chairs. Pretty ""fine-dining standard"". No complaints

Service is outstanding, leans to the not-rigid side but still leaves you feeling well-cared-for and without unserved needs.

Food: tl/dr - outstanding, one of the best we've had besting most 3\* places we've been. 100% recommended

[The menu](https://preview.redd.it/ov37r5e2ceae1.jpg?width=2869&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d471b5afea0808c2dcdb566a19ba9397a11a59ef)

1. Herb/flower rice paper and tomato water. Rice paper came in an envelope. A bit of herbaceousness, but mostly flavorless but interesting. Tomato water was pure sweet cherry tomato. I don't know what it is with Argentina, but every tomato we had everywhere (even pretty crappy places) was ripe, sweet, and delicious. This was a pure distillation of that

https://preview.redd.it/ruuyptwggeae1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7da9670e574fe0ab04ba29a90b5941056bff95ac

2) Hazelnut peach, Enoki tarts. I'll be frank, I remember enjoying the hazelnut peach, but couldn't tell you a thing about it other than it had those flavors. The enoki tarts were brilliant, though - earthy and creamy. The tart shell was precise - just the right thickness and texture to compliment the mushroom without overwhelming it. Great dish.

https://preview.redd.it/04k5wtwggeae1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=acbb100a95f377741a37a23b58bffd8039f37a29

3) King crab, Ocean foam. The king crab legs were remarkable - the shell isn't real shell, but a made thing that apparently takes 3 days to create. Pure flavor of crab in these - cool to look at and a huge hit if you're a crab-fan. The Ocean foam has an airy, crisp, shrimp foam around a creamy fish (I think trout) filling. My daughter took a skeptical bite, her eyes popped open and she shoved the rest in her mouth. A delicious flavor and texture combination we all really enjoyed.

4), Brioche/trout/caviar, razor clams & oysters. Who doesn't love caviar? This first part was delicious and satisfying - perhaps a bit more brioche than I would find ideal but an easy and winning dish, again contrasting textures and complimenting flavors that worked brilliantly. The razor clams and oysters in a cream sauce with smoked or charcoal infused oil was completely incredible, though. The clams were so fresh, cut perfectly to retain the texture and bite of clam but integrating with the cream sauce beautifully. This would have been our favorite dish if not for the rockfish to come...

5) Tenderloin and kimchi taco in a nori shell.  Just look at it - the beef was rare and exquisitely fat-veined and tender. Not a hint of toughness or connective tissue. You can probably guess how this tasted. It was delicious.

https://preview.redd.it/6d3enuwggeae1.jpg?width=3640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b43baabb9372a9aee188e889b5442a087c582901

6) Scallops, trout roe, in a sort of almond cream thing, dusted with some sort of beet powder. None of us love beets, none of us loved this dish. Fine but not great. I felt like the scallop sweetness and flavor were lost in the rest of the dish.

https://preview.redd.it/htlhyzwggeae1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b87ca2a75f4b8027fe27f51c887c4f9d9aaee37

7) Rockfish. OMG this rockfish. Everyone loved it. The only fish I can remember having that I enjoyed anywhere near this much was at Oriole served in a fermented rice with a grated rice over top of it which smelled like popcorn. I wish I had a better idea of what they put in this sauce because it perfectly accentuated the perfectly cooked and seasoned fish without overwhelming or clashing with it (with apologies to le Bernardin who don't do this nearly as well). Peas? Clams? I guess they were in there but it was so much more. In a night with almost nothing but great dishes, this was the star.

8) Pork in a passionfruit and saffron sauce. I know it sounds weird. It was delicious. A really unexpected but tasty flavor combination. I wish I could express it better. This was hard to describe but very enjoyable.

https://preview.redd.it/wcli1wwggeae1.jpg?width=3635&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=934e1d142d3ac3d2c92757f5a413cbe80dd2e4ef

8) Sweetbread in a cereza sauce. Sweetbreads can be tough for some people because of the texture and because some folk just don't like the idea of offal. My wife is one of those people. She put the idea in my daughter's head as well. As a result, I got to eat 3 of these. Crispy on the outside, with the cereza sauce tasting a bit like like the best barbeque sauce I've ever had. This dish was exquisite and I loved every bite of it. My daughter later ate some sweetbreads at another tasting we had a couple weeks later and LOVED them. She hasn't forgiven her mother for scaring her out of trying it here yet.

9) Duck. It's duck, it was perfectly cooked. About what you'd expect. Every bit as delicious as the Chef's Table at the Brooklyn Fare under Cesar if you've had it. Winning dish, but not as interesting or surprising as some of the others.

https://preview.redd.it/cww8fxwggeae1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=419f1e91f14b376029251d3e900991c1a62294fd

10) Desserts - I'm not going to go into these in detail. They taste about as they look and were all delicious (particularly the faux avocado with mango filling).

Wine pairings are listed. I'm not well educated on Argentinian wines, but I am now a fan of them. These were really well selected to go with the dishes.  The saki was good, but I don't know if it really worked well with the tenderloin. I think I also found the Gewurztraminer with the scallops to be odd, likely because it didn't go with the beets.

Description:
What if your morning coffee could be more than just a drink? With the Coffee App, triggered by your coffee mug, your first sip unlocks a meaningful 15-minute experience tailored to how you’re feeling and what’s on your mind—no matter your mood or goals.

How It Works:

1. The Mug

Your mug is the gateway. Equipped with NFC or Bluetooth, it syncs with the app when you take your first sip, launching your personalized experience. The ritual of drinking coffee now becomes the spark for a productive or calm start to your day.

2. Hot Coffee Phase

While your coffee is still hot, join a Coffee Circle tailored to your mindset or interest. Share ideas, ask questions, or simply listen to others in a low-pressure environment.
	•	Examples for Different Mornings:
	•	Feeling overwhelmed by a packed day?
Join a Circle discussing small wins and strategies for tackling what’s ahead.
	•	Enjoying a lazy morning?
Connect with others sharing lighthearted ideas for exploring the day.
	•	Parent preparing for a tough day with your child?
Join a Circle with practical advice from experienced parents.

3. Cold Coffee Phase

Once your coffee cools, the app transitions to providing guided takeaways based on your Circle session. These are designed to help you make intentional progress, no matter the focus.
	•	Examples of Cold Coffee Takeaways:
	•	Preparing for an interview?
A curated checklist for topics to review (e.g., “Explain a merge sort in simple terms”) or quick exercises to sharpen your skills.
	•	Parenting challenges?
A quote or key insight from a bestselling parenting book, such as, “Connection, not control, is the key to resolving challenging behavior.”
	•	Feeling stressed?
A guided breathing exercise or a short mindfulness prompt to ground you in the moment.
	•	Creative exploration?
A personalized suggestion for a journaling prompt or a list of resources to spark inspiration.

4. Guided Day Pipeline

Throughout the day, the app continues to support you with bite-sized nudges and actionable content aligned with your morning goals.
	•	Examples of Day-Long Support:
	•	“Preparing for your interview?”
Midday reminders with a sample question and tips on answering it effectively.
	•	“Focusing on parenting?”
A short podcast episode or article exploring child development ideas shared earlier in your Circle.
	•	“Managing stress?”
A calming playlist or a lighthearted video to help reset your energy.

Why It Works for Everyone:
	•	Tailored to Your Energy Level:
Whether you’re energized, neutral, or simply overwhelmed, the app adapts to your mood and intentions.
	•	Truly Guided Support:
Every interaction is progressive and intentional, moving you closer to clarity, confidence, or calm—not just random content.
	•	Low-Pressure Engagement:
Whether you actively participate or simply observe, each phase delivers meaningful outcomes.

The goal is to make the most of your morning, no matter your state of mind. Whether it’s preparing for an interview, tackling parenting challenges, or simply finding peace in your day",1,1735744665.0,AppIdeas,0,1.0,False

By chance, for New Year’s, I attended an event and met other men who had dated someone with BPD. I had very little information about this condition, but the more I talked about what happened and about the discard, I can finally make sense of it.

About four months ago, I met my girlfriend with BPD.

I was in a low place in life. My long-term partner had moved back to Turkey. She struggled with depression and a skin condition, which led to us not being intimate for about five months. She refused to seek regular treatment for her condition (I believe due to her depression), and I felt at a loss. I tried to be supportive, understanding, and to help her find a therapist, but nothing seemed to work. I felt distraught—hopeless, even.

That’s when I met my girlfriend with BPD. She worked at a hotel I had stayed at years ago. I bumped into her at a 7-Eleven and was surprised. We decided to catch up over drinks that evening. I was in a relationship but needed someone to talk to—someone with energy—because supporting my partner for six months had been overwhelming.

That night, she invited me to her apartment to help her with something. About 15 minutes later, something unexpected happened: we ended up in bed. The sex was incredible—some of the best I’d ever experienced. I knew it was wrong, and I felt guilty, but there was something missing in my life, and this new person seemed to offer it.

Almost immediately, the relationship intensified. She started calling me frequently during the day while I was working, wanted to meet 2–3 times a week, and became angry when I didn’t respond to her calls right away.

During the first week, she was lovely—interested in all the things I loved: movies, food, books, and series. She emphasized how similar we were, and I was amazed because my partner didn’t share many of my interests. The sex was unbelievable, and I felt a connection I hadn’t thought possible.

After 2–3 weeks, the cracks began to show.

**Red Flag 1**  
She constantly compared me to her ex. She shared detailed stories about how her ex treated her, all the things he bought her, and how he financially supported her. While I was happy to pay for dinners and help when needed, the level of support she described was unrealistic for me.

**Red Flag 2**  
Most of her stories about friends involved men. She’d mention her “friends”—John, Peter, Tom—while never talking about female friends. The one female friend she did mention seemed to live a dangerous lifestyle, being financially supported by her estranged husband while living with her boyfriend.

**Red Flag 3**  
Early in the relationship, she shared a series of personal hardships: a motorcycle accident, a hospital visit, and financial troubles. Later, I discovered she had borrowed significant sums from male friends and was between $6,000–$8,000 in debt, despite earning only about $400 a month.

# Red Flag 4

At around week 4, I started to notice a major shift in her behavior. Her mood would switch from very happy to extremely angry in an instant. We would make plans for one thing, and she would suddenly freak out and insist on doing something else. Once, she called me in the middle of the workday, and I spoke to her for about 10 minutes. When I told her I needed to get back to work, she became furious, called me selfish, and unleashed a level of verbal abuse I was not used to.

We had made plans that day to go running. I told her to meet me at the track at 6 p.m., as I could take two hours off work. However, when I got to the track, she wasn’t there. Confused, I called her, and she told me she was still at her house and wanted me to pick her up because she couldn’t find the location. Her house was 20 minutes in the opposite direction. When I refused, she exploded with anger, calling me selfish for not driving out of my way to get her.

By this point, I had had enough of her verbal abuse and pushed back. Five minutes later, I received a text: *“We are done. F*\*\* you. I am DONE WITH YOU. F\*\*\* you.”\*

By then, I was noticing significant ups and downs weekly. I wasn’t feeling good—it was affecting my work and personal life. I felt a constant need to keep her happy, but no matter what I did, it was never enough.

Around week 5, she told me she had feelings for me, loved me, and wanted a future together. It was surreal because she would flip from “I’m done with you” to “I love you, bae” within 24 hours. I admit—I saw the signs. I knew something was off, but I felt a strange sense of responsibility toward her, like I needed to help and take care of her.

I guess it was trauma bonding.

I was losing myself. Eventually, I found myself saying “I love you” back to her. To complicate matters, my relationship with my other partner wasn’t improving, and she told me she didn’t think she’d ever leave Turkey. I decided to formally split up with my other girlfriend because maintaining the story was becoming too much for me. I committed to this girl, thinking we could make it work.

# Red Flag 5

The day I planned to break up with my partner, she was away at a work event, so we couldn’t talk. I decided to do it the next day. That evening, I went out with the girl with BPD to an event. I went in but she did not follow. I looked for her and i could not see what happened.  I found her outside crying and really crying.  She was really unstable. She wouldn’t go back inside, claiming her ex was there and that we couldn’t stay. Her panic seemed abnormal, especially since they had broken up a year prior. Something felt very off.

That day, I realized there was something deeply wrong, and I needed to get out of the relationship.

# Red Flag 6

About two days later, she told me her boss was late paying her salary and that she was desperate. She didn’t explicitly ask to borrow money but kept sending messages about having nothing to do, no money, and how much she was suffering. After a day of this, I loaned her $500, thinking it would help her until her salary came in.

# Red Flag 7

The next day, we were supposed to go hiking. Instead, she decided to meet a friend I felt was dangerous. She went to lunch with this friend but kept sending me photos, which was unusual for her. She told me she’d be at my place in two hours. Six hours later, I received a call from her, claiming she had spilled coffee on her phone, ruining it, and had to buy a new one. She casually mentioned she couldn’t see me because she was heading to a party with her friends.

I was furious. When I saw her the next day, she had a new iPhone. All her claims about not having money, missing her salary, and struggling financially didn’t add up.  On top of it the phone she claimed was damaged from the tea and could not be fixed was also magically sold.

# Red Flag 8

She started talking about a male friend of hers. When we first met two years ago, she told me they had slept together and that he was her first love. Now, her story had changed. She claimed he was just a friend she spoke to daily and that he sometimes sent her money when she asked. She insisted it was platonic because he had a girlfriend. Of course, I knew something was wrong.

By this point, her criticisms and verbal abuse were increasing. What had once been mostly positive interactions with occasional criticisms turned into daily yelling and verbal abuse, followed by incredible sex. My mind was getting completely messed up. I couldn’t leave, and when I tried to pull away, she would go crazy—even over small things, like me being 15 minutes late returning a call.

I decided I needed a way out. I booked a flight to Indonesia, hoping that leaving the country would create some space and get my mind back.  I knew in my heart that something was very wrong. Her instability and verbal abuse were killing me.

# Leaving for Indonesia

I booked my ticket and left. While in Indonesia, my partner there told me she was feeling better and wanted to join me. After all the abuse and chaos, I needed to be around someone who genuinely cared for me, so I agreed.

In hindsight, I should have just cut things off with the girl with BPD. Was it trauma bonding? Was I attached to the abuse? Or was I holding on to those few moments when she was kind?

Even after leaving, I didn’t block her. She continued calling me daily, freaking out, abuse and i miss you and love you. Eventually, she found out I was with my other partner.  She lost it and guilt tripped me and well somehow....i found myself going back to her.  She convinced me if i came back we could make it work.

# Back to the Girl with BPD

Oddly enough, she was okay with me going to go see my partner —or so she claimed. She got angry at first but quickly let it go. She told me she still wanted to see me at Christmas and that we could make it work. The love bombing started again.

I fell for it. Her sweet words and fake promises of love overshadowed my better judgment. I broke up with my partner in Indonesia and committed to the girl with BPD.

When I returned to Thailand, though, she was different—distant. I thought she might still be angry about what happened in Indonesia, but she insisted she was over it. I told myself she just needed time to warm up.

# The Final Red Flag: When I Should Have Run

When i came back she had another emergency and asked to borrow 300 dollars.  I refused this time knowing what would happen.  She got angry of course but.

I went to her house, and she seemed happy and back to her usual self. We kissed goodbye as she got on the bus.

Six days later, she called me in a rage. She was furious because I had found her a job that paid double her current salary, which would allow her to repay the money she owed me and others. Her anger was monstrous, worse than anything I had heard before.  Constant anger and calling me cheap and saying her salary is not the issue it is me being cheap and i need to support her.

The next day, she called me with a sweet voice and asked to meet for lunch. I said no, knowing what would happen. She called again an hour later, asking for coffee. I refused. On her third call, I foolishly agreed, thinking I could retrieve a book I had loaned her and make it a quick meeting.

When I arrived, something was off. Her eyes betrayed anger and hate. There was no talk about her trip or visiting her family—just rage and relentless criticism. After 30 minutes, I’d had enough and got up to leave. She immediately flipped the switch, started crying, and said she was lonely and had no one for Christmas.

I was really stupid. I fell for it.  I sat back down and said my friends are having an event and she can come join me and my friends. 

She came over to my house and things were cool for about 15 minutes.   She flipped the switch again and rage and anger and non stop verbal abuse.  I was shocked and in my own house.  In the middle of this a guy called her and her tone immediately changed.   "" oh i am so happy you are in the city.  Of course i can meet you this week.  yes yes you are so funny.  We can meet for christmas too. Lets meet tonight i am going to this party with my friend william and we can all go together""  I lost it.  I am normally a fairly calm person but it was too much and lost my balance.  Right in front of me in my own house.

I was like you bitch.  In my own damn house you trash talk me and then invite some new guy to a party i invited you too and you think we can all go together.  Get the fuck out.  I admit i lost it.  I had never been so fucking angry. 

There was no longer any love in this persons eyes.  No feeling of anything.  She was not the person i knew.  She was just this horrible monster.  Not human.  She showed up at the party with her new guy and in front me and acted like nothing had ever happened.  Also oddly enough at the same event her ex was there and she had no issues this time.  When i was there before she cried and lost it when she saw him

 I felt really lost for almost 7 days.  Trying to understand it all.  I really could not piece together anything.   I tried to call her 3 days later to apologize about being angry and trying to find out what happened.  I had never seen her so angry and none of it made any sense to me.  One day we were cool and we were gonna spend christmas together and i had finally committed to her and were gonna make it work and then 4 days later she dropped me in the most brutal uncaring way.

Of course she refused to speak and got  more angry and her response was only "" i am done with you. I hate you.  You are not my type."" 

I asked her why she did not do all of this when I was in indonesia.  She refused to answer.  
I asked her when i was breaking up with my partner she did not say anything.  Nothing just cold answer of i am done with you.  You are not my type.

 It was only when i had found out about BPD and met other men who had the same experience as me that i can now see what happened sadly....was all part of the schedule.  Realistically about 2 months ago things were already were on thier way down and this was gonna happen eventually.  At least now i can see it.  But i am still feeling messed up from it.",1,1735744064.0,BPD_Survivors,3,1.0,False

The last thing I remember was resigning from my job in December 2023, effective immediately. And just like that, it’s January 1, 2025. Time really does fly when your life feels like it’s falling apart.

2024 was, by far, the worst year of my life—and I’m largely at fault. As much as I would like to blame someone for all the mishaps, I know the responsibility lies with me. As the saying goes: what you are not changing, you are choosing.

I’ve ghosted and avoided people, but I’ve come to understand who my true friends are. I don’t have many—in fact, I can count them on one hand—but I deeply appreciate their unwavering support. Even though I went silent for most of 2024, they never left my side. They didn’t need to check in constantly; they just understood. I truly, truly appreciate their patience and understanding. While I’m not the type to wear my heart on my sleeve, I know I need to reach out to them and let them know how much they mean to me. It would be a tragedy if I never told them how grateful I am for their presence in my life.

I’ve also been surprised by people I’d met briefly in the past—whether through work or fleeting interactions. Even though I had let those relationships go, thinking they were too short-lived to matter, some of them still remembered me and checked in last year. Others I deliberately avoided because, honestly, what could I say? My days had blended into a monotonous blur. But I hope it’s not too late to let them know how much I appreciate their kindness. Someone once told me it’s rare nowadays for people to ask how you’re doing without ulterior motives, and I’m grateful to have experienced that kind of genuine care.

Despite 2024 being a blur, stuck in stagnancy, there were still some good things that happened. I’ve met a few more people who I never thought would mean the world to me. Honestly, I wanted to avoid and ghost them just like what I did with the others whom I thought were too short-lived to matter. And I hope I can keep them for as long as I can, and add them to the precious people I’m already keeping.

I have also discovered more about myself—to a certain extent. I still see myself as this pessimistic, skeptical, almost negatively nihilistic, emotional wreck. I still think my being an empath is more of a curse than a blessing. However, I do love that I am more introspective than ever, and that I am more understanding of a lot of things. I’m not quick to judge as I have been—unless my mind is clouded with emotions. I still got to work on a part of me that is strongly emotional, but I love how understanding I am now.

Another thing I’ve realized is how much I’ve taken small joys for granted. Simple things like listening to music, reading a book, or even sitting in silence with a cup of coffee used to bring me comfort, but somewhere along the way, I lost that connection. I want to rediscover those small pockets of peace—the little things that make life feel bearable, if not beautiful.

I don’t know what 2025 holds for me. I don’t know if I have the strength to pull myself out of this rut, but I’m giving life one last chance. I hope I can finally find the peace and freedom I’ve longed for. I hope to see that beautiful spark in my eyes again when I look in the mirror. And most of all, I hope I can fall in love with myself again—and more deeply than ever before.",1,1735743930.0,DiaryOfARedditor,0,1.0,False
1hr4mgf,https://i.redd.it/6xpirv9tdeae1.jpeg,My step count journey 2020-2024,"Happy New Year fellow walkers! Sharing my journey to wellness over the past half-decade:

Pre-2020: I was sedentary for the bulk of my life, although I was pretty consistent getting to the gym 1-3 times a week from 2011-2018, primarily focusing on strength training and ~15 minutes on an elliptical.

2019 - 2020: I achieved peak laziness and stopped going to the gym. My weight ballooned to borderline obese and I generally felt unwell physically and mentally. I started a walking routine during COVID, but still made excuses (too sore, too tired, too cold, etc.). 

2021: Set 10,000 steps per day as my goal, but still used the winter months as an excuse to revert to my lazy tendencies and fell well short, but felt significantly better.

2022-2024: Achieved my first 10K+ yearly average and continued to improve consistency and distance. Added body weight resistance exercises 1-3x a week, plus cycling and body surfing in Spring-Fall. I average about 3 hours of exercise a day; a bit more in the summer and a bit less in the winter. I've made dramatic improvements to my body composition, mental wellness & happiness, self-confidence, cholesterol levels, blood-sugar levels, resting heart rate, etc. It sounds cliche, but walking truly is a miracle drug.

What I learned along the way and some notes:

• Movement makes me happy! I work a sedentary job, but I have learned to prioritize my physical and mental health. On work days I usually break up my steps in 1-3 sessions and I bribe myself with a coffee after my morning walk. With no time constraints on weekends/holidays, I love going for a 7-8 mile walk. 

• I've hit 20k step monthly average 2 times, but that made it feel like too much of a chore. I may try for a 20k yearly average one day, but definitely not until I'm retired.

• Find sneakers you love and replace them often. 

• Buy a cheap massage gun and use it on your plantar fascia a couple of times a week.

• Good wireless earbuds are essential for me to listen to music, audiobooks, podcasts, or just noise cancellation to support meditation.

• 10K remains my formal daily target, but my goal is to continue to add steps every year. Even if I beat the prior year by just one step, I'll take it.

• The vast majority of my steps come from walks outside, and overcoming bitter cold & wind in the winter was one of the toughest mental hurdles. Now I find joy in overcoming that obstacle.

• I will occasionally run or jog, but I realize I hate it lol. Brisk walking is just right for me. 

• Tracking app is Samsung Health.

Alright, I'm off to get my first meaningful steps of 2025! Good luck to you all on your own journeys to wellness! ",12,1735743913.0,walking,4,0.94,False

**Intermission Show: ""Reflections in the Flow""**  

The screen fades in with soft guitar strings, the kind you'd hear from a street musician in Mexico City. The setting is a quiet park bench just outside the diner Mouse Capone had waited in. A street vendor wheels a cart past, calling out softly for tamales.  

**Narrator’s Voice (calm and reflective):**  
""Patience, they say, is the quiet strength of those who know time does not always bow to their will. But patience, too, can be bittersweet—like a cup of lukewarm coffee, savored while waiting for what never comes.""  

The camera pans to Mouse Capone, now sitting on the bench. He’s flipping through his notepad. The pages are filled with sketches, cryptic notes, and an occasional crossword puzzle half-completed. He looks up, watching the flow of people—an old couple feeding pigeons, children chasing each other, and a busker setting up to play.  

**Narrator:**  
""For some, the intermission is the pause between action. For Mouse Capone, it is the action. Observing, calculating, understanding the world around him—not with haste, but with care.""  

The busker begins to play a soft tune on a violin. Mouse nods approvingly and leaves a coin in the open case.  

The screen shifts to stylized animations of Mouse’s prior adventures—a flash of the Nor’easter slicing through a storm, the Douglas DC-3 soaring against a sunset, and fleeting glimpses of familiar allies and foes.  

**Narrator (with a subtle smile in the voice):**  
""Even the best-laid plans sometimes take a detour. But in the quiet moments, when the chase slows and the clock ticks softly, Mouse finds something rare: clarity.""  

The music crescendos as Mouse stands, adjusts his coat, and walks toward the bustling streets, disappearing into the crowd. The screen fades to black with the text:  

**""Expeditions and Misadventures will return shortly. Thank you for waiting with us.""**  ",1,1735743906.0,hdfidelity,0,1.0,False

December picture was taken on New Years Eve

My current exercise are incline walking and lifting.

I'm still trying to figure out how to stay at 135. Eating more, adding more fat to my diet.

I'm very proud of my progress, going into 2025 I'll be focusing on building muscle. I've been told I could take creatine to help with muscle growth, at this time I have no desire in taking it simply due to me wanting to see where I can take my body without the help of a supplement. I also have zero desire to build big muscles. I prefer endurance and would love to work my way into calisthenics.

My current meals are as follows 

Breakfast: Premier Protein + collagen + Coffee/ Cinnamon tea. I'll also have scrambled eggs and bacon from time to time. I'm not a fan of bacon but I find it delicious when it's crispy (3-4 pieces).

Lunch: Premier Protein + Coffee/ Cinnamon tea 

Dinner: Meat and steamed veggies

I try having a cheat meal once a week. Even though they're keto friendly, I consider it a cheat day simply due to it being a meal not made at home.

My cheat meals are

x2 Double quarter pounders from McDonald's. No buns or ketchup. I pair it with an avacado, mixed veggies, or American blend salad.

Little Caesars stuffed crust pizza, double pepperoni, double old world pepperoni, extra cheese, mozzarella, and a bag of American blend salad. I pour the entire bag on top of the pizza and eat everything but the crust.

At this point, I haven't been counting calories, I just make sure to hit my protein numbers.

I stalled at 140 for around 4 or more months.

Even though I stalled for so long, the progress being made was my body physically changing. 

How my size has changed,

XL shirt to Small. My button shirts are small slim. I think I'd be fine buying small slim shirts but I'm just not willing to buy since I've spent too much money on new clothing twice.

40 inch waist down to <30 inch waist. I wear Levi 511's 30x30. I need a belt to keep my jeans in place. I currently wear XSmall in jogger pants.

I'd also like to add that during my stall of 140, I'd fasten my belt at the 8th hole, it slowly became the 9th hole in, and now currently the 10th hole in.

I've learned that the best way to track progress is clothing.

I know I'm forgetting things, here are some pros and cons I've noticed

Pros

- Endurance is sky-high 

- Summers are easy. I live in the Midwest, having hit 100+ with humidity, days were bearable. I could tell it was hot and humidity but it just doesn't affect me anymore.

- Tying my shoes. I remember being uncomfortable tying my shoes since my stomach would get in the way.

- Veins in my hands and forearms pop, they're pretty prominent in the summer. (My personal favorite pro)

Cons

- I now get cold in the 70s. I began double layering when mornings sit st 60s or lower, irc.

Even though my goal has been met, I'm more excited about where I go in 2025.

Going forward, I'll just be another lurker here. I've enjoyed posting about my progress once a month, I use them as a reminder where I was and what I was doing at time. I've enjoyed going back to my previous posts and reading thru them and the comments.

If you're thinking about starting keto or on your own journey, stick to it. Keto is easily the best decision I've ever made in life. Stalls are normal, don't worry about it and just focus on how your clothing is fitting. 

Thank you for reading :)

I have a small group of friends from college (we’re all in mid 20s), and even though we never shared our deepest secrets and we’re not super close (we live our own lives mostly), we spend some time together outside of classroom and meet up for coffee, we traveled together, talk about college, talk shi* and overall have fun. There is one of the girls that we spend the most time together and do some fun activities (going for drinks/ going to theatre together), but we rarely shared details of our personal lives. Would it be okay if I tell her about a breakup? She is kinda crazy and would probably hype me up to make me feel better, but I don’t want to dump all my trauma on her because I have no one else to talk to.",1,1735743273.0,relationshipadvice,1,1.0,False

This happened about about two-ish years ago, and while my friends say I'm completely in the right, I still catch myself doubting that I actually am. This is going to be a VERY long post, sorry about that.

So, a bit about myself, I'm 20 (they/them), and I'm MASSIVELY into kpop. I love collecting albums, photo cards, anything I can. I've been collecting said albums and such since 2018 and have made quite a big collection over the years. Last year, I was keeping all of it in our family home in a bookshelf, but due to space issues, plus me wanting to be close to the collection, I decided to transfer all of it to our apartment in a different city (we bought it so me and my mother would be closer to work and school respectively) where I had my own room, plus I got a new bookshelf there specifically for them. 

It took a while to transfer everything because, once again I had a lot even then, plus my dad's car is almost always filled with different things, meaning there wasn't much space for everything. Once most of them were transferred, it only left one big box, a season's greetings. For those unfamiliar with them, they are bigger boxes every group puts out at the beginning of the year filled with calendars, postcards, notebooks, stickers and other small things. They are usually very expensive, at least twice as expensive as albums typically are (if not more), and are on the bigger side, so they aren't easy for me to transfer. Because of that, I couldn't really move it until my dad made some space in his car, which he was working on doing. 

It happened one week. I had gone to the apartment so I could easily go to school, while my mother stayed at home during the week because she was sick. I decided to put the season's greetings on our piano (I learned for 8 years but decided to stop because it didn't bring me joy anymore, so now, unless I open it from time to time to play random tunes from shows/movies or try to play a song by ear, it sits closed, collecting dust. It has also ALWAYS been used as a place to put things. Extra clothes, bags that couldn't be put anywhere else, anything really, would end up being put on top of the piano, so I foolishly thought ""what's the harm of putting it there?"") and left it there for about two weeks while my dad cleaned his car. 

That Friday when he was driving me back home, he told me he'd cleaned it enough to fit the box, so when we got home, I went to take it to the car. I found out, that during the week I was gone, my mother had opened the box, pulled everything out, tore the box apart and threw it out. It pissed me off truly. The thing about these season's greetings is they're limited. They get put out and once they're sold, no more, and this one was from 2021, so there was no way I could find a new one, at least not one that wouldn't cost an arm and a leg. I decided to send my mother a very angry text, basically asking why the hell she threw it out etc. to which she responded with something like ""it was taking up space"". Mind you that piano had always been used as a storage place. I blew up on her (over text) about how she's never respected my personal space, how she doesn't even think about sentimental value of things, about how expensive something is and how she obviously doesn't care about my feelings. If she had, she could've texted me to ask me to move it, or wait until Friday when I came home to tell me to put it away, but she didn't. She went behind my back and threw out something I spent my own money on without even thinking. I ended up telling her that until she learns not to touch and destroy other people's property without permission, I will not be speaking with her unless it's a life or death situation. 

This silent treatment lasted for about 5 months until I bought a lightstick. Once again, for those unfamiliar with those, they are what they're called, a light on a stick that fans bring to concerts, usually designed with the group's logo or in funky shapes that relate to the group. I didn't have time to bring it to the apartment so I left it on a chair by my bed and went about my week. Same thing happened. I was in the apartment the whole week while she stayed home, and when I came back I saw that the lid of the box that it was in, was torn. Not fully, but enough for it to be noticeable. The lid was quite tricky to open and you have to be careful when doing so, which she obviously didn't know and just forced it to open.

I once again blew up on her, this time In person. It was around the time I had gotten the opportunity to move out with my friend, so I told her that ""since she obviously can't keep her fucking hands to herself and mind her fucking business"" I no longer feel as though my belongings are safe around her, and I'd be permanently moving away. The blatant disregard for personal property obviously means absolutely nothing to her, and she'd rather be nosy than respect other people's belongings, especially knowing she was on very thin ice already. That weekend, I packed all of my things and got the hell out of the house, packed all of the albums from the apartment and moved everything to me new place. I have blocked her number, blocked her on all social media, and completely cut contact with her. I still regularly talk to my dad, we go out for coffee, dinner, or just hang out. He knows the exact address of mz apartment, but I've asked him to not tell anyone else where it is. As much as I love mz grandmother I know she'd immediately tell my mother.

I now live with my best friend, we have our separate rooms, and due to my mother's actions, it actually took me quite a while to develop enough trust to even leave my room unlocked when my friend is in the apartment while I'm not, because I was afraid the same would happen with them. Now, with therapy, it's gotten better and I regularly let my friend go into my room and borrow whatever they want, touch my stuff and whatever, knowing they're not that type of person. I know I was in the right to do what I did, and anyone I ever tell about the story says I was in the right, but from time to time, I catch myself thinking and ask myself if I overreacted.

Despite his desire for his father's approval and love, Emilius struggled to connect with him. Emilius's inability to provide emotional support or a stable father-son relationship left a profound impact on him.

| *Negative* | Risk-taker, Stubborn, Cynical, Temperamental, Distrustful |


***Overview:***  Dorian is a tapestry of intellect, wit, and emotional complexity that unfolds in the unique blend of academia, curiosity, and a touch of dramatic flair. At the core of his personality lies an intelligence that shapes his every thought and action. His mind is a labyrinth of historical knowledge, a repository of facts and fables carefully curated over years of voracious reading. This intellect, however, comes with a dose of sarcasm and a keen wit, painting his conversations with a delightful shade of banter. Dorian is resourceful, a problem solver whose solutions often emerge from the intersections of history and strategy. His diligence is both a strength and a burden, a relentless pursuit of excellence influenced by the shadows of familial expectations.

Yet, amidst the layers of intellect and emotional intricacies, Dorian's heart harbors a fear of being forgotten and a desire to leave a lasting imprint on the pages of history.

#Demigod Info 

***Stats***

| Stat | Level | Description |
|:-|:-|:-|
| Agility |8/10 | Dorian is exceptionally nimble, quick, and dexterous. He's very good at tasks that require precision and balance, such as acrobatics, dodging, reacting, or executing quick movements. |
| Awareness |6/10 | He's able to notice details that others might miss, which makes him good at reading environments, noticing subtle changes, and staying alert, though it's not on par with the most observant individuals. Still, his awareness keeps him from being caught off guard in most situations.|
| Charisma | 5/10|Dorian's interpersonal skills are average at best. He can handle social situations well but He isn't  particularly captivating or inspiring. |
| Durability |4/10 | Dorian is not particularly resistant to damage or physical hardship. His body isn’t built to take significant punishment, so he tends to avoid situations where he might sustain heavy injuries.|
| Endurance |7/10 |Dorian has impressive stamina and resilience, both physically and mentally. He can maintain strenuous activity over long periods without tiring easily. |
| Intelligence | 7/10|He's smart, resourceful, and capable of solving complex problems. Dorian's intelligence tends to manifest in strategic thinking, quick learning, or a knack for crafting clever plans. While not a genius, he is certainly a sharp thinker and relies on his intellect to get himself through the day|
| Luck |5/10 |Dorian's luck is nothing of note. He faces both good and bad breaks in roughly equal measure. |
| Power |7/10 | While not the most powerful demigod around, Dorian has great control over his powers|
| Speed |6/10 | This character is fast, able to move at a pace quicker than most people, though not in the realm of superhuman speed. They might excel at short bursts of motion or sustained movement, making them difficult to chase or evade.|
| Strength | 4/10 |Physical strength is definitely Dorian's weakest area. Though he is  not completely weak, he does lack the ability to lift heavy objects or overpower opponents through sheer strength.|

**Weapon of Choice:** Diogenes (Celestial Bronze Halberd) 



**Fighting Style:** Dorian's fighting style focuses on speed, precision, and adaptability. He uses the halberd's versatility to maintain control over the battlefield, relying on his agility to stay mobile and his intelligence to outwit opponents. It emphasizes evasion and well-timed strikes over brute force. Dorian constantly moves, using footwork to stay just out of reach of his opponents while maintaining an optimal distance for his halberd’s reach. He also uses the halberd’s length to control space, keeping opponents at bay while staying light on his feet to avoid direct attacks. Instead of relying on brute force, Dorian aims for weak points such as joints, gaps in armor, or unprotected areas if he can. He will also use the halberd’s versatility (blade, spike, and hook) to attack in creative and unexpected ways, such as hooking an opponent’s weapon or tripping them with the shaft given the opportunity. Since he cannot take many hits, he adopts a defensive stance when needed, using the halberd’s length to deflect attacks or create distance, and he's good at tiring out opponents, relying on his stamina to outlast stronger but less enduring opponents. Dorian also employs Hit-and-Run tactics, where he uses the halberd's weight to deliver quick, impactful strikes rather than sustained heavy blows, and after attacking, he retreats swiftly to avoid retaliation, staying agile and elusive. He tends to use feints, unexpected spins, or the halberd's hook to catch opponents off-guard, and by studying his opponent’s patterns, he adapts his strategy mid-battle if he can. Depending on where he is, Dorian tries to use the terrain to his advantage, maneuvering opponents into tight spaces, uneven ground, or positions where the halberd’s reach gives him a distinct edge. This fighting style, however,  also comes with its weaknesses. It relies on maintaining distance, so Dorian struggles if an opponent closes the gap. His low strength makes it difficult to win against enemies who rely on brute force or grappling. He is vulnerable to heavy, continuous assaults due to his lower durability, not to mention very crippled if his powers don't or can't work. 



**Fatal Flaw:** *Curiosity*. Dorian's fatal flaw, the Achilles' heel that could potentially lead to his downfall, lies in his insatiable curiosity. This trait, while a driving force behind his intellectual pursuits and thirst for knowledge, becomes a double-edged sword when it manifests as a compulsion to delve into the unknown, often without regard for the potential dangers that may lie ahead. Dorian's curiosity is not merely a desire for information; it's a relentless urge to explore, question, and unravel mysteries, even if it means taking risks or venturing into uncharted territory.

#Backstory 


Dorian Ernest Seymour's childhood in Winchester, England, was shaped by the dual influences of academia and familial longing. His father, Dr. Emilius Seymour, was a distinguished archaeologist dedicated to unraveling the mysteries of the past. But hat same dedication to his work is what kept him away from home for extended periods, and consequently, meant that he was almost never around in Dorian's life, Amidst that emotional turbulence, Dorian found solace in the presence of his uncle, Edwin Seymour, and his aunt, Victoria Seymour. Edwin, a West End actor, not only offered protection and care but also introduced Dorian to the world of theater, becoming a positive influence in his life. Victoria, a theater teacher, served as the primary caregiver, filling the maternal role that was also absent from his life.

From an early age, Dorian exhibited a remarkable intellect and insatiable curiosity. Books became his closest companions, and he developed a voracious appetite for knowledge, particularly in the realm of history and the arts. So, despite his absence, Dorian's passion for understanding the past flourished and he was largely inspired by his father's own commitment to history. However, even with his uncle and aunt taking care of him, even with all his efforts to keep himself busy, it didn't stop the strained relationship with his father from becoming a defining aspect of Dorian's upbringing. Emilius’'s frequent absences left Dorian feeling neglected and yearning for paternal attention. The emotional distance between them fueled Dorian's desire to excel and prove himself in the hope that his father would finally acknowledge him, and it fueled his ambition to prove himself in any way possible.

In spite of the familial problems of his upbringing, Dorian led a very busy, but overall normal life. Well, as “normal” as it could be for a teenager with ADHD that may or may not see what other people can't see and a strange obsession with history, but you get the point. As with every demigod, however, Dorian eventually found out the truth about him being a demigod, courtesy of the dracanae that attacked him during a school trip to the British Museum. A school trip that would have costed him his life if it wasn't for the intervention of Dorian's substitute Greek Mythology teacher, Oleander Vale. In the span of less than 24 hours, Dorian found out that Greek myths were not mere stories, but living realities, that his substitute teacher was a satyr, and that his father lied to him all his life and that he himself was a demigod. Which in turn, meant that Dorian would be targeted by monsters because of his divine heritage. Worse, he couldn't even confront his father personally about the issue because Emilius was away, only being informed about Dorian's need to go to Camp Half-Blood for his safety by Oleander through Iris Message. 

This is how Dorian suddenly found himself saying goodbye to his home and crossing the Atlantic to USA, and leaving everything he's ever known behind for a world he didn't even know existed until recently. 

Life does have a way of being unpredictable, after all. He knew that better than anyone. 

And then…A year. A year had gone by since Dorian first stepped into Camp Half-Blood, after being chased by monsters from the moment he, Alba and Oleander left the airport until they finally crossed the the borders of the haven for demigods. It was also then that he had realized that his father never actually told him who his goddess mother was. You could argue that he could have IMed his father to ask him about it, since he would definitely know, but Dorian deliberately chose not to. After the way he had to find out about the truth about himself, the last thing Dorian wanted was to talk to his father. He couldn't be bothered to tell him the truth before, and he wouldn't be now. 

That's how Dorian found himself staying in the Hermes Cabin for the past year, and it wasn't bad, by any means. He actually quite enjoyed the atmosphere of the cabin and the hospitality of its residents, and just had a way of making people feel welcome. Still, Dorian would be lying if he said he wasn't anxious and dying of curiosity to know who his mother was. That is if she even cared enough to make herself known to him, which, so far, hadn't really been the case. 

But all of that was a while ago. A lot has changed since then. 

All of his wait to be acknowledged by his mother had been answered earlier last year, when he had been claimed as the son of the Muse of History. 

He had become the Game Master, and has been doing his best to honor his position by giving campers the meansto improve their abilities.

He had found a purpose in helping Iphis, the Lord of Zephyros Creek, to keep the memory of his long-gone lover alive to the best of his abilities. 

He had gone to the City of New Argos as a champion representing Camp on the New Argos Games, having a chance to explore the city of demigods and… not doing so well in the first round of the games. 

He had stood and fought to defend New Argos when the city had been invade by an enemy that was still unknown to both the city and camp. 

He had finally met his mother during the visit to Mount Olympus…

One thing was for sure. 2039 was one hell of a memorable year for Dorian Seymour. 

And now, he had to be ready to face the next one…

#Present Day 


The soft hum of early dawn filled the Muse Cabin. Outside, the first light of January 1st filtered through the curtains, casting long shadows across the room. The faint sound of celebration lingered from the night before—echoes of laughter, fireworks, and distant music marking the start of a new year. For most campers, it was a day of rest after the festivities, a time to sleep in, recharge, and greet the year at a leisurely pace.  

But for Dorian, today wasn’t just the start of a new year. It was his 17th birthday.  

As always, the day began with a gentle yet insistent reminder of his most constant companion: Marie.  

The familiar weight of her paws pressed against his chest as she padded across him, her soft, grey-and-white fur catching the first light. Dorian let out a groggy groan, burying his face deeper into his pillow. He had stayed up late the night before, attending the New Year's Eve Party and watching the fireworks over Camp Half-Blood with everyone else and sharing his hopes for the year ahead.  

But Marie had no sympathy for late nights. She meowed softly, the sound a mix of patience and insistence. When he didn’t respond, she leaned down, pressing her nose against his cheek, her whiskers tickling his skin.  

“Marie,” he mumbled, voice muffled by the pillow. “It’s my birthday. Can’t I sleep in? Just this once?”  

She responded with another meow, louder this time, and added a gentle paw tap to his face for emphasis.  

Dorian sighed, cracking one eye open to meet her unyielding green gaze. “Fine, fine. You win.”  

Marie hopped down from the bed with a triumphant little chirp, tail flicking as she padded toward the corner where her food bowl sat empty. Dorian pushed himself up slowly, running a hand through his dark, sleep-tousled hair. The cabin was quiet, the soft snores of his cousins rising and falling in the background. He moved carefully, trying not to disturb anyone as he pulled on a warm hoodie and shuffled toward Marie’s corner.  

As he poured her food, the familiar sound of kibble hitting the bowl, Dorian let his mind wander.  

*Seventeen.*  

It felt strange, the thought settling over him like a weight. Another year older, another year of life at Camp Half-Blood. He couldn’t help but reflect on how much had changed in the past twelve months.  

This time last year, he had been just another unclaimed camper in the Hermes Cabin. Back then, his days had been defined by uncertainty—long hours of wondering who his godly parent was, whether he even belonged here, and what his future might hold. He had spent so much time feeling out of place, overshadowed by the bold personalities of the Hermes kids, and constantly second-guessing himself.  

But then, one morning in the middle of winter, everything had shifted. The moment he was claimed by Clio, the Muse of History, had been surreal, like stepping into a story he hadn’t realized he was a part of. He remembered the burst of golden light, and the way his cabinmates had welcomed him like he had always belonged.  

And now, here he was, a full year later, waking up in the Muse Cabin—his cabin.  

He smiled down at Marie, watching as she eagerly ate her breakfast. “You don’t care about all this deep reflection, do you?” he asked softly. “As long as you’re fed, life’s good.”  

Marie flicked her tail in response, clearly unimpressed by his philosophizing.  

After tending to her, Dorian moved on to his own morning routine. He washed his face, the cool water shocking him fully awake, and brushed his teeth, pausing to glance at himself in the mirror. His reflection stared back—a young man with light, thoughtful blue eyes and a quiet strength in his posture that hadn’t been there a year ago. He wasn’t sure when it had appeared, but he recognized it now, the subtle confidence that came from finally understanding who he was.  

He pulled on a pair of comfortable jeans and his Camp Half-Blood shirt, the orange fabric soft and familiar against his skin. As he laced up his sneakers, his thoughts drifted again.  

He thought about his cousins in the Muse Cabin—how they had welcomed him with open arms, teaching him about their shared legacy and encouraging him to explore his talents. He thought about the countless hours spent poring over ancient texts and unraveling the stories of heroes who had come before him. He thought about the friends he had made along the way, the late-night conversations by the campfire, and the sense of belonging that had grown steadily over the months.  

And he thought about his father.  

That was the one part of his life that hadn’t changed. His father was still distant, still consumed by his work, still more of a shadow than a presence in Dorian’s life. But somehow, the pain of that absence felt less sharp now. Maybe it was because he had found a family here, people who cared about him and celebrated him for who he was. Or maybe it was because he had started to accept that his father’s shortcomings didn’t define him. Only time would tell. 

“Seventeen,” he murmured to himself as he stepped outside, the crisp winter air biting at his cheeks. “Feels kind of weird, doesn’t it, Marie?”  

Marie, who had followed him out and was now winding around his legs, let out a soft meow.  

Dorian chuckled. “I’ll take that as a yes.”  

The camp was quiet in the early morning, the usual hustle and bustle of training and chores still hours away. Dorian walked slowly, letting the stillness settle over him. 

As he watched the dawn of a new year unfold before him, Dorian felt a quiet sense of hope. He didn’t know what the next year would bring—new challenges, new adventures, maybe even more changes—but he knew one thing for certain: he wasn’t the same boy who had arrived here all those months ago, lost and uncertain.  

He was Dorian Trying. Son of Clio. A historian in the making. A camper, a friend, and maybe even a little bit of a hero.  

And today, on his 17th birthday, he was ready for whatever came next.  

**The Dining Pavilion**

Dorian sat at the Muse Cabin’s designated table in the Dining Pavilion, the morning sunlight spilling across the stone floor and reflecting off the celestial bronze plates and goblets. His coffee steamed gently in his hands, the rich aroma mingling with the scents of fresh bread, fruits, and sizzling bacon. The world around him was lively as campers chattered and laughed, but he remained in his quiet bubble, gazing out toward the forest in the distance.

He took a slow sip, the warmth spreading through him, grounding him in the moment. His plate was half-finished—scrambled eggs, a slice of toast, and a few strawberries left untouched as his thoughts wandered. The year behind him felt like a blur, a whirlwind of self-discovery and trials, and he found himself wondering what stories this new year would write.

His fingers traced absent patterns on the edge of the mug, the soft clink of his nail against the ceramic punctuating the quiet rhythm of his musings. Somewhere in the crowd, a burst of laughter erupted, and a fleeting smile tugged at his lips before he returned to his introspection, the coffee slowly cooling in his grasp.

**The Amphitheater**

The Amphitheater was bathed in pale morning light, the seats empty except for a few birds flitting between the stone rows. Dorian sat cross-legged on the stage, his journal open in his lap, pages filled with scrawled notes, crossed-out lines, and fragmented melodies. His pencil tapped absently against the paper, a soft beat that echoed faintly in the quiet space.

The song had been haunting him for weeks now, its melody a stubborn thread in his mind, refusing to unravel fully. He hummed softly, the sound low and uncertain, as he tried to piece the fragments together. One line flowed into another before faltering, and he scribbled a few adjustments, biting his lip in concentration.

The wind stirred, rustling the journal’s pages and carrying with it the faint scent of salt from the sea. He paused, staring out over the empty seats as if the answers might be hidden somewhere in the silence. Then, with renewed determination, he bent over his journal again, the pencil gliding across the page as he chased the elusive perfection of his song.

**The Arena**

The clash of weapons and the distant shouts of other campers training filled the air of the Arena, but Dorian’s world was focused and singular. The halberd in his hands felt like an extension of himself, its weight familiar and reassuring as he moved through the motions of his routine.

He began with slow, deliberate strikes, the blade cutting through the air with a soft hiss. Each swing was measured, his muscles tightening and releasing in perfect rhythm. The sun climbed higher, glinting off the polished metal as sweat began to bead on his brow.

As the routine intensified, his movements became more fluid, almost like a dance. He pivoted, lunged, and swept the halberd in wide arcs, the staff and blade moving in tandem. His breathing steadied into a practiced cadence, his mind clearing with each strike.

Finally, he finished with a sharp downward slash, the blade striking the training dummy with a satisfying thud. He stepped back, resting the halberd against the ground as he wiped his brow with the back of his hand, the ache in his muscles a familiar and welcome sensation.

I was in a cycle where I fought weightloss for 26 of my then 40 years on this planet.  I’d lose and slowly regain, often worse than where I started.  The tools and techniques are important, they are the foundation and I’ve found CICO is the best strategy for me with some modifications.  That being said the mental side is mandatory.  I think it’s sad that this has had a grip on me from 14 to 40 and I hope I can help others not have to go through such a long process.

# WEIGHT LOSS & FOOD STRATEGY

**Outline**

* General Tips
* My Personal Daily Food Target
* Tools
* Eating Out
* Proteins
* Substitutions: Make the Most of your Calories

**General Tips**

1. The first few weeks are the hardest, if you feel discouraged don’t be!  You’re already winning!
2. Figure out WHY you overeat: is it hunger? Boredom? Comfort?  Find a way to replace it with a healthy habit.  I feel better 1 hr after I clean a room or do a project, I don’t feel better or remember a dessert I ate 1 hr later.  IF you don’t figure out WHY, you are doomed to long term failure. Sure you can raw dog it with discipline and achieve milestones in the short terms months or a year maybe, but if you don’t address WHY you will, inevitably, end back up where you started.  
3. Give yourself TIME to adapt and adjust to a healthy diet with reasonable portions.
4. Focus on mental toughness and mental health, it’s 2025 if you need help get it!
5. Work with a dietician if your insurance covers it or you can afford it, but follow reputable sources like Mayo or Cleveland clinic for health advice if not. 
6. Do something SUSTAINABLE: calculate maintenance calories at your target weight and plan what you would eat each day, eat the same stuff but less to lose weight.  See #2, you don’t want to end up back where you started-I did that for 28 years.
7. Non-scale victories are real!  Focus on how you feel mentally, physically, bloodwork, blood pressure, blood sugar, how your clothes fit, energy level and otherwise.   I felt better only 5 days into my new lifestyle.
8. Avoid fad diets (I won’t list what I think are fads or transition only, but realize nutrition/dieting has more misinformation online than politics)
9. Use a TDEE calculator to figure out your maintenance calories and target deficit
10. Vet calories in apps or online, I’ve found huge errors in Loseit and myfitness pal and other rules of thumb.  USDA FoodData Central and the manufacturer’s nutrition label are what I trust.  USDA is very useful for things you don’t have nutrition facts.  Is there error?  Yes, but error goes both ways and overtime it cancels out.
11. Spend calories wisely like money (don’t waste them on non-nutritious or non-filling food)
12. Track calories, even if it’s a questionable estimate
13. Use a meal app such as LoseIt to track meals or a google sheet on your phone
14. Weigh everything you can to the gram, it’s much more accurate than volume or servings per container, just hit zero as you add things to your plate.  It’s also a heck of a lot easier than measuring things in cups and scraping them out.  Things like avocado’s and sweet potatoes there is no other way to be accurate, not 1 large or small fruit etc.  The only thing I measure by volume is salad dressings and condiments at times with a 1 TBSP measuring spoon, but they can be weighed too.  (baking is a different issue-I obviously use volume).  Over time you’ll become skilled at eyeballing food and portions.
15. Don’t let a bad meal or day carry on to the next meal or day, it happens and isn’t a reason to get discouraged or an excuse to binge the rest of the day.  You went over 500-1000 calories?  Guess what that’s probably a lot less than you would’ve gone over before you started your journey.  It’s actually a victory.  I went 1500 calories over on my birthday, totally unplanned, but a year prior I would’ve been 4000+!  That is a WIN!
16. Plan meals ahead for the day
17. Have a reserve contingency heading into late afternoon/evening
18. Eating out can be controlled, don’t view it as you have to give up or will always go over
19. Eat high protein, high fiber food and get plenty of VARIED greens and fruits.  Variety is important because no one fruit or vegetable has everything you need.
20. If you have a lot of extra calories available because you skipped a meal, don’t eat them all at once, spread them out an hour especially if you are still training your body to a reasonable portion
21. COOK!  You can make better, more filling meals for your money and calories than you can buy!
22. Healthy foods without a corn subsidy can be more costly, but are cheaper than chronic issues associated with a bad diet
23. Meal prep so you have options available if you’re short on time
24. I usually batch cook a lot of chicken on the grill and freeze it in Ziploc freezer bags and defrost as needed and it’s the base in most of my meals if I don’t have time to cook fresh-this leaves me with no excuses to eat healthy
25. Meal prep and freeze complete meals-I do this with my chicken pasta, chilli, soups, etc.  These reheat very well and are my go to when strained or working 12 hour shifts.
26. Weigh only once a week, your weight varies too much day to day to track and for many it is discouraging when they see weight from either a delayed bowel movement or a salty meal making the “numbers” look bad when in reality they are doing well.
27. Your palate will get better!  If you’re a foodie like me you’ll become able to taste and appreciate things you couldn’t before because you were overwhelmed by junk foods and insane amounts of sugar or Guy Fieri entrees that use every spice known to humanity.
28. Plan a cheat day or reward, but be reasonable and don’t let a meal turn into a day or week, we hit reset every morning.  If you find this triggers you, then don’t do it.  
29. Do what works for YOU, this is just what worked for me and is supported by my goals and dietician.  It’s got to work for you.  Just because something worked for someone else, doesn’t mean it will work for you.  We are all individuals with unique stories and sometimes past traumas. 
30. Maintenance is tough, read my last post in CICO about this, but for me obesity is a lifelong disease that I do need to be aware of in my choices

**My Personal Daily Targets**

Most of my days are 30-40% protein, 35-45% carbs and 20-25% fat (note: I eat high fiber foods)

140 grams of protein a day minimum (usually higher)

35 grams of fiber minimum 

Saturated Fats <20 grams (or lower)

Sodium <3500 mg

Multiple servings of leafy greens

Multiple servings of vegetables

Multiple servings of fruit (varied fruits)

No white bread, white rice, or processed food

Limited sugar

Healthy Fats

Healthy Oils

At least one treat a day

**Tools**

1. $10 electronic food scale
2. 1 TBSP measuring spoon (I recommend a stubby coffee scoop)
3. Travel stainless/silicone condiment containers (can also be used for nuts or cheese to add to salads, not just dressing or BBQ sauce)
4. Cooler with ice packs (so you can bring meals when needed)

**Eating Out**

Research beforehand

Don’t be afraid to ask for a menu item to be modified or a side changed

Look for chicken, particularly boneless skinless, fish not breaded or fried, salmon, or grilled shrimp

Realize some “grilled” items sometimes are really cooked in oil on a flat top or skillet

Salads are a good option but you have to watch salad dressing as restaurant dressing can be very calorie heavy, obviously cheese is not low fat or calories, nuts and candied nuts you need to watch.  

Almost every restaurant, even if they don’t have a healthy option, I’ve managed to find one.  My panic button is a salad with lean protein.  If there is an adder for chicken or shrimp I have them do that and often I ask to double the adder as usually it’s not a whole lot of meat.  I bring my own salad dressing that is 5-10 calories a serving in small pocket cups (stainless with silicone lids).  There are squeeze silicone bottles you can use but they are more difficult to clean properly.  

**Proteins**

I eat primarily boneless skinless chicken breast, cod, salmon and shrimp.  Most of my protein is chicken as it's cheap, has a lot of protein for the calories and is low in saturated fat.  I view calories as money and I get a lot more bang for my buck with chicken versus 80/20 ground beef.  For less calories I hit my protein target more easily and have calories to spare on other items I enjoy.  Cod, crab and shrimp are good too, particularly prepared in a non-stick pan with a minimal amount of healthy fat.  I eat salmon once a week for the Omega 3.  If I do eat ground beef I use 93/7 to get more protein for the calories and less saturated fat.  My cholesterol numbers were poor before and now optimal with this strategy.

**Substitutions: Make the Most of your Calories**

**Potatoes**

I love sweet potatoes, they are so good they can be eaten plain, but I sometimes top with cinnamon, splenda brown sugar blend, a sugar free syrup, or cheese.  

**Greek Yogurt**

Greek yogurt is a great food.  It is reasonable in calories and has a lot of protein for the calories and if bought in low fat or nonfat versions has low saturated fat.  I use it as a sub for sour cream, to create dips (fiesta ranch seasoning, ranch seasoning, add sals or hot sauce).  I also use it with fruit to create a nutritious snack or pre or post workout snack that's high in protein.  In that case I add splenda to it and pure vanilla extract.  You can even strain it in the fridge overnight, add artificial sweetener and vanilla and it's almost like an icing or frosting.  

**Sauces**

BBQ sauce for example look at Sweet Baby Ray's the primary ingredient is sugar (HFCS).  If you look at a sauce like Stubb's you'll see the first ingredient is tomato's so it has a lot lower calories and isn't as bad for you.  You can take that a step further and use a sugar free sauce like G Hughe's line of BBQ sauces that are only 10 calories for 2 TBSP's.  There are a lot of low calories hot sauces, but you have to watch sodium content.  

**Salad Dressing**

Look for light or reduced calorie dressings as they are often 45-60 cals per 2 TBSP versus 110+.  You can take it further and utilize a dressing like I use at times called Skinny Girl which is 5 cal for 2 TBSP Balsamic vinaigrette or 10 cal for 2 TBSP for Honey Dijon.  I also like Bolthouse Farms for ranch dressing. Take those calorie savings, add extra protein, fruits, nuts or avocado!  Watch the salad dressings for sodium level-some are insane.

**Cheese**

Cheese can be high in calories, sodium and watch the saturated fat.  I use skim mozarella, it's low in calories and has the most protein per calories out of most cheeses.  Alternatively I use a reduced fat mexican cheese which is 10 calories more a serving.  You still need to watch the saturated fat and sodium.  

**Fats**

With eating boneless skinless chicken breasts I found my fat consumption too low. I add back in heathy fats.  I bake or cook with olive oil or avocado oil.  I also eat nuts or avocado's.  I vary the nuts but primarily use almonds.   I'll have nuts plain or add them to salads.  Avocado's I eat by themselves, as part of a salad or on taco's.

**Cooking Oils/Baking Fats**

I only cook with Olive Oil or Avocado oil to keep fats healthy and avoid unsaturated fats.  I use Avocado oil when I need a high temp oil to avoid smoking.  As a butter substitution when baking I use avocado oil 1:1 where it calls for butter or for lower calorie usage I substitute greek yogurt or a mix of greek yogurt and avocado oil.  Some Keto diets push coconut oil, but the saturated fat is very high.

**Fruits**

Fruits are full of all sorts of things so I won't write an article on these.  My big takeaway is that they aren't all equal so I eat a variety to get the full picture.  I love tomatoes, apples, strawberries, raspberries, blue berries, and blackberries.  I add them to salads or soemtimes I add the latter to greek yogurt.  

**Rice**

I avoid white rice and utilize brown rice or a rice subsitution.  Cauliflower rice is popular and a good low calorie filler.  My favorite rice is Right Rice which is 165-170 cal per serving and has 10g of protein and fiber.  I use Right Rice 90% of the time in place of regular rice because I'm getting more for my calories.

**Pasta**

I use pasta from Barilla either their Protein+ line or the red lentil pasta made from chckpeas and/or red lentils.  I like both, but they have higher protein content than regular pasta and the Protein+ tastes like regular pasta.  Like Right Rice I like that I'm getting more for my calories.

**Tortillas**

I love Mexican food.  I use La Banderita Carb Counter tortillas.  They are much lower in calories and add a small amount of protein and fiber.  I make taco's, quesadillas, and even toast them to add to salads.

**Snacks**

Kind mini nut bars 90 cal

Yasso greek yogurt bars

Lowfat Greek Yogurt and Fruit Bowl (Greek yogurt, Splenda, pure vanilla extract, then add raspberries, strawberries, blackberries and blueberries for a high protein snack) you can also use Jello sugar free instant pudding mix 

Optimum Nutrition protein powder plus frozen fruit above, add 1% milk if calories allow, but still tastes good with water

**KETO Products**

They’re not all equal and some have really high saturated fats if that concerns you as it does me.

**Salads**

I eat a salad once a day.  I aim for 500-550 calories and 40g or greater protein and good vitamins and plenty of fiber.  It makes me feel good and keeps me full.  Early on I skipped some of the higher calorie adders. I sometimes add a fairly plain salad to add volume and fiber to keep me full if I feel my entree isn't filling enough or needs a healthy balance of fruits and veggies.

I eat primarily a romaine blend and or spinach as they are both well regarded versus iceberg.  

For protein I add chicken, shrimp or salmon.

The volume helps in feeling full and you need greens.  

I add any of the following:

Tomato

Red onion

black olive

almonds or other healthy nuts

apple

peppers

low fat cheese

toasted low carb tortilla strips

shredded carrots

cucumber

raspberries or other berries such as strawberries

avocado

Hopefully he's not so wild anymore."" Your spouse replies ""What? What do you mean?"" You look at your spouse and say ""Huh?""


You both look at each other in silence for a moment before you hear a voice that sounds a lot like the munchkins from the wizard of Oz yelling ""AHHHHHH!!!"" And you see a little thing run across the floor and hide behind the coffee table.


Your spouse quickly stands on the couch and yells ""There's a rat! Get it!""


You immediately grab an open cardboard box, hoping to trap the rat, and approach it. As you get near the little 4 inch tall creature, it makes itself seen. It looks like a normal looking man, probably mid 30's with dark brown hair and a beard, but he has a literal rat tail and says to you ""Greetings human. My name is Susan. It is customary of my people to introduce themselves by running and screaming. I hope I didn't frighten you.""


You take a moment to collect yourself and say ""No it's okay I just---- Wait did you say your name is Susan?"" Susan responds ""Yeah it's a family name. Just move on."" You say ""Okay well, it's nice to meet you. I've never seen someone like you before. What are you doing here?""


Susan tells you about how he and his family have been living in your walls for a while and that they've run out of food. Susan asks for your help feeding his rat family until their rat crops grow back and they can live happily in their rat home. Susan then yells back at the wall and says ""Carlos! I want to introduce you to the human!""


Carlos then comes running from the wall, screaming ""AHHHHH!"" on the way to you. You see that Carlos is a very beautiful young woman with long red hair and a lovely white dress on. She greets herself and says ""I'm very pleased to meet you both. My name is Carlos, I'm Susan's wife.""


You simply respond with ""Carlos?"" She explains it's a family name and to just move on.


Carlos explains that their 10 rat people children are going hungry and the family needs your help.

I have this feeling that caffeine starts to sow seeds of self doubt and hurt our confidence to strive toward meaningful goals. I'll explain why.

Many of us have heard the phrase ""Coffee - do stupid things faster, with more energy!"" which is pretty accurate I find. Lets say we get up in the morning every day, blast a bunch of caffeine and get to work - doing stupid things faster with more energy. We all know that hyper anxious, chaotic faffing about that often arises from a strong morning coffee. After a while you are going to start thinking ""damn, every time I get caffeinated I become super motivated I go and do things badly, get stressed out and make a mess of everything, but if I don't drink it I achieve nothing at all"". Repeat daily caffeine intake over the course of ones adult life and a subconscious mindset gets reinforced - ""Motivation leads you nowhere"". 

My feeling is that the calm, focused and slow release energy that comes from being in our natural healthy state typically helps us achieve more meaningful things in the long run, and the process is also more enjoyable.

1hr43nv,https://i.redd.it/ec5otl2v8eae1.jpeg,Rosa Mocha by Scentari - Best budget Coffee based perfume ??,"Recently, a few weeks back, I saw this brand called Scentari, so I ordered almost all of their perfumes to check them out.

In the market, we don’t have many options for coffee-based scents (the most popular ones are Intense Cafeand Ristretto Intense Cafe by Montale, and Amore Cafe by Mancera). Other than that, there aren’t many coffee-based fragrances that last a very long time.

Rosa Mocha by Scentari is inspired by Intense Cafe:-

•Opening: Initially, I get a very strong bitter coffee smell with some sweet roses in the background. In the opening, the coffee smell is very strong, but later, it moves to the background as other notes dominate.

•Dry-down: After 30 minutes, the coffee takes a backseat (and becomes creamy here), while the roses and vanilla start to dominate the fragrance. A lot of people might have tried rose-vanilla or rose-oud perfumes, but because of the coffee note, this one smells a little different.

•Performance: This comes in extrait concentration, and it does feel very thick. It projects nicely for around 2+ hours and lasts the whole day on clothes.

Note: Most of Scentari’s perfumes are from their new batch, so they might not perform as well initially. I’d suggest macerating them for a few weeks.

Weather/Occasion:
It’s a sweet fragrance that really shines in winter, but you can also wear it on summer evenings. It can be worn anywhere and is slightly on the sweeter side (but not overly sweet). It’s perfectly unisex and will definitely pull a lot of compliments.

Rating and Review:
9.5/10. In my opinion, it’s a perfect value-for-money scent (₹600 for 30ml). The quality, blending, and concentration are all top-notch. The 30ml-100ml bottles are very heavy and come with pressurized atomizers.

Scentari Review:
Scentari is a very new Indian house, and they are working hard. However, their shipping process is quite slow since they make perfumes in very small batches. My order took around two weeks to arrive, but they’re very active on WhatsApp and answer every query. In my opinion, they’re doing everything right, from product quality to packaging.
That said, right now they are launching too many perfumes at the same time, which I don’t think is a great idea. Instead, they should focus on making a bigger stock of fewer SKUs so they can manage everything better.",4,1735742250.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,2,0.84,False

Looking for a horror indie game (pixel art, episodic)

I’m looking for a game I used to play on mobile (it was available on Android). It’s a pixel art, episodic horror game with demons and supernatural elements. The main character starts as a teenage boy who, along with his friends, explores an abandoned house with a serial killer involved. They get separated, and then the story fast-forwards with him becoming an adult detective.
	•	As a child, he wears a yellow shirt and blue pants.
	•	One of his friends is revealed to be trans during the story.
	•	In the adult episodes, he wears a big detective coat, but everyone, including his boss, tells him not to wear it because it’s dirty.
	•	There’s a bit of humor in the game; for example, the main character says “a bidet (…) I’m Italian” when interacting with a bidet in the abandoned house
	•	The game has episodes, and you could optionally send money to the developer with the message “pay me a coffee.”

It’s no longer available on iOS, and I think it had “dungeons” or “cave” in the title. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

1hr41v3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hr41v3,a tale of 2 cereal concepts,"to start of the year, we tried 3 coffee shops in Makati. 

first off was Candid Coffee since i was hoping we can try their omakase set. it was a spontaneous visit so we weren’t able to set an appointment via their IG page. i tried their eispänner, instead. it was ok but the experience wasnt what i was hoping for so we’ll skip it lol. 

next stop, Black Bean cafe. it was packed and we had to wait in line. and then last one was ODD Cafe. 

Now this post is mainly to compare the similar concepts between BB and ODD.

2 Cereal drinks, different feedbacks. not necessarily taste-wise, but experience-wise. 

i liked the BB cereal because the cereal stayed crunchy and intact on top of the cream. meanwhile, my friend didn’t enjoy her ODD cereal because it immediately disintegrated making her drink unpleasantly grainy. 

PS. i’ll defo go back for the BB fish and chips too ",1,1735742082.0,CoffeePH,1,1.0,False
1hr41cx,https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1hr41cx/trying_to_find_the_proper_name_for_this_mixed/,Trying to find the proper name for this mixed drink,"So the drink in question is pretty simple its basically a mud slide minus the vodka and instead replaced with whisky 

Its 1 part cream liquor 

1 part whisky 

And 1-2 parts coffee liquor 

It can also be served as a frozen variant where ice cream is added 

Sometimes the drink may also have added chocolate sauce or shavings 

Ive heard this drink referred to as a Tennessee mud slide 

But looking up that drink its typically normal coffee and not coffee liquor 

So im wondering if anyone know the proper name of the drink

1hr3zar,https://i.redd.it/hsru7wdn7eae1.jpeg,Review: Rosewood Baha Mar,"Hi! Posting a recap of our recent stay at Rosewood Baha Mar, which was my first trip booked with @alex_travels, who was terrifically responsive and knowledgeable throughout. If you’re like me and have lurked on here for a while wondering whether to go with her for a TA-assisted booking, do it. 

Where we went: Nassau, Bahamas, Rosewood Baha Mar 
When we went: Christmas to New Year’s 
Who went: Family trip - 2 adults, 1 kid (6) 
Service: 9
﻿﻿Rosewood staff and to a large degree the entire Baha Mar team is professional, hospitable, and service-oriented. Our stay in a suite afforded us a three-person butler team, who were always available via text and checked in unobtrusively in person 1-3x per day. Service teams at the Rosewood-property restaurants (Costa, Cafe Boulud, the Library) as well as at off-property Baha spots like Marcus Fish were also excellent: attentive, friendly, accommodating. Baha Mar employs an absolute ton of lifeguards between the 9 hotel pools and Baha Bay waterpark, and they were across the board alert and attentive. The casino staff I encountered — dealers, floor personnel, cocktail servers, cashiers — were all helpful, some cheerful others ambivalent.  
﻿﻿We reserved a poolside cabana three days and just grabbed poolside chairs the fourth day. Service was quick and friendly and attentive at both setups, and the pool staff remembers guests and their preferences from day to day 
﻿﻿Ordered room service the night we arrived, and it was to the room within 20 minutes, served on our patio. They were out of the bottle of wine we wanted, so they brought one listed at $40 more for no additional charge. 
Property: 8
﻿﻿The Rosewood property, restaurants, pools, beach, etc felt chill and never crowded, even during peak Festive season. Outside in the shared Baha Mar spaces was another story. Grin and bear it for the waterpark, which is A LOT but also a lot of fun. 
Very well maintained property, clean throughout, from pristine pools to tropical vegetation. A large water feature in the front of the complex has nightly fountain/light shows set to music. 
﻿﻿Easy 10-ish-min drive from the Nassau airport. There is a Baha Mar desk at the exit of the airport terminal where, if you arranged transportation, they will escort you to your car. 
Rooms: 8
Garden View 1 Bedroom Suite. King bed, with twin rollaway on request. Three patios. 1 full bath w shower and soaking tub, 1 half bath, kitchen w full fridge, washer and dryer. 970 sq feet
﻿﻿Comfortable and intuitive layout, save for a random storage room off the foyer that seemed to be a waste. Breezy and light/neutral design. Smart lighting and curtains that were easy to operate. 
﻿﻿Comfy and clean bedding, big plush towels and robes. Twice-daily unobtrusive room servicing. Bathroom amenities (shower gel, shampoo, conditioner) were fine but not noteworthy.  
Food: 8
﻿﻿Had read a lot about the crazy-high food prices and packed a full bag of snacks…which mostly went untouched. The Elite benefits that Alex’s booking provided included free daily breakfast at three Rosewood restaurants. The days we had a cabana it included a $150 F&B credit, and restaurants on property take 50% off kids meals provided they order from the kids menu (which even at Cafe Boulud includes a buttered pasta option). Food prices and wine markups were in line with most major-city US restaurants, and we didn’t find ourselves sticker-shocked too often (exception: a latte at breakfast was $12 while plain drip coffee was $14?). 
There are dozens of places to grab a bite, from sit-down restaurants to quick food-truck options on the beach. We had our best meals at Marcus Samuelsson’s Marcus Fish and Chop House (excellent service, and the corn bread with spiced rum butter and Abaco jerk chicken were anything but boring resort food), Costa (gorgeous with the seating on top of a big koi lagoon), and Cafe Boulud (the host had a Minecraft coloring page for our son and the sommelier had a perfect cab franc recommendation to pair with our filet and foie). 

Extras & activities: 9
﻿﻿
Obviously the Baha Bay waterpark is a huge draw, likely the main reason many families are there. We found it easy to pop in for an hour or two most days, then walk back to the Rosewood pools and hot tub for some quiet time. Lots to do at the waterpark, and even adults who don’t like waterparks will appreciate that it’s clean and safe and fun for most. 

﻿﻿We didn’t play golf at the resort course, but the replica miniature golf course, Mini Blue, on property is unique and super enjoyable (I’ve never seen a par 5 on a mini golf course before!). 

There are several animal experiences that you can do in small groups. We enjoyed meeting the Rosewood’s flock of ambassador flamingos, feeding the budgies in the aviary, and going behind the scenes with staff as they fed nurse sharks, sea turtles and sting rays. 

There is enough to do that you could program every minute of your trip, or just relax and do nothing. 

Experienced a 90-min intuitive massage at Sense spa, which was excellent. Sense only has treatment rooms on site — you have to go to Espa in the Grand Hyatt if you want to use the steam room, sauna, etc. 

We found Rosewood Baha Mar to be the perfect mix of luxe-serenity and beach-pool fun. Would definitely recommend Rosewood to families considering a Baha Mar vacation who want a slightly elevated, calmer experience from the other hotels on property. ",10,1735741840.0,chubbytravel,1,0.92,False

1hr3z5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1hr3z5g/vigilantes_journey/,Vigilante's Journey ,"Hey guys. This is the story that I made it. I'll be making its other parts slowly. Therefore, This is the beginning of it that I made. Hope you enjoy! 

16th December, 12:00am

The hush in Saintmeadow is quite intimidating to the citizens of this city in the middle of the night. Because of the serious crimes like robbery, human-trafficking, rape, molestation and others that occur in this city anytime. The Government was quite greedy and Evil who didn't care about the problems that happen in this city. Instead, He let them suffer.The regime bribed the police to not let them intervene in this case. Hence, The city was quite violent in night-time. No one left their home during the interval of night. Even the Citizens aren't safe in their homes. Gun-shooting, which is common in Saintmeadow due to negligence and having no support from the authorities. 

After all of this, The movement of vigilantism was commenced in order to prevent violence and bring justice to the citizens of Saintmeadow and the other districts where the violence was happening there. Those vigilantes aren't ordinary. They had special powers that were not common in human beings. Only the authorities and the special individuals could acquire it. That power is divided into two categories: Mental and Physical abilities. In Mental abilities, A person can control the mental aspects of an opponent's ability which involves hypnosis, Psychological Torture and so on. While in Physical abilities, it includes the physical aspects of these abilities like real life fighting experience in an advanced way happens in movies. These abilities were scattered by the crystal which got broken due to the fall of meteor in a lake nearby Saintmeadow. Therefore, The world had been changed drastically. People who born in this world may have these abilities. There's a possibility that they won't. because it's very rare. 

There's a scene which caught the attention of a vigilante in Saintmeadow. That scene was about a lady running in her way helplessly from a psychopath, Potter. He was the criminal who murdered many. Now he was chasing her like a Lion hunting down a helpless deer. Once A Lady got caught by him, She was weeping in shock and begging him to stop. He said in a psychotic laugh,“You really think that innocence in your eyes can develop empathy in me?! Now it's time for you To leave this world, darling!” and tried to kill her. But the intervention of a Vigilante prevented this. That Vigilante is Sam with his Vigilante name as Unknown Chaos. This vigilante has the power to manipulate solar energy. Potter was repelled back by the offensive solar wave of his power. “What The hell?!” Said by Potter. The Large solar beam was generating from the centre of his hand. Once he launched it at him, That beam crossed through him which killed him there suddenly. “Good riddance.” Sam said. Now that the pageant got silenced, He looked back at that lady and about to go away. “Hey!” said by the lady. Sam looked at her and said “What?” “T-Thank you for saving me.” the lady said. As he heard her and found that she was thankful because of him, he intended to walk off. “Can you come to my home and have a conversation for a while? I want to show my gratitude for you as you saved my life. Please?” Said by the lady. Then he head to her home and had a little conversation with a sip of coffee they both had. “How old are you? You look quite young.” The lady said it in friendliness. “16” Sam said it politely. 
“Wow, At this young age, You could do these risky tasks? You are so extraordinary, kid. Don't you have a family? I mean you could enjoy and live your life at fullest.” The lady said with a playful smile. 
“I live alone.” 
“Oh.” 
Once they talked with each other, The lady said with a smile “It's good to meet you, kid. Someday we will meet again and have some chattering.” “Sure” Sam said. After having farewell, He went way. He was in his way to reach home through leaping from one building to another. He glanced at the police car making a siren. He realised that the cops were looking for him. so He blasted the car with a solar ray coming out of his index finger. The cops died there. “Bunch of worthless pawns of laws. That's what they deserved.” He said. After that, He went off and reached home.

As we welcome a brand new year, it's the perfect time to set meaningful intentions that can shape our future. New Year's resolutions don’t have to be about drastic changes; they can simply be about making small, consistent improvements that lead to a more fulfilling life. Here’s a list of resolutions I believe can make 2025 unforgettable.

# Start Waking Up Early 

https://preview.redd.it/1p907f585eae1.jpg?width=4989&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f04448ca031d20e0a5587fc2e761baab43ca683f

Adapting to early mornings isn’t always easy, especially if you're a night owl like me. But research shows that early risers tend to be more productive and mentally sharp throughout the day. This year, I’m focusing on gradually waking up earlier, starting with a 7:00 AM wake-up and embracing some quiet moments before the day kicks off.

# Commit to Daily Yoga 

https://preview.redd.it/627qrgpc5eae1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88d93c5f5f904d2219bdf92be6aa7e73c34c258f

Yoga has always been a favorite for relaxation and physical health. Despite trying it in the past, I’ve struggled with consistency. In 2025, my goal is to do at least 15 minutes of yoga every day, whether it’s to energize me in the morning or to relax before bed.

# Make Punctuality a Priority

https://preview.redd.it/e8pwrd7g5eae1.jpg?width=5181&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=146121e36d01240e51a16582225a33036a7cd2d7

 I’ve often found myself rushing or just missing the mark on time. This year, I’m focusing on becoming more punctual. Setting alarms, organizing my mornings, and respecting time—both mine and others—are key areas I want to improve. It's all about making progress, not perfection.

# Cut Down Back to Back Coffee 

https://preview.redd.it/qgxyrihk5eae1.jpg?width=5992&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5800aba32d28ba7f4776581db8bf246fd43609a0

While I love my coffee, I realize that I’ve become too reliant on it to keep my energy levels up. This year, I aim to reduce my caffeine intake and explore healthier alternatives like herbal teas and water. The goal isn’t to cut out coffee entirely, but to enjoy it more mindfully.

# No Social Media Binge

https://preview.redd.it/qtwt62xo5eae1.jpg?width=3941&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c45b2b18035df760dbab309f48ffacdec84b5c4d

Endlessly scrolling through social media can quickly eat up hours of my day. While it’s great for staying connected, I’ve decided to set strict limits on my usage. Designating specific times for checking social feeds and avoiding social media before bed will help improve my focus and mental well-being.

# Walk 10,000 Steps a Day 

https://preview.redd.it/6555fp3t5eae1.jpg?width=3500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5430b832668222b95dcf1d87b7cd5f9185272377

Walking is a simple and effective way to stay active and healthy. In 2025, I’m making it a goal to hit 10,000 steps every day—whether it's a walk in the morning, a stroll during lunch, or walking while on a phone call. Staying consistent with this will improve my mood and fitness levels.

# Prioritize an Earlier Bedtime 

https://preview.redd.it/czprntm16eae1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=627d01b5feb6f448856cfa98ae925fcd24f34d4c

Late nights have often disrupted my ability to get proper rest. In 2025, I’m committing to getting to bed earlier and sticking to a peaceful bedtime routine. No more distractions—just quality sleep to fuel my productivity and mental health for the next day.

# Learn Something New Every Day - Make 365 How to learning : 

https://preview.redd.it/eti4kxy56eae1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6944f4d8d59c8c7e07e8d3f7792d7c312673e7ab

 Life-long learning is one of the most rewarding things we can do. This year, I’ve set a goal to learn something new every month, whether it's a practical skill like fixing a broken appliance or a creative challenge like baking new recipes. Staying curious will keep me sharp and engaged.

# Monthly Treks 

https://preview.redd.it/8ujo7pg96eae1.jpg?width=3680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8771fb6f26363045fddc34087815aff7a0c7fd6

Spending time in nature has a way of recharging our spirits. This year, I’m committing to a monthly trek—whether it’s a scenic hike, a mountain climb, or simply exploring new outdoor spaces. These adventures will be the perfect opportunity for physical exercise and mental rejuvenation.

# Dedicate More Time to Family 

https://preview.redd.it/u9395e3e6eae1.jpg?width=5184&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=669c9738a92ca5223e9bcc49bce5f03e14753bf0

Life can get overwhelmingly busy, but family should always come first. This year, I’m setting aside my weekends to spend quality time with loved ones—cooking together, enjoying activities, and creating memories. Family time is invaluable and something I’ll cherish.

Setting resolutions isn’t about being perfect; it’s about making steady progress. Even if we falter along the way, the effort will always make a difference. Here’s to a New Year filled with hope, growth, and unforgettable moments in 2025!",1,1735741524.0,TechNerdHub,0,1.0,False

I use a Breville Smart grinder which a lot of people hate on but as a beginner I really enjoy it, I've had no problems with it at all (other than needing micro adjustments at times). I have no retention and I just find it so easy to use. In the middle of grinding it comes to a stop and makes an awful noise when I use this bean! I stop it, take everything apart, and I just can't seem to find what the issue is. But I do know it only happens when I use that specific bean. I have tried a three times with that bean. All purchased months apart so I know it's not the same batch. I brought out the hand grinder and used my aeropress so I could finish the bag because I was terrified of messing up my new grinder.

1hr3tab,https://www.reddit.com/r/KanojoOkarishimasu/comments/1hr3tab/twin_hearts/,Twin Hearts,"Mei Ichinose stared at her reflection in the dance studio mirror, adjusting her perfectly styled ponytail for the hundredth time. At twelve years old, she'd already mastered her mother's talent for meticulous presentation. The other girls in her advanced ballet class often whispered about how she seemed more like a miniature adult than a kid – poised, collected, and always camera-ready.

Just like mom.

Across Tokyo, in a considerably more chaotic bedroom, Saki Kinoshita was running late – again. Her dark hair refused to cooperate, tangling in the brush as she attempted to tame it into something presentable. Dance gear lay scattered across her floor, mixed with manga volumes and half-finished homework.

""Saki!"" her father's voice called from downstairs. ""You're going to miss the bus to camp!""

""Coming!"" she shouted back, stuffing one last volume of ""One Piece"" into her already overflowing backpack. Unlike her eternally flustered father, Saki typically approached life with a sort of cheerful chaos that somehow worked out in the end.

Neither girl knew about the other.

Neither knew that twelve years ago, their parents – rising actress Ichinose Chizuru and real estate developer Kinoshita Kazuya – had made the painful decision to separate, each taking one twin. The arrangement had been Chizuru's idea, born from a desire to give both girls a chance at a normal childhood despite her increasingly high-profile career.

Kazuya had agreed, though it broke his heart, because he'd never been very good at saying no to Chizuru.

The papers had been discrete: ""Rising Star Mizuhara Chizuru and Long-time Partner Separate Amicably."" No mention of the twins. No hint of the real story. Just another entertainment industry relationship casualty, or so the public thought.

Now, twelve years later, both girls were headed to the same prestigious summer performing arts camp in Karuizawa – Mei for dance, Saki for theater. Neither parent knew about the other's choice. After all, what were the chances?

The universe, it seemed, had a sense of humor.

Mei arrived at Camp Spotlight exactly eleven minutes early, her luggage as organized as her life. She'd inherited her mother's burgundy eyes and natural grace, though her tendency to overthink everything was pure Kazuya – not that she knew that.

""Cabin 7,"" the counselor directed her, checking her paperwork. ""You'll be with three other girls your age.""

Mei nodded politely, wheeling her suitcase along the gravel path. She'd been to plenty of summer camps before – usually dance intensives or acting workshops. Her mother's career meant they moved in artistic circles, though Chizuru had always been careful to let Mei choose her own path.

""I don't want you to feel pressured to follow in my footsteps,"" she'd say, though Mei couldn't imagine wanting anything else. She'd grown up watching her mother transform into different characters, bringing stories to life. It seemed like magic.

Saki, meanwhile, arrived in a whirlwind of energy, nearly tripping over her own feet as she jumped off the bus. She'd gotten her father's expressive face and tendency to wear his heart on his sleeve, though her natural talent for performance was all Chizuru – another fact she didn't know.

""Cabin 7!"" she announced cheerfully to no one in particular, consulting her crumpled information packet. Her father had triple-checked everything before she left, his nervous energy both endearing and slightly embarrassing.

""Call me every day,"" he'd insisted, hugging her too tight at the bus stop. ""And don't forget to eat properly. And make sure you—""

""Dad,"" she'd cut him off with a laugh, ""it's just summer camp, not Mount Everest.""

Now, dragging her overloaded suitcase toward Cabin 7, Saki was too busy taking in the scenery to watch where she was going. The collision was inevitable.

""Oh my god, I'm so sorry!"" she exclaimed, helping the other girl up from where they'd both tumbled. ""I wasn't looking and—""

The words died in her throat.

It was like looking in a mirror – if mirrors showed you a more polished, put-together version of yourself. The other girl was staring back with equal shock, their identical burgundy eyes wide with disbelief.

""This is impossible,"" Mei whispered, her usual composure completely shattered.

""Unless it isn't,"" Saki replied, a grin slowly spreading across her face. ""I'm Saki. Kinoshita Saki.""

""Mei. Ichinose Mei.""

The silence that followed was heavy with twelve years of questions.

They ended up sitting on Mei's perfectly made bed in Cabin 7, their differences even more apparent up close. Where Mei was all careful movements and measured words, Saki gestured wildly as she talked, her enthusiasm infectious.

""So your dad – our dad,"" Mei corrected herself, still struggling with the concept, ""he works in real estate?""

""Yeah, he's actually pretty successful now. Has his own company and everything, though he still gets super awkward sometimes. Like, this one time at a client meeting—"" Saki paused, studying her twin's face. ""What's mom like?""

Mei pulled out her phone, showing Saki a recent photo. ""She's amazing. She's won several acting awards, but she always makes time for me. We have dinner together every Sunday, no matter how busy she is.""

Saki stared at the photo of Chizuru – their mother – looking elegant and composed at some industry event. ""She's beautiful,"" she whispered. ""Dad doesn't keep any pictures of her, but sometimes I catch him watching her movies when he thinks I'm asleep.""

The implications of that statement hung in the air between them.

""They still love each other,"" Mei said slowly, pieces clicking into place. ""Mom never dates, even though people are always trying to set her up. She says she's too busy, but...""

""Dad's the same way!"" Saki bounced excitedly. ""His friends are always trying to introduce him to people, but he always finds some excuse.""

They looked at each other, twelve years of separation crystallizing into a single, shared thought.

""Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"" Saki asked, her grin turning mischievous.

""That depends,"" Mei replied carefully, though a smile was tugging at her lips. ""Are you thinking that we have exactly six weeks at this camp to come up with a plan to get our parents back together?""

""Obviously! It's like that old movie – you know, the one with Lindsay Lohan?""

""The Parent Trap,"" Mei nodded. ""But this isn't a movie, Saki. This is real life. Our parents had reasons for separating.""

""Yeah, but they were probably stupid reasons,"" Saki argued. ""I mean, look at them now – both successful, both single, both obviously still hung up on each other. They just need a little... nudge.""

""A nudge,"" Mei repeated skeptically. ""And I suppose you have ideas about how to provide this nudge?""

Saki's grin widened. ""Well, for starters, we need to switch places at the end of camp.""

""Absolutely not.""

""Oh come on! It's perfect! You can come live with dad and learn all about him, and I can go stay with mom and get to know her. Then, when they figure it out – because they obviously will – they'll have to meet to switch us back.""

Mei wanted to argue, to point out all the ways this plan could go wrong. But there was something compelling about Saki's enthusiasm, something that made even the most outrageous ideas seem possible.

""We'd need to learn everything about each other's lives,"" she said finally. ""Every detail, every habit, every friend's name...""

""So you'll do it?"" Saki bounced on the bed excitedly.

""I must be crazy,"" Mei muttered, but she was smiling. ""Yes, I'll do it.""

The next few weeks were a crash course in living each other's lives. Between camp activities, they quizzed each other relentlessly.

""Dad always has coffee with exactly one sugar and a splash of milk,"" Saki instructed. ""He tries to act cool about it, but he's actually super particular.""

""Mom does her own dishes even though we have a housekeeper,"" Mei countered. ""She says it helps her think through her roles.""

They traded phones, memorized friends' names, and practiced each other's mannerisms. Mei taught Saki how to sit with perfect posture, while Saki showed Mei how to create authentic chaos in her room.

""No, messier,"" Saki insisted. ""Dad's always telling me to clean up, but he says it with this fond smile, like he's remembering something – or someone.""

The hardest part was learning to be each other. Mei had to learn to let her guard down, to embrace Saki's natural spontaneity. Saki had to practice containing her energy, adopting Mei's more reserved demeanor.

""The key,"" Mei explained during one of their late-night planning sessions, ""is to remember that we're not just pretending to be each other. We're getting to know the parents we never knew.""

""Deep,"" Saki teased, but her eyes were serious. ""Do you think they'll be mad?""

""Probably,"" Mei admitted. ""But maybe they'll also remember why they fell in love in the first place.""

As the end of camp approached, they finalized their plan. They'd switch places for two weeks, then orchestrate a meeting between their parents at the same family restaurant where Kazuya and Chizuru had had their first real date – a detail Saki had overheard her father mention once.

""Remember,"" Mei said as they packed their bags – each taking the other's luggage, ""Mom always checks the weather forecast before leaving the house.""

""And Dad triple-checks the door is locked, even though he has an automatic security system,"" Saki added. ""We can do this, right?""

Mei hugged her sister – a gesture that would have seemed impossible six weeks ago. ""We can do this.""

The day they parted, each heading home to the wrong parent, felt surreal. Mei found herself in Saki's more modest but warmly chaotic apartment, while Saki stepped into Mei's carefully curated world.

Kazuya greeted ""Saki"" with his usual enthusiastic hug, and Mei had to fight back tears. This was the father she'd wondered about for twelve years, the man whose features she sometimes caught in her own reflection.

""How was camp, sweetie?"" he asked, helping with her bags. ""Did you remember to eat properly? Make any friends?""

Mei smiled, channeling her sister's energy. ""It was amazing, Dad! And yes, I ate. Most of the time.""

Across town, Saki was experiencing her own emotional moment as Chizuru welcomed ""Mei"" home with a gentle kiss on the forehead.

""The house felt empty without you,"" their mother said softly. ""Though I got a lot of script reading done without you critiquing my character choices.""

Saki laughed, trying to match Mei's more refined tone. ""Someone has to keep you honest, Mom.""

The first few days were a masterclass in acting for both girls. Mei discovered that her father's company had grown significantly over the years, though he still maintained the same nervous energy she'd seen in old photos. He worked hard but always made time for family dinner, even if it meant taking late-night calls afterward.

One evening, she found him watching one of their mother's older films – ""Cherry Blossom Memories."" The look on his face made her heart ache.

""She's amazing, isn't she?"" he said quietly, not realizing he was talking to the wrong daughter. ""Your mother... she always knew exactly who she was, even when she was pretending to be someone else.""

Meanwhile, Saki was learning that their mother's public persona was very different from her private one. At home, Chizuru was more relaxed, often padding around in comfortable clothes with her hair in a messy bun. She helped Saki with homework, shared industry stories, and sometimes just sat in comfortable silence while they both read.

""You're quieter than usual,"" Chizuru observed one night. ""Everything okay?""

""Just thinking,"" Saki replied, studying her mother's face. ""Mom... do you ever miss Dad?""

The question hung in the air like a held breath. Chizuru's expression flickered with something – pain? regret? – before settling into careful neutrality.

""What brought this on?""

""I found an old photo,"" Saki improvised. ""You both looked so happy.""

""We were,"" Chizuru said softly. ""Sometimes being happy isn't enough.""

But Saki noticed she didn't actually answer the question.

As the two weeks drew to a close, both girls set the final phase of their plan in motion. Mei, pretending to be Saki, convinced Kazuya to take her to the old family restaurant for dinner – ""for old times' sake.""

Saki did the same with Chizuru, claiming she wanted to try the place she'd read about in an old magazine article about her mother's early career.

Neither parent suspected they were being set up.

The evening started exactly as planned. Kazuya arrived first with Mei, taking their usual booth near the window. Ten minutes later, Chizuru walked in with Saki – and the world seemed to stop.

""Kazuya?"" Chizuru's voice was barely a whisper.

""Chizuru..."" He stood automatically, then froze as he spotted ""Mei"" beside her. His eyes darted between the two identical girls, realization dawning slowly.

""Hi Dad,"" Saki said in her normal voice.

""Hi Mom,"" Mei added softly.

Chizuru sank into the booth, her professional composure completely shattered. ""How...?""

""Summer camp,"" both girls said simultaneously.

""We met at camp,"" Mei explained.

""And we couldn't just go back to not knowing each other,"" Saki finished.

Kazuya was still standing, looking shell-shocked. ""Mei?"" he breathed, looking at his other daughter properly for the first time in twelve years.

She nodded, tears spilling over. ""Hi Dad.""

The next few minutes were a blur of hugs and tears as parents reunited with the daughters they'd missed for so long. The restaurant's other patrons pretended not to notice, though a few pulled out their phones to secretly record the famous actress's apparent breakdown.

Finally, they all settled into the booth – girls on one side, parents on the other, forced into closer proximity than they'd been in years.

""You planned this,"" Chizuru said, not a question.

""Obviously,"" Saki grinned, unrepentant.

""We had to,"" Mei added more diplomatically. ""You both still love each other. Anyone can see it.""

""It's not that simple,"" Kazuya started, but Saki cut him off.

""Why not? Mom's successful, you're successful. We're old enough to understand about schedules and publicity now. And let's be honest – you both need to get better at relationships because your dating history since the divorce is sad.""

""Saki!"" Mei hissed, but she was fighting a smile.

""What? It's true! Dad watches Mom's movies when he's feeling lonely, and Mom keeps that old photo of them in her bedside drawer—""

""You went through my drawer?"" Chizuru interrupted, but her cheeks were pink.

""The point is,"" Mei took over smoothly, ""you never really gave yourselves a chance to work things out. You just... decided it would be too hard and split us up instead.""

The adults were quiet for a long moment, not quite looking at each other.

""We thought we were doing what was best for you,"" Chizuru finally said. ""My career was taking off, the media attention was intense...""

""And I didn't want to hold you back,"" Kazuya added softly. ""You were meant for amazing things, Chizuru. I was just...""

""The only person who ever saw the real me,"" she finished, meeting his eyes properly for the first time. ""Even when I was pretending to be someone else.""

The girls exchanged excited glances as their parents continued to stare at each other, years of unspoken words passing between them.

""We're not saying you have to get married again right away,"" Mei said carefully.

""Though that would be awesome,"" Saki interjected.

""But maybe... maybe we could try being a real family?"" Mei finished. ""All of us?""

Kazuya looked at Chizuru, and for a moment he was twenty years old again, hopelessly in love with a girl who was both real and pretend. ""What do you think?""

Chizuru smiled – not her camera-ready smile, but the real one that had always been just for him. ""I think... I think we have a lot to talk about.""

""Over dinner?"" he suggested, gesturing to the menus they hadn't even opened yet.

""Over dinner,"" she agreed.

The girls high-fived under the table as their parents began to talk – awkwardly at first, then with increasing comfort as old patterns reasserted themselves. They talked about work, about the girls, about the years they'd missed.

And if anyone in the restaurant noticed Japan's top actress reaching across the table to take her ex-husband's hand, they were kind enough not to mention it.

Later that night, after plans had been made for both girls to split their time between both parents (""At least until you two move back in together,"" Saki had said optimistically), the twins finally had a moment alone.

""We did it,"" Saki grinned, flopping onto Mei's perfectly made bed.

""Phase one,"" Mei corrected, but she was smiling too. ""They still have a lot to work through.""

""Please, did you see the way they were looking at each other? They'll be back together before summer's over.""

""Want to bet on it?""

""Loser has to clean both our rooms for a month?""

""Deal.""

As they sealed their bet with a handshake, both girls knew that regardless of who won, they'd already gotten the best prize possible – a chance to be a family again, all four of them.

And if their parents needed a few more nudges along the way? Well, that's what daughters were for.

Especially twin daughters with a talent for schemes and a determination to see love triumph in the end.

After all, they were their parents' children – experts in both real and pretend, in love and persistence, in never giving up on what matters most.

I used to really enjoy the feeling of receiving handwritten letters in the post when I was younger, and I've decided that in 2025 I would like to get back into the habit of sending and receiving letters to friends around the world.

  
I'm a 29 year old woman who works in the public sector, and in my free time I like to keep busy with a wide and seemingly ever-growing list of hobbies - I do a lot of travelling and hiking, I enjoy taking photos, writing (poetry in particular), swimming, playing and watching sports, cooking, food, and meeting people over coffee... I like to spend my time out in the world, usually alone in nature but sometimes in the middle of the crowd.

  
I really enjoy getting to know new people and hearing about their lives and experiences: the ways they're similar to mine, and the ways they're totally different. I've had a longtime interest in Asian cultures, languages, and histories, and would love to hear from anyone from Asia or with connections to Asia, although of course anyone anywhere is welcome to send me a message.

  
If you can write in Japanese  日本語 or in Chinese 中文, I'd like to send letters in these languages, and there's a few other languages I've learned a little of - Vietnamese, Indonesian, Persian, Dzongkha, to name a few. If you speak another language, especially an Asian one, try me and see!

  
I look forward to hearing from you, I'm more of a writer than anything else, so I enjoy interesting letters that flow, but I do like to put little drawings in mine every now and then, and I'll probably send some photos from my travels as well. I get quite busy and international postage is expensive, so I'd be hoping to send a letter maybe every 2-3 months or so.

  
Please send me a message if you'd be interested in corresponding with me, and wishing you all lots of happiness and prosperity in 2025!!",1,1735741191.0,penpals,1,1.0,False

Additionally, if I’m going to try something, I’ve never tried before. I don’t want to try three at once because then I won’t know which one I like over the other.

I think using tea is interesting.  I also prefer it to juice because I like to eat, rather than drink, my calories.  (Not a smoothie fan)

I also want something that a kid may not like- sour, bitter, smoky flavors rather than sweet. 

Besides the usual assortment of tea, I always have hibiscus.  Just got some hibiscus berry, and was gifted a bag of “holiday German gingerbread black tea”

I also really like rooibos.

Inspired by a similar, but about coffee.

Let’s take a look at alcohol as a consumable product. The taste? Definitely an acquired one. Someone will say, “You just haven’t tried good wine.” Okay, guys, chill, I’m not coming for you. The smell of booze on someone’s breath—absolute nightmare. High in calories. If you go for something lighter than 40% vodka, you’ll end up running to pee 300 times. My country may have figured out how to cater to various needs, but not for chronic pee-takers. If you decide to go for a stroll with a group and alcohol, your route will basically depend on how every 10 minutes someone starts whining that they’re about to piss themselves. (And at that point, you should probably listen to them.) So, you’ll end up visiting all kinds of places—from fancy restaurants where you try to sneak into the bathrooms unnoticed, collecting judgmental stares from the staff, to sketchy diners that charge you a euro each to use the loo, and those bio-toilets that smell like someone died in there.

The cult of alcohol. Supermarkets have hundreds of alcoholic beverages on display. Cows and goats are resting easy. A smug vegan claps in the background. Whiskey or wine? The choice of a refined and/or lonely man/woman (hopefully without a child lurking somewhere in the background). Champagne? Celebration. Nature? Beer or cider. There’s something for every type of personality, social status, and lifestyle. Try finding a single movie where alcohol doesn’t appear in some form. I’m not even talking about brand ads—I mean casually flaunting the act of drinking. Oh, and let’s not forget the glassware industry. I see, drinking wine from a cup isn’t exactly “proper,” huh?

Speaking of kids. Even in the healthiest families, a child sees their loved ones hugging glasses at celebrations. Beloved dads offer beer foam to taste and sneak in a sip. By 14, the little rascal is already being poured half a glass “for company” and grimacing as they try to pretend it’s their first time. Which brings me to the cherry on top. Where I live, the sale of light alcohol (technically up to 10%, but in reality, it depends on the cashier’s mood—sometimes up to 25%) is allowed from the age of 16. Let me repeat: 16. You’ll say kids are going to drink anyway, so at least it’s not vodka behind garages.

I had my first drink at 15 and thought it was a cool idea to base my whole personality around it. But here’s the catch: the kiosk that sold it to me was a 30-minute trip away, and one out of five sellers wouldn’t sell to me. My heart would race every time I went there. The other four would smirk at me, which made me uncomfortable too. And as you said, I had to mix vodka with Sprite because the kiosk had fewer options than I had years back then. The taste of that mix was hellish. As you can guess, I didn’t go there that often. (Roughly once a week. Haha, yeah, keep reading.)

Fast forward to midnight, I’m 16. Six months in, I was drinking 3–4 times a week, and my friend—whom I always convinced to drink with me because I genuinely believed it was the only way to maintain and deepen our friendship—had developed Stage 2 alcohol dependency. True besties have a ""mental connection."" For instance, we used to faint in sync after drinking.

It all ended in a happy ending, if you can call it that, because we’ll never be able to be “friends” with alcohol again. The further I distance myself from that experience, the more it terrifies me. I’m scared to death of it.

And then I show up at parties, politely refusing a glass, only to hear a joke like, “What’s next? Gonna turn vegan?” Guys, I quit a dr*g that almost destroyed not just my life but the life of the person I love most. (The post turned out kind of anti-vegan, sorry guys.)

My friend, who spent a week on a trip with her drunk 24/7 father, constantly had to refuse to join him. Yet the cigarettes she smokes once every couple of weeks she has to hide from him to avoid judgment and lectures (She’s of legal age).

Are you guys out of your minds?

P.S.: I do agree that alcohol has its place on the market, absolutely. But I’m outraged by the positions it’s taken in our lives, including on a governmental level. I’m not the kind of person who’ll preach about the dangers of sugar, deodorant, palm oil, and… alcohol. I’m not calling for lifelong sobriety. What I’m calling for is this: for alcohol to be recognized as a dr*g, for stricter restrictions on kids, and for propaganda and romanticization of it to be condemned!

**AITAH For breaking my Number 1 sex rule with a handicapped guy?**

Obviously throwaway, I don’t need anyone here seeing my regular account. Also I’m in the US and English is my first language, any discrepancies are because I suck at typing on my phone.

So TL/DR for the “give me the bare bones, I don’t have all day to read on the shitter” crew: My #1 sex rule since high school has been no sex before the third date. I recently broke that rule with a handicapped guy, and now my childhood best friend is pissed and grossed out because she thinks I have some weird kind of fetish.

Context/full story: I’m a 28f. My childhood best friend we’ll call Jess is also 28f. To put it simply, I don’t think I’m any kind of prude, I just don’t really feel comfortable with casual sex, never have. My best friend knows this and has teased me about it lightly in the past. She’s been in a long term relationship for the last 3 years, I’ve mostly been single while working on my degree and starting my career. Jess lives in another state with her boyfriend, so we don’t hang out much anymore.

So about a month ago I had a first date with a guy I’d been talking to for a bit, thought it was going places, but he gave a WEIRD vibe on the date and I cut and ran early. On my way home I stopped at a local pub, figured I’d have a drink to unwind and people watch till it wore off. (Tipsy driving is still drunk driving IMO.) I get there and it’s pretty packed, Friday night and all, and there was no seating room at the bar. Took my drink and looked around, most of the “restaurant” side of the pub was someone’s birthday party, but there was a small table with a seat open off to the side, with a guy reading a book there. So I say eff it, I’m a social person and what’s the worst thing that happens, he says no? So I ask if I can sit there for a bit, I promise we don’t have to talk or anything.

At this point I feel like I’ve fucked up because this guy up close is the hottest man I have ever seen. But he just smiled at me and gave an enthusiastic “Sure!” A few minutes later of me sipping in silence and he says “I don’t mind talking, if you want to.” (Yeah I want to are you kidding me right now?) We talk for a bit and it turns out Mike (fake name) is 29, just finished his master’s degree in some kind of computer learning field (“I program computers to program computers”) and he’s living on his own for the first time. He apparently stops by the pub after work because he’s right around the corner, and he’s not used to the silence yet after living so long with a half dozen siblings.

We talked for a good two hours, about everything from dating (which he said he’s basically given up on) to hobbies and tastes, and we have a near total eclipse of a venn diagram on this stuff. I eventually sort of blurted out that I don’t know why he’d give up on dating, this is the closest thing I’ve had to a good date in forever. (Shooting my shot obliquely here lol.) He gets kind of an odd look on his face and says “Tell you what, I have to go to the bathroom, but when I come back I’ll ask you out for real.” Weird, but okay?

Then it all clicks, because he doesn’t get up to walk away, he just rolls. In his wheelchair. And I’m thinking “oh my God he wanted to give me a chance to back out of this without making it awkward how cute can this guy BE.” He grinned like crazy when he got back and saw I was still there, and I basically tripped over myself saying something to the effect of “So I’m free all weekend, what did you have in mind?”

Another hour later, we’ve got plans for Saturday, and he told me he has a neuromuscular disorder I can’t remember the name of (my degree isn’t in STEM lol) so his legs work, but the signals from his brain get misinterpreted so he doesn’t have the balance or coordination for walking or standing. The pub starts switching over to the younger/rowdier crowd and he asks if I’d like to go back to his place for coffee to continue our conversation.

As you have probably long since realized, I did not get any coffee or conversation till the next morning and I have ZERO regrets. We’ve been dating since and I know it’s still early but I really feel like this might be the one.

Onward to yesterday afternoon, my friend Jess (remember Jess?) is in town, and we go out for coffee to catch up on things. I’m gushing about Mike, but when I get to how we met she just sort of got weird and edgy. I don’t remember any exact words but she essentially said that I must have a fetish for the handicapped since I broke my #1 rule and it’s the best physical relationship I’ve ever been in. Like it’s good for me because he uses a wheelchair, not because the guy puts in effort in bed??? She said I’ve “changed” as a person and left without even saying goodbye. 15 years of friendship and I’ve never seen her like that.

So here I am, asking the most objective people online (haha) if I’m an asshole or weird for being super attracted to a guy who uses a wheelchair and basically putting out immediately.

*oh fuck that friend. i read this whole thing.*

* *you have 0 fetish.*
* *the guy is hot*
* *the guy is intelligent*
* *the guy lives on his own*
* *the guy has his shit together*
* *THE MAN GAVE YOU THE DOOR TO LEAVE*
* *Love comes in all shapes and sizes.*

>OOP: That shit floored me. He's so considerate in so many ways. His stories about his sibs are also hilarious, I can't wait to meet them. We're trying not to rush things just because it all seems so great, but they have a BBQ in May that he'd like me to come to and I am so there. He was raised around a lot of love and it shows.

**Update - 2 days later**

My first ever update! Yay! Uh, so if you were hoping for some terrible drama, I hate to break it to you that I don’t roll like that. No pun intended. So I do have an update on Jess and shit finally makes perfect sense. And I have a slightly NSFW but funny story about Mike, because this guy is just the best, y’all.

Okay, so first, I finally messaged Jess yesterday and said basically “I’m still hurt by what you said, but after 15 years of friendship I’d never forgive musif I didn’t at least ask why you snapped at me like that.” She replied immediately, “I’m so fucking sorry, I didn’t mean any of that, can we have a do over on lunch?” So I agreed cautiously and took a half day to meet with her today.

Turns out that those of you who said she was jealous, and that she might have something else going on, and especially the person who said something might be going on in HER relationship….. gold stars. She’s in town because she’s job hunting, because she’s moving back in with her parents for a while since her relationship ended. Apparently they have been having a ton of small problems adding up, but the biggest one? Sex. The guy she’s been with was apparently never great but it’s gotten to the point where he makes no effort at all for her to enjoy herself and then gets pissed when she isn’t in the mood.

She tried talking with him about it, making suggestions but he told her recently that it’s “emasculating” being given sex advice by a woman. The straw that broke the metaphorical camel’s back, however, was that her boyfriend has always had a thing for Asian women. She’s caucasian, but she does have long black hair. After weeks of fighting over their sex life, he suggested that they spice things up….by her dressing in a kimono and pretending to be Asian. She lost it on him and is absolutely disgusted by the racist fetishism and ended it right then.

So she had allllll of this bottled up and was hoping to talk to me and finally be able to put it down….. and I missed every hint that she had something big to discuss because I was gushing about Mike. So to her it felt like I was just twisting the knife by bragging about how great our sex was. She snapped, and somewhere between what I was saying and what she wanted to talk about some wires got crossed and she said something incredibly dumb.

She left without saying goodbye because she was mortified and ashamed as well as irrationally mad at me. Something to know about Jess, she’s an awful liar and she and I were the co-founders of our high school’s “foot-in-mouth” society, so I do believe her. I told her I forgive her and I’m sorry I didn’t realize she wanted to talk about something bothering her, and she said I was too stupidly nice and have nothing to apologize for, so I think we’ll be okay. For the time being I’m not ready for her and Mike to meet, because I don’t want to make things feel worse, and she agrees. But she’s really really happy for me. Hopefully this is just a funny story we can look back on someday.

So, on to how Mike almost killed me, lol. Last night we were talking about the reddit post and he gets this funny expression that I’m starting to recognize. And he goes “How do we know you don’t have a fetish if we haven’t at least tried it in the chair?” And I’m like “are you serious lol”. He said he’s never attempted it, because (cue tears) he’s never felt so comfortable with a partner before. Well.

His chair has what is essentially like a parking break thing. Or it should, it’s unfortunately broken and apparently getting them fixed is an expensive pain in the ass. He doesn’t use it that often so he hasn’t made it a priority. And there’s this thing called Newton’s third law, you know how every action has an equal and opposite reaction? As it happens, when you’re trying to, ah, get the motion of the ocean going, in a chair with wheels that aren’t locked, there’s a sort of counter motion that starts and fucks it all up. So we were going nowhere fast except for inching along the floor in his bedroom. And laughing at the silliness, which isn’t helping. Eventually he just stops and says “Maybe we can get some of those wooden block things they use to keep little planes from rolling away, like in Indiana Jones you know?”

I absolutely lost it. Like laughing so hard I’m in tears, he’s giggling half at the situation and half at my reaction, and everything just keeps setting me off again. FINALLY I get it under control, doing some deep breathing exercises and shit, and I look at him again. And he pulls the straightest face he can, and says, for the love of god, “Golly. This sure is uncomfortable.” Folks if I had asthma I would have fucking died right there. I laughed so hard I think I pulled a rib. Like wheezing and not even laughing anymore so much as weeping and making this awful “heeeeee” noise when I could catch my breath. While he’s laughing and rubbing my back and saying he’s sorry, he couldn’t resist.

So yeah, confirmed, no fetish here, and this magnificent bastard’s comedic timing might actually kill me.

I doubt I’ll update again, because there’s really nothing I can see needing to share given everything sort of worked out. And in the end, the real assholes were the….friends we made along the way? Idk. Thanks for all the lovely comments on my last post and for coming along with me on this absurd but brief drama in my life, lol.

**Update - 1 month later**

Hello again! I was going to post this on my own page but a few people mentioned that they think it’s nice to read on AITAH, so fuck it, here’s the “met Mikes family” update. And it's a doozy, or at least felt like it at the time for a girl who grew up with a small, dysfunctional family.

So first up, you know what people (at least me) don’t think about when dating a guy who’s always sitting? Height. I know he’s taller than me because we cuddle a lot, and he’s taller sitting on the couch, but I didn’t reeeeeeally get it. So we drive up Friday night after work (actually south and west, lol, but to my brain it’s always up) in his vehicle, which is modified to be driven entirely using his hands. Neat, right? He’s a really good driver too. One more green flag. We get to the house, and it’s…. It’s huge you guys, LOL like not a mansion, just kind of a sprawling one floor rancher. Real estate was wild back in the day.

Anyway we get out, and I meet his mom. I’d like to point out I am no slouch, I’m 5’-friggin-7. His mom is TOWERING over me. But she was the nicest lady ever. We go inside and I meet his dad (who funny enough is apparently the only short one in this family) and his youngest sister, who is living there with his one year old niece. She gets up to hug me and SHE IS ALSO REALLY TALL. It’s already a bit late then, so we eat and head to bed, I get to see his cute as shit room from when he was a teenager, and I casually ask “hey, so uh, I don’t know how this works and stuff, but how tall are you?” and Mike is all “I dunno, like a bit over 6’4? Been a while since I checked.” A BIT OVER 6’4. “So, is everyone in your family tall?” “…..kinda?”

We met the Nordic Basketball team he calls a family properly the next day. (Actually they’re Irish, but they’re blond and tall so it conveys the idea better.) The ONLY one of reasonable height, and still taller than me, was his oldest sister, lol.

They are also LOUD. Like not really shouting or anything usually, just, PRESENT. Mike is a lot different around them, but in the cutest way, like he just beams all the time and you can see how happy he is to be home. One of his brothers put him in a headlock and gave him a dang NOOGIE as a greeting, and got elbowed in the side for it, and all of them laughing. And his mom smacked one of his brothers with a rolled up magazine for putting his feet on the table. More laughing. Just… intimidating but in the happiest way imaginable. I’ll admit I was a little shut down for a bit, but Mike kept checking in with me to make sure I was okay, and they were all really nice, so I got into the spirit after a bit.

I mentioned this in another comment, but Mike has a special sports wheelchair he uses for, well, sports. And he and his siblings play basketball. And he is GOOD. Apart from just having a hell of an arm, he’s quick as hell. And this magnificent bastard that I love will absolutely, purposefully, GLEEFULLY run someone’s toes over. He AIMS for it. They all have this yank-back-the-foot maneuver that’s hysterical to watch.

So it was this crazy day of loud people playing and having a blast, nieces and nephews running around, and just noise. My ears are still ringing. The food was catered in advance because his mom “had seven babies, all I make on mother’s day is margaritas.” They also have a pool, it’s a bit chilly still but the pool is HEATED so we actually all got to swim, which was a lot of fun because I got to show off that I too am athletic…. I can do a backwards somersault off a diving board! Yeah. I’m a real catch lol. They at least pretended to be impressed.

We all stayed up late drinking and bitching that it was too overcast to see the aurora (boo) and I had the worst hangover I’ve had in a while on Sunday. We slept in a bit late, and then joined Mike’s family for the BBQ part of the BBQ weekend. His dad can GRILL, people. And he’s fast, food coming off the grill at lightning speed. I asked Mike about it and he laughed and said “there was seven of us to feed. Ever see a nest of baby birds? He had practice.” Which, fair enough.

I don’t have much experience with babies, but I got to hold his youngest niece (the one living at home with his sis until her husband gets back from deployment) and we had a light talk about kids in the future. I told him that I never put much thought into it but if they were going to grow up in a happy home like his and not how I grew up, I’m pretty sure I’d be open to having them with him someday. But later. I need him all to myself for a while first. He seemed really really happy about that, which makes ME feel all goofy and happy. I’m sappy.

We had to drive home Sunday night, but before we went his mom hugged me and said she’s NEVER seen her son like this, and thanked me for taking good care of her baby. And asked if we’d be back for the 4th of July or if we were doing something with my family. And I tried to be all “haaaa no we’ll be here if you don’t mind, I don’t see them much” and I think she caught on that there’s more to the story so she just hugged the shit out of me (vikings, all of them I swear) and told me she can’t wait to see me again.

My ears are still ringing from all the noise and chaos, but it was an absolute blast and I can’t wait to see them again in July. Also, pretty much sure Mike is the man I’m going to marry. I literally can’t think of a single reason why I would ever let him get away.

Anyway thanks for reading, hope you all had a lovely weekend, and those of you who got to see the aurora I’m happy for you but you suck, lol.

**UPDATE (again) Dating a disabled guy: 4th of July**

As I’ve gotten a ton of requests for updates, I figured I would let you guys know how things are going in my world. You know how sometimes a relationship looks amazing at first but then all the red flags start showing up?

This isn’t one of those stories, lol.

Sorry, that was mean, but I couldn’t resist. Okay, on to the actual update! No we aren’t engaged yet. Yes we have talked about it in the context of how seriously we are taking things. No babies yet either obviously, we are diligent about birth control. I want Mike all to myself for a while.

So, the 4th of July visit to his family’s house was pretty awesome. After getting to know everyone last time I had better expectations of what I was going into, and I’ve talked with my therapist about the whole “play fighting makes me anxious because in my childhood home it wasn’t playing” thing. I don’t want them to ever curb how they act to cater to me, and instead I guess I’ll consider it immersion therapy. I think Mike mentioned it anyway because I didn’t see much of it this time, though there were cheerful threats of doom lobbed about which I didn’t mind at all.

His mom is amazing, I’d like to point out. Even if she moms so hard it makes me weepy. So, background info: I have a really common sounding name spelled REALLY uncommonly. Think Danyell or Jessikah. Because in addition to everything else my parents decided to be creative when they named me. So, although I do sort of like my name, that meant I was that kid who never saw their name personalized on anything. Mike’s family, on the other hand, had like a million kids and they all got traditional names, so personalized stuff was huge for them (it kept them from fighting over stuff I guess.) One of the things in their house, because they have a pool, is that each of the kids (adults now) has their own personalized beach towel that lives at the house.

So we get to their place and it’s been a hot drive there, so right after we get in Mike suggests I go to his room to get changed into a swimsuit so we can have a dip in the pool. I’m thinking that sounds perfect, right? Some of you may already know where this is going…. I get to his room and there is a towel on the bed. In my favorite color. With my fucking stupid-ass-spelled name embroidered into it. So here I am crying over a goddamn towel and he’s in the doorway watching and grinning like he just pranked me or some shit. Turns out it was HER idea but she checked with Mike to make sure it was spelled right. So now I have a towel for when we visit because APPARENTLY I’m welcome.

If I sound cranky it’s just because I’m better at self-depreciation than I am expressing emotions in a direct way. I really am blown away and touched by how much these people have welcomed me. Mike has already sort of learned to decode the way I talk and joke, which is nice, but the first time he gently said “that’s not humor, that’s just putting yourself down, babe,” I definitely wanted to go hide under the table. He doesn’t let me be mean to me. That’s a thing good partners do, I guess? I wouldn’t know. (Again, yes I am in therapy, I am working on myself, it’s not his responsibility to put me back together, it’s just something he does naturally.) I literally told him one night that I was sorry I’m kind of broken, and he snorted and said “at least you can walk” in the most disgusted voice ever and made me laugh.

I digress. So the food was once again amazing, and I kept my promise to teach his mom how to make my cinnamon bun bread pudding, so I felt like I contributed. (Insert Ralph Wiggum “I’m Helping!” meme.) I learned to play Yahtzee, and as it turns out I am very good at it. They do a lot of board games things at night when everyone is staying for the week. These people have a LOT of board games. And puzzles. Whole damn storage closet of the things. They also drink like fuckin FISH and can hold it so I am learning to pace myself. Mike doesn’t drink much when we aren’t there so I’m not worried that it’s a red flag. Only red flag of his that I’ve found was a Red Sox pennant in his room.

Now I realize I might be talking him up a lot, but he isn’t perfect! He snores, he has a habit of arguing with people on the TV when they make stupid decisions, he sometimes starts talking about things I don’t understand and just goes and goes until he realizes he lost me like 15 minutes ago, and he is FASTIDIOUSLY tidy, which makes me feel guilty because I have bad habits to lose. I’m not used to “clutter means I can’t move through an area” but I’m really trying. I barely spend any time at my own place anymore, and we’re definitely looking to move in together sooner than later.

Yeah, so, not that much of an update, no one burned themselves on a firework or anything super exciting, I’m just in an ongoing relationship with a great guy who has a great family and things continue to look up for us. We head home tonight so we can spend some alone time Sunday. Hope everyone else had a safe and happy holiday!

**UPDATE: Dating a disabled guy yes it's me again - 4 weeks later**

I debated just posting this on my own page, but shit , like a lot of people keep asking for more so I guess it doesn’t hurt to drop my post between “AITAH for literally killing someone” and “AITAH for meekly accepting my inlaw’s cruelty but asking if I may wash my wounds before they flog me again.”

This is not an exciting update. Not engaged. No babies on the way, not even freakishly tall ones like some of you are hexing me with. But…. Jess finally met Mike.

TLDR: Learning to read long posts is good for your attention span.

SORRY! I mean I’m not sorry, I feel compelled to open with a joke and I don’t know why. Anyway real TLDR she thinks he’s amazing, she thinks it is HYSTERICAL that I’m on tictok (I refuse to download it) and she is doing amazing. And our lives are moving forward together.

Jess and I have this friend, who I will call Meg and NOT TALULAH despite both Jess and Mike thinking would be hilarious. Meg was planning to have a birthday party, the big THREE OH, and she and Jess are close (and both presently single.) They chose a local bar with outside seating, and Jess did a “wait, lets check their accessibility” because I have been bitching to her for the last month. And lol and be-fucking-hold after calling the place, they didn’t have a ramp for the balcony/outside seating area.

As I have been told Jess said “nope I am meeting Mr. Throwra\_JessComeOn” and so they found another place that’s a damn hike from everyone. But it has a great outside area with accessibility. And THEN we got the invite. Through Facebook because we are all basic, I guess? And Mike was stoked because they have this awesome beer selection (full stop I hate hops sooooo). Then Meg told us that (no I am not using Talulah for the 15% of you going “oh but that was such a better name”) they chose it because Jess wanted Mike to feel welcome. So hats off to Jess for making the comeback impression of the century, I guess.

The birthday was fun, and silly, and everyone in my immediate friend group met Mike and loved him. Tons of laughter, everyone drank way too much, but fortunately we had enough heads up for a planned motel stay (why yes, I do own a UV flashlight, why do you ask?) so we and a bunch of other people didn’t drive home. We actually had brunch in the bar the next day, it was absolutely awesome and I am ruined for pancakes because FLUFFY.

Once again, I digress.

Jess and Mike hit it off and she told him literally every story I didn’t want her to over brunch, and it all was great apart from the persistent hangover. I crashed at Mike’s again. Annnnnnd then he asked what it would cost to break my lease, because he hates the mornings he wakes up and I’m not there. So the next upcoming week and a half or so is going to be insane while I pack up my whole damn life and shove half into a storage unit and the other half into his apartment, and then we’ll be living together.

I know it’s too soon. He does too. We’ve decided we’re idiots and just going for it. My landlord is a lady who is a bit on the older side and isn’t charging me for breaking the lease as long as I leave the place ready for a new renter, so I may respond to comments for a bit right away but expect a lot of silence for a while after.

True TLDR: Best friend made a good second impression, and I’m moving in with Mike ahead of schedule. I should be worried but I’m actually just really excited. Wish me luck!!

**UPDATE: Dating a disabled guy and this headline gets more and more awkward so probably “Dating Mike with the Wheels” from now on - 7 weeks later**

Hey! I get a LOT of messages asking how things are going, but I kinda HATE when people update every five minutes with the “my neighbor looked at me sideways” updates after three paragraphs of recapping drama.

So for those not invested:

Still with Mike. He’s amazing. I will marry him.

We live together now! It’s been trying. As in he is trying not to laugh at how inept I am at cohabitation. I am really good at not leaving stuff out, now, so there’s improvement. He doesn’t infantilize (oOOooO reddit big brain word) me at all but he definitely gives me the grace due an absolute idiot. I appreciate it.

We are not engaged (guys it’s been half a year, come on.)

I’m writing a book about our relationship. It starts with “My name is” and the rest is just notes. Don’t hold your breath.

Jess moved into my old apartment. Yes, my former landlord is the GOAT. Jess is also seeing a guy. I think it is too soon. She agrees. But she has “reasons” (girl we all have needs) and who am I to judge.

Aaaaand I was recently in kind of a serious car accident. I am fine, I have great health insurance, great car insurance, and am recovering just fine. No go funds here, though if you want to help just find a reputable charity for helping victims of drunk drivers and give them your money. So I was on my way home from working overtime and some dude clipped my car and I ended up in a ditch while he just sort of spun out….. but I wear my seatbelt because I have a brain and I got really, really lucky.

Everything is fine, my medical deductible was already paid up for the year, and the worst I had was some bruises, a cracked femur fibula, whiplash, and a totaled car. The silver lining is that Mike is GREAT at caretaking? Another check mark in the having kids category. Also his mom brought us like a million home made frozen dinners in Costco serving trays and we had nowhere to put them so she bought us a fucking chest freezer. I….. guys I don’t even know with this family. They are amazing.

I know usually I give some sweet, heartwarming updates while bitching about mental health, but I am pretty well medicated until my leg heals and I have a few weeks off work to cuddle Mike while watching bad sci-fi, so I’m not in the best place to fill your cups. Sorry. Also don’t watch “Another Life” on Netflix unless you have the ability to set your brain aside because it is the least consistent show I have ever seen. I mean I loved it especially the spine ripping itself out of a person and trying to walk away OH MY GOD but it requires suspension of disbelief like few things I have encountered in all my years.

Also Mike says hi. He indulges meeeee.

Have a good autumn and please for the love of heck don’t drive drunk.

And don’t expect anything from me unless the Thanksgiving gathering is as epic as they claim (ahahaha I almost slipped and said his last name. No doxxing for you today!) because reddit is probably already over my shit.

As always, love you guys for all the support, I’m okay, relationship is fab, and please don’t drink and drive.

Edit: I don't have a cracked femur. Jesus crackers these meds are something. I have a fractured fibula (lower leg, outside bone) and it didn't break all the way through. I have no idea how I mixed those two up. Mike says at least I'm cute when I'm high, but he is clearly biased. So yeah. Cracked fibula, little leg bone, short(ish) healing time. Not femur thank fuck.

**Comments**

**StormyDye**

*I've been here since your first post, and im still so happy for you. Everyone deserves an amazing loving relationship, and I'm glad you have that. Enjoy all the Thanksgiving food!!*

>OOP: It really isn't too bad. I didn't BREAK my leg thankfully. I got super lucky. It'll be a good while before I am cleared to run again but I literally got to go home the same night I got taken to the hospital, so I'm calling it a win.

**\*\*New Updates\*\***

**Unimportant update: Saw the northern lights!!!! - 2 weeks later**

*Missed them months ago but we got an alert they were visible tonight and we drove out to the closest low light area. PRETTY! I'm still on leave but Mike took time off for tomorrow so we can sleep in and watch this as much as we can. I know it's silly but damn I am so happy.*

**UPDATE: Dating Mike with the wheels, belated Thanksgiving and Christmas updates - 2.5 months later**

Hello, reddit friends! It’s been a minute, right? Sorry about that. There’s been a lot of very real life stuff that intersected with the holiday, so I haven’t had the best time to make an update. Thanks for asking so much though, I feel the support! First thing, Mike and I are great. Coming up on a year if you can believe it!

Out of respect, (not Mike’s family!!) I’ll put a trigger warning here about parental death/trauma/etc.

I had a Thanksgiving post in my notes almost fully written when unfortunately I got the call. I’ve mentioned before that I had kind of a rough upbringing and have been estranged from my parents for a few years, but they were still my parents, you know? So anyhow my mother passed away the day after Thanksgiving. (Natural causes, she just neglected her health in general.) I hadn’t talked to her since a half hearted attempt last Christmas, she didn’t even know about Mike. And I don’t know if I even feel sad, exactly, but it knocked me for a loop and writing about how great Mike’s family is left a bad taste in my mouth. My therapist says I (paraphrasing here) already mourned the loss of the good parts of my mom when I started processing the bad parts, so my reaction isn’t abnormal. For once.

But it wasn’t the easiest time, and then the funeral meant a whole lot of people I never wanted to see again. Mike was a godsend, he’s so charismatic and charming that no one had anything bad to say to me, it was more like a room of acquaintances. I’m so glad we moved in together, I don’t know how I would have gotten through it and then gone home alone.

So…. I’m going to do this a little out of order. Mike and I spent the whole Christmas week with his parents again, and they were very sympathetic and understanding in the “we respect that you don’t want us to make a big deal” way. Most of his family wasn’t there except for dinner the day after Christmas (just wait till the Thanksgiving recap and you’ll understand why Christmas is so low key, no one could handle that twice in two months.) So it was nice to wake up and feel like family and open presents in my pajamas. Mike and I have matching Christmas ones now. We are ridiculous together, and I love it. Also, it was a white Christmas for the first time in years!!

To those hoping for a proposal….. I did get jewelry! But not a ring. Sorry! Believe me it’s on the table and where we feel we are headed, but we’re not rushing things. Also given everything going on, it wouldn’t have been the right time. But I got a lovely pendant with my birthstone and real diamonds, so I was very spoiled.

Christmas dinner was good and catered, and a lot of chaos and kids and presents, and I missed most of it because I had a pretty bad headache and it was just a LOT at once. But I was there for pictures, and everyone kind of accepts that I’m the future wife even without a ring, so I feel nice and included.

Sorry that this update is on a bit of a downer note, I know I don’t really sound like my usual upbeat self, but I’ll get back there once the holidays, seasonal depression, and STUFF is behind me. That’s why I saved my Thanksgiving post for the end, to hopefully go out on a high note.

The Thanksgiving recap:

Hi all! I get a lot of requests for updates, so I thought I’d share how things are going, now that gluttony day is behind us. Mike and I are happily cohabitating still, things are well on most fronts. I had a minor car accident a little while ago (I posted on my page about it) but I’m mostly healed up now. Mike’s family is still the absolute best, and honestly his mom is more motherly than mine has ever been. Sucks, but it is what it is. (See? That line right there, ouch.)

I’d been warned that Thanksgiving is sort of their BIG holiday, since a lot of the family spends time elsewhere on Christmas. And that it’s a bit of a spectacle. But Lord Almighty I was not prepared for this shit. So, things you need to know: there is some weird “battle of the sexes” thing they do. A few years ago Mike’s mom pointed out that the family kept getting bigger and it was harder to make enough turkey for everyone. So the kids got together (and everyone takes credit for the idea) and bought their dad one of those turkey deep fryers for Christmas. So Thanksgiving rolls around again (I so wish I’d met Mike sooner to see it myself) and thanks to the combination of beer and “I’m sure we can figure this out” ….apparently their dad set fire to the lawn. At least no one was hurt, apart from pride. But after that there was sober practice, and now mom’s turkey vs dad’s turkey is this whole THING. Like there is literally shit talk the whole day. People are set up into camps.

I joked we needed team shirts and I think they actually want to do that next year.

It was all pretty hilarious and casual, and they had like three damn tables set up. Don’t worry, reddit! I made sure no teenagers were being parentified or unliked inlaws were being forced to sit at the kids table. (Actually I was low-key jealous, they got crayons and coloring books.) The food was all amazing and all hands on deck except for me because his mom refused to have me on my feet even though my leg is basically fine now. Mike kept bringing me stuff, it was so cute y’all. I can’t even put into words how much golden retriever energy this boy has.

If you’re wondering who made the better turkey? Ooh man it’s hard. Mike’s mom does a brine (Alton Brown is the GOAT) but there is something about fried turkey skin that is just next level. So I’d say it’s a tie, and that’s not just me being diplomatic. I ate so much that I barely had room for dessert. It was fantastic. I never fall asleep in the car, but I was passed out on the drive home. We had kind of a second Thanksgiving at home the next day from the leftovers, and I probably just put on 50 pounds. No ragrets.

Anyway I’m off to sleep the bird off, I hope you all had a wonderful turkey day and a great Christmas coming up!

End recap.

So there you have it. I’m okay, we’re okay, and I’m looking forward to 2025 being even better than 2024. Happy News Years and I wish you all the best!!

But I think I’ve developed a crush on one of my guy friends. We’ve known each other for 6 ish months so far, we’ve got very similar values, and we get along super well. It recently occurred to me that could see myself dating him and I wanted to know if he’d ever even consider dating me. We’ve briefly talked about each other’s dating history, and exes, from what I gathered he’s ready to move on but might need to get therapy. 
One of our mutuals is a close friend of mine and when I  talked to her about it, she said he might not know I’m interested since we’ve never flirted. He’s a very respectful and kind person who goes above and beyond to make sure women safe which I really appreciate. But I think to the point where he wouldn’t make a move unless it was very clear I was interested. 
That being said, had I flirted with him, I don’t think he’d pick up on it. He’s somewhat oblivious and very much on the spectrum. So, I thought it’s best to flat out ask him(which terrifies me)
we recently had brunch since we both happened to be visiting another city during the holidays. It was really nice, and probably one of the few times we’ve had extensive time alone together. I also started to realize that I do really like him. So, at the very least minute, I told him “I actually wanted to ask you a question, would you ever considered anything beyond friendship between us” and he answered almost immediately “yes” I was taken aback and he said it again. I think I said “that’s good to know” before following up with “but I’m a bit wary of dating within friend groups” and he agreed. Then his Uber pulled up, he looked at me and said “now it’s weird because I don’t know what to do with my hands” and I leaned in for a hug. He left and I went to a coffee shop next door. Initially I was super happy about the outcome, but since then we briefly chatted about work and the convo trailed off. We never really acknowledged the convo after brunch or anything else. 

In my head I thought I gave him a green light but is there a world in which he’d think he got rejected? I want to ask for clarification but don’t want to be the one to initiate again, I just feel like I’m showing my ass right now.",0,1735741032.0,AskMenAdvice,13,0.5,False

**AITAH For breaking my Number 1 sex rule with a handicapped guy?**



Obviously throwaway, I don’t need anyone here seeing my regular account. Also I’m in the US and English is my first language, any discrepancies are because I suck at typing on my phone.

So TL/DR for the “give me the bare bones, I don’t have all day to read on the shitter” crew: My #1 sex rule since high school has been no sex before the third date. I recently broke that rule with a handicapped guy, and now my childhood best friend is pissed and grossed out because she thinks I have some weird kind of fetish.

Context/full story: I’m a 28f. My childhood best friend we’ll call Jess is also 28f. To put it simply, I don’t think I’m any kind of prude, I just don’t really feel comfortable with casual sex, never have. My best friend knows this and has teased me about it lightly in the past. She’s been in a long term relationship for the last 3 years, I’ve mostly been single while working on my degree and starting my career. Jess lives in another state with her boyfriend, so we don’t hang out much anymore.

So about a month ago I had a first date with a guy I’d been talking to for a bit, thought it was going places, but he gave a WEIRD vibe on the date and I cut and ran early. On my way home I stopped at a local pub, figured I’d have a drink to unwind and people watch till it wore off. (Tipsy driving is still drunk driving IMO.) I get there and it’s pretty packed, Friday night and all, and there was no seating room at the bar. Took my drink and looked around, most of the “restaurant” side of the pub was someone’s birthday party, but there was a small table with a seat open off to the side, with a guy reading a book there. So I say eff it, I’m a social person and what’s the worst thing that happens, he says no? So I ask if I can sit there for a bit, I promise we don’t have to talk or anything.

At this point I feel like I’ve fucked up because this guy up close is the hottest man I have ever seen. But he just smiled at me and gave an enthusiastic “Sure!” A few minutes later of me sipping in silence and he says “I don’t mind talking, if you want to.” (Yeah I want to are you kidding me right now?) We talk for a bit and it turns out Mike (fake name) is 29, just finished his master’s degree in some kind of computer learning field (“I program computers to program computers”) and he’s living on his own for the first time. He apparently stops by the pub after work because he’s right around the corner, and he’s not used to the silence yet after living so long with a half dozen siblings.

We talked for a good two hours, about everything from dating (which he said he’s basically given up on) to hobbies and tastes, and we have a near total eclipse of a venn diagram on this stuff. I eventually sort of blurted out that I don’t know why he’d give up on dating, this is the closest thing I’ve had to a good date in forever. (Shooting my shot obliquely here lol.) He gets kind of an odd look on his face and says “Tell you what, I have to go to the bathroom, but when I come back I’ll ask you out for real.” Weird, but okay?

Then it all clicks, because he doesn’t get up to walk away, he just rolls. In his wheelchair. And I’m thinking “oh my God he wanted to give me a chance to back out of this without making it awkward how cute can this guy BE.” He grinned like crazy when he got back and saw I was still there, and I basically tripped over myself saying something to the effect of “So I’m free all weekend, what did you have in mind?”

Another hour later, we’ve got plans for Saturday, and he told me he has a neuromuscular disorder I can’t remember the name of (my degree isn’t in STEM lol) so his legs work, but the signals from his brain get misinterpreted so he doesn’t have the balance or coordination for walking or standing. The pub starts switching over to the younger/rowdier crowd and he asks if I’d like to go back to his place for coffee to continue our conversation.

As you have probably long since realized, I did not get any coffee or conversation till the next morning and I have ZERO regrets. We’ve been dating since and I know it’s still early but I really feel like this might be the one.

Onward to yesterday afternoon, my friend Jess (remember Jess?) is in town, and we go out for coffee to catch up on things. I’m gushing about Mike, but when I get to how we met she just sort of got weird and edgy. I don’t remember any exact words but she essentially said that I must have a fetish for the handicapped since I broke my #1 rule and it’s the best physical relationship I’ve ever been in. Like it’s good for me because he uses a wheelchair, not because the guy puts in effort in bed??? She said I’ve “changed” as a person and left without even saying goodbye. 15 years of friendship and I’ve never seen her like that.

So here I am, asking the most objective people online (haha) if I’m an asshole or weird for being super attracted to a guy who uses a wheelchair and basically putting out immediately.

>OOP: That shit floored me. He's so considerate in so many ways. His stories about his sibs are also hilarious, I can't wait to meet them. We're trying not to rush things just because it all seems so great, but they have a BBQ in May that he'd like me to come to and I am so there. He was raised around a lot of love and it shows.



**Update - 2 days later**



My first ever update! Yay! Uh, so if you were hoping for some terrible drama, I hate to break it to you that I don’t roll like that. No pun intended. So I do have an update on Jess and shit finally makes perfect sense. And I have a slightly NSFW but funny story about Mike, because this guy is just the best, y’all.

Okay, so first, I finally messaged Jess yesterday and said basically “I’m still hurt by what you said, but after 15 years of friendship I’d never forgive musif I didn’t at least ask why you snapped at me like that.” She replied immediately, “I’m so fucking sorry, I didn’t mean any of that, can we have a do over on lunch?” So I agreed cautiously and took a half day to meet with her today.

Turns out that those of you who said she was jealous, and that she might have something else going on, and especially the person who said something might be going on in HER relationship….. gold stars. She’s in town because she’s job hunting, because she’s moving back in with her parents for a while since her relationship ended. Apparently they have been having a ton of small problems adding up, but the biggest one? Sex. The guy she’s been with was apparently never great but it’s gotten to the point where he makes no effort at all for her to enjoy herself and then gets pissed when she isn’t in the mood.

She tried talking with him about it, making suggestions but he told her recently that it’s “emasculating” being given sex advice by a woman. The straw that broke the metaphorical camel’s back, however, was that her boyfriend has always had a thing for Asian women. She’s caucasian, but she does have long black hair. After weeks of fighting over their sex life, he suggested that they spice things up….by her dressing in a kimono and pretending to be Asian. She lost it on him and is absolutely disgusted by the racist fetishism and ended it right then.

So she had allllll of this bottled up and was hoping to talk to me and finally be able to put it down….. and I missed every hint that she had something big to discuss because I was gushing about Mike. So to her it felt like I was just twisting the knife by bragging about how great our sex was. She snapped, and somewhere between what I was saying and what she wanted to talk about some wires got crossed and she said something incredibly dumb.

She left without saying goodbye because she was mortified and ashamed as well as irrationally mad at me. Something to know about Jess, she’s an awful liar and she and I were the co-founders of our high school’s “foot-in-mouth” society, so I do believe her. I told her I forgive her and I’m sorry I didn’t realize she wanted to talk about something bothering her, and she said I was too stupidly nice and have nothing to apologize for, so I think we’ll be okay. For the time being I’m not ready for her and Mike to meet, because I don’t want to make things feel worse, and she agrees. But she’s really really happy for me. Hopefully this is just a funny story we can look back on someday.

So, on to how Mike almost killed me, lol. Last night we were talking about the reddit post and he gets this funny expression that I’m starting to recognize. And he goes “How do we know you don’t have a fetish if we haven’t at least tried it in the chair?” And I’m like “are you serious lol”. He said he’s never attempted it, because (cue tears) he’s never felt so comfortable with a partner before. Well.

His chair has what is essentially like a parking break thing. Or it should, it’s unfortunately broken and apparently getting them fixed is an expensive pain in the ass. He doesn’t use it that often so he hasn’t made it a priority. And there’s this thing called Newton’s third law, you know how every action has an equal and opposite reaction? As it happens, when you’re trying to, ah, get the motion of the ocean going, in a chair with wheels that aren’t locked, there’s a sort of counter motion that starts and fucks it all up. So we were going nowhere fast except for inching along the floor in his bedroom. And laughing at the silliness, which isn’t helping. Eventually he just stops and says “Maybe we can get some of those wooden block things they use to keep little planes from rolling away, like in Indiana Jones you know?”

I absolutely lost it. Like laughing so hard I’m in tears, he’s giggling half at the situation and half at my reaction, and everything just keeps setting me off again. FINALLY I get it under control, doing some deep breathing exercises and shit, and I look at him again. And he pulls the straightest face he can, and says, for the love of god, “Golly. This sure is uncomfortable.” Folks if I had asthma I would have fucking died right there. I laughed so hard I think I pulled a rib. Like wheezing and not even laughing anymore so much as weeping and making this awful “heeeeee” noise when I could catch my breath. While he’s laughing and rubbing my back and saying he’s sorry, he couldn’t resist.

So yeah, confirmed, no fetish here, and this magnificent bastard’s comedic timing might actually kill me.

I doubt I’ll update again, because there’s really nothing I can see needing to share given everything sort of worked out. And in the end, the real assholes were the….friends we made along the way? Idk. Thanks for all the lovely comments on my last post and for coming along with me on this absurd but brief drama in my life, lol.



**Update - 1 month later**



Hello again! I was going to post this on my own page but a few people mentioned that they think it’s nice to read on AITAH, so fuck it, here’s the “met Mikes family” update. And it's a doozy, or at least felt like it at the time for a girl who grew up with a small, dysfunctional family.

So first up, you know what people (at least me) don’t think about when dating a guy who’s always sitting? Height. I know he’s taller than me because we cuddle a lot, and he’s taller sitting on the couch, but I didn’t reeeeeeally get it. So we drive up Friday night after work (actually south and west, lol, but to my brain it’s always up) in his vehicle, which is modified to be driven entirely using his hands. Neat, right? He’s a really good driver too. One more green flag. We get to the house, and it’s…. It’s huge you guys, LOL like not a mansion, just kind of a sprawling one floor rancher. Real estate was wild back in the day.

Anyway we get out, and I meet his mom. I’d like to point out I am no slouch, I’m 5’-friggin-7. His mom is TOWERING over me. But she was the nicest lady ever. We go inside and I meet his dad (who funny enough is apparently the only short one in this family) and his youngest sister, who is living there with his one year old niece. She gets up to hug me and SHE IS ALSO REALLY TALL. It’s already a bit late then, so we eat and head to bed, I get to see his cute as shit room from when he was a teenager, and I casually ask “hey, so uh, I don’t know how this works and stuff, but how tall are you?” and Mike is all “I dunno, like a bit over 6’4? Been a while since I checked.” A BIT OVER 6’4. “So, is everyone in your family tall?” “…..kinda?”

We met the Nordic Basketball team he calls a family properly the next day. (Actually they’re Irish, but they’re blond and tall so it conveys the idea better.) The ONLY one of reasonable height, and still taller than me, was his oldest sister, lol.

They are also LOUD. Like not really shouting or anything usually, just, PRESENT. Mike is a lot different around them, but in the cutest way, like he just beams all the time and you can see how happy he is to be home. One of his brothers put him in a headlock and gave him a dang NOOGIE as a greeting, and got elbowed in the side for it, and all of them laughing. And his mom smacked one of his brothers with a rolled up magazine for putting his feet on the table. More laughing. Just… intimidating but in the happiest way imaginable. I’ll admit I was a little shut down for a bit, but Mike kept checking in with me to make sure I was okay, and they were all really nice, so I got into the spirit after a bit.

I mentioned this in another comment, but Mike has a special sports wheelchair he uses for, well, sports. And he and his siblings play basketball. And he is GOOD. Apart from just having a hell of an arm, he’s quick as hell. And this magnificent bastard that I love will absolutely, purposefully, GLEEFULLY run someone’s toes over. He AIMS for it. They all have this yank-back-the-foot maneuver that’s hysterical to watch.

So it was this crazy day of loud people playing and having a blast, nieces and nephews running around, and just noise. My ears are still ringing. The food was catered in advance because his mom “had seven babies, all I make on mother’s day is margaritas.” They also have a pool, it’s a bit chilly still but the pool is HEATED so we actually all got to swim, which was a lot of fun because I got to show off that I too am athletic…. I can do a backwards somersault off a diving board! Yeah. I’m a real catch lol. They at least pretended to be impressed.

We all stayed up late drinking and bitching that it was too overcast to see the aurora (boo) and I had the worst hangover I’ve had in a while on Sunday. We slept in a bit late, and then joined Mike’s family for the BBQ part of the BBQ weekend. His dad can GRILL, people. And he’s fast, food coming off the grill at lightning speed. I asked Mike about it and he laughed and said “there was seven of us to feed. Ever see a nest of baby birds? He had practice.” Which, fair enough.

I don’t have much experience with babies, but I got to hold his youngest niece (the one living at home with his sis until her husband gets back from deployment) and we had a light talk about kids in the future. I told him that I never put much thought into it but if they were going to grow up in a happy home like his and not how I grew up, I’m pretty sure I’d be open to having them with him someday. But later. I need him all to myself for a while first. He seemed really really happy about that, which makes ME feel all goofy and happy. I’m sappy.

We had to drive home Sunday night, but before we went his mom hugged me and said she’s NEVER seen her son like this, and thanked me for taking good care of her baby. And asked if we’d be back for the 4th of July or if we were doing something with my family. And I tried to be all “haaaa no we’ll be here if you don’t mind, I don’t see them much” and I think she caught on that there’s more to the story so she just hugged the shit out of me (vikings, all of them I swear) and told me she can’t wait to see me again.

My ears are still ringing from all the noise and chaos, but it was an absolute blast and I can’t wait to see them again in July. Also, pretty much sure Mike is the man I’m going to marry. I literally can’t think of a single reason why I would ever let him get away.

Anyway thanks for reading, hope you all had a lovely weekend, and those of you who got to see the aurora I’m happy for you but you suck, lol.





**UPDATE (again) Dating a disabled guy: 4th of July**



As I’ve gotten a ton of requests for updates, I figured I would let you guys know how things are going in my world. You know how sometimes a relationship looks amazing at first but then all the red flags start showing up?

This isn’t one of those stories, lol.

Sorry, that was mean, but I couldn’t resist. Okay, on to the actual update! No we aren’t engaged yet. Yes we have talked about it in the context of how seriously we are taking things. No babies yet either obviously, we are diligent about birth control. I want Mike all to myself for a while.

So, the 4th of July visit to his family’s house was pretty awesome. After getting to know everyone last time I had better expectations of what I was going into, and I’ve talked with my therapist about the whole “play fighting makes me anxious because in my childhood home it wasn’t playing” thing. I don’t want them to ever curb how they act to cater to me, and instead I guess I’ll consider it immersion therapy. I think Mike mentioned it anyway because I didn’t see much of it this time, though there were cheerful threats of doom lobbed about which I didn’t mind at all.

His mom is amazing, I’d like to point out. Even if she moms so hard it makes me weepy. So, background info: I have a really common sounding name spelled REALLY uncommonly. Think Danyell or Jessikah. Because in addition to everything else my parents decided to be creative when they named me. So, although I do sort of like my name, that meant I was that kid who never saw their name personalized on anything. Mike’s family, on the other hand, had like a million kids and they all got traditional names, so personalized stuff was huge for them (it kept them from fighting over stuff I guess.) One of the things in their house, because they have a pool, is that each of the kids (adults now) has their own personalized beach towel that lives at the house.

So we get to their place and it’s been a hot drive there, so right after we get in Mike suggests I go to his room to get changed into a swimsuit so we can have a dip in the pool. I’m thinking that sounds perfect, right? Some of you may already know where this is going…. I get to his room and there is a towel on the bed. In my favorite color. With my fucking stupid-ass-spelled name embroidered into it. So here I am crying over a goddamn towel and he’s in the doorway watching and grinning like he just pranked me or some shit. Turns out it was HER idea but she checked with Mike to make sure it was spelled right. So now I have a towel for when we visit because APPARENTLY I’m welcome.

If I sound cranky it’s just because I’m better at self-depreciation than I am expressing emotions in a direct way. I really am blown away and touched by how much these people have welcomed me. Mike has already sort of learned to decode the way I talk and joke, which is nice, but the first time he gently said “that’s not humor, that’s just putting yourself down, babe,” I definitely wanted to go hide under the table. He doesn’t let me be mean to me. That’s a thing good partners do, I guess? I wouldn’t know. (Again, yes I am in therapy, I am working on myself, it’s not his responsibility to put me back together, it’s just something he does naturally.) I literally told him one night that I was sorry I’m kind of broken, and he snorted and said “at least you can walk” in the most disgusted voice ever and made me laugh.

I digress. So the food was once again amazing, and I kept my promise to teach his mom how to make my cinnamon bun bread pudding, so I felt like I contributed. (Insert Ralph Wiggum “I’m Helping!” meme.) I learned to play Yahtzee, and as it turns out I am very good at it. They do a lot of board games things at night when everyone is staying for the week. These people have a LOT of board games. And puzzles. Whole damn storage closet of the things. They also drink like fuckin FISH and can hold it so I am learning to pace myself. Mike doesn’t drink much when we aren’t there so I’m not worried that it’s a red flag. Only red flag of his that I’ve found was a Red Sox pennant in his room.

Now I realize I might be talking him up a lot, but he isn’t perfect! He snores, he has a habit of arguing with people on the TV when they make stupid decisions, he sometimes starts talking about things I don’t understand and just goes and goes until he realizes he lost me like 15 minutes ago, and he is FASTIDIOUSLY tidy, which makes me feel guilty because I have bad habits to lose. I’m not used to “clutter means I can’t move through an area” but I’m really trying. I barely spend any time at my own place anymore, and we’re definitely looking to move in together sooner than later.

Yeah, so, not that much of an update, no one burned themselves on a firework or anything super exciting, I’m just in an ongoing relationship with a great guy who has a great family and things continue to look up for us. We head home tonight so we can spend some alone time Sunday. Hope everyone else had a safe and happy holiday!





**UPDATE: Dating a disabled guy yes it's me again - 4 weeks later**



I debated just posting this on my own page, but shit , like a lot of people keep asking for more so I guess it doesn’t hurt to drop my post between “AITAH for literally killing someone” and “AITAH for meekly accepting my inlaw’s cruelty but asking if I may wash my wounds before they flog me again.”

This is not an exciting update. Not engaged. No babies on the way, not even freakishly tall ones like some of you are hexing me with. But…. Jess finally met Mike.

TLDR: Learning to read long posts is good for your attention span.

SORRY! I mean I’m not sorry, I feel compelled to open with a joke and I don’t know why. Anyway real TLDR she thinks he’s amazing, she thinks it is HYSTERICAL that I’m on tictok (I refuse to download it) and she is doing amazing. And our lives are moving forward together.

Jess and I have this friend, who I will call Meg and NOT TALULAH despite both Jess and Mike thinking would be hilarious. Meg was planning to have a birthday party, the big THREE OH, and she and Jess are close (and both presently single.) They chose a local bar with outside seating, and Jess did a “wait, lets check their accessibility” because I have been bitching to her for the last month. And lol and be-fucking-hold after calling the place, they didn’t have a ramp for the balcony/outside seating area.

As I have been told Jess said “nope I am meeting Mr. Throwra\_JessComeOn” and so they found another place that’s a damn hike from everyone. But it has a great outside area with accessibility. And THEN we got the invite. Through Facebook because we are all basic, I guess? And Mike was stoked because they have this awesome beer selection (full stop I hate hops sooooo). Then Meg told us that (no I am not using Talulah for the 15% of you going “oh but that was such a better name”) they chose it because Jess wanted Mike to feel welcome. So hats off to Jess for making the comeback impression of the century, I guess.

The birthday was fun, and silly, and everyone in my immediate friend group met Mike and loved him. Tons of laughter, everyone drank way too much, but fortunately we had enough heads up for a planned motel stay (why yes, I do own a UV flashlight, why do you ask?) so we and a bunch of other people didn’t drive home. We actually had brunch in the bar the next day, it was absolutely awesome and I am ruined for pancakes because FLUFFY.

Once again, I digress.

Jess and Mike hit it off and she told him literally every story I didn’t want her to over brunch, and it all was great apart from the persistent hangover. I crashed at Mike’s again. Annnnnnd then he asked what it would cost to break my lease, because he hates the mornings he wakes up and I’m not there. So the next upcoming week and a half or so is going to be insane while I pack up my whole damn life and shove half into a storage unit and the other half into his apartment, and then we’ll be living together.

I know it’s too soon. He does too. We’ve decided we’re idiots and just going for it. My landlord is a lady who is a bit on the older side and isn’t charging me for breaking the lease as long as I leave the place ready for a new renter, so I may respond to comments for a bit right away but expect a lot of silence for a while after.

True TLDR: Best friend made a good second impression, and I’m moving in with Mike ahead of schedule. I should be worried but I’m actually just really excited. Wish me luck!!






**UPDATE: Dating a disabled guy and this headline gets more and more awkward so probably “Dating Mike with the Wheels” from now on - 7 weeks later**



Hey! I get a LOT of messages asking how things are going, but I kinda HATE when people update every five minutes with the “my neighbor looked at me sideways” updates after three paragraphs of recapping drama.

So for those not invested:

Still with Mike. He’s amazing. I will marry him.

We live together now! It’s been trying. As in he is trying not to laugh at how inept I am at cohabitation. I am really good at not leaving stuff out, now, so there’s improvement. He doesn’t infantilize (oOOooO reddit big brain word) me at all but he definitely gives me the grace due an absolute idiot. I appreciate it.

We are not engaged (guys it’s been half a year, come on.)

I’m writing a book about our relationship. It starts with “My name is” and the rest is just notes. Don’t hold your breath.

Jess moved into my old apartment. Yes, my former landlord is the GOAT. Jess is also seeing a guy. I think it is too soon. She agrees. But she has “reasons” (girl we all have needs) and who am I to judge.

Aaaaand I was recently in kind of a serious car accident. I am fine, I have great health insurance, great car insurance, and am recovering just fine. No go funds here, though if you want to help just find a reputable charity for helping victims of drunk drivers and give them your money. So I was on my way home from working overtime and some dude clipped my car and I ended up in a ditch while he just sort of spun out….. but I wear my seatbelt because I have a brain and I got really, really lucky.

Everything is fine, my medical deductible was already paid up for the year, and the worst I had was some bruises, a cracked femur fibula, whiplash, and a totaled car. The silver lining is that Mike is GREAT at caretaking? Another check mark in the having kids category. Also his mom brought us like a million home made frozen dinners in Costco serving trays and we had nowhere to put them so she bought us a fucking chest freezer. I….. guys I don’t even know with this family. They are amazing.

I know usually I give some sweet, heartwarming updates while bitching about mental health, but I am pretty well medicated until my leg heals and I have a few weeks off work to cuddle Mike while watching bad sci-fi, so I’m not in the best place to fill your cups. Sorry. Also don’t watch “Another Life” on Netflix unless you have the ability to set your brain aside because it is the least consistent show I have ever seen. I mean I loved it especially the spine ripping itself out of a person and trying to walk away OH MY GOD but it requires suspension of disbelief like few things I have encountered in all my years.

Also Mike says hi. He indulges meeeee.

Have a good autumn and please for the love of heck don’t drive drunk.

And don’t expect anything from me unless the Thanksgiving gathering is as epic as they claim (ahahaha I almost slipped and said his last name. No doxxing for you today!) because reddit is probably already over my shit.

As always, love you guys for all the support, I’m okay, relationship is fab, and please don’t drink and drive.

Edit: I don't have a cracked femur. Jesus crackers these meds are something. I have a fractured fibula (lower leg, outside bone) and it didn't break all the way through. I have no idea how I mixed those two up. Mike says at least I'm cute when I'm high, but he is clearly biased. So yeah. Cracked fibula, little leg bone, short(ish) healing time. Not femur thank fuck.

*I've been here since your first post, and im still so happy for you. Everyone deserves an amazing loving relationship, and I'm glad you have that. Enjoy all the Thanksgiving food!!*

>OOP: It really isn't too bad. I didn't BREAK my leg thankfully. I got super lucky. It'll be a good while before I am cleared to run again but I literally got to go home the same night I got taken to the hospital, so I'm calling it a win.

**Unimportant update: Saw the northern lights!!!! - 2 weeks later**

*Missed them months ago but we got an alert they were visible tonight and we drove out to the closest low light area. PRETTY!
I'm still on leave but Mike took time off for tomorrow so we can sleep in and watch this as much as we can. I know it's silly but damn I am so happy.*


**UPDATE: Dating Mike with the wheels, belated Thanksgiving and Christmas updates - 2.5 months later**


Hello, reddit friends! It’s been a minute, right? Sorry about that. There’s been a lot of very real life stuff that intersected with the holiday, so I haven’t had the best time to make an update. Thanks for asking so much though, I feel the support! First thing, Mike and I are great. Coming up on a year if you can believe it!

Out of respect, (not Mike’s family!!) I’ll put a trigger warning here about parental death/trauma/etc.

I had a Thanksgiving post in my notes almost fully written when unfortunately I got the call. I’ve mentioned before that I had kind of a rough upbringing and have been estranged from my parents for a few years, but they were still my parents, you know? So anyhow my mother passed away the day after Thanksgiving. (Natural causes, she just neglected her health in general.) I hadn’t talked to her since a half hearted attempt last Christmas, she didn’t even know about Mike. And I don’t know if I even feel sad, exactly, but it knocked me for a loop and writing about how great Mike’s family is left a bad taste in my mouth. My therapist says I (paraphrasing here) already mourned the loss of the good parts of my mom when I started processing the bad parts, so my reaction isn’t abnormal. For once.

But it wasn’t the easiest time, and then the funeral meant a whole lot of people I never wanted to see again. Mike was a godsend, he’s so charismatic and charming that no one had anything bad to say to me, it was more like a room of acquaintances. I’m so glad we moved in together, I don’t know how I would have gotten through it and then gone home alone.

So…. I’m going to do this a little out of order. Mike and I spent the whole Christmas week with his parents again, and they were very sympathetic and understanding in the “we respect that you don’t want us to make a big deal” way. Most of his family wasn’t there except for dinner the day after Christmas (just wait till the Thanksgiving recap and you’ll understand why Christmas is so low key, no one could handle that twice in two months.) So it was nice to wake up and feel like family and open presents in my pajamas. Mike and I have matching Christmas ones now. We are ridiculous together, and I love it. Also, it was a white Christmas for the first time in years!!

To those hoping for a proposal….. I did get jewelry! But not a ring. Sorry! Believe me it’s on the table and where we feel we are headed, but we’re not rushing things. Also given everything going on, it wouldn’t have been the right time. But I got a lovely pendant with my birthstone and real diamonds, so I was very spoiled.

Christmas dinner was good and catered, and a lot of chaos and kids and presents, and I missed most of it because I had a pretty bad headache and it was just a LOT at once. But I was there for pictures, and everyone kind of accepts that I’m the future wife even without a ring, so I feel nice and included.

Sorry that this update is on a bit of a downer note, I know I don’t really sound like my usual upbeat self, but I’ll get back there once the holidays, seasonal depression, and STUFF is behind me. That’s why I saved my Thanksgiving post for the end, to hopefully go out on a high note.

The Thanksgiving recap:

Hi all! I get a lot of requests for updates, so I thought I’d share how things are going, now that gluttony day is behind us. Mike and I are happily cohabitating still, things are well on most fronts. I had a minor car accident a little while ago (I posted on my page about it) but I’m mostly healed up now. Mike’s family is still the absolute best, and honestly his mom is more motherly than mine has ever been. Sucks, but it is what it is. (See? That line right there, ouch.)

I’d been warned that Thanksgiving is sort of their BIG holiday, since a lot of the family spends time elsewhere on Christmas. And that it’s a bit of a spectacle. But Lord Almighty I was not prepared for this shit. So, things you need to know: there is some weird “battle of the sexes” thing they do. A few years ago Mike’s mom pointed out that the family kept getting bigger and it was harder to make enough turkey for everyone. So the kids got together (and everyone takes credit for the idea) and bought their dad one of those turkey deep fryers for Christmas. So Thanksgiving rolls around again (I so wish I’d met Mike sooner to see it myself) and thanks to the combination of beer and “I’m sure we can figure this out” ….apparently their dad set fire to the lawn. At least no one was hurt, apart from pride. But after that there was sober practice, and now mom’s turkey vs dad’s turkey is this whole THING. Like there is literally shit talk the whole day. People are set up into camps.

I joked we needed team shirts and I think they actually want to do that next year.

It was all pretty hilarious and casual, and they had like three damn tables set up. Don’t worry, reddit! I made sure no teenagers were being parentified or unliked inlaws were being forced to sit at the kids table. (Actually I was low-key jealous, they got crayons and coloring books.) The food was all amazing and all hands on deck except for me because his mom refused to have me on my feet even though my leg is basically fine now. Mike kept bringing me stuff, it was so cute y’all. I can’t even put into words how much golden retriever energy this boy has.

If you’re wondering who made the better turkey? Ooh man it’s hard. Mike’s mom does a brine (Alton Brown is the GOAT) but there is something about fried turkey skin that is just next level. So I’d say it’s a tie, and that’s not just me being diplomatic. I ate so much that I barely had room for dessert. It was fantastic. I never fall asleep in the car, but I was passed out on the drive home. We had kind of a second Thanksgiving at home the next day from the leftovers, and I probably just put on 50 pounds. No ragrets.

Anyway I’m off to sleep the bird off, I hope you all had a wonderful turkey day and a great Christmas coming up!

End recap.

So there you have it. I’m okay, we’re okay, and I’m looking forward to 2025 being even better than 2024. Happy News Years and I wish you all the best!!

*I forgot does Mike have any single relatives? Lol I love you guys. I'm sorry for your losses, sometimes it can hurt to lose the potential for a person to redeem themselves (but that might just be me). Wishing you continued happiness.*

I got a 6am wake up call from NFH!,"I haven't even had my coffee yet, but NFH upstairs scared me awake at 6am by slamming shit, got my heart racing and head aching, I couldn't get back to sleep. Then again at 8am stomping and banging around. Now they'll do this all day. I already have my earplugs in and headphones on. I might head out to my car to take a nap later like I usually have to do. As I've written in my other posts, I haven't slept a full night in the past 9 months. (6am is late for them, it's always at 3am but I guess NFH had to sleep a tiny bit more from NYE)

Because NFH only sleeps 5-6 hours, means I only sleep 5-6 hours. I can't live like this. It feels like any ounce of joy in life has been sucked out of me. I don't do anything anymore - I used to have hobbies and go places, but now I sit here with headphones on, mentally unable to even get up sometimes. I've been seeing my doctor about possible depression, but I do have anxiety from this and am on medication. I used to write books for the past 10 years, but I haven't written a single thing since NFH moved in because I've been mentally wrecked by all of this turmoil. 

Here's to praying NFH moves out in 2025. I can't because I live with my elderly mother who can't walk, and I'm the only one who can pack and organize the movers. It would take months to actually move, and my mom is in no shape for any of it. If it were just me, I would have definitely moved by now.",3,1735740841.0,neighborsfromhell,4,1.0,False
