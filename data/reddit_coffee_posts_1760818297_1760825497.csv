I was new to the job and around a month ago he showed me around the whole place. Made jokes to lighten me up and overall made me feel so much at ease. During this month we became quick work friends and he really helped me out in settling in. I was debating whether he liked me or not because he was very nice to me and went out of his way to bring me things such as an extra coffee and things like that so I just decided to take a chance and flirt with him at a work party. (HE DOESN'T WEAR A RING) I was slightly tipsy and definitely laughed a lot more than i would normally at his jokes among other things when a beautiful woman walked in apologising for being late and then they kiss and i immediately want to kill myself. I looked at him comically open mouthed and said you're married? He looked at me and he said yes. Very married. this happened yesterday and i have to go back at work tomorrow.

1oa8vz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/inlaws/comments/1oa8vz6/breaking_up_because_of_in_laws/,Breaking up because of In Laws,"I'll try to keep this as short and as sweet as i can.

My bf (M34) and I (F27) have been together for 4 years. We did Long distance for the first 1.5 years and right after i quit my job to move to him, we broke up because of something that he did. The break up lasted for like 2-3 weeks and we were in contact throughout the breakup (i know not a real breakup). 

Anyway. his mum sent me a long ass text saying that i should take her son back because im a ""good girl"" and we should not throw away our future, people make mistakes and we should learn to put things behind us etc. I did end up taking him back and we now live together. The relationship is absolutely perfect, we communicate and get along well.

Thing is..his parents are attached to his hip.   
1) He financially supports them so whenever we have talks about our future eg marriage, kids, buying a house - the answer is always ""we dont have money because i have to take care of my parents"". I never commented on this as I feel like its his money, i dont have a say.  
2) He comes from a country with REALLY bad economy and it makes 0 sense for us to live there (We currently live aboard) as we cant even survive with the salaries the country provides. Just gonna say that the average rent is equal to the minimum wage. His parents are ADAMANT we move there and say how perfect it is :S   
3) They shit talked my country MULTIPLE times in front of me and threw a tantrum when we said that we're looking at job OPTIONS over there. We never said we'll move, just that we're thinking of it. And they had multiple meltdowns that made me feel really uncomfortable.   
4) My parents had the inlaws over at their house, and his mom threw another meltdown in my family home. For the exact same reason. Dont know how it is elsewhere, but in my culture when someone is kindly letting you stay over as their guest, you don't yell in their home. I honestly got secondhand embarrassment.  
5) When he was thinking of proposing, his mum told him not to spend much on my ring. First, why does she have a say in HIS finances and secondly, why does she expect him to spend half of the monthly allowance hes sending them over on my ring?!?!?! Why is it okay for her to say ""Give me 1k a month but spend 500 on her ring"".  
6) When they saw that my parents have money, they demanded a couple thousand from their other unemployed son, so they can host an extravagant stay for my parents - i guess to show of OR they see it as competition. Dont know how would they maintain that image later on...  
7) Whenever we visit them we MUST spend 24/7 with them. We never went for a coffee or for food in his area. We have to be locked in the house with them for DAYS. I once said that i want to visit a relative that lives nearby (just for a coffee for an hour), and they made a fuss and told my bf that i should get the bus and go alone.  
8) His brother said that i am strategic and manipulative because i didnt text him privately to wish him ""good luck"" for an interview, but i texted his mum instead. Note: I do not have a DM with him, we never talk. His mum was the one that informed me about his interview so it felt polite to mention it the next day.   
9) AFTER we broke up, his mum texted me a random morning asking me ""Whats my son doing? why hasnt he texted me goodmorning today"" :S 

Anyway. these are just things that come in mind now, but theres many more. After all this i clearly stated that I am not interested in moving to his country, not only because of the economy, but i do not want this miserable and controlling behaviour any closer to me. 

My bf never stood up to them. Never set boundaries because he sees them as ""innocent old people that dont know better"". And he then broke up with me because his parents are his priority. And wants to move back home.

I feel so used and disrespected. I treated these people like my own family, sent them gifts at every birthday, anniversary etc. I made sure my bf kept the daily 40minute video calls with them, even though i found it way too much.

I cant get over the way they treated me. I get panic attacks when i think of it or when i hear them - We still live together with my ex because hes in the process of moving out. 

How do i deal and cope, when i feel so mistreated? I dont even know why I care so much about their opinion. I know they hate me because they feel like i tried to steal their son or smth.

I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection and engagement with another person. More simply? I want someone to casually chat with daily. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul. All in the same person? Wonderful! But I don’t have such lofty expectations of anyone – including of myself. Let’s feel each other out to know what’s possible and what we’d like to see happen.

So, who am I exactly? And who are you?

I'm 35, male, and live in the US (ET time zone). Thoroughly introverted, but bold and open when the mood strikes and with those who can tap into that aspect of me. I’m designed for the slow burn and deliberation of written conversation, but am an adopter of voice chat, which I sometimes even prefer if I really vibe with someone.

In regards to MBTI, I first tested as INTJ during my teens and continued to primarily test as it into my 30s. More recently, I sometimes get INFJ. I've also gotten INTP and ISTJ before.

Incremental exchange and a mutual creation is what I default to, but I've gone to the ends of the earth on a whim with the right person before. I adore abstract minds that get idiosyncrasy and whimsy. Compatibility is a strange thing, though, that feels most real when it’s too fluid to be defined. I sort of have a thing for making connections work that otherwise shouldn't.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young. I’m most infatuated with the nature and function of reality, and particularly human perception. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that a lack of limitation is highly limiting.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from mundane chats to lengthy letters, often permeated with a dim poetic glow. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it.

I like burning incense, time pieces, archiving and organization, collecting, and coffee. I’m always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies. I so probably have more I take for granted.

I'm easily distracted by books, iced coffee, and farmers' markets. I like following my nose to bakeries and following my feet along nature trails. I like a quiet life, simple comforts. Might be a Hobbit??

I'm a curvier person, and not conventionally attractive. I say this now because I get ghosted a lot once I share a selfie. Temper your expectations accordingly. 

Looking for someone who is similar in values. I'm neither religious nor spiritual, and I'm liberal in my political views. Have been accused of being kind, thoughtful, and sometimes smart.

My goals in life are simple: to live independently in a small home with room for a library and a garden and a dog; to have a good job that allows me to live; to have a meaningful life. 

I'm also okay on my own, but sometimes feel curious about sharing a life with someone else.

1oa8mev,https://i.redd.it/xlrodm9kzxvf1.jpeg,Introducing the latest additions to my collection!,"After going through a challenging time in my personal life, I threw myself into cooking (and into this sub) and I have found a lot of comfort in it. I have loved cooking for a long time but recently went into a bit of cookbook-buying ""craze"" and bought those eight cookbooks in the space of two months! I love all of them and can't wait to try more recipes. So I wanted to introduce fellow cookbook lovers to my latest additions!

**Modern Australian Food:** I am French and based in the UK, but I am mad about all things Australian and wanted to bring a little bit of Australia into my kitchen… More recent books have been published - Phaidon’s Australia: The Cookbook and Bill Granger’s Australian Food - but for some reason I didn’t really “connect” with either book. After much searching online I found this 2012 book from Australian Women’s Weekly. It showcases the huge variety of modern Australian cuisine from city café culture to rustic country cooking and refined costal dishes.

*I can’t wait to make…* Seafood laksa. Although it’s a Southeast Asian dish, I always associate it with my time in Australia because the first time I had it was on a plane to Sydney, and I enjoyed seafood laksa many times afterwards while in Oz. I love it and can’t wait to try and replicate the same flavours at home.

**Paella:** Paella has always been my favourite dish. I love rice-based dishes and seafood so when I saw this book I knew I had to have it! Although the author acknowledges that most of his recipes are not “classic” paella recipes, I love the flavour combinations. It’s also a very charming book and has meat, seafood and vegetarian paella options.

*I can’t wait to make*… Red mullet and squid paella.

**Mabu Mabu**: Australia again! The book is by Torres Island chef Nornie Bero, who showcases a lot of native ingredients in her recipes (saltbush, wattleseed, pepperberry, emu, kangaroo…). I bought this book on a whim from a UK bookshop and I have to admit, when I got home and flicked through the recipes, I thought I might need to return it! I felt very “intimidated” by the recipes with ingredients completely unknown to me and which can’t even be found online in the UK. I assumed it might just end up as a nice “coffee table book” that I wouldn't use, but I’m heading back to Australia for a holiday soon and I am on a mission to try and find some of ingredients locally.

*I can’t wait to make*… Samur chicken (one of the most accessible recipes with easy-to-find ingredients), then other dishes with native ingredients if I can find them on my next trip. I certainly won’t eat crocodile in the UK, but I still want to try Nornie’s “Saltbush Pepperberry Crocodile” dish – apparently it tastes a bit like salt and pepper squid so I will just substitute croc for squid!

**The Spanish Pantry** I was lucky enough to meet Jose Pizarro at a book festival this summer, and got a signed copy of this book. I love the bold flavours of Spanish cuisine and Jose himself a completely delight to listen to – so friendly and clearly passionate about his food!

*I can’t wait to make…* Lecha frita with caramel oranges.

**LEON’s Big Flavours** – LEON is a UK fast-food restaurant chain with a twist. It focuses on better (but still fast) food, integrating the best of British food with more complex Asian or Middle-Eastern inspired flavours. I also have a positive association with LEON as I’ve only eaten there at airports or petrol stations on my way to exciting trips abroad! Their waffle fries and gochujang chicken wrap are always a winner. I picked this book because it specifically focuses on big, bold flavours and recipes are listed as salty, sweet, sour or spicy (and sometimes all four!).

*I can’t wait to make*… Kimchi mac and cheese.

**The Island Kitchen** I bought this book (along with another small recipe book, Mankafy Sakafo) thanks to recommendations from Redditors, when I asked about finding a book on the [cuisine of Madagascar](https://www.reddit.com/r/CookbookLovers/comments/1n8n0ki/cookbook_on_the_cuisine_of_madagascar/). This is exactly the style of cooking I love – rice-based recipes, rich stews seasoned with delicate spices, coconut and vanilla-based sauces. It is such a beautiful cookbook on one of my favourite parts of the world.

I *can’t wait to make…* I couldn’t wait to make coconut tuna curry from the Maldives, and made it earlier this week. It was delicious and made me want to try more! I’m planning on making lobster with vanilla sauce for the festive season.

**Sauces et accompagnements –** A French-language cookbook on sauces, including classic French sauces, salsas, chutneys and seasoned butters. I wanted to have a reference book on sauces so I could turn a basic dish of meat and fish with rice/vegetables into something different just by changing the sauce.

 *I can’t wait to make…* Nantua sauce. It’s a classic French sauce with a creamy tomato and brandy base – very indulgent and delicious with fish.

**The Nutmeg Trail** This is my latest purchase and one of the few cookbooks that I will probably read cover to cover. Not only are the recipes gorgeously illustrated with enticing dishes from around the world, but it also takes the reader on a historic and culinary journey along the spice route. I keep picking it up and just browsing through it dreaming of what to cook next!

*I can’t wait to make…* Royal Saffron Paneer (paneer cooked in in a creamy, subtly spiced sauce with cardamom and saffron)",3,1760824603.0,CookbookLovers,0,1.0,False
1oa8ke6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1oa8ke6/i_think_im_in_love_with_my_friend_who_ive_told/,i think im in love with my friend who ive told everyone i would never be into and i don’t want to be help,"Okay so i’ve never used reddit before just seen the clips and stuff on tiktok so forgive me if this is not the right way to go about things but i feel like if i keep repressing all of this i’ll explode or something to that degree and i really have no one else i can talk to about this

Okay so i have a friend, we’ve known each other for 3 or so years. The first time we hung out he took me up a hill behind our school to show me the view and we joked about brutal pipe murder (magnus archives reference) for the majority of the time which in hindsight probably should have scared me but sue me i was unsocialized since the pandemic and it was my first year of high school i think and we had really hit it off earlier

Ever since then we’ve pretty much been tied at the hip, i spent the most time with him out of all of my friends and really no i loved him, just not romantically. We’ve shared things i would never tell anyone else, hell he’s read fanfiction that i have written. We went on a trip with friends one time and stayed up till 3 am together just talking about anything and everything and he cried in front of me which is genuinely wild because in all the time since I’ve only seen him cry 2 other times, i cry quite a lot more im a very emotional person so he’s seen me do it probably 100 times or something at this point. And then after that it was very cold in the cabin because of the snow and the heater was only working in the upper floors because it was an old building so we ended up huddled together on the couch and slept there sharing a blanket, i hadn’t thought much of it at the time. We’re very good friends.

He’s came to my cousin’s wedding with me, we’ve slept in the same bed in a hotel room and in my grandma’s house. And throughout all of this i haven’t thought much of it. We’re close friends you do these things with close friends. One of our other friends who i’m not close to anymore started yelling on a feildtrip one time that we were kissing at the back of the bus because he was sleeping on my shoulder after not having gotten any rest the night prior and it made me uncomfortable then and still does now

People tend to assume that we’re into each because i talk about him a lot, he’s an integral part of my life so i don’t really understand why that is strange but i assume it’s because i am very feminine presenting and he’s a dude and of course a friendship is impossible between opposite genders obviously but really its so ridiculous and it also sucks because people i think demean my personhood even unconsciously because of this, instead of asking after me they’ll ask after him. He was out for a week due to personal matters and his other closest friend asked me how he was as if i’d know. i didn’t i was also in the dark.

I feel like i put a lot into the relationship i plan outings and am almost always the one to ask to him hang out and i do believe this is because he’s quite anxious as a person but it would be nice to be appreciated a bit, im probably being silly sorry we’re off topic.

Anyways, a few months ago i burst and told him of all my frustrations here because he was somehow unaware that the majority of our acquaintances and classmates have been assuming we’re a thing and it was very cathartic but i think since then he’s slowly been pulling away. We don’t spend nearly as much time alone which is likely on me since this year has been really busy for me and him during school and all of like the weekly hangouts are group things like study group and movie night and i’ve started taking the weekends to spend time with my family because my mother wants to spend more time with me and i love her so that time is booked and really there is never enough time in the day but still, we used to go out for coffee weekly, or hiking, or just walking around and doing nothing, or he’d come to my place and we’d just fuck around for hours on end and we’re not doing that anymore and it makes me sad. I don’t know how to feel.

And then a few months back i was on a road trip with some extended family, it was very awkward as most of these things are but i was surviving and the whole time i was thinking about being back home with friends. And i thought about him alot, i tend to do that i noticed, i think about him an awful lot, he seems to wiggle his way in every wayward thought. The other day i was looking at couches and all i could think about is how they’re the same corduroy as his trousers, and he’d probably love it. It’s horrible. And really this whole time ive been internally fighting with myself because i really can’t be into him i can’t okay it would mess up everything and everyone i know knows that i would never consider him that way but i think ive started doing so.

I’ve imagined it. Imagined a lot of things and really i can’t imagine a life without him. I truly fully would like to spend the rest of my life with him making him decaf earl grey so he won’t be up all night and just being around him. But at the same time i feel like platonic love is so undervalued and i would truly like to do this with many of my friends but something about this feels different and it really scares me. Maybe i’m just looking too into it and anyways he could never love or even like me back in that sense. He’s aroace, or the last time i checked he was be he plays around with this stuff a lot, and yes i did see a tiktok repost of his that said he somewhat only thinks this because he believes he’s undeserving of love but i think the fact ive been thinking about that repost from several months ago at all is a symptom of my own deranged mind and the fact that most of my feed on that app is his reposts because i downloaded it for him to send me stupid cat videos. And even so even if this is true i don’t think he would ever like me even if just out of respect but also im generally undesirable, and he’s into much manlier men, hannibal lector and elias bouchard from the magnus archives included. I am a guy, but hell will freeze over the day i give up my skirts and jewelry. Its all just horribly complicated and silly and oh dear i hope none of my friends fund this i will actually have to fake my death and flee to alaska. Only one of them is on reddit but still, let’s hope she’s on a different side than my ridiculous sob stories.

And also he is just genuinely amazing i truly believe he’s just one of the most amazing people in the world. People orbit around him and he is just so kind and passionate and ugh it just horrible. And he’s quite closed off so at least i know we’re close as friends because i know his mum (she’s lovely and i would die for he) and none of out other friends have and ive been to his apartment and sometimes drive him there after school when it’s bad weather and the other day his mom brought one of his cats who are his pride and joy and to tell you the truth i never really cared for cats before him but the love he talks about them with is infectious and he brought the cat over for me to see and oh so adorable i think my heart genuinely melted and he stayed late after movie night with me and said he’d like to bring the cat over again to meet my dog who we all love and i just stared up at him from the pillow nest we built as he pet and told my dog he love him and i just 

Anyways, a few days ago it was his birthday and for it i formatted, printed, and bound The Magnus Archives season 1 as a book for him because it’s his favorite podcast and he’s genuinely considered changing his name to Jon (the main character’s name) because of it. And actually i think he is right now, for the general public so that teacher won’t misgender him all the time. Regardless i gave it to him and the whole month of fretting and misprinting and sewing felt just so worth it to see him like it and i do think i would do pretty much anything to see him like that again and we celebrated at my place all of us with a cake out friends and i baked and he stayed late to help pack up and a few months ago we would have talked something real but it was just kind of quiet and fond that night and strangely charged i really don’t know how to feel. I had messaged him later that night and he was just so sweet it makes me want to die i hate this how do i stop it. We have plans to move in together after school and i just i care so much about him and i don’t know if i actually want him romantically or if it’s just all the romance novels or something i read or if im just tricking myself to fit in like i used to do in middle school or if the general assumption has just got to me i don’t know

Also, I’ve never read our contract. Could this be a violation of the contract? I mean we have very little resources and isn’t that part of their end of the deal? We’ve been considering just changing into an independent coffee spot after our contract expires but we’re only half way through a 10 year contract. If we could get out early without consequence, I think my department would be very happy. ",1,1760824427.0,starbucksbaristas,0,1.0,False

1oa8imz,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1oa8imz/a_brief_story_of_my_recent_lo/,A brief story of my recent LO,"Been lurking this sub for some time and found out that I had limerence most of my life. But recently I had the biggest crush ever. We were colleagues and this girl and I shared so much in common. We were both shy and anxious, listened to the same music, same humor, same stances about things in life. And before, I could kinda tell that a crush wasn't really into me, but this time I really felt like there was something between us. It wasn't just one sided, she was interested in me as well. The thing that meant to me the most was the one time she opened up to me about some personal struggles and mental issues she was dealing with. Her getting this vulnerable with me has made my obsession a million times worse. I have never felt this attracted to someone before.

This was all about two months ago when I decided to ask her out for a cup of coffee after work. And she said yes! Oh, the joy I felt that day. When I remember that feeling, I don't remember anything bringing me joy as much as her saying yes. How I felt confident and happy after that, felt like I wasn't the same person anymore. So the day came and we went to the cafe after work, but I could tell she didn't seem excited as I was. The vibe wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst either. I still tried to make the best of it. It bummed me out a little that she was using her phone often, but I was crushing so hard so I let it slide.

After a while we went our separate ways and I texted her after. Told her I enjoyed our time together and the next time we should go to a bar we talked about. And then from here it all started crashing and burning. She suggested we invite someone else to go with us. I kinda knew what this meant but when you are limerent, you are clinging to the tiniest bit of hope you have. So I came clean, told her that I thought that we were heading in a direction of dating. But she didn't feel this way and said she was sorry if she gave me any mixed signals. It's funny how the day before I felt like the happiest man on earth, and then the next day I have never felt this much pain before. I played it off cool of course, so she didn't think it hurt me. Mind you, this was her last week at work, so I managed to avoid the awkardness that would follow if we would still see each other at work.

I don't know why I wrote all this but the point was that soon after I started therapy. Obviously it's an issue that these things get to me so much in an unbearable way and I kinda uncovered the roots that go all the way to my childhood. It has been really helpful and felt like I was feeling more loving and accepting of myself.

And then she posted on instagram with her boyfriend. Seeing her so happy with someone else just shattered all of the progress I was making over the last month. And I don't know why. Why do I have no respect for myself, why do I not love myself, why is my worth and happines in the hands of someone who doesn't care the slightest about me?

So there I was this morning, shuffling my tarot deck while contemplating why dating apps think I’d vibe with a man whose profile pic is him holding a fish. Suddenly – bam! – the cards practically leaped out of my hands like over-caffeinated kangaroos. And that’s when I knew the universe had some *thoughts* about your romantic fortunes.

First card? The Knight of Cups. Translation: someone’s about to serenade your DMs with the emotional range of a Disney prince. He’ll send poetry at 2 AM, remember your favorite flower, and probably cry during rom-coms. Downside? He might also try to name your future kids on the third date. Proceed with caution – or at least a prenup.

But wait – here comes the Wheel of Fortune spinning in like your tipsy aunt at a wedding! This card screams “plot twist.” Maybe you’ll bump into an ex who’s suddenly “done working on himself” (honey, he’s still got the emotional toolbox of a potato). Or perhaps a mysterious stranger will spill latte art on your shirt, launching a meet-cute so cheesy it could fund a fondue restaurant. The universe loves irony almost as much as it loves making us re-meet people from high school.

Now, the Seven of Pentacles popped up next – which basically means patience, my love-struck friends. Yes, I know waiting feels like watching TikTok buffering, but this card’s your sign to stop swiping right on guys who list “vibes” as a personality trait. Your luck’s coming from someone already orbiting your world – maybe the barista who memorizes your oat milk order or your gym buddy who “accidentally” wears matching leggings. Slow burns beat dumpster fires every time.

Oh, but the Death card flipped over sideways? Calm down, it’s not literal – unless you’re dating a vampire, in which case… congrats? It’s about transformation. Think: finally deleting that situationship’s number, or realizing “hey, maybe love shouldn’t feel like an escape room with no exit.” Out with the old karma, in with the new joy!

And just when I thought the reading was done, the Lovers card winked at me like it knew I was single. This bad boy’s all about alignment – heart, mind, and Wi-Fi connection. Your lucky charm could be someone who laughs at your weird jokes, respects your toxic reality TV habits, and – crucially – understands that “I’m busy tonight” means “I’m rewatching Bridgerton in sweatpants.”

So who’s bringing the magic? My deck’s betting on either a creative soul (musician/writer/ guy who makes killer avocado toast) or a grounded earth sign who’ll remember your allergy to daisies. But honestly? The biggest luck-bringer might be YOU finally trusting that you deserve the love story that doesn’t require a decoder ring.

I (55M) will be going to Romania (Timisoara) for a week of meetings in November and decided to build a whole vacation around it. I've never been to Romania before (never farther east than Budapest, though I travel the rest of Europe (and Asia) extensively) and after quite a bit of research on Reddit and elsewhere, I built the following itinerary.

All hotels, trains, and car rentals are booked, mostly I'm interested in what people think about the Transylvania touring bet. days 10 and 17, though thoughts about Bucharest and Timisoara are welcome. Budget is not a big issue, also I'm a US passport holder, if it matters.

I'm very much into art, culture, architecture, nature, like to walk and hike, food and drink (cocktails/whiskey over wine and beer), don't care about night life, love coffee and tea culture. I also love train travel, am very much looking forward to the sleeper bet. Bucharest and Timisoara. I wanted to stick with trains the whole way, but after looking at the construction on the CFR lines, I decided to just get a car for a week (already got my IDP). Sadly, the Transfagarasan through the Alps will be closed, but I may still go a part of the north end (see day 13).

* Day 1 - Land in OTP (late night), check in to hotel (Old Town)
* Day 2 - Free day in Bucharest (Old Town wandering), board sleeper at night (Astra Trans Carpatic) to Timisoara
* Day 3 - Arrive early morning, free until afternoon (work)
* Days 4-7 - Work (afternoon of day 7 is free)
* Day 8 - Free day in Timisoara, board sleeper at night to Bucharest
* Day 9 - Free day in Bucharest, walking tour (booked)
* Day 10 - Free morning, pick up car at OTP (past noon), drive to Sibiu, check into hotel (4 nights)
* Day 11 - Alba Lulia (2hrs) > Sarmizegetusa Ulpia Traiana (1hr) > Corvin Castle (2hrs) > Deva (2hrs) > back to Sibiu
* Day 12 - Salina Turda (4hrs) > Cluj Napoca (5 hrs) > back to Sibiu
* Day 13 - Biertan (1hr) > Sighisoara (5hrs) > Balea waterfall, maybe cable car (2hrs) > back to Sibiu
* Day 14 - Morning in Sibiu (Christmas markets open!), afternoon Old Town tour (booked), check out, drive to Brasov, check into hotel (3 nights)
* Day 15 - Free day in Brasov, walking tour (booked)
* Day 16 - Bran Castle (1-2hrs--I don't really care about this stop that much) > Sinaia (rest of day) > back to Brasov
* Day 17 - Drive back to OTP, return car. Check into airport hotel, spend the rest of the day at Therme
* Day 18 - Fly out of OTP (stupidly early flight)

I don't think I packed in too much other than days 11-13, esp. day 11. I may skip Sarmizegetusa as it's about an hour's drive out of the way, and spend that time at Corvin and Deva. I'd love some feedback and additional suggestions! Thanks.",1,1760824132.0,travel,1,1.0,False

**This is going to be a long anxiety filled post so please bear with me.**  
  
I'm currently recovering from foot surgery and something about not being able to walk makes me feel antsy and unsatisfied with my living space, but I feel a lot of decision paralysis, let me try and break down what I'm feeling into points:

**1) I feel limited by the layout of the living room**  
I've rented this apartment for 4 years now and I just don't feel like my living room (or bedroom, but one thing at a time) is a comforting space, partly because of the layout I have to work around. All the furniture I had to start with wasn't mine (couch, TV console, black bookshelf were my dad's) so those pieces were convenient and not my decision. I don't see any other option to place the TV than where it is right now, so the couch can't be against a wall.

**2) I want to install a pole to exercise at home and I need to make a lot of decisions and changes to do so**  
I recently became obsessed with pole dancing and have been toying around with the idea of putting in a home pole, and the only place to fit it would be in the living room (more or less where the lemonade box is on the ground) and I'd have to make the following changes:  
  
\- nix the black bookcase  
\-nix the IKEA floor lamp (the black arching thing to the left of the TV - I already removed the shade but am indecisive about trying to sell vs. donate because the base is heavy)  
\-nix the little coffee table (maybe replace with something on wheels but it would also have to be tiny)  
\-nix the little black end table and table lamp  
\- find a much slimmer profile console to put under the TV (mostly to house the switch and internet modem/router)  
\-find a different lighting situation, something wall-based for saving space  
\-nix the cat tree?? she doesn't use it much and prefers a smaller cat tree which is hidden behind the curtains behind the end table and blue lamp.  
\-put up mirrored tiles [like this](https://thecraftyblogstalker.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/diy-mirror-wall-header.jpg) to be able to observe myself while using the pole, this would be to the left of the TV so it would take up quite a bit of wall space if it were roughly the same size  
\-hang from the wall this [heart shaped disco ball with lights](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71JOVR1eVAL._AC_SX679_.jpg) that I already got, above the area where the pole would be

And every time I would use the pole I would push the couch out of the way, hence the couch we separated and put furniture sliders under.  
I know it's not a lot of space for a home pole, I would mostly use it for conditioning and some small tricks, but I would love to have the mirror wall and disco ball nonetheless. The hurdle here is that the pole that I want is out of stock, I don't know how long it will be, and I need to save up about $700 to get it. So I guess I could start with moving the bookshelf and putting up the mirrors and the disco ball, for ambiance.

**3) The couch is an eyesore and we've outgrown it**  
I don't know how realistic it is that we will replace the couch anytime soon, but I know it needs to go, someday. Buying furniture gives me anxiety. What if it's not perfect? It would almost certainly be a used one because I don't really trust new furniture to be durable. So no online shopping but I live in a small town so it's a matter of FB marketplace or secondhand stores having the right thing at the right moment, then we will probably give our current couch to our neighbors so that's another hurdle.

**4) I don't really feel like I have a ""style"" and I want to involve my husband so he feels like this is his home too, but what if our styles clash?**  
I included some examples of spaces that I find visually appealing. I guess I would label my style as eclectic and maximalist: I love gallery walls, bright colors, vintage things - not necessarily confined to one decade. I feel like I like too many things to make decisions, I can get down with a pastel pink and dainty decor as much as I like jewel tones and funky mid century decor.  
The part about my husband may be weird but we have been long distance (US and Italy) for many years and he moved to the US last year and we got married. Maybe it's pathetic to be married and never have lived long term with a partner before, but it's our situation. I have never before had to navigate someone else's taste while making decorating decisions. I don't even know how to approach it, do we just start looking at pinterest together and compare what we like and don't like?

**5) I am impulsive and know I suck at hanging up stuff so I'm scared to mess things up even more**  
I know the TV is too high, I know the curtains are too low, I know the cat picture to the left of the brown closet doors is probably too high - these were all kind of impulsive decisions just to ""get it done"". By some miracle I managed to put up the three square frames and hanging hooks (which were originally above a much lower entry table but we replaced it with the IKEA Kallax cubbies) but haven't put other pictures in because I can't decide.

**6) Ugly brown carpet and ugly brown closet doors**

1oa8c4d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oa8c4d,Ct Valley Brewing Co employs violent predatory stalkers,"I have tried to post this several times and end up taking it down because I’m terrified that I won’t be believed, just like I was not believed by Steve Paluskas, the owner of CT Valley Brewing or by the cops until I finally advocated for myself. 

This year has been a devastating, disgusting shit show of trying to remove someone from my life who refused to go and used a place that employs known predators in order to do so, while telling people he ‘wasn’t bothering me’ and I needed to just get over it. 

I always thought abuse was very black and white, especially when it comes to DV ‘why didn’t you just leave’. It’s nuanced when you care about the person that is constantly harming you, when you still see the good in them (thankfully I have realized there is none and all of it was manipulation, and when you are being gaslit to a freakish degree and made to believe your terror is just a petty game and having it minimized by multiple people. I am still processing the gross layers of manipulation and how this person used an entire business against me to abuse me further.

I didn’t know how long I wanted to fast so it was open ended. I used Lite Salt and magnesium glycinate for my electrolytes everyday. I tried bulletproof coffee on day 1 and didn’t really like it. Then I started drinking herbal tea in the evenings with a tablespoon of coconut oil in it. Next time (just started fasting again for another seven days) I’ll take two tablespoons of coconut oil each day to empty my gallbladder. I drank water with electrolytes, diet and zero sodas, drink enhancers, and herbal tea with sucralose. Then on day four I decided to quit caffeine and artificial sweeteners. I switched to stur drink enhancers which I put in water and sparkling water and also switched from sucralose to truvia. Today I broke my fast with beef bone broth (two cups) and scrambled eggs with guacamole. I kept it to about 800 calories because the wiki said to limit calories to 4.5 per pound of body weight.

With the 2026 Tour de France route announcement imminent, I've finally been motivated to write up my experience from earlier this year.

I travelled entirely by train from London using the Japanese ""Rinko"" technique to pack my bike small enough to carry on.

I love an adventure and I'm trying to travel more sustainably, avoiding the impact and hassle of air travel where possible. Cost wasn't the primary consideration, nor was the shortest journey duration. 

My original plan was to camp (in a very small lightweight tent), so flying with a bike box would have meant finding somewhere to store the box at the airport or getting it transported to the campsite.

Plus, train travel through France is genuinely lovely.

I found this article a useful starting point for planning my trip: [**https://epicroadrides.com/cycling-blog/watching-the-tour-de-france-in-person/**](https://epicroadrides.com/cycling-blog/watching-the-tour-de-france-in-person/)

**Rinko**  
I discovered Rinko on the Man in Seat 61 website. Rinko is a Japanese technique where you dismantle your bike to fit it within train luggage limits. This meant I could avoid bike freight services, boxes, and all that hassle.

[https://www.seat61.com/bike-by-train.htm#taking-bikes-on-eurostar](https://www.seat61.com/bike-by-train.htm#taking-bikes-on-eurostar)

Here's a good article on how to Rinko: [https://www.renehersecycles.com/rinko-parts-useful-not-only-for-train-travel/](https://www.renehersecycles.com/rinko-parts-useful-not-only-for-train-travel/)

The only adaptation I made was adding a reusable cable ferrule on the front brake cable to allow easy removal of the fork.

I made my own bag along these lines: [https://bikepacking.com/gear/make-your-own-rinko-bag/](https://bikepacking.com/gear/make-your-own-rinko-bag/)

The critical requirement for Rinko is removable fork and detachable handlebars and stem (which stay attached to each other). I don’t know if hydraulic brakes or electronic groupsets would complicate this.

The breakdown:

* Wheels off
* Front fork detaches entirely (detached from brake cable)
* Bars and stem come off
* Seatpost + saddle off
* Chain, hanger, and derailleur removed (I’m waxed, so no mucky chain to deal with)
* Pedals stay on
* Some light padding in critical places, particularly between the packed components

Bike weight: \~7.5kg folded

Disassembly, packing and protection takes around 45mins. Assembly is around 15/20mins.

I created a step-by-step checklist ahead of time to ensure I didn't forget anything while potentially tired or rushed, to ensure things like reconnecting the brake cable and bolts are properly tightened before setting off.

I packed a 45L rucksack (\~10kg) with cycling kit, tools, rain gear, and spare clothes. 

**Route:** Piccadilly line to King's Cross → St Pancras → Gare du Nord → Gare du Lyon → TGV to Chambéry Challes-les-Eaux → local train to Moutiers

The bike bag drew attention at St Pancras security - it just squeezed through the 85cm ruler test. The X-ray was interesting as the bike overhung the tray and needed coaxing, but no issues.

On the Eurostar, look for the vertical luggage racks which are much better than the horizontal ones for a bike bag. I got it wrong on the outbound leg but sorted it for the return.

The RER from Gare du Nord to Gare du Lyon was the trickiest bit - standing room only and I had a cumbersome luggage arrangement. Only 2 stops though, so it was manageable.

The TGV was smooth sailing. I changed at Chambéry to a sweet little local train that wound through the mountains to Moutiers. Total journey time was reasonable, and thankfully both trains ran perfectly. I wasn't traveling on local trains on the days of the stages, which I suspect would be much more crowded.

Originally I planned to camp, but the weather forecast a week out convinced me to book hotels instead. Arriving late in the dark to assemble a bike, find dinner and set up camp, all potentially in rain, would have been a bit too much adventure for one trip.

I was lucky to secure a room at late notice in Moutiers, so next time I’d book much earlier. This location gave me a good base in the valley for both stages and other rides, and crucially meant I didn't need to ascend more after a big day. The Hotel was a 3-minute walk from Moutiers station which was ideal. 

The town was buzzing with cyclists from all over. I found a lovely little café right next to the hotel. The host ended up calling me ""chef"" because I was there so often. Simple, authentic, excellent food.

At breakfast I happened to sit at the next table to Phil Liggett covering for NBC, so had a nice low key chat about the race and riders.

Having assembled my bike before breakfast, I rolled out of town with a procession of other riders.

**Stage 18 - Col de la Loze**  
I set off not knowing how far I'd get on the HC climb. Just told myself ""get to the next marker, then the next one…”, and was pleased to make it all the way to the top.

The atmosphere on the way up was unreal. Festival vibes - music blaring, people handing out Orangina and beers, cowbells, Allez, Allez chants. Cars were crawling up in traffic; I was faster on the bike even climbing. Someone literally handed me a spliff out a car window (I declined as I was a bit busy surviving). There was a huge variety of riders making their way up; hardcore roadies, mountain bikes, kids getting a tow from a  parent. Seeing groups of a mix of acoustic and e-bikes, I now realise experiencing it with a less capable companion is totally possible.

300m from the summit the gendarmes blocked the road and ordered those arriving off their bikes. I left my bike 10m back from the road and felt comfortable leaving it and saddle bag unattended. I walked to the cafe at the top to get pate and bread and some drinks, then headed back to my chosen spectating spot. 

In my saddle bag I’d brought a down jacket, leg warmers which turned out to be very needed, along with more snacks for the long wait before the caravan and riders arrived.

My spot gave me a great view of the winding 1km approach the riders would take.

Weather rolled in and visibility got sketchy, but I was right at the spot where Pogačar passed Vingegaard to take second place, moments after Ben O’Connor had passed. Just a flash of yellow - incredible!

Descending afterward was WILD; thousands of people bombing down twisting turning and passings the huge queues of cars. 

**Stage 19 - La Plagne**  
I’d originally toyed with the idea to ride to Cormet de Roselend, but the whole ride would have been over 120km. I felt 2 hour ride back after standing in the rain for 3 hours without a proper meal might be a bit tough. 

So instead I embarked on another HC climb. Got to the top again but the summit town of La Plagne was very unattractive (on his podcast Ned Boulting described it as an Alpine dump), so descended a couple km to find a viewing spot. I had a decent view of the approach and also meant I could get off the mountain quicker.

Weather was a bit miserable (cold and wet) but the people weren't. Watching the caravan and all the riders come through was brilliant. I was wet but wore everything I had on the descent to stay warm. 

On the Saturday had a spare day so did the full Cormet de Roselend loop of 125km. Stunning. Sweeping switchbacks climbing through the forest, then stopped at an Alpine café near the reservoir for coffee and cake. The reservoir forms the backdrop of that epic shot you see on TV before the pros climb the col. Absolutely beautiful. Over the top, and then a wild descent through twisting forest roads.

On the final morning I did a quick out-and-back up Montee de Valmorel. I grabbed a couple of baguette sandwiches from the local boulangerie for post ride and my return train journey.

The return journey was the same but in reverse. Disassembling the bike takes longer than assembling - you have to be careful protecting the frame and making sure everything slots together properly. The checklist was invaluable here. The journey back was smooth. A quick walk to station, the same efficient connections.

**Pros:**

* No bike freight costs or stress
* Total flexibility with timing
* Bike is always with you
* Train travel is genuinely lovely
* More sustainable than flying

**Cons:**

* Not for every bike setup - integrated cockpits would be problematic, and individual setups will be more or less feasible.
* The rucksack + bike bag combo is heavy and awkward. I’d maybe try a small foldable trolley next time.
* Standing room only Metro transfers was challenging
* Takes longer than flying

I'm lucky enough to live near a Piccadilly line station, so flying via Heathrow to Lyon or Geneva would be a viable option which I'll research further for next time. This would require a transfer by train or coach at the other end.

**What I'd Change:**

* Book hotel again (camping was too ambitious for logistics and the weather)
* Bring a Bluetooth speaker for the climbs to bring the festival vibe
* Do it with mates - solo was fine but this would be epic with a clan.

100% doing it again in 2026. The combination of watching the Tour in the mountains and riding the same roads is absolutely magical. The train journey makes it feel like a proper adventure rather than just a destination.

Happy to answer any questions!

1oa8bdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIMRFAM/comments/1oa8bdf/the_ultimate_daniel_meltdown_anal_confessions/,"The Ultimate Daniel Meltdown: Anal Confessions, Live Panic, and a Stream So Bad He Shut It Down Himself [18 Oct 2025]","Daniel's latest broadcast is a masterclass in squandered potential and pathetic grievance-farming, masquerading as content. The stream serves as a bleak tour through the mind of a man whose primary motivation is piggybacking on the drama of more successful creators. We witness the live, unedited, and profoundly lazy creation of a ""reaction video"" to the Chris Broad vs. Oriental Pearl feud, a desperate attempt to siphon views by injecting his own stale grudges into a current event. This creative lowlight is bookended by moments of fleeting, almost accidental, self-awareness—such as admitting his world revolves around women because he has no other source of happiness—which are immediately undermined by complaints that saving money is hard because he gets ""horny"" and ""lonely.""

The broadcast then descends into a technological tragicomedy as Daniel attempts to play a video game. What follows is a painful saga of technical incompetence, with his system overheating, his battery dying mid-stream, and the stream itself being accidentally terminated by his own knuckle. His gaming performance is a predictable spiral of initial confidence followed by rage-fueled declarations that the game is ""shit"" and ""boring."" The stream's final act is a rambling, self-pitying monologue featuring sad childhood bullying stories, bizarre sexual fantasies about parasitic women, and a fittingly chaotic panic when a website glitch convinces him he's finally been banned—a perfect, pathetic end to a broadcast defined by failure and absurdity.

### **2. Top-Tier Highlights (Most Schadenfreude-Inducing)**

*   **Confession: Admits His Adult Content Prevents a Normal Career**
    While lamenting his inability to get a job in Japan, Daniel matter-of-factly states that his past actions have made him unemployable in professional fields like teaching. He acknowledges the existence of his explicit content online, confessing, ""As if they're gonna hire me as a teacher in a school when I got pics of myself shoving stuff off my asshole. It's never gonna happen.""

*   **Misfortune: The Ultimate Gaming Meltdown and Accidental Shutdown**
    After initially celebrating that an Ethernet adapter fixed his gaming lag, Daniel's stream collapses into a technical nightmare. His laptop begins to overheat and throttle performance, dropping to an unplayable 20 FPS. He then discovers his laptop wasn't charging and was about to die. The climax of this failure occurs when he **accidentally ends the entire stream by hitting the ""end stream"" button on his laptop's touchscreen with his knuckle.**

*   **Absurdity: The Bizarre Parasitic Woman Fantasy**
    In a completely unprompted and bizarre tangent, Daniel shares a graphic idea for a ""parasite girl."" He describes a naked female creature that latches onto a host's face, blocking their breathing with her genitals and anus, only to sustain them by ""farting and shitting in your mouth."" He explains her motivation: ""Maybe her legs don't work, so she needs your body for locomotion.""

*   **Unintentional Comedy: The Lazy, Live ""Reaction Video"" Production**
    Daniel decides to cash in on drama by making a reaction video, but does so with zero effort. He records the entire thing live on stream, reacting with low-energy commentary, failing to get ""into character,"" and complaining about the number of ads in the video he is reacting to. He then uploads the raw, unedited footage directly to YouTube, admitting, ""I won't be bothered to edit it.""

*   **Misfortune: Panics and Assumes He's Banned from Kick**
    In the final moments of the stream, the Kick website glitches, preventing him from accessing his channel page. He immediately spirals into a panic, assuming the worst has happened. His frantic questions reveal his paranoia: ""Guys? Has it happened? Guys? You there? It says something's gone wrong. Is it time to start looking for a job?""

*   **Confession: Fleeting Epiphany on His Obsession with Women**
    Daniel has a moment of profound, if short-lived, self-awareness about his life's emptiness. He correctly identifies why he gets so emotionally destroyed by women, stating, ""I feel like getting so upset because you lost a woman is because you don't have anything else going on in life... your whole world revolves around them because it's like your only source of happiness, which is a problem, isn't it?""

### **3. Comprehensive Highlights (All Other Instances)**

**Damaging Drama & Gossip**

*   **Gossip: Slams Chris Broad's ""Stupid Fan Base"" and Territorial Attitude**
    While setting up his reaction video, Daniel unleashes on Chris Broad. He calls him a ""massive dick"" and criticizes him for being territorial. ""He's got his holier than thou, I'm so morally righteous... and his stupid fan base always just suck up to him as if he's right about every single damn thing.""

*   **Gossip: Accuses Chris Broad of Being a Liar**
    Daniel recounts a past incident where Chris Broad allegedly asked him to take down a critical video, promising to meet for drinks as a thank you. Daniel claims Chris never followed through, calling him a liar: ""He said we can go get some drinks... And then he came to Osaka and then he never hit me up for drinks because he's a liar.""

*   **Gossip: Describes Chris Broad’s Friend Group as ""All Dicks""**
    Reacting to Oriental Pearl feeling excluded, Daniel validates her by insulting Chris's entire social circle. He sneers, ""His stupid dumb friend group. All dicks. I don't have permission to be in his friend group.""

*   **Gossip: Claims Chihiro is Now a Tour Guide**
    He provides an update on his ex-wife, Chihiro, stating she has given up on YouTube. ""Apparently, she's a tour guide guiding tours in Japan. I wonder what company she works for. Maybe you can book her.""

*   **Gossip: Mocks Sora the Troll's Appearance**
    Daniel checks up on fellow streamer Sora and immediately begins insulting his face and haircut. ""His hair looks stupid... When I met him, I noticed his face is really big. Like, you look at him and then you think, that's a lot of face.""

*   **Gossip: Recounts a Violent Confrontation with Nobita**
    He brings up his old nemesis Nobita, claiming a past fight left them both with ""war wounds."" He gleefully adds, ""The good news was in hitting my head, he broke his little finger and disfigured it so badly, it's never fully recovered.""

*   **Gossip: Details an Affair with ""Pia"" Behind Her Boyfriend's Back**
    Daniel reminisces about the ""naughtiest"" girl he's been with, detailing how he and ""Pia"" repeatedly cheated. ""Every time me and Pia hooked up, one of us was in a relationship... I actually don't know what excuse she gave Cesium to let her stay the night in London with me.""

*   **Drama: Believes His Girlfriend Lied to Gain His Favor**
    He expresses suspicion about his girlfriend, claiming she lied about her accent to seem more appealing to him. ""I asked her how does she pronounce words like last, grass, fast, and then she said she pronounces it like I do... I wonder why she lied about that. Like, is it to gain my favor?""

**Confessions & Self-Incriminating Information**

*   **Confession: Admits He Farts When Scared, Like in Front of Police**
    Recalling an encounter with Japanese police, Daniel confesses to a bizarre physical reaction to fear. ""I kept farting. I don't know, it's like I really couldn't control my fart... It's like your body's preparing for a fight or something. Or maybe it's trying to... stink them out so you have an advantage. Skunk tactic.""

*   **Confession: Admits He Has No Willpower for Education or Work**
    While dismissing the idea of returning to school to get a degree, he admits he lacks the drive. ""I don't have the willpower. I can't be bothered. And I don't wanna teach English. I'd rather work in Tesco.""

*   **Confession: Admits He Fled Japan After Defaulting on an iPhone Contract**
    Daniel reveals he acquired an iPhone 4 by signing a contract with a Japanese provider, only to flee the country and stop paying. ""I got it on contract and then I fled the country and then cancelled the direct debit so I basically got it for nearly free.""

*   **Confession: Admits to Fantasizing About His Ex-Wife During Sex**
    He confesses to having performance issues with a past partner (""Faster"") and needing to fantasize about his ex-wife, Chihiro, to get an erection. ""I would like put my head into the pillow and not look at her... And then I'd like picture Chihiro or something and she noticed it.""

*   **Confession: Zinc Supplements Are Making Him Excessively Horny**
    Daniel shares overly personal details about the effects of zinc supplements on his libido and bodily functions. ""I feel like I'm CUMing more... It's like, making me hornier. I keep waking up in the middle of the night with my trousers down.""

**Emotional Outbursts & Rants**

*   **Rant: Complains He is Unprotected and Unfairly Punished**
    Daniel laments feeling persecuted by YouTube's policies, claiming he gets punished for actions others get away with. ""I feel like YouTube wouldn't even have my back. No one ever has my back... If I do it, I get fucked, but if they do it, nothing happens. No one protects me.""

*   **Rant: Curses His Viewers for Being ""Dickheads""**
    He complains that his audience only enjoys his suffering and never offers support, instead blaming him for his problems. ""There's no, 'oh, don't worry, Daniel.' It'll be okay. It's always just, 'you deserve it, and it's only your fault.' I've got such dickhead viewers.""

*   **Rant: Rage-Quits Battlefield, Calling it ""Shit""**
    After a string of in-game deaths, Daniel loses his temper completely. ""This game is shit... run here, get blown up, run there, get shot by a tank... and then it's so bright everywhere, can't even see anything.""

*   **Meltdown: Expresses Existential Despair and Boredom**
    After quitting the game, he spirals into a nihilistic rant about the pointlessness of life. ""Makes you think, is this it? Is this life? Is this all life has to offer? Eat clean. Sleep. Buy stuff.""

**Misfortunes & Fucked-Up Stuff**

*   **Misfortune: Forgets to Take Out the Trash for Weeks**
    Daniel complains about his deteriorating memory due to sickness, citing a significant domestic failure. ""I can't believe I forgot to put the rubbish out after waiting for weeks. Now I'll wait another two weeks.""

*   **Misfortune: Complains About His Mother's Lack of Support**
    He reveals that his mother offers no encouragement, instead telling him his relationship will fail and he should just move back home. ""My mom's not very good moral support. She's just like, 'oh, it's not gonna work.' Well, thanks. Really helpful.""

I started recording, thinking I’d catch a sweet moment.

Instead, she said no, got up, and left him with the ring

I was mortified. I stopped recording immediately and apologized. The guy actually laughed, handed me the ring, and said, “Maybe you’ll have better luck.” Then he walked off.

Now I’m standing there holding a literal engagement ring, in an airport. That’s when a random woman near the coffee stand yells:

“Is this where I line up to be proposed to?”

She’s beautiful, smiling, holding an iced coffee like she’s in a rom-com. I go with it, drop to one knee and say:

“Will you marry me... or at least split a pretzel?”

She says yes, to the pretzel.

We ended up on the same flight. Talked the whole time. I tweeted about it, and the story went viral. People online called us “Terminal Soulmates.”

We went on a real date the next week. And now?

She’s my girlfriend.

The ring’s still in her drawer.

And yes, she’s still demanding a pretzel proposal 2.0 when the real one happens.

TL;DR: Tried to record a proposal at the airport. She said no. The guy gave me the ring. I fake-proposed to a random girl as a joke. Now she’s my actual girlfriend. Internet went nuts.",6,1760823656.0,story,0,0.88,False

We moved to Mahogany a while back, and I’m blown away by how this community combines a laid-back lake lifestyle with the charm of a European-inspired center. If you’re thinking about moving here or just curious what it’s like, here’s what I’ve loved most so far:

 The Lake Life
- The private, family-friendly lake community is the heartbeat of Mahogany. Summers are all about:
  - Quiet walks along the shoreline at dusk
  - Paddleboarding and kayaking with friends
  - Beach days at the lake parks with shade sails and picnic spots
- Winter has its own magic: skating on the community rinks and long, cozy evenings by the fireplace in our homes or at local cafes.

European Centre Vibes
- The Mahogany Centre (the main hub) has this delightful European café-to-street vibe that makes you feel like you’re strolling through a charming European town.
- Picture-perfect terraces with string lights, outdoor seating, and a steady rotation of coffee shops, bakeries, and gelato spots.
- The architecture and cobblestone-like pathways really sell the European feel, without sacrificing Calgary practicality.

Coffee Culture & Terraces
- Coffee stops are plentiful and diverse:
  - Bright, sunlit cafés perfect for a laptop session
  - Rooftop terraces that catch the late afternoon sun
  - Cozy corners with plush seating for a good book or a catch-up with friends
- There’s something for every mood: a quick cappuccino, a fancy latte art session, or a slow Sunday brunch with friends.

 Why We Love It Here
- Sense of community: neighbors say hello, there are regular farmers markets, and plenty of family-friendly events.
- Accessibility: quick commutes to surrounding neighborhoods and easy access to the lake paths.
- Safety and upkeep: well-maintained common areas, clean streets, and active community associations.

What are your favorite spots around Mahogany Centre?
- Any tips for new residents about the best times to visit the lake or cafes?
- How do you balance city access with the lake-life vibe?",2,1760823646.0,MovingToYYCGr8info,0,1.0,False
1oa884g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1oa884g/discovered_guy_i_liked_is_genuinely_obsessed_with/,Discovered guy I liked is genuinely obsessed with me and I’m scared,"Warning this is gonna be long and kinda unsettling, trigger warning.

So basically in my first year I met a guy in my residency who was awesome. I had an immediate crush on him when I first met him, we spoke about the drums and bonded over music. The crush went away when I found out he had a girlfriend, they were in a really toxic relationship but I got along with them well separately. I had a hint that he may have been attracted to me even when in a relationship because him and I weren’t very close, but he would speak about me to others a lot. Apparently there was a time when someone mistook me for his girlfriend when he was speaking about me and he didn’t correct them? (First red flag). He would also apparently lie a lot about how close we were, saying that we hung out all the time and that we played the drums together (something we never did). I didn’t know about any of this at the time, but I liked speaking to him as he was always kind to me.

I didn’t speak to him over the summer but I got a text from him on the first day back, he told me he found me gorgeous and that he would love to go out with me. I was flattered but I was also going through a dark time of my life, I knew if I said yes I would’ve been too attached to him and it would’ve gotten toxic fast, so for the better of us both I went against my heart and said no. His now ex is in one of my classes and sat next to me on the first day, she told me how they broke up a few months ago because it was too toxic. We went out for coffee and kinda started hanging out, I really like being around her. I tried being friends with him, but he kept asking me out even though I kept saying no, now it wasn’t about my mental health but it was about me becoming close with his ex ; I could never date a friends ex, I wouldn’t do that to her even if I did really like him.

I got a text from one of his friends, he said he was worried about me because of the way he would speak about me. He would talk about me all the time and he told all of his friends that him and I are dating, then when asked more about it he said that eventually I would see that we are meant to be together. His friend said he seems like a sociopath and begged me not to date him for my own well being. I immediately texted him and gently but firmly laid down the line and told him we weren’t dating, he immediately got upset. He denied it at first, then admitted he said it when drunk and that he was “manifesting” and just “finds me so pretty and likes me so much” that he couldn’t help it. I told him that we are friends but nothing more and he agreed, we haven’t spoken in 2 weeks now. Apparently he threatened his friend who told me.

His ex was complaining about how toxic he was and I told her about what had been happening, she immediately said that she knew something like that was going to happen. Apparently she had to make him delete VSCO when they were together because he kept looking at my photos, she went on his computer and found a hidden folder full of pictures of me. He also tried to convince her to let us have a 3some, he also tried to have her dye her hair like mine 😬😬 he spoke about me so much that she was convinced we were having an affair and that’s part of why she broke up with him. This went on for over a year.  I’m still in shock hearing about it all, to hear about him doing those things behind my back when I thought we had an innocent friendship feels so dirty, I feel stupid because looking back it was so obvious he had strong feelings for me, but I would’ve never guess he would do those things.

My dad passed away from drug and alcohol addiction and I confided in him about it, he told me his mother suffered from addiction and that he understood me. It was all a lie, his mother has never done drugs according to his ex. He lied to connect with me. I’m scared of him, but I think it’s over, but I don’t know how to feel because his ex told me to be careful.",1,1760823599.0,Vent,1,1.0,False
1oa880b,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndustrialDesign/comments/1oa880b/feeling_lost_about_next_steps_masters_for_handson/,"Feeling lost about next steps: Masters for hands-on, impactful industrial/robotics/space design","Hey ID folks,

I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed and confused right now, so I thought I’d pause and get some perspectives.


I’m an industrial design student, and I’ve been working on projects that mix industrial design, robotics, and some space systems, like:

A modular keyboard inspired by retro-futuristic aerospace interface design.

A teach pendant redesign for robotics interfaces.

Self-initiated space exploration concepts because I have a strong passion for space and cosmos-related design.

A landslide early warning device system.


I’ve also done a robotics internship at a startup, so I have exposure to human-machine interaction, control interfaces, and system thinking. Basically, I love working on hands-on, impactful, Tony Stark-esque projects — not just product design for aesthetics or coffee machines. I also care about projects that have environmental/societal impact.


Here’s where I’m stuck:

I’ve been researching masters programs globally — human-centered design, interaction design, industrial design engineering, robotics, space systems, even AI — and honestly, I don’t know which path is the smartest. I want a program that lets me follow my passion for design, systems, and innovation, not just conventional product design. I want to be an innovator, not just a designer.


But I also need to think about long-term job market, work opportunities, and salary potential, so it’s not just about passion. Some things I’ve noticed:

U.S. programs in HCI, robotics, space systems, etc., have great career paths, but visa costs and settlement risks make it tricky.

Europe has prestigious programs (TU Delft, Politecnico di Milano, Royal College of Art, Aalto University), but job markets are competitive, and staying after graduation is often difficult.

UAE programs are growing in AI and robotics, but design-focused programs aren’t as established and often lean heavily on UX/digital work. I prefer hands-on, invention-driven projects, not just screen-based work.

Or if there are other countries to look into do give me insights on that

Basically, I’m trying to figure out a path that balances my passion for hands-on, innovative design and systems with sustainable career growth — financially, geographically, and professionally.



I’d really appreciate honest perspectives, advice, or experiences that could help me figure out my next steps.

Breakfast - the usual porridge, with soya milk alongside yogurt and berries. Today I allowed myself slurp in my coffee!! (I love coconut and got vanilla for tomorrow) 10/10

Snack - fresh sourdough, butter, marmite with two babybels (not a massive marmite fan I have decided its okay but VERY strong I love twiglets though) 6.5/10

Lunch - Ham and small bit of cheese in a fresh baguette (I did an ED behaviour at this meal as getting a white baguette freaked me a little :( so I think getting sandwiches pre-made maybe better for now), salt and vinegar crisps, tomatoes and an orange 8/10

Snack - Subway rainbow cookie, so good but small lol 10/10

Dinner - Savoury mince, champ and veg 9/10

Dessert - Lindt, milk bottles, chewy Percys and jelly babies with dad - jelly babies were dads favourite - I love the milk bottles 10/10

Snack - sourdough, jam, butter with yogurt and fruit, banana again! 10/10

Extra to say FU ED - almonds 

A good day, but I feel like my intake might have been a little lower today because I didn't allow myself to snack on any almonds (until very last min) or have any 'extras' - still stuck to the plan 100% but I just found the food noise so overwhelming today because believe it or not I am still hungry on all this food lol and am struggling with food indecision because I just want it all.

1oa87sr,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1oa87sr/crazy_grind_inconsistency_lagom_p64/,Crazy grind inconsistency [Lagom P64],"I bought a Lagom P64 + Linea Micra \~1 year ago and have made 2-4 coffees per day ever since. I had to reach out to Option-O for a replacement Lagom because of an issue with the first one that didn't allow me to change the grind setting. They replaced it \~9 months ago and I've been using the new one ever since.

My puck prep is pretty standard (18g in, 2-3 sprays for static, WDT, pressure tamper), yet I found it impossible to dial in my beans no matter how much tweaking I did. I'm constantly baffled by the shots - one day to the next, or one shot to the next, the same grind setting might yield 5+ seconds difference. The shots rarely taste good.

I finally ended up buying a DF64 II to see if it was an issue with the Lagom. Lo and behold, all of a sudden I can pull shot after shot, day after day with minimal difference and great flavors.

I would appreciate any advice on figuring out the root cause of my grinder inconsistency.

I have reached out to Option-O but they are slow to respond. It's extremely disappointing to have such a poor experience given the cost of the grinder. Do not recommend Option-O given the QC issues I've seen.",1,1760823576.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I've never been to Romania before (never farther east than Budapest, though I travel the rest of Europe (and Asia) extensively) and after quite a bit of research on Reddit and elsewhere, I built the following itinerary.

All hotels, trains, and car rentals are booked, mostly I'm interested in what people think about the Transylvania touring bet. days 10 and 17, though thoughts about Bucharest and Timisoara are welcome. Budget is not a big issue, also I'm a US passport holder, if it matters.

I'm very much into art, culture, architecture, nature, like to walk and hike, food and drink (cocktails/whiskey over wine and beer), don't care about night life, love coffee and tea culture. I also love train travel, am very much looking forward to the sleeper bet. Bucharest and Timisoara. I wanted to stick with trains the whole way, but after some discussions on r/travel and looking at the construction on the CFR lines, I decided to just get a car for a week (already got my IDP). Sadly, the Transfagarasan through the Alps will be closed, but I may still go a part of the north end (see day 13).

* Day 1 - Land in OTP (late night), check in to hotel (Old Town)
* Day 2 - Free day in Bucharest (Old Town wandering), board sleeper at night (Astra Trans Carpatic) to Timisoara
* Day 3 - Arrive early morning, free until afternoon (work)
* Days 4-7 - Work (afternoon of day 7 is free)
* Day 8 - Free day in Timisoara, board sleeper at night to Bucharest
* Day 9 - Free day in Bucharest, walking tour (booked)
* Day 10 - Free morning, pick up car at OTP (past noon), drive to Sibiu, check into hotel (4 nights)
* Day 11 - Alba Lulia (2hrs) > Sarmizegetusa Ulpia Traiana (1hr) > Corvin Castle (2hrs) > Deva (2hrs) > back to Sibiu
* Day 12 - Salina Turda (4hrs) > Cluj Napoca (5 hrs) > back to Sibiu
* Day 13 - Biertan (1hr) > Sighisoara (5hrs) > Balea waterfall, maybe cable car (2hrs) > back to Sibiu
* Day 14 - Morning in Sibiu (Christmas markets open!), afternoon Old Town tour (booked), check out, drive to Brasov, check into hotel (3 nights)
* Day 15 - Free day in Brasov, walking tour (booked)
* Day 16 - Bran Castle (1-2hrs--I don't really care about this stop that much) > Sinaia (rest of day) > back to Brasov
* Day 17 - Drive back to OTP, return car. Check into airport hotel, spend the rest of the day at Therme
* Day 18 - Fly out of OTP (stupidly early flight)

I don't think I packed in too much other than days 11-13, esp. day 11. I may skip Sarmizegetusa as it's about an hour's drive out of the way, and spend that time at Corvin and Deva. I'd love some feedback and additional suggestions! Thanks.",1,1760823550.0,Europetravel,4,1.0,False

Ive been drinking instant coffee all my life. Didn't understand black coffee earlier but have been a fan of it since past few months. Currently I make it with instant coffee only (Nescafe or davidoff). Ik instant coffee isn't great and I want to have better coffee, I just don't know where to start. I don't want to spend to much in a workflow that I don't follow. I want to start small and hopefully continue on this path and later I don't mind investing in expensive equipment. 
So basically I want to know where I can start. Do I get ground coffee and french press/mochapot. Is ground coffee good enough upgrade from instant coffee or do I need to get a grinder? Ive heard mochapots are difficult to clean and all. Also I don't want the filter coffe pot thing. I don't want this just for black coffee, I like adding milk to my coffee every now and then.

So basically in my first year I met a guy in my residency who was awesome. I had an immediate crush on him when I first met him, we spoke about the drums and bonded over music. The crush went away when I found out he had a girlfriend, they were in a really toxic relationship but I got along with them well separately. I had a hint that he may have been attracted to me even when in a relationship because him and I weren’t very close, but he would speak about me to others a lot. Apparently there was a time when someone mistook me for his girlfriend when he was speaking about me and he didn’t correct them? (First red flag). He would also apparently lie a lot about how close we were, saying that we hung out all the time and that we played the drums together (something we never did). I didn’t know about any of this at the time, but I liked speaking to him as he was always kind to me.

I didn’t speak to him over the summer but I got a text from him on the first day back, he told me he found me gorgeous and that he would love to go out with me. I was flattered but I was also going through a dark time of my life, I knew if I said yes I would’ve been too attached to him and it would’ve gotten toxic fast, so for the better of us both I went against my heart and said no. 
His now ex is in one of my classes and sat next to me on the first day, she told me how they broke up a few months ago because it was too toxic. We went out for coffee and kinda started hanging out, I really like being around her. I tried being friends with him, but he kept asking me out even though I kept saying no, now it wasn’t about my mental health but it was about me becoming close with his ex ; I could never date a friends ex, I wouldn’t do that to her even if I did really like him. 

I got a text from one of his friends, he said he was worried about me because of the way he would speak about me. He would talk about me all the time and he told all of his friends that him and I are dating, then when asked more about it he said that eventually I would see that we are meant to be together. His friend said he seems like a sociopath and begged me not to date him for my own well being. I immediately texted him and gently but firmly laid down the line and told him we weren’t dating, he immediately got upset. He denied it at first, then admitted he said it when drunk and that he was “manifesting” and just “finds me so pretty and likes me so much” that he couldn’t help it. I told him that we are friends but nothing more and he agreed, we haven’t spoken in 2 weeks now. Apparently he threatened his friend who told me.

His ex was complaining about how toxic he was and I told her about what had been happening, she immediately said that she knew something like that was going to happen. Apparently she had to make him delete VSCO when they were together because he kept looking at my photos, she went on his computer and found a hidden folder full of pictures of me. He also tried to convince her to let us have a 3some, he also tried to have her dye her hair like mine 😬😬 he spoke about me so much that she was convinced we were having an affair and that’s part of why she broke up with him. This went on for over a year.  I’m still in shock hearing about it all, to hear about him doing those things behind my back when I thought we had an innocent friendship feels so dirty, I feel stupid because looking back it was so obvious he had strong feelings for me, but I would’ve never guess he would do those things. 

My dad passed away from drug and alcohol addiction and I confided in him about it, he told me his mother suffered from addiction and that he understood me. It was all a lie, his mother has never done drugs according to his ex. He lied to connect with me. I’m scared of him, but I think it’s over, but I don’t know how to feel because his ex told me to be careful.",1,1760823416.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

1oa835x,https://i.redd.it/75tecktkvxvf1.jpeg,What is going on with the handheld gaming revolution?,"The Steam Deck wasn't the first handheld device, but it kickstarted the entire craze. Once the big hardware manufacturers saw how successful the Deck was, they got greedy and started pumping out their own handhelds. However, they completely missed the point from day one by launching devices at premium prices, unlike the Steam Deck. Over time, these companies have only strayed further from the original goal.

​The whole point was to create devices that were less powerful than a gaming PC but could run all games, including AAA titles. Some games needed optimization, but developers loved this idea. They were incredibly collaborative with Valve. Besides boosting sales, developers were excited to bring their games to a Linux environment, potentially opening up the gaming world to a huge new audience. The combination of a relatively affordable price and portability was also a game changer.

​But then, these other companies piled in. They started churning out ridiculous devices with absurd prices. Look, it doesn't matter if you cram 150GB of RAM and a million-teraflop GPU in there. There's a hard limit to the power these devices can draw and the performance they can actually deliver. They will never match the output of a proper laptop or desktop.

​For a while, they managed to fool some people with their marketing hype, but gamers are catching on. A certain awareness has set in. Not many people are shelling out nearly $1000 for an Asus ROG Ally X. Very few gamers are giving Lenovo $1300 for a Go 2, which is enough to build a decent system with a 5070. For a perfect example of this failure: the top-end MSI Claw A1M launched at $799 and was seen on clearance for under $350 in less than a year.

​Meanwhile, the Steam Deck, which on paper is a fraction as powerful as these devices, is estimated to have outsold all of them combined. Hopefully, the others will wake up and smell the coffee.

​Instead of focusing on a hardware race, they would have been much better off working with game developers on optimization and porting games for handheld PCs. Thankfully, Steam still gives us hope on that front. If the Deck 2 gets announced next year, you know that's what everyone will be waiting for.",8,1760823258.0,Handhelds,26,0.62,False

Today I was walking in the city center near the shops, and I saw two people stopping to greet each other at right at the narrowest part of a sidewalk under construction... literally the worst spot possible... and they stopped there to greet each other like long-lost cousins, completely oblivious to the angry crowd piling up on both sides...

And in bars it’s the same story. This morning a guy with a big backpack ordered his coffee, got it, and just stood *right there* at the counter drinking it exactly where the barista serves people instead of moving at least 1m to the right so that the next person could order/pay.

I (30f) am a first time business owner and have no friends or family with any related experience, so I am seeking someone smarter than me, with more experience, to mentor me along the way. Ideally someone who has thoroughly enjoyed their career already and looking to give back. 

I generally have things handled (so I think), but I would definitely prefer having a second pair of eyes and someone wiser than me who knows the ropes. The business I’m working on now is just a “demo lab” / launching pad for the larger projects in development (in the health/tech sector), all of which have already received interest from some big names. If successful, this will make broad, lasting change. 

If this is where your passion lies, and you’re not afraid of a very ambitious, hard-working young woman, then please let me know!

My hope is that anyone else in the throes of debilitating anxiety and panic can get some amount of comfort, guidance, or perspective on what they are going through. I read a great deal of posts when looking for comfort, and I thank those who were vulnerable enough to share. (Sorry for the length)

As a background on myself, I’m 25, and was diagnosed with GAD at 6 after a long string of nurse visits where I kept worrying I was getting sick (got the really bad flu the year prior). I’ve battled anxiety my whole life, and got on medication at 14 after a depressive episode, and have been managing it ever since with medication and therapy. I have made it a goal to never let anxiety keep me from experiencing life, and I have done a great deal of things that I never thought I could in my worst moments. I was a good athlete in high school, I did speech and debate, met a girl who later became my wife, went to college, and even got a job in sales (time will tell if this was a smart move lol).

Since my first major mental health crisis at 14 when I truly realized what GAD meant for me, and how it could do great harm to my well-being if not managed, I’ve done a decent job at learning to cope and understand myself. There have definitely been panic attacks, over reactions, and catastrophizing, through many experiences, but I’ve managed to persist with time and patience until these past two weeks.

The chain of events that set off my spiral started two Saturdays ago at a friend's/co-worker's wedding. This wedding came in the midst of a great deal of pressure with work, my job search, my wife looking to go back to school, and a move in our future, and without realizing it, I was sitting on a powder keg. The wedding went great up until the reception. Drinks with friends, celebrating the love of two good people, reminiscing on my own love with my wife, and genuinely having a good time. The trouble started when the reception got in full swing and devolved into a wild party. Lots of noise and music (great band btw), laughing, lights, and drinks, and after a few songs, I could feel myself running on E. I tried my coping strategies to calm myself, but I could feel myself getting agitated and withdrawn, and I wanted to dip. My wife, on the other hand, really wanted to stay and enjoy the party. I tried to convince her to leave, not yet realizing the urgency, and she begged to stay. As we debated and argued, I immediately became acutely aware that people may be witnessing our argument and I began to feel my blood run cold. I literally started to beg for her to come with me, and seeing I was serious, she joined. 

Once in the car, the panic hit, and I began to shake and tear up. I was embarrassed, I argued with my wife, I let down my friends, and people noticed me being uncomfortable. My wife agreed we should head home, and we left. The next day the shame and anxiety was severe, and the post-panic attack hangover was in full swing. I texted my friend to let him know I was sorry for leaving early (doubt he realized, more focused on his new wife), but that I had a panic attack and had to head out. He texted back that he understood and was just glad we could make it, and I started to feel better. 

The general low mood lasted for about 2.5 days, and I could start to feel myself come back and get to my routine, which was just in time for a big job interview that I had. A former co-worker of mine had recommended me for a position that would see a substantial pay raise and more opportunities, and I was excited but nervous. I put a lot of pressure on this interview since it was a mock customer call, and spent hours building slides and prepping. Finally comes the day of the call and the morning starts off a tad negative. A co-worker of mine had been let go, and I had like a 45-minute gripe sesh with a teammate on the state of affairs at our company. The whole thing put me in a poor headspace and added additional pressure to the call.

The afternoon arrives and it’s time for my call. I feel nervous, but prepared and start things off as I normally do with greetings etc. We kick off the roleplay and I do my fake intro to the “prospective clients”, when suddenly a random thought passes through my mind. “What if you panic and fuck this up.” It immediately felt like someone poured a cold glass of water down my back, and I froze. They talked, but I could hardly hear, and I fumbled over my words, and I realized I was having a full-blown panic attack on this call. Never in all my years of public speaking have I completely frozen on a call in a noticeable way. I’ve gotten dry mouth, sweated a little, even stuttered a few times, but it must have looked like I had a mini aneurysm.

I immediately went into survival mode and contemplated just leaving the call, but I looked down at the paper and decided to cling to my notes and slides. What ensued was the stiffest and most unengaging sales roleplay of all time, and I knew it. They gave their feedback and could tell they were trying to be nice, but knew I wouldn’t be moved on to the next round.

I quickly texted my wife that it went poorly and I felt immense panic and despair, made even worse when I remembered we were meeting my sister for dinner, who was in town. I only see her a couple of times a year, and I knew I couldn’t cancel, but I felt like I was hanging by a thread. We leave for dinner, and I’m immediately catastrophizing and giving meaning to the events of that day. “I’ve lost my confidence,” “What if I do this on calls with my own customers and lose my job” etc. We get to dinner, and I try to pull myself together in the car before walking in, and my wife suggests I be open about where I’m at with my sister. My sister is going to be a nurse and was actually in town to take her RN exam, and struggled with mental health in a lot of the same ways I did. Dinner actually made me feel better, and my sister even opened up about her mental health. I was able to salvage some amount of that night, unaware that I’m about to have the worst 48hrs of my life.

	I awake mid panic attack at 1 am. Immediately, I’m back to my line of thinking from right after the interview. “You’re going to freak out on a call tomorrow with your customer, and eventually lose your job”. Stress was already high at work, with overhiring of reps, with likely layoffs in our future and with my current performance, I could go either way. From there, I spiraled, “my wife won’t be able to go to school, and we won't be able to move, we’ll lose our healthcare, and have to move back in with our parents.” 

The panic was so severe that I could not sleep and had to wake up my wife. I felt like my life had ended from a bad interview, and it was just the beginning of ruining everything I’ve built. The panic came in ceaseless waves, and there was no coping. No amount of self-talk, calming music, breathing, or anything kept the thoughts from coming. These were thoughts I’ve had before, but never believed, and I truly thought they were real and factual. After trying to watch cartoons nearly all night, I managed to snag an hour of sleep, and my wife and I both called out of work. My wife tried to console me and hold me, but I could not feel any other emotion but impending doom and despair. My daily SSRI and propranolol were doing nothing to quell the panic, and after an emergency appointment with my therapist, she recommended I seek medical help from either my psychiatrist (ideal), PCP, or emergency room.

I messaged my psychiatrist and doctor, but both went straight to VM, so we opted to go to the minor emergency down the street in hopes they’d have something to make me sleep or calm down. Unfortunately, the doctor they had working that day might have been the worst person to deal with a mental health crisis possible, as she was rude, judgmental, and basically said either you go home to ride this out, or commit yourself to a mental hospital. The hopelessness I felt was even worse than before. I had to choose between a mental hospital or this unbearable suffering, and I sobbed along with my wife in that hospital while that doctor stood stonefaced. She said the only thing she could prescribe was hydroxyzine, which I gladly took, and we went back home to try to think about what to do next.

	To skip forward a bit for the sake of brevity, I was able to get an emergency appointment with a different psych at the practice I go to, who assured me he could help, but it would require effort on my part. He told me that there is not pill that can cure anxiety, but he could help me sleep, and give me a foothold to climb out of the hole I felt I was in. 

The next 24hrs were a haze of being both anxious and doped out of my mind, which wasn’t worse than where I was, but it wasn’t better. I just wanted to be back to my old self. The next day, my wife told my family about what had happened at my request. I spoke with my mom on the phone, who was there for me during my first mental health crisis 11 years prior. She never suffered from mental illness; all that fell to my dad's side of the family, who all have different flavors of anxiety and melancholy, though they manage it with good ol silence. Through my mental health struggles as a teen, they slowly learned to soften their “rub some dirt in it” mentality and gave me grace and love when I needed it. My mom gave me a good pep talk that I won’t write out, but this gist is that I need to take baby steps and be kind to myself, but that getting better would be hard and require me to be uncomfortable. In those times when I feel like I can’t get out of bed, I need to put my pants on one leg at a time and live my life in spite of it all. 

Things were very hard at first; doing something as simple as the dishes felt like a daunting task. All I wanted to do was lie on the couch, watch cartoons, and rot, but I knew I would only be numbing myself and not getting any better. I should also mention that this was my wife's birthday weekend, which was an IMMENSE source of guilt during this time. Imagine being excited to celebrate your birthday with family and friends, but you have to stay home and care for a 6ft, 200lb, blubbering manchild. Though I know she would never describe what she did in such harsh terms, I wanted to do everything in my power to give her a semblance of life outside of the house, even if it killed me.

The improvement started truly with a walk in the park. I was terrified of going outside to this beautiful park and having a panic attack while people tried to enjoy their day, but I made a concerted effort to focus on my senses and not my thoughts. I had to pry myself from the thoughts of doubt, fear, and doom to something as simple as watching the ducks waddle by on the grass. I listened to the sound of children playing, birds chirping, and for the first time in many days, I looked over at the beautiful woman holding my hand and thought about how good I had it. Though my thoughts told me the world was falling, my body told me I was walking through the park on a sunny day with my wife. 

From there, the momentum built, and I became determined to chase these positive feelings. I tried to stay active around the house and focused on the task at hand. Cleaning the floors, folding laundry, and doing anything I would work on with my hands. I had whipped myself up into a frenzy of positive energy, but I was just so happy to feel as close to my old self as I had in nearly a week. During this period, I had developed waking anxiety, which I’ve never had before in my life, and getting my day started was like triaging an old car engine. I had to do some combination of meds, mindfulness, tasks, and usually the cloud would start to part in my head between 9:30am-12pm. Falling asleep became hard because of this; I just didn’t want to lose all these positive feelings and momentum, so my sleep became out of whack.

Over the course of about 4 days, I went from constant panic attacks, feeling like my life and future were ruined, and that I’d need to seek FMLA before inevitably losing my job, to working and getting back to my life. I still have much to recover from, though, and my journey with my mental health is far from over. 

	It’s been one full week of trying to get back to my life since all this occurred, and through therapy and self-reflection, I have learned a great deal about the events that created this anxiety powder-keg without even realizing it. I am by no means “cured”, far from it in fact, but I’m taking it one day at a time. Mornings have gotten easier; my anxiety about work, though high, has become more manageable, and I feel some enjoyment from thinking about the future again.

**The Powder Keg**

For the past several months, I have been grappling with my job overhiring salespeople and shrinking territories, with a likely RIF coming down the pipe. My performance so far has been subpar, but the pressure I’ve put on myself has likely hurt my performance more than help. On top of an impending move out of state, my wife is planning to start a master's program, and a shit ton of social obligations lined up every weekend from now till the start of winter, it was a wonder this all didn’t happen sooner. These trigger events, while legit, were likely just the straw that broke this camel's back. I also smoke cannabis several times a week and pound coffee like water (probably consumed 400mg a day), which is horrible for someone like me. 

**Things I’ve Learned**

1. Many of the times I thought I was “recharging,” I was in fact not. I was either just being anxious somewhere else other than my house, or doom-scrolling to numb myself. Relaxation will actually require practice for me, and it’s something I can’t afford to not do.
2. Limit caffeine intake and cannabis usage. I’m limiting myself to a single 6-8oz cup a day, and can have a little green now and again, but I’ve felt like ⅔ of the time I’ve embibed lately I just get more anxious, so maybe once in a blue moon.
3. Mindfulness needs to become as routine for me, just like exercise or brushing my teeth. I’ve taken to morning walks around my park before work, and focusing on my senses, not my thoughts.
4. Compartmentalization is a must for work going forward. Banishing thoughts outright isn’t effective, but ensuring your mind that you will address them at the appropriate time seems to scratch that itch for me sometimes. Many of the topics I would discuss in therapy were just the symptoms of the real problem. I need to challenge or reframe thoughts going forward, instead of just tamping them down. The rebound effect is real.
5. I need to give myself permission to not manage people’s emotions, and realize listening to my body IS in the best interest of others. Hiding my discomfort in large social gatherings that make me uncomfortable is kinda a staple of mine. I need to never stop trying to attend these because of the experiences I may miss, but I need to recognize when my body is telling me to leave and not feel like I’m hurting someone's feelings.
6. I have more supportive people in my life than I realized, and I’m blessed to have a wonderful wife, family, and friends who were there to lend an ear and not judge. Double-tapping on my wife again (insert innuendo lol), she is a hell of a woman, and I’m so lucky to have her by my side.

**What I’m Working On/Struggling With**

1. Fear of having other panic attacks still looms in my mind. Despite my having been on several work calls without issue, I fear I’ll panic mid-call and freak out at work. I plan to work more on this in therapy and find better medications to 
2. Struggling to separate my job from who I am as a person. I often conflate the two as being synonymous, but realizing that there is a possibility I’ve been dealt a shit hand at work and I’m just doing my best. If they let me go, I can soundly say I’ve done everything I can.
3. Medication changes are likely in the future, but I need to stabilize before doing so. Everything my psych provided is for the intention of short-term use, and I don’t believe my daily SSRI (fluvoxamine) is for me.



I wrote this mostly for myself to just document and look back at this time in my life, and maybe to offer some comfort or guidance for anyone going through something similar. Life is worth living, and things are almost never as bad as they seem. Failure happens despite our best efforts, so there is no point in trying to anticipate the next one. For people like us, relaxation needs to be learned; it is not innate, and it can be damn hard sometimes to just be. But through practice, support, and likely a little chemical intervention, you can be happy.

(33M, somewhere between 5'6'' and 6', forgot it exactly but average weight according to my doctor, white)

For a few years now, I've had poor health, proceeded by shortness of breath and panic attacks a couple Christmases ago. It then got worse after vomiting once, with other ailments popping up like acid reflux. Since then, I've had numerous visits to my GP and done tests for those issues, and so far;

\-It's definitely not bowel cancer or a parasite,

\-My liver and kidneys are fine, according to an ultrasound,

\-My heartrate has been a little above average but not unusual,

\-My blood is perfectly good, no sign of ailments or conditions like diabetes,

\-and my stool and urine tests came back clear.

After all that, my doctor suggests it's just anxiety, and given me advice to rest and try to relax, plus something for the indigestion.

I am inclined to believe that; certain symptoms line up with anxiety, I'm sure the initial attacks were due to that, one treatment was anxiety medication for a time, and my work and life lately has been pretty hectic with changes and things; not awful stuff, just big significant ones. And of course, the world's state right now, but I digress.

However, I'm not so sure about it causing *all* of this;

\-Nearly everything I eat nowadays has me feeling sickly, ranging from a little off to full aching pains, especially foods I used to enjoy and handle well; even healthier things and *water* no matter the origin,

\-It's to the point where I have to take numerous anti-indigestion things throughout the day to keep it settled, from peppermints and ginger to pharmacy remedies like Rennies and Gaviscon,

\-Most of the time I'm constipated, to the point where I'm straining so much and almost risking an aneurysm **just** to push the equivalent of a bean out, and that's probably compounding the issues. Which is dumb when there's been times I *can* go smoothly and easily,

\-Back to the sickly feeling, it sometimes feels like I want to vomit, but don't or can't; to the point of being afraid to cough, just in case,

\-A lot more wind to go with this, primarily belching,

\-Some nights, I have to prop myself up in bed, because it feels like acid's coming up into my oesophagus when I'm horizontal.

\-And most recently, my throut feels like stuff isn't going down completely sometimes, like some little crumb hangs on for a bit and irritates me.

I will admit, I'm not the healthiest eater, but I have been trying to be better lately because of this with more greens and fiber, and aside from a coffee, nearly all my drinks are water now. Also, I've only actually vomited that one time when it was starting off, and haven't since despite the feelings.

I'm just getting fed up of this nonsense going on with me 24/7, and I'm worried it's **more** than just my brain being extra stupid and telling the rest of my organs to act up.

Start with “Nya” for normal awareness, then add syllables to escalate: “Nynya” for shared awareness, “Nynynya” for collective, “Nynynynya” for planetary. The more you repeat, the more people think you’re casting a spell.

At the coffee shop, instead of saying “I need coffee,” try “Nynynynya lora teya” while staring at your empty cup. Watch as the barista slowly backs away. At work, during a boring meeting, whisper “Shishishira lora!” and see who starts recording you.

The key is to deliver it with total seriousness. The language’s gentle vowel elongations and soft consonants make even nonsense sound profound. People will either think you’re a wizard or a spiritual guru—either way, you’ve successfully confused them.

A different view of the girls in ABBA

 

Everyday life for ABBA's girls. Agnetha and Annifrid are now rehearsing dances for a PR film that will present ABBA's two new songs, ""Fernando"" and ""Dancing Queen"", both by the trio Ulvaeus-Andersson-Anderson. The choreographer is Graham Tainton. The film is made by Lasse Hallström and will be shown in those countries where ABBA don't have time to go.

\--

Sleep problems

Nightmares

Childcare

Dance training

Cleaning

\--

This is the gray everyday life for ABBA's girls, Agnetha Fältskog, 26, and Annifrid Lyngstad, 30: Dance rehearsals. Domestic roles with washing dishes, laundry, cooking and childcare.

Depressive thoughts of not being enough. Sleep problems.

It's a far cry from the glitz and glamour of the big stages and international tours around the world.

\- Actually, we're probably like everyone else, they say. It just happens that we have a different job.

During an interview like this, they sit relaxed with a cup of coffee, no one smokes. They don't seek protection from each other; they answer questions directly and with experience.

They know each other as well as a pair of sisters can. They have nothing to say that the other doesn't already know.

\- Well, that's probably how we feel, they say. Like a kind of sibling community. That's also why the four of them in ABBA, who represent two families, never meet in private.

Actually, we don't like each other,” says Annifrid, trying to hide a twinkle in her eye. So don't believe her.

 

SLEEPING PROBLEMS

 

These years with ABBA have already taken a toll: both Agnetha and Annifrid are suffering from sleep problems.

\- It's terrible, says Agnetha. You lie awake and think, and the longer you stay awake, the more desperate you become.

\- I must get up early for Linda's sake, I know I can't stay until twelve. Linda is Agnetha and Björn Ulvaeus' now three-year-old daughter.

\- I have nightmares, says Annifrid. Both believe that these problems are due to pressure from outside. The pressure on them and ABBA, to always be good or to be even better. The stress of work, the hard and boring trips.

After all, ABBA is life for Agnetha and Annifrid. How long can the group function? - As long as possible, says Annifrid quickly.

\- As long as Björn and Benny can write songs, says Agnetha. -But who knows, add Annifrid, just as it is, maybe ABBA is up your throat. And then you might have to think again.

Agnetha and Annifrid don't have time for anything other than home and ABBA.

They have dancing as a hobby, but it's also part of their work. Anni-Frid would like to study languages, she doesn't have time, Agnetha would like to have time for exercise, swimming, etc., but it's the same there. There's not enough time.

If it hadn't been ABBA, where would Agnetha and Annifrid be today?

\-I worked as a clerk before I started singing, says Agnetha. But I would never have continued with that. Maybe I would have worked with children or become a dental nurse. But I would have certainly written songs even then.

I can't think of anything else, says Annifrid firmly.

 

EQUAL HOME ROLES

 

The roles at home are pretty much the same for both.

Agnetha and Björn live in a villa in Lidingö and have a daughter, Linda. She requires constant care. When the group is out and about, she has a nanny 24/7. -Linda means wonderful relaxation for me, says Agnetha. When she is at home, the workday starts at six or seven in the morning. Like for all other parents. For Annifrid and Benny Andersson, who live in Gamla stan, the roles are slightly different but still the same.

Annifrid has two children, Liselotte, 9, and Hans, 13. They live in Eskilstuna. But she has them with her every weekend, during all the holidays and in the summer. - I experience that as the greatest happiness there is, says Annifrid.

\-Of course, ABBA is an important item for me, but the children come first no matter what.

 

SHARING THE CHORES

 

In both homes, the chores are pretty much divided between them , fifty-fifty.

\-Benny has so much to do, says Annifrid, so I'll probably be the one cleaning most, even though it's not that fun. But he likes to cook.

Björn does that too, says Agnetha. More than I do. So, he often makes dinner.

And who's doing the dishes? Agnetha grins:

Nobody at all, she says. We both have dishwashers. But someone must take care of them too...

Nothing glamorous, but we’ve got free coffee, decent coworkers, and a boss who thinks “casual Fridays” make him relatable.

Anyway, a few months ago, I started coming in early. Like, *really early*. I’m a night owl with insomnia, so sometimes I’d just drive to work at 4 AM, sit in my car, and wait for the day to start. Then I figured, hey — the doors are unlocked for cleaning staff — might as well go in and get a head start.

Nobody noticed for a while. Then one morning, one of the cleaners, Rosa, saw me and got startled. I apologized and explained, “Oh, just couldn’t sleep.” She laughed, said “You work too much,” and that was that.

But apparently, **rumors started.**

Fast forward a week, and I notice people whispering. Someone left a granola bar on my desk with a sticky note that said, “For breakfast :)” which was… odd.

Then our HR manager, Julia, emailed me:

>

I was like ???

Turns out **someone saw me brushing my teeth in the bathroom at 5 AM.** I keep a toothbrush at work because coffee. But to them, that looked like I was… living there.

I tried to clarify it to a few people. “No, no, I just get here early.”  
But it somehow turned into *“He’s embarrassed, don’t press him.”*

Then the company decided to do this *massive anonymous charity drive* — “for an employee in need.”  
They raised **over $2,000.**

And they gave it to me. In a sealed envelope.  
With a note that said, “You’re part of our family. No one should struggle alone.”

I. Wanted. To. Die.

I didn’t even know how to correct it at that point. How do you tell your boss, “Hey, thanks for thinking I’m homeless, but I’m just weird”?

So… I did the cowardly thing: I accepted it. I took the envelope, said thank you, and used it to buy a new laptop.

A few weeks later, corporate sends an email about “Employee Spotlight Stories,” featuring me — under the title:

They literally wrote a paragraph about how “despite personal hardship, he never missed a day of work and remained positive.”

My coworkers started bringing me food. One guy gave me an old blanket “for the car.” I tried to insist I had an apartment, but no one believed me.

So now I’m just leaning into it. I come in at 5 AM, make oatmeal in the breakroom, hum sad songs. People smile at me like I’m a *trooper.*

1oa7lm5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oa7lm5,First ever market was a success! Would still love some tips to get even better!,"Hi everyone! I had my first ever market today and I think it was pretty successful. I sell quilted and block printed bags as well as some block print postcards and larger prints for the wall. I didn’t sell as many bags and I had hoped but my smaller items sold way faster than I anticipated and really made up for the fast that my bigger items weren’t moving. 

This was a small market in a coffee shop with about 10 vendors total so I wasn’t expecting too much. This was the first event that the coffee shop put on and there was no fee for entry (in fact they gave us free coffee!). I sold 3 bags totaling to $110 and made about $90 in postcards, prints, and mini keychain bags. I was really surprised to see what people liked and even sold out of one of my prints that I hid near the back because I didn’t think it would sell very well. 

In the pictures I have stuff behind my rack for bags and I ended up moving it out of view so my area looked cleaner before the market started. I know I need to get a table cloth, but I would love to hear what other tips people have for me in terms of products, pricing, set up, and display.

Nothing glamorous, but we’ve got free coffee, decent coworkers, and a boss who thinks “casual Fridays” make him relatable.

Anyway, a few months ago, I started coming in early. Like, really early. I’m a night owl with insomnia, so sometimes I’d just drive to work at 4 AM, sit in my car, and wait for the day to start. Then I figured, hey — the doors are unlocked for cleaning staff — might as well go in and get a head start.

Nobody noticed for a while. Then one morning, one of the cleaners, Rosa, saw me and got startled. I apologized and explained, “Oh, just couldn’t sleep.” She laughed, said “You work too much,” and that was that.

But apparently, rumors started.

Fast forward a week, and I notice people whispering. Someone left a granola bar on my desk with a sticky note that said, “For breakfast :)” which was… odd.

Then our HR manager, Julia, emailed me:

“Hey! Just checking in — if you ever need support with housing or finances, please know we’re here to help.”

I was like ???

Turns out someone saw me brushing my teeth in the bathroom at 5 AM. I keep a toothbrush at work because coffee. But to them, that looked like I was… living there.

I tried to clarify it to a few people. “No, no, I just get here early.” But it somehow turned into “He’s embarrassed, don’t press him.”

Then the company decided to do this massive anonymous charity drive — “for an employee in need.” They raised over $2,000.

And they gave it to me. In a sealed envelope. With a note that said, “You’re part of our family. No one should struggle alone.”

I. Wanted. To. Die.

I didn’t even know how to correct it at that point. How do you tell your boss, “Hey, thanks for thinking I’m homeless, but I’m just weird”?

So… I did the cowardly thing: I accepted it. I took the envelope, said thank you, and used it to buy a new laptop.

A few weeks later, corporate sends an email about “Employee Spotlight Stories,” featuring me — under the title:

“Resilience in the Face of Adversity.”

They literally wrote a paragraph about how “despite personal hardship, he never missed a day of work and remained positive.”

My coworkers started bringing me food. One guy gave me an old blanket “for the car.” I tried to insist I had an apartment, but no one believed me.

So now I’m just leaning into it. I come in at 5 AM, make oatmeal in the breakroom, hum sad songs. People smile at me like I’m a trooper.

Yesterday, someone asked if I wanted to house-sit for them “so I could have a proper bed for a week.”

I said yes.",1,1760821924.0,slahistoriasne,0,1.0,False

Was I wrong for ending things?,"I matched with a guy (31m) who was my patient advocate at a hospital I was at. we matched on hinge, started talking, had a great 1st date. He;s in grad school for social work. some red flags started (he was arrested for drugs, but he came from a privileged family. he told me he was figuring out relationship goals and said he wasn't ready for anything series or if we did wed have to go slow which was okay with me I'd still see other people then). we had an amazing first date. He started to fall and disclosed a bunch of things to me- his mom passed away, he lived with someone who was bipolar and he felt he wasnt safe living with her they dated, he had to move out, his dad worked all the time, his sister was in financial trouble and bailed out by his parents, his other sister got pregnant w a 25 year old she is 45 with 3 other kids. We'd talk on the phone for hours and hours, sometimes 4 hours a day, I went out of town for work we talked a lot. We had a second date and I was a little surprised he didn't offer to pay (he did pay for the first date but it kind of bothered me that he didn't even offer to pay for the 2nd date even tho it was just a coffee shop). I was a little surprised. He comes from a very very wealthy family telling me his dad owns tons of lambroginies etc, which is true. I listened to all his trauma. Anyway, we have a great 3rd date, he invited me to Christmas with his family, and tells me he wants something serious, and that he's written poems about me. and he tells me for our 4th date on Saturday he's planning to take me out to a fancy dinner. He tells me sex is very important to him. Before Saturday and the day after our third date I come over again and we do the deed. After he tells me he's hooked up with 60 people before and was surprised I hadn't hooked up with a lot of people. He also tells me he was diagnosed with BPD, but after an LSD trip he realized BPD isn't real and it's just C-PTSD. He's disclosing so much and I listen to everything and then he asks about my trauma and I start to tell him I was molested as child. I start by saying every time I disclose this the other person has always reacted badly (once a guy asked me if I could just turn it off, another time a a bad medical doctor told me being molested was the reason I was having symptoms which later turned out to be severe gastroparesis). Anyway I start to tell him I should have known the person was going to molest me because we would ""wrestle"" and the guy I was seeing cut me off saying he can't listen to that, that he's too open and empathetic of a person to listen to that. I was surprised and told him that because he's going into social work he's going to have to hear about these things. I ws feeling vulnerable since we just had sex and shut down so I started to cry a bit. I decided to go home. I felt weird so I texted me saying sorry I overreacted and can we just forget it and start over. He texted me saying what do you mean start over? I said go back to light things the way dating should be fun etc. Anyway Friday I have a surgery this is Thursday night and he asked if we can have a phone call. I tell him no because I can tell it's gonna be a bad phone call and I have to rest for surgery tomorrow. I'm kinda surprised cuz he's a patient advocate and knows I have surgery tomorrow yet wants to voice his feeling texting me he can't overlook certain things that were said yesterday. I end up being nervous and stressed so I'm up all night anyway before my surgery cuz of this and at 11pm say yeah we can talk. Anyway he's asleep so I have my surgery and I know it's weird he doesn't come up to see me even tho he said he would. After my surgery that same day after anesthesia I do go back home since the surgery was outpatient I wake up at 3 or 4 he wants to talk so I call him. He tells me that because I said lets start over he doesn't like he likes to talk through things I said okay he says lets slow down and I say yeah that's what I meant by start over anyway he then tells me because I overreacted bye aying you're a social worker you're going to have to listen to these things I didn't respect his boundaries and that maybe our dynamic isn't right because I can't expect that out of him to be my social worker I said yeah I didn't ask you to be my therapist you asked about my trauma??? He said yeah but I told him a detail (the wrestling) and that by telling him that detail that's dramatically different than him opening up telling me his mom died because he didn't tell me any details. Then he says for me not to get my hopes up for anything serious with him but he'd be down to still having sex. I tell him he's being so inconsiderate doing this the day OF my surgery, and right after we had sex (guess no fancy dinner after all I jokingly was like oh you got sex so you're like great no dinner etc) anyway then I tell him how dare he say not to get my hopes up as if I'm so down bad for him, when we first on our date he said he wasn't looking for anything serious then so I told him I had still been seeing other people anyway (I did go on a date with 1 other person) and then he got upset and said now he can't see any kind of relationship with me. I'm not what he's looking for in a partner. Then he back tracks and says actually let me just think about things and give me a week and a half and we can take some space and let me think if I want to keep seeing you casually or just not at all. At first I think well maybe it's good for me to practice not cutting things off since before if something like this happened I'd be like no I don't want to see you again but I tell him I understand people aren't perfect. I also told him he was looking at me with rose colored glasses since my communictation way was like yeah I did say lets start over I don't see the point of going back and rehashing our moment of me crying after I dislocated my trauma id rather just move past it and he said his partners he didn't want a partner like that he wanted to talk to through everything. I told him the fact that I am calling and talking through it shows I'm making an effort and effort is more important since its very highly unusual two people have the same exact communication style and people aren't perfect but we learn etc. I still thought it was weird he thought he was the victim since I told him he was going to school for social work he'd have to hear things like trauma and he thought I was expecting too much from him by opening up about my trauma. In my head I'm thinking that's weird cuz I was the one who got shut down when I opened up and he picked the day of my surgery to tell me this, the night before to send a text saying lets talk, and wants to end things right after we had sex. I guess he thought I was expecting him to be my social worker and that his sisters go to him for help bc that's what he's studying I said no, I had therapy, I opened up to him bc he opened up and asked, I'm a self-reflective person, I never asked him for anything, etc. I did joke w him when I opened up that night that he was a social worker if anyone had the tools to hear these kinds of thing its him but I never asked him to help me process it nor was I expecting to. During our phone call I said I had whiplash cuz last time we hung out he invited me to Christmas with his family said he'd never felt this way about someone, etc. It seemed like lovebombing but he reassured me it wasn't. I said maybe it's his bpd he sees someone on a pedestal then that person fall but he said no bpd doesn't exist it's just CPTSD and he knows that from his LSD trip. Okay...anyway, I did tell him sure let's wait a couple weeks and see what happens. But the more I thought about it I thought it was messed up he's a patient advocate at my hospital and yet chose the day of my surgery (which he knew about) to do this, also he's going to be a social worker yet can't deal when anyone else talks about their trauma but he dumps it all on me, and this happened after I had sex with him. I've also never had sex this soon into seeing someone. So I texted him this. Did I overreact? no relationships are perfect and I'm not that experienced in relationships I only had 1 long term serious relationship (this guy said he had many before). I've never had this kind of experience since I usually wait to sleep with someone.

1oa7bij,https://www.reddit.com/r/DetroitRedWings/comments/1oa7bij/discussing_the_yzerplan/,"Discussing the ""Yzerplan""","Going into training camp, there was a growing swell of fan base to put Yzerman  on the hot seat (if he was not already there). There were two prongs for this criticism:

1. The free agents signed were not big names or obviously large improvements in their production.

2. Many Yzerman defenders pointed out to many draft experts praising the drafting the RED WINGS have done under Yzerman but the slow rate of incorporating them into the line-up (as well as the idea that maybe some other draftees making it to the NHL ahead of DETROIT draftees implied they were not as good as experts felt).

Of course now, after 5 games and the team winning so far, with 2 first year players contributing in large roles last year, the team adds 3 more rookies in very key roles. And every one is happy.

  
The Yzerman haters are still there. ""Well, why didn't Yzerman do this before"". I would remind them that we are talking about 18-21 year old kids. Yzerman has repeatedly said when the players were ready, he would play them, but he would not hand unearned roster spots to the kids.  Watching college football today, I was overcome by watching the variability of play from week to week of these similarly aged athletes.  Last night's MIAMI-LOUISVILLE game is a great case in point.  5th year senior QB Carson Beck was BetMGM's leader in odds for the Heisman after 5 games. By the end of the game,, he was  outside the top 20.! And he is going to be 23 in a month.

Raymond is only 22 and Seider is 24.  When they made the team in the 2021-2022 season, they were 2 of only 17 players who  played a minimum of 50% of their team's games as 20 year olds or younger players. That actually was a special season as those 17 accounted for 2.2% of the 700+ NHL players that season.  Reviewing the last 10 years, the percentage is \~1.1% or 9 players 20 years old or younger. I would argue nobody knew how well either of those two would play and if I recall, neither was expected to have major roles on that team that season. 

Same for Kasper last year. He was  one of sixteen 20 year olds or younger to play last year. And again, he wound up playing a much larger role than was hoped for last season let alone making the team out of the gate. Same for Edvison, his first full season after a cup of coffee the year before, and he is playing on the first line before settling into a strong 2nd line defender. This off-season I have seen quite a few reddit posters saying that Edvison had passed Seider as the future #1 defenseman for the RED WINGS.

And now we have three more 20-year olds joining the fray that we hope will stay up all year and are already playing major roles in the first few games.

As Yzerman has tried to explain, you do not go into training camp trying to figure out your roster.  Your roster is set in the off-season.  Training camp is for installing systems, honing skills, and maybe tweaking the ""fringes"" of your roster, not the main components. As any GM, you acquire players to supply your team with the abilities they have proven.  Signing Holl and Gustafson was the smart move as a team builder. Would you wish he signed better players? Of course, but we do not know what the valuation was to sign them. You have to have all positions filled with contingency plans upon contingency plans. These guys provide your floor.  You do not go into season hoping someone who has never played in the NHL will fulfill your hopes.  You need a base line expectation. For TIGER fans, you sign Zach McKinstry to be a useful utility infielder who has some pop against lefties. You do not sign him expecting to be an all-star.  That is a happy accident. Even next year, after making this years all-star team, you do not go into next season counting on McKinstry as an all-star level talent. He has established a floor for his value.  Anything above that is bells and whistles. 

Now Gus,, et. al.. are not core players. They are the roster fringe. Good organizations, as I alluded to earlier, allow for happy accidents to happen. Recall the narrative going into training camp was Finnie was making noise at the prospect tournament, but it was a nice story only since he was a 7th round draft pick. ASP was ticketed for Grand Rapids. MBN was on the fence whether it was another season overseas or begin time in North America. Gustafason and Holl were set to be place holders and hopeful upgrades around the margins.

A month later, here we are. I do not know how well any of these three are going to play. What I do know is there is definitely more energy on this team this season. There appears to be more pace and better exiting out of our own end so far this year with the kids. This is the stuff that leads me to believe the start is sustainable. But 82 games is a long grind.  And just like other athletes their age, there will be a lot of volatility in their performance as we watch.",18,1760821414.0,DetroitRedWings,17,0.88,False

I'm Michael (Mike), 27 years old, and I live in Germany. I can speak English, German, and Polish (though I don't write well in Polish). I can be a bit reserved at first, but once I get comfortable, I'm all in and pretty much an open book at that point. I value honesty and loyalty, and I'm always trying to grow and improve. I'm pretty lowkey and keep it real.

**A Bit About Me**

* I'm a good listener, and I appreciate both deep conversations and lighthearted banter
* I like calm company—hanging in a voice call while we each do our own thing is underrated
* I'm into solo hobbies, but always open to trying something new if someone brings the spark
* I'm the type who loves to listen and be there for people, but I'll give advice if I can help. Sometimes just being present for someone is what matters most

**Why I'm Posting**

Lately, I've been stuck in my thoughts, and I'm trying to get out of the loop. Finding new friends is one way I think could really help me. I actually have close friends I've known for 12+ years, but they're all on the west coast of the US now, so timezones have been tough since I moved back to Germany. That's part of why I'm looking to connect with people closer to my timezone.

I'm not looking for a big group or server—just hoping to connect with genuine people. I love daily conversations and just checking in on how someone's day went. Whether we're gaming together, watching something, or just chilling on call doing our own thing—I'm flexible and easy going. Whether it's talking about life, vibing in silence, or sending random memes at 2AM—I'm here for it.

I connect best with people who are easy going and non-judgmental. I struggle with self-confidence sometimes, so finding people I really click with can take time, but once I do, I'm all in.

**My Interests**

I'll be honest—most of my hobbies are pretty solo. That's just how I grew up and what I gravitated toward. But I enjoy talking about them and hearing what other people are into.

**Music** has always been important to me. I used to make beats—mostly freestyle, trap, and phonk style—and I might get back into it soon. I'm all over the place with genres:

* Rock / Metal / Metalcore
* Rap / Underground Hip-Hop
* Trance / DnB / Phonk / Hardstyle

Always down to swap playlists or explore new sounds. Got a playlist that hits hard? Send it my way—I'm always listening (coffee gets me through work, energy drinks fuel the late nights).

**Other Stuff I'm Into**

* YouTube deep dives—conspiracy theories, car builds, iceberg videos, paranormal stuff, space content. I like keeping an open mind about these topics
* Binging shows and movies—I'm into old comedies and action films, and I want to get more into horror/scary movies too. Always open to recommendations or watching stuff together
* Just generally falling down rabbit holes. If it's weird or fascinating, I'm in
* Gaming (PC) - I play a mix of tactical shooters, survival games, and RPGs when I want to unwind

**A Bit About My Life**

I work in an office right now—mostly desk work—but I'm looking to get into IT since I know quite a bit about computers. When the weather's nice, I love getting outside and enjoying nature. And there's something about thunderstorms at night—just watching the lightning and chilling—that hits different.

I'm also slowly getting into working out, nothing crazy, just trying to be more active.

I'm a night owl, especially on days off and weekends. During the week when I work, I usually stay up till 11pm-12am. But on nights before my days off? 3-5am is my zone.

And hey, if none of this resonates with you, that's totally fine. I'm always looking to try new things and pick up new interests.

If you're also craving something a little more real than surface-level chats, maybe we're on the same wavelength. Send me a DM or message—timezone differences don't bother me (as long as they're not too extreme), so reach out anytime!",1,1760821316.0,InternetFriends,0,1.0,False

My ex of 6 months and I had (what I thought was) a solid relationship until he broke up with me over my going to visit my family who Denies the genocide Israel is committing. 
He knew about my upringing when we met and the only concern he voiced leading up to the trip was for my safety. He then split on me the first day, told me to cut off my family, and proceeded to tell me to lean on others because he didn't have the capacity to deal with the conflict.

He was friendly with my best friend who has been in treatment for 8+ years for pbd. Said friend told him he was displaying signs of bpd when it went down, which he denied. 

His reason for dumping me was not having the capacity for a relationship. We tried to stay friends for a couple months, at his request, despite me telling him he was a terrible friend and him not showing up in any substantial way or apologizing for the hurt he caused. 

I eventually stopped talking to him after I asked to catch up over coffee and he said he had no capacity for it. 

He stayed in touch with my friend and eventually got diagnosed with bpd, until I asked them to stop talking to him because it felt like he was circling 
my life without making any effort to make amends to me. 

It's been a year and a half. Last week I was arrested while doing protective presence work after being assaulted by a police officer. My friend was trying to get in touch with my family to let them know and he helped them track my parents down. He still hasn't spoken to me since I went NC.

I'm feeling incredibly salty and angry about the irony of all of this, the abandonment and betrayal. Being denied my humanity and painted as a genocide apologist in his eyes for still maintaining contact with my family, and after all of this still not getting any kind of apology. 

How to let go of the anger and move on?

Let's show him some love! 🥰,"I thought it was about time I made a reddit for Sir Danathy, I know there are quite a few of you who love his streams (me included) and so here's another place to share all things SD!

A little bit about him (for those who are new): 

* Sir Danathy is British, from the North of England
* His favourite colour is green
* He loves coffee and Monster drinks (everyone tell him to lay off the caffeine) 
* His favourite subject at school was Physics, ask him about it, he loves to teach! 😁
* Despite his interest in science, he studied media and graphic design! He loves being creative! 
* He has loved gaming for many years (guys, he's in his thirties, that's A LOT of time playing games 🤣). Games (and cats) are his favourite thing and I'm so glad he is finally sharing his passion with you all! He's only several months into streaming on TikTok and I know he is really enjoying interacting with everyone who chats with him there. He is still so excited about the Minecraft server he set up in the summer, he can't wait to expand it further with you all! 😊

Dan is so close to 2K followers and I really believe he will get a lot more than that, he's so enjoyable to watch. Fingers crossed. :)

1oa78ln,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1oa78ln/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

1oa77p4,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1oa77p4/the_first_ever_real_persons_parade/,The First Ever Real Persons' Parade,"I wandered down to the ""First Ever Real Persons' Parade!"" today. 

I learned so... Much. 

And yes, before you ask, I'm still here, in the bathroom. And I'm almost certain I'm still real.

But, for clarity, let me explain:

I made coffee first thing, as always, and stood at the kitchen window. Like I tend to do. The low bluegray predawn glass, cold and still. A muted saffron skyline. 

And then, immediately, out there over the sawtooth slopes of neighborhood rooftops, simply jogging along, there he was: 

An ordinary man of ordinary build (if not a bit narrow in the shoulders, being completely fair). He wore a red sweater and baby-blue running shorts. And everything was so normal, so unremarkable about him, save for his face.

His face:

Sheet-white and round, perfectly round--like a porcelain dinner plate--and on this flat, perfectly round and sheet-white face were the features, features you might expect on any face, 

Only all wrong. 

It was as though someone had splotched on the eyes--those great striking blue eyes--like a drunken sculptor, smearing the cherry red lips into a perpetual shout. No hint of a recognizeable emotion in the floundering wide O the mouth was making, and the longer I watched, the less it seemed to change. The face was, above all, without depth or shape.

The jogger had a two dimensional face.

I watched him, frozen. Breathless. He was barely out of view when a couple came strolling into view down the same sidewalk, heading the same direction.  To my horror, their faces were just as flat. Missing noses. Giant painted-on eyes of woad, terrible screaming mouths. 

But there was clearly esprit in their gait. Wherever they were going, they were on a mission.

I decided to throw on my coat and head downstairs. 

To follow them.

Out the door. A burst of sweet morning chill, the little glittering songs of chickadees in frostbit hedges. Cloying drafts of diesel fumes off scant early traffic. When I round the corner, there's a small crowd gathered. All their faces flat and round and made of porcelain. They've lined the sidewalks; I had the feeling they were waiting for something to begin. They waited in silence. No one spoke. 

Then came the floats. Or what should have been floats:

Enormous white gloves. Like the gloves of early cartoon animals--all balloony and wrong. They came sulking out of a thick fog suddenly draped like a curtain over the south end of the city. Between two of these hulking giants, lumbering along on their balloony digits, was strung a banner. In huge block letters, it read

THE FIRST ANNUAL REAL PEOPLES' PARADE!

I turned. Glared wildly about for someone who was actually real, real like me.

Finally I located an old man at the bus stop on the corner. A face of browned leather, chiseled, forged over brow and valley. My kind of human. 

I ran to him.

""Do you see this lunacy?"" I cried, waving wildly at the general viscinity of the scene. ""What the hell IS all this?""

He just sort of shrugged and watched. Now there were things, what appeared to be great lumbering corgis made out of something like cottage cheese. The flat-faced people were riding atop their curdled humps, wearing the bold little uniforms and fez caps of the Shriners. The giant corgis left thick white skids in the street as the strode by. 

""I think it's nice,"" said the old man. ""You don't think it's nice?""

""It's the most awful thing,"" I murmured.

""But aren't you one of... Aren't you like... Aren't you with them?"" 

I stared at the old man. That deep concern in his dark hazel gaze...

I rushed immediately back up to my apartment. Stood in front of the medicine cabinet. And I was going to look in the mirror.

I REALLY AM going to look in the mirror. I'm here now, in the sallow linoleum safety of the bathroom, and I'm going to prove to myself any second now that I'm real. That I'm not one of porcelain people, that they're an abomination and I am most definitely real.

Or I can stand here forever. Because there must be a space, a safe and silvered lining between that which we call REAL and FAKE. An interstitial state, homeostatic stillness. 

If I never see, it won't ever be. I'll just... Stand.

Not waiting. Just...

1oa77h0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Needafriend/comments/1oa77h0/27mgermany_stuck_in_my_head_looking_for_real/,"27M/Germany - Stuck in my head, looking for real connections","Hey Reddit,

I'm Michael (Mike), 27 years old, and I live in Germany. I can speak English, German, and Polish (though I don't write well in Polish). I can be a bit reserved at first, but once I get comfortable, I'm all in and pretty much an open book at that point. I value honesty and loyalty, and I'm always trying to grow and improve. I'm pretty lowkey and keep it real.

**A Bit About Me**

* I'm a good listener, and I appreciate both deep conversations and lighthearted banter
* I like calm company—hanging in a voice call while we each do our own thing is underrated
* I'm into solo hobbies, but always open to trying something new if someone brings the spark
* I'm the type who loves to listen and be there for people, but I'll give advice if I can help. Sometimes just being present for someone is what matters most

**Why I'm Posting**

Lately, I've been stuck in my thoughts, and I'm trying to get out of the loop. Finding new friends is one way I think could really help me. I actually have close friends I've known for 12+ years, but they're all on the west coast of the US now, so timezones have been tough since I moved back to Germany. That's part of why I'm looking to connect with people closer to my timezone.

I'm not looking for a big group or server—just hoping to connect with genuine people. I love daily conversations and just checking in on how someone's day went. Whether we're gaming together, watching something, or just chilling on call doing our own thing—I'm flexible and easy going. Whether it's talking about life, vibing in silence, or sending random memes at 2AM—I'm here for it.

I connect best with people who are easy going and non-judgmental. I struggle with self-confidence sometimes, so finding people I really click with can take time, but once I do, I'm all in.

**My Interests**

I'll be honest—most of my hobbies are pretty solo. That's just how I grew up and what I gravitated toward. But I enjoy talking about them and hearing what other people are into.

**Music** has always been important to me. I used to make beats—mostly freestyle, trap, and phonk style—and I might get back into it soon. I'm all over the place with genres:

* Rock / Metal / Metalcore
* Rap / Underground Hip-Hop
* Trance / DnB / Phonk / Hardstyle

Always down to swap playlists or explore new sounds. Got a playlist that hits hard? Send it my way—I'm always listening (coffee gets me through work, energy drinks fuel the late nights).

**Other Stuff I'm Into**

* YouTube deep dives—conspiracy theories, car builds, iceberg videos, paranormal stuff, space content. I like keeping an open mind about these topics
* Binging shows and movies—I'm into old comedies and action films, and I want to get more into horror/scary movies too. Always open to recommendations or watching stuff together
* Just generally falling down rabbit holes. If it's weird or fascinating, I'm in
* Gaming (PC) - I play a mix of tactical shooters, survival games, and RPGs when I want to unwind

**A Bit About My Life**

I work in an office right now—mostly desk work—but I'm looking to get into IT since I know quite a bit about computers. When the weather's nice, I love getting outside and enjoying nature. And there's something about thunderstorms at night—just watching the lightning and chilling—that hits different.

I'm also slowly getting into working out, nothing crazy, just trying to be more active.

I'm a night owl, especially on days off and weekends. During the week when I work, I usually stay up till 11pm-12am. But on nights before my days off? 3-5am is my zone.

And hey, if none of this resonates with you, that's totally fine. I'm always looking to try new things and pick up new interests.

I'm Michael (Mike), 27 years old, and I live in Germany. I can speak English, German, and Polish (though I don't write well in Polish). I can be a bit reserved at first, but once I get comfortable, I'm all in and pretty much an open book at that point. I value honesty and loyalty, and I'm always trying to grow and improve. I'm pretty lowkey and keep it real.

**A Bit About Me**

* I'm a good listener, and I appreciate both deep conversations and lighthearted banter
* I like calm company—hanging in a voice call while we each do our own thing is underrated
* I'm into solo hobbies, but always open to trying something new if someone brings the spark
* I'm the type who loves to listen and be there for people, but I'll give advice if I can help. Sometimes just being present for someone is what matters most

**Why I'm Posting**

Lately, I've been stuck in my thoughts, and I'm trying to get out of the loop. Finding new friends is one way I think could really help me. I actually have close friends I've known for 12+ years, but they're all on the west coast of the US now, so timezones have been tough since I moved back to Germany. That's part of why I'm looking to connect with people closer to my timezone.

I am just hoping to connect with genuine people. I love daily conversations and just checking in on how someone's day went. Whether we're gaming together, watching something, or just chilling on call doing our own thing—I'm flexible and easy going. Whether it's talking about life, vibing in silence, or sending random memes at 2AM—I'm here for it.

I connect best with people who are easy going and non-judgmental. I struggle with self-confidence sometimes, so finding people I really click with can take time, but once I do, I'm all in.

**My Interests**

I'll be honest—most of my hobbies are pretty solo. That's just how I grew up and what I gravitated toward. But I enjoy talking about them and hearing what other people are into.

**Music** has always been important to me. I used to make beats—mostly freestyle, trap, and phonk style—and I might get back into it soon. I'm all over the place with genres:

* Rock / Metal / Metalcore
* Rap / Underground Hip-Hop
* Trance / DnB / Phonk / Hardstyle

Always down to swap playlists or explore new sounds. Got a playlist that hits hard? Send it my way—I'm always listening (coffee gets me through work, energy drinks fuel the late nights).

**Other Stuff I'm Into**

* YouTube deep dives—conspiracy theories, car builds, iceberg videos, paranormal stuff, space content. I like keeping an open mind about these topics
* Binging shows and movies—I'm into old comedies and action films, and I want to get more into horror/scary movies too. Always open to recommendations or watching stuff together
* Just generally falling down rabbit holes. If it's weird or fascinating, I'm in
* Gaming (PC) - I play a mix of tactical shooters, survival games, and RPGs when I want to unwind

(like an empty plaque on a grave,
like a voice to whom no name was ever given)

Every morning I wake up in sticky embraces of dawn
in dream-images raped by the sunrise.
I don’t remember most of them – and that’s lucky.
And then, gasping from thirst I find excuses for each new day,
in which I do not exist, exercising in futility,
inventing meaning each time anew –
like giving names to clouds.

Self-defence through indifference,
looking in the mirror and seeing a tired, alien face…
Asking yourself – what did I forget here in this world?
In a world that’s been sold and cursed
where rivers run thick with blood and tears…
in a place where no one awaits your return…

Drinking coffee in the morning,
turning into liquid dirt in the mouth.
Sensing the stale air of cafés,
watching dust settle like snowflakes…
Eating food that lost its taste back in the soil,
with a faint note of rot still clinging to it.

Talking about feelings –
the kind you only know from Netflix and YouTube…
But how can you feel anything real,
when your whole world is just a wasteland?
A black, sloshing hole in the chest – that’s all that’s left…
One garden still remains, but spring will never return…

I became a mannequin amid the empty hustle of the world,
made of ghosts, likes, and endless consumption…
where people move like on autopilot: born, work, die –
caught in the loop of serving the system.
Home. Work. Weekend.

Only a false echo reaches from the truth.
Sometimes it seems to me that when it rains,
houses turn gray – like giant tombstones,
for those still alive, outwardly.

“Alright, hold on – let me just find my positivity mask
in this handleless suitcase of mine, and we’ll continue…”
I say to everyone: “Hello, how are you?”
Then cheerfully reply: “I’m good, thanks” –
even though no one really cares anymore.
But I keep playing this performance,
where the smile is a grimace of pain,
and mechanical, soulless existence is elevated
to a virtue – a model to imitate.

Vows and promises?
Lying in the gutter like filthy underwear.
Lust has buried love and the sense of beauty.
Children – just regret, a burden,
and a tool of manipulation for personal gain.

I’m already tired of screaming
into a leaden sky,
its color soaked in the will not to live.
And still – even here, in this world,
no matter how bright the light,
it can never replace the warmth of living presence.

I don’t know if everyone truly needs a living soul…
Not for salvation. Not for support.
But to be in co-presence.
To be felt – not merely consumed.
To have someone look into your eyes, not just at you.
Perhaps for me, it will be ""the Late Companion"" –
a voice that comes when no one else
answers anymore.

I stand on the shore stripped bare by meaninglessness.
I hear the waves crashing –
but it’s only the sea of sorrow…
What am I doing here?
Despair has sunk its claws deep into my soul.
Loneliness – its shroud soaked through with tears…

Ah yes, I forgot about hope…
There she is – I see her ugly silhouette, holding my hand.

Me M19. Her F18. So you get it from the title. A girl and I were talking around 3-4 days. We never met up, or had plans. I usually take a little longer in the talking stage. We legit just had an ongoing conversation for those few days. She got busy with work and college and I started noticing her responding later and later. When the conversation got dry, I eventually tested the waters with something along the lines of “This conversations been fun, but I know you’re busy, I’ll let you get back to what you need to do.” (This was just to test to see what she would say. Does she want to keep talking? Does she enjoy my company? Etc). She responded that I’m no bother, she likes the conversation and we had an amazing night after that going back and forth talking about personal life, and her opening up about past relationships, home life, etc. No sexual talk, no nudes, just 2 people trying to figure eachother out. (At least that’s what I thought). The next day I hit her up, and she completely ignores me for 6 hours. She sends me a picture of herself, (this is over snap) and then just completely gets dry and leaves me on delivered. Rough… it’s been about a day from hearing from her. What’s the move?

Question:
What possibly could have made this happen? I mean the conversation was perfect, she just suddenly went ghost. 
 
Question 2: Could it have been the fact that I never asked her to meet up or grab coffee, etc? I mean we only talked for not even a week, maybe 3-5 days. Did I wait too long? I usually like to get to know the other person more before meeting up, but I feel like she may have just lost interest waiting for me to offer something.

Follow Up: Should I send her something respectful in a few days if I continue to stay on delivered along the lines of, (Hope your weeks been going alright- really enjoyed our conversations).

Sometimes I try to show my very obvious belly like inside the subway cars if I need a seat. Unfortunately most people pretend not to see me (except for brown and black POCs, and older ladies). 

At coffee shops people sprint before me to get seats before I can make it. 
On park benches people don’t want to move their purse so I can sit even if I ask.

I’m planning to start a small roasting business eventually, but for now I want to begin learning and profiling coffee at home. I’m looking for suggestions for a reliable electric drum roaster that fits these criteria:

Requirements:

Electric drum roaster (not hot top, I want precise repeatable control and proper temperature logging)

Batch size: around 400–500 grams

Should be able to handle a few back-to-back roasts without overheating or needing long cooldowns

Temperature logging support (built-in or compatible with Artisan / similar software)

Budget: up to $1,000 USD (open to used options if they’re solid and parts are available)

Prefer something that’s durable, consistent, and gives a realistic feel of commercial drum roasting

What I’d love to know:

Which models you’d recommend (and why)

Pros/cons of electric drum roasters you’ve used

What software/hardware setup you use for logging

Any accessories or modifications that improve consistency (e.g. probes, airflow tweaks, etc.)

I’ve ruled out Hottop since the control over heat feels too guesswork-based, but I’m open to any other suggestions that give proper roast data and repeatability.

Appreciate any insight, especially from people who’ve transitioned from home roasting to small-batch commercial setups.",1,1760820275.0,roasting,2,0.67,False

Disclosure: This is a psychological relationship drama.  It deals with a lot of real world issues among partners.  May have triggering themes throughout.

PART 1: HER

My wife and I share the long and sometimes defeating effort of laying the kids down for bed at the end of the night. If all goes as planned, she and I can steal away and enjoy an hour of uninterrupted time together. Unfortunately, that isn’t always the case if one or both of us succumbs to the comfort of a warm bed. I wonder if she feels the same as I do when we’re completely alone. I mean, I wonder if there’s ever a flicker of shyness or nervousness that passes through her—the kind that comes on a first or second date. She probably doesn’t feel that way; it’s always been me who’s more in tune with the emotional side of things. I’ll admit, months and years of operating more like co‑workers around our children have left me clinging to small, momentary feelings like this whenever I get her all to myself. I grow increasingly excited about the idea of her—almost like falling in love again.
They say you fall in love three times in your life, and I think I’m in the middle of the second. She starts to talk about her day, about opinionated things involving her workplace. I try to be a good listener, but her words fade as I lose myself in those beautiful brown eyes—the same eyes our children have. She doesn’t notice, but I nod to show I’m listening, even as my gaze drifts to her lips: perfect and beautiful. Lips I’d love nothing more than to kiss as she babbles on, but I resist the urge and let her continue. Then I notice a long strand of hair begging to be brushed behind her ear—any excuse to touch her soft cheek. And I wonder if she ever looks at me the same way. I don’t think she does.
“Why?” someone might ask. “Why are you so moved by someone who doesn’t share the sentiment?” I have to think about those questions once in a while. The truth is, I’m still as in love with her as the moment I slipped a ring on her finger. And I have to believe she’s genuine when she says, “I love you.” But I’d be lying if I said I never wondered whether I’m naïve in my love. I’ve come to realize I’m a people‑pleaser—a trait I inherited from my mother. When I care about someone, I have no problem showering them with acts of service and gifts. Physical touch, of course, ranks high on that list. And because of this, I could never expect someone to meet these traits with their own.
As I’ve grown to understand the ever‑changing person my wife has become, I’ve learned that her love language is quiet—subtle, if it’s there at all. I remind myself that looking at her family offers a glimpse into who she is. They yell. They bicker. They don’t leave much room for moral questioning. They’re straightforward, sometimes apathetic, and they have little patience for emotional dissections. That doesn’t make them bad people. It doesn’t make her a bad person either—just someone who’ll make you work for the pathway to her heart.
And maybe that’s why I don’t always feel the same kind of love reflected back: because, without interference, those traits were never encoded in her DNA. Still, I hold on to this idea of a woman who might one day miraculously emerge from her own skin—someone who would see me in the same light I see her, and we’d grow old together, cherishing every moment of our love. But then, like a baby monitor crackling to life, I’m reminded that this is the real world—and our attention is needed elsewhere.
SCREAMING. CRYING. CLAWING. BITING. HITTING. FALLING. CRYING. CRYING. CRYING.
Sometimes you wonder how children produce so many tears without passing out. Some nights begin to blur together.
I used to say, “Mothers don’t have the hardest job in the world. Go work on an oil rig and tell me that’s not harder.” Most men probably share that opinion—but I’d bet they weren’t splitting the load fifty‑fifty. Or sometimes, a hundred to zero. When you watch your wife carry, birth, and care for a new life, you begin to see what’s behind the curtain.
That curtain was hung long ago and painted with soft pastels that said something like, “You’re about to embark on the most beautiful journey! You’ll witness the miracle of becoming a mother and cherish every moment.”
I don’t mean this cruelly, but it almost feels like a sick joke.
Moaning. Grunting. Screaming. Whispering. Crying. Crying. Crying.
A mother’s body is like the earth after a storm—split, reshaped, torn. What was once untouched now carries the memory of creation. When the tides recede, the shore is never quite the same. But when you walk it again, the sun rises over the horizon, and there’s beauty there.
I don’t want to tell you a mother’s story for her. I can only better understand my own story through hers.
On one of those quiet, uninterrupted nights, I scheduled a talk with her. This wasn’t one of our usual hour‑long conversations, half spent sharing videos on our phones. Instead, it unfolded into a three‑hour discussion. I sat across the room, giving us space to bridge the distance between us as we worked toward a shared understanding.
It began softly, with tears. Then it deepened—sobbing, questioning, searching. And it ended with us side by side, making new promises. That night brought many things into focus and answered questions.
First, she ruled out the idea that anything lacking between us was my fault. Second, she admitted that she feels like there isn’t a sexual bone in her body, even though she’s still attracted to me. We assume it’s hormonal—after the children. Third, she confessed that she hasn’t felt like herself in a long time. She catches glimpses of who she was, but never fully. Her inability—or unwillingness—to examine those feelings has left her struggling to describe them at all.
I remind myself of where she comes from—the language of her family. And words, even at their best, are a limited form of communication. I hold that in mind as I try to understand her.
She’s been broken. She’s lost her youthfulness. She’s lost her body. She’s lost the time and space to remember who she is. My heart aches for her—but it also races to fix her. I have to stop myself, remind myself that not everything can be fixed. Maybe the best help I can offer isn’t showing her the way forward, but walking by her side through it.
She’s always been my best friend—an incredible mother and strong wife. The only person I ever wanted to walk through this life with.
Everything I’m journaling here is elevated stylistically. This is not to assume things are untrue or aren’t as meaningful, because they are. I find myself writing in ways no real person would ever talk, but more so in the language of an author—or maybe my mind.
Instead of pouring my heart out to a professional psychologist, I find so much emotional healing from just putting pen to paper. Someone might think, “What a bitch. This dude has to write his feelings to get over it!” Actually, that’s more like my subconscious speaking. It’s true that I’m an emotional person, but more so, I’m an artist first. The world that I see is through a lens that makes sense to me. This makes sense when reality is complicated and messy. This is structured, thought out. There’s no walking away and regretting saying something more; it’s already here, at my own pace.
Now, I could have written a novel when it comes to what it means to be a father—what my children mean to me—but I think I have a clear focus for this writing. Fatherhood is for another time and consciousness. It deserves that.
I’m eager to get home most days—not to relax, but to see them. To see her. If I’m being completely honest with myself, there are points in my life where my day‑to‑day emotions were totally reliant on my wife. This is probably very normal, on both sides. In a way, I viewed this as a type of codependency that was disguised as supportiveness.
I want to help you. Make you happy. Convince myself that I feel seen. Because if I don’t, then my emotional compass will forever spin. She is my direction.
No. This is not healthy.
I have been rewiring my mind and unearthing answers I’d previously thought were held by someone else. They were always with me. I just wasn’t listening. There are very loud voices, but in the back—way in the back, behind layers—there are soft ones. I’d encourage anyone to practice finding them.
The root of a tree is not always seen, but it’s vital for keeping the tree alive. Its branches stretch and leaves blossom in every direction. How beautiful this tree has become. But what of the root? He’s hidden deep below, calculating his reach, twisting his foundation, and growing stronger. Nobody sees the root, but they’re not supposed to. The leaves are beautiful.
I don’t need your kind words. I don’t need your affirmation. I just need to see it in your eyes once in a while—something that says, “I’m with you. I love you.”
She has weathered the storms on the surface, and I’ve felt them below.


PART 2: ME

We step back into the bedroom. A whirlwind of crying hits us. We take our stations beside each baby, stroking soft hair, whispering reminders that we’re still here. The noise fades. The room exhales. Only the hum of the oscillating fan remains.
Through the blackness, a faint reflection glimmers in her eyes—they’re still open. I smile, reach out, find her hand. But she isn’t looking at me. Her gaze drifts somewhere behind me, somewhere far away. If only I could hear her thoughts. If only she would share them.
Then that voice—the one I thought I’d buried—crawls out of the ashes.
What if she’s fantasizing about someone else?
Shut up.
What if she longs for a real man? One who excites her with adventure instead of tormenting her with your twisted perceptions.
SHUT UP.
And then comes that feeling—like stepping from sunlight into a cold, dark space. I dread it because I know it too well. I’ve lived here before. My hand finds hers again. I rub her lifeless fingers—no response. Her eyes still wander, anywhere but mine.
I sink a little further.
The alarm tears through my dreams. 3:41 A.M. Like clockwork, I’m gathering my things in the dark. The world sleeps while I begin my day. The road glows ahead in my headlights. For a moment, it feels quiet enough to forget. Almost.
Today is a new day. I can be anyone when I walk back through that door tonight. I can be the reminder of fun, of youth, of being needed. Or maybe I could just be me—that’s what started all this, wasn’t it? But she’ll still be the same. Cold.
“Man, why don’t you just leave her? You’re never happy.” My coworker leans back in his chair—the unwilling therapist of my lunch breaks.
“It’ll be fine,” I tell him. “She’s an amazing mother, honestly.” He smirks like he’s heard this a hundred times.
“Yeah, but there’s a difference between being a good mother and being a good wife. You’ve got to communicate your needs as a man.”
But I have, haven’t I? Have I not been clear enough? Or do I just know she won’t do anything with it? Probably both. These talks aren’t helpful. He just becomes another voice in my head—negative thoughts dressed as wisdom. Sure, in most marriages, communication is vital. But she doesn’t need anything. She doesn’t seem to want anything.
Life was simple once. Before kids. Before bills. Before alarms at 3:41 A.M. We were eager back then—chasing love like it might run away. She loved her body. She was confident. She had opinions, dreams, purpose. We talked for hours about the life we have now. And we built it.
So what happens when you get everything you ever wanted by age thirty? You have fun, right? You make new memories. You chase smaller dreams that keep you moving—a walk‑in shower, a new kitchen, a family car, a trip together. Then something shifts.
How about stop touching your husband…
Or sit on your phone all night, scrolling past him.
Or stop talking about your feelings altogether.
And now the anger rises. The sadness follows. How did I end up back here again? Our long talks—the writing, the promises—did any of it help? Or am I just orbiting the same questions, over and over? My thoughts accelerate. My palms turn clammy. My breathing breaks rhythm.
“You good, dude?”
My coworker is still watching as I stand abruptly, slam the door behind me, and rush to an empty break room. Another panic attack. First one in a month.
Look at yourself. You let her do this to you—without her even trying. You think you deserve this? You think you’ve earned pain like this? There are soldiers who’ve seen children die, parents who’ve buried their own. And you? What have you suffered?
Get away from me. You were gone. I got rid of you.
You convinced yourself of a lot of things. That you’re not needed. That you can handle it alone. That being unseen makes you noble. You let a woman crawl into your mind and bring you to your knees. You think your “good deeds” make you strong? You think they’ll save you from yourself?
I never needed you. You’re the Devil.
Please! What use would the Devil have for someone as small and as insignificant—with all your “problems”?
I think he would have all the use in the world for them. For my soul. For every man’s soul. All at the same time.
You’ve truly fallen into delusion then. Blame the Devil for something you can’t take control of.
I can see the house peek over the hill as I approach, her car parked in its usual spot.
A home that should be teeming with light and life instead looks cold and hollow.
Pulling in, I kill the engine and sit for a moment. The plan I’d had earlier—to shower her with hugs and smiles—died sometime this afternoon. In its place, something colder formed. I decided I wouldn’t lay a finger on her tonight. I’d only respond if spoken to, and even then, only neutrally. I want to see if she’ll break first.
I know I’m playing games with my wife now, even if it’s one‑sided. But I tell myself it’s a test—of our love, our compatibility. How long could I keep it up? Days? Weeks? Months?
Still, there’s a small, cruel hope in me: that she’ll come to my side, rub my shoulder, and bridge the distance I’ve built.
When I finally open the door, the house greets me with the sound of a children’s show—bright voices echoing through a dim, airless room. No one in sight. I set my things down and take in the scene. Disaster.
Stale food on the floor. Toys everywhere. Dishes stacked and buzzing with flies. I never asked for perfection. Never expected dinner waiting on the table. But I thought at least common sense might fill in the gaps. What has she been doing all day?
The answer finds me before I finish the thought.
She’s in the bedroom, the only light coming from her phone screen. The kids sleep beside her. She looks up at me, squinting through the dark.
“Hey,” she says.
“Hi,” I leave her with my reply and continue to the bathroom.
Closing the door behind me, I sit on the toilet seat and just wait. What am I waiting for? She’s not going to ask me about my day. I was just the one‑second break in her infinite scrolling. God, I want to snatch that fucking phone right out of her hands and whip it toward a wall. I want it in pieces. I want her to be faced with what’s happening around her.
“Hunny?” Just then, her voice—from the other side of the door.
This is a pivotal moment in my mind. I like to think the next words out of her mouth could change my entire outlook.
I respond, “Yeah?”
“You gonna be long? ’Cause I gotta take a shower.”
THIS WAS IT. THIS WAS THE STRAW THAT BROKE THE CAMEL’S BACK. I AM AN OBSTACLE FOR HER TO MOVE AROUND. I AM THE EXTRA PAIR OF ARMS TO TAKE THE KIDS WHEN SHE NEEDS TO SCROLL. I AM THE MONEY‑MAKER, THE PERSONAL ACCOUNTANT, THE MAID!
SHE’S GONE. MY WIFE DOES NOT EXIST. IN HER PLACE IS NOW THIS THING, WALKING AROUND MY HOUSE DEAD. DEAD LIKE A GIRL’S BODY THAT WASHED UP ON SHORE. SHE HAS NO LEAVES. SHE CREAKS AND GROANS AND SNAPS WITH THE WIND. HER FOUNDATION IS DYING!
“Be out in a sec,” I respond softly.


PART 3: US

Three days. We have not touched each other in three days. We exchange information on a need‑to‑know basis. I listen to a few snarky comments about her work. I received a “good night” the first day, but not these last two. We are just floating around each other, completing daily tasks for the children. If it wasn’t for the kids, we might be considered complete robots in this house.
Of course this is all devastating. I really believed I’d break by the first night after seeing a glimpse of hope in her—something to make me throw it all out and get back to living. I did not anticipate three days and counting.
I cannot think at work. My mind is somewhere else. I’m afraid I’m beginning to look like her from the outside. Whatever disease she has is affecting me. A dying disease. The children most definitely feel this, even though they can’t say it.
I can see the confusion in their eyes. I feel their distress and frustrations. They’ve been especially hard these last few days.
I’m just tired. I’ve been fighting an emotional battle for too long. I believe my body is telling me that it must come to an end.
Is this justifiable enough? If I slid her a paper that said “Petition for Divorce” across it, how would she react? Maybe she would hide a moment of relief behind aggravation. What a waste. A waste of life and time. But what about the kids? Am I dooming them to a reality that’s now split? What kind of mental turmoil would they accumulate under the surface, I wonder—things they would only later in life be able to diagnose.
“Oh, I must have felt this way because I watched my parents go through a divorce when I was young.”
“I never felt the effective operation of a real family dynamic because my dad split with my mom.”
“Mom’s new boyfriend beats her up ’cause she stopped having sex with him.”
I can hear it all now. But this isn’t my fault. I would have never built a future around someone if I could have foreseen this. That’s not to say I regret my children. They’re the only thing that keeps me going.
I stand in the kitchen with a cup of coffee pressed to my nose, waiting for it to cool.
From the corner of my eye, I see her stumble out of the bedroom and make a beeline for the couch. That cushion must be molded to her by now. I feel the glare forming before I can stop it—so I smooth my face.
“Where’s the remote?” she asks through a yawn.
I wait a beat. “Good morning.”
She digs into the couch, pulling out toy cars, broken graham crackers, a sock.
“Hunny, did you lose the remote?” she says, not hearing me at all.
“Good morning,” I repeat, a little sharper this time.
“Seriously, now I can’t turn shows on for the kids. God damn it.” Her hands slap her lap—that sound of defeat.
“GOOD MORNING!” I yell, the words ripping out of me before I can stop them. The whole house jolts awake. She jumps, eyes wide, confusion freezing her face.
“What the fuck?” she stammers.
Through the monitor, the baby starts crying. Of course.
“Why did you do that? You fucking woke him up.” She stands, disgust curling her lip as she moves past me toward the bedroom. “The fuck is wrong with you?”
I blow across the top of my coffee, steadying myself for the storm I just invited.
SCREAMING. CRYING. YANKING. SPILLING. THROWING.
The house is chaos today. I sit with my feet up on the ottoman. Comfy. My second cup of coffee is now room temp. She darts back and forth, addressing one disaster after another. She’s covered in damp drool and tears. Maybe a bit of applesauce too. Or puke. I don’t know.
She looks toward me with that disgusted look again.
“Are you gonna do anything?” she yells over the sounds of a possessed two‑year‑old. He thrashes on the floor, inconsolable. In the background, the youngest cries to be freed from the constraints of his high chair.
“I can’t hear you. There are too many kids screaming,” I say calmly. Without responding, she scoffs and grits her teeth. She blocks me out with a face that says, “I’ll deal with that comment later.”
She yells at the two‑year‑old to get up on his feet. I can see her hairline drenched in sweat. Now, in this instance, I would never let things get this out of control normally. I’d be rushing to her side, distracting the youngest with freedom, and flying away with the possessed two‑year‑old—somewhere we could contain the sounds.
But if I’m being honest, I kind of liked this. The more they cried, the more frustrated she got, the better I felt.
Normal parts of my subconscious would tell me I’m being an asshole. But it’s quiet—as if my body and mind have found the best path forward. A collected agreement to salvage our mind and our soul. I’ve been fighting too long. I’ve given up what felt like everything that made me me.
“I can’t drive a manual. Get rid of that dumb car. It’s not a family car anyway.”
“These hunting trips are really not helpful when I’m stuck with the kids.”
“I don’t want your friends coming here. They’re too loud, and they’ll wake the kids up.”
I think eventually it’ll whittle down, and I’ll be the only thing left to remove.
It’s frightening how fast the mind can evolve—how fast conclusions can form. Just a week ago, I was fantasizing about her—some invisible love I thought was between us. But I was naïve.
How many times would I go back and forth between two realities? Which one is true? Maybe neither of them are. Maybe it’s something in between.
No. I’m on the right path. I’m sticking to my guns. Just stop thinking so much.
After enduring a napless day, the kids quickly fell asleep. If this were any other night, it would be a great opportunity to hang out—kids are out early, gaining an extra hour of time. Shame. From the passing looks on her face, I could tell she was exhausted. She would probably go to sleep herself soon.
She catches me in the bathroom, brushing my teeth. I don’t look up, but I feel her eyes on me.
“What’s going on?” she asks, exasperated.
Mouth still full of toothpaste, I answer flatly, “What’s up?”
She stares, brow raised, scowling.
“You’ve been acting weird. You didn’t really help with the kids at all today either, so that’s awesome.”
I keep my eyes on the mirror and spit.
“Yeah? Well, I’m sorry. I feel fine.”
She exhales hard, shaking her head as her shoulders drop.
“Whatever. Goodnight.” She starts down the dark hallway.
“That’s it?” I call out before she’s gone.
She stops, sighs. “What do you mean?”
I turn to face her. “You don’t have anything else to say?”
She opens her hands and lets them slap her thighs. “Nope. You obviously want to fight about something.”
“Oh, I do? Or maybe I just want to hear what my wife’s thinking.”
“Hah.” She shakes her head, eyes closed. “What do you want me to say?”
I lean against the doorframe, closing the space between us. “I want you to express something. I want you to show me that you feel anything—even a little bit—about us.”
She snaps back, “I feel fine. The kids are a lot, and it’d be nice to have some help, hunny. I’m tired.”
“You’re tired? I’ve been tired for a year!” My voice rises.
She covers her face. “Oh my God. Please.”
I stand upright now, jaw set. “See? You don’t care. I’ve been shouting it from the rooftops—I’m not okay! This relationship isn’t okay. You’re just someone I live with.”
She lowers her hands and stares through me. “Okay. Then divorce me. I don’t know what you want from me.”
“Okay,” I say quietly.
She doesn’t react—she’s already left the conversation in her head.
“Yeah. Awesome.” She turns away.
Her footsteps fade down the hall. I stand in the doorway, toothbrush still in hand.
I get a sense she doesn’t realize that I’m honest in my response. Doesn’t matter. That was all I needed to hear. My mind was teetering before, but now it’s clear. The fight isn’t what hurts anymore; it’s knowing that I’ve stopped wanting to fix it. I want to divorce my wife.

PART 4: THE END OF THE WORLD
     
“Petition for Dissolution of Marriage.”
The freshly printed document sits on my desk. Blank.
My hand holds a pen.
Click. Click. Click.
I can’t believe this is the culmination. Signing it would make everything real. For now, it’s just paper—harmless in its stillness.
I picture her reaction. Relief, probably. Maybe she’s been waiting for me to make the first move so she can say, “He’s the one who wanted to end it. I was happy. He was delusional.”
A sigh escapes—half dread, half release. I don’t give my thoughts time to negotiate with my heart. I press the pen down and begin to write.
As usual, I rise over the hill and see the house.
Empty.
Her car’s gone. Unusual for a Monday at four. She always leaves work, picks up the kids, and comes straight home. They’re too much for her to manage anywhere else.
Maybe she’s grocery shopping. Maybe she’s with someone else.
I don’t care.
I pull into the drive and pinch the folded paper between my fingers like it’s something fragile.
The sidewalk is lined with forgotten toys—sun‑bleached, dirt‑caked, wrecked by rain. I was always too lazy to put them away. Maybe I hoped they’d be used again someday.
We used to play outside together.
We used to take pictures, view them later after the kids fell asleep, and laugh.
Time stood still back then.
Now, the toys are relics of something that withered—something that never had the nurture to grow.
I kneel down and run my hand across a pair of rusted training wheels. I spin them and watch the rim turn until it slows to a stop.
Tears erupt.
I TRIED. GOD KNOWS I TRIED, AND I CAN DIE IN CONTENT KNOWING I DID EVERYTHING RIGHT—KNOWING THAT I DIDN’T THROW A SECOND MORE OF MY LIFE AWAY.
Oh God. Please help me get through this one.
It’s been two hours. I’ve held the same position at the head of the dining room table for two hours. The paper is in front of me. I can hear the hands of a wall clock tick. Every second I exhale, it’s like sick air leaving my lungs.
I’ve been waiting for that sound—the click of a door handle. Now that my mind accepts that this is over, it floods with the image of adultery. I see her laughing, her hands running across the chest of another man—a man more masculine than me. I see them making love. She cries out like she’s been holding it in all along. I can feel my grip tighten in my sweaty palms.
I shouldn’t care, really. As far as I’m concerned, she can go on and fuck up someone else’s life all she wants the second she signs this. I feel bad for the poor bastard who pours his heart out to her—a guy who doesn’t know she’ll go cold the second she’s done with him.
I’m reminded of her mother—a woman who’s been through two failed marriages and is currently on her third. Was this seed planted long ago? Was my wife predestined to fall out of love? There’s a fine line between influence and inheritance. I don’t think I’m comfortable with either answer.
Click.
I hear the door open. I pull my hands from under my chin and sit upright. My heart begins to beat a little faster now.
I hear the kids stumble into the house. I hear the crinkling of plastic bags. Then, her voice. Out of breath.
“Okay, go find Daddy.”
The kids run past the dining room; they don’t notice me. I hear her footsteps follow.
The heart rate increases a bit more.
Finally, she comes into view. She’s holding grocery sacks and has a diaper bag hanging off one shoulder. Her hair is tangled and messy. She breathes heavily. She stops and examines me for a moment.
“What’re you doing?”
I don’t respond. Instead, my eye gestures to the paper.
She speaks like she’s got other things to attend to. “Hunny, what? What is that?”
I lean forward and rest my elbows on the table.
“We need to talk,” I say softly.
She looks at the paper, then back at me. Then back at the paper. She slowly stumbles across the room, her bags dragging. She leans over the table and squints.
Her head shoots back up toward me. Her expression is horrified.
“What? Hunny, what the fuck is this?”
I blink slowly and inhale before spilling the news.
“We need to start this process. It’ll be harder if we sit on—”
I’m cut off by her eruption of tears and shock.
“No! What are you doing right now? Are you fucking kidding me?”
She lets all her bags drop out of her arms as her hands cup her mouth. Her eyes are piercing and welling up. I resist the urge, but I can feel the lump in my throat growing. My eyes fill with pressure. The sight of her like this has always broken me—even now.
“PLEASE. DO NOT ACT LIKE THIS RIGH—”
I’m cut off again.
“SO I MADE ONE SARCASTIC COMMENT OUT OF ANGER AND YOU SERIOUSLY GO AND DO THIS? YOU WANT TO DIVORCE ME?” She’s unraveling.
I can feel my tears forming, but I stop them in their tracks.
“This cannot be happening right now. Oh my God, I feel sick. Please. Please, please tell me this isn’t real.” She pleads. She begins to back away.
I don’t know what to feel in this moment. I didn’t expect this reaction from her—as if she’s blindsided by this. How could that be possible? It’s been so obvious for so long!
“Stop pretending like you love me! You haven’t for a long time!” I yell with my eyes closed.
She lowers her hands as a newfound shock crawls across her face.
“You think I don’t love you?”
I say the obvious, “I’m your husband. I know you better than anyone in the world. I can see that I’m just someone that’s in your life—not a part of it.”
“DAVID!” she yells. “I LOVE YOU! I’VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU!”
I shake my head and let it hang.
“Please don’t say that. YOU’RE LYING TO YOURSELF!”
“You’re the only person I ever wanted to spend my life with,” she adds.
“Stop. Right now.” My voice is buried in my chest.
She begins to step closer, trying to make her words clearer.
“You’ve seen me at my absolute worst. Lately it’s been hard. Yes. Okay? My body doesn’t feel like mine, and I’ve gone through this before, and we talked about it then, and we talked about it with this last pregnancy too!”
Her voice pleads harder now. “I was waiting. And I thought you were waiting too—waiting for this to pass so we could get back to being us. Also—” she begins to dig in her pocket. She pulls out a single packaged tampon and throws it on the table.
“—I’M ON MY PERIOD! I GET CRANKY. DOESN’T MEAN I DON’T LOVE YOU, DAVID!” she yells in anger now.
“Sign the paper, Mel.” I can’t take her words anymore. Every stab of confession feels like it’s tearing my mind apart.
She’s frozen, just staring at me—trying to really figure it out for herself. Or maybe she’s just mustering up some emotional excuse to keep me holding out a little longer.
I see the kids wander up to the edge of the room. They keep their distance, watching as if they know.
When she speaks now, it’s quiet and pointed.
“Hunny, I think you have some serious issues you need to work out. You’ve built up some—” her tears break her words, “some kind of delusion, I think. I love you, but if you can honestly sit there and believe this, without a shadow of a doubt, then I don’t know what else to say.”
She squats down in a catcher’s position and lets her head fall into her hands. Her dangling hair covers her face.
I hear her whisper to the floor, “I always loved you…”
I sit on her words for a moment.
“You know this is all for show, right? You know she’s afraid that if you leave, it’d be a huge inconvenience for her. Who’s gonna help with the kids and pay the water bill this month?”
I don’t need you for this.
“Are you joking? This is your test! If you break now, right here, then you are doomed to be a prisoner for the rest of your life—a prisoner to his own mind who’s too afraid. You need me in this moment more than you’ve ever needed me.”
My mind darts. Now all the voices come back at once. My heart racing faster now.
“SHE’S STILL LYING!”
“YOU’RE FOLDING. YOU’RE A BOY!”
“SHE FANTASIZES ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE!”
“TOUCHING YOU DISGUSTS HER!”
“SHE HATES EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU!”
A warm hand on the side of my face.
It all stops.
The voices fade. The air goes still.
I open my eyes, and I see hers—deep, beautiful brown eyes. She’s searching for something in mine—as if she’s telling me to fight.
All the sounds fade away now. There’s nothing. Nothing but us.
Silence breaks when her lips form.
“I love you.” She breathes the words.
I feel her breath hit me. So close. Her fingers brush away a tear drying on the corner of my eye. Her tears, still falling.
My heart slows down. Way, way down.
Thump, thump… thump… thump.
The storm passed, and I looked down into the black mud. There’s something green trying to grow from under my foot.

1oa6sqy,https://i.redd.it/v7i042i5mxvf1.png,Micro Gym & Wellness spa - I have a Vision...,"I just started breaking ground on a large 2-storey shop on my country acreage with a 900 sq ft attached private gym. The small local town is 2 miles away and there is no gym - and likely not enough clientele to support one.

The vision: a high end, luxury/exclusive gym space for a handful of interested local memberships and some private training or small group classes. There will be 1.5 bathrooms (one with a large rain shower), a coffee/protein/snack bar (included in membership), and a covered outdoor patio space with 6-person sauna and cold plunge. The gym is designed with 14 ft ceilings and East facing clear glass roll up garage doors for a large, bright space. It is surrounded by woods for an ""immersed in nature"" feel that is intended to be part of the appeal for non-city dwellers.

Eventually, the second floor of the shop will be a 1200 sq ft studio space for dance/yoga/fitness classes, with a small rental room for an on-site RMT.

I recently got my NASM CPT, and I am working on my Health & Wellness coach. Next year is level 1 Precision Nutrition and 200 hr yoga instructor.

Total income generation required to pay mortgage on my building is currently $1500/month.

1. Is this a terrible idea, or kind of brilliant?!
We started the project for personal use, because we are 30 minutes from the nearest large city, we have a tiny house and I need to move my squat rack out of the living room. As we told friends in the area about what we were designing, they started asking about memberships and personal training and access to the sauna and it kind of organically grew into this whole business idea. The financials seem favourable because we were able to swing it with a HELOC and build on our property vs trying to open a commercial space.

2. What would you say is an absolute must for equipment? The gym is a lean-to style added to the side of the main shop, so it's only 18 ft wide and 50 ft long - but the portion by the bathroom is intended as a coffee counter/lounge space, so actual useable gym space is more like 18 x 36.

3. What would you charge monthly for relatively exclusive use of a higher-end gym space with outdoor sauna and included consumables. The espresso machine, protein powders & assorted milks, pre-workout, protein bars etc - this is important to me because I want my clients to have literally everything they need included. I am currently a private housecleaner for high-income families and they pay me very well to take decisions off their plate - they don't have to make a list of what needs to be cleaned, I just clean and organize as needed and invoice appropriately. My target gym client wants the same thing...less decisions/all-inclusive, luxury feel etc.

If the whole thing is an epic failure, at the very least I have a sweet gym space and hangout area for my family and friends LOL

1oa6sg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverfifty/comments/1oa6sg2/dating_advice_for_women_over_35_the_hard_truth/,Dating Advice for Women Over 35: The Hard Truth From a Coach Who’s Seen It All,"Every week I read posts from women saying how hard dating is, how they keep meeting the wrong men, and how “there are no good ones left.” I get it. Dating today is exhausting. But after years on dating apps and working as a certified life coach specializing in women’s empowerment and relationships, I can tell you exactly *why* this happens and how to actually change your results.

If this helps even a few women find the love they deserve, its worth this post.

# Who I Am

I’m 54(M), a certified life coach and former sex coach. I’ve been single for over a decade, not because I can’t be in a relationship, but because I refuse to settle for a relationship that steals my peace. I’ve had short relationships, I’ve had casual ones, and I’ve learned a lot from both.

I’m not bitter or jaded. I still believe deeply in love. But I believe in *earned* love, not fantasy, not manipulation, and not entitlement.

# The Reality Check

Dating sucks. for everyone. but especially for women over 35 who are serious about finding something real.

Social media and dating apps have warped our expectations. Stanford’s 2023 study on dating apps found that **over 70% of users quit within three months**, and women over 40 experience the highest burnout. Most people keep using the same failed approach and expect a different result.

The problem isn’t that “all men are trash.” The problem is strategy. The way most women present themselves, communicate, and filter men is pushing away the kind of men they actually want.

# Masculine and Feminine Energy Got Twisted

For thousands of years, the male role was hunter and provider, and the female role was nurturer and connector. That’s not outdated sexism. It’s evolutionary polarity. It’s what creates attraction. Women fought for independence, built powerful careers, and learned to stand alone. That’s amazing. I’m a feminist myself and believe the world improves the more women lead. But the dating world didn’t evolve with that shift. outdated advice taught women to hide their interest, never text first, make him chase, and “don’t be too available.” That mindset kills real connection.

Let me say this clearly: **It’s beautiful when a woman takes the lead.**

Some of the best relationships I’ve ever seen started that way. In my own experience, the most powerful connection I had began with a woman who took charge of our first date. She chose the spot, suggested playing pool afterward, and even called me after to say she had a great time. That simple act of honesty and confidence was magnetic. It showed warmth, courage, and emotional maturity.

When a woman takes the lead, it doesn’t make her masculine. It makes her authentic. If you like someone, show it. If you want to text first, do it. If you have an idea for the first date, suggest it. Break the stupid rules. Be your true self. Get out of your comfort zone. The right man won’t see it as “too forward.” He’ll see it as refreshing.

# The Harsh Truth About Dating App Profiles

Most women’s profiles kill their chances before the first message even happens.

* Blurry, filtered photos with sunglasses, hats, or group shots.
* Bios full of demands like: *“Make me laugh.” “Take the lead.” “Don’t just say hi.” “Know how to treat a woman.” “No coffee dates.”*
* Nothing about who *you* actually are or what you bring to a relationship.

That’s like applying for a job with no résumé but a page of requirements.

A 2022 Pew study found that **84% of men swipe left on low-effort or demanding profiles**, even when they find the woman attractive. Why? Because it screams entitlement and zero warmth.

You’re not competing on looks. You’re competing on energy. Authenticity, kindness, and vulnerability are what attract quality men.

# The Photo Problem Nobody Talks About

This is uncomfortable, but it’s the truth.

Most women hide their true body type online. They post only selfies, cropped shots, or photos from years ago. From a man’s perspective, that’s a red flag. It’s not about being thin or curvy. It’s about honesty.

Physical attraction matters to both sexes. That’s not shallow. That’s human. I personally am not attracted to larger women, and that’s okay, just like women have their own preferences. Men talk about this privately all the time but rarely out loud, because they don’t want to sound cruel. The result? Women never hear the truth and wonder why great conversations end after the first meeting.

If your photos don’t show your real body, you’re setting yourself up for disappointment. Show a clear, recent, full-body photo. No baggy jackets, no cropped frames, no filters. Own who you are. It’s better to attract fewer men who truly like *you* than dozens who like a filtered illusion.

Confidence and honesty are far sexier than filtered photos. Stop with the filters! When I see even one photo of a woman without makeup, it says more than words ever could. It’s not just about looks, it shows confidence, honesty, transparency, and authenticity. It tells me this is a woman comfortable in her own skin, and it gives me a glimpse of the face I’d actually wake up next to in the morning, the real, natural her, not a filtered version for show.

# Practical Fixes That Actually Work

1. **Use honest photos.** Stop with the filters. I cant say this enough, **stop with the filters**. Men want to see the real you. No smoothing, no distortion, no fake lighting tricks. (some women even change their eye color!). Filters make you look insecure and dishonest. you might think its just a minor touch up, but from much bitter experience, I can tell you that you look different in real life from your filtered pictures. Post **recent**, clear photos with a real smile and your natural look. You’ll stand out because honesty has become rare.
2. **Put effort into your bio.** Talk about what excites you, what kind of relationship you want to *build*, and what you offer in return. Example: “I love deep talks, humor, and small daily moments of connection. I want a relationship built on trust and laughter.”
3. **Be open to simple first messages.** A “Hi” is fine. That’s how real conversations start. Expecting men to write poetry before you even respond is unrealistic. Give them space to show effort after you engage.
4. **Coffee dates are gold.** They take the pressure off and filter out the fuck boys. They’re casual, cheap, and perfect for real connection. I once went on a date with a woman who proudly told me, “Whenever I’m hungry and want a nice restaurant dinner, I set up a date.” That mentality ruins the dating pool for everyone. Coffee or walk dates show you’re genuine, not transactional. Plus, interview dinner dates are expensive and exhausting.
5. **Understand your attachment style.** This one’s a game changer. We all have one of three main attachment styles:

* **Secure:** You’re comfortable with closeness, can communicate needs calmly, and recover fast from conflict.
* **Anxious:** You crave closeness and reassurance but often worry the other person will pull away.
* **Avoidant:** You value independence so much that closeness feels uncomfortable or threatening.

Learning your attachment style helps you stop repeating negative dating patterns and date more consciously. Read *Attached* by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller, or study attachment styles online. Understanding this concept alone can save years of frustration.  
  


6. **Show empathy toward men.** Men face constant rejection online. A 2021 Hinge study showed that men send three times more likes than women but only match with about 10–15% of them. So if a guy reaches out respectfully, that’s effort. And if you match with someone you think might be compatible, show your nurturing and loving side. As Logan Ury says, *“Be more interested than trying to be interesting.”* That’s how genuine connection starts.  
I cant tell you how many dates I was on that the woman has not once asked me anything about myself.  
  


7. **Lead with warmth, not defense and demands.** Men don’t want to feel like they’re applying for a job. Profiles that say “Don’t waste my time,” “Don’t just say hi,” and “Know how to treat a woman” feel like lectures. Replace that tone with openness. Talk about what inspires you, not what irritates you. And yes, I know there are plenty of idiots out there. But your profile shouldn’t talk to the idiots. It should talk to your potential *quality* match. All those “No’s” and “Don’ts” repel the good men and do nothing to stop the idiots anyway.

# Treat Dating Like The Serious Project It Is

Finding a meaningful relationship is one of the biggest investments of your life. Yet most people spend more time writing a grocery list than learning how to date well.

If you really want to find love, treat it like you would buying a home or finding your dream career. Study it. Prepare for it. Learn the craft. Love is a choice!

If I could recommend only one resource, it would be the book *How Not To Die Alone* by Logan Ury. That book should be mandatory reading for anyone who wants a relationship. It explains dating psychology, self-sabotage, and emotional patterns better than anything else out there.

Then dive into podcasts, books, and YouTube videos with Esther Perel, Dr. Alexandra Solomon, Matthew Hussey, Mel Robbins, and my all time favorite Logan Ury. Learn communication, boundaries, and how to build emotional safety.

Relationships don’t fail because people stop loving each other. They fail because people never learned *how* to love in a healthy, sustainable way. That’s a skill. And you can learn it.

# The Bottom Line

You’re not too old. You’re not too late. But if your results haven’t changed, your approach needs to.

Stop chasing attention. Stop hiding behind filters and lists. Start showing who you really are.

You don’t need hundreds of matches. You need one that feels peaceful, mutual, and real.

You’ll only find that when you lead with authenticity, effort, and honesty, not fear, entitlement, or performance.

Dating isn’t hopeless. It’s just under-practiced. Do the work, and it’ll change your life.

  
Feel free to ask me anything else I didnt cover here or that you want to know more of. All disrespectful comments with hate and idiocy will be ignored.

  
Good luck, and I wish you all to find the love you deserve (and give).

1oa6s68,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1oa6s68/i_dont_think_we_cure_depression_right/,I don’t think we cure depression right,"Note: I know this might sound idealistic, but I genuinely think we're missing the social and preventive side of mental health.

According to statistics, nearly 30% of adults have been diagnosed with depression at least once in their lifetime. Right now, nearly 5% of adults are still facing depression. Just 5% and that doesn’t even feel like a huge number of people you actually know and talk to on a regular basis, right? But on the other hand, that’s every 20th person you actually know.

The problem is that the 5% of people having depression is more like an estimate from therapists, and the actual number is likely even higher. The issue is that not everyone wants to see a therapist, and not everyone realizes that they need to, because their mental health isn’t in a normal state at all. Some just don’t have money for therapy or medication. Some are focused on building their careers, raising a child, and don’t have enough time for themselves to actually go to a therapist and ask for help.

What is actually wrong? It seems like it’s natural to have depression from time to time, and 30% of adults have faced or will face it during their lifetime. That’s our biology, right?

I agree in some way, but let’s look at one of the most common periods in life when people face depression for the first time. Sure, that’s all just statistics, but most people usually experience depression during these stages:

Young adults (ages 18–25) - have the highest rates of depression. Most people start to feel that something is wrong right at this age. The problem? How are you actually supposed to know that you’re depressed and that something is wrong with you when no one literally talks about it? We all know there are therapists, but let’s be honest let's imagine you just don’t have money for one, and you need to ask for financial support from your parents. Not everyone actually thinks that depression is a serious issue. Your parents might simply say, “You’re all right, why spend money on silly things?” The problem is that this person missed the opportunity to treat their depression before it might turn into a serious disease.

According to statistics, the highest suicide rates are in the 15–29 age group. How is this related? The issue is that nearly 65% of people who decided to commit suicide had major depressive disorder or another depressive illness at the time.

The other group that is highly impacted is people aged 60+. Seems strange, right? Most commonly, this age group should be happier just because they usually own a house, have a car, have children or even grandchildren. They can live a good life. In the EU, you have a good pension at this age, which allows you quite a lot. You’re most likely to have finances and financial support from your children.

The issue is that loneliness is a tough thing. Loneliness is when you can’t really talk with someone when you truly need to. You want to talk about how hard it actually is to live alone in your house without your wife, with whom you were married for nearly 50 years. But with whom? Your neighbors aren’t really interested. Your kids might be too busy with their work or raising their own children, and your friends might not even be alive at this age.

There’s nothing wrong with having your own free time, nothing wrong with raising children and going to work to build your career. To be honest, both are good decisions. But the issue is that many people around you might need just 5 minutes of your time to feel happier and needed.

You might say there are nearly 332 million people in the world facing depression right now. “I don’t have 5 minutes per day for each of them.” You know, you’re actually right. But I didn’t ask you to start spamming everyone in the world with emails like “If you feel depressed, I’m here for you.” Just look around.

Every 20th person has been diagnosed with depression. The actual number is even higher. Maybe it’s your 16-year-old son who loves a girl, confessed to her, and got rejected. Maybe it’s your wife, overloaded from being on maternity leave and not really leaving the house to have some fun or maybe she just doesn’t have friends to have fun with. Maybe it’s your boyfriend who’s been sad for a few months and you don’t know the actual reason. Maybe it’s your friend who just got fired from their job or got divorced. Maybe it’s your classmate who got bullied in school just because his clothes don’t look as nice as yours, just because he’s from a poor family and can’t afford them.

Why do we all send people to therapy when we can prevent the initial thing that causes depression? Sure, it’s completely fine to ask a professional for help, but imagine you’re told to unload a gun. You wouldn’t shoot the gun until it was empty, would you? Most likely, you’d just take out the clip.

So why don’t we do the same with depression? Sure, it’s great that there are therapists who are willing to help, but instead why not stop bullying your classmate just because he doesn’t look cool? Why don’t you come back home and talk to your wife, who hasn’t been leaving the house much, and maybe tell her to call a friend and go for a walk? Or if she doesn’t have a friend, why not say, “Hi, honey, I’m so proud of you. I know you’re tired. Let me take a week off, stay with the kids, cook us some food, and we’ll just watch that movie we’ve been putting off for so long.” Why don’t we call our dad or mom, ask them how they feel, and invite them to our house for dinner? Why don’t you ask your friend how he’s feeling after his divorce and invite him for a walk with coffee?

All these actions are not that hard to do, and they don’t require much effort. But you can actually improve someone’s life, or even prevent someone from losing it.

Be supportive and less toxic, guys. Every action you take actually matters. Today, you might spend just 5 minutes to prevent the inevitable. And tomorrow, a small act of support from someone else might help you.",4,1760820158.0,selfimprovement,4,1.0,False

So, I was staring into my bathroom mirror this morning - you know, the sacred pre-coffee ritual where you try to remember if you’re actually a person or just three eye bags in a trench coat - when suddenly my reflection WINKED. Now, before you ask: no, it wasn’t sleep deprivation. Yes, I did throw my contour brush like a holy water grenade. And that’s when I remembered that viral video I watched last night - ""Mirrors: Portals for Demons"" - and realized… oh sugar honey iced tea, my vanity might be hosting interdimensional happy hour.

Let’s get this straight - I’m not saying your gorgeous full-length mirror is definitely a demonic drive-thru. But according to this wild video (and my permanently startled eyebrows), mirrors might be more than just your #1 critic during bikini season. Ancient cultures believed these shiny bois were literal portals for spirits - which explains why every time I try winged eyeliner, some entity clearly possesses my dominant hand.

Here’s the hilarious part though: the video suggests demons prefer fancy mirrors. So that $400 Anthropologie masterpiece with floral frames? Basically a VIP lounge for hellspawn. Meanwhile, my IKEA mirror held together with duct tape and existential dread? Demon repellent. Who knew budget shopping had metaphysical benefits!

But babes, let’s look at this through a tarot lens. Ever pull The Moon card during a reading? That’s your deck screaming ""Girl, your self-perception is WACK!"" Mirrors work the same way - they show what you believe, not what’s real. That “I woke up like this” filter you mentally apply? It’s not demons distorting your reflection… unless we’re talking about the demon of unreasonable societal beauty standards. (Satan’s toxic cousin, Barbie.)

Now for practical tips from your favorite mystically-inclined dude: If you’re worried your vanity’s hosting a demon rave, cleanse it like you would a toxic ex’s energy. Burn sage while playing Lizzo at max volume. Draw protective sigils with lipstick (red for power, nude for subtlety). Or just tape a photo of Keanu Reeves to the glass - nobody messes with Baba Yaga.

The real tea? Most “mirror demons” are just manifestations of our insecurities. That shadowy figure you swore moved in the glass at 3AM? Probably sleep paralysis. Or your sleep mask sliding off. Or that third margarita finally hitting. But! If your mirror starts showing you as a confident queen who doesn’t need validation from Tinder fuckboys? Keep that portal OPEN, sis.

Let me leave you with this thought: maybe mirrors aren’t doors for demons… but for self-reflection. Literally. The video’s fun horror angle aside, what if these “portals” actually show us what we need to heal? That acne flare-up? A reminder to hydrate. Those crow’s feet? A map of all the times you laughed till wine came out your nose. That weird chin hair? Okay, that’s just genetics being rude.

So next time you pass a mirror, wink back. Whether it’s a demon, your higher self, or just sleep deprivation - own it. And if all else fails, cover it with a blanket and watch Netflix. Let the demons binge Riverdale without you.

Stay sparkling, witches. And maybe invest in some fog-resistant shower mirrors - if you’re gonna battle interdimensional entities, at least let them see your flawless skincare routine.

So, I placed an order at the local ice cream place through door dash. wouldn’t have wanted to make the door dash driver drive all out for a scoop of ice cream or just one item. I felt bad, and added like a layered sundae situation plus a medium coffee ice cream drink. 

I couldn’t bring the ice cream home, it would melt by then. I also wouldn’t want to waste food, but it’s too much ice cream. I could only eat so much.

She was relieved and thankful that her home had been spared, but it came with such a sense of guilt that she felt unwelcome at the survivors group meetings. So many there had lost people or their possessions and she felt like she was complaining about nothing when she tried to join. The only thing she had lost was her peace of mind.

A whiff of smoke had her terrified and struggling for breath, as she chanted to herself a litany that she was safe, untouched. The forest right next to her still smelled of fire and when the wind changed in the night, she would wake up gasping from the nightmares that came where she didn't escape in time or she watched her loved ones burn in the forest, reaching out to her, asking why she hadn't warned or found them in time. Why she let them burn. And no matter how many times she reminded herself of the truth, in those first few moments awake, she was convinced her dreams were real.

Headstrong and stubborn as ever, Emily refused to seek mental help until she started falling apart at the seams. After all, she reasoned, she hadn't lost anything, so it was wrong of her to go and cry over a few moments of fear. But those assurances meant nothing when she woke, panting, from the nightmares and they did nothing to lull her to sleep when she was too terrified of the dreams to go to bed. The lack of sleep led her to chug more and more coffee through the day just to be able to function, but that led worse incidents during the day. And the terror of her days made her fear her dreams more and more. The smoke smell was lessening, but that just made the occasional drifts hit her harder and panic her more than even during the blaze. Rather than feeling under siege as she had before, it was almost as though the smell was a malevolent entity lurking in the shadows, waiting to ambush her in her few peaceful moments. Eventually, she gave in and went to her doctor for some sort of pill, or something, and he insisted that Emily try therapy first.

Emily tried to demur, to come up with excuses, but lost the fight. As a form of healing, her therapist suggested she resume her hikes through the area. Those had been the main reason why she had bought the house, after all, and she had always found such a sense of peace out alone in the woods, allowing nature to soothe her soul as the whispering breezes blew away the distractions and noise of the everyday world. Perhaps that had been a part of the reason she had allowed her stress to spiral out of control; she had been unable to find her peace in the woods. She had tried another place, but she had barely made it a quarter mile before she succumbed to the irrational fear that the fires were lurking in the distance, just waiting on a change in the wind to swoop down and devour her.

It took several tries before Emily was able to venture into the woods. At first, she was terrified of the smell and the dark, bare trees in front of her. Then, she couldn't help her heart breaking as she remembered how vibrant and alive these woods had been. When she ventured deeper in, she came to one of her favorite springtime trails, where the maidenhair grew wild and the trees formed a tunnel roofed in a translucent green kaleidoscope that had chartreuse fit next to emerald, a stunning monochromatic stained glass ceiling that moved and changed in the wind. It was desolate and heartbreaking without the vibrant greens above, and the trees were stark without their leaves, like skeletons without the wrapping of their flesh. It wasn't spring yet, but this area had never been this bare, full of live oaks as it was. She followed the bigger path around until it dead-ended in a pond that dried into a meadow filled with thistles in the late spring and summer. The path was submerged here, but she knew there were three that diverged through the meadow.

One led back along the dirt road the park service used to get around, but stayed on the opposite side of the stream, one led through a small copse to a crossroads, and one led to a concrete sidewalk with three steps and then more sidewalk over a small wash. The whole thing was strange. A sidewalk in the middle of a park? It must have been to a ranger station or something that was removed years ago, but the sidewalk was left. Or maybe, her subconscious muttered, it burned down and wasn't rebuilt. After all, if they were bringing in machinery to remove a mobile home or something, why wouldn't they also remove the sidewalk?

Emily sighed internally as she kept walking along the far side of the stream. There were few people venturing into the devastation, but there were still some there, walking down the dirt road. Life, and people, were returning. She saw places that the grasses were coming back, where the stream had scrubbed the banks clean, and even some trees that hadn't been burned. As she walked back to the neighborhood entrance, she felt drawn to the other side of that sidewalk and the small meadow there. Still, she knew not to attempt the other trail leading to it as it was usually washed out in the winter and too steep to try when the mud was slippery and the rocks that remained loomed out of the ground like teeth, waiting to gash open the unsuspecting or overconfident person's flesh.

As more and more of the park was declared open to the public, she could feel the knot of her anxiety loosening. She was finally able to range further afield, past the old stone and packed earth foundation of some building long gone and see hints of life returning. Not just the grasses, but in places, the bay laurels were springing back already. With each tree that returned, she could feel her peace returning. It was as though the plants were growing over the scars of her heart as well as the land.

As time wore on, Emily's life returned to a new normal. Until the fires returned the next summer. Nothing close by, but close enough that the smell would drift by on a breeze and it, and the past fire, were on everyone's tongue. Despite the smells, Emily was driven to hike more to get away from the talk. She found herself drawn to the thistle meadow, the sidewalk beyond, and the path it connected to more and more. It wasn't just that she wanted to know, she craved the story. Had anything been there, or was the sidewalk added to create a safe path over the wash? If there had been something, what had happened to it? There was nothing she could find online and the local library didn't have an archive of past newspapers. Apparently, when the library burned down in the 60's most local records had been lost.

It was strange. She wasn't drawn to the foundation the way she was drawn to the sidewalk, perhaps because it didn't bring the questions that the sidewalk did. Or perhaps it was that the sidewalk gave her hope. If the building it had connected to had burned, as she suspected, nature had restored the area to the point where only one token of the past remained. And, she secretly hoped, it could do the same for her soul. Still, now that the rainy season had ended, the path up the hill was repaired so she would walk on the sidewalk from start to finish before continuing up to a meadow on the other side. Unlike the thistle meadow, this one grew lupines and grasses and there was a large, flat boulder perfect for sitting on. It had a view of a burned tree in the middle of the meadow and, down the hill, in the distance, the town. It would be a beautiful view once the devastation of the fires was repaired, but she could see the burned swathes, like some great, fiery beast had stretched its tentacles out from the far park to devour all it could of the town before it was defeated by the town's defenders.

For some reason that Emily could not express, that meadow drew her like nothing else. The dead, burned tree spoke to her of the devastation of the fire, the terrors that she still felt ashamed of, yet the grasses and flowers blooming all around and the green trees surrounding the meadow spoke of rebirth and regrowth. The town in the distance was slowly being bulldozed and repaired and, from there, it didn't feel as real as it did when she drove through it. From here, it all felt metaphorical, distanced from her pain and fear.

Sitting there, on that boulder, staring at the tree, Emily found a greater peace than she ever had. On it, even the smoke couldn't bother her. It eventually started reminding her of incense and she found she missed it when the fires were extinguished. When the seasons changed and winter began, she started resenting it more than ever. It wasn't the cold, she could deal with that, it was the rain that she hated. It washed out trails and left the ground a soupy, slimy mess where it pooled. And it made it impossible to climb to her boulder. The one path past the sidewalk was submerged and the other washed out almost immediately when the rains started each year. In desperation one day, when the smoke from people's fireplaces had her on edge for far too long, she tried the rocky, washed out path, but slipped in a muddy slick and came down hard on some of the exposed rocks. It could have been worse, but she still left some of her skin there and a trail of blood droplets as she hobbled back home.

She kept hiking the more civilized connected park with its paved routes and packed earth trails, but it felt like she could never get far enough away from people to take a long, deep breath. What was the point of going hiking if you were going to see people every minute or so? Still, her therapist pushed her to continue hiking, hoping that the exercise and getting out of the house would improve her mood. Unfortunately, her frustration still mounted, and so did her resentment of the jackasses that used wood-burning fireplaces in a town that had been devastated by fire. Without the boulder and her tree, the smoke still disturbed her and winter became one long, disturbing game of hide-and-seek where she tried to hide from her fears and memories and they tried to take her unawares. And a new fear had joined the old ones. Were others still affected by the smell or, she secretly feared, was she the only one affected this way? People were talking of the fires less and less, and maybe everyone else was fine. Perhaps she was the only one upset over it still. Her therapist kept telling her to not compare her experiences and healing journey to others' but it was so easy to say and so difficult to do.

Emily found that more and more often, she was dreaming of the lazy times sitting on that boulder. When she did, it was all she could do to get up and go on with her life instead of returning to sleep to dream of that happy place. But the longer the rains continued, the more they imposed upon her dreams. At first, it was a few drops falling here and there as she was waking up, but eventually she began dreaming of sitting on the boulder as the rains poured down around her and the tree in the meadow caught on fire. The first time it happened, she woke afraid that the nightmares were returning, but then it seemed so natural for that tree to be burning in the middle of the rain. It had died in the fires and still carried the char on its bark, but it still stood. In her dreams, Emily eventually sought shelter from the rain in its burning embrace, finding a greater peace there than she had known even on her boulder.

The longer the rains wore on and the more she dreamed of that burning tree in the rain, the more she loved to embrace it. When she discussed it with her therapist, various theories had been tossed around, but none of them had rung true. She felt in her heart that it wasn't her subconscious trying to come to terms with her fear of fire, it wasn't triggered by the neighbors burning wood, or any other theory. It was the spirit of the tree. She couldn't go to it, so it was coming to her and showing her the beauty of the fire. When she stopped and remembered the day of her flight calmly, without emotion, she could see the beauty in the orange-brown hue of the sky, the vibrancy of the carmine color of the sun, even the intriguing way that the warm brown smoke had occluded the usual sights in the distance as she was driving and made the trip through town new and different in a way the winter fogs never managed to with their insipid white. Even her memory of the fogginess of her mind changed. It was no longer poison in the air trying to slow her so the fire could devour her, it was the energy of the fire trying to calm her fears before it could bring her soul into a perfect union. That must be why she resented those with wood fires so much, after all. Their fires were pathetically pale and insipid things, not the great roaring flame that lit her world that night, a shining new dawn in the sky. The fire had been a new sun, trying to rise to light a new way for all.

Eventually, her world dried and she was, once again, able to make her way to the boulder and find her peace. She was content as she waited as the world awoke, bloomed, and grew, watching the beautiful plants find their ways through their lives. Long days and quiet evenings were spent on that boulder, as she breathed with the world and listened to the spirit in the tree speak to her soul. Emily understood now what had brought her here and why she had felt such peace. When the summer came and the grasses dried, she breathed and waited and then, one evening, she knew the time was right. She thought about going back to town and getting supplies, but that didn't seem right to her. Beauty was born in nature, after all, not from a machine or chemical process. And that beauty was what had saved her from her fears, as it would save others.

With utter and complete peace, Emily ranged over the paths of the park near the tree, both familiar and new, gathering what she needed. As the sun was starting to set, she lit the piles of dried grass and twigs she had placed around the burned tree in the middle of the meadow. As the piles caught and the fires started to spread over the meadow and to the rest of the trees, prepared with their own piles of twigs and grasses, Emily was at peace. Once the tree had caught and was starting to burn like in her dream she, as she had many times, slid off of the boulder and ran to its waiting arms. Like her dreams, her sense of calm and of being in the right place grew. It grew as the fire licked her clothes and hair, and even as her skin started to char. But reality is no dream and her haven was a baited trap.",1,1760820035.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

The specific question is: does Spain have some kind of thing where its AirBnBs are trash compared to other big travel countries on the continent like France and Italy?

This isn’t about hosts being rude or cleaning fees. It’s about a weird lack of amenities for just trying to exist. No cooking oil, no salt or pepper, plumbing that doesn’t work, coffee machines but no coffee, no sheets, no soap, and still earning very good reviews. What??

I have some theories but I’d like to know what the community thinks.

    Even if all you’re doing
    Is simply brewing a coffee
    And staring silently out of the window.
     
    Because staring out of the window
    Is better than staring at your phone.
    Staring into the oncoming doom.
     
    For as certain as that doom may be,
    It hasn’t reached you yet.
     
    Once the coffee’s brewed,
    Don’t take it to your desk.
    Allow yourself 5 minutes to enjoy it.
    Hold the mug to your face
    And let the steam soften your skin.
    Breathe deeply.
    Focusing not on your breath
    As the yogi said,
    But those familiar, comforting scents.
    As the orange leaves tumble outside
    The air catching breath,
    Relish the warmth flowing into your hands
    Sending soft waves towards your shoulders
    Then cascading down your back.
     
    With each sip
    Stare into its earthy abyss,
    Then close your eyes
    And taste an orchestra playing upon your tongue.

For water i used room temp distilled water combined with TWW. Both times the coffee tasted really astringent or bitter and was only drinkable with added milk.

There have been times where I might’ve only wanted maybe an item or two. 

For example, just today, I wanted to try the new seasonal pumpkin ice cream. I wanted to try a single scop, nothing too big. So, I placed an order at the local ice cream place through door dash. wouldn’t have wanted to make the door dash driver drive all out for a scoop of ice cream or just one item. I felt bad, and added like a layered sundae situation plus a medium coffee ice cream drink. 

I couldn’t bring the ice cream home, it would melt by then. I also wouldn’t want to waste food, but it’s too much ice cream. I could only eat so much. I already feel guilty for having spend money on this. Consuming this much ice cream feels gross. I could’ve just ordered a scoop but I couldn’t do that to the door dash driver. I still tipped them for their service. But have you guys had any experience with this? Midwest 23f",5,1760819915.0,TooAfraidToAsk,5,0.86,False

It deals with a lot of real world issues among partners.  May have triggering themes throughout.  But other than that, enjoy the dread! 

PART 1: HER

My wife and I share the long and sometimes defeating effort of laying the kids down for bed at the end of the night. If all goes as planned, she and I can steal away and enjoy an hour of uninterrupted time together. Unfortunately, that isn’t always the case if one or both of us succumbs to the comfort of a warm bed. I wonder if she feels the same as I do when we’re completely alone. I mean, I wonder if there’s ever a flicker of shyness or nervousness that passes through her—the kind that comes on a first or second date. She probably doesn’t feel that way; it’s always been me who’s more in tune with the emotional side of things. I’ll admit, months and years of operating more like co‑workers around our children have left me clinging to small, momentary feelings like this whenever I get her all to myself. I grow increasingly excited about the idea of her—almost like falling in love again.
They say you fall in love three times in your life, and I think I’m in the middle of the second. She starts to talk about her day, about opinionated things involving her workplace. I try to be a good listener, but her words fade as I lose myself in those beautiful brown eyes—the same eyes our children have. She doesn’t notice, but I nod to show I’m listening, even as my gaze drifts to her lips: perfect and beautiful. Lips I’d love nothing more than to kiss as she babbles on, but I resist the urge and let her continue. Then I notice a long strand of hair begging to be brushed behind her ear—any excuse to touch her soft cheek. And I wonder if she ever looks at me the same way. I don’t think she does.
“Why?” someone might ask. “Why are you so moved by someone who doesn’t share the sentiment?” I have to think about those questions once in a while. The truth is, I’m still as in love with her as the moment I slipped a ring on her finger. And I have to believe she’s genuine when she says, “I love you.” But I’d be lying if I said I never wondered whether I’m naïve in my love. I’ve come to realize I’m a people‑pleaser—a trait I inherited from my mother. When I care about someone, I have no problem showering them with acts of service and gifts. Physical touch, of course, ranks high on that list. And because of this, I could never expect someone to meet these traits with their own.
As I’ve grown to understand the ever‑changing person my wife has become, I’ve learned that her love language is quiet—subtle, if it’s there at all. I remind myself that looking at her family offers a glimpse into who she is. They yell. They bicker. They don’t leave much room for moral questioning. They’re straightforward, sometimes apathetic, and they have little patience for emotional dissections. That doesn’t make them bad people. It doesn’t make her a bad person either—just someone who’ll make you work for the pathway to her heart.
And maybe that’s why I don’t always feel the same kind of love reflected back: because, without interference, those traits were never encoded in her DNA. Still, I hold on to this idea of a woman who might one day miraculously emerge from her own skin—someone who would see me in the same light I see her, and we’d grow old together, cherishing every moment of our love. But then, like a baby monitor crackling to life, I’m reminded that this is the real world—and our attention is needed elsewhere.
SCREAMING. CRYING. CLAWING. BITING. HITTING. FALLING. CRYING. CRYING. CRYING.
Sometimes you wonder how children produce so many tears without passing out. Some nights begin to blur together.
I used to say, “Mothers don’t have the hardest job in the world. Go work on an oil rig and tell me that’s not harder.” Most men probably share that opinion—but I’d bet they weren’t splitting the load fifty‑fifty. Or sometimes, a hundred to zero. When you watch your wife carry, birth, and care for a new life, you begin to see what’s behind the curtain.
That curtain was hung long ago and painted with soft pastels that said something like, “You’re about to embark on the most beautiful journey! You’ll witness the miracle of becoming a mother and cherish every moment.”
I don’t mean this cruelly, but it almost feels like a sick joke.
Moaning. Grunting. Screaming. Whispering. Crying. Crying. Crying.
A mother’s body is like the earth after a storm—split, reshaped, torn. What was once untouched now carries the memory of creation. When the tides recede, the shore is never quite the same. But when you walk it again, the sun rises over the horizon, and there’s beauty there.
I don’t want to tell you a mother’s story for her. I can only better understand my own story through hers.
On one of those quiet, uninterrupted nights, I scheduled a talk with her. This wasn’t one of our usual hour‑long conversations, half spent sharing videos on our phones. Instead, it unfolded into a three‑hour discussion. I sat across the room, giving us space to bridge the distance between us as we worked toward a shared understanding.
It began softly, with tears. Then it deepened—sobbing, questioning, searching. And it ended with us side by side, making new promises. That night brought many things into focus and answered questions.
First, she ruled out the idea that anything lacking between us was my fault. Second, she admitted that she feels like there isn’t a sexual bone in her body, even though she’s still attracted to me. We assume it’s hormonal—after the children. Third, she confessed that she hasn’t felt like herself in a long time. She catches glimpses of who she was, but never fully. Her inability—or unwillingness—to examine those feelings has left her struggling to describe them at all.
I remind myself of where she comes from—the language of her family. And words, even at their best, are a limited form of communication. I hold that in mind as I try to understand her.
She’s been broken. She’s lost her youthfulness. She’s lost her body. She’s lost the time and space to remember who she is. My heart aches for her—but it also races to fix her. I have to stop myself, remind myself that not everything can be fixed. Maybe the best help I can offer isn’t showing her the way forward, but walking by her side through it.
She’s always been my best friend—an incredible mother and strong wife. The only person I ever wanted to walk through this life with.
Everything I’m journaling here is elevated stylistically. This is not to assume things are untrue or aren’t as meaningful, because they are. I find myself writing in ways no real person would ever talk, but more so in the language of an author—or maybe my mind.
Instead of pouring my heart out to a professional psychologist, I find so much emotional healing from just putting pen to paper. Someone might think, “What a bitch. This dude has to write his feelings to get over it!” Actually, that’s more like my subconscious speaking. It’s true that I’m an emotional person, but more so, I’m an artist first. The world that I see is through a lens that makes sense to me. This makes sense when reality is complicated and messy. This is structured, thought out. There’s no walking away and regretting saying something more; it’s already here, at my own pace.
Now, I could have written a novel when it comes to what it means to be a father—what my children mean to me—but I think I have a clear focus for this writing. Fatherhood is for another time and consciousness. It deserves that.
I’m eager to get home most days—not to relax, but to see them. To see her. If I’m being completely honest with myself, there are points in my life where my day‑to‑day emotions were totally reliant on my wife. This is probably very normal, on both sides. In a way, I viewed this as a type of codependency that was disguised as supportiveness.
I want to help you. Make you happy. Convince myself that I feel seen. Because if I don’t, then my emotional compass will forever spin. She is my direction.
No. This is not healthy.
I have been rewiring my mind and unearthing answers I’d previously thought were held by someone else. They were always with me. I just wasn’t listening. There are very loud voices, but in the back—way in the back, behind layers—there are soft ones. I’d encourage anyone to practice finding them.
The root of a tree is not always seen, but it’s vital for keeping the tree alive. Its branches stretch and leaves blossom in every direction. How beautiful this tree has become. But what of the root? He’s hidden deep below, calculating his reach, twisting his foundation, and growing stronger. Nobody sees the root, but they’re not supposed to. The leaves are beautiful.
I don’t need your kind words. I don’t need your affirmation. I just need to see it in your eyes once in a while—something that says, “I’m with you. I love you.”
She has weathered the storms on the surface, and I’ve felt them below.


PART 2: ME

We step back into the bedroom. A whirlwind of crying hits us. We take our stations beside each baby, stroking soft hair, whispering reminders that we’re still here. The noise fades. The room exhales. Only the hum of the oscillating fan remains.
Through the blackness, a faint reflection glimmers in her eyes—they’re still open. I smile, reach out, find her hand. But she isn’t looking at me. Her gaze drifts somewhere behind me, somewhere far away. If only I could hear her thoughts. If only she would share them.
Then that voice—the one I thought I’d buried—crawls out of the ashes.
What if she’s fantasizing about someone else?
Shut up.
What if she longs for a real man? One who excites her with adventure instead of tormenting her with your twisted perceptions.
SHUT UP.
And then comes that feeling—like stepping from sunlight into a cold, dark space. I dread it because I know it too well. I’ve lived here before. My hand finds hers again. I rub her lifeless fingers—no response. Her eyes still wander, anywhere but mine.
I sink a little further.
The alarm tears through my dreams. 3:41 A.M. Like clockwork, I’m gathering my things in the dark. The world sleeps while I begin my day. The road glows ahead in my headlights. For a moment, it feels quiet enough to forget. Almost.
Today is a new day. I can be anyone when I walk back through that door tonight. I can be the reminder of fun, of youth, of being needed. Or maybe I could just be me—that’s what started all this, wasn’t it? But she’ll still be the same. Cold.
“Man, why don’t you just leave her? You’re never happy.” My coworker leans back in his chair—the unwilling therapist of my lunch breaks.
“It’ll be fine,” I tell him. “She’s an amazing mother, honestly.” He smirks like he’s heard this a hundred times.
“Yeah, but there’s a difference between being a good mother and being a good wife. You’ve got to communicate your needs as a man.”
But I have, haven’t I? Have I not been clear enough? Or do I just know she won’t do anything with it? Probably both. These talks aren’t helpful. He just becomes another voice in my head—negative thoughts dressed as wisdom. Sure, in most marriages, communication is vital. But she doesn’t need anything. She doesn’t seem to want anything.
Life was simple once. Before kids. Before bills. Before alarms at 3:41 A.M. We were eager back then—chasing love like it might run away. She loved her body. She was confident. She had opinions, dreams, purpose. We talked for hours about the life we have now. And we built it.
So what happens when you get everything you ever wanted by age thirty? You have fun, right? You make new memories. You chase smaller dreams that keep you moving—a walk‑in shower, a new kitchen, a family car, a trip together. Then something shifts.
How about stop touching your husband…
Or sit on your phone all night, scrolling past him.
Or stop talking about your feelings altogether.
And now the anger rises. The sadness follows. How did I end up back here again? Our long talks—the writing, the promises—did any of it help? Or am I just orbiting the same questions, over and over? My thoughts accelerate. My palms turn clammy. My breathing breaks rhythm.
“You good, dude?”
My coworker is still watching as I stand abruptly, slam the door behind me, and rush to an empty break room. Another panic attack. First one in a month.
Look at yourself. You let her do this to you—without her even trying. You think you deserve this? You think you’ve earned pain like this? There are soldiers who’ve seen children die, parents who’ve buried their own. And you? What have you suffered?
Get away from me. You were gone. I got rid of you.
You convinced yourself of a lot of things. That you’re not needed. That you can handle it alone. That being unseen makes you noble. You let a woman crawl into your mind and bring you to your knees. You think your “good deeds” make you strong? You think they’ll save you from yourself?
I never needed you. You’re the Devil.
Please! What use would the Devil have for someone as small and as insignificant—with all your “problems”?
I think he would have all the use in the world for them. For my soul. For every man’s soul. All at the same time.
You’ve truly fallen into delusion then. Blame the Devil for something you can’t take control of.
I can see the house peek over the hill as I approach, her car parked in its usual spot.
A home that should be teeming with light and life instead looks cold and hollow.
Pulling in, I kill the engine and sit for a moment. The plan I’d had earlier—to shower her with hugs and smiles—died sometime this afternoon. In its place, something colder formed. I decided I wouldn’t lay a finger on her tonight. I’d only respond if spoken to, and even then, only neutrally. I want to see if she’ll break first.
I know I’m playing games with my wife now, even if it’s one‑sided. But I tell myself it’s a test—of our love, our compatibility. How long could I keep it up? Days? Weeks? Months?
Still, there’s a small, cruel hope in me: that she’ll come to my side, rub my shoulder, and bridge the distance I’ve built.
When I finally open the door, the house greets me with the sound of a children’s show—bright voices echoing through a dim, airless room. No one in sight. I set my things down and take in the scene. Disaster.
Stale food on the floor. Toys everywhere. Dishes stacked and buzzing with flies. I never asked for perfection. Never expected dinner waiting on the table. But I thought at least common sense might fill in the gaps. What has she been doing all day?
The answer finds me before I finish the thought.
She’s in the bedroom, the only light coming from her phone screen. The kids sleep beside her. She looks up at me, squinting through the dark.
“Hey,” she says.
“Hi,” I leave her with my reply and continue to the bathroom.
Closing the door behind me, I sit on the toilet seat and just wait. What am I waiting for? She’s not going to ask me about my day. I was just the one‑second break in her infinite scrolling. God, I want to snatch that fucking phone right out of her hands and whip it toward a wall. I want it in pieces. I want her to be faced with what’s happening around her.
“Hunny?” Just then, her voice—from the other side of the door.
This is a pivotal moment in my mind. I like to think the next words out of her mouth could change my entire outlook.
I respond, “Yeah?”
“You gonna be long? ’Cause I gotta take a shower.”
THIS WAS IT. THIS WAS THE STRAW THAT BROKE THE CAMEL’S BACK. I AM AN OBSTACLE FOR HER TO MOVE AROUND. I AM THE EXTRA PAIR OF ARMS TO TAKE THE KIDS WHEN SHE NEEDS TO SCROLL. I AM THE MONEY‑MAKER, THE PERSONAL ACCOUNTANT, THE MAID!
SHE’S GONE. MY WIFE DOES NOT EXIST. IN HER PLACE IS NOW THIS THING, WALKING AROUND MY HOUSE DEAD. DEAD LIKE A GIRL’S BODY THAT WASHED UP ON SHORE. SHE HAS NO LEAVES. SHE CREAKS AND GROANS AND SNAPS WITH THE WIND. HER FOUNDATION IS DYING!
“Be out in a sec,” I respond softly.


PART 3: US

Three days. We have not touched each other in three days. We exchange information on a need‑to‑know basis. I listen to a few snarky comments about her work. I received a “good night” the first day, but not these last two. We are just floating around each other, completing daily tasks for the children. If it wasn’t for the kids, we might be considered complete robots in this house.
Of course this is all devastating. I really believed I’d break by the first night after seeing a glimpse of hope in her—something to make me throw it all out and get back to living. I did not anticipate three days and counting.
I cannot think at work. My mind is somewhere else. I’m afraid I’m beginning to look like her from the outside. Whatever disease she has is affecting me. A dying disease. The children most definitely feel this, even though they can’t say it.
I can see the confusion in their eyes. I feel their distress and frustrations. They’ve been especially hard these last few days.
I’m just tired. I’ve been fighting an emotional battle for too long. I believe my body is telling me that it must come to an end.
Is this justifiable enough? If I slid her a paper that said “Petition for Divorce” across it, how would she react? Maybe she would hide a moment of relief behind aggravation. What a waste. A waste of life and time. But what about the kids? Am I dooming them to a reality that’s now split? What kind of mental turmoil would they accumulate under the surface, I wonder—things they would only later in life be able to diagnose.
“Oh, I must have felt this way because I watched my parents go through a divorce when I was young.”
“I never felt the effective operation of a real family dynamic because my dad split with my mom.”
“Mom’s new boyfriend beats her up ’cause she stopped having sex with him.”
I can hear it all now. But this isn’t my fault. I would have never built a future around someone if I could have foreseen this. That’s not to say I regret my children. They’re the only thing that keeps me going.
I stand in the kitchen with a cup of coffee pressed to my nose, waiting for it to cool.
From the corner of my eye, I see her stumble out of the bedroom and make a beeline for the couch. That cushion must be molded to her by now. I feel the glare forming before I can stop it—so I smooth my face.
“Where’s the remote?” she asks through a yawn.
I wait a beat. “Good morning.”
She digs into the couch, pulling out toy cars, broken graham crackers, a sock.
“Hunny, did you lose the remote?” she says, not hearing me at all.
“Good morning,” I repeat, a little sharper this time.
“Seriously, now I can’t turn shows on for the kids. God damn it.” Her hands slap her lap—that sound of defeat.
“GOOD MORNING!” I yell, the words ripping out of me before I can stop them. The whole house jolts awake. She jumps, eyes wide, confusion freezing her face.
“What the fuck?” she stammers.
Through the monitor, the baby starts crying. Of course.
“Why did you do that? You fucking woke him up.” She stands, disgust curling her lip as she moves past me toward the bedroom. “The fuck is wrong with you?”
I blow across the top of my coffee, steadying myself for the storm I just invited.
SCREAMING. CRYING. YANKING. SPILLING. THROWING.
The house is chaos today. I sit with my feet up on the ottoman. Comfy. My second cup of coffee is now room temp. She darts back and forth, addressing one disaster after another. She’s covered in damp drool and tears. Maybe a bit of applesauce too. Or puke. I don’t know.
She looks toward me with that disgusted look again.
“Are you gonna do anything?” she yells over the sounds of a possessed two‑year‑old. He thrashes on the floor, inconsolable. In the background, the youngest cries to be freed from the constraints of his high chair.
“I can’t hear you. There are too many kids screaming,” I say calmly. Without responding, she scoffs and grits her teeth. She blocks me out with a face that says, “I’ll deal with that comment later.”
She yells at the two‑year‑old to get up on his feet. I can see her hairline drenched in sweat. Now, in this instance, I would never let things get this out of control normally. I’d be rushing to her side, distracting the youngest with freedom, and flying away with the possessed two‑year‑old—somewhere we could contain the sounds.
But if I’m being honest, I kind of liked this. The more they cried, the more frustrated she got, the better I felt.
Normal parts of my subconscious would tell me I’m being an asshole. But it’s quiet—as if my body and mind have found the best path forward. A collected agreement to salvage our mind and our soul. I’ve been fighting too long. I’ve given up what felt like everything that made me me.
“I can’t drive a manual. Get rid of that dumb car. It’s not a family car anyway.”
“These hunting trips are really not helpful when I’m stuck with the kids.”
“I don’t want your friends coming here. They’re too loud, and they’ll wake the kids up.”
I think eventually it’ll whittle down, and I’ll be the only thing left to remove.
It’s frightening how fast the mind can evolve—how fast conclusions can form. Just a week ago, I was fantasizing about her—some invisible love I thought was between us. But I was naïve.
How many times would I go back and forth between two realities? Which one is true? Maybe neither of them are. Maybe it’s something in between.
No. I’m on the right path. I’m sticking to my guns. Just stop thinking so much.
After enduring a napless day, the kids quickly fell asleep. If this were any other night, it would be a great opportunity to hang out—kids are out early, gaining an extra hour of time. Shame. From the passing looks on her face, I could tell she was exhausted. She would probably go to sleep herself soon.
She catches me in the bathroom, brushing my teeth. I don’t look up, but I feel her eyes on me.
“What’s going on?” she asks, exasperated.
Mouth still full of toothpaste, I answer flatly, “What’s up?”
She stares, brow raised, scowling.
“You’ve been acting weird. You didn’t really help with the kids at all today either, so that’s awesome.”
I keep my eyes on the mirror and spit.
“Yeah? Well, I’m sorry. I feel fine.”
She exhales hard, shaking her head as her shoulders drop.
“Whatever. Goodnight.” She starts down the dark hallway.
“That’s it?” I call out before she’s gone.
She stops, sighs. “What do you mean?”
I turn to face her. “You don’t have anything else to say?”
She opens her hands and lets them slap her thighs. “Nope. You obviously want to fight about something.”
“Oh, I do? Or maybe I just want to hear what my wife’s thinking.”
“Hah.” She shakes her head, eyes closed. “What do you want me to say?”
I lean against the doorframe, closing the space between us. “I want you to express something. I want you to show me that you feel anything—even a little bit—about us.”
She snaps back, “I feel fine. The kids are a lot, and it’d be nice to have some help, hunny. I’m tired.”
“You’re tired? I’ve been tired for a year!” My voice rises.
She covers her face. “Oh my God. Please.”
I stand upright now, jaw set. “See? You don’t care. I’ve been shouting it from the rooftops—I’m not okay! This relationship isn’t okay. You’re just someone I live with.”
She lowers her hands and stares through me. “Okay. Then divorce me. I don’t know what you want from me.”
“Okay,” I say quietly.
She doesn’t react—she’s already left the conversation in her head.
“Yeah. Awesome.” She turns away.
Her footsteps fade down the hall. I stand in the doorway, toothbrush still in hand.
I get a sense she doesn’t realize that I’m honest in my response. Doesn’t matter. That was all I needed to hear. My mind was teetering before, but now it’s clear. The fight isn’t what hurts anymore; it’s knowing that I’ve stopped wanting to fix it. I want to divorce my wife.

PART 4: THE END OF THE WORLD
     
“Petition for Dissolution of Marriage.”
The freshly printed document sits on my desk. Blank.
My hand holds a pen.
Click. Click. Click.
I can’t believe this is the culmination. Signing it would make everything real. For now, it’s just paper—harmless in its stillness.
I picture her reaction. Relief, probably. Maybe she’s been waiting for me to make the first move so she can say, “He’s the one who wanted to end it. I was happy. He was delusional.”
A sigh escapes—half dread, half release. I don’t give my thoughts time to negotiate with my heart. I press the pen down and begin to write.
As usual, I rise over the hill and see the house.
Empty.
Her car’s gone. Unusual for a Monday at four. She always leaves work, picks up the kids, and comes straight home. They’re too much for her to manage anywhere else.
Maybe she’s grocery shopping. Maybe she’s with someone else.
I don’t care.
I pull into the drive and pinch the folded paper between my fingers like it’s something fragile.
The sidewalk is lined with forgotten toys—sun‑bleached, dirt‑caked, wrecked by rain. I was always too lazy to put them away. Maybe I hoped they’d be used again someday.
We used to play outside together.
We used to take pictures, view them later after the kids fell asleep, and laugh.
Time stood still back then.
Now, the toys are relics of something that withered—something that never had the nurture to grow.
I kneel down and run my hand across a pair of rusted training wheels. I spin them and watch the rim turn until it slows to a stop.
Tears erupt.
I TRIED. GOD KNOWS I TRIED, AND I CAN DIE IN CONTENT KNOWING I DID EVERYTHING RIGHT—KNOWING THAT I DIDN’T THROW A SECOND MORE OF MY LIFE AWAY.
Oh God. Please help me get through this one.
It’s been two hours. I’ve held the same position at the head of the dining room table for two hours. The paper is in front of me. I can hear the hands of a wall clock tick. Every second I exhale, it’s like sick air leaving my lungs.
I’ve been waiting for that sound—the click of a door handle. Now that my mind accepts that this is over, it floods with the image of adultery. I see her laughing, her hands running across the chest of another man—a man more masculine than me. I see them making love. She cries out like she’s been holding it in all along. I can feel my grip tighten in my sweaty palms.
I shouldn’t care, really. As far as I’m concerned, she can go on and fuck up someone else’s life all she wants the second she signs this. I feel bad for the poor bastard who pours his heart out to her—a guy who doesn’t know she’ll go cold the second she’s done with him.
I’m reminded of her mother—a woman who’s been through two failed marriages and is currently on her third. Was this seed planted long ago? Was my wife predestined to fall out of love? There’s a fine line between influence and inheritance. I don’t think I’m comfortable with either answer.
Click.
I hear the door open. I pull my hands from under my chin and sit upright. My heart begins to beat a little faster now.
I hear the kids stumble into the house. I hear the crinkling of plastic bags. Then, her voice. Out of breath.
“Okay, go find Daddy.”
The kids run past the dining room; they don’t notice me. I hear her footsteps follow.
The heart rate increases a bit more.
Finally, she comes into view. She’s holding grocery sacks and has a diaper bag hanging off one shoulder. Her hair is tangled and messy. She breathes heavily. She stops and examines me for a moment.
“What’re you doing?”
I don’t respond. Instead, my eye gestures to the paper.
She speaks like she’s got other things to attend to. “Hunny, what? What is that?”
I lean forward and rest my elbows on the table.
“We need to talk,” I say softly.
She looks at the paper, then back at me. Then back at the paper. She slowly stumbles across the room, her bags dragging. She leans over the table and squints.
Her head shoots back up toward me. Her expression is horrified.
“What? Hunny, what the fuck is this?”
I blink slowly and inhale before spilling the news.
“We need to start this process. It’ll be harder if we sit on—”
I’m cut off by her eruption of tears and shock.
“No! What are you doing right now? Are you fucking kidding me?”
She lets all her bags drop out of her arms as her hands cup her mouth. Her eyes are piercing and welling up. I resist the urge, but I can feel the lump in my throat growing. My eyes fill with pressure. The sight of her like this has always broken me—even now.
“PLEASE. DO NOT ACT LIKE THIS RIGH—”
I’m cut off again.
“SO I MADE ONE SARCASTIC COMMENT OUT OF ANGER AND YOU SERIOUSLY GO AND DO THIS? YOU WANT TO DIVORCE ME?” She’s unraveling.
I can feel my tears forming, but I stop them in their tracks.
“This cannot be happening right now. Oh my God, I feel sick. Please. Please, please tell me this isn’t real.” She pleads. She begins to back away.
I don’t know what to feel in this moment. I didn’t expect this reaction from her—as if she’s blindsided by this. How could that be possible? It’s been so obvious for so long!
“Stop pretending like you love me! You haven’t for a long time!” I yell with my eyes closed.
She lowers her hands as a newfound shock crawls across her face.
“You think I don’t love you?”
I say the obvious, “I’m your husband. I know you better than anyone in the world. I can see that I’m just someone that’s in your life—not a part of it.”
“DAVID!” she yells. “I LOVE YOU! I’VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU!”
I shake my head and let it hang.
“Please don’t say that. YOU’RE LYING TO YOURSELF!”
“You’re the only person I ever wanted to spend my life with,” she adds.
“Stop. Right now.” My voice is buried in my chest.
She begins to step closer, trying to make her words clearer.
“You’ve seen me at my absolute worst. Lately it’s been hard. Yes. Okay? My body doesn’t feel like mine, and I’ve gone through this before, and we talked about it then, and we talked about it with this last pregnancy too!”
Her voice pleads harder now. “I was waiting. And I thought you were waiting too—waiting for this to pass so we could get back to being us. Also—” she begins to dig in her pocket. She pulls out a single packaged tampon and throws it on the table.
“—I’M ON MY PERIOD! I GET CRANKY. DOESN’T MEAN I DON’T LOVE YOU, DAVID!” she yells in anger now.
“Sign the paper, Mel.” I can’t take her words anymore. Every stab of confession feels like it’s tearing my mind apart.
She’s frozen, just staring at me—trying to really figure it out for herself. Or maybe she’s just mustering up some emotional excuse to keep me holding out a little longer.
I see the kids wander up to the edge of the room. They keep their distance, watching as if they know.
When she speaks now, it’s quiet and pointed.
“Hunny, I think you have some serious issues you need to work out. You’ve built up some—” her tears break her words, “some kind of delusion, I think. I love you, but if you can honestly sit there and believe this, without a shadow of a doubt, then I don’t know what else to say.”
She squats down in a catcher’s position and lets her head fall into her hands. Her dangling hair covers her face.
I hear her whisper to the floor, “I always loved you…”
I sit on her words for a moment.
“You know this is all for show, right? You know she’s afraid that if you leave, it’d be a huge inconvenience for her. Who’s gonna help with the kids and pay the water bill this month?”
I don’t need you for this.
“Are you joking? This is your test! If you break now, right here, then you are doomed to be a prisoner for the rest of your life—a prisoner to his own mind who’s too afraid. You need me in this moment more than you’ve ever needed me.”
My mind darts. Now all the voices come back at once. My heart racing faster now.
“SHE’S STILL LYING!”
“YOU’RE FOLDING. YOU’RE A BOY!”
“SHE FANTASIZES ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE!”
“TOUCHING YOU DISGUSTS HER!”
“SHE HATES EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU!”
A warm hand on the side of my face.
It all stops.
The voices fade. The air goes still.
I open my eyes, and I see hers—deep, beautiful brown eyes. She’s searching for something in mine—as if she’s telling me to fight.
All the sounds fade away now. There’s nothing. Nothing but us.
Silence breaks when her lips form.
“I love you.” She breathes the words.
I feel her breath hit me. So close. Her fingers brush away a tear drying on the corner of my eye. Her tears, still falling.
My heart slows down. Way, way down.
Thump, thump… thump… thump.
The storm passed, and I looked down into the black mud. There’s something green trying to grow from under my foot.

And for some reason, that conversation completely broke me.

It’s been over a year since I’ve been hugged. Not just a quick pat on the back, but really held.

A little more than a year ago, I used to come home from work to someone waiting for me. We’d fall asleep wrapped around each other, and in those quiet moments, I genuinely believed I had found my forever.

For five years, I (34M) lived with someone I loved deeply (36F). We built a life together, shared laughter, plans, morning coffees, the kind of small rituals that make ordinary days feel sacred. I thought if I worked hard, stayed kind, and loved her and supported with everything I had, that would be enough and more.

But slowly, the warmth faded. Conversations turned into silence. Affection into habit. I kept trying, I showed up, listened, stayed gentle but one day I realized love had quietly packed its bags and she did it without any sense of acknowledgment of our history or love. 

It was horrible how we finally parted ways, there wasn’t even anger. Just a feeling of lost was in means confusion… and a deep, aching emptiness. Although she looked quite sure of herself and arrogant throughout the process. 

I used to think being a “good man” meant things would work out. But life doesn’t always reward effort the way you hope.

Now, a year later, I’m still here. alone. I’ve learned that heartbreak isn’t just about losing someone, it’s about losing the small, human things too. The warmth of a hand. The sound of someone breathing next to you. The way a hug can remind you that you still belong somewhere. I see my married friends and I feel empty inside. 

I’m not bitter. I understand now that people change, and sometimes love just runs its course. But the quiet of this loneliness… it’s heavy. It humbles you.

I never imagined I’d go this long without being touched. I thought by now I’d have a family, a partner, a life full of shared moments. But instead, I’m learning what it means to start over.

It’s been 365 days since someone last held me. And tonight, that truth hurts more than I expected.

1oa6hie,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalCannabis_NI/comments/1oa6hie/northern_enlightenment_walking_icelands_path_to/,Northern Enlightenment – Walking Iceland’s path to cannabis legalisation,"Iceland isn’t the first country that springs to mind when cannabis crops up in conversation, after all, weed is still illegal in the Nordic Island nation. However, Icelandic folk are a resilient, fiercely independent, and egalitarian people; accustomed to making their own rules and working together to weather tough times. Our resident event correspondent, Dave Barton, ventured to Reykjavik to learn more.

By way of an allegory, let me begin by relating a tale I heard on my recent trip to Iceland.

Several years ago, a board meeting was held to discuss extending the car park outside Reykjavik’s IKEA store. But alongside the usual management and stakeholder presence was an Elf Specialist – there to advocate on behalf of the *huldufólk* community.

To cut a long story short, the upshot was that, despite some misgivings, the store’s car park-dwelling elf agreed to decamp across the street, acknowledging his loneliness and continued contentment to observe flatpack-hauling humans from a discreet distance.

And so it is with cannabis in Iceland also. In this enchanting-yet-remote island nation of some 400,000 people, cannabis remains illegal for both medicinal and recreational use. But it’s there, alright; visible to those who believe in it and have experienced its transformative qualities.

However, as the rest of the world continues to reduce barriers to [cannabis access](https://www.leafie.co.uk/cannabis/will-the-uk-legalise-cannabis/) – through regulation, decriminalisation, and legalisation – Icelanders are taking note. Luckily, they have a local champion in Þórunn Þórs Jónsdóttir, or Tota, as she’s known to all.

A self-styled cannabis and hemp pioneer in her native country, Tota’s ongoing work in advocating for access to cannabis for cancer patients has led to her mobilising grassroots support – domestically via Hampfélagið (the Icelandic Hemp Association), and globally via [Hemp For The Future](https://hemp4future.is/), a conference which brings the international cannabis community to Icelandic shores.

# Smoke on the water

Thanks to Tota and her wider entourage, momentum is gathering for cannabis change, but Iceland is no stranger to prohibition. A ban on all alcohol was set in motion in 1915, and while wine and spirits were legalised within twenty years, beer (yes, beer!!) remained illegal in Iceland until 1989.

For a large part of that time period, however, cannabis was in fact legal; only criminalised in 1969, although the ban wasn’t added to Icelandic legislation until 1974. The reason? It’s increased popularity among youth.

Fast-forward 50+ years, and Icelandic youngsters aren’t exclusively partaking. Everyone is. Or a large portion of the population is. Apparently. A UN study on global cannabis consumption published in 2019 showed that [18.3% of Icelanders regularly partake](https://delphihealthgroup.com/marijuana/marijuana-global-use-statistics/), a stat that put Iceland in the no.1 spot ahead of both the US (16.3%) and Canada (12.7%).

However, there is a plot twist: these figures are widely disputed. According to [Iceland Magazine](https://icelandmag.is/article/do-icelanders-really-smoke-more-cannabis-anyone-else), the country’s regular consumption figures are in fact more like 6.6% – with 18.3% referring to ‘the number of Icelanders who consume cannabis regularly out of the subset of the population who has ever consumed cannabis’ – putting the nation just inside the top 30: just ahead of the UK (6.2%) but below Iceland’s former imperial master, Denmark (6.9%).

# Puffin along

Cannabis’ popularity certainly isn’t in-your-face on the quirky streets of Reykjavik. But nestled among the karaoke bars, bijou coffee spots, hot dog stands, and outdoor clothing vendors, you’ll find the renowned [Reykjavik Headshop](https://rvkheadshop.is/en?srsltid=AfmBOop75IJBTt5JAToMJy59QaOjRSSmlVncI4NSjxCyfARuBKkbClB4). Something of a ‘stoner central’ for the enlightened people of Iceland (and its visitors), this compact outlet just off the main drag is reminiscent of an old time tobacconist store; or a ‘grown up sweet shop’ as co-owner, Odinn, gleefully refers to it.

Odinn, a well-dressed young man, appears less ‘stoner’ and more ‘entrepreneur’. But it’s clear his passion for the plant is unwavering. Asked about the success of his enterprise in this deceptively small city, he points to the renovation happening next door. Tomorrow, he tells us, they’re moving into larger premises and are expecting Reykjavik’s cannabis crowd to drop by for the grand opening.

I ask him about the patient community here in Iceland. In the absence of a medical cannabis pathway, it seems those with cannabis knowledge are being called upon to help those in need. It’s certainly not unusual, Odinn tells us, for ageing Icelanders or those seeking relief from chronic pain and conditions like MS to inquire about the health benefits of cannabis, and to purchase CBD products.

CBD flower is legal and available here – sold over-the-counter at the headshop alongside CBD prerolls, tinctures, and edibles. But much of it’s imported, mostly brought in legally by Icelanders arriving home from abroad, which continues to cause a kerfuffle when customs officials and police get involved. Odinn recalls an occasion when he and his business partner were arrested for declaring their CBD flower to the authorities at Keflavik airport. Although fully aware this would happen, they saw themselves as (bravely) taking a stand in the face of a lack of official awareness.

# The greater good

While law enforcement may be slower to catch on, despite the great and good of the international cannabis industry’s presence at the Hemp For Future, it’s clear that there’s a lot of knowledge here already. A man with a long plaited beard and electric eyes, referring to himself as ‘Ganj-alf’, tells me about his own grow some 5 hours east, in a small town of about 400 people. Here, nobody bothers him, and he can experiment with cultivation uninterrupted, creating CBD and CBN-rich flowers that help with all manner of ailments.

Yup, Iceland’s cannabis kings and queens aren’t just about THC. A broader array of cannabinoids, flavonoids, and terpene profiles all feature in the Icelandic cultivator’s repertoire. But cultivation is just one aspect of the cannabis equation, as the conference program demonstrated. Other topics ranged from understanding the Endocannabinoid System in humans and animals, to running a dispensary, via plant mould management, medical cannabis patient care, and how information can power progress.

The conference’s emcee, Steinunn Olina, was also very open about her own experience with cannabis. A well-known actor, presenter, and former presidential candidate in Iceland, she also has a deep connection to the plant. Her late husband, Stefán Karl Stefánsson, benefitted from cannabis during his cancer treatment. Stefán, who was well-known in Iceland and internationally as an actor for his role as antagonist Robbie Rotten in the renowned kids’ TV series LazyTown, sadly passed away in 2016.

However, as Steinunn explains, while she saw firsthand how beneficial cannabis was for her husband in the later stages of his illness, she herself hadn’t consumed it regularly until about a year ago. But she certainly feels the positive impact on her overall health as a woman – a sentiment that was shared by those attending the Cannabis & Women’s Health Workshop the day before the conference proper.

Cannabis Queen Melanie Wentzel – Source: Melanie Wentzel

Healthcare professional and author of *Cannabis Queens*, Melanie Wentzel, had travelled all the way from Australia to deliver this workshop – alongside award-winning podcaster and long-time cannabis advocate, Sara Payan; and Magnus Thorsson, PhD – a native Icelander and professor at Johnson & Wales University in the US, responsible for creating America’s first cannabis entrepreneurship college program.

Combined, their approach was to connect with the workshop attendees, to share their personal stories and to hear from others – creating a safe space for canna-curious women (and men) to learn more about plant medicine and how it’s being used around the world to make a positive difference to people’s lives; from a medical and therapeutic perspective.

# Lighting the way

Outside the illicit and the CBD markets, the business of cannabis itself has yet to materialise, which it will when Iceland’s government kickstarts regulation. While that may be a little while off – and despite a Ministry of Health official failing to attend the conference, as promised – Tota and her cannabis crew will continue their endeavours.

As respected cannabis business leader, Jamie Pearson, remarked in her conference opening keynote, there’s a difference between what’s legal and what’s ethical. The two don’t have to be mutually exclusive, but in places where they are, the passion and dedication of those championing plant medicine can’t go unnoticed forever.

As a small, youthful nation that’s been independent for just over 80 years, as I see it, Iceland could steal a march on the rest of Europe. There’s access to power here – unlike in larger nations like the US or the UK. Plus, there’s a female-led government right now, so the issues pertaining to women’s health could well be seen as a determining factor, with the right level of attention.

Icelanders are a hardy bunch, with many working different jobs seasonally to support their families. They’re also excellent at collaboration, particularly when a cause takes root. However long it takes for cannabis prohibition to be repealed, you can be sure that when it does, the efforts of those involved won’t be hidden per se; they’ll remain a source of pride in overcoming the combined hurdles of legislation and stigma; matched with a strong commitment to ensuring that what happens next remains both legal and ethical, for the benefit of all who need access.

Elves included, for those who believe.

At any rate, I have been miffed about Brian's massive pay and his commuting via private jet and spewing carbon everywhere. My regular store has almost all new staff so feels completely different. Prices have been steadily rising while stars are losing value. Quibbles.

So I figured out that for the price of my one fancy and delicious Starbucks drink with tip I could buy the following:

For some reason Starbucks coffee bags are really inexpensive right now. I usually buy Peets and I can roast and grind my own beans but the Starbucks ground coffee has been fine.

1oa6gxi,https://i.redd.it/rrcpzspkdxvf1.jpeg,Absolute UnderTale part. 3 (Community work!!!),"**Welcome to Part 3 of the creation of Absolute Undertale (our work does not end)!**

**WRITE YOUR IDEA AND THEORY AND I WILL USE THEM!!!**

In this chapter, I’ll reveal which ideas made it into the project (*I’m sorry if yours didn’t — I really tried my best!*).  
They’re listed in no particular order, so let’s dive right in.

But first, let’s briefly revisit what the **Absolute** theme truly means:  
This AU isn’t one where *hope shines* — here, hope has to **burn** a thousand times stronger just to survive.  
(*Basically, achieving the pacifist route is near impossible.*)

* **Dr. Gaster:** In this universe, **Gaster never vanished** — he’s still alive as the Royal Scientist, studying the Void itself. His machines have made the weather in the Underground far harsher (for instance, Snowdin is trapped in an endless blizzard). The Underground is far larger and more advanced than in the original timeline. Gaster can *feel* SAVE points and resets, but instead of dwelling on them, he buries himself in work to forget **Papyrus** — which is why **Sans despises him**. He’s indifferent toward humans and souls; he believes the future lies in *Void Science*. His signature weapon, the Gaster Blaster, has evolved into the terrifying **Gaster Cannon**.
* **Asgore:** has grown **ruthless** — and, strangely enough, addicted to coffee. He can faintly sense SAVE points and resets but never fully grasps them. Physically, he’s *massive* and *muscular*, radiating a quiet kind of menace.
* **Flowey**... doesn’t exist. *Or so it seems.* Something else has crawled in through the Void — something that doesn’t belong to this AU. No attachment, no mercy, no soul — pure evil. (*I’ll talk more about this in the next post, maybe! >:)* )
* **Toriel** remains married to Asgore and truly acts like a queen now. She still loves human *children* but burns every *adult* she sees — she never forgave humanity for Asriel’s and Chara’s deaths. She’s lost her passion for cooking. Driven by duty and a lingering love for Asgore, she’s taken matters into her own hands to help him rule without distraction. She’s taller now, with imposing horns and a far more intimidating presence.
* **Chara** still lingers as a spirit but now sides with the monsters. When a human fights a monster, she sometimes possesses the monster to deliver the killing blow. She can still sense resets, but can no longer perform one herself.
* **Papyrus**: Now for the tragedy — or maybe not. Papyrus is **dead**... or perhaps not exactly. (*You guys really love Papyrus — me too!*) He was caught in the wrong place at the wrong time and ended up **replacing Gaster** in the Void. Welcome **Void Papyrus**: a darker, more mature, serious version of our beloved skeleton. He’s moodier, less joyful — the living avatar of the Void, with a black jaw and haunting presence. (*Still deciding his outfit — any ideas?*) He won’t appear in the main storyline, but his shadow lingers everywhere.
* **Sans** is more broken than ever after losing his brother (Only he remeber him). He’s weaker than his original counterpart (*0.5 HP, 0.5 DMG — at least at the start 😉*). \[*Some of you dislike Sans-centered AUs, others love them — this version walks the middle path.\]* He made no promise to Toriel this time and has long since stopped caring about humans.
* **Alphys** remains a scientist, but she’s now the **leading expert on souls**. She’s more intelligent, less awkward — a thinker who prefers *philosophy* to anime. (*Tell me which philosopher she should follow!*) She mass-produces **Mettatons** as combat units — less intelligent than the original but linked by a hive mind. She designed the deadly traps seen early in the story. After injecting herself with a fragment of **Bravery**, she managed to survive — but that soul left a mark on her (something is wrong) . Now she’s subtly sadistic and openly obsessed with **Undyne**.
* **Undyne** wasn’t raised by Asgore this time but by **The Hammer of Justice**, who’s still alive — younger, more rational, and the only truly sane one left. Undyne resembles her original self but has learned to transform into **Undying** form at will. She made a secret pact with Toriel to personally deliver every human child to her (*and Toriel kills them*). Her love for Alphys faded once she realized how much Bravery had changed her.
* **Frisk** is older now — around **15 years old**. They’ve learned to *create* SAVE points at the cost of L.O.V.E. Some natural ones still exist, but they’re increasingly rare.
* **Grillby** has vanished without a trace. No one knows where he went — though *someone* (don’t ask who) seems to have taken his place.
* **The Underground** has grown vast and complex. The Ruins now glow orange (XD). Cities resemble modern metropolises with a faint *Cyberpunk 2077* aesthetic — sleek, neon, but still unmistakably Underground.
* Humans: There are **eight kinds of human souls** now. (*What should the eighth be?*) The souls of Kindness and Justice remain alive but live disguised as monsters. They’ve lost their powers and the will to fight — they just *endure*. (*A touch of Determination would do them good, right?*)
* **Monsters** have grown stronger thanks to Gaster’s **Void Machine**, which constantly leaks raw magic. The only joint project between Sans, Gaster, and Alphys is the **Special Kind Monster Soul** — a volatile new soul type born from unstable emotions like Rage, Joy, or Sorrow. They’re incredibly rare and nearly impossible to control.
* **The Judge:** (*You guessed it right!*) The new Judge is **Monster Kid**, now grown up. (*He needs a better name though!*) He was a disciple of Gaster, who gifted him a pair of floating spectral hands. He wears a **scientist’s trench coat** and **glasses inspired by Megalo Alphys** (*I really like that AU!*). He can’t feel resets, but he’s so intelligent that he *figured them out* through pure logic. (*He needs some unique moves and a special ability — suggestions welcome!*)
* **Bravery** was one of the few humans willing to cooperate with monsters. But they were brutally killed by one, dying with a single wish — that all monsters would go extinct.
* **Mettaton** is weaker than the original (*please don’t hate me!*). He’s an old, outdated model considered *too kind* and *too stable*. The new Mettaton series has no soul and is designed purely for combat. The original Mettaton hides in the Ruins now, taking on **Toriel’s old role** — teaching lost humans about the Underground.
* **Jerry** has become a grotesque *abomination ( he is just ugly*  ) — he commands a bizarre cult of followers known as the **Joners**, each one represented by... a rubber duck.

2. Two way tie between Dream Warriors and Dream Master, saw both in theaters when I was 11 and 12 respectively, so they have a special place in my heart. And Dokken! I also love how Freddy mercilessly slaughters everyone, mains are fair game. Some goofy one liners but damn do the flicks still look great. The downside to 3 is Patricia Arquette constantly screaming. Not well acted. 4 had some shockingly decent acting, love the lore and story of both too. 

3. New Nightmare…saw this one in theaters when I graduated from HS. The last I saw. I dug it then but appreciate it more now. The final battle was a bit meh, but Heather did an excellent job 

4. Freddy’s Revenge…Dream Child is right there too, but didn’t want another tie. I didn’t catch onto the gay undertones until much later, last time I saw it was a decade ago, and this time around, oh man…he should’ve just smashed his friend. This the gayest horror film I have seen and I am totally down with it. I did think the main’s acting was the weakest link with the constant screaming, crying and over emoting, but the final girl was solid and I like how Elm often switches up who the final person is sometimes in the middle of the flick. 

5. Dream Child, saw this 3 times or so in the theater. Dollar cinema! And 89 is one of the best years in cinema history…I also didn’t know that this was the last slasher released in the 80s. Solid follow up to 3-4. Dug the Final Girl. Good effects and while not as scary or effective as the others, it’s got good world building and solid kills

6. Freddy v Jason, it took me years to get around to this as I became a slasher snob in the 00s, thinking they were too cheesy, and probably a reason I didn’t watch as many for a good 10-15 years. Got to it around 2010, and was pleasantly surprised. It’s still fun. When my kids have watched with me, they dig the fight between the two. For me what holds it down a bit is the nonsensical story, with Freddy just there 4 years prior and half the town’s kids in a coma or whatever…Also, Jason moves way too slow. Still, it’s enjoyable and mindless and does what it sets out to do…I wanted more Jason kills at the cornfield but too many flash cut edits

7. Nightmare (2010)…didn’t hate it like I did back when I saw it in 15 years ago. It’s different and similar enough to be enjoyable. I also liked Katie Cassidy and was briefly fooled into thinking she was the final girl!

8. Freddy’s Dead, haven’t seen this one since theaters. Didn’t remember much. Not too bad, liked the Twin Peaks vibe, but there’s not much else. It feels incomplete, and while I am a fan of the atmosphere, I just didn’t feel like it was a good send off for Freddy. ",1,1760819380.0,slasherfilms,0,1.0,False

1oa6cml,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1oa6cml/my_advice_on_making_friends_loneliness/,My advice on making friends & loneliness,"I see this topic a lot on this forum, so I thought I would share what I know as an autistic adult who does have friends and a partner.

(Context for the author: 26F, late diagnosed, late bloomer in socialisation, I guess level 2 autism, not sure)

**Bitter Pill**

I must admit that as an autist, I was poorly socialised through my teens and into my 20s. I didn't understand how to express my excitement. I didn't understand how shame functioned for allistic people. I surely had no idea how anyone socialised.

It took a lot of skill building to come over that.  I had to take responsibility and go through a learning period that is much more painful and embarrassing than most allistic people have to.

Being autistic doesn't mean we can't socialise. It means we learn it more slowly and with more practice. Like how some people learn to play instruments faster while others slower. Making friends is a miserable thing to be naturally untalented at but with practice, we can learn too. Kinda... We kinda have to keep learning for life.

I had to practice a lot. Finding safer stims (e.g. changing arm scratching with rubic cubes which allistics consider to be a party trick), investigating the logic behind certain socialisation principles, discussing with autistic and allistic friend groups, literally taking notes on certaine vents. 

I had to ask people repeatedly ""I am sorry. I am autistic, so this is a genuine question: Did I make you uncomfortable and if so, why? I am trying to learn how not to do this"". I often got negative responses, but I also met kind people who took the time to explain me when and how allistic people feel shame, discomfort or jealousy. And those people were often open to me texting them like ""So... I said this in this situation and the person was upset. Uhmm... What did I do wrong?""

You could probably ask those things in this community too. Most autistic people learn these manually so they may be able to give you easier to understand explanations than allistic people.

I learnt certain social comfort limits for the average person, and their expectations from conversations.

Even though I have covered most of the basics, I still have to ask and learn. The most recent thing I learnt was that social norms about standing distance in pools and saunas being different from other places. Normally, it is about arm's length. In pools and saunas, unless it is rather full, it is 2-3 arms length. Noted.

I know its uncomfortable to navigate a world that is so alien, but it gets easier as we build these skills.

**Basics** 

I find that, for autistic people, we are more likely to end up in abusive situations. Without a strong intuition to understand what is acceptable, we end up giving and giving to keep people around. This ends up harming our trust, relationship styles and social willingness.

I am analytical, and I found it helpful to learn a lot about relationship therapy to spot this kind of abuse. I know these are written for romantic relationships, but often all relationships are a balance of the same needs, wants and boundaries. I also recommend asking in forums when you suspect something might be a boundary issue or abuse. People's input isn't always accurat,e but at least it keeps you from being isolated.

It is at this point that I must note this: Good relationships without toxicity are hard to find, even for allistic people. That isn't merely an autism struggle. We just struggle relatively more.

So, don't be surprised if everyone isn't nice, considerate, healthy or fun. Most people aren't.

A good part of being able to find friends and partners is knowing what \*you\* want, and what your boundaries are. It is all about *meeting* a lot and *electing* out a lot. Also, about quickly skipping inconsiderate & rude people. Don't let them emotionally scar you or drain you.

Yes, this is going to be exhausting at first, but you don't need more than one partner and one or two friends. 

**Meeting**

I am unable to socialise without an event, topic or shared goal. I just do not attempt to go to random parties anymore. It doesn't work for me. Instead, I seek out events, volunteering, seminars, and gatherings around themes. I even host them, because then I get to talk about my special interest with a few people who were into it enough to show up. (It's awesome. I love it)

Some places do not have enough population to have the level of diversity to support super niche interests. That is okay. Sometimes we compromise enough to go to events we are kinda into instead of super into. Other times, we try to start things and take charge. It is scary, but sometimes you gotta be the weird lil beacon for your own community to gather around. 

It doesn't matter what your interest is. Whether it be D&D or bodybuilding strategies or knitting... If you are offering to teach or organise, often 3-5 people show up. And any more would be overwhelming anyway. You may have to post on local platforms, hang flyers etc.

About romance, I did meet people on the apps. But part of that was detailing my profile as far as possible. I put my dating goals and special interests to the forefront, like ""Looking for someone who likes xyz dates, potentially leading to a relationship that is xyz"" and ""Together I would like to...""

Leave out the ""Don't text me if..."" bits. The election comes later. For your profile, just try to draw people in based on shared romantic life goals and interests.

**Electing**

This is the part we all fail hard. Just because someone is talking to us, we don't have to date/meet them. I know connections are hard to find, but half-ass connections don't evolve into full-blown friendships or partnerships. 

Likely, there are people out there who feel recharged to be around. People who don't judge, who do put in effort, who will absolutely adore you for who you are. They exist. But you won't meet them if you are stuck entertaining people who you can kinda hangout with if you mask enough.

So, we have to elect. And to elect, we need to know what we are looking for. Try to sit down and detail what you can give to a friend, what you won't give to a friend, what you want & need from a friend, what you would like to share/do with a friend etc. Same for romantic relationships.

For example, do you want to share your hobby time with a friend or is that for you a sacred time? If its sacred, maybe don't meet around hobbies. You may want emotional support from a friend, but can you offer it? If not, what can you offer? Do you need a friend who is okay with you going unreachable for a week? Do you want to be able to call them during a shutdown? 

My friend as an example: She disappears for over a month sometimes. I do for a week or two sometimes myself. That is okay for us. I know and love her. She was there for me at 2 am while I was in crisis and I know if I call her repeatedly now, she will pick up, hop on the bus and come over. So would I, for her. But she does forget to respond to ""hey free this friday?"" Whatevs. She is kind, sweet, and shares some hobbies with me. Though we don't hang around our hobbies. I find it disruptive and agitating to have people around me as I engage in my special interests. We share books. We talk over tea about our projects. We aren't perfect, neither of us, but we are good to each other.

Often, we need to take the first step. I did end up being the one to offer coming over to help with clean up or food to superficial friends when they are sick. It usually takes a little bit of trust and leap to deepen otherwise fleeting relationships. 

This is where caution about abuse comes in tho, make sure that people don't get in the habit of asking you for things that requires you to make sacrifices. If you are in doubt, try to imagine what you would advice \*someone else\* regarding boundaries. Write it down like it is a post in Am I the Asshole subreddit, reread it, dissect it. We often give much more sober advice to others than ourselves.

About electing romantic partners on the apps: It is so easy to end up dating someone because ""why not"". Please don't. It is better to be alone than in a dependent and depleting relationship out of fear of being lonely. 

I have a good partner. He wasn't easy to find. I am looking at my relationship now, and the past relationships I put up with, and realising that I was better off alone, working on myself and being available for the right person than carrying burdens of bad partners. 

I found him on the apps after attempting like 200+ times. He had clearly read my profile. I often ask questions like ""What are you seeking from dating?"", ""what would you say are your green/beige/red flags?"" during the texting phase to eliminate people who aren't self-reflective, and those who are uncomfortable with openly discussing things. This works for me. Out of 200+ people, I met about 10-15 in person. This btw, doesn't need to be your elective criteria. But do decide, just like how you did for friends, what a good partner looks like to you. Then try to come up with questions that can eliminate most people who aren't that. Aim for specific people who fit who you are.

He answered my questions openly and directly. I saw we aligned on our answers. We were able to text without it getting awkward, tiring or dull. I find it important that someone is exciting, at least on a text level. I am yet to meet someone I didn't feel excited to text with, but had chemistry meeting IRL. 

When we met IRL, I noted that he was genuinely interested in getting to know me (e.g. asking me what I do, then following up with where I plan to go with it in 5 years, then genuinely understanding my plans), was attentive and considerate (making reservations for us, asking about food preferences), was open about his life (sharing his own plans), and had hobbies, passions and routines of his own. All of these were important by my definition of partnership

Again, you have to define your friends and your partners, then figure out how to elect them. I am providing mine as an example.

I knew he was the one when I saw how he handled me accidentally crossing a boundary of his. He was calm and assumed best intentions. He treated it like a misunderstanding. This was critical to me. Someone who has a team attitude and holds room for opportunities to grow is what I need.

**After Meeting & Electing**

Relationships can mature and grow. They don't run on credit. They often die a slow and quiet death of a thousand cuts.

Once you find the right people for you (people who care, who give, who assume the best in you and want to see you thrive) then it is time to look for opportunities to cement that relationship. 

That happens with the small things like making them coffee in the morning or offering to come over with flowers for your friend when they have a ""meh"" day. It is finding opportunities to add to their lives. This can be hard for autistic people, so seek friends and partners who are willing to openly talk about what they appreciate and need with you. It is hard, but that builds real friendships rather just a semi-hostile crowd around you.

And to prevent them from dying a thousand cuts, ask questions. ""Hey, I said/did that thing. Tell me honestly, how did you feel? I am open to critique"" It is a reality that we can miss discomfort and social cues, so normalise the asking and sharing in your relationships. Reassure your friends/partners in communicating these so they don't have to quietly tolerate their way to resentment. Teach them how to confront you if you struggle yourself. It is worth it.

**I hope all this helps. It is merely what I learnt from my experience. Everyone is different. Everyone needs different friends. But we all can work on ourselves, understand what we need and seek it intentionally.**

It deals with a lot of real world issues among partners.  May have triggering themes throughout.  But other than that, enjoy the dread! 

PART 1: HER

My wife and I share the long and sometimes defeating effort of laying the kids down for bed at the end of the night. If all goes as planned, she and I can steal away and enjoy an hour of uninterrupted time together. Unfortunately, that isn’t always the case if one or both of us succumbs to the comfort of a warm bed. I wonder if she feels the same as I do when we’re completely alone. I mean, I wonder if there’s ever a flicker of shyness or nervousness that passes through her—the kind that comes on a first or second date. She probably doesn’t feel that way; it’s always been me who’s more in tune with the emotional side of things. I’ll admit, months and years of operating more like co‑workers around our children have left me clinging to small, momentary feelings like this whenever I get her all to myself. I grow increasingly excited about the idea of her—almost like falling in love again.
They say you fall in love three times in your life, and I think I’m in the middle of the second. She starts to talk about her day, about opinionated things involving her workplace. I try to be a good listener, but her words fade as I lose myself in those beautiful brown eyes—the same eyes our children have. She doesn’t notice, but I nod to show I’m listening, even as my gaze drifts to her lips: perfect and beautiful. Lips I’d love nothing more than to kiss as she babbles on, but I resist the urge and let her continue. Then I notice a long strand of hair begging to be brushed behind her ear—any excuse to touch her soft cheek. And I wonder if she ever looks at me the same way. I don’t think she does.
“Why?” someone might ask. “Why are you so moved by someone who doesn’t share the sentiment?” I have to think about those questions once in a while. The truth is, I’m still as in love with her as the moment I slipped a ring on her finger. And I have to believe she’s genuine when she says, “I love you.” But I’d be lying if I said I never wondered whether I’m naïve in my love. I’ve come to realize I’m a people‑pleaser—a trait I inherited from my mother. When I care about someone, I have no problem showering them with acts of service and gifts. Physical touch, of course, ranks high on that list. And because of this, I could never expect someone to meet these traits with their own.
As I’ve grown to understand the ever‑changing person my wife has become, I’ve learned that her love language is quiet—subtle, if it’s there at all. I remind myself that looking at her family offers a glimpse into who she is. They yell. They bicker. They don’t leave much room for moral questioning. They’re straightforward, sometimes apathetic, and they have little patience for emotional dissections. That doesn’t make them bad people. It doesn’t make her a bad person either—just someone who’ll make you work for the pathway to her heart.
And maybe that’s why I don’t always feel the same kind of love reflected back: because, without interference, those traits were never encoded in her DNA. Still, I hold on to this idea of a woman who might one day miraculously emerge from her own skin—someone who would see me in the same light I see her, and we’d grow old together, cherishing every moment of our love. But then, like a baby monitor crackling to life, I’m reminded that this is the real world—and our attention is needed elsewhere.
SCREAMING. CRYING. CLAWING. BITING. HITTING. FALLING. CRYING. CRYING. CRYING.
Sometimes you wonder how children produce so many tears without passing out. Some nights begin to blur together.
I used to say, “Mothers don’t have the hardest job in the world. Go work on an oil rig and tell me that’s not harder.” Most men probably share that opinion—but I’d bet they weren’t splitting the load fifty‑fifty. Or sometimes, a hundred to zero. When you watch your wife carry, birth, and care for a new life, you begin to see what’s behind the curtain.
That curtain was hung long ago and painted with soft pastels that said something like, “You’re about to embark on the most beautiful journey! You’ll witness the miracle of becoming a mother and cherish every moment.”
I don’t mean this cruelly, but it almost feels like a sick joke.
Moaning. Grunting. Screaming. Whispering. Crying. Crying. Crying.
A mother’s body is like the earth after a storm—split, reshaped, torn. What was once untouched now carries the memory of creation. When the tides recede, the shore is never quite the same. But when you walk it again, the sun rises over the horizon, and there’s beauty there.
I don’t want to tell you a mother’s story for her. I can only better understand my own story through hers.
On one of those quiet, uninterrupted nights, I scheduled a talk with her. This wasn’t one of our usual hour‑long conversations, half spent sharing videos on our phones. Instead, it unfolded into a three‑hour discussion. I sat across the room, giving us space to bridge the distance between us as we worked toward a shared understanding.
It began softly, with tears. Then it deepened—sobbing, questioning, searching. And it ended with us side by side, making new promises. That night brought many things into focus and answered questions.
First, she ruled out the idea that anything lacking between us was my fault. Second, she admitted that she feels like there isn’t a sexual bone in her body, even though she’s still attracted to me. We assume it’s hormonal—after the children. Third, she confessed that she hasn’t felt like herself in a long time. She catches glimpses of who she was, but never fully. Her inability—or unwillingness—to examine those feelings has left her struggling to describe them at all.
I remind myself of where she comes from—the language of her family. And words, even at their best, are a limited form of communication. I hold that in mind as I try to understand her.
She’s been broken. She’s lost her youthfulness. She’s lost her body. She’s lost the time and space to remember who she is. My heart aches for her—but it also races to fix her. I have to stop myself, remind myself that not everything can be fixed. Maybe the best help I can offer isn’t showing her the way forward, but walking by her side through it.
She’s always been my best friend—an incredible mother and strong wife. The only person I ever wanted to walk through this life with.
Everything I’m journaling here is elevated stylistically. This is not to assume things are untrue or aren’t as meaningful, because they are. I find myself writing in ways no real person would ever talk, but more so in the language of an author—or maybe my mind.
Instead of pouring my heart out to a professional psychologist, I find so much emotional healing from just putting pen to paper. Someone might think, “What a bitch. This dude has to write his feelings to get over it!” Actually, that’s more like my subconscious speaking. It’s true that I’m an emotional person, but more so, I’m an artist first. The world that I see is through a lens that makes sense to me. This makes sense when reality is complicated and messy. This is structured, thought out. There’s no walking away and regretting saying something more; it’s already here, at my own pace.
Now, I could have written a novel when it comes to what it means to be a father—what my children mean to me—but I think I have a clear focus for this writing. Fatherhood is for another time and consciousness. It deserves that.
I’m eager to get home most days—not to relax, but to see them. To see her. If I’m being completely honest with myself, there are points in my life where my day‑to‑day emotions were totally reliant on my wife. This is probably very normal, on both sides. In a way, I viewed this as a type of codependency that was disguised as supportiveness.
I want to help you. Make you happy. Convince myself that I feel seen. Because if I don’t, then my emotional compass will forever spin. She is my direction.
No. This is not healthy.
I have been rewiring my mind and unearthing answers I’d previously thought were held by someone else. They were always with me. I just wasn’t listening. There are very loud voices, but in the back—way in the back, behind layers—there are soft ones. I’d encourage anyone to practice finding them.
The root of a tree is not always seen, but it’s vital for keeping the tree alive. Its branches stretch and leaves blossom in every direction. How beautiful this tree has become. But what of the root? He’s hidden deep below, calculating his reach, twisting his foundation, and growing stronger. Nobody sees the root, but they’re not supposed to. The leaves are beautiful.
I don’t need your kind words. I don’t need your affirmation. I just need to see it in your eyes once in a while—something that says, “I’m with you. I love you.”
She has weathered the storms on the surface, and I’ve felt them below.


PART 2: ME

We step back into the bedroom. A whirlwind of crying hits us. We take our stations beside each baby, stroking soft hair, whispering reminders that we’re still here. The noise fades. The room exhales. Only the hum of the oscillating fan remains.
Through the blackness, a faint reflection glimmers in her eyes—they’re still open. I smile, reach out, find her hand. But she isn’t looking at me. Her gaze drifts somewhere behind me, somewhere far away. If only I could hear her thoughts. If only she would share them.
Then that voice—the one I thought I’d buried—crawls out of the ashes.
What if she’s fantasizing about someone else?
Shut up.
What if she longs for a real man? One who excites her with adventure instead of tormenting her with your twisted perceptions.
SHUT UP.
And then comes that feeling—like stepping from sunlight into a cold, dark space. I dread it because I know it too well. I’ve lived here before. My hand finds hers again. I rub her lifeless fingers—no response. Her eyes still wander, anywhere but mine.
I sink a little further.
The alarm tears through my dreams. 3:41 A.M. Like clockwork, I’m gathering my things in the dark. The world sleeps while I begin my day. The road glows ahead in my headlights. For a moment, it feels quiet enough to forget. Almost.
Today is a new day. I can be anyone when I walk back through that door tonight. I can be the reminder of fun, of youth, of being needed. Or maybe I could just be me—that’s what started all this, wasn’t it? But she’ll still be the same. Cold.
“Man, why don’t you just leave her? You’re never happy.” My coworker leans back in his chair—the unwilling therapist of my lunch breaks.
“It’ll be fine,” I tell him. “She’s an amazing mother, honestly.” He smirks like he’s heard this a hundred times.
“Yeah, but there’s a difference between being a good mother and being a good wife. You’ve got to communicate your needs as a man.”
But I have, haven’t I? Have I not been clear enough? Or do I just know she won’t do anything with it? Probably both. These talks aren’t helpful. He just becomes another voice in my head—negative thoughts dressed as wisdom. Sure, in most marriages, communication is vital. But she doesn’t need anything. She doesn’t seem to want anything.
Life was simple once. Before kids. Before bills. Before alarms at 3:41 A.M. We were eager back then—chasing love like it might run away. She loved her body. She was confident. She had opinions, dreams, purpose. We talked for hours about the life we have now. And we built it.
So what happens when you get everything you ever wanted by age thirty? You have fun, right? You make new memories. You chase smaller dreams that keep you moving—a walk‑in shower, a new kitchen, a family car, a trip together. Then something shifts.
How about stop touching your husband…
Or sit on your phone all night, scrolling past him.
Or stop talking about your feelings altogether.
And now the anger rises. The sadness follows. How did I end up back here again? Our long talks—the writing, the promises—did any of it help? Or am I just orbiting the same questions, over and over? My thoughts accelerate. My palms turn clammy. My breathing breaks rhythm.
“You good, dude?”
My coworker is still watching as I stand abruptly, slam the door behind me, and rush to an empty break room. Another panic attack. First one in a month.
Look at yourself. You let her do this to you—without her even trying. You think you deserve this? You think you’ve earned pain like this? There are soldiers who’ve seen children die, parents who’ve buried their own. And you? What have you suffered?
Get away from me. You were gone. I got rid of you.
You convinced yourself of a lot of things. That you’re not needed. That you can handle it alone. That being unseen makes you noble. You let a woman crawl into your mind and bring you to your knees. You think your “good deeds” make you strong? You think they’ll save you from yourself?
I never needed you. You’re the Devil.
Please! What use would the Devil have for someone as small and as insignificant—with all your “problems”?
I think he would have all the use in the world for them. For my soul. For every man’s soul. All at the same time.
You’ve truly fallen into delusion then. Blame the Devil for something you can’t take control of.
I can see the house peek over the hill as I approach, her car parked in its usual spot.
A home that should be teeming with light and life instead looks cold and hollow.
Pulling in, I kill the engine and sit for a moment. The plan I’d had earlier—to shower her with hugs and smiles—died sometime this afternoon. In its place, something colder formed. I decided I wouldn’t lay a finger on her tonight. I’d only respond if spoken to, and even then, only neutrally. I want to see if she’ll break first.
I know I’m playing games with my wife now, even if it’s one‑sided. But I tell myself it’s a test—of our love, our compatibility. How long could I keep it up? Days? Weeks? Months?
Still, there’s a small, cruel hope in me: that she’ll come to my side, rub my shoulder, and bridge the distance I’ve built.
When I finally open the door, the house greets me with the sound of a children’s show—bright voices echoing through a dim, airless room. No one in sight. I set my things down and take in the scene. Disaster.
Stale food on the floor. Toys everywhere. Dishes stacked and buzzing with flies. I never asked for perfection. Never expected dinner waiting on the table. But I thought at least common sense might fill in the gaps. What has she been doing all day?
The answer finds me before I finish the thought.
She’s in the bedroom, the only light coming from her phone screen. The kids sleep beside her. She looks up at me, squinting through the dark.
“Hey,” she says.
“Hi,” I leave her with my reply and continue to the bathroom.
Closing the door behind me, I sit on the toilet seat and just wait. What am I waiting for? She’s not going to ask me about my day. I was just the one‑second break in her infinite scrolling. God, I want to snatch that fucking phone right out of her hands and whip it toward a wall. I want it in pieces. I want her to be faced with what’s happening around her.
“Hunny?” Just then, her voice—from the other side of the door.
This is a pivotal moment in my mind. I like to think the next words out of her mouth could change my entire outlook.
I respond, “Yeah?”
“You gonna be long? ’Cause I gotta take a shower.”
THIS WAS IT. THIS WAS THE STRAW THAT BROKE THE CAMEL’S BACK. I AM AN OBSTACLE FOR HER TO MOVE AROUND. I AM THE EXTRA PAIR OF ARMS TO TAKE THE KIDS WHEN SHE NEEDS TO SCROLL. I AM THE MONEY‑MAKER, THE PERSONAL ACCOUNTANT, THE MAID!
SHE’S GONE. MY WIFE DOES NOT EXIST. IN HER PLACE IS NOW THIS THING, WALKING AROUND MY HOUSE DEAD. DEAD LIKE A GIRL’S BODY THAT WASHED UP ON SHORE. SHE HAS NO LEAVES. SHE CREAKS AND GROANS AND SNAPS WITH THE WIND. HER FOUNDATION IS DYING!
“Be out in a sec,” I respond softly.


PART 3: US

Three days. We have not touched each other in three days. We exchange information on a need‑to‑know basis. I listen to a few snarky comments about her work. I received a “good night” the first day, but not these last two. We are just floating around each other, completing daily tasks for the children. If it wasn’t for the kids, we might be considered complete robots in this house.
Of course this is all devastating. I really believed I’d break by the first night after seeing a glimpse of hope in her—something to make me throw it all out and get back to living. I did not anticipate three days and counting.
I cannot think at work. My mind is somewhere else. I’m afraid I’m beginning to look like her from the outside. Whatever disease she has is affecting me. A dying disease. The children most definitely feel this, even though they can’t say it.
I can see the confusion in their eyes. I feel their distress and frustrations. They’ve been especially hard these last few days.
I’m just tired. I’ve been fighting an emotional battle for too long. I believe my body is telling me that it must come to an end.
Is this justifiable enough? If I slid her a paper that said “Petition for Divorce” across it, how would she react? Maybe she would hide a moment of relief behind aggravation. What a waste. A waste of life and time. But what about the kids? Am I dooming them to a reality that’s now split? What kind of mental turmoil would they accumulate under the surface, I wonder—things they would only later in life be able to diagnose.
“Oh, I must have felt this way because I watched my parents go through a divorce when I was young.”
“I never felt the effective operation of a real family dynamic because my dad split with my mom.”
“Mom’s new boyfriend beats her up ’cause she stopped having sex with him.”
I can hear it all now. But this isn’t my fault. I would have never built a future around someone if I could have foreseen this. That’s not to say I regret my children. They’re the only thing that keeps me going.
I stand in the kitchen with a cup of coffee pressed to my nose, waiting for it to cool.
From the corner of my eye, I see her stumble out of the bedroom and make a beeline for the couch. That cushion must be molded to her by now. I feel the glare forming before I can stop it—so I smooth my face.
“Where’s the remote?” she asks through a yawn.
I wait a beat. “Good morning.”
She digs into the couch, pulling out toy cars, broken graham crackers, a sock.
“Hunny, did you lose the remote?” she says, not hearing me at all.
“Good morning,” I repeat, a little sharper this time.
“Seriously, now I can’t turn shows on for the kids. God damn it.” Her hands slap her lap—that sound of defeat.
“GOOD MORNING!” I yell, the words ripping out of me before I can stop them. The whole house jolts awake. She jumps, eyes wide, confusion freezing her face.
“What the fuck?” she stammers.
Through the monitor, the baby starts crying. Of course.
“Why did you do that? You fucking woke him up.” She stands, disgust curling her lip as she moves past me toward the bedroom. “The fuck is wrong with you?”
I blow across the top of my coffee, steadying myself for the storm I just invited.
SCREAMING. CRYING. YANKING. SPILLING. THROWING.
The house is chaos today. I sit with my feet up on the ottoman. Comfy. My second cup of coffee is now room temp. She darts back and forth, addressing one disaster after another. She’s covered in damp drool and tears. Maybe a bit of applesauce too. Or puke. I don’t know.
She looks toward me with that disgusted look again.
“Are you gonna do anything?” she yells over the sounds of a possessed two‑year‑old. He thrashes on the floor, inconsolable. In the background, the youngest cries to be freed from the constraints of his high chair.
“I can’t hear you. There are too many kids screaming,” I say calmly. Without responding, she scoffs and grits her teeth. She blocks me out with a face that says, “I’ll deal with that comment later.”
She yells at the two‑year‑old to get up on his feet. I can see her hairline drenched in sweat. Now, in this instance, I would never let things get this out of control normally. I’d be rushing to her side, distracting the youngest with freedom, and flying away with the possessed two‑year‑old—somewhere we could contain the sounds.
But if I’m being honest, I kind of liked this. The more they cried, the more frustrated she got, the better I felt.
Normal parts of my subconscious would tell me I’m being an asshole. But it’s quiet—as if my body and mind have found the best path forward. A collected agreement to salvage our mind and our soul. I’ve been fighting too long. I’ve given up what felt like everything that made me me.
“I can’t drive a manual. Get rid of that dumb car. It’s not a family car anyway.”
“These hunting trips are really not helpful when I’m stuck with the kids.”
“I don’t want your friends coming here. They’re too loud, and they’ll wake the kids up.”
I think eventually it’ll whittle down, and I’ll be the only thing left to remove.
It’s frightening how fast the mind can evolve—how fast conclusions can form. Just a week ago, I was fantasizing about her—some invisible love I thought was between us. But I was naïve.
How many times would I go back and forth between two realities? Which one is true? Maybe neither of them are. Maybe it’s something in between.
No. I’m on the right path. I’m sticking to my guns. Just stop thinking so much.
After enduring a napless day, the kids quickly fell asleep. If this were any other night, it would be a great opportunity to hang out—kids are out early, gaining an extra hour of time. Shame. From the passing looks on her face, I could tell she was exhausted. She would probably go to sleep herself soon.
She catches me in the bathroom, brushing my teeth. I don’t look up, but I feel her eyes on me.
“What’s going on?” she asks, exasperated.
Mouth still full of toothpaste, I answer flatly, “What’s up?”
She stares, brow raised, scowling.
“You’ve been acting weird. You didn’t really help with the kids at all today either, so that’s awesome.”
I keep my eyes on the mirror and spit.
“Yeah? Well, I’m sorry. I feel fine.”
She exhales hard, shaking her head as her shoulders drop.
“Whatever. Goodnight.” She starts down the dark hallway.
“That’s it?” I call out before she’s gone.
She stops, sighs. “What do you mean?”
I turn to face her. “You don’t have anything else to say?”
She opens her hands and lets them slap her thighs. “Nope. You obviously want to fight about something.”
“Oh, I do? Or maybe I just want to hear what my wife’s thinking.”
“Hah.” She shakes her head, eyes closed. “What do you want me to say?”
I lean against the doorframe, closing the space between us. “I want you to express something. I want you to show me that you feel anything—even a little bit—about us.”
She snaps back, “I feel fine. The kids are a lot, and it’d be nice to have some help, hunny. I’m tired.”
“You’re tired? I’ve been tired for a year!” My voice rises.
She covers her face. “Oh my God. Please.”
I stand upright now, jaw set. “See? You don’t care. I’ve been shouting it from the rooftops—I’m not okay! This relationship isn’t okay. You’re just someone I live with.”
She lowers her hands and stares through me. “Okay. Then divorce me. I don’t know what you want from me.”
“Okay,” I say quietly.
She doesn’t react—she’s already left the conversation in her head.
“Yeah. Awesome.” She turns away.
Her footsteps fade down the hall. I stand in the doorway, toothbrush still in hand.
I get a sense she doesn’t realize that I’m honest in my response. Doesn’t matter. That was all I needed to hear. My mind was teetering before, but now it’s clear. The fight isn’t what hurts anymore; it’s knowing that I’ve stopped wanting to fix it. I want to divorce my wife.

PART 4: THE END OF THE WORLD
     
“Petition for Dissolution of Marriage.”
The freshly printed document sits on my desk. Blank.
My hand holds a pen.
Click. Click. Click.
I can’t believe this is the culmination. Signing it would make everything real. For now, it’s just paper—harmless in its stillness.
I picture her reaction. Relief, probably. Maybe she’s been waiting for me to make the first move so she can say, “He’s the one who wanted to end it. I was happy. He was delusional.”
A sigh escapes—half dread, half release. I don’t give my thoughts time to negotiate with my heart. I press the pen down and begin to write.
As usual, I rise over the hill and see the house.
Empty.
Her car’s gone. Unusual for a Monday at four. She always leaves work, picks up the kids, and comes straight home. They’re too much for her to manage anywhere else.
Maybe she’s grocery shopping. Maybe she’s with someone else.
I don’t care.
I pull into the drive and pinch the folded paper between my fingers like it’s something fragile.
The sidewalk is lined with forgotten toys—sun‑bleached, dirt‑caked, wrecked by rain. I was always too lazy to put them away. Maybe I hoped they’d be used again someday.
We used to play outside together.
We used to take pictures, view them later after the kids fell asleep, and laugh.
Time stood still back then.
Now, the toys are relics of something that withered—something that never had the nurture to grow.
I kneel down and run my hand across a pair of rusted training wheels. I spin them and watch the rim turn until it slows to a stop.
Tears erupt.
I TRIED. GOD KNOWS I TRIED, AND I CAN DIE IN CONTENT KNOWING I DID EVERYTHING RIGHT—KNOWING THAT I DIDN’T THROW A SECOND MORE OF MY LIFE AWAY.
Oh God. Please help me get through this one.
It’s been two hours. I’ve held the same position at the head of the dining room table for two hours. The paper is in front of me. I can hear the hands of a wall clock tick. Every second I exhale, it’s like sick air leaving my lungs.
I’ve been waiting for that sound—the click of a door handle. Now that my mind accepts that this is over, it floods with the image of adultery. I see her laughing, her hands running across the chest of another man—a man more masculine than me. I see them making love. She cries out like she’s been holding it in all along. I can feel my grip tighten in my sweaty palms.
I shouldn’t care, really. As far as I’m concerned, she can go on and fuck up someone else’s life all she wants the second she signs this. I feel bad for the poor bastard who pours his heart out to her—a guy who doesn’t know she’ll go cold the second she’s done with him.
I’m reminded of her mother—a woman who’s been through two failed marriages and is currently on her third. Was this seed planted long ago? Was my wife predestined to fall out of love? There’s a fine line between influence and inheritance. I don’t think I’m comfortable with either answer.
Click.
I hear the door open. I pull my hands from under my chin and sit upright. My heart begins to beat a little faster now.
I hear the kids stumble into the house. I hear the crinkling of plastic bags. Then, her voice. Out of breath.
“Okay, go find Daddy.”
The kids run past the dining room; they don’t notice me. I hear her footsteps follow.
The heart rate increases a bit more.
Finally, she comes into view. She’s holding grocery sacks and has a diaper bag hanging off one shoulder. Her hair is tangled and messy. She breathes heavily. She stops and examines me for a moment.
“What’re you doing?”
I don’t respond. Instead, my eye gestures to the paper.
She speaks like she’s got other things to attend to. “Hunny, what? What is that?”
I lean forward and rest my elbows on the table.
“We need to talk,” I say softly.
She looks at the paper, then back at me. Then back at the paper. She slowly stumbles across the room, her bags dragging. She leans over the table and squints.
Her head shoots back up toward me. Her expression is horrified.
“What? Hunny, what the fuck is this?”
I blink slowly and inhale before spilling the news.
“We need to start this process. It’ll be harder if we sit on—”
I’m cut off by her eruption of tears and shock.
“No! What are you doing right now? Are you fucking kidding me?”
She lets all her bags drop out of her arms as her hands cup her mouth. Her eyes are piercing and welling up. I resist the urge, but I can feel the lump in my throat growing. My eyes fill with pressure. The sight of her like this has always broken me—even now.
“PLEASE. DO NOT ACT LIKE THIS RIGH—”
I’m cut off again.
“SO I MADE ONE SARCASTIC COMMENT OUT OF ANGER AND YOU SERIOUSLY GO AND DO THIS? YOU WANT TO DIVORCE ME?” She’s unraveling.
I can feel my tears forming, but I stop them in their tracks.
“This cannot be happening right now. Oh my God, I feel sick. Please. Please, please tell me this isn’t real.” She pleads. She begins to back away.
I don’t know what to feel in this moment. I didn’t expect this reaction from her—as if she’s blindsided by this. How could that be possible? It’s been so obvious for so long!
“Stop pretending like you love me! You haven’t for a long time!” I yell with my eyes closed.
She lowers her hands as a newfound shock crawls across her face.
“You think I don’t love you?”
I say the obvious, “I’m your husband. I know you better than anyone in the world. I can see that I’m just someone that’s in your life—not a part of it.”
“DAVID!” she yells. “I LOVE YOU! I’VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU!”
I shake my head and let it hang.
“Please don’t say that. YOU’RE LYING TO YOURSELF!”
“You’re the only person I ever wanted to spend my life with,” she adds.
“Stop. Right now.” My voice is buried in my chest.
She begins to step closer, trying to make her words clearer.
“You’ve seen me at my absolute worst. Lately it’s been hard. Yes. Okay? My body doesn’t feel like mine, and I’ve gone through this before, and we talked about it then, and we talked about it with this last pregnancy too!”
Her voice pleads harder now. “I was waiting. And I thought you were waiting too—waiting for this to pass so we could get back to being us. Also—” she begins to dig in her pocket. She pulls out a single packaged tampon and throws it on the table.
“—I’M ON MY PERIOD! I GET CRANKY. DOESN’T MEAN I DON’T LOVE YOU, DAVID!” she yells in anger now.
“Sign the paper, Mel.” I can’t take her words anymore. Every stab of confession feels like it’s tearing my mind apart.
She’s frozen, just staring at me—trying to really figure it out for herself. Or maybe she’s just mustering up some emotional excuse to keep me holding out a little longer.
I see the kids wander up to the edge of the room. They keep their distance, watching as if they know.
When she speaks now, it’s quiet and pointed.
“Hunny, I think you have some serious issues you need to work out. You’ve built up some—” her tears break her words, “some kind of delusion, I think. I love you, but if you can honestly sit there and believe this, without a shadow of a doubt, then I don’t know what else to say.”
She squats down in a catcher’s position and lets her head fall into her hands. Her dangling hair covers her face.
I hear her whisper to the floor, “I always loved you…”
I sit on her words for a moment.
“You know this is all for show, right? You know she’s afraid that if you leave, it’d be a huge inconvenience for her. Who’s gonna help with the kids and pay the water bill this month?”
I don’t need you for this.
“Are you joking? This is your test! If you break now, right here, then you are doomed to be a prisoner for the rest of your life—a prisoner to his own mind who’s too afraid. You need me in this moment more than you’ve ever needed me.”
My mind darts. Now all the voices come back at once. My heart racing faster now.
“SHE’S STILL LYING!”
“YOU’RE FOLDING. YOU’RE A BOY!”
“SHE FANTASIZES ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE!”
“TOUCHING YOU DISGUSTS HER!”
“SHE HATES EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU!”
A warm hand on the side of my face.
It all stops.
The voices fade. The air goes still.
I open my eyes, and I see hers—deep, beautiful brown eyes. She’s searching for something in mine—as if she’s telling me to fight.
All the sounds fade away now. There’s nothing. Nothing but us.
Silence breaks when her lips form.
“I love you.” She breathes the words.
I feel her breath hit me. So close. Her fingers brush away a tear drying on the corner of my eye. Her tears, still falling.
My heart slows down. Way, way down.
Thump, thump… thump… thump.
The storm passed, and I looked down into the black mud. There’s something green trying to grow from under my foot.

Thought i would post an update - I posted a ""Looking to join the club"" post about 2 weeks ago.

Here is how i am getting on...

First the good news:

Theory = passed - smashed it with 49/50 questions correct and 60/75 (think it is 75) on the perception test - so that is all done.

Had my CBT today and this is how it went:

Got on a 125 today with NO experience at all.

First impressions:

\- This is harder than i thought it would be.

\- Bike was surprisingly heavier than i thought it would be.

Started off really well but then i started messing up the figure 8 maneuver - nothing major, just kept on dropping my foot.

Got in my head a bit and ended up struggling a little and not going for the road ride.

Went back for more training in the playground with cones - turns out my instructor noticed i was always dragging the rear brake and this is why i was having trouble.

I would set off, find bite point and then push the rear brake without thinking about it - i think cause my foot was resting over it.

The moment i got this ironed out - i started to have much more fun, got better with the clutch, was able to control the brake more and went up into 2nd gear - Woo hoo! :)

Ended up doing the training - pretend junctions - turning left, right and emergency stop fine - by the time the day ended:

\- I was disappointed to not get CBT on the first day - as i did not make the road.

BUT:

\- Felt was more confident and am sure when i go back for a bit more practice for the road i will be fine.

My instructor recommended coming back - a bit more practice in the morning and then hopefully make the road ride.

As people have said - CBT is not a guaranteed pass - especially if you are totally new to bikes.

Didn't mind too much as i will not give up and just keep slogging away.

Anyone got any inspiration for me?

Has anyone failed the CBT and are now ripping around on a 600? :)

Still got my goal of doing DAS and going to Ninja 500 but i have a long way to go!

Thanks for reading.

For anyone still to do CBT my advice:

\- Take water with you and a flask - i was dehydrated - just drunk coffee before arriving and think this affected concentration.

\- Do not look down at the bike - keep your head and eyes up and look where you want to turn.

\- Practice with the clutch and find the biting point - even ask if they can adjust the lever if it is too much of a reach.

\- Don't do what i did and hug the back brake.

\- Be confident and feel the bike - i was starting to get this at the end of the day and felt awesome.

Any thoughts or help guys?

I will keep going and keep you all updated.

I will still join the club! I just don't think i am going to be the next Ghost Rider anytime soon lol.

Was great fun though - if only to use to see where I am at.

Not disheartened - but was tougher than i thought.

Cheers for listening and have fun out there!",6,1760819025.0,MotoUK,1,0.88,False

# The Pain Gmail AI Scheduling Eliminates

Gmail AI scheduling solves a universal problem.

Let me paint the picture we all know.

Someone emails you asking to meet next week.

You reply ""Sure, when works for you?""

They reply ""I'm free Tuesday or Thursday.""

You reply ""Tuesday doesn't work, how about Wednesday?""

They reply ""Wednesday afternoon is better.""

You reply ""Okay, 3 PM?""

They reply ""Actually, can we do 2 PM?""

You get the idea with Gmail AI scheduling solving this.

It's painful without Gmail AI scheduling.

It wastes time and mental energy.

Sometimes 10 emails just to schedule 30 minutes.

We've all been doing this for years before Gmail AI scheduling.

That's why Calendly blew up.

You send your link, people book, done.

But even that has problems Gmail AI scheduling fixes.

You need to send a link.

It looks impersonal to clients.

Some people don't like clicking external links.

Gmail AI scheduling made all that obsolete.

The scheduling happens inside your email.

No extra tools with Gmail AI scheduling.

No links to send.

Just AI doing the work.

# Gmail AI Scheduling Current Limitations

Gmail AI scheduling only works for one-on-one meetings right now.

That means you and one other person.

If you're scheduling a group meeting, Gmail AI scheduling won't work yet.

Google says they're working on it.

But for now, Gmail AI scheduling is limited.

For most people, that's fine.

Most meetings are one-on-one anyway.

Client calls work perfectly with Gmail AI scheduling.

Team catchups are ideal.

Coffee chats work great with Gmail AI scheduling.

This covers 80% of your scheduling needs.

Another Gmail AI scheduling limitation is calendar compatibility.

If they don't use Google Calendar, it might not work smoothly.

The clickable buttons might not create an invite.

They might have to add it manually.

There's friction if they use Outlook or Apple Calendar with Gmail AI scheduling.

Gmail AI scheduling also needs specific context.

If you write something vague, it might not know what to suggest.

Be specific with Gmail AI scheduling.

Say ""30 minutes next week"" not ""let's meet soon.""

The clearer you are, the better Gmail AI scheduling performs.

Time zones can get weird with Gmail AI scheduling.

If you're emailing someone in a different zone, mention it.

Otherwise, Gmail AI scheduling might suggest wrong times.

# Gmail AI Scheduling FAQ

**How does Gmail AI scheduling work?**

The fact that it take years for some to determine their type is not OK. From what I see, trying to pinpoint the exact IEs placement without **understanding the simple basics** turns typing into an impossible quest. Vague type descriptions don't help either.

Let's always keep in mind is that Socionics doesn't focus on **outward behavior** (*what* is said or done). It's about the underlying mechanisms of **information processing** (*how* and *why*).

I hope this post brings some clarity and helps you with self-typing. If it proves helpful, I'm happy to cover other topics as well.

Let's start with Ethics-Logic theory, and then move on to practical comparison.

# ETHICS

Ethics focuses on the human, social, moral, and emotional content of reality. It centers on understanding emotions, social interactions, subjective human dynamics, and the impact of actions on individuals and relationships. The emphasis is on values, empathy, and harmony. It is attuned to the emotional landscape, considering the motivations and feelings of others in their decision-making. 

# Extraverted ethics (Fe) - Ethics of Emotions

Fe focuses on external expression of emotion and social atmosphere. Fe is adept at understanding and managing the emotions of others, fostering group cohesion, and maintaining social equilibrium.

**Vocabulary**: Fe speech emphasizes interpersonal relationships, emotional expression, and social dynamics. Keywords include: harmony, empathy, connection, understanding, support, cooperation, compromise. The language might use emotionally charged words and focus on the overall social atmosphere.

Example of Fe expression:

>“The party was in full swing; people actively mingled. A dating couple whispered, exchanging impressions, while another pair, previously overly friendly, now argued vehemently. A small group broke off, scattering, their comments about each other laced with sarcasm. The initially festive atmosphere turned vile, fueled by quarrels and a resulting scandal. The night ended with hurried farewells, leaving many disappointed.”

# Introverted ethics (Fi) - Relational Ethics

Fi focuses on internal values and personal authenticity. It is deeply connected to its own inner world of values and beliefs. It makes decisions based on its own deeply held principles and subjective feelings, and strives for personal integrity. 

**Vocabulary**: Fi speech emphasizes personal values, authenticity, and inner feelings. Keywords include: integrity, authenticity, values, beliefs, principles, conscience, personal truth. The language might be more introspective and focus on the impact of actions on the individual's sense of self.

Example of Fi Expression:

>“My best friend cancelled our trip, leaving me utterly disappointed and despondent. The loneliness felt awful, and her lack of consideration really hurt. I missed her terribly; this unpleasant situation has strained our relationship. I value our friendship and hope things improve, but I'm currently feeling uneasy and apprehensive.”

# LOGIC

Logic focuses on the inanimate, measurable, systemic, and procedural content of reality. It's about cause-and-effect relationships, rules, systems, objective analysis of facts and figures, and the inanimate world. The emphasis is on information processing and reaching conclusions based on objective evidence. It prioritizes the accuracy and consistency of information, seeking to understand how things work and to identify efficient systems. 

# Extraverted logic (Te) - Practical Logic

Te focuses on the external application of logic and efficiency. It values objective standards and measurable results.

* Focus on technologies, on how the process unfolds and how something is done.
* Technical aspects of projects and processes.
* Efficiency, achieving the best results with minimal effort.
* Management and optimization of the workflows and production processes.
* Practicality.

**Vocabulary**: Te speech emphasizes facts, processes, efficiency, and measurable results. Keywords include: precise, accurate, efficient, verifiable, systematized, optimize, calibrate, implement. The language includes technical terminology, causal chains, and precise measurements.

Example of Te expression:

>“The component must weigh 2.5 grams. Verify this using a calibrated scale and record the results. Compare the results to the sample; if there is a deviation, recalibrate the device. All steps must be documented in the report.”

# Introverted logic (Ti) - Structural Logic

Ti focuses on internal consistency and logical structure. It strives for a deep understanding of underlying principles and systems. It values accuracy, precision, and the internal coherence of its own thought processes and models.

**Vocabulary**: Ti speech emphasizes logical analysis, systematization, and underlying principles. Keywords include: principle, system, law, structure, analyze, deduce, categorize, framework, abstract. 

Example of Ti Expression:

>""The observed pattern is likely due to a previously unknown underlying factor. My hypothesis is that this is a structural issue within the system. The phenomenon is not a result of direct causation, but of interdependent components interacting within the framework. The next step is to classify the data to clarify relationships and eliminate discrepancies.”

\---

**A Very Important Note:** Logical types sometimes mistype themselves as Ethical type. Their justification is that they grasp people and relationships well, readily solving problems by offering sensible, practical advice that yields concrete results. Yet, the contradiction becomes clear when you ask them to detail a person's character and their personal connection to them. They'll invariably fail, falling back on describing individuals purely by their roles and functions—what they do and how they perform it.

# Ethics Isn't Always Kindness, Logic Isn't Always Rudeness

A common misconception in Socionics is the belief that **Ethical types** are inherently kind, courteous, or even saintly, while **Logical types** are coarse, blunt, and socially insensitive. This simplistic view misses the fundamental difference in how these types process information.

In truth, **Ethics** is simply the domain of human relations and emotional states. It focuses on the feelings, dynamics, and subjective experiences within the world of people. An Ethical type is adept at sensing subtle emotional cues. For them, the **felt experience** often matters more than the factual event.

Whether an individual turns out to be kind, sarcastic, sensitive, or manipulative is determined by their personal morality, upbringing, and life circumstances—not by their Socionics type.

Individuals of **Logical types** also possess ethics; it’s just integrated into their system differently.

**Differences in Emotional Processing**

Ethical types experience emotions as a **unified, fluid field** where complex, mixed feelings (like simultaneous joy and sadness) are common. They switch between feelings easily, empathize naturally, and quickly absorb the emotions of others.

In contrast, Logical types perceive emotions as **separate, defined states**. If they're angry, they are angry; if joyful, they are joyful. They tend to switch between these states abruptly, separating their emotional life from their tasks and analytical work.

A Logical type, when interrupted during work to hear about an emotional event, may not immediately shift focus; to them, 'emotions and tasks reside in different rooms.' If feelings impede logical analysis, they are often mentally postponed or 'switched off' until later.

**Problem vs. Person Focus**

When a Logical type hears a complaint, they are primarily listening for a **problem** that can be broken down, analyzed, and solved. Their focus is on understanding the facts: *what* happened, *why*, and *what* the actionable solution is.

An Ethical type, conversely, immediately focuses on the **person's emotional state**—how they feel and what they are experiencing. Their priority is to validate and sympathize.

# Illustrative Examples

Below are a few examples to highlight the difference in processing focus.

*Before you say you're somewhere in the middle or that you might react differently depending on the circumstances, think of it as having two hands, one dominant. Which one do you use more often? Which one is your first, natural response?*

**1. On Job Exhaustion**

**The Complaint:** ""I am so tired of this job, the constant deadlines, no recognition, and the salary isn't growing!""

**Logical Type's Response:** ""So, three things are bothering you at once: the eternal race against deadlines, the lack of appreciation for your work, and the stagnant salary?""

*Logical Type's Internal Focus: The person expressed a lot of emotion, but if I break it down, there are only three core, definable problems. I’ll clearly define them so we can move toward a solution.*

**Ethical Type's Response:** ""Oh my gosh, that sounds completely exhausting. I can hear the absolute weariness in your voice. Do you just want to vent for a while? I'm here to listen.""

*Ethical Type's Internal Focus: The person is feeling terrible. Now is not the time for analysis. They need a safe space where their feelings are accepted. My job is to be present and validate the emotional weight.*

**2. On Project Ambition**

**The Concern:** ""I think our new project is too ambitious, and we won't meet the deadline with the current resources.""

**Logical Type's Response:** ""So you see the problem as having been assigned more tasks than we can realistically handle within this timeframe?""

*Logical Type's Internal Focus: This is a classic efficiency problem. Let's clearly formulate the logical conflict: resources are low, tasks are numerous, and time is short. Objectively, we won't succeed under current parameters.*

**Ethical Type's Response:** ""I completely understand. Plans like that really make you feel uneasy, as if they've burdened us with an impossible load. We are in this together.""

*Ethical Type's Internal Focus: The person is feeling immense pressure and anxiety. My role is to show that this feeling is normal, and I share it. I need to demonstrate that I understand the emotional weight of this responsibility.*

**3. On a Broken Agreement**

**The Issue:** ""I don't understand why he is behaving this way. We agreed on something else!""

**Logical Type's Response:** ""Wait, stop. So he is not doing what you agreed upon? That's a breach of contract.""

*Logical Type's Internal Focus: It’s simple: there was an established agreement, and he violated the terms. That violation is the whole problem that needs fixing.*

**Ethical Type's Response:** ""That is so hurtful. It is a real blow to trust. I understand how much pain and discomfort you are feeling right now from that betrayal.""

*Ethical Type's Internal Focus: The issue isn't merely a breach of a formal contract. The person has been betrayed and is hurt by the injustice. I need to name and validate that specific feeling and show that I am on their side.*

**4. On an Urgent Deadline**

**The Crisis:** ""This report needs to be submitted by the end of the day, or there will be serious trouble.""

**Logical Type's Response:** ""Got it, it's serious. So if we don't submit it today, there will be a major failure/issue with the project schedule?""

*Logical Type's Internal Focus: I need to understand the level of criticality. Is this just a preferable deadline, or is it truly a functional disaster? I must gauge the logical consequences.*

**Ethical Type's Response:** ""Whew, the race is on! What can I do to make things even a little bit easier for you? Can I bring coffee or help you check something?""

*Ethical Type's Internal Focus: The person is stressed and under tremendous pressure. I need to share that tension with them and immediately offer help so they do not feel alone in this high-pressure situation.*

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

Would it be a turn off? Reason for asking is I know rose can come off feminine. But there are some masculine style rose colognes. I personally love the smell of them and want some for myself. But also don’t want to deter men because of it. What are your thoughts?

1oa68jl,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1oa68jl/i_am_tired_of_feeling_miserable_and_lonely_all/,I am tired of feeling miserable and lonely all the time,"Hey, I‘m F22, and I lost my friend group when I was 16. They got involved in things I couldn’t really stand behind, and I decided to step away — something I thought was the right decision at the time (and still do), but I didn’t realize just how lonely things would get after that.
Since then, I’ve moved to a new country and have honestly struggled to connect with people. I’ve never really found someone to do simple things with, like just going out for coffee. It feels like life keeps moving forward for everyone else, while I’m somehow stuck. Most of my days are spent reading and studying.
A sad little fact: my goal for this year was actually to read less so that I might socialise more… but yeah, spoiler alert — that didn’t really happen. I ended up getting lost in fictional worlds again, because I don’t really know what to do with the real one.
I used to play video games with people online, and while that filled a gap for a while, some really bad experiences made me pull away from that too. I guess I don’t have a strong “hobby” right now — I mean, yes, I read a lot (which might sound like a hobby), but I’m not into the idea of book clubs or deep discussions with strangers about what I’m reading. I read to escape, mostly.
My interests (like alternative fashion, music/going to concerts, drawing, reading, watching anime etc.) tend to attract more introverted people — and they’re usually at home too, like me. Sports would probably help me socialise more, but I’m not really interested. I used to go to the gym and actually liked it, but anxiety eventually made me stop, and I haven’t been back since.
I’ve been lonely for a long time. And I’m trying — I really am. It’s hard to put myself out there, but I also don’t want to keep making excuses. I’d love to find a friend — not just anyone, but someone who really gets it. I guess I just don’t know where to look anymore.
My current idea is to start small: I plan to go to the library at least once a week starting next week — just to get used to being around people again. I think I come off as cold or distant when someone tries to talk to me, but the truth is, I just get really anxious. Sometimes I start hyperventilating, which probably doesn't help lol.
It’s just tiring to always be alone and do everything by yourself. I used to be more open — I’d joke around all the time n stuff but this isolation really killed that spark. And I miss that version of me. 
So yeah, I’m trying. Slowly, awkwardly — but genuinely trying.",4,1760818861.0,lonely,21,0.67,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.
