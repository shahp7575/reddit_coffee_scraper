I was in a long term relationship that ended a few months ago and I got around to updating my instagram to reflect that in the last month. A few weeks after a guy that I used to be friends with in 4th and 5th grade reached out at like 11:30pm on a Tuesday night (we are 21 now). He said hey! I’m not sure what made me think of you but I hope you’re doing well. Say hi to your dad for me? (For context my dad was his teacher in 6th grade and his mom was the room mom for him). I responded the next morning and we chatted a bit he shared what he’s majoring in, that he’s in his last year of college but he never asked me any questions about me I had to ask him. Then out of nowhere he says he asks if I like coffee and we should meet up considering we haven’t talked since we were kids really but he followed it up with no pressure. I agreed and told him to let me know when he gets his schedule for work next week he ends it on cool I’ll let you know! Two days go by and he asks if I’ve been to this one coffee place in town I say no and we then set a date he ends it on perfect and three more days go by I text him to confirm and we meet up. The idea was we would meet after I got off work for coffee and he said we will see where the vibes take us. Well we hung out for 4 hours we got dinner after then walked on the trail by his house. He offered me to come in but said that his mom wouldn’t except to see me and I said oh it’s okay cuz I didn’t want to intrude. On the way back from the trail I looked at the time and I said I had to go but I said let’s take a rain check on the pictures he wanted to show me he agreed got in the car to drive me back to mine at the coffee shop and he was like wow time really flew. When I got home I texted him thank you for an amazing night and he said I love hanging tonight! The soonest I can show you those pictures (something from school) is tomorrow or later this weekend. We agreed on tomorrow but the next morning his responses were kind of short we agreed to meet again at 5:30 but then after he agreed he then said hey, I won’t have much time tonight I would hate to make you drive out just to hang for a little. Could you do next week? I definitely wanna make it worth it you know? I said I’d like that I can’t stay out too late tonight anyway so just let me know what works for you and he said ok. He also liked the Venmo payment I sent him and set it private. 4 days of silence I broke and asked how is 4th of July was and our conversation seemed like he was not asking me anything about me again I had to ask everything.

1. I would love to know anything you could tell me about my grandmother’s charm bracelet. Supposedly my grandfather gifted her the various charms over the years. That was very much his M.O. and their relationship was my foundational understanding of long and lasting love. 

2. My grandmother’s wedding band doesn’t have any marks or identification on it. So anything you can tell me about that piece would be great. 

3. My grandfather’s cufflinks are a mystery. He traveled all over the world, visiting every continent and many many countries. He loved photography and mostly documented his journeys there but would also occasionally buy small things that spoke to him. (I actually made a coffee table book of his travel photography - when he passed he had more than 3500 photos of trips between 1956-2024). These don’t have any identifying marks but to me the design looks vaguely Tibetan or Nepalese. He climbed to the base camp of Everest in 1998, when he was 68, so I could see him purchasing something in Nepal to commemorate the experience. I know he also went to east Asia multiple times between 1955-2015. It would be amazing if these were part of his travel heritage! 

4. I think two of the rings may have been my great grandmother’s because of how small they are. My grandmother and I have the same ring sizes and these only fit on my pinky fingers. Anything you can discover about these, particularly ideas about dates, would be amazing!

**Maximizing Profits: Insider Tips for Successful Real Estate Flipping**

In the unforgiving arena of real estate, every decision carries the weight of destiny. Each property isn’t just a structure—it’s a tale waiting to be told, a catalyst for transformation. Step into the world of flipping homes, and awaken the entrepreneur within. Your fortune lies in the whispers of those who dared to leap.

**Know Thy Market**

Before you hatch your plan, immerse yourself in the pulse of your chosen neighborhood. This isn’t just analytics; it’s about feeling the energy. Research the trends. Know the schools, the parks, the coffee shops. Understand what draws people in and what sends them running. This knowledge is your sword and shield.

**Master the Art of Timing**

The clock is your fiercest competitor. Timing isn’t just important; it’s everything. Buy when others are hesitant, and sell when the market sizzles. Seek out the hidden gems in offseason markets. Those who hustle now will reap rewards later. It’s a divine rhythm; align your actions with the universe.

**Calculate Like a Pro**

Numbers may seem cold, but they’re the heartbeat of your success. Master your margins: purchase price, renovation costs, and selling price. Factor in contingencies. Know the cost of each brushstroke and every nail. Your budget is sacred; don’t let emotions steer your ship. Keep your focus laser-sharp on the bottom line, and let the numbers guide you.

**The Power of First Impressions**

Transformations begin at the door. Curb appeal isn’t just aesthetics; it’s magnetism. Paint, landscaping, and staging—all scream “welcome.” Create a first impression that resonates in the hearts of potential buyers. They won’t just see the house; they’ll feel at home. Evoke emotions, stir desire, and watch as they fall in love.

**Strategic Renovations**

Invest wisely in upgrades that matter. Kitchens and bathrooms are holy ground in real estate. Spend your renovation dollars where they will yield the greatest return. Items like modern fixtures and energy-efficient windows don’t just enhance beauty; they create value that is palpable. Each choice, each detail must scream quality.

**Network Like the Wind**

Connections are pulse points in this grand tapestry of flipping. Surround yourself with agents, contractors, and fellow investors. Share insights, forge alliances, and broaden horizons. Seek mentors—those who have walked the path before you. Their wisdom will illuminate your way. Together, you are stronger, and together, you can conquer.

**Market Smart**

In the digital age, your marketing is your megaphone. Use captivating photos and engaging narratives that draw buyers in. Social media is your ally—harness it to tell your story. Go where the buyers are. Utilize virtual tours and open houses. Create a buzz that’s electric and undeniable. Let them feel the urgency. Let them crave it.

**The Art of Negotiation**

Words can heal, and words can harm. Negotiation is an art form—wield it like a brush to craft your masterpiece. Be firm but fair. Listen intently, and understand the motivations of your counterparty. This is a dance, not a brawl. Seek win-win outcomes where mutual respect reigns, and watch as doors swing wide open.

**Reflect and Learn**

Every flip is a sermon, a lesson etched into your soul. Reflect on victories and defeats alike. Celebrate what you did well, but don’t shy away from failures. Analyze each step. Learning is your alchemy, turning experience into wisdom. This journey is spiritual—rooted in growth, resilience, and transformation.

**Cultivate the Right Mindset**

In real estate, doubt can creep like a thief in the night. Cultivate an unwavering mentality. Embrace risk, for fear is a prison. Ignite your inner fire—believe in your vision and your ability to manifest it. Surround yourself with positivity, and let it fuel your passion. Every setback is simply a setup for a comeback.

Now is your moment. The room is charged with potential. Roll up your sleeves and dive into the world of real estate flipping. Armed with knowledge, grit, and faith, you are poised for greatness. The profits await those who dare, those who execute with passion and precision. This is your calling; heed the whisper of possibility and let it resonate through every decision, every action. Your success is not just a goal; it’s a transformation. Rise and claim it.

1lty0gp,https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningCirclejerk/comments/1lty0gp/my_dad_is_a_running_maniac/,My dad is a running maniac.,"Half the house is crammed with running shoes, empty GU packets in drawers, medal racks sagging from local 5Ks and marathons no one’s heard of. He’s got screenshots of his Garmin Connect stats printed out and pinned on the wall including his resting HR 41 bpm and the time ran a 5K in 19:58 - it’s a damn hazard zone. At least once a month someone steps on a carbon plate or spikes and ends up in urgent care because ""they’re not supposed to bend that way"". I’m 22 and I’ve had more tetanus shots than birthdays. Last week I went in for a routine checkup and the nurse at the front desk just looked at me and said: ""Shoe off, let’s see the foot"" because she assumed I’d impaled myself on another prototype.

 The other half of the house is buried in Runner’s World, Trail Runner Magazine, Marathon & Beyond, and God knows what else. Every Sunday, my dad does a full sweep of every Barnes & Noble and gas station in town to collect the latest magazines. I was dumb enough to teach him how to use the internet, thinking we’d save money on subscriptions. Now he buys the magazines AND spends six hours a day on running forums, arguing with strangers about lactate thresholds and whether HOKAs are for ""real runners"". He screams at the monitor, slams his fists on the desk, and once threw a keyboard out the window because someone said tempo runs are overrated.

 One time he pissed me off so bad I made a new account and trolled him on his favorite forum by posting stuff like: ""Running is just walking with commitment issues."" My mom had to make an emergency batch of oatmeal with chia seeds to calm him down. Oh, and he’s got forum rank ""ULTRA LEGEND"" for hitting 10,000 posts. I wish I were joking.

 When it’s warm out, he races every weekend. For the past five years, I’ve eaten spaghetti with olive oil every sunday because ""we’re carb-loading as a family"". When I got into college, he spent a week telling everyone it was because I ate enough omega-3s and my brain was ""firing on all cylinders"".

 Every saturday at 4 a.m., he and his buddy Mike wake up the whole house packing hydration vests, gels, and compression socks. At breakfast, he always brings up running, and somehow it always spirals into a rant about USATF. He gets red in the face, slams his coffee, and storms off to read Daniels' Running Formula to cool down.

 This year, he bought himself a $3,000 treadmill for Christmas. In June. He said ""street running is bullshit for VOMax and smog kills mitochondria"". Couldn’t wait till the 25^(th) of December, set it up in the living room, and spent the whole day running in full race kit with his last marathon bib pinned to his shirt. Ate dinner (grilled salmon and quinoa) on the treadmill. Didn’t even slow down. After this he slept in calf sleeves for ""full recovery overnight"". If only you could see how his treadmill got fucked up from running on it all the time. And that was after the warranty period.

 For my 7th birthday he ""gifted"" me a trail run with him. We drove two hours into the middle of nowhere. He was practically drooling with excitement. Set up his gear like he was prepping for UTMB. Five minutes in, I got bored and put on my headphones. He smacked me with a trekking pole and said the music was ""disrupting the cadence"". I scratched my leg and he hissed: ""Don't ever do that again. When you scratch, your skin's blood supply changes, which causes Strava stats to drop"". I had to run in silence for six hours, staring at trees like I was in some kind of mindfulness prison camp.

 He used to run with this guy Jeff - looked like a bowling ball with a mustache, wore a hydration vest 365 days a year. They were inseparable. Jeff and his wife even came to our Christmas dinners. One time they got drunk at my dad’s birthday and started screaming at each other about whether marathons or ultras were superior.

""DON’T PISS ME OFF, JEFF. YOU EVER HIT THE WALL AT MILE 22? THAT’S WHERE MEN ARE MADE.""

""BULLSHIT, TED. ULTRAS ARE WHERE THE REAL MENTAL GAME STARTS. YOUR MARATHON IS A WARM-UP.""

 ""YOU CAN’T EVEN FINISH A 10K WITHOUT CRAMPING, JEFF. MARATHON IS THE KING OF THE RUNS.""

 They ended up wrestling on the carpet while my mom and I tried to pull them apart. Haven’t spoken since. When Jeff died last year, his wife called to invite us to the funeral. My mom answered, gave her condolences, hung up, and told my dad. He just said: ""Good. Screw him and his stupid trail shoes.""

 My dad’s mortal enemy is the USATF. He thinks they’re a corrupt cabal of bureaucrats ruining American running. If there’s an earthquake on the news, he mutters: ""Still no exposé on those bastards at USATF."" He stopped reading regular newspapers because ""they don’t cover the real scandals"".

 But his archnemesis is this dude named Adam from the ""Sunset Striders"" (the local running club) who stole his KOM on a steep hill near the high school. Ever since then, it is been open war. Once my dad went to local running meet where Adam gave a talk on lactate threshold and my dad came back with his longsleev torn because they physically removed him for yelling: ""CHEATER! HE USES E-BIKE STRIDES!"" After that, he launched a digital guerrilla war posting on Reddit running threads, Facebook groups and even on Strava itself that Adam was a former KGB agent or that he snorting magnesium before a tempo run. Got sued for defamation and had to pay $500.

 He lost it - for a week straight he stomped around the house ranting about how Strava is controlled by elites and the running world is run by a Garmin-backed cabal. He kept yelling stuff like: ""Adam is probably sponsored by Big Sock. I bet he is got shares in Hoka."" And he kept calculating what he could’ve bought for 500$ - two pairs of Altras, a new Stryd footpod, entry to three Boston qualifiers and still have money left for Tailwind powder.

 Last year, he and some guys from the club went in on a shared treadmill because my dad couldn’t afford it again. It was stored in some guy’s garage. They’d share it, schedule runs via Google Calendar, sync it to Zwift and analyze their cadence together. One weekend, my dad got injured and couldn’t run. The others used the treadmill without him and posted their workouts on Strava. Adam gave them all kudos. He was furious. Lay on the couch all day, red with rage, muttering about betrayal and ranting that his treadmill VO data would be inaccurate now for WEEKS. Sunday night, he disappeared. An hour later, he comes back and says: ""Help me with something outside"". I go out and there’s our car… with the treadmill strapped to the roof. I ask where he got it. He says he ""liberated it” from the guy’s garage because ""they betrayed the pact"" and start muttering something about ""Strava socialism is theft"". Tried to bring it inside, but it wouldn’t fit through the door. So he chained it to a streetlamp with my old bike lock and declares that he is going to run outdoors on it like ""a real ultra guy in the elements"".

Then the other guys showed up. Two cars full of angry runners.

They’re yelling: ""Give it back!""

My dad’s yelling: ""I paid my share!""

One guy tries to grab the treadmill and my dad kicks him in the face with his carbon-plated Saucony Endorphins. Cops show up. My mom’s crying. I’m just standing there with my arms crossed, regretting everything.

 Eventually, the cops let him go. The guys took the treadmill back and threw $500 at him, saying: ""You’re out. Don’t ever show up at a race again. You are no longer part of the data set."" The guy with the bloody nose says next time he will bring his coach, not the cops.

 Since then, my dad has been posting under fake accounts on Strava Facebook group trying to clear his name especially under posts where people warned not to run with him. I watched him make burner accounts like:

RunnerDad54 

Posts: 1 

""This thread is full of lies! I’ve known UltraTed for years and he’s a kind, generous, elite-level athlete!""

 Then he’d use the same accounts to trash talk the other guys: ""Nice 10K time, loser. My grandma negative splits better than that.""

 He even replies to his own posts like: ""Wow, amazing race report! You’re such an inspiration!"", ""Sub-8 pace at your age?!? GOAT"".

 Then he calls me and my mom over to read the compliments out loud.

 I promised myself I’d never be like my father. Unfortunately, after my last running date, I knew the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. I'm deleting Tinder for now. I'll wait until winter, we'll see which girls aren't afraid of a light run in sub-zero temperatures. I'll let you know how it goes. For now, I have to give my dad a like on his posts on r/Garmin.

bruh is it just me or do y'all also ever plan your whole day down to the hour… and then just, like, not do any of it?

Yeah, that’s me. Like, well all the time. Like my schedule goes like -I’ll wake up, open my laptop, throw on some god music music, sip my coffee, and start planning what feels like the ""perfect"" day. Like doing everything it takes from using Google Calendar open, Apple Notes on the side, sticky notes in pastel colors (yes I highlight stuff ,it looks pretty, okay). Like my mindset- yea to lock in completely. Even adding things like Walk + Podcast hahaha. Ill tell y'all how my days looks like in my notes app.
9AM: Journaling
10AM: Breakast + studying
11:30AM: Small break
12:30PM: back to studying
2PM: listen to a podcast
3PM: have lunch
4:30PM: small break 
etc. etc.etc.

…so basically, I’m curating a wellness influencer feed. For myself. But well am i being able to manage it? Well you might have guessed it right- NO!!! Like all this scheduling for nothing and then suddenly it’s 6PM and I’ve accomplished absolutely nothing from my to-do-list. I’m still in bed, rewatching reels or yt shorts that I’ve alreadyseen before probably, spiraling into that guilt again of wating my entire day.

It’s not even about motivation anymore. I do want to do stuff. But I just freeze. Sometimes it’s my poor lack od focus and decision, fatigue, sometimes it’s just vibes. But the result is the same: nothing gets done. I was so annoyed that i used to watch alot of yr vids and take notes from the apps which might help fix my productivity. I dint even care at that point that were these people actually recommending good apps or njust advertising for a paid promo. But yea i end up in the loop of installing and ininstalling alot of apps. But in the way, i did also find some genuine apps that did help me fix my schedule a little. Not saying that oh, it completely changed my kife completely or turned it upside down but yea it did help to some extent. Sharing these for people like me, who might need or is looking for apps that can help in any way, the don't worry, i gotchu. 

If you want to plan you day then you can use notion, its very effective. You can use it for your personal work or maybe for your work purpose. But that will make you feel like you are tacking your day and checking off tasks off the day would feel genyuine.

 Another one was Jolt app, don't even get me started about how my poor time management was majorly cuz of high screen time, so  i knew i had to cut it down, i downloaded alot of apps but this worked the best for me because it wasn't too direct or harsh with the blocking, plus i liked how it reminded qith gentle reminders because i do get offended when apps send reminders where it feels like they are personally attacking me, so this wan kinda was better in that way. 

Todoist is also good app when you wan manage your tasks or do stuffs and create tasks u can easily set due dates and assign it priority wise. Students as well as working professionals could use it.

Then there was another app Lifestack , this also did help me (lowkey did solve half of my probs) as my major concern was not able to do any tasks because i ended up just doomsrolling, but it connects to your google devices or watches that track your energy levels. So u can just prioritize your day based on how fried your brain is atm and then take rests whenever without wasting your time or feeling guilty. Thank me later. 

Then there is another tool, google calendar which already might be in your phone pre-installed, you can also use that to plan your important tasks prior and then mark as done. Also useful for if you wan use it for remembering imp dates be it b'day or a meeting/assignment to be done.

and before anyone comes at me I’m genuinely just sharing these because they’ve helped me, and I know someone else out there is probably stuck in the same chaotic loop.Please don’t turn this into some “you're promoting apps” thread. I’m not. I'm tired, you’re tired, we’re all just trying to function. 😩

If anyone else has apps that actually helped, or if you’ve used any of these and felt the same, so drop your reviews, hacks, whatever. Or just relate. That’s cool too. Let’s keep it real here.

I’m currently exploring upgrading my Bambino that I’ve had for about 3 years now. I make 2-4 drinks a day. Usually an espresso for myself and cortado for my wife.

My wife tends to stay in the medium-dark roast range.
I want more control over temp to venture into lighter roasted coffees.

I currently have a DF54 grinder as well as a JX-Pro. 

I’m kind of lost on where to go from here. The value and convenience is amazing from the bambino and honestly there’s no real complaints besides the temp control. 

Would it make sense to just go for a gaggia with pid and gaggimate/gaggiuno? I would also entertain the idea of a lever machine since I will be the only one drinking lighter roasts.

Would love to hear the thoughts.

I firmly said no thanks, and he walked in the opposite direction. Suddenly he was walking towards me at the entrance on Myrtle Street, before walking up a road opposite and staring at me from around the corner.

1ltxwft,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ltxwft,"2nd visit - Orso | Torino, Italy","I had to make one more stop at this joint before I left Torino. Partied all night, and woke up quite late. However, I had a mission to complete: barolos and beans. Taxis are impossible in this city at this time due to a major event. However, uber bikes are plentiful, and it’s a beautiful way to get around the city.

The first mission was swiftly accomplished. I scored some gold from Alba and a jar of truffled anchovies. I was running out of time, but I still needed to grab the Nester Lasso. As I pulled up and grabbed a bag I thought, “Why not grab a cup, too?!”  

Unwise. The two lady operation was a one woman operation, today. I went with the Colombia Maypop, Finca Milan. Watching this lady simultaneously make several espressos while skillfully tending to my pour over was nothing short of amazing. The results were not surprising, it was a delicious cup.

I only made it through half my cup, and I realized I was late for my train. As in, no chance. I pedaled through the city like a mad man. Cutting through alleys and weaving through traffic like the Italian Job. I had a car already waiting for me at my apartment, but I needed to finish packing… There’s a strike in France impacting travel across Europe, so although I was late I still had a chance. My driver took dropped me off with a minute to spare. I ran to the gate, but my ticket wouldn’t work. A gentleman looked at my ticket and informed me that I was at Porto Nuovo. My ticket was for Porto Susa…

I hopped into taxi. Upon arrival, I booked the last seat on the last train to Paris. Then, something rather pungent caught my nose. I looked down and saw that my jar of truffled anchovies broke all over my Barolos and my luggage 🤢. It’s 85 F. 

I know, cool story bro… Was it worth it? When I first visited Italy, it was for the espresso culture (and the truffles). I loved it, but always thought it was a country too rooted in tradition to really shine with third wave coffee. Orso changed my mind. I shouldn’t have bought the sardines. I shouldn’t have had the cup. But, I have no regrets. Plus, it gave me time for an espresso from Caffé D’Acaja!",3,1751903859.0,coffeerotation,0,1.0,False

We’ve been dating for two years. We’re both 24. Admittedly, I’ve been very busy starting a professional career. When our relationship started I was taking a bit of a professional LOA to handle my grandfather’s estate and to clean up/renovate/sell his house. I only bring this up because later on in the message I mention John and I can anticipate a lot of people asking if my job making me busy and unavailable is the reason she was flirting and straying - every spare moment I wasn’t working on that house when our relationship started, concurrent to John I was with her at LEAST 5 days a week including sleepovers all week etc. 

FFW to today, though. My girlfriend asked me to drop off some of her belongings at her parent’s house after a weekend together. She had her notebook out wherein (and spare me the moral dilemma of this being okay or not, because I know it wasn’t right to snoop) I found pages where she describes this coworker of hers at her coffee shop that makes her feel “conflicted” and who constantly finds ways to disrespect me in juvenile ways by suggesting we shouldn’t be in a relationship for reasons as stupid as “we don’t have the same taste in music” because I wasn’t keen to go to a Mannequin Pussy concert. Suggesting that if they dated they’d at least have the same music taste in common and telling her how beautiful he finds her, which she seems to just enjoy and let happen and internalize. For what it’s worth, we have a very similar taste in music and in fact I’ve paid for and taken her to see many acts we both enjoy. Her not pointing that out is indicative to me that she didn’t care / was just enjoying the attention from him even if that involved denigrating me. 

Why would someone who supposedly genuinely cares about me, respects me or values our relationship let some nobody at their serving job shit on me like this!??

I’m fucking furious. This isn’t the first time she’s entertained other men whose only goal was to hook up with her. She has plenty of guy friends that are normal and do not have bad intentions, but the ones that do she consistently will apologize for, and give the benefit of the doubt to even when she knows she’s overstepping the bounds of our relationship. 

Just yesterday morning, she told me she was upset by the fact the original one of these men, John, contacted her after breaking up with the girlfriend he’s had for the past year or so. So these feelings have been thrust in my face twice in 24 hours. She entertained and flirted with him over text for months. I was aware the entire time and would repeatedly express that it was absolutely not OK and that he needed to be blocked, but that she was too busy and scatterbrained bc of her life to do so immediately, but assured me the contact would stop. 

This became almost a parasocial relationship between her and him where she would secretly pine and drive past his house and see if he was home - completely mentally ill shit. Parasocial is probably the wrong word, but the obsession on her end was deeper than he realized, for sure. She was kind of just old reliable - evidenced by the fact my gf was his first text out of his relationship. 

The whole time she would deny the nature of the relationship and say that they were merely friends - and that they had no history (they did) - or failing that that she was trying to give him the benefit of the doubt, and that his intentions were pure. She only admitted that I was gaslit over the entire thing this past January when she started taking psychiatric meds. 

I’ve been going to therapy to try and untangle all of this shit for the past four months or so after attempts to do it all myself didn’t work. I cannot bring myself to reconcile this shit. It’s genuinely too much for me to bear and has had a huge impact on my mental health and this latest thing has broken me. I see this as a never ending game of whack a mole.

1ltxv0p,https://i.redd.it/sm518y0d5hbf1.png,[OC] Support for MCDM monsters has been added to the Redcap Press Encounter Builder!,"Hey everybody!

I run a site that includes (among other things) a tool for balancing combat encounters. It supports our published monsters as well as everything in the Monster Manual and a few other official 5e books, as well as everything in Kobold Press's Creature Codex and Tomes of Beast.  Now it also supports MCDM's monsters!

Link to the tool: www.redcap.press/encounters

Aside from just adding the new monsters as options, we've added a few extra handy features as part of this update:
- You can filter monsters by their ""Role,"" as defined by MCDM: Minion, Brute, Companion, etc.
- Our filter for special monster traits has been expanded to include an option for ""Action-Oriented"" monsters.
- If you want to look at only the monsters relevant to an adventure from the ""Where Evil Lives"" book, searching the name of the adventure will bring up only the monsters that it contains.

More importantly, we've also added a toggle to swap from the official 5e encounter balancing rules to MCDM's recommended method. It does all the math for you, handling the CR budget calculation, minions, retainers, etc. Just throw your party details in and start spending your CR budget. The tool has MCDM-specific recommendations baked in, so if you go against MCDM's guidelines in any way the tool will let you know.

Enjoy, and thanks for checking it out! The site is free to use and free from ads; this is just meant as a useful tool to share with the community. It's also brand new and some of the MCDM-specific changes were pretty different from how it worked before, so please reach out if you find any bugs!

We've got a few other fun features coming soon that I'm pretty excited about, and one particularly fun one that's specific to MCDM. If you want to stay in the loop with additions to the encounter builder or anything else by Redcap Press, follow us on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/redcap.press) to stay in the loop.

I sat in the plush leather chair of Sean's law office, my body still aching from the miscarriage three days ago. The cramping hadn't stopped completely. Neither had the bleeding. The doctor had advised bed rest, but Sean's lawyer had made it clear—today was non-negotiable.

""Mrs. Harrington, please sign here... and here."" The lawyer's voice was clinically detached as he slid the divorce papers across the polished mahogany table. His finger tapped impatiently at each yellow tab.

I couldn't look at Sean. In the ten years we'd been married, I'd memorized every expression that crossed his face. Today, I couldn't bear to see which one he wore—contempt, perhaps, or worse, nothing at all.

Instead, my gaze drifted to Natalie Benson, perched beside him like a bird of prey. Her red-lacquered nails rested possessively on his forearm, her diamond bracelet catching the light. My bracelet. The one Sean had given me on our fifth anniversary.

""June."" Sean's voice finally broke the silence. Cold. Distant. A stranger's voice. ""The sooner you sign, the sooner we can all move on.""

The lawyer cleared his throat. ""I should remind you, Mrs. Harrington, that should you choose not to sign today, Mr. Harrington is prepared to contest any custody arrangements for future children and—""

""Future children?"" The words escaped me before I could stop them. My hand instinctively went to my abdomen, still tender from the loss. ""I just lost our baby.""

Natalie's lips curled into a smile that never reached her eyes. ""Well, that simplifies things, doesn't it?""

Sean didn't even flinch at her cruelty. He just stared at his watch, as if my grief were an inconvenience, a meeting running overtime.

""Sign the papers, June,"" he said flatly. ""Or you'll leave with nothing.""

My hands trembled as I picked up the pen. Each signature felt like another piece of myself being carved away. With the final stroke, ten years of marriage—of loving Sean, of building a life with him, of sacrificing everything I'd ever wanted—was reduced to a stack of legal documents.

The drive back to our apartment—no, Sean's apartment now—was a blur of rain-slicked streets and blurry traffic lights. My chest felt hollow, as if something vital had been scooped out.

When I reached the door, my key still worked. Small mercies.

But inside, everything had changed.

The closet in our bedroom stood open, emptied of my clothes. The bookshelves had been purged of my novels and textbooks. Even the photographs had been removed from their frames, leaving ghostly rectangles on the walls where our memories had once hung.

In the living room, cardboard boxes were stacked neatly, labeled in a handwriting I didn't recognize. ""June's Things."" ""Kitchen—June's."" ""Miscellaneous.""

A note sat on the kitchen counter, Sean's precise handwriting unmistakable:

\*June,

The movers will collect these boxes tomorrow. You have until noon to vacate the premises. Your access to our joint accounts has been temporarily suspended pending the finalization of our divorce.

—Sean\*

No goodbye. No acknowledgment of our decade together. Just logistics.

A soft knock at the door startled me. When I opened it, Mrs. Chen from across the hall stood there, her kind face creased with concern.

""I saw the movers earlier,"" she said softly. ""They left these by the door."" She held out a pair of worn ballet flats—my favorite shoes for padding around the apartment on Sunday mornings.

That night, I sat on the bathroom floor, the cool tiles pressing against my legs. The bottle of sleeping pills Sean had gotten prescribed for his insomnia sat in my palm. How many would it take? Would it hurt?

""June?""

The voice was so achingly familiar that for a moment, I thought I'd imagined it. But when I looked up, he was there in the doorway—Sean. Not the Sean who had sat across from me in that sterile law office, but Sean as he had been when we first met. Eighteen years old, with warm eyes that crinkled at the corners when he smiled. Hair slightly too long, falling across his forehead in that way that had made my heart stumble the first time I saw him.

""Sean?"" My voice cracked.

He knelt beside me, and when his hand touched mine, it was warm but somehow not quite solid—like touching sunlight through a window.

""What are you doing?"" he asked gently, his eyes fixed on the pill bottle in my hand.

Chapter 2

Morning came with cruel persistence. I hadn't slept—not really. The pills remained uncapped beside me, a temptation I'd resisted only because of him. Because of young Sean, whose impossible presence had somehow anchored me through the darkest hours.

I dragged myself to the bus stop, my belongings stuffed into a single suitcase. Mrs. Chen had offered her couch, but pride—the last thing I owned that Sean couldn't take—made me refuse.

The bus lurched forward, and I clutched my phone, scrolling through credit card applications. Each rejection notification felt like another door slamming shut. \*Insufficient credit history. Application denied. Unable to verify income.\*

'They're making a mistake,' came a soft voice beside me.

I looked up to find young Sean sitting there, his eyes warm with concern. In the harsh morning light, he seemed more substantial than he had in the bathroom darkness, yet still somehow ethereal—like a photograph coming to life.

'What are you?' I whispered, earning a concerned glance from an elderly woman across the aisle.

He smiled that crooked smile I'd fallen for a lifetime ago. 'I'm here because you need me to be.'

His hand covered mine as another rejection flashed across my screen. Though I couldn't truly feel his touch, something warm spread through my fingers. I bit my lip hard, fighting back tears that threatened to humiliate me further in this bus full of strangers.

'You'll figure this out,' he said quietly. 'You always do.'

The bus jolted to a stop, and when I looked again, the seat beside me was empty.

\---

'You came!' Sarah Evans exclaimed, her surprise poorly concealed as she air-kissed my cheeks at the law firm's holiday party entrance. 'I wasn't sure if you'd... well, you know.'

I smoothed down the borrowed dress—a castoff from Mrs. Chen's daughter. Too tight across the chest, too loose at the waist, but it was black and unremarkable. Perfect for disappearing.

'I appreciate the invitation,' I lied, scanning the room for Sean. This was madness, coming here. But I needed to speak with him about the accounts. About the future. About anything that might give me closure.

The party hummed with expensive conversation and tinkling crystal. I sipped champagne that tasted like ashes, nodding at former friends who suddenly found the appetizer table fascinating when they spotted me.

David Miller, the managing partner, tapped his glass for attention. 'If I could have everyone's moment, please! We have something special to celebrate tonight.'

The crowd parted, and there they were—Sean and Natalie, her arm possessively wound through his. She wore red, vibrant as a fresh wound against the sea of conservative black and navy suits.

'To new beginnings,' David continued, raising his glass. 'And to the future Mr. and Mrs. Harrington!'

The room erupted in applause. My champagne glass froze halfway to my lips.

'And because a picture is worth a thousand words,' Natalie's voice cut through the congratulations, 'we've prepared a little slideshow of our journey.'

The lights dimmed. The projector flickered to life on the wall behind them.

And there I was—pale, hollow-eyed, curled in a hospital bed. The date stamp showed three days ago. My miscarriage. My private agony, projected six feet tall for everyone to see.

'Oops,' Natalie giggled, feigning embarrassment as gasps rippled through the crowd. 'Wrong folder!'

The room spun. Faces blurred into masks of horror and morbid fascination. I stumbled backward, knocking into a waiter, sending a tray of glasses crashing to the floor.

The shattering sound broke whatever spell had frozen me in place. I fled.

\---

'Sean!' I called out, my voice echoing in the parking garage beneath his firm the next morning. He was walking toward his car, briefcase in hand.

He turned slowly, his face a perfect mask of indifference. 'June. You shouldn't be here.'

'The accounts,' I said, my breath forming small clouds in the December air. 'They're empty. All of them.'

'Yes.' No explanation. No apology.

'How am I supposed to—'

'You should check your credit report,' he interrupted coolly. 'The mortgage, the car loans, your student debt—they're all in your name now.'

The ground seemed to tilt beneath me. 'You can't do that.'

'It's already done.' He checked his watch. 'Anything else?'

A sleek black limousine pulled up behind him, its tinted window rolling down to reveal Natalie's smirking face.

'Sean,' I whispered, searching for any flicker of the man I'd married. 'Why?'

He turned away without answering, sliding into the limo beside her. As they pulled away, I caught a final glimpse of Natalie's triumphant smile through the darkened glass.

Standing alone in the cold garage, I realized with sudden clarity that the man I'd loved was truly gone. And in his place was someone I no longer recognized—someone capable of destroying me without a second thought.

Chapter 3

I stared at the ceiling of Chris's spare bedroom, watching the shadows from passing cars slide across the cracked plaster. The mattress smelled faintly of mothballs and something else—a lingering scent of my brother's military life, perhaps. After the parking garage confrontation with Sean, I'd had nowhere else to go. My credit cards were maxed out, my accounts emptied, and my name was now attached to debts I hadn't even known existed.

""You can stay as long as you need,"" Chris had said when I showed up at his door, suitcase in hand, eyes swollen from crying. His apartment was small—a one-bedroom converted to two by adding a wall that didn't quite reach the ceiling—but it was clean and warm. Military precision evident in the perfectly made bed, the precisely aligned shoes by the door.

I rolled onto my side, wincing at the hollow ache that still lingered in my abdomen. The physical reminder of everything I'd lost.

""Hey, you up?"" Chris's voice came softly through the thin door. When I didn't answer, he pushed it open anyway, his wheelchair barely fitting through the narrow frame. ""Brought you something.""

He wheeled over to the bed and handed me a battered leather journal. The cover was worn smooth at the corners, the pages yellowed with age.

""What's this?"" I asked, running my fingers over the soft leather.

""My therapist gave it to me when I came back from Afghanistan. Said writing down the next steps, no matter how small, helped make the impossible seem possible."" His eyes, so like mine, held no pity—just quiet understanding. ""Thought you might need it more than I do now.""

I clutched the journal to my chest, tears threatening again. ""I don't know what the next steps even are, Chris.""

He gestured to the wall behind me, where his service medals hung in a simple frame. ""When they first put me in this chair, I couldn't see past the next hour, let alone the next day. But you keep going. One step, then another.""

He reached out and squeezed my hand. ""You'll rebuild, June. And I'll help you.""

\---

The nonprofit where I'd worked before my marriage to Sean was housed in a converted Victorian in Capitol Hill. I'd spent three happy years there before leaving to support Sean's career move to New York. Now, back in Seattle with nothing but desperation, I hoped they might remember me fondly.

""June Parker!"" Maria Sanchez exclaimed when I walked into her office. ""Or is it Harrington now?""

""Parker,"" I said firmly. ""It's Parker again.""

Maria's warm brown eyes softened with understanding. She'd been my supervisor years ago, and time had added silver to her dark hair but hadn't diminished her kind smile.

""Well, Ms. Parker, your timing is impeccable. We just got funding for a new community outreach position. The pay isn't spectacular, but—""

""I'll take it,"" I interrupted, then flushed. ""I mean, I'd like to apply. If that's possible.""

She laughed. ""Let's start with an interview, at least. How's tomorrow?""

I left feeling lighter than I had in weeks. The next day, I wore my only remaining professional outfit—a navy skirt suit I'd managed to grab before the movers came—and answered Maria's questions with growing confidence. By the end, her smile told me everything I needed to know.

""We'll be in touch very soon,"" she promised, walking me to the door.

Three days later, a terse email arrived:

\*Dear Ms. Parker,\*

\*Thank you for your interest in our Community Outreach Coordinator position. After careful consideration, we have decided to pursue other candidates whose qualifications better align with our current needs.\*

\*We wish you the best in your future endeavors.\*

I stared at my phone in disbelief. The interview had gone perfectly. Maria had all but offered me the job on the spot.

Before I could stop myself, I was dialing her number.

""June,"" Maria answered, her voice tight. ""I was hoping you'd call.""

""What happened?"" I asked, struggling to keep my voice steady.

A long pause. Then: ""I shouldn't be telling you this, but... Natalie Benson called our executive director yesterday. Sean's firm is our biggest donor, and she made it clear that if we hired you, they would withdraw their support.""

The phone nearly slipped from my suddenly numb fingers. ""She did what?""

""I'm so sorry, June. We can't lose that funding—we'd have to close our doors.""

After we hung up, I sat on Chris's fire escape, watching the sun sink behind the Seattle skyline. The metal was cold through my thin pants, but I barely noticed. First my marriage, then my home, my financial security, and now even the chance to work—all systematically stripped away.

""Beautiful, isn't it?""

I turned to find young Sean sitting beside me, his legs dangling over the edge of the fire escape. In the fading light, he looked almost solid.

""Do you remember our first date?"" he asked, his eyes reflecting the deepening twilight.

""The coffee shop near campus,"" I whispered. ""You spilled your latte all over my economics textbook.""

He smiled, and suddenly I wasn't on the fire escape anymore but sitting in that crowded university café, watching eighteen-year-old Sean frantically blot at my ruined book with napkins, his face flushed with embarrassment.

""I'll buy you a new one,"" he was promising, his eyes—so warm then, so full of life—meeting mine across the table.

The memory shifted, and we were dancing in the spring rain on the empty quad, my sundress plastered to my skin, his laughter echoing across the deserted campus.

Then we were lying on a blanket in the darkness outside Madison, watching the Perseid meteor shower streak across the summer sky. ""Someday,"" he whispered, taking my hand, ""I'm going to give you the world, June Parker.""

The memories faded, leaving me alone on the cold fire escape, tears streaming down my face. The contrast between those cherished moments and my current reality was almost too painful to bear.

""Why are you showing me this?"" I asked the empty air where young Sean had been.

But there was no answer, only the distant sound of traffic and the hollow ache of everything I'd lost.

Chapter 4

The shrill ping of my phone jolted me from my fitful sleep. Three a.m. An unknown number. My thumb hovered over the ignore button, but something made me open the message.

My stomach dropped as I stared at the screen. There, illuminated in the darkness of Chris's spare bedroom, were photos I'd never

I run a site that includes (among other things) a tool for balancing combat encounters. It supports our published monsters as well as everything in the Monster Manual and a few other official 5e books, as well as everything in Kobold Press's Creature Codex and Tomes of Beast.  Now it also supports MCDM's monsters!

Link to the tool: www.redcap.press/encounters

Aside from just adding the new monsters as options, we've added a few extra handy features as part of this update:
- You can filter monsters by their ""Role,"" as defined by MCDM: Minion, Brute, Companion, etc.
- Our filter for special monster traits has been expanded to include an option for ""Action-Oriented"" monsters.
- If you want to look at only the monsters relevant to an adventure from the ""Where Evil Lives"" book, searching the name of the adventure will bring up only the monsters that it contains.

More importantly, we've also added a toggle to swap from the official 5e encounter balancing rules to MCDM's recommended method. It does all the math for you, handling the CR budget calculation, minions, retainers, etc. Just throw your party details in and start spending your CR budget. The tool has MCDM-specific recommendations baked in, so if you go against MCDM's guidelines in any way the tool will let you know.

Enjoy, and thanks for checking it out! The site is free to use and free from ads; this is just meant as a useful tool to share with the community. It's also brand new and some of the MCDM-specific changes were pretty different from how it worked before, so please reach out if you find any bugs!

We have alot of communication issues and I'm noticing more and more he is growing distant.  We recently just moved in to a basement of a house to save money. Along the move, I realized he was only focused on getting his stuff in and set up and he wasn't really concerned about moving my stuff. We have a small closet in our bedroom. He completely filled up the closet with no room for my stuff or even asking me if he can do it. When we had to go back and clean the apartment after all our stuff was out. He complained that he doesn't think the apartment deserves all this cleaning because he didnt like the neighborhood or living there. While I was cleaning, he kept playing with his phone, waisting time cause he didnt want to clean. The thing is he didnt care cause I moved in first and it's my deposit, not his. So of course he didnt care. This morning he got up for work and I heard him say ""shut the fuck up to my dog"" cause my dog likes to chase the cat in the morning. I went to the bathroom while he was drinking coffee and I heard him talking to himself. He was venting to himself under his breath complaining about me about how I do things and I make no sense and how what I do is stupid. I couldn't hear the rest but he wasn't letting things out about a hard conversation we had yesterday. Its another long story. I know he won't come to me and tell me his feelings on hard subjects. He keeps it inside and then I hear it as he's mumbling about me and our relationship in the kitchen. He wants to get married because we've almost been together for 2 years and he says it's because he's 39 and it's time for him to get married. But our relationship isnt great right now. Why would someone want to get married if the relationship we have right now is rocky? He has mentioned several times he doesn't want to be single at 40. I don't think thats a reason to marry someone. I don't want to married at 39 and have a bad marriage. It doesn't make sense to me. Apart of me thinks he wants to get married because he would have health insurance and other perks of getting married. Its a long story and it's complicated.

Week One - slept a lot. I love a nap anyway, but sometimes it was the only solution to not ordering drinks to be delivered. Ate a lot of ice cream, and everything else. Sobriety fatigue hit me in week one this time around.

Week Two - still tired. Still some sobriety fatigue. Mornings are easier. I’ve never been a morning person, but after a coffee, I was ok. Not being hungover makes a huge difference. Father’s Day fell on this Sunday and luckily as we had a little with us no one drank at the restaurant making it easier!

Week Three - the Monday I was so frustrated on my day off. I think boredom more than anything else. I wanted to scream or cry. Instead I napped. Faced with the pub twice in one week, a family situation and a family birthday, survived both. The first slightly more narrowly as I had time to myself beforehand. 

Week Four - still tempted. More frustrated with my weight than anything at this point. I decided to start tracking what I ate and make more sensible food choices. Pilates board and walking pad arrived and I got to setting those up and using them a few times. Read about someone’s one month sobriety experiment and their experience drinking after and was still tempted to celebrate one month with a few drinks 🤦🏼‍♀️

Week Five (4 days into) - feeling better. I didn’t wake up until midday today, my body was tired and I had nowhere I needed to be! Used the walking pad yesterday and the Pilates board today. 3-4 lbs has shifted in the last week thanks to me making better food choices. More consistent with my skin care. Mood is better and antidepressants are getting to do this job. Emptied the dishwasher, painted my nails, washed my hair, did the Pilates, in the space on four hours. Any one of those would have been lucky to have got done on a usual Monday off before.

No more family birthdays for a while, but I have a work meeting at a pub tomorrow evening. I’d rather skip it but it’s not an option, neither is another venue. I’ve planned what I’m eating and picked one with good NA options. The only temptation is that it’s usually 2 hours either where conversation would be easier with a drink, but I don’t want to have to start again, so I’ll just have to brace life like everyone else!!",2,1751903498.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

Hi neighbors — I’m working on a small, local project called Difference Dinners, and I’m looking to see if anyone in the area might want to be involved, or even just talk with me about it.

The idea is simple: bring together a small group of people with really different political and social backgrounds — undocumented folks, queer/trans people, Trump supporters, people of color, people living in poverty, religious folks, progressives, etc— and have them share a meal. Not to argue, not to debate, not to convert each other. Just to tell personal stories and listen without trying to fix or win. 

It’s inspired by Parker Palmer’s A Hidden Wholeness, the documentary The Color of Fear, and also by the exhausting culture of online “debates” (think 50 TRUMP SUPPORTERS VS 1 FEMINIST) where no one really sees or hears each other. I want to create something that’s filmed (eventually, maybe even just a short pilot to start), but something that feels vulnerable and meaningful. I don’t want to create another endless round table where folks just shout at each other.

I’m looking for:
	•People who might want to participate in a pilot dinner,
	•Videographers, filmmakers, editors who might want to collaborate,
	•Restaurant or café folks who might be willing to host or donate space,
	•Or anyone curious about this and willing to chat about it over coffee,

If you’re interested, even just intrigued, feel free to comment or DM me. Would love to talk.",2,1751903459.0,northampton,0,0.75,False

It didn’t bleed.,"My grandfather spoke of things that walk this world that are older than man, older than the land itself. They do not knock. They do not wait. And by the time you realize you’ve seen one, it might already be too late.

I never believed him. Until now.

We’d just settled on the ranch that spring. Far from town. Wind and silence and space. The kind of place you go to get right with the land. Or with something older.

The morning it happened the sky was clear and still. Not a bird in sight. Cattle standing quiet at the far fence. I walked out with my coffee and leaned on the gate. The sun was just breaking above the ridge.

I saw it coming from the tree line. Took it for a stray dog at first. But no dog moves like that. No dog is that big. Its head was low and its back was broad and it moved slow.

As it came closer I saw it was a wolf. But not the kind you see on TV. This thing was the size of a damn horse. Gray. Thick. Powerful. Its paws kicked up dust and the cattle didn’t flinch. They watched it. Calm. Like they’d seen it before.

And I didn’t move either. That’s what I think about most now. I just stood there. Let it come.

It walked right up to the fence. Close enough to touch. I don’t know why I did it but I reached out and laid a hand on its fur.

It let me.

The coat was coarse. Warm. It stood there breathing. Heavy but not fast. Like it wasn’t worried about me or what I might do.

Then it turned.

It walked to the nearest calf and without sound or warning snapped its jaws around the neck. One quick jerk and the body dropped limp.

That broke the spell.

I pulled my pistol. Fired three rounds. Dust flew. The wolf didn’t even blink.

I ran to my truck and got my rifle from the rack. A big gun. Fired once. The sound cracked across the field.

The wolf turned to look at me.

It looked amused.

It dropped the calf. Turned. And walked off into the open land behind the pens.

I didn’t fire again. I just watched it go until the dust took it.

I followed the tracks. They were deep in the soft earth. Clear. Heavy. I followed them out into the field.

Then they stopped.

Just like that.

No blood. No trail. No drag marks.

A few feet ahead I saw something else. A single line of barefoot prints. Human. Walking away like nothing had happened.

I stood there for a long time. Didn’t call anyone. Didn’t tell my wife. Just walked back to the house and locked the door.

My grandfather was right. There are things out there that wear the shape of animals. But they’re not. Not really. I think they’re older than us. I think they remember when the world belonged to something else.

And sometimes they come back just to remind us.",1,1751903440.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

We were both single at that time until 2020. Because of him I believed in platonic friendship. We’re having dinner and coffee together just to talk. During pandemic (nung medyo maluwag na) we went on a vacation with our circle and from there he shared na may nililigawan na sya. He knows that I was talking to someone na rin before that vacation pa. He was so happy, and I am happy for him. He deserved it after all. It was 12 midnight; we were walking along the shore while talking about this girl when suddenly he stopped. I looked at him and asked him why, he looked away and told me “Bow, when we hit 30 and this don’t work then single tayo parehas, is it okay kung tayo nalang?” I laughed but he’s serious, so I ended it with “We’ll see”. I never asked him why he said that to cut the conversation because I don’t want us to dig deeper with what we feel. And honestly, I don’t feel anything about him. Just purely friendship.

After that night, I stepped back. Out of respect dun sa girl and sa kausap ko. We stopped talking na rin, kamustahan nalang occasionally. We have never had a long conversation since then.

Fast forward to 2024… I’m single, focusing on my career, enjoying my solitude. While him? He’s married to the girl he talked about and already has a kid. When Keshi released the song “Dream” he messaged me out of nowhere saying “Bow, nagrelease ng new song si Keshi pakinggan mo. Mas ok pakinggan if naka-earphone.” So, I did. Btw, Keshi is our favorite artist. But upon listening to it, I felt something. It’s like these are the words he wanted to tell me and thought about the conversation we had nung 2020. But of course, I don’t let the thoughts consume me. I replied to him saying “Ohhh. It’s nice. Thanks for sharing this.” And I asked about his wife and his baby. We had a short catch up but I then stopped replying since I was busy din.

Fast forward to June 2025, he messaged me sa number ko.It was 11;39 in the evening.  The message was simply “Bow.” I saw the message early morning na. I asked him why and he answered me na wala lang daw nevermind. I said, “Ok if you say so"" And then he replied “I dreamt about you last night. Yung dati…” I know what he is pertaining to so to get out of the conversation I simply replied “Ohhh. I see. Dreams can be weird sometimes hahaha” then he replied “Yes.

Did you catch that Beastie Boys reference? Our 8 wk old baby boy display beast-like symptoms - has completely regressed and is no longer sleeping well.

He was able to sleep for 3–4 hour stretches, but over the past two weeks, aside from daytime contact naps, he only sleeps 30–45 minutes at a time, day and night, regardless of how he falls asleep. I changed my diet and eliminated dairy (cheese) three weeks ago, and stopped coffee two days ago.

He cries uncontrollably throughout the day, especially at night. He’s very sensitive to light and high contrast, so we’ve fully darkened the room with no improvement. He has brief happy periods around 8am, but otherwise seems upset and anxious most of the time. We follow 90-minute wake windows—he gets fussy after 1 hour awake and usually goes down between 1 hr 15 and 1 hr 20.

He’s a gassy baby and seems to struggle with digestion. We burp him regularly. I’ve ordered colic drops and will report back if they help.

He’s gaining weight, and we’re doing our best to stay positive, but we’re feeling very stuck. Do you have any thoughts or advice?

Okay, so I need to come clean about something. If you've been following my Medium articles and noticed I've been a bit... absent lately, there's a reason. For the past two days, I've been locked in my room like some kind of hermit, learning video editing and figuring out something that's been brewing in my mind for months.

I'm launching a YouTube channel. There, I said it.

## 📱 Meet Swift Pal - My New Teaching Adventure

Look, I've been an iOS developer for 12 years now. Twelve. Years. That's a lot of Swift code, a lot of late nights debugging constraints, and honestly, a lot of knowledge that's just been sitting in my head. And here's the thing that's been bugging me – I love teaching. I mean, I really love it.

Every time someone comments on my Medium articles or reaches out with questions, I get this little spark of excitement. It's like, ""Yes! I can help you avoid the same mistakes I made!"" But Medium, as much as I love it (and trust me, the love you all show with claps and follows means the world), it's just one piece of the puzzle.

## 🤔 The ""Why Now"" Moment

So why YouTube? Why now? Well, here's where it gets interesting...

I've been thinking about this for months, actually. Every time I write an article about iOS development, I think about how much easier it would be to just show the code in action. You know what I mean? Like, reading about animations is one thing, but seeing them built from scratch? That's where the magic happens.

But honestly? There's something bigger at play here. I'm tired of looking for jobs. I'm tired of the whole corporate dance. I want to do what I love – teaching iOS development – on my own terms, at my own pace.

## 💭 What This Means for Medium (Don't Panic!)

Now, before you think I'm abandoning Medium – hold up. I'm not going anywhere. The love and support here has been incredible, and I'm not about to throw that away. But here's what's changing...

I'm approaching teaching as a full-time thing now. That means I'll be writing articles AND creating YouTube content. It's going to be intense, not gonna lie. Actually, let me rephrase that – it's going to be exhausting. But the good kind of exhausting, you know?

I want to learn more stuff while I'm teaching. Flutter is definitely on my radar (yeah, I know, I know – an iOS dev looking at Flutter), and maybe Android development down the line. But my main focus? Making people better iOS engineers. That's always been the goal.

## ☕ A Quick Thank You (This Made My Week!)

Actually, before I continue, I need to pause and say something. Yesterday, someone from the Medium community bought me the most expensive coffee on my Buy Me a Coffee page. I'm not going to name them (unless they want me to), but seriously – that gesture meant more than you know.

Here I am, taking this leap of faith, betting everything on teaching and creating content, and then someone shows up with this incredible support. It's moments like these that remind me why I love this community so much. So thank you, you amazing human. That coffee is literally fueling these late-night video editing sessions!

## 🎯 The Bigger Picture

Here's the thing – I want to stop looking for jobs. I want to build something that's mine, where I can share my experience without worrying about corporate politics or someone else's timeline. But that also means having no free time for... well, a long time.

Writing articles and creating YouTube videos is going to take everything I've got. But once I'm where I want to be? It'll be so much more flexible. I'll have built something sustainable, something that lets me teach at scale.

## 🎙️ The Honest Truth About My Speaking Journey

Okay, here's something I haven't told anyone yet. One of my biggest concerns? Public speaking. Or should I say, camera anxiety – that's the proper term for what I'm dealing with. I can write code for 12 hours straight, but put me in front of a camera and suddenly I'm stumbling over words I've been using for years.

So here's my plan, and I'm being completely transparent here. I'm starting faceless. Yep, no handsome face (yet) – just screen recordings, code, and my voice trying not to sound like a nervous wreck. I'm going to begin with a mix of beginner tutorials because, honestly, they're easier to explain and they'll help me get my speaking rhythm down.

Think of it as my training ground. I need to become public speaker friendly, and the only way to do that is to actually... well, speak publicly. Even if it's just to a screen recording software at first.

Once I think I'm at least not completely camera-shy anymore, then maybe you'll get to see this handsome face I keep talking about. But for now, it's all about getting comfortable with teaching through video without the added pressure of worrying about how I look on camera.

## 🚀 Join Me on This Journey

Look, I'm not asking you to follow me blindly into this adventure. But if you're interested in iOS development, if you want to learn from someone who's been in the trenches for over a decade, then maybe stick around?

I want people to join me in this journey. Learn from me, sure, but also teach me. Some of the best insights I've had come from questions in the comments, from developers who see things differently than I do.

## 🔮 What's Coming Next

So what can you expect from Swift Pal on YouTube? Real iOS development. Not the sanitized, perfect tutorials you see everywhere, but the messy, real-world stuff. The kind of development where you spend three hours debugging something that turns out to be a missing comma.

I want to share those 12 years of experience – the good, the bad, and the ""why did I think that was a good idea?"" moments. I want to prepare people for their journey ahead, because let's be honest, iOS development is challenging enough without having to figure everything out from scratch.

## 💪 The Reality Check

Am I scared? Yeah, a little. This is a big pivot. Going from stable employment to betting on myself and my ability to teach? It's terrifying. But you know what's more terrifying? Looking back in five years and wondering ""what if.""

So here's to the journey ahead. Here's to late nights editing videos, to learning new things while teaching, to getting over camera anxiety one tutorial at a time, and to building something that matters.

Are you ready to join me?

There are so many ideas about what we are, where we're going, how to do it and where it'll end up. The ideas aren't bad. Maybe. Sometimes. They aren't good either. Maybe. Sometimes.

They're ideas. And ideas are good for the land of make believe, which is all that can ever be known.

This isn't even a transcendental ""make believe"" to suggest there is a world of illusion. Nothing that dogmatic. A whole universe of whatever the fluff, and through ideas, it's rearranged to become something else.

The idea of a tree for instance gets cut down and turned into the idea of a table. See? Simple stuff.

And then we get to measuring things and calculating probabilities and making structures about it all, which is inherently without structure.

The idea of a star. An idea, partly because what the fluff is it and also because, well that particular star may be gone now.

All make believe. Making us believe this and that. Not by force. By choice, or consequence, or circumstance or some other c-word.

Sorry should clarify we are separated not divorced. 

My ex husband who l share 50 50 custody of our two your kids is dating 22 year old and he is 43.  I am 41. 

Now my anger and concern here is based on the below:

We have two young kids one 3 and the other 7 - the oldest was diagnosed with the autism when he was 2 and he was non verbal for a good while. He struggle adjusting to changes…socially..and speech. Etc


We have been amicable the whole separation and l have always considered his opinion (for instance l planned to get a lodger in my house - l have a separate closed off area) to help with finances but l didn’t solely because he was concerned about proximity to our kids even though it’s separate to the main house. I was thinking an older woman but he still was unhappy.

Also the big one here was we discussed together that if we dated we would not expose the kids to anyone for a good good good  period of time or when it became serious and we would talk to each first. Actually this was a big one for him and he was quite pushy with this. But l get it and am exactly the same mindset with the kids. 
With that - l have been dating casually for two years but have never had anyone meet my. Kids so to speak or frankly even spend brief time with them. Given our son struggle with change there is an added level of complexity. 

The other bit here is l was basically a bit shocked - the young lady is 22 so closer to age to our son of 7 then him. I also know her and she is very young and a bit immature though l don’t like to use that word l can’t think of a better one. 
She is big into gym like my ex and they are gym buddies. He has just started to see her recently. 

Honestly and l am not sure if l am right or wrong here but the first thing that panicked me was a question of his moral character (given she is 22 and very young and possibly a bit naive). Mainly because he has kids - if he was childless whilst it might raise eyebrows it certainly is not the same for me - he can do what he wants to do. 

Also he has not followed through with his rules l have since found out my kids have already been around her and he is even taking my boy to gym (which is every evening when he is has care). My son  l think had senses something has he starting mentioning things to me at home ‘dad with this young lady at the gym, who is she mum?’…etc . And l really feel this is not ok at all. 

Also l would like to point out he has been actively dating the past 2 years and l know of the people so l honestly don’t think it jealousy from my end / l just feel like someone has stabbed me in the tummy when l think of this unfolding in front of my children. 

Am l bat shit crazy. Help?

I need to set boundaries and l have basically already said it him ‘ that if he hasn’t he really needs to think about this decision solely regarding the kids’. 

Her being around my children is a huge one and has angered me greatly. Can l ask him to not take the one child to gym so he doesn’t have to watch his dad and a young lady eyeball each other as they work out. The youngest stays with his mum (Nan)  during that sess so why not both of them. 

Finally, he did not tell about it we are on a family holiday and l got to find out by the boombardment of messages pinging through the car console screen all day long we are in a campervan. The young lady he is seeing not only works in the grocery shop l go to but she walks and runs past my house every morning so l now have the reminder when l drink my coffee at my sink 😩 
When l asked him to at least stop notifications alerts in the car (the age thing she’ll shocked me - l knew her age he didn’t say) after the discover whilst we were all in the car on holiday and told him l knew her and l was concerned with the age thing and kids and he got instantly defensive and told me it ‘wasn’t serious’ which was weird given the level of texting happening. 

I am just so worried about my kids. Very early on in my dating l filtered young men - because frankly l have the kids to think about but more importantly although it’s very flattering to have attention from lots of young men as a mum it feels slightly weird and l need to prioritise the kids. I just couldn’t introduce a 22 year to my kids as my boyfriend. 

Be kind l need guidance on how to juggle this situ but also it literally makes my tummy sick when l think about my kids. 


In summary it’s not about what he’s bring into the relationship with me but about what’s he bringing into the family. ",2,1751902808.0,Separation,6,0.75,False
1ltxg5l,https://i.redd.it/stul005hzgbf1.jpeg,Cheers to 250 Years America!,"Happy Independence Day BenShot Community!

With the Fourth of July weekend wrapping up, let's talk about what makes our Musket Ball glasses special. In honor of America’s 250th birthday next year, we’ve created a line of limited-edition glasses embedded with musket balls. These musket balls are cast one by one, by hand, just like they did back in the Revolutionary War. 

**Independence Day**, or the Fourth of July, is a cornerstone of American identity, representing far more than just a historical event. It serves as a powerful reminder of the nation’s foundational principles and the enduring pursuit of liberty and self-governance. Here’s why it holds such a deep significance:

* **Birth of a Nation**: It marks the day in 1776 when the Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence, a pivotal moment that formally declared the thirteen colonies’ separation from British rule and the birth of the United States.
* **Embodiment of American Ideals**: The holiday celebrates the ideals articulated in the Declaration, emphasizing equality, the inherent right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness - principles that have shaped the nation’s identity and continue to inspire democratic movements globally.
* **Tribute to Sacrifice**: Independence Day also provides an opportunity to reflect on the sacrifices made by countless individuals who fought and died to secure and defend these freedoms throughout American history.

**Our Featured Musket Ball Glass:** Our Musket Ball glasses are crafted by U.S. veterans, these glasses are a tribute to the patriots who forged a nation and those who continue to protect it. Whether you’re celebrating Independence Day, collecting American history, or gifting a proud patriot, this glass is built to tell a story 250 years in the making.

* **High-Quality Craftsmanship:** Each glass is crafted with precision and care in the USA, ensuring durability and style. Every musket ball is molded using time-honored techniques and embedded into the glass by hand.
* **Unique Design:** The embedded musket ball is a great conversation starter and adds a touch of American history to your drinkware collection.
* **Perfect for Celebrations:** Whether you're hosting a 4th of July party or enjoying a quiet evening, our Musket Ball Glass is the perfect companion.
* **Types of Glasses**: Our complete range of glassware, including shot glasses, rock glasses, pint glasses, wine glasses, beer mugs, coffee mugs, and decanters, can all be customized with the embedded Musket Ball.

**Show Your BenShot Pride:** We’d love to see how you’re using your BenShot Musket Ball Glass to celebrate America! Share your photos in the comments or tag us on social media. Whether you’re enjoying a drink while watching fireworks or enjoying American Freedom in your backyard, show us your BenShot pride.

**Fun Fact:** Did you know that the iconic statue of King George III in New York City was torn down by American colonists after the Declaration of Independence was read aloud, and parts of it were melted down and turned into musket balls to be used against the British! This act of defiance was a powerful symbolic statement of breaking away from British rule. Some sources even refer to these musket balls made from the King’s statue as “melted majesty”.

Let’s raise a glass to our founders and the patriots that lived, fought, and died for America.

Cheers,

For Lynn and Susan, this had been their first and only trip to the moon. I’d like to say they were the only ones choked up with emotion as we lifted off, but even Jarl had a tear roll down his cheek. With our final clean-up complete, the TEV Ursa Minor’s first exploration mission was officially complete. It was time to head home, celebrate our accomplishment, and then look forward to wherever our path would take us next.

Upon return to the ship, we were a bit surprised to find Captain Victor there to greet us.

“I’d ask why a 4-hour mission took nearly six, but if you told me I’d likely have to do something about it,” he grumbled while we all just tried to look as innocent as possible.

“Susan, Auggie. We need to finish up the awards. Everybody else, dismissed,” he said with practiced authority and the rest of us took the opportunity to skedaddle before any awkward questions could be asked about how our trip went. 

The crew was in designated downtime, but that didn’t mean the ship wasn’t buzzing with activity. The captain had declared there would be an awards ceremony followed by a post-exploration party, so everyone was either helping prepare or was busy getting cleaned up for the party. Only the captain and a few volunteers would stay on duty in case of emergency.

I could understand and appreciate the party. It was the awards ceremony that I didn’t understand and nobody would explain. All Lynn would say is that it was a human tradition to hand out special awards at the end of something big, and I’d see what it was all about soon.

Needing to freshen up before the festivities, I stepped into the galactic universal refresher unit closest to my quarters and found a rude surprise.

For the first time since I came on board, the settings were changed to accommodate humans rather than a Vr’rapt’ch. Evidently the volume of people needing to get ready for tonight was high enough that they needed to use my stall, and they had even moved my personal detangling brush to the corner rather than hanging it back on the wall hook where I left it.

I reset the controls to Vr’rapt’ch and took a quick few moments to gather the brush and other things that had gotten moved. With a quick wave of my hand, I activated the full body shower spray. 

“Yipe!” I yelped as lukewarm water sprayed out.

I glared at the offending shower heads after jumping clear of the far too chilly water. Not only had someone used my private stall, but they had also messed with all the settings. I grumbled as it took a few moments to get everything back to the way I liked it.

Remember folks, to clean the fur you must steam the fur. If the mirror doesn't fog up in under 30 seconds, add more heat.

I put my hand into the shower spray and confirmed the temperature was appropriately steamy, thus allowing me to finally eliminate the effects of void suit fur with a comfy soak and blow dry.

Stepping out of the stall with freshly cleaned fur, I was confronted by four crew members with combs and brushes. These lovely ladies were not going to let me out of the refresher with less than perfectly aligned fur, and more importantly they were curious what I had been up to on the last-minute unscheduled trip to the moon. When I didn’t admit to any sins or rat out Auggie and my coworkers, conversation shifted to the important stuff – crew gossip! 

“Did you hear who has a crush on Jarl?”

“If you think that’s good, you should hear about who Rosa caught naked in a shuttle after hours the other night.” 

“How many credits do you want to bet that Lynn and Raj step out tonight officially as a couple?”

'Thank you, ladies. Very informative,' I thought to myself. 'Very informative, indeed.' As I processed and cataloged information for later use, conversation shifted to tonight’s activities. 

Shuttle Bay 2 had been converted to a dance floor and would be used for the awards ceremony. While that was the main event, there were also movie theaters set up, a board game room, and the officer’s lounge was converted to a coffee and tea bazaar for the folks preferring quiet conversation. In what would prove to be a stroke of genius or an error of epic proportions, Captain Victor had also authorized an open bar. 

With bonds forged over girl talk in the refresher, our newly formed pack of five headed to the galley for dinner before the awards ceremony. I used the opportunity to obtain more gossip. After dinner, we went down to the shuttle bay together before a fond farewell at the door as we split off to meet up with our usual friends.

“Jarl!” I called out when I spotted the big man. “Elevator, please.”

He smiled and came over to lift me so I could sit on his shoulders. As I made myself comfortable towering over the crowd, he made a happy statement.

“Bing! Second floor! Hardware, children’s wear, and highchairs!”

I smiled at his joke. Jarl was definitely my chair, and I was up high.

There was a low buzz of expectation and excitement in the crowd, which broke into a cheer as Captain Victor came in and stepped up onto a stage with a cloth covered podium. After a moment to let the cheering calm, he stepped forward to give us a speech.

“When this ship was first commissioned, we were just humanity reaching to the stars. We didn’t expect the stars to find us,” he began. “Only a few years ago, we started the list of firsts. First contact. First exchange of technology. First diplomatic incident. All these things brought us to today, the first human exploration vessel to join the greater galaxy’s fleet. With the success of this mission, we join all the other sapient races not just as a trading partner or source of new culture to experience, but as contributors in all respects. Curious minds who seek to advance not only our own knowledge, but that of the galaxy. I thank all of you for your hard work making this mission a success.""

As the captain paused, there was a round of applause and cheering from the crew.

“We have a further first to celebrate. This is the first Terran exploration vessel to complete a mission with a non-human crew member,” he said with a warm smile as his eyes met mine. Admittedly, I wasn’t hard to spot in the crowd as I was sitting up on Jarl’s shoulders. “As part of the mission, First Officer Jacque had Haasha collect a sample which I am proud to announce has been accepted into the collection of the Smithsonian. While it will be on display on the ship for the duration of this mission, and upon completion it will be transferred to Earth.” 

With a smooth motion he removed the cloth from what we had all taken as an impromptu podium. Instead, it was a display case with the rock I had found. Above the rock was a picture of me in my void suit captured in mid-skip as I headed out on one of my runs with the mining probes. Below the rock was a plaque describing the rock.

TEV Ursa Minor – First galactic exploration mission with multi-sapient crew.

Sample #15016b, collected by Vy’rapt'ch Crew Member Haasha.

“No seatbelt required.” 

The crowd cheered, although a sizeable chunk of us looked a little confused at the seatbelt reference. 

Susan whispered up to me, “Given the sample you found, we couldn’t resist an old NASA joke especially since your rock looks very similar to a sample collected during the original moon landing missions from Earth. The sample number actually refers to that Apollo mission specimen. It’s a joke for us nerdy science folks!”

I simply nodded and decided I’d ask for the full story later. Sometimes the best jokes are the nerdy inside jokes, and I still felt a little like I was on the outside looking in. I also was a little confused by some of the impressed looks when the caption mentioned the rock would be added to the Smithsonian. One of the nearby crew had even commented to me, “The Smithsonian? You’re a rock star now, Haasha!” Was that a pun because I found a rock?

As the cheering died down, Captain Victor stepped to the side of the display case and fired up a holoprojector.

“And now for the awards!” he called out and received a raucous cheer in response. I was about to find out exactly what sort of awards would be handed out post-mission. 

Science team member Okachuku Abebe received the first award aptly named the ‘Getting HIGH!’ Award for jumping the highest at an impromptu contest on the moon. The captain displayed an image of Okachuku with both hands up as he jumped next to a measuring rod that was supposed to be used for providing scale in images.

The next award started with a bit of video from someone’s suit cam. One moment, the person was walking and the footage was boring. After a moment, they tripped and you could hear a woman’s voice call out, “Oh, shit!” 

You then got a fantastic view of the ground approaching followed by a lot of scraping sounds accompanied by a terrified shriek. After a moment the video footage faded out and a still image came up showing a fresh scar in a hillside with a poor person in a void suit lying at the bottom of newly carved path. It then faded into black with an announcement voiced by Tac-1.

*Travel distance, 103.4 meters.* 

Geologist Daniella Sato earned the coveted ‘Have a nice trip!’ Award.

The captain and Susan went through about ten more awards immortalizing accidents, silly behavior, or just something strange. Competition for the ‘Dude, where’s my coffee?’ Award seemed to be especially fierce with six finalists. Surprisingly enough, Auggie wasn't among the contenders. In the end, my coworker Jack in engineering got the award.

I was used to asking, ""Whose coffee is this?"" and him sheepishly claiming it once per shift, but I didn't know that one day he put down his coffee, forgot about it, and got a replacement only to put it down and forget it again a total of 7 times in one shift.

As things were winding down, our fearless leader stepped up to the stage for one last award.

“And now, we have a special award to give. I know many of you aren’t classic sci-fi fans, but you still know the deal. However, we’re aware that at least one member of the crew likely hasn’t a clue. We’ll let Admiral James T. Kirk himself give us the original context,” Captain Victor stated with a smirk.

The holovid came to life of an old Earth 2D movie with an upset middle-aged man in a dark red uniform looking out. In anger, he screamed out, “KHAAAAAN!” 

The image changed to a crater on what looked like an abandoned planet with multiple impact craters shockingly similar to the moon we had just explored, and the man once again screamed out, “KHAAAAAN!”

The footage changed, this time to a suit cam. Somebody was in a deep crater looking around. They turned and… oh, no. 

What’s that on screen? It’s just the mining probe control deck in all its galactic standard boredom. The only crew member qualified to operate the finicky beast? That would be me.

This video footage was from my void suit camera when I realized I was trapped in a crater with nothing to do or look at for over an hour. The camera view suddenly turned to the blackness of space above as I knelt down and looked up to the stars in frustration. You could see my arms raised in shaking fists. 

“ARRRRRRRGH!” my voice rang out in the holovid with anger and anguish, silencing everyone in the shuttle bay. A moment later, the crew erupted with laughter and cheers.

Jarl confidently strode towards the stage with me on his shoulders so one previously unknown crew member named Haasha could receive The Khan! Award. The award was a small holoplaque mounted on a brass stand. If you tapped the base, the image of Admiral Kirk screaming would appear along with the text ""Khaaaaan!"" underneath.

I later discovered a switch on the bottom that would turn off the text and instead activate a tiny little speaker that would belt out my scream of frustration from that day when you tapped the base of the award. Still paired with Kirk's face, of course.

Thanks to Admiral Kirk, humans found a way to immortalize my plight well before I was even born. Quite impressive. Only a teensy bit embarrassing for me, but I loved the award.

And with that final award presented, the party began!

Lynn, Susan, and I started off in the board game room playing a silly card game called Rise of the Intergalactic Mini Muffins. The goal of the game was to force humanity to bake enough of your kind to dominate the world and launch a rocket to infect the galaxy, and you were limited to 10 rounds to accomplish this. On top of that, each kind of mini muffin had special powers and was trying to dominate all the other mini muffins! 

In round 8 of the first game, I thought I was going to take the win.

‘I’ve got Blueberry Blast ready, so as long as nobody messes with me the universe shall bow to my fruited might!’ I thought to myself. Unfortunately, I didn’t hide my glee as well as I thought I did.

“Sorry Haasha, but you’re Jammed!” Lynn called out invoking the dastardly powers of the Strawberry Shortcakes. 

Sadly, our infighting meant none of us dominated the world or got a rocket launched in that first game, but in the second Susan managed to stall us all in round 7 with Melted Choco-Mess as a setup to win in round 8 as the Chocolate Chippies.

I loved the game, and it was a blast to play something fast paced and fun that didn’t require school exam level concentration. Lynn told me such games are popular in the geek and nerd crowds and follow in the tradition of ones like Murder Bunnies (or was it Killer Bunnies?). 

We were about to shift over to Space Monopoly: Pirate Raider Edition when Rosa and Chang walked in with Jarl just a few steps behind. Nobody realized this was about to be a coordinated Haasha-napping.  

Chang and Rosa drew off Lynn and Susan with promises of fresh drinks and dark chocolate, yet as soon as they were 5 meters away and their backs turned, Jarl yoinked me and turned to run with me hugged to his chest. 

“EEEP!” I let out as the big guy thundered away as fast as he could. Behind me, I could hear startled expressions.

Lynn roared out, “No you don’t! RAJ, GET HIM!” 

And that’s how we ended up with tall, dark, and handsome chasing after us.

Jarl’s destination turned out to be the shuttle bay and more specifically, the dance floor. As he let me down, a huge cheer erupted from the crew and I saw two things. First, the holodisplay the captain had used for the awards ceremony was now playing a clip from Jarl’s void suit camera of me dancing with him while on a break. Second, my void suit was connected to the sound system and it looked like Tac-1 had been assigned DJ duties for tonight. Hopefully Tac-1 would steer clear of the elevator music or there might be dents in my shiny void suit before the end of the night.

Raj, Lynn, and Susan caught up soon afterwards with Rosa and Chang giggling like madmen shortly thereafter. Once my former board game buddies had been appeased with fresh drinks and chocolate, we all stepped out onto the dance floor to wiggle our tails off.

The rest of the evening was a whirlwind of dancing and good times. I might have gotten a little too drunk, and fell asleep on a couch snuggled against Jarl. 

I woke up after a great night’s sleep in a large cargo crate lined with blankets and pillows. It was obvious I was packed in a cargo crate as I could clearly see the open lid above me. There was a sign attached.

“Live specimen storage. Sample H-1.” 

I would soon learn there was both photo and video evidence of the just slightly inebriated science team ‘properly packing the specimen’. Auggie refuses to confirm or deny if that video will be included with the official mission record.

Just wanted to share my experience working with Data Annotation (DA) since I’ve noticed more people are curious about legit WFH options. I’ve been using the platform for about a year and a half now, and it’s helped me make over $15,000 whilst finishing up my degree in Business and Marketing here in the UK.

DA is similar to platforms like Outlier since you evaluate AI models, write prompts, give feedback, and work on a bunch of different projects. Some are creative, some technical, and some just need your honest opinion. I’ve worked on projects related to bilingual content, finance, business, safety, accuracy, and even a few STEM ones. Some require experience, but many are accessible even if you don’t have a formal background in the topic.

The best part about this job has been working from home or wherever I’ve got WiFi and coffee ☕. The platform has become my main income source since graduating, and I’m now at nearly full-time earnings, completely remote. Payouts take about a week to verify, but you can withdraw every three days. Work volume can vary, but if you’re consistent and qualify for different project types, there’s real potential here. You do sign an NDA, so I can’t go into detail on the specific companies I’ve worked with, but they’re the biggest companies, especially in the AI field. Like any freelance or remote gig, there can be dry spells. However, this is the best remote platform I have worked for and have consistently been able to work. Whether a student, a recent grad, or just looking for more flexibility, this has been a game-changer for me.

I’ve also set up a Discord community, ""WFH Earners Club"", for anyone who wants to get into remote work, learn how to qualify for projects, share progress, and stay motivated. Whether you're new to this or turning side gigs into full-time income, it's a space to connect, co-work, and grow together.

It was fun, but it wasn't as easy as I thought. After a while, i could only gather less than a kilogram.

Crying in a coffee shop. Akala mo anong drama na naman ang nagpe-play sa utak ko haha. But seriously, my body is trembling. I am sad. So sad.

1. I sat on the sofa next to the area where a mother talks with her toddler. 11:23PM. The kid is young. The night feels younger. It could feel like an eternity. I miss my mother just talking with me. Talking and talking. Talking nonsense. Nothing needs to make sense. The warmth of her presence. Those soft, gentle voice. Looking at me with so much love. Looking at me like I am worth it.

2. Today, I realized that I won't be able to go to the birthday celebration that I have started planning for my grandmother. Work came in on a weekend. I needed to fly. Everything's booked and I cannot cancel (or attempt on paying for the cancellation of my flight just to at least make it to my grandma's birthday celebration). It's a very simple celebration, but it will be our first time celebrating in a really nice home which we have been dreaming of ever since (thanks to AirBnB). I miss my grandma hugging me. There was this one time when I was all wet because of the rain, and she was drying me up with that worn out towel. Then she would hug me when I sleep next to her. We would always sleep early. Sometimes, after doing my homework, I would snuggle into her because she would always sleep early - next to me. Studying back then felt peaceful surrounded by that much love.

3. I left my father's place early today. The usual routine every Monday as I needed to go back to my place in the Metro and spend the whole week there alone. I miss my father taking care of me. How he pretends to be so strong and tough, even if he would always check on me when I am sick. How he would never sleep if I am sick. How his instant reaction when I have a fever is to cook an instant noodle because it's hot and it's good for colds. I feel so week today, papa, and I miss being taken care of. 

How I miss how my mother, my papa, my grandma would always try to look so strong and dependable even if I know - that sometimes, their voices shake, their hand tremble. That sometimes, they also don't know what to do. That sometimes, they would have to look for that silver lining to get through. But still, they chose to be strong.

And now, I can't even be strong for myself. I'm sorry.",1,1751902621.0,AlasFeels,1,1.0,False

Chapter 1

At our class reunion, my husband lost a game of truth or dare and was dared to call the person he regretted most in his life.

I listened as a woman's voice came through the phone.

She asked, ""If I get divorced now, will you give me a place to call home?""

Marcus answered confidently, ""Yes.""

An awkward silence filled the room.

Everyone expected a dramatic response from me, but instead, I calmly took off my wedding ring and walked away.

He returned home late again that night.

I handed him the divorce papers I had prepared beforehand, ""Marcus, let's end this marriage.""

Upon hearing this, Marcus tugged impatiently at his tie, ""Frances, this is absurd. Over such a trivial thing, you’re making a scene and daring to bring up divorce? You've really grown bold!""

He had just pledged himself to another woman, in front of everyone, yet accused me of overreacting.

No surprise there. My endless tolerance over the years had led him to see me as a pushover—someone he could manipulate at will, not even worthy of expressing anger.

I chuckled at myself, ""I'm willingly stepping aside for her; shouldn’t that make you happy?""

Marcus's brow furrowed; I noticed the displeasure in his eyes.

""Stop being irrational, will you? It was just a game. Livia is a friend; do you expect me to reject her outright and embarrass her? Frances, you shouldn’t be so selfish.""

I nodded, ""Yes, you’re right, which is why we should separate.""

This was my second time mentioning divorce, and Marcus, usually composed, showed a flicker of panic. But he quickly regained his calm.

""Frances, don’t use divorce to threaten me.""

""Apologize to Livia properly, and I might reconsider. Otherwise, I don’t mind changing the role of Mrs. Kelley.""

It was utterly laughable.

Three years of marriage, and Marcus's heart had always belonged to Livia.

I was foolish not to see it clearly until today.

I said nothing more, simply tearing up the only photo we had together.

It was taken at our wedding, only after I had begged Marcus persistently; he reluctantly agreed.

In the photo, he showed no hint of joy, starkly contrasting my own expression.

I had cherished this photo once, but now, under Marcus's shocked gaze, I slowly tore it to pieces.

""Marcus, we're getting divorced.""

After a brief moment of disbelief, Marcus spoke coldly, ""Frances, don’t regret this!""

He stormed out, leaving behind a floor covered in torn fragments.

This was how he always treated me.

Any time I did something that displeased him, he'd punish me until I begged for forgiveness, then he’d generously pardon me.

He forgot that today was our third wedding anniversary.

I had originally prepared a big surprise for him.

But I didn't expect that he would call Livia at the party, and when she asked that question, he agreed without hesitation.

My last illusion about him was completely shattered.

Three years of marriage, and I finally realized I couldn’t win his heart.

So I decided to let him go and free myself.

\---

The next morning, I was about to book a ride on my phone when I saw Livia's post on Facebook.

""No matter when, if I look back, you'll always be waiting there for me.""

The accompanying photo showed fingers intertwined, with Marcus wearing the watch I had custom-made for him on his birthday. It had our initials engraved on it.

When Marcus put on the watch, he said he was willing to leave the past behind and try with me.

Hearing those words made me ecstatic, foolishly believing that three years of devotion hadn’t been in vain, and he finally noticed me.

That night was also when we consummated our marriage for the first time.

My hand instinctively went to my belly.

Yes, I was pregnant.

Last night, I intended to share the good news, but now, it was unnecessary.

I blocked Livia.

I went alone to the hospital to schedule an abortion. As the cold instruments entered my body, I cried with pain.

How liberating!

From now on, the last tie to Marcus was completely severed.

During my hospital stay, Marcus never called.

Due to the damage to my body, the doctor said it might be difficult for me to have children in the future.

Saying I wasn't saddened would be a lie, but more than anything, I felt relief.

At least my child wouldn't be like me, pathetically yearning for Marcus's occasional scraps of affection.

""My dear, you finally woke up. That jerk Marcus doesn't deserve you.""

""Don't worry, once you're divorced, I'll hire a team of male models just for you. Why stick with one bad man when you can have a whole entourage?""

My only close friend, Isabelle, wholeheartedly supported my decision to divorce.

Seeing her exaggerated expression, I couldn't help but laugh.

She looked at me with utmost seriousness and said, ""Frannie, this time, make sure you don't go back to him.""

I nodded, ""I won't.""

After the divorce, I'll leave this city behind once and for all.

Chapter 2

I spent two weeks in the hospital, and Marcus didn't call me once. When I was finally discharged, I returned home. As soon as I stepped inside, I saw Livia lounging in one of Marcus's white button-down shirts, her bare legs on full display.

She tilted her head provocatively, revealing a suspicious red mark on her neck. ""Marcus can be so intense; I told him to take it easy,"" she mused.

I wasn't bothered by the mark; it was the emerald necklace around her neck that caught my attention. ""Who gave you that necklace?"" I asked.

Livia smirked. ""Oh, this? I mentioned I liked it, and Marcus gave it to me,"" she replied casually.

I reached out to take it back. ""Give it to me.""

That necklace was the only keepsake my mother left me, and Marcus knew it perfectly well, yet he still gave it to Livia.

""No way, Marcus gave it to me, so it's mine now,"" Livia retorted with a smug smile. ""Oh, I remember, this was your dear mother's auction prize, right? Stylish choice, but it's mine now.""

""You and your late mother are destined to lose to me!"" she taunted.

Rage boiled inside me, and I lunged forward to reclaim my mother's heirloom. Livia swiftly changed her tune. ""Sis, I've already explained—I spilled coffee on my clothes and had to wear Marcus's. Why are you acting like this?""

""Cut the nonsense and give me back the necklace!"" I snapped.

Just as my hand neared the necklace, Marcus rushed out and shoved me aside. Unable to dodge, my waist slammed into the edge of a table.

The sharp pain nearly buckled my legs, and I clung to the table corner to stay upright. Sweat beaded on my forehead from the agony, and my face turned pale.

Marcus sneered, ""Frances, stop playing the victim. You come home just to harass Livia!""

""Really, pulling that schoolyard bullying act again? Let me tell you, as long as I'm here, you won't lay a finger on Livia!""

""Schoolyard bullying?"" I echoed, looking at Livia. ""Is that what you told him?""

A flicker of panic crossed Livia's eyes, but she quickly shifted her demeanor, feigning fear as she clung to Marcus's sleeve. ""No, Frances didn't bully me; I was just rambling...""

She shed a few tears, instantly dispelling all of Marcus's doubts.

He shielded Livia with his body, saying, ""Livia, don't be afraid. I'm here, and nobody can hurt you!""

Marcus glared at me with disdain, ""Even Frances can't.""

Even though I was set on divorce, his loathing gaze felt like a dagger through my heart. I remembered years ago when Marcus held my hand and earnestly promised, ""I'll always protect you.""

And indeed he had. He was gentle and caring, carrying me to the hospital when I was ill. His kindness made my heart flutter irresistibly.

But everything changed when Livia appeared.

Livia was my father's illegitimate daughter. She always played the victim, winning Marcus's sympathy. He accused me of being heartless, claiming I vented my grievances from past generations on innocent Livia.

What he didn't know was that his so-called innocent Livia led the bullying against me in college. She locked me in the bathroom, forcing me to drink toilet water. She pressed a heated curling iron against my back, scorching my skin until I nearly passed out. Only when they realized things had gone too far did they call an ambulance to take me to the hospital.

The first thing I was made to do upon waking was to sign a letter of forgiveness, coerced by my father.

He said, ""Livia was just confused; as her elder sister, you shouldn't hold it against her.""

It wasn't as if he hadn't seen the bloody and raw state of my back. But his heart had already tipped entirely in Livia's favor.

I thought at least Marcus would understand me. So I sought him out myself, only to be met with his cold and ruthless gaze.

""Frances, I never expected you to be so cruel!""

But what had I done? It was me who was the victim, yet everyone sided with the perpetrator.

From that moment on, everything shifted. At home or outside, I became the least welcome presence. I was like a villain in a soap opera, always cast aside.

Taking a deep breath, I reached out my hand toward them. ""Give me back the necklace; it's my mother's heirloom.""

Marcus's eyes momentarily showed a hint of guilt. He knew. My father despised my mother and burned all her belongings in a fit of rage after she was gone. That necklace was the sole heirloom she left me.

He seemed to hesitate. ""Livia, just return it to her. I'll get you something prettier later.""

""But I really like it,"" Livia pouted, giving me a nasty look despite her docile façade as she reluctantly removed the necklace.

Just as my hand was about to touch the necklace, she suddenly let it drop. It hit the ground and shattered into pieces!

Without hesitation, I slapped Livia across the face.

The next moment, Marcus shoved me down with force. ""Frances, haven't you had enough? You dare bully Livia right in front of me—how come I didn't see this side of you before!""

I fell onto the shards of emerald, blood staining my hands. Marcus's eyes flickered with a pang of guilt, but ultimately, he clenched his fist. ""Frances, you brought this upon yourself for bullying Livia.""

How laughable. My husband held another woman in his arms, blaming me, his rightful wife, for being heartless.

""Yeah, this villain should have stepped down long ago. So, did you sign the divorce papers yet?""

Since he'd already brought his mistress under our roof, I assumed he had signed the divorce documents. But for some reason, Marcus seemed furious at the mention of it.

""Frances, do you really want to divorce me that badly?""

Livia feigned sorrow, chiming in, ""Sis, please don't fight with Marcus because of me. I should be the one to leave.""

She said that, yet clung to Marcus, pressing herself as close as possible. Her intentions were clear to anyone but Marcus.

""Livia, you don't have to lower yourself to her level. I'm here; she can't bully you,"" Marcus assured her, throwing me a disdainful look as he added, ""Frances, don't think I don't know what you're up to. Threatening me with divorce, huh? I hate being threatened more than anything!""

I chuckled coldly. ""Marcus, you're overestimating yourself.""

""A man compromised like you is of no use to me anymore.""

""You like her, right? Then she's all yours.""

""You...""

Livia's eyes lit up at the mention of divorce from Marcus. She wrapped herself around his arm, pretending to plead, ""Sis, you're really misunderstanding. Marcus and I aren't like that; I just returned to the country and know no one else...""

""Oh, so your father has already passed, and you have nowhere else to go, huh?""

Marcus probably didn't expect me to be so blunt. He angrily scolded, ""Frances, look at yourself—do you have any resemblance to the woman you once were?""

""In your eyes, only Livia deserves to be Mrs. Kelley. So let's get divorced.""

""Can you stop bringing up divorce every other sentence?""

""Isn't that exactly what you want? My future brother-in-law.""

I deliberately emphasized the words ""brother-in-law,"" and Marcus predictably flew into a rage. He pulled out the divorce papers from the table, signed them right in front of me, and tossed them over.

""Are you satisfied now? Let me tell you, even if you beg me, I'll never forgive you!""

I carefully checked the signature on the papers, feeling relieved. ""Rest assured, I won't.""

As I reached the door, I seemed to remember something. ""Oh, by the way, tomorrow we'll finalize the divorce certificate. Don't be late.""

All I received was Marcus's cold command to ""get out!""

Livia watched with a face full of smug anticipation.

But she didn't know—everything here, including Marcus, was already meaningless to me.

Chapter 3

Isabelle looked worried the moment she saw me.

""Didn't you go back to talk to Marcus about the divorce? What happened? Did he hit you?""

""The jerk! I'll make him pay.................

1ltxasj,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Sminimori/comments/1ltxasj/my_ex_husband_of_43_is_dating_someone_much/,My ex husband of 43 is dating someone much younger and l am concerned about the kids,"I need some opinions and guidance. 

My ex husband who l share 50 50 custody of our two your kids is dating 22 year old and he is 43.  I am 41. 

Now my anger and concern here is based on the below:

We have two young kids one 3 and the other 7 - the oldest was diagnosed with the autism when he was 2 and he was non verbal for a good while. He struggle adjusting to changes…socially..and speech. Etc


We have been amicable the whole separation and l have always considered his opinion (for instance l planned to get a lodger in my house - l have a separate closed off area) to help with finances but l didn’t solely because he was concerned about proximity to our kids even though it’s separate to the main house. I was thinking an older woman but he still was unhappy.

Also the big one here was we discussed together that if we dated we would not expose the kids to anyone for a good good good  period of time or when it became serious and we would talk to each first. Actually this was a big one for him and he was quite pushy with this. But l get it and am exactly the same mindset with the kids. 
With that - l have been dating casually for two years but have never had anyone meet my. Kids so to speak or frankly even spend brief time with them. Given our son struggle with change there is an added level of complexity. 

The other bit here is l was basically a bit shocked - the young lady is 22 so closer to age to our son of 7 then him. I also know her and she is very young and a bit immature though l don’t like to use that word l can’t think of a better one. 
She is big into gym like my ex and they are gym buddies. He has just started to see her recently. 

Honestly and l am not sure if l am right or wrong here but the first thing that panicked me was a question of his moral character (given she is 22 and very young and possibly a bit naive). Mainly because he has kids - if he was childless whilst it might raise eyebrows it certainly is not the same for me - he can do what he wants to do. 

Also he has not followed through with his rules l have since found out my kids have already been around her and he is even taking my boy to gym (which is every evening when he is has care). My son  l think had senses something has he starting mentioning things to me at home ‘dad with this young lady at the gym, who is she mum?’…etc . And l really feel this is not ok at all. 

Also l would like to point out he has been actively dating the past 2 years and l know of the people so l honestly don’t think it jealousy from my end / l just feel like someone has stabbed me in the tummy when l think of this unfolding in front of my children. 

Am l bat shit crazy. Help?

I need to set boundaries and l have basically already said it him ‘ that if he hasn’t he really needs to think about this decision solely regarding the kids’. 

Her being around my children is a huge one and has angered me greatly. Can l ask him to not take the one child to gym so he doesn’t have to watch his dad and a young lady eyeball each other as they work out. The youngest stays with his mum (Nan)  during that sess so why not both of them. 

Finally, he did not tell about it we are on a family holiday and l got to find out by the boombardment of messages pinging through the car console screen all day long we are in a campervan. The young lady he is seeing not only works in the grocery shop l go to but she walks and runs past my house every morning so l now have the reminder when l drink my coffee at my sink 😩 
When l asked him to at least stop notifications alerts in the car (the age thing she’ll shocked me - l knew her age he didn’t say) after the discover whilst we were all in the car on holiday and told him l knew her and l was concerned with the age thing and kids and he got instantly defensive and told me it ‘wasn’t serious’ which was weird given the level of texting happening. 

I am just so worried about my kids. Very early on in my dating l filtered young men - because frankly l have the kids to think about but more importantly although it’s very flattering to have attention from lots of young men as a mum it feels slightly weird and l need to prioritise the kids. I just couldn’t introduce a 22 year to my kids as my boyfriend. 

Be kind l need guidance on how to juggle this situ but also it literally makes my tummy sick when l think about my kids. 


In summary it’s not about what he’s bring into the relationship with me but about what’s he bringing into the family. ",1,1751902450.0,u_Sminimori,0,0.99,False

1ltxa4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/HospitalityStories/comments/1ltxa4n/whats_the_worst_management_stories_you_have/,What's the worst management stories you have?,"Posting this because I recently remembered a story of an awful management team that I had the pleasure of being a subordinate and thought I'd share: 

I (18M) was working at a hotel as a receptionist. I was still on my probation period of 3 months, good pay compared to previous jobs and friendly staff. I'm being trained by a new manager, let's call him John. John teaches me how to book people in and take preauthorisation payments, add extras etc.... 

I pass the training and get confident after a few weeks to run the reception desk alone with John in the CCTV room next to the reception if I needed help. This worked well and I'd always been interested in learning bartending and I'd occasionally move to the bar to talk with the working bartender to learn how to do it, only when the reception desk was empty of course.

After a while of reception I'm rotated to work in the restaurant and I was hoping for a similar training to the reception role as i hadn't had any experience as a waiter. Instead as the people poured in for breakfast I was thrown into the deep end trying to do what I could. The manager of the restaurant wasn't giving any advice so I winged it and we got through it. Occasionally they'd tell me what to do but not very clear and the system was chaos. I admittedly didn't cope well but I did what I could with the knowledge I had but in the end I got stationed at the bar. I was much happier about this as I had had some practice working the bar and could pour drinks confidently. Also the bar was a lot more relaxed than pubs nearby and it was a more casual feel than the chaos of the restaurant. 

One day I get told that a Starbucks section that was closed down was getting moved to the bar. I thought this would have some training or a dedicated member of staff for this but I was wrong. On top of this I wasn't told where the recipe book was so when someone asked for an acai ice coffee or something I had to search the bar for the recipe but had no luck so I had to wing it again. I knew where the ingredients were and the mixer so I made a concoction vaguely resembling it, I'll admit this was a bad idea but I had spent 5 mins looking for the recipe and I felt a time crunch so I didn't want to search for the restaurant manager. 

After that mess I went to find the manager who got mad at me for not knowing where the recipe booklet was and pulled it out from the side of the coffee machine sandwiched against the wall. I was annoyed at myself for not finding it but then the manager starts berating me saying that I should know the recipes for the drinks. This made me a bit annoyed at them for shouting at me in front of customers but I'm a tad shy and just carry on with work. 

The rest of the shift goes as planned with no real issues but it comes to 5 mins before the end of my shift, I was working 15:00-22:00, and I ask as the restaurant needs being set for the morning if there's anything I can do before I go as I'd closed up the bar. The manager says yes and I help get everything ready. She then says to double check that the bar is fully cleaned down which took ~10 mins then I say ""I've gone over all the surfaces and cleaned the coffee machine again"" and then she goes and checks it and says ""have you polished all the glasses?"" to which I had and she said ""do them again"" and I was confused as by now it was 22:30 and I had college in the morning and I said that and she said ""you aren't going home till the bar is spotless"" and being as I didn't want to lose my job I stayed another 30 mins clean down all the surfaces again and the glasses by the end of it all it was almost midnight and I was exhausted.

A couple days later I get into my probation meeting and they say I'm not fit for the role. 

That's my story sorry for the rant but curious if anyone else has had a similar experience?

Thanks to everyones advice, kindness and support, I'm happy to say, around a week after that post, I completed part 1 of my journey to drop off my passangers! However, after getting to the first beacon, I was already at 79% hull damage (COMPLETELY my fault for no shields), and I made one tiny bump on the beacon after overshooting it (I'm now extremely careful about running into things), and it cancelled all three contracts on the spot... I was in shock, I couldn't be pissed, or sad, I knew there was a possibility and I took the risk, but, hey, I made out with 57 Million Credits lmao. I did a few things in Colonia, it was pretty nice, then I did as one user suggested and bought a new sidewinder only to self-destruct it to get back to the bubble. In total, I think I made over 1500 jumps, with a little less than that for fuel scoops lol, scariest part of the trip was almost falling asleep speeding into a star   after getting out of hyperspace, never pulled my stick as hard as I did right there.

The same person that made me kinda insecure when me and my ex were first starting out (that feeling eventually went away though)

It's been almost 3 months since we broke up and one of the last arguments we had before breaking up was basically about how in the past month she preferred to spend time more with her friends than with me. It got to the point that when me and her best friend (yes the same person that shes with rn) both asked her out for some coffee around the same time, she chose to go with her not me (and this is after almost a month of me virtually not going out with her even though we go to the same campus) which led to said argument. 

Honestly I don't know why I feel so shitty about all this. When we broke up, she explicitly mentioned that it wasn't because of a third person and I believe her to this day (she broke up via text btw which made the situation much more hurtful tbh). But there are other parts of the break up that I can't truly believe her words on it. 

She said that she decided to break up with simply because she fell out of love with me. She explained then explained that she fell out of love because we took things too fast and it turn out that she wasn't ready for a relationship. The fact it took less than two months for her to be in a relationship with somebody new after saying those things really hurt I guess.

The funny thing is after all this I still think of her to this day. I know I've been kinda a dick to her (to the point that she blocked me) and vice versa both during and after the relationship. But I still somehow feel that if we just had an honest open conversation everything we can reconcile yk (as friends at least).

I dunno man, i dunno what to feel anymore.

Chapter 1

I smoothed the crisp linen tablecloth one last time, adjusting the sterling silver candlesticks to perfectly frame the crystal vase of red roses between them. Nine years. Nine years of us, of building a life together, of weathering storms. The dining room in our Connecticut mansion glowed with warm light, casting dancing shadows across the mahogany table set for two.

The anniversary dinner I'd planned was intimate—Mark's favorite beef Wellington, a bottle of the Bordeaux we'd discovered on our honeymoon, and the chocolate soufflé that always made his eyes light up. Nine years deserved celebration, deserved acknowledgment of all we'd overcome together.

I checked my watch again. 7:45 PM. He'd promised to be home by seven.

My phone buzzed with a text. Mark's name flashed on the screen.

\*Emergency at the office. Don't wait up. Sorry.\*

Just like that. No explanation, no promise to make it up to me. The familiar hollow feeling expanded in my chest as I stood alone in our dining room, surrounded by flickering candlelight and cooling food.

""Sorry,"" I whispered to the empty chair across from me, mimicking his dismissive tone. How many nights had I sat like this, making excuses for him? How many times had I convinced myself that his business truly needed him more than I did?

I sank into my chair, pouring myself a glass of the expensive wine. As I raised it to my lips, a buzzing sound from the hallway caught my attention. Mark's phone. He must have forgotten it in his rush to this supposed emergency.

I found it on the console table, screen lighting up with incoming messages. Without thinking, I pressed my thumb to the home button—he'd added my fingerprint years ago, back when we still shared everything.

\*Can't wait to see you tonight. Wearing that red thing you love...\*

My stomach dropped as I stared at the message preview from someone named Lauren Hayes.

Lauren Hayes.

The name was vaguely familiar—someone from his office? My finger hovered over the notification, a voice in my head warning me not to look, that some things couldn't be unseen. But nine years of loyalty, of sacrifice, of standing by him through everything demanded the truth.

I tapped the message.

The screen filled with texts, dozens of them, stretching back months. Explicit messages. Photos no wife should ever see of another woman. Promises and plans.

\*Baby's kicking again. Can't believe we're really doing this!\*

Pregnant. She was pregnant.

My legs gave out, and I slid down against the wall, still clutching his phone as message after message revealed the elaborate betrayal. The candlelight in the dining room continued to flicker, oblivious to the fact that my world was burning down around me.

I didn't cry. Not then. Instead, I methodically read every message, every declaration of love, every plan they'd made—including his promise to leave me once the baby was born. Their baby. While I had grieved the child we'd lost, he had been creating a new family in secret.

The night stretched endlessly as I paced our hallways, his phone clutched in my hand like evidence at a crime scene. Sleep was impossible. My mind raced through every moment of our marriage, reframing each memory through this new, terrible lens.

By dawn, I had screenshots of everything. Months of messages. Plans for their future. His complaints about me. Her smug assurances that she would be a better partner, a better mother than I could ever be.

As the first light of morning filtered through our bedroom windows, something hardened inside me. The shock and pain crystallized into something else entirely—cold, clear resolve.

Nine years I had given him. Nine years of supporting his family's failing business with my parents' money. Nine years of standing by him when his parents treated me with thinly veiled contempt. Nine years of rebuilding myself after we lost our baby—a loss he seemed to forget within weeks.

I stared at my reflection in the bathroom mirror, barely recognizing the hollow-eyed woman looking back at me. This would be the last time Mark Jennings made me feel worthless.

This would be the last time I was anyone's doormat.

Chapter 2

I watched the first rays of sunlight filter through the blinds, casting thin golden lines across the bedroom floor. I hadn't slept. How could I? Mark's phone sat beside me on the nightstand, a digital Pandora's box of betrayal. Every time the screen lit up with another message from Lauren, I felt a fresh wave of nausea.

At 6:30 AM, I made the call.

""Julia? It's me. I need you."" My voice sounded strange to my own ears—hollow yet somehow steadier than I expected.

""Em? What's wrong?"" Julia's voice was thick with sleep, but I could already hear her shifting, fully alert.

""Mark's having an affair."" The words hung in the air between us. ""She's pregnant.""

A sharp intake of breath. ""I'll be there in forty minutes. Don't do anything. Don't talk to him. And Em? This isn't your fault.""

The line went dead. I sat on the edge of the bed, staring at my wedding ring. Nine years encapsulated in a simple platinum band. Nine years of what I now realized was monumental self-deception.

True to her word, Julia arrived forty minutes later, carrying a cardboard tray with two large coffees. Her dark hair was pulled back in a hasty ponytail, her normally impeccable appearance slightly rumpled, but her eyes were sharp and focused. She didn't waste time with platitudes.

""Show me everything,"" she said, handing me a coffee.

I passed her Mark's phone. ""I've already sent screenshots to myself.""

Julia scrolled through the messages, her expression hardening with each swipe. Occasionally, she'd mutter something under her breath—legal terms, I realized. She was already building a case.

""This Lauren,"" she finally said, looking up. ""You know her?""

""I think she works in the marketing department at Jennings Industries. I've met her at company functions."" My stomach twisted as I remembered Lauren's overly friendly smile, how she'd complimented my dress at last year's Christmas party while she was sleeping with my husband.

Julia set the phone down and took my hands in hers. ""Emily, listen to me. We're going to handle this methodically. First, we document everything. Then, we investigate. I want to know exactly what we're dealing with before we make any moves.""

""The Jennings family business—"" I started.

""—is propped up by your family's money,"" Julia finished firmly. ""I remember the bailout. I advised against it, if you recall.""

I did recall. Three years into our marriage, when Jennings Industries was on the verge of bankruptcy, I'd convinced my parents to invest millions. I remembered sitting in the bank, signing over trust documents, feeling proud that I could save Mark's family legacy. Mark had stood beside me, his hand on my shoulder, while his parents watched impassively from across the table.

""I need to know how deep this goes,"" I said, my voice strengthening. ""I need to know if this was always the plan—to use me, my family's money, my connections.""

Julia nodded, already tapping on her phone. ""I know a private investigator. Discreet, thorough. He can audit the company's finances, trace Lauren's history with Mark."" She looked up, her eyes softening slightly. ""Are you sure you want to go down this road? Once we start—""

""I'm sure,"" I interrupted. The numbness was wearing off, being replaced by something else—something cold and clarifying. ""I've spent nine years being the perfect wife, the perfect daughter-in-law. I lost our child, and he barely gave me time to grieve before he was back at work, leaving me alone."" My voice cracked slightly. ""And now I find out he's having a baby with someone else? While hiding behind 'work emergencies'?""

Julia squeezed my hand. ""Then we'll make sure you walk away with everything you deserve.""

As the morning light strengthened, casting our shadows long across the hardwood floors, we began to plan. The private investigator would start immediately. Julia would discreetly reach out to my father about the company investments. And I would continue to play the role of the unsuspecting wife—for now.

What Mark didn't know, what he could never have anticipated, was that the woman he'd systematically broken down over nine years was about to rise from the ashes of his betrayal. And this time, I wouldn't be the one getting burned.

Chapter 3

The morning after my world imploded, Julia and I sat at my kitchen island, surrounded by laptops, notepads, and half-empty coffee mugs. Outside, rain pattered against the windows, matching my mood, but inside, a storm of a different kind was brewing.

""Every message needs to be documented,"" Julia said, her lawyer voice in full effect as she created a meticulous digital trail. ""Timestamps, locations, content—everything.""

I nodded, mechanically forwarding screenshots from my phone to my laptop. Each image was a fresh wound—Mark promising Lauren a weekend in the Hamptons while telling me he had a business conference; Mark discussing baby names while I still kept a small box of infant clothes in our attic from the child we'd lost.

""Look at this,"" Julia said, turning her screen toward me. Lauren's Instagram page filled the screen—private, but Julia had found a workaround. ""She's been flaunting gifts from him for months.""

I scrolled through images of Lauren wearing diamond earrings identical to ones I'd found on our credit card statement—the ones Mark had claimed were a birthday gift for his mother. There she was, posing in front of restaurants where Mark had claimed to be dining with clients, a Cartier bracelet prominently displayed on her wrist.

""We need to download everything,"" I said, my voice steadier than I felt. ""Bank statements, credit card bills, property documents—everything that shows how my family's money has been supporting his lifestyle... and hers.""

Julia's fingers flew across her keyboard. ""Already on it. I'm creating a secure cloud folder that only you and I can access."" She paused, looking up at me with concern. ""Em, you need to tell your parents.""

The thought made my stomach clench. My parents had always been supportive of my marriage, even when they had reservations about the Jennings family's business practices. They'd trusted my judgment—trusted that I knew what I was doing when I convinced them to invest millions in saving Jennings Industries.

""I know,"" I whispered.

Two hours later, my parents' car pulled into our circular driveway. I watched from the window as my father, Richard Carter, emerged first—tall, silver-haired, his face already set in the expression I recognized from difficult business negotiations. My mother, Elizabeth, clutched his arm, her worried eyes scanning the house as if she could see through walls to where I stood.

Julia squeezed my shoulder. ""I'll be right here.""

The moment my mother saw my face, she knew. She crossed the room and wrapped me in her arms without a word, the familiar scent of her perfume bringing tears to my eyes for the first time since I'd discovered Mark's betrayal.

""What's happened?"" my father asked, his voice gentle but firm.

I led them to the living room where Julia had prepared our evidence—printed screenshots, financial documents, and a timeline of Mark's deception laid out on the coffee table.

""Mark is having an affair,"" I said, the words still bitter on my tongue. ""She's pregnant. And I have reason to believe he's been using Carter money to fund it.""

My father's face darkened as he examined the evidence. My mother covered her mouth with her hand, tears welling in her eyes.

""All those late nights at the office,"" I continued, my voice growing stronger. ""All those business emergencies. He was with her. Building a life with her. While I was here, believing in our marriage, believing in him.""

""We'll freeze everything,"" my father said immediately, already reaching for his phone. ""Every dollar of Carter investment in Jennings Industries.""

""Not yet,"" Julia interjected. ""We need to be strategic. If we move too quickly, Mark will know Emily's onto him.""

I took a deep breath. ""I have a plan.""

The next morning, with Julia's help, I drafted a corporate memo on Jennings Industries letterhead—a skill I'd perfected during the years I'd worked alongside Mark in the early days of our marriage. The memo detailed an urgent internal audit of six key subsidiaries—all primarily funded by Carter capital.

""This will trigger an automatic review of all financial channels,"" I explained to Julia as we finalized the document. ""The Carter investments will be flagged for verification, effectively freezing them until the 'audit' is complete.""

""And Mark won't suspect you're behind it?"" Julia asked.

I smiled grimly. ""Mark stopped seeing me as a threat years ago. That's his mistake.""

As I pressed send on the forged memo, my phone lit up with a text from Mark:

\*Working late again tonight. Don't wait up.\*

Little did he know, his carefully constructed house of cards was about to come crashing down—and I would be the one holding the match.

Chapter 4

The charity gala was a sea of black ties and glittering gowns, the grand ballroom of the Westchester Country Club transformed into a showcase of Connecticut's elite. I stood at the edge of it all, a champagne flute clutched in my hand like a prop in a play I no longer wanted to perform..........

I’m teaming up with a friend to help out small businesses, solo creators, or anyone who needs a decent-looking website but doesn’t have the budget (or patience) to hire an agency.

We both enjoy designing and building things from scratch, so we’re taking on a few people this month who might need:

A clean 1–2 page website (no templates, no drag-and-drop tools — everything hand-coded)

Custom design elements or visuals made just for your use

A site that actually looks like someone cared while making it


This isn’t some big company thing. It’s just the two of us, doing this more for the love of the craft (and yeah, to build our body of work). In return, we ask for something simple, maybe a meal, a cup of coffee, or just a kind word we can screenshot for our portfolio. Nothing fancy. (Fine even if you don't have a penny ❤️)

If you’re someone with a side hustle, a small shop, a cause you care about, or even an idea you want to share with the world, and need a simple site for it, drop a DM or comment here.

We’re taking just 1–2 people at a time so we can give each one proper attention. Happy to chat more if you're unsure.

I feel like I've hit the end of my road with my journey with a plant-based diet. For the last two months, I've been dealing with a histamine intolerance.. which is not something I've ever dealt with before. I've always had food allergies (soy, tree nuts.. gluten intolerance... that kind of gig) and I had allergy shots for a variety of stuff when I was young. I was able to eat foods I was once allergic to at the peak of my veganism. I fell in love with tofu, I made cashew cheese all the time, I adore edamame.. I had to still avoid some other nuts I was allergic to (almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts, etc) and couldn't drink soy milk. Whatever nbd. 

Anyways, histamine intolerance. -- Seemingly out of nowhere, I started having really extreme responses to the foods I was eating on a daily basis. My throat felt like it was closing, IBS symptoms galore, skin rashes, nose running like a faucet, etc.. I've been doing all that I can do to keep myself sustained but I've had to cut out some of the best fucking vegetables and fruits from my life to try to fix what's going on. Tomatoes, eggplant, citrus, bananas, chocolate, coffee, vinegar, avocado, spinach... like... you get the point. The list keeps going and it just gets more depressing to continue reading things off lol. So my only options for food right now are cycling through beans/lentils, kale/collards/swiss chard/ arugula, cauliflower/broccoli, whatever potato option I want that night, quinoa/brown rice/ millet/ sorghum .... and that's it. It's fucking depressing. Oh! And I can eat apples, mangoes and blueberries. 

I've had to pull up most of my garden (my fave hobby) because it was all eggplants and tomatoes and I'd started my garden before my gut went haywire. I've got all of these big, beautiful foods I can't eat. I just look at them and get sad. 

................

  
And because I'm not able to get a variety of foods to help my gut, the issue just persists. In some ways it's gotten better, in some ways it's gotten worse... but the end result is me listening to my body and bringing fish back in and seeing how that goes. I know there are some high histamine fish/shellfish and I'll be avoiding those for now.. but I need more out of my life and my diet. 

It's weird to me how this histamine intolerance served as a wake-up moment in my life. I've been going back and reading old journal entries about how tired I am all the fucking time, I'm reflecting on my day to day life where if I am between meals, my brain gets cloudy and my memory is ass. My periods have gotten really light, which, while beneficial to a degree, it feels almost like when you know you've got to shit and only a little shit comes out.. but you're still full of shit. lol. You're welcome. -- I've also realized how much of my life I am spending focusing on food, what I'm eating, when I need to eat, how much I need to eat to function and it's just never enough. I've been chasing a high for at least two years now. (The high being how good everything feels when you first switch to a fully plant-based diet.) 

I was one of those people who studied the nutrition quite deeply so I could give myself and my husband a solid foundation for our health. I wound up healing some of our worst ailments when we first switched over. But now both of us are sick and tired of being sick and tired... which is right back where we were to begin with. 

  
So.... 

I have nothing negative to say about vegans or veganism as a whole. This just my experience with it. I've learned a lot from being on a plant-based diet and my morals/ethics have been broadened.. but it's time to broaden them some more and simplify my life.   
I need my health back. 

This week we are introducing fish back into our diets. I don't know how I feel about cow and chicken yet, so that is something that future me can deal with.. But we are starting with fish and going from there.. 

Thanks for reading.. I just wanted to get this off my chest with a group of strangers.

1ltwxoh,https://youtu.be/goBY45rVBU0,Mobile Productivity: Embracing the Pocket Office,"While many think of smartphones as a distraction or doom-scrolling devices, the smartphone just might be the ultimate mobile productivity tool of our era.

Most people only scratch the surface of their device’s capabilities for productivity. In this article, we will explore ways to use your “pocket office” to greatly increase your productivity.

# Essential Mobile Productivity Apps Toolkit

Here are the 6 key programs/apps that I feel most people need to work effectively for both desk and mobile productivity:

1. Task management system
2. Calendar
3. Email
4. CRM
5. Note-taking app
6. Cloud storage for seamless file access

When choosing the apps that I build my workflows in, I ensure that they will work across all my devices – my desktop, laptop, tablets, and smartphone. This way, I can work from any device from any location.

# Distraction Defense Strategies

Yes, smartphones can be a distraction. To make sure my smartphone use is productive, I turn off all notifications except for calendar appointments to stop interruptions and preserve focus. Instead of mindless scrolling when I am on my phone during the day, I have set productive things that I work on. (Cute dog videos can wait until my entertainment time in the evening.)

# Found Time

One of the biggest benefits of a smartphone is that they are always with you, in a pocket or purse. This means when you have some “found time” you can call up one of your mobile productivity apps and do a few tasks. Some examples of “found time” can include:

* Waiting rooms – doctors, dentists, passport processing, etc.
* Travel – there is a lot of wasted waiting time around travel. While waiting in airports or traveling on airplanes, you can get a lot of tasks cleaned up using your phone
* Meetings – waiting for a meeting to start? Use your phone to answer a couple of emails while you wait for your client or the rest of your team to show up

# Useful Things I Do On My Phone

Here are a few of the productive things I use my phone for when I am out of the office:

1. **Meeting Prep:** While waiting in a coffee shop for my prospect meeting, I prepare for the meeting by calling up my contact’s information in [my CRM](https://captaintime.com/less-annoying-crm-review-a-captain-time-exploration/) and on LinkedIn. I also review their recent social media posts to catch up on what they are doing and what is important to them. This improves our communication at the meeting and helps me increase my sales meeting conversions.
2. **Email:** Email is a great thing to catch up on while you are out because most email replies only take a minute or two. I use voice-to-text on my smartphone to quickly dictate my message and send it. This way, when I get back to the office, I don’t have an stuffed email inbox waiting for me.
3. **Take Notes**: My best ideas come to me when I am out and away from the office, often while I am walking my dogs or exercising at the gym. Instead of trying to remember the important idea, I take quick voice-to-text notes on my phone using [UpNote. ](https://captaintime.com/upnote-review-better-note-taking-and-organization/)
4. **Tasks:** I review my tasks and projects using [xTiles](https://captaintime.com/notion-alternative-captain-times-xtiles-review/) on my smartphone. I can often complete a few simple tasks while waiting for clients for a meeting.
5. Workshop Outlines: When planning a new workshop, I start with an outline. I can easily create an outline for a new workshop using UpNote on my smartphone and quickly turn it into a stunning presentation later using [Gamma.](https://try.gamma.app/hsrzkvw19t8t)
6. **Planning**: Being out of your office with some found time, is a great time to give some thought to planning your next day or your next week on your smartphone using your [time blocking calendar](https://captaintime.com/google-calendar-time-blocking/) and your task management system.
7. **Brainstorming (AI):** AI has made it easy to brainstorm using your phone. Use apps like [Claude](https://captaintime.com/claude-ai-review-captain-times-brainstorming-partner/) or [Perplexity](https://captaintime.com/beyond-google-captain-times-perplexity-ai-review/) to brainstorm your ideas.
8. **Backup Systems:** I am a Regional Leader for Bx Networking and am responsible for three in-person networking groups in my area. While one of our team members brings a laptop to check people into the meeting and take registrations, I make sure I can also log into the registration system using my phone, so if a team member were ill or delayed in any way, I can just take attendance and registrations using my smartphone.
9. **Learning:** Found time while you are out is a great time for the learning and professional development you want to do, but don’t get time for in your normal busy workday. For my online courses [“Time Management: Step by Step”](https://captaintime.com/courses/time-management-step-by-step) and [“Level Up Your Follow-Up”](https://captaintime.com/courses/level-up-your-follow-up-masterclass) I made sure they work easily on mobile and also include audio podcasts for each course so people could listen on their commute, while exercising, or while walking their dog. So load up your favorite learning podcast or an online course for a skill you want to master to free up professional development learning time each week.

# Preparing for Mobile Productivity

Here are some tips on how to set yourself up for success with smartphone productivity.

1. **Check Access** – Have you ever tried to use an app while out, only to find it is asking you for a password you may not have with you? Make sure you have all the productivity apps you want to use installed, and you can access all key apps on your phone.  Log in to each app you will need beforehand to ensure it works. Choose apps that work across all your devices. For me, I use a combination of Windows and Android apps. Sometimes I find apps I like, but I refuse to use them unless they have both a Windows and Android version.
2. **Choose Small, Quick Tasks** – While it might be possible to run your entire business on a smartphone, some tasks are better on the big screens. Choose short, simple tasks, like the ones I mentioned above to make it easy to be productive on your smartphone instead of struggling with complex tasks on a small screen.

1ltwwln,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1ltwwln/explore_if_the_delonghi_truebrew_coffee_maker/,Explore if the De'Longhi TrueBrew Coffee Maker Delivers Excellence in Our Detailed Review,"Testing coffee machines is one of my favorite activities as a self-proclaimed caffeine enthusiast. The **De'Longhi CAM51025MB TrueBrew Drip Coffee Maker** certainly caught my attention with its extensive feature set and promises of fresh, personalized coffee brewing. After using this coffee maker daily for a month, I’ve got plenty to say, both good and not-so-good, so let’s dive in.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This coffee maker exudes elegance with its sleek stainless-steel finish, making it a stylish addition to my kitchen counter. The compact dimensions—15”D x 12”W x 15.8”H—ensure it doesn't hog all the kitchen space. I appreciated the practical design elements like the removable water reservoir, which made refilling super convenient. Though it looks modern and premium, it is a bit hefty at 19 pounds. For some, that weight might make it challenging to move around, especially if you’re like me and like to rearrange your appliances occasionally.

**Features Galore**  
The coffee maker is packed with functionality, boasting an integrated burr grinder, five brew styles (ranging from light to espresso-style), and six serving sizes from 3 oz to 24 oz. I found the Over-Ice option perfect for my late-afternoon iced coffee fix during warmer days. It truly shines with its fully automatic operation and touchscreen interface, which makes it incredibly user-friendly. However, the touchscreen can occasionally be unresponsive if your hands are wet, which was a slight annoyance for me.  

[Grab De'Longhi CAM51025MB at the best price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0f3zsvppg/)

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
What I genuinely liked about the machine is how intuitive it is to operate. All it takes is pouring in your beans, selecting your preferences, and pressing Brew—simple and efficient! Plus, the proprietary Bean Extract Technology ensures optimal flavor extraction, making each cup feel artisan-crafted. Cleaning, on the other hand, is a mix of pros and cons. While the reusable filter and removable parts cut down on single-use waste, they require frequent cleaning to maintain their performance. I didn’t mind this, but I know some may find it tedious compared to machines with disposable pods.

**Performance and Taste**  
In terms of delivering consistent, high-quality coffee, this machine gets it mostly right. My morning routine improved dramatically thanks to its programmable auto-on feature, which ensured I woke up to freshly brewed coffee that tasted rich and aromatic. The built-in burr grinder does a fantastic job of grinding beans evenly—a noticeable improvement in flavor compared to pre-ground coffee. However, the grinder is not whisper-quiet. I startled my dog during early mornings, so it’s worth keeping in mind if you have light sleepers in your home.

**Positives**  
- Built-in conical burr grinder for freshly ground beans.  
- Multiple serving sizes and brew strength settings.  
- Environmentally friendly with zero-waste functionality.  

**Critiques**  
- On the heavier side at 19 pounds, restricting portability.  
- Touchscreen can be unresponsive if fingers are wet.  

**Product Comparisons**  
Stacking this against competitors like the Breville Bambino Plus or the Keurig K-Elite, the De'Longhi TrueBrew stands out for its whole bean integration and zero-waste design. The Breville might excel for die-hard espresso lovers, given its more specialized features, but it doesn’t provide the same drip coffee versatility. Meanwhile, the Keurig is incredibly convenient for pod users but lags behind in coffee taste and eco-friendliness. If flavor and sustainability matter to you, this De'Longhi coffee machine delivers better value.

**Price Worthiness**  
Though not a bargain-level product, the coffee maker justifies its cost with its robust features, durable build, and high-quality brews. Comparable alternatives don’t necessarily bring more to the table in terms of coffee quality or functionality. For what it offers, I’d say this is a smart buy if you value freshly ground coffee made to your exact preferences.

1ltwu33,https://www.reddit.com/r/sspx/comments/1ltwu33/torn_apart_inside/,Torn apart inside...,"Hi everyone!
So, my friend asked me how was the TLM and I said it was good and I went to the SSPX priory a few times. I told him, ""Man! I felt something good out there! You have to come and see some time!""
And a couple hours later we were texting each other, and he said, ""Hey man! I support your explotation of SSPX. Maybe it is where God is leading you, I cannot know any better.""
We had a good conversation after that.
A couple of weeks later, we were texting again , and ge brought up the SSPX again( at this point I wish I had my mouth shut when I told him I went to the priory). He reached out the local archdiocese to clarify if a Catholic can attend the SSPX Mass. They gave him a vague answer. He showed me an email...
Ok, I knew they would not tell him anything I knew already before. 
Than we met for a cup of coffee and started talking about the SSPX again. My friend is a devout Catholic, I love and respect this guy, he is knowledgeable, and whatnot. I told him that Archbishop Lefebrve signed 14 out of 16 Vatican II documents. He responded that Lefebrve back out from it pretty fast, JPII( I am sorry, but I cannot call this man a saint) gavr him time to come back and repent, and he also promised Lefebrve two( or four?) bishops in two years...
Then, of course, we talked about the TLM. I said that this Mass was orgsnically developed. He said it wasn't. He brought up some ""experts"" from YT( to which , of course, he did not provide the links). He also said, ""Apostles did not say the TLM!""
He also swears  by GIRM and keeps blaming the laity for not living out the prescriptions of Vatican II.
Next day, after the Mass, I told him that we should close that topic because I didn't think we were heading anywhere and we would not find the right answer, abd I just wanted to make my peace with with God, and be faithful to Eternal Church. 
I love and respect what SSPX does and I did not hear anything anti-Catholic and anti-Vatican comkng from their side...
And my friend's overseeing of my religious journey( I am a fresh convert from Orthodox Church) and his ""I know it all, you should do this for your benefit"" vibe( all of these from my perception, not trying to badmouth him here!)
Make me feel so empty and torn apart. I feel like I have to police my every move, my every word and my every thought with him...
What you guys think?
Sorry for the long post. Hope it makes some sense. 
Have a wonderful one!

1ltwtm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1ltwtm0/should_i_message_an_ex_friend_after_10_years/,Should I message an ex friend after 10 years?,"So I had a best friend through high school and we were very close. After high school though we had some conflicts, and I mean, it was 10 years ago and I was a child… I can’t fully remember them but I remember feeling like this friend smothered me a little bit at the time. 

From what I understand, the friendship dwindled with the dynamic of me not initiating contact enough and it always being my friend  and then it was eventually killed off entirely by one big argument. 

I then went off to university and moved cities and that was it. 

I’m now 29 and have lived many lives since then. I’ve been diagnosed with adhd, got two degrees, worked 13 jobs and recently had my first child and moved back to my home town. 

I don’t know what has come over me since, if it’s because I moved back home or had a kid. But I’ve been remembering and reflecting upon this friendship and feeling as though I miss this person. I did find her TikTok a few months ago and I remember seeing her talk on this video made me laugh and it reminded me of how funny she was. Being older, I’ve also realised how valuable friendships are and I’m regretting letting such decent friends such as her, go. I know I was terrible at messaging people back then, I was immature and riddled with undiagnosed adhd. A friendship like hers is one I would now appreciate much more. 

I know she has a kid too, a year before me. 

What do you say people? Should I be brave and reach out? If I do it’ll only be a causal message like “hey, I came across Xyz and it reminded me of you, unsure why we stopped being friends but it would be nice to catch up sometime, let me know if you fancy a coffee?”

1ltwsks,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ltwsks/aitah_for_hitting_my_boyfriend_back_after_he_hit/,AITAH for hitting my boyfriend back after he hit me first?,"Hi everyone. I think I know the answer to this.. this is really long and I’m sorry.. yesterday, my (ex) boyfriend (31) and I (28) got into a fight. I was upset because I felt like he didn’t care about me, he didn’t want me anymore and I felt he wasn’t attracted to me anymore. I asked him about these things while we were at his house. We were getting ready to go play Pokemon go for the community day event from 2-5. I was just feeling very insecure and unwanted.. so I kept asking him if he even still wanted me, if he found me attractive still, did I get too fat for him? He would just respond like “Can we just go? I just want to go play Pokemon.” I told him, yes we can go. But I just want some reassurance about our relationship. I was crying by this point because he was just dismissing my feelings. He got mad and kept saying “can you just stop? Let’s just go play Pokemon. That’s what I want to do.” I asked him again can he please just comfort and reassure me so I don’t feel like he hates me. He said “I don’t know how, can we just go?” So I gave him examples of things he could say if he did still want me. He responded by saying “why does it always have to be what you want me to say?”  I was just trying to give him examples since he said he didn’t know how.. 

Finally, we left for his truck and I’m still trying to get him to talk to me. But he’s literally ignoring me, too worried about catching Eevees. I said to him “it feels like you care more about this game than me.” He ignored me. I kept trying to talk to him and he told me to stop talking shit to him, that he wants to play his game. So I’m still really upset and crying because.. I don’t understand why my boyfriend can’t just comfort me? Why can’t he just tell me I’m overthinking, that he does love me, that he does want me? Does he think I’m not attractive anymore? Why wouldn’t he show me his phone to prove to me he’s not cheating on me? I have to follow all his rules, give him my phone passcode but I can’t have his? Why can’t he stop playing this game for two mins and help me feel better? To give reassurance? Maybe I’m wrong for expecting that? 

We got to the park and I’m still upset. I’m still asking for him to talk to me, to say something to give me 2 mins of his time so we can talk about how I’m feeling. He said ok and I couldn’t even get a thought out before he got out of the vehicle and started walking away… to the Pokemon go. I finally got out of the truck and asked him again, can he please give me two mins of his time to talk and give me reassurance? He just told me I was trying to ruin his day. I wasn’t. I just wanted reassurance from him. We planned on playing Pokemon together, I had no issues with that. But I wanted us to take two mins to talk so I wouldn’t keep bugging him about how I felt and we could enjoy the day. I just wanted him to talk to me. 

So I kept trying to get him to talk to me.. he wouldn’t. He just kept ignoring me and playing the game. I ended up standing in front of him to get him to pay attention and he told me “can you move?” And slightly pushed me out of his way. This kept going on and I eventually asked him “do you even want to be with me anymore?? Because if you don’t just break up with me??!” He said “I don’t know I’m trying to play Pokemon and youre ruining it!” I said “you don’t know if you want to break up with me??” He goes “yeah! I do. Whatever I’m going home since you ruined everything.” I got in front of him again to stop him. He pushed me out of the way. I was immature and grabbed his hat.. so he wouldn’t walk away. Things escalated so quickly when I was just trying to get reassurance. Things felt off with us and I needed reassurance. So after I took his hat, he asked for it back and I said no can you just talk to me? What the heck is going on??  He ended up hitting my arm trying to get me to release the hat. Like, not punched me in the side of the arm but he hit me on my forearm pretty hard. It caught me so off guard so I hit him in the face because why are you putting your hands on me? I was wrong for hitting him in the face.. I know. But I just reacted to him hitting me.. once I hit him in the face, he poured ice coffee on me. He started going to his truck and I kept still trying to talk to him like a dumbass. Once we got closer to his truck, he told me to find a way home to get an Uber. We were in a park I didn’t know, I’m still fairly new to the city. He had my car keys. I couldn’t let him leave me there stranded. I have no friends or family here. I tried getting into his truck, he wouldn’t let me. So I freaked out.. I got into the bed of his pick up truck trying to get him to stay. He didn’t. He drove through the city with me in the back of his pick up truck crying. He drove aggressively and wouldn’t stop. He’d slam the brakes to get me to fall and hit myself against the back window. 

After 15mins of driving, he went to another park and told me he was calling the cops so they could “come get me.” Well, the cops pulled up and put him cuffs and into the back of the cop car. I was in the back bawling my eyes out because.. what the fuck just happened? I just wanted reassurance and comfort , I just waned two mins of his time to get him to talk to me. Apparently they got 911 calls about me being in the back of his truck while he was driving. So like 5 cop cars came. After that all ended, they let me walk to my car (we were two streets away from my car.. he could’ve taken me there instead of some park and calling the cops) they let him go too, but first asked me if I wanted him arrested. I said no, I don’t. 

Later in the evening.. we started texting each other. He said I’m a disgusting, selfish shitty person for hitting him. That he never hit me. He claims he pushed me. But he did hit me. Maybe he tried pushing me, but he did hit me. I’ve never hit anyone before. I was raised that if I hit a man, they hit back. I only reacted to something that happened to me. He kept calling me delusional and disgusting because I hit him. I was wrong for hitting him, I know. But I was reacting to being hit. 

We did break up. But now he’s just calling me all these names, saying I’m a shitty person and disgusting person and I ruined the relationship by hitting him. That I showed my true colors. I didn’t hit him just to hit him.. I hit him because I got hit … yeah sure, I should’ve and could’ve walked away. But I’m in love and stupid. 

Am I wrong for hitting him back? I mean, yeah I could’ve walked away but if someone hits me… don’t I have the right to defend myself? He said he poured coffee on me because he can’t hit me. “Unfortunately i can’t hit you so the only thing i could do was pour the coffee on you.” 

He told me this was all my fault, that i made a scene across the city, that he hopes I enjoyed seeing him hand cuffed in the back of a cop car, that I got what I wanted which was to ruin the day. None of that is true.. all I wanted was to be reassured about our relationship. I see why he couldn’t reassure me. He obviously doesn’t like me. :( ",0,1751901274.0,AITAH,33,0.33,False

Some improvement and some days where I feel okay (if I keep on my digestive enzymes and ib guard before meals). Today I had a normal bowel movement upon waking, took my ib guard, ate some toast (which doesn’t usually bother me) and a few blackberries, and some sips of my coffee (all things I have most days without issues). I ended up having 2 more bowel movements within an hour. Both were loose or D, not solid. Didn’t eat crazy over the weekend or anything. Now my abdomen just aches. I had some gas overnight and feelings of bloat but I also ate broccoli (again, usually okay if I take my enzymes). Just feel gross over all and borderline like I could have another bowel movement. I’ve also had a bit of extra anxiety over the past 24 hours so wondering if that’s contributing to this. Anyway, just wondering if others experience this general abdominal ache after several urgent bowel movements. I was feeling so much better so I’m discouraged. Have an appt with my GI but first available is end of August.",1,1751901238.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

1ltwq7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1ltwq7s/best_garage_floor_treatment_for_home_gym_game_room/,Best garage floor treatment for home gym / game room,"We will not be parking any cars in our 2-car garage (approx 400sqft). It is about 50 years old so lots of oil staining, hairline cracks, and paint splatters which I am slowly getting rid of. I have concrete patch which I will get all the cracks fixed up in the next week. There are some chunks missing in the sides of the expansion joints (I want to keep the joints for long term health) and I will also patch those missing chunks. 

My goal is to convert the garage into a simple home gym and gaming room for my kids so there will be no extreme weight or heat on the floor. Just things like strength training equipment (but not too heavy) and sofa/TV/coffee table sort of things. 

I initially wanted to redo the floor with DIY epoxy and flake but am concerned in 10-20 years (or maybe sooner!) it will look like a bubbled chipped mess. That being said, I’m not sure what my alternatives are that are below $1000 cost (ideal spend $500-$600). 

I really just want to durably hide all the visual inconsistencies, and make it usable for the family and comfy on feet without socks. I worry I am overthinking this and should just get some area rugs and gym area will have the impact padding anyway. 

Any DIY floor treatment options in the sub $1K are most appreciated and welcome!! ",1,1751901122.0,HomeImprovement,1,1.0,False

This is just a taste… Upvote if you liked it and comment if you want the full story — it gets even better!,"Three years. One thousand and ninety-five days of trying to be the perfect wife, and this was my reward divorce papers on our anniversary.

I stared at Stefan's perfect signature on the last page, the ink still fresh. He must have signed them this morning, probably right after I'd left that stupid handmade card on his desk. The one I'd spent hours making, like a fool who still believed in fairy tales.

The anniversary card I made for my husband Stefan still sat on the kitchen counter, untouched. Three years of marriage summed up in a handmade gesture he couldn't even bother to open. I'd spent hours on it last night, writing words I thought mattered.

My coffee had gone cold. Funny how you notice small things when your world is falling apart.

""Sign here. And here."" Stefan's voice was distant, businesslike. He'd laid out the divorce papers like contracts at one of his meetings, sticky tabs marking each signature line. ""The highlighted sections need initials.""

My hands wouldn't stop shaking. ""You're doing this today? On our anniversary?""

""Camille."" He sighed, that familiar sound of disappointment I'd heard so many times before. ""There's no point dragging this out.""

The morning sun streamed through our kitchen windows, catching the diamond on my finger. Three carats, princess cut, picked out by his mother. ""Not your style, dear, but it's what a Rodriguez wife should wear,"" she'd said at the time. Like everything else in my life, it had never really been mine.

""Is there someone else?""

The question hung in the air between us. Stefan straightened his tie, Italian silk, the blue one I'd given him for Christmas. ""Yes.""

One word. That's all it took to erase three years of trying to be perfect.

""How long?""

""Two months."" He wouldn't meet my eyes. ""She came back to town and...""

""Two months,"" I repeated. All those late nights at the office. The missed dinners. The way he'd stopped kissing me goodbye in the mornings. ""Were you ever going to tell me? Or just keep lying until the papers were ready?""

""I didn't want to hurt you.""

A laugh bubbled up, harsh, unfamiliar. ""That's thoughtful of you.""

My hand knocked against my coffee mug, sending it crashing to the floor. Dark liquid spread across the pristine tiles, staining the grout I'd scrubbed on hands and knees last week because his mother was coming to visit.

""Let me get that..."" Stefan reached for the paper towels.

""Don't."" My voice cracked. ""Just... don't pretend to care now.""

I bent to pick up the broken pieces. A photo slipped from between the divorce papers, landing face-up in the spilled coffee.

The world stopped.

I knew that smile. Those eyes. That perfectly poised expression that had haunted every family photo since I was twelve.

""Rose?"" My sister's name tasted like poison. ""Your first love was Rose?""

Stefan's silence said everything.

Memories hit like punches to the gut. Rose helping me pick out my wedding dress. Rose giving toasts at our engagement party. Rose calling every week to check on my marriage, to give advice about keeping Stefan happy.

My adopted sister. My parents' golden child. The one they'd chosen to love.

""She never left town, did she?"" The pieces were falling into place. ""She's been here the whole time, waiting. Playing the supportive sister while you both laughed at stupid, naive Camille.""

""It wasn't like that."" Stefan ran his hands through his hair, that gesture I used to find endearing. ""We tried to fight it. But some people are just meant to...""

""If you say 'meant to be' I swear I'll throw this mug at your head."" My fingers tightened around the broken ceramic. ""How long were you together before? Before me?""

He shifted uncomfortably. ""Four years. Until she got the job offer in London.""

Four years. The same time I'd started dating Stefan. The same time Rose had suddenly become my biggest cheerleader, pushing me toward him.

""She set this up,"" I whispered. ""All of it. And I fell for every piece.""

""Camille, you're being dramatic. Rose cares about you.""

""Like she cared when she told my first boyfriend I was damaged goods? Or when she convinced my parents I was too unstable for college?"" The broken mug cut into my palm, but I barely felt it. ""She's been sabotaging me my whole life, and I kept making excuses because that's what good sisters do, right?""

Blood dripped onto the divorce papers. Stefan reached for my hand but I jerked away.

""Don't touch me."" I grabbed a dish towel, wrapping it around my palm. ""Where is she now? Waiting to comfort me through my divorce? Planning your next wedding?""

""She wanted to be here, but I thought it would be better...""

""Better?"" I laughed again, the sound edged with hysteria. ""Yes, you've both been so concerned with what's better for me. Such caring people.""

I picked up the pen, the Mont Blanc he'd given me on our first anniversary. The one Rose had helped him choose.

""Camille, wait. We should talk about this properly.""

I signed every page, my signature perfectly steady. Let them see I wasn't breaking. Let them think they'd won.

""I'm done talking."" I gathered my purse, the signed papers, Rose's photo. ""Done pretending. Done being the good sister, the perfect wife, the daughter who never complains.""

""Where are you going?""

""Away from you. Away from her. Away from everyone who thinks Camille Lewis is someone they can use and discard.""

My phone buzzed, Rose's smiling face lit up the screen. Right on cue, coming to play her part.

I declined the call and walked to the door. Behind me, Stefan called out, ""You can't just leave. We need to discuss arrangements, the house, the accounts...""

""You can have it all."" I turned to face him one last time. ""The house, the cars, the life you built on lies. I don't want anything that reminds me of either of you.""

""Camille, please...""

""Goodbye, Stefan."" I smiled, and something in my expression made him step back. ""Give Rose my love. Tell her thank you, actually.""

""For what?""

""For finally showing me the truth. About her, about you, about who I need to become.""

I walked out of that house, out of that life, leaving bloody fingerprints on the door handle. Let them try to erase those as easily as they'd erased me.

Three years of pretending to be someone I wasn't. Three years of swallowing pain and making excuses for people who never deserved my loyalty.

My phone buzzed again. Rose. Then my mother. Then Stefan. One by one, I blocked them all.

Every connection to the life I thought I had to live.

In my rearview mirror, I caught a glimpse of my reflection. Tears streaked my makeup, blood stained my dress, my hair had come loose from its perfect twist.

I looked nothing like the polished, proper wife Stefan Rodriguez had married.

Chapter 2

Camille's point of view

The house was quiet, too quiet. I slipped in through the side door, locking it softly behind me. The air smelled like lemon polish and roses, just like it always did. It felt strange to be back, like stepping into someone else’s life.

The kitchen was dark except for the faint glow of the fridge light. I crept up the stairs, careful to skip the third step that creaked. Every sound I made felt loud, like the house itself was listening.

When I reached my bedroom door, I stopped. It was open a crack, just like I’d left it all those years ago. Taking a deep breath, I stepped inside and shut the door.

My childhood bedroom hadn't changed in three years. Same pale pink walls, same white furniture, same collection of second-place trophies. Rose's first-place ones used to shine in the room next door.

I stared at my reflection in the vanity mirror, the same one where I'd practiced my wedding makeup three years ago, Rose standing behind me with that perfect smile. Now my mascara was smeared, hair wild, designer dress wrinkled. Mom would have a fit if she saw me like this.

The clock on my nightstand read 10:47 PM. I'd been sitting here for hours, packing what little of my old life I wanted to keep. Amazing how seventeen years in this house fit into one duffel bag.

My phone buzzed again, the twentieth time in an hour. This time it was Mom.

""Camille, this is ridiculous. Come home so we can discuss this like adults. Rose is worried sick...""

I hung up. Of course Rose was worried. Her carefully laid plans were unraveling.

The front door clicked open downstairs. I froze, listening to familiar footsteps on hardwood. The slight tap of heels, the whisper of expensive fabric.

""Camille?"" Mom's voice floated up the stairs. ""Darling, I know you're here. The housekeeper saw your car.""

I should have parked around the block. Should have been smarter, faster, better at disappearing. But I'd never been the clever one, had I? That was Rose's role.

More footsteps. A deeper voice, Dad, probably called home from work to deal with his hysterical younger daughter. Again.

""Princess?"" His voice carried that same gentle tone he'd used when I was twelve, crying about Rose getting my spot in the school play. ""Let's talk about this.""

A third set of footsteps made my blood freeze. Lighter, more graceful. Perfect, like everything else about her.

""Camille?"" Rose's voice dripped concern. ""Sweetie, please. Don't shut us out.""

I looked at the family photo on my dresser, taken the day Rose's adoption was finalized. Mom and Dad beaming, Rose radiant in her new dress, thirteen-year-old me trying to smile through braces and acne. One big happy family.

What a joke.

The memory hit me like a punch to the gut:

\---

""But I've been practicing for months!"" I clutched my script, tears blurring the words. ""Mrs. Bennett said the lead was mine!""

Rose touched my shoulder, gentle as always. ""Oh, sweetie. I didn't mean to take your part. I just... the words came so naturally in the audition. Mrs. Bennett said I had a gift.""

Of course she did. Everyone said Rose had a gift. For music, for acting, for making people love her.

""Maybe..."" Rose's eyes lit up with that special gleam that always meant trouble. ""Maybe you could help me practice? Be my supporting actress? We could make it our sister thing!""

I'd agreed. Because that's what good sisters did. Because saying no to Rose meant disappointed looks from Mom, lectures from Dad about family loyalty.

Opening night, I watched from the wings as Rose brought the audience to tears. Afterward, Mom bought her roses. Dad took us all to dinner.

No one mentioned that I'd written Rose's best lines during our ""practice sessions."" Or that her dramatic monologue had been word-for-word what I'd performed in my original audition.

Rose just had a gift for memorization, that's all.

\---

""Camille Elizabeth Lewis!"" Mom's voice sharpened. ""This behavior is completely unacceptable.""

I opened my bedroom door.

They stood in the hallway like a perfect family portrait, Mom in her designer suit, Dad looking distinguished in his work clothes, Rose wearing concern like the latest fashion trend.

""Hello, sister."" My voice came out steady. ""Shouldn't you be comforting your fiancé?""

Rose's eyes widened. Always the performer. ""Camille, please. Let me explain...""

""Explain what? How you've been sleeping with my husband? Or how you set this whole thing up from the beginning?""

""What is she talking about?"" Dad turned to Rose, who already had tears forming. Perfect, delicate tears that never smeared her makeup.

""She's upset,"" Rose whispered. ""Lashing out. You know how she gets, Daddy.""

""Don't."" My laugh sounded strange, even to me. ""Don't you dare play that card again. Show them the ring, Rose. The one Stefan gave you two months ago while I was supposedly too sick to attend the charity gala.""

Mom gasped. Dad's face darkened. But Rose, Rose's mask slipped for just a second. I saw it this time, that flash of cold calculation behind the concern.

""It wasn't like that,"" she started.

""Really? Then how was it? Explain to everyone how you've been calling me every week, giving me marriage advice while sleeping with my husband. Tell them about all the times you helped me pick out lingerie for anniversaries when Stefan was really working late with you.""

""That's enough!"" Mom stepped forward. ""Rose would never...""

""Never what, Mom? Never lie? Never manipulate? Never steal something that belonged to her sister?"" I pulled out my phone, playing the last voicemail from Stefan.

His voice filled the hallway: ""Rose is my soulmate, Camille. We tried to fight it, but some people are just meant to be together. You have to understand...""

The silence that followed was deafening.

Rose recovered first. ""I never meant to hurt you. We can't help who we love...""

The sound of my palm connecting with her cheek echoed like a gunshot.

""Camille!"" Mom grabbed my arm. ""Have you lost your mind?""

""No,"" I said quietly, watching a red mark bloom on Rose's perfect face. ""For the first time in fourteen years, I'm seeing clearly.""

I walked past them, duffel bag in hand. Behind me, Rose's sobs started, the same performance she'd perfected over years of turning everyone against me.

""Where are you going?"" Dad called after me. ""You can't just walk away from family!""

I paused at the top of the stairs, looking back at my so-called family. Mom comforting Rose, Dad looking torn, and my sister watching me through her tears with eyes that held no warmth at all.

""Family?"" I smiled, and something in my expression made them all step back. ""No, this isn't family. This is a game. And for fourteen years, I've been playing by Rose's rules.""

""Camille, please,"" Rose reached for me, ever the caring sister. ""Let me make this right.""

I caught her wrist before she could touch me. ""You taught me well, big sister. About manipulation. About patience. About waiting for the perfect moment to strike.""

Her eyes widened, real fear this time, not performed.

""Thank you for the lessons,"" I whispered, letting her go. ""Now watch how well I learned them.""

I walked down the stairs, ignoring their calls. In the foyer mirror, I caught one last glimpse of myself, mascara-stained, wild-eyed, finally unchained.

Chapter 3

ROSE'S POINT OF VIEW

I swirled the champagne in my crystal flute, watching the bubbles dance. Victory tasted sweet, just like I'd imagined all these years. The living room of my penthouse apartment overlooked the city where I'd spent twenty years pretending to be the perfect adopted daughter, the loving sister, the supportive friend.

What a joke.

""To freedom,"" I whispered to my reflection in the window. The woman staring back at me smiled, perfect teeth, perfect hair, perfect lies. Just like always.

My phone buzzed again. Another missed call from Stefan. He'd been calling non-stop since Camille walked out, probably worried I'd change my mind now that everything was in the open. Poor, predictable Stefan. Still thinking he was in control of any of this.

I kicked off my Louboutins and sank into the leather couch, letting memories wash over me like warm wine.

\---

The first time I saw Camille Lewis, I hated her.

I was thirteen, fresh out of foster care, desperate to please my new parents. They'd brought me to this massive house with its manicured lawn and marble floors, promising me a fresh start. A real family.

Then this skinny thing with braces and messy hair came bouncing down the stairs, all eager smiles and innocent eyes.

""Hi! I'm Camille. I've always wanted a sister!""

She hugged me right there in the foyer, not caring that my clothes were secondhand or that I smelled like the group home's industrial detergent. Just pure, genuine joy at having a sister.

I wanted to vomit.

Because there she was, this awkward, imperfect girl who had everything I'd spent thirteen years dreaming about. Parents who actually wanted her. A home she belonged in. A future secured by the Lewis family name.

And she didn't even appreciate it properly.

I watched her over dinner that first night, watched how she slouched in her chair and talked with her mouth full. How she didn't know which fork to use for salad. How she laughed too loud and asked too many questions.

""Rose has such lovely manners,"" Mrs. Lewis .... Mom ..... had said, smiling at me. ""Perhaps you could learn from your new sister, Camille.""

That's when I saw it. The first crack in Camille's perfect world. The slight dimming of her smile, the way she sat up straighter, tried harder.

It was beautiful.

\---

My phone buzzed again, pulling me back to the present. Stefan's face lit up my screen, his fifth call in an hour. With a sigh, I answered.

""Darling, you're being needy.""

""Rose."" His voice was rough. Had he been drinking? ""She's gone. Really gone. Blocked my number, cleaned out her closet...""

""Isn't that what we wanted?"" I kept my voice gentle, soothing. The same tone I'd used all those times I'd counseled Camille through her marital problems. Problems I'd carefully orchestrated.

""I just... the way she looked at me...""

""Stefan, sweetheart."" I let steel edge into my sweetness. ""Are you having second thoughts? After everything we've been through?""

""No! No, of course not. I love you. I've always loved you.""

""Then stop calling me about your ex-wife. It's pathetic.""

I hung up, tossing the phone aside. Men were so predictably weak. Even Stefan, who I'd spent four years grooming before pushing him toward Camille, still needed constant management.

But he'd served his purpose. Just like everyone else in my carefully constructed game.

The family photo on my mantel caught my eye, my adoption day. I stood in the center, of course. Always the center. Camille pushed to the edge of the frame, trying so hard to smile through her insecurities.

God, it had been easy. Almost too easy.

A little whisper here about how Camille was unstable. A few concerned conversations with Mom about how worried I was about my dear sister's emotional state. Casual mentions to Dad about how Camille seemed to be struggling with basic adult responsibilities.

Fourteen years of careful groundwork, positioning myself as the responsible daughter, the achievable dream, while slowly crushing Camille's confidence, her relationships, her sense of self.

The college rejection was particularly inspired, if I do say so myself. All it took was one tearful conversation with Mom about finding Camille's ""secret"" diary, filled with dark thoughts and destructive plans. Plans I'd written myself, of course, in Camille's childish handwriting that I'd spent months practicing to forge.

Suddenly, their precious younger daughter wasn't ready for college. Needed time to ""find herself."" Needed to stay close to home where they could watch her.

Where I could watch her.

I took another sip of champagne, savoring the moment. Because this, this was what I'd really wanted all along. Not Stefan, he was just a useful pawn. Not the Lewis fortune, though that would come in time.

No, what I wanted was to watch perfect, precious Camille finally break. To see her realize that everything she thought she had family, love, security, had been built on my lies.

My phone buzzed with a text from Mom: ""Rose, darling, please come over. Your father and I need to talk about what happened.""

I smiled, already planning my performance. The tearful confusion, the reluctant confession about Stefan's pursuit, the gentle concern about Camille's mental state.

By the time I was done, they'd be thanking me for protecting them from their unstable daughter all these years.

Standing up, I walked to my closet, selecting the perfect outfit for my next scene. Something subtle but expensive. Grieving sister, not celebrating victor.

The massive walk-in closet had been Camille's wedding gift to me. ""So you'll always have space for your amazing fashion sense,"" she'd said, hugging me tight.

Even then, even after years of watching me steal every spotlight, every opportunity, every scrap of parental approval, she'd still loved me. Still trusted me.

Idiot.

I pulled out a cream cashmere sweater, remembering how Camille used to borrow my clothes in high school. How I'd wait until she had something important, a date, a presentation, an interview, then suddenly remember I needed that exact outfit.

She'd always given them back without argument. Always apologized for the inconvenience.

Always tried so hard to be the perfect sister.

My reflection caught my eye, and for a moment, just a moment, I saw something ugly there. Something that looked like the scared, angry foster kid who'd walked into the Lewis house all those years ago.

But then I blinked, and I was perfect Rose again. Flawless Rose. Rose who could do no wrong.

Slipping on my Cartier bracelet, another gift from my dear sister, I prepared for my next performance. The concerned family meeting would need just the right touch of reluctant honesty, devastated betrayal.

""Oh, Camille,"" I whispered to my reflection, practicing my worried frown. ""What have you done to yourself?""

But as I turned to leave, something made me pause. That look in Camille's eyes before she'd walked out, I'd never seen it before. Not in twenty years of pushing her, testing her, breaking her.

It had looked almost like... understanding.

Like she'd finally seen through my mask to the truth underneath.

I shook off the uneasy feeling. Camille was weak, just like I'd made her. She'd run away, lick her wounds, maybe try to start over somewhere new.

But she'd never be free of me. I'd made sure of that years ago.

Chapter 4

STEFAN'S POINT OF VIEW

The scotch burned going down, but I poured another anyway. My third? Fourth? I'd lost count somewhere between signing those divorce papers and watching Camille walk away.

Our wedding photo still sat on my desk, mocking me. Camille's genuine smile, my distracted eyes, already looking past her, always looking for Rose.

Rose.

Even her name felt like betrayal now.

My phone lit up with another message from her: ""Darling, stop drinking and come over. We should celebrate.""

Celebrate. Like we hadn't just destroyed someone who loved us. Someone who'd given me three years of devotion I never deserved.

The memory hit me like a punch to the gut.

\---

""Stefan?"" Camille's voice was small, uncertain. ""Did I do something wrong?""

I looked up from my laptop, irritated at the interruption. She stood in the doorway of my home office, holding a plate of something that smelled amazing.

""I made that pasta you mentioned. The one with truffles?"" Her eyes were hopeful. ""Rose gave me the recipe...""

Of course she had. Rose had made that pasta for me in Rome, years ago. Back when we were... whatever we were.

""I'm busy."" I didn't even look at the plate. ""Just leave it.""

""Oh."" A pause. ""It's just, you've been working late all week, and I thought...""

""Camille."" My voice sharp with an anger that wasn't really meant for her. ""I said I'm busy.""

She left the plate and disappeared, quiet as always. The pasta sat untouched until morning, a perfect recreation of a memory that belonged to another woman.

\---

I hurled my glass at the wall, watching crystal shatter like the life I'd built on lies.

God, I'd been cruel. Not just at the end, but throughout our marriage. Every missed dinner, every forgotten anniversary, every time I'd chosen work over her, all excuses to avoid the guilt of wanting her sister.

My phone buzzed again. Mother this time.

""Darling, I just heard from Rose. Are you alright? Do you need anything? I always said Camille wasn't suited for our family...""

I silenced the phone, remembering another moment I'd tried to forget.

\---

""She's trying so hard, Stefan."" Rose's voice was gentle as she poured me another drink. We were alone in my office after another disastrous family dinner. ""Maybe if you gave her more guidance...""

""Like you did?"" I couldn't keep the bitterness from my voice. ""Teaching her all the ways to be perfect?""

Rose's laugh was musical, practiced. Everything about her was practiced. ""Are you saying you preferred me imperfect?""

The air between us crackled with unspoken history. Four years of passion and plans, ended by her sudden departure to London. Or so she'd claimed.

""Why did you really leave?"" The question slipped out, colored by whiskey and old pain.

""You know why."" She touched my cheek, familiar and forbidden. ""Camille needed a chance at happiness. We both agreed...""

Had we? I couldn't remember anymore. Everything from that time felt hazy, manipulated. Like watching a play where I'd forgotten my lines.

""She loves you,"" Rose whispered, too close now. ""More than I ever could.""

But her eyes said something different. They always had.

\---

Another memory surfaced, this one from last week. The moment everything changed.

\---

""I made your favorite breakfast."" Camille's smile was bright, genuine. Always so damn genuine. ""Happy anniversary.""

The divorce papers burned in my briefcase, Rose's perfume still lingering on my clothes from our late-night ""meeting.""

""I can't."" I grabbed my keys, avoiding her eyes. ""Early meeting.""

""Oh."" Her voice cracked slightly. ""Will you be home for dinner? I thought we could...""

""Don't wait up.""

I'd spent that evening with Rose, planning how to break the news. She'd worn the same perfume she'd worn in Rome, all those years ago.

""It's kinder this way,"" she'd said, stroking my hair. ""A clean break. Camille will understand eventually.""

Would she? The look in her eyes when she'd seen Rose's photo...

\---

My office door opened, startling me from the memory. Mother stood there, perfectly coiffed even at midnight.

""Really, darling. Drinking alone in the dark?""

""Not now, Mother.""

She clicked across the room, surveying the broken glass with disapproval. ""Rose is worried about you. We all are.""

""Worried?"" I laughed, harsh and broken. ""Like you were worried about Camille all these years?""

""That girl was never right for you."" Mother's voice hardened. ""Rose, on the other hand...""

""Stop."" I stood, unsteady. ""Just... stop.""

""Stefan Rodriguez, you will not speak to me that way. I raised you better...""

""Did you?"" The words exploded out of me. ""You raised me to what? String along a woman who loved me while pining for her sister? Listen to you tear her down at every opportunity?""

Mother stepped back, shocked. In twenty eight years, I'd never raised my voice to her.

""Everything she did was wrong, wasn't it?"" I continued, the scotch making me brave. ""Her clothes, her manners, her cooking. Nothing was ever good enough. But Rose... Rose was perfect.""

""Because she understands our world! She...""

""She understands manipulation."" The truth hit me like a freight train. ""She played us all. You, me, Camille...""

""Don't be ridiculous."" Mother straightened her designer jacket. ""Rose loves you. She always has.""

Had she? Or had she loved the game more?

I remembered the cold calculation in her eyes when she'd orchestrated our ""chance"" meetings after returning from London. The way she'd encouraged Camille's insecurities while playing the supportive sister.

Even our reunion two months ago felt staged now. The charity gala, Camille conveniently ""sick,"" Rose in that dress I'd loved in Rome...

""Mother."" I sank back into my chair, suddenly exhausted. ""Please leave.""

""Stefan...""

""Go. Tell Rose... tell her..."" What? That I was sorry? That I finally saw through her perfect mask? That I'd destroyed my marriage for a fantasy she'd carefully crafted?

Mother left, her disappointment hanging in the air like expensive perfume. Like Rose's perfume. Like all the artificial, manipulated pieces of this life I'd chosen.

My phone lit up with another message. Rose again: ""Darling, stop being dramatic. Come home. To me.""

Home.

I looked around my office, at the shattered glass and scattered papers. At Camille's wedding photo, her genuine smile now seeming like an accusation.

What had I done?

Chapter 5

CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW

The parking garage of the hotel where i lodged was too quiet. My heels echoed against concrete, each click bouncing off empty cars and shadowed pillars. It was late, past midnight, but something felt wrong. Off.

My confrontation with Rose and my family had left me drained, empty except for the cold satisfaction of finally seeing behind her mask. I fumbled with my key fob, wanting nothing more than to get to my hotel room and plan my next move.

A car door slammed somewhere in the darkness.

I stopped, listening. Nothing but the hum of fluorescent lights and the distant sound of traffic.

My phone buzzed in my purse. Rose's number. I declined it, but not before noticing my signal had dropped to one bar.

Perfect.

Footsteps behind me. Multiple sets.

I walked faster, cursing my choice of heels. The hotel's elevator was just around the corner, past a row of concrete pillars. If I could just...

""Going somewhere, Mrs. Rodriguez?""

A man stepped out from behind a pillar. Tall, broad-shouldered, dressed in black. Professional. Two more appeared behind me, cutting off my retreat.

Not a random attack, then.

""Actually, it's Ms. Lewis now."" My voice stayed steady despite my racing heart. ""And I have a dinner reservation, so if you'll excuse me...""

The first man smiled. It wasn't a nice smile. ""I'm afraid your plans have changed.""

I gripped my purse tighter, feeling for the pepper spray I'd started carrying after signing the divorce papers. ""Did my sister send you? Or was it Stefan?""

""Our employer prefers to remain anonymous."" He stepped closer. ""Now, we can do this the easy way...""

I didn't let him finish. The pepper spray caught him directly in the eyes.

He screamed, stumbling backward. I ran, kicking off my heels as I sprinted for the elevator. The other two men shouted, their footsteps thundering behind me.

Almost there. Just a few more...

Pain exploded in my scalp as someone grabbed my hair, yanking me backward. My purse went flying, contents scattering across the concrete.

""That wasn't very nice."" The first man's voice was rough with pain and rage. ""Hold her.""

Strong hands gripped my arms. I fought, kicking, scratching, but they were too strong. Professional. Trained.

""Our employer said you might be difficult."" The first man wiped his streaming eyes. ""Said you needed to learn your place.""

Rose. This had Rose written all over it. Her parting shot, making sure I understood just how powerless I really was.

""If you're going to kill me,"" I spat, ""at least have the guts to look me in the eyes.""

He laughed. ""Kill you? No, no. Just a message. A reminder of what happens to people who don't know when to let go.""

The first punch caught me in the stomach, driving the air from my lungs. I doubled over, gasping, but the men holding me kept me upright.

""See, some people don't understand their role in life."" Another blow, this one to my ribs. ""Some people need to be taught...""

I tasted blood. My vision blurred, pain shooting through my body. But I wouldn't cry. Wouldn't give Rose the satisfaction.

""That's enough.""

The voice cut through the garage like a whip crack. Female. Authoritative.

My attackers tensed. Through swollen eyes, I saw dark figures emerging from the shadows. Men in suits, moving with military precision. And behind them...

A woman. Tall, elegant, probably in her fifties but with an ageless quality about her. She wore a black designer suit that probably cost more than my car, her silver hair swept into a perfect chignon.

But it was her eyes that caught me. Sharp, intelligent, and oddly... familiar.

""Ma'am,"" one of my attackers started, ""our employer...""

""Is about to have a very bad day."" The woman's voice was ice. ""Release her. Now.""

The hands holding me disappeared. I slumped forward, pain shooting through my ribs.

""Secure them."" The woman's command sent her men moving. My attackers didn't even try to run. They knew better.

She walked toward me, heels clicking on concrete. Designer shoes. Probably cost more than my monthly rent.

""Camille Lewis."" Not a question. She knew exactly who I was.

I tried to straighten, to maintain some dignity despite my split lip and torn dress. ""Do I know you?""

Her eyes softened, just slightly. Like she was seeing something, someone else in my face.

""No."" She gestured, and more men appeared with a medical kit. ""But I knew someone very much like you, once. Someone who also had to learn the hard way about trust and betrayal.""

The world was getting fuzzy around the edges. Blood dripped onto my ruined dress, each breath sending knives through my ribs.

""Who..."" I swayed, darkness creeping in. ""Who are you?""

She stepped forward, catching me as my knees buckled. This close, I could smell her perfume, something expensive, unique. Something that tickled at the edges of my memory.

""Someone who's been watching you for a very long time, Camille."" Her voice seemed to come from far away. ""Someone who's going to help you become everything they tried to prevent.""

The darkness was winning now. But before it took me completely, I heard her last words:

""After all... you look just like my daughter.""

Then nothing but black.

Chapter 6

CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW

I woke to silk sheets and sunlight. For a moment, I thought I was back in my childhood bedroom, before everything fell apart. But the ceiling above me was unfamiliar, hand-painted cherubs floating in a cloudless sky, framed by gilded molding that probably cost more than my entire wedding.

Pain shot through my ribs as I tried to sit up, memories flooding back. The parking garage. Rose's hired thugs. The mysterious woman with silver hair.

""Careful."" A voice from the doorway made me turn. ""Three bruised ribs and a mild concussion. The doctor said you need rest.""

She stood there like something from a fashion magazine, tailored black pants suit, pearls that definitely weren't fake, silver hair swept into an elegant twist. But it was her eyes that held me. Sharp. Calculating. Hauntingly familiar.

""Where am I?"" My voice was rough. ""Who are you?""

""You're safe."" She moved into the room with fluid grace, settling into a chair beside my bed. ""As for who I am... my name is Victoria Kane.""

The name hit like a physical shock. Everyone knew Victoria Kane, the ruthless CEO who'd built Kane Industries from nothing, the woman Forbes called 'The Queen of Wall Street.' She was worth billions, moved markets with a phone call, and was rumored to be more powerful than most governments.

""Why..."" I swallowed hard. ""Why am I here?""

Something flickered in her eyes, pain, maybe, or memory. ""Because Three years ago, I saw a photo in a society magazine. A young woman at some charity gala, wearing a dress that didn't quite fit, smiling bravely while her 'perfect' sister held court.""

The gala. One of Rose's many triumphs, orchestrated to highlight the difference between us.

""The photo caught my attention,"" Victoria continued, ""but it was your eyes that made me look closer. They were... familiar.""

She reached for her phone, pulling up an image that made my breath catch. A young woman, maybe my age, with my face. My eyes. My smile.

""Your daughter?"" The resemblance was uncanny.

""Sophia."" Victoria's voice softened. ""She would have been thirty-two this year.""

Would have been. The words hung heavy in the air.

""What happened?""

""Car accident. Ten years ago."" Her fingers traced the photo. ""Though 'accident' is a polite fiction. Her fiancé's family didn't approve of the match. Brake lines are so easily tampered with.""

Ice slid down my spine. ""Did they...""

""Face consequences?"" A smile that could cut glass. ""Eventually. But that's not why you're here.""

She set down her phone, fixing me with that penetrating gaze. ""After I saw your photo, I had you investigated. Learned about your family dynamics. Your marriage. Your sister's... activities.""

""You've been watching me?"" It should have felt creepy, but somehow it didn't. ""Why?""

""Because I recognized something in you. Something I saw in Sophia. Raw potential, wrapped in other people's expectations. A diamond they tried to pass off as glass.""

My heart pounded. ""I don't understand.""

""Don't you?"" She leaned forward. ""I watched you try to fit their mold. Watched you shut away parts of yourself to please them. Watched them clip your wings while convincing you it was for your own good.""

Tears burned my eyes. ""Like the college acceptance.""

""Which Rose sabotaged. Yes, I know about that too. Just like I know about the diary she forged, the jobs she made sure you didn't get, the friends she slowly turned against you.""

""You know everything."" My voice cracked. ""And you just... watched?""

""I waited."" She stood, moving to the window. ""Waited to see if you'd break or bloom. Waited for the moment you finally saw through their perfect lies.""

The confrontation with Rose flashed through my mind. ""And now?""

""Now?"" She turned back to me, sunlight casting her in silhouette. ""Now I'm offering you a choice. You can walk away from all of this. I'll set you up somewhere new, comfortable, far from them. Or...""

""Or?""

""Or I can teach you to be what they always feared you might become. Powerful. Independent. Free.""

She moved back to my bedside, and suddenly I saw what made her so formidable. It wasn't just the money or the influence. It was the absolute certainty that the world would bend to her will.

""Your sister spent twenty years teaching you about manipulation,"" she continued. ""Let me teach you about power. Real power, not the petty games she plays.""

""Why?"" I had to know. ""Because I look like your daughter?""

""No."" Her hand touched mine, surprisingly warm. ""Because you look like I did, forty years ago. Before I learned that the world doesn't give you what you deserve, it gives you what you have the strength to take.""

I stared at our joined hands, seeing the perfect manicure that probably cost more than my monthly salary. ""And if I say yes?""

""Then I adopt you. Publicly, legally, completely. You become Camille Kane, heir to everything I've built."" Her smile turned sharp. ""Imagine your sister's face when she realizes the investor she's been desperately courting is her 'weak' little sister.""

The thought sent a thrill through me. ""She'd lose her mind.""

""That's just the beginning. I'll teach you everything I know. Business. Strategy. Power. In five years, you won't just survive their games, you'll rewrite the rules.""

""And what do you get out of this?""

Victoria's eyes met mine, and for a moment I saw raw honesty. ""A chance to finish what Sophia started. A chance to see someone bloom instead of break. And..."" A pause. ""A chance to have a daughter again.""

I thought about my life, the careful box they'd put me in, the dreams they'd stolen, the lies they'd fed me. Thought about Rose's smug smile and Stefan's betrayal and my parents' willing blindness.

""When do we start?""

Victoria's smile was like sunrise, brilliant and inevitable. ""We already have.""

She reached for a folder on the bedside table. ""First, we need to establish your disappearance. Make them think their thugs succeeded.""

""Let them think I'm..."" Understanding dawned. ""Let them think they broke me.""

""For now."" She opened the folder, revealing documents, passports, bank statements. ""While you heal, while you learn, while you become who you were meant to be.""

I sat up straighter, ignoring the pain in my ribs. ""And then?""

""And then?"" Victoria Kane, my new mother, smiled like a queen bestowing kingdoms. ""Then we show them exactly what happens when you try to cage a wolf in sheep's clothing.""

Looking at her, I finally understood what real power looked like. Not Rose's petty manipulations or Stefan's inherited privilege. This was something else. Something primal. Something they'd tried to crush in me.

But they'd failed.

And now they'd pay.

""When can I sign the papers?"" I asked.

Victoria's laugh was rich with promise. ""That's my girl.......",1,1751901104.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW

Three years. One thousand and ninety-five days of trying to be the perfect wife, and this was my reward divorce papers on our anniversary.

I stared at Stefan's perfect signature on the last page, the ink still fresh. He must have signed them this morning, probably right after I'd left that stupid handmade card on his desk. The one I'd spent hours making, like a fool who still believed in fairy tales.

The anniversary card I made for my husband Stefan still sat on the kitchen counter, untouched. Three years of marriage summed up in a handmade gesture he couldn't even bother to open. I'd spent hours on it last night, writing words I thought mattered.

My coffee had gone cold. Funny how you notice small things when your world is falling apart.

""Sign here. And here."" Stefan's voice was distant, businesslike. He'd laid out the divorce papers like contracts at one of his meetings, sticky tabs marking each signature line. ""The highlighted sections need initials.""

My hands wouldn't stop shaking. ""You're doing this today? On our anniversary?""

""Camille."" He sighed, that familiar sound of disappointment I'd heard so many times before. ""There's no point dragging this out.""

The morning sun streamed through our kitchen windows, catching the diamond on my finger. Three carats, princess cut, picked out by his mother. ""Not your style, dear, but it's what a Rodriguez wife should wear,"" she'd said at the time. Like everything else in my life, it had never really been mine.

""Is there someone else?""

The question hung in the air between us. Stefan straightened his tie, Italian silk, the blue one I'd given him for Christmas. ""Yes.""

One word. That's all it took to erase three years of trying to be perfect.

""How long?""

""Two months."" He wouldn't meet my eyes. ""She came back to town and...""

""Two months,"" I repeated. All those late nights at the office. The missed dinners. The way he'd stopped kissing me goodbye in the mornings. ""Were you ever going to tell me? Or just keep lying until the papers were ready?""

""I didn't want to hurt you.""

A laugh bubbled up, harsh, unfamiliar. ""That's thoughtful of you.""

My hand knocked against my coffee mug, sending it crashing to the floor. Dark liquid spread across the pristine tiles, staining the grout I'd scrubbed on hands and knees last week because his mother was coming to visit.

""Let me get that..."" Stefan reached for the paper towels.

""Don't."" My voice cracked. ""Just... don't pretend to care now.""

I bent to pick up the broken pieces. A photo slipped from between the divorce papers, landing face-up in the spilled coffee.

The world stopped.

I knew that smile. Those eyes. That perfectly poised expression that had haunted every family photo since I was twelve.

""Rose?"" My sister's name tasted like poison. ""Your first love was Rose?""

Stefan's silence said everything.

Memories hit like punches to the gut. Rose helping me pick out my wedding dress. Rose giving toasts at our engagement party. Rose calling every week to check on my marriage, to give advice about keeping Stefan happy.

My adopted sister. My parents' golden child. The one they'd chosen to love.

""She never left town, did she?"" The pieces were falling into place. ""She's been here the whole time, waiting. Playing the supportive sister while you both laughed at stupid, naive Camille.""

""It wasn't like that."" Stefan ran his hands through his hair, that gesture I used to find endearing. ""We tried to fight it. But some people are just meant to...""

""If you say 'meant to be' I swear I'll throw this mug at your head."" My fingers tightened around the broken ceramic. ""How long were you together before? Before me?""

He shifted uncomfortably. ""Four years. Until she got the job offer in London.""

Four years. The same time I'd started dating Stefan. The same time Rose had suddenly become my biggest cheerleader, pushing me toward him.

""She set this up,"" I whispered. ""All of it. And I fell for every piece.""

""Camille, you're being dramatic. Rose cares about you.""

""Like she cared when she told my first boyfriend I was damaged goods? Or when she convinced my parents I was too unstable for college?"" The broken mug cut into my palm, but I barely felt it. ""She's been sabotaging me my whole life, and I kept making excuses because that's what good sisters do, right?""

Blood dripped onto the divorce papers. Stefan reached for my hand but I jerked away.

""Don't touch me."" I grabbed a dish towel, wrapping it around my palm. ""Where is she now? Waiting to comfort me through my divorce? Planning your next wedding?""

""She wanted to be here, but I thought it would be better...""

""Better?"" I laughed again, the sound edged with hysteria. ""Yes, you've both been so concerned with what's better for me. Such caring people.""

I picked up the pen, the Mont Blanc he'd given me on our first anniversary. The one Rose had helped him choose.

""Camille, wait. We should talk about this properly.""

I signed every page, my signature perfectly steady. Let them see I wasn't breaking. Let them think they'd won.

""I'm done talking."" I gathered my purse, the signed papers, Rose's photo. ""Done pretending. Done being the good sister, the perfect wife, the daughter who never complains.""

""Where are you going?""

""Away from you. Away from her. Away from everyone who thinks Camille Lewis is someone they can use and discard.""

My phone buzzed, Rose's smiling face lit up the screen. Right on cue, coming to play her part.

I declined the call and walked to the door. Behind me, Stefan called out, ""You can't just leave. We need to discuss arrangements, the house, the accounts...""

""You can have it all."" I turned to face him one last time. ""The house, the cars, the life you built on lies. I don't want anything that reminds me of either of you.""

""Camille, please...""

""Goodbye, Stefan."" I smiled, and something in my expression made him step back. ""Give Rose my love. Tell her thank you, actually.""

""For what?""

""For finally showing me the truth. About her, about you, about who I need to become.""

I walked out of that house, out of that life, leaving bloody fingerprints on the door handle. Let them try to erase those as easily as they'd erased me.

Three years of pretending to be someone I wasn't. Three years of swallowing pain and making excuses for people who never deserved my loyalty.

My phone buzzed again. Rose. Then my mother. Then Stefan. One by one, I blocked them all.

Every connection to the life I thought I had to live.

In my rearview mirror, I caught a glimpse of my reflection. Tears streaked my makeup, blood stained my dress, my hair had come loose from its perfect twist.

I looked nothing like the polished, proper wife Stefan Rodriguez had married.

Chapter 2

Camille's point of view

The house was quiet, too quiet. I slipped in through the side door, locking it softly behind me. The air smelled like lemon polish and roses, just like it always did. It felt strange to be back, like stepping into someone else’s life.

The kitchen was dark except for the faint glow of the fridge light. I crept up the stairs, careful to skip the third step that creaked. Every sound I made felt loud, like the house itself was listening.

When I reached my bedroom door, I stopped. It was open a crack, just like I’d left it all those years ago. Taking a deep breath, I stepped inside and shut the door.

My childhood bedroom hadn't changed in three years. Same pale pink walls, same white furniture, same collection of second-place trophies. Rose's first-place ones used to shine in the room next door.

I stared at my reflection in the vanity mirror, the same one where I'd practiced my wedding makeup three years ago, Rose standing behind me with that perfect smile. Now my mascara was smeared, hair wild, designer dress wrinkled. Mom would have a fit if she saw me like this.

The clock on my nightstand read 10:47 PM. I'd been sitting here for hours, packing what little of my old life I wanted to keep. Amazing how seventeen years in this house fit into one duffel bag.

My phone buzzed again, the twentieth time in an hour. This time it was Mom.

""Camille, this is ridiculous. Come home so we can discuss this like adults. Rose is worried sick...""

I hung up. Of course Rose was worried. Her carefully laid plans were unraveling.

The front door clicked open downstairs. I froze, listening to familiar footsteps on hardwood. The slight tap of heels, the whisper of expensive fabric.

""Camille?"" Mom's voice floated up the stairs. ""Darling, I know you're here. The housekeeper saw your car.""

I should have parked around the block. Should have been smarter, faster, better at disappearing. But I'd never been the clever one, had I? That was Rose's role.

More footsteps. A deeper voice, Dad, probably called home from work to deal with his hysterical younger daughter. Again.

""Princess?"" His voice carried that same gentle tone he'd used when I was twelve, crying about Rose getting my spot in the school play. ""Let's talk about this.""

A third set of footsteps made my blood freeze. Lighter, more graceful. Perfect, like everything else about her.

""Camille?"" Rose's voice dripped concern. ""Sweetie, please. Don't shut us out.""

I looked at the family photo on my dresser, taken the day Rose's adoption was finalized. Mom and Dad beaming, Rose radiant in her new dress, thirteen-year-old me trying to smile through braces and acne. One big happy family.

What a joke.

The memory hit me like a punch to the gut:

\---

""But I've been practicing for months!"" I clutched my script, tears blurring the words. ""Mrs. Bennett said the lead was mine!""

Rose touched my shoulder, gentle as always. ""Oh, sweetie. I didn't mean to take your part. I just... the words came so naturally in the audition. Mrs. Bennett said I had a gift.""

Of course she did. Everyone said Rose had a gift. For music, for acting, for making people love her.

""Maybe..."" Rose's eyes lit up with that special gleam that always meant trouble. ""Maybe you could help me practice? Be my supporting actress? We could make it our sister thing!""

I'd agreed. Because that's what good sisters did. Because saying no to Rose meant disappointed looks from Mom, lectures from Dad about family loyalty.

Opening night, I watched from the wings as Rose brought the audience to tears. Afterward, Mom bought her roses. Dad took us all to dinner.

No one mentioned that I'd written Rose's best lines during our ""practice sessions."" Or that her dramatic monologue had been word-for-word what I'd performed in my original audition.

Rose just had a gift for memorization, that's all.

\---

""Camille Elizabeth Lewis!"" Mom's voice sharpened. ""This behavior is completely unacceptable.""

I opened my bedroom door.

They stood in the hallway like a perfect family portrait, Mom in her designer suit, Dad looking distinguished in his work clothes, Rose wearing concern like the latest fashion trend.

""Hello, sister."" My voice came out steady. ""Shouldn't you be comforting your fiancé?""

Rose's eyes widened. Always the performer. ""Camille, please. Let me explain...""

""Explain what? How you've been sleeping with my husband? Or how you set this whole thing up from the beginning?""

""What is she talking about?"" Dad turned to Rose, who already had tears forming. Perfect, delicate tears that never smeared her makeup.

""She's upset,"" Rose whispered. ""Lashing out. You know how she gets, Daddy.""

""Don't."" My laugh sounded strange, even to me. ""Don't you dare play that card again. Show them the ring, Rose. The one Stefan gave you two months ago while I was supposedly too sick to attend the charity gala.""

Mom gasped. Dad's face darkened. But Rose, Rose's mask slipped for just a second. I saw it this time, that flash of cold calculation behind the concern.

""It wasn't like that,"" she started.

""Really? Then how was it? Explain to everyone how you've been calling me every week, giving me marriage advice while sleeping with my husband. Tell them about all the times you helped me pick out lingerie for anniversaries when Stefan was really working late with you.""

""That's enough!"" Mom stepped forward. ""Rose would never...""

""Never what, Mom? Never lie? Never manipulate? Never steal something that belonged to her sister?"" I pulled out my phone, playing the last voicemail from Stefan.

His voice filled the hallway: ""Rose is my soulmate, Camille. We tried to fight it, but some people are just meant to be together. You have to understand...""

The silence that followed was deafening.

Rose recovered first. ""I never meant to hurt you. We can't help who we love...""

The sound of my palm connecting with her cheek echoed like a gunshot.

""Camille!"" Mom grabbed my arm. ""Have you lost your mind?""

""No,"" I said quietly, watching a red mark bloom on Rose's perfect face. ""For the first time in fourteen years, I'm seeing clearly.""

I walked past them, duffel bag in hand. Behind me, Rose's sobs started, the same performance she'd perfected over years of turning everyone against me.

""Where are you going?"" Dad called after me. ""You can't just walk away from family!""

I paused at the top of the stairs, looking back at my so-called family. Mom comforting Rose, Dad looking torn, and my sister watching me through her tears with eyes that held no warmth at all.

""Family?"" I smiled, and something in my expression made them all step back. ""No, this isn't family. This is a game. And for fourteen years, I've been playing by Rose's rules.""

""Camille, please,"" Rose reached for me, ever the caring sister. ""Let me make this right.""

I caught her wrist before she could touch me. ""You taught me well, big sister. About manipulation. About patience. About waiting for the perfect moment to strike.""

Her eyes widened, real fear this time, not performed.

""Thank you for the lessons,"" I whispered, letting her go. ""Now watch how well I learned them.""

I walked down the stairs, ignoring their calls. In the foyer mirror, I caught one last glimpse of myself, mascara-stained, wild-eyed, finally unchained.

Chapter 3

ROSE'S POINT OF VIEW

I swirled the champagne in my crystal flute, watching the bubbles dance. Victory tasted sweet, just like I'd imagined all these years. The living room of my penthouse apartment overlooked the city where I'd spent twenty years pretending to be the perfect adopted daughter, the loving sister, the supportive friend.

What a joke.

""To freedom,"" I whispered to my reflection in the window. The woman staring back at me smiled, perfect teeth, perfect hair, perfect lies. Just like always.

My phone buzzed again. Another missed call from Stefan. He'd been calling non-stop since Camille walked out, probably worried I'd change my mind now that everything was in the open. Poor, predictable Stefan. Still thinking he was in control of any of this.

I kicked off my Louboutins and sank into the leather couch, letting memories wash over me like warm wine.

\---

The first time I saw Camille Lewis, I hated her.

I was thirteen, fresh out of foster care, desperate to please my new parents. They'd brought me to this massive house with its manicured lawn and marble floors, promising me a fresh start. A real family.

Then this skinny thing with braces and messy hair came bouncing down the stairs, all eager smiles and innocent eyes.

""Hi! I'm Camille. I've always wanted a sister!""

She hugged me right there in the foyer, not caring that my clothes were secondhand or that I smelled like the group home's industrial detergent. Just pure, genuine joy at having a sister.

I wanted to vomit.

Because there she was, this awkward, imperfect girl who had everything I'd spent thirteen years dreaming about. Parents who actually wanted her. A home she belonged in. A future secured by the Lewis family name.

And she didn't even appreciate it properly.

I watched her over dinner that first night, watched how she slouched in her chair and talked with her mouth full. How she didn't know which fork to use for salad. How she laughed too loud and asked too many questions.

""Rose has such lovely manners,"" Mrs. Lewis .... Mom ..... had said, smiling at me. ""Perhaps you could learn from your new sister, Camille.""

That's when I saw it. The first crack in Camille's perfect world. The slight dimming of her smile, the way she sat up straighter, tried harder.

It was beautiful.

\---

My phone buzzed again, pulling me back to the present. Stefan's face lit up my screen, his fifth call in an hour. With a sigh, I answered.

""Darling, you're being needy.""

""Rose."" His voice was rough. Had he been drinking? ""She's gone. Really gone. Blocked my number, cleaned out her closet...""

""Isn't that what we wanted?"" I kept my voice gentle, soothing. The same tone I'd used all those times I'd counseled Camille through her marital problems. Problems I'd carefully orchestrated.

""I just... the way she looked at me...""

""Stefan, sweetheart."" I let steel edge into my sweetness. ""Are you having second thoughts? After everything we've been through?""

""No! No, of course not. I love you. I've always loved you.""

""Then stop calling me about your ex-wife. It's pathetic.""

I hung up, tossing the phone aside. Men were so predictably weak. Even Stefan, who I'd spent four years grooming before pushing him toward Camille, still needed constant management.

But he'd served his purpose. Just like everyone else in my carefully constructed game.

The family photo on my mantel caught my eye, my adoption day. I stood in the center, of course. Always the center. Camille pushed to the edge of the frame, trying so hard to smile through her insecurities.

God, it had been easy. Almost too easy.

A little whisper here about how Camille was unstable. A few concerned conversations with Mom about how worried I was about my dear sister's emotional state. Casual mentions to Dad about how Camille seemed to be struggling with basic adult responsibilities.

Fourteen years of careful groundwork, positioning myself as the responsible daughter, the achievable dream, while slowly crushing Camille's confidence, her relationships, her sense of self.

The college rejection was particularly inspired, if I do say so myself. All it took was one tearful conversation with Mom about finding Camille's ""secret"" diary, filled with dark thoughts and destructive plans. Plans I'd written myself, of course, in Camille's childish handwriting that I'd spent months practicing to forge.

Suddenly, their precious younger daughter wasn't ready for college. Needed time to ""find herself."" Needed to stay close to home where they could watch her.

Where I could watch her.

I took another sip of champagne, savoring the moment. Because this, this was what I'd really wanted all along. Not Stefan, he was just a useful pawn. Not the Lewis fortune, though that would come in time.

No, what I wanted was to watch perfect, precious Camille finally break. To see her realize that everything she thought she had family, love, security, had been built on my lies.

My phone buzzed with a text from Mom: ""Rose, darling, please come over. Your father and I need to talk about what happened.""

I smiled, already planning my performance. The tearful confusion, the reluctant confession about Stefan's pursuit, the gentle concern about Camille's mental state.

By the time I was done, they'd be thanking me for protecting them from their unstable daughter all these years.

Standing up, I walked to my closet, selecting the perfect outfit for my next scene. Something subtle but expensive. Grieving sister, not celebrating victor.

The massive walk-in closet had been Camille's wedding gift to me. ""So you'll always have space for your amazing fashion sense,"" she'd said, hugging me tight.

Even then, even after years of watching me steal every spotlight, every opportunity, every scrap of parental approval, she'd still loved me. Still trusted me.

Idiot.

I pulled out a cream cashmere sweater, remembering how Camille used to borrow my clothes in high school. How I'd wait until she had something important, a date, a presentation, an interview, then suddenly remember I needed that exact outfit.

She'd always given them back without argument. Always apologized for the inconvenience.

Always tried so hard to be the perfect sister.

My reflection caught my eye, and for a moment, just a moment, I saw something ugly there. Something that looked like the scared, angry foster kid who'd walked into the Lewis house all those years ago.

But then I blinked, and I was perfect Rose again. Flawless Rose. Rose who could do no wrong.

Slipping on my Cartier bracelet, another gift from my dear sister, I prepared for my next performance. The concerned family meeting would need just the right touch of reluctant honesty, devastated betrayal.

""Oh, Camille,"" I whispered to my reflection, practicing my worried frown. ""What have you done to yourself?""

But as I turned to leave, something made me pause. That look in Camille's eyes before she'd walked out, I'd never seen it before. Not in twenty years of pushing her, testing her, breaking her.

It had looked almost like... understanding.

Like she'd finally seen through my mask to the truth underneath.

I shook off the uneasy feeling. Camille was weak, just like I'd made her. She'd run away, lick her wounds, maybe try to start over somewhere new.

But she'd never be free of me. I'd made sure of that years ago.

Chapter 4

STEFAN'S POINT OF VIEW

The scotch burned going down, but I poured another anyway. My third? Fourth? I'd lost count somewhere between signing those divorce papers and watching Camille walk away.

Our wedding photo still sat on my desk, mocking me. Camille's genuine smile, my distracted eyes, already looking past her, always looking for Rose.

Rose.

Even her name felt like betrayal now.

My phone lit up with another message from her: ""Darling, stop drinking and come over. We should celebrate.""

Celebrate. Like we hadn't just destroyed someone who loved us. Someone who'd given me three years of devotion I never deserved.

The memory hit me like a punch to the gut.

\---

""Stefan?"" Camille's voice was small, uncertain. ""Did I do something wrong?""

I looked up from my laptop, irritated at the interruption. She stood in the doorway of my home office, holding a plate of something that smelled amazing.

""I made that pasta you mentioned. The one with truffles?"" Her eyes were hopeful. ""Rose gave me the recipe...""

Of course she had. Rose had made that pasta for me in Rome, years ago. Back when we were... whatever we were.

""I'm busy."" I didn't even look at the plate. ""Just leave it.""

""Oh."" A pause. ""It's just, you've been working late all week, and I thought...""

""Camille."" My voice sharp with an anger that wasn't really meant for her. ""I said I'm busy.""

She left the plate and disappeared, quiet as always. The pasta sat untouched until morning, a perfect recreation of a memory that belonged to another woman.

\---

I hurled my glass at the wall, watching crystal shatter like the life I'd built on lies.

God, I'd been cruel. Not just at the end, but throughout our marriage. Every missed dinner, every forgotten anniversary, every time I'd chosen work over her, all excuses to avoid the guilt of wanting her sister.

My phone buzzed again. Mother this time.

""Darling, I just heard from Rose. Are you alright? Do you need anything? I always said Camille wasn't suited for our family...""

I silenced the phone, remembering another moment I'd tried to forget.

\---

""She's trying so hard, Stefan."" Rose's voice was gentle as she poured me another drink. We were alone in my office after another disastrous family dinner. ""Maybe if you gave her more guidance...""

""Like you did?"" I couldn't keep the bitterness from my voice. ""Teaching her all the ways to be perfect?""

Rose's laugh was musical, practiced. Everything about her was practiced. ""Are you saying you preferred me imperfect?""

The air between us crackled with unspoken history. Four years of passion and plans, ended by her sudden departure to London. Or so she'd claimed.

""Why did you really leave?"" The question slipped out, colored by whiskey and old pain.

""You know why."" She touched my cheek, familiar and forbidden. ""Camille needed a chance at happiness. We both agreed...""

Had we? I couldn't remember anymore. Everything from that time felt hazy, manipulated. Like watching a play where I'd forgotten my lines.

""She loves you,"" Rose whispered, too close now. ""More than I ever could.""

But her eyes said something different. They always had.

\---

Another memory surfaced, this one from last week. The moment everything changed.

\---

""I made your favorite breakfast."" Camille's smile was bright, genuine. Always so damn genuine. ""Happy anniversary.""

The divorce papers burned in my briefcase, Rose's perfume still lingering on my clothes from our late-night ""meeting.""

""I can't."" I grabbed my keys, avoiding her eyes. ""Early meeting.""

""Oh."" Her voice cracked slightly. ""Will you be home for dinner? I thought we could...""

""Don't wait up.""

I'd spent that evening with Rose, planning how to break the news. She'd worn the same perfume she'd worn in Rome, all those years ago.

""It's kinder this way,"" she'd said, stroking my hair. ""A clean break. Camille will understand eventually.""

Would she? The look in her eyes when she'd seen Rose's photo...

\---

My office door opened, startling me from the memory. Mother stood there, perfectly coiffed even at midnight.

""Really, darling. Drinking alone in the dark?""

""Not now, Mother.""

She clicked across the room, surveying the broken glass with disapproval. ""Rose is worried about you. We all are.""

""Worried?"" I laughed, harsh and broken. ""Like you were worried about Camille all these years?""

""That girl was never right for you."" Mother's voice hardened. ""Rose, on the other hand...""

""Stop."" I stood, unsteady. ""Just... stop.""

""Stefan Rodriguez, you will not speak to me that way. I raised you better...""

""Did you?"" The words exploded out of me. ""You raised me to what? String along a woman who loved me while pining for her sister? Listen to you tear her down at every opportunity?""

Mother stepped back, shocked. In twenty eight years, I'd never raised my voice to her.

""Everything she did was wrong, wasn't it?"" I continued, the scotch making me brave. ""Her clothes, her manners, her cooking. Nothing was ever good enough. But Rose... Rose was perfect.""

""Because she understands our world! She...""

""She understands manipulation."" The truth hit me like a freight train. ""She played us all. You, me, Camille...""

""Don't be ridiculous."" Mother straightened her designer jacket. ""Rose loves you. She always has.""

Had she? Or had she loved the game more?

I remembered the cold calculation in her eyes when she'd orchestrated our ""chance"" meetings after returning from London. The way she'd encouraged Camille's insecurities while playing the supportive sister.

Even our reunion two months ago felt staged now. The charity gala, Camille conveniently ""sick,"" Rose in that dress I'd loved in Rome...

""Mother."" I sank back into my chair, suddenly exhausted. ""Please leave.""

""Stefan...""

""Go. Tell Rose... tell her..."" What? That I was sorry? That I finally saw through her perfect mask? That I'd destroyed my marriage for a fantasy she'd carefully crafted?

Mother left, her disappointment hanging in the air like expensive perfume. Like Rose's perfume. Like all the artificial, manipulated pieces of this life I'd chosen.

My phone lit up with another message. Rose again: ""Darling, stop being dramatic. Come home. To me.""

Home.

I looked around my office, at the shattered glass and scattered papers. At Camille's wedding photo, her genuine smile now seeming like an accusation.

What had I done?

Chapter 5

CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW

The parking garage of the hotel where i lodged was too quiet. My heels echoed against concrete, each click bouncing off empty cars and shadowed pillars. It was late, past midnight, but something felt wrong. Off.

My confrontation with Rose and my family had left me drained, empty except for the cold satisfaction of finally seeing behind her mask. I fumbled with my key fob, wanting nothing more than to get to my hotel room and plan my next move.

A car door slammed somewhere in the darkness.

I stopped, listening. Nothing but the hum of fluorescent lights and the distant sound of traffic.

My phone buzzed in my purse. Rose's number. I declined it, but not before noticing my signal had dropped to one bar.

Perfect.

Footsteps behind me. Multiple sets.

I walked faster, cursing my choice of heels. The hotel's elevator was just around the corner, past a row of concrete pillars. If I could just...

""Going somewhere, Mrs. Rodriguez?""

A man stepped out from behind a pillar. Tall, broad-shouldered, dressed in black. Professional. Two more appeared behind me, cutting off my retreat.

Not a random attack, then.

""Actually, it's Ms. Lewis now."" My voice stayed steady despite my racing heart. ""And I have a dinner reservation, so if you'll excuse me...""

The first man smiled. It wasn't a nice smile. ""I'm afraid your plans have changed.""

I gripped my purse tighter, feeling for the pepper spray I'd started carrying after signing the divorce papers. ""Did my sister send you? Or was it Stefan?""

""Our employer prefers to remain anonymous."" He stepped closer. ""Now, we can do this the easy way...""

I didn't let him finish. The pepper spray caught him directly in the eyes.

He screamed, stumbling backward. I ran, kicking off my heels as I sprinted for the elevator. The other two men shouted, their footsteps thundering behind me.

Almost there. Just a few more...

Pain exploded in my scalp as someone grabbed my hair, yanking me backward. My purse went flying, contents scattering across the concrete.

""That wasn't very nice."" The first man's voice was rough with pain and rage. ""Hold her.""

Strong hands gripped my arms. I fought, kicking, scratching, but they were too strong. Professional. Trained.

""Our employer said you might be difficult."" The first man wiped his streaming eyes. ""Said you needed to learn your place.""

Rose. This had Rose written all over it. Her parting shot, making sure I understood just how powerless I really was.

""If you're going to kill me,"" I spat, ""at least have the guts to look me in the eyes.""

He laughed. ""Kill you? No, no. Just a message. A reminder of what happens to people who don't know when to let go.""

The first punch caught me in the stomach, driving the air from my lungs. I doubled over, gasping, but the men holding me kept me upright.

""See, some people don't understand their role in life."" Another blow, this one to my ribs. ""Some people need to be taught...""

I tasted blood. My vision blurred, pain shooting through my body. But I wouldn't cry. Wouldn't give Rose the satisfaction.

""That's enough.""

The voice cut through the garage like a whip crack. Female. Authoritative.

My attackers tensed. Through swollen eyes, I saw dark figures emerging from the shadows. Men in suits, moving with military precision. And behind them...

A woman. Tall, elegant, probably in her fifties but with an ageless quality about her. She wore a black designer suit that probably cost more than my car, her silver hair swept into a perfect chignon.

But it was her eyes that caught me. Sharp, intelligent, and oddly... familiar.

""Ma'am,"" one of my attackers started, ""our employer...""

""Is about to have a very bad day."" The woman's voice was ice. ""Release her. Now.""

The hands holding me disappeared. I slumped forward, pain shooting through my ribs.

""Secure them."" The woman's command sent her men moving. My attackers didn't even try to run. They knew better.

She walked toward me, heels clicking on concrete. Designer shoes. Probably cost more than my monthly rent.

""Camille Lewis."" Not a question. She knew exactly who I was.

I tried to straighten, to maintain some dignity despite my split lip and torn dress. ""Do I know you?""

Her eyes softened, just slightly. Like she was seeing something, someone else in my face.

""No."" She gestured, and more men appeared with a medical kit. ""But I knew someone very much like you, once. Someone who also had to learn the hard way about trust and betrayal.""

The world was getting fuzzy around the edges. Blood dripped onto my ruined dress, each breath sending knives through my ribs.

""Who..."" I swayed, darkness creeping in. ""Who are you?""

She stepped forward, catching me as my knees buckled. This close, I could smell her perfume, something expensive, unique. Something that tickled at the edges of my memory.

""Someone who's been watching you for a very long time, Camille."" Her voice seemed to come from far away. ""Someone who's going to help you become everything they tried to prevent.""

The darkness was winning now. But before it took me completely, I heard her last words:

""After all... you look just like my daughter.""

Then nothing but black.

Chapter 6

CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW

I woke to silk sheets and sunlight. For a moment, I thought I was back in my childhood bedroom, before everything fell apart. But the ceiling above me was unfamiliar, hand-painted cherubs floating in a cloudless sky, framed by gilded molding that probably cost more than my entire wedding.

Pain shot through my ribs as I tried to sit up, memories flooding back. The parking garage. Rose's hired thugs. The mysterious woman with silver hair.

""Careful."" A voice from the doorway made me turn. ""Three bruised ribs and a mild concussion. The doctor said you need rest.""

She stood there like something from a fashion magazine, tailored black pants suit, pearls that definitely weren't fake, silver hair swept into an elegant twist. But it was her eyes that held me. Sharp. Calculating. Hauntingly familiar.

""Where am I?"" My voice was rough. ""Who are you?""

""You're safe."" She moved into the room with fluid grace, settling into a chair beside my bed. ""As for who I am... my name is Victoria Kane.""

The name hit like a physical shock. Everyone knew Victoria Kane, the ruthless CEO who'd built Kane Industries from nothing, the woman Forbes called 'The Queen of Wall Street.' She was worth billions, moved markets with a phone call, and was rumored to be more powerful than most governments.

""Why..."" I swallowed hard. ""Why am I here?""

Something flickered in her eyes, pain, maybe, or memory. ""Because Three years ago, I saw a photo in a society magazine. A young woman at some charity gala, wearing a dress that didn't quite fit, smiling bravely while her 'perfect' sister held court.""

The gala. One of Rose's many triumphs, orchestrated to highlight the difference between us.

""The photo caught my attention,"" Victoria continued, ""but it was your eyes that made me look closer. They were... familiar.""

She reached for her phone, pulling up an image that made my breath catch. A young woman, maybe my age, with my face. My eyes. My smile.

""Your daughter?"" The resemblance was uncanny.

""Sophia."" Victoria's voice softened. ""She would have been thirty-two this year.""

Would have been. The words hung heavy in the air.

""What happened?""

""Car accident. Ten years ago."" Her fingers traced the photo. ""Though 'accident' is a polite fiction. Her fiancé's family didn't approve of the match. Brake lines are so easily tampered with.""

Ice slid down my spine. ""Did they...""

""Face consequences?"" A smile that could cut glass. ""Eventually. But that's not why you're here.""

She set down her phone, fixing me with that penetrating gaze. ""After I saw your photo, I had you investigated. Learned about your family dynamics. Your marriage. Your sister's... activities.""

""You've been watching me?"" It should have felt creepy, but somehow it didn't. ""Why?""

""Because I recognized something in you. Something I saw in Sophia. Raw potential, wrapped in other people's expectations. A diamond they tried to pass off as glass.""

My heart pounded. ""I don't understand.""

""Don't you?"" She leaned forward. ""I watched you try to fit their mold. Watched you shut away parts of yourself to please them. Watched them clip your wings while convincing you it was for your own good.""

Tears burned my eyes. ""Like the college acceptance.""

""Which Rose sabotaged. Yes, I know about that too. Just like I know about the diary she forged, the jobs she made sure you didn't get, the friends she slowly turned against you.""

""You know everything."" My voice cracked. ""And you just... watched?""

""I waited."" She stood, moving to the window. ""Waited to see if you'd break or bloom. Waited for the moment you finally saw through their perfect lies.""

The confrontation with Rose flashed through my mind. ""And now?""

""Now?"" She turned back to me, sunlight casting her in silhouette. ""Now I'm offering you a choice. You can walk away from all of this. I'll set you up somewhere new, comfortable, far from them. Or...""

""Or?""

""Or I can teach you to be what they always feared you might become. Powerful. Independent. Free.""

She moved back to my bedside, and suddenly I saw what made her so formidable. It wasn't just the money or the influence. It was the absolute certainty that the world would bend to her will.

""Your sister spent twenty years teaching you about manipulation,"" she continued. ""Let me teach you about power. Real power, not the petty games she plays.""

""Why?"" I had to know. ""Because I look like your daughter?""

""No."" Her hand touched mine, surprisingly warm. ""Because you look like I did, forty years ago. Before I learned that the world doesn't give you what you deserve, it gives you what you have the strength to take.""

I stared at our joined hands, seeing the perfect manicure that probably cost more than my monthly salary. ""And if I say yes?""

""Then I adopt you. Publicly, legally, completely. You become Camille Kane, heir to everything I've built."" Her smile turned sharp. ""Imagine your sister's face when she realizes the investor she's been desperately courting is her 'weak' little sister.""

The thought sent a thrill through me. ""She'd lose her mind.""

""That's just the beginning. I'll teach you everything I know. Business. Strategy. Power. In five years, you won't just survive their games, you'll rewrite the rules.""

""And what do you get out of this?""

Victoria's eyes met mine, and for a moment I saw raw honesty. ""A chance to finish what Sophia started. A chance to see someone bloom instead of break. And..."" A pause. ""A chance to have a daughter again.""

I thought about my life, the careful box they'd put me in, the dreams they'd stolen, the lies they'd fed me. Thought about Rose's smug smile and Stefan's betrayal and my parents' willing blindness.

""When do we start?""

Victoria's smile was like sunrise, brilliant and inevitable. ""We already have.""

She reached for a folder on the bedside table. ""First, we need to establish your disappearance. Make them think their thugs succeeded.""

""Let them think I'm..."" Understanding dawned. ""Let them think they broke me.""

""For now."" She opened the folder, revealing documents, passports, bank statements. ""While you heal, while you learn, while you become who you were meant to be.""

I sat up straighter, ignoring the pain in my ribs. ""And then?""

""And then?"" Victoria Kane, my new mother, smiled like a queen bestowing kingdoms. ""Then we show them exactly what happens when you try to cage a wolf in sheep's clothing.""

Looking at her, I finally understood what real power looked like. Not Rose's petty manipulations or Stefan's inherited privilege. This was something else. Something primal. Something they'd tried to crush in me.

But they'd failed.

And now they'd pay.

""When can I sign the papers?"" I asked.

Victoria's laugh was rich with promise. ""That's my girl.......

\- A 100% stocks portfolio has a 95% chance of surviving 30 years with an inflation-adjusted 4% withdrawal rate

\- A 50/50 stocks/bonds split has a 95% chance of surviving 30 years with an inflation-adjusted 4% withdrawal rate

The usual wisdom that ""bonds decrease risk"" doesn't seem to hold true according to these numbers.

Given that they both have the exact same chance of success, why would one prefer one allocation over the other?

EDIT: Because it doesn't seem to be clear what I'm asking here, I'm not asking if increasing the amount of bonds in the portfolio decreases risk.  I know that's the common wisdom.  I'm asking if I understand the Morning Star report's conclusion correctly that that DOESN'T ACTUALLY SEEM TO BE TRUE for the 4% rule (i.e. both a 100% stock allocation and a 50/50 split have the exact same chance of success over 30 years with the same withdrawal rules.)

For instance, in the early to mid-aughts it was fairly easy to strike up conversations with both men and women at the gym.  Sure, some folks would listen to their walkman and iPods were starting to gain traction, but people were open to casual conversations for the most part.  Whereas today when I am at the gym there is literally no one who isn't wearing headphones (oftentimes noise cancelling headphones) and in between sets folks are on their phones.  It's incredibly rare to see two strangers talking to one another, most often it's just a head nod.  This behavior holds true at the coffee shop, grocery store, and really anywhere else we're out and about.

I think right before smartphones came out you could meet someone online (although it was considered strange and definitely wasn't mainstream) and you could meet people 'in the wild' because people weren't necessarily glued to their phones.  I suppose we were all young enough then that we had multiple friends who were single and we could go out with them and meet other single people, and not everyone was yet settled down.

1ltwj0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1ltwj0o/my_coldhearted_husbands_regret/,My Coldhearted Husband’s Regret:,"Elara Vance stepped out of the car, her heart racing with anticipation. After three weeks apart from her family, she had flown to Andoria on her birthday, hoping to surprise Damien and Cora. The sprawling Thorne estate loomed before her, its grand façade a stark reminder of the wealth and power of the family she had married into.



""Welcome home, Mrs. Thorne,"" the housekeeper, Mrs. Gable, greeted her at the door with a warm smile.



""Thank you, Mrs. Gable. Where are Damien and Cora?"" Elara asked, removing her light jacket.



Mrs. Gable's smile faltered. ""Mr. Thorne is at the office. He mentioned he would be late today. Cora is in the playroom with her tutor.""



Disappointment settled in Elara's chest, but she pushed it aside. ""I'll go see Cora then.""



Walking through the familiar hallways, Elara paused outside the playroom door. Laughter drifted out – her daughter's voice mixed with the tutor's. She entered with a bright smile.



""Cora, sweetheart! Mommy's here!""



Her six-year-old daughter looked up from her craft project, surprise rather than joy crossing her features. ""Mommy? I thought you were in New York.""



""I came to spend my birthday with you and Daddy,"" Elara explained, kneeling beside Cora's chair.



Cora's attention quickly returned to her project – a handmade card decorated with glitter and stickers. ""Look what I'm making!""



""It's beautiful, sweetheart. Is it for Daddy?"" Elara asked, eager to connect.



""No, it's for Auntie Vivi. She's taking me to the zoo tomorrow!"" Cora exclaimed, her eyes lighting up.



Elara's smile froze. Vivienne Dubois – Damien's not-so-secret mistress and, painfully, Elara's half-sister. ""That's... nice of her.""



""She's the best! She always brings me presents and takes me fun places,"" Cora continued, unaware of the knife twisting in her mother's heart.



""I see,"" Elara managed. ""Well, I'm here now. Maybe we can do something special together?""



Cora shrugged. ""But I already made plans with Auntie Vivi.""



The tutor, sensing the tension, discreetly excused herself.



Elara took a steadying breath. ""Cora, it's my birthday today. Don't you want to spend some time with me?""



Cora looked up, a flicker of guilt crossing her face. ""Oh. Happy birthday, Mommy."" She hesitated, then returned to her card. ""Can I finish this first? It's really important.""



More important than me, Elara thought bitterly. She stood, forcing a smile. ""Of course, sweetheart. I'll see you at dinner.""



Retreating to the master bedroom, Elara unpacked her suitcase with methodical movements, fighting back tears. She had hoped this trip would be different – that maybe, just maybe, her husband and daughter would remember her birthday, would want to celebrate with her.



Her phone buzzed with a message from Damien: ""Working late. Don't wait for dinner.""



No acknowledgment of her arrival. No mention of her birthday. Just another dismissal.



Hours later, Elara sat alone at the dinner table, picking at her food as Cora chatted excitedly about her day with the tutor and her plans with ""Auntie Vivi.""



""Daddy said he might come to the zoo too, if he finishes his meetings,"" Cora announced.



Elara's fork clattered against her plate. ""Did he? That would be nice.""



""Uh-huh! We're going to have ice cream after, and Auntie Vivi said I could stay up late to watch the new princess movie!""



Elara nodded, her throat tight. ""That sounds wonderful, darling.""



After putting Cora to bed, Elara waited in the living room. The grandfather clock ticked away the minutes, then hours. At midnight, the front door finally opened.



Damien entered, his tall frame silhouetted against the doorway, surprise registering on his face when he saw her.



""You're still awake,"" he stated, loosening his tie.



""It's my birthday,"" Elara said softly.



His expression didn't change. ""Is it? I apologize for forgetting. Happy birthday, Elara.""



Seven years of marriage, and he couldn't remember the date. Seven years of loving him, and he couldn't muster even a hint of warmth.



""Thank you,"" she replied, her voice hollow.



""I have an early meeting tomorrow. Goodnight."" He turned toward the guest bedroom he had been occupying for months.



""Damien,"" she called after him. ""I was hoping we could have lunch together tomorrow. Since you missed dinner tonight.""



He paused. ""I'll check my schedule.""



The next morning, Elara woke early, determined to salvage something from this trip. She chose her outfit carefully – a blue dress Damien had once commented on years ago – and styled her hair with extra care.



Passing by Cora's room, she overheard her daughter talking on the phone.



""I can't wait to see you, Auntie Vivi! I wish you could be my mommy instead.""



Elara froze, her hand on the doorknob. The words pierced through her like physical pain.



""My real mommy is here, but she's always sad. Daddy doesn't smile when she's around. I like it better when it's just us with you.""



Backing away silently, Elara retreated to her room, the cruel words echoing in her mind. She sat on the edge of the bed, staring blankly at the wall as tears streamed down her face.



At noon, she composed herself enough to check if Damien would keep their lunch date. His assistant answered.



""I'm sorry, Mrs. Thorne. Mr. Thorne had a change of plans. He left the office an hour ago.""



Elara thanked her and hung up. On impulse, she drove to Damien's favorite restaurant. As she approached the entrance, she saw them through the window – Damien, Vivienne, and Cora, laughing together at a corner table. The perfect family portrait, with no space for her.



Something hardened inside Elara. Seven years of hoping, waiting, trying. Seven years of watching her husband love another woman – her own half-sister. Seven years of losing her daughter's affection to that same woman.



Enough.



She drove back to the estate with newfound clarity. In the home office, she drafted a divorce agreement – fair, generous even. She had no interest in Damien's money or properties. She wanted only what was rightfully hers, including shared custody of Cora.



When she finished, she sealed the document in an envelope and left it on Damien's desk with his name written in her elegant handwriting.



""Mrs. Gable,"" she called, finding the housekeeper in the kitchen. ""Please ensure Mr. Thorne receives this when he returns.""



Mrs. Gable's eyes widened slightly at Elara's calm demeanor. ""Of course, Mrs. Thorne. Will you be here for dinner?""



""No,"" Elara replied, her voice steadier than it had been in years. ""I'm leaving now. Please have my luggage brought to the car.""



Outside, the driver waited by the sleek black car. ""Where to, Mrs. Thorne?""



Elara looked back at the mansion one last time, at the gilded cage she had willingly entered seven years ago.



""To the airport,"" she said firmly.



It was time to reclaim her life.

...

Damien Thorne pulled into the driveway of his estate, the sleek black car coming to a smooth stop. Beside him, Cora bounced in her seat, still bubbling with excitement from their day out.



""That was the best day ever, Daddy!"" she exclaimed, unbuckling her seatbelt with practiced ease.



Damien smiled at his daughter. ""I'm glad you enjoyed it, princess.""



As they entered the grand foyer, Mrs. Gable approached them, her expression unreadable. ""Welcome home, Mr. Thorne, Miss Cora.""



""Mrs. Gable,"" Damien nodded, handing her his coat. ""Any calls?""



""Mrs. Thorne was here earlier today,"" she replied, her tone carefully neutral.



Cora's eyes widened. ""Mommy was here? Did she leave already?""



""Yes, Miss Cora. She left for the airport about two hours ago.""



Damien frowned slightly. ""I wasn't aware she was planning to visit.""



""She said it was a surprise,"" Mrs. Gable explained. ""She seemed quite upset when she left.""



Cora shrugged, already losing interest. ""Good. I didn't want her to ruin our plans with Auntie Vivi tomorrow.""



""Cora,"" Damien admonished gently, though without much conviction. He turned back to Mrs. Gable. ""Did she say why she was upset?""



""No, sir."" Mrs. Gable hesitated before adding, ""But she left this for you."" She handed him a cream-colored envelope with his name written in Elara's elegant handwriting.



Damien took it, turning it over in his hands with mild curiosity. ""Thank you, Mrs. Gable.""



""Daddy, can I watch my movie now?"" Cora asked, tugging at his sleeve.



""Of course. I'll be in my office if you need me.""



Damien walked to his study, envelope in hand. He placed it on his desk, intending to read it after checking his emails. Elara was probably just upset about him forgetting her birthday. It wouldn't be the first time she had written him a letter expressing her disappointment.



Before he could open it, his phone rang. Vivienne's name flashed on the screen.



""Vivienne,"" he answered, a smile warming his voice.



""I was just calling to say how much I enjoyed today,"" her sultry voice came through. ""And to confirm our plans for tomorrow.""



""Of course. Cora can't stop talking about the zoo.""



""I can't wait. And what about tonight?"" she asked suggestively.



Damien glanced at the envelope, then pushed it aside. ""I can be there in an hour.""



""Perfect. Don't keep me waiting too long.""



After the call, Damien gathered what he needed for the night. The envelope lay forgotten on his desk as he left, his mind already occupied with thoughts of Vivienne.



\---



Morning sunlight filtered through the blinds of Elara's apartment in the city. She had purchased it years ago as an investment property, never thinking she would one day use it as her escape.



The space was sparsely furnished but elegant, much like Elara herself. She had spent the night methodically unpacking the essentials she had brought from New York – clothes, toiletries, a few cherished books.



Sitting at her dining table with a cup of tea, she opened her laptop and logged into her bank account. With steady hands, she transferred just over three million dollars from her personal account to a new one she had created yesterday.



It was money Damien had given her over the years – ""spending money,"" he had called it. Money she had barely touched, preferring to earn her own salary as head of his secretarial team.



""It's not about the money,"" she whispered to herself, closing her laptop with finality.



Her phone vibrated with an incoming call. For a heartbeat, she wondered if it might be Damien, finally noticing her absence. But the screen showed Chloe's name instead.



""Hey,"" Elara answered, her voice steadier than she expected.



""You did it, didn't you?"" Chloe asked without preamble. ""You finally left him.""



""Yes.""



""God, it's about time!"" Chloe's relief was palpable through the phone. ""Where are you now? Do you need anything?""



""I'm at my apartment in the city. I'm fine, Chloe."" Elara's gaze drifted to the unpacked boxes. ""Better than fine, actually.""



""Have you heard from him yet?""



""No. I doubt he's even noticed I'm gone."" The truth of that statement didn't hurt as much as she thought it would.



""What about Cora?""



Elara's heart tightened. ""I usually call her every night when I'm away. I didn't call last night.""



""And?""



""And nothing. No missed calls. No messages asking where I am."" Elara took a steadying breath. ""It's clearer than ever that I'm not needed in that house.""



""You're doing the right thing, El. It's time you put yourself first for once.""



After ending the call, Elara showered and dressed with care. She chose a simple navy blue dress that she hadn't worn in years – something professional but distinctly not part of her ""Mrs. Thorne"" wardrobe.



She had one more tie to sever.



\---



Thorne Industries occupied the top floors of a gleaming skyscraper in the heart of the financial district. Elara had worked there for the past five years, rising to head of the secretarial team through genuine talent and dedication, despite the whispers about nepotism.



She bypassed the executive elevators she usually took with Damien, instead joining other employees in the main lift. A few gave her curious glances – Mrs. Thorne rarely came in without her husband, and never dressed so... ordinarily.



Marcus Cole, the Human Resources Director, looked up in surprise when she knocked on his door.



""Mrs. Thorne! I wasn't expecting you today.""



""Please, call me Elara,"" she said, taking a seat across from him. ""I won't be Mrs. Thorne much longer.""



Marcus blinked, clearly caught off guard. ""I... see.""



She placed a sealed envelope on his desk. ""My resignation, effective immediately. I've already prepared detailed handover notes for my team.""



""This is quite sudden,"" Marcus said, picking up the envelope cautiously, as if it might burn him. ""Does Mr. Thorne know about this?""



""He will soon enough."" Elara's smile was small but resolute. ""I've accumulated quite a bit of vacation time. I'd like to use that instead of working through a notice period, if that's acceptable.""



Marcus nodded slowly, still processing. ""Of course. That's perfectly within company policy.""



""Thank you. I've already cleared out my desk."" She stood, extending her hand. ""It's been a pleasure working with you, Marcus.""



He took her hand, his expression a mix of confusion and concern. ""Likewise, Mrs... Elara. If you don't mind my asking, what do you plan to do now?""



For the first time in years, Elara smiled without restraint. ""I'm going back to where I belong.""



As she left his office, Elara felt a weight lifting from her shoulders. Seven years of trying to be the perfect wife to a man who didn't want her. Seven years of dimming her own light to accommodate his indifference.



No more.



Her phone vibrated in her purse. She checked the screen – Julian Croft, her old college friend and business partner, the man she had abandoned her dreams for when she married Damien.



""Perfect timing,"" she murmured, answering the call as she stepped into the elevator. ""Julian? Yes, it's done. I'm coming home.""



The elevator doors closed on Elara Vance – not Thorne – standing tall, her face set with quiet determination as she descended away from the empire her husband had built, toward the life she had once forsaken.

...

Marcus Cole stared at the resignation letter long after Elara had departed. He had witnessed the cold dynamic between Damien Thorne and his wife for years. The countless times she had waited patiently outside his office door. The way her face would light up with hope at just a moment of his acknowledgment. The inevitable disappointment when that moment never came.



He slipped the envelope into Damien's inbox, knowing full well it might sit there for days before being noticed. Damien Thorne rarely checked items that didn't come with urgent flags from his assistants.



Marcus remembered when Elara first joined Thorne Industries. Despite being the CEO's wife, she had started at an entry-level position, refusing special treatment. Her intelligence and dedication had quickly propelled her up the ranks to head of the secretarial team.



All of it, Marcus knew, had been for Damien's attention. Attention that never materialized.



His intercom buzzed. ""Mr. Cole, Mr. Thorne is requesting the quarterly projections.""



""I'll bring them right in,"" Marcus replied, gathering the requested documents.



When he entered Damien's office, the CEO barely looked up from his computer.



""Just leave them there,"" Damien said, gesturing vaguely to the corner of his desk.



Marcus placed the folder down, noticing the unopened cream-colored envelope still sitting where Mrs. Gable had left it yesterday. Beside it was Elara's resignation letter, also unopened.



""Will Mrs. Thorne be joining you for the charity gala next week?"" Marcus asked, testing the waters.



Damien's brow furrowed slightly. ""I assume so. Why?""



""No reason,"" Marcus replied. ""The event coordinator was asking about final headcounts.""



Damien nodded dismissively, already refocused on his screen. Marcus left quietly, deciding against mentioning Elara's resignation. The man would discover it soon enough.



\---



Elara placed a potted peace lily on her kitchen counter, adjusting it until she was satisfied with its position. Sunlight streamed through the windows of her apartment, illuminating the space she was gradually making her own.



Her phone chimed with a text from Chloe: ""Lunch tomorrow? Need all the details!""



Elara smiled, typing back a quick confirmation. She set her phone down and surveyed the groceries she'd just purchased. For the first time in years, she had bought only what she liked, without considering Damien's preferences or Cora's picky habits.



The thought of Cora sent a pang through her heart. Three days had passed since she'd left the Thorne mansion, and she hadn't received a single call from her daughter. Not even to ask where she was.



She pushed the painful thought aside and began putting away her groceries. The refrigerator looked pathetically empty with just her items, but there was something liberating about it too. This space was entirely hers.



After finishing, Elara settled on her couch and picked up her phone again. She scrolled through her contacts until she found the number she needed.



""Hello, Sandra? It's Elara Vance,"" she said when the call connected. ""Yes, it's been a while... I was wondering if you could reserve a ticket for me for the TechFuture Exhibition next week? I'm planning to attend this year.""



She listened to the response, a small smile forming on her lips. ""Yes, that's right. I'm coming back to YodaVision. Julian and I have discussed it... No, I'm not with Thorne Industries anymore.""



The conversation continued as Elara confirmed details about the exhibition. When she hung up, she felt a surge of excitement. The tech world had been her passion before marriage, before she'd set aside her dreams to be Damien's perfect wife.



The rest of her day passed in a blur of productivity. She organized her home office, contacted old colleagues, and reviewed the latest developments in artificial intelligence that she had missed during her years away.



That evening, she realized she hadn't checked her personal email all day. She opened her inbox to find it disappointingly empty of any messages from Damien or Cora. Not even to ask where she was or why she hadn't come home.



Elara closed her laptop with a sigh. It shouldn't surprise her, but somehow the complete silence still stung. Had she really meant so little to them that her absence didn't even warrant a question?



\---



In Andoria, Cora's face crumpled as Vivienne zipped her suitcase closed.



""Why can't you stay longer?"" Cora pleaded, trailing after Vivienne as she moved around the luxurious hotel suite.



""I have to get back, sweetie,"" Vivienne replied, checking her reflection in the mirror. ""I have important meetings that can't wait.""



""But I don't want you to go!"" Cora's voice rose to a wail. ""It's not fair!""



Damien entered from the adjoining room, his expression softening at the sight of his distraught daughter. ""Cora, we've talked about this. Vivienne has responsibilities back home.""



""Then I want to go home too!"" Cora stomped her foot. ""I hate it here without Vivi!""



Vivienne knelt down, brushing Cora's hair back. ""I'll see you again soon, I promise. And you still have your daddy here.""



""It's not the same!"" Tears streamed down Cora's face. ""I want to go home now!""



Damien exchanged a glance with Vivienne before lifting Cora into his arms. ""Actually,"" he said calmly, ""we're going back next week.""



Cora's sobs quieted. ""Really?""



""Yes,"" Damien confirmed. ""I've already made arrangements to wrap up business here early.""



""Will you be at our house when we get back?"" Cora asked Vivienne eagerly.



Vivienne smiled, her perfectly manicured hand resting briefly on Damien's arm. ""I might just be.""



Damien's phone vibrated in his pocket. He shifted Cora to his other arm and checked the screen. It was Marcus Cole. He declined the call, making a mental note to check in with him later.



""Now, let's get Vivienne to the airport,"" he said, setting Cora down. ""And if you're good, we can get ice cream afterward.""



As they left the suite, Damien's thoughts turned briefly to the work awaiting him back home. Not once did he wonder about Elara. Not once did he consider what he might find upon his return.



The elevator doors closed on the three of them – Vivienne elegant and composed, Cora still sniffling but calmer, and Damien unaware of the seismic shift that awaited him back home.



In her apartment across the ocean, Elara continued her quiet revolution, preparing for a future she was finally brave enough to claim for herself. A future that would soon collide with the past she thought she had left behind.

...

Cora clutched her phone tightly, her thumb hovering over her mother's contact. She had already ended the call once, and now guilt gnawed at her. Dad and Vivienne were chatting in the next room, their voices a low murmur through the hotel wall.



She flopped back on the bed with a sigh. Mom would definitely ask questions. And if Cora mentioned Vivienne was coming back with them, Mom would get that tight look on her face—the one where her smile didn't reach her eyes.



Her phone buzzed suddenly. Mom calling back.



Panic flared in Cora's chest. She silenced the phone and shoved it under her pillow. The screen glowed briefly before going dark.



""Cora? Are you packed?"" Her father's voice called from the doorway.



She sat up quickly. ""Almost done, Dad.""



Damien stepped into the room, his tall figure casting a shadow across the carpet. ""Good. Vivienne's driver will be here soon.""



""I can't wait to get home,"" Cora said, excitement bubbling up again. ""And Vivi's really going to visit us there?""



Her father's face softened slightly. ""Yes, she'll be staying at the house for a while.""



""Mom won't like that,"" Cora mumbled before she could stop herself.



A flicker of irritation crossed Damien's face. ""Your mother doesn't dictate who visits our home.""



Something about his tone made Cora look down. She knew things weren't good between her parents. They barely talked anymore, and when they did, the air felt cold and heavy.



""Have you spoken to your mother today?"" Damien asked, his voice neutral.



Cora shook her head quickly. ""No. She's probably busy with work stuff.""



He nodded, seeming satisfied with her answer. ""Finish packing. We leave for the airport in thirty minutes.""



When he left, Cora pulled out her phone again. Three missed calls from Mom. She bit her lip, then turned the phone off completely.



\---



Elara stared at her silent phone, anxiety building with each unanswered call. It wasn't like Cora to call and hang up. What if something was wrong?



She paced her apartment, debating whether to call Damien. Their agreement had been minimal contact except regarding Cora, but surely this qualified.



Before she could decide, her phone rang. Hope surged until she saw Mrs. Gable's name on the screen.



""Hello, Mrs. Gable,"" she answered quickly. ""Have you heard from Cora? She called me but hung up, and now she's not answering.""



""Miss Cora is fine, ma'am,"" Mrs. Gable assured her. ""I just spoke with her. They're preparing to leave for the airport.""



Relief flooded through Elara. ""Thank you. Did she say why she called me?""



""No, ma'am. But children are fickle with their attentions,"" Mrs. Gable said kindly. ""Will you be needing anything from the house today?""



Elara shook her head, then remembered she was on the phone. ""No, thank you. I'm all settled in the apartment now.""



After hanging up, she walked to her window. The city sprawled below, busy and indifferent to her worries. She'd made the right choice leaving, she reminded herself. But moments like these—when the distance between her and Cora felt vast—made her doubt.



Her doorbell rang, startling her from her thoughts.



Her neighbor, Clara Hayes, stood in the hallway holding a plate of cookies. ""Thought you might like something homemade,"" she said with a warm smile.



Elara accepted the plate gratefully. ""That's very kind of you.""



Clara waved dismissively. ""It's nothing. I remember how it was starting over on my own after my divorce. Sometimes a friendly face makes all the difference.""



They chatted for a few minutes before Clara excused herself. Elara placed the cookies on her counter, oddly touched by the simple gesture. It had been ages since someone had done something nice for her without an agenda.



\---



Later that afternoon, Elara's phone chimed with an email notification. Crestwood College was celebrating its centennial next week. Her alma mater. The place where she'd first fallen in love with artificial intelligence—and where she'd met Julian.



On impulse, she decided to visit the campus. Perhaps walking those familiar paths would help quiet the restlessness inside her.



The university hadn't changed much. Ivy still clung to the old brick buildings. Students lounged on the grass, absorbed in their devices or conversations. Elara felt a pang of nostalgia as she passed the computer science building where she'd spent countless hours coding and theorizing.



""Elara? Elara Vance?""



She turned at the sound of her name. A tall man with dark-rimmed glasses was staring at her in disbelief.



""Julian,"" she breathed, recognizing him instantly despite the years.



Julian Croft's face broke into a wide grin. ""I thought that was you! What are you doing here?""



""Just reminiscing,"" she said, suddenly self-conscious. ""The alumni email about the centennial made me nostalgic.""



""Well, this is perfect timing. I've been meaning to reach out to you."" His eyes sparkled with excitement. ""Have time for coffee? The old café is still there.""



Twenty minutes later, they sat at a corner table in the campus café, steaming mugs between them. Julian hadn't changed much—still animated when he talked, hands gesturing to emphasize his points.



""So, YodaVision has expanded into predictive healthcare AI,"" he explained. ""The algorithms we started developing in grad school? They're the foundation for systems now being tested in hospitals across the country.""



Pride swelled in Elara's chest. ""That's amazing, Julian. You've accomplished so much.""



""We started it together,"" he reminded her. ""Your theoretical framework was revolutionary. I've just been building on it."" He paused, studying her face. ""Why did you leave, Elara? You were the visionary between us.""



The question hung in the air. Elara traced the rim of her mug with her finger. ""Marriage. Life. Choices that seemed right at the time.""



""And now?""



She looked up at him. ""Now I'm getting divorced.""



Julian's expression softened. ""I'm sorry.""



""Don't be,"" she said quickly. ""It's been a long time coming.""



A silence fell between them, comfortable despite the years apart.



""What will you do now?"" Julian finally asked.



Elara shrugged. ""Start over, I suppose. Though where, I'm not sure. The tech world moves so fast. I've been out of it for six years.""



Julian leaned forward, his eyes intense. ""Come back to YodaVision.""



""What?"" The suggestion caught her off guard.



""I'm serious. We need you. The company needs you. We've grown, but we've never found someone with your vision.""



Elara shook her head. ""Julian, I wouldn't even know where to begin. The field has advanced so much—""



""You'll catch up,"" he interrupted. ""You were always the quickest learner I knew.""



""It's not that simple,"" Elara protested. ""I've been working as a secretary, for God's sake. My skills are rusty at best, obsolete at worst.""



""So you'll refresh them,"" Julian countered. ""Look, we have a project right now that could benefit enormously from your perspective. It's a perfect re-entry point.""



Elara felt a flutter of something she hadn't experienced in years—excitement mingled with fear. The idea of returning to AI work was both thrilling and terrifying.



""I don't know,"" she said honestly. ""What if I can't do it anymore? What if I've lost whatever talent I had?""



Julian reached across the table, covering her hand with his. ""You haven't. Talent like yours doesn't disappear.""



""Six years is a long time,"" she insisted. ""The industry has changed completely.""



""But the fundamentals haven't. And neither has your mind."" Julian squeezed her hand before withdrawing. ""Just come tour the lab. Meet the team. No pressure, just see what we're working on.""



Elara hesitated, memories of her last days at YodaVision flooding back. She'd left to focus on her marriage to Damien, believing it was the right choice. What a fool she'd been.



""What position would I even fill?"" she asked, her voice small.



""Head of Research and Development,"" Julian replied without hesitation. ""The role has been waiting for you.""



""You can't be serious."" Elara stared at him. ""You've kept a C-suite position open for six years?""



""Not officially open,"" he admitted. ""But no one's been right for it. Not the way you would be.""



The confidence in his voice made something shift inside her. Could she really do this? Return to the field she'd abandoned, take leadership of cutting-edge research? The thought was simultaneously exhilarating and terrifying.



Julian watched her, patient but eager. ""Say yes, Elara. Come back where you belong.""



She opened her mouth, but fear froze the words in her throat. The enormity of what he was offering—a chance to reclaim her former passion, her expertise—collided with the crushing self-doubt that had grown during her years with Damien.



""But I... I..."" Her voice trailed off, revealing the depth of her uncertainty. Could she really step back into that world after so long away? Or would she fail spectacularly, confirming what a part of her had feared all along—that she had sacrificed her brilliance for a marriage that had never truly existed?

...

Elara sat frozen across from Julian, his offer hanging between them. Once, she would have jumped at this opportunity without hesitation. Now, doubt clouded her mind like a thick fog.



""Elara?"" Julian leaned forward. ""Talk to me.""



She took a deep breath. ""It's been so long, Julian. I gave up everything for my marriage. What if I can't get it back?""



""The Elara I knew wouldn't ask that question."" His eyes held hers steadily. ""She'd roll up her sleeves and prove everyone wrong.""



A flicker of the old fire stirred in her chest. ""That Elara disappeared years ago.""



""I don't believe that."" Julian tapped the table between them. ""The work you did on neural network applications was revolutionary. That brilliance doesn't just vanish.""



Elara stared into her coffee cup. For years, she'd suppressed her ambitions to be the perfect wife and mother. A wife Damien barely noticed. A mother Cora increasingly pushed away.



""What would I even bring to the table now?"" she asked quietly.



Julian pulled out his tablet and showed her the company's latest projects. ""We've expanded, but we're struggling with the intuitive interface algorithms you were developing before you left.""



As he explained their challenges, Elara found herself instinctively analyzing the problems. Her mind raced with potential solutions, connections forming like they used to years ago.



""You could approach it from a different angle,"" she said without thinking. ""If you restructured the decision trees to incorporate emotional intelligence patterns...""



Julian grinned. ""See? Still brilliant.""



Warmth spread through her chest—not from embarrassment, but recognition. This was who she used to be. Who she could be again.



""When would you need me to start?"" The words surprised even her.



Julian's eyes widened. ""Is that a yes?""



She straightened her shoulders. ""It's a maybe. I need to think about logistics.""



""Take the weekend,"" Julian said quickly. ""But I want you in the lab on Monday. Just to look around, meet everyone. No pressure.""



Elara nodded slowly. ""I can do that.""



As they said goodbye outside the café, Julian hugged her. ""It's good to see you again, Elara. The real you.""



His words echoed in her mind as she walked across campus. The real her. Had she been living as someone else these past years?



Her phone buzzed. A text from Eleanor Thorne: ""Family dinner this Sunday. Mandatory attendance.""



Elara sighed. Eleanor's ""mandatory"" family dinners were becoming more frequent since Elara moved out. An obvious attempt to force her and Damien together.



Before she could respond, another message appeared—this one from Sabrina Thorne, Damien's sister.



""Are you at Crestwood? Leo's friend thought he saw you.""



Elara frowned. Leo was Sabrina's son who attended Crestwood. How typical of Sabrina to keep tabs on her.



""Yes, visiting my alma mater,"" she replied simply.



Three dots appeared immediately. ""Meet me at the alumni center. I'm here for a committee meeting.""



It wasn't a request. Elara considered ignoring it, but decided against creating unnecessary tension. With renewed confidence from her conversation with Julian, she headed toward the alumni center.



Sabrina stood outside, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit, tapping her designer heel impatiently. When she spotted Elara, her eyebrows rose.



""What are you doing here?"" she asked without preamble.



Elara kept her voice even. ""Hello to you too, Sabrina.""



""Don't you have work? Or are you still taking that 'break' from Thorne Industries?"" Sabrina made air quotes around the word ""break.""



""I'm exploring other opportunities,"" Elara replied.



Sabrina snorted. ""Like what? You've been Damien's secretary for years.""



""I was head of the secretarial department,"" Elara corrected. ""And before that, I was in artificial intelligence research.""



""Right."" Sabrina clearly didn't believe her. ""Well, since you're here, you can do me a favor. Leo's been complaining about cafeteria food. Could you make him those dumplings he likes? I'll have him stop by the house tomorrow.""



The old Elara would have agreed immediately. But Julian's words rang in her ears: ""The real you.""



""I'm afraid I can't,"" she said firmly. ""I have plans tomorrow.""



Sabrina blinked, clearly surprised by the refusal. ""What plans?""



""Personal ones."" Elara shifted her purse strap. ""Besides, I've moved out temporarily, as you know.""



""Temporarily,"" Sabrina echoed with a raised eyebrow. ""Is that what we're calling it?""



Before Elara could respond, two elegantly dressed women approached Sabrina.



""There you are!"" one of them called. ""We're about to discuss the donor wall.""



""Coming,"" Sabrina replied, then gestured vaguely toward Elara. ""This is... a friend. Elara.""



A friend. Not sister-in-law. Not even by her full name. Just ""a friend.""



The slight was calculated, designed to diminish her. Six months ago, it would have worked. Today, it merely reinforced her decision.



""Nice meeting you,"" Elara said pleasantly to the women. ""I need to get going. I have a business meeting to prepare for.""



She walked away before Sabrina could respond, her stride purposeful. With each step, her resolve strengthened. She pulled out her phone and dialed Julian.



""It's Elara,"" she said when he answered. ""I'll take the job. No need to wait until Monday.""



Julian's whoop of joy made her smile. ""That's the best news I've had all year! I'll email you the paperwork tonight.""



As she ended the call, a weight lifted from her shoulders. For the first time in years, she was making a decision solely for herself. Not for Damien, not for the Thorne family reputation. For Elara Vance.

Two weeks later, Damien Thorne pulled into the driveway of his mansion, Cora chattering excitedly in the passenger seat.



""And then Vivienne said we could go riding again next weekend!"" Cora bounced in her seat. ""Do you think Mom will want to come too?""



Damien tensed slightly at the mention of Elara. ""Your mother isn't much for horseback riding.""



""She could watch,"" Cora insisted. ""I want to show her how good I am now.""



He didn't respond as they entered the house. Mr. Finch, the butler, greeted them in the foyer.



""Welcome home, sir. Miss Cora,"" he said formally. ""How was your trip?""



""The best!"" Cora declared. ""Where's Mom? I want to tell her everything!""



Mr. Finch hesitated. ""Mrs. Thorne isn't here at present.""



Damien frowned. ""Where is she?""



""Mrs. Thorne left on a business trip shortly after you departed,"" Mr. Finch explained. ""She called to check on Miss Cora several times.""



""A business trip?"" Damien repeated. ""What business trip?""



""I'm not privy to the details, sir,"" Mr. Finch said carefully. ""But she mentioned it would last approximately two weeks.""



""Two weeks?"" Damien raised an eyebrow. Elara had never taken a business trip in their entire marriage. Her work at Thorne Industries certainly didn't require travel.



""When will she be back?"" Cora asked, disappointment evident in her voice.



""I believe tomorrow or the day after, Miss."" Mr. Finch turned to Damien. ""Would you like me to try reaching her?""



Damien considered this. Two weeks was an unusually long absence for Elara, who typically revolved her schedule around Cora's needs. Still, he supposed she was entitled to whatever this was—perhaps some retreat related to the temporary separation she'd requested.



""No need,"" he said dismissively. ""I'm sure she'll be in touch when she returns.""



""But Dad,"" Cora protested. ""I want to tell her about the horses now.""



""You can tell her when she gets back,"" Damien replied, already checking his phone for emails. ""Go unpack your things.""



As Cora reluctantly headed upstairs, Mr. Finch cleared his throat.



""Sir, if I may... Mrs. Thorne seemed different before she left.""



Damien looked up sharply. ""Different how?""



""More..."" Mr. Finch seemed to search for the right word. ""Determined.""



""Determined,"" Damien repeated flatly.



""Yes, sir. And she took quite a few of her personal belongings.""



Damien processed this information silently. Their separation had been Elara's idea—a ""temporary arrangement"" to give them both space. He had agreed easily enough, seeing no reason to object. Their marriage had been one of convenience from the start.



""Alright,"" he said simply, turning toward his study. ""Have Mrs. Powell prepare dinner for six. Vivienne will be joining us.""



""Very good, sir,"" Mr. Finch replied.



As Damien walked away, he felt a fleeting twinge of something unusual—not quite concern, but a vague discomfort with the situation. Elara had always been predictable, dependable. This sudden two-week absence without detailed explanation was out of character.



He dismissed the thought almost immediately. If Elara needed space, so be it. It changed nothing about his plans or priorities.



Still, as he settled behind his desk, Damien found himself staring at her empty chair across the hall in the small office she sometimes used at home. For the briefest moment, he wondered exactly what kind of ""business"" had taken her away for so long.



Then his phone rang with an important call, and the thought vanished entirely.

And wow I’ve been drinking piss this entire time and no one told me. 

Whole beans are just so much better. Yeah, sure you have to grind them first and all that, but honestly a grinder’s like 25 bucks on Amazon (didn’t pitch for an expensive m=one, since even the coffeemaker’s cheapish). Gamechanger. 

The thing is I’ve tried a couple of random small bags (you guessed it, they’re from costco) and I’m already noticing the difference. But now I wanna get serious about this stuff. Did a little Reddit deep dive before this and came up with [Caffe Borbone](https://lifestylesecretreview.com/dp-B0CCVRNF2J). Here to provide a little context and ask for more reccs. 

Reasons I wanna try Caffe Borbone: 

1. It has some floral notes (Arabica beans) and I’m so curious cos I’ve tried fruity and they’ve been a little bit citrusy so wanna taste the difference. From what I’ve tried in coffee shops, I think floral notes might be more to my taste. 
2. Medium Roast. This I know for sure that I’m only into medium roast coffee, light roast espressos taste like water to me and dark ones are like tar. 
3. Italian. Leaning towards Italian coffees, they seem to have good reviews online and on r/coffee especially for beginners. 
4. Cheap. I know its another mass produced bag, but that makes it cheaper and that’s unfortunately something I have to keep in mind for now. And for the price, I think it's a pretty good deal, considering its not from a big chain that’s selling me idek what in the name of coffee. Been hearing good things about Illy and Lavazza too btw. 

Reasons I haven’t tried Caffe Borbone yet: 

1. I’m fully broke. I wanna invest in a good 2 pound bag to last me a while and it’s not feasible to go around trying $50 bags to see whether I like it or not, so I’m here to gain some more reccs before I settle on one. 

And PLEASE no one recc anything from local roasters, trust me there are none in my area, I’m in the backend of nowhere so Amazon is really the only option and keep the reccs affordable please.

I repotted a bunch of store bought basil plants mid-May, and they’ve been growing pretty well. I went on holiday for a week and when I came back a couple of days ago, my best plant was absolutely covered in aphids!! The rest had a fair amount on them too, as they were being stored near each other, but I’m most upset about my big girl because she was growing so well/bushy :( 

Anyway, I took all of the plants into my bathroom and showered them down for a while until I couldnt see any more aphids, then I sprayed them with a mix of water and dish soap (1tsp soap and \~750ml water), left it for an hour or so and then re-showered them to wash off the soap mixture. I wouldn’t have left them for that long but I forgot so I hope it won’t damage the plants ?! 

I left them in the bathroom for about 24 hours but I do need to shower so I’ve had to remove them, they are now in front of the window in my bedroom so they can soak up some sun (unfortunately my bathroom gets virtually no sunlight). I have a fan pointed towards the window, and a buuuuunch of those sticky bug catchers (yellow shapes in pictures). 

I’m thinking of spraying them down each day, I have a phobia of bugs which I am working through but I just cannot touch them (for squishing/manual removal? I’ve seen people suggest this but I fear I would just be sick if I tried it), and I was also thinking of repeating the bathroom showering process every few days, until the aphids have fully gone - but I’m worried about eggs in the soil not getting washed away and instead being pushed further in?? Is that a concern I should be having?

I’ve also seen online that people suggest neem oil but I have cats so not sure how safe this is? I’ve also seen people suggesting to scatter used and dried coffee grounds over the top of the soil to smother and repel aphids? AGAIN not sure how much to trust this - I only drink instant coffee so I would have to ask my local cafe if they could give me their used coffee grounds? I’ve also seen people suggest lavender oil which I do already have but I am very reluctant to use since it’s cat-toxic!!

My cats are pretty chill and have never tried to eat the basil before but I don’t want to introduce anything that is toxic just in case they do have a little nibble! 

Does anyone have any advice on how I should change my approach to get rid of the aphids as well as what I can do to prevent this happening in the future?",1,1751900123.0,plantclinic,3,1.0,False

My fiancé (24F) is currently fielding options to finally get her bachelors degree in business.

We live in the DMV currently and have lived here our entire lives. We have lived near DC and Baltimore, and some various cities/towns between the two and would like to try moving out of state. 
We bring in about $82k combined (mostly from me as my fiancé is in between jobs and working at a coffee shop to bring in at least something). 

We’re focusing on getting married, paying off debt, buying a home and having a family, so we’re looking for somewhere where we can do those things while fitting our criteria. Important criteria include: 
- good public transport and walkability (fiancé has driving anxiety) 
- younger population so we can make friends
- blue state, very queer friendly/ big queer scene 
- city vibes but don’t want to live in the heart, more so the arm or leg
- decent home prices, good schools and good suburbs to raise a family in
- diversity! We are both black and would like to live somewhere with a good black/poc population

Hi. Anyone have experience living with their landlord? I am choosing between 2 places atm. Both flats. I’ve been in london for a month.

Flat 1- £1150 roughly with bills. Slightly bigger room, my own bathroom but not en-suite. A little bit more choices with transport but no major difference. Gyms and all are nearby, Lidl is closer than Flat 2 😂. Flat has a balcony. I’ve met up with the flatmate for coffee and we seem to get along well- closer in age.

Flat 2- £1100 including bills and free gym, sauna & swimming pool. En-suite. Living with landlord who is 22 years older than me. We’re both working in the same field. He seems pretty nice.

 1. **Glomerular Filtration - The First Filter**

* Blood enters small filters in your kidneys called **glomeruli**.
* These filters let small waste, toxins and small molecules pass through.
* But, they **block big, useful things** like proteins and blood cells, keeping them in your body.
* *You can think of it like a coffee filter, it keeps the grounds, lets the liquid through.*

**2. Tubular Sorting - Deciding What to Keep or Throw Out**

* After filtering, the fluid goes through kidney tubes (renal tubules).
* Here, your kidneys:
   * **Reabsorb** useful things (water, glucose, minerals).
   * **Push out** waste and toxins into the urine.
* This step needs energy (ATP**)**, so healthy mitochondria (your cells’ power source) are important.

**3. Cellular Housekeeping - The Self-Cleaning Trick**

* Some kidney cells can clean themselves using a process called **autophagy**.
* They get rid of their own damaged parts or waste without needing to divide or multiply.
* *It’s like hitting a “self-clean” button to stay fresh and functional.*

1ltw2oh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ltw2oh,Book Loft in stores and I’m just ehhh 🤷🏽‍♀️,"Stopped in early this morning to cash in a reward and I got a sneak peek of some of the new drops. Here’s my take (though no one asked lol) 

My gf actually gifted me her reward bc she wasn’t going to use it before it expired tomorrow so I figured I’d grab Sweetest Song since I already have two of the body butters and the travel perfume, so it just made sense to round it out with the FFM. (And at $18.95, it was the perfect reward pick since it’s never been part of SAS.)

But of course, I had to sniff around while I was there. 😅

Book Loft — I’ve been waiting on this one and was excited to finally see it in-store. The only thing out was the lotion and body cream (no mist yet—they were still unpacking tons of boxes), but I gave it a try. It smells exactly like the candle, which is great. On my skin though? I wasn’t blown away. I didn’t hate it, but I didn’t feel like it had to come home with me. I’ll circle back once the mist is out and see if it moves me then.

🍦 The Vanilla Collection — Gave all three a sniff:
	•	Vanilla Ease immediately gave Aromatherapy Lavender Vanilla. And yep, turned it around and lavender was a top note. If you like that relaxing, spa vibe, you might like this but if you have the aromatherapy one, like I do, you might can skip this one.
	•	Vanilla Romance still isn’t for me. Never loved it then, still don’t love it now.
	•	Vanilla Café is super coffee-forward, and I’m not a coffee scent girl. So that was a quick pass for me.

I didn’t walk out empty-handed (so much for No But July 😅)—bc I lucked up on the last perfume spray of Loyal to You, which felt like finding a hidden gem. Snagged that and the Sweetest Song body spray with my reward, so I still count it as a win. I feel good about not going overboard or impulse buying just for the sake of it. Still on the hunt for my perfect vanilla—something sweet, cozy, but not too foodie or too floral. Open to recs!

What are y’all grabbing from the new drops? Anybody else underwhelmed by Book Loft or is it just me? I think it will layer well with things but it wasn’t love at first sniff on my skin. 🤷🏽‍♀️",19,1751899600.0,bathandbodyworks,9,0.92,False
1ltw232,https://v.redd.it/510fd8essgbf1,My First Week with the Ninja Café Luxe Pro – Tips & Tricks!,"
Just picked up the Ninja Café Luxe Pro and after a week of experimenting (and wasting a bit of coffee), I’ve got some helpful tips—especially for the espresso side of things, which isn’t super clear in most videos out there.

1. Heat. It. Up.
This machine uses a thermal coil, not a dedicated boiler, so you have to run dummy shots. I run 2-3 espresso shots with no grounds, or run a 10oz brew cycle with the coffee basket, then switch to the espresso head and do one more dummy shot. Gets the portafilter and group area nice and hot—otherwise, you’ll get weak shots or nothing at all (hello, overflow tank).

2. No Heated Group Head = DIY Warm-Up
Unlike some machines (like Breville), the group head doesn’t heat itself. So, hot water is your friend. If dumping water feels wasteful, make a tea, or offer someone hot water and pretend it was intentional.

3. Grind Settings & Dialing In
Grind setting 6 is way too fine for most beans. I’ve had better luck between 13–15, depending on the roast. Just remember: new beans = redial. And if the beans are oily or flavored, let them de-gas for a few days first. The machine’s pretty sensitive to that.

4. Tamping – Less Is More
Seriously, don’t Hulk-smash the tamp. The machine does the work. I use one finger until the lever stops moving—twice. Too much pressure = no extraction.

5. Extras Worth Mentioning
	•	Haven’t tried the milk steamer yet, but it seems solid.
	•	Hot water spout is handy if you need to top off an Americano or warm up gear.
	•	You can access the internal burr for micro-adjustments, but unless you’re super confident… maybe don’t.

Final Verdict:
Great little machine once you learn its quirks. Heat it up, be gentle with the tamp, and don’t be afraid to experiment with grind size. If you’re patient, it rewards you with solid espresso.",5,1751899560.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,8,0.78,False

1ltw0ud,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1ltw0ud/im_worried_about_my_inlaws_hygiene_regarding_our/,"I'm worried about my in-laws hygiene, regarding our baby...","I know I'm many months away (but yet not so many). So please bear with me.

I'm 17w now and we are hoping for this pregnancy to go all the way. All check-ups have been good and I'm mostly feeling good so hopefully we'll welcome our baby in December.

Now. I've been worried about my in-laws regarding our baby. They are kind people who mean no harm to anyone. The thing is, that their hygiene is not the best.

My father-in-law works in a career so that his work clothes often get dirty and almost without exception there is a *work smell* of him. He can't seem to smell it and has no sense of taking a shower, for example, before he stops for coffee. He has even come in, wearing dirty work clothes and sat on our new furniture.

My mother-in-law is similar. She doesn't seem to smell bad odor, is bad at taking a shower (should ideally take a shower every day), often has dirty hands and feets (around nails, for example) and walks around in dirty clothes (we're talking so dirty that you don't want to hug her for fear of it getting on your clothes).

They can certainly afford to have new and clean clothes that are kept aside from work clothes.  
*Side-story: I was raised in the countryside and was raised to take a shower and change clothes if you went to visit someone else or went to the next town. It wasn't unless you had to respond to a small errand or an incident that you wore your work clothes (e.g. if you were borrowing a spare part and didn't go in for coffee or a neighbor needed help with livestock).*

My mother-in-law is a woman of taste in so many ways, she makes beautiful and popular things that people buy. Yet she doesn't seem to realize that her coat is so stained that people make faces when she enters events.   
They are both hard workers but they aren't always working and she doesn't work the same job or field as him. It cannot be denied in any way that they are hardworking and lovely. Their house **is not** a dirty mess. BUT still this!

My husband has tried to talk to them about this last few years we've been together, but it usually goes in one ear and out the other. 

With my father-in-law, I think he just doesn't think it's such a big deal and that we're making a big deal out of things. He was raised to not care what people think - and unfortunately, he doesn't care what his son thinks. He sometimes takes in what I have to say, but I just don't think it's my job to tell a grown man to take a shower and change his clothes (while it's not my husband or my dad).

With my mother-in-law, I think it's more related to the depression she's been struggling with over the years and her overweight. She's shown some hoarding behavior over the years, but not in a way that's dangerous. I think this regarding her is because she wants people to see her as ""hardworking"", i.e. that people see it **on her** that she's working and doing a lot of things (she was raised to believe that nothing she did was good enough).

Now that we are expecting a baby later this year, I am starting to worry a little about how they will behave and their hygiene around the baby when it arrives.

I can't imagine them wearing dirty clothes (and I mean dirty with I don't know what in the world on them), with dirty hands and smelly (both work-smell and bad body odor) hugging and cuddling with a newborn who is just starting to build up his immune system outside the womb.

**SO...**

**Can you suggest any ways to start discussing this with them?** Are there any books, podcasts, or articles that can help us with how to open and/or manage the discussion?

They are great in other ways and I don't want to embarrass them or make them feel like we don't want them to be a part of the child's life. I don't want this to come off as an attack on them and their lives.

We are starting to talk with our parents and close family about things like, getting them all vaccinated against whooping cough and that we would like to be alone with the baby for at least the first week, so I'm hoping we can find a way to take this conversation on the same level as the others. 

I know it's a long way off, but considering all the years we've been together and they haven't improved in terms of hygiene, I don't see it happening now regarding this. I believe we will be forced to address this and review the rules we want to have. For example, everyone who wants to hold the baby in the first few weeks washes their hands when arriving to our house and uses sanitizers we buy.

But I feel like it will be harder to address the smell and dirty clothes. Maybe I'm making a big deal out of this as I don't want to offend anyone but I'm happy to take any suggestions regarding how we should handle it. ",1,1751899482.0,pregnant,13,1.0,False
1ltvz91,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1ltvz91/two_years_in_and_still_dont_know_what_to_do/,Two years in and still don't know what to do,"     So I'm going to start this off saying I am lucky. I was a plumber for my entire life and 32 now. I work for a big company and had some what we thought were depression/anxiety issues come up. (I come from an abusive childhood.) They were aware and  helped me move to a work from home position. Less than a month later I started having tonic clonic seizures. I was already set more or less. Less than a month before, my mom totaled my truck, so I didn't have to worry about having to make that payment and all that. We were honestly thinking the depression anxiety were steming from that, she broke her back and was hurt really bad, also she was just getting sober.
     Well she was set up in my living room and I was making coffee and she woke up with me in a puddle of blood from when had my first seizure. Busted my brow open on my deep freezer. My roommates mom has dealt with epilepsy, so he knew what to do. I come conscious in the hospital; they ran some tests and couldn't find an external cause. They referred me to a neurologist. They ran a bunch of different tests. They couldn't find anything. I ended up changing neurologist after I asked if he could take me if the xcopri and asked him what could be causing it at this point. He told me to just take medicine and I don't want to know. It wasn't working and had some crazy side effects. My roommates thought I had brain damage until I was off it. It killed my balance, my short term memory, and my temperament. Like making my depression spriling, or just being an ass. 
    I changed neurologists and the new one put me on keppra, with my lamotrigine. We were hoping the lamotrigine would be two birds one stone. Everything seemed like it was going fine. I wasn't having pain attacks, or even my depression for the most part. I started going to my office and was actually about to go back in the field. I actually hated driving until I couldn't. The day when I'm walking out of my house to go to actually start transitioning back in the field; I had another. Needless to say it completely devastated me. 
    My finances have gone to chaos to say the least. Like I said I'm lucky I have a full time work from home job and make a decent living, but man it nothing like plumbers income. I had originally planned on doing side work; when I moved to work from home until the seizures started. I almost did something very petty afterwards too. Like as soon as the seizure happened that day I let my current manager and my plumbing manager know. They have both been amazing in every regards. So we all knew that I wouldn't be able to go back in the field. Our corporate HR manager calls some special meeting about plumbing was all it said. I asked my managers and they had no idea what it was about.
     We do the teams meeting, and man it was a complete disaster. Apparently it was to talk about me going back in the field. I know with some of our older guy they'll have helpers drive them and all that, so I had a silver of hope that was it. It was just the corporate HR digging into me about my epilepsy. Talking abyhiw id never go back in the field. Tell me to quit if I didn't like it. Saying never moving up or anything other than you're stuck hahaha sucks for you. I asked my manager and the plumbing manager and off the record they were also like what the fuck. Didn't need a meeting to rub it in my face. 
    At this point I have no idea what to do. I'm stuck in my house almost everyday. I can't do a bunch of stuff anymore. 
    The part that gets me though, is I've always been the one people relied on. My official job title when I was a teenager was my dad's babysitter, because I was the only one who could keep him less crazy; when he is on drugs. I'm the one that has to have their shit together. Be there for my brother and sister. Now and I'm so grateful I have to rely my parents for for money for doctors appointments and medication. My brother is now the primary earner in our house hold. Finally got our roommate a good job with me though. He typically buys groceries because I can't most of the time. I'm grateful don't get me wrong, but I just keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. Whenever anything has ever been on a decent track it goes haywire. I used to think it was just me trying to take care of my parents, and never actually trying for me. But damn it I finally start moving for me and everything falls out again; with no one's fault but my own. It just hurts so much and the fact I got a taste of my life back is just the biggest gut punch ever. Sorry for the rambling ",3,1751899379.0,Epilepsy,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone, just like countless other people I have also gone down this rabbit hole. I’m looking to purchase my first espresso machine.   I’m currently considering either the Ninja luxe cafe premier or the bambino plus + Df54 grinder.

Now some much needed context:

1. I’m not a coffee/espresso snob at all, by all means, I think i don’t even know what good coffee is. I mostly enjoy drinking iced lattes from local coffee shops. And that’s probably what i’m going to be using the machine to make, some hot lattes here and there in winter.

2. The whole idea of crafting a quality espresso seems really cool and interesting but in reality I’m not looking for a new hobby. what i’m looking for is making really good drinks at home. And even if i was getting into the hobby, i don’t think the rest of my family would be too keen on the learning curve.

3. I’m always looking to get the best value /
great deal and was looking to capitalize on prime day deals. Currently Ninja luxe is already on early prime day sale for $510 ($90 off) plus a $50 amazon credit. i’m not sure if bambino plus will be on a great deal starting tomorrow but this is the current market.

I’m concerned about making a bad purchase for myself that i will regret in 6 months. please advice about these models or a better alternative. Thanks!",3,1751899318.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

1ltvto1,https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualagency/comments/1ltvto1/stick_to_the_basics_building_a_successful/,Stick to the Basics: Building a Successful Insurance Business,"Being an insurance agent means helping people protect what’s important to them, like their homes, cars, or even their families. It’s a big job, but it’s also super rewarding! In this article, we’ll share some simple tips to help you build a successful insurance business. These tips are all about meeting people, staying positive, using your time and money wisely, and sticking to what works. Let’s dive in!

**Focus on Meeting People**

The key to being a great insurance agent is all about *people, people, people*! That means talking to lots of people every day to find those who need your help. Here are some ways to meet more people and grow your business:

* **Find New People to Talk To**: You can buy *leads*, which are lists of people who might be interested in insurance. Think of it like getting a map to find new friends who need your help!
* **Ask Happy Customers for Help**: When you help someone with their insurance, they might know other people who need insurance too. Ask them to tell their friends and family about you. This is called a *referral*.
* **Set a Goal for Talking to People**: Try to talk to a certain number of people every day. For example, you could decide to call or meet 5 people each day. This keeps you busy and helps you find new customers.
* **Join Community Events**: Go to local events, like fairs or school activities, to meet people in your area. Hand out business cards or just chat with folks about what you do.

**Stay Positive with a Strong Mindset**

Being an insurance agent isn’t always easy, but having the right attitude can make a huge difference. A *mindset* is how you think about things, and a positive mindset can help you keep going even when things get tough. Here’s how to stay positive:

* **Don’t Let “No” Stop You**: Sometimes, people will say they don’t want insurance. That’s okay! Think of each “no” as getting you one step closer to someone who says “yes.” It’s like playing a game where every try gets you closer to winning.
* **See Problems as Chances to Learn**: If something goes wrong, like losing a customer, don’t get upset. Instead, think about what you can learn from it to do better next time.
* **Picture Your Success**: Every morning, take a moment to imagine yourself doing great things, like helping lots of customers or growing your business. This can help you stay excited and focused.
* **Learn New Things**: Keep learning about insurance and how to help people better. You can read books, watch videos, or talk to other agents to get new ideas.

**Use Your Time and Money Smartly**

As an insurance agent, your time and money are super important. You need to use them in the best way to grow your business. Here’s how:

* **Spend Money on Good Leads**: Instead of calling random people, spend a little money on leads that are more likely to turn into customers. It’s like choosing to fish in a pond full of fish instead of an empty one!
* **Focus on What Matters**: Spend most of your time on things that help you find customers or make sales, like calling people or meeting them. If you have tasks like paperwork, maybe ask someone else to help with those.
* **Plan Your Day**: Make a schedule for your day. For example, you could spend the morning calling leads, the afternoon meeting customers, and the evening learning something new.
* **Save Time with Tools**: Use tools like apps or calendars to stay organized. This helps you spend more time helping people instead of figuring out what to do next.

**Stick to What Works**

Some people think luck is the key to success, but it’s really about doing the right things over and over again. Here’s how to keep doing what works:

* **Use Plans That Work**: Stick to ideas and strategies that have helped other insurance agents succeed. For example, if calling leads works better than sending emails, keep doing that!
* **Make a Routine**: Create a daily plan, like calling 5 people, checking emails, and following up with customers. Doing the same things every day helps you get better and better.
* **Don’t Chase New Fads**: Sometimes, you’ll hear about a shiny new idea, like a fancy way to advertise. Be careful! Make sure it’s worth your time before you try it.
* **Track Your Progress**: Keep a notebook or use an app to write down what you do each day and how it works. This helps you see what’s helping you grow.

**Things to Do This Week**

Ready to start building your awesome insurance business? Here are some things you can do this week:

1. **Check Your Lead Plan**: Look at how you’re finding new people to talk to. Are you using leads and referrals? Maybe try a new way to find customers, like joining a local group.
2. **Think About Your Attitude**: Take a moment to think about how you’re feeling. Are you worried about failing? Try to focus on the positive, like how you’re helping people.
3. **Meet New People**: Set a goal to talk to at least 3 new people this week. It could be at a coffee shop, a community event, or even online!
4. **Look Back at Your Day**: At the end of each day, think about what went well and what you could do better. Write it down to help you improve.

Becoming a successful insurance agent is all about helping people, staying positive, using your time and money wisely, and sticking to what works. It’s like building a strong house—one step at a time, with a solid plan. Keep talking to people, stay excited, and don’t give up. You’ve got this! Let’s start building your amazing insurance business today!

Help a man out

So there is this club I love going to. So one time I'm there drunk at around 2am I Katia this waitress na akaingia box hapo. At that point I was not huko ndani but kwa lounge ya entrance ambayo ni smoking zone. So after a while I see another waitress sitted there and I went over and asked her about the waiterress nmekatia and her character. Let's give them hypothetical names. The first I katiad let's call her Cyndy and the one I asked about Cyndy's character let's call her Joy.

Fast forward nilienda home around 6 nkazima kuamka nkapata Joy has texted me. How she got my number I don't know. So I drink daily hio mtaa and I went back the following day had some good time with Cyndy but there was just sth about Joy. See Cyndy is 28. God knows I love my women above 27 actually. Joy is 22. She's so cute and beautiful and so adorable.

At some point nilijipata nmekaa section ya Joy which isn't busy as other sections so we had a very long chat. I asked to hold her hand and boy I have never felt like the way I felt on that day before. I openly told her I fucked up. She wanted to know how but I didn't say nothing much.
I guess women can tell signs because from that point Cyndy approached Joy and said I was her man. God knows this story upto this point is longer than the Convo we've had with Cyndy.

So again I go home and invite Joy for a date. She paid her own cab fare btw. Akaja we met had some coffee and then went to another club(her off day) it was one of my best dates and club date. We talked a lot. After kitu saa saba hivi I took her straight home. She told me she won't sleep until I get home safely first and she did just that.

Let me save you the strain, Cyndy f'd up. I don't like a lady asking me for money and she's been on it. P.I.M.P lyrics by 50 cent you know the line. To be fair I prefer giving a lady money myself rather than being asked for it especially before we even go on a first date 

So I've been going to that club and Joy has a twin too. They are identical twins and she introduced me to her. Cyndy on the other hand has become cold and distant and has been intimidating Joy.

Joy at some point concluded that I'm kinda afraid of Cyndy because at some point I shouted I'm only escorting her for a few metres nirudi niendelee kulewa and she got mad. We haven't spoken ever since except for a few words. Truth is she said she can't snatch me from Cyndy but we been hanging out and talking and holding hands. She even bought me a shirt just to my liking because I identify with certain shirts...( White long sleeves shirt) I was so happy manze the fact that she noticed I like that mode of dressing.

I'm I trippin or she's into me. Najua nmekata so many things but y'all get the idea. Infact we had agreed on another date on Wednesday. Help a man out with some advice. I really like her. I never thought I'd consider dating a 22 yr old but she's respectful,very hard working,soft spoken and above all beautiful.( One day she went to the salon for human hair hairstyle I told her I like her forest hairstyle which was black so she got a brown forest hairstyle and said she won't change it because I like it) I think I'm trippin'😅😅.

-Nice property/pool. Grounds are lovely. Pool area is nice and large.
-Feels more like an event space than a five star hotel. While we were there half the rooms were booked for a family event (80th bday party) and it felt like we were crashing someone else’s event. Can’t imagine how bad it would be for a wedding. This alone would make never want to go back unless I knew there wasn’t an event.
-Food is hit or miss at both restaurants. When it’s bad—it’s really bad. Fish was good but everything else we ordered was terrible. Burgers and chicken were just awful. On the plus side I lost 2 pounds! 
-Most of the staff looks like they’re 18-20 and don’t seem to have any experience. I asked someone if they could refill the coffee in the lobby that was empty and they told me that they take it away between 9-10am—it was 9:05am—but I  could order coffee from the restaurant.
-They charge $50/day to valet your car. Just build it into the daily rate. 
-We’ve been to wildflower farms as well—found it to be much more relaxing and more like a true getaway.

• Mid-20s woman, mixed-race. We’re a five-person graduate-intake in a London office.  
• All of us started the same week. The other four are white guys and girls who seem to have nothing in common apart from the obvious, being white.  
• Looking back, all my close friends were people of colour, never white people, despite my best efforts to befriend everyone regardless of their background.

• Every Friday (and plenty of weeknights) they head to the pub, swap project intel and inside jokes. I only find out when Monday rolls around and I’m playing catch-up.  
• Same thing with lunches, “quick coffees,” even ad-hoc Teams calls – they loop each other in and “forget” me.

**Why it matters**

1. Because we’re the *entire* peer group, the pub chat is basically our informal training: who to ask for templates, which partner is hiring, hidden pitfalls, etc.
2. I’ve asked straight up: “Mind if I join next time?” Cue awkward “sure… if you like,” but no invite materialises.
3. I suggested neutral socials (coffee walk, lunchtime gym class). Polite nods, zero follow-through.
4. I’m logging project delays caused by missing those pub updates – looks bad on my KPIs.

**Complications** – Short-term contract, so going nuclear with HR could tank any conversion offer. – Not sure if this is unconscious bias, straight-up racism, or just lazy cliquey behaviour. What do I do about it anyway?

**The questions**  
• How do you tell when to escalate vs. shrug and build “vertical” allies instead?  
• Best one-liner to call out “accidental” exclusion without sounding needy or aggressive?

I went on holiday for a week and when I came back a couple of days ago, my best plant was absolutely covered in aphids!! The rest had a fair amount on them too, as they were being stored near each other, but I’m most upset about my big girl because she was growing so well/bushy :( 

Anyway, I took all of the plants into my bathroom and showered them down for a while until I couldnt see any more aphids, then I sprayed them with a mix of water and dish soap (1tsp soap and \~750ml water), left it for an hour or so and then re-showered them to wash off the soap mixture. I wouldn’t have left them for that long but I forgot so I hope it won’t damage the plants ?! 

I left them in the bathroom for about 24 hours but I do need to shower so I’ve had to remove them, they are now in front of the window in my bedroom so they can soak up some sun (unfortunately my bathroom gets virtually no sunlight). I have a fan pointed towards the window, and a buuuuunch of those sticky bug catchers (yellow shapes in pictures). 

I’m thinking of spraying them down each day, I have a phobia of bugs which I am working through but I just cannot touch them (for squishing/manual removal? I’ve seen people suggest this but I fear I would just be sick if I tried it), and I was also thinking of repeating the bathroom showering process every few days, until the aphids have fully gone - but I’m worried about eggs in the soil not getting washed away and instead being pushed further in?? Is that a concern I should be having?

I’ve also seen online that people suggest neem oil but I have cats so not sure how safe this is? I’ve also seen people suggesting to scatter used and dried coffee grounds over the top of the soil to smother and repel aphids? AGAIN not sure how much to trust this - I only drink instant coffee so I would have to ask my local cafe if they could give me their used coffee grounds? 

My cats are pretty chill and have never tried to eat the basil before but I don’t want to introduce anything that is toxic just in case they do have a little nibble! 

Does anyone have any advice on how I should change my approach to get rid of the aphids as well as what I can do to prevent this happening in the future?",1,1751898549.0,houseplants,3,1.0,False
1ltvle4,https://i.redd.it/3nqh5bhsogbf1.jpeg,Asian Plum SOTD 77/2025,"I had a great shave this morning trying Asian Plum by Ariana & Evans. I used my REX Konsul with a Kai blade on setting 3 and got one of my the closest shaves so far. I achieved this with a 2 pass shave with some minor cleanup along my jaw.

I had some minor irritation here and there with the alum block but nothing crazy. I splashed on Thayers, followed by the Asian Plum ASL, and finally Zingari Man unscented after shave serum.

I am a big fan of this Asian Plum. I originally got it as a sample and had a hard time deciding between this and Asian Pear. Ultimately I went with Plum because it seemed like it had more depth and had a darker note. The wife also helped with the decision. She really likes this one on me.



**The story behind Asian Plum from the A&E website:**

Asian Plum was originally made as a gift for testers of my tallow based, goats milk & lanolin soap. Anthony Esposito had suggested that we come up with a plum type scent for the guys and mentioned one of his favorites, a European soap which is extremely difficult to find...truly unobtanium. I took this as a challenge and embarked on this journey to create a soap, reminiscent of this great mysterious shaving soap. Another friend and fellow vip member sent a sample as a comparison. The rest is history!   I added many of the same notes found in the original, however, I wanted to put my own spin on this great scent. Once comfortable that I had something that would be a good rendition of the original, I sent along to the group. The response was terrific, so I made it available for you as well. In our k2e base.



**Scent Notes:** 

*Plum, dried fruits, tobacco, tonka bean, coffee, vanilla and a touch of Plumeria.*



**Products Used:**

* Razor: REX Konsul
* Blade: Kai (2nd use)
* Brush: RazoRock Chrome Silvertip Plissoft Synthetic
* Bowl: Maggard Ceramic
* Pre-shave: Wholly Kaw- Green Tea Pre-shave Treatment
* Shave Soap: Ariana & Evans- Asian Plum
* Alum Block: Osma
* Splash: Thayers Unscented
* Alcohol Aftershave: Ariana & Evans- Asian Plum
* Aftershave Serum: Zingari Man- Unscented After Shave Serum

1ltvjm3,https://i.redd.it/g72zmn27pgbf1.jpeg,Are we (38m) & (32f) the assholes or is this a delusional Ex?,"Little back story to this.

Ever since my (32) bf (38) and the ex separated, it's been nothing but a nightmare. They have a child agreement in place, to which she does her best to not follow.

Most recently, the problems she's been causing include her approaching us, including my son, after numerous emails of requesting that she respect our space (and her agreeing); 'forgetting' to drop off stuff at my bf's house so he goes to her house because she is 'running errands' (she is someone who lives by schedules and she is trying to just inconvenience him); due to the previous toxic environment between my bf and the ex, drop off's/pick up's were agreed to be done at daycare...again, to which she agreed, through email, but has yet to do this. She just has any and every excuse why it's 'better for the kids' to be dropped/picked up at her house.

This email comes after my boyfriend advised her of us moving in together. Gave her the date, and the address.
This kind of email received, isn't the first time either...When she learned that her ex-husband (my bf) has moved on, she immediately asked to have a background criminal check, and 2 references about me, along with a photo, my age, and what I do for work..
 
From this email...this is just my thoughts/views on how I perceive this:
- she is losing control, to which she always needs to have; do what is good for her (and claims kids, uses them as a weapon/excuse).
- uses her being a teacher as a justification for her asking, knowing and caring more.
- when she mentions that if roles were reversed, it would be the same..(implying she knows my bf would want this, to which my bf said is NOT the case).
- I just find it weird she wants to meet, sit for 30-1hr with me (and bf if I want) but NOT talk about personal life...so what is i  for? The weather?
- This entire email I see as a slap to my boyfriend's decision-making as a parent. It's as if his opinion on who he brings around his kids is not enough and needs her approval.
- She states how she respects my sons decision on interacting, yet she has numerous times in the last few months, said the same yet continues to do the opposite.

This woman has done nothing but make promises through emails, time and time again, and does everything to not act on them. She has intentionally done the opposite, she wants things to be on HER terms and if she has no say, she starts doing these types of emails.

The main reason for their divorce is that she was controlling, he had no say in the upbringing of their kids, he had to go through her on everything related to the kids, and his decision/ choice is never ok unless she has a say in it at the end.

Ex. He took the kids for a walk, with the stroller a few years back, early in the morning without her because she was asleep, and she called screaming and crying how it wasn't ok to do that, and that she expects him to go home asap.

As much as I don’t like this woman (not just through his word of mouth, but emails and phone calls I have been present for), I refuse to talk negatively about her to, or around, the kids. There are photos that show up on our TV, of her and the kids (memories); when the kids mention their mom and their dog, I interact. If they say they miss mom, I have offered to help them do some drawings (bracelets, etc.) with them for her. That is their mother and I will never push them against her. I have also spoken with my BF that I do not want the kids calling me mom as that is a special role just for her. I am a mom myself and I wouldn’t want to make the kids feel like they can’t talk freely to us about her.
But I have to put boundaries in place for myself, my bf, and my son.

This email to us came as a bit of a chuckle. The fact she would even think of asking any of this is ridiculous. We just want to see other peoples opinions/ views…or even comments about how delusional this person is.

We aren’t shit-talking her, just reviewing the email, but with all the crap she put us through, we really want to throw this one up on here.


TLDR: Bf's ex sent email wanting to meet. From previous situations, we find her delusional requesting it.

First, they quietly removed a shot from certain drinks, renamed them, and then charged extra just to get back to the original recipe.

Then they started charging for heavy cream...something that was always free before.

Now, despite the CEO promising multiple times on news outlets that there would be no price increases this year, they’ve started charging for the sugar-free vanilla syrup too.

Honestly, I’m glad my bank membership now includes unlimited free coffee. No price hikes, no hidden fees—just straightforward free coffee (and yes, free pens too!).

Maybe it’s time we all reconsider where our coffee dollars go. Banks giving out coffee might just be Starbucks’ unexpected competitor.

I live between München and Starnberg and would love to meet someone nearby who’s ready for something real. Life feels more meaningful when it's shared with the right person. And, that’s what I’m hoping to find.

I’m tall (187 cm), with dark hair and blue eyes. I’ve got a strong build with a bit of softness in the middle. I’m also on the hairier side, just being honest right from the start. :)

I enjoy the simple things: quiet walks in nature, slow mornings, good food, and spending time with people who make me feel at ease. I speak English, German, and Turkish. I’m into anime, manga, and board games. So yes, you could say that I’m a bit nerdy.

What matters most to me is connection, both emotional and physical. I usually feel that spark more with women who are naturally slim, fit, or have an average build. That’s just me being honest about what I’m drawn to, not trying to be selective.

There’s one thing I want to be upfront about: I’d love to have a child of my own one day. I know that’s a big thing to share early, but I think it’s important to speak from the heart.

I’m not looking for endless texting or something long-distance. I’d much rather meet in person, have a coffee or tea, take a walk, and see how we vibe.

There’s a photo on my profile if you'd like to put a face to the words. And if something here speaks to you, I’d genuinely love to hear from you. :)",1,1751898071.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1ltvf92,https://www.reddit.com/r/mustloveducks/comments/1ltvf92/the_tenant_in_4b/,The Tenant in 4B,"Elena first noticed him on a Tuesday evening in October, when the radiator clanged three times and the kitchen faucet turned itself on. She'd been living in apartment 4B for exactly two weeks, and the building's quirks were still revealing themselves like shy animals emerging from hiding.

""Old pipes,"" she muttered, turning off the tap. But when she looked up, she saw him reflected in the window above the sink—a man in his thirties with kind eyes and rolled-up sleeves, standing just behind her left shoulder.

She spun around. Empty kitchen. Her heart hammered against her ribs.

When she looked back at the window, only her own pale face stared back.

The next morning, Elena called the super about the plumbing. Mrs. Chen from downstairs knocked on her door that afternoon, wearing a concerned expression and carrying a plate of dumplings.

""The apartment,"" Mrs. Chen said carefully, ""has been empty for three years. The last tenant, he was a good man. Thomas. He worked at the bookstore on Maple Street."" She paused. ""Heart attack. Very sudden. Very sad.""

Elena accepted the dumplings and thanked her, but Mrs. Chen lingered in the doorway.

""Sometimes,"" she said, ""places remember people. Especially when they were happy there.""

That night, Elena dreamed of someone making coffee in her kitchen before dawn, humming something she almost recognized. She woke to the smell of Colombian roast and found a full pot waiting for her, still warm.

Over the following weeks, Thomas—she'd started thinking of him by name—became part of her routine. He'd turn on the radio to her favorite station while she got ready for work. He'd leave books open to beautiful passages on her nightstand. Once, during a particularly brutal day at the law firm, she came home to find her apartment filled with the scent of garlic and herbs, and a pot of something that tasted like her grandmother's soup simmering on the stove.

She began talking to him while she cooked dinner, telling him about her day, about the cases she was working on, about how she'd moved to the city to start fresh after her divorce. Sometimes she felt him listening—a presence like warmth against her back while she chopped vegetables or folded laundry.

""You're a good listener,"" she'd say to the empty room, and she could swear she heard him laugh.

The first time she saw him clearly, she was reading in bed on a rainy Sunday afternoon. She looked up from her book and there he was, sitting in the armchair by the window, reading his own book with complete absorption. Afternoon light streamed through him like he was made of honey and shadow.

He looked up and smiled, and Elena's breath caught. He was beautiful in an understated way—the kind of man who would remember your coffee order and bring you soup when you were sick and notice when you'd had your hair cut.

""Hi,"" she whispered.

""Hi,"" he whispered back, and his voice was exactly what she'd imagined—warm and careful and tinged with wonder.

They began spending evenings together. He'd sit in his chair while she curled up on the couch, and they'd read in comfortable silence or talk about books, about the city, about the way light fell across the apartment at different times of day. Thomas told her about his work at the bookstore, about the regulars who'd become like family, about the poetry readings he'd hosted in the back room.

""I loved that place,"" he said one evening, his form flickering like a candle flame. ""I loved this apartment. I loved the life I was building.""

Elena reached toward him instinctively, then pulled her hand back when her fingers met only cool air.

""I'm sorry,"" she said. ""About what happened to you.""

Thomas was quiet for a long moment. ""I'm not,"" he said finally. ""Not anymore. Being here with you... it's like getting to live the life I always wanted. The one I didn't get to finish.""

Elena's heart squeezed. She'd been thinking the same thing—that somehow, impossibly, she'd found the person she'd been looking for all along, someone who understood her need for quiet evenings and strong coffee and books everywhere. Someone who saw her coming home tired and thought to make her soup.

But as autumn deepened into winter, she noticed Thomas growing fainter. Some evenings she could barely see him, just a suggestion of movement in her peripheral vision. The coffee stopped appearing. The radio stayed silent.

""You're leaving,"" she said one night in December, when he was so translucent she could see the wall through his chest.

""I don't want to,"" he said, and his voice sounded like it was coming from very far away. ""But I can't stay. It's not... it's not fair to either of us.""

Elena's eyes filled with tears. ""Why not?""

""Because you're alive,"" he said simply. ""And you deserve a life with someone who can give you everything. Someone who can hold your hand and make you coffee and grow old with you.""

She wanted to argue, to tell him that what they had was enough, that she'd rather have his ghost than anyone else's flesh and blood. But even as she formed the words, she knew he was right.

""I love you,"" she said instead.

""I love you too,"" he replied. ""That's why I have to go.""

On New Year's Eve, Thomas appeared one last time, solid and warm and real-looking enough that Elena almost believed she could touch him. He stood by the window, looking out at the city lights and the fireworks blooming in the distance.

""Will you do something for me?"" he asked.

Elena nodded, not trusting her voice.

""Live,"" he said. ""Really live. Go to parties and make mistakes and fall in love with someone who can love you back the way you deserve. Don't spend your life waiting for ghosts.""

She was crying now, tears streaming down her face. ""I don't know how to let you go.""

Thomas turned from the window and smiled at her with infinite tenderness. ""You don't have to let me go. Just... let me rest. Let yourself be happy.""

He walked toward her—or seemed to—and for a moment Elena felt warmth brush against her cheek, like a kiss or a blessing.

""Thank you,"" he whispered. ""For letting me love you. For letting me be loved.""

When midnight struck and the city exploded in celebration, Elena was alone in her apartment. But she didn't feel alone. She felt like she'd been given a gift—not just Thomas's love, but the knowledge that she was capable of loving like that, deeply and without reservation.

She felt ready to try again.

Spring came early that year. Elena joined a book club at the library and started taking pottery classes on weekends. She learned to make coffee that was almost as good as Thomas's, and she kept plants on the windowsill where he used to sit and read.

Sometimes, when she was cooking dinner or getting ready for a date, she'd feel a gentle presence in the apartment—not Thomas exactly, but something like approval, like love, like blessing. The apartment held onto happiness the way some places hold onto sorrow, and Elena was grateful to be part of that story.

She never saw Thomas again, but she carried him with her: in her appreciation for quiet Sunday afternoons, in her kindness to bookstore employees, in her willingness to believe in love that transcends the ordinary rules of the world.

And when she finally met David at the pottery class, when she felt that spark of recognition and possibility, she knew Thomas would have been happy for her. Some loves are meant to teach us how to love. Some are meant to last forever.

1ltvbh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticWithADHD/comments/1ltvbh2/failed_to_get_prescribed_now_going_solo/,"Failed to get prescribed, now going solo","For years I have been struggling with chronic fatigue due to overstimulation and executive dysfunction. I know that it is directly related because it didn't matter how well I slept at night, often I would need to take an hour or two hour nap BEFORE I was able to get started on tasks I knew I needed to do that day(work tasks, phone calls). Or in recent years, after going out grocery shopping with my girlfriend for just 4 hours(and maybe a book shop and some dinner/lunch) I'd need to come home and pass out for an hour or two. 

The ending of May I went to see a psychiatrist and a therapist to hopefully get back on stimulant medications. They worked for me for years in high school and I wanted to solve the chronic fatigue issues and my executive dysfunction is once and for all. Well, my psychiatrist ended up prescribing Lexapro to me(which did not help my fatigue AT ALL) and after 3 weeks on it, denied me a prescription for Vyvanse because I had marijuana in my system(my girlfriend smokes but I don't). 

I knew it was already going to be hard enough the constant battle to justify to Medi-Cal that I still need ADHD meds every few months and already it was starting right at the beginning, despite marijuana being legal in California. So I decided to drop the Lexapro and the docs and investigate nootropics and supplements instead. For years I have been medicating with caffeine(energy drinks and coffee) with mixed results(sometimes it puts me to sleep still). But recently I tried yerba mate and had much better reaction to that so I decided there must be some other natural remedies I haven't looked into.

For the past 2 weeks I have been experimenting with different stacks and combos and so far it has been really positive! I have not only beat back my fatigue quite a bit but I also have unlocked motivation and hyper focus states. There was a small adjustment on the holiday this past week/long weekend where I should have been more able to task switch and be more social, yet the dopamine fueled supplements I was trying and the stimulation supplements very much made me feel like being alone to focus on my tasks. But I also have some sedation and serotonin supplements like L-Theanine and Bacopa that help soften those edges. 

I just wanted to share the ones that worked for me and encourage you to do your own research on when these work best(what time of day to take them and with or without food and what tasks to take them for so that you are informed personally about them; also I encourage you to do your own research about how these interact with any medications you may be taking so that there isn't any bad reactions). 

In morning I take L-Tyrosine, Maca Root, Acetyl-L-Carntine (ALCAR), L-Theanine, then Omega-3, CoQ10, B-complex (with ALL the Bs and vitamin C). In afternoon I take NAC and Rhodiola Rosea. At night I take Bacopa and L-Theanine with a small dose of melatonin. 

This week I am going to be trying out phenylalanine and panax Ginseng instead of L-Tyrosine and Rhodiola to see if there is a difference in how my body handles it. ",4,1751897789.0,AutisticWithADHD,4,0.84,False
