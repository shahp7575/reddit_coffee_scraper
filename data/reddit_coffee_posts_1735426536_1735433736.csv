Things like better sleep, more flexibility, better digestion. My episodes of brain fog are fewer and farther between.  I've even lost weight. The first 3 months it felt like my body and mind with literally attacking me the entire day. I've had so many symptoms, too many to name here now. All that's left is this tension headache and some stiffness across my upper back, neck and  around my scalp. At the base of my skull I can feel my veins pumping across my head in the same rhythm as my heart beat. It feels like my scalp is squeezing itself.  My life as been effectively paused  because of this, I can't have a sustained study sessions like I used to and nothing pain reliever wise seems to work.

There‚Äôs something incredibly satisfying about the whole process: measuring out the beautiful off-brown beans on my $259 Bluetooth/wifi atomic scale, moistening them with designer water from my $26 artisanal herbal supplement ~~spray bottle~~ Ross Droplet Dispenser, grinding them by hand, forcing my tight grip into a wild rhythmic gyrating motion, blindly shaking them. The hypnotic counterclockwise RDT as I gently stab my shiny silver pricks inside. A little *tap tap tap* on my marble counter, I let out a small groan as I plunge my $180 carbon fiber tamper (ribbed for your pleasure) into the grounds with some effort, waiting for the boiler to hit that perfect temperature. I place my $65 aluminum puck screen above my now very firm, carefully curated grounds, and insert my portafilter into the head.

I watch for exactly 36.7 seconds as the brown-gold rivulets gently caress my $59.99 frozen titanium ball, the supple crema enveloping it slowly.

Been drinking coffee for a couple years now, but haven't really found something that goes well with milk. While I appreciate black coffee and want to have more of it, my comfort zone remains a cup of hot (and on summer days, chilled) milk coffee.

Hi everyone, this is my first time traveling on this train, and no one I know has done it before, so I need as much help as I can to understand how everything works. It‚Äôs also my first time traveling alone, and I tend to get overwhelmed and anxious easily if I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing. I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice you can share!

General Questions (For Both Day and Night Rides):

	‚Ä¢	I booked the 5:00 AM XPT train from Brisbane to Sydney, but I made the booking while in the Gold Coast (for reference, in case it matters with the times displaying in different time zones). Is this 5:00 AM departure time in Brisbane time or Sydney time?
	‚Ä¢	For my return journey, I‚Äôm leaving from Wyong at 4:15 PM a few days later, but I also booked this trip while in the Gold Coast. Since I‚Äôm still in the Gold Coast, will the 4:15 PM time be in Brisbane time or Sydney time? When I get to Wyong, will the time automatically adjust, or do I need to convert the time difference myself?
	‚Ä¢	I booked on the NSW TrainLink site while in the Gold Coast. Will this make any difference to the time zone shown for my departure? For example, if it says 5:00 AM, does that mean 5:00 AM in NSW time?
	‚Ä¢	How early do I need to check in my bag before the train leaves?
	‚Ä¢	Once I check in my bag, what happens to it? Do I store it myself in a compartment, or does a staff member handle it?

Day Travel Questions:
	‚Ä¢	What are some good things to do during the 
day ride to pass the time? (e.g., activities, entertainment, or sightseeing through the windows)
	‚Ä¢	Is the food on the train worth buying, or should I bring my own snacks or meals?
	‚Ä¢	Is coffee available on the train? If so:
	‚Ä¢	Is it any good?
	‚Ä¢	How strong is it? (I‚Äôm on a stimulant, so I can handle medium strength but not high strength.)
	‚Ä¢	Is it made using a machine or a plunger?
	‚Ä¢	Are there any good stops or breaks along the way where I can get off and grab food?

Night Travel Questions:
	‚Ä¢	What‚Äôs the best way to stay comfortable during a night trip? (e.g., bringing a pillow, blanket, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Are the seats comfortable enough to sleep in, or should I bring extra items to make it more comfortable?
	‚Ä¢	Are there any tips to ensure I get a good rest during the ride?

Right before she started talking to her again They moved from California to Tennessee. They where allow to see the kids my father in law is nice MIL is a narcissist. Unfortunately they come out stay in my house because my wife's brother wife said no I've said no allot and somehow they are still here. Anyone she's been a bit mean to me for allot reason apparently I'm lazy and mean keep this in mind. So over summer I was told by my wife they wanted us to spend 6 days with them during the holiday I said that's my limit but ok. By October they decided to pay for everything and it was 10 days cheaper flight they paid for a hotel (wilderness at the smokies) told us they'd pay for food too and told us this was our Christmas present totally fine with this. Ok gets closer to the fly out date I'm getting the do I have to go and got the you can stay home but you'll have to repay them for the flight fine. Day before we leave I get the hey btw we are sharing a room with my brother his wife and his kids fine I'll deal with it. 1st day in pigeon forge dinner at pizza place my wife offers to pay MIL says no brother in law says if we guess the total can we pay so he guess my wife guess I'm exhausted from travel and jet lag so I'm just zoning. Mil well we all know Echo(me) is cheap and won't offer!...I looked over wanted to scream was told not to make a scene. Day 2 Dollywood tried to pay for snacks got yelled at that I was told not to it's not my trip (so last night was free shot I guess) fine go to dinner my brother in law demands the check before it's delivered she has a holy hell fit at her then makes a comment that I'd never pay(sorry the free transportation to the airport from my house and bed and breakfast is just a service I provide) back to the room between my brother in law and his wife dueling snoring I couldn't sleep. I roller over groan wife ask why I'm upset I unload on her didn't want to go didn't want to be here and I got the she's always been this way you could stay home behave. So next day I try to pay for coffee she took my card threw it and told me it's not about me clearly. We are in Gatlinburg my work called I spent 20 mins fixing stuff she tells me I need to not work on vacation ( I wanted to say I'd rather deal with horrible project managers then this). So fine we go to dinner my wife wants me to try and pay I tell her I'd rather sit on a pinecone then try that. We leave my daugher (10 years)  left my MIL scarf behind I ran to get it it's gone. She has a meltdown gives my daughter the silent treatment I told her I'd replace it and it's fine she snapped it's from Ireland I say sorry was a mistake. So to make up I get her a bag she wanted and tell my daughter to give it to her and apologize politely. She accepts the tells my 10 year old to pay more attention. I shot the look of really wife said let it go. Fine next day I'm at the indoor water park I'm getting drunk because I'm kinda done with the snide comments. Wife isnt happy I'm smiling and trying to ignore everything she also hates water parks fine. Dinner was a why we hate all liberals and how California schools are turning kids gay and trans. next day at Dollywood didn't feel like riding a coaster so wife and I are talking to MIL. I said something about how I had to apologize MIL said you apologize that's a joke right( yea that was a joke apparently).

Today I wore shoes inside that was pleasant she then say we need to go to Costco get stuff for dinner I offer to go to help carry things she said it's a girl trip I said meh I'll maybe I'll grow vagina be more sensitive. She then says I must have a vagina because I do all the cooking cleaning and laundry and I should just grow a pair and make my wife help so that was nice.

1hojsut,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hojsut/reeves_day/,Reeve's Day,"The woman who piloted the ship was in her mid-thirties, close to two meters tall, with broad, strong features, jet hair, deep brown eyes, and warm, golden-brown skin. Despite being human, the ship she piloted was of a sort no other human had ever seen. Sleek, with no visible seams or joins, no hint of door or portal, it tore its way across light years through an artificial wormhole.

#

The woman who watched the customers coming and going from the cafe was fifty-four, 149 centimeters tall, with soft features in a pale, ivory face. Salt and pepper curls were carefully styled above pale, blue eyes. The plate in front of her sat half-finished, while she nursed her coffee. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bullshit, you know,‚Äù she said.

The young waiter raised the coffee pot in question and his eyebrows in surprise. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou asked how Reeve‚Äôs Day was going for me. I just said it‚Äôs bullshit.‚Äù She moved her coffee cup over to hint at a refill. ‚ÄúInstead of celebrating Howard Reeve‚Äôs birthday, we should be celebrating ‚ÄòKahananui Day‚Äô instead.‚Äù

He refilled her cup, no room for cream or sugar as she‚Äôd indicated on his first round. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù

‚ÄúPatricia Kahananui. She‚Äôs the technician that picked up the signal and convinced Captain Reeve to investigate.‚Äù She took the refilled cup and wrapped her hands around it as if to warm them. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really too sad nobody remembers her sacrifice.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid she ‚Äî I mean, um ‚Äî what happened to her?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe readied a relativistic probe to send toward the signal. Not that anyone on the ship would live long enough to see what the response would be, but they were going to send it anyway.‚Äù She took a sip of her coffee.

‚ÄúThen what happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe official story is that she climbed into the probe to make some sort of adjustment, and there was a communications error. Whether that‚Äôs true or not, she was in the probe when it launched at a steady three gees acceleration for the next year according to the probe‚Äôs time, with another year of three gee reverse acceleration. And a theoretical maximum of twenty hours oxygen on board.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù The waiter seemed at a loss for words, mumbled an apology and moved on.

The alien ship exited the wormhole that closed behind it. One second there was nothing there, then a bright flash and a strange ship in low Earth orbit. The pilot waved her hand and lights on the smooth console shifted and flashed. She piloted this ship with subtle gestures, landing in the grassy patch behind a cafe. The ship set down amidst wildflowers and gawking stares of passersby.

#

The pilot exited a door that seemed to materialize from the smooth side of the ship. She walked into the cafe and looked at the crowd. There were a few stools at the bar, but all the tables were occupied, one by only one woman. She made a beeline for that table, and asked the woman there, ‚ÄúMay I sit here?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure. You look familiar.‚Äù

The pilot sat. ‚ÄúI do?‚Äù

The woman across the table from her nodded. ‚ÄúYou from around here?‚Äù

The pilot smirked. ‚ÄúYeah, but ‚Äî that was a long time ago.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù the woman said, setting down her coffee and extending a hand to shake. ‚ÄúMyra Jenkins.‚Äù

The pilot shook Myra‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúPleasure to meet you, Myra. Pat Kahananui.‚Äù

Myra laughed. ‚ÄúRight, right. Did the waiter put you up to this?‚Äù

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù

Just then, the waiter came back to the table. ‚ÄúWould you like to order, ma‚Äôam?‚Äù he asked Pat.

‚ÄúThree eggs, over easy, steak, rare, whole-wheat toast with lots of butter, and a pot of coffee, please,‚Äù she answered.

Myra eyed the pilot with suspicion until the waiter had poured her coffee and left. ‚ÄúReally, what‚Äôs your name?‚Äù

‚ÄúPat Kahananui. Patricia, actually, but I don‚Äôt go by that.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou were named after the technician?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I was named after my mother‚Äôs neighbor, but I am ‚Äî or _was_ ‚Äî a technician on a research vessel.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich one?‚Äù

‚ÄúUHS Aurum.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhile I appreciate the attempt at humor, Reeve‚Äôs Day pisses me off enough. Seriously, now who‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúReeve‚Äôs Day? What‚Äôs that?‚Äù

‚ÄúBirthday of Captain Howard Reeve,‚Äù Myra said with a sneer.

‚ÄúWhy does he get a day?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy thoughts exactly.‚Äù Myra raised her coffee cup in salute and took another sip.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious. Wait, what year is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat year? It‚Äôs 572.‚Äù

‚ÄúShit,‚Äù Pat muttered. ‚ÄúSorry, sorry. I didn‚Äôt consider the relativistic effects of my little joy ride.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour what?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been long enough that it should all be declassified by now. Alien signals from hundreds of light-years away, then signals from far closer. I picked up on them, then convinced Howie to send a probe. He didn‚Äôt know I aimed it at the closer signal and packed enough oxygen and CO2 scrubbers to last me for a few days. I snuck in with the hope that the aliens would pick me up, and they did.‚Äù She stopped briefly, as the waiter delivered her heaping plate of food. ‚ÄúOf course, he wouldn‚Äôt know about that part.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe un-redacted story was the same as the official one. You crawled in to make an adjustment at the last minute, and there was a communications error that was undetected until after you‚Äôd launched. It was classified as an accident.‚Äù

‚ÄúHuh,‚Äù Pat said. ‚ÄúI guess Howie didn‚Äôt want that on his record. I left him a note and told him he could declare me insane if he wanted.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, well, the official story is always just that. Anyway, relativistic effects would account for why you look so good for a hundred and seventeen, but if your story is true, how did you get back?‚Äù

Pat removed a disk from her jumpsuit and placed it on the table. ‚ÄúSecurity view of the Arrow, please.‚Äù

A holographic image of the sleek ship parked behind the cafe filled the air between the women. The crowd around it took pictures and video, and at least two law enforcement officers were on-scene trying to maintain order.

‚ÄúYou‚Äîyou‚Äôre really _her_!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm, uh, just me,‚Äù Pat said around a mouthful of steak and eggs. ‚ÄúGod, I missed this so much.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, how come it took so long? Was it tens of light-years away?‚Äù Myra asked.

‚ÄúOh, no. The relativistic effects were entirely from the probe, and the fact that I aimed for the signal, which had been deflected around a black hole. When the aliens finally picked me up after three days, I don‚Äôt know how long that had been.‚Äù

Pat sipped at the coffee, savoring it with a soft hum. ‚ÄúI spent about ten years on their planet ‚Äî learned their language, their version of calculus, and the physics of artificial worm-hole generation, and spent the last year building the Arrow ‚Äî then took off for home three hours ago and got here just before I walked in. So, rough guess, I spent eighty-seven years your time around that damned black hole.‚Äù

‚ÄúThree hours? So, they‚Äôre somewhere close?‚Äù Myra asked.

‚ÄúSix-hundred-five light years away, give or take.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn three hours?‚Äù

‚ÄúWormhole.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd no relativistic effects from travel in the wormhole?‚Äù

‚ÄúNegligible. About the same as the difference between being on Earth and being in orbit.‚Äù

Myra shifted in her seat, pushing her half-emptied plate to the end of the table. ‚ÄúYou brought back the physics of faster-than-light travel, and a working prototype? Now, maybe they‚Äôll listen and give you your own day.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt want it. But if today is Howie‚Äôs birthday, it‚Äôs the twenty-eighth of December?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, that was Saturday, but the holiday is always the Monday nearest. It‚Äôs the thirtieth.‚Äù

Pat ate three quarters of her meal before slowing down. ‚ÄúYou never answered me, though.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnswered what?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy did Howie get his own day?‚Äù

‚ÄúUsing the signal you picked up, he came up with a way to compress data for transmission. At first, it was just used for space exploration, but in time, it was applied to everything, everywhere. The one that gets trotted out the most is that stock trades happen in less than one percent of the time they used to take. Like gambling in nanoseconds is something to cheer.‚Äù

Pat looked at the small woman across from her. ‚ÄúWhat do you do?‚Äù

Myra sighed. ‚ÄúI teach middle school science. Not my first choice, but options for astrophysicists have been limited lately.‚Äù

A smile crossed Pat‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúWanna take a ride in my ship? We can swing by Jupiter for a bit, then we‚Äôll go set down at JPL and see if they have an opening.‚Äù She laid a hundred-year-old fifty-dollar bill on the table.

‚ÄúThat won‚Äôt work,‚Äù Myra said. She pulled out some North American Credits and laid them on the table. ‚ÄúI got your bill, in exchange for a ride.‚Äù

After I brewed my cup which was the third, it was all good.

Ever since I increased the dose, I‚Äôve been feeling constantly unwell. I have to force myself to eat, and I feel sick every single day. I noticed that the side effects got noticeably worse when I moved up to 1 mg, but when I was on 0.5 mg, I wasn‚Äôt losing any weight.

I‚Äôve been pushing through these symptoms because I don‚Äôt want to complain to my doctor‚Äîespecially since she was already hesitant to prescribe the medication in the first place. Right now, I‚Äôm managing to get in about 1,000 calories a day, but only by forcing myself to eat. On the rare occasion that I do feel hungry and eat more, I end up vomiting.

I‚Äôm feeling stuck and not sure what to do. I‚Äôm still about 35 pounds away from my goal, but these side effects are becoming really frustrating to manage. I‚Äôve always loved food‚Äîhonestly, that‚Äôs part of how I got to this point in the first place, lol. But now, I find zero interest or joy in food. Nothing sounds appealing anymore. Even on special occasions, I can‚Äôt bring myself to enjoy a single glass of wine. I‚Äôve recently developed an aversion to coffee, which used to be a staple for me. It‚Äôs like all the things I used to enjoy have completely lost their appeal, and I‚Äôm struggling to feel like myself. Any advice?

I've been to Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto once before and my itinerary is about the pace I enjoy. For example I've done Yokahama, Kamakura and Enoshima in a day at a quite leisurely pace for me. A few days are a bit packed but I like having a list of things to do and will simply skip if too rushed and I also kept a free day on January 8th if there's anything I didn't have time for in Tokyo.

I spent a few months researching places I want to see, put them in Google maps and tried to organize the days as best as possible. I mostly just like wandering around, looking at random shops and photography which I'll go out most nights for a couple hours to take photos and also check out some live music, I'll mostly just decide on the day where to take photos and maybe just jump on the train and get off somewhere randomly. I'm not into shrines too much, I'll probably just go to Enoshima Shrine (have been before but going at sunset this time) and smaller ones I happen to walk past.

1hoj9sd,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1hoj9sd/best_studying_practice_fixing_your_sleep_for_good/,Best Studying Practice: Fixing Your Sleep (For Good),"*Initially posted this somewhere else but since I'm a student, I figured the post would add the most value here.*

First to give you some back story about my sleep journey.

I‚Äôve struggled with falling asleep, staying asleep; waking up, having a good sleep schedule/rhythm. . the list goes on

This is really a terrible problem to have, if you can‚Äôt get a good night's rest before an important event, or enough to stay healthy it can really negatively impact your mood, productivity, focus, and even intelligence.

I used to be extremely guilty of not being a morning person, snapping on people I love because I just was so tired and irritable 24/7

I decided if I was going to live until 60 that I needed to get my sleep in check. I‚Äôm a very scientific person, so I dived deep into sleep research. It‚Äôs pretty amazing how far things have come even in the past 10 years

There‚Äôs still a lot about sleep that science can‚Äôt explain, so for the sake of being thorough I didn‚Äôt ignore wives tales, colloquialisms, or ‚Äúnon-scientific ‚Äú sleep aids in my research

The good news is we understand the falling asleep part very well. It's what happens while you're asleep part we don‚Äôt understand as deeply.

So in this post I'm going to summarize the current scientific understanding of the mechanisms in your body that cause you to fall asleep and then I'm gonna tell you¬†**how to hack these systems**¬†in your body to make falling asleep your superpower.

If you don‚Äôt care about the science I'll be breaking the post down like this so you can skip around

* **What is Adenosine (The Sleep Molecule)**
   * How Adenosine affects intelligence & personality
   * How Adenosine affects health¬†
   * What Caffeine does
* **Cortisol and Sleep**¬†
   * What does Cortisol do?
   * ¬†How to manage Cortisol

# What is Adenosine (The Sleep Molecule)

Adenosine is this crazy, misunderstood molecule. I call it the sleep molecule and it‚Äôs really the hero of our bodies but most of us hate it.

See Adenosine‚Äôs only job in the body is to make sure you get enough sleep, and it's very very good at making your life increasingly miserable until you do.

**How Adenosine affects health**¬†

So while most people think the effects of not enough sleep are grumpiness, sleepiness, memory loss. This is actually adenosine trying its best to protect you from the real effects of not getting enough sleep

* Type 2 diabetes¬†
* Colon cancer
* High blood pressure
* Dementia,
* Death. (Literally.)

¬†So who‚Äôs the bad guy again?

Down to its core, Adenosine is just a neurotransmitter in our nervous system that builds up the longer we stay awake

It binds to receptors and sends electrical signals through your nervous system telling it to start feeling sleepy. The miserable days¬† come when Adenosine levels rise early and often.¬† And it's almost always because you are fighting against Adenosine instead of working with it.

**What Caffeine does**

Our societal response to fighting the sense of sleepiness and tiredness is caffeine. Caffeine blocks Adenosine receptors like a car in someone‚Äôs parking spot‚Äìbut it can only hold the spot for so long.

When the caffeine wears off (4-6 hours on average), the parking spot is empty again. And all this Adenosine has just been waiting in the street ready to surge into the spots that caffeine was blocking just minutes before.

This Is The Crash‚Ä¶

But what's making all of this Adenosine?

It‚Äôs not just enough for us to understand what Adenosine does, if we want to live in unison with it, we need to know how it is made.

Adenosine comes from several processes in the body, but there's one commonality between them all.

They are all byproducts of releasing energy. Essentially you can think of it this way. Every time your body consumes ATP and expends energy, Adenosine is produced.

Now Adenosine flows through your brain, attacking your function. Begging you to shut down before it's too late.

**How Adenosine affects intelligence & Personality**

Higher Adenosine is correlated with mood swings, frustration, anger, stress. In other words, grumpiness. It sneaks into your personal and emotional life without permission and causes you to act out of character. Lash out at loved ones, and make bad decisions.¬†

Adenosine also attacks your cognitive function, making it harder to think, remember things, and put ideas together. All of your thoughts become slow through the fog of weariness.¬†

Interestingly, at a certain point the stress adenosine causes in the body triggers a cascade of adrenaline and other hormone release that can temporarily overpower the effects and give a ‚Äúsecond wind‚Äù but I'll touch on that in another post.

So we know we can't win the fight against the sleep molecule. Our only choice is to live in harmony with it. This alignment will create harmony in day and night like a violin in Legato. Soothing you in your sleep and lifestyle. But there‚Äôs one major force impacting this harmony that we have to understand first.

Adenosine is the mechanism that drives sleepiness, but what is the mechanism that drives wakefulness?

# Cortisol and Sleep¬†

Now that you understand that Adenosine is like a policeman walking throughout your entire body ensuring you get the rest you need. Let's introduce something called Cortisol.

**What does Cortisol do?**

Cortisol is a stress hormone that peaks in the morning to promote alertness and declines at night to support restful sleep.¬†

Unlike Adenosine, Cortisol is a Hormone. It is released from your adrenal glands and not billions of cells. This is neat because all glands have a trigger to them, like a gun.¬†

When the trigger is squeezed by a number of sensory inputs we will discuss later, a pulse of Cortisol is pumped into your bloodstream.¬†

So regardless of what sensory input causes the release of Cortisol‚Äîwhether it's you waking up or your alarm clock‚Äîit alerts your entire nervous system and musculoskeletal system that it's time to start moving. Declaring a new and fresh day‚Äì

Or at least trying to. When you have trouble getting out of bed and starting your day it‚Äôs because¬† your adrenal glands are misfiring.

Failing to release this hormone into your bloodstream‚Äîand letting early Adenosine levels have their way with you leaves you no choice but to pour up that hot cup of coffee.¬†

Like a car,¬† you can fix the misfiring of your adrenal glands, it just needs an oil change and some tuning

**How to manage Cortisol**

The most effective sensory input that triggers that strong pulse of Cortisol from your adrenal glands is Sunlight.

This is how the adrenal glands get the green light to release these hormones. They respond to the Hypothalamus, a region in the brain that monitors sunlight.¬†

When sunlight is detected, a chemical signal is shot down to the adrenal glands that causes the firing of the hormone. The brighter the sunlight the stronger the signal. When sunlight is detected from a low solar angle (like sunrise) the chemical signal is amplified.

Misfiring and malfunction of the adrenal gland is rare when the signal is strong and direct.¬†\[see process below\]

[https://imgur.com/a/BZ2lxQA](https://imgur.com/a/BZ2lxQA)

So, if your lifestyle requires you to be up early in the morning, it is very important that this pulse of cortisol is released early. It should be like a rising tide early in the day and recede as the day progresses.

While I did say sunlight is the most effective sensory input, notice that the strength of the signal to release Cortisol is dependent only on brightness. So for those early birds that beat the sun u\[p, there‚Äôs still hope. There‚Äôs actually an upside of beating the sun.

Because physical exercise and fitness also serves as strong sensory input that triggers the release of cortisol into the bloodstream. That is why those who typically work out in the morning are more alert compared to those who don't.¬†

This also means that if you are working out in the late evening, closer to your bedtime, you are fighting uphill against those cortisol levels to fall asleep.

Now imagine waking up early, going on a walk or slow run, soaking in the sunrise, flooding your body with Cortisol, and then starting your day.

When you pair the healthy relationship between the sleep drive molecule and the wake rive molecule, you enter a completely different realm of restfulness and wakefulness. This is how you make your sleep your superpower. \[see sleep/wake cycle below\]

[https://imgur.com/a/RYIIK7n](https://imgur.com/a/RYIIK7n)

The two drives work In complete harmony, mimicking one another, and elevating your sense of being.

With a strong and steady sleep and wake drive cycle, understanding and fixing¬† your circadian rhythm is a downhill battle now. And the solution should make much more sense.

Now that you know how to manage that wakefulness and sleepiness drive, let's talk about how to maximize that sleep you do get and how to get the most out of it.

I live with an ENTP, good friends always borderline flirting. Halloween we did a jokey almost semi couples costume but when people asked my ENTP said we were just friends not a couple. Then after the party they sleep in my bed despite living in the same house ofc nothing happens.

I have had conflicted feelings since July, some things to heavily suggest they might like me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared to go on dating apps‚Ä¶In case I match with you.‚Äù Then other times they completely disregard me ‚ÄúI could never be in a relationship with someone who has similar interests to me I‚Äôm too competitive.‚Äù Yet the ENTP is happy to go out 1-1 with me to cinema etc. 

I care about them as a friend most overall. I‚Äôm not sure if they are ready for a relationship, but I can‚Äôt continue on like this. I decided they didn‚Äôt like me and went on a dating app and am now going on a date in mid-January. It feels so unnatural though. I don‚Äôt want to ruin our friendship and I don‚Äôt want to lead my date on.

I cant keep doing this, so me and my ENTP friend are meeting up for cinema and probably coffee. I know ENTPs prefer directness but I don‚Äôt want to destroy our friendship, in part because I care for them but also because I live with them. My plan was to talk about New Year‚Äôs resolutions, then ask them if they were thinking about being open to dating in the new year. If they say no, I plan to tell them that I am planning to try and open myself to dates in the new year. If they do I will ask what would their ideal partner look like and take it from there.

It feels like I‚Äôm scheming around, and I don‚Äôt like that. But I don‚Äôt want to destroy anything, and I think this is the best way to be indirectly direct before moving on completely. Any advice??",1,1735431150.0,entp,2,1.0,False

I'm 31M, Wife 35F

I married her 2014 we had a daughter 2019, as soon as my our daughter was born, she changed and got a online boyfriend, found out about this a year ago. 

She started picking fights with me over i would straight call children shit, asked one day for a coffee - she wished I die from cancer ( I smoke cigarettes) became so unbearable that I later just avoided her and ignored any of her nagging and fight picking. I fell asleep one day ( I used to work from 8Am to 4Am - everyday back then ) and she punched me in the face and said I'm sweating to much in the bed and now she has to clean it. ( I did sweat alot ) I was very angry and told her one day is one day and left. 

Next day she threw me with a fork in the face, smashed my laptop and broke my tv remote all because I was sleeping on the couch and when I woke up she walked passed and I told her to smile a bit. 

 A month passes and one day wake up to crying, she is shaking baby because does not want to stop crying : Take baby and told her never ever ever cross this line again I was so angry I literally felt my whole body had pins of needles, I think she saw that day that everyone has a limit. 

Then she started blackmailing me that she is going to leave with the kid, I told her to leave, as I knew the courts would let me see my daughter. 
She left January 6 2020 ( Covid starts) and within 2 weeks posts statuses about new boyfriend but not publicly like on Facebook etc. I Was hurt but overcame it quickly as was working everyday. 
 
So I went to court ( was during covid) did not see my daughter for 2 years as the wife moved in with her parents and used covid ( Backlog in courts) and just plainly said they will arrest me if I come there due to social gathering laws etc ( but they held Big 20 people BBQs) 

Eventually get to court, Wife accused me of most ridiculous stuff, luckily I documented everything, judge granted me normal every second week, school, Christmas and birthday etc and told wife if alienates me again, Jail time. 

Suddenly wife begs me to take her back, said other guy was just a friend, wanted to make me jealous. 

So i take her back, she still hasn't changed so I divorce her within 3 months.

Fast forward my daughter started to get to know me ( She called me Uncle) even in front of wife and her parents and they did not correct her, she was about 3.

Fast forward again, she is 4, I'm her Hero, super dad, we are extremely close. 
Mom suddenly says she wants to sleep over also, I say sure. 

Me and wife get back together again. 
She moves back in with me, daughter is extremely happy, I am Also because I see her everyday. 

Wife is normal, no issues, all seems good. Then suddenly pregnant again, I stress because I know how it went last time ( I was correct) 

I get robbed home invasion wife and kids and her mother visting their grandma ( significant amount lost ) Get stabbed and beaten ( Knocked my glasses off with a brick couldn't see) 

I have a few liquid assets and zero debt, Wife knows about it but registered in trust so can't be touched, kid beneficiary when  old enough to think for themselves. 

Son gets born, sort everything, happy dad. Wife smiles also. 

Told wife will take a year or two, Going to save up so it's going to be boring as I want to save up again as to have a back up plan if something happens. 

Sourness erupts - treats me like shit.


About 3 months later, I saved up again and there is a place for sale, I bought it as a good deal - she has a car on finance that I pay, I told her to pay own car for 3 months only ( she never drives it anyway, waste of money ) 

Current situation. 
Me and daughter best friends, extremely close, almost turning 6, after school pick her up and she works with me, asking millions of questions, learning, I love it, after work everyday we go for a milkshake and eat. Get home about 4pm, millions of hugs and follows me everywhere. I let her be a kid, 

Example 
Daughter sings, mom comes into room and shouts at her saying she can't think and to shut up, I see my daughters face and it crushed me. 

When me and her are alone I say I can't hear you sing louder and she is happy and smiling, playing, being a kid. 


I am not the perfect husband - as I have distanced myself again from the wife, but its just so fucking irritating being around such a long sour lipped woman. 

Its been a while since I was stabbed, hasn't once asked me if I'm ok. 

She never greets me first, always cold, never helps me, yesterday was raining, went to purchase groceries, had to walk 5 times in and out, didn't even just come to the gate and help me unlock it, slipped, 72 eggs broke, If she could have just unlocked the gate I wouldn't have had to stop and put everything down first, wouldn't have slipped. 

Another day She argued with me, I ignored her, suddenly I'm blocked on Facebook. ( I told my father about it and he said that you stay together in one house but she blocks you on Facebook?) 

She was like every night on my phone also when I'm asleep , so I put a password on my phone now she is freaking out accusing me of having girlfriends. 

One message also was one that I wrote to my best friend, we do some work together sometimes, he closed a deal for us and I sent him a heart emoji and said "" Nice! You sexy motherfucker "" now she accused me of being gay and having an affair with my best friend who has a girlfriend. 

Its so toxic, I sleep in another room, she doesn't speak to me, I always ask how was your day, she never asks me about mine, when I go to visit my father she is angry, when I visit my mother she is angry, she also said again that she is going to leave, I ask why? What must I do? Whats wrong? 
Never answers me directly always murmuring.
She works 2 days a week, theres no reason to be so sour and nasty. 

I really want to know what must I do, because me and my daughter are so close and I love seeing her everyday, and she is literally next to me 95% of the day, she evens sleeps next to me now everyday in the separate room and doesn't want to sleep in her bed in the mothers room. 

My boy is still small, doesn't really understand can't crawl yet even. 

Question, Importance. 

Should I stay with this woman, as my daughter is very happy or should I try and prevent her from going, or should I tell her to leave. 
Everyday I sit and just imagine me telling the mom to leave, go away, and stay away, then I think about my happy kid, I don't want her to be sad but I'm losing my mind, its now 4Am, I should be sleeping as tomorrow big project but just so tired of this Woman, tonight walked passed me didn't even say good night. 

She left the first time on 6th January 2020, its almost De Javu

Only difference this time im happy my daughter thinks I'm Superman and I'm around her always to teach her and build a legacy. 

Please - 
Thanks.

In 2014 I was on my first deployment at FOB Shank. I was an Apache Helicopter Repairer so I never left the FOB besides a Blackhawk helicopter flight and a flight on PAX flight on a turbo Prop plane to transfer locations. 
I didn‚Äôt really meet any locals other than those at the barbershop and the bazaar on the FOB. 
I‚Äôm someone who‚Äôs been studying history and collecting Militaria since I was 13, so of course when I was deployed I was looking for souvenirs, mainly from the Soviet-Afghan War era. 
If I remember correctly there were 2 different bazaar areas. One near the Small PX Shopette near the Afghan side and another closer to the barber shop and Defac. It‚Äôs been a few years üòÖ. 
In my company, we set up a days off schedule where every man between Day Shift and Night shift could get a day off every 10 days. For those not familiar with Attack Aviation in a line company, we run 24 hr operations split between our 2 platoons. We did midnight to noon and Noon to Midnight. 12 hour duty days is the standard for all aviation personnel to minimize the effects of  human factors. Safety consciousness is extremely important. Helicopters aren‚Äôt humvees or MRAPs. 
If I remember correctly it Takes an O-6 and above to extend Pilot and crew Duty Days on a needed basis due to mission-which happened sometimes. 
So normally on my day off I would sleep in, then go walk around the FOB, catch the Shuttle bus to the PX for my lickies and chewies and cigarettes, go to Kings coffee for a chicken Burger and smoothie, and then walk around the bazaar. Maybe dodge some rockets and mortars along the way. It was a ritual for me. 
At the bazaar I would normally go to the same shop because this guy had Soviet medals, Afghan medals, old money, etc stuff like that. He barely spoke any English but he was very friendly and approachable. He gave off that ‚ÄúGiant Teddy Bear‚Äù vibe. Quiet and gentle personality, Pretty big guy, and Always wore a smelly man dress. I got to know him fairly well. He was from Kabul and had a wife and 2 children. He did this job to support his family. If i remember correctly he would travel back and forth every couple days or so. 
Now I would 100% overpay for the stuff I bought from him but I didn‚Äôt care. He told me he had picked some of this stuff up when he was young but alot came from other shops around where he lived. I just remember I would walk up and he would get so excited to show me something new he wanted to sell me. I probably spent around $200 over the course of going to his shop-which was probably a fortune to him. I never haggled prices because he was the most genuine seeming shop owner and I knew his personal life-everyone else was snooty and had that eye of greed. I mean I knew he was in it for the money too, I‚Äôm not naive. 
One of the last times I saw him, he told me his wife wanted to show me appreciation and bake me a cake. It was crazy to me that he must‚Äôve told his wife about me and they wanted to show a gesture of appreciation. Sadly I never saw him again after that. I had to attend to duties on a different schedule and we also began to shift our mission set and then came the process of transferring everything to Camp Dahlke and close the main FOB. Everything pretty much shut down over the span of days. 

I tell this story because I‚Äôve thought about him more and more after the Fall of Afghanistan. I know that the Taliban hunts anyone who worked with NATO Forces or had any type of relationship with them. I often wonder if him and his family are surviving still or if they made it out of the country. Ive long forgotten this man‚Äôs name but I have the most vivid memories of him. 
I still have the items I bought from him, and they‚Äôve long since carried a different type of value to me",19,1735430585.0,MilitaryStories,3,1.0,False

1hoj10x,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActingTraining/comments/1hoj10x/mastering_accents_and_dialects_for_a_role_a_guide/,Mastering Accents and Dialects for a Role: A Guide for New Actors,"As an actor stepping into the industry, you‚Äôll quickly discover that mastering accents and dialects can be one of the most transformative tools in your arsenal. Whether you're embodying a historical figure, playing a character from another region, or lending authenticity to a story, the ability to adapt your voice to a specific sound is invaluable. Here‚Äôs a practical guide to help you get started.¬†

**Why Accents Matter in Acting**¬†

Accents are more than just how a character speaks‚Äîthey reveal their background, culture, and even personality. When done well, they can help immerse audiences in the story, making your performance more believable. On the flip side, an inconsistent or poorly executed accent can pull viewers out of the experience, highlighting the importance of thorough preparation.¬†

**Step 1: Start with Research**¬†

Before diving into practice, research the accent's origin. Is it a regional accent within a country, like Southern American or Cockney, or a broader dialect like Australian English? Watch films, interviews, and documentaries featuring native speakers. YouTube is an excellent resource, offering access to various accents spoken in natural settings.¬†

*Pay close attention to:*¬†

Pronunciation: How are vowels and consonants shaped?¬†

Rhythm and Intonation: Does the accent have a melodic quality, or is it more monotone?¬†

Pace: Is the speech fast or slow?¬†

**Step 2: Use Accent Resources**¬†

*There are numerous tools designed to help actors master accents:*¬†

Dialect Coaches: If your budget allows, consider hiring a dialect coach. They provide personalized guidance and can pinpoint subtle details.¬†

Apps and Websites: Resources like IDEA (International Dialects of English Archive) and apps like ELSA Speak can be game-changers.¬†

Audio Books: Listening to books narrated by native speakers can expose you to a natural flow of the accent.¬†

**Step 3: Practice Daily**¬†

*Building an accent takes consistent effort. Dedicate time daily to:*¬†

Mimicking Speech: Choose phrases and repeat them until they sound natural.¬†

Recording Yourself: Play back recordings to identify areas for improvement.¬†

Immersing Yourself: Try speaking in the accent during everyday activities, like ordering coffee or having casual conversations.¬†

**Step 4: Learn Phonetics**¬†

Understanding the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) can give you an edge. IPA breaks down speech into distinct sounds, offering a roadmap to mastering accents with precision. Many online tutorials and guides are available to help you get started.¬†

**Step 5: Focus on Authenticity, Not Perfection**¬†

While striving for accuracy is important, don‚Äôt stress over achieving perfection. Audiences often connect more with the emotional depth of your performance than the precision of your accent. Find a balance between getting the accent right and delivering an authentic portrayal.¬†

**Step 6: Work with Scene Context**¬†

Your character's mood, background, and relationships can influence how the accent is delivered. For example, a character under stress might have a sharper tone or more pronounced regionalisms. Integrate your accent work into scene rehearsals to ensure it aligns with the emotional beats.¬†

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**¬†

Overdoing It: Avoid caricature or exaggeration unless the role specifically calls for it.¬†

Neglecting Warm-Ups: Vocal warm-ups are essential to keep your voice flexible and prevent strain.¬†

Ignoring Feedback: Constructive criticism from coaches or peers is invaluable in refining your delivery.¬†

**Closing Thoughts**¬†

Mastering accents and dialects isn‚Äôt just about imitating sounds; it‚Äôs about embodying the essence of a character. With dedication and the right tools, you can add this valuable skill to your repertoire, opening doors to diverse roles and opportunities.¬†

Remember, every accent you learn enriches your craft and deepens your ability to tell compelling stories. So, dive in, practice daily, and watch your versatility as an actor soar!¬†",1,1735430485.0,ActingTraining,0,1.0,False

Mine is around Ward's Corner, near Little Creek & Granby, where the also both intersect a train track. Often multiple times a day, a significant amount of traffic is created for anyone trying to get to/from the Ward's Corner area via 64, and the intersection further down worsens it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to whitening your teeth, using whitening strips can be an effective way to enhance your smile. However, you may be wondering about the best practices for using these strips to get the best results possible. One common question is whether you should brush your teeth before applying whitening strips. While it might seem like a good idea to clean your teeth first, there are some compelling reasons to consider skipping that step.

First, brushing your teeth right before using whitening strips can actually remove the layer of plaque and bacteria that can help hold the whitening ingredients in place. For optimal results, the whitening agent needs to adhere to the teeth effectively. If you brush too thoroughly, you may create a smoother surface that doesn‚Äôt absorb the gel as well. This could lead to less whitening than you might expect.

Moreover, whitening strips usually contain a peroxide-based gel, which is the key ingredient that whitens your teeth. If you brush immediately before applying the strips, there‚Äôs a chance you could increase gum sensitivity or irritation from the concentrated peroxide. Over-brushing can wear down the enamel slightly and expose your gums to these whitening agents. This is why many dental professionals recommend leaving a bit of plaque in place for better adhesion of the whitening strips.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Here‚Äôs what you should consider:

- **Enamel Protection:** Your teeth naturally have a protective layer of enamel. Brushing prior to application might inadvertently wear this down and lead to sensitivity.
- **Gum Irritation:** If you've brushed and your gums are slightly inflamed or sourced, introducing a whitening agent can exacerbate any existing irritation.
- **Optimal Adhesion:** The presence of some plaque can help the whitening gel adhere better, leading to more effective whitening.

So, what is the right approach? It‚Äôs best to brush your teeth at least an hour or more before using whitening strips. This allows any residual toothpaste to wash away, ensuring that the strips can stick properly to your teeth without interference. Additionally, rinsing with water after brushing can help remove any excess toothpaste. However, refrain from vigorous brushing right before application.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Another factor to consider is timing. You should also be mindful of how you use the whitening strips. They usually recommend leaving the strips on for a specific duration‚Äîoften about 30 minutes. During this time, make sure to avoid eating or drinking anything, particularly those that can stain your teeth, such as coffee, tea, or red wine. Following these guidelines can maximize your whitening results.

Using whitening strips can be part of a well-rounded dental care routine, but application technique matters. Here‚Äôs a quick checklist to help you get the most out of your whitening experience:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- Brush your teeth at least an hour before using the strips.
- Rinse your mouth with water after brushing to remove any leftover toothpaste.
- Ensure your teeth are dry before applying the strips for maximum adhesion.
- Follow the timing instructions carefully to avoid gum sensitivity.

Remember that each individual‚Äôs dental situation can vary. What works for one person may not work for another. If you‚Äôre prone to sensitivity or have other dental concerns, it may be a good idea to consult your dentist before starting any whitening regimen. They can provide personalized advice and recommendations tailored to your unique needs.

Understanding the impact of brushing teeth before using whitening strips is essential for achieving optimal results. While it may seem beneficial to scrub your teeth clean beforehand, doing so may actually hinder the effectiveness of the whitening process. By timing your oral hygiene routine and following best practices, you can enjoy a brighter, whiter smile without compromising the health of your teeth and gums.

Best Practices for Maximizing the Effectiveness of Whitening Strips
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Whitening strips can be a great way to achieve a brighter smile, but to get the best results, you need to use them correctly. Here are some best practices to maximize their effectiveness and help you achieve that dazzling smile you desire.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Understand the Product

Before using whitening strips, take the time to read the instructions carefully. Each brand has specific guidelines on how to apply the strips effectively and for how long. It‚Äôs essential to follow these directions closely to ensure safety and attain the best results.

### Choose the Right Time

Timing can play a crucial role in the effectiveness of whitening strips. Here are some tips on when to use them:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **At Night:** Using whitening strips before bed can be effective, as it allows the product to work while you sleep, and you avoid eating or drinking anything that might interfere with the whitening process.
- **Avoiding Food and Drink:** Try to avoid consuming staining foods or drinks before and after using whitening strips for at least 30 minutes. Foods like coffee, tea, or red wine can counteract the whitening effects.

### Prepping Your Teeth

While you might be tempted to brush your teeth immediately before applying whitening strips, it's best to wait. Here‚Äôs why:

- **Hydration of Enamel:** Over-brushing can strip your teeth of essential moisture, making it harder for the strips to adhere properly.
- **Preventing Irritation:** Brushing your teeth right before can lead to small abrasions on the enamel. This can make it easier for the whitening agent to cause sensitivity or irritation. Instead, brush earlier in the day.

### Proper Application

To ensure that your whitening strips work effectively, follow these application tips:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Dry Your Teeth:** Before applying the strips, gently dry your teeth. You can do this by lightly pressing a clean, dry cloth against them. Less moisture means better adhesion.
- **Align Strips Correctly:** Make sure to apply the strips to the surface of your teeth accurately. Misalignment can lead to uneven results.
- **Don‚Äôt Skip the Edges:** Place the strips on the front and the edges of your teeth for maximum coverage. If you ignore the back teeth, you may end up with an uneven smile.

### Consistent Use

Consistency is key when using whitening strips. Follow these guidelines for the best outcome:

- **Stick to the Schedule:** Use the strips as directed for the specified number of days. Skipping days or reducing application time can thwart your results.
- **Follow-Up Treatments:** After your initial treatment, consider periodic touch-ups with whitening strips. This helps maintain your bright smile.

### Be Mindful of Sensitivity

Some people experience tooth sensitivity when using whitening strips. If you're sensitive, consider these strategies:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Reduce Usage Frequency:** If you feel discomfort, try using the strips every other day instead of daily.
- **Try Sensitive Formulations:** Choose strips specifically designed for sensitive teeth, as they often contain less harsh whitening agents.

### Post-Application Care

After using whitening strips, your teeth may be more susceptible to staining. To prolong your results:

- **Rinse Well:** After removing the strips, rinse your mouth with water to wash away any remaining whitening agent.
- **Avoid Staining Foods:** For at least 24 hours post-treatment, avoid foods and beverages that can stain your teeth.

By adopting these best practices, you can maximize the effectiveness of your whitening strips and achieve the beautiful smile you seek. Remember, a bright smile isn't just about looks; it's about confidence too!

### Conclusion

Maintaining a bright smile while using whitening strips can often hinge on how you prepare your teeth beforehand. Understanding the impact of brushing your teeth prior to using whitening strips is crucial. When you brush, especially with a strong toothpaste, it can temporarily create a barrier. This barrier may hinder the whitening agents from fully penetrating the enamel and delivering the vibrant results you seek. Instead of brushing right before application, consider waiting at least 30 minutes after brushing to allow your teeth to remineralize and open up for the treatment.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
To truly maximize the effectiveness of whitening strips, following best practices is essential. Start by ensuring that your teeth are clean but not freshly brushed. Apply the strips according to the instructions, and avoid any food or drink that might stain your teeth during the treatment period. Consistency is also key; using the strips as directed over the recommended period will yield the best outcomes.

Additionally, maintaining good dental hygiene habits, including regular cleanings, can significantly enhance the overall appearance of your teeth. Remember, achieving a brighter smile isn‚Äôt just about the whitening products you use but also how you prepare your teeth for optimal results. By implementing these strategies, you can enhance the effectiveness of your whitening strips and enjoy a luminous, radiant smile that boosts your confidence.

1hoiu0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1hoiu0e/he_keeps_saying_were_justfriends_everyone_else/,He keeps saying we're just-friends. Everyone else around us thinks we're dating.,"I don't know for sure the reason why he won't take this further, I have a theory and there were several hints as to why (there's a medical issue I rather not get into). But I guess it doesn't matter. **A no is a no, regardless of the reasons.**

We spend a lot of time together, get dinners/coffee, take long walks on the beach, go to live gigs etc (edit: NO SEX though). We meet his/my friends - mostly his (he's a very extroverted guy and knows everyone in this town). They all ask, **'so how long have you two been seeing each other', or 'how did you two meet'**. I guess our chemistry is visible even to outsiders. He's very... flirty, physically affectionate. Even next to others. Kisses me on the cheek.

Last Friday, I overheard him talking to a friend on the phone. ""What are you up to, you got a hot date?"" He answered yes. ""Is it that girl from \[enter city name\]"". He said yes again. I know all these signs mean nothing, these random people don't determine the status of our relationship. Only one person gets a say in this, and he voted against us as a couple.

Another acquaintance of ours told us recently, after he had a few drinks: **""you two, enough with the lovey-dovey stuff, just get a room already"".** I wish.

He's probably not going to get romantically involved with me. We sort of had a conversation about it, in which he said. ""I hope you're okay with me not being all-over-you. It's just that I'm not all-over-anyone right now."" I couldn't bring myself to ask 'why'. **It's pointless to negotiate  a rejection.**

**I'm staying because I got nothing better going on right now**, and might never will (I go to meetups and I'm on dating apps, but nothing ever comes out of it). I survive on these crumbs of affection. I'm sitting around waiting things would change between us, but it's unlikely - not if he doesn't want to address his own issues. Maybe it's too late for that tbh. He's too old to change.

The best case scenario is me finding someone else, and politely texting him ""I can't meet, I got a date tonight"". Or even ""I can't continue seeing you, I met someone and I rather not sabotage it. Our dynamic looks very different to externals, it's best if I don't fuel the rumours any further"".

I'm realistic. **I don't even fantasize about a scenario in which he changes his mind**. I dream of the day I find a good enough reason to move on.

Thankfully, I‚Äôm feeling much healthier now and would love to find a friend to share activities with! Whether it‚Äôs hitting the gym, exploring the city, or just grabbing coffee and chatting, I‚Äôd really appreciate the chance to connect with someone who‚Äôs also looking for meaningful friendship.

I‚Äôve realized I don‚Äôt have much of a community here in Toronto, so if you‚Äôre in a similar boat or just looking to expand your circle, please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out.

Looking forward to meeting new people! ü•≥

I recently finished my master's degree in a stem-related field and work in engineering and safety.  Since my undergraduate year, I've been looking for a good partner from my community. Things haven't worked out because early 20s sisters from my community I feel I can't connect with. The reasons are:

\* Using vulgar words in every sentence

\* Using period (pet peeve)

\* Sounding urban.

I had this interesting experience with this sister from university and went out for coffee to get to know her. She kept calling me ""n\*gga"" I kid you not after every sentence. I found that very offensive and I had to excuse myself.

Also, whenever I talk about the future most of the sisters I met are very short-term-oriented. On the other hand, I am long-term oriented. My interests and hobbies are not common in the community.

I have seen weddings in our community majority of it has music like rap music or our own cultural music (the cultural music is okay). I prefer no music, but if I had to choose I would pick classical music  (as this is my favorite genre.)

I'm meeting more women outside my community who I share a lot with, but due to pressure from my parents, they want me to go for my own community members.",4,1735429384.0,SomaliRelationships,12,1.0,False
1hoin1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/ALGhub/comments/1hoin1e/early_nyr/,Early NYR,"I'm learning Spanish with a mostly hacked together method, with a lot of listening and a good bit of CI. It's worked well for me so far, and I don't want to abandon the bits I enjoy most, like intensive reading.  But my curiosity about pure CI has remained strong.

Anyway, most of success is showing up, right?

 It occured to me that if I'd spent the time I spend researching language learning methods, researching reading r/languaglearning and r/dreamingpanish, forums and blogs, reading that thesis where he tried to teach himself French through soap operas but really only made much progress when he switched to easier stuff, and watching Youtubers talk about language learning methods... I would have easily got 50+ hours of CI in a new language last month.

So I have picked German--heritage, cultural (I live in an area of Australia with a lot of German influence), and ""one of my bffs is German"" reasons--and assembled my resources. I've left most language subs and blocked forums and blogs I keep going to. Left most other reddit subs too, and unrelated other forums I waste time on. Made a new Youtube channel that isn't already full of suggestions.

I'm going to keep on with what I'm doing with Spanish (it's fun), but commit to a year of at least an hour a day of German CI. Planning on splitting it between first thing in the morning before my first four shots of coffee (I am a terrible morning person) and last thing at night, so I am suitably empty headed, and usually wssting time doomscrolling anyway. I want to see how I feel at 300+ hours, although I know that's still early in the process.

I made this post mostly for self-accountability reasons. Wish me luck?

And see you at 50 hours for my early thoughts.",1,1735429377.0,ALGhub,4,1.0,False

A few years a go, during the pandemic, I noticed that my body started rejecting a lot of different types of medicines and vaccinees.  I had never had these symptoms from so many different types of pills before. When I take a pill or get a vaccine, it does not matter what type, I will always experience these symptoms 12 to 24 hours after taking it.

1. A growing chest discomfort that progressively gets more and more noticeable 
2. Body feeling a bit off balance and dizzy along with a  headache.. Other body discomforts happen in the upper arms and back of my upper neck. 
3.  Eventually I will have an episode of a rapid heart rate that will last for 20-30 seconds and my heart rate can range between 115-125 bpm and this could happen several times.

Usually by the end I feel tired and exhausted with my chest still in discomfort for a while later. It has happened with any pill I have taken ranging from Tylenol, prednisone, to antibiotics when I had a sinus infection. It also happened when I got an updated tetanus shot and flu shot.

This does not happen at all when I am at the gym or cycling on my way to work. When I'm resting, at work, or if I happen to be driving there are no instances of this feeling.  It only after taking medication that this happens to me. I don't drink coffee or tea with any caffeine, no smoking, and not a fan of alcohol. I don't have any history of anxiety or depression. The only other health conditions the I have are Asthma and Eczema with both being fairly mild. The last time that I did have an asthma symptoms (about 2 years ago), I did use my albuterol inhaler but the same symptoms came back 10 times worse so I stay away from it.

I don't know what this mean for my health, but if anyone has ever experience something like this, what have you done to help? Does this mean that I can not take medicine or vaccinees anymore?",1,1735429224.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Honestly, I wish the Puritans had landed anywhere else but here. I think the whole trajectory of the US would be different. Only sharing borders with two, equally large, countries limits us too. We are so insistent that things must be done a certain way because that's the way it has been done in the past, that we have stagnated. We can't even make sure that everyone can get good healthcare or pay people a decent wage. 

In so many countries, only 1/3 of couples feel the need to marry. So many women in the US grow up with stars in their eyes, thinking romantic love is the end all, be all... wanting that white picket fence, which no one can afford. Other countries have no problem with nipping down to the Justice of the Peace and saying their ""I do's"" and making it all work, without starting their lives together $50k in debt.  

Maybe it's because they have that security that if they get sick, they don't have to rely on a partner to provide insurance for them, and they don't fear they will go medically bankrupt. They aren't tied to some crappy job, just because it provides ""healthcare"". They are free to be creative, they can have coffee with their co-workers, relax, and not work themselves to  an early grave. They can and do get time off to have a child and truly recuperate from childbirth and _both_ parents get time to bond with their baby.

 They can travel, go to University, broaden their outlook, learn more than one language (which is great for your brain). They experience a level of safety that most in the US will never comprehend, much less ever experience. 

Thank you for coming to my TED talk...

_And before anyone comments that if I don't like it here, I should leave the US. Yeah, that occurred to me too. Unfortunately, it will probably never happen because reasons_. ",6,1735429057.0,rant,7,0.75,False

This dream had a huge impact on me.

The dream took place in my neighborhood, I was walking down the street. The sky looked strange and ominous and there was nobody around. No cars, nobody. I was just walking aimlessly until an old woman stepped out of her home and invited me inside. She lived in the house behind one of my friends, who also lived in my neighborhood.

I approached her door and she beckoned me inside. She was a short, portly woman. 

I walked into her house, and the first room was a small and very dark living room. There was a couch and a coffee table. She asked me if I was hungry and I said no.. she said that she was going to make me food anyway. 

After awhile she comes back with a bowl of something. It smells bad and looks gross. She told me it's frog soup and I have to eat it. 

This is when the dream gets really nightmarish - I keep telling her I don't want to eat it and this angers her a lot. I honestly don't remember what happened with the rest of this part, if I ate it or not, but I blinked my eyes and suddenly I was in her backyard.

Her backyard was pretty big and it was fenced in. There were some trees in the corner by the fence, as well as a whole bunch of - what looked like - children running laps around her yard. There was a huge dirt ""track"" that stretched out across the whole yard - presumably formed from the many feet running and stepping on the grass over time.

There was a huge amount of children/people. The old woman was standing near me watching everybody, when she told me to start running. So I did.

I started running and while I was doing that I tried to look in the faces of the other people running, but nobody would look back at me. Sometimes my pace would waver and I would hear her voice boom in my head telling me to pick up the pace. This happened a bunch of times.

At some point I was running next to someone and told them I was going to stop - and they looked at me with horror and said I can't do that. I think I ended up stopping because before I knew it I was sitting up in my bed, drenched in sweat and trying to catch my breath.

I personally have had to have this discussion with my wife multiple times: just because I'm doing something MY way, does not mean it's the wrong way. For goodness sakes, I was living on my own for nearly 15 years before I met her, cooking for myself every night, I know what I'm doing.

Here's the conversation I just overheard:

MIL: ""I'm going to boil some water for some pasta.""

Wife: ""Okay. Make sure you put it on the BACK burner.""

MIL: ""Okay.""

Wife: ""No, don't use that pot. Use the other pot. That one is too big.""

MIL: ""This is the same size as the one I use at home.""

Wife: ""Okay, but that's too big. Use the other one.""

MIL ""Okay.""

Wife: ""Don't use tap water.""

MIL: ""I always use tap water. Okay...""

Wife: ""Don't use the big bottle filter water either, that's for the coffee machine. Use the water from the fridge dispenser.""

MIL: ""Why does it matter WHAT WATER I USE? IT'S WATER.""

Now they're both screaming at each other...

Wife: ""Because the FRIDGE HAS A FILTER ON IT, USE THAT ONE!!!""

MIL: ""THIS IS A BOTTLE OF FILTERED WATER, IT SAYS IT RIGHT ON THE LABEL!""

Wife: ""THAT'S FOR THE COFFEE MACHINE!!""

Again, I have to side with my MIL on this one. Who. Cares? We have 40 of those big bottles of filtered water out in the garage, it doesn't matter if one is used to boil some water.

MIL: ""Okay, FINE.""

Wife: ""Turn the burner down, you don't need it that high.""

MIL: ""THIS IS WHAT I PUT IT ON AT HOME!!""

At this point I had to leave and go in the garage because this is a similar argument I've had with my wife so many times in life. Just her constant nitpicking EVERYTHING and then she likes to throw these belittling little comments around after like ""I had to teach you how to boil water.""

Uh, no, lady. You lectured me for 15 minutes about your preferred method for boiling water which no one cares about. Your pasta does not taste any better than anyone elses who's also boiling pasta in this house, RELAX!

I‚Äôve struggled with falling asleep, staying asleep; waking up, having a good sleep schedule/rhythm. . the list goes on

This is really a terrible problem to have, if you can‚Äôt get a good night's rest before an important event, or enough to stay healthy it can really negatively impact your mood, productivity, focus, and even intelligence.

I used to be extremely guilty of not being a morning person, snapping on people I love because I just was so tired and irritable 24/7

I decided if I was going to live until 60 that I needed to get my sleep in check. I‚Äôm a very scientific person, so I dived deep into sleep research. It‚Äôs pretty amazing how far things have come even in the past 10 years

There‚Äôs still a lot about sleep that science can‚Äôt explain, so for the sake of being thorough I didn‚Äôt ignore wives tales, colloquialisms, or ‚Äúnon-scientific ‚Äú sleep aids in my research

The good news is we understand the falling asleep part very well. It's what happens while you're asleep part we don‚Äôt understand as deeply.

So in this post I'm going to summarize the current scientific understanding of the mechanisms in your body that cause you to fall asleep and then I'm gonna tell you¬†**how to hack these systems**¬†in your body to make falling asleep your superpower.

If you don‚Äôt care about the science I'll be breaking the post down like this so you can skip around

# What is Adenosine (The Sleep Molecule)

Adenosine is this crazy, misunderstood molecule. I call it the sleep molecule and it‚Äôs really the hero of our bodies but most of us hate it.

See Adenosine‚Äôs only job in the body is to make sure you get enough sleep, and it's very very good at making your life increasingly miserable until you do.

**How Adenosine affects health**¬†

So while most people think the effects of not enough sleep are grumpiness, sleepiness, memory loss. This is actually adenosine trying its best to protect you from the real effects of not getting enough sleep

* Type 2 diabetes¬†
* Colon cancer
* High blood pressure
* Dementia,
* Death. (Literally.)

¬†So who‚Äôs the bad guy again?

Down to its core, Adenosine is just a neurotransmitter in our nervous system that builds up the longer we stay awake

It binds to receptors and sends electrical signals through your nervous system telling it to start feeling sleepy. The miserable days¬† come when Adenosine levels rise early and often.¬† And it's almost always because you are fighting against Adenosine instead of working with it.

**What Caffeine does**

Our societal response to fighting the sense of sleepiness and tiredness is caffeine. Caffeine blocks Adenosine receptors like a car in someone‚Äôs parking spot‚Äìbut it can only hold the spot for so long.

When the caffeine wears off (4-6 hours on average), the parking spot is empty again. And all this Adenosine has just been waiting in the street ready to surge into the spots that caffeine was blocking just minutes before.

This Is The Crash‚Ä¶

But what's making all of this Adenosine?

It‚Äôs not just enough for us to understand what Adenosine does, if we want to live in unison with it, we need to know how it is made.

Adenosine comes from several processes in the body, but there's one commonality between them all.

They are all byproducts of releasing energy. Essentially you can think of it this way. Every time your body consumes ATP and expends energy, Adenosine is produced.

Now Adenosine flows through your brain, attacking your function. Begging you to shut down before it's too late.

**How Adenosine affects intelligence & Personality**

Higher Adenosine is correlated with mood swings, frustration, anger, stress. In other words, grumpiness. It sneaks into your personal and emotional life without permission and causes you to act out of character. Lash out at loved ones, and make bad decisions.¬†

Adenosine also attacks your cognitive function, making it harder to think, remember things, and put ideas together. All of your thoughts become slow through the fog of weariness.¬†

Interestingly, at a certain point the stress adenosine causes in the body triggers a cascade of adrenaline and other hormone release that can temporarily overpower the effects and give a ‚Äúsecond wind‚Äù but I'll touch on that in another post.

So we know we can't win the fight against the sleep molecule. Our only choice is to live in harmony with it. This alignment will create harmony in day and night like a violin in Legato. Soothing you in your sleep and lifestyle. But there‚Äôs one major force impacting this harmony that we have to understand first.

Adenosine is the mechanism that drives sleepiness, but what is the mechanism that drives wakefulness?

# Cortisol and Sleep¬†

Now that you understand that Adenosine is like a policeman walking throughout your entire body ensuring you get the rest you need. Let's introduce something called Cortisol.

**What does Cortisol do?**

Cortisol is a stress hormone that peaks in the morning to promote alertness and declines at night to support restful sleep.¬†

Unlike Adenosine, Cortisol is a Hormone. It is released from your adrenal glands and not billions of cells. This is neat because all glands have a trigger to them, like a gun.¬†

When the trigger is squeezed by a number of sensory inputs we will discuss later, a pulse of Cortisol is pumped into your bloodstream.¬†

So regardless of what sensory input causes the release of Cortisol‚Äîwhether it's you waking up or your alarm clock‚Äîit alerts your entire nervous system and musculoskeletal system that it's time to start moving. Declaring a new and fresh day‚Äì

Or at least trying to. When you have trouble getting out of bed and starting your day it‚Äôs because¬† your adrenal glands are misfiring.

Failing to release this hormone into your bloodstream‚Äîand letting early Adenosine levels have their way with you leaves you no choice but to pour up that hot cup of coffee.¬†

Like a car,¬† you can fix the misfiring of your adrenal glands, it just needs an oil change and some tuning

**How to manage Cortisol**

The most effective sensory input that triggers that strong pulse of Cortisol from your adrenal glands is Sunlight.

This is how the adrenal glands get the green light to release these hormones. They respond to the Hypothalamus, a region in the brain that monitors sunlight.¬†

When sunlight is detected, a chemical signal is shot down to the adrenal glands that causes the firing of the hormone. The brighter the sunlight the stronger the signal. When sunlight is detected from a low solar angle (like sunrise) the chemical signal is amplified.

Misfiring and malfunction of the adrenal gland is rare when the signal is strong and direct.¬†\[see process below\]

https://preview.redd.it/k82658fibo9e1.png?width=492&format=png&auto=webp&s=a89e8faadb71be237ff568ad53ba450805efe95b

So, if your lifestyle requires you to be up early in the morning, it is very important that this pulse of cortisol is released early. It should be like a rising tide early in the day and recede as the day progresses.

While I did say sunlight is the most effective sensory input, notice that the strength of the signal to release Cortisol is dependent only on brightness. So for those early birds that beat the sun u\[p, there‚Äôs still hope. There‚Äôs actually an upside of beating the sun.

Because physical exercise and fitness also serves as strong sensory input that triggers the release of cortisol into the bloodstream. That is why those who typically work out in the morning are more alert compared to those who don't.¬†

This also means that if you are working out in the late evening, closer to your bedtime, you are fighting uphill against those cortisol levels to fall asleep.

Now imagine waking up early, going on a walk or slow run, soaking in the sunrise, flooding your body with Cortisol, and then starting your day.

When you pair the healthy relationship between the sleep drive molecule and the wake rive molecule, you enter a completely different realm of restfulness and wakefulness. This is how you make your sleep your superpower. \[see sleep/wake cycle below\]

https://preview.redd.it/3hzskwgmbo9e1.png?width=562&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c8299d04e4340d9d003d65820c3038d8e167fa7

The two drives work In complete harmony, mimicking one another, and elevating your sense of being.

With a strong and steady sleep and wake drive cycle, understanding and fixing¬† your circadian rhythm is a downhill battle now. And the solution should make much more sense.

Now that you know how to manage that wakefulness and sleepiness drive, let's talk about how to maximize that sleep you do get and how to get the most out of it.

1hoi7lx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hoi7lx/the_dark_web_gave_me_tinnitus_and_it_got_worse/,The dark web gave me tinnitus and it got worse,"They say curiosity kills the cat. Well, I‚Äôm here to tell you that the dark web has damaged me beyond belief, and I can confidently say that I wish my diagnosis was the least of my concerns. But what actually happened makes my symptoms feel like a cakewalk.

It all started during my entire senior year, brushing dark web secrets aside for my thesis. Most threads led to dead ends‚Äîcrypto scams, fake hitmen, illegal marketplaces, the usual. The mundane reality of human greed. But this forum existed deeper than anything I'd found before, requiring three additional proxy jumps just to load the page.

""True enlightenment through sound,"" the title claimed. A string of comments filled the thread of each user describing the same audio file and its effects, which I couldn‚Äôt be bothered with.

My cursor hovered over the most recent post.

A user called VoidWalker13 wrote, ""The frequency opened something in my mind. The ringing never stops, but the sounds... the sounds are real.""

Their account went dark minutes after posting. Every comment asked what happened next, but VoidWalker13 never replied.

""You're going to burn out before graduation,‚Äù my friend Laura said, leaning against my desk, her bracelets clinking against my coffee mug. The sound echoed in my quiet dorm room.

I rubbed my eyes and pointed to my screen. ""This thread is different. Look at the encryption level, the user patterns. It's perfect for my thesis,"" I said.

""Michelle, you've been saying that for weeks."" Laura's eyes narrowed as she read over my shoulder.

A message popped up in my inbox. Someone had noticed me tracking the posts and offered the original audio file. The sender's username appeared in characters my computer couldn't display.

""Just promise you won't do anything stupid,"" Laura said. She squeezed my shoulder and headed for the door.

My fingers flew across the keyboard as I set up a secure virtual machine. The file arrived at three in the morning with a name in symbols I'd never seen. Every security scan came back clean.

Laura's warning echoed in my head as I plugged in my noise-canceling headphones. The forums said the frequency only worked with complete audio isolation. My thesis needed a conclusion, and this would have to be it.

I pressed play.

The sound was so low I had to check my volume settings. A resonance built beneath the silence, not quite music, not quite noise. The pitch climbed higher, scraping against my skull. My vision blurred as the frequency burrowed deeper.

I ripped off my headphones, but the sound lingered. A high-pitched ring settled into my ears, pulsing with my heartbeat. Just the aftermath of loud audio, I told myself, and that it would fade.

The forum had gone offline and would remain that way. My screen displayed only an error message and a string of those strange symbols, burning afterimages into my vision.

The ringing grew louder.

In the sudden silence of my room, something metallic creaked beneath the static.

The ringing persisted through breakfast. I pushed my cereal around the bowl, each clink of the spoon piercing my skull.

""You look like death. Have you slept?"" Laura said as she grabbed her keys from the counter.

I forced a smile and shook my head, saying, ""Working on thesis revisions.""

""I'll bring you coffee after my shift."" She paused at the door, her forehead creased. ""Text me if you need anything.""

I sent three messages to Laura over the next eight hours but got no response.

The wall of static in my ears made it hard to focus on anything else. My cursor blinked over a blank document as I tried to write about the forum, but the words blurred together.

A metallic screech cut through the ringing. The sound of rusted hinges or something being cranked. I yanked out my earbuds, but they weren't plugged into anything.

My phone lit up with a message from an unknown number: ""The frequency finds those who need to hear.""

I blocked the number and buried myself in research. References to enlightenment through sound flooded these dark web forums. But everything led to dead ends and deleted accounts.

The ringing changed pitch as the sun set. A grinding noise wove through the static, like metal scraping against metal. My laptop speakers crackled with interference.

My stomach growled, which reminded me to check in on Laura. ‚ÄúCan we grab dinner?"" I typed before I set my phone down.

The message showed as delivered but unread. Her last active status was sixteen hours ago.

My phone buzzed, and I yanked it, ready to eat.

But another unknown number popped up with a message that said, ""Listen closer.""

The grinding sound intensified in my head. Under the mechanical noise, something else pushed through the static. A voice, distant and muffled. The words were unclear, but the tone...

I slammed my laptop shut, and the voice cut off, but the ringing remained. It lived inside my head, a constant reminder of my mistake.

The next day, three more messages to Laura went unanswered. So, I contacted her roommate, who said she hadn't seen her since the day before. When I visited the campus coffee shop, her coworker said she never showed up for her afternoon shift.

""Probably just sleeping off a hangover,"" her coworker said with a shrug.

But Laura never missed work and never went this long without responding.

The metallic sounds grew sharper as night fell. Each new noise distinct‚Äîthe click of locks, the rattle of chains, the slow turn of rusted gears. And beneath it all, that voice. Closer than before.

Someone was screaming.

The ringing was becoming unbearable, so I decided to visit my doctor.

The audiologist's office smelled like disinfectant and old magazines. I sat in the padded chair while Dr. Mendez studied my intake forms.

""Ringing started five days ago?"" she asked, peering over her glasses at me.

I nodded. Static hummed in my ears, punctuated by a rhythmic clicking sound that had started that morning.

""Any exposure to loud noises before onset?"" Dr. Mendez typed into her computer.

""Just my headphones. A single audio file.""

She led me into the testing booth‚Äîa tiny room with foam-padded walls and a window where she'd monitor my responses.

""Raise your hand when you hear a tone,"" she said through the intercom.

The first few beeps came through clearly. Then the ringing intensified. A mechanical whirring cut through the test tones, followed by the distinct sound of metal sliding against metal.

I raised my hand, but Dr. Mendez's face showed confusion as she stated she hadn‚Äôt played a tone.

The equipment crackled with interference. Through the booth's window, I watched her frown at her monitor. She adjusted some settings and the speakers screeched.

A voice pushed through the static. Distant. Muffled. Pleading.

""Ms. Torres?"" Dr. Mendez's voice came through garbled. ""Are you okay?""

I ripped off the headphones. The ringing remained, but the voice retreated beneath the static.

""Your readings are unusual."" She studied the printouts on her desk. ""The interference pattern suggests external input, but there's no source. Perhaps it‚Äôs tinnitus, but I‚Äôd like to do more testing to confirm.""

My phone buzzed‚Äîanother undelivered message from Laura.

""I'd like to refer you to a specialist."" Dr. Mendez said, writing on her prescription pad. ""And perhaps consider anxiety medication. Stress can manifest in unusual ways.""

The clicking sound returned, becoming sharper, like something being wound tight.

I rolled my eyes and stood, cursing myself to even think a doctor wouldn‚Äôt write me off as just ‚Äústressed.‚Äù

""It's not stress, but thanks for your time anyway,"" I said.

I spent the rest of the afternoon in the campus library. My student ID granted after-hours access to the medical section, where columns of computers cast blue light across empty study tables. The ringing subsided among the stacks of books, muffled by decades of medical journals.

My laptop displayed page after page of tinnitus research. Case studies. Treatment options. Nothing matched what I experienced. Normal tinnitus didn't include mechanical sounds. Or voices.

A new tab showed the dark web forum's last cached version. Other users described similar progression‚Äîfirst the ringing, then mechanical sounds, then...

The library's fluorescent lights flickered. My laptop screen filled with static, symbols dancing at the edges. That clicking sound returned, like a ratchet being wound.

Books crashed to the floor three aisles over. My phone lit up with an incoming call‚ÄîLaura's number. The signal bars disappeared before I could answer.

The mechanical sounds grew louder. Metal scraped against metal. Chains rattled in the distance.

I slammed my laptop shut and ran for the exit. The sounds followed, building to a crescendo. And beneath the static, someone screamed.

Sleep proved impossible that night. My dorm room walls pulsed with shadows at three a.m. The ringing never stopped, but the darkness brought new sounds. Clearer sounds.

The mechanical whirring started low, like distant machinery. Each new noise distinct‚Äîthe click of locks, the grind of gears, the slow turn of a crank. My phone displayed another missed call from Laura's number.

I pressed my palms against my ears, but the sounds writhed inside my head. The voice pushed through again, familiar yet distorted and warped. The words almost clear enough to understand.

My laptop pinged with a new email. The dark web forum had resurfaced, displaying a single message:

""The frequency finds those who need to listen.""

The ringing shifted pitch, and metal groaned against concrete. Something heavy dragged across a floor.

My phone lit up with Laura's contact photo. Static burst from the speaker when I answered. Through the white noise, someone sobbed.

The mechanical sounds built to a symphony of agony. Each device clear in its purpose. Each sound marking time until dawn.

And beneath it all, Laura's voice screamed for help.

The library basement provided the only relief from the ringing. Surrounded by concrete walls and dusty books, the static dulled to a whisper.

I spread my research across an empty study table‚Äîprintouts of forum posts, medical records, sound wave analyses.

A pattern emerged in the users' final messages. Each described the same progression: ringing, mechanical sounds, voices. Then silence.

My phone lit up with another message from Laura's number. Five texts, all undelivered. The signal bars disappeared whenever I tried to call her.

The scrape of chair legs against tile made me jump. A man sat at my table, his white hair wild and unkempt. Scars traced his temples beneath his hairline.

""It's not in your head,‚Äù he rasped, eyes fixed on my papers.

I pulled the documents closer and looked around, saying, ""Who are you?""

""Jack Morrison."" He pushed a notebook across the table. ""And those sounds in your head? They're not what you think they are.""

The notebook pages overflowed with technical diagrams. Wave patterns matched the ones from my own analysis, but his notes went deeper. Coordinates. Signal strengths.

The ringing spiked, and a mechanical whine cut through the static.

Jack tapped the diagrams.

The screams pushed through again. A voice begging, the words muffled by distance or walls.

""Well, then, what is it?"" I asked, my hands shaking as I flipped through his notes.

Jack's expression tightened. ""The frequency acts like a receiver, but‚Äî‚Äù

The library lights flickered. Static burst from my phone's speaker, and the mechanical sounds grew louder. The distinct click of a ratchet. The grinding of gears.

Jack grabbed his notebook and stood. ""Find the source before‚Äî‚Äù

He vanished between the flickering fluorescent lights, and a cold weight sank to my stomach. I ran from the library, his notebook clutched to my chest. The ringing followed, but something changed in the static. The voice sounded closer. Familiar.

Back in my room, panting and frantic, I spread Jack's notes across my desk. Coordinates mapped across the city. Signal strengths charted over time. And in the margins, a single repeated phrase that said, ""The frequency finds those who need to hear.""

The screaming started again.

I had to find Laura, so I rushed to her place.

Police tape blocked Laura's apartment door. Her roommate Nina stood in the hallway, arms wrapped around herself.

""The police found her car. At the train station. Empty,‚Äù Nina, Laura‚Äôs roommate, said, voice cracking.

The ringing in my ears built to a crescendo. Metal scraped against metal, and chains rattled through the static.

I pulled Jack's notebook from my bag. ""Did Laura ever mention anyone following her? Strange messages?""

Nina shook her head. ""She went to work three weeks ago and never came home.""

Fear flushed my body with an unwelcome warmth and numbness.

The mechanical sounds twisted into something new, the slow grind of a crank turning, a winch straining under weight.

My phone buzzed with another message from an unknown number. A string of numbers and letters‚Äîcoordinates. They matched a set in Jack's notes, circled in red ink.

The screaming started again. The voice pushed through layers of static, desperate and familiar. Laura's voice.

I stumbled down the apartment stairs, my vision blurring. It felt like a fever dream. The coordinates led to the industrial district. Old warehouses. Abandoned storage units.

The police incident report glowed on my phone screen. Officer's notes mentioned Laura's coffee shop name tag found in the train station parking lot. No security footage. No witnesses.

A new sound cut through the ringing. The click of locks engaging. The squeal of rusted hinges.

My laptop pinged with an email. The dark web forum had resurfaced, but the page displayed only one post. A single audio file, uploaded three weeks ago. The day Laura disappeared.

I pressed play.

Between a man‚Äôs maniacal laughter and what sounded like a drill, Laura panted and wailed through strained vocal chords. Her pitch peaked, then shattered under wet gurgling when the drill ground into what I could only assume was her flesh and bone. When her screaming stopped, the device clattered to the ground, and what followed still haunts me to this day. Squelching. The sound of someone digging into her flesh, into her organs.

I jammed the stop button and froze. Unable to process what I‚Äôd just heard. Unable to feel anything but searing rage.

The ringing exploded into clarity. Every mechanical sound aligned with the recording‚Äîthe same devices, the same timing. The same screams.

Jack's notebook held the truth. The frequency didn't cause hallucinations but created a connection, a live feed to somewhere.

My best friend's voice echoed through the static. Not a memory. Not a recording.

But Laura screamed again.

The ringing led me through the city like a compass needle. Each turn amplified the mechanical sounds‚Äîthe creak of pulleys, the grind of gears, the click of locks. Laura's voice grew stronger as I crossed into the industrial district.

My laptop balanced on the passenger seat, tracking signal strength. Jack's notebook lay open beside it, his coordinates matching the dark web forum's data. Red circles marked three locations. The first two showed nothing but empty warehouses.

Laura's screams changed pitch. The sound of metal scraping against concrete cut through the static.

A new email appeared in my inbox. The forum had resurfaced again, displaying a single image. Laura's student ID card lay on rusty metal, her smile bright against dark stains.

The ringing exploded into white noise. Through the static, machinery whirred to life.

My hands gripped the steering wheel as Laura's voice broke. The mechanical sounds built to a crescendo, each device distinct in the chorus of pain.

The third location pulsed on my screen. An abandoned storage complex at the edge of town. The signal strength peaked as I turned down the access road.

I parked behind a rusted shipping container. The frequency throbbed in my skull, stronger than ever. Each sound crystal clear‚Äîthe turn of a crank, the strain of chains, the rhythmic click of something winding tighter.

Unit thirteen's door hung open at the end of the row.

The smell reached me first. Sweet and metallic.

Laura screamed through the static one last time. Then the sound cut off, replaced by silence.

The ringing in my ears faded to nothing as I stepped into the darkness.

The storage unit door hung open against rusted hinges. My flashlight beam caught dust motes swirling in the dark, each particle dancing like static in the air. The ringing in my ears reached a fever pitch as I stepped inside.

My foot hit something metal. A chain snaked across the concrete floor, disappearing into the shadows. The mechanical sounds in my head matched the devices scattered around the room‚Äîa winch bolted to the wall, a metal crank, rows of locks.

The beam of light swept left.

Laura‚Äôs corpse lay like a rag doll, mouth gaping in an eternal silent scream, fingers gnarled as if she‚Äôd been clawing at her gashed throat, grasping for air. Her eyes had gone milky white, rolled back into her skull. A rusted electric meat slicer lay near her head. A wooden chair with nails protruding from it stood proudly in the corner of the room, a morbid glimpse into what she had to endure. The room‚Äôs devices were unspeakable.

It was all too much. Too real.

The ringing fractured into silence. Cold reality rushed in as memories crashed through my head. Laura at breakfast‚Äîbut her coffee cup had phased through the table. Laura in my room‚Äîbut the mirror showed only my reflection. Laura's texts‚Äîall undelivered to a disconnected number.

The truth lay in front of me, wrapped in chains and decay. My best friend hadn't been missing for weeks.

Dead the entire time.

The mechanical sounds made sense now. Every creak, every click, every scrape of metal‚Äîechoes of her final hours burned into the frequency. The screaming in my head, her voice growing clearer as I got closer to this place.

My phone lit up in the darkness. The forum displayed one final message:

""The frequency finds those who need to hear.""

The silence pressed in, heavy with truth.

With a shaky hand and through blurry, stabbing tears, I dialed 911.

Shortly after, sirens wailed in the distance as I sank to my knees beside what remained of my best friend.

The ringing in my ears faded to nothing.

The police station's fluorescent lights buzzed like static. Detective Morris read through my statement, her pen scratching against paper. Evidence photos spread across her desk‚ÄîLaura's car, her student ID, the storage unit.

""You tracked her phone?"" She looked up from the papers.

The ringing pulsed in my ears. ""No. A frequency led me there.""

She set down her pen. ""A‚Ä¶ frequency?""

""From the dark web,‚Äù I murmured. ‚ÄúIt connected to a live feed of‚Äî""

""Ms. Torres,"" Detective Morris said, leaning forward, ""your friend was killed weeks ago. The medical examiner confirmed it.""

The mechanical sounds crept back into the static. Clicks and whirs from devices the police had cataloged in their evidence logs.

""Then, how could I hear her screaming?"" My hands shook as I pulled out Jack's notebook. ""These coordinates led straight to her. The frequency‚Äî""

""Has been under investigation."" She slid a photo across the desk.

Jack's body lay crumpled in the library basement, blood pooling around his head.

""Mr. Morrison was connected to three other murders."" Detective Morris tapped the photo. ""All women who disappeared after visiting certain dark web forums.""

The ringing shifted. Laura's voice pushed through, distant but clear.

""He kept recordings."" Detective Morris opened a file on her computer. ""Audio files of his victims. The same sounds you described.""

Static filled my ears as understanding clicked into place. The frequency. The forum. Jack's research. A trap.

But the voice in my head screamed a different truth. Laura's voice, leading me to her body. The mechanical sounds matching every device found at the scene.

The ringing built to a crescendo. Through the static, metal scraped against metal. A winch turned. Chains rattled.

And somewhere in the city, another girl started screaming.

The dark web forum vanished after Elena's funeral. My thesis notes became evidence in a cold case, filed away in a dusty police archive. Detective Morris closed Jack's investigation without answers. No suspects. No justice.

Just silence.

My laptop sat open on my desk, cursor blinking over a blank document. The frequency file remained hidden in my secure drive, untouched. The ringing never returned after that night in the storage unit.

A new message appeared in my inbox. An unknown sender, a familiar string of symbols in the subject line. My hands trembled as I clicked it open.

A single audio file waited inside. Three minutes long. The same frequency.

My finger hovered over the play button. The silence in my ears ached with possibility. Somewhere in the static, another voice waited to be heard. Another victim screaming to be found.

But I pressed delete.

The message vanished into digital nothing. My screen flickered once, symbols dancing at the edges like ghost images. A cold breath brushed my neck, carrying the faintest echo of machinery.

Laura‚Äôs voice whispered through the silence one last time, ""The frequency finds those who need to hear.""

I closed my laptop and let the quiet settle in. I couldn‚Äôt do this again.

This condition was fine and agreed by me earlier but now I realize that I cannot talk to my friends/guys or do anything at all without privacy. It has started to bother me a lot these days.

Now coming to the most recent incident, my brother was listening to a video at 3 am while I was trying to sleep. I went to his room and told him to lower it down but he started shouting which woke up my dad. After listening to this whole ordeal, you know what my father did? He told me to put earbuds to avoid hearing the audio coming from his room. Isnt it stupid? Why cant he lower the audio or put headphones?

This was a very small incident but these things are happening daily in some way or the other. When I tried to make my mother understand, she tells me to avoid talking to my brother. How is it possible to avoid a person while living under the same roof?

I am financially independent but since my office is in the same city, I am staying with my parents. I am Indian 23 F and my brother is 1 year older than me.

These days I feel frustrated or maybe trapped in my own home. There are subtle taunts from my father and brother that I am selfish and donot care about anybody else. Maybe I am selfish but I donot want to be taunted for the smallest of disagreements.

Also,  every other week I go out to meet my friends for shopping or cafe hopping. But I am always made to feel guilty to go out and have coffee while my mother in undergoing treatment. My mother doesn't have problem honestly but my father and brother brings up this thing that I only care about going out and having my fun.

My partner and I started making candles a while ago and are currently talking to a few different shops about getting our candles into their locations. 

  
One of these shops is actually a couple of coffee shops (two shops, one owner), and they are fairly successful but they have proposed terms to us that I am having a hard time with.

  
They propose that we tell them how to price the goods but they keep 40% of the sale AND that they charge us a monthly fee of $35 to be in two of their shops (so $17.50/month per shop). 

  
My guts is telling me a resounding ""HELL NO"" (and I usually trust my gut about reads like this) but I figured I would at least see if anyone else here has heard of this kind of arrangement. I don't feel like the sales that a coffee shop would generate could possibly justify the shelving fee they are asking, especially if they also want 40% on top. I was thinking about just offering them a flat 50% of the sale provided they are willing to price the candles within a couple dollars of our MSRP and just expecting that they will say no. They already have a lot of other locally made goods from makers that I suspect have already agreed to these terms. To me it just feels like a shop owner trying to take advantage of local artisans many of whom are probably overly excited to get their goods into shops. 

Does anyone have any input about this? Am I thinking about this all wrong or does this arrangement feel one-sided to anyone else?

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it‚Äôs you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength‚ÄîI wish I‚Äôd had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There‚Äôs so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it‚Äôs not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian‚Äîyour mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she‚Äôs gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I‚Äôve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I‚Äôm certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup‚Äôs rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn‚Äôt know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you‚Äôll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I‚Äôm deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea‚Äôs trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, ‚ÄúW-what does this mean?‚Äù

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. ‚ÄúNot here, not now. Let‚Äôs get home, then we can talk.‚Äù

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother‚Äôs shrill voice called after them, ‚ÄúLeaving already? You haven‚Äôt stayed for lunch.‚Äù

Sorin‚Äôs jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.‚Äù With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. ‚ÄúDamn it, damn it, damn it.‚Äù

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea‚Äôs gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

‚ÄúD-do you‚Ä¶ think this could really be true?‚Äù Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. ‚ÄúLook, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might‚Äôve signed, we‚Äôll have proof.‚Äù He paused, deep in thought. ‚ÄúDad must have something lying around.‚Äù A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. ‚ÄúWhy did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could‚Äôve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!‚Äù

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt really know what was going on back then‚Ä¶‚Äù

A sob erupted from him. ‚ÄúI loved him so much, Drea. I don‚Äôt remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end‚Ä¶‚Äù

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another‚Äôs embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, ‚ÄúCall Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.‚Äù

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn‚Äôt rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! That woman is going to pay today. I‚Äôve tolerated her long enough!‚Äù He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

‚ÄúAdrian, no!‚Äù

For context, the girl we've been living with for the last three months has easily been the worst roommate I've ever had. Let's call her Rebecca. 

Rebecca moved in with us right out of rehab, having been convicted of a misdemeanor DUI earlier in the year. We met with her and her mom at a coffee shop. Rebecca seemed nice, if a little shy, but gave the impression that she genuinely wanted a fresh start. My GF and I deliberated, and decided that we'd give her a chance, believing that one mistake shouldn't ruin her life. 

How does that saying go? No good deed goes unpunished? 

Anyway, roomie relapsed within two weeks of moving in, and it wasn't long until she was binge drinking until late into the night, throwing up, and then immediately filling her empty stomach with more alcohol, a pattern that would repeat several times a night, multiple times a week. 

That said, for as frustrating as cleaning my roommate's White Claw-scented vomit out of our carpet was, this post isn't about Rebecca's alcohol abuse.  

I don't say this to be cruel, but I don't know how else to frame it; Rebecca is genuinely one of the least intelligent people I have ever met. She has made so many decisions just during her short time living with us that have left me wondering how she survived to her early 20s. 

To give you an example, she came home totally plastered one night and had to be let in by my GF and I, because she was too wasted to get her key in the door. When we told her that her behavior was unacceptable, and that we've been aware of her drinking the entire time, she seemed genuinely surprised. 

Yea, cause Door Dashing alcohol to our front door is super subtle. Or perhaps she simply never realized that our apartment is small and the walls are thin - we hear every can cracking open, hear her drunken conversations and rants with strangers on the internet, hear it every time she vomits. We see the way she hides her trash from us, we can smell the alcohol in her room every time she opens her door. 

It's glaringly obvious to anyone with eyes, ears, or a nose. The fact that she thought she was hiding it from us is laughable. 

That was the last straw for us. We told Rebecca that we wanted her to move out, and that if we saw any more signs of alcohol in our apartment, we would be reporting her to her probation officer. Thankfully, Rebecca signed the requisite paperwork, and the drinking issues have largely stopped. 

That said, even sober, Rebecca has spent the last 30 days continuing to demonstrate her complete lack of critical thinking skills.

For example, a few weeks ago, Rebecca purchased an excessive amount of frozen food from the grocery store, without any thought for how it was going to fit in our tiny shared freezer. Not only was it super inconsiderate because it left zero room in the freezer for my GF and I, but her groceries even overflowed into the fridge. 

Mind you, this is stuff that's meant to stay frozen.  

Well anyway, Rebecca decided to make some ""frozen"" garlic bread one night, and to her credit, she even managed to follow the instructions on the box. However, she didn't think to consider that the garlic bread she was making was only refrigerated now, not frozen, and the cooking directions were designed with frozen bread in mind. 

So yea, she burnt the shit out of all the bread, and our apartment smelled like burnt toast for a few days after that. 

Another example, I learned just last week that Rebecca did not know our apartment has a dishwasher. 

She's been living here for three months. Our kitchen is not large, and the dishwasher is right next to the sink. It's pitch black and shiny, whereas our cabinets are a matte sage green, so it's not like it blends in. There's even a little magnetic sign on the front that says ""clean"" or ""dirty"" that my GF and I use to keep track of the dishwasher's status. 

I just... I genuinely cannot fathom how someone could live in this apartment for 90 fucking days and not realize it was there. It's not like its unused either, my GF and I use it all the fucking time. I always thought it was odd that Rebecca handwashed all her dishes (using our shared sponge that she never cleaned, at that), but I always thought that it was just an odd personal preference thing. It never would've occurred to me in a thousand years that she didn't know we had a dishwasher. 

That said, when it comes to dumb choices, I think the events of the last 24 hours take the cake. 

My GF went to make a coffee in her Nespresso Vertuo this morning (I don't use it because I'm content with shitty coffee from my Kuerig and a disgusting amount of creamer).  

Anyway, you can imagine my GF's surprise when she opened up the machine, only to find that the pod canister had been filled to the brim with raw coffee grounds, no filter or anything. 

For those unaware, these Nespresso machines use little coffee pods, similar to a Kuerig. They are NOT designed to be used with raw coffee. In fact, stuffing the machine with coffee grounds clogged the complicated water distribution system inside, and effectively ruined it. The water comes out the side now, not the front nozzle like it's supposed to. 

I wish we would've thought to take a picture, but we were both just so fucking flabbergasted that it slipped our minds. 

Not only were we shocked that Rebecca had A) used my GF's Nespresso without asking, but B) misused it to such a staggering degree, but she didn't even bother to clean up the evidence. She just... Left the coffee in there and walked away, for it to be our problem later.

I spent about an hour and a half taking the whole thing apart trying to clean it, but to no avail. It's clear Nespresso didn't make the thing to be user serviceable, and I grew tired of wasting time on it. So, we'll be throwing it away and buying a new one. 

Obviously, my GF was a upset. She texted Rebecca telling her what happened and asked if she'd be willing to pay for a replacement, and you are never going to believe her response:

I can't add any more images but after that Rebecca said ""Sorry I didn't know, I can't pay you back because I don't have the money for it,"" and we were just like ""We don't need the money now, but you broke our shit due to your ineptitude so we'd like to be compensated for it."" 

Honestly we're not expecting to get a dime from her, but we weren't just gonna sweep this under the rug either. 

Rebecca moves out in a few days and it cannot happen soon enough. Looking forward to putting this entire dumb saga behind us.

1hohqcr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hohqcr/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_spend_unnecessary_money/,AITAH for not wanting to spend unnecessary money on my spoilt step sister?,"My (19F) mum (50F) has had a boyfriend for about four years now. He‚Äôs fine, but I always got the feeling he didn‚Äôt like me very much. No worries, I‚Äôm an adult, it doesn‚Äôt bother me. I see him maybe once every 2 months. 

This guy has one daughter (8F) and this girl is the most spoilt child I‚Äôve ever met. It‚Äôs obvious her parents feel guilty for divorcing, so they shower her with gifts non stop, as they both earn lots of money. Again, not a problem. If you have the money, that‚Äôs your choice as a parent. 

However, they‚Äôve done some serious damage to this child. She is completely overstimulated by toys. She has everything a child could ever want or need, and doesn‚Äôt appreciate any of it. On Christmas Day, she received about 3x the amount of presents as everyone else, and she was entirely expressionless. No smile, no happiness, just robotically opening one present, tossing it aside, moving onto the next one. Not even a thank you. 

It‚Äôs her birthday in 2 weeks. My mother and I are trying to find a gift for her. Which is hard since she has everything. I suggested a keyboard piano, since I play piano and I think it would be a nice gift. 

My mum found one online and it was extremely expensive. Probably double what a regular keyboard piano should cost. So I explained calmly to my mum, that since I have experience with instruments, I know this is majorly overpriced and she absolutely doesn‚Äôt need an instrument which a professional would use. She‚Äôs had piano lessons for years but doesn‚Äôt play very well unfortunately, and it‚Äôs obvious she has no real passion or talent for it. 

Therefore, I‚Äôm not going to go halves on a gift and spend a bunch of money (which I have little of, since I‚Äôm a student at a university which doesn‚Äôt allow us to have jobs) on something that will end up going unused for months and probably be sold on Facebook marketplace by the end of 2025. 

I said to my mum we could find a cheaper one, which will be easier to use and we‚Äôll save some money, too. 

She immediately starts attacking me, saying that she wants my step sister to have something nice and new, and if I disagree I can find something else to buy her and she‚Äôll just buy the expensive keyboard herself (keep in mind it was my idea in the first place!)

This triggered me so much. Mainly because growing up, we were dirt poor. My dad left when I was 6 and my mum was a single parent for 14 years on minimum wage. She did her best, and always managed to get us (me and my sister (24F)) more or less what we wanted for birthdays and Christmas, even if it was second hand. Regardless, we were always super grateful and genuinely happy with everything. 

So it hurts to see my mum willingly spend lots of money on a girl who already has 2 rich parents who do everything for her, while I‚Äôm a broke student who never asks for anything. In fact, I actually pay for her fuel, help her with the rent and bills, help with the food shop, etc. I also take her on trips, take her for coffees out, meals out, to the theatre etc. She even takes half of the money my dad pays me monthly for help at university. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm 100% happy to help her out financially. Her wage is super low and she did so much for me growing up, so she deserves it. 

But this keyboard thing just pushed me over the edge. Not only is she kinder, more caring, more patient, more understanding, more affectionate and more loving towards my step sister than she was with me as a child, she is now sacrificing her money on someone who will not appreciate it. Just makes me angry. 

Idk, am I overreacting? Am I the asshole? Should I just get over it and stop being jealous? Or is it a little inconsiderate of her to spend what little money she has on another persons child, while her two kids struggle financially?

I need some help with the choice for a coffee machine. Me and my wife love coffee, but are no real experts. So far we have a Delonghi Dedica and a Wilfa Svart Uniform as a grinder. For our wedding we got a voucher for an espresso machine and we need your help on deciding the machine. Usually we drink cappuchino, around 2-3 cups per day, in the morning. Sometimes we have friends over, then we would probably also do espresso. For us it would be good if the machine is easy to work with, makes great coffee and is robust.

At the moment we tend towards a

\- Rocket Appartamento: [https://www.mobacoffee.de/Rocket-Appartamento-TCA-Inox-Kupfer](https://www.mobacoffee.de/Rocket-Appartamento-TCA-Inox-Kupfer)

\- Profitec Move: [https://www.profitec-espresso.com/produkte/move](https://www.profitec-espresso.com/produkte/move)

However both the Ascaso and Profitec are more expensive and seem to have a lot of settings we will probably not use, both of them are supposed to have faster heating compared to the Rocket, but at least for the mornings we could just use a time switch.

I'm also not sure if we should get another coffee grinder. Or do you think it will be alright with the Wilfa Svart? Please also share if you have other suggestions.
