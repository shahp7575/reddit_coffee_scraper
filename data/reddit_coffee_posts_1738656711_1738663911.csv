I went to see an old friend who knows I'm trans, but we only meet every three months or so and last time I saw him I was presenting pretty masculine. I wanted to send him a 'heads up' text and nearly said something like ""I'm presenting femme now, but if that will make you uncomfortable I can tone it down.""

Thankfully I resisted. I simply said ""Just so you're not surprised when we meet up, I've been expressing myself in a more feminine style lately... can't wait to catch up...""

I showed up in my favourite outfit (I actually took *four* outfits to choose from, and was 20 minutes late because I forgot how long it takes to get ready!)

It all went fine, of course. And when we went for dinner the waiter very deliberately put the bill in front of *him* haha! Total euphoria!

The second case... I'm meeting a closeted girl today for a coffee... she's really insecure about being out, or outed so I *nearly* said... ""I'll come in my tomboy clothes.""

But thankfully I resisted again. I said ""I'll be the one in the dress."" Then described my sweater just in case she can't tell I'm trans (I'm sure she will haha!)

So yeah... that's me being visible and not shrinking back for the comfort of others.

The more other people see *us* living our best, beautiful lives as *normal people* the more acceptance we will get. That's my take!",1,1738663793.0,Project200,0,1.0,False

1ihe9w6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1ihe9w6/am_i_just_dumb/,Am I just dumb?,"I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm here for advice, for a listening ear, a shoulder to lean on, or another person‚Äôs perspective, but I‚Äôve been wanting to post about this so here we go.

Hi, I‚Äôm a 25F who lives with her mom (61F) and younger brother (23M). Recently, I‚Äôve been living what I call ‚Äúmy version of life‚Äù, rather than what has been expected of me my entire life.

Rather than working full-time (sometimes overtime) week after week, being at home to be there in case my family needs something from me, take educational courses (certifications, degrees, etc.) for things that I wasn‚Äôt sure I wanted to pursue, sitting and waiting for the approval of my mom, I‚Äôve been at home less, going out more with my first ever boyfriend (one who I love, but my mom doesn‚Äôt approve of), seeing more of the world, expanding my social circles, learning more things.

Recently, I‚Äôve finally told my mom that while I love my family, I needed to live for myself. I have worked full-time hours while being my younger brother‚Äôs caregiver when my mom couldn‚Äôt, took care of finances when needed, put my life on a semi-hold for the sake of my family. I explained to her that while they may see my efforts and actions as something guaranteed and normal, I felt like it was now time for me to ‚Äúleave the nest‚Äù like how my older sister did. 

She then asked me the following:
- ‚ÄúDid you suffer while living with your little brother and I? I don‚Äôt think you did since we left you alone.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúAre you just leaving us now?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúDo you not understand that we only have a home because of your income and how you leaving will affect us?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúAre you gonna at least do what I asked you to do (pursue Nursing, date the men that she approved of, etc.)?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs gonna take care of things when I have to go?‚Äù

Sitting there next to her, I answered each one of her questions:
- ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt say suffer, but we argued a lot about things that I don‚Äôt think we should‚Äôve even had to argue about (curfew, where I went, who I went out with, etc.) and that made me realize that it was time for me to struggle and live on my own. And I am hoping that you guys have prepared to live independently from me like we agreed before signing this lease.‚Äù [Context: Last year, I told my mom that I was going to live on my own. But she asked me to help them one more year by splitting rent so that they can get a solid footing for their own place.]
-  ‚ÄúYes, I am. I‚Äôm getting my own place for my privacy and independence, but that does not mean that I‚Äôm abandoning you guys and hoping for the best.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúYes, I understand that my income was what helped us get this apartment and give us a roof over our heads. But we agreed beforehand that after this lease, we should have the ability to live on our own since we‚Äôre splitting the rent.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúNo, I am not going to pursue the things that you‚Äôd like for me to. I will definitely keep them in mind, but I‚Äôm not in a good financial or mental state to be pursuing a degree, listen to your every word about every aspect of my life, etc. As an adult, I‚Äôm here to live out my life the way I see fit, not how you want it to be. [Context: I‚Äôve pushed back on this a few times and once asked why she was only pressuring me in this way. Her answer? ‚ÄúI basically live through you. I know what‚Äôs best for you because I‚Äôve been through it all. You‚Äôre also our last hope of what we consider a successful child; if you fail me, I‚Äôll just kill myself - there would be no reason for me to live. Don‚Äôt disappoint me because then there‚Äôs nothing left for me.‚Äù]
- ‚ÄúAs we agreed, I am willing to HELP out. BUT, older sister (26F) needs to help as well since she wants to be a part of the family more and help out. I can no longer handle everything on my own and want to live my own life the way I‚Äôve always wanted.‚Äù [Context: Older sister and mom have a rough relationship, but they have gotten better. She was the hope of the family, but now has become‚Ä¶ her own person? My mom does not approve of almost anything that she does (i.e. boyfriend, living situation, financial situation, habits, health, etc.), but I do tell her to learn to accept and voice her opinion when appropriate if she wanted to maintain the somewhat fixed mother-daughter relationship that they have now. So her way of dealing with her dissatisfactions regarding my sister? Make remarks, evaluate, and get upset. All I tell her is that if her adult daughter is happy the way she is and found a way of life, why is she trying to change something that doesn‚Äôt want to be changed? And this is a constant cycle, so there is some distance between the two. My sister also just never helped out due to her past and has now opted to help through words and suggestions.]

The conversation seemed to have gone relatively fine, and we have made our plans and searched for our new apartments. Despite me thinking that we were on the same page, recently, she told me to move into certain apartments that she sent me since they were close to where she and my brother were moving to. I have NEVER disclosed where exactly I was moving. So, when I asked why she was TELLING me to move to these apartments, she said, ‚ÄúYou have to move here so that you can take ca‚Äî I mean, support your brother.‚Äù I stood there and told her, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be in the same city and was willing to HELP, but I will not be his caregiver when my brother had the resources and ability to support himself (he has done it before for a few months).‚Äù I then left and there was a sense of uncertainty and tension in the air since.

As of late, again, I have been going out a lot more rather than staying at home (a 180¬∞ from my depressive, sleep all day, stay-at-home past). I have asked every now and then to my mom and brother if they wanted to go out (get boba, coffee, pastries, etc.) or hang out, and that is usually answered with a ‚ÄúNo‚Äù or ‚ÄúMaybe next time‚Äù. I went on a road trip (4 hours away to his hometown) recently and was met with anger, disgust, and disappointment from my mom. 

I mentioned to them before leaving that I am going on a trip from Friday to Sunday, and I will be back Sunday might. I wasn‚Äôt scolded, I wasn‚Äôt questioned, nothing happened then. But when I texted in our family group chat if they wanted anything from a well known gas station, I was then questioned and yelled at by my mom for the following things:
- ‚ÄúAm I really traveling with that little boy?‚Äù [Context: The ‚Äúlittle boy‚Äù is my first ever boyfriend who is 3 years younger than me. She liked him at first, but when he and I became more serious, she went off the deep end and began disapproving and scolding me about it every chance she gets since SHE doesn‚Äôt approve. I have told her that this was my life and while I can hear her out, this was ultimately my choice to be in this relationship and she can either take it or we can deal with it another way.]
- ‚ÄúYou have never cared for another adult in your life, but you want to care for the ones in his life? This isn‚Äôt even funny.‚Äù 
- ‚ÄúYou have never cared for your grandparents unless I forced you to, but you easily care for the one that you‚Äôve never met?‚Äù [Context: My paternal grandparents are both deceased and were incredibly abusive to my family. May they rest in peace, but I have no particular feelings or fond memories of them. And my maternal grandparents live on the other side of the world and did not try to reach out or maintain contact. While I do love them, we haven‚Äôt maintain a relationship even though I‚Äôve tried through daily messages, calling attempts (time zone differences and their erratic schedules), and more.]
- ‚ÄúSince I don‚Äôt say anything to you, you think you‚Äôre on top of the world and think you can do whatever you want, huh???!‚Äù

Shocked by her response, but not surprised since she goes off like this every now and then, I told her that I was going down to his hometown to go to a fest that‚Äôs happening, to try out new foods, to see his dogs, and to sightsee; not once did I say that I was going to care for his grandma, his parents, or his family. I continued to say that she needed to calm down because I am NOT doing anything illegal, I am an ADULT, and I am not acting self-important by doing what a normal adult does - travel for a quick weekend getaway.

We then radio silent on each other, and I‚Äôve just been getting more and more anxious for the move-out date. I know that moving out will allow me to have independence, but I‚Äôm worried about my future.

I have spoken to my boyfriend about this since we do have plans to commit when the time is right. But since this incident with my mom, I‚Äôve realized that I essentially have a lot of issues that have been pushed deep down and no support from my family in any way, and this has affected both him and I. I have been having breakdowns, consistent moments of anxiety and dread, and a strong sense of guilt.

Neither one of us expected to be in a situation where we would have parents who didn‚Äôt approve of our relationship, and I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm wasting his time and not the right one for him. I doubt myself as a person and as a partner to him; there are times where I wonder if I was gone, would he be happier? Would my family be in a better state? Would everybody be happier? Would I then be at peace, finally?

I am thinking of going to therapy, but money is just very tight due to me moving out soon and some other financial responsibilities. I have been doing introspections, self-affirmations, communicating with my boyfriend, but I‚Äôm stuck. I feel like I‚Äôm doing what I can, but I feel myself sinking and becoming like a sludge (?). He and I have spoken about the possibility of our relationship not working, but we‚Äôre pushing through it to see if we can get past this hurdle. But is this a hurdle or an immovable barrier that we‚Äôre pushing against? 

I also don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm handling the stuff with my mom and family the right way? Should I just go no-contact after moving out? Should I keep low-contact and help every now and then? Do I keep trying to help my mom understand? Do I ask my older sister to just support me the way that I have been for years? Or am I just being selfish and not thinking of family when we‚Äôre all we‚Äôve had for years.

All of these things have made me think of a few things, like ‚ÄúAm I being selfish by not breaking it off? Am I being stupid? Am I over-thinking? Am I just anxious?‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm anxious. I‚Äôm crying every other hour. I‚Äôm feeling guilt.",1,1738662910.0,AsianParentStories,0,1.0,False
1ihe8yg,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ihe8yg/changes_in_my_health_and_body_after_cutting_off_a/,Changes in my health and body after cutting off a toxic friend,"Months ago, I cut off a toxic lifelong friend that has been behind all major difficult periods of my life. I felt immensely emotionally blackmailed to stay, until I just had it and cut her off. Since then, many health issues or just ""things"" I thought were just the result of genetic lottery or the consequences of other stressors have turned out to be because of her. Every day I'm shocked at how much I put my body through by staying in that relationship, and more things continue to be added to the list as time goes by. I hope this list is the little push that you need to end the toxic relationships in your life:

\-I can digest gluten and lactose again without even feeling a tiny bit gassy.

\-I can drink coffee again without having to run to the WC.

\-I pass stool normally (it hasn't been normal in well over a decade).

\-My hair has stopped falling.

\-My clogged pores that I tried to manage through a very good skincare routine have magically unclogged on their own. It's like my skin is pushing the gunk out to the surface without any help. My skin is looking so beautiful and clear.

\-Somehow my face looks less bloated, my features are more defined.

\-The severe fatigue and mental fog that I've been battling with for more than a decade have disappeared.

\-The constant intense headaches have disappeared. I've gone from having daily headaches to not having one in 4 months already.

\-I can sleep less than 10 hours, even less than 7 hours, and still function. This used to be unthinkable to me.

\-I don't need to sleep with the help of earplugs or melatonin. I used to be a light sleeper, I thought this was just the way I am. Now, noises don't wake me up anymore. I haven't used earplugs in months and I haven't woken up in the middle of the night. Before, I would wake up if one of the earplugs fell from my ear because of my noise sensitivity when I sleep.

\-This is going to sound silly, but suddenly I can find my way without any problems. I used to never be able to remember how to return home from some areas in my city, and always needed the help of Google Maps. After cutting her off, I haven't used Google Maps once. I perfectly know where I am and how to return home.

\-The keratosis pilaris has magically disappeared after more than a decade of scrubs and moisturizers. This is another silly thing, but it's this kind of thing what wows me. How many inconveniences were actually due to her?

\-I suddenly have a flat stomach and defined waist. I used to accumulate all the fat in my abdomen and back, even in my middle/high school years. I've had periods in my life where I worked out for +1h every day and had abs, but there was still a fat pouch that wouldn't go away. I'm not working out much, I'm +30yo and my belly has never been this flat and overall defined, same with my back. Not even in high school.

\-My depression, s\*\*cide ideation, crying sessions at night are gone. They have disappeared instantly. I don't remember feeling so fulfilled ever, so satisfied, so content, so motivated to live life. I find joy in everything, it even feels like the world has more color, my bed sheets feel different against my skin. It's like every sensation has intensified.

1ihe7gx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1ihe7gx/dont_you_find_that_suspicious/,"Don‚Äôt you find that, suspicious?","‚ÄúYou will own nothing and be happy‚Äù - WEF, 2018. 

So bear with me. I am nowhere near a perfect Christian or perfect person. And I want to premise that there‚Äôs a lot I absolutely don‚Äôt know about this world or the spiritual world, but I am doing my best to learn in both. Especially where God is concerned so that can I can be healed through Christ. I know this is a long post. But I wanted to share some of the things I‚Äôve discovered on my journey that certainly shivered my timbers when coupled with MY ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù of the word of God. This is not a post saying it‚Äôs the end days. But things are from my perspective, certainly, a bit‚Ä¶.. suspicious.

Ok, let‚Äôs get into it, the South African government has for the past couple of years, and only recently signed laws allowing for the Expropriation of Private Property/Land, by the State without any compensation. The argument is to give land to the people in attempts to restore the past injustices, which makes sense, and is fine and dandy. But for the world to start allowing the government to disempower us through the facade of empowerment, it would have to sound good right? I say disempower because my personal belief is that the right to own land free from government overreach is having power as a citizen, despite the reason that may be presented to revoke this right. And I am fully sympathetic to the reason, and think it must be addressed. But if the government can control everything that empowers you eg Land, money. It would likely make you more complacent to any agenda they might have, right? Even if you don‚Äôt agree with it.

So get this, there is something called C40 cities (look it up, specifically the agenda) which are aimed to come into play by 2030. A global network of cities united to confront climate change. Sounds good right? It is listed on the WEF website, and Bill Gates has significant influence in the WEF through his foundation. Note Bill for later. So anyway, South Africa is a part of that. As well as ISO20022, the global initiative for the digitization of money and asset classes. created to start coming in effect by 2025. No more cash. This would make it easier for the Government to turn off your digital capital like a tap with just a push of a button should they choose to. And it opens the opportunity to easily make a universal currency for c40 cities. Is this setting the table for the Mark of the Beast? I don‚Äôt know man I‚Äôm just some guy on Reddit! But It seems like we‚Äôre losing more and more of our control and rights to a forming one world type government structure. And maybe everything else, all the hate between us is just smoke and mirrors to set the table to create this. 

Did you know governments around the world are pushing for the use of GMO seeds for farming, which apparently grow faster, cheaper, and are more nutritious. Sounds good right? But because they are so genetically modified, they become a patentable, which a lot are. And a lot of them also have terms of use associated with them, such as that farmers must pledge not to REPLANT those seeds after harvest or action may be taken against them, or anyone who does. Forcing you to always have to BUY new seeds when planting. Making it harder to be truly self sufficient and break away from governmental reliance. This. Is. Crazy.

And now we have a quantum super computer and AI made by Microsoft, of which Bill (here he is again) still has significant influence over. I maybe be wrong about this, but this AI (Willow) should be capable of cracking any coding we‚Äôve ever invented right? I.e. It has the capability (not necessarily that it will be used for), to know everything about us, and what we‚Äôre doing at any given point thanks to our now easily compromised phones. When compared to that level of computing anyway. And it is so powerful that the Founder of the AI lab responsible for Willow has said it may assist with the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics and the existence of a multiverse. 
Revelation 13:3-4 ‚Äúand they worshiped the beast, saying, 'Who is like the beast, and who can fight against it?'"". We have a literal super computer in the most digitally connected age, and the possible existence of other dimensions. Could the computer be the beast, could it give rise to one from a possible new dimension, or maybe I need to lay off the coffee, get some sleep and put down the tin foil hat amarite? I don‚Äôt know the answers man. I‚Äôm just a guy on Reddit!!

Btw, Microsoft are reviving an old nuclear power station in which they intend to use as much of the power generated as possible to exclusively power the AI, Willow. Not to power or help any cities. This means the super computer is already envisioned to be heavily incorporated throughout the world if it needs that much power right?

Look, whatever actually happens, we don‚Äôt have to worry as we place our faith in Jesus who is always in control of everything.
But just as a side note. Don‚Äôt you find that, suspicious??

1ihe278,https://www.reddit.com/r/phclassifieds/comments/1ihe278/im_a_high_income_professional_and_i_want_to_teach/,I'm a high income professional and I want to teach people how I did it for free,"**TLDR**: 5 years ago, I was earning 25k a month, living paycheck to paycheck. Today, I'm earning 300k in active income alone, and I want to teach people how I did for **free**.

To preface this, I'm not here to sell people a course, rather I'm here to provide **free** coaching to help people land remote jobs, specifically in SEO and Digital marketing. Those who aren't in this field but are still interested in sitting in and learning best practices in interviews and landing a job, you're still welcome to join!

# So, what's the catch?

The catch is, I need your feedback and keep track of your career progress from the time we started our group coaching sessions up to the moment you land your job (no matter how long that may be).

And when the time comes that you do land a job, I won't ask you for anything monetary. All I ask is that you keep in touch with me, keep updating me on your career, and **send me a cup of coffee**!

# Why are you doing this?

Not out of the goodness of my heart, because I understand that people don't want pity. You're here to get something out of the coaching, and I'm here to enhance my skills in public speaking and coaching.

In essence, this is a case study for me, and a test market if I'm ready to sell classes that ACTUALLY help people land their dream job.

# What do I need to join this free class?

* An updated resume or CV if you haven't graduated yet
* A message that contains your career and financial goals in the **immediate future** (within 6 months to 2 years)
* An attitude to learn

# How many can join this class and who can join?

* Right now, I only need 10 students as my schedule is packed.
* Fresh graduates, high school graduates, laid off employees, people looking to upskill or land their dream job.
* The only condition is that you'll be there to learn, not to hit on the other students or ask for favors. I want a safe environment for myself and for the students as well.

# What can you learn in the class?

* How I transitioned from earning 25k a month to a 6-digit salary
* The do's and don'ts of interviews
* Learning how to answer interview questions
* Speech practices (Trust me, speaking confidently and fluently has been an absolutely large factor of my success)
* Actionable steps to leveling up in your career
* Building your network with your peers

# When is this class going to happen and where?

This class will take 90 minutes each Saturday (unless my schedule gets in the way, which I will update the students), and this will be completely online.

  
For my future students, during each class, **dress for the job you want to land**. It sends a message on how serious you're taking this class, and it will build your discipline and determination to thrive.

I've generally been some degree of fine with my stable office jobs throughout most of my pain (19 years this month - happy birthday, pain!)

At my most recent job, 40 hours was tough but manageable (and I acknowledge the privilege I have compared to many here!!). I was asked to do more and gave it my best try, but my body gave it a big fucking NO!! - lol, and I accepted that 40 hrs was the maximum from here on out. 

The time off has been bliss, especially with my senior dog in the end game. She gets confused easily and her legs are pretty weak, but she's still thriving and happy with her familiar patterns that I can lead her through. 

But my body has gotten notably worse. I'm huffing and puffing after any activity. My leg and arm muscles, always strong, have gotten far weaker. 

I'm sure it's because of my months of inactivity - duh!, lol - but now I'm worried if I can get back to even doing a sedentary office job 40 hours. 

I'm dreading especially the first few days back. I think and hope I can get back to where I was this summer, and that the regular physical activity of just getting out of the friggin house and walking from my parking space and walking around the office to get a coffee and maybe going out to an occasional lunch - will be all good things. 

But if it's agony at 2pm, I'm going to be very scared. I just have to suck up some caffeine and give it some time.

Day 1 (Jan 30):
- Flight arrived at 9:30am, took train to Gare du Nord station and walked to hotel (10 mins away)
- Lunch at Le Petit Bouillon Pharamond (EXCELLENT traditional french food, very reasonably priced)
- Took a long walk to Mus√©e d'Orsay down the Seine to see art stands and some nice buildings 
- spent ~2 hours exploring Mus√©e d'Orsay (had a 3:30pm timeslot booked but got in earlier as it wasn't super full)
- walked to the Eiffel Tower (~35 mins) for first sparkle at 6pm
- strolled in the grocery store (G20) and bought baguette and butter for a light dinner
- taxi home (we were exhausted and the Eiffel Tower was an hour walk from our hotel)

day 2 (jan 31)
- train to Versailles (10am entry ticket)
- had lunch at Angelina in the Palace at noon
- did both Palace and gardens
- finished Versailles around 3:30pm, trained back into Paris and went to Galeries Lafayette for some shopping + watched the Eiffel Tower sparkle from the rooftop
- 7pm dinner

day 3 (feb 1)
- walked up to Montmartre at 7am for sunrise
- explored Sacre Couer (beautiful in the morning, so empty and quiet with the nuns doing their morning prayers)
- got a coffee while painters square was being set up
- walked from Monmartre to Mus√©e d'Orsay (second visit as i was with a friend)
- walked in to museum for 10am with no tickets, barely any line
- left museum at 12:30pm for shawarma lunch along the Seine
- 3pm Westfield Forum Des Halles (shopping, would not recommend on the weekends as it was insanely busy)
- 5:45pm booking at the Catacombes

day 4 (feb 2)
- Louvre at 9am. Stayed until around 12:30pm which is definitely not enough time to see the entire museum, but I honestly don't think seeing the whole thing in one day would be enjoyable because it's overwhelming. Would do the Louvre again on another trip to Paris.
- Lunch and walk around in Champs-√âlys√©es
- Arc de Triomphe
- Famous chocolate mousse from Chapon in Saint-Germain (not good IMO)
- walked around inside Eglise Saint Sulpice
- Luxembourg Garden stroll
- Fondue dinner at Le Refuge des Fondus (maybe my favourite meal of the trip. Staff are the kindest and experience/atmosphere was so cute)

day 5 (feb 3)
- Notre Dame reservation for 1pm. Don't bother making a reservation because they just let everyone in, and it honestly ruined the experience for me. This was the 3rd church I visited and was underwhelming due to the sheer amount of people crammed inside. People on facetime, shoving, talking too loudly, didn't feel like a church at all but more like a zoo. This was the first disappointment of the trip for me and if you're into churches I would highly recommend Sacre Couer or Eglise St. Sulpice (or any other church) over Notre Dame. We wanted to see Saint Chapelle also but tickets were sold out.
- Seine Cruise. Touristy but relaxing for our last day
- Walked around Le Marais which was so cool and a nice neighborhood to just stroll in
- Le Caveau de la Huchette for late night Jazz. This was an amazing experience, and although a little touristy (as are most things in Paris) it was a great way to end our trip!

day 6 (feb 4)
- Departed for London on the Eurostar. Au Revoir Paris!

my biggest tips:
1. Plan only 1-2 activities for each day, but rest assured that you will likely be able to accomplish much more than that by going with the flow. For example, I only really planned for the Louvre on day 4 as people said it would take a whole day, but we ended up only really needing the morning and the rest of the day was spent strolling, exploring, and eating. Ended up being one of my favourite days!
2. We took taxis on the first day because my eSim wasn't working well and I was overwhelmed by trying new transit, but the transit system in Paris is PHENOMENAL and ended up being all we needed for the rest of the trip. Had I not been with my mom who is a bit older, I probably would have even skipped some transits and just walked (still, we averaged 25k+ steps per day)
3. Do not plan out more than 1-2 meals on your trip. You will just end up eating wherever is nearby (there are hundreds of food places on every corner) and likely your favourite dining experiences won't be the ones with 2 hour queues due to TikTok hype. Ask your servers for their recommendations!
4. Parisians are very nice people! Always say Bonjour or Bonsoir and try your hardest to order in French, but almost everyone will speak english if you ask and are very patient. I had no bad experiences with Parisians here :)

1ihdrnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ihdrnf/when_the_walls_whisper/,When the walls whisper,"I don‚Äôt really know how to start this.

  I guess I should introduce myself first. My name is Ezra, I‚Äôm 27, and I work as an overnight security guard at an office building. It‚Äôs not exactly a dream job, but it pays my bills, and I don‚Äôt have to talk to people much. Most nights, I sit in a booth, watching security monitors cycle through dimly lit hallways and empty conference rooms. There‚Äôs a rhythm to it‚Äîcheck the screens, drink some gas station coffee, count down the hours until my shift ends.

I‚Äôve always liked working nights. The quiet. The stillness.

But lately, the quiet doesn‚Äôt feel empty anymore.

  It started small. I‚Äôd catch movement in the corner of my eye‚Äîjust a flicker on the monitor, like someone had passed through the frame an instant before I looked. A shadow in the breakroom. A shape at the edge of the stairwell. At first, I brushed it off. It‚Äôs easy to see things that aren‚Äôt really there when you‚Äôre running on bad coffee and two hours of sleep.

But then, things started happening at home, too. 

  At first, it was just the little things‚Äîthe feeling of being watched when I turned my back, the prickle of unease crawling up my spine in my own apartment. The TV would switch channels on its own, always to static, even though I never left the remote anywhere near me. I‚Äôd wake up to find my bedroom door open when I was sure I‚Äôd closed it. Once, I came home and found every cabinet in my kitchen wide open, doors gaping like silent mouths. I told myself I must have left them that way. That I‚Äôd been careless.

Then, one night, I heard whispering.

  I live alone, and my upstairs neighbor works the early shift‚Äîby the time I get home, his apartment is dead silent. But as I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, I heard it. Soft, almost like breathing. A voice, just on the edge of understanding, murmuring from the dark corner of my room. I held my breath, trying to convince myself I was imagining it.

Then it said my name.

  A low whisper, stretched out and drawn thin, curling against my ear like someone was right beside me.

  I didn‚Äôt move. I didn‚Äôt breathe. I just lay there, staring at the ceiling, waiting for the voice to come again.

  But the room was silent. And somehow, that was worse.

  That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing this.

  I need to put it down somewhere. Maybe if I see it all written out, it‚Äôll make more sense.

  I live alone in a small apartment‚Äînot much bigger than a box. One bedroom, a tiny kitchen, and a bathroom with a sink that leaks no matter how many times I twist the knobs shut. The walls are thin enough that sometimes, when I have the night off, I hear my upstairs neighbor pacing at night, the dull ""thud-thud-thud"" of his footsteps moving back and forth, back and forth. I don‚Äôt know his name.

  I don‚Äôt have a lot of visitors. I don‚Äôt sleep much, either‚Äînever have.

  Even as a kid, I used to lie awake for hours, staring at the ceiling, listening to the house settle in the dark. The groan of pipes. The creak of floorboards shifting under invisible weight. I used to imagine someone was walking around downstairs, moving through the kitchen, standing at the bottom of the staircase.

  I think that‚Äôs because I grew up in a house that was never quiet.

  My mom‚Äîshe had rules. Not the normal kind, like making your bed or saying ‚Äúplease‚Äù and ‚Äúthank you.‚Äù No, her rules were different. ""Don‚Äôt leave mirrors uncovered at night."" ""Never open the door if someone knocks past midnight."" And the big one‚Äî""if you ever hear your name whispered in an empty room, never, ever answer.""

  She believed in things. Spirits, bad energy, ghosts. She never said those words exactly, but I knew that‚Äôs what she meant. I remember waking up some nights to find her standing in the hallway, whispering under her breath, rubbing something along the doorframes. A white, powdery substance.

I never asked what it was.

I didn‚Äôt want to know.

  One night, after my mom had finished whatever ritual she was doing with the powder around the doorframes, she sat down at the kitchen table. Her eyes were distant, like she was staring through everything in the room. I was supposed to be asleep, but I couldn‚Äôt help myself‚Äîsometimes, I‚Äôd watch her when she didn‚Äôt know. This night, she finally spoke. ""There are things you can‚Äôt see, Ezra,"" she said, her voice soft, almost sad. ‚ÄúThings that follow you. They watch.‚Äù She paused, her eyes flicking toward the hallway, as though she were expecting something to step out of the shadows. I asked her what she meant, but she didn‚Äôt answer right away. When she did, her words were careful, measured, like she was telling me something I wasn‚Äôt supposed to know. ""If you ever hear your name, even when no one's around... don't answer, Ezra. You don't know what might be on the other side."" Her voice was almost a whisper by the end, like she was afraid someone‚Äîor something‚Äîmight hear. I didn‚Äôt understand then, but it stuck with me. In the back of my mind, I always wondered what she was really afraid of.

  My dad, on the other hand, thought she was crazy. He was a mean drunk, the kind that never really sobers up. He‚Äôd come home late, clattering around in the kitchen, slamming cabinets, muttering under his breath about money or work or nothing at all. My mom would sit at the table, staring past him, her hands folded neatly in her lap.

  I had a little sister, too. Molly. She was five years younger than me, small and pale with wide brown eyes. She followed me everywhere. I was protective of her‚ÄîI had to be. 
Molly was different. Quiet. She had this way of watching the world, like she was trying to understand it from a distance. Sometimes I‚Äôd catch her staring at me, her eyes wide and serious, and it would make me uncomfortable. I don‚Äôt think she ever fully understood what was going on with Mom and Dad. She was too young. But she felt it. I could see it in the way she clung to me, like I was the only thing that made sense in the chaos. I always felt responsible for her‚Äîlike if anything ever happened, it was on me to keep her safe.

I haven‚Äôt thought about them in a long time.

I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôve been thinking about them now.

Maybe it‚Äôs because of what I found last week.

  I was going through some old boxes in my closet‚Äîstuff I hadn‚Äôt touched in years. Most of it was junk. Old clothes, tangled-up phone chargers, a few notebooks filled with half-scribbled ideas for stories I never finished. But at the bottom of one box, beneath a stack of old birthday cards and yellowed newspaper clippings, I found something that didn‚Äôt belong.

It was a photograph.

A picture of me and Noah.

  Noah was my best friend when I was a kid. We did everything together‚Äîrode bikes through the neighborhood, climbed trees in the woods behind my house, stayed up late telling scary stories in his basement.

And then, one summer, he was gone.

I was eight. He was nine.

  The picture must have been taken the day it happened. In it, we‚Äôre standing in front of an old, abandoned house at the edge of town. I remember that place. Everyone said it was haunted. Broken windows, rotting wood, a front door that hung open just enough to make you wonder what was inside.

Noah wanted to prove ghosts were real.

  He and I had always been adventurous‚Äîriding bikes through alleys, sneaking into abandoned buildings, climbing trees like we owned the damn forest‚Äîbut that day felt different. There was something in the air, thick and buzzing like electricity. We had packed a bag with snacks, flashlights, and a few bottles of water, though I don‚Äôt think we ever really planned on drinking them. It was more about the thrill of the unknown, the idea that we were doing something most kids our age were too scared to even think about.
We headed into the woods behind my house, the trees arching overhead like dark cathedral ceilings, shadows stretching long and deep as the sun began to dip lower. Noah was a few steps ahead, his usual grin plastered on his face.

‚ÄúHurry up, slowpoke,‚Äù he called, pushing aside a branch. ‚ÄúWhat, you scared already?‚Äù

‚ÄúPiss off,‚Äù I shot back, but I jogged to catch up.

 The trees pressed in around us, the branches scratching against each other like whispers. The ground felt weird under my feet, like it was shifting ever so slightly with every step. I shook it off. It was just nerves. We came to a clearing, and there it was‚Äîthe house. Old. Abandoned. The roof sagging, the windows black and empty like missing eyes.

Noah whistled. ‚ÄúDamn. It looks even creepier up close.‚Äù

I swallowed hard. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have to go in.‚Äù

Noah turned to me, smirking. ‚ÄúYou kidding? This is what we came for. Thought you weren‚Äôt scared.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not.‚Äù

‚ÄúProve it.‚Äù

  He was already climbing the porch steps, and I had no choice but to follow. The wood groaned under our weight. He pressed his hand against the door, and with barely a push, it swung open with a long, aching creak. The air inside was thick, stale, carrying the scent of mildew and something else‚Äîsomething rotten.

‚ÄúSmells like ass in here,‚Äù Noah muttered, pulling his shirt up over his nose.

‚ÄúMaybe we shouldn‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúToo late,‚Äù he grinned, flicking on his flashlight.

  We moved deeper inside, our footsteps muffled by years of dust and neglect. The house was still, like it had been waiting for someone to disturb it. I ran my fingers along the peeling wallpaper, my skin crawling at the dampness beneath.

‚ÄúBet this place is full of ghosts,‚Äù Noah said, his voice teasing but quiet.

I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúYeah, sure. You believe in ghosts now?‚Äù

He grinned. ‚ÄúI do. But I wouldn‚Äôt need to. You‚Äôre scared enough for both of us.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am not!‚Äù I shouted, and Noah gave me the signal to hush

  He then just laughed and kept moving. Room by room, we explored‚Äîbroken furniture, old picture frames with faces too faded to make out, cabinets filled with dust and forgotten things. We found a rusted knife on the kitchen counter, its blade eaten away by time. Noah picked it up, turning it over in his hands.

‚ÄúMaybe it belonged to a murderer,‚Äù he said, waving it toward me.

‚ÄúJesus, put that down.‚Äù

He smirked, tossing it back onto the counter with a clatter. ‚ÄúRelax.‚Äù

Then we found the basement door. Noah grabbed the handle and jiggled it. Unlocked.

  He turned to me, his eyes glinting. ‚ÄúThis is where the real shit happens.‚Äù

I hesitated. The air was different here, heavier. My stomach twisted.

‚ÄúNoah, maybe we should‚Äî‚Äù

  But he was already yanking the door open. A wave of cold, damp air rushed up from below. The stairs stretched down into absolute blackness. Noah took the first step, flashlight beam bouncing along the walls. ‚ÄúYou coming, or what?‚Äù

  I swallowed hard and followed. Step by step, deeper into the dark. The smell was worse down here‚Äîthick, wet, like mold and rot and something else I couldn‚Äôt place. The air pressed against my skin, and I shivered.

‚ÄúNoah,‚Äù I whispered.

But he didn‚Äôt answer.

I swung my flashlight around.

He was gone.

Just‚Ä¶ gone.

And then‚Äî

Nothing.

I remember that much.

But as I stared at the photo, I realized something was wrong. 

I didn‚Äôt remember this picture being taken.

I don‚Äôt even remember bringing a camera that day.

And then, there was something else. In the background, behind us, there was a figure in one of the upstairs windows.

At first, I thought it was just a trick of the light‚Äîa shadow, a smudge, something explainable. But the longer I looked, the less sure I became. It was a person. A pale face, dark eyes, staring down at us.

I flipped the picture over. There was something written on the back, in faded ink. A date. July 15th, 2005.

The day Noah died.

I‚Äôve told myself that for years, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true.

The next thing I remember is running home, my arms scraped up, my shirt torn, my breath hitching in my chest. My mom grabbing my shoulders, shaking me, asking‚Äî""Where‚Äôs Noah? Where is he?!""

But I didn‚Äôt know.

I didn‚Äôt know.

The police found his body two days later, deep in the basement of that house.

A tragedy.

That‚Äôs what they called it.

But sometimes, late at night, I wonder. 

I dream about that house. About walking down those rotting stairs, the air thick and stale, the darkness pressing in. I dream about Noah‚Äôs face, pale and wide-eyed, his mouth open like he‚Äôs trying to scream.

And in my dreams, I‚Äôm standing over him.

Watching.

I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm dreaming about it again. I haven‚Äôt thought about it for years. But it‚Äôs been getting worse, these last few nights. The dreams. The whispers.

It‚Äôs like I can feel something watching me when I wake up. The air is different somehow, thick with a presence I can‚Äôt explain. I check the apartment, even though I know it‚Äôs just me. I‚Äôve never been the type to jump at noises, but these days, even the smallest sound gets under my skin.

A tap at the window. The floor creaking in the hallway.

But it‚Äôs not just the noises. It‚Äôs the feeling.

It‚Äôs like something‚Äôs waiting for me to figure it out, like I‚Äôm on the verge of remembering something. And maybe that‚Äôs why I went digging in the first place. Maybe I wanted to find some kind of closure. Maybe I thought finding Noah‚Äôs picture would bring me peace.

Instead, it only brought more questions. 

I burned the photograph.

I don‚Äôt know why. Maybe I was scared of what it meant.

But it didn‚Äôt change anything.

Because last night, I woke up to something whispering my name.

When you ask for a coffee (any style) and, in return, they ask if you want a ""double shot"" (upselling), it would help to know if they are using 7g, 14g, 18g or whatever for their single shot and what they are using for their double shot (a single large basket shot, which is uncommon in my experience) or they actually pull two shots. Or horror of horror, they just run the extraction longer on a single shot!

I don't ask (LOL, and I part own two speciality coffee shops) and maybe I should. It makes a difference.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Transforming your kitchen into a cozy haven of charm is easier than you might think. Cottage home decor is all about warmth, nature, and a sense of nostalgia. Embracing this style in your kitchen can result in a welcoming space where you enjoy cooking and entertaining. Here are some key elements you should consider as you embark on this transformation.

### Natural Materials

Cottage home decor thrives on the use of natural materials. Think about incorporating wood, stone, and ceramics to create an earthy feel. Elements you can include are:

- **Wooden Cabinets:** Opt for distressed or painted wooden cabinets. Light colors like white, cream, or pastels work well to enhance a tranquil atmosphere.
- **Stone Accents:** Consider using stone countertops or a stone backsplash. Pebbled tiles can introduce a rustic yet stylish look.
- **Ceramic Dishes:** Use handmade ceramic dishes that feature floral or nature-inspired designs. Display them on open shelves for a touch of elegance.

### Soft Color Palette

The colors you choose play a significant role in cottage decor. Soft and muted tones create a serene environment. Here are some color choice tips:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/cottage-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Pastels:** Light shades of blue, green, or pink can evoke a fresh ambiance in your kitchen.
- **Neutral Colors:** Creams and beiges can serve as a great backdrop. They allow for flexibility in adding colorful accessories.
- **Nature-inspired Tones:** greens and browns can connect the indoor space with the outdoor beauty.

### Charming Accessories

Accessories in cottage decor can make a huge difference in how inviting your kitchen feels. Consider adding the following:

- **Vintage Utensils:** Use old wooden spoons, tin measuring cups, or iron cookware as decorative pieces.
- **Textiles:** Add lace curtains or checkered tablecloths. Pillows on kitchen chairs can also add comfort and style.
- **Wall Art:** Hang framed botanical prints or family photos. These personal touches create a story in your kitchen space.

### Functional and Aesthetic Furniture

Your kitchen furniture should offer both functionality and aesthetic appeal. Consider these options:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/cottage-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Farmhouse Table:** A large wooden table can be the heart of your kitchen. It invites family gatherings and meals enjoyed together.
- **Open Shelving:** Rather than traditional cabinets, open shelves can display your favorite kitchenware and decorative pieces.
- **Comfortable Seating:** Choose rustic stools or chairs with soft cushions to create an inviting dining atmosphere.

### Lighting that Softens

Lighting is often an underestimated aspect of cottage decor. It can create a warm and friendly vibe. Here are some lighting ideas:

- **Natural Light:** Maximize windows to let in plenty of sunlight. Use sheer window treatments to allow light while maintaining privacy.
- **Warm Fixtures:** Choose pendant lights with a rustic touch. Iron or brass finishes can enhance the cottage feel dramatically.
- **Soft Bulbs:** Opt for warm-toned light bulbs. This creates a cozy atmosphere perfect for late-night cooking sessions.

Don‚Äôt forget to inject your personality into your kitchen. Cottage home decor allows for creativity, so go ahead and mix and match your cherished pieces. Remember that the essence of this style is about comfort and storytelling. With these elements in mind, you can create a kitchen that not only looks beautiful but feels like home.

The Benefits of Embracing Cottage Style in Your Cooking Space
-------------------------------------------------------------

Transforming your cooking space into a cottage-style haven can bring warmth and charm to your home. This design trend draws inspiration from rustic homes in the countryside, emphasizing comfort, nostalgia, and a love for nature. By embracing cottage style in your kitchen, you'll not only create a visually appealing environment but also enhance the overall cooking experience. Let's explore how this style can benefit you.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/cottage-home-decor-kitchen  
  
### Welcoming Atmosphere

One of the key benefits of cottage home decor in your kitchen is the inviting atmosphere it creates. The use of soft colors, natural materials, and vintage accents helps to cultivate a cozy feel. Imagine stepping into a kitchen that feels like a warm hug after a long day. You can achieve this with:

- **Soft pastels:** Light blues, greens, and yellows can make the space feel open and airy.
- **Natural wood finishes:** Unfinished or weathered wood adds texture and warmth.
- **Floral patterns:** textiles with floral designs can enhance the cottage vibe.

### Functional Design

Cottage-style kitchens prioritize functionality without sacrificing style. Whether you're whipping up a quick breakfast or preparing a festive feast, practicality plays a pivotal role. This design emphasizes the use of open shelves, which not only display your dishware but also encourage you to keep things organized. Consider these features for a functional, cottage-inspired kitchen:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/cottage-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Rustic farmhouse sinks:** These sinks are both stylish and handy for washing large pots and pans.
- **Vintage-inspired appliances:** Opt for appliances that blend old-world charm with modern technology.
- **ample counter space:** Clear counter spaces help you move around freely while cooking.

### Connection to Nature

Connecting your cooking space to nature is a vital element of cottage home decor. Natural elements not only improve aesthetics but also promote a sense of tranquility. You can bring the outdoors in by:

- **houseplants:** Choose easy-care plants like herbs that can be used in your cooking.
- **Using natural materials:** Incorporate stone, wood, and metal elements to echo the beauty of nature.
- **Maximizing natural light:** Use sheer curtains to let in sunlight, creating a bright and cheerful environment.

### Personal Touches

Cottage style encourages you to showcase your personality through decor. Adding unique, personal touches can make the kitchen feel truly your own. Consider displaying:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/cottage-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Family heirlooms:** Vintage dishware or utensils passed down through generations can tell your family‚Äôs story.
- **Fun artwork:** Hang paintings or prints that reflect your interests and style.
- **Personalized accessories:** Items like custom cutting boards or unique spice jars can add character.

### Sense of Community

Cottage kitchens often serve as the heart of the home, inviting family and friends to gather. Fostering this sense of community can transform your kitchen into a lively space for social interactions. You can incorporate this idea by:

- **Creating seating areas:** Add a breakfast nook or cozy stools around a kitchen island.
- **Showcasing culinary projects:** Invite your loved ones to help with cooking or baking, turning meal prep into a fun event.
- **Encouraging conversation:** Design the layout to allow easy flow between the cooking area and the seating space.

Embracing cottage home decor in your kitchen fosters an environment that is warm, functional, and inviting. By incorporating soft colors, natural elements, and a personal touch, you'll not only elevate the aesthetics of your space but also enhance the cooking experience. This charming style encourages you to connect with your loved ones, enjoy meals together, and create lasting memories in the heart of your home.

### Conclusion

Embracing cottage home decor in your kitchen is more than just a style choice; it‚Äôs an invitation to create a warm, welcoming atmosphere that encourages gathering and enjoyment. By transforming your kitchen with key elements like soft color palettes, vintage touches, and natural materials, you can design a space that feels cozy and lived-in. These elements not only enhance the beauty of your kitchen but also reflect a lifestyle that values comfort and simplicity.

I can't even get a reply to most coffee chat messages.

Instead, especially because as a freelancer I previously created similar plans for small businesses, I'm looking to send a marketing content plan to a few roles I actually like and then directly either attach or message people in the department with this plan. Edit: Each plan includes directly relevant samples from my portfolio.

For people saying that this is too much work, I have tried the traditional way of sending in 500+ applications and it just doesn't help me stand out whatsoever or sell my value.

**I just have a few questions related to this:**

\-As a marketing manager, especially if you're involved in the hiring process, would you see it is a positive that someone for an entry-level role makes such a plan? Any other ideas on how I can stand out. Again in my particular job market, even with ATS tailoring, the chance of even having your resume read otherwise is low, because there are just **that many** people sending in applications.

\-How much do graphics and visuals matter vs information. The thing is I have quite a bit of information I would like to write for but does it matter what the presentation itself looks like? Is a word document also OK

\-I know marketing plans are different for each type of company, but what would you absolutely expect to see in each marketing plan and how far in detail should I go? Especially given it's for more entry level roles? I want to show a solid understanding of the company but I don't want to seem like a know it all, who isn't going to follow directions either.

\-Is there any way to capture in a Linkedin or email message, the fact that this **isn't** one of those AI generated ""please look at my resume"" emails or messages?",2,1738659254.0,AskMarketing,1,1.0,False

Have any of you had trouble with customer service? I have a faulty unit, which i reported to Xbloom on the 13th of January, after using it for 69 consecutive days. 
I got in contact with customer service, and they followed up the next day,  by asking questions, which I already answered in my initial email, describing the problem. 

After answering their questions over a few days, xbloom wanted to send me a replacement. It's been almost 2 weeks, but UPS still haven't received anything. I sent an email to Xbloom last week asking about it, and got a reply that customer service would ask their warehouse about it. 
I sent a followup asking for an update, no reply to that yet. 

I realise xbloom is a small startup, and I am fine with some wait time, but this seems excessive, no? 3 weeks with 15 emails back and forth, yet still no solution.

From there we would message eachother, send memes, and get to know eachother. It seemed like our humor was similar and so was our interests so I didn‚Äôt hesitate to ask her on a coffee date. She responded in a way that wasn‚Äôt a yes or no answer. I wasn‚Äôt too bummed though, and we continued talking, even instagram video chatting moving forward. 

I eventually got her phone number and would text her and FaceTime her often. That‚Äôs all we would do is work and then FaceTime for hours on end. It was great getting to know this girl and at one point, she confessed saying that she was developing feelings for me and would love to get to know me more. With how much we shared and talked to each other, I reciprocated, and told her I felt the same way and haven‚Äôt felt this way about someone in a while. However, I told her that texting and FaceTiming to me felt superficial and that I was not looking for a pen pal. Relationships are built in person. She responded that it takes a long time for herself to trust being around new people and that she is a very nervous person meeting new people for the first time, that it gives her bad anxiety. 

A couple more weeks go by and, nevertheless, we set up a time and place for a date. A Friday evening at my place after work. I was really excited to meet this person, but when the time came, she made an excuse, stating that she was too tired, and that work really wore her out. Also, she was very nervous and had anxiety.

Whatever, I thought. Benefit of the doubt. Maybe she is a very nervous person and has very bad anxiety? I want to respect her, and not be too pushy. Especially if she is feeling this way. 

The next day, she asks if I‚Äôd like to walk her dog with her. I excitingly oblige. I would love to drive 40 minutes to her house and meet her more than anything. Then she calls me and asks if she should walk her dog first and come to my place after? Ok, fine. I‚Äôm ok with that too. Then she texts again and asks if she‚Äôd like to meet up in the middle and see a movie? 

Alright. Now at this point I‚Äôm getting pretty irritated. I‚Äôm personally not a fan when the plans keep changing and now, at this point, I‚Äôm preparing for the worst. But, again, I say yes, I‚Äôm ok with doing that. I ask her which movie she‚Äôd like to see. By this time, we only had very little options left, and it was nearing around 9 or 10pm. Then she says, ya know? Never mind. Maybe we can plan for another day. 

Now I‚Äôm beyond irritated. Not even mad, actually. But‚Ä¶ hurt? She asks if I am mad and I tell her I am hurt because I feel blown off. Like, I‚Äôm not mad at the fact I didn‚Äôt get to meet her. I am upset and hurt that she blew me off. To me it felt like she had no intention on really meeting me. Hours go by before we talk about what happened on FaceTime. We makeup after she apologies and states that she felt too embarrassed to talk right away. That she again, was too nervous and anxious to leave her home and meet me. Also, her best friend was having a bad day, so she had to comfort her. I sleep on it. 

I wake up the next morning and tell her that actually, I‚Äôd rather not talk to her anymore, that I was left with a pretty bad taste in my mouth related to the night before. She says she understands, and she appreciates me telling her that I was no longer going to be contacting her. 

I can‚Äôt help but feel like I was used as an orbiter. An option. Someone to talk to, someone‚Äôs pen pal. I feel like if she really wanted to make things work, and if she really said what was true (liking me, wanting to get to know me more, etc.) she would have made it happen. How can someone say those things and not genuinely mean them? She‚Äôs tried reaching out with texts and FaceTimes but I have given the cold shoulder. I don‚Äôt want to stoop down to her level and play games. 

On the contrary, I feel pretty bad because what if she is just a very nervous person, someone with very, very bad anxiety? 

I‚Äôm super hurt and I honestly don‚Äôt know why. I‚Äôve broken up with numerous women before. The dating life is nothing new to me. I just can‚Äôt get over it and I feel like shit. This one stings for some reason. I realize I can play ‚Äúwhat-ifs‚Äù in my mind all day and nothing will change. 

I just wonder if I did end things too early and I was too pushy or if I was being strung along and used as someone‚Äôs entertainment? 


TLDR: girl messages me on instagram, text and FaceTime each other for hours on end, we get to know eachother over nearly a month, catch feelings for each other, but blows me off 2 dates in a row due to her anxiety and nervousness. I‚Äôm still hurt and unsure if I did the right thing by telling her I don‚Äôt want to speak to her again ",1,1738658548.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

1ihdb52,https://www.reddit.com/r/FellowProducts/comments/1ihdb52/aiden_brew_profile_suggestion/,Aiden brew profile suggestion,"Hi all. Long time lurker, first time poster. 

I just got some lovely Costa Rican beans (washed) from a local roaster. 

The roaster includes a suggested V60 recipe with the beans (below). I‚Äôld love some help translating this v60 recipe to an Aiden brew profile - because I believe the way the Aiden extracts is more efficient than a hand pour and thought the original recipe might need tweaking. 

English:Quantities: Coffee 20gr. Water 330gr Grinding: 23 clicks on Commander Water: 60-80 tds

Temperature at 92 degrees.

Recipe time: Between 3:30min and 4:45min.

Recommendation: Once the coffee is prepared, stir the jug vigorously to oxygenate the drink and lower the temperature.

Pre-infusion: add 40/60 gr of water and wait 45 seconds.

1st pour: reach 150gr of water, make circular movements, from greater to lesser turbulence. Final flow of the pour thin and without breaking the surface.

2nd pour: with the V60 almost empty, pour up to 250gr. If the cone is very full, shake it to settle the bed.

3rd pour: once empty, fill up to 330gr.

You will highlight the acidity, achieve a light body and bring out the most elegant part of the coffee.

1ihd95u,https://www.reddit.com/r/snorkeling/comments/1ihd95u/the_swimming_lessons_are_1000_worth_it/,The swimming lessons are 1000% worth it!!!,"I didn't grow up near the oceans and no one taught me how to swim as a kid, but I'm very athletic. Most of my sports/hobbies now, I learned as an adult.


What made me decide to learn how to swim was my holiday trips to islands in Asia. My first snorkeling experience, we were at a giant clams sanctuary and I was wearing a life vest.

It was breathtaking. That was my 1st encounter of sea life in open deep waters. They were so gigantic, You can see them from the surface and there were also big ones near the shore. I even touched one (sorry, I was carried away) To top it off, we only paid about $2/person. Yes that's right $2, cheaper than your coffee!

Then last year, I went snorkeling again with my family, this time I saw lots of corals, fish, I even saw Dory and my gosh this island was full of big sea urchins. All that time I couldn't get closer even if I wanted to.

That's why 3 weeks ago I registered for swimming classes. It's supposed to be a group lesson but I lucked out and was the only one in class. That's why I progressed so fast and since we already tackled all the strokes, she gave me lessons more advanced, such as diving and swimming underwater.

With just seven classes under my belt, I changed from someone who used swim fins on deep pools to keep afloat to someone who can swim confidently at any depth without any PFD. I am no longer afraid to go in the deep end. Swimming in deep waters seem natural now.

From someone who can only swim on the surface, to someone who can now touch the floor of the pool. I have also started diving just on the dive tank. Best of all the 45 min sessions only cost me $20! Can't wait to do another sea exploration

I've a food dehydrator so I dehydrate a bag of frozen strawberry slices, then I grind them to a fine powder in a coffee grinder (used specifically for fish food), I then grind up two bags of freeze dried shrimp (Asian grocers), I use the ratio of 4:1 water to powder to bring the water to a boil in a large saucepan with Agar powder (Asian grocer) which is a plant based thickener like gelatin. When the powder activates (up to ten minutes) I add the powder with a small tin of crab meat, turn off the heat and stir in to get a thick consistency. Pour it out into a deep tray to cool and set (overnight) then slice it up into decent size chunks to be put into small freezer bags for freezing. 

They go mad for it and because it's soft (when thawed) they really dig into it and it's kind for their barbels too.  I also concoct more green recipes for my plecos too.",2,1738658127.0,loaches,0,1.0,False

With eris giving up her spot in the hive pantheon and xivu cut off from her throne and oryx dead and savathun no longer collecting tithe for her worm:

who are the hive tithing to right now? I know there are some hive still secretly tithing to oryx worm but I would assume that most of the hive that aren't lucent brood are still tithing to xivu arath

But my understanding is that the top end of the tithing system is the ability to have a throne world (and more tithe = bigger/more powerfull court) and since xivu cannot access her throne right now like, what is she even doing with all this tithe?

Could we see a lesser hive god trying to cleave their own throne and subjugate xivu? Or does tithe without a throne just equal raw power/ascendant magic?

I know we'll probably get answers to some of this but im not sure if my baseline undersranding of hive tithe is even correct going into the season so pls correct me if i am wrong :)

These kind of brews taste nice but take a huge dose to compensate for the underextraction of a smaller ratio. 

I used Kapi Kottai's Kuriniji (Med-Light Roast) for this. I wanted the florals to come through in this brew. 

So what I tried in this recipe which requires way too much effort is that I put a nice aeropress brew (use any 1:15 recipe that you want) in an ice bath with some salt (to slow the melt of ice) and covered the brew with a lid to prevent too much exposure to air. 

I used a stainless steel mug to make cooling more efficient. Do not try with glass carafe. 

After 10-15 minutes when the brew was very cold, I put in 4-5 ice cubes, stirred it and then removed most of the ice cubes. 

And there you have it, an iced coffee which is strong, completely balanced and very delicate and floral. 

This was first try and I'll definitely make it again with the only improvement being that I'll updose by 1gm for an even stronger cup, but that will vary from coffee to coffee. ",1,1738657672.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

Let‚Äôs talk about something that‚Äôll save your inbox from drowning in *‚ÄúCan you add \[insert obscure indie film here\]?‚Äù* requests. Meet [Overseer](https://overseerr.dev/) (formerly Ombi) ‚Äì the app that turns you from ‚Äúplex admin‚Äù to ‚Äúmedia wizard‚Äù without handing over your entire life‚Äôs work to your cousin‚Äôs boyfriend who just *has* to watch *Die Hard 7* at 3 AM.

https://preview.redd.it/ccdnrf1413he1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=678c229e8593d46225676afd426b5d2574ef98a2

# What the Heck is Overseer?

Imagine this: Your cousin messages you at 2 AM asking for that one anime series from 2003 that‚Äôs only available on VHS in Estonia. Instead of groaning, you send them a link to Overseer. They search, click *‚ÄúRequest,‚Äù* and voil√†‚Äîyour automation tools (Sonarr/Radarr) handle the rest. No more gatekeeping your Plex login!

It‚Äôs basically a **request portal** that lets users ask for movies, shows, or music, while you keep control over what gets added. Think of it as a velvet rope for your seedbox-powered media empire. üé©

# Why You‚Äôll Want to Hug Overseer

* **No more Discord DMs titled** ***‚ÄúURGENT: NEED THIS MOVIE FOR TONIGHT‚ÄôS PARTY PLZ‚Äù*** **üò§** Users get a clean, Netflix-like interface to search and request stuff. *Bless.*
* **Automagic Integration** Overseer talks directly to Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, and your media server (Plex/Jellyfin/Emby). Set it and forget it.
* **Play Gatekeeper (In a Nice Way)** Want to approve requests before they flood your 500GB seedbox? Enable admin approvals. *‚ÄúSorry Karen, ‚ÄòBee Movie 2‚Äô isn‚Äôt real‚Ä¶ yet.‚Äù*
* **Flex Your Inner Designer** Customize the UI with themes so your Overseer doesn‚Äôt look like a spreadsheet. Neon gradients? Why not.
* **Notifications That Don‚Äôt Suck** Tag users on Discord or send emails when their request is ready. Watch them marvel at your godlike efficiency.

# How to Set It Up Without Losing Your Mind

Here‚Äôs the **TL;DR for setup nerds** (you know who you are):

1. **Docker? Docker.** Most seedboxes support Docker. Run this (adjust paths, you chaos gremlin):*(Yes, it‚Äôs that simple. No, you don‚Äôt need to compile anything.)*docker run -d --name overseer -p 5000:5000 -v /path/to/config:/config --restart unless-stopped overseer/overseer 
2. **Connect the Dots** Plug in your Sonarr/Radarr/Plex details. Pro tip: Use API keys, not your password. *Trust me.*
3. **Lock It Down** Slap a reverse proxy (NGINX, Caddy) and HTTPS on it. Your seedbox might even do this for you.
4. **Send the Link** Share something like [`requests.yourdomain.com`](http://requests.yourdomain.com) and watch your friends act like you invented fire.

# Avoid These Facepalms

* **Seedbox Storage Anxiety**: Overseer doesn‚Äôt know your seedbox has 2TB, not 20TB. Set auto-delete rules.
* **That One Friend**: Use IP whitelisting or a VPN. *Looking at you, Dave, who keeps requesting 4K cat videos.*
* **Backup Your Config**: Because losing your Overseer setup feels like dropping your ice cream cone.

# Alternatives if Overseer Isn‚Äôt Your Vibe

* **Jellyseerr**: For Jellyfin/Emby stans.
* **Petio**: Pretty, but fewer features. Like the ‚Äúminimalist‚Äù friend who owns one plant.
* **Ombi**: Overseer‚Äôs OG ancestor. Still works, but Overseer‚Äôs got more bling.

# Final Roast

Overseer is the duct tape holding my sanity together when sharing my Plex server. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it beats waking up to 15 ‚ÄúCAN YOU ADD THIS‚Äù texts before coffee. ‚òï

**Over to you, squad:**

* Already using Overseer? Drop your favorite tweaks!
* Got a horror story about pre-Overseer life? *We‚Äôll laugh (and cry) with you.*

The high cliffs on one side and the waters of the Atlantic on the other make this small town a very attractive place for a wide range of activities or simply for enjoying the striking contrasts and endless natural charm of its surroundings.*

*The cultivation terraces that cut into the mountain slopes, the curious rock formations that give rise to incredible natural pools, the paths that wind their way through forests and waterfalls‚Ä¶discover this idyllic corner of Madeira and enjoy the vibrant nature of a magical island.*

*Back in the village, one of the highlights Seixal has to offer is undoubtedly its beautiful natural pools. Created by small dykes of volcanic rock, some natural and some artificial, which retain the water that enters at high tide, these crystal clear pools are a lovely place to take a dip or simply enjoy the beauty of the surroundings. You‚Äôre free to come here as you wish and it doesn‚Äôt cost a thing. It‚Äôs easy to get here without any problems at all and while there are some amenities for visitors, there are no lifeguards, so you should take care in this area.*

*The largest one is located next to the port of Seixal and offers a range of services around it, from parking and toilets to a bar and restaurant that acts a bit like a beach club. Two more pools, known as Po√ßa das Lesmas (don‚Äôt miss its spectacular stone arch) and Po√ßa do Mata Sete, are located in the Ribera da Laje area. The curious rock formations of this corner of volcanic origin and the turbulent waters of the sea crashing against the coast, which contrast with the peaceful bodies of water of the pools themselves, make them a truly magical place.*

*On the north coast of the island of Madeira, there is a place known for its unique beauty. Porto de Abrigo do Seixal beach, also known simply as Seixal Beach, is an authentic living postcard. As such, its landscape has conquered sea, nature and, of course, photography lovers.*

*The scenery is painted in harmonious tones: a black sand beach bathed by the Atlantic and sheltered by escarpments and green mountains. This place therefore looks like a green amphitheatre, offering bathers a peaceful atmosphere.*

1ihcy8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightGainWarriors/comments/1ihcy8j/hardgainer_struggles_why_eating_more_isnt_the/,Hardgainer Struggles: Why Eating More Isn't the Only Solution,"For anyone who's ever struggled to gain weight, you've probably heard the phrase **""just eat more""** a thousand times. And technically, it's not wrong‚Äî**CICO (calories in vs. calories out) is a real physiological law.** But let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîif gaining weight were as simple as knowing the formula, there wouldn't be so many of us struggling with it.

Here‚Äôs the thing: **CICO is real, but it‚Äôs not the whole story.** It doesn‚Äôt account for the psychology, emotions, and habits that affect our ability to eat in a surplus. It doesn‚Äôt consider things like:

* **Lack of knowledge:** If you don‚Äôt know how to structure your diet to make eating easier, hitting a surplus will always feel like a battle.
* **Disconnection from hunger signals:** Many chronic undereaters or ""hard gainers"" don‚Äôt even *feel* hungry in the way most people do.
* **Emotional blocks:** Some people subconsciously restrict themselves due to **self-worth issues**‚Äîfeeling like they don‚Äôt deserve to take up more space or struggling with body image fears.
* **Lifestyle mismatches:** Maybe you have a **high-energy job**, an intense training schedule, or you're just vastly underestimating how much you burn daily.

The real work is **not just knowing CICO‚Äîit‚Äôs asking WHY you aren‚Äôt eating in a surplus.**

# Breaking the ""Hardgainer"" Mindset

For years, I identified as a **hardgainer**‚Äîsomeone who just ""couldn‚Äôt gain weight no matter what."" But in reality, I was caught in a **Cycle of Smallness**‚Äîa belief system that kept me stuck in habits that sabotaged my progress.

Here are just a few behaviors that were keeping me small:  
üëâ **Drinking coffee first thing in the morning** (appetite suppressant)  
üëâ **Skipping breakfast or delaying meals for hours**  
üëâ **Trying to eat too ‚Äúclean,‚Äù avoiding fats like butter, cheese, whole milk, and fatty meats**  
üëâ **Not wanting to gain any body fat, yet expecting muscle growth** (unrealistic!)  
üëâ **Labeling myself as a ""hardgainer""‚Äîwhich only reinforced my own struggles**

When I started identifying these self-imposed limitations, I was able to **replace them with behaviors that actually aligned with my goal** of gaining weight:  
‚úî **Eating a proper breakfast instead of ""waiting for hunger""**  
‚úî **Adding calorie-dense foods that I had avoided for years** (butter, whole milk, fatty meats, cheese)  
‚úî **Letting go of the obsession with ‚Äúeating clean‚Äù and focusing on eating WELL**  
‚úî **Ditching the ""hardgainer"" label and treating weight gain as a skill to develop‚Äînot an identity to cling to**

# You Are Not a Hardgainer‚ÄîYou Just Have Hardgainer Habits

When I finally put on **over 10kg of mass** and had **zero issues maintaining it**, I realized something:

The **hardgainer label isn‚Äôt a biological prison‚Äîit‚Äôs a collection of habits and mindsets** that keep you stuck.

If you‚Äôve been struggling to gain weight, ask yourself: **Are you truly a hardgainer, or are you just engaging in hardgainer behaviors?**

It‚Äôs time to drop the label and start identifying the real barriers holding you back. What‚Äôs ONE behavior you can change today that will move you closer to your goal?

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.
I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but Ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-34 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred
