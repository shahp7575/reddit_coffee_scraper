I’m in a seat against the wall, far away from the desk and not thinking anything of it I popped a bite size snickers in my mouth. Two ladies from the front desk b-lined over to me with a no eating sign and told me that I need to leave if I want to eat. 

The lady next to me was reorganizing her carry on, pulled out a bag of Doritos and the same thing happened. The chips weren’t open but they had her put them up. 

The lounge is on the lower level and away from the chaos so it’s a plus but definitely eat before you come if you’re hungry.

“Wha-“, I jolted upwards in bed, letting out a gasp that was more like a breath of air being sucked down.

I woke up twenty minutes later than usual. Most days, I’m already out of bed before my alarm even goes off, but today was different—*I was just exhausted*.

“Great,” I groaned, fumbling to silence the alarm that had been blaring for God knows how long.

I dragged myself out of bed, starting my morning ritual—the same routine I’ve followed almost every day for over a decade now: shit, shower, shave, coffee. As I was getting dressed for work, my phone *buzzed* with a text from my supervisor, Trevor.

“*Meet*.”

That was it—just one word, as vague as ever. But I knew better than to expect anything good from it. The last time I’d received one of Trevor’s cryptic “*meet*” messages, it had led to a tirade of a staff meeting about supposed missed deadlines caused by ‘*recent budget cuts’*. He tore into us hard, and the silence afterward was deafening. I’d felt like a failure that day—until Amanda, one of the chief financial officers and a work friend, quietly reassured me that we’d been ahead of schedule.

Still, Trevor’s tirade left a sour taste.  So much so, I stopped trusting him.

As I headed out the door, another text came in—this time from my wife, Brenna:

“*Good morning, sleepyhead! Had to leave early :( Things are crazy at the hospital rn. Thinking of grabbing steak tonight at Billy’s. You in*?”

I smiled at her message; the thought of a date night lifted my spirits. Maybe today won’t be so bad after all.

“*Sounds like a date ;) Good morning to you too. I love you and can’t wait to see you later*,” I replied before starting my car.

As my engine warmed up, I took a sip of my coffee, enjoying the rare sunshine peeking through the grey Midwest sky. The weather around here is usually bleak—overcast skies, freezing temperatures, and constant rain, the usual. But today, the sunshine felt like a gift. With good weather appearing imminent, a steak dinner date tonight, and Brenna’s beautiful face on my mind, I let myself believe.

*Nothing could ruin this, not even Trevor.*

I pulled out of the driveway and heard a *ding* notification ring from my phone. I presumed it was Brenna replying.

The drive to work, as usual, was long and uneventful—thirty-five minutes of alternating between civilization and isolation. The first ten minutes took me through Fredtown, the town in which I resided. The remaining twenty-five minutes were spent on a winding road cutting through the dense wilderness, with nothing but pine trees and silence for company.

Fredtown itself was... ‘*unique*’. The city was dominated by federal employees—military personnel, high-level researchers, and even agents from organizations we couldn’t even begin to guess. Crime here was laughably low too. The common running joke amongst townspeople was that jaywalking could land you in federal prison.

I made my way to the edge of town before continuing onward into the scenic part of my drive. Though beautiful, the forest had an eerie quality, especially at night here. Maybe it was just my nerves, but I always felt like something was watching me the closer I got to work.

As I approached my destination, the forest opened up, revealing the sprawling field that housed the facility. The plant stretched out about a mile or two in radius, a fortress of steel and concrete amidst the trees. I parked in my usual spot several rows back from the electrified fence that guarded this place.

This wasn’t just your *ordinary power grid*—it was the *centerpiece* of our nation’s push for groundbreaking energy solutions. From solar to experimental technologies, it has many of the revolutionary changes that you have seen within the last thirty to forty years. Everything was being developed here under the watchful eye of the Department of Energy. It was my job to oversee research and administration, but even after a decade, I still didn’t fully understand this place.

Sure, I followed orders, studied data, and ran tests they assigned me, but the bigger picture was more complicated than that. My most recent project now, for example, involved designing containment protocols for massive surges of electrical power. On the surface, it seemed practical—preventing equipment damage or accidents from occurring. But when I dug into the specifics, I realized the scale of it was absurd: the system they wanted could handle a surge powerful enough to supply energy to the entire state of California *for three million years*.

Not only was it impossible for any known capable technology we currently had to prevent that kind of surge all at once, but they *specifically* wanted it for this site.

It also seems the more I try to dig, the more I find that I cannot even access the needed information due to insufficient levels of clearance. This was concerning as I was only one position down from the Head Supervisor of this sight. All of it didn’t add up and it seems they are willing to pay us for our ignorance\*. And our ignorance they have\*.

For a moment, I sat there, letting the engine idle as I prepared mentally for my day. That’s when I remembered the text I’d received earlier. I fished my phone out of the center console, and I unlocked it. What had felt like the start of a promising day evaporated the second I saw the message. *It wasn’t Brenna*.

*The sender was an unknown number*.

“*They have escaped, you must find me*.”

My stomach dropped. Just as I was trying to process what I’d seen, another line popped up on the screen:

“*Before they kill us all*.”

Confusion joined the fear now gripping me. *What the actual fuck did I just read*?

For a few seconds, I couldn’t think straight. Was this some kind of prank? A sick joke from one of my coworkers? If it was, they’d picked the worst possible day for it.

But... what if it wasn’t a joke? And what did they mean by '*kill'*? This was a power grid, not some black-site facility. Sure, the place had its mysteries, but nothing about it screamed *serious danger*.

I shook my head, trying to rationalize it. *It’s just a prank*, I told myself, though the creeping unease of the ominous message lingered. I sat there for another minute, collecting myself once more. I glanced into the rearview mirror to adjust my hair and wipe the sweat from my face…

Something caught my eye.

*A figure*—just beyond the tree line.

I quickly snapped my head in that direction, but whatever it was... *it was gone*.

“What the-?” I mouthed looking around me now to see if there was anything else.

*What was that*? My eyes darted back to the same spot in the tree line. *Am I losing it*? I tried to rationalize what I’d seen—maybe it was security or an employee taking an ‘*unauthorized smoke break’*. But why would anyone be standing out there, just beyond the perimeter?

I took a deep breath, forcing myself to look composed in the overhead mirror. I reached into my coat pocket and took a quick swig from the flask I kept hidden. Confidence in liquid form, though it didn’t do much to calm the growing knot in my stomach. I set it in my glove compartment, as they canister only had a bit left.

As I stepped out of the car, my paranoia only intensified. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was... *wrong*.

In the reflection of my car’s side mirror, I noticed something in my peripheral view. *The figure*. This time, it stood a row back in the parking lot, still as a statue. I froze, pretending not to notice. My eyes flicked to the mirror again, trying to make out any details—but just like before, it vanished.

My heart was now beating out my chest. Every instinct screamed at me to get back in the car and drive far, far away, but I forced myself to stay calm. If anyone else saw me like this, they’d think I was high, crazy, or both.

I walked toward the facility, trying my best to act normal. My eyes darted to the mirrors of parked cars as I moved through the lot, scanning for any sign of the figure. And just like before, it only was visible in the corners of my vision.

It wasn’t following me in a conventional way either. At one glance, it was a few rows back. With another glance, it was closer—*just one row away*. Each time I looked directly at it, it was gone. For what felt like an eternity, I played this game of cat and mouse. By the time I was only twenty or so feet away from the gate, my nerves were completely shot.

Relief washed over me as I approached the entrance of the facility’s gate, the sight of armed guards offered some small measure of comfort. Randy, the old but good-natured security guard, waved me over with his usual easy smile. Randy and I were close, and I always made sure to start a conversation with him anytime I could. Today, however, I wanted to get inside as quickly as possible. I tried my best to keep up the performance.

“Hey there, boss man,” he greeted, though his expression shifted to mild concern as he noticed my uneasy demeanor. “You alright? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

I hesitated, debating whether to tell him. But what could I say? *I think I’m being stalked by a shadowy figure that doesn’t move when I look at it. Yeah, right*. Instead, I forced a weak smile and deflected. “Just some stuff at home with Brenna. Nothing I can’t handle.”

“Ah, good ole’ marriage drama. I get it,” Randy chuckled, “Just so you know, though—if I find out you’re giving her a hard time, I’ll bury your ass six feet under.” He grinned, his laugh easing some of the tension.

I smiled back, but my unwavering feeling of unease lingered.

I handed Randy my work ID, but I noticed the figure from earlier was gone. *Where did it disappear to now*? The security gate and its surroundings are generally an open area, intentionally that way too. It was only about twenty feet behind me from when I last saw him…

“You sure you alright there, boss?” Randy looked up after handing me my ID back to see me glancing back to the parking lot.

“…Yeah,” I finally spoke after a minute of gathering myself.

I waited for the gates to buzz open. As they did and I walked in, the sense of safety replaced the dread that I was feeling, knowing I would be fine in the facility. As the gate closed behind me, I glanced back one more time and saw movement from the tree line again. It had almost looked like--well maybe the fear was getting to me, but it almost looked like I could see a *couple more figures* in the tree line, sitting there before walking back and fading into the forest.

I made my way to the nearest security station, home to what we liked to call our ""*finest*."" I explained to them what I’d seen. The desk guard leaned back in his chair, unimpressed, and replied in a condescending tone, “We’ll send someone to check it out. Probably just a homeless guy or a junkie trying to camp out.”

I even showed them the messages I had received.

They reassured me nothing real would happen as, “*No one was dumb enough to try and attack federally protected property on U.S. soil, especially when it housed military personnel*”

Translation: *They won’t do anything anytime soon—if at all*.

Still, I had no better options. I wasn’t in immediate danger and my priority was to get to work. I left the security station, entered the main administrative building, and headed straight for my office.

**NEW MESSAGE ALERT**

To: ------------------------------

Time: 8:34 AM CT

*Good afternoon, Mr. (REDACTED), you have a scheduled meeting with Mr. Trevor (REDACTED) at 10:30 AM CT in Conference Room C. Please be advised: attendance at this meeting is mandatory and of high priority.*

*THIS MESSAGE IS AN AUTOMATED RESPONSE.*

The email glared across my laptop screen. I stared at it, distracted by the morning’s events playing over and over in my head like a broken record.

*No one else saw anything—not even Randy*, I thought.

I resolved to focus on work. I logged into the system and began my work: three daily safety checks of the entire grid. On a normal day, all sensors read green, signaling everything was running as expected. Occasionally though, a sensor flashed yellow or orange to indicate a minor error, which was logged and addressed by yours truly.

I then noticed sector 7-B was flashing yellow. *Perfect*, I thought. Though annoying, the problem was manageable and quick to resolve.

But then, as if fate had sensed my day wasn’t hard enough, the indicator started flashing red.

Red meant only one thing: *a serious fuck up*. It wasn’t just a problem; *it was my problem*. Red alerts always required immediate on-site attention, and usually, that meant the next twenty-four hours of my life were stuck fixing it.

I groaned, muttering a string of curses under my breath. Any hope of enjoying my night out with Brenna was now gone. I was pissed.

Still, a part of me welcomed the distraction. At least this gave me something worthwhile to focus on instead of the unsettling shit I’d seen earlier.

I left the corporate building and made the short walk over to the massive hangar that housed part of the grid. It was only about ten minutes away, but it felt a lot longer. The campus was sprawling, with four buildings dedicated to the grid and a handful of others for miscellaneous site operations.

When I reached the hangar entrance, I braced myself for what was sure to be an unpleasant encounter. Inside, I found Mike, the lead engineer—or as I often referred to him in my head, *the lead grunt*.

Mike and I didn’t exactly see eye to eye. Our relationship could best be described as… *toxically professional*. Every interaction with him felt like a test from God. He had a habit of pushing back against anything that came from administration—*especially if it came from me*.

The tension between us was fueled by our vastly different backgrounds. Mike was ex-military, a hard-ass with years of experience in various feats of engineering, which included the B-2 (though that was from the rumor mill). He considered my seven years of college a waste of time.

*His favorite line*?

“*You could’ve joined the military, learned everything faster, and fixed your shitty attitude debt free*.”

Technically, as his boss, I could’ve pulled strings to get him fired, but I’d never do it. As much as he annoyed me, Mike was damn good at his job—*one of the best*. Letting him go would’ve been a dumb, emotional move. But that didn’t stop me from occasionally finding ways to get him back, like enrolling him in HR’s behavior management classes.

“Hey, Mike,” I called out, trying to keep my tone normal, “We’ve got a red alert in 7-B.”

He glanced up from whatever he was working on and smirked, “Oh, great. Another problem. What’d you guys do this time?”

*Here we go again*, I thought, already regretting my decision to come here.

“Listen, let’s skip the formalities, you already know I’ll be stuck here for the next twenty-four hours, so don’t go busting my balls here.”

“Relax, don’t get your pretty pink panties in a twist, I already sent a couple of my best down, they’ll be back any minute now.”

Mike paused, a flicker of worry crossing his face before quickly retreating behind his usual demeanor.

“...That was a few minutes ago, and I still haven’t heard a thing,” he finally said, his tone laced with irritation rather than genuine concern.

Mike wasn’t one to care about others either, it seemed, often giving the cold shoulder and even disregarding safety for results. It was something I’d called him out on more times than I could count, but he’d always brushed it off as no big deal.

“I don’t got time for fucking around either, last thing I need is you up my ass even more than it is right now,” he mumbled, as he went back to working on his project.

I bit back my irritation, forcing a neutral tone. “I’m just the messenger, Mike. Let me know what you find when they get back.”

But even as I said it, I was already over it. His constant attitude was grating on me, and I made a mental note to send someone else next time. *Today’s already bad enough without this bullshit*, I thought.

Just as I was walking back to my office to continue on with my day, I heard it—*the sound that marked the beginning of the end.*

Coming from the distance where 7-B was housed, a scream tore through the air, distant but unmistakable. It was *raw, guttural, and filled with such primal terror* that it didn’t even seem human. It froze me in place, my blood running cold. I turned back toward Mike, who was already looking in the direction of Sector 7-B. His expression was unreadable at first, but as the seconds passed, the same fear I was feeling began to creep into his features. He tried to hide it, but it was there, undeniable.

“What the hell?” Mike muttered low and intense.

He took a step forward, then hesitated, his hand clenching into a fist. “I told them not to—” he grumbled angrily, but his words cut off as we both saw it.

Emerging from the direction of Sector 7-B was a person. At first, it was nothing more than a slow-moving silhouette, but then the smell of iron and salt hit my nostrils. I gagged and doubled over at the mere smell of it, causing my stomach to rise into my throat. I caught myself on a workbench as I held back the urge to vomit. *What was that*? The sound of shuffling feet echoed unnervingly and unrhythmic against the cold metal walls. Then, as the figure approached the overhead light that illuminated him, we saw one of the engineers Mike had sent to check the sector appeared…

*At least what was left of him*…

His body was drenched in blood, a gruesome painting of crimson streaks and gore laid out. His left arm was severed cleanly at the shoulder, while his right ended in a jagged stump where his hand should have been, oozing thick, dark fluid. Half of his jaw hung lifeless from one side of his face. Fractured bone and dangling tendons twitched in areas where it had been exposed. Below, he was disemboweled from the sternum down, his innards dragging beneath him. It was coiling around his legs as he staggered forward, nearly tripping on them. His eyes were wide, bloodshot, and glistened with terror, as if he had seen Hell for himself. He staggered forward, driven by sheer will or some desperate instinct to reach safety.

“Holy.. wh-what the fu- wha- ho-” Mike said in a quivering voice.

We just stared at the current reality unraveled before us.

Then, as if flood doors opened, the hangar exploded into chaos. Engineers screamed, scattering like startled birds, while frantic calls for medevac filled the air in the mix. I saw a few sprinting to the nearest Red Phone to place the call.

Mike snapped out of his hypnosis, rushing toward the mangled engineer.

“JESUS FUCKING- BAILEY, we need to get medevac for you, where did the others go?” his voice barely holding together as he looked up and tried calling to the other engineers, “DOES ANYONE SEE THE OTHERS?!”

He whipped around to face me, his expression a mix of terror and urgency.

“Go and get one of the guards, tell them to radio this in and to lock down the hangar” Mike barked to me as I stood there.

His voice broke my trance. I nodded and turned to run, ready to call in a *Code Purple*.

Hangar employees began to creep towards the hallway leading to Sector 7-B, their faces held with dread. A few dared to step in, their movements slow and deliberate, as if trying not to provoke something unseen.

Then a faint sound interrupted us as it drifted from deeper inside Sector 7-B—*whistling*.

But it wasn’t normal. Something was wrong with it. The tune was off, *warped, inhuman*. A haunting, disjointed version of *Yankee Doodle* echoed through the air, its cadence crawling under my skin.

The PA system kicked on with the accompaniment of red-blaring sirens buzzing throughout the place, jump-scaring everyone, including me.

The robotic voice began its repeating message.

“*This is an emergency broadcast alert, please remain calm and find a place of secure shelter. Protocol 999 will be taking place. Do not let anyone into facilities, lock all doors, and close all blinds until the conclusion of this broadcast. If you are outside, seek immediate shelter. This is an emerge*\-”

I turned back to Mike, my heart pounding in my chest. The fear in his eyes mirrored my own. And then the whistling came again—*louder* than before. It was threading its way through the screams, alarms, and the general, frantic chaos around us. The warped *Yankee Doodle* grew closer.

I grabbed Mike’s shoulder, “We need to get out of here!” I shouted, realizing whatever that was, couldn’t be good.

“Bailey is in no shape to move right now!” his voice horse and panic-stricken.

“Mike, we have to go, we can’t take him—*not like this*!”

He hesitated, torn between survival and loyalty. We both knew the truth—*Bailey was beyond saving*. Even if a medevac arrived in time, how could anyone save someone who’d been so gruesomely ripped apart like this?

Mike made his decision. He knelt beside Bailey, whispering something in his ear. I couldn’t hear the words, but I saw his lips tremble. A single tear slid down his face before he noticed me watching. He wiped it away quickly, and then stood and turned to me, his face hardening.

“Let’s go!”

I bolted towards the entrance, Mike close in pursuit. Around us, others fled in a panic, some ahead of us, others trailing behind. The chaos of the hangar spilled out into the open as we ran, but the sound of that unnatural whistling followed us, growing with every step no matter how far we ran in the opposite direction.

We made it to the entrance with no problem. As we did so, we heard more violent screams erupting from behind us. We turned back and saw limbs from various people thrown into the air. In front of us rushed armed security, military personnel, and other trained professionals responding to the incident inside.

Just then Mike turned to me, “Where are we going?”

I had no idea what to do now. To be honest, I thought about just leaving him and booking it towards my car to get the hell out of this place. However, I knew the entrance to get in or out was locked down during *Protocol 999*.

I glanced over to the gate and saw the same scene being played out as it was from behind us.

*There was no escape now*.

“Let’s head to my office” I said.

We had about a couple minutes worth of running, however, our prime years of athletic endurance were far behind us. If only I had just used that six-month membership to our local gym that work had provided for free annually…

Just as it felt like my heart would explode, I spotted somewhere to hide and pointed to Mike to rest there. We hid in the hedges, hoping the thick cover of brush would hide our location from any impending danger.

As I’m writing this, we are still hiding. I tried calling 911 and they told me to sit tight as they tried to contact federal support as they had no jurisdiction on our property. Hopefully, help would get here sooner than later.

I looked up after a moment and noticed Mike sitting there with a thousand-yard stare glued to the nearest rock he saw on the ground. His appearance sunk in sadness, instead of shock like mine. It was something I wasn’t familiar with seeing from him. After all, this guy was made of bricks, physically and emotionally.

Just as I was about to check on him, a piercing scream erupted nearby, cutting through me like a knife. Mike broke his locked gaze and whipped his head toward me. Before either of us could process what to do, more agonizing wails tore through the air behind us—*closer this time*. Ten feet, maybe less.

Then, sickening noises replaced the screams—*tearing flesh, snapping tendons, and the squelch* of something unknown happening nearby. Each sound burrowed into my brain, leaving scars I knew would never heal.

Silence fell hard. Not comforting either—it was heavy with anticipation for what would happen next. My body felt weak, trembling. We sat frozen, wide-eyed and pale. Neither of us spoke, too paralyzed to even form a thought. The bushes weren’t safe. *We had to move*.

I was about to suggest the idea when Mike seemed to make his own decision. Slowly, he leaned forward and parted the dense shrubbery, just enough to peek through. His movements were deliberate, and careful, trying to remain unseen by whatever might be out there. I watched as his expression shifted. At first, it was confusion. Then his face went entirely still, his breath caught, and he moved back while the brush fell back into place.

“What’s wrong?” I whispered just loud enough so he could hear me, but he just sat there.

Concerned I spoke up a little louder.

“Mike... Mike, you gotta talk to me here man. What’s going on out there? Is it that bad?”

Finally, he spoke, his voice eerily calm,

“*They’re watching* *us""*",1,1739839519.0,scaryjujuarmy,0,1.0,False

Hi, I'm feeling overwhelmed and trapped, and I could really use some perspective. 



My relationship with my mum has been difficult, to put it lightly. At the beginning of the year it got to the point where I told her family therapy was the only way I would be open to trying to ""resolve things"". She refused at first, but when I stuck to my boundary on that being the only way I will engage with her, she agreed she would ""if that's what it takes"" & to let her know when & where, but stated she wasn’t happy about it. When I said I needed time to think about it, she replied ""this is what you wanted, and now you need time, I give up!”

I was hesitant as since I initially proposed therapy, her emotional abuse has escalated, & I don't believe she genuinely wants to change, she just wants to regain control. 

Last year, I went low-contact with her, only arranging visits with my brothers and taking them for days out instead of going round. This wasn't sustainable & eventually I resumed visiting them at home, initially not interacting with my mum. I found out my older brother (11) was suicidal, so I fought to get him help because my mum is neglectful, avoidant & was minimizing the situation. This was retraumatizing but I'm glad I was there & advocated for him. That’s when I resumed contact, which she mistook for reconciliation. I guess I went back to pretending everything was ok, albeit more boundaried.

Conflict was reignited at the beginning of the year as she pretended she didn't see my relationship status of my first same sex relationship. She admitted it, making it about how much it hurt finding out publicly. I said I might've told her if she responded better when I came out to her, as she basically asked why I was telling her and said I don't need to go round telling everyone. She denies ever saying that, that I misunderstood, she meant something else, etc. One message she sent was ""I don't give a shit what you are"".

When I next saw my brothers, my eldest brother was telling me that my mum doesn't care that I was with my ex & questioned me in such a way that parrotted my mum & triggered an emotional flashback.

Last week, my grandad told me to meet him for a coffee, which I was correct in thinking would be about my mum. He told me he was only getting involved now as my 11 year old brother has been crying himself to sleep every night over this. Bare in mind I have been parentified & my mum has been using weaponizing my siblings and trying to guilt trip me with them.

The next day my mum messaged me saying ""grandad told me you had a chat. I understand how you feel about the family therapy but obviously neither of us has the spare money to pay for it"" (I told my grandad I expect her to pay half & would get back to her with the fee, as I found a local service with a sliding-scale. I told him I pay for my own therapy but I didn't say I couldn't afford it-not to say that I can, but I would make it work) ""I really want to discuss things with you so we can resolve the situation as I have no idea how you have come to the conclusion that I reacted badly to you coming out. I really do think it's one big misunderstanding we can resolve by talking"" (again, I've explained it's not just one situation I misunderstood that can be ""resolved"" in one conversation, when she can't even have a healthy conversation via text) ""Therefore I was wondering if you would be willing to meet up on your terms. You say the time & place & if you feel more comfortable you are welcome to bring a friend along for support. I really don't want to argue with you, I just want the chance to sort this out."" 

I think that message speaks for itself. The gaslighting has also began to make me question my memory, but I'm trying to remind myself that it's not just about that, it's our entire relationship, the emotional neglect, invalidation, gaslighting, entitlement, contempt.

A couple days later my older brother phoned me up & confided in me that he's upset that me & my mum aren't ""friends"". We were on the phone for half an hour & it consisted of him asking why we fell out, asking to know at least one reason why, saying he needs to know why so he knows why he's crying every night, suggesting we go for a coffee with my mum to try to sort it out, etc. He doesn't take no for an answer & pushes boundaries, which I find incredibly difficult. I hate that he's now parentified. I hate that my mum told them her narrative (which I told her was inappropriate, & she obviously didn't respond well too). I hate that I'm causing the pain. I can't explain how much that conversation broke my heart.

Since my mum messaged, & I had that conversation with my brother, I'm wondering if I should just try to go back to being friendly & pretending everything is fine, as the pain, pushback & pressure I'm causing is unbearable.

I feel powerless and destabilized by her pattern of denial and gaslighting. Every time I seem to stabilize, & my therapy sessions aren't taken over by processing ongoing trauma, something with her knocks me back into the cycle. I’ve lost most of my support system and now only have one close friend and my therapist. 

I feel like I'm at one of the lowest points in my life, it feels like everything is falling apart & it's all my fault, even though I know my needs matter too.

But I notice something, that is I don't even check my Nokia or pick it up at all. 

I wonder if carrying a dumbphone is even necessary for me. Or is it just the point of the dumbphone? Is to not even check it ? Don't get me wrong as sometime I still pick it up to check the time, but lol I can just wear my watch.

I could get a monthly pass with that instead!""

It also helps me feel more comfortable spending on this game because of where I've saved money here and there.

Saving money has been a strange side effect this game has had in my life. I haven't seen my credit card statement this low for a while. 😂

He glances across the room to the heavy iron chest, locked and warded.

After finishing his coffee-tea he steps outside and takes a deep breath, and exhales. The sun is up. The birds are singing. Somewhere a Warlock Knight is chasing down a rogue wizard who just turned a market stall into a swarm of cheese eating butterflies. It's going to be to a good day!

If car-less people want to come over and grab coffee too, that's great but maybe best to avoid soliciting rides from strangers? I don't know, suggestions and thoughts are very much welcome!

At this point, I’m just seeing if there’s interest. If enough people are keen, we could figure out a weekly schedule. I am aware there is the Daikanyama t-site that organizes a themed gathering almost every Sunday but this one could be more open and generic.

Back in 2017, I got into a relationship with a girl I knew at college. She was my best friend before and during the relationship, but unfortunately everything just came to quite an abrupt end, we broke up and have never spoken again.

There’s a much longer story to it, but there isn’t a day goes by that I don’t think about her. So be it we didn’t make a relationship work, but I have always missed the friendship we shared.

Occasionally, I’ve been having dreams where we meet up and bump into each other for the first time in years. We’re always both so happy to see each other and will lay down together and catch up, or sit in a coffee shop/restaurant and catch up. 

I’d have just naturally thought that it’s just my brain missing her, which it could very much be. But also a while back, I had what I think was a visitation dream from my grandparents. 

My grandad passed away in 2017 and my grandma is still alive but in late stage dementia. I had a dream I was with them both, in their house like nothing had happened over the last eight years, it was so warm and comforting. My grandad was sat in his chair and my grandma was in and out of the room chatting, which gave me this theory that my grandma’s soul, dementia free, was visiting me and trying to comfort me. Following that dream a few days later, I had another comforting dream where I bumped into my ex girlfriend in a restaurant, in which I started to wonder if I was visiting another dimension in my dreams and souls were trying to connect.

I wondered if myself and my ex girlfriend are still really close friends in the spirit world, or if this is even possible? I’ve been in a long term relationship with somebody else now for a long time but I do take comfort with the ideology I can still connect/be friends with my ex girlfriend?

I had a 3 day weekend and haven’t been able to get off the couch (other than to switch over to my bed) to do literally anything. I have all these plans, I write down the steps in my planner, and I pray that I find an ounce of energy to start but nothing ever gets done. I haven’t showered, washed my face, brushed my teeth, ate a meal…days. It’s been days. But this is sadly a norm for me. I can sleep 18 hours EASY. No amount of sleep ever helps. 

My apartment is filth. I have 2 cats so it’s even worse. I haven’t done laundry in 4 months and have run out of clean clothes so when I can manage to shower i’ll bring some clothes in with me and wash them while i’m showering. And it’s mostly just small items like underwear and socks, everything else I just spray down with body spray/perfume. It’s disgusting, I know. 

There are currently clothes all over my bedroom floor, dust, dirt, trash. I get too overwhelmed and even though I know I can just try one small section at a time, I can never break out of the “all or nothing” mindset. I don’t have any dirty dishes in the sink thankfully but that’s bc I haven’t been eating/cooking meals. Why? Because I don’t have the energy. I never fucking have the energy. I’m 30 years old now and i’ve been trying to “find the energy” for 10+ years now. I can’t live like this for much longer. My quality of life is so so poor.

I’m sitting on my couch right now trying to will myself to stand up and just do SOMETHING but my body feels heavy and I feel sedated af like I downed 10 sleeping pills. I am always feeling sedated, ALWAYS. Coffee sedates me, stimulant meds sedate me, non-stimulant meds sedate me, I can’t fucking win! NOTHING GIVES ME ENERGY!! 

I am constantly feeling like i’m under the influence of heavy sleeping pills, and the sensation always seems to get stronger whenever I try to do something. Wtf is this??? My body is actively trying to sabotage me at all times and I wish I could just give up but I have no support system and I have to care/provide for myself SOMEHOW. But more and more each passing day I feel like this kind of life really isn’t worth living. 

I was desperate and just took some kratom. Surprise, now I feel even more tired. I’m sipping on a Monster and I don’t expect caffeine to help but I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to do with myself. 

I have suffered from worsening chronic fatigue for 10+ years and have treatment resistant depression, OCD, cptsd, panic disorder and God knows what else. Doctors have given up on me, i’ve seen countless over the years. I want to throw myself off a bridge rn but I don’t have the energy to even go downstairs to my car. I don’t think I actually want to die but I simply can’t see myself living like this for however much longer. I’m so fucking beyond frustrated with my body. 

I have nobody to turn to. I need help. :( ",3,1739838494.0,adhdwomen,3,1.0,False

Have you ever felt like your to-do list is a mile long and somehow growing *even longer*? 😅 It’s Wednesday, and I swear my list looks like I’m trying to solve world peace. But here’s a secret that’s been a game-changer for me: **The Rule of One.** Focus on *just one thing* to really level up your life.

**Sounds too simple to be true, right? But hear me out!** Here’s why honing in on one task at a time might just be your hero move:

1. **Laser Focus = Super Results.** When you zoom into one goal, you're not just skimming the surface; you're diving deep. Whether it's 'read for 30 minutes a day' or 'walk 10k steps,' focusing means you'll actually see progress. Remember when you were super passionate about learning the guitar? Yeah, imagine sticking to that without bouncing around to 15 other hobbies!

2. **Less Overwhelm, More Zen.** Ever feel like you’re juggling flaming swords *and* answering emails? 🏹 Yeah, focusing on one task means your brain can chill a bit. Multitasking is like being in a circus act, while single-tasking is taking a gentle yoga class. Choose peace, y’all! 🧘

3. **Mastering the Craft.** Doing one thing really well beats doing ten things kinda meh. Anyone here remember Ralph from school who played the piano like a pro because he just *didn't stop* practicing? Be like Ralph (or whatever your Ralph is), and nail that one skill.

4. **Clear Priorities, Lesser Decisions.** Life's full of choices—chicken or beef, binge on Netflix or head out for a run. It’s exhausting! By knowing your 'one thing,' you won’t waste energy on deciding what to do next. Less *analysis paralysis,* more *action*! 🌟

Now, I don’t mean you need to ignore the rest of life. I’m talking about choosing one thing to make the star of the show. Imagine you're hosting a party, and coffee is VIP. Sure, tea and hot cocoa are there too, but coffee’s what everyone’s psyched about.

And hey, remember *it’s okay to switch!* If reading a book a week isn’t lighting your fire anymore, swap it out for learning Spanish. Keep it fresh, keep it exciting!

What *one thing* are you going to tune into this week or month? Or maybe you've tried this before and have some wisdom to share? Let's dive into how focusing on one gem can totally transform your routine—and maybe your life!

Stay awesome, keep maximizing, and don’t sweat the small stuff!

a few years ago, i posted on here about how i had lost my DACA altogether due to Hanen’s blockage of initial applications and despite having DACA twice over. because of the pandemic shutdown and USCIS delays, my renewal was received so long after my DACA had expired, it was deemed as an initial application; the California facility emailed me to inform my DACA had been cancelled just a few days after Hanen’s order to block initial applications. 

i didn’t give up hope altogether because my grandma had sponsored my mom’s permanent residency request in 2013; i was 17 at the time. the lawyer had informed us that the system would “freeze” my age until our green card process was approved, so this had been my hope. like, this information passed onto us had been my light at the end of the tunnel for 10 years. 

last month, i called a lawyer to talk about possible ways to get my DACA back. i had seen a video of trump speaking positively about helping Dreamers, so it filled me with hope. it felt like i had to get up and fight back for once. unsurprisingly, the lawyer informed me that there was no chance of getting my DACA back without some kind of legislation or executive decision. in passing, i mentioned about my esperança not being lost due to my mom’s petition. he asked me to explain a little more, so i did, and he basically, like, might as well, had spit on my face. 

basically, the system did not, in fact, freeze my age, and i have been pushed out of my mom’s green card request since the age of 21, 6 years ago. this happened six years ago. our lawyer never mentioned a word. 

anyway 

there is so much that i want to say, but a lot of it does feel inadequate. i never wanted to live anywhere else. hearing the lawyer tell me that it’s only a matter of months that i’ll be deported - there’s just no worse feeling. it felt like i had a wrought iron gate slammed down in my face. 

currently, i’m in therapy (i have two therapists; one for talk therapy and the second is for trauma processing/dissociation), i have been on mood stabilizers, and i have never spent so much time outside. i even switched out coffee for matcha! so after spending my entire life being a go-getter, girl boss, always looking to feel inspired to build something incredible in this country, i have thrown in the towel altogether. i can’t say that i’m the happiest i’ve ever been because i feel the weight in my chest at every second of the day, and crying spells do come and get me here and there, but i have never been so mentally and emotionally stable as i am right now. i want to say (even believe) that there’s a way out for me, or some higher purpose to these nearly-impossible circumstances, but i would be lying to myself firstly. i also want to believe that it’s a gift to feel this moment so deeply because it means that the mental health treatments are working and that i’m still a human being with a beating heart, a young woman with so much life still left inside and ahead of her. i think that this is getting easier to believe, but it’s hard to remain consistent with this mentality when no concrete solution is ahead of us. 

currently, i’m staying put at my grandparents house while i figure out the next steps. i’ve been taking a lot of free courses to stay sharp.  it’s been one step at a time. i think it might be this way for awhile. if i get deported, then i want to leave as healthy and bravely as possible. i don’t know if i have it in me right now to leave on my own terms. 

all of this to say

i love you and i love us and there’s always space in every circumstance to look for a silver lining

i hope we get to always have it within us to take good care of ourselves and each other, no matter where or who or what we are in the world🤍

Personnel:
Me: 49m, US white guy;
Her: 36f Telugu-speaking Hindu, from Andra Pradesh

Situation:
My company is in the US, very international staff, Koreans, Taiwanese, Ethiopians, quite a few Telugu speakers, Punjabi, Malayalam, and Tamil speakers (my mental language map of India is better than my mental state map).  We are in different, albeit parallel groups, so we don’t work together.  She’s slightly senior to me in terms of rank.  Because I am not a complete idiot, I am extremely restrained in my conduct in the workplace, I keep it light, casual, and professional, until I know someone personally.

Background:
We’ve worked together for about six years.  We kid around a bit, but it’s irregular.  We’ve spent personal time together twice, ran into each other at lunch once and sat together, and once I bought her coffee when she was having a shit day, and listened to her download (her current lead is my former lead and that guy is a cartoon villain), that was about a year ago.

Incident:
Last week, we were returning to the office, and walked together for awhile, and I’m pretty good at making her laugh, so I did.  On the elevator, she put one arm through mine, leaned her head on my shoulder, and put her other hand on my chest.

Is my interpretation is that hers was a friendly gesture of fraternal affection correct?  Something she would do with a brother or uncle?

1irzd66,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1irzd66/wife_takes_my_keys_by_accident_im_nearly_an_hour/,"Wife takes my keys by accident, I'm nearly an hour late for work looking for my keys.  Ask her to be more careful in the future and now she says I'm an A-Hole for confronting her.","So the title pretty much sums it up.  But this happened a couple of weeks ago and it's been gnawing at me ever since that day.  

We both work and that morning we both had important items to be present for at our respective jobs.  She had to leave about an hour before I did and I got up, made her a hot drink to take along for the morning, got dressed and gave the dog a walk before I had to leave for my own work.  

Now, I'm very much in the habit of when I come home my keys go into a small bowl we have near the door.  It's rare that I'll leave them in a coat pocket, pants or somewhere else in the house.  She, on the other hand usually drops her keys wherever when she comes home and is often searching for them.  She has a tendency to lose track of a number of things and so long as it's not impacting me, that's her own issue to deal with.  She has also left our home's doors unlocked, a gas stove on and other unsafe practices because she's in a rush and not thinking clearly.  

On this day, I grabbed my jacket, my phone, my wallet and reached for my keys in the bowl but they weren't there.  Well, that's odd.  But on occasion I have left my keys in my pants or a jacket, etc.  So I start looking in the usual places.  But they're nowhere to be found. I text my boss that I'll be late and I'm searching for my keys.  I open kitchen drawers, look under couch cushions, drawers, etc.  and I spend nearly an hour tearing the house apart looking for my damn keys!  

Finally I have another look at the bowl and find >my wife's keys< buried under a few other things in the bowl.  At last, I have an answer that my wife took my set instead of her own.  Now, while we both have a key for each of our cars, the key sets look VERY different with mine being just a couple of rings and a dog tag with contact info if I ever drop my keys by accident.  Her set has big, colorful beads, pictures of our kids, etc. on multiple rings.  It's easy to tell them apart from one another.  

In order to get to work, I used her set of keys, drove into the office and luckily a meeting I was to attend was postponed.  But I still ended up an hour late for work.  My boss was okay with it since I'd called ahead and the meeting was rescheduled, though I was rattled. 

I work in a field where I cannot have a mobile phone on me while in the office, but do have a desk phone where my wife can reach me in an emergency and I'm always checking my mobile phone on a break in case she texts me a question or has a concern about something.  She teaches and sets her phone to DO NOT DISTURB, which I understand but she never remembers to turn her phone ringer back on and doesn't check her messages on breaks.  

Over morning coffee, I texted my wife that she'd taken my keys and I was an hour late for work.  I didn't get a reply until after 3 in the afternoon with an ""Oh, sorry...."" and that was it.  When I arrived home, she was on her laptop finishing something for work and asked how my day was.  I answered it was fine except the fact I couldn't find my keys and I was an hour late for work.  She replied ""Oh right, I put them in the bowl for you."" and said nothing else.  

My frustration got the better of me and I again mentioned that I'd had an important meeting scheduled for the morning that I would have missed.  She'd cost me an hour of frantic searching when she could have taken just a few seconds to check she had her own keys.  She snapped back that ""It was an accident, I didn't do it on purpose!""  I reminded her that she'd been leaving the house unlocked and/or an unlit gas burner on several times over the last few months and she was being irresponsible!  We'd been lucky, no one had entered our home, the gas didn't explode and any number of things.  A few months prior, she'd left water running in a 2nd floor sink and it overflowed, damaging a 1st floor ceiling which I still need to repair.  A year prior she'd overflowed a clothes washer and flooded our basement.  It took me a over a week to get everything dried out and cleaned up.  Again, none of this was ""On Purpose"", but the results were still the same!

Now, I'm NOT perfect.  Yes, I've missed a door lockup a handful of times over the past couple of decades and yes I once left the oven on.  But these are rare occasions, I'm human and am dutiful about being careful.  On her side, this is a near weekly event that she's left the doors unlocked, has cooking gas filling the kitchen, forgets to flush a toilet behind her or any number of things.  She just doesn't take the time to take care and avoid problems.  I know these aren't malicious acts, but they're also seemingly uncaring and irresponsible.  She defends herself repeatedly with ""It was an accident, I didn't mean to!""  If I ask her to ""Please, you've got to be more careful!""  She calls me an A-Hole who thinks they do no wrong and never makes mistakes.   

Anyway, it ended in a huge fight, yelling, screaming, sleeping in different rooms, the usual.  We talked and calmed down and were finally civil with each other.  But in just the past two weeks, she's again left the house unlocked and, again, left an unlit burner dumping gas into kitchen.  I.Just.can't,seem.to.get.her.to.understand.

1irzay9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1irzay9,Review - Four Seasons Tamarindo,"**Trip Report:** Four Seasons Tamarindo

My wife and I went on a short visit to FS Tamarindo for three nights in late January. The resort is beautiful and sits on a large nature reserve to the north of Manzanillo, Mexico. It’s a bit of a pain to get to, with limited flights from the US to ZLO unless you are LA-based (we came from the east coast via Houston). We booked the resort’s shared transportation option both ways ($50pp, vs $250 per car for private), but ended up getting picked up and dropped off in a private SUV. I’m guessing everyone else on our flights chose the private pickup option and we lucked out.

**Property (8/10):** 
**Main Building:** Most of the communal area outside of the spa is housed in a large, tiered, open-air structure offering some great views of the ocean no matter where you are. The building has 3 pools, including an adults-only option and a very large family pool with a good amount of beach chairs. 

**Beaches:** The resort has two “main” beaches. The first, located at the base of the main building, is Playa Majahua which is an excellent spot to take in the sunset or go for a walk in the soft sand. The other beach, Playa Tamarindo, is a ~5 minute ride by golf cart and is where all of the water activities (snorkel, kayak, SUP, etc.) can be found. It’s not as visually impressive as Majahua, and we found the sand at Tamarindo to generally be rockier as well. With both beaches, the seating situation is less than impressive. Despite having two large swaths of sand to spread out, the seating at both beaches is crammed together (1-2 rows of chairs with minimal separation) which was a bit disappointing. Staff are also not particularly proactive about putting towels and chair covers on the seats.

**Accommodations (10/10):** Booked a cliffside 1B suite and was upgraded to an oceanview suite (thanks to u/alex_travels for confirming the upgrade at booking!). The cliffside suites are very large, with a pool that stretches the length of the suite (~43 feet) offering stunning views of the coastline and Pacific Ocean, especially at sunset. The outdoor area also has a hammock and two loungers which are a great spot to relax and listen to the ocean. Visiting in January, we were able to see multiple humpback whales swimming in the ocean from our room, which was a very cool experience! 

Inside, there were multiple seating areas between the living room and bedroom, including a sofa, small dining table, and two cushy armchairs in the bedroom. The bathroom was large, with a walk-in closet, double vanity, indoor and outdoor showers, and a large recessed bathtub. Bath toiletries are from Le Labo.

**Food & Beverage (10/10):** Breakfast is a buffet with some additional a la carte egg dishes options that were all pretty good, but it did feel like there was a lack of variety from day to day. We enjoyed trying all of their different coffee options (French press, Chemex, siphon) during the course of our stay. 

I thought the lunch and dinner options were very strong and really enjoyed all our meals (primarily different types of tacos from Nacho at lunchtime, and lots of fresh seafood dishes at dinner from the two other restaurants, Coyul and Sol). For a resort, I thought the F&B was all very reasonably priced relative to what you might find at more popular Mexican destinations (Cancun/PVR). 

**Service (7/10):** Not a strength for this property, which I had read about in other reviews, but hoped had been cleaned up. Challenges began at check-in, when we were told our room was not yet ready, but would be so in ~30 minutes (after the standard 3pm check-in time). Over an hour later, the room still wasn’t ready which was rather frustrating considering the resort has perfect visibility into when each guest is due to arrive each day. Buggy pickup from Tamarindo beach was also a challenge, with multiple instances where we were waiting for 15+ minutes (ride is only ~5 minutes) – they just don’t seem to have enough buggies driving around for the number of rooms this property has. Housekeeping and restaurant service also had some misses (no turndown one night, forgetting food orders / delivering food to the wrong table); a bit of a bummer because the staff were generally very kind and welcoming.

Just for context, 2 years ago a brief relationship of mine ended badly. It was my first Catholic relationship and the break up really did a number on me. I took a year long break from dating. I started dating again last July. It was okay at first but now I'm struggling.

The last time I felt normal was in my last relationship. 

I'm putting myself out there, getting dates but I feel so horrible all of the time. I keep catastrophizing every connection and I find it very hard to remain engaged on dates. I recently got coffee with a guy I really liked. 

Is it possible for someone to even feel 'he's really cute and funny' and 'I feel like I'm signing my own death sentence' at the same time? I barely concentrate when he spoke and I felt like a zombie. I went home so disturbed. Pretty sure I had a panic attack. I kept feeling like I was going to ruin his life. He's a lovely, attractive young man. I don't think it's anything he did. I've been raving about him to everyone i know for months. 

I cancelled another date with a guy in November because I kept feeling like he was too attractive and everything was going to go wrong. 

I struggled with these feelings before in my first relationship before I was a Catholic (previously pentacostal). However, I boiled it down to my age at the time (17) and religious guilt for dating an atheist. I remember crying and having multiple panic attacks every week for almost 4 months. They only stopped when I dumped him.

One week later it was my exams period at university so I was less available but it looked like she understood that and I told her that. Two weeks later we went on a second date while I am still in my exams period (it is one month and a half long) again it was even more fun and also we got closer at the end she told me if I wanted to drink coffee before leaving and see her apartment so I told her I why not after the coffee I told her I need to leave because it’s late and I have a lot to do tomorrow.
So walked me to my car and I asked to kiss her and we kissed then got in the car and made out and I got a handjob. After that I was in a hurry because I had a lot to do tomorrow.
It kinda felt bad for me to leave like that especially after sharing a moment with her.
It can look like that’s all I wanted from her.
One week later I wanted to meet her even if I am under a lot of pressure, so I asked her if I can come with a bottle of wine and she told me she is with her friends and if I wanted I can come later. So I got to her house we watch a movie and drank some wine then we went to bed and spent the night together in the morning again I was in hurry to study so I left.
Again I felt bad for not staying with her I really wanted to.
Two days later after she answered very cold she sent me a message which said I enjoyed our time together you are really lovely but I don’t think what we have together is my way to go, i want to be honest with you. I really appreciate you and wish you all the best.
I called her right after that but she didn’t answered saying she is can’t answer right now and I should text her.
So I sent her another message and asked when she is available and she didn’t answered but seen the message.

AIO??? My boyfriend (25M) and I(23F) have been together for a year and a half. Last year for Valentine’s Day, he woke me up with coffee and donuts from my favorite coffee place. Then I went to work, where he later brought roses and a “bouquet” of cakes (3 different flavors of mini cakes). SO SWEET. Then he made me dinner at his place when I was done with work. This year he had to work but we had the morning and afternoon together. He got me the basic heart shaped chocolates and flowers and said he wanted to take me out for lunch. I made a DIY bouquet with a bunch of lures for fishing, chocolates and a pole. When he gave me the chocolates and flowers, I was almost embarrassed for how little effort he put it. It wasn’t personalized for me, no sweet meaningful card or whatever. It was a step backwards from last year. I’m upset with the lack of effort, especially because I put a lot of effort into my gift for him. I get some people don’t get anything, but for him to do so good last year and then do this??

After countless hours of reading, watching YouTube, practicing and spending money on different accessories, I realized there's so much you can do with this machine as it often has water flowing from the sides, is inconsistent in temperature and the steam wand is just okay and not as powerful.

Upon researching for a new machine to upgrade, I have noticed that most ""mid-level"" machines use a 54mm portafilter, even the Breville Bambino, and guess what!? You guessed right, EVERYTHING I have is for 51mmlolol... mind you most of the gear I have is Normcore brand which is not the most affordable to say the least.

Many questions raised: Is this normal to happen to beginners? Perhaps I should have not invested much in accessories given the machine I have? Is my algorithm jinxed and maybe there are actually better machines that use 51mm?

It's upsetting to think about the fact that I'd have to leave everything except for my WDT Tool and Grinder behind after spending hundreds of dollars plus taxes and weight cost as I ship them overseas (I live in the Dominican Republic). Leaving them behind or donating would be a realistic option as selling them would be a hassle given that there are little to no home baristas here, most people prefer to just go to a coffee shop.

Open to hear from you guys if this has happened to anyone and you have any suggestions, ha!

I had been looking forward to this Hawaii trip for months. Just me and Lucy, relaxing on the beach, sipping drinks, and finally getting some time away from everything. That was the plan. At least, it was until her parents got involved.

It started a week ago when Lucy casually mentioned that her parents “might” come along.

“Might?” I repeated, lowering my coffee.

“They haven’t booked anything yet,” she said quickly. “But Mom’s been really stressed lately, and she could use a break. And Dad—well, you know how he gets. A little sunshine might do him good.”

I knew exactly how he got. Greg, my father-in-law, was a time bomb wrapped in a polo shirt. He could go from calm to furious over the smallest thing, and more often than not, his wife, Linda, was the target. I’d sat through enough tense family dinners to know that a vacation with him was the opposite of relaxing.

“Lucy,” I said carefully, “we planned this as our trip. Just the two of us.”

“I know,” she said, biting her lip. “But it’s Hawaii. There’s plenty of space.”

That was the beginning. The next day, my sister-in-law, Megan, called.

“So, you’re really gonna leave them behind?” she said, skipping any small talk.

“I didn’t know it was my decision,” I said.

“Well, Lucy wants them to come, and honestly, it would mean a lot to Mom. You know how hard things are for her.”

Yeah, I knew. I also knew that a vacation wasn’t going to fix it.

“Greg’s just… under a lot of pressure,” Megan continued. “And if he gets mad, you’ll be there to help keep things calm.”

That was the last straw. “So now I’m supposed to babysit your dad?” I asked, heat rising in my voice.

“No one’s asking you to babysit. Just be supportive.”

I hung up before I said something I’d regret.

That night, Lucy brought it up again. “Megan said you were pretty upset.”

I sighed, rubbing my temples. “Lucy, this was supposed to be our trip. Your dad’s not exactly the easiest person to be around. I don’t want to spend my vacation walking on eggshells.”

She hesitated, then sat beside me. “I get it. I do. But they’re my parents.”

“And I’m your husband,” I said. “I love you, but I also need this time with you, not managing family drama.”

She looked torn, and for a long time, we just sat there in silence. Finally, she sighed. “Let me think about it.”

I nodded, knowing this wasn’t over.

The waves of Hawaii were calling, but whether they’d bring peace or a storm, I still didn’t know.

Also, I have terminal cancer.

1irz04a,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Greenpointherapy/comments/1irz04a/bringing_intersectionality_into_our_practice/,Bringing Intersectionality into Our Practice,"**Bringing Intersectionality into Our Practice**



Picture this: You're sitting with a client who's just shared that they're struggling with anxiety at work. As you lean in to listen more deeply, they mention they're a first-generation immigrant, queer, and living with an invisible disability. Suddenly, their experience of anxiety isn't just about workplace stress – it's about navigating multiple worlds while carrying multiple identities.



This is intersectionality in action, and making it part of our daily practice doesn't have to feel overwhelming. Let's break it down into real, everyday moments where we can make a difference.



**In the Therapy Room:** 



Think about those first few minutes with a new client. Instead of running through a standard checklist, try opening with something like: ""I'd love to understand the different parts of your identity that feel important to you."" You might be surprised by what comes up – maybe they mention being a working mother, an artist, and someone managing chronic pain, all of which shape their mental health journey in unique ways.



We had a clinician who shared in group supervision how she caught herself making assumptions about a client's family structure based on their cultural background. Instead of letting that assumption slide, she paused and asked, ""Could you tell me more about what family means in your life?"" This simple question led to a rich discussion about chosen family and cultural expectations.



**Getting Real with Ourselves**



Let's be honest – we all have blind spots. Maybe you notice yourself feeling more comfortable with clients who share your cultural background, or perhaps you realize you've been using outdated language around gender identity. These moments aren't failures; they're opportunities for growth.



Try this: Next time you're commuting to work or making your morning coffee, reflect on a recent session. Were there moments where you could have explored the intersection of a client's identities more deeply? What held you back? Sometimes just naming these moments helps us do better next time.



**Making It Practice-Wide**



In our breakout room conversations, we can start normalizing discussions about intersectionality. When discussing cases, instead of just focusing on symptoms, we might ask, ""How do you think this client's experience as a Black trans person impacts their relationship with healthcare systems?""



**Real-World Application**



Let's say you're working with a client who's dealing with depression. Rather than jumping straight to CBT techniques, you might explore how their experience as a disabled person of color influences their access to support systems. This isn't just about acknowledging different identities – it's about understanding how they interact and create unique challenges and strengths.



Remember the client who seemed resistant to homework assignments? Consider whether traditional therapy frameworks align with their cultural values and life circumstances. Maybe they're a single parent working two jobs, and our typical approach needs adaptation.



**Growing Together**



We're all learning here. Last week, one of our colleagues shared how they fumbled pronouns with a non-binary client but used it as an opportunity to model accountability and repair. These moments, though uncomfortable, build trust and show our commitment to growth.



**Simple Daily Practices**



Start small. Maybe it's:

Reading an article about disability justice while eating lunch or asking yourself, ""What assumptions am I making about this client's experience?""



**Making Mistakes and Moving Forward**



Remember: this work isn't about perfection. It's about creating spaces where all parts of our clients' identities can exist together, where healing can happen in the fullness of who they are.



Let's make this a conversation. What intersections of identity have you noticed influencing your client work lately? How has your own identity journey shaped your therapeutic approach? These questions keep us growing, learning, and better serving our wonderfully diverse community.



By grounding our understanding of intersectionality in real, everyday moments, we make this vital framework more accessible and actionable in our practice. After all, therapy is about human connection, and understanding intersectionality helps us connect more deeply with the full humanity of each person who appears on our screens.

And then, suddenly—quietly but sharp—a fart.

It was the kind of thing that announced itself with no shame and no ceremony, just the quiet resignation of a man who had long since stopped caring whether his bodily functions needed an audience or not.

His eyes flicked to me. Just for a second. Then back to the middle-distance.

The moment held itself, awkward but undeniable. The way all real things are.

And then, he spoke.

“You know, the number one tip I could give about writing?”

His voice was gravelly, the kind that sounded like it had been dragged through too many late nights and too many cigarettes. It had that casual authority, the kind that comes from being right so many times you don’t even have to prove it anymore.

I leaned forward, instinctually holding my breath—not just from the fart, but from the weight of the moment.

Here it was. The divine providence. The Holy Grail.

I was about to receive The King’s Word.

“Never write when you’re horny.”

Matter-of-fact. No smirk. No wink. A law as immutable as gravity.

I clicked my teeth.

Sat back.

Let it sink in.

That was it.

That was the wisdom of the man who built entire literary universes, who had spun nightmares into gold, who had redefined an entire genre of fiction.

And honestly?

Yeah. It made a lot of sense.

I could already picture it—some poor bastard, hand trembling over the keyboard, trying to write something profound, something real, and then next thing you know, the protagonist is just inexplicably describing the shape of someone’s ass for three pages.

Stephen King’s soft jowls rested like a prophet’s robes as he reached for his coffee, took a long sip, and smacked his lips in satisfaction.

I checked the tape recorder to make sure it was still running.

That probably sounds silly, but I'm 22 years old and about to graduate from university. I’ve realized that after that comes work—the final level in the game of growing up. All the previous levels are just preparing you for it, but that preparation is never truly enough.  

What’s even scarier is that all of this is inevitable. I’ll start working—probably at my dream job—and then I’ll keep doing that until the end of my life. Then my parents will pass away, and eventually, I will too, marking the end of my existence. A few decades later, even the memory of me will disappear from this world.  

Many people would say, *“Do something meaningful so that people remember you.”* I used to be one of those people. But now I understand that, in reality, no one will remember who I truly was. My essence will be wasted. I’m not saying there’s no life after death, but does it even matter if your current self means nothing? The only things that matter are what you do, but you yourself get lost in them.  

No one knows how many spoonfuls of sugar Einstein put in his coffee, right?  

Since I’m getting off track, let me get to the point: I desperately need someone to tell me what to do. I know it’s impossible for anyone to tell me how to live my life, and I don’t want that—I already know. What I want is for someone to explain how, after all this *“preparation”* in school and university, I’m supposed to be ready for a life that will eventually destroy me.  

How am I supposed to be ready for this final level, knowing that in the end, I will lose?

They were founded by an eccentric German man in the 1930s. Jessica Ainscough (the primary person that Milla is based on) and her mother went to Gerson and followed their teachings. 

So why did the show change the name of the institute? It certainly wasn’t to protect the innocent in this case. Maybe Netflix was afraid of being sued? Maybe if they used the name Gerson in the show, they would have had to stick closer to the facts because they couldn’t say a fake person went to the institute? 

Regardless, Gerson comes away from this relatively unscathed. The top results when you google them are still their own websites and positive reviews. This place has done decades of harm to cancer patients and at least 60 people have died on their watch and they’re not even called out by name in a “where are they now” slide.

Anyway,

1) The dual spout on the portafilter is crooked, it looks like it just screws on but I can’t get it to budge in either direction. Not really a big deal but kind of weird.

2) The big bolt that the stream wand comes out of is crooked. Hasn’t seemed to affect steaming ability at all.

3) The pressure gauge is off center in the little window. Hasn’t seemed to be an issue getting up to 9 bars but also kind of weird.

I guess I’m just wondering if anyone thinks these issues are potentially a problem, if it doesn’t affect the function of the machine I don’t think I care. But I did pay a lot for it so I want it to work right.

I also hate cooking.","I am 5'11 and 160 lbs skinnyfat male in my early 30s with zero exercise. I find the caloric calculators to be a little generous and definitely don't want to over estimate anything so I use the basal metabolic rate (BMR) which is about 1210 kCal/day. My goal weight is in the low 140s. For fat loss I try to aim for between 1200-1500 calories a day. Here is how I've been managing that:

Breakfast: two softboiled free-run eggs on two slices ancient grains bread. Vegan margarine. Several cups of black coffee.
Total = ~490 kCal

Lunch: Clif Bar/nothing (i don't really get that hungry until after I get home from work in the evening/I power through)
Total = 260/0 kCal

Dinner: Varies.
Frozen Vegetebale Ristorante Pizza (800 kCal) (I take a Lactaid pill for this)
or
186g whole wheat pasta, ~130 ml classico sauce (640 kCal)

Daily total: 1,130 - 1,550 kCl

I always have a water bottle which I refill several times a day. This plan will occasionally leave room for a snack of fresh fruit or a second Clif Bar. I've been on it for about six weeks and have lost close to fifteen pounds. This isn't an exact figure as I'm unsure of the day/time I weighed myself. Either way it has been sustainable but YMMV. It's not a 'for life' thing but it has helped me get into better habits as I came to realize how many calories are in things like potato chips and baked goods, which I now avoid. I do have the occasional cheat where if I'm at an invited dinner I will eat whatever is served which usually adds up to close to 1000 extra kCal. However if the meal plans are followed otherwise the weekly intake should still be low enough to lose weight.

ANY time that something political comes up, they use this as an excuse to start up the same old, tired discussions about how they don't like women, and they're totally uninterested in new information or evidence on these topics, and dismiss cited facts on them.

I have my own bitterness, particularly about the topic of employment, because EVERY man whom I know has a cushy wushy big fat tushy desk job, but wants to go on a rant about how hard men have it. They talk as if women all have the good jobs and make all the money, though! The women around them who are doing hard labor are completely invisible to them. They work in offices where everyone but the maid is male, but they all imagine that ""somewhere"" women are making more than men.

NO ONE has ever talked to me about how I was abused in my job in child care, and acknowledged how difficult it was to live under that stress, and for very little pay ($8/hr, with some unpaid hours). Everyone around me was so satisfied to see me getting mistreated for pay that wasn't worth it in this job, and very few have said how awful that was.

Multiple men told me ""well then why didn't you get a better job"" as if I didn't think of or try that.  It also wasn't an option for me to not work, because my parents expected me to work to support them, my spouse expected the same, and was ""looking for work"" for over a year while I did this. Who knows what he was actually doing, because I was gone 5 AM - 11 PM, or else trying to sleep at work and gone for days at a time. I asked him to be up to make me coffee before work, or have dinner made after work, and he never did these things and was always asleep, despite always talking about how he liked to stay up at night and work, which is what he did when I had time off which he once told me that he did just to avoid me (he later said that he never said this).  He was totally checked out to my work situation and didn't say anything about me working for a week with a fever, sipping on antihistamines all day to make it through.

I lost my mother not too long ago, and my whole life got turned on its head,

I didn't really have time to process it, as i was under 18, and living with my father was a last resort option. I lived with my aunt for about two months before i could move out into a student apartment. and so the grief has slowly begun sneaking up, December was especially tough as i lost my maternal grandmother the year before, and with everything it was just an eerie, somber quiet. I once broke down in a local super market because i saw something she would've made some snappy joke about. but most recently its been due to my birthday being in January. We always suspected that my grandmother couldnt make it to my graduation, but we never expected my mom to go. i got to keep most of her stuff, and for a student im living luxuriously, materially at least. emotionally, and mentally im about as stable a two mile high spagheti tower.

today i went to make a cup of coffee, i don't drink coffee, never liked it. but wanted to try and see if that would change if i used the sweetener my mom used to use. I knew i had one at home so it should've been easy. but after searching for em for about 10 or so minutes i couldn't find em. I looked everywhere, the drinks cabinet, the cutlery drawer, up amongst my warehouse of a tea cabinet. but nothing. it hit so deeply that I couldn't find em, and now I'm just sitting here feeling as though I've lost something so important to her. I always knew when she was making her coffee, because I could hear those two clicks of the sweeteners. but they're gone.

I know its just cheap sweeteners, but it feels wrong on all accounts. I'm still waiting for someone to jump out and say its just a joke, and that she's not really dead; or for her to knock on my door and explain what happened. I know that wont happen but thats what it feels like. And so in continuation of that I don't want to get rid of a single one of her things, afterall it isn't mine to throw away, its hers...

So loosing even something as cheap and common as her coffee sweeteners hurt, I'm almost ready to cry over it. because instead of hearing her make her coffee, and consequently hearing those tiny, almost inaudible clicks, its just silent. its only me in this apartment, and even though I have everything a student could ask for, I don't have her.

I'd be more than happy to answer any questions or engage in dialogue about grief, because the important thing is that you don't do the same I did; get caught up in the practical things and just spearhead through. it'll only hit later, when there's no more practical things left...

Since 2021, Tim Baker—better known as ""Sarasota Tim""—has been crafting an online persona built on half-truths, exaggerations, and outright scams. From the humble beginnings of a tent in a friend’s backyard to a supposed ""entrepreneurial"" success story, the reality is far less impressive.

The Fabricated Past

A ninth-grade dropout, Tim boasts of a career in the auto industry—17 years as a ""salesman"" when, in reality, he was nothing more than a lot greeter and car detailer. His resume also includes stints as a door-to-door encyclopedia peddler and a Fuller Brush salesman, neither of which suggests the business acumen he claims to possess. Despite all his ""hustling,"" he never cleared $40,000 in a single year.

The Financial Grift

Tim’s financial troubles are well-documented: bankruptcy, unpaid medical bills, and an apparent refusal to provide healthcare for his children, leaving taxpayers to pick up the tab. But his real windfall came during the pandemic when he secured a $58,000 EIDL loan, along with PPP funds and unemployment benefits—effectively double-dipping at the expense of working Americans. Instead of using these funds for legitimate business expenses, he splurged on luxuries: a camper, an SUV, a motorcycle, new phones, and firearms.

The YouTube Scheme

Tim stumbled into YouTube fame with a viral video about collecting Social Security at 62. He leveraged this attention into an online grift, collecting ad revenue and Buy Me a Coffee donations from unwitting followers. His carefully curated image as a thrifty, self-made retiree crumbles under scrutiny: a string of failed careers, a dependence on government checks, and an ever-present handout mentality.

The Tammy Musselman Saga

Enter Tammy Musselman—a polygamist who simultaneously maintained a marriage with Dwayne while cohabitating with Tim. When Dwayne met an unfortunate end—run over by his own truck—Tammy cashed in, selling his home for $500,000. With this sudden influx of cash, Tim and Tammy embarked on a lavish lifestyle, masquerading as a happy, minimalist couple while enjoying expensive cruises, a furnished luxury apartment, and a steady flow of perks from gullible followers.

The Inevitable Downfall

Tim’s con is unraveling. His YouTube views have plummeted by 60%, and his once-loyal supporters are waking up to the reality of his grift. The Buy Me a Coffee scam is drying up, and even his manufactured outrage videos fail to gain traction. While he clings to his narrative of being a ""retired businessman,"" his only real legacy is a trail of deception, burned bridges, and estranged children who want nothing to do with him.

The Internet Never Forgets

Tim Baker’s name is now synonymous with failure—not as an entrepreneur, but as a cautionary tale. His own videos serve as an archive of narcissism and dishonesty, ensuring that anyone who searches for him will find the truth:

A man who lied about his career.

A man who exploited taxpayer dollars.

A man who abandoned his responsibilities.

A man whose final years are spent desperately trying to stay relevant while the world moves on.


For someone who claims to have it all figured out, the reality is clear: Tim Baker isn’t a businessman—he’s a hustler who ran out of suckers.

1irxwz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1irxwz8/did_i_ever_actually_know_them/,did I ever actually know them,"I (23f) broke up with my bf (28m) of two years about 10 days ago. It was an excruciatingly difficult decision to make because he technically hadn’t done anything wrong, I just knew that the relationship wasn’t what I needed in the long run and it wouldn’t have been fair of me to keep stringing him along, so I ended it. he took it really hard, he would have stayed in this relationship forever. we went a week without talking and then I ended up texting him about getting our stuff back to each other. everything was civil, we decided to meet sunday since we were both off of work, and I really started to think that maybe we could eventually be friends (i’ve never felt this way with an ex bf, I want nothing to do with them after the breakup). we live in the same city and work right next door to each other, so I was hoping for something amicable so our blood doesn’t boil when we inevitably run into each other sooner or later.  
all was well until I got a text from him when I was out with my sister and her bf. It was a screenshot of a random girls dating profile. I literally thought it was a prank because he would never do something like this or try to intentionally hurt me. It was not a prank. I asked why he would send that to me, his response was “I didn’t mean to send that to you.”
The next day (sunday, our planned exchange day) he left my stuff in garbage bags outside my door. I thought it looked like a lot and I started to realize as I went through it that he had given me everything I have ever bought him as a gift, made for him, and everyday things of mine he had at his place. this included all of the handmade gifts over the past 2 years like hats, jewelry, personalized magnets, a personalized puzzle, etc. He also gave me everything I’ve bought him (coffee cups, little trinkets). He went as far at returning the box of tampons under his sink, along with the razor I left there. 
I’ve been feeling so guilty up until now because I know he’s hurting and I’ve been heavily struggling with the breakup myself. I’m just so confused how your person could do such a 180 in such a small amount of time. the intention behind his actions are so shocking to me.

**A little about me:**

I deal with ADHD (as many others in this sub have also shared) and I work a high stress corporate job from home. I definitely seek calorie dense food as a reward, in part because it's nice and in part because there's kind of little else that scratches the itch for me to turn to in my current life setup.

I also am pretty much sedentary for the first time in my life thanks to said job, as a former competitive athlete. On some level I still have the eating habit of someone who trains twice a day but my lifestyle has changed in a major way and those eating habits need to catch up.

I wear lots of wearables that track metrics over time so I have the benefit of being able to look back and dispell any narrative I might have by asking myself whether the metrics match up with my story.

**My story:**

In 2016 I was about 130lbs. I was newly no longer playing my sport, in love with running over the previous couple of years and never thought about food (ZERO food noise, just vibes) - I just ate what I wanted when I wanted to. But I was getting a ton of movement running almost 6-7miles 5x week. I walked to work, lived alone, never drank, and had an otherwise very full and stimulating life. I had been at that weight for some time, but I think my set point probably oscillates between 145 and 130.

I had a baby late 2017 and the weight I'm at now is how much I weighed at 9mos pregnant (I carried BIG, and had a ginormous 9lb baby).  
I was home with my baby but very active between 2017 and 2020 as we lived in a walkable city with lots of hills lol. I had slowly gained some weight at this time but was easily maintaining about 10lbs above my highest set point, sitting right around 155 ""regardless"" of what I did. I was breastfeeding at the time, and some people said the weight just falls off... that was not the case for me at all. And mentally this was tough for me.  
So, my mental health was awful, I was stressed all the time as I had what I now know was undiagnosed PPD, had no help with our newborn, and I was not transitioning well to family life and I felt really conscious of my weight. On top of all of this, the circumstances of my kid's birth had unlocked some kind of sleeping beast in my DNA and I started having wild physical health symptoms. I now have diagnoses that explain what I was going through at the time, but essentially my relationship to my body shifted wildly during this time.

I went back to work in 2020 and immediately you can see my metrics start to tank in terms of the amount of movement I was getting. In 2021 I took a big step up in my career toward a more demanding and more stressful job, and then made another similar move in 2022, and then again in 2024. I've majorly increased my earning and my stress in the last 4-5 years, and the impact to my sleep and time spent exercising or getting movement has suffered.

From the period of 2017-2023 I had this story that ""no matter what I was doing"" I was just slowly gaining and gaining, as if my body was broken and nonresponsive. At some point in 2023, I did a deep dive into all my data and saw instead that, while that's how it felt and in that sense it's my truth, in reality I was not working as hard as I thought I was. I was working as hard as I COULD, but my life had adjusted to shift that baseline so far down, that I was no longer hitting the thresholds my body was used to hitting. My energy and exertion had gone to work and maintaining a house, and while I felt I was still working hard in the gym my overall time spent, steps taken daily, and average daily burns had tanked so much it was clear that was really the culprit. Ultimately... that's okay, because there's a season for everything, but it wasn't fair to ME to have this narrative of being broken when the data so clearly pointed toward another, much more fixable cause.

I ultimately decided to try CS because I wanted a companion (or as I've been calling it, rocket boosters) to a general lifestyle rebalancing that is the larger project of my overall life at this time. CS is part of it, so is getting back into swinging kettlebells and having a more balanced relationship to work, food, time with my family, and movement overall. I have goals that are larger than just weight loss (i.e., being at a weight where I don't feel like I'd be too triggered to get pregnant again) but losing the weight is also a big part.

**Methods:** Now a bit about how I'm doing this thing.

* I weigh myself daily at the same time. Weight fluctuations are natural and for me can be within 2-4lbs, so I don't want to weigh myself sporadically and risk seeing the true progress that's being made. I then take the average weight across the entire week and compare week over week. Seeing my metrics, I can definitely see that I'd be risking seeing the forest for the trees if I was weighing myself less frequently. I use a scale by Qardio which also gives me my % bone mass, % muscle, % water and % BF. While I'm skeptical about the objective accuracy, I believe in the relative accuracy - as in I do think the important thing is the ability to see change in those measurements overtime rather than being attached to the % measurement intself.
* I track all my food with Cronometer, the purpose is to ensure I am getting the right macro balance for me each day. My goals don't really allow for muscle loss, which is a risk on sema, so I'm ensuring my protein intake is on point. I am for a deficit of 1,000/day or bigger and I make that happen with exercise, rather than dipping below 1200-1500 calories a day.
* I workout 4-5 days per week. I go with what my body wants to do for now, but in month 2/3 I intend to get a bit more disciplined in weight training. Right now the most important thing is overall conditioning and a sustainable relationship to movement. I am focusing on overall burn, steps per day, and minutes spent exercising.
* I have folded meditation back into my daily routine, I want to heal my overall relationship with myself as part of this so I don't just yo-yo in the future if I'm off the medication after meeting my goal.
* I wear Apple Watch and Oura ring as my methods of getting daily metrics.
* I track everything, EVERYTHING, in a spreadsheet with daily view and weekly view.

Future posts won't be this long I don't think, but just wanted to provide some context / story. Here's how the weeks have progressed for me so far.

**Week 1: Holy shit, so** ***that's*** **food noise?**  
**Loss this week: 1.2lbs**  
**Avg change in BF%: -1%**  
I felt the effects within 2 hours of my shot. I was like holy sh!t..... *is this how normal people feel?* I wasn't for sure if I related to the concept of food noise, but I felt like I did.... and holy shit, experiencing less food noise has really blown my mind. This is a familiar feeling I have felt, and it's validating to be back here now that I realize the altered state I've been in, under massive amounts of stress the last 7-8 years.

**Week 2: Clear mind**  
**Loss this week: 2.1lbs, total 3.3lbs down**  
**Avg change in BF%: -1%**  
Really feeling in my swing by this week - the full reduction in food noise has allowed me some mental space to actually start focusing on other things. While I'm still not having any negative side effects, I am firmly noticing this week the overall reduction in pain and inflammation. I'm generally in a much better mood (I track daily with readings via Apple's state of mind feature). I think the b12 helps, so does a little bit of creatine everyday, and so does general hopefulness in the lack of food noise.

**Week 3: Dialing it in**  
**Loss this week so far: 1.4lbs, total 4.7lbs down**  
**Avg change in BF%: flat**  
I've been able to up my training volume as my body feels adjusted, and this energy and positive feelings continue to build on themselves. I did get my period this week and had 2 days where movement was very low and food intake was slightly higher, as is natural during that time. I feel good, but wonder how the rest of the week will pan out. Hoping to see overall loss approach 2lbs this week, but would understand if my period in general results in a slightly less loss week. My average burn is slightly lower for the week than weeks 1 and 2, so I'm working to make up for that today through Wednesday to see if that makes a difference.

A few learnings from this week:

* My period was 5 days late, which I do attribute to the introduction of the drug.
* I do not eat sugar generally due to one of the aforementioned chronic illnesses. On Valentine's Day, I had a GF/V cookie that was loaded with sugar. Honestly my body would normally yell at me for this, but it's something I'm comfortable subjecting myself to once every so often LOL. Instead of the usual blood sugar wackiness symptoms, I had major nausea. Others have said this, and I think it's true, that sugar and/or grease could be a trigger for negative side effects. That was enough for me to really pick my moment next time I want to have something unusual haha. The cookie wasn't worth it, so I'll spend that sicky budget more wisely in the future lol.
* I had a blip where I hadn't had a BM in 2 days. On the third day I had a little bit of coconut oil in my coffee, and boy that did the trick way better than the senna tea I had bought LOL.

I'll update again at some point after my 4th week ends to close out the full month! My goal is to be on this drug at a clip of 2lbs/week so that I can hit my goal by July. At that point I'll re-evaluate.

Wishing everyone all the success and the least possible number of side effects possible. <3",2,1739833668.0,CompoundedSemaglutide,3,0.75,False

Decided to switch up my strategy, at first I was just going low fat but still experiencing IBS like symptoms. Here is what seems to be working for me for 4 days now. Greatly reduced discomfort and consistent and firm(so funny that this is a win) bowel movements.

My triggers are anything beef, and high Saturated fats, trans fats will kill me. Vegetables with Fat such as avocado don't seem to bug me. I can eat pretty much any Veggie or Fruit. 

Morning:

7:30 AM - 12:30 PM
1/2 shot of Ginger
1/2 shot of Tumeric 
8 FL oz of Kefir, Strawberry flavor 
1 Apple 
1 Banana
30 FL oz of water

Salad (Cucumbers, Iceberg, Cabbage, Carrots, 2 Egg whites, Light cheese, 1/2 Avocado, dressing)
16 FL oz water
16 FL oz water w/ lemon
12 fl oz green tea with honey 

So far so good, I am going to incorporate excersize and maybe CBD oil to it as well.

Current pros/cons running through my head: Ecoboost got that warranty, better mpg (like I suddenly care about that now lmao), and ngl that 2024 redesign is clean af. GT got that sweet sweet V8 rumble, probably better resale, and won’t get clowned at meets… but also gotta respect that GT power, especially in the rain.

So what’s the move? Should I be responsible and go Ecoboost or embrace my inner speed demon with the GT? (And before anyone says “save the money” - my boring adult stuff is already handled, this is purely for that sweet sweet dopamine rush.)",0,1739833356.0,Mustang,4,0.5,False

1irxm4c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1irxm4c,Coffee - consolidation with falling volume,"Volume stayed quite strong all up until peaking on 02/10. The last week was a messy consolidation. The good news is volume fell during the consolidation. But then there was a spike down on higher volume on Friday. Didn’t go lower than the previous low and had a bounce before the close. 
 
Will need to watch this one very closely. Could still break out of consolidation to the upside or could break down lower. 
 
Positioning shows longs closed out over 3000 contracts this week, but are overall still positioned highly net long. 
 
Brazilian farmers have sold through 85% of the 2024 crop. Next crop starts harvest May of 2025, and forecasts are for 34.7-39 million bags of arabica. Colombia could fill in some of the gap, but also might get a weather event from La Niña this year. 
 
I definitely don’t want to hold this thing until next harvest but I think a lot of wholesalers might start hoarding some inventory as we get further into the spring, just in case the 2025 crop comes in lighter than expected. With most of the crop already sold, I think there’s a real risk that we run critically low on Arabica supply circa March-April, with relatively inflexible demand, which is still GROWING due to Chinese companies like Luckin Coffee expanding.

Derry ranked second among the top 10 worst UK Cities to work remotely. This is according to a new study by ZeroBounce. 

Brendan McGilligan - 15 Feb 2025 3:00 PM

A recent study by ZeroBounce revealed the ten worst places to work remotely based on a comprehensive analysis of nine key factors affecting remote work. Data was collected from 69 UK cities to evaluate their suitability for remote work.

The analysis considered broadband speed, internet and electricity costs, as well as rent for a one-bedroom apartment. Other factors included coffee shop accessibility and quality, crime and air quality indices, and the availability and density of co-working spaces.

Derry ranks second with a composite score of 91.1. While its Internet cost is more affordable at £32, the city struggles with a high crime index of 51.34 and poor air quality, ranking among the lowest in this category. Its limited number of co-working spaces and low density further reduce its appeal for remote professionals.

The only city that ranks worse than the Maiden City in this study is Lisburn.

It took the top spot with a composite score of 99.2. It ranks as the worst city for remote work due to its extremely limited infrastructure for professionals. Lisburn has the most expensive internet cost among the cities analyzed, at £55.00, and only one co-working space, giving it the lowest co-working space density overall. With limited amenities and resources, it’s a challenging environment for remote workers.

Armagh comes in third with a composite score of 90.3. With an air quality index of 55, the city ranks among the most polluted on the list. Remote workers face further limitations with just two co-working spaces, highlighting a lack of infrastructure for professionals. Affordable internet at £32.00 offers some relief, but not enough to overcome the city’s other shortcomings.
Top Stories

It means that the top three worst places in this study are based in the north of Ireland, while the following seven places on the list are based in England.

Lichfield and Preston round out the top five on the list, with the latter achieving a composite score of 88.7. The city has one of the worst air quality indices at 68, significantly impacting living conditions for remote professionals. Broadband speed is slow at just 54 Mbps, complicating its suitability for remote work. Although the city has ten co-working spaces, its low density and other limitations keep it low on the list.

The next four on the list are Sunderland, Doncaster, Carlisle, and Coventry.

Salford rounds out the top ten with a composite score of 85.2. While it offers the most affordable internet cost at £21, the city suffers from poor air quality and high rent costs at £800. Salford has 11 co-working spaces, which gives it a slightly higher density than others, but it remains a less desirable choice for remote work due to other factors.

A spokesperson from ZeroBounce commented on the study: “For remote workers, choosing the right city isn’t just about fast internet but about the whole package. Reliable broadband is crucial, but so are factors like affordable rent, clean air, and access to co-working spaces when you need a change of scenery. If you’re struggling with connectivity or finding the right workspace, it’s worth exploring local options like public libraries or shared office spaces. And don’t forget to weigh up the overall quality of life—things like commute-free days lose their shine if you’re battling poor air quality or unreliable services.”",5,1739832965.0,DerryLondonderry,7,0.78,False

We’ll be traveling either over NYE 2026 or MLK weekend 2026 with my family of 4 that includes my 18 and 12yo kids. I’ve got 3 of the 4 nights already booked for MLK weekend at the Andaz with an alert set up for my last day. Only 2 of the 4 nights over NYE are available. All days are available at Grand Hyatt Playa del Carmen. I’ve got a GOH award that expires Feb 2026 and trying to get the best use out of it!

All but my 18yo have been to the Andaz and we had a fantastic time. Since the hotel is a little more remote, I didn’t know if we’d prefer Playa del Carmen and the ability to easily walk to other restaurants and shopping. Our last time in Costa Rica, we did horseback riding, volcanos, sloth tour, waterfalls, and a chocolate/coffee tour. Not sure if there's much more to do that doesn't feel like a repeat for my 12yo. Loved the monkeys at the hotel every morning and evening. My kids have never been to Mexico, so thought we could take them to a Mayan ruin site and maybe do Xplor (my husband and I have been to Mexico many times).

Just trying to weigh my options and get some other opinions. Also open to other places where my GOH award would be really beneficial - primarily just looking for warm winter weather for this Midwest family! I’ve got alerts set up in Aruba too, but availability there is non-existent.

There is a girl who was in my same class but later dropped out of university and I only saw her in person like a few days. Later I found her on Instagram via one of my friends and texted her how she's been. I asked her  if she's down for a coffee this week and she accepted.

So here's the thing: I liked her a bit too much I'm afraid, and it's been years since I had crush on any girl this big. Before that I pretty much only dated for the short term, and for casual hookups. With this girl though I want to take things further because I think we have many similar interests.

Now, I don't want to be too daring this time like usually do, but I don't want to be too passive and give friend-ish vibes either. What would be the middle way for this?
