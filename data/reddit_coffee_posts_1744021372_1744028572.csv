Why is it spelled Mokka, and not Mocha like the catppuccin theme?

All Catppuccin themes are names of different sorts of coffee, so it is easy enough to remember and know how to pronounce. My question is just, why did Garuda go with ""Mokka"", and is it still pronounced the same way?

I could not find any discussions on this, so I decided to make this post.",1,1744028319.0,GarudaLinux,0,1.0,False

Not cobalt, not navy. Not the pretend melancholy of a curated tear in a beige gallery. I am the blue that comes from the marrow‚Äîthe blue that seeps from behind the ribs when your chest caves inward at the sight of an untouched bowl of fruit, a shadow that looks like a person you used to love, or a jacket left in a stairwell you‚Äôll never climb again.

They say blue is calming. But that‚Äôs only true for people who‚Äôve never had to live inside it. My blue folds, my blue bites. It hums at the base of the spine, pools under the tongue, leaks from my pen like spoiled honey. It carries the weight of thought, the thought of weight. And I carry both.

When I say I‚Äôm sad, I don‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm unhappy. I mean I‚Äôm textured. I mean I‚Äôm laced. I mean I‚Äôve been touched by something so ancient and so specific it can‚Äôt be named. Only referenced. Only inked. My sadness is not a symptom‚Äîit‚Äôs a language. And I am its chosen boi.

When I was younger, I thought all sad bois became poets or ghosts. I didn‚Äôt realize you could be both. I didn‚Äôt realize that when you told me I was ‚Äútoo much,‚Äù what you meant was: you don‚Äôt want to translate what you‚Äôll never understand.

People like to look at sad boiz from across the room and call it art. But no one wants to sit next to one. They don‚Äôt want to know that I cry into my coffee and feel historic about it. That I journal so hard I‚Äôve bent my fingers. That the tears I cry have texture, temperature, narrative arc.

You thought I was brooding for attention. No‚ÄîI brood for survival.

1jtjngm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Non_Medical_ADHD/comments/1jtjngm/wiring_brain_to_discount_future_using_antifuture/,wiring brain to discount future using anti-future bias / backloading,"i recently wrote about using reddit saves and youtube Watch Later and in that post i believe i talked about wiring my brain by forcing *everything* through saves / Watch Later, even things i'm going to immediately watch. 

*side note: one of the things i plan to do with this sub is capture/share strategies i use as i use them in both my day-to-day life and also when dealing with what the universe serves up.*

so, on the way out of my kitchen, i notice (by design because i keep the trash can right at the entrance/exit of the kitchen so that i see it first/last when i'm entering/exiting the kitchen) that the lid is not on the trashcan and that it's also sufficiently full to go ahead and empty it.

*side note: it's interesting how non-intuitive it is to me (probably bc ADHD) how much i use the trash can when i'm in the kitchen. and i don't have a fancy trash can with a foot pedal or anything like that so i have to manually remove the lid so i now take the lid off the trash can on my way into the kitchen every time.* 

so i have a decision to make, do leave the lid off of the trash can so i notice that it's full the next time i enter the kitchen? or do it write down on my whiteboard that i need to empty the trash?

there's no single right answer to this. but i did have my hands full and was anxious to get to my coffee and start my work day, so i decided to leave the lid off instead of stopping in my tracks to put things down, turn on the light, write on the whiteboard, etc.; which all seemed like overkill when i was destined to 'collide' with the issue eventually, i.e. this is not something that is 'at risk of forgetting'.

this reminded me of a strategy that i used for several months to re-wire my brain to better balance my concern with my current vs future self.

while not necessarily bad, i found myself spending a suspiciously large amount of time trying to take care of my future self, e.g. a ton of time introspecting, coming up with strategies/routines/procedures/technical solutions, etc.

...but also just 'communicating with my future self' and 'smoothing things out' for my future self, like putting things away immediately, etc.

*side note: one thing that i'll never be guilty of doing for my future self is hand-washing anything, haha.*

...and in memory serves (lol, really?!), i believe the thing that gave me the anti-future bias / backloading idea is black pepper. allow me to explain...

i use black pepper *every time* i'm in the kitchen, so it makes no sense to put it up/away in a cabinet/spice rack/drawer or whatever. so now i just leave it out on the counter (all with a lot of other things i use frequently) and move it around if needed (but of course i also discovered 'low rent' space in my kitchen that could accommodate such without having to move them around, etc.).

that got me thinking. in what other areas might my current/future balance be out of whack?

*side note: introspection, speaking/assessing needs, etc. can be a very tricky business bc you can very easily end up spending more time 'thinking about not thinking', 'game-planning', etc. than you spend actually doing things; such that you are actually thinking and doing more.* 

*another side note: per the above side note, i've developed (but having fully tested/implemented) a strategy i call 'wandering around', where the idea is that, for anything that i can* ***see*** *needs to be done, it may be better to just have a single 'wander around' task at the bottom of my whiteboard instead of cluttering it with things that i can see or will otherwise automatically 'collide' with bc it's in an 'intersection', etc.; the idea being that i can easily spend more time writing down/tracking/being distracted by/overthinking things than just doing them! additionally, the few times i've had 'permission' to just meander around the house and address whatever and go down whatever rabbit holes has been really fun! and bonus points if all these things are 'never criticals' and thus no damage will be done if i don't perfectly/efficiently complete them or complete them at all!*

back on topic...

...so, for a month or two, i let (forced) the pendulum swing to the other extreme and, whenever possible, 'denied' my future self / left things for my future self to do.

of course i can't think of many examples but as they occur to me i may come back here to list some or do a dedicated post.

and (while not the best example, it's a valid one) one example is cooking rice. like i do with chicken, i use to feel like i need cook rice the day before i use it so that's it's available so i don't have to worry about it when i need it.

*side note: this works for chicken bc having the chicken (i bake several days worth in advance) chilled overnight in the fridge makes it easy to carve (and i carve it all at once).*

...but it turns out that rice was a perfect candidate for my 'backloading' experiment (another term i use is 'JIT' for 'just in time') bc 1) i have time to cook rice at lunch, 2) i can immediately eat it after cooking when it's warm (vs chicken that i like to cool overnight > carve) and 3) it will last a day longer bc when i cook it a day early i'm just 'burning' 'perish' time.

*note: in case helpful to understand the above, i should point out that i use rice for lunch; not for dinner.*

...and there are perhaps dozens more example insights/changes i've made to my modus operandi based on my experiences with / learnings from 'exaggerated backloading'.

...and it may not surprise you that this also ended up being 'grist for my mill' vis a via development/discovery of new 'cue' techniques bc intentionally/artificially/arbitrarily delaying things meant that memory encoding/storage/recall techniques were going to be a workout.

*side note: i can't emphasize the importance of 'paying attention' and giving yourself time and 'permission' to* ***invest in*** *figuring yourself out and figuring out your brain. and throwing yourself curve balls like anti-future bias or anything you can do the 'shake things up' or experiment/test will inevitably result in serendipity/discovery/life improvement.*

*another side note i can resist: ...and one of the (many) primary reasons i decided not to medicate is bc i wanted to* ***experience*** *all the things i needed to solve for that i might not experience with medication. i can always take medication later if i need to but (counterintuitively) i'll be able to build a better system/solutions if i can have all the 'use cases' for such system and also i'd never know if a system could preclude medication if i only develop what i need while medicated.*

ok so i thinks that's enough for now but i also want to point out that, while i used 'extreme backloading' for this experiment, **'regular**' backloading is still very much in use, e.g. backload/JIT'ing rice is now a 'thing'.

...and, ***SUPER IMPORTANTLY***, the opposite of back-loading is front-loading and, so often, the future is just so murky compared to the clarity of the moment and it's INSANE how many things will work themselves out and/or how many things can change that we just don't anticipate/remember, like the weather!

...and this is so true for me (or AHDH vs NTs) b/c, for example as i mentioned above, i miss SO MANY THINGS, like how i almost always need the trash can while i'm in the kitchen.

the future involves too many variables and many of the variables we think are involved in the future are irrelevant while we miss some that ARE relevant, like the weather.

...so i strongly recommend experimenting/delaying things, especially things that are not going to result in any damage if forgotten or not perfectly optimized. DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1,1744027670.0,Non_Medical_ADHD,0,1.0,False

Anyway, that wasn't too bad, I was still wired pretty late but the next day is when I messed up. Because of the lack of sleep I wanted the coffee.

I am 30F, endomorph body type, I feel I have a super slow metabolism. I currently weigh 87 kgs (April '25) last year April I was 105 kgs, I lost 15ish kgs in 2024 from April to September by doing intermittent fasting, eating low carb diet, using my fitnesspal to count my calories and  sticking to them, I was in calorie deficit for about 4-5 months with that I was doing HIIT workouts 4-5 days a week, it was hard but I was determined, then I fractured my toe in September 2024 and my doctor told me not to workout for a 4-8 weeks, I stopped working out and also stopped counting my calories because honestly it was pretty difficult to do it. Slowly I started eye balling stuff I was eating and not exactly measuring everything I was eating, then I travelled back home and ate out pretty frequently (Dec 2024) came back and I had gained 3-5 kgs within a month of eating out. Since January I am struggling to go back to HIIT workouts or just working out in general, I have recently started walking in place, I don't have too much space inside my house to workout and also difficult to get out of the house due to the weather. So I just walk/jog in place for 30-40 mins 4-5 times a week, it has only been a month.

Last I weighed myself in January 2025 and I was 89 and now in April 2025 I am 87, I don't understand if it is because of the stress I am taking or my diet which I like to believe is low in carbs, I eat twice a day, breakfast at 2pm (2 eggs with avocado and 1 bagel and a coffee with milk and Stevia in it, then Dinner at 7:30pm ISH most bulgur/quinoa/couscous with grilled chicken pieces and green beans, carrots with sauteed potatoes) that is mostly what I eat 4/7 days a week, I only eat out once in two weeks. 

I have been trying to seek therapy because of my bad habits of wanting to eat dessert and over eat dessert especially brownies or something with chocolate in it after dinner, it is difficult but I think mostly I am able to control myself and not have a dessert regularly. I sometimes eat without a reason as well even when I'm not craving sweets.

As my cycle changes, there are days when I crave sweets more than usual and eat more than usual, sometimes not eating sweets on those days makes me feel so bad and until and unless I dont eat a dessert I keep feeling low and really sad, my therapist says I have some trauma when it comes to food and I might have some incident or bad memories attached to it and maybe I eat to overcome boredom/stress, I do feel happy about the fact that last year I lost 15 kgs in 4-5 months, but now I feel stuck. I have also been trying to conceive but the gynaecologist told me that it's my weight that's causing issues. I am pretty stressed because I want to lose weight asap so I can conceive naturally.

I have been taking oxyshred as a pre workout for a month not sure if it is helping, I do understand the issue with me might be that I am not consistent all the time and now more than ever I am finding it hard to go for HIIT or intense workouts, I am not able to push myself to do anything more than on spot jogging/walking. I really want to lose weight but I don't understand is it that I am not motivated enough or what? Please help me. I am so tired honestly, I have been overweight for most of my life and it has shattered my confidence in more ways that I can ever imagine! I can't bring myself back to counting ever calorie I am eating. Also I do my on spot jogging/walking on an empty stomach so should I be drinking Oxyshred? Would that mess up my intermittent fasting as it has 21 calories?

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I‚Äôm really not interested I don‚Äôt know why some have to be so rude on here 

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don‚Äôt work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I‚Äôve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I‚Äôd never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I‚Äôd prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don‚Äôt wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don‚Äôt just say hi or hello I‚Äôm unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

Day one: I‚Äôm cutting through some backstreets on my way to the gig, looking at my phone for directions. Out of nowhere, some little sh\*t on an e-bike tries to snatch it. Instinct kicks in and I chase him (which was extremely dumb in hindsight‚Äîthese London kids can‚Äôt even fight without a kitchen knife or a machete). But let‚Äôs be real: he‚Äôs on a bike, I‚Äôm on foot, and this is London, not an action film.

I‚Äôm fuming. For a split second, I consider reactivating my X-formerly-known-as-Twitter account just to scream into the void. I don‚Äôt. But I want to.

I work events, but today I finish ‚Äúearly‚Äù (9pm). I‚Äôve got bar gear to drop off before heading to my Airbnb, so I ask the Uber driver if I can add a stop‚Äîhe says yeah, I add it in the app, all good. We get to the drop-off, I hop out with a box, and by the time I turn around‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs GONE. Just vanished. My bag‚Äîwith wallet, charger, clothes, etc.‚Äîstill in the car.

Phone‚Äôs dying. Uber app is useless. Support says they‚Äôve logged the case and will contact me within 48 hours. Mate, I‚Äôve got 12% battery and no jacket.

Eventually, after 30 minutes and multiple support calls, they finally put me in touch. The guy turns up 10 minutes later, no apology, nothing. Just a blank stare.

I ask him to take me to the second address‚Äîliterally a five-minute drive.  
‚ÄúYou need to rebook through the app.‚Äù  
What happened to, ‚ÄúSorry about that, mate, let me just drop you off‚Äîon the house‚Äù? Maybe I‚Äôm from another era.

I get to my Airbnb. No answer. Host stops replying. Phone number? Disconnected. I contact Airbnb support‚ÄîCecile joins the chat: ‚ÄúSorry for the inconvenience, we‚Äôve messaged and emailed her. Please wait.‚Äù

I end up sleeping on a sofa at a warehouse belonging to the events company I‚Äôm working with the next morning. Classy.

At 3am, the host suddenly blows up my phone:  
‚ÄúDid you check in? My father was waiting. Why did you leave??‚Äù

Gaslighting 101. I tell her to reread our convo where she confirmed everything. She goes quiet, then offers a refund.

Airbnb, in their infinite generosity, offers me a compensation in the form of an ¬£8 voucher. I ghost them. They bump it to ¬£20. Still not enough to cover therapy.

Later the next day, I finally get on my train‚Äîonly to find every empty seat ‚Äúreserved‚Äù by someone‚Äôs f\*\*\*ing tote bag. Truly the cherry on top.

So yeah, I‚Äôve declared economic sanctions on London.

No more ¬£8 sandwiches. No more overpriced coffees. No more Airbnbs or Ubers. I bring my own sandwiches now‚Äîlocal sourdough with my dad‚Äôs smoked ham. I carry a flask of tea. I travel with a Wacaco Minipresso. I walk or cycle everywhere. I couch surf. My car has a bed.",0,1744027128.0,london,10,0.34,False
1jtjhbf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jtjhbf,All-in-One Modular Dashboard - Your Personal Data Hub (Offline-First),"Hey Reddit!

I wanted to share a tool I've been developing that might solve a common problem many of us face: fragmented information and digital overwhelm.



I've built a modular smart dashboard that consolidates data feeds, tools, analytics, and even entertainment in one offline-first platform. Think of it as your personal command center that:

\- Works primarily offline with only punctual internet connections needed to refresh data

\- Aggregates content from multiple sources (Reddit, RSS feeds, Steam, news, weather, etc.)

\- Lets you analyze collected data using SQL queries directly within the app

\- Features today 20+ customizable modules (expanding to 100+ when i'll find time, inspiration and having continuous friends/collegues feedback)

\- Includes a smart note system that can reference and link to any of your collected data (a Reddit post, a news from the rss feed, a steam game...)

\- Offers a Tamagotchi-like companion that responds to your actual behavior patterns (why not a sim-companion that will gain strength and xp through ""your"" journey)

\- Supports multiple themes including Matrix, Dark Pink, and more visual options

\- For my test, i virtually managed 3 sizes (smartphone/tablet/desktop) and 2 positions (vertical/horizontal)but the desktop app would better be a responsive window



The key differentiator: Unlike most dashboards that require constant connection to cloud services, this one stores and processes data locally, putting you in control of your information.

My Background & Why I Built This

I'm a data analyst/engineer on behavior analytics (Google Analytics, PowerBI, BigQuery, Snowflake, etc.) Like many of you, I grew tired of jumping between different apps and websites just to check basic information.

Like many of you, i got a Gameboy, an access to family computer, my own phone, my own smartphone, my own personnal computer and then unlimited access to information, data, softwares and else.

Growing up with limited resources (I remember downloading VGBA in middle school because I couldn't afford a lot of GB and GBA cartridges), I learned to make technology work for me instead of the other way around. This dashboard is the culmination of that philosophy - technology that serves you efficiently without unnecessary subscriptions or data sharing.

I think it can help some others like survivalists, people overwhelmed by information and ads on internet, workers having only a little time to gather as much information or entertainment , Streamers wanting to have a single app to gather all interesting topics instead of dozen of tabs in the browser, even your own grandma to help her be connected without being as much agile with modern tools than us, redditers.





Use Cases I've Built For:

\- Data analysts who want to blend personal and professional data

\- Privacy-conscious users who prefer local data processing

\- Productivity enthusiasts who need information at their fingertips

\- People with limited/intermittent internet access

\- Anyone tired of subscription fatigue who wants one tool that does many things



What's Next

I'm considering transforming this proof-of-concept into a polished v1 and selling it as a one-time purchase on Steam (similar to Wallpaper Engine) for a few dollars or selling custom complex dashboard for companies and marketing teams.

Today i specifically choose to not use video components or audio sounds but it can be also good to include a youtube feed without recommandations or ads, a spotify account linked using the api, a radio player maybe a twitch integrtation etc...

Would you be interested in a tool like this? What modules would you want to see included in the 100+ I'm planning to build? Any specific data sources, valuable offline elements or integrations that would make this valuable to you? ",1,1744027122.0,ProductivityApps,0,1.0,False

I am 30F, I currently weigh 87 kgs (April '25) last year April I was 105 kgs, I lost 15ish kgs in 2024 from April to September by doing intermittent fasting, eating low carb diet, using my fitnesspal to count my calories and  sticking to them, I was in calorie deficit for about 4-5 months with that I was doing HIIT workouts 4-5 days a week, it was hard but I was determined, then I fractured my toe in September 2024 and my doctor told me not to workout for a 4-8 weeks, I stopped working out and also stopped counting my calories because honestly it was pretty difficult to do it. Slowly I started eye balling stuff I was eating and not exactly measuring everything I was eating, then I travelled back home and ate out pretty frequently (Dec 2024) came back and I had gained 3-5 kgs within a month of eating out. Since January I am struggling to go back to HIIT workouts or just working out in general, I have recently started walking in place, I don't have too much space inside my house to workout and also difficult to get out of the house due to the weather. So I just walk/jog in place for 30-40 mins 4-5 times a week, it has only been a month.

Last I weighed myself in January 2025 and I was 89 and now in April 2025 I am 87, I don't understand if it is because of the stress I am taking or my diet which I like to believe is low in carbs, I eat twice a day, breakfast at 2pm (2 eggs with avocado and 1 bagel and a coffee with milk and Stevia in it, then Dinner at 7:30pm ISH most bulgur/quinoa/couscous with grilled chicken pieces and green beans, carrots with sauteed potatoes) that is mostly what I eat 4/7 days a week, I only eat out once in two weeks. 

I have been trying to seek therapy because of my bad habits of wanting to eat dessert and over eat dessert especially brownies or something with chocolate in it after dinner, it is difficult but I think mostly I am able to control myself and not have a dessert regularly. I sometimes eat without a reason as well even when I'm not craving sweets.

As my cycle changes, there are days when I crave sweets more than usual and eat more than usual, sometimes not eating sweets on those days makes me feel so bad and until and unless I dont eat a dessert I keep feeling low and really sad, my therapist says I have some trauma when it comes to food and I might have some incident or bad memories attached to it and maybe I eat to overcome boredom/stress, I do feel happy about the fact that last year I lost 15 kgs in 4-5 months, but now I feel stuck. I have also been trying to conceive but the gynaecologist told me that it's my weight that's causing issues. I am pretty stressed because I want to lose weight asap so I can conceive naturally.

I have been taking oxyshred as a pre workout for a month not sure if it is helping, I do understand the issue with me might be that I am not consistent all the time and now more than ever I am finding it hard to go for HIIT or intense workouts, I am not able to push myself to do anything more than on spot jogging/walking. I really want to lose weight but I don't understand is it that I am not motivated enough or what? Please help me. I am so tired honestly, I have been overweight for most of my life and it has shattered my confidence in more ways that I can ever imagine! I can't bring myself back to counting ever calorie I am eating. Also I do my on spot jogging/walking on an empty stomach so should I be drinking Oxyshred? Would that mess up my intermittent fasting as it has 21 calories? 

I feel like I really want to lose weight but am I not motivated enough which is why I can't do HIIT or other intense workouts? Would only walking/jogging on spot help me lose weight, I am so lost honestly.",1,1744027094.0,loseweight,0,1.0,False

I enjoyed my time here as u/lovlog. Writing, deleting and writing again. I've had some wholesome conversations with people I met on this sub, the ones that genuinely tried to make me feel better and heard me when I couldn't even string words together well.  
  
If we've ever spoken - thank you. If you've just quietly read something I wrote - thank you, too.  
  
I just wanted to express my gratitude. Unknowingly, in everyday life, we touch many lives, with our words, actions, and sometimes just presence. Most of you had only made kind impressions.  
  
I really hope your pillow remains cool on both sides, your coffee (or tea) stays warm till you finish it and skies are pleasant wherever you are. Live well. Be the person you promised (yourself) to be.

1jtjf33,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jtjf33/the_man_in_the_mirror_isnt_me/,The Man in the Mirror Isn‚Äôt Me,"One might consider it an irrational fear, but I have always wondered if I am the same person in the morning as the one who went to sleep the night before. When I close my eyes, it feels like a blink that severs time‚Äîhours slipping away, lost to the void of sleep. What happens during those forgotten moments?

The bathroom light flickers on as I sloth-walk inside. Wrapping my hands around the cool porcelain sink, I stare into the face looking back at me in the mirror, holding my gaze with it. Long shadows stretch from its brow, shrouding the finer details of its face. I tilt my head to the left‚Äîit follows, perfectly in sync‚Äîbut a part of me feels it lingers behind. Like watching a movie with the dialogue just slightly delayed.

I pull my comb from the glass cup on the left side of the tap, sculpting my hair like the hands of the maker. The movements seem like mine, yet they feel rehearsed.

Gently, I begin brushing my teeth. My eyes track the reflection‚Äôs, trying to catch the person behind the glass off guard. I gargle and spit out the remnants of the paste, cracking a smile into my expression. The stranger mimics me too, but it doesn‚Äôt quite fit.

Slowly, I inch out of the bathroom, dragging my feet across the carpeted floor‚Äîits beige fluff leaving footprints behind me like trampling through snow. Just at the edge of my peripherals, I notice a picture frame: my wife and me, standing in front of the ocean upon the shimmering beaches of the southern sea. Her golden blonde hair seems to blow in a non-existent wind, with a smile brighter than the summer sun we had stood beneath that day. The picture is the only warmth offered in the cold, unlit room with curtains perpetually drawn.

‚ÄúHas it really been a year?‚Äù I whisper to myself before stepping through the front door. ‚ÄúA year since she left?‚Äù

A flash of yellow from the car‚Äôs headlights stretches across the driveway as I walk toward it, illuminating my path like a ship at sea guided by a lonely lighthouse. I open the door and climb inside, turning the key to awaken the sleeping metal bull. As it rises from its peaceful rest, the radio springs to life alongside it, filling the silence. I turn the volume up, drowning out thoughts of her with the chatter of the morning hosts.

Driving to work would pressure even a saint into a scornful rage. This system, this automaton we all turn for like cogs in a machine, feels built more like a torturer‚Äôs dungeon. And this‚Äîthis labyrinth of twisted roads, with cars screeching like insects, crawling over each other to reach their desired destinations‚Äîthis is the hell we endure every day. Until the moment we are lowered into the eternal embrace of our mother earth.

The mindless act of pressing the brake pad up and down propels me into the chasm of thought‚Äîan escape from the massacre of the soul. My body and I remain at a distance, tethered by an invisible thread. Out of the corner of my eye, I see a man staring at me, yanking me back into reality. His gaze is unshakable. His eyes never blink. Not a single glimmer of humanity ripples across his stiff face‚Äîno twitch, no subtle movement of muscle. A personified statue wrapped in human skin is the best I can describe. I rotate my head away, cutting him from view‚Äîonly to be met by another man. And a woman, side by side. Sharing the same face as the man beside me. Their jaws hang open, as if they are screaming, but no sound emanates.

The traffic light flips to green. I floor the accelerator, launching the vehicle forward, doing my best to forget the ethereal encounter.

Eventually, I arrive at work, put my car into park, and practically run for the office. My shirt clings to my back, soaked with sweat from the car seat as I enter. Overhead, the fluorescent lights buzz like a swarm of irritated wasps. The office reeks of burnt coffee and cheap imitations of expensive perfume. As I walk through the workspace‚Äîwith chairs neatly rowed on either side, shaped like eggs laid by some monstrous prehistoric bird‚Äîthe company receptionist sits before me, tapping away at her keyboard.

She pulls her attention from the ghostly glow of the monitor, her eyes catching mine, the faint text of an email list reflected in the lower part of her glasses.

‚ÄúGood morning, Miles. How‚Äôre you doing today?‚Äù she asks, her tone an exact replica of the day before. High-pitched, unlike her actual voice.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing alright. Hanging in there,‚Äù I reply, forcing the words through a strained throat.

She leans back in her chair, rotating slightly, tilting her head to the left while clasping her hands together.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good to hear. Interesting weather we‚Äôre having, hey? The clouds are so dark and eerie. Wouldn‚Äôt you say?‚Äù

‚ÄúMuch like the rest of this place. It‚Äôs like walking into a crypt,‚Äù I respond‚Äîmy tone harsher than intended.

She giggles‚Äîwhether out of politeness or sincerity, I can‚Äôt say.

I walk past her. Faces pass me by‚Äîfamiliar, yet as distant as strangers brushing past on the street. I know the occupants of this building about as well as they know me. Which is to say: not at all.

A translucent kettle greets me in the kitchen‚Äîalready filled with water. I flick it on like a light switch, summoning a blue glow from within. As the temperature begins to rise, I reach for my mug in its usual corner of the cupboard. It stands out among the others, printed with an image of my dog: a wire fox terrier, looking like a heap of snow shoveled to the side in the dead of winter. He wears a bright red collar‚Äîa gift from my wife‚Äîadorned with a diamond-shaped tag, like a medal of the highest honor.

I pour the coffee into my beloved cup and head up the towering staircase to the company‚Äôs main office space.

Booting up my laptop, I watch as it wakes alongside me, the coffee beginning to take effect. The slump of morning starts to fade, the fog in my mind replaced by a thought train with clear rails ahead.

The door behind me clicks open. My manager walks in and comes to my side.

‚ÄúHey Miles, how‚Äôre you doing today?‚Äù he says, with an exaggerated smile.

‚ÄúGood, good. Nothing I can necessarily complain about.‚Äù

He offers his hand, and from my seated position, I grip it. His eyebrow twitches slightly, pressing against the muscles in his forehead before he turns away, retreating to his wall of stark black monitors. From there, he watches me like an all-seeing eldritch horror.

‚ÄúRemember, we‚Äôre being pressed for those new illustrations. So I need you to push them out. We‚Äôve got more things cooking in the back. And we can‚Äôt have you messing around anymore. Understood?‚Äù he says, hidden behind his fortress, barking orders like a mad king commanding his servants.

I feel the heat beneath my skin rise‚Äîbut quickly, I smother the fire before it spreads.

‚ÄúNot here. Not now. It‚Äôs not the time or place,‚Äù I mutter to myself.

The rest of my co-workers begin to trickle in, one by one. All offering the same good mornings. All echoing my manager, down to the exact mannerisms. Savoring that same condescending tone.

Finally, the parade of greetings and handshakes dies down, allowing me to turn back and continue my work in peace.

Hours creep by, dragging themselves into what feels like weeks. Not a word exchanged between me and anyone else‚Äîjust the way I prefer it. And yet, guilt drips in slowly, whispering that I‚Äôll never truly know the person seated right beside me.

Eventually‚Äîafter what feels like years‚Äîthe hands of the clock reach up to lunch hour. Like cattle, we all rise from our seats, shuffling into the kitchen to retrieve our meals, tracing the footprints carved out by yesterday‚Äôs rut.

I retrieve my pasta from the cold, low-humming fridge and turn to sit at the counter, listening to the flow of ordinary, monotonous conversation.

‚ÄúSo how is your cat doing today?‚Äù one smartly dressed woman says to another.

‚ÄúOh, you know, same grouchy energy as usual,‚Äù the other replies.

‚ÄúStill wearing that cone around its head?‚Äù the first asks, flicking her curled hair behind her back. It falls perfectly into place, forming bronze rings and silver tunnels.

‚ÄúYeah. Always knocking into doorways,‚Äù the second says. ‚ÄúWhere did you get your hair done, by the way?‚Äù

The first woman ignites to life.

‚ÄúWell, you know Jenner from across the street, right? Well, she‚Äî‚Äù

Their voices begin to blur together, transforming into something unintelligible‚Äîjust noise filling the space. But it keeps my mind distracted as I chomp away at my nearly week-old pasta. It tastes plain. The grated cheese masks it somewhat, but the lack of seasoning is obvious. Still, I keep chewing, watching the pasta slowly vanish, piece by piece.

My mind drifts away from the scripted dialogue of the two women, returning to the memory of the staring man. His unblinking gaze. It still makes no sense‚Äîwhy would he do that? It was like he was peering into my soul. Judging every thought. The ones I had then, and even the ones from a year ago. I don‚Äôt know how I received that impression, but it just seemed to click.

Lingering on the thought,I lifted my fork, stabbed the final piece of pasta, and gently raised it to my mouth.

‚ÄúHey, Miles‚Ä¶‚Äù

The sound of my name wrapped around me like fishhooks sinking into bait‚Äîfamiliar, unwanted. I set my fork down, slow and steady, not bothering to turn toward the voice. I already knew what was coming. Same hour, same questions.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôve you been?‚Äù The bronze-haired woman‚Äôs voice rang clear. Soft, careful. Sincerity dripping from every syllable.

‚ÄúAlright, I guess.‚Äù

A simple question. Deserving of an equally simple answer.

‚ÄúGood. That‚Äôs excellent. Just making sure. Because‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been a year since‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease, don‚Äôt,‚Äù I snapped, the words hissing out between gritted teeth.

She stiffened. Lips pressed into a thin, downward line. ‚ÄúOh. Okay‚Ä¶‚Äù

The distance between us thickened, bloated. A mangled corpse of conversation lay in the space we shared. The overhead lights buzzed, filling the silence with artificial static.

My gut twisted. Too late, I realized the sharpness in my tone.

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I offered, voice drained. Like I was running on fumes. ‚ÄúIt was just‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd rather not think about it. You know? It was better that way.‚Äù

She gave a small nod. Her face softened, warmth returning to it, and just like that, the room felt a shade brighter.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright. I can imagine it was quite a cross to bear.‚Äù

‚ÄúSometimes,‚Äù I thought. ‚ÄúThe weight of it was much too difficult to uphold.‚Äù

But I kept that part to myself.

Eventually, the day dragged itself to a close. We gathered our things, each of us retreating to our cars like tired ants trailing home.

On the drive, I caught myself peering into every passing window. Searching. Still haunted by the image of the man who had stared‚Äîunblinking, unsettling. A trespasser lingering in the background of my mind.

At every red light, I checked my phone. Nothing. No texts. No pings. Not even an emoji from a coworker. Just blankness.

Strangers again.

The light shifted to green. My foot slammed down heavier than I intended. My body moved faster than my mind could course-correct.

When I arrived, the sky had shifted from dark morning to darker night. The kind of black that felt like a mountain standing between earth and moon. No silver light. No stars. Just absence.

I stepped inside. The lounge greeted me like an echo chamber. Walls that once bounced with her laughter now trapped me in silence.

I was a prisoner here. And yet, I returned to my cell every single night.

Like a dead satellite, I drifted across the room, crashing down onto the fold-out couch.

The TV was already blaring‚ÄîSeason 13 of *The Rickets*. My favorite sitcom.

I could quote the lines before they left the characters‚Äô mouths.

The crowd laughed where they were supposed to.

But I only laughed in the spaces between. Those awkward beats between laugh tracks‚Äîthose were the only moments that got me.

The glow of the television danced against the walls, flashing in shifts of color‚Äîblue, red, yellow. Like a slideshow.

Part of it was blocked out by my shadow. My silhouette, laughing alone.

Then a sharp yelp from Bella.

Right.

‚ÄúOh no. How could I forget about you?‚Äù I whispered. A smile crept across my face, uninvited but welcome. ‚ÄúYou were her gift to me.‚Äù

I reached down and scratched behind her clipped ear. Poor Bella. Too brave for her own good‚Äîalways thinking she could take on anything, no matter the size. That jagged scar where her ear ended would never let me forget.

I rose from the couch, slow, and walked to the kitchen to feed her.

‚ÄúSometimes,‚Äù I said as she started munching, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd make it through another day if it weren‚Äôt for you.‚Äù I paused to sniff, building a dam wall to stop the flood of tears from bursting out.

‚ÄúI get to say whatever I want, and you don‚Äôt judge me. You don‚Äôt understand, of course. But that wasn‚Äôt the point, really, was it.‚Äù I stopped scratching the back of her neck. Let my arm hover just above her.

‚ÄúI remembered the day she left. She was sitting‚Ä¶‚Äù I moved my hand to point towards the couch.

‚Äú‚Ä¶ there. Unmoving. Unblinking. There was a stillness to her that was almost uncanny.‚Äù

A smile raised my cheeks, though its intent wasn‚Äôt happiness. My eyes squeezed to slits. Tears collected, then spilled.

‚ÄúI saw a man today. You know. He also‚Ä¶‚Äù

More tears streaked down to the bottom of my chin. Dripped off like a leaking tap. Merged into the mat below.

‚Äú‚Ä¶ shared the same face she had that night.‚Äù

My jaw opened, as if to let out a cry. But it was silent. Not wishing to be released.

‚ÄúIt sounded ridiculous when I said it out loud.‚Äù I closed my mouth. ‚ÄúI hoped I wasn‚Äôt beginning to lose it, Bella.‚Äù I chuckled slightly, releasing the tension building in my muscles.

‚ÄúThat wouldn‚Äôt be good for either of us, now would it.‚Äù I chuckled again, but stopped just as quickly.

However, saying it aloud felt like confession. And that night, Bella was my church.

After feeding her and giving her water, I walked toward the bed and placed myself gently into its sheath. I rolled over to her side. Empty. Cold. The warmth of her body now existed only in memory. I held the pillow closest to me‚Äîonce hers‚Äîclutching it as if memory could turn fabric into flesh.

We used to drift off to sleep together like this.

Now I just drifted.

I got up. And went to sleep.

The alarm clock rang, dragging me from the subconscious plane. I ascended slowly‚Äîdelta, to theta, to alpha. Consciousness took hold. I turned in place. The space beside me was still empty, just as it had been yesterday.

I wished I had awakened to find it was all a dream. That I‚Äôd been locked in some cruel nightmare, and there was another version of me, in another life, still waking up beside her. Still seeing the calming look of her face.

I ran through my morning routine. I hopped into the shower‚Äîand immediately twisted away as arctic water beaded down my back. I lurched out of the glass-encased stall.

‚ÄúDid I forget to turn the geyser on?‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúI never forgot to do it.‚Äù

I wiped the wet chill from my hair, looking into the mirror. The stranger stared back. I reached for my comb‚Äîonly to find it on the right side of the tap. It was always on the left.

‚ÄúStrange,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember moving it.‚Äù

A moment passed. Then something else broke the morning pattern. The photo of my wife and me at the beach was facing the wrong direction. Tilted‚Äîalmost turned completely around. And the carpet below felt thinner. The threads seemed shorter. A minor detail. But one I couldn‚Äôt unsee.

Driving to work, my foot tapped the brake at each intersection, my body moving on autopilot. I avoided looking at the windows or mirrors. For fear that face would return‚Äîthe one I‚Äôd seen yesterday. The one that wasn‚Äôt mine.

I arrived. Greeted the receptionist with the same smile I‚Äôd offered yesterday. Walked the same path to the kitchen. I opened the cupboard. My cup was there‚Äîbut off-center. I picked it up and tilted it. Faded remains of someone else's coffee slid down the inside, like wax trailing from a burned-out candle.

I turned sharply to one of the cleaners nearby.

‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúDid someone use my mug this morning?‚Äù

She scrunched her face like a sponge. ‚ÄúNo. Not that I‚Äôm aware of.‚Äù

I walked off. My heavy footsteps thudded through the silence. Each step landed with a thunderous echo, like I was stomping on the ceiling of another world.

I dropped into my seat in front of the computer. My fingers raked through damp hair. The monitor was already on. The keyboard was warm‚Äîlike someone had just been there. My heart skipped. My palms sweat.

Lightning-fast, I opened my emails. My messages. Socials. Everything. Nothing had been touched. All the unopened messages from family were still marked ‚Äúdelivered.‚Äù Emails, untouched. DMs unread. Everything still exactly as I‚Äôd left it.

‚ÄúMiles, how‚Äôre you today?‚Äù my manager asked, walking in. He mirrored the exact tone and posture from yesterday. Like a looping recording.

‚ÄúAlright, I guess,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúMy computer was on when I got in.‚Äù

‚ÄúHuh. That‚Äôs weird.‚Äù He paused. ‚ÄúMaybe you just forgot to turn it off. Happens to all of us.‚Äù

Maybe. But I never forgot to turn it off.

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù I lied.

He nodded. ‚ÄúAbout the items on your board‚ÄîI need them cleared today.‚Äù

‚ÄúOn it.‚Äù

He nodded again, too many times. ‚ÄúAlright. Good.‚Äù Then disappeared behind his wall of screens.

As the day continued, I couldn‚Äôt shake the thoughts. The geyser. The comb. The mug. The computer. It was all off. Slight, yes‚Äîbut wrong enough that it echoed. I replayed the moments in my head like scenes from a broken film reel‚Äîfront to back. Back to front. A creeping unease flowered inside me. Something was wrong. More than wrong. Unnatural.

It distracted me. Time began to warp. One moment, I was typing. The next, it was lunch.

We were all in the kitchen again. A sea of chatter and chewed pasta. I sat across from a glass-walled meeting room, barely tasting my food. 

The sounds of me crushing my food down to swallow slowly begin to change ‚Äî morphing into the mechanical beat of an oxygen machine. That sound. I know it too well. It‚Äôs carved into my psyche.

A memory:  
The room is silent, save for that soft, rhythmic hiss of the oxygen tank.

She‚Äôs asleep ‚Äî or something close to it.  
Eyes half-shut. Mouth slightly open.  
Her skin looks like old paper, pale and thin.  
I sit beside her bed, spoon in one hand, bowl of cold broth in the other.

‚ÄúOpen up,‚Äù I whisper, guiding the spoon toward her lips.

She turns her head away.

I sigh. Set the bowl down. Pinch the bridge of my nose.  
Everything aches. My eyes burn. I haven‚Äôt showered in‚Ä¶ three days? Maybe more.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve gotta eat something,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúYou have to. I can‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù

I stop.

The nightstand holds a row of pill bottles. Each name feels like a curse.  
A crumpled medication schedule sits beside them ‚Äî rewritten so many times I can‚Äôt read my own handwriting anymore.

Her breathing fills the room. Shallow. Ragged. Constant.  
Even music can‚Äôt drown it out anymore.

‚ÄúYou could at least pretend to try,‚Äù I mutter, immediately ashamed of how bitter it sounds.

She opens one eye. Just a sliver.  
A flicker of recognition? Or just a twitch?

I don‚Äôt know anymore.

I grab the washcloth from the bowl beside her, wring it out, and gently wipe her forehead. Her skin is cold. Damp. She flinches slightly.

‚ÄúYou never say thank you,‚Äù I whisper. Quieter now. ‚ÄúNot once.‚Äù

I pause.

‚ÄúI took leave from work. Missed Joey‚Äôs birthday. I sleep on the couch now because your moaning keeps me up. You know that?‚Äù

No answer. Her eyes are closed again.

The noise shifts from the beeps of the oxygen machine back to chewing.

I swallow.

My plate‚Äôs empty.

I push the chair back, rising to my feet.  
Beyond the silver-bronze-haired woman in the glassed-off meeting room, I see‚Äî

Her.

A woman staring at me through the glass.

My jaw tightened

She didn‚Äôt blink. I did‚Äîbut she didn‚Äôt. Her eyes were unbroken beams, burning into mine.

My breath stopped as the shape of her face came into focus. The cheekbones. The lips. The delicate curve of her brows.

She looked exactly like my wife.

Not similar. Not close.

Exactly.

I rose abruptly. My fork clattered. Pasta spilled to the floor like shredded flesh. Conversations stopped. Heads turned.

But I was locked on her face.

‚ÄúMiles. Are you okay?‚Äù a bronze-haired coworker asked gently, pulling me out of my trance.

I crouched, picking up the shattered plate with trembling hands.

The cleaner stepped forward. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, Miles. I‚Äôve got it.‚Äù

I looked up at her through the curtain of my hair.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my mess. I‚Äôll clean it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you step outside for a second? Get some air.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt reply. I just left.

Outside, I breathe. Four in. Hold for four. Four out. Hold again.

 Repeat.

 My heart rate begins to soften, barely.

 Then I see him.

 Across the parking lot, just beyond the fence.

 A figure. Standing still. Watching.

 The outline resolves into a face I remember.

 The man from yesterday.

 Frozen.

¬†Staring.

 I begin walking toward him. Each step faster than the last. His face comes into focus‚Äîglassy eyes, pale skin, mouth slightly open. Unmoving.

 ‚ÄúHey!‚Äù I shout. ‚ÄúHey! What‚Äôs your problem, man?! Why‚Äôre you watching me, huh?‚Äù

 He doesn‚Äôt flinch. Just stares. Hollow. As if waiting for something.

 ‚ÄúYou some sick voyeur? Is that it?!‚Äù

 Still no answer. But then‚Äîhis mouth opens.

¬†And moves.

 No sound escapes it.

 But I read his lips clearly.

 The realization of what he‚Äôs saying freezes my blood. My heart seems to stop. I stare into the abyss of death itself, before the shock surges down from my head to my feet, snapping me back into my body.

 I turn and sprint toward my car. Co-workers and other staff rush out, yelling after me.

 ‚ÄúMiles! What‚Äôs going on?!‚Äù one of them screams.

 I don‚Äôt answer. I climb into my car and slam the gas, tearing through the parking lot and merging onto the main road, leaving the area behind in a blur.

 I crash through the front door of my house. It‚Äôs darker inside than out. I flick the light on, flooding the room with harsh brightness.

As my eyes adjust, the first thing I see is my couch, flipped upside down‚Äîthe coffee table with it, everything that was on the table now lying on the floor beneath it, also upside down. My mind, incapable of processing what I‚Äôm seeing, begins to twist and turn, trying to bridge some kind of rational thought, but failing.

 As my eyes drift across the room, I realize everything is upside down. The television‚Äîperfectly balanced in the air, as if designed to sit that way. The kitchen too‚Äîthe fridge, the cupboards, even the damn handles. All of it, flipped.

 I move through the house, grabbing a butcher knife from the kitchen and clutching it so tightly that my knuckles‚Äîlike the rest of my body‚Äîbegin turning white. My mind buzzes with possibilities, each more terrifying than the last.

 Is someone stalking me? Have I been robbed?

 I move into my bedroom. The bed is completely rotated‚Äîthe mattress faces the floor, the blanket is buried beneath it, the frame crushing it even deeper into the wood. I turn every corner cautiously, expecting an armed burglar, a masked invader.

 With a shaking hand, I reach the cupboard and yank it open. I scream and begin stabbing into the dark interior‚Äîbut there's no one. Just shirts. Hanging upside down on their coat hangers.

 I soften my steps, creeping to the bathroom. Even the toothbrush holder is upside down. The bottles, the soap dish, the razors‚Äîgravity-defying as if I‚Äôm in a dream.

 I keep closing my eyes, waiting to open them up in the safety of my bed.

 But it‚Äôs still there. Flipped. Mocking me.

 My phone rings‚Äîthe sudden noise pierces the silence like a gunshot. I scream, grabbing it.

 My manager‚Äôs name glows on the screen.

 I answer.

 ‚ÄúHe-hello, Miles,‚Äù he says, stuttering slightly. ‚ÄúIs everything alright? You left so suddenly. Got everyone shaken up.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm not well right now. I just came home and found my whole place flipped upside down,‚Äù I say, wiping sweat‚Äîcool and slick like melted ice‚Äîoff my brow, and the tears running like raindrops from my eyes.

 ‚ÄúShit‚Ä¶‚Äù he mutters. Then, lowering his voice, softer now: ‚Äú...Has the place been ransacked?‚Äù

 ‚ÄúNo. Strangely‚Ä¶ everything is here. But it is all‚Äîquite literally‚Äîupside down.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúThat sounds completely absurd.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúWell. Imagine seeing it for yourself.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt if I tried. Look, Miles, why don‚Äôt you take a few days off? Get yourself right, then come back in next week. I feel you could use it. I understand it‚Äôs been a year since‚Äî‚Äù

 ‚ÄúI appreciate that,‚Äù I interrupt quickly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take you up on that.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúGood‚Ä¶ good. We‚Äôre all thinking of you. We‚Äôre concerned.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúScared of me, more like it,‚Äù I think, biting my tongue to keep it in.

 ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I say aloud, ending the call.

 As the line clicks dead, I hear something.

 Faint whimpering.

 Not human.

 A dog‚Äôs.

 Bella.

¬†I bolt toward the sound, racing down the hall. I find her under her bed, trembling like she‚Äôd seen a ghost. I flip the bed off her and cradle her against me, trying to calm her, whispering into her ears.

 But then‚Ä¶ something strange.

 My hand passes over her head‚Ä¶ then over her ears‚Ä¶ then into nothing.

 I do it again.

 And again.

 The clip in her ear. It‚Äôs not there.

 I freeze. My heart tightens.

 That‚Äôs not my dog.

 It looks exactly like her‚Äîsame coat, same collar‚Äîbut it isn‚Äôt Bella.

 Someone replaced her.

 I drop her.

 She hits the floor, then sprints out the open front door.

 ‚ÄúBella!‚Äù I scream, lunging after her.

 ‚ÄúBella!‚Äù

 I tear through the backyard, flinging the door open with such force it slams into the wall. I scream her name again, again, again.

 No response.

 I scour the garden. The bushes she‚Äôd hide in when she was sick. The patch under the stairs. The corner behind the trash bins. Nothing. No trace.

 I fling open the shed door‚Äîeven the shelves inside are upside down. But no Bella.

 Hours pass. I‚Äôve flipped the house back to normal as best I could. The couch had fought me. Everything fought me. But eventually, I collapsed into it‚Äîbreathless, broken, defeated. I scroll through my phone. I comb through every message I‚Äôve ever gotten. Months back. Random requests. Someone asking to borrow a tool. A ride. No threats. No clues. No sign of a stalker. Just normality. Plain, forgettable conversations. And yet‚Ä¶

¬†Someone replaced my dog.

 Why?

 I drop my phone. Bury my face in my hands, fists pressing into my knees.

 ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôve lost it,‚Äù I whisper. ‚ÄúThis is it. The precipice. The line between the sane and the insane‚Äîand I‚Äôm falling.‚Äù

 My mind unhinges from logic. Slipping into something darker. Something less reasonable.

 Am I in some kind of simulation? Did someone change the code while I was sleeping?

 Am I being haunted? A restless spirit?

¬†The pale, emotionless man flashes in my mind again.

 That could explain it. But why?

¬†And then I remember. His lips. The words he mouthed.

 And again, like before‚Ä¶ my blood freezes.

 ‚ÄúYou know what you did.‚Äù

 My eyes well up with tears. A cold, painful realization slides in like a blade through the ribs. I turn my head toward the seat next to me.

 The one my wife had been sitting in.

 One year ago.

 As I do, I see her. Sitting there, unmoving. Unblinking. Staring into space‚Äîinto the gaps between existence.

 Next to her, a mug‚Äîtipped over, contents long gone.

 ‚ÄúI remember you‚Äôd gotten sick,‚Äù I say quietly.

 ‚ÄúI remember taking care of you.‚Äù

 I rest my hand on her cold, bony shoulder.

 ‚ÄúYou were impossible. I had to take leave just to be there. But you were never grateful.‚Äù

¬†Her head begins to turn.

 ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt stand being around you‚Ä¶ but I had no choice.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúSo I just‚Ä¶ hurried the sickness along. I had to.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúI poisoned you.‚Äù

 Her mouth opens. A breath escapes‚Äîthick and fetid, like the inside of a rotting deer.

 I close my eyes.

 The stench vanishes.

 I open them again.

 She‚Äôs gone.

 The house‚Äîflipped right side up.

 Then, a bark.

 Through the hallway‚Äî

 Bella.

 I rush to the bathroom, splash cold water on my face. Tears blur my vision. I look up, meeting my own reflection. I run my hands through my hair, brushing it back to see clearly.

 Every detail of my face. Unshrouded.

 But just for a moment‚Ä¶ I swear the reflection lagged behind.",3,1744026902.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False
1jtjexv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jtjexv,A cake bowl AkA delicious fail,So this is my second time trying something from scratch. And I don‚Äôt know how it got here but I will call it an orange cake bowl. I tried to make a basic vanilla and chocolate cake with caramel and oranges and cherrys on the bottom. As i looked at it baking it was like a huge round dome. Then when i took it out and let it cool off it went down and I flipped it over and got this bowl thingy. Even tho it looks extra terrestrial. It was super yummy the lip is actually caramel and crunchy and the cake is strange to say the least but didn‚Äôt taste bad. Everyone ate some and thought it was scary to try but actually good hahaha. Has this cake bowl thing ever happened to you guys. I made everything from scratch and even boiled the oranges with some sugar and coconut oil at 1st then let the oranges dry out b4 I added them to the bottom and used all the good juice from that and infused it in my cake mix. For the chocolate part I just put a little cocoa powder with a little instant coffee. I put a bit of icing on the side and it did well with ice cream.My kids told me not to post this but what fun would that be if I didn‚Äôt show the internet my delicious fail. ,1,1744026890.0,Baking,0,1.0,False

1jtje3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/paypigsupportgroup/comments/1jtje3e/anyone_else_find_sending_allconsuming/,Anyone Else Find Sending... All-Consuming,"Hey all, using a burner account for this. Just wanted to see if anyone else relates. I started with findom a while back, just small sends, you know, $20 here, $50 there for a goddess's attention. But man, that feeling... it gets its hooks in you deep. It's not even about being 'ruined', it's just... the act of sending itself.

Now, it's like a constant background hum in my brain. See a new domme's post? Gotta send at least a coffee tribute. Get a DM? Feels wrong not to reply with cash. I've budgeted my actual life around sending. Made about $80k last year, decent job, but I reckon a good  10k of that just... evaporated into sends. Findommes mostly, but sometimes camgirls, sometimes just random girls online who give me a bit of attention if I CashApp them $100. Even got into sending to guys in battle groups, to make them force me to cum 300 a pop.

It's not like I'm homeless (yet?). Had plans for a down payment, that's gone. I know it's crazy, spending $500 over a weekend just for some online interactions and drains, but stopping feels... impossible? The dopamine hit from hitting 'send' and getting that acknowledgement, even if it's just an insult, is unreal. It just builds and builds and then all of a sudden I have a sudden completely emptying.... 

It‚Äôs like any other addiction, I guess. You know it's maybe not the 'smartest' use of money, you see the bank account dwindle, but the compulsion to just send more overrides everything. Anyone else just constantly thinking about their next send, who to send to, how much they can send? It‚Äôs taken over so much headspace. Wild.

Through out my 20's I had a best friend and was more than happy for her to take the spot light. I've always had one of two close friends, I prefer one or one rather than crowds. Fast forward to my 40's. I'm a home body, very happy with my own company, my husband and my fur babies. I get really really annoyed when people invite us out like say on a Saturday night. Ironically my husband is a social butterfly and don't get why I get angry. Then I get anxious thinking about all the people that's gonna be there and sometimes dont even want to get out of the car. Sometimes during a ""outing"" I get a out of body experience. Its a mixture between boredom, slight panic, zoning out and the fight or flight feeling. I even said out loud ""I want to leave"" during a brunch. My friend looked at me and asked me, sorry what did you say? I looked at her and was shocked I said it out loud, it should have been inside words. :)

I've also kinda alienated the couple of girlfriends I had, because NO i don't want to go get coffee or go to a movie or whatever, just LEAVE ME ALONE. I also want to mention what this situation became much worst since I started at a job where I have to interact with literally 100 people a day.

So, I'm sixteen female and I always thought that the teacher-student relationship is very important. It was always crucial to me, for teachers to treat students with respect and be nice to them (and vice versa). I always had trouble with making friends and I was bullied in my previous school, so I spent most of my time around my geography teacher, because we both loved travelling, so we would often talk about different places in the world (he was never inappropriate with me, he is not the problem in this post). Anyway, when I finished primary school and went to secondary school I immediately started having trouble with relationships (again) and now that I'm in second grade, people are mean to me and I only have two friends who I rarely talk to because they're either not at school or talking to people that are mean to me. My teacher (around 50 male) has always been viewed as the cool teacher that takes us on many trips and is really chill. Anyway, around October/November 2024 he started noticing that something is wrong (I was and still am heavily depressed and it showed) and so he started talking to me. Ever since then he makes me stay after class and he talks to me. The difference between him and my teacher in primary school, is that now he is the one who initiates the talks and not me. He doesn't set any boundaries, he pushes them. For example, on our last school trip, he took me to a coffee shop, and it wasn't an activity everyone did, he took me there privately and he bought me tea. Last week I was wearing a very revealing shirt and I expected him to tell me it's not allowed (he always does that with EVERY other girl) but even though we were talking alone, for about ten minutes, he didn't say anything about it. Today I was feeling really unwell (my stomach hurts and I'm really nauseous) and he stopped me after class and said a lot of things like ""I hope you feel better later."" And it really sounded weirdly caring (maybe I'm looking into it because I was groomed before). He even apologised me for reminding me about a test I need to take when I seemed upset by it. My friends say that he's just nice to me and I'm paranoid, but my aunt says that I should be careful around him because an adult shouldn't have this kind of relationship with a minor, let alone their students. 

So, is he grooming me? And if he is, what do I do? I am very scared of him taking advantage of me (because as I said I was groomed before), but I also don't want to drift away from him, because his support means a lot to me (since I'm depressed and I don't have many friends).

Penelope is finally at Uni with her long-time crush Colin, and things are going pretty well! He's in the same dorm as her and they even have weekly coffee chats. But then the events of a Halloween party lead Pen to realize that perhaps she needs to take matters into her own hands and tell Colin how she REALLY feels. Anonymously, of course.

While Pen tests the waters through sending him secret love notes, she also has a secret admirer of her own who keeps leaving her roses at her dorm room door. What leads from all of these secrets? And how will it result in Colin and Penelope finally sharing a perfect mistletoe kiss? Read on and find out...

Inspired by the plot and writing style of one of the Princess Diaries books; written entirely in texts, emails and blog posts. This 3-part Modern AU Christmas fluff will be fully released in the next week, and is the perfect cozy story to keep you warm and happy over the holidays.

In an attempt to win his best friend back after putting her reputation in jeopardy at the Featherington ball last season, Colin offers to help Penelope in her quest to find a husband. They meet every week in the privacy of his home for a set of lessons to boost her confidence when interacting with eligible gentlemen.

On Penelope's most recent visit, a mix-up in the kitchen has her accidentally consume a rather large portion of the tea he had acquired during his travels. While Colin desperately tries to ensure for her safety, Penelope appears to be determined to send him to an early grave as not only does she shake up his entire worldview with each new revelation, she would also not stop flirting with him, making it rather difficult to remember she was a lady and his friend.

* Dopamine
* Fanta
* Nextcheat
* Kernaim
* VX
* Ring-1
* Coffee
* Ancient
* ABS

Now, about **Escape from Tarkov (EFT)** ‚Äî same deal as with R6: **cheating in EFT is strictly against Battlestate Games' Terms of Service**, and their anti-cheat (BattlEye + other internal systems) hands out *HWID bans*, which are no joke.

But if you‚Äôre researching (or maybe working on a video script or mod idea), here‚Äôs a list of **common cheats** seen in the EFT community ‚Äî *strictly for educational/awareness purposes*

1. **Wallhacks / ESP**
   * See other players, scavs, bosses, loot, and extracts through walls.
   * Often color-coded to distinguish PMCs vs. AI.
2. **Aimbot / Silent Aim**
   * Auto-locks to heads or torsos even through walls.
   * *Silent aim* hits targets without even aiming at them visually.
3. **No Recoil / No Sway**
   * Removes gun kick and sway entirely, making every weapon feel like a laser beam.
4. **Speed Hack**
   * Boosts player movement, reloading, healing, and sometimes even raid time speed.
5. **Loot Through Walls**
   * Teleports items into your inventory without ever touching them physically.
   * Super broken‚Äîand easy to spot in replays.
6. **Fly Hack / Noclip**
   * Lets players fly or clip through walls, ceilings, and floors.
7. **Infinite Stamina / God Mode**
   * Run forever, carry unlimited gear weight, and resist all damage.
   * Rare in public cheats but seen in private builds.
8. **Radar Hack / External Radar**
   * Shows live positions of players, AI, and loot on a 2D or 3D map.
   * Harder to detect because it's external and doesn‚Äôt affect game files.
9. **Auto-Loot / Auto-Extract**
   * Automatically picks up high-value items and extracts you the second you‚Äôre full.
10. **Magic Bullet / Kill Aura**

* Bullets bend around corners or auto-kill anything within a certain radius.

# üß† Why Do People Cheat in EFT?

* The **risk/reward loot system** makes it emotionally brutal to lose gear.
* The **time investment per raid** makes people more likely to seek unfair shortcuts.
* The **in-game economy** is intense‚Äîsome even cheat to farm RMT (real-money trading), which Battlestate fights hard against.

This list is used strictly for educational purposes and to raise awareness or to help players recognize and avoid cheaters, not to encourage them to cheat.

I saw a few others doing this so why not.

Here is my current setup. I live in a small flat and there is no other way to have my turntable and speakers, so I made some mitigations!

The turntable, to digress, is an AT-LP3 set to the TF and AS 3:3 with an ATN 3600LE stylus. Those are KS Reunion speakers.

For my previous player (AT-LP60 with the same stylus most recently), I wanted to improve the sound and mitgate vibration so I used some old and disused IKEA shelves and some self adhesive furniture feet to construct a platform to dampen, followed by some adjustmentable foam studio isolation pads to help further.

It's made so much difference and I am much happier with it all now, as the limited space was becoming irritating. That, and it will keep me satiated until I have enough space to optimise further and upgrade.

Anyway, I thought this might useful for anyone who also has limited space.

And it really sounded weirdly caring (maybe I'm looking into it because I was groomed before). He even apologised me for reminding me about a test I need to take when I seemed upset by it. My friends say that he's just nice to me and I'm paranoid, but my aunt says that I should be careful around him because an adult shouldn't have this kind of relationship with a minor, let alone their students. 

So, is he grooming me? And if he is, what do I do? I am very scared of him taking advantage of me (because as I said I was groomed before), but I also don't want to drift away from him, because his support means a lot to me (since I'm depressed and I don't have many friends).",1,1744026237.0,needhelp,0,0.99,False

My Fellow Opus grinder started grinding super fine, got slower, and then *exploded* with a loud pop and burnt smell. 
Reaching out to the seller now ‚Äî wondering if anyone else had something similar happen?

---

Hey everyone,  
I wanted to share something pretty alarming that happened with our Fellow Opus grinder, and see if anyone here has experienced something similar.

We bought the grinder in December and started using it in January. It was used **only for espresso at home**, and always according to Fellow‚Äôs official instructions and YouTube tutorials.

In the first few weeks, it worked great ‚Äî grinding 18g shots in under 30 seconds on grind size 3, minimal retention, great results.

But over time, we started noticing more coffee retention and a complete failure of the anti-static function. So we began cleaning it daily, before or after each use. This helped a bit with the static, but not the retention. Still, it was usable.

Then yesterday, grind size 3 (which worked great before) suddenly started producing an extremely fine grind, took over a minute, and choked our espresso machine ‚Äî only 9g of output instead of the usual 36g. After reading online, we saw this was a common issue with this model, and many people recommended cleaning again or temporarily switching to a coarser setting. Most people said Fellow replaced their outer burr after reporting this.

So this morning, we cleaned the grinder again, adjusted to grind size 4, and tried a shot. Same issue ‚Äî still very slow, still overly fine, and still gave us only 9g. We tried grinding a second shot and that‚Äôs when it happened:

**A loud explosion came from inside the grinder.** There was a visible flash and a burning smell. Luckily no one was hurt, but it was seriously frightening. We immediately unplugged it and haven't used it since. I don‚Äôt think anything broke but we haven‚Äôt took it apart.

We‚Äôve contacted the shop we purchased it from, and are hoping they can help us through the warranty. But honestly, we‚Äôre hesitant to get the same model again ‚Äî while the *grind retention/static issues* seem common and well-documented, this **explosion** was unexpected and scary.

Has anyone here had a similar experience with the Opus, or any idea what could‚Äôve caused it?

I got ""mildly"" floxed in November 2024 after being prescribed Cipro (2x500mg for 10 days) for *suspected* bacterial epididymitis‚Äîeven though my urine test came back negative.

# Symptoms started during the course and got worse afterwards:

* Extreme anxiety ‚Äì I had to start taking benzodiazepines, which I‚Äôd never needed before. After realizing I was floxed, I found out that taking benzos was probably a big mistake. My healthcare provider said Cipro and benzos can be taken together, but I‚Äôve read otherwise since.
* Cold hands and feet ‚Äì My feet turned white if I wasn‚Äôt wearing socks.
* Eye flashing
* Muscle weakness in my hands
* Joint pain and popping
* General weakness
* Visible signs of collagen loss in my hands
* Lost 7kg of weight
* Dry mouth (mostly at night)

# After realizing I was floxed, I started taking the following supplements:

* Vitamin C ‚Äì 400mg
* Vitamin D ‚Äì 50¬µg
* Magnesium glycinate ‚Äì 150‚Äì200mg
* Rice protein
* Some probiotics
* Q10 (occasionally)
* Multivitamin (occasionally)

I‚Äôve also been on a gluten-free diet, with no coffee and no alcohol.

# Things got much better by February 2025‚Äîuntil I tried a course of Valacyclovir to treat some long-term, unexplained itching.

After starting it, I experienced a *major relapse*, with symptoms similar to the acute phase after Cipro‚Äîbut worse and much quicker:

* Joint pain and popping
* Couldn‚Äôt walk in a straight line
* Felt hot all over
* Joints were inflamed and hot

I stopped Valacyclovir after 3 days. But some new symptoms have stuck around since then:

* Decreased taste and smell
* Extreme dry mouth (sometimes dry nose and eyes too)

# After the acute phase in March 2025, I felt well enough to start exercising again:

I did light walks 3‚Äì4 times a week and hit the gym 1‚Äì2 times a week. But I started to notice that my muscles weren‚Äôt recovering. Things slowly got worse again:

* Muscle fatigue in my legs (feels like I‚Äôve run a marathon)
* Plantar fasciitis like symptoms
* Muscle weakness in my right hand
* Muscle twitching all over ‚Äì sometimes so strong they shake my whole body
* Cold hands and feet again

I‚Äôve now been resting for about two weeks and trying to get as much sleep as possible, but I‚Äôm not seeing any improvements.

# Bloodwork update:

* ANA titers were elevated: <200 (in my country this means it‚Äôs below 1:200)
* ENA panel was negative

# Fears:

I‚Äôm honestly really scared I‚Äôve developed a long-term autoimmune disease like Sj√∂gren‚Äôs (due to dry mouth, taste/smell changes, ANA elevation).  
Also really worried about something more serious like ALS (because of muscle twitching and general weakness).

**Has anyone been in a similar situation with this mix of symptoms?**

Also considering stopping *all* supplements to see if that helps, but now I‚Äôm on day 2 without anything and I feel way worse. Has anyone tried this?

Sugar ants may seem harmless at first. They‚Äôre small, unassuming creatures, but when they start to invade your home or business, they can quickly become a huge nuisance. As a homeowner in King County, WA, or a business owner managing a facility in one of the region‚Äôs bustling industrial areas, dealing with sugar ants is not only frustrating, but it can also lead to sanitation issues and potentially costly damage.

Having dealt with sugar ants myself in my own King County home, I know just how frustrating it can be. I remember waking up one morning to find tiny ants marching along my kitchen counter, trailing behind them a line of crumbs that had apparently attracted them overnight. The sight of them made my skin crawl, but what bothered me more was the feeling of helplessness I wasn‚Äôt sure how to stop the infestation. This experience led me to learn more about effective **sugar ant removal, control, extermination, and pest trapping** methods that can be used to rid my home of these persistent pests. Whether you're dealing with ants in a residential space or managing a commercial property, sugar ants are a common issue that can be controlled with the right approach.

Sugar Ants Exterminators we‚Äôll cover everything you need to know about **sugar ant removal**, how to **control** infestations, the benefits of **extermination services**, and how **pest trapping** and **sprays** can play a key role in tackling these tiny invaders.

# What Are Sugar Ants?

Before diving into the best ways to get rid of sugar ants, it's important to understand what they are. Sugar ants are a type of **odorous house ant** that tends to invade kitchens and homes in search of food, particularly sugary substances like honey, fruit, or crumbs. They‚Äôre very social insects, which is why when you see one ant, you‚Äôre often dealing with many more.

Sugar ants are typically small, measuring around 1/8 of an inch long, and their dark brown to black color makes them hard to spot at first. They have a distinctive, sweet odor when crushed, which is where the name ""sugar ant"" comes from. Their nests are often found in moist areas, such as inside walls, under flooring, or near plumbing, which makes them particularly tricky to eliminate.

# How to Recognize a Sugar Ant Infestation

It wasn‚Äôt until I saw an increasing number of sugar ants in my kitchen that I realized I had an infestation. Here are some common signs that you might be dealing with sugar ants:

* **Ant Trails**: One of the easiest ways to spot an infestation is by observing ant trails. Sugar ants leave visible trails to and from their nests, usually leading to food sources in your kitchen, pantry, or dining areas.
* **Visible Ants in Your Home**: If you see several ants roaming around your kitchen counters, bathroom sinks, or along walls, it's a clear sign that you have an ant problem. The ants will typically be looking for food or water sources.
* **Unexplained Crumbs or Debris**: Sugar ants are drawn to sugary substances, so you might notice them swarming around spilled juice, honey, or crumbs left on counters or floors.

# Why Sugar Ants Are Difficult to Control

Sugar ants can be tricky to control for a few reasons:

1. **Their Size**: Due to their tiny size, sugar ants are often able to find and infiltrate cracks or small openings in your home‚Äôs foundation or walls. They‚Äôre not picky about where they nest, making them hard to detect at first.
2. **Large Colonies**: Sugar ants live in large colonies, sometimes consisting of thousands of ants. This means that even if you manage to remove a few, there will likely be many more to replace them.
3. **Persistent Behavior**: If sugar ants find a food source, they‚Äôll continue to come back until it‚Äôs eliminated, and they‚Äôll bring more ants with them each time.

# Sugar Ant Removal: Methods That Actually Work

# DIY Methods for Sugar Ant Removal

There are a few DIY methods that can help you manage and even remove sugar ants. While these approaches can be effective in the short term, it‚Äôs essential to recognize that they may not address the root cause of the problem. Here's what I learned while trying to handle it myself:

# 1. Sugar Ant Bait and Traps

One of the most common and effective methods for **sugar ant removal** is to use **bait**. Ant bait contains a substance that attracts ants, which then take it back to their nest. There, it‚Äôs shared with the colony, ultimately killing the entire group.

I remember using these baits in my kitchen, and within days, the number of ants seemed to reduce significantly. However, I found that the bait wasn‚Äôt a magic solution; I still had to ensure I cleaned up any crumbs or food sources that attracted them in the first place.

# 2. Natural Ant Repellents

If you‚Äôre looking for a natural solution, there are a few remedies you can try, such as:

* **Vinegar**: Ants dislike vinegar, so mixing equal parts water and vinegar in a spray bottle and applying it along ant trails can help discourage them from returning.
* **Cinnamon or Coffee Grounds**: Both of these have strong scents that ants find unpleasant. Sprinkling these around areas where you‚Äôve seen ants can deter them from entering.

While these methods worked for me for a time, the ants always seemed to find their way back.

# Professional Sugar Ant Extermination and Control

If DIY solutions aren‚Äôt enough to completely eliminate the problem, it‚Äôs time to consider **professional sugar ant removal and extermination** services. Pest control experts have access to stronger, more effective treatments and can identify the source of the infestation. They will also help you prevent future infestations with expert tips on maintenance.

# 1. Targeted Extermination

Unlike the temporary fix I had with DIY methods, professional exterminators can assess the situation and provide targeted treatment. They will focus on the nest sites, treating them with the appropriate pesticides that eliminate the entire colony rather than just the visible ants.

# 2. Long-Term Control Solutions

A big advantage of working with an exterminator is the long-term control they provide. Extermination services not only remove the existing infestation but also implement strategies to prevent future outbreaks. This might include sealing entry points, offering advice on food storage, and creating a custom plan to keep sugar ants from returning.

# 3. Pest Trapping and Monitoring

In cases where the problem is ongoing or a recurring issue, pest trapping can be an effective strategy. Traps can capture ants as they forage for food, helping to identify the pathways they use and the severity of the infestation. The traps can also provide insight into whether or not the colony is still active.

# Sugar Ant Prevention Tips for Homes and Businesses

Whether you own a home, a warehouse, or an office building in King County, preventing sugar ants from entering your property is key. Here are some expert tips to help you keep your space pest-free:

1. **Seal Entry Points**: Ants can enter through the smallest cracks or openings. Inspect your home or building for gaps around doors, windows, or foundation cracks, and seal them properly.
2. **Clean Up Food Sources**: Ants are highly attracted to food and sugary substances. Clean up any spills or crumbs immediately and store food in airtight containers to minimize the risk of attracting sugar ants.
3. **Keep Moisture in Check**: Sugar ants also need water, so fixing leaks in pipes, sinks, or faucets is essential. Reducing moisture in your home or facility makes it less inviting for ants.
4. **Regular Inspections**: For business owners, especially in industries like food service or healthcare, regular pest inspections are critical to maintaining a clean, safe environment. Schedule regular visits from a pest control professional to ensure any early signs of sugar ants are caught before they become a major issue.

# Sugar Ant Control is Essential for a Clean, Safe Environment

If you‚Äôre dealing with a sugar ant infestation in your King County home or business, you‚Äôre not alone. These tiny pests are common in the area, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to live with them. From DIY methods like traps and natural repellents to professional **sugar ant removal, extermination, pest trapping**, and **sprays**, there are effective ways to regain control of your space.

While DIY solutions can provide temporary relief, working with a professional exterminator ensures a thorough, long-lasting solution to your sugar ant problem. Don‚Äôt wait for the infestation to get worse take action now and keep your home or business pest-free. Trust me, it‚Äôs worth it to know that your property is safe from these persistent little invaders.",1,1744025486.0,The_206,0,1.0,False

### Training
I registered for this in ‚Äô24, and had ‚Äústandard‚Äù training before then. Over twelve weeks or so, I tried to make my longest run in a week go farther than the one two weeks before. Then I would ‚Äúhold‚Äù for four weeks alternating at 18mi and 14mi before tapering from 22mi to 10mi in the last four weeks before. Other runs would be mostly casual, attempting to go distances and times without looking too much on milage. I averaged about 40mi/wk. Unfortunately, *last* year they postponed for two weeks for a freak blizzard, *then* I suffered a fall in the gym earning a rib contusion. I deferred to this year. After registering, I learned I got into Tokyo, which ended up sorta becoming my long-run in the taper down as mentioned. (Note: I did not perform well in Tokyo, a developing cold and dehydration from poor nutrition on vacation may have been the culprit for a my time.) I clocked 3h 39m in Tokyo, hit a 1h 32m at the NYC Half two weeks later, then suffered food poisoning a week after that.

### Pre-race
About two days before, organizers published a livestream explaining the race and unique start procedure. The bib number and precise start time ‚Äì 7:46:08AM ‚Äì was also revealed. Millennium Running in Bedford, NH, played host to the packet pickup. Everything was quite smooth, no additional tools nor ID‚Äôs needed for pickup. To quote the organizer, ‚Äúif we have people stealing bib numbers for this race, we got larger problems in society.‚Äù It was easy to pick up the bib and I bought some swag, at a reasonable US$20. Nutrition-wise, it‚Äôs a carbohydrate heavy two days before the race, with lighter portions the day before to prevent bloat. Bagels, coffee, whey, yogurt, bananas, chicken parm, jelly beans (tons)‚Ä¶

They do have bag check at this race, though since you‚Äôre parking relatively close to the starting area anyway, you don‚Äôt need to check much if anything. I arrived to the area at 6:40AM or so, and found street parking easy (for *that* time of day).

### Race
The start procedure. Everyone is seeded based on what time they input as a predicted finish time during registration. (Pairing runners together with near-enough pace expectations prevents dodging, weaving, and crowding on the course‚Äôs narrow bike path.)  The last two digits of your bib are your ""cone number,‚Äù the first two your group. The first pair of the first group (e.g. bibs 101 and 102) start at the same time, seven seconds later the next pair (#103, #104) go, and so forth, hence the really specific start. Your name shows up first as ‚Äúon deck,‚Äù then on the LED board with huge letters and countdown timer. 3..2..1.. go, drag race style. 

This made it really easy for me to get into the race, as I had someone next to me already with a  relatively identical pace. It also meant there was a little bit of a gap to the people ahead, and virtually no clumping on a narrow rail-trail course. For some reason, last night‚Äôs chicken parm decided to have a little revenge. I added Pepto to my pre-race nutrition (two bagels, one banana, 3Tbsp peanut butter; 4 Gu for the course, 4 electrolyte tabs, 20fl oz H2O). I was jiving along, running at about 7:30/mi (4:40/km).

The course was a paved out and back rail trail, with four police-protected road crossings. Marathoners traverse it twice. While the trail was indeed narrow, it was still easy to get around. Mind the rare small cracks and divots in the pavement, which could trip you up. Scenery was woods-like, as one could expect for New England, which even in the budding of springtime with brown trees and patches of ice on rocks was still a spectacle to behold. There is a hairpin turn around mile 6.1, there was no congestion for me, yet I fear I tripped the person next to me? No one fell? The path undulated slightly, with sensations of going ‚Äúuphill both ways/.‚Äù Certainly not ‚Äúpancake flat‚Äù ‚Äì Jim Thorpe Area Running Festival Marathon holds that record!

Water stops were about 3-ish miles apart, and the cold weather (30‚Äôs F with wind chill) and gray skies did not dehydrate me as I was sapped in Tokyo. Still having the extra water with me did help. (Unlike Tokyo, runner-carried hydration is allowed here, just make sure to throw away your trash in the appropriate bins on course.) They supplied both water and Gatorade, with Gu chews available at about miles 3/9/15/21. To this point, I took my own Gu gels at miles 3, and 8. At mile 12, I was feeling good, my hamstrings were getting a good burn. The only sizable hill occurred on the northbound side of that turnaround. 

Full marathoners exited the trail at mile 12.5 to complete a street loop and go through the course again. Half-marathoners were launching at this time, 14-seconds apart. (The pace of those runners was timed to approximate the pace of the marathoners‚Äô starting their second loop. Again, masterclass in coordination.) My third Gu went down easy at mile 13.5. Around mile 15/16 I felt some cramping wanting to start, and had two electrolyte tabs. My fourth Gu ‚Äì chocolate coconut! ‚Äì came around mile 18 or so. My pace started to slip since the start of lap 2, and only dropped 20s/mi (12s/km) by the end. The gradual hills bit me. 

At the end of loop 2, marathoners turned right to finish the course. That hill somehow did not feel as steep as on loop one, and I dumped what I had in the final 200m.

### Post-race
The announcers were energetic and appropriately funny, for example calling out a runner‚Äôs home state of Ohio as ‚Äúnational champion Buckeye‚Äôs home.‚Äù After crossing the line, you get your ribbon ‚Äì no medals here, but it‚Äôs still highly unique. They offer bananas, yogurt packs, pretzels, and so forth. Aid is immediately available (as it was on course), as were post-race photo ops in front of ‚ÄúI BQ‚Äôd‚Äù signs and a PR bell to ring. I finished with a personal best, shaving 2m 25s off my previous mark. 

From there, I lingered around for a half hour to do some shopping at the vendors there before headed back home. I realized that I felt *really* good. My hydration may have been on point, my nutrition was likely spot on. No cramping, no headache, no nausea. Credit may go to a high high protein diet for the two weeks before and focusing on simple carbs. The lesson learned from Tokyo is to force and monitor water intake the week prior.

### TL;DNR?

#Picks Of The Week (by u/lefuniname)


####**1. Xaetis - Invasions LP [Expedite Records]**  
*Recommended if you like: Current Value, Disphonia, Vorso*  

Before I fully disappear into my Japaniatus (I'll be back at the end of the month!), I've got one more excitingly weird and banging release to cover: the new **Xaetis** album! 

**1.1. Recaep** 

Keen readers might recognise the name from my feature of his [double single Ready/Only](https://redd.it/mamzvr/) in 2021 or from my [extensive coverage of his first album on Sinful Maze in 2022](https://redd.it/mamzvr/), and if you're not familiar with him and want to find out more, those are the places to go. But in short: Since the late 2010s, Bristol-based badboi Louis Parker has been unleashing one mind-twisting auditory firework after the other, on all sorts of cracking underground labels like _Yamatai_, _In The Lab_, _Stellar_ and, of course, his very co-own, **Expedite Records**. With his good mate and co-founder Jon ""**ONIT**"" Walsh handling the business side of things and Louis making sure the music bangs, Expedite has slowly but surely emerged as a force to be reckoned within the Neurofunk spheres, bringing talents like _Kaizen Flow_, _Frannabik_, _SYNE_, and countless more to light, while also providing a playground for Louis' own, most out-there Xaetinations. 

Speaking of, what _has_ the Virus-inspired lad been up to since we last checked in on him? Following the collection of sinfully amazing tunes that was his 2022 album, Louis did _not_ slow down one bit - in fact, shortly after said LP, he _Accelerated_ with another EP on Expedite, showed us all of his different ways of thinking on _Yamatai_, and explored the Catacombs of the deeper and darker sounds of his on _Debunked_. Having seemingly exhausted his hunger for EPs, Louis still kept the momentum going with addictively melancholic one-offs on In The Lab and collaborative otherworldly skulptage on _Sinful Maze_, plus a _massive_ dub pack, his very first sample pack and an accompanying freebie made from just those very same samples. Perhaps most notably though: his rework of Runaway Train, which saw such wide-spread support across the scene that even _A.M.C_ was shelling it! As if this list wasn't already impressive enough, Louis topped it all off with a wholly-his production showcase the next year! 

Even outside of all this sick production though, which went a little into Park(er) Mode in the buildup to the album we're talking about later on, he's seen quite a bit of success on the DJ side of things,  playing legendary festivals like _Darkshire_, _Neuroheadz_, _Balter_ and _Boomtown_, got involved with a couple _Yamatai_ and of course _Expedite_ takeovers, and hold his own against fierce Chop Suey sing-alongs with a smashing selection at Laura & Matt's most magical wedding. On a personal note, Louis has not only connected more with his inner self and learned more about his potential neurodivergence (emphasis on neuro eheh), he's also found love! Before I get too mushy on you here, let's see what all of this musical and personal development lead to - I'm of course referring to his newest LP, **Invasions**! 

**1.2. Invasions LP**

Since this isn't just supposed to be a mere collection of bangers, but a bit of a journey through Louis' chaotic mind, he has shared some of the thoughts and themes he had in mind for each of the tracks. My baseline interpretation is still gonna be what I feel while listening, but here and there his train of runaway thoughts (and his own Xaetymology) will be merged into it as well - so let's go then! 

Walking through a fog of news sound bytes clouding our mind as the dust settles in the aftermath of what seems to have been a rather fierce battle, we might think we're safe from the madness on semi-title and opening track **Invasion**, but as the fighter jets and the basslines creep ever closer, we realise, this is not even close to over, this is just beginning. A one-two-three punch of powerful bass hits unleashes a flurry of break- and distortion-heavy fury, which eventually alternates with a more controlled, fast-paced chuggaton, while shots are fired all around us at every opportunity - this is war. Through the mumbly, static-filled radio chatter on **Scrambler**'s intro, an air siren keeps escalating its pitch, until we're suddenly thrown right into a storm of mercilessly slicing and dicing, almost  undiscernably fast notes, metallic snares and glitched-out synths overlapping each other - a glimpse into the chaos inside Louis' mind! 

We stay a little longer in this moment of inner madness, on **Cardiac**. Screech noises, actual sirens, and we're off to a wild ride through the most wonkiest yet incredibly fast-hitting, bass-y valley, being trashed around left right and upside down with cardiactual insanity. We're not stopping there though, this 6 minute barrage continues to bring out one fun switch-up after the other, with the wonk going through all sorts of relentless evolutions. My heart! After all this hullabaloo, our protagonist's brain is completely out of its mind, even questioning their identity on **Who Are You**. As if looking under the hood of his inner wiring, the literally electric lead sparks joy with a ton of catchiness, while thoroughly gutteral vocals burrow themselves into every nook and cranny, and the entire arrangement glitches out one way or another. Not to mention that stampede of a 4x4 switch in the 2nd drop! 

On **Inebriation**, all of this high-intensity action does eventually pay its toll, and in our hazy state we only just barely manage to sludge through the thick and cloudy atmosphere, the hypnotisingly looping bass notes tirelessly rattling in our head in this comparatively lower energy rumbler. As is too often the case in real life as well, inebriation here leads straight into **Violence**. A mind-melting symphony of stabs, hits and attacks, this one barely manages to keeps its aggression under control. Even multiple entirely different rhythmic approaches offer no reprieve of the onslaught, keeping everyone involved on their toes throughout. 

As we've learned, inebriation is not the way out of this spiral, so let's try a different approach, let's try to regain **Composure**. Way more melodic than anything I've heard from Louis ever before, this 6 minute celebration of mental resolve and optimism sees him, and us, discover an entirely new side of his musical world, full of satisfying synth progressions, while still keeping that underlying nastiness intact. Continuing this path of refreshing melodicality, **Inreach** offers a creative arrangement of cosmic synth energy freely flowing into Neurofunk-off bass madness - two extremes that sometimes keep being at odds, and sometimes merge into one beautifully rolling unity. 

Further exploring far and wide which sound's path he wants to travel down, **Direction** sees him change just that quite a bit. Breaky, rhythmically strange and packed with sounds straight out of a madman's brain, or rather straight-forward, mach 10 driving neuro roller with somehow even more out-there sonics, with each response topping its ludicrousness over and over again? Or maybe some halftime even?! Who knows, but this very tightly structured, highly creative back and forth - which his partner adores since it ""sounds like her brain"" - is simply incredible to bare witness to. Considering **Carnage** is the title of our next stop, I think we know what path he chose. With the advent of two hits of pure, industrial power, the high speed diesel engine is kicked into the highest of gears, relentlessly gnawing away at our collective sanity. Every gear change, we are pushed further back into our seats, every switch, we cannot help but scrunch up our faces. 

Keeping up with the themes of change, the penultimate chune is actually a VIP rework of one of his 2023 dub pack tunes, **Quicksand**! Injected with the clean and controlled, yet messily all over the place energy we have come to love during the previous ten tunes, this VIP not only got the classic grooves down pat, it's also throwing more and more metallic objects at our heads to create a whirlwind of sounds, throwing us off balance at every turn. So many pew pew's! To round this journey off and hammer home the evolution and growth aspect of it all, finale **Evolve** once again returns us to the melodicality of the album's mid-points. Having endured all sorts of neurological damage, we are now coming out the other end stronger than ever, carried forward by an elegant dance between larger-than-life synth sweeps and a flurry of cut-up steps, both of which undergo their own growth journeys as well. 

**1.3. Conclusion**

Once again, Xaetis offers a sheer endless supply of expe-tight production, this time however taking us through all sorts of unexpected sonic worlds in truly maximally creative ways. (Xae)'tis a banger, I'm afraid!

The storms that had been forecast had decided to turn north, and the beach was clear. The sky overhead was the pale turquoise of Parvati, and the sailbirds wheeled overhead. It was the end of the season, and with the storms forecasted, hardly anyone took the risk to go to the beach. Nick and Selkirk practically had the place to themselves.



They set up their chairs, and Nick immediately went into the water. Touchdown Beach and Naya Chennai were on the equator, and the waters were always nearly bathtub warm. Nick swam out to the edge of the public swimming zone, turned around at the buoy, and swam back to Selkirk. Since they arrived he had started swimming regularly like he did as a boy, and his shoulders had a strength and definition that he hadn‚Äôt seen since he was a teen. 



Selkirk looked good too. The strong light of their star had caused her fur to darken. She wore a floral print bathing suit and large sunglasses, reading a novel while Nick swam. He walked back up to their chairs, the water running off of him in streams. He wrapped a towel around his waist and sat next to her.



‚ÄúYou sure you don‚Äôt want to go swimming, Sel? There‚Äôs no current and the water is warm like usual.‚Äù Nick said, leaning back in his chair.



‚ÄúYou know it takes me hours to dry off, even with the extra absorbent towels you bought me.‚Äù She said, touching the pad to turn a page. ‚ÄúBesides, my book just go to the good part.‚Äù



Nick chuckled. He had to admit, coming back to Parvati was nice. He and Selkirk debated going here or back to K‚Äôlax for a long time while Tink dutifully ferried them. In the end, they both decided that K‚Äôlax would be too enticing a target for the ascendant empire, and they wanted to be as far away from Raaden and her Nanites as possible. Parvati had already declared their support for the Empire - so long as they let Parvati handle their own issues. Raaden was fine with that, so her new fleets of Calamity Class Super Dreadnoughts passed them by.



He was able to take Selkirk to his favorite restaurants - the ones that were still open - and she got to try the food of his childhood. Some of the places even had food tailored towards K‚Äôlaxi palates. K‚Äôlaxi presence on Parvati had increased markedly with the reintroduction of the Empire as many of the K‚Äôlaxi in Sol saw what was coming, and those who could leave, did.



They purchased a small house in the foothills above Naya Chennai, and he even had bought a ground vehicle. It wasn‚Äôt new, and it wasn‚Äôt flashy, but it got them into the city and out, and took them to the beach when they wanted to go. Selkirk thought that his interest in the vehicle was cute, but she treated it with suspicion. K‚Äôlaxi never really developed ground vehicles, and thought that the humans historical obsession with them was odd. She allowed Nick to drive her around, and she had to admit, with the windows down, it was nice to feel the wind in her face. 



Gord was right, money was never a problem. They took the money they stole from Raaden, and Selkirk called in some final favors with some more‚Ä¶unsavory people to get it laundered. They wound up losing about half to fees and the foibles of the process, but it still left them with more than one hundred million stars. More than enough to live comfortably on for dozens of lives. 



The first few months after they arrived on Parvati, Nick had terrible nightmares. They mostly revolved around being trapped in a hibernation cabinet, and unable to get out. The others were ones where he imagined Eastern asking for help as the Nanites consumed her, until there was only her screams remaining, until they too disappeared. Selkirk asked him to get some therapy, so he did. It helped, and the nightmares lessened, but they never went totally away.



The hurt over losing Eastern never went away. It rose and faded like a tide. Some days were easy, and her memory was a blessing. Some days, Nick felt like he would round the corner in their little house and see her on the couch, her legs up on the table, reading a pad and smiling. Those were tough days. 



They kept up on the news from Sol, and watched Raaden‚Äôs empire grow. Once she officially took over again, she devoted the system‚Äôs resources to building new warships and Gates. She kept her word to the Nanites and expanded the Gate system. Nick had also seen anti AI rhetoric increase from Sol. They had already been unwelcome in the system after defeating Melody, and now they were outright reviled. There weren‚Äôt many AIs on Parvati, but the few that did live here became quite a bit more low key about who they were, and not a small number left - probably to move to Home.



It took Nick a long time to forgive them. He felt like Gord‚Äôs hubris killed Eastern. It might have, but eventually, and with the help of his therapist, he came to understand that they did what they did out of a desire to avoid a hell they had already experienced. Nick did a lot of reading on the early AI rights movement, and honestly had no idea that things had been so violent. Schools in Parvati barely touched on AI rights, it was so long ago that it was mostly a paragraph explanation at the end of the chapter on Earth. 



So when Nick saw Gord sitting in a cafe on the outskirts of Naya Chennai he did a double take. He stopped and stared, but it sure looked like Gord. Same sandy blond hair, same flannel shirt. He was sipping a coffee and looking at a beat up pad. His eyes flicked up over the pad and locked with Nick‚Äôs. He could see Gord sigh, and he waved Nick over.



‚ÄúNick, I haven‚Äôt seen you in a long time. How long has it been, ten years? More?‚Äù Gord said as Nick sat down. A server brought him a water, and he ordered a coffee as well.



‚ÄúFifteen years, Gord.‚Äù



‚ÄúAh, well, when you get to be my age, a difference of five years is hardly worth counting. You still with Sel?‚Äù



Nick nodded. ‚ÄúSel and I have a little house in the foothills. It‚Äôs a quiet life.‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad. At least someone listened to what I had to say.‚Äù Gord said as he glowered over his drink.



‚ÄúIs something wrong? Why are you on Parvati? Where is Chloe, Tink, or Medicine Hat?‚Äù



The mask fell, and for a moment, Nick saw Gord as the broken, depressed man he must have been. His eyes sunken, his shoulders slumped. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre gone, Nick.‚Äù



‚ÄúThey‚Äôre what?‚Äù Nick lowered his voice. ‚ÄúWas it the Nanites?‚Äù



‚ÄúIndirectly.‚Äù Gord said and took a large breath. ‚ÄúRaaden has begun going after us. She‚Äôs doing it quietly and not trying to attract a lot of attention, but it‚Äôs a purge. She‚Äôs out to get rid of the AIs.‚Äù



Nick gasped. ‚ÄúCan you fight back? Is there something you can do?‚Äù



Gord shook his head. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve tried. That‚Äôs what took out Chloe. Now, we‚Äôve been visiting every planet, colony, orbital, and starbase we can, and warning every AI we come across. We tell them to drop everything an go Home.‚Äù



‚ÄúChloe is gone? I‚Äôm so sorry Gord.‚Äù



‚ÄúWell‚Äù Gord reached under the table and produced a canvas backpack. He reached inside and brought out the thing that started Nick, Eastern, and Selkirk on their whole path. It was a small cube, shimmering blue, five centimeters or so on a side. The crystal lattice memory cube. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not dead, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre asking. I managed to grab a backup.‚Äù He put the cube back in to the bag, and showed Nick the contents.



Inside were memory cubes, easily two dozen. Gord closed the bag and looked up at Nick. ‚ÄúThis is all I can do for now. I take a backup of those who don‚Äôt heed my warning. When the world changes and I‚Äôm allowed to exist again, I‚Äôll print my friends bodies and wake them up. They‚Äôre not dead, they‚Äôre just put away for safe keeping.‚Äù 



‚ÄúWhat are you doing here then, Gord?‚Äù 



‚ÄúI met an old friend who lives here, and warned them to leave. I think they are taking me seriously though; we‚Äôre booked on the same shuttle back to orbit. We‚Äôll ride the Gates out to a small station somewhere and I‚Äôll link a beacon and we‚Äôll get picked up.‚Äù Gord put down a chit and stood. ‚ÄúIn fact, my shuttle is leaving in a couple hours, so I shoul-‚Äù



‚ÄúGord, I blamed you for Eastern‚Äôs death.‚Äù Nick blurted out.



Gord stopped, and his expression softened. ‚ÄúI know. It‚Äôs not entirely wrong either. For what it‚Äôs worth, I‚Äôm sorry. I made a bad call, and it cost Eastern her life.‚Äù



‚ÄúGord, I-‚Äù Nick stopped, and took a breath. ‚ÄúIt took a lot of therapy, but I understand why you did what you did, and what you‚Äôre doing now. You‚Äôre doing everything you can to help your people, to keep AIs alive and safe.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat I am, Nick my friend. That I am.‚Äù Gord turned to hail a cab. ‚ÄúThis time though, I have a feeling that it‚Äôll be a while before I can really help them.‚Äù He stepped into the cab, and with a small wave, was gone.



Once he got home, Nick saw Selkirk in the kitchen. Never one to want to cook, she had lately picked up K‚Äôlaxi recipe books, and was trying to re-create the foods of her childhood. It was‚Ä¶ odd tasting, but none of it was bad, and Nick was fine with her experimenting. The kitchen smelled of exotic spices and only a small amount of smoke. She looked up, smiling. ‚ÄúWelcome back, Nick! I finally think I got the spices right for the jebmar. Here‚Äôs hoping it‚Äôll taste right too.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great hon, I can‚Äôt wait to try it.‚Äù Nick said as he sat at their little dinner table. ‚ÄúI uh, I saw Gord today, Sel.‚Äù



Selkirk‚Äôs ears pricked up at Gord‚Äôs mention, and she carefully moved the pan off the heat and snapped the burner off. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll keep.‚Äù She said and sat down. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù



Nick explained the visit and what Gord said, including the memory cubes. ‚ÄúSo, that‚Äôs what he meant by a backup plan.‚Äù She said, almost to herself.



‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù



‚ÄúBack when Gord took the cube from Jameson and backed him up. He had said the cubes were his backup plan.‚Äù She chuckled without humor, ‚Äúhe meant it figuratively and literally.‚Äù Her eyes narrowed, ‚ÄúWhat about Kellan?‚Äù



‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs who Gord was talking about,‚Äù Nick said. ‚ÄúI stopped by his coffee stand and it was closed. I hope he got out.‚Äù He stared at Selkirk a moment. The longer they were together, the more beautiful she had become to him. Her fur was starting to be streaked with grey around her muzzle but it just made her look more worldly. Her eyes were as bright as ever, and she was always there for him. ‚ÄúWhat about us?‚Äù He asked.



‚ÄúWhat about us?‚Äù Sel said, tilting her head slightly.



‚ÄúShould we‚Ä¶ do anything?‚Äù



‚ÄúOh Nick.‚Äù Selkirk said, standing, and sat in his lap. She leaned her head against his chest, and he stroked the fur between her ears, just the way she liked it. ‚ÄúNick, we already did our part. We‚Äôre done. We‚Äôre out. We did like Gord said, took the money and ran. Anything we do at this point will just put us back on Raaden‚Äôs radar. Better to stay retired and practice cooking.‚Äù



‚ÄúDo you‚Ä¶ do you ever want to go back to K‚Äôlax?‚Äù 



‚ÄúSometimes, yes.‚Äù She admitted. ‚ÄúWhen it‚Äôs been hotter than 40 degrees for the sixth day in a row, or when the rain continues on for a month, I long to go back to the cool forests back home. But, traveling would probably be too dangerous for us.‚Äù



‚ÄúWould it?‚Äù Nick said. ‚ÄúIf we take a passenger liner - one of the ones that traverses the new Gates, we‚Äôll be just two more customers. You still have family on K‚Äôlax right?‚Äù



He felt her nodding on his chest.



‚ÄúIf you hate it here, let‚Äôs leave. We went back to my homeland, and I showed it to you for fifteen years. Show me yours.‚Äù



She looked up at him, her eyes damp. Nick‚Äôs hunch was right, she didn‚Äôt want to stay here. ‚ÄúDo you mean it? It‚Äôll be difficult for you; there aren‚Äôt very many humans on K‚Äôlax. You won‚Äôt get your butter chicken anywhere there.‚Äù



Nick chuckled. ‚ÄúWell, maybe opening up a human cuisine restaurant is just the thing to do to spend my days.‚Äù



‚ÄúNick,‚Äù She said. ‚ÄúI want to go home.‚Äù



‚ÄúThen, let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

Here are some strategies to help you develop these skills:‚Äã

1. **Start Small**: Begin by socializing in manageable settings, such as practicing conversation with family or spending time in a coffee shop. Gradually step out of your comfort zone by attending larger events or joining clubs that interest you. 
2. **Join Group Activities Based on Your Interests**: Participate in activities like book clubs, sports teams, or cooking classes. Engaging in enjoyable pursuits facilitates natural conversations and helps you meet like-minded individuals. ‚Äã
3. **Embrace Your Unique Qualities**: Recognize and leverage your natural strengths. Understanding your personality traits can boost confidence and improve interactions with others. 
4. **Be Proactive in Social Situations**: Take the initiative to engage with others. This could involve introducing yourself at events or facilitating group discussions, which can enhance your social value and foster meaningful connections. 
5. **Practice Mindfulness**: Being present in the moment can reduce anxiety about social situations. Mindfulness encourages awareness and can ease interactions by helping you focus on the here and now. ‚Äã

By implementing these strategies, you can enhance your social skills, leading to more fulfilling interactions and a broader social network.",1,1744024814.0,socialskills,0,1.0,False

Asad,"Long story short, jumped on the hype train, pulled the trigger, expecting a hidden gem. Unfortunately, after giving it a fair share of wears, I've found the fragrance ultimately fails to match the buzz surrounding it. Yeah, the famous / infamous **Lattafa Asad.** 

Upon the generous sprays, it projects itself loudly with a robust blend of black pepper, juicy pineapple, and smoky tobacco. This initial opening feels super rich and inviting‚Äîa spicy and somewhat seductive beginning, instantly reminiscent of its pricier counterpart, **Sauvage Elixir.** Yet, this enticing introduction is disappointingly short-lived. Atleast in my case.

In the drydown transition noticeable notes of patchouli and coffee come into play, but the scent quickly loses definition and clarity. Instead of an engaging complexity, the middle phase feels muddled, generic, and disappointingly thin. Gone is the striking personality from the opening, replaced by a bland spiced sweetness that struggles to leave an impression. 

In Drydown, it's most likeable to me as it settles down with warm vanilla, amber, dry woods, and slightly sweet now. It's a hit or miss consistency and presence. These notes are pleasant, lingering close to the skin without projecting much charisma. The performance significantly undermines the scent profile‚Äîdespite advertised longevity of 8-9 hours, in practice I found myself reapplying after 4-5 hours in current Delhi weather.  The mass appeal and likability are above average.

Poised on the intersection of divine eternity and human history, the holy ground of Mount Sinai sets the stage for the monumental events of salvation. From God‚Äôs revelation of His name in the Burning-but-not-consumed Bush to the reception of the Ten Commandments by Moses and all that ensues as the Hebrew people struggle to follow the way of God to the promised land ‚Äì the Old Testament revelations of Sinai illumine our own path to God.

Trusting in God, the Hebrew people do well. Putting their own logic ahead of that trust, not so well ‚Ä¶ A desert is a difficult place where one learns to depend on the grace, the divine help of God. And this is where Sinai‚Äôs light shines brightest. For the difficult steps leading to the Holy Summit of Sinai divulge not only the path to God, but its destination‚Äì physical union with the divine fire of the Burning Bush. A mystery difficult to contemplate but for the living icon of the Mother of God whose womb ‚Äì like the Burning Bush ‚Äì would contain the fire of divinity, some twelve centuries later, without being consumed by it.

With the message of union with God encompassing both Old and New Testaments‚Äì what then separates the two? True, the New Testament reveals the trinitarian nature of God as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, accentuating the meeting point of creation with God in the Person of the Son ‚Äì but these earthshaking realities were previously indicated on Sinai, very much in the Old Testament ‚Ä¶

https://preview.redd.it/ocvzk9tnaete1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=020ecc04fea3df7a4755a4c7430717f4e7221bb5

The New Testament opens with the human genealogy of Jesus Christ. Having been born of a Father without a mother before time, He is now born of a mother without a father¬†*within*¬†time - fully God, fully Man. Thus Jesus, the Son and Anointed of God (*Messiah*¬†in Hebrew,¬†*Christos*¬†in Greek), refers to Himself as the ‚ÄúSon of Man,‚Äù emphasizing that, notwithstanding His unprecedented miracles, He is fully human. Why is this important? For many reasons, one of which is to demonstrate that we can follow in His footsteps to reject sin and its damages, since He accomplished this as a human Himself. Thus He says¬†*I am the Way and the Truth and the Life*.

Illustrated by anchorites like¬†Saint Mary of Egypt¬†who took this so much to heart that they went out into the desert to occupy themselves with nothing else, the process is called ‚Äúpurification of soul.‚Äù Christian life for Orthodox faithful is not a matter of ‚Äúgoing to church,‚Äù ‚Äúgoing to confession‚Äù ‚Äúfasting‚Äù and the like. They worship, confess (which in fact is not a place they go to but therapy for the soul) and fast, but only as the means to an end. Quoting the Bishop of Skopelos on the¬†Sunday of Saint John Klimakos, ‚ÄúYou can put nothing except fasting foods in your mouth for an entire lifetime and achieve nothing. Fasting is not an end in itself, but the means to an end ‚Äì sanctity.‚Äù As Sinai‚Äôs Elder Pavlos would explain, ‚ÄúFasting is a means provided by the Church for those who wish to go closer to God.""¬†¬†

https://preview.redd.it/wbimh24paete1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8673a67572e182dc5abf5a6b6947a987a480e2b

Saint Mary spent forty-eight years in the desert. Where were her toiletries, her vitamins, her medicines, her sugar and coffee? Where did she find a cold drink in the suffocating heat of the Palestinian desert; a stack of blankets to weather its freezing nights? Her recycle bags to carry groceries home from the supermarket? The logistics are unimaginable even to those who think we live a fairly basic lifestyle.

The answer, beyond the perception of this world, is no secret to the wisdom of Orthodox hymnology. As the famous hymn of the Annunciation to the Mother of God points out, ‚ÄúWherever God wishes ‚Äì the order of nature is overridden.‚Äù Or, in the expression of the original Greek whose grammatical drama allows backwards sentences for effect: Wherever God wishes ‚Äì is vanquished of nature the order!‚Äô

Sinai‚Äôs Elder Pavlos of blessed memory had a story to tell on the subject, one which you were not likely to hear for he took the Sinaite custom of hiding one‚Äôs spiritual experiences very seriously. Overcome with ascetic zeal, he would hike in the blistering desert for three days at a time without water, without having brought water along even for emergencies ‚Ä¶ to reach his destination filled with the exhilaration of unmitigated ardor, spiritual and bodily thirst alike quenched by the grace ‚Ä¶

\* \* \*

Having taken affront at the abusive powers of sin on the soul, Mary of Egypt throws the entire weight of repentance against the insult by walking into the desert and not coming back. Suddenly seeing what cannot be seen, she realizes that the only thing of value in this life, the only thing that lasts, is going closer to God. Does God live only in the desert then? On the contrary. Given that the purity of God bears no cohabitation with sin, Saint Mary‚Äôs self-exile illustrates not how far a Christian must go from civilization to find a cave, but how far one must go from sin to find his soul. Everything one does in this life can, and must be, the means of going closer to God.

Thus the gift of the Old Testament in setting humanity on the path to purification of soul. ‚ÄúOn the path,‚Äù because despite the emphasis of Mosaic Law on the ritual of purification, there is no purification of soul before the sacrifice of the unblemished Lamb of God on the cross, whose most pure blood alone carries the divine power to purify ‚Ä¶

Having begun, then, with the Incarnation (the ‚Äòputting on flesh‚Äô) of Christ (who puts on human nature in everything but sin), the New Testament recounts His work as the God-man who saves humans from slavery to death, encouraging their return to the blessedness of life in God for which they were created. The first four chapters are the¬†*Evangelia*, meaning ‚Äògood news.‚Äô These are four parallel accounts of the life of Jesus, His teachings and miracles, completed by the work of His salvation on the Cross, His resurrection from the dead and finally, return to His Father in Heaven.

[Photo by Priestmonk Justin Sinaites¬†¬†¬†¬†](https://preview.redd.it/slftlbrqaete1.png?width=550&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ef9368beb8f7b01d341f3f3eb5230fc9df901c7)

Christ leaves His followers with the promise of the Comforter, the Holy Spirit who dwells within those who wholeheartedly seek His presence within their hearts and lives. One must want Him, for our God respects our freedom and will not force His love on anyone.

Next we read about the Acts of the Apostles as they carry the good news of Christ into the world following the promised descent of the Holy Spirit. The rest of the New Testament consists of letters from the apostles, mostly Saint Paul, to members of the new faith.

Simultaneously with the inconceivable humility of His birth as an infant, however, Christ exists before all time. In fact, as the ‚ÄòAsarkos‚Äô (before putting on flesh) Word of God, He is the Creator of all. Throughout the Old Testament, it is Christ who forms the first humans; who appears in the Burning Bush to acquaint humanity with God; who gives Moses the Ten Commandments on Sinai in order to turn people from the atrocities of paganism; who gives His words to the Prophets to bring humanity back to God ‚Äì not by force but through the healthy exercise of their free will (the same free will the first humans misused to reject life in God).

As Archbishop Damianos of Sinai has pointed out, being a community of Love, the Holy Trinity created mankind to participate in the blessedness of that Love. Where does free will fit in? To answer a question with a question: Who ever loved by force? To love, people must enjoy the freedom to¬†*want*¬†to. Their early choice rejected that love (by accepting slanderous thoughts against it). The inevitable result was slavery to sin. But in purifying human nature as the God-man, Christ purifies freedom of will itself via the blessings of the Church founded through His apostles and guarded from human innovation by their successors.

Reversing the mistake of the first humans by rejecting the disparaging thoughts about others that besiege us all, humans can once again genuinely love. The reward of love? Union with God in¬†*theosis*: the goal of Orthodox Christian life in which our purified energies are united with those of God Himself. Should one desire the definitive image of this human-divine synergy, he need but consider the birth of the bodiless Word of God in the flesh of the Holy Virgin.

[‚Äú‚Ä¶ as the herald of truth, tell me O Gabriel how I shall give birth in the flesh to the bodiless Word‚Ä¶‚Äù From the Fourth ode of the Canon sung on the Orthodox feast of the Annunciation. Canons are sacred poems referencing the Old Testament songs whose theological insights richly illumine the New Testament events they foreshadow. The Annunciation Canon is composed entirely of a rhetorical dialogue between the Holy Virgin and the Archangel offering many layers of perception into the ultimate unknowability of the event.

The rewards are infinite, for the grace of God not only enters within us, but flows from us to our children, assisting them through the difficulties and challenges of their present and future lives ‚Äì the obligation¬†*par excellence*¬†of parenthood. Feeding the child with material food comes second to nourishing them with the Holy Spirit ‚Ä¶ in order for the grace of God to flow ultimately from us to the entire world. What did Saint Seraphim of Sarov say? ‚ÄúFind inner peace, and thousands around you will be saved.‚Äù

PART II

It would be difficult indeed to think about the union of human and divine energy without remembering the events of Pentecost. Observing Jewish custom on this day, the apostles were commemorating Moses‚Äô reception of the Commandments on Sinai ‚Äì the Law of God preparing humanity for reception of the Holy Spirit ‚Äì when the event suddenly takes place. The Holy Spirit descends in tongues of fire upon each of the apostles, who then begin speaking the foreign languages they will need to carry the good news of Christ‚Äôs saving grace to the world.

The Jewish festival of Pentecost having reached its zenith in the Christian one, Apostle Peter proceeds to a summary of the Old Testament prophecies and promises of God that have just been fulfilled before the eyes of thousands.. Beginning with Prophet Joel‚Äôs¬†*And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh*¬†‚Ä¶ he proves to the attentive crowd that there can no longer be doubt in anyone‚Äôs mind that Jesus is God before the ages.. Indeed, Orthodox Christianity‚Äôs great theologian-saints are clear that the words of all the Old Testament prophecies are those of the Pre-incarnate Son and Word of God.

However, Peter stresses that this day‚Äôs miracle is not the end of something, but the beginning:

‚ÄúRepent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For this promise belongs to you and your children and to all who are far away, as many as the Lord our God will call to Himself.‚Äù (Acts 2. 38-39)

PART III

*And the heavens and the earth were finished, and the whole world of them.*

*And God finished on the sixth day his works which he made, and he ceased on*

*the seventh day from all his works which he made. And God blessed the seventh day*

*and sanctified it, because in it he ceased from all his works*¬†‚Ä¶ (Genesis 2.1-3)

In short, the Old Testament recounts the works of Christ¬†*before*¬†His incarnation as a man, while the New Testament recounts the works of Christ¬†*following*¬†His incarnation.

Navigating the fathomless depths of Orthodox worship we discover the staggering connection between the two in the services of Holy and Great Saturday, the day that Christ spends in Hades following the ineffable passion of His crucifixion ‚Ä¶ A day of breathless silence rendered intelligible only within the vision of the sacred hymnology which notes that

‚ÄúMoses, the great Prophet, mystically prefigured this day saying,

‚ÄòAnd God blessed the seventh day.‚Äô

For this is the blessed Sabbath; this is the day of rest,

on which the only-begotten Son of God rested from all His works,

observing the Sabbath rest \[now\] in the flesh ‚Ä¶‚Äù

Having rested on the seventh day from the works of Creation that brought everything into being from nothing, Christ rests once more on the seventh day, now in the flesh, from the greatest work of all.

Far beyond the garden of earthly delight where the first humans wore the glory of God as a garment, the salvation offered by the God-man renders His followers gods themselves, fulfilling the text of Psalm 81/82.6:¬†*I have said, Ye are gods; and children of the Most High, all of you*. This passage is quoted by Christ Himself in John 10.34, clarifying that gods are those who receive the Word of God; the gift of grace bestowed without change to human nature (thus the small ‚Äòg‚Äô appropriate to this text). The earthly garden is infinitely superseded by the kingdom of heaven ‚Äì God¬†*within*¬†those who authentically seek and desire Him.¬†¬†¬†

It was on this same seventh day, the Holy and Great Saturday celebrating Christ‚Äôs opening of the kingdom of heaven to mankind, that Archbishop Damianos shared the above observations following the Divine Liturgy at St. Catherine‚Äôs. An Orthodox pilgrim listened attentively as though in preparation for the impending moment already arrived for him, the moment when his soul flew from this world to the newly opened kingdom in the joy awaiting every child of the Most High; pilgrims in heart and soul, all of them ‚Ä¶

One goes to great lengths to experience the majesties of creation (which the enlightened say are nothing compared to those of the original creation). The traveler returns home with photos and mementos, hoping to retain the inner peace inspired by alpine wildflowers, Mediterranean seas glistening on their way to forever, a glass of claret sparkling in the sunlight on a medieval hilltop surrounded by olives and pomegranates ..

But he cannot. So he returns, again and again, discounting the toils of travel because the experience of peace is so addictive. Understandably, because we were created for it ‚Ä¶ not for ephemeral joys that is, but for the incomparable peace of God that dwells within, wherever we are, whatever we are doing. This is the gift one brings home not from the airport or the bank or the supermarket, but from the journey deep into the soul that finally confronts the ‚ÄúWhy are we here?‚Äù whose voice will not be silenced. Fame and fortune, family and friends all have their day in the sun. And the sun can be counted on ‚Ä¶ but not forever..

*The promise held out by God in the Old Testament is made reality in the New.*

When all is said and done, it‚Äôs not about practicing virtue, but about¬†*wanting to*. Our objective in seeking the Holy Spirit is not to become divine on our own powers (as attempted by Adam and Eve, resulting in their estrangement from God) ‚Äì but to become participants in the love of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, through purity of soul. What does the most venerable Orthodox saint then respond to the lowliest monastic who seeks his or her guidance? ‚ÄúDo this ‚Äì¬†*if you want to*.‚Äù

Thus the dangers, not of having riches, but of enslaving ourselves to them, of devoting ourselves to nothing but the good life of food and drink, health and wealth; or rather, to the delusion that Life consists of nothing higher..

What does the leprous man who has understood the mercy of Christ say to Him?¬†*If you will*, you can make me clean. What does Christ‚Äôs love reflexively respond, even before commanding,¬†*Be cleansed ? ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI will!‚Äù*

While ‚Äúmercy‚Äù might conjure up images of a tyrant needing appeasement, in fact the word ‚Äúmercy‚Äù translates a Greek one meaning charity. As the energy of ‚Äúdivine righteousness‚Äù¬†*which only loves*, God‚Äôs ‚Äúmerciful charity‚Äù could not be further from the vindictiveness connected to human notions of righteousness. How grossly non-Orthodox translations of the Scriptures have disfigured the humble love of Christ ‚Äì the Lord and God of all who exclaims on another occasion ‚ÄúMan, who made Me judge or partitioner over you?‚Äù With a small vocabulary and no need for spoken fluency, New Testament Greek is not that difficult to learn. A good grammar and the patience to go slowly quickly pay for themselves with priceless new perceptions, not only of the meanings but of the power couched in the words of holy scripture. The kind of perception that transcends understanding ‚Ä¶ Why? As the Word of God, Christ Himself is present in His words.

Passing through the nave of the church from front to back with the Book of the Evangelia held high, as all liturgists do on Sundays after reading the New Testament announcement of Christ‚Äôs Resurrection, Father Pavlos did not try to conceal his elation as he offered the Book to each of the faithful as each pressed forward to venerate it with a grateful kiss. ‚ÄúIn the words of His Evangelia, the Word of God¬†*Himself*¬†comes forth to greet His people,‚Äù he would say, ‚Äújust as you greet beloved visitors to your home!‚Äù

Christians similarly cherish the pure will of the Mother of God at the Archangel Gabriel‚Äôs announcement that she has been selected to give birth to Christ. How could anyone respond to such a message? Indeed the Holy Virgin evinces bewilderment. Held hostage neither to sin however, nor to the bonds of impoverished human logic, she waits only long enough to understand this to be the will of God before exclaiming,¬†*Behold, the handmaid of the Lord!*¬†‚ÄúI will!‚Äù

As indicated by a rare Sinai icon depicting the embryo Christ in her womb, it is at this instant ‚Äì simultaneously with the Virgin‚Äôs acceptance ‚Äì that the Holy Spirit descends in a ray of grace for the infant Christ to take shape in her womb.

Representing the Holy Spirit‚Äôs entrance into the heart of every Orthodox Christian who finds his own will in that of Christ, the message of the Annunciation is placed on the Beautiful Gate of Orthodox temples ‚Äì the central doors opening onto the holy of holies ‚Äì the altar bearing the body and blood of Christ that sanctify every Orthodox Christian¬†*from within*.

With limited space, the depiction on the altar gates is typically limited to images of the Archangel and Holy Virgin whose stances exude the unprecedented gravity of this moment for mankind ‚Äì the juncture of Old and New Testaments enacted within the womb of a Pure Maiden. A juncture contingent not only upon the Virgin‚Äôs response, but upon our own when called to embrace God‚Äôs plan of salvation on behalf of our own soul. For Christ wishes to be born within every soul brought into being by His love; a calling to whose magnitude we must respond ‚Äì and do ‚Äì whether through action, or the tragedy of inaction.

Wrapped about in clouds of seclusion from the world and its travails, a Byzantine monastery perched on a crag overlooking the Aegean preserves the apprehension of these phenomena by a devout woodcarver, himself long lost to the centuries. Well aware that Byzantine iconography functions neither as art nor historical representation, he understood its testimony to the kingdom of heaven, to the grace that acts on creation not just exteriorly, but¬†*from within*¬†Spirit-bearing souls.

Unwilling, as a result, to omit the ray from the iconography that manifests the synergy of divine energies with human love, the woodworker solved his dilemma by skillfully carving the ray of grace into the decorations of the surrounding woodcarving, exactly where it would have been painted had space allowed for a complete icon‚Ä¶

These are the teachings preserved¬†*without change*¬†until today only by Orthodox Christianity‚Äôs vigilance for the Truth of God; the vigilance of a nameless soul carving the Light of Christ into the fabric of a monastery sequestered by the ages on a nameless headland ‚Ä¶ where it shines undimmed upon the ages.

What unites Old and New Testaments then? What else but the sacrificial love outside time yet within it, of the bodiless yet incarnate Son of God, whose limitless generosity unites the courage and daring of those who truly want ‚Äúthe good life‚Äù ‚Ä¶ with its ineffable blessings.

74/100 matches won

4k: 18 times

3k: 56 times

2k: 7 times

1k: 11 times

0k: 8 times

Most effective build of Perks used: Unbound, Bamboozle, Brutal Strenght, BBQ. 

(NOTE: slowdown perks are reccomended, this is not a well suited build for competitive scenarios, i just didnt use them to understand how much preassure the power can generate on its own)

Addons: Fresh Coffee, Kaneki Satchel

Since his PTB, the ghoul has improved drastically, his movement has been made better and his lower cooldown allows for a powerful catchup tool. This killer seems however to be mostly punisher of holding W, in fact during normal looping methods his power often ends up not as useful as normal since often survivors are able to take steep turns and reach windows/pallets in time. For covering such weakness, the ghoul is forced to bring bamboozle the very least to block windows with his power. Pallets can still be taken care of by breaking them normally but brutal strenght definetly helps.

Most of my initial matches have struggled exactly for this reason, until i started running bamboozle and brutal strenght oftentimes the best survs were able to keep me ALMOST a M1 killer for far too much during certain loops until i managed to take them by surprise at pallet vaulting, showing a clear weakness of this character power usage in most Loops.

I also noticed that while not enraged his ability seems to have priority to hit survivors even when not aiming at them AT ALL while if you were enraged that wouldnt have happened, this could be both good or bad depending on the situation, but overall i wish it to be identical to the enraged mode even because some hits were extremely dirty, hitting even trough obstacles and walls making it feel very unfair for survivors even if just for injuring them, not even legion, houndmaster and deathslinger has such cheap shots and should be adressed imo. 

His mobility is drastically high, but not overtuned. I believe only Blight, Overdrive Hillbilly and few Teleport related killers are the only ones to have an higher mobility than him, making him easily a top 5 in that departiment, allowing him to be a formidable hit and run killer even if he lacks information.

While his power doesnt allow for vertical movement, he can still injure survs on vertical positions such as hills, might come in handy. 

His power in chase has little use, but pallet vaulting has proven useful at most pallets ([Example](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/s/qhlRuNSNnX)), but if the tile is too small or has another pallet/window nearby, the ghoul cant do much except trying to bodyblock by using the power going in front of the surv which is unreliable often times. So this antiloop its highly dependent on the tile you‚Äôre currently in and if the survivors predicts or not what you‚Äôre about to do

Vaulting windows differently from pallets is less safe, survs can still vault back since not all times the damage on vault triggers well. Bamboozle or the addon to block windows is always reccomended for consistency.

His power seems to block the exit gate for survivor injured by it. However, this is neglectable since the time the gate is closed doesnt allow enough time to get a down + grab. Only way to make this part of his power usable is if Save the best for last is brought or if the survivor commits a mistake and steps a little away from the exit.

Sadly, he is an excellent tunneler, his power eats trough endurance status of the unhooked survivor making them vulnerable once again, and his mobility allows him to return to the hooks extremely fast and catchup to the survivor that just lost endurance... i dont think there's something that can be done to adress this unless they create some sort of backlash for hitting recently unhooked survivors, such as a slower recharge rate of the power to prevent rapid downing afterwards if the hook was in a dead zone. But this would also screw up the ghoul if he didnt want to tunnel since people would start bodyblocking their rescuer while they use off the record... i dont know what to suggest here

While testing most low rarity addons, i've discovered kaneki satchel and the black coffee to be the most effective cheap addons, with obvious better options at higher rarities such as the umbrella

Something to note is that most matches ended up with 3k due to inexperience of survivors, The lost game were fews but with clear counters from the survivors being more expert. As such i believe more time is necessary to understand the proper placement of this killer since most players still have to understand to not Hold W against him unless its a last resource, and they should learn to break line of sight with many steep turns to deceive the killer and make him disoriented... that is, after they fix the absurd hitscan of the power while not enraged

Mobility: 9/10

Chase power: 4.5/10

Hit and Run effiency: 8/10

Preassure towards game progress: 6/10

Tracking: 1/10

Annoyed, Satan storms off to the furnace room and cranks the heat up to unbearable levels. Flames roar, molten lava bubbles, people scream.

He returns, expecting to see the Canadians begging for mercy‚Äîonly to find them sunbathing in lawn chairs, wearing sunglasses and grilling hot dogs.

Fuming, Satan storms back to the controls and does the unthinkable: he freezes Hell solid. Icicles hang from the ceiling, demons are shivering, and the screams are now just chattering teeth.

Confident he‚Äôs finally broken them, he stomps back to their room... but finds the Canadians high-fiving and cheering.

1jtifi0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boringmattress/comments/1jtifi0/boring_af_mattress/,Boring AF mattress,"TLDR: For 2 people in the mid-low 100 lbs body weight, this mattress is simply too hard. Plus the smell. The smell!! I simply cannot recommend, unless the person asking is closer to 200lbs body weight.

We have been looking for a new mattress for about a year now and so far have tried 3. I was doing research all online because I don‚Äôt like to deal with sales people, and I was looking at the usual Casper, Purple Mattress and etc. until I found Boring. I loved that this company isn‚Äôt flashy and the fact that they had simply one option at the time I was looking to buy. That option was the hybrid mattress. I bought that mattress and tried it for some time and I loved it‚Ä¶ but my wife did not because of motion transfer. So off it went to the spare room because I just could not let it go myself. 

After trying a cheap Amazon mattress which was simply hard as a rock, I decided to do my searching again. At about that time I got an email from Boring about a new All Foam (‚ÄúBoring AF‚Äù) mattress. Clever wording here, by the way. I bought it at a discount because it was a pre-order and we received it about a month later in late February.

The trial: The hybrid mattress had almost zero smell when we took it out of its plastic wrap. The AF mattress, on the other hand, had a very strong smell, almost like burnt coffee or caramel, mixed with some kind of detergent. We let it off-gas for a week and thought maybe that would do. We slept on it that first night, I woke up the next morning, got ready and went back to the bedroom and I could smell that smell in the bedroom again. We had obviously gotten used to it and it took leaving the room and coming back to notice it. We took the covers off and turned the fan on to try to get rid of it. In the end it took about two weeks to really get the smell out of it. We do live in a basement apartment, but being late February/early March, we couldn‚Äôt really open the windows and let cold air in (we live around Lake Michigan‚Ä¶ cold). So that is how we dealt with the smell.

As far as the comfort‚Ä¶ there was none. The mattress is hard. There is no sinking into it and offers barely any support. I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù 140lbs and my wife is 5‚Äô6‚Äù 110 lbs. I can tell the mattress is made for the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù American, which we are not. My butt sort of stays on top of the mattress and doesn‚Äôt sink enough to give my lower back any support. So after a while, I end up on my side and my arm gets tingly. I end up going back to sleeping on my back or roll over to my other side. It is ‚Äúrinse and repeat‚Äù all night. We had to take melatonin to be able to sleep decently, waiting for the mattress to break in. We tried it for a month (4 full weeks) thinking ‚Äúit will surely break in‚Äù, but no change. We can‚Äôt do it any more, so back to the old mattress it is.

I really wanted to like this mattress, but it will need to go back. ",2,1744023337.0,boringmattress,1,1.0,False

‚ÄúBack in 1991, while taking a break from training on the Canadian Olympic Equestrian Team, I decided to travel to Africa, a continent of such mysterious beauty and vibrancy. I found myself in the heart of the majestic Eastern Highlands region of Zimbabwe, where some of the world‚Äôs best Arabica coffee beans are grown.

Many years later, with my young family in tow, I went back to this beautiful place and bought a coffee farm. And so, Ashanti Coffee Enterprises was born. Life was good, as we made friends and gradually nourished the neglected farm back to a productive state. In 2003, we won the Zimbabwe Coffee Grower of the Year Award for our efforts.

But trouble soon brewed. As a result of President Mugabe‚Äôs violent campaign of farm invasion, our land was expropriated, and we reluctantly moved back to Canada. Fortunately, I partnered with other Zimbabwe coffee farmers who managed to keep their land, ensuring our exclusivity on Zimbabwe coffee in Canada and a steady supply of Ashanti Coffee.‚Äù[Ashanti Website](https://ashanticoffee.com/pages/greetings-from-david-wilding-davies)",3,1744023123.0,BuyCanadian,1,0.71,False

1jtibp6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jtibp6,Help with cup stain,"
Hi all, I‚Äôm hoping someone can help with this cup stain. It started as a water stain from a glass. I have absolutely no idea about woodworking or coatings so bear with me. I‚Äôve found the wood type is Oak, i‚Äôm unsure of the finish but I‚Äôm hoping some experts may be able to take an educated guess based on the sheen. The exact table is ‚ÄúCalia Coffee Table‚Äù from John Lewis if that helps.

Anyway, after trying to google and finding various solutions, here‚Äôs what my timeline has been 

- Mayo trick (tried leaving on for 10 hours) I think this may work in other scenarios, but in mine it seems to have made it worse, and turned it into an oil stain

- Iron over cotton shirt (did nothing, though i feel like this would‚Äôve worked if i didn‚Äôt do the mayo trick)

- Bicarb Soda (dry, leave on for 10 hours)

- Bicarb Soda + Water paste (clean in direction of wood grain, leave for 20 min then clean/dry)

None of these have helped 

Next recommendation I‚Äôve found is mineral spirits with 0000 steel wool, but i‚Äôm worried this could strip the finish or make an obvious abrasion. 

Does anyone have any recommendations? Trying desperately not to sand and refinish as it‚Äôs not my forte and the table is brand new.

Another note is John Lewis recommended to care for it with their ‚ÄúWoca Oiled wood Furniture Clean & Care Kit‚Äù, so do you think I should try the mineral spirits, then do a light sand and oil the whole top with that?

I really like the warmth these headphones have and so I would appreciate some reccomendations for some iems that are similar sounding. I'd mainly using them whilst studying, and maybe some light gaming, so they need to be relatively comfortable. I would like if they were S-type so they would be compatible with the higher quality cable that I already own but if they already have a good cable then this isnt really an issue. I have previously had the KZ zsn pro x but I didnt really like the top end as they sounded too sharp/sparkly for me. I also had the ccz coffee bean but their build quality was subpar and they were a little muddy.

Any help would be greatly appreciated,

1jti906,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1jti906/whats_your_experience_with_vyvanseelvanse_and_is/,"What's your experience with Vyvanse/Elvanse, and is there a relation with anxiety/feeling panicky?","Hi all, I've started with Vyvanse (Elvanse) since the beginning of February. Started with 20 mg for two weeks, since then and thus currently I'm on 30 mg. I've started with the meds because I have a toddler and I noticed I'm always exhausted, feeling like life is living ME instead of me having control over my life.

I haven't had trouble at work or in relationships (e.g. hitting my targets without quality loss, friends are honest with me if something's wrong), but I did notice that since I'm using medication, I can focus better. Filtering doesn't cost me as much energy and at work, I don't get as overstimulated as I used to. Which is great, because I have more energy reserves at the end of the day, when we're dealing with our toddler.

Now onto the side effects: I've noticed a very dry mouth, cold hands, and sometimes my hands are a bit sweaty. I can't take an hour long nap anymore, more like 15 mins. I'm not sure if I want to increase my meds to 40 mg.

I've taken one month off and since the 2nd of April, I've started feeling anxious. Or maybe panicky is a better word. It seems to start around the same time, between 10:00 and 11:00 am. I take my meds around 07:30-08:00 and I drink coffee during breakfast (08:15-ish). I don't know how to respond to these feelings. I just continue with what I'm doing. It doesn't seem to be related to social events (I've always loved doing anything social). I've tried to let the feeling take over, but it doesn't work like that.

I have had panic attacks twice before and both times started with a restless feeling at my stomach/under my sternum, followed by palpitations. I don't have those palpitations now.

I'm really trying to understand if this is something medicine induced, coffee induced, me being a parent, me having a month off and telling myself to 'make every day count', or maybe, just maybe... could it be that I've always felt like this, but never noticed? Because I've always been such a busy body?

Btw, I'm allowing myself to do whatever I want in the afternoons. Mornings are for productiveness. This is how I tackle the voice in my head telling me to 'make it count'.

PS. This might sound wild to some, but I'm also wondering if this could be related to being a lone twin who've become a mother. I wonder if having a child has made me feel anxious about losing them, triggering the trauma I've experienced in the womb. If there's any lone twins out here too, I'd love to hear your perspective :)

1jti17d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/1jti17d/my_boyfriend_has_an_attachment/,My boyfriend has an attachment,"I had never experienced anything paranormal before I met my boyfriend. We met in October of 2024 and began dating in november, I ended up moving in with him into his apartment in january. I know very soon but we were comfortable enough to do so and it helped both parties financial situation. My BF had never informed me that he believed he has an attachment before I moved in with him. One night we got into our first argument and we had been sitting in the living room and after i slightly raised my voice, the trash can in the kitchen ( which was maybe 10 feet away with a wall dividing the two areas) fell over. It spooked me and my BF proceed to apologize to me and informed me that stuff like that happens sometimes, sometimes when things get upsetting, sometimes when nothing triggers it at all. 


I‚Äôve always been a pretty christian, church goer on easter and christmas, but needless to say of course i believe in the paranormal. i just hadn‚Äôt experienced it like that. Now the part i haven‚Äôt told you guys is that the arguement with my boyfriend was about me and my best friend going to target to buy an ouija board that same day. He told me he doesn‚Äôt fuck with stuff like that and I told him it‚Äôs ‚Äúharmless‚Äù nothing bad could come from it. i was sorely mistaken. now nothing bad came from the board we had purchased because after my bf had informed me of his past with ouija boards me and my friend disposed of the board. 


When my BF was around 11-12 His childhood dog had passed away, he was obviously heart broken and he was kind of an odd kid from what i had gathered. He told me he was looking through the woods out by his house playing with sticks and dirt, stuff that kids do at that age. When he happened upon an ouija board, now from what i recall from the story, there was not a planchet. I‚Äôm not exactly sure what he would have used to use the spirit board but as a heartbroken kid that just wanted to see his childhood dog again he attempted to use it. he said he got a few words out (never told me what it said) but he never said goodbye. 


That is the story he told me that started it all. He would experience things in the home he lived in at the time that were unexplainable and not very nice. He even told me one time something pushed him down the stairs when he was home alone. he eventually moved out of that house before he reached junior high and moved to where his parents currently live. while i‚Äôm not sure if a ton of paranormal stuff happened while he was living there because he‚Äôs never told me any stories of that
house. When he moved out when he was 18 he would have stuff in his apartment that would move around but always assumed it was one of his roommates because he lived with two other guys. fast forward to the apartment we live in now, he moved in there a little less than two years ago. He moved in with his close friend who likewise of me had no information regarding that fact that my BF might have a ghost. (i hate calling it that but whatever) 

My BFs close friend only living there for about 9-10 months before moving back in with his mom. While my BFs friend told me it wasn‚Äôt because of what was happening, my BF is pretty sure it was. 


My BF is a pretty unserious individual and likes to call this stuff ‚Äúooga booga shit‚Äù but it‚Äôs just paranormal activity. I‚Äôm not sure of the timeline of everything but my bf said in the beginning of living in the apartment he would come home to the coffee table turned upside down, the mirrors that were previously on the wall (they were cheap 20 dollar mirrors that weren‚Äôt very heavy) on the floor, the papasan chairs they had in the living room (instead of couch in true bachelor fashion) face down on the floor. When stuff like that started happening he knew immediately that whatever it was, was not happy to be moving. His friend even informed me that the mirror that they had hung up, you could see into the living room through his room and he would see shadowy figures at around 2-5am almost every night that he would stay up. eventually things stopped being moved when he would leave the house and everything went back to what he thought was normal. When his friend moved out, one of his other friends moved in shortly after, not aware of the things that had occurred, he talked to my bf one night after living there for about 5 months that he would see people or shadow figures from his room through the same exact mirror. 


When i moved in, the activity had almost completely stopped by then, until the night we had that argument. While it was not very bad, sometimes the dishwasher door would slam on its own, or we would hear things in the kitchen while in the living room, we prayed over whatever it was but it doesn‚Äôt feel malevolent so i never really bothered to talk to anyone about it. 

We are finally moving into our own place because that apartment is kind of a shit hole (the rent was cheap give me a break) Our washing machine had been leaking so the landlord had to come and remove the machine and found sub floor damage and mold underneath it. due to that, we decided to stay with my parents until we move into our new place next week. This caused a little bit of unhappiness in whatever is attached to my BF

We started staying here on thursday night , it is now sunday night, and more things have happened than the 3 months that i was living in the apartment with him. My parents have a mother-in-law sweet that we are staying in currently. its pretty separated from the rest of the house with its own stairs that lead to a door outside except for a door in the kitchen area that leads to a hallway with the laundry rooms and my sisters rooms. Around october of 2023 my parents suffered a really bad house fire that caused my whole family to be misplaced until about a month ago when the renovations had finished. Before i moved in with my bf I was living in the MIL sweet while the rest of the house was still under construction. I was paying my parents about a thousand a month for rent ( which i could barely afford.) anyways, the electrical systems work great everything‚Äôs great whatever. So the whole apartment area (MIL sweet) has dome lights that you can dim with a switch that has a dimmer built into it. When i was living here previously i would dim the light all the way down and sleep with that. We started staying staying here and on the first night i pass out pretty fast, the next night we are having dinner with my mom and me and my BF are sitting at the dining table and the medium sized vase with glass pebbled in it (pretty heavy object) moves 2-3 inches towards me. I see it out of the corner of my eye but don‚Äôt say anything until i look up at my BF. He‚Äôs giving me the straight face ‚Äúi didn‚Äôt like that‚Äù look. after dinner we go upstairs and he immediately 
proceeds to tell me he has NEVER had anything like that so obvious happen directly in front of his face. He explains it as though something was waiting for him to look at the vase so it could happen. He then proceeds to tell me that the lights in the room the night before would brighten and dim on their own. Like not just a little bit, like to the point where it was almost completely bright  and they would proceed to go back dark again. And of course as we are having this convo, the fully lit lights start to dim. Not too much but enough for us to notice. As if it is responding to what we are talking about. It is currently sunday night at 2 in the morning and i cannot fall asleep. the previous nights i had been working all day and didn‚Äôt give a shit and just wanted to play video games and then go to bed. 
but now i am sitting in bed next to my asleep bf typing this up because about 2 hours ago i was sitting on the couch after getting out of the shower (with my towel still on) while my bf was in the bed and the light started to dim and brighten again. Me being kind of a butt, i jokingly suggested that ‚Äúmaybe the lights just do that‚Äù not even a millisecond after those words exit it my mouth the lights come fully bright. im scared, my heart is racing and my boyfriend responds ‚Äúmaybe he didn‚Äôt like your attitude‚Äù lights go dark. i can feel my pulse in my fingers at this point. I do not know what to do but My boyfriend definitely has something attached to him and im not sure what it is but i dont like it. I‚Äôm sorry I made this story so long but i felt like it needed some backstory. i‚Äôm not sure im gonna be able to sleep tonight because the lights have been dimming and brightening for the past two hours on their own. I‚Äôve tried not to focus too hard on it but it‚Äôs just so scary. 




BTW i know some of yall are gonna be mad but me and my boyfriend nicknamed it ‚Äúphil from HR‚Äù trying to put a little humor in a much darker place is easier for the both of us but im scared that naming it may have made it a little to real. ",8,1744021753.0,Ghoststories,5,0.9,False

Which delivery apps do you guys prefer in Canterbury?

I signed up for the Tesco Clubcard and Sainsbury‚Äôs Nectar card to get better grocery prices‚Äîare there any others you‚Äôd recommend that are worth it?

Which is your favorite day/weekend trip from Canterbury? Don't have a car.

Is the 26-30 Railcard definitely worth it?

And last but most importantly: where the hell can I make some friends? (M26 here).
