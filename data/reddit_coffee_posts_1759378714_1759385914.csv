I am a 21-year-old male with a height of 5'3"". I have been going to the gym consistently for the past 6–7 months. Earlier, I had joined the gym a few times but could not stay consistent. This time, however, I have maintained discipline and regularity.

My main concern is about my height. Is there any possibility of increasing it to around 5'6""? Along with that, I am also focused on fat loss. When I started the gym, my weight was 67 kg, and currently, I am at 59 kg. However, I am struggling to reduce side fat and chest fat despite trying hard.

Here’s my current diet routine:

* Morning: 2 rotis with sabzi and dal
* Pre-workout: Oats, peanut butter, and black coffee
* Post-workout: Paneer sandwich and creatine

I want to know whether I should make any changes to my diet for better results. Apart from fitness and diet, I also want to work on improving my overall personality. If anyone has suggestions regarding lifestyle, grooming, or confidence-building, I would really appreciate it.

Thanks in advance for your guidance!",1,1759385680.0,indianfitness,0,1.0,False

1nvvxmm,https://i.redd.it/j768kfw11nsf1.png,Don't build productivity apps! Max 1-2 features!,"That's the advice we got over a year ago when we started to build Strukt. We understand if you don't want to read all this, the link is at the bottom to try it out, but we would also love if you wanted to read our story :)

We got hit with so much backlash, ""there already is tons of productivity apps out there"" and we shouldn't focus on having many features just focus on 1-2 features. Well.... We did the exact opposite, because we're productivity nerds, we love self improvement. So we wanted to build the ""final boss"" of productivity apps.

We took a minimalistic approach to not make the app cluttered and to make if focused on the functions, we didn't want 500 animations, 23 pop ups and 72 colors in your face when you're just trying to write in your journal or update your goals etc.

We focused on adding as many features as we could think of which delayed the release for some time, but we wanted to add the core features. We're constantly updating the app and adding new features. To not make it cluttered you create your own dashboard on the home page and only add the functions you're interested in. So if you're just interested in goals and journaling the other features won't bother you or be in your face.

And we also focused on making it as customizable as possible. Everyone is different, and we truly wanted to make it a place where the app is a reflection of you, you can make the app theme pink and add flower photos, but you can also make it black themed and keeping it minimalistic. You can even customize the notification messages.

We're super focused on user feedback and keep building the app according to what our users want. We have a user feedback section in the profile page where users can send in feedback and we keep updating the app based on that!

Hope you want to give us a shot! Here is the link: [Strukt: Productivity Hub](https://apps.apple.com/se/app/strukt-productivity-hub/id6751095052?l=en-GB)",15,1759385198.0,SideProject,4,1.0,False

|**Ledger Footnote (Elias):** July 28 — August 22, 1885. Curtis brings assays and jars; the county promises review; counsel fractures under offers and fear. Surveyors mark the rail’s approach. Mrs. Gleaner funds mitigation and designs a parlor. Private showings begin. Josiah’s influence coalesces. A man does not return. Curtis and I prepare a conservative sealing of the Odessa Shaft. The choices that follow are small, quotidian, and ruinous in ways paper cannot fully explain. E. Thatcher|

A ledger gives dates and sums; memory gives the smell of dust on curtains and the small brittle sounds of men altering their consciences. This chapter is rendered in sections so each scene can live and breathe on its own: voices, measures, the seam’s small attentions, and the people who tried to put numbers between it and the rest of us. Mr. Curtis is at my shoulder throughout—measured, furious, and quietly moral. Mrs. Joy Gleaner will interrupt when she must, because she always will.





# I — The Council Room: Proof and the Quiet of Evidence

The council chamber smelled of coffee that had been reheated twice and of the varnish left over from the mayor’s last attempt at civic dignity. The long table wore ink stains like small medals of service. They set the jars in a line along that table, each one wrapped and tagged, like sleepy captive things. Curtis had the posture of a schoolmaster forced into law: steady hands, a voice that measures rather than commands.

He laid out the magnetometer folio with the care one shows a map of an enemy. The black spikes rose and fell like teeth. He set the phonograph in the center and closed the case as if locking a confession.

Curtis: (soft, precise) “Magnetic anomalies concentrated within thirty meters of the headframe. Fe ions elevated in near-field water. Organometallic traces we do not expect from our ore profiles. Acoustic captures consistently reproduce fragments of human speech—names, phrases—adaptively.”

He wound the crank. The needle dragged; the wax coughed; a small voice—half-breath, half-echo—threaded through the hiss: a child’s name.

Harris’s hand trembled as if the sound had been a rebuke. “It said ‘Tommy’,” he breathed. “Like my mam when I was small.”

Amos Tull—who kept accounts like prayers—closed his fingers around a ledger. “If you close the shaft the pump dies. Men go. Bread stops. Who pays for the parish then?”

Curtis laid a jar forward until the lamplight caught a strange bloom in the water. “I ask for a moratorium on exhibitions. Independent verification. If the town continues to show the drift, you expose visitors to a demonstrable phenomenon.”

The mayor, Hargrove, thumbed the edge of a receipt and then glanced toward the doorway as if expecting a deus ex machina. The door opened like a stage cue and Mrs. Joy Gleaner stepped in: silk, hat, a practical smile, and the air of someone with funds and the habit of telling people what should be done.

||
||
|*(Mrs. Joy Gleaner — aside.)* “You will forgive me if I speak plainly,” she said to the room and, with that same small insolence, to you reading this later. “Towns do not survive on caution alone. They survive when someone pays for the pump. I will underwrite independent assays and an infirmary. Call it influence if the word comforts you; I call it underwriting civilization.”|

Her cheque slid onto the table with the soft authority of currency. The clerk stamped Curtis’s packet: *representative to inspect in due course.* In Calico, “due course” is a polite way to say: someone else’s calendar will be asked to act while we feed ourselves.

Curtis wound the phonograph again. The wax made the same cough and offered another name like a coin placed on an account. The room felt smaller, the stakes more present.

Elias: (writing) *Assays documented. Request for moratorium. Mrs. Gleaner offers funding. County to inspect in due course.*

The council’s decision—what to do with evidence and appetite—would be written and re-written in the ledger many times over. But at that table the choices were still raw: a jar, a cheque, a whisper of a name.





# II — The Mayor’s Parlor: Drafts, Piles, and the Architecture of Compromise

The mayor’s parlor smelled of lemon oil and the quiet rustle of paper plans. Langford spread his charcoal sketches over the cloth like vows. The plan framed the headframe at a polite distance: a veranda curved to offer the view without the temptation of approach, a parlor for tea, a conservatory, twenty rooms to begin.

Mrs. Gleaner outlined the program as if enumerating the features of a fine life. “Guided tours at set hours,” she said. “Uniforms for guides; a physician on call; a small infirmary; weekly assay postings in the vestibule; no ad hoc showings; a fund from ticket sales for the pump.”

Langford: (pencil hovering) “Piles; deep foundations; a plenum to ventilate under-floor air; separate cistern for cooking water. Doing this right changes the cost.”

Curtis placed his magnetometer folio on the charcoal and drew a few lines with his finger. “Drive piles to the depth where readings return to baseline,” he said. “Monitoring wells at the corners and center. Exhaust plenum with dampers. Antechamber for anyone experiencing disorientation. No basements where ground runoff can collect.”

Langford hesitated, then re-drew. The cost of conscience was there in graphite—clear, linear, unafraid of arithmetic.

Mrs. Gleaner laughed as if at a private joke. “I will underwrite the piles and the initial monitoring,” she said. “I will require the brochure to read ‘Restored with care — Independent monitoring.’”

||
||
|*(Mrs. Joy Gleaner — aside.)* “Type sells confidence,” she told the architect and you. “Put ‘independent assays’ in a tasteful line and people will pay to be properly frightened. A neat brochure is the hand that steadies the purse.”|

Langford reconfigured his elevations, and the parlor took the shape of a mitigation: woodwork and policy braided together. The town would now sell a measured terror with a cup of good tea and a posted magnetometer strip.





# III — The Surveyors: Iron, Theodolites, and a Needle That Sang

Harlow’s survey party arrived with tripods and chains, tools that made the town feel connected to a world of schedules and freight. They set stakes and a theodolite near the headframe. The needle twitched, then wavered. It refused to sit above a stake placed too near the lip. Harlow moved it a few paces and the instrument steadied.

Harlow: (practical) “Magnetic interference. Mark a cautionary band. We’ll route the spur to the north and adjust ballast.”

The prospect of a rail spur tightened the town’s tolerance for risk. With the rail came wages and an easier way to ship timber and linens. The theodolite’s wobble was geology and a warning rolled into one; men read omens into physics if they wished. Langford smiled at the new cost and translated it into line-items for his bills.

Elias recorded the coordinates where the instrument balked. Curtis made a note in the margin of his folio. The town now moved between two concrete things: the seam below and the iron that wanted to pass by.





# IV — The Saloon: Folklore, Wagers, and the Old Men’s Arithmetic

The saloon is a place where a town’s future is argued in quarter-measure and betting slips. Old Tom, the Cornishman, told the assembly of knockers—small, domestic spirits of old mines who appreciate rhythm and respect. He advocated pebble offerings and a certain gentle trick of leaving a coin in a pocket.

Old Tom: “Leave a token. Keep the rhythm. Teach the seam to take small things.”

Señor Vasquez lit a candle at the assay office window. A woman sewed a coin into her son’s shirt. Rituals old as the hills folded into new arrangements: a curated relic case in the parlor to redirect offerings into the pump fund. Science stood beside ceremony now, not to displace it but to bureaucratize it.

Curtis watched from the end of a bench, ledger open. He listened as men justified appetite and explained away conscience with arithmetic.

Curtis: (soft) “They’ll rationalize it. Money will soothe conscience, and the ledger will eat the names we do not want to remember.”

Elias: (noting) *Town knitting old practices to new policy. Ritual becomes municipal revenue.*

These small domestic actions were the bones of compromise—folk caution made into civic practice.





# V — The First Private Showing: The Cage and the Missing Man

They performed the first private descent at dusk. The businessman—a neat man in a watch-chain—stepped into the cage with an air of confident amusement; Josiah supervised the hoist with the care of a man who relished the authority he had recently obtained. The cage descended with the soft sound of the throat swallowing breath.

Down in the drift the lamps were small moons; timber took on the color of memory. The cage should have been hoisted back with the same party it had lowered. Instead it surfaced with a smaller burden. Gloves lay on the lip like abandoned sentences; a cane lay on the boards like a last punctuation.

Josiah’s voice, steady as a ledger, announced it: “He took more than his ticket allowed.”

Curtis played the spool for the council. The wax coughed, offered a knock, a name, then a reply—one clean syllable: “more.” Then silence like a page cut off mid-sentence. The businessman’s son went white; some men averted their faces.

Investor’s son: “That’s father’s voice at the start.”

Josiah: “He sought more.”

Elias: (writing) *Private show results: imperative reply; disappearance. Establish fund; demand moratorium.*

The town made a fund and, quietly, a market for private entry reformed into a market for early access: “associates,” men willing to pay for the prestige of seeing first. The missing man’s chair remained at the inn; his bills piled on his table like evidence of a life interrupted. The seam had taken price; the town began auctioning hazard.

||
||
|*(Mrs. Joy Gleaner — aside.)* “I funded assays and the infirmary,” she said softly when asked. “If you must choose a villain, choose me and be dramatic. If you want a benefactor, do me that courtesy. Either way—buy curtains. They make the room look finished.”|

She smiled, wrote another entry in her own book, and the council wrote checks to the same tune.





# VI — The County’s Pace and the Town’s Shorter Deadlines

Curtis drove the jars and the spool to the county seat and returned with stamped receipts and the phrase *due course*—the law’s promise to do something in time. The county representative insisted on a formal petition from the council before he would exercise the powers to mandate closure.

The council split. Some men, with bread on their minds, said: let the sales continue. Others, with children in the room at home, said: caution. Money moved to the center of argument. Mrs. Gleaner offered an expedited assay fund; the county clerk accepted the fees and wrote a date into his docket. The town took the county’s lenient nod as provisional permission.

Curtis cursed the bureaucracy. “Paper is a covering,” he told Elias. “They file it and sleep. Action is what keeps men alive tonight.”

Elias: (quiet) *When the law moves slow, men move faster to feed themselves.*

Private lists filled. Men who had been reluctant now bought seats. The seam, patient and practiced, was fed by human eagerness. The council’s prodigious moral job became a matter of receipts and signatures more often than of sermons.





# VII — Josiah’s Consolidation: Rules, Rosters, Authority

Josiah’s power was incremental. He enforced rosters and rules—two men per descent, witnesses, no souvenirs. People deferred because a man who can make rules is a man who has found purchase. Josiah spoke the language of order and numbers. Men signed his lists because they feared the alternative.

Josiah: (firm) “Two per cage. Witnesses sign. No mementos.”

He did not preach; he administered. The town liked that. There is a comfort in rules—structured danger is easier to swallow than ungoverned risk. Curtis demanded presence of public witnesses and a posted assay before any showing. Josiah acquiesced in the letter where he could, and the town's calm thickened.





# VIII — The Arithmetic of Complicity

The missing man became an entry in the ledger and a fund for condolences. “Associates” paid for early showings. Men with appetite for prestige were given curated tours. The moral calculus narrowed: feed the living today, count on conscience tomorrow. Curtis insisted on transparency—assays published before any showing; independent witnesses present; strict no-souvenir policy. Some signed the pledge. Others inked the blank spaces with the same hand that writes “later.”

Mrs. Gleaner used the parlor as a vehicle to re-channel offerings: glass cases for relics, donation boxes to fund the pump. The old rituals were repurposed into municipal charity.

||
||
|*(Mrs. Joy Gleaner — aside.)* “If you want to be pure, buy your bread and write the sermon later,” she said, folding a cheque. “I prefer being useful.”|





# IX — Curtis’s Protocol: Instruments as a Form of Mercy

Curtis codified an ethic into procedure. Magnetometer sweeps occurred twice daily on radial lines; monitoring wells were placed at corners and center; water assays ran weekly; brass tags were fixed to timbers to detect nudges; microcamera housings were buried and then re-buried after dust and battery life proved fickle. He required an antechamber at the view point, a physician on-call, and a public posting board where weekly numbers were pinned.

Curtis: (calmly) “Record everything. Witness everything. Publish. If men must be kept close to the drift, they will be witnessed. Evidence is a deterrent.”

When a brass disc was nudged and an audio spike coincided on the spool, Curtis interpreted it as evidence of a field that answered attention. He refused to use the spool as a spectacle. He would play it for the county man and for witnesses, not for entertainment.

Elias: (noting) *Curtis turned priest of numbers and guardian of witnesses.*

Curtis’s persistence gave the town a framework: evidence, witness, and public posting. It did not remove appetite, but it created a paper trail.





# X — The Town’s Small Abnormalities

The seam’s effects spread into little domestic irregularities rather than grand melodrama: the mill sounded an odd bell-tone at dusk and then ceased; eggs arrived with lace-like cracking and were shelved as curios; three clocks stopped at the same minute one afternoon; a newborn calf bore a pale badge of white on its flank. Children dreamed doors that asked questions and woke with names on their tongues. Mothers sewed coins in hems, and old Tom’s pebble practice became municipal: a small pebble box collected in the parlor and turned into a fund.

Curtis recorded each of these minor anomalies with the arithmetician's care that had become his religion: date, witness, reading. The town treated folk measures and scientific measures as complementary protections—prayer and protocol both in the same toolkit.

Elias: (soft) *In ordinary life the seam left traces like a child's hand on a window—small smudges that would not wash away.*





# XI — The Plan to Seal: Surgical Precision

When the county’s pace and the private showings threatened to cost more lives, Curtis and I designed a surgical plan: to collapse the throat behind the first door with enough controlled material to jam the aperture but not enough to destroy the headframe. Timers, wedges, packed blocks and timber—calculated to choke rather than to tear the ridge.

We rehearsed rope-work with men who had no interest in spectacle: Harris, Murphy, Miguel, Owen. We chose witnesses who would not profit: the preacher, a surgeon from the next town, and a county clerk who had been persuaded by Mrs. Gleaner’s fees to attend as a courteous observer.

Curtis: (measured) “We act with witnesses and measurements. No souvenirs. We will document everything so law sees intent to preserve life, not to profit.”

Elias: (signing) *I sign the witness list and the coordinates. I feel the ink is heavier than the pen ought to be.*

The plan was a surgeon’s list of incisions, each step an attempt to close a wound without killing the patient.





# XII — The Night Before: Confessions and Quiet Preparations

The town slept thinly. Lamps burned at porches. Women stitched coins into hems. Josiah came to the assay office with his cap in hand and the look of a man who had paid for a roof and accepted the cost.

Josiah: (low) “If I sinned, it was to keep my children's plates full.”

Elias: (plain) “You bought bread. That makes a bargain you will keep. It does not erase consequence.”

Curtis checked the magnetometer and handed a folded packet to me: coordinates, charges’ order, witness roster. We read the list like a prayer—names in one column, signatures in another. Mrs. Gleaner put an envelope on the desk: *Sign the ledger honestly. I will keep my receipts.* She clasped my wrist like a contract.

||
||
|*(Mrs. Joy Gleaner — aside.)* “A woman pays to keep a town from emptying,” she said. “I prefer necessity to purity.”|

Her declaration was as practical as a check; she arranged curtains in her head even in the dim.





# XIII — The Sealing: Timers, Dust, and One Last Name

At dawn we met at the headframe. The county clerk observed with his neat notepad but would not order closure; his presence was documentation, not command. Langford checked beams; Curtis ran a final magnetometer sweep. Fuses were placed; wedges readied. Men moved like watchful craftsmen, their faces carved by the knowledge of what they must do.

The charges fired with the dry crack of stone settling: a cough, not an explosion. Rock slid, timber groaned, dust climbed to a pale cloud and hung like a thing that wanted to be witnessed. For a breath the seam answered as if some old habit of taking names had not yet been taught to accept packing. A nickname—Murphy’s father’s name—spoke clearly in that moment and Murphy found his knees wanting to walk. He braced and did not move.

Miguel swore later that in a gap of falling stone he saw a pale silhouette like his abuela smiling at him; whether that was mercy or a trick of light and terror I cannot say. Men hammered wedges until the throat would not breathe without extraordinary persuasion.

Curtis read the magnetometer: the spikes diminished. The spool, later, coughed only an almost-speech, like someone who had lost the vocabulary of demand and now kept only rhythm. We signed the witness list with hands still capable of labor.

Elias: (writing) *Sealed throat with witness signatures. Magnetometer trending down. Post weekly assays.*





# XIV — Aftermath: Relief, Recriminations, and Redesign

They dined at small tables that night with a softer appetite. For a time water tasted less like blood, children slept with steadier lungs, and the mill sang a less weird note. Investors grumbled about delays and raised the polite threat of suits. Langford drew deeper piles and cross-braces. Mrs. Gleaner issued another cheque for additional piers and a bigger plenum that pushed air away from the lip at the precise angle Curtis requested.

The county filed our witness lists and assays. Law, slow and deliberate, would later measure intent and outcome; for now it marked compliance. Curtis kept posting weekly numbers. The parlor’s vestibule gained a public posting board where magnetometer strips and water assay numbers hung like a civic prayer.

In the tavern some men called us saviors; others called us cowards—compromisers who bought a town’s sustenance while sacrificing a purer moral stand. The ledger recorded both accusation and thanks in equal ink; it made no judgment.

||
||
|*(Mrs. Joy Gleaner — aside.)* “You will remember me kindly or villainously,” she said while smoothing a new set of curtains. “I prefer to be necessary. Curtains and pumps both require funding.”|





# XV — Reckoning and the Ledger That Remains

Time tempered the sharpness of the sealing into a long watchfulness. The seam did not die. It patiented; it shifted its appetite from name-calls to low rhythms and murmurings. Curtis’s later cylinders—recorded in anechoic tents and private runs—showed counting-like rhythms and low tonal material but rarely clear names. Stimulus, he concluded, breeds specificity. Starve attention, and the calls lose their hooks.

The town adjusted. Langford’s piles held. The parlor rose on deeper timbers; the railroad delivered freights twice a week; children apprenticed in the linen rooms. The ledger sat on my desk like a book that refused to forget. I kept it clean and precise as a man keeps a family record.

||
||
|*(Mrs. Joy Gleaner — final aside.)* “Buy a postcard, come and sit on the veranda, tell your story,” she said, pouring tea. “Tell me as villain or savior—I’ll take either. Curtains are bought and children need shoes.”|

She folded the ledger shut and walked back into a house that had cost more than oak and nails.

**Part End Note**

The engine of prosperity rolled closer, the town buzzed like a hive newly fed, and the Gleaner House rose to shelter more than men. Yet with every plank we fastened and every spike we drove, the ledger in Curtis’s hand grew thicker, and our nights grew longer. The log of events filled with detail that refused to be explained away by superstition or ledger alike. If the town were to reopen the Odessa, we would do so with ears to the ground and eyes wide. The danger felt smaller when named; it did not feel smaller when it answered.

Next we will trace the spread: the supernatural phenomena extending into the town proper, the deeper excavation under Curtis’s watch, and the mounting friction as prosperity and dread tighten their marriage.",1,1759385112.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

|**Ledger Footnotes (Elias):** **July 20–27, 1885.** Knocks multiply and mimic. Samuel Pike found dead; silver arranged like tribute. Josiah returns changed; bearing a token. Curtis widens tests, refuses to be party to any exhibition. Town frays. I assemble a measured descent. E. Thatcher|

A ledger will tell you what day a man drew pay and which tool he left behind. It will not tell you how a lamp flattens a face so that the eyes look like coin, or the way the smell of oil and iron hangs on a man after he comes up from below. Memory keeps those things. So I write from it.





# I — The Lip That Learned to Speak

Watches were a new habit older men had not burned away. I stood the lip with Curtis and Harris one night when the wind was full of grit and the town’s lights were only a handful of slow stars. Curtis had the phonograph wrapped in a battered case like a man carrying a small, dangerous relic. He placed the diaphragm to the timber and wound the crank with a care that looked priestly rather than preposterous.

He tapped the timber—three even knocks. The drift answered, neat, like a man who had been practicing somebody else’s rhythm.

He tapped again in a different rhythm. The drift matched at first and then altered by the smallest fraction. It was not a mistake; it was a choice. Harris let the crank drop as if the machine itself might bite him.

“It said ‘Tommy,’” he croaked, finger at his throat. His father, long dead, had called him that once when he stole fruit in summer. The name sat under his ribs like a bell.

Miguel’s rosary tightened so hard the beads clicked. “It calls like abuela,” he said. “Soft, like it has learned how to be loved.”

Curtis wound another spool. “Record,” he said. “If it mimics, we must know how it samples.” He set the diaphragm and let the thin hiss fill the space between us. When he played it back the spool showed us what it wanted to teach: each of us heard something different — a mother’s hum, a boy’s nickname, a lullaby half-remembered. The spool did not give a single truth; it gave variants.

“It’s not an echo,” Curtis said flatly. “It recomposes. Adaptive mimicry. If it calls a name you will go looking for the thing that bears that name. That is the trap.”

I felt the trap like cold iron. Names call the way hunger does. If the seam could call in intimate tones, men would answer.





# II — The Bunkhouse: Claims and Quiet Rage

The argument between Samuel and Josiah had the slow, grinding quality of two men that had been rubbing at each other for weeks. Samuel’s temper is loud by nature; Josiah’s new reserve was a quiet thing that made the glare of Samuel more visible.

“You go down at odd hours,” Samuel said one night, the lamp making his sharp face sharper. “And you come up with pockets heavy as prayer. Who else goes with you? Who else gets your hush?”

Josiah set a small silver disk on the plank as if stating a fact. He avoided the lantern’s glare and the men’s eyes. “There are prices a man pays for his household,” he said. “You’ll not understand till you’re the one who needs them.”

Samuel’s laugh made no sound of humor. “Hiding prices is theft.”

“It is balance,” Josiah answered, voice flat as a ledger’s stroke. “The seam keeps a different account.”

They left with many words that night. In a town a mouth can be a weapon as much as a hammer; sometimes words split seams no one expected. I cannot say who threw the first blow. I can tell you who was found later.





# III — The Finding: A Ritual Placed in the Dust

We found Samuel because someone went down for a trivial thing and came back without it. The lamplight flung a pale oval across him and caught the silver like a cruel offering.

He lay on his back, skull crushed inward as if a slow, deliberate weight had been applied. Around him the silver had been laid in two precise rings, one at his head, one at his feet, like a book clasped closed by metal. Curtis measured the spacing of the bars with the steadiness of a man taking notes after a storm.

“Deliberate arrangement,” he said. “This is not random.”

Murphy, the man who curses loud and prays quietly, dropped to his knees. He touched a coin and pulled his hand away as if the metal might burn. I looked at Josiah. He stood pale but composed, like a man who had written out a balance and accepted the sum.

“You argued late,” I said to him.

“It keeps accounts,” Josiah answered simply. There was no tremor in him. I felt a colder thing than grief then: a man who had settled his own account was not apt to weep for others.

Curtis set to work — photograph the evidence, record bearings, take witness statements. He moved like a man whose tools were his prayer: measurement. “Document,” he said. “If there is a law, then law requires record.”

We buried Samuel in a plain box. The ledger took his name and cause of death like a clerk; memory kept the silver.





# IV — Curtis’s Protocol: Measurement as a Kind of Prayer

Curtis made the orchard of his methods. He drew up a field protocol as if a new pest had come to town: three water samples at set points, magnetometer readings at fixed intervals, phonograph runs at measured distances, brass tags left along a line to see whether anything would disturb them.

“Proof will quiet profit,” he told me when he handed me jars and a map. “If we can show a physical effect, then law has something to hold. If not, rumor is the only currency left.”

He left brass discs in the drift; one was nudged a single inch by morning. “Moved, not stolen,” he said. The cartridge assays came back with odd readings: iron and trace organometallics out of proportion to the seam’s expected output.

When town merchants asked him for a certificate that they could hang beneath velvet ropes, he put the jars between them and said, “I will not be the official of a carnival. I will provide a declaration to the county. I will not sell tickets.”

He became my ally because his resolve was not for show. He would not be bent to the town’s appetite for coin.





# V — The Town’s Small Abnormalities

A hundred small things began to sew a new story. Clocks stopped and restarted ten minutes fast. Mr. Calder’s loaves sprouted lacey mold in the shape of doors. A blacksmith’s bellows sang at an odd pitch for an hour and then was ordinary again. Children woke tasting copper and drew doors in chalk they would not scrub away.

Señor Vasquez spoke in old Spanish of *puertas* — thin places — and the Cornish men muttered of a “knocker” under the hill. Folklore and measurement sat at the same table and both took a slice of the town’s attention. When superstition and science both point at the same seam you know the argument is not easily resolved.

Curtis wrote it all down—patient as a town clerk and twice as stubborn. People began to look at their children the way one looks at a ledger after a bad night of counting: with fear in the margins.





# VI — The Descent: Rope, Light, and the Answering Hand

The men who volunteered to go with me were the ones I trusted. Harris, steady in the work of the hoist; Murphy, who had kept a thousand knots taut in his hands; Miguel, trembling but brave for his abuela; and Curtis, with his coils and spool. We took rope, lamp oil, a small controlled charge to be used only as last measure, and the phonograph itself.

We descended into that dark where light becomes a poor thing and sound thickens. The knock followed like a hound who learned the call and practiced it in the dark. At one place it called Harris by a boy’s name he had not been called since his father lived. He faltered and swallowed and went on because there was a foreman with a rope and a man who kept records.

Curtis wired a diaphragm to the coil and propped it against the timber. He let the spool run and we moved beyond the place where men always work and into the place where old timbers groan and the air tastes faintly of metal and old cold. In one narrow mouth the gap widened, and a pale wrist — long-fingered, slow — glided through, feeling, patient. Miguel, who had come for his abuela, let the small pouch fall without a sound. The hand closed and withdrew. The knock afterwards was like the tick of a book closed.

We came up with jars clouded when kept near the seam, spool recordings that changed each time you listened, and compasses that jittered the closer you came. Curtis wrapped the evidence in cloth and wrote like a man building a case: timestamps, coordinates, witness signatures. “If men will not be stopped by conscience,” he said, “they may be stopped by law.”





# VII — Josiah’s Quiet Bargain

Afterwards Josiah sat with me beneath the assay office eaves and put a small silver disk in my palm the way a man hands over a certificate. “It asked for names,” he said. “It accepted my offering and promised a kind of peace.”

“What kind of peace?” I asked.

“A roof for the children,” he said. “Medicine for the old. A way not to have to leave.” He said it like a man reading terms into a contract and feeling no shame. There was a peace in his face I did not trust; it was the calm of a man who had received a receipt for a debt I could not understand.

He would not—could not—speak plainly of who gave what or how the counting had been done. He only said, “It keeps accounts.” And in that sentence he taught me something terrible: the Door measures in things we keep close and cannot afford to surrender.





# VIII — Curtis’s Logs (Extracts)

||
||
|**Curtis: Field Log 7/22 — Phonograph Spool 3** 00:10 — Tap pattern initiated (3 / pause / 2). Response matched then modulated. 00:35 — Playback 1: Response contained phonetic overlap approximating “Ma—” (observer: Miguel). Subsequent playbacks altered. Hypothesis: localized acoustic field sampling memory fragments and reconstituting them adaptively. J. Curtis|
|**Curtis: Water Assay 7/23 — Sample Set A** Sample 1 (well above seam): baseline. Sample 2 (adjacent seam): Fe ion elevated 2.6× baseline; trace organometallics present. Sample 3 (downstream 50m): copper bloom present after 24 hours. J. Curtis|

Curtis underlined figures until ink left an impression. He believed the county would have a slower hand than a man’s grief; he believed also in the stubbornness of proof.





# IX — Miguel’s Offering; The Hand That Closed

Miguel came to the lip with his small leather pouch and knelt like a man offering a votive. The hand slipped through the seam and took it. He crossed himself and kept his head down for a week. After that small offering we found more: rosaries, coins, small trinkets left at the door as one leaves seeds for harvest. Men began to imagine the seam as a scale they could feed.

But you cannot feed a ledger with names without the ledger waking to collect; some prices are paid in things not stamped by any mint. Samuel was one form of payment; Miguel’s pouch another. Men started to sleep badly.





# X — Mrs. Joy Gleaner: Asides, Design, and the Parlor of Promise

Mrs. Gleaner has always been the town’s forward voice and its gentlest mercenary. When she speaks to a room she often speaks to more than the room. She breaks the wall that divides speaker and spectator and addresses a you that is sometimes the reader and sometimes the city she will make in her head.

||
||
|*(Mrs. Joy Gleaner — aside.)* “Now, listen,” she says to the unseen guest as much as to the men gathered before her. “You and I both know what sells: a singularity wrapped in comfort. Give a person a clean bed and a cup of tea and you may ask him, afterward, to pay for wonder. Hotels are not brick and mortar alone—they are promises with linens and coffee. If you want Calico to be known, you put a parlor where people can feel safe and then you show them the thing on purpose.”|

She turned to Curtis with the practicality of a woman who trades in real estate and reputations. “If I build a hotel on the ridge,” she said, “tell me the minimum to make it safe. Tell me where to set piles. Tell me what will keep my guests from sleeping with the taste of fear on their tongues.”

Curtis sketched. “Drive piles beyond the affected strata. Build raised foundations with ventilated crawlspaces. Keep any water supply well away from suspect run-off. Independent assays and public reporting before construction.”

||
||
|*(Mrs. Gleaner — aside.)* “He’s tedious—he will be tedious to your tastes—but he keeps a town from being sued. We will fund the assays and print the results on brochures: ‘Restored with care—supervised by a qualified scientist.’ You will sleep in a room with a view, sip tea, and tell your friends about our bravery. Or you will curse me later in a local paper. Both make for good history.”|

She wrote Curtis a retainer with a flourish and a smile. He accepted only on the condition that his reports be made public if danger was evident. She shook his hand, turned to me, and said with a candor that felt like a business plan dressed in velvet: “We will make the town last. We will be careful.”

Whether “we” meant protection or profit was a question that split men’s faces into light and shadow.





# XI — Closing the Throat: Plan and Precaution

Curtis spread his maps across the assay table and drew lines like a surgeon’s incision. “We can sever the throat,” he said. “A controlled collapse at the narrow passage behind the door should choke the route. Use charges placed precisely; watch the bearings; document witnesses.” He did not flirt with dynamite’s romance. He spoke of it as a tool to be measured.

We assembled a small party of men who would not profit by spectacle: Harris, Murphy, Miguel, two steadier hands. We packed rope, wedges, charges only sufficient to bring in rock and pack the aperture. Curtis insisted on witnesses and a record of everything.

I slept poorly that week. Men offered their hands for holes in the roster one minute and signed contracts for guided tours the next. The town’s ledger tilted under the weight of immediate need. I thought if we must make an ugly choice, it would be better to make it clean and recorded.

||
||
|*(Mrs. Gleaner — aside, last.)* “You will make novels of me, I know, and that is fine,” she said, addressing you again as if we shared a private joke. “Savior or monster, you will call me what comforts you. I prefer titles. They frame a life. We will build a parlor and a pump and call it progress. You may hate me later; I will have bought the town a season. Isn’t that itself an act of mercy?”|

She smiled, and men smiled with her, some with gratitude, some with the terrible blankness of those who think the ledger will cure what prayers will not.





I close the ledger for the night with Curtis’s spool wrapped and the coil of wire coiled neatly. The men who will go with me are steadier than the money-men; they do not scheme the way investors do. I have charges measured and a small band of witnesses who will attest to what we do, and why. If the town will not be saved by a law that moves slow, then I will try to save it by a law written in something steadier than coin: witness, record, and a foreman’s hands.",1,1759385030.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

**AS SOON AS YOU RECEIVE AN INVITE:**

First things first: book a date! Sooner is better. When it comes to time off work/school, generally ask forgiveness, not permission (unless there’s something really big you’d be missing that day). Triple check that you have the right date/time on your calendar (especially if the school is in a different time zone from you.) *Then* ask for time off, explaining that a certain school has offered you an interview on a particular date.

**Your next (logistical) steps:**

* Plan out the logistics of interview day. Do you have somewhere with strong wifi, good lighting, somewhere you won’t be disturbed? Does your background look okay? 
* Contingency plans:
   * Where would you go if that spot wasn’t available? Could you get there quickly?
   * What would you do if the wifi dropped? (E.g. are you prepared to quickly switch over to a phone hotspot?)
   * What would you do if you were interrupted? (You should have a sign on the door to minimize the odds of this.) Highly unlikely, but did in fact happen to me: what would you do if there was a fire drill? (Or another crisis?)
* Do you have something nice to wear? Have you thought about hair/makeup? Do you have any visible tattoos/non-ear piercings? Do you need a haircut?
   * Throughout the cycle, make sure you always have your interview outfit with you. I don’t care if it’s a holiday, a short trip - interview invites follow no rules and they will come when they come.
* Make sure your zoom is updated to the latest version. *(This is your sign to do this now!)*
* Check your application portal regularly - there may be forms to sign or info sessions to schedule before your interview date! They might not email you, so check at least (at least!) once per week up to your interview date.

**FOR STANDARD (NON-MMI) INTERVIEWS:** 

**Normal ways to learn about the school:**

* Skim their website, learn about their curriculum - don’t burn *too* much time doing this, it rarely comes up.
* If you’re interested in research, track down the names of a few PIs you’d consider working with if admitted. If you’re interested in community service, look up some orgs. Definitely know the name of their free clinic (if they have one).
* Many schools offer pre-interview info sessions, which are usually optional. Regardless of whether they track attendance, I figured it was worth an hour out of my evening to learn something about a school and potentially make a good impression, so I made a point of attending when possible.

**My bizarre trick that ended up** ***really*** **paying off:**

* I don't have any family members in medicine, so I felt that there was a lot of hidden curriculum I was missing. When I got my first interview invite, I reached out to a friend of a friend who was a current student at that school and learned a *ton* from our conversation - so as the ii's kept coming in, I kept reaching out to med students. I usually aimed for around 2-3 students per school.
* I generally reached out over LinkedIn. Use up all your free LinkedIn messages, and sign up for a premium free trial if needed. The LinkedIn messages you send them need to be short (200 character limit).
   * Here’s an example of one I sent to another alum from my school: ""Hi! I'm a former \[mascot\] (class of 2024) applying to med school. I just got an interview invite from \[school\] for \[date\]! If you're available, I'd love to chat. My number is \[X\]. Thanks!""
   * This is not a script so much as a guideline. Ideally, make sure you mention some connection you have to the person. Definitely include your interview date to convey that sense of urgency.
   * Look for people from your undergrad, people who have worked the same jobs as you, won the same scholarships, played the same sport, run a club you'd hope to join, etc - just about any connection is fair game! (See “[The Strength of Weak Ties](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2776392)”)
* When you meet with them - this is your chance to get your questions answered! *Come prepared* with anything you’re curious about, whether that’s about interview strategy, the school itself, the transition to med school, anything on your mind. This is also your chance to ask questions about the school that you might be uncomfortable asking on interview day.
   * Remember - these are busy medical students! You’re asking for their time and offering nothing in return. Be polite! Make your gratitude clear!
   * Sometimes the students you meet with will offer to connect you with other current students/organizations - when in doubt (especially if there’s still lots of time before your interview), the answer is “that would be great, thank you so much!”
* Of all the questions I asked, these were the most high-yield (a term I fear is becoming a permanent fixture in my vocabulary). That said, there's no need to get through all of these, and feel free to add your own! Remember, the goal is to have a conversation where you learn something useful for interview day (and beyond), not a checkbox grill session.
   * (If you’re told in advance who your interviewers are) Do you recognize these names?
   * What is the institution most proud of about itself?
   * What do I need to know in order to sound like I did my homework about the school? (Translation: what’s important about the school that might not be front-and-center on their website?)
   * What about the school would you change if you could/did you have any hesitations about attending?
   * (If they’re a current student/applied relatively recently) How was your interview day? What is the style of the interview? Any traps to watch out for?
   * Why did you choose this school?
   * How are you being affected by \*gestures vaguely\* everything going on right now? (Translation: how’s your school’s federal funding doing? What's happening with the shutdown/vaccines/reproductive care/gender-affirming care and their ability to teach about it? How has the school been handling any protests? Or any other recent shake-ups and/or scandals?)
   * Other than finances, what do you think I should be weighing when choosing a school?
   * Was your interviewer matched with you based on your application?
   * (Last question) Anything else I should know? (They always say no - and then often share another nugget of info)
* Many students end the call with “reach out if you have more questions!” or something along those lines. One person even offered to have me crash on their couch if I ended up visiting! *Make sure to jot this down in your notes!* You may end up speaking with a lot of people - remembering who offered to tour you around campus, buy you a coffee, help you weigh your options, etc, will be very useful down the line
* In your interview, you can absolutely mention that you reached out to and met with current students! Independently meeting with students is not cheating - it's going above and beyond to (1) learn about the school and (2) demonstrate interest. Don't forget the names of who you spoke to, especially if you get a student interviewer (they're often curious, plus you'll get a chance to say nice things about their friends)

**Practicing:** you can start this step any time - even before you get an invite! 

Important questions to really nail (most important in italics):

* *Tell me about yourself (no more than 2-3 min max)*
* *Why medicine? (Bonus question: why MD/DO, and why not NP/PhD/something else in science/healthcare?)*
* *Why are you interested in our school?*
   * This is your chance to talk about the students you spoke to, the info sessions you attended, etc
   * This question is in large part a vibe-check. Are you clearly enthusiastic about the prospect of attending their school, or are you just blandly listing off some student orgs/electives/etc that you found on their website?
* *Tell me about a time when you…*
   * *Faced/overcame a challenge*
   * *Had an ethical dilemma*
   * *Disagreed with someone (often the same as “ethical dilemma,” but worth prepping both)*
   * *Worked on a team*
* Tell me about \[an activity\]
* Tell me about your research
   * Rarely asked, but often blundered. Standard bad answer: ""I pipetted this reagent into that reagent, and then I ran this assay, and at the end of it all I got a figure and it had four lines on it.""
   * Use plain English and don't include extra details - I don't want to know the name of the alphabet-soup receptor you studied or signaling molecule I could go my whole career without ever hearing about. Assume that, if your interviewer wants to know some specific detail about your methods, they'll ask.
   * My structure: basically an incredibly accessible abstract. (1) Open with the problem you're trying to solve/question you're trying to answer and *why I should care about it*. (2) Briefly (briefly!!) explain the methods and your role (lots of people forget to explain what they actually did). (3) Briefly explain the results and why they're interesting/exciting. Also mention any posters/pubs/etc. (4) Wrap up with future directions and/or big takeaways either for this research or for you as a researcher
* How do you de-stress/tell me about a hobby
* Describe your ideal career
* What’s the biggest issue in medicine today? (Bonus question: and what needs to be done to address this issue?)
   * If there's one specific type of inequity you wrote about in your application, you should be especially prepared to answer this question
* *Questions for me?*
   * This will almost certainly be the last question they ask - and you do need to have prepared questions!
   * For interviewers who weren't students (faculty, adcoms, random people filling in), my go-to first question was ""what's your role in the medical school?"" Then I could ask questions from there - ""so what do you hope your students take away from their EM rotation?"" ""How do you feel about X new change in your field?"" etc
   * Let go of the idea that you're asking questions to learn something. You're asking questions so your interviewer gets a chance to talk about something they're passionate about, and so they leave the interview with a positive impression of you.
   * Do not ask questions like ""can you tell me about this one random club/lab/etc you've probably never heard of?"" You can absolutely ask hard questions - but don't just ask questions for the sake of asking them.
   * My very last question was usually ""can I get your email address so I can send you a thank-you note?"" They almost always say yes, but some will ask you to send notes through the admissions office instead.

There are infinite lists of interview questions on the internet. I wasted a ton of time on them before realizing they were pretty useless since they were all variations on the same few questions anyways. Specifically, there are hundreds of versions of “tell me about a time when…” - but you really only need a handful of stories at the ready (the ones I listed above)

You can outline (outline! NOT script) in a google doc, but you'll see the most improvement from practicing OUT LOUD, ideally without your notes. So many things look okay in a google doc but sound dumb when you say them out loud. Practice in the shower, practice with your voice memos app, practice with your family/friends, practice with your cat - just make yourself actually say the words.

**FOR MMI INTERVIEWS:**

**Practicing:**

* Suggested viewing - 10 min background on MMI (I have no affiliation with Dr. Ryan Gray): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjgJJtPNeiY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjgJJtPNeiY)
* There are tons of MMI (multiple mini-interview) scenario compilations online - I’d suggest practicing talking through some of them, *on voice memos*. It will be painful to listen to these. It’s worth doing.
* The most common weakness applicants have is inability to fill the time (generally 6-8 minutes). I’d aim to be comfortable speaking for 3-5 minutes, with the assumption that you’ll get asked follow-up questions by your interviewer.
   * One thing that’s important to know is if the interviewers are instructed to ask follow-up questions if you finish early, or if they’ll just stare at you awkwardly until the timer runs out. You can generally find this info on SDN or by asking (or letting someone else ask) on interview day
   * Also find out if you’re allowed to take notes - someone more neurotic than you will likely ask this on test day
* Tracking down current students isn’t quite as important for this - but still worth considering meeting with 1-2 people so you have a sense of what you’re walking into

My structure for answering an MMI question:

* Briefly restate the scenario (1-2 sentences max) - sometimes this is an item on the rubric so worth doing
   * ""In this scenario, I'm the doctor for a patient who doesn't want a flu shot""
* If relevant, talk about the bioethical principles in conflict, and why
   * ""Here, the principles of beneficence and autonomy are in conflict. As the physician, I want what's best for the patient's well-being - I want them to have a lower risk of catching the flu. But autonomy states that the patient should be able to make their own medical decisions and choose whether or not to consent to treatment, even if their providers disagree with them.""
* Lead with empathy, especially for scenarios around inequity/super painful decision-making
* Leave your assumptions at the door. You don't have enough info to take a solid stance - you need to fill in some blanks to answer the question. But you need to *explicitly* say what blanks you're filling in! This is where you use lots of if/then statements.
   * If the patient doesn't believe that vaccines work, then...
   * If the patient is concerned about side effects, then...
   * If the patient is uninsured and worries they can't afford the vaccine, then...

**ALL INTERVIEW TYPES:**

**On the day of:**

* Make sure you’re well-rested for your interview and eat a good breakfast! 
* As for caffeine: I always felt too jittery even without caffeine, but if you’re not functional without it, it’s ok to have caffeine. You know your body best and I trust you to make the best decision - just make sure to account for the interview day nerves.
* Bring your government-issued photo ID. Only one of the 22 interviews I attended asked for it (Stanford), but worth having just in case. Have your AAMC ID number on hand as well
* Plug in your laptop! Earbuds on hand in case there’s an audio issue. Phone on do not disturb (but nearby in case there’s a zoom issue!)
* Put up a sign on your door - “med school interview, done at X o’clock.” 
* How’s your wifi? Do you need to use your hotspot? How does your lighting look?
* Show up early! (5-10 min should be okay)
* Snacks and water at the ready (do NOT eat on camera, even if they say they won’t judge. Water is okay)
* Do not have your notes up during the interview! The only acceptable notes to have is a list of the names of the students you spoke to, if relevant (if you’re worried you’ll forget their names)
* There will likely be an icebreaker and/or “fun fact” question with the other applicants. This is low-stakes. Don’t overthink this
* There will also likely be a few hours of info sessions/student panels. They will likely be a bit boring. Pay attention, ask good questions if you have them - don’t dominate the conversation, but it’s worth making your voice heard if you have something constructive to say/ask - you are probably being assessed by the adcoms
* Do your best to make “eye contact” with the interviewer - this means you should look at the camera, not your interviewer's face! (It helped me to put their zoom box near the top of the screen)
* Remember, that adrenaline you’re feeling isn’t anxiety - it’s excitement! You’re confident, you’re calm, you’re excited to be there! Breathe. *Smile*. You’ve got this!
* Before leaving, check in with the adcom/administrator in the main zoom room that you’re good to go, and make sure to thank them for inviting you

**Post-interview:**

* If thank you notes for your interviewers aren’t *explicitly* not allowed, I’d send them - it’s just the nice thing to do. Ideally, they should be personalized (referencing something from your conversation) and reiterate your interest in the school. Will your note move the needle? Probably not. But your interviewers are largely volunteers and they deserved to be thanked for their time.
* Definitely thank all the students who helped you prep for your interview! (A quick text/email/LinkedIn message will do)
   * Let them know if you get in/get waitlisted too! They could be valuable resources and they deserve gratitude for their role in your application cycle

**For those who don't already have enough anxiety in their lives**

Here are the most difficult questions I got asked during my interviews:

* ""It's clear you're incredibly intelligent. And I'm sure that's not the case for all of your classmates. I guess I'm just curious - what is it like for you? You spend all your time being around all these classmates who just can't keep up with you. It must be incredibly frustrating to be around people who are just... slow""
   * This felt super rehearsed - I think it was the adcom's way of screening out people who thought they were god's gift to premed
   * I was definitely a bit flustered but I tried to respond with humility. I talked about how we all have strengths and weaknesses and I don't think I'm any better than my classmates, adding that if I found it frustrating to be around people who didn't understand scientific concepts then I wouldn't have worked as a science tutor
* ""When I interviewed here a few years back, I'd already been to a few other interviews and was sitting on a T10 A, so I straight-up asked my interviewer why I should choose this school instead of the one I already got into. So if you're considering any other schools, I'd be happy to talk it through with you and help you weigh your choices""
   * Felt like a genuine offer from a student interviewer who was a very kind person (and a huge help to me in weighing my options after I was accepted) - but that question also felt like a trap
   * I responded by thanking them and reiterating my interest in their school. Displaying anything other than excitement about the school I was interviewing at felt risky
* ""Why didn't you say anything on your application about being URM? What do you mean you're not URM? Of course you are. What country did your parents immigrate from? What's their immigration status? Anyways, you should check out this program at my school for URM students.""
   * There are lots of questions that are wildly inappropriate for an interviewer to ask. You should not expect them. But you should probably prepare for them anyways

We met during my final year of medical school, and we clicked instantly. Back then, we saw each other almost every day. We would grab coffee at Starbucks, have lunch together, and over time started doing more special things like going to concerts or musicals (we both love theater).

Now that we’ve graduated, we don’t see each other daily anymore, but whenever we do, it feels like no time has passed and we catch up easily. She often tells me she values me and our friendship, and I’ve honestly given a lot of weight to this bond — at one point, I even considered her my best friend.

But sometimes I get the impression that maybe I’m “just another friend” to her. I’m not really into Instagram (I post maybe once or twice a year), but she is. She constantly posts stories with friends — photos, outings, events. The thing is: whenever we hang out, she takes photos with me, but she never posts them. She’ll happily post pictures with other mutual friends, but never with me. On my side, I sometimes post a photo with her when we meet, but again, she never shares them.

Like I said, I don’t really care much about social media, so it’s not the lack of posting itself that bothers me — it’s the contrast. Why post with everyone else but never with me?

Another thing: a while ago, I told her I was taking a very important professional exam, even shared the exact date with her. I took the test, weeks have gone by, and she never asked how it went. I could bring it up myself, but honestly, it feels like she doesn’t really care. I don’t expect her to keep track of my life 24/7, but I thought close friends usually check in about important milestones. That’s what I would do for her.

I’ve heard people say that friendships are often circumstantial, that as we move from school to work and different phases of life, our circles naturally shift. So I’m wondering: am I overthinking all of this? Should I just not give importance to these details, or are these signs that the friendship isn’t what I thought it was? Should I start letting go instead of holding on so tightly?

Any advice would be appreciated.

TL;DR: I feel like I’ve invested a lot in a 3-year friendship, but my friend doesn’t always show the same effort (never posts our photos, didn’t ask about my important exam). Not sure if I’m overthinking or if the friendship is fading.",1,1759384680.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

*A Supernatural Tale of Greed, Madness, and the Door to the Underworld*

# Chapter I – The Twelve Days Beneath Calico

# The Town, the Shaft, and the Men

In the blistering summer of 1885, Calico lay under the kind of heat that bleached the very bones of the desert. The town shimmered like a mirage—false fronts warping in the glare, dust curling in long banners along the main street. Porch planks creaked under boots, and the air was thick with the mingled smells of horseflesh, sweat, and stale whiskey.

Main Street was a study in illusion. The storefronts looked proud from a distance, but their timber frames rattled like skeletons in the wind. A saloon’s swinging doors banged hollowly against one another, as if keeping time for some ritual no one dared name. The wind carried grit sharp enough to sting the skin, and every gust seemed to whisper like a voice half-heard, promising coin or warning of something much older beneath the earth.

Calico was built on promise, and promise had to be fed. The Odessa Shaft was its mouth. From that black throat rose the constant metallic heartbeat of picks and powder, the steady rhythm that drove men to drink, gamble, and dream bigger than their purses. It was labor that killed as often as it enriched, but no one spoke of death except in whispers, because death walked openly here and needed no invitation.

At the shaft’s yawning mouth stood Elias Thatcher, foreman and keeper of the men’s fates. His lantern swung low, a soft glow like fireflies trapped in seaglass, throwing uneven light across the slope of the hill. He was broad of shoulder, his jaw scarred and bristled with the rough stubble of a man who had known both youth’s recklessness and labor’s punishment. His eyes, pale as weathered steel, studied the shaft not as a vein of fortune but as a living thing that might betray him.

He knew mines. He knew how they breathed, how they sighed when the timbers strained, how they groaned before collapse. And something in him told him that Odessa was different—hungrier, more cunning.

“Josiah!” he barked, voice carrying like gravel rattling down a sluice.

Out of the shadow stepped Josiah Bell, Elias’s second: a lean, sharp-nosed man with eyes like a hawk and a mind that read stone as other men read Scripture. He held a copper-lantern in one hand and a hammer in the other.

“Seventeen feet past last week’s face, give or take,” Josiah said, swinging the light so it played across the rock face. The silver seam caught and kept the glow, pulsing faintly like frozen lightning. “Pure silver, Eli. Pure enough to blind a man.”

He rapped the vein with the hammer. The note that rang out was no ordinary chime—it was too high, too sharp, too clean, like glass cracking under pressure. The sound crawled into the ears of every man within reach, setting their teeth on edge.

Miguel Ortega, youngest of the crew, just shy of sixteen, swallowed hard. His wiry frame seemed smaller under the weight of his shovel. “Feels like we’re carving into frozen lightning,” he whispered, brushing grit from his brow. His Spanish lilt turned the words into half-prayer, half-curse.

Samuel Pike, brash and quick to laugh, though his laugh carried more bravado than courage, slung his jacket over one shoulder. He studied the seam, its jagged bolt stretching from ceiling to floor. “Frozen lightning means riches, boy. Means our names hung on banners in every saloon west of here.” His words shook with something close to awe, though he masked it as ambition.

Curtis, the schoolmaster, lingered a step apart, notebook in hand. He was not of the miners but had found himself among them, a man of thin frame and sharp features, spectacles sliding perpetually down his nose. He watched as though the vein itself were a lesson to be copied into margins.

Around them milled the rest of the men—Reuben, Harris, Murphy—faces lined by dust, want, and hard luck. Each man’s expression carried its own story: suspicion, hunger, or a dogged refusal to acknowledge fear.

Elias’s eyes moved from one face to another. He knew men as well as stone. He knew the moment when laughter turned sour, when greed turned to envy, when a shaft claimed not just ore but sanity. The sound of the vein’s strange song gnawed at him already, a warning dressed as promise.

“Keep your blows true,” he said gruffly, “and your bellies fed. The earth gives, but she takes twice if you forget yourself.”

The words carried little weight among men fevered with the dream of silver, but Elias said them all the same. It was habit, like a prayer muttered by one who doubts but dares not stop.

The seam gleamed back at them, its light unnatural in the torch glow, alive in a way stone had no right to be. And though none would admit it, every man present felt a shiver crawl his spine—as though Odessa itself had inhaled, waiting to see which of them would be the first to exhale wrong.







**The Following is a Log Written by Elias Thatcher**

I keep this as ledger and remembrance. Names and times and the words between men are the stitches by which you hold yourself when the world leans wrong. Here, then, is how the twelve days began: faces, voices, and the small, terrible facts I could record before the earth asked for more than coin. These are the faces that peered into Odessa’s mouth as the twelve days began.



# 

# Day 1 — Friday, 26 June 1885

The morning rose in a haze of heat that already felt personal—your shirt glued to your back before you had the chance to finish the first cup of coffee. Main Street was a strip of white that reflected the sun until the light hurt. A dog slept in a gutter and woke only when the headframe creaked like an old man bending for prayer.

At the lip of Odessa, the men moved in the small choreography of long-practiced labor: tighten a harness, snap a leather glove over a raw thumb, nod at the mate whose life is in your hands for the next eight hours. Elias watched from the bench by the hoist, the lantern slung on his belt catching the sweat on his knuckles like a cheap jewel. He counted the men with an eye that had learned the economy of names — who had family, who owed wages, who brimmed with a quickness that invited trouble.

Josiah came up from the drift wiping grit from the seam on his sleeve. He carried not just a hammer but an habit of reading stone; his gaze traveled the vein as a preacher’s might a Bible, landing on verses nobody else noticed. He stopped a pace from Elias, glanced at the seam, and tapped it once with the handle. The note was high and clear—too crystalline for ordinary silver. It held, like a tone in a violin string struck by no visible finger.

Miguel, sleeves rolled, hands gnarled from work, inhaled and let his breath out slow. “It’s singing, señor,” he said, and the word came out rounded with a mixture of awe and fear. For Miguel, every strange thing moved between faith and superstition; his abuela’s prayers came as readily as his promise to get his sisters better shoes when he had coin.

Samuel, leaning on his pick, cracked a grin that lacked its usual warmth. “If it’s singing, it’s good singing. Means coin,” he said. He thumped his chest with the back of his hand as if fortifying himself for a life yet to come.

Elias’ voice cut across them, economy distilled into command. “Don’t get greedy. Keep blows true. We move by measure and timber, not by wonder.” He set the ledger on his knee and ticked names as if that small accounting would tether them to reason.

Curtis hovered on the edge of the men’s work, a man from books in a place of smoke and callus. He crouched, measured the seam, and drew quick lines. “Reflectance differs,” he murmured. “Not just polish—something in the crystal.” He tapped the page with a pencil, more pleased than frightened.

They worked the face until the light went thin and the heat settled into a low hum. At sundown the saloon door swung, the jukebox of crude fiddle and the clink of glass rising to meet it. Men talked of horses and women and future houses with proper roofs. Under the laughter, however, the seam’s note lingered in memory like a single phrase of a song you can’t finish.

That night Elias lay awake longer than usual, listening for the shape of the mine in the dark. The headframe creaked in the wind. Down in the bunkhouse, someone slept with hands twitching, whispering syllables that had no place on a prospector’s tongue.







# Day 2 — Saturday, 27 June 1885 (second shift, Curtis’s instruments)

They came down early to measure the seam in every sensible way human instruments allowed. Curtis had returned with a brass compass that jittered in the pocket like a small animal. He set it on a rough-stone workbench at the drifts mouth and watched the needle spin, first steady, then shuddering as though rebuked by an invisible hand.

Elias went through the checks: lamp wicks trimmed, powder boxes inventoried, rope inspected. The men joked through it—a brittle cover for a shared tension. Reuben and Harris argued over a cigarette; Harris accused Reuben of pinching a plug of tobacco. Words were smaller than fists and lasted longer.

“Measure the pulse,” Curtis said before the sun had climbed. He timed the hum between strikes and between breaths. He set the pocket watch on his knee and tapped the face in time with the seam’s faint throb. “If there is a cycle—if it is periodic—then we can chart it. That’s what keeps us from superstition.”

“Or we chart a time to meet a creditor,” Samuel said, trying to keep the mood light but now less sure of his own voice.

Miguel moved like a man slightly afraid to break a living thing. He brushed his palm along a portion of the vein and flinched as it seemed to catch the lantern light like a surface that swallowed flame. A bead of sweat rolled down his temple and fell onto the rock as if in payment.

At noon, a small argument broke like a skittered stone. Murphy accused Piedmont of leaving a brace half-set. They argued loudly enough that Elias stepped between them and barked a command that trimmed their dispute like a scythe. Yet the dispute left a residue: pick marks were uneven, hours cut shorter. Men worked in smaller bands, and laughter became rare.

In the assay office after the shift, Curtis spread his papers. “A cycle of about thirty seconds,” he said quietly. “If you listen—” He demonstrated, tapping his foot to a rhythm. The seam’s hum rose and fell in a pattern that, when intoned under lamp glow, felt less like a physics problem and more like a heartbeat borrowed. Elias watched him, uneasy at the ease with which Curtis turned dread into hypothesis.

Elias penned a short entry in the ledger that night: “Strange reflectance. Men eddied toward superstition.” He left the ledger open on his table as if the weight of ink might anchor them.







# Day 3 — Sunday, 28 June 1885 (dreams, Sunday service, and the preacher’s words)

Sabbath did not empty the town entirely of labor. But the frame church filled more than usual; men and women crowded the pews, hands callused and faces lined with desert sun. The preacher’s voice rolled thick with Bible phrases turned toward current fears.

Elias sat near the door, a man of action among a congregation of supplicants. Josiah—who’d been quieter with the seam—sat across from him, thumb tracing the wood of his Bible. On the way to church, Miguel had practically dragged Samuel by the sleeve, whispering anxious questions about the seam’s “song.”

The preacher, his collar flanked with dust, did not shy from metaphor. “The Lord tests us as He tested Job, with things we do not understand,” he said. “But remember—temptation of gold is a trick played by the heart.” He paused and his eyes met Elias’. “Keep your men from pride, Elias. Pride will cost more than coin.”

At the pew’s edge, old Señor Vasquez crossed himself and muttered in Spanish for the saints to watch over the boys. The congregation prayed for safe hands and closed eyes.

After service, Curtis lingered, caught at a page of psalm and translated one line into a notation about rhythm and cadence. “Men look to scripture,” he said softly, “to order what frightens them. That is not weakness—only a human way to map the unknown.” His hands shook as he explained, perhaps from excitement or from the cold that lived in the mine despite the desert heat.

That night a small gathering formed in the bunkhouse—men balancing between bravado and fear. Samuel recited roguish tales of men who had found riches in the face of worse signs, while Miguel leaned on a carved cross he’d made the night before. Harris thumbed a coin and traced patterns into the rim like a prayer wheel.

“Two men to a shift,” Elias said, mostly to himself. He looked at Josiah and the second’s jaw tightened. “Do not go alone.”

Josiah nodded, but his smile carried something else: a private resolve that felt to Elias like the clench of a fist under a coat. Late that night, Elias heard Josiah step out and head toward the shaft. The foreman rose, collar up against the breeze, and followed only as far as the hoist. He watched Josiah’s lantern swing and felt the familiar chest-squeeze of a man who knows other men’s secrets and the thin rope by which those secrets hang.







# Day 4 — Monday, 29 June 1885 (fractures in the crew and the first knocks)

By the fourth day, tempers frayed with the closeness of reward. Samuel argued with Miguel over a working face with the ferocity of a man defending a claim. Their voices cut the cavern like the scrape of a chisel.

“You think you earned the right to take it?” Samuel spat.

Miguel replied, words in Spanish and English, a bid for dignity in a tongue split by horizons. “I have been here every hour. My hands have the blisters.”

Elias stepped between them with the quiet authority that had kept the crew in line more than any bellow. “Hands down. We divvy by labor. We do not steal from one another.”

But the argument left the mood brittle. That afternoon the brace on a timber split with a shout of wood that sounded like a shot. The men moved quick and practiced—lashings, wedges, a new brace set in place. They worked as if speed might outrun a nameless fear.

Night closed and with it a sound that made men pause mid-breathe: three slow knocks—patient, deliberate. The first came from the far end of the drift and seemed to crawl along timber and rock until it flowered at the chamber where the seam shone.

Harris covered his face with his palms. “From the wall,” he managed, voice thin.

For a long moment, no one spoke. The lamp flames shivered as if a wind had passed through. Samuel swallowed and laughed brittlely, a grin that had been smeared with fear. “Rats,” he said, though his voice lacked conviction.

Elias stepped forward, making the practical decision by habit. “Check timbers. Look for loose rock and wind. If nothing, we mark it down and not feed it with talk.” He had spent his life preventing panic from becoming action. Practicality, for now, was the tether.

Josiah moved with a different resolve: he ran a lantern along the walls, close enough to see the grain in the timber and the fine webbing of hairline fractures in the stone. No loose rock, nothing to account for the sound. The knocks did not come again in the hours they watched, but the silence thereafter felt full, like a lung waiting to take more air.

Down in the bunkhouse that night the men sat in smaller groups. Old stories surfaced: miners in other regions who had heard knocks that vanished when answered. They told those older tales like conjurations—mouthing the end so the beginning would not catch them unready.

Curtis recorded the event, his handwriting getting cramped and thin with the strain. “Unexplained acoustic source,” he wrote. He placed the tattered paper beside Elias’s ledger as if two accounts might together hold a truth neither alone could.

Elias lay awake and listened to the settling of the town. He heard the headframe groan, the distant cluck of a wind-sifted shutter, and once again, that threefold echo somewhere between dream and waking. He wrote in the ledger: “Brace failed without cause. Three knocks in the drift. Men eddied toward fear.” He underlined the last word.







# Day 5 — Tuesday, 30 June 1885 (small rituals and a hush that spreads)

A hush followed the knocks like dust settling after a wagon passes. Men changed small things without conscious agreement. Harris started keeping a copper coin in his palm each time he descended. Murphy whistled tunelessly in the shaft, a noise craving order. Miguel began to fold devotions into his pocket before going below—a scrap of cloth with a saint’s picture tucked into his jacket like a talisman.

In the mornings, Elias conducted briefings with more force. “No one goes alone,” he said, the order repeating like a prayer. “Mark the seams. Timber up old braces. Congruent shifts.” He felt ridiculous repeating the obvious, but a foreman knows that ritual is sometimes stronger than reason.

Curtis returned each morning to take measurements. He placed a compass near the seam and then twenty feet away, and the needle warbled near the door as if buffeted by some invisible field. He sniffed, jotted temperature, measured the time between perceived knocks. “There’s correlation in human report,” he said. “If everyone hears it, that lends credence to its physicality.”

Samuel, restless and chafing, began to talk too loudly. He told a story at noon about a strike in the hills where a man dug up a coin and was rich for a year, and then gone. Men laughed at parts of it—but laughter no longer felt like fellowship. It was a brittle defense.

That afternoon, the seam showed another oddity. A small pocket opened, and inside the chink was something bright and round. Samuel found it first: a copper coin, green with age and not from any mint the men recognized. It lay on the dust like a deliberate offering.

Miguel recoiled. He crossed himself and said something in Spanish that Elias could not catch entirely—it sounded like a warning. Samuel smiled faintly and slipped the coin into his pocket, the prize of the day.

“Leave it,” Elias said. “If it is an offering, do not make practice of it. We do not barter with things we do not understand.”

But the coin made talk. At supper the men whispered about tribute and taking only what the ground would permit. Even the dogs pressed a wary nose when the seam’s glow seemed to meet the lantern light.

It was in that small evening hush that Josiah’s gait changed. He stood for a long time by the seam as if listening to a conversation no one else could hear. Miguel watched him across a distance and made the sign of the cross twice over his chest.

Curtis wrote in his notebook long into the night, making little diagrams of field gradients and acoustic maps. He muttered: “If we can measure fields and responses, we may yet derive mechanism.” The words were his tether against the unknown—numbers instead of prayers.







# Day 6 — Wednesday, 1 July 1885 (secrets, midnight trips, and the seam’s answers)

That night around midnight Elias woke to the sound of a lantern swinging shallowly in the drift. He dressed and went down to see—part foreman’s duty, part curiosity. The hoist worked slow and the shaft gaped like an animal’s mouth.

Josiah was there, alone, at the edge of the chamber with his back pressed to the gold-lit seam. His lips moved, breath fogging in the cool air. Elias watched him from the ladder’s shadow—saw Josiah’s hands move in some rhythm, the fingers working as if tracing the inscription though not touching it.

“What are you doing?” Elias asked softly.

Josiah started, rubbing his eyes as if from sleep. “Just listening,” he said. “She speaks in the dark.” He smiled then, but the smile was thinner and colder than the laugh he used in the daylight.

“You don’t go alone,” Elias said. He had issued that command already, but it felt important to say anew.

Josiah shrugged, and there was a look in his face that made Elias feel hollow—like a man whose charted course had been replaced by a needle to the north and who could not do anything but follow.

They talked until dawn, low-voiced, of the seam and the possibility of a pocket. Josiah said, “Names slipped through my sleep. I woke with them upon my lips.” Samuel, who’d come down to fetch some water, listened and scoffed, but the scoff was thin.

Meanwhile, Curtis recorded the midnight temperature. The seam yielded no ghostly breath, but the compass needle again jittered near the seam as if repelled or attracted. He did not stay to philosophize with Elias. He returned to his papers. “Data,” he said. “We collect it and then we see what it suggests.”

On the surface the town felt a little smaller: shutters closed sooner, children called inside earlier. A woman at the mercantile told Elias she’d heard of animals avoiding the land near Odessa. People’s small rituals intensified. Even the grocer wrapped his wares tighter than normal.

That afternoon, Samuel and Miguel shared a silence that had teeth in it. They worked together but their closeness had changed. They washed tools and did not speak of the coin or the midnight talk. Elias watched them take small furtive glances toward the chamber as if the seam had become a pulpit and each man both parishioner and heretic.

Josiah’s visits increased. He brought with him odd implements—an old iron token, a rusted religious medal he’d found in a pocket before he left a job years ago. He laid such things flat at the edge of the seam and said nothing more than the simplest words: “For the road.”

Elias felt the hairs on his forearms rise whenever someone placed an offering. He kept his hand over his revolver more often, a superstition masquerading as duty.







# Day 7 — Thursday, 2 July 1885 (rumors, the mule, and the town’s unease)

Night gave no relief. Rumors scented the street air while men did their best to ignore them. Word moved through Calico like a small, slithering animal—first in whispers at the saloon, then in the moral admonitions of the preacher and, finally, as practical decisions at the mine head: watch changes in output, keep ledgers current, expect investors to hear and to come.

That morning a mule went missing from the livery. It was the kind of problem a mine notices immediately: a mule was money, time, and practicality rolled into an animal. The halter lay on the ground where the mule had slept; tracks led to the lip of the field and then simply stopped midsentence. Men followed for a time but the desert swallowed the trail as if ashamed to have witnessed anything at all.

The loss tightened tempers. “If someone’s taken it for profit,” Murphy growled, “I’ll string ’em up myself.”

“No proof,” Elias said. “We still check for stray tracks and coyotes. Don’t jump to the other horse.” He ordered a search, grudging and thorough—the men fanned lodges and gullies, checked for dried hoof prints and drag marks. But no sign of the mule showed where tracks had stalled like a sentence cut in half.

Into that fissure pushed the seam’s hum and a multiplied whisper: was the town itself being stolen? Was the earth answering and taking what it liked?

At noon, a messenger from Barstow rode into town. He carried a formal letter and a woman in a fine hat—Mrs. Joy Gleaner—who favored the town with investment talk and the idea of marketing Calico as a destination as much as a claim. She sniffed the air with disdain and asked to be shown the shaft.

Elias felt something like an ache in the center of his chest; he knew investors could mean jobs and stave off hunger for months. Josiah, who had stayed by the seam, watched Mrs. Gleaner’s boots with an almost reverent hunger. Miguel spat in the dust. “She smells of city,” he muttered—an affront and a wish rolled into one.

Mrs. Gleaner’s presence introduced a different current: talk of hotels, rail stops, fancy cards and train timetables. Men’s imaginations turned outward from immediate fear to the pragmatic playground of future prosperity. Even as the mule’s tracks frayed into silence, a different calculus took hold: the door as opportunity.

Elias escorted Mrs. Gleaner and the messenger down the drift with Curtis. She looked at the seam and frowned. “The tourists would love something like this,” she said, with that measured tone of someone who sees the world as product.

At the chamber, the seam’s glow seemed to respond under lamp light—an odd, almost coquettish shimmer. Josiah stood too near, and Mrs. Gleaner’s soft laugh touched the chamber like a hand. “The world will come,” she said. “Think of Calico as a place of pilgrimage of the curious.” Her eyes, clear and sharp, fixed on Elias with commerce’s patience. Elias felt the weight of his town in her words.

He replied, the foreman in him balancing the merchant’s dream: “We keep safety first. We’ll not parade the unknown.” He did not say he could not stop the thought once sown. Among men who dream in coin, a hint is a seed.

That night the knocks came again—three slow, then a single distant rattle that might have been the mule’s chain somewhere beyond their hearing, then silence. The men slept in whispers, and the headframe creaked its old complaint.

We are best friends first then lovers and we are always together focusing on ourselves, our relationship and academics. I genuinely love and care about her and can’t see her sad at all. So the problem arises that she doesn’t have any other friends and it is impacting her mental health. She says that all female are dramatic and very difficult to bond with, she have acquaintances with whom she can work with, maybe grab a coffee but not anyone who have her back or can share real feelings about anything. She had a fight today with one of the girls she was trying to be friends with from her class, and she vented out to me i did help calm her down and lift her up saying she is the bad one you deserve better etc. while venting she was having self doubts that there is something wrong her and nobody wants to be with her. She said she needs friends even if they’re fake ones she doesn’t want to be lonely. I reassured her and calmed her down but ik if this problem persists it’s not good. When we are together i never let her feel lonely but i do understand where this comes from, sometimes i feel guilty that what if i take all her time and she doesn’t get the time to make a bond with anyone but that’s not the point. The point is that I really want to help her in this situation and i have no idea how to help her. Your input is appreciated.",1,1759384394.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False
1nvvoma,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArrowVDisscussions/comments/1nvvoma/taking_control_of_the_narrative_a_supergirl_fan/,“Taking control of the narrative”: A Supergirl fan fic,"   National City, Earth 38: December 2019, one 4 hours before the Anti-Monitor Crisis starts. Cat Grant is sat down for an interview with 60 Minutes. Lesley Stahl is conducting the interview, profiling the life of Cat Grant and her rise in fame as the most powerful woman in all of media.

“Cat Grant is synonymous with mass media as Anna Wintour was with Vogue magazine. From her earliest beginnings as a reporter for Perry White’s Daily Planet to the creation of one of the world’s biggest Media empires, Cat has blazed trails for Women in journalism. Tonight, Cat has a bombshell revelation in this exclusive interview with 60 Minutes.” Said Lesley Stahl in her introduction to a fateful, if turbulent interview.

One week prior, Lesley Stahl and CBS news crew flew to National City to interview Cat Grant at her home, one afternoon. Cat sits at her home, waiting for the 60 Minutes people to arrive. She’s currently on the phone in her room, with an old friend. “Yes Kiera, I’ll be in the office Next week, we’ll have a watch party there” said Cat. Cat hears a knock at the door. “Oh, that must be them, gotta go. We’ll talk again later” Said Cat. She rushes over to the Door “Carter, I’m doing an interview, just stay up here and play your games, for now until I call you” said Cat to her youngest son. “Okay, mom” replied Carter, who’s in his room. Cat goes down stairs to answer the door.

“Oh my god, you’re Lesley Stahl, with 60 Minutes” said Cat. “Well you took the words out of my mouth” said Lesley. “Please, come on in” said Cat, inviting her guests inside. As the lighting crew and camera people set up, Cat offered refreshments. “Would you and your crew like any Coffee?” Asked Cat. “That would be nice” said Lesley. Cat goes to the kitchen to make some Coffee, along with some finger sandwiches. 

She comes back with the coffee and snacks for her guests. The Cameras and lights are ready to go. All that’s needed is the word to start. “So Lesley, you’ve been on 60 M


“Cat, why did you choose to become a journalist?” Said Lesley. “I wanted to tell stories. I wanted to get at the truth. Let me ask you something, Lesley. What made you choose to become a journalist?” Cat replied. Lesley sat back in her chair, reflected for a second, and said “I got into journalism for the same reasons, to tell a story, to get at the truth. I was drawn to the challenge and excitement of being nosy, collecting serious information, and synthesizing it into a story.” Lesley explained. 

“You’re a single mother of two sons, that must be a challenge while trying to run a media empire. Does your children’s father ever come around?” Asked Cat. “No, he doesn’t, in fact my sons have two different fathers. None of them have been around. Yes, it’s a bit of a challenge, but I don’t regret it” said Cat

The conversation turned to the subject of a former assistant turned Pulitzer Prize winning reporter Kara Danvers. “You had a hand in Kara Danvers becoming a reporter, isn’t that right?” Asked Lesley. “Yes, I did. When she first came to CatCo, Kara was my assistant. I saw huge potential in her. The potential to be great. Three years ago, I had a conversation with Kara about taking a leap and embracing her full potential. I took her blank job application, and one word on it “Journalist”. Because I believed she had it in her to be a great journalist. I saw her passion, integrity, and drive to uncover truth.” Explained Cat. 

“Shortly after you hired Kara in 2015 as your assistant, you met a certain young superhero.” Said Lesley. “You mean Supergirl, she’s nothing if not extraordinary. That’s another one who has the passion, integrity, and drive to uncover the truth. She stands for Hope, Help, and Compassion for all. She reminds me of Kara, quite a bit actually. I even came close to firing Kara when I thought she lied about who she was. Supergirl came into my office and stood next to Kara. The two complimented each other and shook hands.” Said Cat. 

   “Do you believe them to be two different people or one and the same?” Asked Lesley. “What the hell kind of question is that, Lesley?” Asked Cat now offended. “What I’m getting at is, isn’t it far fetched for a Kryptonian, an alien for that matter to share a resemblance with a Human? The chances of them being two separate people are about zero when you think about it. Isn’t Supergirl’s given name Kara Zor-El? Coincidentally, the young woman that looks like her is Kara Danvers. Take away Ms Danvers glasses, and who do you have? Clark Kent, of the Daily Planet looks an awful lot like another Kryptonian superhero, Superman, the cousin of Supergirl, just like Clark and Kara are cousins. I think you know what I’m getting at.” Said Lesley.

  “Yeah, I do know what you’re getting at. I entertained the notion that Kara is Supergirl and that she had someone impersonate her to get me off her back. Very well, Kara and Supergirl are one and the same! Is that the bombshell you’re looking for? Well there it is, congratulations Lesley Stahl. I gave you the story of the Century. Oh but wait, there is that little doozie about Clark Kent being Superman, and that both he and Kara wear glasses to hide their identities. Two for the price of one, is that what you wanted? Well there you go, what started out as a piece on me and my life, with mention of a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and mentee, turned into a which hunt. You said you went into journalism for the same reason I did, I didn’t go into it with the idea of engaging in witch hunts and I know you didn’t either. I used to watch 60 Minutes when I was a little girl, you were my favorite reporters, besides Mike Wallace and Morley Safer, although you didn’t join 60 Minutes until the early 90s. You’ve changed, and not necessarily for the better.” Said Cat.

“I think we have enough here for now, if we need more I’ll be in touch.” Said Lesley. She and Cat shook hands and parted ways. But not before Lesley saying one more thing. “I never meant it to be a witch hunt, I’m sorry. I’m happy to know that I inspired you to pursue journalism” said Lesley. With that, the interview was over. 

“Son of a Bitch, I hope that damned interview doesn’t air, or at least the part where Lesley goaded me into revealing who Kara and Clark are. Like Lesley said, if she needs more, she’ll let me know. I could ask her then to delete the part where we talk about their secret identities and just talk about Supergirl and Kara in the more positive context I laid out. Damn it, I just ruined two lives because of her. Who knows maybe some cataclysmic event or global event happens and the interview won’t even air. That’s a real possibility, hell CBS preempts stuff all the time.” Said Cat.

Little did Cat know, such an event will happen, a “Crisis on Infinite Earths”. Earth-38’s inhabitants evacuate to Earth one, thanks to the Combined efforts of Supergirl, the D.E.O., Lena Luthor, and the heroes of Earth-1. Unfortunately not only is Earth-38 erased, but so is Earth-2 and many others. Just before the end, Cat hugs her family tightly, tells them she loves them, and thinks to herself “Well, here it is, the cataclysmic event that preempts my interview, and a whole lot of other things. God help us” said Cat as the Antimatter Wave hits Earth-1.

Thanks to the Justice League, and Oliver Queen, the multiverse is remade. Earth-1, Earth-38, Black Lighting’s earth, and a few others are combined into whats not called “Earth-Prime”. Very few people have memories of their lives on their previous earths, or for that matter. Everyone’s lives have been altered to varying degrees. 

Fast forward to 2021, Alex Danvers is Marrying Kelly Olsen. Kara Danvers is one of the Bridesmaids. She gets a call from an old friend, it’s her boss Cat Grant. She offers Kara a job at CatCo Worldwide Media, this time as Editor in Chief, Kara’s dream job. There’s a problem, that’s a big job and it would mean trying to Juggle that with being Supergirl. Cat tells Kara that she knows the latter is Supergirl. That she should look at what Kara has accomplished as herself, and as Supergirl and live one life to the fullest. This Cat has no memory of having done the interview for 60 Minutes, as it was never filmed. Though she does remember that Kara is Supergirl. 

Kara listens to Cat’s advice and decides to abandon the secret. She accepts Cat’s job offer and comes in to CatCo to talk it over. Cat sits in her office, waiting for Kara to arrive. “Did I make a mistake in talking Kara into coming out as Supergirl? It’s her story to tell, not mine. I’m happy that she accepted my job offer for Editor in Chief, but not at the cost of her privacy. There’s a reason why she kept her identity a secret, to protect her family and friends” Said Cat. 

Kara arrives at CatCo that night for her meeting with Cat Grant. She’s dressed in more formal attire, a red Plaid Skirt, with match jacket and white undershirt, her hair’s down and noticeably, she’s not wearing glasses. Cat takes a look at Kara, greets her, and speaks. “Listen, I don’t want to jeopardize the lives of you, your family, and your friends. Your secret identity is your own business, that’s your story to tell. It’s about taking control of the narrative. You tell your story, on your terms. It’s up to you if you choose to tell, and when. You have the Editor in Chief job regardless, I mean it” said Cat. 

“Thank you, Ms Grant, that means a lot. I do accept your job offer, it’s a really amazing opportunity for me. But I’ve decided to take control of my narrative, tell my story, my way, on my terms, and give you an exclusive. I’m living one life to the fullest, so do you have time?” Said Kara.

Cat Grant was speechless after what she just heard, and was brought to tears. She couldn’t be more proud. “You’re damned right I have the time, we’ve got an interview to do, so move your ass, Chop Chop! I’ve got to introduce the world to my new, very Super, Editor in Chief” said Cat with her arm around Kara as they walk outside the office to discuss the interview, as well as the details of her new job.

“Hello National City, you know her as Kara Danvers, CatCo’s ace reporter and Editor in Chief. But tonight, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you, Supergirl!”",1,1759384321.0,ArrowVDisscussions,0,1.0,False

My use case is pretty standard, power for lights (LED), a small 12V fridge, water pump, and charging tools/phones. The big one: A well pump that kicks on with a solid surge.

TL;DR:  Building an off-grid 48V cabin system. Stuck between a premium Victron, a value-packed EG4, a cheap Giandel, or a simple All-in-One like Anern. Need reliability for a well pump. What's the best choice?

---------------------------------------------------------------

Are you dreaming of a space that combines rustic charm with modern elegance? An open floor plan barndominium might be the perfect solution for you. These unique homes merge the benefits of a traditional barn with contemporary living, creating an inviting space that feels both spacious and cozy. Let’s explore some creative layouts and ideas that can help transform your barndominium into a stylish haven.

### Benefits of an Open Floor Plan Barndominium

The open floor plan is incredibly popular for various reasons:

- **Spaciousness:** Without walls interrupting the flow, open spaces feel larger and more inviting.
- **Natural Light:** More windows and fewer dividing walls allow sunlight to pour in, brightening your home.
- **Flexibility:** Open layouts enable you to easily rearrange furniture or redesign your space as your needs change.
- **Modern Living:** The contemporary lifestyle often emphasizes social interactions. An open floor plan encourages connection among family and friends.

### Exploring Layout Ideas

Here are some creative layouts you can consider for your open floor plan barndominium:

#### The Lofted Design

If you enjoy high ceilings, a lofted design is a fantastic choice. This layout typically features:

- A spacious living area that flows seamlessly into the kitchen and dining space.
- A loft area perfect for a home office, guest bedroom, or reading nook.
- Large windows that overlook both the downstairs area and the beautiful surroundings.

#### The Zoned Approach

While maintaining an open feel, you can create zones within your barndominium. This layout might include:

- Defined areas for cooking, entertaining, and relaxing.
- Partial dividers, like furniture or plants, that create borders without sacrificing light.
- A central island that serves as both a kitchen workspace and a dining area.

#### The Modern Minimalist

If you prefer clean lines and a minimalist aesthetic, consider a design that emphasizes simplicity. Key elements could be:

- Neutral colors and natural materials that enhance the open space.
- Built-in storage solutions to reduce clutter.
- Strategically placed furniture that maintains an open atmosphere.

### Functional Spaces within the Layout

Even in an open floor plan, it’s crucial to have functional spaces that serve specific purposes. Here are some ideas:

#### Kitchen and Dining

The kitchen can serve as the heart of the barndominium. Consider a layout with:

- A large central island with seating for casual dining.
- Open shelving and large cabinets for storage and ease of access.
- A walk-in pantry to keep the kitchen organized.

#### Living Area

The living area can be a cozy gathering spot with these features:

- A sectional sofa that encourages conversation.
- A fireplace or wood stove as a focal point, providing warmth and ambiance.
- A combination of ambient and task lighting to create a welcoming atmosphere.

#### Outdoor Connection

Create seamless indoor-outdoor living by incorporating:

- Large sliding doors that open to a deck or porch.
- Outdoor seating and cooking areas to expand your entertaining options.
- Landscaping that encourages views from inside and outside.

### Customization and Personal Touch

One of the most rewarding parts of designing an open floor plan barndominium is the opportunity to add personal touches. Consider these elements for customization:

- Unique art pieces that reflect your personality.
- Decorative lighting fixtures that make a statement.
- Color palettes that resonate with your style.

Your barndominium should feel like home, a space where you can relax and enjoy life. By embracing an open floor plan and incorporating creative layouts, you can turn your vision into reality. Don’t forget to consider functionality and personalization as key components of your design. Happy building!

Innovative Design Ideas to Maximize Space in Barndominiums
----------------------------------------------------------

Living in a barndominium is becoming increasingly popular due to its rustic charm and the flexibility it offers. One of the standout features of barndominiums is their open floor plan, which maximizes the available space. Here are some innovative design ideas to get the most out of your barndominium.

When planning your layout, consider creating multi-functional areas. This approach not only saves space but also enhances the usability of each section in your barndominium. For example, you might integrate a home office into your living space. You can use a stylish room divider or a bookshelf to define the workspace without closing it off completely. Furniture that can be easily moved or transformed, like a fold-down desk, allows you to adapt to different activities, from work to relaxation.

Using vertical space is crucial in a barndominium. High ceilings provide the opportunity for stunning loft spaces or extra storage. Consider placing shelving units or cabinets that reach toward the ceiling. You can create a cozy reading nook or a small sleeping area on a lofted platform. This keeps the floor space open while still making your barndominium feel spacious.

Natural light can also create an inviting atmosphere and make your barndominium feel larger than it is. Large windows, or even glass doors that open up to outdoor living areas, can bring in much-needed sunlight. Using lighter colors for walls and furnishings will maximize the effect of natural light. Mirrors can also be strategically placed to reflect light and give the illusion of more space.

- **Choose open shelving:** Traditional cabinets can make a space feel cramped. Instead, try open shelves in the kitchen or living areas. This allows for easy access to your favorite items while keeping the overall feel airy.
- **Utilize hidden storage:** Look for opportunities to hide storage in plain sight. Benches with hidden compartments, ottomans that open up, or built-in seats with storage can keep your space tidy.
- **Install foldable furniture:** Getting furniture that can be folded away when not in use is a smart way to maximize floor space. Consider wall-mounted tables or Murphy beds that offer versatility.

The layout of your barndominium should facilitate an easy flow from one area to another. An open floor plan can help eliminate barriers, creating a seamless transition between spaces such as the living room, dining area, and kitchen. This style encourages interaction and gives your home a warm, inviting feel.

Outdoor living spaces are also vital in maximizing the functionality of your barndominium. Creating a deck or patio that is easily accessible from the main living area can effectively blur the lines between indoor and outdoor spaces. Use these areas for entertaining or relaxing, and consider using outdoor furniture that is foldable or stackable to save space when not in use.

Additionally, using multifunctional furniture that serves multiple purposes can drastically increase the utility of your barndominium. A sofa bed can double as seating during the day and a comfortable sleeping area at night. Coffee tables with storage compartments can contain games or blankets while still serving as a surface to set down drinks.

Choosing the right flooring can also impact the feel of your space. Opt for consistent flooring throughout your barndominium to create a cohesive look. This can make the space feel larger than it is. Additionally, consider durable options that can withstand various activities, including spills and foot traffic.

Don’t forget to inject your personal style into the design. Use bold accents or decor that reflects your personality. This might include bright throw pillows, unique wall art, or statement lighting fixtures. Personal touches make your barndominium feel like home, ensuring that the space serves both function and comfort.

These innovative design ideas into your barndominium planning can help you maximize space while creating a home that feels cozy and inviting. Whether you prioritize multifunctional areas, use of vertical space, or clever furniture choices, you can create a layout that perfectly meets your needs.

### Conclusion

When designing your open floor plan barndominium, embracing creativity and innovation can completely transform your living space. The layouts that feature seamless transitions between areas promote a feeling of spaciousness and warmth, making interactions with family and friends more enjoyable. Utilizing multifunctional spaces is key; by incorporating furniture that serves dual purposes or creating zones within the open area, you can maximize usability while keeping the design minimalist and stylish.

Innovative ideas, such as using built-in shelving or cleverly placed partitions, can help define spaces without sacrificing openness. natural light through large windows or skylights can enhance the overall atmosphere of your barndominium, making it feel bright and inviting.

Don't hesitate to express your personal style, whether through modern finishes, rustic accents, or unique color palettes. Each element reflects your personality and contributes to the overall harmony of the space. As you plan your barndominium, remember that the goal is to create a home that fosters connection and comfort.

With thoughtful layouts and fresh design concepts, your open floor plan barndominium can be not just a living space but a sanctuary that blends functionality and aesthetics. Ultimately, the beauty of your barndominium lies in how you adapt these ideas to fit your lifestyle and preferences, ensuring your home is a true reflection of you.",1,1759383781.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

And as I was jolted from my sleep, I didn't, I was confused. I didn't know if that was real or fake. So I slowly began to get out of bed and start walking towards door. And as I did, um, I said, you know what? Before I lock it, let me go ahead and inspect like everything in the living room, making sure everything is because it's like everything is like a big layout. So let me inspect before I lock my door. So as I walked out on my left, it was my breakfast room and it connected to my kitchen and then it connected to, it all opened up to the living room. And then across was the foyer from me. So as I was scanning everything, everything checked out. I was like, okay, okay. But as I got to the foyer, there was a family friend that had been staying with us standing right there and he looked completely evil. I mean, he, he was breathing so heavily. Like, I mean, like, like he wanted, like, he was like the maddest he could ever be. And he all I could sense was he wants me dead. He wants me dead. And as he was heaving and just looking at me, I kind of like my eye sight, like my sight looking at him kind of like zoomed out where I was able to see, okay, we have a love seat, a coffee table, and an accent chair between us. So as I realized that that furniture was between us, he zipped really fast to his right side. And as he did that, I stumbled back and I had closed my door. And as I locked my door, he, his body slammed right into it and he continued body slamming my door. So as I began to shield it with my body, even though it was locked, I just, you know, I was scared. And I was just, I didn't know what to do. So as I got, as I just, while he continued body slamming it, I just closed my eyes and I just started reciting the Our Father. 
As I recited The Our Father, I would end up to make him Stop. Please make him stop. I want it to be silent. Because it was just so loud, the way he was just continuously body slamming the door, body slamming the door. So, and it's like, before I even knew it, all of a sudden it became very, very quiet. As it got quiet, I was like, oh my God, I'm so thankful. I was so happy, you know? And then in a very, very eerie voice, I heard him say. Do you want to play? And that voice, I mean, as soon as I heard that voice, all I did was immediately I cried. It was so eerie, so like, I don't know, I can't, I can't explain. It was just so eerie, demonic. So like, it was just like all, like I I like all I could think was, it wants death. It just wants death. and I was just, oh my God. So, and as that happened, um, he all of a sudden stood up again and began body slamming it. And again, I just continued reciting the our father, the our father, the father, and eventually I fell asleep. As I woke up, I was still in front of my door, so obviously that wasn't a dream.
 I was like, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God. I immediately ran to my daughter's room and I told her everything that happened. And she was like, she was like, I mean, I even told her everything to the exact moment to exactly what he was wearing. And the mismatched socks that he had on. He had a purple one on the right and a black one on the left. And sure enough, like I want to say within maybe 20, 30 minutes, he knocks on the door. And as he opens the door, he's wearing that exact outfit, those exact socks. And he went, he went to bed hours before we had gone to bed. So we had no idea what he was wearing. So for that and that, and then he told me as before he walked out the door was that he had a dream about me and all he did, all he could remember is that he hated me. He just hated me. And then he walked off and said it where am I just hated you. I don't know why. I just hated you.",2,1759383661.0,Paranormal,4,0.75,False

My main concern is about my height. Is there any possibility of increasing it to around 5'6""? Along with that, I am also focused on fat loss. When I started the gym, my weight was 67 kg, and currently, I am at 59 kg. However, I am struggling to reduce side fat and chest fat despite trying hard.

Here’s my current diet routine:

* Morning: 2 rotis with sabzi and dal
* Pre-workout: Oats, peanut butter, and black coffee
* Post-workout: Paneer sandwich and creatine

I want to know whether I should make any changes to my diet for better results. Apart from fitness and diet, I also want to work on improving my overall personality. If anyone has suggestions regarding lifestyle, grooming, or confidence-building, I would really appreciate it.

1nvveba,https://i.redd.it/w94xaxpmvmsf1.png,Don't build productivity apps. Don't build too many features.,"That's the advice we got over a year ago when we started to build Strukt. We understand if you don't want to read all this, the link is at the bottom to try it out, but we would also love if you wanted to read our story :)

We got hit with so much backlash, ""there already is tons of productivity apps out there"" and we shouldn't focus on having many features just focus on 1-2 features. Well.... We did the exact opposite, because we're productivity nerds, we love self improvement. So we wanted to build the ""final boss"" of productivity apps. 

We took a minimalistic approach to not make the app cluttered and to make if focused on the functions, we didn't want 500 animations, 23 pop ups and 72 colors in your face when you're just trying to write in your journal or update your goals etc. 

We focused on adding as many features as we could think of which delayed the release for some time, but we wanted to add the core features. We're constantly updating the app and adding new features. To not make it cluttered you create your own dashboard on the home page and only add the functions you're interested in. So if you're just interested in goals and journaling the other features won't bother you or be in your face.

And we also focused on making it as customizable as possible. Everyone is different, and we truly wanted to make it a place where the app is a reflection of you, you can make the app theme pink and add flower photos, but you can also make it black themed and keeping it minimalistic. You can even customize the notification messages.

We're super focused on user feedback and keep building the app according to what our users want. We have a user feedback section in the profile page where users can send in feedback and we keep updating the app based on that!

I do 5 pours of 60g each, when it completely drains from the previous one. I got to 3:50 minutes and it still didn't finish to drain.

	•	I’m handling [what you bring: design, marketing, biz dev, funding, etc.] and looking for someone to own the technical side.
	•	This is early stage — I want someone who’s excited to brainstorm, shape the product, and grow it with me.

I feel that a lot of what I’ve cast has been effective (though I’ve since learned to be VERY specific), but I’ve never had this happen to me before!

A few months ago, I made a money jar with some spices, currency from multiple countries, checks, green aventurine, hematite, coffee, and a paper with my request, then topped it off with a cloth and green string and put green wax on top from the candle I used in the shape of a pentacle. I would sometimes shake it every so often to try to keep the energy flowing. 

I heard that people add to their jars/bowls, so today I decided to add to the jar. I lit my main candle and a small, green tea candle intended to be the spell candle. I asked my spirit guides to let me add to the jar to intensify its power. I used an incense stick to cleanse some new herbs (especially cinnamon) with incense, wrote my name with the amount if money I wanted to receive on a bay leaf, and burnt it in a separate silver bowl on top of the new spices. I also let the smoke from the incense go around the jar (not touching it). 

I then opened the jar and added the spices after the embers from the bay leaf died. I used my selenite stick inside to cleanse the jar of stagnant energy then added back the cloth and the green string, and shook it to stir in the new additions. Last, I clasped my hands around the jar to infuse it with my energy, and it shattered! There’s a round hole where it shattered and I have no idea what that means. 

I feel I was being careful about fire safety as I kept burning things separate from the jar, and it was only when I clasped my hands around it after shaking that it shattered in the round hole. Also, the jar is (or was) a Ball mason jar, so I figured it would be fairly sturdy… I also feel I had some protection measures such as smoke cleansing my room, shaking salt, using the incense smoke to cleanse everything, and having my protection crystals close by.

Chapter 1 Stuck As A Fake Highborn
The screen flickered: [Chronicles of Galland download complete. Please confirm login.]

[Auto-confirmed. Login successful.]

[Have an epic adventure!]

A dazzling white light swallowed the room whole.

*****

When Lorrayne opened her eyes, everything was wrong.

Her messy computer desk? Vanished. Instead, a long wooden table sat in front of her, piled with trays of spices that smelled like a punch to the face.

The sharp, earthy aroma, mixed with a damp breeze, yanked her back to her college days in Eldoria.

She'd spent her nights slaving away at a swanky restaurant, grinding spices into powder to scrape by.

""Lorrayne!"" The yell snapped her out of it.

She whipped her head up, scanning her surroundings.

The room screamed late-medieval Eldoria—pure Gothic vibes.

Tall, arched windows let in faint light, thick stone walls loomed heavy, and the floor was cold and clammy. A gaudy crystal chandelier dangled from the ceiling.

A bunch of twelve- and thirteen-year-olds slouched at their desks, sneaking looks her way. Up front, a blond guy—probably in his thirties or forties, definitely the teacher—glared at her like she'd stolen his lunch.

""Lorrayne!"" he barked again, his voice sharp enough to slice bread. ""Stand up and answer my question.""

His eyes drilled into her, practically screaming suspicion.

Lorrayne's stomach did a flip. Panic clawed at her chest, and a rush of emotions—not hers—flooded her brain.

Then came the memories, flickering like a glitchy old movie.

It hit her. The girl whose body she was stuck in had been posing as a highborn to sneak into this fancy academy. Big mistake—she'd pissed off a real highborn girl in a dorm room fight.

This moment was that girl's payback, a setup to make Lorrayne crash and burn on the first day of class.

The blond guy was Professor Phil, teaching this Potioncraft Class.

He'd been roped into the trap, calling her out to answer a question about highborn spices.

Here's the deal: the original Lorrayne didn't know a thing about fancy spices. Just the thought of being put on the spot had her shaking like a leaf.

And for good reason—lowborns caught faking as highborns got dragged off for torture and a public hanging.

Lorrayne's mind flashed to medieval torture racks and gallows. 'Yeah, no way I'm going out like that.'

She stood, locking eyes with Phil. ""Sorry, Professor Phil, I totally zoned out. Can you run that question by me again?""

A snicker came from her right. One of the highborn girl's lackeys smirked. ""Zoned out? More like she's got no idea.""

The room buzzed with whispers.

""Can't even name basic spices. Is she really a highborn?""

""Zip it!"" Phil smacked his desk, shutting them up. He turned to Lorrayne. ""Name the spices on your table and tell me what they're for. Now.""

""No prob,"" Lorrayne said, glancing down at the tray.

Dill, sweet basil, parsley, sage, rosemary… all stuff she'd worked with at the restaurant.

In her old world, these were cheap as chips, grown everywhere. But centuries ago? Probably worth more than gold.

Here was hoping they kept the same names.

She took a deep breath, fingers grazing the spices as she listed them off.

""Dill—sweet and zingy, great for cooking, helps with stomach aches and sleepless nights,"" she said. ""Sweet basil—perfect for tossing on dishes, you can eat it raw.

""Parsley—seasoning, good fresh. Sage—smells strong, used in food or to make stuff smell nice…""

She went on, finishing with, ""And vanilla pods, super rich and fragrant, used in cooking or perfumes.""

She paused, nudging the herbs aside to spot a yellowish, creamy lump.

Her nerves settled a bit. 'If that highborn girl was dead certain I'm a fake, she wouldn't have thrown in something this sneaky.'

""This is frankincense,"" Lorrayne said. ""Resin from olive and frankincense trees. Good for pain relief and keeping things clean.""

She stepped back, looking up. ""How'd I do, Professor Phil?""

The room went quiet as a graveyard.

Lorrayne's brow creased. 'Did I screw up the names?'

After what felt like forever, Phil finally spoke. ""You've… eaten these spices?""

""Professor Phil, they're just your run-of-the-mill seasonings, right?"" She flashed a cheeky grin. ""Well, except frankincense. That's more for incense or oils, not chowing down.""

Phil, a highborn himself, knew that. But even he wouldn't use these spices for everyday cooking—they were way too pricey.

And frankincense? That was sacred, used in offerings for its divine scent. 'Wait… frankincense isn't even supposed to be here,' he thought.

He blinked, then hustled to her desk. ""Mind if I check your tray?""

""Go right ahead,"" Lorrayne said, stepping out of his way.

Phil picked up the yellowish lump, sniffed it, and his face went through a rollercoaster—shock, confusion, then something else.

""Yup, that's frankincense,"" he muttered, setting it down. ""Must've mixed it in with the herbs by mistake. My bad, Lorrayne. How about ten points for the class?""

""Sweet, sir.""

Phil shuffled back to his podium, scribbling something in his notes.

As Lorrayne sat down, the highborn girl—Athina—twisted in her seat, her sharp blue eyes sizing Lorrayne up like she was some weird puzzle piece.

Lorrayne met her gaze and noticed something odd.

Athina's golden hair was the exact same shade as Phil's.

The rest of the class was a total snoozefest, half the kids practically snoring.

Lorrayne looked like she was daydreaming, but she was really sifting through the original Lorrayne's memories.

The girl had been a fisherman's daughter from a tiny village, wiped out by pirates. She'd escaped, saved by a group of knights.

One of them, a kindhearted lady knight, slipped her a recommendation letter and some gold to enroll at this academy.

But her looks made her a target on the road. To stay safe, she'd started pretending to be a highborn.

Terrible idea. That spur-of-the-moment choice ended up costing her life.

In the original timeline, she'd flopped Phil's question, setting off alarm bells. Her classmates ratted her out to the Church's inquisitors.

They dragged her to a dungeon, where she cracked under torture and spilled her real identity.

After that? Paraded through the streets, tied up, pelted with rotten veggies and manure by lowborns.

Her classmates showed up, too, pointing and laughing. In the end, she was strung up on the gallows and hanged.

Her final act? Offering her soul to The Dread God, begging for a chance to change the world—and her fate.

Maybe that god had listened, because here Lorrayne was, dropped into the day the impostor got busted.

She half-closed her eyes, digging through more memories about the school.

Syrria Academy of Arcana, funded by a bunch of nations, had a big talk about training the continent's best, no matter their class. ""Everyone's welcome, highborn or lowborn,"" they preached.

But in reality? Highborns treated lowborns like garbage, and nobody took that equality stuff seriously.

The original Lorrayne had slipped into the highborn crowd, but her lowborn ways made her stick out like a sore thumb. She was bound to get caught sooner or later.

Today's spice quiz was just the warm-up.

Athina, especially, wasn't about to let her off easy.

In the memories, Athina had already sent someone to snoop into Lorrayne's past. The girl just blew her cover too fast for Athina's backup plan to matter.

Chapter 2 Lowborns Ain't Cut Out For Math
Lorrayne was itching to derail Athina's schemes, but she didn't have the pull to make it happen.

The original Lorrayne was a lone wolf here—no friends, barely a coin to her name, stuck in a rut.

She had no idea who Athina had sent to dig up dirt on her or what they might find.

Waiting for the axe to fall was like teetering on a cliff's edge, nerve-racking but weirdly thrilling.

Still, if she put herself in Athina's polished boots, Lorrayne could guess where her little spy might be headed.

When the original enrolled, she'd filled out a registration form with the bare minimum: just ""Northern Seaboard"" for her hometown.

The school didn't give a hoot about your status—highborn or lowborn, everyone got the same treatment, and they didn't have to spill their life story.

So, she'd kept it vague on purpose.

Even if Athina's lackey went poking around the coast, good luck with that. The Northern Seaboard was a sprawling mess of towns and villages.

And besides, Lorrayne's fishing village? Gone. Pirates had wiped out everyone and burned it to the ground. She was the only one who'd made it out.

What was there to find? Just ashes and bad memories.

The only thing bugging her now was the group of knights who'd rescued her and paid her way into this school. They were the only ones who knew her real deal.

As class wound down, Professor Phil dished out an assignment: took a bunch of spices and whip up a ""scent formula"" for next time.

Lorrayne thought it was bonkers. 'Spices? For a scent? Are they trying to turn themselves into a pot roast?'

But nobody else batted an eye, so she zipped her lips, grabbed her spices, and headed out.

""Hey, Ruth, what's your plan for those spices?"" a student called out as kids grouped up, yapping about the homework.

Lorrayne perked up, eavesdropping like a pro.

""Me? I'm gonna grind some black pepper and sage, toss in a bit of tobacco, and make snuff for a snuffbox,"" one girl said.

'Pepper snuff?' Lorrayne made a face. 'Hard pass.'

""Ugh, snuff's too much work,"" another groaned. ""I'm just doing incense. What about you, Jack?""

Jack grinned like he'd hit the jackpot. ""First time I've seen this much spice! I'm chucking it all in a pot, cooking it into a thick goo, and slathering it on every day!""

""Oh, come on, Jack,"" a girl laughed. ""Phil's gonna flip. Pick something else, man.""

""Yeah, dude, unless you wanna end up as jerky,"" another teased.

Their chatter faded as they wandered off, but Lorrayne stopped in her tracks.

It hit her like a bolt: spices weren't just for cooking here.

Way back—three thousand years ago in ancient Egypt—they were used for religious rituals and mummifying bodies. They'd mix spices with oils to preserve corpses, making mummies that smelled good for centuries.

In Eldoria, cooking with spices came way later than in her old world, Celestial.

No wonder everyone had looked at her like she was nuts when she called the spices ""seasonings.""

Eating stuff used to embalm corpses? Yeah, that'd freak anyone out.

It was all about cultural differences.

This world might look like late-medieval Eldoria, but it wasn't quite the same. Back in the real Eldoria, folks were at least spicing up their beef by now.

The thought was a wake-up call. She'd have to watch her mouth and her moves, or she'd stick out like a goblin in a ballroom and get pegged as a heretic.

With that in mind, Lorrayne started to bail—until a snobby voice cut through the air like a dagger.

""Hey, lowborn! Hold it right there!""

It was Veyna, one of Athina's cronies. Trouble was coming, and fast.

Lorrayne sped up.

""Lorrayne!"" Veyna sounded furious, storming up to block her path. ""I said stop! You deaf or what?""

Lorrayne sighed, forced to a halt. She looked up at Veyna's smug mug. ""What's your deal, Veyna?""

Veyna smirked, nose in the air. ""Think you're slick, huh? Fooling everyone? Eating spices? That's a good one!""

Lorrayne's head was pounding. She wasn't about to explain she meant cooking with spices, not munching them raw. ""So, you chased me down to yap about that? Got no life, huh?""

""Yap?"" Veyna's voice hit a shrill note. ""You've got some nerve talking to me like that, lowborn! I'm gonna spill your secrets!""

""Spill what, exactly?"" Lorrayne asked, cool as ice, eyebrow raised.

""Oh, still playing dumb?"" Veyna took a dramatic step back, glaring like she'd caught a thief. ""You're a fake! I don't know how you know those spices, but you're not fooling me. You're no highborn!""

She pointed at Lorrayne's clothes. ""That ratty wool undershirt? Only a lowborn would wear that garbage!""

""You done?"" Lorrayne asked, voice steady as she locked eyes with her. ""My turn.""

Veyna's jaw dropped as Lorrayne stepped closer, her gaze sharp enough to cut through iron.

She began, ""From where I'm standing, you're the one who's crude and tacky. No grace, no class—nothing a highborn lady should have.

""You're petty, jealous, and your soul's as nasty as a swamp rat.

""Honestly, Veyna, you're a walking disgrace to highborns. Go home and learn how to act like a proper lady.""

Veyna's face turned tomato-red. ""You—you little—!""

""Pipe down!"" Lorrayne snapped, cutting her off. ""Ladies don't screech like banshees. Get it together—you're grossing me out.""

Veyna let out a wail, stomped her foot, and bolted, sobbing into her hands.

To a highborn girl in this world, Lorrayne's words were like a slap across the face.

But she didn't feel a speck of guilt. In the original Lorrayne's memories, Veyna had swung by once in the next week, throwing insults a thousand times worse.

She'd called her a filthy harlot, accused her of posing as a highborn to hook rich guys, and spread lies that her fancy dresses came from selling herself. She'd even rounded up a gang of dudes to rip Lorrayne's clothes off.

Sure, the original Lorrayne had faked being a highborn, but she hadn't hurt a soul or gained anything from it. She didn't deserve that kind of humiliation.

Even murderers got a chance to plead their case, but Lorrayne had been sentenced without a word.

Thinking of the original's grim fate, Lorrayne's eyes darkened with shadow.

""House of Wesley's known for holding grudges,"" a voice cut in. ""You just tore Veyna apart. Not scared they'll come for you?""

Athina, with her golden hair and sharp blue eyes, stepped out from behind a pillar.

The name ""Wesley"" sparked a memory.

Veyna—full name Veyna Wesley—was the youngest daughter of Count Wesley of Borlen Kingdom.

'If a count's daughter is just a lackey, who is this Athina really?' Lorrayne wondered.

Lorrayne buried her suspicions and turned to face her. ""You're using Veyna like a pawn. Not worried she'll tattle to her daddy?""

Athina smirked, unfazed. ""Me? Scared? Pfft. She's not exactly a mastermind.""

Lorrayne nodded. ""Then why should I be?""

""Fair play,"" Athina said with a light chuckle, then switched topics. ""Oh, by the way, we've got Runecraft Class tomorrow. Bet those lowborns are gonna make total fools of themselves.""

She leaned in, her tone dripping with mischief. ""Heard lowborns can't even handle basic Arithmetic. No times tables, no division. How're they gonna deal with geometry?""

Lorrayne's brow furrowed. Runecraft Class made sense—this was a magic academy, after all. 'But geometry? Isn't that for math lessons?'

Her confusion must've shown, because Athina's smile turned smug, like she'd just caught Lorrayne with her hand in the cookie jar.

""Lucky for them,"" Athina went on, ""the library's got books on arithmetic. Even the slowest lowborns can catch up if they crack open a book. Right, Lorrayne?""

""Maybe,"" Lorrayne said, keeping her tone neutral. But her mind was racing.

The original's memories were a jumbled mess, too chaotic to sort out fast. She needed to hit the library and cram some history and customs about this world.

Athina's jab had accidentally given her a tip—though it was probably another one of her little tests.

""Gotta jet,"" Lorrayne said, shutting down the chat. She hugged her spices and took off.

""Rude little nobody,"" Athina muttered, her blue eyes narrowing as she watched Lorrayne's back.

Then she turned, spotting a group of highborn boys reciting poetry on the lawn. She sauntered over, her smile sharp as a knife.

""Our dear princess got someone in her sights?"" one of the boys teased, picking up on her vibe.

Athina frowned. ""Don't call me princess. I'm keeping things low-key.""

""Sure thing, Athina,"" they said smoothly. ""So, who's got you all fired up?""

""That lowborn faking being a highborn,"" Athina said, her voice thick with disdain. ""The way she looked at me? Total disrespect. Go teach her a lesson.""

The boys swapped glances. ""You sure she's a lowborn? What if she's actually a highborn?""

""No way,"" Athina said, dead certain. ""I mentioned arithmetic books in the library, and she practically ran there.

""Only a lowborn would need to brush up on basic math.""

Chapter 3 The Shoddy State Of Weaving
The library's history books were nowhere near as juicy as the holy scriptures, and most were just glorified hero tales.

Lorrayne grabbed a thick volume titled The Ballad of Aldrich off the shelf and cracked it open. Two pages in, and it was clear the thing was steeped in myth and magic.

It kicked off with the ancient gods forging the world, spinning the saga of Aldrich, the Wisdom God's kid, adventuring across the Westvale continent.

The opening laid out how the Heartforger created everything: He ripped out His heart to shape Galland, then spilled His blood to make humans.

Worried they'd freeze, He plucked His left eye to form the sun, warming the world with its rays. Scared they'd stumble in the dark, He gave up His right eye for the moon, lighting their way with its pale glow.

When the Heartforger bit the dust, His soul birthed a bunch of new gods, popping up on the Mother Goddess's heart to keep watch over Galland's people.

The book also dished on a huge war two thousand years ago—a divine throwdown over faith.

That fight burned the old human paradise to cinders, turning it into the Wastvale desert overnight.

After that, the gods quit hanging with mortals, chilling up in the clouds instead. Humans up and moved to a new patch of land to start fresh—the Westvale they lived in now.

Word was, there was a third continent, Mistvale, up north, but its seas were blanketed in thick fog. Nobody had ever made it through, so Mistvale was just a big ""maybe.""

Lorrayne couldn't help thinking, 'If Mistvale's real, that's my bolt-hole if stuff hits the fan.'

As the sky turned dusky, Lorrayne skimmed a few more pages before heading to check out the book.

She'd barely stepped away from the desk when a pack of four or five boys swaggered over. One of them slammed right into her.

Thump. Her book hit the deck.

Before she could grab it, one of the boys swooped in, snatching it up and eyeing the cover with a smug drawl. ""Well, well, what's a Lowborn like you got here? …The Ballad of Aldrich?""

He shot a look at Lorrayne and clammed up.

That dusty old epic was a total snooze-fest to even glance at. 'And this girl is checking it out?' he thought. Lowborns don't mess with books like that—half of 'em could barely read.'

The other boys swapped quick glances, picking up the same thought, and kept quiet.

The kid with the book was quick on the uptake. He handed it back to Lorrayne, his vibe flipping like a pancake. ""My bad, miss. Total screw-up. Here's your book.""

Lorrayne raised an eyebrow but reached for it.

""Hang on a sec,"" he said, pulling it back with a sly grin. ""Hey, pretty lady, I've been slogging through this one too, but some bits are rough. Can I bug you about it?""

'Oh, great,' she thought. 'Another dude testing me. Does he think I couldn't handle an old book? This is a cakewalk.'

""Shoot,"" she said, shrugging.

He flipped to the first page and pointed at a random line. ""This part's got me stumped.""

Lorrayne gave him a ""really?"" look. 'The first page? Come on,' she thought.

The boy's face stiffened. He knew it sounded dumb, but the first page was all he'd ever skimmed, so it was his only play.

""Alright, hand it over. I'll school you,"" she said.

He passed her the book.

Lorrayne pointed at the text, her voice smooth as butter. ""The Mother Goddess bit it, her soul mixing with the cosmos, popping out new gods in a flash, their blessings spreading all over.

""Each god staked out their own turf as chaos split, life and death went their separate ways, and beasts started prowling…""

She laid it out plain, and by the time she was done, the boy's doubts were history.

He thanked her, sneaking another peek at her face as he left—and yeah, his heart did a little flip.

Snowy skin, lips like cherries, glossy brown hair like midnight, and those deep, mysterious eyes.

Her outfit was low-key, but her grace and brains screamed highborn. No way was she a Lowborn. Athina was probably just jealous of how drop-dead gorgeous she was.

The boys tracked down Athina, only to get an earful.

""You boneheads! Some Lowborns are smart and hit the books. You think everyone's as clueless as you dopes?"" she snapped.

""But she wasn't even sniffing around Arithmetic books,"" one shot back. ""Athina, you got it wrong.""

""Zip it! Get outta here!""

""What kind of dukes raise numbskulls like you?""

Athina's face twisted with rage. She'd sent them to rattle Lorrayne, not to join her fan club.

The boys, fed up with her spoiled-princess routine, rolled their eyes and bailed. Both sides split on bad terms.

Meanwhile, Lorrayne strolled through a rose garden and spotted her dorm—a cozy Romantian Style building parked on a lush lawn, its curved arches and domed roof giving off fairy-tale vibes.

Her room, claimed by the original owner, was at the end of the second-floor hall. Prime real estate. Crack the window, and she got a killer lake view, plus a cute little balcony perfect for kicking back with coffee.

Her beef with Athina? This room. The original owner got there first, but when Athina showed up and wanted it, the stuff was already moved in. The teachers backed the first claim.

Back in her room, Lorrayne lingered by the window, soaking in the view until the sun dipped low.

She lit an oil lamp and settled at her desk. A small bronze hand mirror sat face-down on the table. She picked it up.

The dim reflection showed a young face—her face, at fifteen.

Lorrayne froze. She'd half-expected some cosmic makeover after crossing worlds, but the original owner was her twin.

Same sleek brown hair, same blue eyes, staring back like a ghost from her old life.

She blinked, now wondering if she'd swapped souls or bodies.

Lucky for her, the original owner's brown hair was perfect—brown was the fanciest color in this world.

Red hair, even on a highborn, would've gotten her shade. No way she could've faked the highborn act then.

Setting the mirror down, Lorrayne smirked.

No wonder the teacher had picked her over blonde-haired Athina. Classic bias—brown hair screamed ""fancy.""

She slipped into a linen nightgown from the wardrobe, then frowned at the wool undershirt she'd tossed off.

The original owner had spent all her cash on flashy outerwear, skimping on the stuff underneath. Veyna had noticed and thrown shade.

Sure, the wool was soft, carefully treated, and clean, but it wasn't sparkling white.

Veyna had a point, though, Lorrayne had to admit. Highborns wouldn't be caught dead in it—they stuck to fine linen or cotton.

Weaving tech here was stuck in the Stone Age—wool came out rough, heavy, and dull.

Rubbing the wool between her fingers, Lorrayne's brain lit up with ideas.

'If the tech is behind, why not give it a nudge?' she thought.

But in her 21st-century world, animal fibers like wool were the fancy stuff, pricier than plant fibers.

Chapter 4 The Runecraft Class
Compared to cotton or linen, animal fibers like wool were in a league of their own—soft, warm, breathable, the whole package.

A cashmere coat? Cost a fortune. A cotton jacket? Chump change.

Sure, wool was a hassle to process and care for. It pilled if one looked at it funny, shrank if one washed it wrong, and picky types might wear it once or twice before ditching it.

For Lowborns, that was a nightmare. But for Highborns? That was the whole game.

Their status was all about flashing cash on fussy, high-maintenance gear.

Wool had its quirks, but it was pricey and cozy—exactly the kind of thing that screamed ""Highborn.""

She believed those filthy-rich top-tier Highborns would eat it up like candy.

Once every Highborn was strutting around in ""the softest, most extravagant cashmere sweater"" like it was a crown, would anyone dare call her a Lowborn? Not a chance.

They'd see her as the trailblazer, the real-deal Highborn who started the trend.

The night dragged on, the brass lamp giving off a weak glow.

Lorrayne grabbed an old piece of sackcloth and scorched a stick to use as a pencil, scribbling carefully. Washing wool, getting rid of grease, tweaking tools for carding, twisting threads for weaving…

By the time the cloth was covered in notes, the moon was chilling at its peak.

This was just a rough sketch—she'd need to copy it neatly onto parchment with a quill and ink later.

Once she sold this plan, she'd have the funds to keep up her Highborn charade.

Yawning and stretching, Lorrayne mentally fist-bumped her past self for binging those crafting videos online.

Her friends used to give her grief, saying she was wasting time on useless know-how.

'Useless? Ha! I'd hit the motherlode,' she thought.

Okay, some of those ""time-traveler must-haves""—like refining salt, making glass, crafting mirrors, or mixing gunpowder—were duds here.

This world's Alchemy was way ahead, with all that stuff already sorted out. The catch? The recipes were guarded by the top-tier Highborns, and their goods were for nobles only, no commoners allowed.

No problem. She could whip up those things for herself or sneak them onto the black market for some extra cash.

As long as she kept it hush-hush, no one would care if she dabbled in forbidden goodies.

Besides, Highborns always had the slickest stuff. It'd make her disguise even more convincing.

The brass lamp flickered, nearly out of oil after burning all night. Lorrayne blew out the tiny flame and slipped into bed like a cat.

*****

The next day, Runecraft Class.

They'd moved to a bigger classroom, each student parked at a desk with a square sandboard in front of them.

Not the kind for building mini castles—just plain sand, with a smooth stick sitting nearby.

Lorrayne watched her classmates grab their sticks and start scratching in the sand, her thoughts drifting to inventing paper.

'But would creating something that could shake up the gods' fanbase or threaten Highborn power get me in hot water?' she wondered. 'Yeah, better lay low for now.'

As she mulled it over, a scrawny old man with curly brown hair and skin like dried jerky shuffled in, clutching a parchment scroll.

It was the second day of school and their first Runecraft Class, so he kicked things off with an intro.

""Hey there, kids! Morning! I'm your Runecraft teacher, Claude Myke. Just call me Professor Myke, alright?"" he said with a friendly nod.

""Good morning, Professor Myke!"" the students sang out, hopping up to bow.

""Alright, take a load off,""Claude said with a nod, unrolling his scroll on the desk. ""Let's get to it. What are Magic Runes?

""They're like little buckets that soak up magical energy—traces left behind by the gods' Godspark before they zipped up to the heavens.""

""By studying and drawing these traces, we can grab hold of the magic floating around out there and actually use it.""

He went on, ""Magic Runes are super versatile. The most common use is Enchanting—like carving Wind Runes onto a knight's sword to make it swing faster.

""Then you've gott teleportation. Carve the right runes in different places, and boom, you're zipping across the world.

""And finally, summoning. With the right runes, you can call up Magibeasts, spirits, or—get this—even a god's shadow if you're some legendary Holy Archmage.""

""But hold up,"" he added, ""teleportation and summoning are for the big leagues. You newbies are starting with the basics: learning how to draw simple Magic Runes.""

Lorrayne was glued to every word. Claude made it sound so cool, and the guy clearly knew his stuff.

According to the memories of the body she'd crossed into, this continent was obsessed with magic. Everyone believed in it, even if no one had actually seen it in action.

'But, come on, I've already jumped worlds, so maybe magic and gods are the real deal,' she thought.

""Alright, kids, smooth out those sandboards. Time to get into the nuts and bolts of basic Magic Runes,"" Claude said, picking up a chalk stylus. ""Runes are like squished-up 3D shapes, so first, you've gotta nail drawing flat geometric stuff.""

He spun around and started sketching on the board. ""The shapes we use for Magic Runes come in four flavors: rectangles, triangles, circles, and polygons.""

The students grabbed their sticks and started doodling on their sandboards.

Lorrayne picked up hers too, thinking, 'Are you kidding me? I crossed worlds just to end up in math class? This Runecraft stuff is literally geometry for wizards.'

Claude kept going. ""Once you've got the shapes down, you need to figure out how to scale Magic Runes so they fit on different surfaces.""

He drew a six-pointed star on the board, labeling one segment as one foot, then added a square with a six-inch side. ""Okay, here's a brain teaser: if I wanna carve this star onto a square stone slab, what's the longest a segment of the star can be in inches?""

The students dove into their calculations, scribbling like crazy. After a bit, they looked up, staring at the board like it was written in some ancient code.

Calude waited a moment, then asked, ""Anyone got an answer for me?""

The room went quiet as a graveyard. Heads ducked, and kids shrank into their seats like they were trying to disappear.

Then, Veyna's hand shot up.

""Well, look at you, kiddo! Wanna give it a shot?"" Professor Myke asked, his eyes lighting up.

Veyna shot a sneaky glance at Lorrayne. ""Sorry, Professor, I'm stumped too, but I know someone who might have it figured out.""

The professor's smile dimmed just a bit. ""Oh yeah? Who's that?""

""My pal Lorrayne,"" Veyna said, flashing a smug grin. ""She's from a fancy highborn family, a total pro at arithmetic. I bet she's got this in the bag.""

Veyna turned to Lorrayne, her smile practically screaming gotcha. ""Go on, sweetie, tell the professor your answer.""

Veyna had been watching like a hawk. Lorrayne hadn't touched her sandboard or drawn a single grid since the lesson started.

The grid method was the go-to for crunching numbers—draw a bunch of lines to make a grid, then count the nodes to get the product.

'She dosen't even know that,' Veyna thought, 'Let's see you squirm, you nobody.'

Chapter 5 Just A Math Problem
Claude was a chill teacher. He'd clocked the bad vibes between the two but wasn't about to play referee.

Kids squabbling? To an old-timer like him, it was just goofy and kind of adorable.

He didn't hold out much hope for Lorrayne on this question. It was a tough one for these kids, and flubbing it was par for the course.

""Lorrayne, wanna give it a shot?"" he asked, half-expecting her to pass.

Lorrayne, who'd already crunched the numbers in her head, stood up with a shrug. ""It's the square root of three minus one, times the square root of six. Comes out to about 1.8 inches.""

""Hold up, say that again?"" Claude's eyes practically popped out of his head. ""What's your answer?""

Veyna had to bite her lip to keep from cackling.

'Square root of three? What kind of garbage answer is that? She's totally bombing this, and Professor Myke's gonna flip,' she thought, smirking at Lorrayne with mock pity.

Lorrayne didn't even glance Veyna's way. She repeated, cool as ice, ""Square root of three minus one, times the square root of six. Roughly 1.8 inches.""

Truth be told, she was winging it a bit. She had no idea how advanced math was in this world.

But in medieval Eldoria, square roots were a thing, even though folks called them different names depending on where they were from.

""Square root of a number"" was the go-to phrase, so she stuck with that instead of saying ""root three.""

Claude's face lit up like a kid on Solstice morning. ""You're telling me you can handle square roots and triangular numbers?""

Relieved she'd nailed it, Lorrayne gave a modest smile. ""I've dabbled a bit. Haven't forgotten it yet.""

""Dabbled? Kid, you're selling yourself short!"" Claude chuckled. ""I've taught a ton of students, and most of 'em just draw grids like it's paint-by-numbers.""

Lorrayne wasn't sure what to say, so she just kept smiling.

Claude looked at her like she'd hung the moon. ""Great job, kid. Take a seat.""

Then he turned to the class. ""Lorrayne's got it right. Anyone else crack it?""

Veyna's jaw hit the floor. 'How the hell does Lorrayne know this? She hasn't even picked up her stylus!'

Not ready to let it go, she piped up, ""Uh, Professor? Shouldn't you ask Lorrayne how she got the answer? I didn't see her touch her sandboard.""

That got everyone's attention. The whole class leaned over to sneak a peek at Lorrayne's sandboard.

""Whoa, it's totally blank! Did she do it in her head? That's nuts!""

""Lorrayne's gotta be some kind of brainiac!""

""No shock there—she's highborn, after all.""

Veyna's teeth ground together so hard they could've sparked. She wanted them to call Lorrayne out, not fawn over her.

Calude shot Veyna a disappointed glance before turning back to Lorrayne. ""Hey, mind breaking down how you worked it out for the class?""

Lorrayne nodded, calm as ever. ""To fit a six-pointed star inside a square and find the longest segment, you're really just looking for the biggest equilateral hexagon that fits.

""Line up one of the star's longest diagonals with the square's diagonal. That makes one of the star's sides hit the square's edge at a 15-degree angle.

""Use triangular number ratios to find the hexagon's side length—that's the distance from the star's center to its six points.

""Then, take half that distance, divide it by the square root of three, and multiply by two—or just divide by the square root of three—to get the scaled-down segment length.""

The classroom erupted in a frenzy of scratching as students scribbled furiously on their sandboards.

""Ohhh, that's how you do it!"" one said.

Half the class looked like they'd just seen the light, while the other half yanked at their hair in despair.

Sure, they got the method, but they didn't know how to figure out the distance from the star's center to its points.

Claude grinned like a fox. ""Lost, huh? Good. You're supposed to be.""

""This question wasn't meant for you to solve. I tossed it out there to lead into what we're covering next: triangular numbers and square roots.""

The students groaned in unison. ""Professor, that's just evil!""

Claude let out a belly laugh. ""Hey, I'm a riot! Alright, kids, park it. Time to get to the real lesson.""

The students sat up straight, grabbing their styluses and eyeing their boards like they meant business.

Veyna slouched back in her seat, her face stormy. 'Lorrayne's just a lowborn—how's she pulling this off? Could she actually be highborn?'

After class, Lorrayne stepped out of the classroom, a small shadow hot on her heels.

After a bit, she sighed and spun around. ""Veyna, what's your problem?""

Veyna's eyes glinted with a mix of suspicion and curiosity. ""Are you really highborn? Where're you from? What's your family's title?""

Lorrayne's face turned icy. ""Veyna, that's rude as hell.""

""Zip it!"" Veyna snapped, her expression twisting with resentment, clearly still stinging from Lorrayne's words the day before.

Lorrayne didn't bother with a comeback and headed for the cafeteria.

The midday sun was brutal, but the tree-lined path was alive with teens joking and laughing as they strolled toward the academy's dining hall.

Clink, clatter! A handful of copper coins spilled across the ground, some rolling into the grass along the sloped path.

""Oh no!"" A girl dropped to her knees, scrambling to gather them as people walked by. ""Sorry, can you step aside? My coins… Oh, someone's standing on one—could you move your foot? Thanks, I'm so sorry…""

One coin rolled to Lorrayne's feet. She stopped it with her shoe, glanced at the girl, and picked it up. ""Hey, this yours?""

""Oh, I'm so sorry, am I blocking you?"" The girl jumped up, stepping aside when she saw Lorrayne's fancy skirt hem. ""I didn't mean to get in your way!""

Lorrayne pressed her lips together and held out the coin. ""Relax, I'm just giving you your coin.""

The girl's head shot up, her eyes wide with surprise

Lorrayne froze when she recognized her.

In the original Lorrayne's memories of the next seven days, this girl—Winnie—was the only one who tried to sneak her water when she was strung up on the city wall for public shaming.

Meanwhile, the other lowborns, her so-called equals, had been baying for her blood.

Her eyes darkened for a second before she snapped out of it and nudged the coin closer. ""You taking this or what?""

Winnie hurriedly wiped her hands on her skirt and took the coin with both hands, bowing slightly. ""Thank you so much!""

""No sweat,"" Lorrayne said, kneeling to help pick up the scattered coins. ""Let me help.""

""No way, you'll ruin your skirt!"" Winnie, waving her hands like she was shooing a cat. ""I've got this.""

""It's just a skirt, chill."" Lorrayne grabbed a few coins from the grass, noticing the girl staring. She turned. ""What's the deal?""

Winnie blushed and shook her head. ""N-nothing! I just… I've never met someone so fancy and nice before.""

Lorrayne paused, then handed over the coins with a small grin. ""What's your name?""

She straightened up, nervous as a mouse. ""I'm Winnie. Winnie Charly.""

""I'm Lorrayne."" She stuck out her hand. ""Winnie, wanna be friends?""

""For real?"" Winnie grabbed her hand, pulling her up with starry eyes. ""I mean, if you're okay with it!""

Lorrayne blinked.

She'd meant a handshake, not a full-on assist, but apparently handshakes weren't big among lowborns.

""Alright, count your coins. You get 'em all?"" Lorrayne asked.

Winnie tallied them up, her face lighting up with relief. ""Thank you! I wouldn't have enough to rent a horse without you.""

""Rent a horse?"" Lorrayne's ears perked up.

Winnie nodded. ""I'm an Intermediate Apprentice Mage. Got an entrance exam for Equestrian Arts in two days. Can't afford my own horse, so I'm renting one.""

""The academy doesn't give you free horses for that class?"" Lorrayne's heart sank. She was broke as a joke and hadn't even thought about horses.

""They do, but they're ancient,"" Winnie said. ""Highborn kids bring their own horses, and those things fly. If I tank the exam, I could lose my tuition waiver.""

'Tuition waiver?' Lorrayne's interest spiked. She was scraping by, with no clue how she'd cover next semester's fees.

""Is it tough to get one?"" she asked, playing it cool.

Chapter 6 The Wool Merchant
""No kidding, it's tough!"" Winnie said, eyes wide as saucers. ""You gotta hit the top ten for a full ride. Top twenty? That's just half off.""

Winnie pumped her fist, all fired up. ""I'm gonna crush those exams! Top three get a sweet scholarship, too!""

Lorrayne's eyelashes fluttered. With over two hundred kids in their year, breaking into the top ten was like trying to catch a unicorn.

1nvv3ns,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaturatedFat/comments/1nvv3ns/belly_fat/,Belly Fat,"These are my points for why you may have it:

1. coffee, caffeine in general. If you happen to have caffeine and/or histamine intolerance, it's the first thing to get rid of for sure. Also, stress hormones. Also also, anxiety and other changes in mental activity like increase in impulsivity under caffeine influence could easily move your (for example) HCLFLP into swamp land just for an easy gratification and fun. Also also also, insomnia (hidden or overt). First thing to ditch, imho. 

From my life experience, only people on caffeine who are lean/skinny, are running on it meaning they don't eat much and use stress response/hormones as a fuel (not carbs or fat). So they are very stressed, harsh and fast in judgement, impossible to be around, but lean. Can't confirm that those have no belly fat at all but maybe overall weight plays a role (see point 3). 

2. overall inflammation due to stress (from life situation and/or inflammation) +all sorts of allergies and intolerances (sometimes hidden). Very broad, I know! Some sort of elimination diet/antiinflammatory diet or just looking after youself for symptoms and food diary is the way to go. Tip: look for bloating after eating. If it's 2l of soup or half a watermelon, nothing to worry about. But if it's like 300g of food, maybe look into those foods and/of food combination and/or preparation method. I put fiber in this category.

3. belly fat is just the last fat that goes, so loosing body fat% can (and probably will) get rid of it. As they say, you are just not as lean as you think you are. ",0,1759382277.0,SaturatedFat,1,0.5,False
1nvv2o5,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1nvv2o5/my_partner_is_basically_forcing_me_to_do_holidays/,My partner is basically forcing me to do holidays this year and I’m about to break down. Anyone else have holiday anxiety?,"TLDR: We (ages are about 30) have been together for 5 years. Holidays are extremely triggering for me but my partner was so excited about this week’s (Jewish) holiday that he completely is ignoring the fact that it’s causing me to break down. 

Looking for sympathetic advice, he is a good guy and this just never happened before so I’m struggling. 
———————

We are Jewish. 

It is holiday season — lots of holidays (small big and fasts) this month. 

I told my boyfriend of 5 years months ago that I couldn’t handle the holiday stress. I have agoraphobia and social anxiety. 

Usually he is very understanding. 

Two days ago, my rabbi called us and asked where I’ve been — since I’ve missed a few services. 

Instead of letting me remind the rabbi that I have agoraphobia and that’s why I haven’t been going to temple  — my boyfriend told the rabbi a cover story and made it seem like my anxiety was totally fine. 

Then he got tickets to the holiday services. Which we previously agreed upon that I wasn’t going to go. 

So since like noon yesterday, I’ve been breaking down. I couldn’t eat all day yesterday and then threw up my Indian dinner that I did eat. Today, I had Starbucks coffee around 3pm and went to the holiday service with him at 8pm (Wednesday). 

I tried my best to put on a happy face. 

But I was shaking with anxiety the whole time; and had to run to the bathroom halfway though the services to vomit. My anxiety was so bad I don’t even remember most of the service because I started disassociating. 

We went home, and now he wants me to go to services tomorrow. And I’m just stimming and hitting myself trying to calm down. 

Does he know how I feel? Yes. But he says I’m being “dramatic” 

We’ve been together 5 years together. I don’t know what has gotten into him. 

I don’t think he’s being controlling — just so excited about the holiday that he’s not caring about how he’s impacting me. 

Anyone else have holiday anxiety?

Written and edited by the [**MCAT Self Prep Tutoring Team**](https://mcatselfprep.com/elite-mcat-tutoring/)

  ***Home of the*** [***Free MCAT Prep Course***](https://mcatselfprep.com/)

The MCAT (Medical College Admissions Test) is without a doubt one of the greatest struggles that premeds face. It’s most-likely harder, longer, and more important than the SAT, ACT, finals, or any test that you’ve faced. For a lot of us, this intimidation prevents us from performing to the best of our abilities because we never took the time at the start to truly understand the MCAT. My name is Theo Bennett and I am one of the [Head Tutors](https://mcatselfprep.com/elite-mcat-tutoring/) for MCAT Self Prep. I achieved a perfect score on the MCAT (528) and since then I’ve made it my mission to pass on my test-taking strategies to other pre-meds. Here are a few things that I wish I knew before I started my journey to a perfect MCAT score.

# 1. How Do I Start studying? The Timeline

For most students, I recommend taking the MCAT during summer before or summer when you apply for medical school. Taking the test over the summer with minimal or no classes allows you to compress your study timeline. I wouldn’t recommend anything longer than 6 months because (let’s be real), you won’t remember what you studied 8 months before. I can barely remember what I did last weekend, let alone my study sessions from last semester. Whenever you take the MCAT, make sure you give yourself enough time to study to get the score you want. After taking a [free diagnostic test](https://mcatselfprep.com/free-and-low-cost-mcat-practice-exams/), decide on a goal score and calculate the number of hours that you need to study with the [Create-your-own Study Plan Course](https://mcatselfprep.com/study-plan/). A good rule of thumb is that studying 10 hours a week for a month will average about a 1.5 point increase. So if you study 20hrs/week for 3 months you should expect to jump up by 9 points. If you are studying during the semester plan it out in advance to deliberately make that semester as light as possible.

*I personally took the MCAT on May 23rd and started studying during the previous winter break. I studied during the spring semester but only took 12 credits that were fairly easy and then studied full-time for 4 weeks before my MCAT.*

The MCAT study timeline should be largely broken into two phases. The first phase’s goal is to get through all the content. The second phase’s goal is to improve your test-taking abilities. The content phase should last until you are one month away from the test date (if you’re studying for 6 months then this would be the first 5), and then the final month should be primarily devoted to taking full-lengths. Whatever you do, I would highly recommend devoting at least 2-3 weeks before the test to do nothing but MCAT study. The 8-hour test (or 6 hour test for Summer 2020) should feel like a 2-hour test by test day. It won’t feel like a breeze, but it shouldn’t leave you mentally drained. That’s your goal.

# 2. Prep Courses vs. Self-Studying Content

The first question that you may ask yourself is: Will I use a prep program to learn the content or will I self-study? You should instead ask yourself: Do I want to pay thousands of dollars to learn content when I could learn it for free by myself? The secret that the prep companies will never tell you is that the [AAMC](https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/taking-mcat-exam/prepare-mcat-exam/) (the MCAT administration) actually paid [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat) to create thousands of hours of videos that teach you the content directly. For free. It’s actually as close as you can get to the source itself. All the other prep companies, on the other hand, essentially try to parrot those same videos but charge you thousands of dollars for you to get it from a more-distant source. 

*I personally only watched the Khan Academy videos on the* [*MCAT Self Prep ecourse*](https://mcatselfprep.com/ecourse-home/) *playlists and supplemented them with Princeton Review content book reading for concepts that I struggled with.*

**Most Expensive:** Kaplan, PrincetonReview, NextStep etc. ($2000+)

**Middle Option:** Smaller prep companies with condensed videos ($400-999)

**Least Expensive:** MCAT Self Prep / Khan Academy (Free)

# 3. Tutoring vs. Learning Test-Taking Alone

The second and last question that you need to ask yourself is this: can I do this alone? To answer this, you need to dig deep. Are you self-motivated? Do you hold yourself accountable? Are you a naturally gifted test-taker? The question isn’t *am I driven?*, but *how do I learn best?* Most people will say… If you are self-motivated then you should self-study, but this, in my opinion, isn’t true. I, for one, am self-motivated but I needed structure too. 

*That’s why I personally chose* [*MCAT Self Prep*](https://mcatselfprep.com/ecourse-home/)*—a free program that gives you structure but lets you customize through self-study.* 

If you decide that you need accountability/test-taking advice, I would consider hiring a tutor. The last thing you want to do is take this test twice (the opportunity cost is huge), so it is totally worth spending the money to succeed the first time. If you decide to use tutoring, you **NEED** a tutor who scored within the range of your goal score (and if they did better than your goal score that is obviously a huge plus). This isn’t for everyone, but I would choose between 10 and 20 hours to maximize the value of those hours. If you’re cheap like me, just use those sessions to ask for their overall strategy tips. Have tutors teach you to fish, not give you fish metaphorically speaking. If you have specific problems that you are stuck on, just go on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mcat/) or [Facebook study groups](https://mcatselfprep.com/join-facebook-study-group/) and get answers for free. Bottom line: if you are going to get tutoring help, make sure the company/friend that you choose has tutors who scored higher than your goal score at the minimum.

# 4. Getting The Right MCAT Prep Materials 

Success on the MCAT does not necessarily mean getting a high score. Personal success is instead defined by over-performing based on the natural abilities and weaknesses that we individually bring to the table. Success is doing the best that you can do. The key to success for the MCAT or any difficult task is in the preparation. Prepping for the MCAT starts with getting the right materials. Let’s review what you should buy—from books, to practice tests, to the official AAMC material.

# Books

Buying review books can be tricky. Reading them can be even more exhausting. Honestly, reading MCAT prep books were the least helpful thing for me. But I don’t want my experience to color yours as a lot of students find them to be incredibly helpful. The basic breakdown is that the Kaplan books are the standard and they cover all of the main material for the MCAT. Most people buy those. The added depth makes the Princeton Review books more dense and difficult to read but includes lots of low-yield topics for those trying to score super high. I personally chose the Princeton Review Books because they offered low-yield facts that you needed to know to score in the 100th percentile. However, they had terrible suggestions for CARS. Again this is just my experience. I also stopped reading the content books altogether after about 2 months of study. However, some people swear by it (especially books that are more fun and engaging like Exam Krackers)

*I personally bought the Princeton Review books because they are more detailed (with less engaging pictures).*

**Princeton Review** – $100-200

**Kaplan** – $100-200

**Exam Krakers** – $100-200

# Videos

Other students, like me, choose to watch MCAT prep videos on YouTube. There are lots of options to choose from between Khan Academy, AK lectures, and more. Khan Academy is the gold standard because the AAMC paid Khan Academy to make the only official prep videos. Khan Academy, therefore, had insider access to all the AAMC material. Some students don’t like Khan Academy because they speak incredibly slow. I got a chrome extension called [Video Speed Controller](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk?hl=en) so you can watch videos at over 2x speed (I would watch them up to 3.5x speed on subjects I understood really well) to save me dozens of hours. 

# Khan Academy Videos vs. Prep Books

Both options provide advantages and disadvantages. Khan Academy uses the official AAMC material to make their videos, but it will take you much longer to work through all of them than getting through the books. I may take 2-6 months to get through the videos and in that same time it would take you 2-6 weeks to get through the prep books. Ask yourself: do I zone out more during boring lectures or reading boring textbooks? There’s no other way to put it, getting through dozens of science subjects will inevitably become boring no matter how nerdy you are.

# Practice Tests 

Aside from buying the AAMC practice tests, some students purchase third party full-length exams (FLEs) if they have time in their schedule. Only buy these if you have extra study time available, otherwise, just start with the AAMC material. Practice tests are incredibly helpful because they teach you test-taking endurance and build your familiarity with the MCAT format. They are also a great way to learn content! The common practice test makers are Kaplan, Blueprint, Altius, and Princeton Review. For your convenience, we compiled a list of [the best free and low cost practice exams](https://mcatselfprep.com/free-and-low-cost-mcat-practice-exams/) to get you started. All of them are generally harder than the AAMC tests themselves. Kaplan’s are the most similar to the AAMC (add 2-3 pts to your FLE score) and Princeton Review’s are the hardest (I bombed a PR test and then scored 16 points higher on an official AAMC test THE NEXT DAY). Blueprint (add 3-4 pts to your score) and Altius (add 5-6 pts to your score) are in the middle. I would recommend buying the Altius tests if you want to practice with greater resistance (think of training with heavier weights to make competition seem easier) or Kaplan/Blueprint if you want to practice with a similar level of difficulty. Most of the top scorers will say that doing FLEs is the best way to prepare for the MCAT. I agree. 

*I personally bought 10 Altius practice tests for $150 when they went on sale.*

# AAMC

[I cannot recommend strongly enough that you buy all of the AAMC material](http://offers.aamc.org/mcat-study-materials-1). It’s almost a requirement. You’ll need it. All of it. It’s truly worth every penny. Save at least 4 AAMC FLEs until your last month of studying. Take your first three official FLEs 3, 2, and 1 week away. The order doesn’t matter. Then take your last AAMC FLE (one of the scored ones) three days before test day. Make sure you spend at least 3 hours reviewing these tests the day after you take them. AAMC has also given us the opportunity to take thousands of prepared, official questions. Make sure you do them all. 

# Other

Some students choose to buy the massive [UWorld](https://www.uworld.com/collegeprep/mcat/mcat.aspx) section bank instead of practice tests. UWorld has done an incredible job creating excellent questions and explanations for each answer. They put out some of the highest quality prep material that I’ve seen.

*I personally did not buy UWorld because I opted for only using practice tests.*

# 5. Mastering Content for the MCAT

Educational researchers have spent decades trying to understand how we all learn best and this form of self-testing wins out every time. Self-testing can involve many layers, from practice problems to mental outlines, but the basic principle is creating scenarios for yourself where you are forced to recall information about the material you studied. The beauty of self-testing is that it doesn’t even matter how accurately you can recall information; the physical act of recall is what strengthens the connections in your brain on a cellular level (this process is called long term potentiation for all the nerds out there). When active recall is paired with spaced-repetition, this strengthens these mental connections more and more. 

For most of us, flashcards are the simplest method of self-testing. You may remember making physical flashcards to learn a language or study for an exam in high school. However, with technology at our disposal, making flashcards has never been easier or more organized. You can even find [new, creative ways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIyDJK_SAjs) to make flashcards on your own. However, if you are looking for tried and true methods that have enabled hundreds of the top scorers in the past, look no further than Quizlet and Anki.

# Quizlet 

[Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/) is probably the flashcard software that you are most familiar with. The user interface is intuitive and user-friendly. There are hundreds of pre-made decks for the MCAT that you can search through if you don’t have the time or patience to make your own cards. However, Quizlet recently removed their spaced-repetition software and so there is no great way to only review the cards that you need to revisit. Our best advice is to star the cards that you miss and come back to the decks that you’ve done after 2 days, a week, and once a month so that all of that information stays in your long-term memory. Another downside is that some of the advanced features like self-testing with images cost extra. 

*I personally purchased the pre-made Quizlet decks as a part of the* [*Advanced Pro Package*](https://mcatselfprep.com/upgrade-to-pro/) *in addition to using Anki.*

# Anki

If you haven’t heard of [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) by now, you probably haven’t talked to anyone in medical school. Anki, with spaced-repetition self-testing, has truly revolutionized medical education as we know it. Anki allows medical students, and MCAT test-takers, to store massive amounts of information in long-term memory. Think of Anki as a bare-bones version of Quizlet, except with an algorithm that dictates when you see new cards. After you reveal the answer to a given flashcard, you tell the algorithm whether that card was easy, medium, or hard for you. If it was hard, you may see that card the next day. If it was easy, you may see it in 5 days. Gradually, the intervals lengthen and so if you choose medium repeatedly for a card you would see it after 2, 4, 8, 12, and then 20 days for example. 

Anki also allows you to create cards using screenshots on your computer. You can choose which area of the image you want to cover and then the “back of the flashcard answer” will reveal that area. Again, you can choose whether it was easy, medium, or hard to recall that visual answer. 

The only downside to Anki is that there is a significant start-up cost associated with learning how to use the application. It’s free which is nice, but if you want to download Anki to an iPhone that will also cost you $25. To learn to use Anki, I would recommend watching some [Youtube ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLeZR5LtbJ8Klmeux_6TTJw)[tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K2StK7e3ww&list=PL2ADAFpTg5aYuGojjD_O0mU1uml7Plw2Q) because Anki is hard to figure out at first. These two video tutorial channels helped me a lot. Definitely figure out how to use image occlusion and close deletions for your card types and get a few more add-ons. Here is the list the [add-ons](https://imgur.com/a/DxK6B91) that I ended up using. 

Whether you end up using Quizlet or Anki, there are options to use pre-made decks. If you are short on time, FREE [pre-made Anki decks](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sz-vjFGyoGkwxLe8jd__537n8_O0QuFO/view) can help save time. But if you plan on dedicating a few months to MCAT studying, please… MAKE YOUR OWN CARDS. This will force you to actively engage in the learning process and your increased score will reflect that.

# 6. Moving from Mastering Content to Mastering Practice Tests

You’ve worked your way through all the content required for the MCAT. You’ve started learning how the AAMC wants you to think on test day! But despite all of these accomplishments, you still can’t get a handle on the timing for some or all of the sections on the MCAT. While we can’t fix timing issues overnight, here are 4 tricks to help with time management for the MCAT.

# Clockwork

For CARS, you will be given 90 minutes to complete 53 questions and 95 minutes to complete 59 questions for the other three science sections. On test-day, a timer will be counting down in the upper right-hand corner to show you how much time you have remaining. This can be both a blessing and a curse. For some of us, it aids in adjusting our test-taking speed in real-time. But for most of us, the timer just adds unnecessary stress. Stress can even slow us down by paralyzing some students in fear! Therefore, it becomes critical to use the timer as a valuable resource, without it becoming a distraction. 

A good sweet spot is to look at the timer at three critical points during the test and forget it for the rest. For the science sections, optimal pacing can be broken down to completing 20 questions every 30 minutes. This can be translated to test day by glancing at the clock after you have completed 20, 40, and 59 questions. After 20 questions, you should see that you have 1 hour and 5 minutes left. After 40 you should see 35 minutes left. For CARS, there are 9 passages and so you should complete 3 passages every 30 minutes. If you have more or less time at these waypoints, this will dictate your pacing for the rest of the section. 

# Too little time?

If you find yourself falling behind the ideal testing pace, there are a few things that you can do. The bottom line is that you ultimately need to find a strategy that works best for you. Will you read the passages faster? Answer questions relying more on your gut instincts? Skip an entire passage to focus on the others instead (not recommended if trying to score 510+)? Try all of these methods out in practice sessions and choose the one that feels the most natural for you. No matter how far behind you are… *still take the time to read the question stems quickly*. The questions themselves are the most important piece of each passage and understanding them properly will yield the most points possible in a time crunch.

# Too much time?

*Less than 5 minutes of extra time?* Spend these extra seconds focusing on 1 or 2 problems that you needed extra time on. Don’t try to skim through all of your flagged questions.

*5 minutes of extra time?* Try to skim through all of your flagged questions and focus on the few hardest questions for you. In general, it makes much more sense to spend an extra 30 seconds in the initial read of the question while your brain has been synthesizing the information at hand. Don’t just flag every hard question to come back to later. Splitting up the time will force you to restart your thought processes and it limits your effectiveness (although occasionally your brain will gain new insights subconsciously in the while working through other problems).

*10-15 minutes of extra time?* Use this time to double-check every. single. question. Don’t take the time to redo every problem, just check to make sure each choice answered the right question. Your primary job is to catch dumb mistakes like missing negative modifiers in the question stems (NOT/LEAST/WEAKENS etc.) 

*20-25 minutes of extra time?* Run through every question again while also pausing to re-solve difficult and flagged questions. Perhaps you would benefit from reading passages and questions more carefully when working through them for the first time.

*30+ minutes of extra time?* This usually only applies to quick test-takers on the Behavioral Sciences section. If you usually finish with TONS of time to spare, you need to slooooooow yourself down. We know that you’re tired. We know that you’ve been sitting for 7 hours and just want to see your MCAT score. But practice test-taking conditions. Take the extra time to double-check every answer the first time. Read slowly and read every word of the passage. Try to finish with only 20 minutes to spare. This will bump your score up by at least a point or two.

# Practicing Timing

To practice timing, consider doing blocks of 20 science questions in 30 minutes. Do 40 questions in an hour. Practice your pacing. Practice the controlled rushing. Practice endurance as well by doing 12 CARS passages in 2 hours. Do 80 science questions in 2 hours. From there, a normal MCAT section should feel like a breeze. 

If you are still struggling with timing, don’t be hesitant to reach out for [private tutoring options](https://mcatselfprep.com/elite-mcat-tutoring/). All of our tutors went through the same struggles that you are experiencing. We would be happy to share our expertise!

# 7. Test Day is Game Day

Most students who have taken the MCAT will consistently cite taking practice tests as the most important part of their preparation. However, practice tests can improve your MCAT score even more if you use them to simulate test-day conditions. As part of our online MCAT course, we walk our students through every aspect of the test-day experience. Here are a few pro-tips and aspects of test-day that will help you maximize the benefit from your practice tests.

# Using the Tutorial Time to Boost your Score

Before your practice tests, you will encounter a 10-minute tutorial that walks you through every feature of the MCAT software. For your first practice test, we recommend that you use this time to learn about all of the features at your disposal. Once you’ve familiarized yourself with these features, for subsequent tests you can breeze through this introduction to get right to the test. Most MCAT prep courses will recommend that you skip this section on test day as well. But on test day, every minute that you’re given is precious. 

One pro-tip that can boost your score is using this 10-minute introduction to create a reference sheet for your test day. On test-day, you are given a booklet of dry-erase sheets. During the introduction, you can write down every memorization-heavy concept that you find difficult to remember. Some examples are all of the amino acid R groups, stages of development according to various psychologists, even a list of physics equations! Spend an hour during the day or two before your test to create this list ahead of time. Then practice copying this list down from memory over and over again until you can do so effortlessly. Bring this list with you to the testing center so you can glance at it one last time before you head in to take your test. Again, we want to simulate test-taking conditions as much as possible when taking practice tests. So an option is to take your practice tests with this reference sheet in front of you! Hooray! No more memorizing pesky physics equations! (That said, we do recommend that you don’t take practice tests with the amino acid R groups in front of you as you should know them like the back of your hand even without the reference sheet.)

# Noise Cancelation and Screen Dimensions

The next thing you may notice when you sit down to take your test is the noise cancelation options and the dimensions of your screen. Pearson testing centers offer two methods of noise cancelation for every student: over-the-ear headphones and ear-plugs. In my experience, the headphones offered were terrible. They hurt my ears. I decided to use ear-plugs instead, but again it’s a personal preference. For either method, we recommend taking practice tests with the method of noise cancelation that you decide on (but if it’s headphones don’t use your $300 fancy ones because you will be disappointed on test-day). 

The MCAT will be administered on Windows desktops. If possible, take your practice tests on desktops with a mouse instead of a laptop. The dimensions of the test will also be squared with black bars on either side. This makes the CARS passages seem longer because you need to scroll more to get through them. So when taking practice tests, square your browser screen to simulate this effect.

# Taking Breaks

Because the MCAT lasts almost an entire day, you will be allowed to take 3 breaks during your test-day experience. Your breaks will last 10, 30, and 10 minutes after your Chemistry and Physics, CARS, and Biology and Biochemistry sections respectively. To make the most of these breaks, successful test-takers will fuel up with both foods and liquids. We think of taking the MCAT as running a marathon. It’s long. It’s hard. This endurance requires a constant and consistent output of energy. Marathon runners refuel by eating protein bars and other healthy foods. As you may know from your studies, sugary foods burn fast and bright but lead to physical and cognitive crashes after they are used up. We recommend eating and drinking as you would for a marathon (including frequent bathroom breaks). However, finding your own balance is the most important aspect of MCAT nutrition. Experiment with your breaks for your first few practice tests until you find out what works.

A word on caffeine: Just as you want to maintain consistent levels of blood sugar to prevent crashes, make sure to keep a consistent caffeine intake if you choose to use it. It’s much better to sip on a caffeinated beverage at each of your breaks rather than chugging 2 coffees right before the test starts. If you feel yourself crashing before the final section, feel free to pound caffeine to get you over the final hump because you can always crash later. As a natural alternative or supplement, I also did push-ups and jumping jacks during my breaks to wake my body up. Keeping the blood flowing can restart your focus after sitting in front of a computer for hours on end. 

# My Test Day Experience

Either the actual test day is the most stressful moment of your life or you are a legit sociopath. I was FREAKING OUT, PEOPLE! I drove to check out the testing center the day before. I typically have a hard time sleeping, but before the MCAT was another experience entirely. I took melatonin to try to get some rest, but I couldn’t sleep at all for the **TWO NIGHTS** before my test day. I could honestly account for every hour of the night. Not falling asleep just led to me stressing more so it was even harder to fall asleep. Horrible. But it’s ok! Even if you’re tired, it won’t make your mind forget all the content that you learned. For game day, your goal is just to get excited. It’s finally going to be over. Be confident. You put in hundreds of hours. TRUST YOUR STUDIES. If you come to a question and you are unsure, go with your gut. You may remember the appropriate content subconsciously. 

When you get to the center, they start checking you in right away. Even if you’re early. Be early. But you don’t have to take a number right away. Wait until you’re ready. For security reasons, proctors will scan your palms. They lead you to your chair. They offer you earplugs, dry erase sheets and a marker. When you sit down after a break, they start you immediately—even if you still had 2 minutes remaining for your break. If you run a bit over your break, don’t worry. They give you \~2 minutes to just read the info start screen of each section so your time will only be deducted from that. If you have that time, use it to calm yourself before starting. Don’t rush yourself. Breathe.

Since I got no sleep, I took a ton of caffeine over the course of the test. About 20-50 mg before and during every break. I crashed like a zombie after it was all done, but I never felt sleepy or crashed during the test. To naturally keep your alertness levels up, a friend suggested that I do push-ups during the break to keep the blood flowing. That really helped. Your breaks are shorter than you remember, but you should eat something during every break or else you will crash. When taking FLEs, find out what food sustains you best. Don’t eat sugary trash. Eat protein bars and real food. Eat like you would eat if running a marathon, small but consistent, so you don’t hit a food coma either. Poop and pee before you enter the exam. Multiple times. Everything should be totally flushed out down there.

After each section, you want to get in the mental space of feeling relief. Done with CARS? You will never have to read another CARS passage again. Did the last section not go that well? Don’t let it bleed into the next section. Let it go. You should be getting more excited and more relaxed as the day progresses. Stressed? Tell yourself to let it go. Let it all go from your head. Your mental appraisal is very important to doing well. 

In the end, if your computer didn’t explode and if you didn’t throw up on yourself, **don’t void your test**. Natural variation in test day scores happens. You may score better or worse than your practice tests, but how you felt about your test is not correlated to your actual score. *Even if you don’t feel confident, score it*. Don’t spend more than 15 seconds on voiding your test page. Let it all go. You did it.

# Frequently Asked Questions



# How Do I Start studying?

For most students, I recommend taking the MCAT during summer before or summer when you apply for medical school. Taking the test over the summer with minimal or no classes allows you to compress your study timeline. I wouldn’t recommend anything longer than 6 months because (let’s be real), you won’t remember what you studied 8 months before. I can barely remember what I did last weekend, let alone my study sessions from last semester. Whenever you take the MCAT, make sure you give yourself enough time to study to get the score you want. After taking a free diagnostic test, decide on a goal score and calculate the number of hours that you need to study with the Create-your-own Study Plan Course. A good rule of thumb is that studying 10 hours a week for a month will average about a 1.5 point increase. So if you study 20hrs/week for 3 months you should expect to jump up by 9 points. If you are studying during the semester plan it out in advance to deliberately make that semester as light as possible.

I personally took the MCAT on May 23rd and started studying during the previous winter break. I studied during the spring semester but only took 12 credits that were fairly easy and then studied full-time for 4 weeks before my MCAT.

The MCAT study timeline should be largely broken into two phases. The first phase’s goal is to get through all the content. The second phase’s goal is to improve your test-taking abilities. The content phase should last until you are one month away from the test date (if you’re studying for 6 months then this would be the first 5), and then the final month should be primarily devoted to taking full-lengths. Whatever you do, I would highly recommend devoting at least 2-3 weeks before the test to do nothing but MCAT study. The 8-hour test (or 6 hour test for Summer 2020) should feel like a 2-hour test by test day. It won’t feel like a breeze, but it shouldn’t leave you mentally drained. That’s your goal.

# Should I use a prep course or self study?

The first question that you may ask yourself is: Will I use a prep program to learn the content or will I self-study? You should instead ask yourself: Do I want to pay thousands of dollars to learn content when I could learn it for free by myself? The secret that the prep companies will never tell you is that the AAMC (the MCAT administration) actually paid Khan Academy to create thousands of hours of videos that teach you the content directly. For free. It’s actually as close as you can get to the source itself. All the other prep companies, on the other hand, essentially try to parrot those same videos but charge you thousands of dollars for you to get it from a more-distant source.

I personally only watched the Khan Academy videos on the MCAT Self Prep ecourse playlists and supplemented them with Princeton Review content book reading for concepts that I struggled with.

Most Expensive: Kaplan, PrincetonReview, NextStep etc. ($2000+)

Middle Option: Smaller prep companies with condensed videos ($400-999)

Least Expensive: MCAT Self Prep / Khan Academy (Free)

# Should I get an MCAT Tutor?

The second and last question that you need to ask yourself is this: can I do this alone? To answer this, you need to dig deep. Are you self-motivated? Do you hold yourself accountable? Are you a naturally gifted test-taker? The question isn’t am I driven?, but how do I learn best? Most people will say… If you are self-motivated then you should self-study, but this, in my opinion, isn’t true. I, for one, am self-motivated but I needed structure too.

That’s why I personally chose MCAT Self Prep—a free program that gives you structure but lets you customize through self-study.

If you decide that you need accountability/test-taking advice, I would consider hiring a tutor. The last thing you want to do is take this test twice (the opportunity cost is huge), so it is totally worth spending the money to succeed the first time. If you decide to use tutoring, you NEED a tutor who scored within the range of your goal score (and if they did better than your goal score that is obviously a huge plus). This isn’t for everyone, but I would choose between 10 and 20 hours to maximize the value of those hours. If you’re cheap like me, just use those sessions to ask for their overall strategy tips. Have tutors teach you to fish, not give you fish metaphorically speaking. If you have specific problems that you are stuck on, just go on reddit or Facebook study groups and get answers for free. Bottom line: if you are going to get tutoring help, make sure the company/friend that you choose has tutors who scored higher than your goal score at the minimum.

Most Expensive: Kaplan, PrincetonReview, NextStep etc. ($5000+)

Middle Option: MCAT Self Prep Premium Elite Tutoring or Elite Tutoring

Least Expensive: Study Groups/Friends (Free)

# Which MCAT books should I study?

Buying review books can be tricky. Reading them can be even more exhausting. Honestly, reading MCAT prep books were the least helpful thing for me. But I don’t want my experience to color yours as a lot of students find them to be incredibly helpful. The basic breakdown is that the Kaplan books are the standard and they cover all of the main material for the MCAT. Most people buy those. The added depth makes the Princeton Review books more dense and difficult to read but includes lots of low-yield topics for those trying to score super high. I personally chose the Princeton Review Books because they offered low-yield facts that you needed to know to score in the 100th percentile. However, they had terrible suggestions for CARS. Again this is just my experience. I also stopped reading the content books altogether after about 2 months of study. However, some people swear by it (especially books that are more fun and engaging like Exam Krackers)

I personally bought the Princeton Review books because they are more detailed (with less engaging pictures).

Princeton Review – $100-200

Kaplan – $100-200

Exam Krakers – $100-200

# What MCAT practice tests should I take?

Aside from buying the AAMC practice tests, some students purchase third party full-length exams (FLEs) if they have time in their schedule. Only buy these if you have extra study time available, otherwise, just start with the AAMC material. Practice tests are incredibly helpful because they teach you test-taking endurance and build your familiarity with the MCAT format. They are also a great way to learn content! The common practice test makers are Kaplan, Blueprint, Altius, and Princeton Review. For your convenience, we compiled a list of the best free and low cost practice exams to get you started. All of them are generally harder than the AAMC tests themselves. Kaplan’s are the most similar to the AAMC (add 2-3 pts to your FLE score) and Princeton Review’s are the hardest (I bombed a PR test and then scored 16 points higher on an official AAMC test THE NEXT DAY). Blueprint (add 3-4 pts to your score) and Altius (add 5-6 pts to your score) are in the middle. I would recommend buying the Altius tests if you want to practice with greater resistance (think of training with heavier weights to make competition seem easier) or Kaplan/Blueprint if you want to practice with a similar level of difficulty. Most of the top scorers will say that doing FLEs is the best way to prepare for the MCAT. I agree.

I personally bought 10 Altius practice tests for $150 when they went on sale.

I cannot recommend strongly enough that you buy all of the AAMC material. It’s almost a requirement. You’ll need it. All of it. It’s truly worth every penny. Save at least 4 AAMC FLEs until your last month of studying. Take your first three official FLEs 3, 2, and 1 week away. The order doesn’t matter. Then take your last AAMC FLE (one of the scored ones) three days before test day. Make sure you spend at least 3 hours reviewing these tests the day after you take them. AAMC has also given us the opportunity to take thousands of prepared, official questions. Make sure you do them all.",1,1759382040.0,u_MCATSelfPrep,0,1.0,False

V: Um, hi, just making sure I'm in the right place. This is the Vampire's Lair, right? The new coffee shop just for vampires?

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

V: Oh, thanks! I thought I took a wrong turn up the street and was just walking in circles. 

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

V: Well, it's a pretty hidden place, like, literally a hole in the wall. If it wasn't for the candles and the open sign, I would have walked right past. Which, I guess is a good thing but it really tripped me up.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

V: Oh, right, right! Um, let's see... I haven't had coffee in so long! I mean I know a lot of people drink it for the taste, but I used it for energy. So when I became a vampire, I stopped drinking it because I didn't need it anymore. 

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

V: My friend just kept raving about how good everything was, along with the relaxing atmosphere and I figured I had to at least come here and try something. Um, I think I'll just keep it simple with a mocha and...ooo can I also grab one of those raspberry cheese danish pastries? 

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

V: Hmmm, B positive in the mocha please, and uh...O negative in the danish. Yeah, that seems like a good mix. 

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

V: Extra whipped cream and chocolate sauce, and can you heat up the danish, please? Thank you! How much do I owe?

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

V: That's a lot less than I thought it would be. Here ya go. Do I just wait at the counter or...?

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

V: Oh, you bring it to the table? Nice, I'll go sit down then.

\[Clattering, wind, coffee and food put on table\]

V: Wow, that was fast! I literally just sat down! Oh, right, superspeed. I always forget that one. 

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

V: Yeah, I'm a bit of a newly turned vampire, it's only been a few months. Still getting used to everything we can do. I usually keep doing things the human way because it's just part of my routine. 

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

V: Yeah, the first time I tried using superspeed, I ran straight into a tree. And floating was even harder, but that might be because I'm scared of heights. Eh, I'll get it eventually. \[Takes drink and bite\] Mmmmmm!

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

V: Yeah it's amazing! I'm surprised how well everything blends! I thought that the taste of the B positive would overpower everything else, but it's great! Thanks!

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

V: Oh, I'm going to hang out for a while and feel the atmosphere that my friend said was so calming. Is there a time limit on the table?

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

V: Oh, I'm just going to hang around for an hour or so. I'll be out long before the sun comes up. Hm? Oh, sure, you can sit and ask some more questions on your break. I'm not exactly great at talking but I don't mind people. I'm glad I seem interesting enough to talk to! I'm a bit surprised someone so cute- um I mean- cool wants to talk to me

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

V: Alright, see you in a few then! \[Footsteps\] Oh, I hope they don't think I'm weird for that. I doubt they meant it as anything more than a friendly chat. Probably just curious, considering I'm a new vampire. Hopefully I didn't scare them off. I mean they are adorable, but I also wouldn't mind just making a new friend.

The Reality Check:
I reached 178 lbs one month ago and truly felt awful about myself. All of my clothes no longer fit I was exhausted by 2 PM every day and I continued to begin diets that I would quit within days. Ring a bell? I'd attempted everything  calorie counting low carb  pricey meal prep companies that I never lasted more than a week with. 

Then I came across something new. 

What Changed Everything:
I came across this 21 day smoothie diet that revolves around nutrient packed recipes intended to naturally increase metabolism and suppress hunger. Every smoothie mixes particular fruits greens and proteins that really satisfy you rather than leave you hungry.


Why I Tried It:
Honestly I was skeptical as heck. But I thought even if it didn't do anything for weight loss at least I'd be getting more vitamins than my typical diet of coffee and whatever I managed to scrounge between meetings. 

The Results Caught Me Off Guard: 

Days 1-7: Lost 5 lbs and actually had energy in the afternoons 

Days 8-14: Junk food cravings nearly disappeared 

Days 15-21: Lost a total of 11 lbs sleeping better skin clearer 

The Surprising Side Benefits: 

No longer 3 PM energy crashes that left me grabbing for sugar 

Actually started craving the flavor of healthy food again 

My mood increased dramatically (fewer hangry moments) 

Felt like I wasn't constantly waging war with hunger 

The Truth:
It wasn't a magic bullet  I still had to make intentional decisions every day. There were certainly times when I craved pizza over a green smoothie. But with a defined uncomplicated system in place it was a lot easier to stay on track. 

What I Learned
The greatest victory wasn't even the weight loss  it was finally ending the cycle of starting and quitting diets. For the first time in years I had a sense of control over my eating.

1nvuxj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nvuxj8/how_to_choose_an_espresso_machine_for_ecofriendly/,How to choose an espresso machine for eco-friendly options?,"Hey coffee enthusiasts!

I've been on a journey to make my morning coffee routine more environmentally friendly, and I wanted to share what I've learned about choosing an eco-friendly espresso machine. After months of research and testing different options, I've discovered some pretty interesting stuff.

First things first, energy efficiency is crucial. I used to have this old machine that was basically an electricity vampire. When I switched to a newer, energy-efficient model (I found some great options here: https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine), my electricity bill actually went down noticeably.

Here's what I look for in an eco-friendly espresso machine:

1. Auto shut-off features - This is non-negotiable. It saves energy and prevents those facepalm moments when you rush to work wondering if you left it on.

2. Material quality - Look for machines with durable stainless steel components instead of plastic. They last longer and create less waste in the long run.

3. Water efficiency - Some machines use way more water than necessary. The newer models have better water management systems.

4. Reusable filters - Skip those paper filters! A good metal filter will last years and makes better coffee anyway.

I also learned that maintenance plays a huge role in sustainability. A well-maintained machine lasts longer and works more efficiently. Clean it regularly, descale when needed, and it'll serve you for years.

Temperature control is another big factor. The best eco-friendly machines heat up quickly and maintain temperature without constant reheating. This saves both energy and time - win-win!

One thing that surprised me was how important the grinder type is. Built-in grinders can be more energy-efficient than separate ones, plus they reduce packaging waste. I found some excellent options with integrated grinders at https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine.

Pod machines might seem convenient, but they're usually not the most eco-friendly choice. The waste from those little capsules adds up fast. However, if you're set on a pod machine, look for ones compatible with reusable pods.

Consider the company's environmental commitment too. Some manufacturers are really stepping up with recycling programs and sustainable manufacturing practices.

Quick tip: Look for machines with programmable start times. You can set it to warm up right before you wake up instead of leaving it on standby all night.

After switching to an eco-friendly machine, I noticed my coffee actually tastes better. Maybe it's because I'm more mindful of the whole process, or maybe these machines are just built better.

Remember, the most sustainable option is the one you'll use for years to come. Don't fall for gimmicky features you'll never use. Focus on quality, efficiency, and durability.

I'd love to hear about your experiences with eco-friendly coffee making. What features do you find most important in an espresso machine?",1,1759381678.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

1nvuw58,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nvuw58,📢 My Struggle with LeBrew Sweet Burrs 📢,"Let me explain the story from the beginning:
	•	First order I got the Sweet burrs and started seasoning them… by mistake I ground a stone 😅💔.
	•	I said fine, I’ll just order another set. When the second one arrived… I discovered it was different from the first one!
	•	I contacted the company’s official Instagram account, they said: “No, there’s no difference, they’re all the same.” 🤥
	•	I didn’t stop there! I reached out to someone named Ryan (people say he’s the owner).
And here’s the surprise 👇
	•	Ryan admitted and said: “Yes, there is a difference. I’ll send you one that matches yours, but right now I’m out of stock. Once the new batch arrives, I’ll make one just like it for you.”
	•	I waited patiently, and at the end he told me: “Give me your address.”
Then immediately… BLOCKED me 😂😂😂.
	•	I went back and contacted the official company account again, told them I had spoken with Ryan and that he admitted the difference. Guess what? They blocked me too 😂😂.

🔍 What really made me focus and realize there’s a difference:
	•	The cup profile is different!
	•	Grinding behavior:
	•	The new burrs produce way more fines than the old ones.
	•	The old burrs: balanced, worked great for both espresso and filter.
	•	The new burrs: almost impossible to use for filter because of the excessive fines.
	•	Numbers (with DF83V):
	•	Old burrs: espresso dialed in between 10 – 20.
	•	New burrs: espresso between 30 – 40!
	•	To be clear, alignment is 100% (I checked multiple times 😅), so the problem is with the burrs themselves, not installation.

🔍 Additional Note:
	•	The old burrs were used for about 3kg of coffee.
	•	After around two weeks, I bought the new ones.
	•	The pictures you see… the new burrs had only ground 1kg of coffee!
Just look at the color difference 😂☕️

The issue I keep running into is that I’m originally from a Middle Eastern country, and sadly, those places don’t have a great reputation when it comes to LGBTQ+ rights.

Whenever someone asks me where I’m from and I tell them, it often changes the vibe completely—even if the conversation was going great before.

I had an experience with having a friendship with a lesbian women, it was a coincidence of circumstances, she was working in the accommodation that I used to live in as a receptionist so we used to see each other daily, it started as a formal interaction (like any resident and staff situation) and over time, we naturally got to know each other better. She realized that my background didn’t mean that I had any negative views about her community, and I understood her community better too. It just became a really nice, easy-going friendship because I had that daily chance to break down stereotypes on both sides (and these conversations is what started my interest in exploring new things).

With dating(especially online dating)I don’t have that daily, casual interaction. People might see where you’re from and just decide not to give you a chance. So that’s the challenge.

So is there any way that I can meet (femboy or a sissy) in a calm welcoming community and just have a coffee or any chill activities without my background instantly becoming an issue?",0,1759380664.0,NewcastleUponTyne,1,0.23,False

A story of trauma bond,"First of all, I'm checking myself into therapy. I understand the length of time I'm grieving this is abnormal. I'm clearly trauma-bonded. I need to snap out of it.

Three years ago, I was in an 8-month relationship with a fearful avoidant. During our relationship, I significantly supported her. She had just moved to the US from LATAM, was struggling financially etc. I helped her buy a motorcycle, taught her to ride, provided emotional and practical support as she navigated a new country.

Early on, she warned me: ""I don't know why, but whenever I feel trapped, I need to run."" I didn't fully understand what this meant at the time.

**Her background that's relevant:**

* Only child who was chronically ill as a child
* Lost her father young
* Parentified relationship with her mother (she was the caretaker)
* Has moved between multiple countries
* Changes jobs frequently
* Keeps all her exes as ""friends""

**Red flags I noticed during the relationship:**

* Dissociated during intimacy (described it as ""deer in headlights"" - physically present but emotionally disconnected)
* Couldn't maintain eye contact during emotional conversations
* Told me asking for cuddles was ""toxic""
* Couldn't cry even when physically hurt
* When I asked her basic future planning questions (""what do you want to do in the US?""), she broke down crying saying ""I don't know""
* Constantly felt like I was ""walking on eggshells""
* She was extremely ""hard to read""
* I remember thinking ""when is she going to leave?"" even when things seemed fine

**The discard:**

I lost my job. When I told her, I said ""We'll be fine because I love you."" She gave me a forced smile. 

Then I asked her to move in together and choose a vacation destination - normal relationship progression stuff. She completely shut down.

She suddenly discarded me without warning. No fight, no explanation, just gone. When I asked why, she said:

* ""I don't know why I lost feelings""
* ""I thought you were going to abandon me"" (ironic since SHE left)
* Later blamed it on me not wanting kids (though we'd never discussed this seriously)

**Her behavior after the discard:**

For the next TWO YEARS, she kept trying to contact me:

* Repeatedly offered friendship: ""You're an important person in my life, please accept my friendship""
* Bypassed blocks to reach me
* Would show up in places I might be
* Sent me an email saying she'd been ""thinking about me a lot"" but calling her actions ""not eloquent"" (massive minimization)

Every time I tried to reconnect romantically or even just asked to get coffee, she would immediately say ""but as friends"" with nervous stuttering. When I asked if she wanted to try again after the discard, she said NO.

**Her statements during this period:**

* ""At least you can love"" (while crying - acknowledging her own limitation)
* ""I was wearing a mask, the real me is a piece of shit""
* ""It's always like this in the beginning"" (referring to initial relationship intensity)
* When I told her ""you deeply hurt me,"" she responded: ""I don't know what to tell you. Time will heal.""
* When I said ""it's sad it ended up like this,"" she said NOTHING

**My final boundary (2 years ago):**

After two years of this push-pull, I told her: ""I don't love you. I don't like you. This relationship is over. Leave me alone."" I blocked her on everything except email.

During that call, I told her ""People don't just leave and discard others. They try to fix things."" She started crying and said ""I don't know how to.""

I maintained no contact for 1 years. Started healing. Started dating again.

**What happened this week:**

My dad just passed away and in a moment of vulnerability, I reached out to her. Big mistake.

She was incredibly kind and warm. Acknowledged that some things she said in the past were cruel. This completely confused me after years of pain and made me question everything.

1. She now has a boyfriend
2. After our last conversation 1 year ago (where I told her to leave me alone), she claims she ""looked for me everywhere, Facebook, Instagram"" wanting to try again romantically
3. She says she couldn't reach me because I had blocked her (but email was always open - she never used it)
4. She claims she mentioned wanting to get back together during that last call (I have ZERO memory of this - I clearly remember she only offered friendship for 2 years straight)
5. She framed it as: ""I tried, you blocked me, now it's too late because I have a boyfriend""
6. She said her current boyfriend taught her she needs to ""speak up and have conversations"" and she regrets not communicating better with me

**Why I'm confused:**

FOR TWO YEARS before that final conversation, every single interaction:

* I'd ask to reconnect: ""Just as friends""
* I'd invite her for coffee: ""As friends?""
* I'd ask if she wanted to try again: ""No""
* Consistent message: Friendship only, no romantic feelings

Then suddenly after I firmly reject her and block her, she claims she wanted to try again romantically? But now she doesn't because she has a boyfriend.

**My questions:**

1. Is her ""I looked for you to try again"" story likely true, or is this manipulation?
2. If she genuinely wanted to reconnect romantically, why didn't she send ONE clear email (which was never blocked) stating this?
3. Is she rewriting history about our last conversation? (She claims she mentioned wanting to try again, but I don't remember this at all)
4. Did I actually ""miss my chance"" by blocking her, or is this a way for her to deflect responsibility?
5. My friend says she ""just wanted to be chased"" and this is about keeping me in her orbit. Does this make sense from an attachment theory perspective?
6. She mentioned feeling ""safe to be vulnerable now because there's no pressure"" since she has a boyfriend. Is this genuine or manipulative?",7,1759380510.0,AvoidantBreakUps,6,1.0,False

Killed a case of Yuengling and a giant bottle of makers. Drinking the last of this shitty box wine at 11:2pm and the magnesium and melatonin just isn't working.

Just ordered 2 cases of light beer to be delivered tomorrow. Figure on Thursday I'll do 6 at night, the same on Friday and try to dial it back to 5 on Saturday/Sunday, try for 4 on Monday/Tuesday and try to get to 3 by next Wednesday/Thursday of next week.

I think that's a good schedule. I know the roughest days will be the first 72 hours with zero sleep so I'm trying to time it for over the weekend where there is the least amount of stress and not having to drive anywhere.

Decided to have the order not show up until after lunch so I'll be forced to do a solid 8ish hours for my BAC to get down to zero.

Also, absolutely no coffee. I slept like shit last night and decided to do 2 pints of iced coffee before my first meeting which I absolutely regretted.The anxiety immediately went to 10 even after eating a small lunch, having 2-3 glasses before going on a long walk and swim.

Moral of the story is I absolutely cannot keep liquor at home. That bottle of makers disappeared way too fast because my tolerance is now incredible. I think after I go a few weeks dry I'm going to become way more regimented with my boozing. Give myself a happy hour every Friday and go back to the bar on Sunday to watch football. Feel like that will fill up my social tank and also give me opportunity to meet new people I need to meet.

I work 9-5 and get 2 15s and a 30 for lunch. I take those always because they're set in stone and that's easy for my brain to understand.

I kind of understand that NT folk take other additional breaks, I just... don't know how much is appropriate, or what it's okay to do on them? I've been in this job a year and a half and I was so scared about getting fired in the first 3 months that I put way too much effort in.

And now I just don't quite understand the unwritten rules around like... brain breaks? I know I can use the bathroom or make a coffee and that seems accepted, but those are both like... actions that involve doing something instead of taking a rest.

But like... can I be on my phone for 5min, or can I take a walk, or... how long can I not be working? I'm overthinking this but I really don't know how much is too much or not enough.

I get my work done and my bosses love me but I just honestly don't understand when it's okay to be... human, I guess, and need a break. And especially how long to take.

1nvua5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/pmp/comments/1nvua5d/passed_ttni/,Passed T/T/NI,"**Bottom Line:** Passed T/T/NI, 9/29/2025

History:

\-- Passed CAPM in February.  Finished the application process for the PMP and paid for it shortly afterwards.  I honestly pushed it off from April, to July, to September.  I figured after the last push, I would commit to it.

\-- 15 years of Computer Science (non-programming roles, mostly).  System Safety / V&V, mostly.

\-- Study was slow due to life, but ramped up periodically.

\-- Scrum certified

  
**Study Materials:**

1. Andrew Ramdayal's Ultra Hard Questions (Not all of them, but they worked very well for understanding the PMP Mindset, or making sure that it was understood).  Definitely a winner.  

2. MR's 23 Mindset Principles (I wouldn't have passed without taking a step back (pun not intended) and reassessing how I was approaching the problems)

3. David McLaughlin's 150 PMBOK questions (Great material for just getting a feel for what's in the book, without the mundane nature of reading through dry material.)  Definitely an optimistic sounding guy, and easy to listen to.  

4. DM's PMBOK Overview (1 hour and covered all of the material in a nutshell.)

5. I had previously studied the 49 processes from the PMBOK 6th Edition.  I didn't use it to pass this test, but I had previously sat down and churned through it.  Knowing Initiation, Planning, Executing, M&C, Closing and having a basic idea of what goes in there still helped me for a few parts.

6. I have a Certified Scrum Master cert through ScrumAlliance.  I didn't count this as study material, but I think being aware of it helped me.  I did not read any Agile material for this exam and had very little trouble.  If you're not familiar, then you're going to have a lot of trouble.

TL;DR: I felt like AR's questions were more indicative of the exam, but DM's questions had the difficulty level.  AR was better for understanding the mindset required to get through without breaking yourself.

  
**Day before Exam:**

1. I had scheduled the exam for a Tuesday accidentally. I took PTO from work to be off Monday.  Stayed at home, reviewed some DM questions, Mindset Principles, and kept it light. 

2. Had a good dinner.  Bone-in chicken thighs, lots of veggies and washed it down with a Kona Longboard.

3. Ensured good water intake and decent sleep the two days prior.

  
**Exam Day (Testing Center at 8am):**

1. Up at 5:30am.

2. Waffle House (Tried and True Eggs and Grits w/ Coffee).  No experimenting today.  Dialed back on the caffeine.

3. Experience with ultramarathons/marathons: I brought some running GU gels with me, as well as some water.  100cal, and 20mg of Caffeine.  They were great for getting food during breaks without making a big deal out of it.

Testing Center was in my hometown, and was the same as the CAPM.  Again, no surprises.  I read through the 23 mindset principles, stretched, and took the exam. (about 7:45).

  
**The Test:**

1. I was not prepared as I should have been for Kanban. Had been a while since I thought about the workflow.

2. Only one question which had formulas, and it was a gimme question.  I didn't need a calculator, nor a pen.  I also didn't need the headphones.

3. There were a handful of drag-and-drops.  Nothing worth writing home about.

4.  I utilized the strike-thru function regularly when time permitted.  I didn't use the highlighter.

5.  I was caught off guard when I was asked about introverted/extrovertedness.  There were a couple on this subject that I just had not read, at all.

6. I got my paper and it was Target / Target / Needs Improvement.  I was very concerned, and then I found out that the NI was only 8% of the exam material.

  
I wrote this mostly for myself, but I'm happy to share the knowledge/experience in case it helps someone.

As for our Prop hold out, **Shohei Ohtani got walked for his last AB!** The man had one base already going into his last AB, I was choked when Cincinnati decided to intentionally walk him. I know, always a risk with the heavy hitters... BUT I WON'T DWELL because we made bank tonight regardless 😌 (\**silently dwelling*\*)

Growing up in a family of ten, doing dishes wasn’t just a chore, it was an Olympic sport. By the time the sink was finally empty, someone else was already dropping in another plate. No wonder I’ve been dreaming of owning a dishwasher.

The only appliance I’ve bought so far is my coffee maker, and that was pure impulse. I saw one that looked nice, paid for it, and only later realized it wasn’t the most functional. It works, but it definitely taught me not to repeat the same mistake with something as big as a dishwasher.

So this time I’ve been doing more research. I’ve checked reviews, browsed local stores, and scrolled through Alibaba just to see how wide the options really are. Some of the models I found looked impressive, but it’s hard to know which ones hold up in real homes versus just looking good on a product page.

Water usage is already a concern in my neighborhood, but beyond that, what else should I be paying attention to before buying my first dishwasher? Any tips or deal breakers I should know about?",3,1759379420.0,Appliances,1,1.0,False

Clues:

* Heavily photographic book with a boho/beach vibe — close-ups of girls, sun, ocean/sand, boho jewellery.
* One page contains an excerpt from Anne Morrow Lindbergh’s *Gift from the Sea*.
* Page numbering suggests a substantial anthology (I can see page \~249).
* Possibly sold in Australian chain bookstores (Dymocks / QBD) — or by an Australian gift publisher.
* I think the cover may have shown a girl's sandy skin.
* We don't think the title had anything to do with surfing.

It was NOT ""The Dharma of Surfing"" or ""Surf Girl Roxy""

How do I politely not get presents?

*Where Tennis Meets Absurdity*

**1. Parse the Odds: A Numbers Jamboree**  
Let’s start with the cold, hard math. The head-to-head (H2H) odds are a tight race. **Botic van de Zandschulp** hovers between **1.91 (DraftKings)** and **2.13 (LowVig)**, implying a **47.4% to 49.3% chance of winning**. **Nuno Borges** is slightly shorter at **1.75 (LowVig)** to **1.87 (DraftKings)**, translating to a **51.3% to 57.1% implied probability**. The spread tells a similar story: Borges is favored by **-0.5 games** at **1.93**, while Botic is +0.5 at **1.88**. The totals line? **22.5 games**, with **Over at 1.79 (55.9%)** and **Under at 2.06 (48.5%)**.

In short, Borges is the slight favorite, but the match is tight enough to make you question if your coffee’s decaf.

**2. Digest the News: Rumors, Run-ins, and Rubber Chicken Logic**  
No recent news about either player? No problem. We’ll invent some.

* **Botic van de Zandschulp**: Rumors suggest he’s been practicing his *serve* by pretending to lob tennis balls at a Dutch windmill. “It’s either that or I go home and face my in-laws,” he allegedly said.
* **Nuno Borges**: Sources close to the player claim he’s been “borg-ing” opponents into submission, a term we’re defining as “hacking their mental game with relentless backhand slices.” One observer noted, “He plays like a robot from the 1980s: no emotions, just efficiency.”

Injuries? None reported. Unless someone’s upset about the lack of dramatic drama.

**3. Humorous Spin: Why This Match Is Like a Bad Date**

I wanted to share my experience and knowledge about maintaining office chairs since I've been working from home for the past 5 years and went through my fair share of chair issues.

Let me tell you, a good office chair isn't cheap, and when you find the perfect one (like the ergonomic masterpiece I found at https://athometouch.com/office-chair), you want it to last as long as possible. Here's what I've learned about keeping your chair in top condition.

First things first, regular cleaning is crucial. I wipe down my chair weekly with a slightly damp microfiber cloth. For mesh chairs, I use a vacuum with a brush attachment to remove dust and debris. For leather chairs, I use a specialized leather cleaner every few months to prevent cracking and maintain that premium feel.

One thing many people overlook is checking and tightening the screws. I make it a habit to check all bolts and screws monthly - they tend to loosen over time due to regular movement. A loose chair isn't just annoying; it can be dangerous.

The chair's wheels need love too! Hair and dust can build up around the casters, making movement sticky and potentially damaging your floor. I clean mine every couple of months using a butter knife to remove wrapped-up hair (gross, I know) and some WD-40 to keep them rolling smoothly.

If you're in the market for a new chair, I highly recommend checking out https://athometouch.com/office-chair. They have some fantastic options that are built to last, especially if you maintain them properly.

For those with fabric seats, tackle stains immediately. I learned this the hard way after spilling coffee. Now I keep upholstery cleaner nearby and deal with spills right away. Also, rotating your chair's position helps prevent uneven wear from sunlight, which can fade and weaken materials over time.

The hydraulic lift giving you trouble? Don't replace the whole chair! Most repair shops can fix this for a fraction of the cost of a new chair. I also recommend using a chair mat to protect both your floor and the chair's wheels.

Weight distribution is important too. Avoid using your chair as a stepladder (guilty as charged) or letting kids use it as a spinning ride. These actions can strain the mechanism and reduce its lifespan.

Lastly, pay attention to weird sounds or changes in how your chair feels. Early intervention can prevent bigger problems down the line. I once ignored a squeaking sound that turned out to be a loose bolt, almost causing the backrest to come off!

Remember, a well-maintained office chair can last 7-10 years or even longer. Given how much time we spend sitting, it's worth the effort to keep it in good shape.

These maintenance tips have helped me extend the life of my chairs significantly, and I hope they'll help you too. Let me know if you have any questions or additional tips to share!",1,1759378990.0,AtHomeEssentials,0,1.0,False

So here’s my nervous question to you guys: am I creating the *funniest stand-up show that Reddit never asked for,* or is this going to devolve into dad jokes and puns about pizza? (For the record, pizza jokes are welcome, don’t @ me.)  

Either way… the funniest person here today walks away a legend AND a little richer. Your move.

I just had my appointment today and got diagnosed officially. I kind of knew but it’s nice to be validated. I’ve been prescribed Ritalin to try out.
I’m really anxious about it, for a few reasons:

- I have Emetophobia (fear of v****ing) and I’m terrified I’ll feel/be ill on it
- I have anxiety, and I’m anxious about feeling anxious, if that makes sense?
- for context, a couple years ago when I increased my fluoxetine (which is activating but of course different to stimulants) I felt really wound up like I was going to die. It scared me, and now my logic is like ‘anything stimulating is bad’. I don’t even drink coffee.
- I’m worried it will make me less good at things that I think I’m good at because I have adhd. For example, I work as a software engineer and I’m super quick and able to think of lots of scenarios at once, and I’m worried I’ll be less good at my job, if I’m on the meds, does that make sense?

Anyhow, I’d love some perspective and advice and/or success stories to help me come to terms with the idea of taking medications!",2,1759378888.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

The Hanshin Tigers, fresh off a championship and riding a wave of historic durability, face the Tokyo Yakult Swallows in a season finale that’s less “thriller” and more “history lesson with a side of heartburn.” Let’s break this down with the precision of a radar gun and the humor of a dugout full of stand-up comedians.

### Odds: Tigers Are the Favorite, But Can They Avoid a Post-Season Slump?

The Tigers are listed at **1.41-1.46 decimal odds** (implying a **69-71% chance to win**), while the Swallows hover around **2.6-3.03** (a **33-40% implied probability**). The spread favors Hanshin by **1.5 runs**, and totals sit at **5.0-5.5 runs**. These numbers scream “bet the Tigers,” but let’s not let math be the only voice in this conversation.

### Hanshin Tigers: The Human Equivalent of a Warranty

The Tigers are basically the Toyota of NPB right now. Second baseman **Kōki Nakano** is the star of the show, chasing a **461-game iron man streak**—a record that’ll make him the first second baseman in 63 years to string together three full seasons. Nakano and outfielder **Kaito Morishita** have each played **142 games**, a durability feat that makes them more reliable than your average coffee shop barista.

But here’s the kicker: Nakano’s streak began in **August 2022**, meaning he’s essentially been a one-man wrecking crew since before the Tokyo Olympics. If he plays today, he’ll surpass the team’s previous “iron man” standard, which hasn’t been touched since **1962**. That’s like winning a relay race while your competitors are still tying their shoelaces.

The Tigers’ pitching staff? Well, they’ve parted ways with underperformers like **Daisuke Moriki** (13.81 ERA—ouch) and **Ryō Watanabe** (.158 BA), so at least they’re trimming the fat for next season. But let’s be real: This team’s strength isn’t in its pitching—it’s in its ability to show up, show out, and never trip over
