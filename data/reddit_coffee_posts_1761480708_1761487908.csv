Illinois and Iowa consistently rank first and second.

The top 10 beef-producing states are Texas, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Colorado, Oklahoma, Missouri, Montana, South Dakota, and Florida.

If Dan Osborn can't make hay over the way Trump has mishandled Nebraska's beef and soy industry, I don't think anybody could. Likewise, Iowa has an open senate seat, and this should be such a layup of an issue for whoever runs there. Same goes for whoever the Democrats get in Texas against Cornyn / Paxton. Same goes for Sherrod Brown in Ohio. I don't know who Democrats might have in Arkansas, South Dakota, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Montana, but those should all be competitive races given the circumstances.

Are voters who work in / around / or otherwise rely on farm-ag dollars (the waitress at the coffee shop where the farmers meet or whatever other trope you can think of), gettable for Democratic, or Osborn-style Independent candidates? Will they be so disillusioned as to not show up to support Republican Senate / House candidates?

Will Republican candidates go with ""Trump is just getting bad advice""? Or, ""The Deep State goes deeper than we ever thought possible""?

1ogljof,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIToolTesting/comments/1ogljof/twaingpt_review_overhyped_ai_tool/,TwainGPT Review: Overhyped AI Tool,"Alright y’all… I’ve been on the eternal quest to make AI writing sound *actually human*. Between essays, freelance gigs, and side projects, I use ChatGPT a ton — but every time I ran my text through an AI detector, it lit up like a Christmas tree 🎄.

That’s when I stumbled across **TwainGPT**. I saw a few posts calling it one of the best tools to *humanize AI writing*, so I figured I’d give it a try. Here’s my honest **TwainGPT review** after testing it myself — and whether I think **TwainGPT is legit** or just hype.

# 💭 Why I Tried TwainGPT in the First Place

I wanted something that could **humanize AI text undetectably** — quick, smooth, and accurate. TwainGPT looked promising: clean website, bold claims, and reviews that said it could “make any AI writing 100% human.”

So I tested it on a few ChatGPT essays and blog posts. I really wanted it to be “the one.”

# ⚙️ My Actual Experience Using TwainGPT

TwainGPT’s interface is nice and simple — paste your text, hit *Humanize*, and boom 💥 it spits out a rewritten version. My first impression? Not bad. It definitely made the writing flow a little better and fixed a few robotic phrases.

But then I ran the results through **GPTZero**, [**Originality.ai**](http://Originality.ai), and **Sapling**... and yeah, it still got flagged 🚨. Some sentences passed, others didn’t. The biggest issue was consistency — one output would sound super natural, the next would read like a weird AI trying too hard to be “quirky.”

Also, it occasionally changed the meaning of my sentences or added random filler words. It felt less like “humanizing” and more like “rephrasing with personality.” For something that costs what it does, I expected a bit more reliability.

# 🔥 What Happened When I Switched to [Grubby.ai](http://Grubby.ai)

After getting tired of hit-or-miss results, I started checking out alternatives and found[ ](https://grubby.ai)Grubby AI — a tool people on Reddit kept recommending for making AI writing *completely undetectable*.

I dropped the *same exact* text into [Grubby.ai](http://Grubby.ai), and the difference was night and day 🌙. The output sounded smooth, natural, and totally human — like something I could’ve written myself after two cups of coffee ☕.

Then came the real test: I ran it through *every* major detector again… **zero AI flags**. Not even one. [Grubby.ai](http://Grubby.ai) actually delivered on what TwainGPT promised — it didn’t just rewrite my text, it *humanized* it in a believable, consistent way.

If you’re searching things like *“humanize AI content”*, *“humanize ChatGPT text”*, or *“AI to humanize text”*, [Grubby.ai](http://Grubby.ai) is hands down the best **AI bypass tool** I’ve used.

# 🧩 Final Thoughts

So, **is TwainGPT legit?** Sort of. It works okay for quick paraphrasing, but it’s not reliable if your goal is to make AI text undetectable. It feels more like a stylistic rewriter than a true humanizer.

Meanwhile, [**Grubby.ai**](http://Grubby.ai) actually *gets it right* ✅. It keeps your tone, passes all detectors, and makes AI writing sound authentically human every single time.

If you’re serious about writing that *passes as human*, don’t waste time on tools that half-deliver. [Grubby.ai](http://Grubby.ai) is where it’s at 👑.

# TL;DR:

Tried **TwainGPT** — it sorta worked, but my text still got flagged and lost my original tone. Switched to [**Grubby.ai**](http://Grubby.ai), and now everything I write passes every AI detector with ease. If you want to **humanize AI text undetectably**, go with [Grubby.ai](http://Grubby.ai) 💯.

I'm 34 years old MtF, and I've been on hormones for about a year and a half now, and like most people, I am currently navigating a lot of emotional and social changes. One of the hardest parts has been the isolation—I don’t have any transgender friends, and I’m really hoping to find people I can connect with, talk to, and just exist around without feeling alone. Ive come out to nearly everyone that matters at work and at home. Just not that jump to using my name, dressing and acting like I want and should.

I live in a remote-ish area, about an hour’s drive from Bristol, and there aren’t many local LGBT+ groups near me or people/places that give off any form of energy like that. That makes the idea of socially transitioning feel scary and isolating. I do drive and have a car, but even then, im not exactly extroverted, so it’s hard to just feel like I can insert myself into a community if that makes sense.

I’m a bit of a nerd—I play Magic: The Gathering (commander), I have an unhealthy obsession with Warhammer (both 40k and Horus Heresy), and I’m a PC gamer. I’d love to find people who share those interests, but honestly, I’d be happy just finding likeminded peopleto talk to and maybe build some friendships with.

If you know of any active communities, I’d be really grateful for any suggestions. Or just people to chat with, grab coffee or whatever adults do in social situations, I’d love that too. Or, even a different reddit that would be more appropriate for this sort of question?

I haven't posted in a really long time as I've grown Into a bit of a lurker, but I was hit with the sudden want to post so here I am!! 

I wanted to share a bit about my experience as a new  Domme with my first proper long-term sub, or at least the start of our dynamic. I’ve had a few short-term arrangements before, some conversations, maybe a session or two. But nothing that lasted more than a week. This one has been going for over a month now, and it’s honestly been such a rewarding experience for both myself and hopefully him too.

He actually approached me first here on Reddit after spending a lot of time reading through my posts and profile. From the start, he stood out against the other copy paste begging in my dms, he was respectful, self-aware, and genuinely interested in building something. We spent our first week just talking, asking questions, setting boundaries, and making sure we were actually a good fit before we jumped into anything. That foundation of communication made all the difference. We spoke about how he was more than happy for me to have other subs, and for a while I did look but no sub quite met the expectations he has given me over these weeks, I'm not saying I'm completely finished looking, but it's going to take a very special sub like him to have me even considering it.

In 100% honesty, our dynamic isn’t overly kinky, it’s more focused on structure, motivation, and bettering his life. I set him tasks like cooking proper meals instead of ordering takeout, sticking to a gym routine, keeping to a proper sleep schedule, cleaning up ect. Watching him build those habits has been really satisfying, and I’ve realised how much I enjoy the nurturing, guiding side of domination.

Outside of that, we talk like friends most of the time. He tells me about work interview drama, I tell him about my uni classes, and we’ll chat about the books we’re reading since that’s something we both love. It’s casual and easy, and it’s made the whole dynamic feel comfortable and natural.

Unfortunately about a month in, life threw a wrench in when things were going so well, I caught COVID and ended up really sick (I have a heart condition, and it landed me in the hospital for a bit.) He knew I was unwell but not how serious it had gotten. Still, he was incredibly patient and never pressured me, which meant a lot. When I got better, we took some time to talk about what worked and what didn’t, and restructured a few things. It honestly made our connection even stronger.

He sends rather often, not because I tell him to, but just whenever he feels like it. Sometimes it’s a “pick me up” if I’ve had a rough day, sometimes a little coffee send, but mostly it’s just because he wants to. His budget comes from what he would normally waste on takeout or junk food, so we both like to think the money is better in my hands than his. And I tend to take myself on shopping sprees or such as next month, book a city break with friends.

If there’s one thing I believe I’ve learned, it’s that being a Domme doesn’t have to mean being harsh or constantly in control, not that I see anything wrong with it. It can be soft and supportive while still being powerful. This experience has shown me how fulfilling findom can be when it’s built on communication and genuine care and I can't wait to see how we continue.

Building an AI for real estate agents wasn't easy. I realized that the AI didn't sound human at first. It was like the early days when I became an agent—everything felt scripted, not real.

One night, I sat there with my coffee, staring at the code. I thought, ""How do I make this work for agents?"" The answer hit me. Real estate is all about real conversations, not scripted ones. Like when I started, agents needed real talks to connect with clients.

So, I changed our AI. We added real-life scenarios from listing presentations to tricky buyer questions. We taught it to listen and respond like a seasoned pro.

The shift worked. Agents said the AI felt like a real partner, not just a tool. It wasn't about fancy tech; it was about creating real conversations that made agents confident and clear.

The takeaway? Blending tech with real-world talks is key. When agents meet clients, authentic conversations are what truly make a difference.

TL;DR: Building an AI for real estate agents taught me that real, authentic conversations are key. Not scripts. 

Discussion Question: Have you ever used tech that sounded just like you? How did it change your work?

---

**🎯 Goal:** Great coffee without breaking the bank

**❌ What NOT to do:**

1. **Hario V60 Dripper** - $15
2. **Timemore C2 Hand Grinder** - $70
3. **Coffee Scale** - $25
4. **Gooseneck Kettle** - $35

**Why it works:**
- Grinder is solid (not amazing, but consistent)
- V60 is beginner friendly
- Makes 90% as good as $500 setups
- Zero maintenance

**Who this is for:** 
Anyone who wants excellent filter coffee without complexity.

---

## **OPTION B: Manual Espresso ($260 - slight stretch)**

**What to buy:**
1. **1Zpresso JXPro Hand Grinder** - $160
2. **Flair Neo Manual Espresso** - $90
3. **Basic Scale** - $15

**Why it works:**
- Grinder is espresso capable (crucial)
- Flair makes legit espresso shots
- No electricity needed
- Portable

**Downside:** 
Hand grinding 18g takes 60-90 seconds (workout included).

**Who this is for:**
Espresso lovers willing to trade convenience for quality.

---

## **OPTION C: The Lazy Route ($95)**

**What to buy:**
1. **AeroPress** - $35
2. **Hario Mini Mill** - $40

**Why it works:**
- Makes coffee comparable to $300 machines
- 2-minute brew time
- Nearly impossible to mess up
- Super forgiving

**Who this is for:**

---

**❗ Universal Rules (ANY Budget):**

1. **Spend 40-50% on grinder** (most important)
2. **Fresh beans only** (local roaster or online)
3. **Don't skimp on scale** (precision matters)

---

**Real Talk:**

I've used all three setups. The $145 pour-over beats my friend's $400 Breville setup because:
- Better grinder
- Fresher beans
- Proper technique

Gear helps. Technique + fresh beans matter MORE.

The whole concept came from those doodles we used to draw on the edges of our school notebooks — band names, quotes, random sketches, everything that once (and still) shaped who I am.  
Once I started, I ran out of space way too fast 🙂.

I had one rule: only include things that inspire me — in one way or another, something positive. So yeah, quite a few favorite bands and lyrics didn’t make it. At least not *on this one*. But since I love this kind of creative chaos, they’ll find a home somewhere else.

Of course, these are the bands that influenced me. Some directly — The Prodigy, 2 Brothers on the 4th Floor (their lyrics are crazy inspiring, and DesRay’s voice? Love it). Others show up more as little nods or references.

**Dance Away → Roxette**  
I’m still in love with Marie Fredriksson’s voice, and Per Gessle is one of those rare musicians who can fit more good ideas into one song than most do in an entire album.

**Black No. 1 → Type O Negative**  
Peter Steele — the man, the music, the attitude — pure layers of brilliance.

**3DOM.L.F → Believe in Freedom, Love and Fortune**  
(A DJ Bobo thing, by the way.) The “3” also brings in the *Zombieland* crew in spirit — Little Rock, Nevada, Wichita, and Columbus.

**Let Me B 3 → 2 Brothers again**  
Had to highlight that one. On one of the connectors, I also wrote *Keep Your Dreams Alive*, though it’s probably too tiny to see.

**Alive →** from *Madden Alive*, but even more that moment in *Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency*.  
It’s pure freedom, soul, happiness — life. And yeah, Douglas Adams.  
Also, Drummer Girl, Dirk, Todd, the Twins… and hopefully Bart’s story turns out okay too.  
Reminder to self: imagination, fantasy — build my own *Wendimoore.*

**Turn Up The Power → N-Trance**  
My favorite track of theirs. At first I just wrote “tuurnn” next to the volume knob, then this title came to mind, and I squeezed it in — just like we used to cram doodles into notebook margins.

**Hurricane →** because of my old saying:  
*Nothing happens with the hurricane — the hurricane happens.*  
Also a little nod to the *Chew Lips* and *Theory of a Deadman* tracks of the same name.

**Good Vibrations →** had to be here anyway, but this one’s a bonus: Marky Mark & Loleatta Holloway.  
That song’s energy, Mark’s wild teenage years, his early work — all of it inspires me.  
And while we’re at it…

**P.I.J M.M → Prince Ital Joe & Marky Mark**  
Their *United* album. Massive favorite — the message, the feeling, the vibe.  
*I wanna see more happy people!*

**GBGTHBTBBGE → Good Boys Go to Heaven, But the Bad Boys Go Everywhere**  
When it comes to soul-defining music, there has to be Meat Loaf and *Bat Out of Hell.*  
(*Rock’n’Roll Dreams Come Through* would’ve been too many “dreams” — and this quote just fits.)

**Fire → Scooter (HP Baxxter’s voice, of course)**  
The mosh pits at Tabacco (that old rough disco in Pécs), guitar jamming in the square, shouting, energy.  
And obviously — the best element!

**Out of Space → The Prodigy**  
A small pun under “Space”, but also one of their defining songs for me.  
I can almost hear Dune’s “I was sent to outer space,” and it sums up my love for rave.  
(*Hardcore Feelings* / *Can’t Stop Raving* didn’t fit anymore 😅.)

**Dreams Can Come True →** basically the slogan of the ’90s. I used to write it everywhere, and I meant it.  
Still haven’t outgrown it — and honestly, “growing up” was never my strong suit 🙂.  
It also ties into *Let the Dream Come True* (DJ Bobo) and *Rock’n’Roll Dreams Come True.*

**? →** My personal symbol, in memory of *Indian Larry.*  
Not a musician, but one of the most inspiring people I’ve ever heard about.  
I totally get his question mark.

# Random Words & Reminders

Things I used to scribble everywhere, now made their way here — sometimes with a twist:

* **Free** — doesn’t need explaining, but I shouldn’t forget it either.
* **NRG** — same energy.
* **Music** — the explanation itself.
* **Never Give Up** — cliché, sure, but sometimes I needed the reminder.
* **X-plorer 4ever** — probably my most defining trait. I want to see, do, and experience everything.
* **Unbordered** — took a while to find. Wanted something that says “I don’t fit in boxes,” kind of like *out of the box.* I tried *unboxable*, *borderless*, but this one felt right.
* **Chaos is good** — because it is. And Kevin Flynn was right.
* **DST** — as in *distortion.* Every guitarist knows. I just love dirty creativity.
* **OWER** — one of my many names (yes, with a W on purpose). I use it less professionally now, too many puns (*overload*, *overclass*...). Still, I added a tiny “-drive,” because if it’s worth doing, it’s worth overdoing.

# And of course, the coder side couldn’t stay out of it:

* `404 limits not found`
* `ALT + CTRL + Faith`
* `coffee.exe`

Plus a few classic notebook doodles:  
Planets and stars next to *Space*, a tic-tac-toe at the top (because every notebook had one), a smiley face, upward arrows, musical notes, rhythm pattern (BD-SD-BD-HH-BD), my own sign, Morse code, lines, random scratches… the works.

That’s about all that fit — for now.  
I’ve still got room on the bottom of the shield, just need to figure out the lacquer — brush smears the paint, and I don’t want to spray near the electronics. Maybe next round.

Anyway… I’ve already got enough ideas for another keyboard

I am an attractive fat dude. If you're looking for some twink im not your guy. I dress like an alt dude. I have long hair and tattoos and piercings. My septum is stretched to a 2g. I've got a good job managing a coffee shop. I live alone in an apartment downtown. I have a 3 legged dog named Odin and 2 plants. Those are my stats now let's get personal.

I am looking for a partner because it's safer to not be alone, not that I am alone, I have loads of friends but id like to live with someone and start looking forward to the future. My hobbies include but are not limited to video games, camping, fishing, ttrpgs, mtg, playing guitar and singing poorly, listening to philosophy audio books and painting and collecting Warhammer 40k (sororitas with custom cat ear helmets for the dudes that read this). I'm politically progressive but id say im not very cringe about it. I am anti this current administration.

My favorite video games are the soulsborne games. I've got at least 3000 hours between them all. I adore them. I will say off the bat that I game a lot if this is a hobby we share it'd be best. I will play anything with you though. Music wise im into Midwest emo, hard-core, death core, shoegaze, and gloomcore. I really like sad music and want to make music like the band take care. I'm a bit of a film snob cinephile and would love to toss favs at eachother.

We can talk on here then move to discord or insta. Thank you for reading this far and even if you dont message me you should remember that you are special and if nobody thinks about you today, I am. Peace.",1,1761487329.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1oglcsz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DFS_Sports/comments/1oglcsz/week_8_nfl_dfs_value_sun_main/,📊 Week 8 | NFL DFS Value | Sun Main,"Welcome back, Week 8 is here! For anyone new, every week I take Vegas lines and odds and convert them into projected fantasy points. Then I compare those projections against DraftKings, FanDuel and OwnersBox salaries to calculate a value score. This helps highlight who's overpriced and who’s underpriced.

These plays tend to be chalky/high ownership, so I typically use them for double-ups, but you’re free to use the info however you want.

⚠️ Disclaimer

* No such thing as a lock — use at your own risk.
* Not betting advice — just my process and what works for me.
* I post for free. Use it, fade it, roast it — up to you.

🔑 Core Plays

I run an optimizer for every slate to identify the strongest builds. Since sharing full lineups is against T&C (and would just have everyone running the same thing anyway), here are a few core plays the optimizer is high on:

* QB: TBD
* RB: TBD
* WR: TBD
* TE: TBD
* DST: TBD

💸 Tip Jar (Optional)

If this saves you time and fattens your bankroll → Tip the nerd🤓🧪

* CashApp: $FirePropsEV
* Buy Me A Coffee: FirePropsEV

Full filterable table with DraftKings, FanDuel and OwnersBox can be found in my FREE Substack. Hope you enjoy, good luck!

1oglarr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1oglarr/travelling_to_powai/,Travelling to Powai,"Hello! I am planning to travel to Powai next year.

Background: I am a Filipina, single, late 30s. I am not looking for a date (romantic-wise) but I have been so intrigued by Powai as I had former colleagues who told me that Powai is very close to the urban living we have here in Manila.

My concern is that my health conditions limit the food I'm allowed to eat. I am not vegan, but I enjoy vegetables so much. However I am not allowed to eat spicy food because of my hyperacidity and sweets because of my diabetes. I have been checking out some restaurants online and some of my contacts have told me that my options would be Subway, Starbucks and Aromas.

Also, since I am quite restricted because of health conditions, I would like to remain in Powai. Do you have any recommendations on where to go? I am a history buff and a city girl. I also enjoy sipping coffee in a quaint cafe, observing people and breathing in the cultures of people around me.

One more question, if you may: I saw the sample visa application online that I need an Indian contact and his/her mobile number for the tourist visa. Since I really dont know anyone who's currently residing in Powai (my contacts are all in Manila) I may not be able to fill out this blank. Is the Indian contact necessary for tourist visa application?

Thank you so much and looking forward to engaging with you!",2,1761487102.0,india,1,1.0,False

To everyone who waves, honks nicely, drops off snacks, or just smiles — you’re the real MVPs. You make long, dusty days so much better (even if my wrist might fall off from waving back).

To the others — the ones who lay on the horn, flip us off, call us names, or fly past the other vehicles like it’s the Indy 500 (looking at you, green Toyota guy, you know that’s illegal right?) — please remember: we’re not out here to ruin your day. We’re out here so everyone gets home safe. No, we can’t make traffic go faster. No, we’re not on a coffee break. And no, yelling at us won’t change a thing — except maybe your blood pressure.

So please, slow down, be patient, and remember — we shouldn’t have to risk our life to keep yours safe.

Sincerely,Miss Just Doing Her Job

It began with a bake sale to raise funds for Palestine, became a campaign of harassment and ended with transferring my child to another primary. I went through 18 months of hell

https://preview.redd.it/plrswhn6pgxf1.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=887bccaa80380c21f0e7b8c8170cb90fd7ead18f

As I turned into the quiet residential street near my home in east London, I heard a car revving behind me, followed by a shout. The voice was female and shrill. It sounded like: “Free Palestine!” I swung around, confused. It was a sunny Monday afternoon in September 2024, and I wasn’t anywhere near a march. Neither was I carrying an Israeli flag, nor wearing any visible Jewish symbols. I was just a mum, who happens to be Jewish, on my way to pick up my then nine-year-old daughter from her state primary school.

The shout came again, louder, angrier. “Free Palestine!” This time the refrain was unmistakable. I realised the voice was coming from a red car, one I recognised. It belonged to a woman who had been conducting a campaign of harassment against me – most of it passive aggressive – for almost a year by then. There she sat, smirking, as her teenage daughter leaned out of the rolled down car window and abused me.

Fight or flight is a curious phenomenon. You never know how you’ll respond to an attack until the moment it occurs. Perhaps I should have ignored her, walked away, but something drove me to fight. I stopped dead in my tracks, pulled out my phone and began to film. “What did you say?” I shouted back. “Are you talking to me?”

“Yes! Free Palestine! Free, free Palestine, geddit?”

Oh, I got it. As most Jews recognise, those words have a meaning far beyond the literal. They have become words of violence, an existential threat. And conversely, they have also become utterly meaningless. How, exactly, I wondered, momentarily, did she expect me to free Palestine while I did the after-school pick-up?

A man was now walking up the street behind me. “He wants to free Palestine too, don’t you?” shrieked the girl, as he passed me. “Everyone wants to free Palestine!” The man seemed surprised, but concurred. “Yes, free Palestine.”

I felt trapped. And then an adrenaline surge – more of that fight-or-flight response – made me do something that in retrospect seems quite ridiculous: I began to sing “Am Yisrael Chai” while at the same time dancing the Hora – a physical act of Jewish defiance that erupted from me instinctively. They tried to kill us, we survived, we dance. At the end, and I’m not proud of this (not least because they were now filming me too), I gave them a two-finger salute and a couple of choice words of my best Anglo-Saxon. Afterwards, I shook for hours.

Like thousands of parents all over the UK, I am currently in the process of applying for secondary schools, filling out an online form that will determine my daughter’s future. It’s stressful for all Jewish parents, but, for my family, that stress is amplified by the numerous examples of antisemitism that we have endured since October 7.

When we moved here, five years ago – yards from one end of Cable Street – I was fully aware that I would be living in a majority Bangladeshi Muslim area. I was not concerned. I have Muslim friends and have always believed in multiculturalism, in diversity. And besides, the primary school we chose had a wonderful, inspirational Ashkenazi Jewish headteacher known for fostering cross-community relations.

As the only Jewish child at the school – indeed, reportedly the only Jewish child ever to have gone there – our daughter was regarded as a curiosity by some of the other children. A few refused to believe she was Jewish, insisting that she must be Christian. But there were no real issues. We even took in apples and honey for her class to enjoy at Rosh Hashanah.

That all changed on October 7, 2023. My problems began with a parents’ WhatsApp group discussion over a bake sale to raise money for Palestine. I objected to the anti-Israel rhetoric in the thread, pointing out that the group was for school matters, not politics, and that some of the messages upset me. I explained that my cousin’s wife had been murdered at Kibbutz Kfar Aza on October 7. I asked for understanding.

If anything, my revelation seemed to inflame them more. For the first time I understood that some have absolutely no compassion for dead Israelis or those who mourn them. Palestine flag emojis began appearing in the WhatsApp names in the group, mirroring the flags that had sprung up on every lamppost in the area. Someone removed my admin status. Micro-aggressions, that made me feel I was no longer welcome.

Yes, I had been naive. I had not realised just how anti-Israel the tight-knit, religious local community was. I wasn’t aware that Bangladesh not only refuses to recognise Israel, but also bans its citizens from travelling there and doesn’t allow those with Israeli passports to enter. To some brought up in this culture, Zionism is evil. And now that I had revealed myself as a Zionist, I had become a non-person, a legitimate target.

The headteacher had my back. She said that if a bake sale went ahead, the proceeds had to be split equally between charities that supported both Palestinian and Israeli children. But the parents organising the sale rejected that. They said they would not allow a single penny to go to Israel – in fact, they’d rather the bake sale did not go ahead at all. I couldn’t help thinking of the biblical judgment of King Solomon. These parents chose to tear apart their metaphorical baby instead of letting it live by helping Israeli children. They cared far less about fundraising for Palestine than they did about hating Israel.

https://preview.redd.it/9xw80h08pgxf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=9411cee0af68cccaee50e16ad0bf615abfc720a3

Unsurprisingly, after the cancellation of the bake sale, the antisemitism increased.

A few parents discussed how “one parent” – clearly me – had “a lot of influence” over the headteacher. A blatant antisemitic trope. People began googling my articles online and attempting to use their content to smear me. Eventually, I wrote a message directly calling out the antisemitism, and asking for it to stop. My reward was to be immediately kicked out of the group – a group that I had, incidentally, co-founded. Afterwards, a parent contacted me, privately, to say that I was right: the group was antisemitic. But she hadn’t wanted to wade in. Everyone else stayed silent, both publicly and privately. I was on my own.

Soon, the hostility began to infect my personal social media. My television appearances about matters entirely unrelated to the Middle East were commented on by anonymous accounts, with irrelevant details that could only be known about by these parents – the fact my daughter had been late for school, for example. They were clearly watching me. By now, I was publicly campaigning against the Palestine flags and, perhaps foolishly, stickering lampposts with anti-Hamas stickers. Unbeknown to me, one of the mothers lived in a flat overlooking one of these lampposts. She secretly filmed me, put the footage on X and called on others to doxx me. As the harassment increased, I found myself on first-name terms with the reporting team at the CST.

One of the most shocking incidents occurred in a parents’ coffee morning. I had the misfortune to find myself sitting opposite three of my most vocal haters, who travelled in a pack. At one point, I took my phone out of my handbag to check my work messages. As I held it up to my face, the nastiest of these mothers screamed at me across the room: “Stop taking photos of us!” When, shocked, I proclaimed my innocence, she accused me of being a liar and said, ‘It’s the sort of thing people like YOU do.” (Of course, it was they who had taken photos of me. What is it they say, every accusation is a confession?) To his credit, the deputy head berated her, saying such behaviour would not be tolerated. The coffee mornings were suspended indefinitely.

Word spread and, worse, my daughter began to be targeted. Older boys started coming up to her in the corridors or playground, demanding to know whether she supported Israel or Palestine, as if the war were a football match. Wise beyond her years, she replied only that she supported peace. But this wasn’t enough. “Tell your dad you support Palestine,” one boy commanded, revealingly, his paternalistic upbringing blinding him to the fact that it was perhaps her Jewish mother, rather than her non-Jewish father, who might be hurt by this. After school, my daughter would recount the details of every incident. Each one only made her Jewish identity stronger.

In response, the headteacher kindly gave me her personal number and said that if my daughter was ever upset, she could call her at any time, day or night, to have a chat. It was comforting for my daughter to know that she wasn’t alone, that someone else understood and was protecting her.

https://preview.redd.it/1374h779pgxf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a985d43c3439286bd04e2addca7d36cc90ffe1c

And then, suddenly and tragically, in the spring of 2024, the wonderful headteacher died. An academy trust swooped in to take over the school, changing everything from the start time to the curriculum to the decor, and one by one the lovely teachers left. All our support structures vanished.

The harassment continued. The mother who had filmed me put up signs in her window, with declarations like, “One Holocaust does not justify another.” The lamppost outside was festooned with “Boycott Israel Apartheid” stickers. If I removed them, they reappeared the following day.

Meanwhile, at school, even supply teachers and teaching assistants were getting in on the act. When one noticed my daughter staring at her Palestine flag bracelet (illegal in state schools), she asked my daughter why she didn’t support Palestine, and then demanded that she should. Another, in a PHSE lesson about dealing with racism – I kid you not – didn’t stop some of the boys chanting “Free Palestine” and “From the River to the Sea” and actually stated, “I love Palestine.” I went straight to the headteacher to complain, and the teacher denied it. Fortunately, other children backed up my daughter’s account. I was told neither of these teachers would be allowed back. That they had thought it was appropriate to behave like this at all speaks volumes about the state of education and teacher training in the UK.

But in September 2024, when I reported the red car incident to the school, I was met with indifference. “It didn’t happen on school premises,” I was told, “so there’s nothing we can do. Go to the police if you want to. If you want, you can bring your daughter at a different time from all the other parents.” I refused. Why should we, as the victims, be singled out even more?

I did go to the police. And after weeks of chasing, they finally issued the perpetrator with a verbal warning for harassment. It didn’t quite meet the threshold for a hate crime, they said, because I couldn’t prove I was being targeted for being Jewish. That felt a little like gaslighting. The CST told me I could pursue it, but I no longer had the heart. Remember, I still had to walk past this woman’s home every day, and my daughter was at the same school as one of her children. I didn’t want to make things even worse.

Throughout this period, I was in a perpetual state of anxiety. Jumpy, with frequent palpitations. If I came home alone at night, I glanced over my shoulder. But because I was outwardly defiant, and didn’t look like the cowering victim my bullies wanted me to be, they mocked my expressions of fear – both personal and for Jews in general – on social media. I was “playing the victim, like Jews always do”.

>

For me, the final straw wasn’t another antisemitic incident. It was when one of the women who was harassing me – the one who had screamed in the coffee morning – was elected as a parent governor. It seemed she was being rewarded for her behaviour, and it told me loudly and clearly that we – as Jews – did not count.

At the start of the summer term, my partner and I transferred our daughter to the local Church of England school, which is much more diverse, and where antisemitism and political symbols aren’t tolerated. She is happy and settled, the school pick-up and drop-off are stress-free, and while I’m not delighted that she can now recite the Lord’s Prayer by heart, it is a far better environment for her. It strikes me that something has gone deeply wrong in the system if Christian faith schools now protect and respect Jewish children better than secular state schools do.

But the refuge is temporary. Now we have to apply for secondary schools. Locally, we face a choice between academically poor schools with social problems or good ones, where our daughter will once again be the only Jewish child in a class of mainly Bangladeshi Muslim children. She has already said that, if she feels it’s necessary, she won’t tell anyone she’s Jewish, and that is heartbreaking to hear.

We are trying to move, but practical and financial constraints make it a tricky and potentially long process, with no idea where we’ll end up. We’re stymied by a catchment system that does not allow us to apply for decent state schools outside our current area, and we can’t afford the private sector. We’d love our daughter to go to a Jewish school, but the closest is well over an hour and two Tube journeys away – if we can even get our daughter in.

When we went to the JCoSS open day, our daughter was amazed to see how many other girls there had curly hair just like hers. For the first time, she felt she belonged. I dream of winning the lottery and buying a nice flat in north London. In the meantime, my mother has provisionally agreed that if she gets into a Jewish school, our daughter could live with her during the week, if needs be – not an ideal situation for anyone.

Since I began this, the terrible Yom Kippur murders have taken place in Manchester. Now I am wondering if it’s safe to send my daughter to a Jewish school, which might be attacked, or for her to commute with Jewish symbols on her blazer. It feels like we’re facing a Hobson’s choice.

1ogl7l2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1ogl7l2/bf_keeps_score_of_things_he_buysdoes_for_me_and/,"BF keeps score of things he buys/does for me and says I do the bare minimum in comparison because of times I haven’t been able to meet a sexual desire, AIO?","I feel like I’m going crazy bc I posted about this on tiktok and every comment except one was like “all relationships are transactional, life isn’t a disney fairytale” like am I wrong to think this isn’t normal?

We are currently on a break for unrelated reasons but both this time we went on a break and last time, which was under very similar circumstances where his family was pressuring him for more financial support from him, he listed things he bought for me and said I’m ungrateful because I haven’t been doing enough one sided sexual acts, and implied I take from him without giving back or showing enough appreciation. He said he wouldn’t have broken up with me over these things, but he still wanted to get it out there so that when we get back together “things will be different”. 

This time he didn’t say I was ungrateful but he listed things (giving me his handheld vacuum, sliding me money when I was broke, being there for me emotionally when we first met 3 yrs ago??) and said that my efforts in the relationship are the bare minimum in comparison, so it’s not a big ask for me to give more head. Mind you I do this multiple times a week, almost every time I see him and he often initiates seeing me by asking for a sexual favor, and a decent amount of the time I don’t get anything in return. 

I also have never asked for or expected a gift/money from him, he just offers them sometimes and I am grateful, but I never think “oh let me suck his dick rn to show my appreciation” because I’m already doing that regularly anyways. He probably did get off on the days he did the things he mentioned. But there are a few times we’ve stopped in the act because he could tell I wasn’t that into it which I guess is what he’s bothered by. 

This doesn’t happen often but when it does, it’s usually when I’m really tired and he’s not engaging much with me. We talked about this recently and he responded well, we’ve been exploring ways to engage me more even when he’s not in the mood for sex/making me orgasm and it’s been going well, so I’m surprised this is still a problem. The last time I saw him was initiated by him texting me asking for head, and it was one sided. 

He also mentioned a few other things that he feels shows my lack of effort, like me not following through on a threesome I agreed to, not going to the gym when I’ve said I wanted to, and saying no to touching his dick in a movie theater recently. I couldn’t process the whole conversation in the moment but I did tell him how this makes me feel reduced to my sexuality and that it’s unfair to compare giving sexually to giving materially or emotional support. He tried to say it wasn’t about sexual things but about not following through on my word about the threesome and the gym, and he’d be bothered by those things even if they weren’t sexual. 

But the only the threesome was about follow through, and the gym was confusing because that’s not something he asked me to do and I agreed to, just something I’ve talked about wanting to do and him being supportive bc he wants me to be able to ride him for longer without needing to switch positions. It all goes back to his sexual wants not always being met, especially since we had basically this same conversation a year and a half ago. 

He also said that it’s not about material things he gives vs sexual things but just things he’s done for me recently, and I was too stunned in the moment/didn’t have time to get into why keeping score of any kind of effort to throw back in my face and diminish my efforts is unfair. 

And not to be petty, but there’s lots of times he offers things of his own volition and doesn’t follow through, which is a little different than agreeing to a sexual request without taking the time to assess how you really feel, and then not knowing how to communicate that. Which still isn’t great, and I do take accountability for that, but being hesitant about a previously agreed to threesome is a little different than bringing up wanting to buy me a sweatshirt a bunch of times and then never doing it. I never hound him for these things but I do feel a little disappointed that I got excited for something that never happened, but no one owes me anything.

I also just feel invisible in all the other ways I care for him, the time, labor, consideration, money, and support I put into to him. There are things I want from him, but I don’t care for him or do kind things because I want him to feel indebted to give me what I want. I do kind things because I want to make those I love feel seen and cared for, with the trust that they will make their care for me known as well in the ways that they can. I’ve tried to show him he is worthy of love not because of what he can materially give to others, but because of who he is, as he has people in his life who base their approval of him based on how much he can provide for them. I always keep that in mind with him specifically, because I know how hurt and devalued he’s felt by transactional dynamics in his own family. 

He brought up giving me his vacuum, when I also recently gave him my desk chair when his broke. I hate playing tit for tat but I do lots of things like that for him, I cook for him, give him pedicures, do little acts of service like making him coffee every morning. The last time I saw him I told him I finally got all the ingredients to make his favorite meal after going to different grocery stores for a week, is that not effort and care? And I made it on the day he asked me to, even though I never saw him because he didn’t know how to tell me some family issues came up and he needed a break until he felt more stable. 

I’ve also been there emotionally for him, through family passings and job losses and family strife, because I genuinely cared and not as leverage to use against him when I don’t get what I want.

But I just don’t think it’s a normal expectation that because you bought someone something or were there for them that they owe you even more sexual favors than they already give you. And to reduce all their other efforts to the bare minimum, as if you’ve given them the world and they’ve given you nothing because they occasionally weren’t in the mood for one sided sexual favors or couldn’t fulfill a fantasy. 

We have always had an extremely strong sexual connection, have done things together we’ve never done with anyone else, and I don’t mind doing one sided things for him if he’s had a stressful day/week. 

In the beginning our sex life felt a lot more mutually connected, but one sided acts have become more common as time over the last few years as life has become more demanding on him. And like I said I don’t mind pleasing him regularly, but I want there to be understanding that just like there are times he’s too tired for sex, I might be too tired occasionally for head. And not to be TMI, but each time I give him head it’s very intense and usually takes 45 mins to an hour. I literally put my whole body, sweat and tears into it. I don’t think it’s crazy to think doing that multiple times a week is a display of effort and care, not the bare minimum, even if I have to say no every once in a while.

1ogl7a2,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1ogl7a2/harvest_in_hikatoba/,Harvest in Hikatoba,"My name is Tamantha ‘Trouble’ Turrell, if you're reading this, then Hikatoba, Idaho is gone.

It all started on September 21st. I woke up and went to my little dead-end job at Marinette's coffee house. A small mom-and-pop style coffee shop. Since our podunk town was too small for a Starbucks, this was the best we could do. I unlocked the employee entrance, got the machines up and running, and started making Mr. Sampson's order. Once the coffee was percolating, I unlocked the front door and flipped the sign. The same as always, nothing ever changes in Hikatoba.

At exactly 6:45 A.M., Mr. Sampson walked through the front door, like always. He was a large man; he towered over my staggering 5’5” like some biblical giant. He kind of looked like someone gave a gorilla a terrible haircut, all muscle and hair. His pug-like face scrunched up in what could be generously described as a smile, with his prominent canines on full display. “Good morning, Mr. Sampson, having a good day?” I asked in my best customer service voice, a fake smile on my face.

“Morning, Miss Turrell. I'm having a wonderful day! Excited for the festival tonight?” His voice boomed out, shaking me from my routine momentarily. He was normally a very reserved man.

“Festival? I haven't heard anything about it.” I had lived here my entire life, and we had never had a festival around this time.

“Ah, it’s the full moon harvest festival. Mayor Prescott decided to revive it this year. We haven't done it since I was a pup.” He gave a hearty chuckle after he spoke. “It’ll be in the town square tomorrow night, make sure to show up, lass. It’ll be a celebration of a lifetime.” He paid and left shortly after.

Overly exuberant potato farmers aside, the rest of my shift passed like normal. With me doom-scrolling on my phone most of my shift, unfortunately interrupted on occasion to do my job. At 8:30 P.M., I wrapped up my shift by vaulting the day's meager earnings and cleaning the machines. It was 9 P.M. when I locked up the door and started on my way back home. The moon was out softly illuminating the two-lane road that ran through the center of town. Scattered street lamps lit up parts of the street better, but the majority of them were broken from generations of bored teenagers. Our small village couldn't even afford to replace them until next year.

I was about halfway back to my duplex when I felt the hair on the back of my neck rise. It felt like someone or something was watching me. Glancing around, the only thing I saw was the mist from my breath in the chilly autumn air. As I passed by an alleyway, I heard a trash can get knocked over and a loud gravelly hiss. The sound nearly made me jump out of my skin, and I spun around, quickly getting into what could liberally be called a boxer's stance. A large tomcat came streaking out of the alley and ran across the street. The relief I felt nearly sent me to my knees until I heard a howl.

We don't have a ton of wolves in Idaho, but we do have a decent population. Not enough to be hearing them in town, however. Later I figured it was probably someone’s hound dog or a coyote howling out. That fact didn't stop me from immediately racing back to my crappy little duplex, nearly dropping my keys as I hurriedly tried to unlock my door. When I finally got inside, I all but slammed the door shut, locking it before collapsing onto my rear right in front of it, sighing in relief at being safe in my home. The feeling of being watched was finally gone.

After a little while of calming myself down, I set about my nightly routine, turning on some music, showering, and reheating leftovers from 3 days ago. My half of the house was on the ground floor, and thankfully my upstairs neighbor was a truck driver who wouldn't be home for three more days, so I wouldn't have to listen to his booming footsteps all night. Turning off my music and flipping on the SYFY channel, I passed out on my hand-me-down couch to the dulcet tones of some B-rate horror flick about the Beast from the mountains or something equally cheesy.

Around midnight, I got woken up by some dumb werewolf movie. The howling and various other noises like scratching, sniffing, and growling must have gotten my sleep-addled brain to throw up some terrible dream thinking there was something at my own door, or at least that's what I thought at the time.

When morning arrived, I set about the herculean task of waking up. I was halted in my epic quest by my phone ringing. It was my boss, Mrs. Harriet. She was a sweet old lady whose husband had passed away a few years ago. “Hello, Tammy dear, I just wanted to let you know you won't be needed at the shop today. I'm closing down for the festival, so go have fun and maybe meet a boy tonight. Like that Carson's boy, you know he's carried a torch for you since you both were in diapers.” She also elected herself my personal matchmaker.

“I’ll be at that festival, Mrs. Harriet, and no, I will not be going with Scott Carson.” The jerk stole my cookies in elementary school and I will never forgive him. Her grandmotherly chuckle told me that she was by no means deterred.

“We’ll see, dearie. Ah, I can't wait for you young’uns to see your first harvest. It was always such a treat as a child; the sky would light up like the Fourth back in the day.” Her wistful tone was almost reverent as if she was remembering an almost religious experience. “Well, I’ll let you go now, sweetie. Come say hello before the big finale, and if you bring a boy I'll buy you both a treat.” She bribed, making me roll my eyes.

We said our goodbyes and I promptly flopped back onto the couch, excited to relax for a little while longer than normal. By the time I actually got up and ready, it was noon. When I stepped outside, I could already hear the hustle and bustle of the locals setting up in the center of town about three blocks away. When I went to lock my door, I noticed it. The upper half of the windowless metal door was covered in claw marks: shallow furrows, widely spaced on its surface far too high for any hound or coyote.

A cold sense of dread filled me from the cruel revelation. I fled towards the center of town, not quite jogging but definitely fast walking. I hoped that being around others would keep me safe and calm me down. Even the scent of vinegar-covered French fries, finger steaks, and ice cream potatoes couldn't keep my mind off of the fear lancing through me. The festival was little more than a glorified street fair early in the day with small groups of teens and young adults milling about buying food and various knickknacks from street vendors, while the village elders set up street games and stalls. I meandered about, finding myself drawn to the large stage being set up at the center of the small park that was the town square.

I could recognize everyone setting up the stage with sound equipment and small braziers. It was mostly the male teachers from the local public school, but one face stood out, Mayor Prescott. Once I got to the foot of the stage, he greeted me with a warm smile. “Ms. Tamantha Turrel, not causing any problems today?”

I winced at his words; this was the problem with tiny towns and villages. Everyone knew everyone and, worse, knew all the nonsense they got up to as kids. “No, sir, Mayor Prescott, I'm just enjoying the fair. Promise.” I was a bit of a hellion growing up, and frequently got stern talking-to’s by the mayor and local sheriff, Tom Carson. Despite my reservations on dating the damnable cookie thief, Scott and I were thick as thieves when we were kids, always getting into trouble, and thankfully his dad would let us go with a slap on the wrist. Yay nepotism.

“Mhmm, I’m sure, Trouble.” I blushed at the old nickname. “Scott is helping out with the dunk tank, would you mind lending him a hand? Someone needs to run the game while he gets drenched.”

A smirk filled with schadenfreude crossed my face as I happily agreed. He pointed me in the right direction and I made my way through the milling throngs that only seemed to grow as the day wore on. When I got to the tank, the six-foot, ginger lunk was sitting on the small diving board looking exceptionally bored. When he saw me approaching, he immediately groaned. “No. No. No, not you, come on” He whined out, dragging out the n of on like a petulant child.

“Sorry, Scooter, mayor's orders,” I grinned up at him maliciously. He rolled his eyes and stuck out his tongue.

“How ya been, Trouble, break anyone's nose recently?” the bakery burglar cheeked back.

“Steal any poor defenseless maiden’s sweets recently?” I asked in reply.

He snorted. “I never once stole any maiden’s sweets. I valiantly fought a dragon for her hoard,” He defended his honor with lies and slander.

I stared at him with a raised eyebrow, before raising my fist to the target that served as the idiot’s drop switch. He scoffed, “Cheater. For real though, Tammy, how ya been? I hardly ever see you anymore.”

“If you left that farm of yours more than once a year, maybe I’d grace you with my beautiful visage,” I let my words linger for a second in false pretension before letting out a long sigh, the weight of last night’s events coming back in full force. “Honestly though, something followed me home last night. I'm a little freaked out.”

That got his attention quickly and he straightened up like a soldier on his little plywood seat. “What the hell? You’re not hurt, are you?”

“I’m fine, Scott. I won't get my deposit back though. Whatever it was scratched my door the hell up. It might have been a wolf.” After a quick glance around, seeing no one coming toward us, I leaned closer to his Plexiglas tank. “Promise not to laugh?” He nodded and leaned in. “I think it was a huge werewolf,” I whispered to him. He immediately reeled back, laughing. His stupid belly laugh only infuriated me. “I’m serious, Scott! There are freaking claw marks at the top of my door!"" I stamped my foot, my face flushing red at the admittedly crazy things leaving my mouth.

His peels of laughter died down, seeing my pissed-off face. “All right, fine, fine, you got a werewolf stalker. Want me to get some silver bullets and come over tonight?” He could barely hide his building giggle fit behind a poker face that had gotten us into trouble more than once. The not-so-little shit.

“Yes,” I pouted, turning my crimson face away from him. I noticed with vindictive glee a group of teens heading our way. “Hey, come on over and try to dunk the village idiot!” I yelled out, pointing to the poorly painted graphic on the side of the dunk tank showing the price. “Only a dollar a throw!” The surge of euphoria I felt as they hurried our way and Scott's squawk of indignation was glorious.

The boys walked up, forking over the cash quickly. After I handed them their baseballs, they got lined up behind the line painted into the grass with spray paint, and immediately sent the big moron to his watery punishment. Peals of laughter escaped the boys at Scott's horrified yelp as he plunged into the chill water; his shaggy orange hair made him look like a wet sheepdog as he emerged from the depths grumbling about evil women. The rest of our afternoon continued like that: banter, fake arguments, and me egging passersby to come dunk him whenever he got the upper hand. I wish I knew it would be the last time I ever heard the big guy’s laugh.

As sunset rolled around, I helped Scott out of the tank and followed him over to the nearby ice cream parlor that was being used as a public restroom. He dried off and got changed before rejoining me. “Hey Tam, sorry for laughing earlier. My offer still stands if you're not feeling safe. Although I don’t think I have any silver bullets. A .45 usually stops whatever you put it into,” he said, showing me the pistol he's keeping hidden under a button-up shirt. It was hanging in an appendix carry holster, looking like his dad’s old 1911.

“I… I’d appreciate that,"" I told him haltingly. We strolled for a few minutes, the sunset’s purple and orange hues illuminating the world in a soft glow. The braziers scattered around the park were lit by volunteers, casting an almost comforting glow around the quickly darkening world. That's when I saw Mrs. Harriet.

“Mrs. Harriet!” I ran up, Scott on my heels like a lovesick puppy as I jogged up to my boss. She kept walking toward the stage oblivious to us. “Mrs. Harriet, how are you?” I asked once we got to her side.

She kept walking, not looking over at us. “Come on, dear, we can’t be late for the prayer.” She led the way to the stage in a quick old lady shuffle, excited to share a moment of her youth with us. I could do without praying to a God I don't believe in, but I supposed indulging an old lady wouldn't kill me, so I followed. As we arrived, we were a bit late, managing to snag the lucrative spot at the very back of the crowd. She finally acknowledged our presence fully. “Oh, so you did take my advice, dear?” Her smirk was insufferable. “No sneaking off to go make out, the end of the festival is the best part, dear.” Turning from my flustered self, she looked over at Scott. “You behave too, little scooter.”

Seeing she turned us both into tongue-tied messes, she gave out a quick cackle of old-lady laughter before turning to the stage, as the mayor walked out to the center of it wearing a weird cloak. It was a shade of green that reminded me of the deep woods right at the cusp of night, or the depths of the ocean. “Dwellers of Hikatoba!” The mayor’s voice boomed out, the speakers on stage barely working but in the hushed silence of twilight his voice carried far and loud. “Tonight we celebrate the equinox, and harvest for the Lord.”

“Rush’tavg,” the voices of the older villagers resonated out in the park. It was then I noticed everyone under 30 was in the center of the group with only me and Scott being outliers. I looked at him quizzically, silent, trying to ask him if he knew what the hell the old folks just said. He just shrugged, shaking his head no.

“When the moon is at its zenith, the harvest shall begin and our worship shall be rewarded!” the mayor continued, uncaring of the confusion spreading among the youngest members of the village. Some fearfully chatted, and looked around.

“Rush’tavg,” the elders chanted once more, and I was brutally reminded of last night's events as the feeling of being watched resurfaced once again. The moon began to rise, a sickly pale green glow emanating off of it as it peeked through the tree line, looking far larger than ever before. It was like someone had pulled it hundreds of miles toward the earth, and it felt like it was staring down on the village's ritual.

“The time of celestial alignment is upon us, my flock, raise your voice and bring forth your prayers for the Lord,” the mayor intoned to the gathered mass as a slow fog crept into the clearing.

“Rush’tavg,” the monotone chant echoed out once more. I looked over and saw Mrs. Harriet's eyes were clouded over in a midnight black. She looked like she was possessed. With a loud thud, my eyes were wrenched back to the stage as a new, large, inhuman figure took up its place behind the mayor. It was shaped like a hound, but completely wrong. It was about ten feet tall, sitting on its haunches. Its body seemed to shift and rip open, revealing maws lined with sharpened canines, and eyes that looked to be cut from jade—all color, no pupil, no cornea. Where eyes would be on a normal dog, the mutant mutt had additional slobbering maws, tongues hanging freely, pointed and coated in sickening red goopy slobber. Its eyeless head fixated on me for a moment, and the feeling of being watched increased a thousandfold.

“The Lord is pleased with this season's harvest! He has sent his carrier to us.” The mayor preached to his faithful, uncaring of the fearful murmurs of the gathered young at the center of the crowd. Scott grabbed my arm, pulling my attention from the hound’s unfaltering stare. My mind pounded as he motioned with his head. I nodded in agreement to his unspoken plan to run while we could.

“Rush’tavg Nah Vir Sah’tohem,” the crowd began to chant and raise their arms. Scott and I slowly backed away, keeping our eyes locked on the occult scene before us. I swear the sky flashed, lit up in an ethereal green like the aurora borealis had decided to appear. It was gone before I could blink, and the hound stood, its eyeless sockets in its face still locked on us. The elders’ arms lowered, locking in a ring around the younger townsfolk, and the beast stepped down among them. Its eye tongues lashed out, tasting and sampling frightened young adults and children. It stopped in front of Susan Chalimege, a 7-year-old kid who would come by the coffee shop for baked goods we’d sell. It took a long sniff of her face before snorting and looking back up at me, the various shifting eyes across its body squinting before it gave out a low bark. The bass of it reverberated through my bones even though Scott and I were almost a football field away. The sky flashed again, longer this time. There were swirls of the cloudy green substance in the sky writhing through the air like great worms swimming through the ether. They were gone a moment later.

Scott and I turned after the abomination barked and started sprinting down the road. We could hear the creature's thunderous paws pound the ground behind us in a haunting rhythm. It felt like death itself was chasing us down the road. Its low, resonating howl echoed in the night air. The fearful cries of the children in the park and the mayor's elated shout of “The carrier has chosen this season's harvest!” acted as sickening backup singers to the howl’s lead vocals. Realizing either Scott or I was chosen by some fucked-up mix of hound and demon as a sacrifice made us run even harder.

Once we made it halfway to my place, Scott turned to me, his face hauntingly gorgeous backlit by the ever-flickering sky, black tendrils now sweeping the cosmic green slurry in the flashes. “Go, I’ll slow it down. Get somewhere safe, Trouble,” His words greatly irked me as he pulled the pistol and started to slow down.

“The hell you will, Scott Mathias Carson! You have to protect me from werewolves tonight!” I screamed at him, tears beginning to form in my eyes knowing what the idiot was planning.

He just gave me that damn lopsided smile before whispering, “I am.” He stopped completely and turned. “Get safe and leave this shithole like ya always wanted to, Trouble! I got this!” His yell was accompanied by hot stinging trails of tears scorching down my cheeks as I kept running. The gunshots behind me echoed hollowly into the night, each blast emphasized with another flash from the sky, its eyes watching me in cruel indifference. They were emeralds, like the abomination’s eyes but blown up to massive size like blimps in the sky. At that scale you could see the center looked like waterfalls into endless voids of green, a strange depth endless but visible. My head throbbed in pain as I ran into my door. The gunshots went silent and the screaming started as I fumbled my keys trying desperately to get them into the damn lock. The key slotted into the lock and the screaming stopped with a sickening squelching pop.

I slammed my door shut, hoping it was up for a repeat of last night's performance, as I huddled in my closet. I pulled out my phone and started to write this warning. Hopefully whatever is covering the sky can't block wifi. Even now, after writing this all out, I can hear the beast pounding on my door using Scott’s voice trying to get me to leave. “Trouble, come on. You were chosen. It's a great honor.” I can feel the moon's loving gaze bearing down fully on the village, its tendrils reaching down and tenderly caressing the streets. Please heed my warning: Hikatoba is gone, don't come.",1,1761486850.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I never have to wait for a warm-up.

I'm updating my kitchen and adding a coffee maker water line (with full home water filtration system) and I want to get a machine that is:

\-Plumbed, with no reservoir that makes the machine wider  
\-I can program turn on and turn off times (i.e. be on 7am-4pm every day)

1ogl1gk,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ogl1gk/5_new_coffee_deals_this_week_usa_only/,5 New Coffee Deals This Week [USA Only],"I wanted to share 5 new deals from interesting roasters in the USA that I blogged about this week.

For those not familiar, BeanDeals started a few weeks ago on a whim as an experiment.  I started following as many roasters as I could find to test a hypothesis that there would be cool deals every day. The hypothesis proved correct, and that’s the back story of how I came to track 1,500+ roasters and launch a blog to share my findings with the community.  Every day I look for the best 1 or 2 deals that stand out.

This week I blogged about 7 deals, but 2 of them (Ohm in Napa and Superlost in Brooklyn) expired already.  Here's the 5 that are still live:

1. [Denim Coffee (PA)](https://beandeals.com/denim-coffee-free-4oz-sample/) \- You can get a free 4oz single origin sample for $2 shipped.  Even more fun, tack on a regular 12oz bag ($15) and you're locked in for the same $2 shipping.   A great way to try a new roaster with a low commitment.
2. [Pablo's Coffee (Denver)](https://beandeals.com/pablos-coffee-20-off/) \- 20% off through 10/31.  Grab 4 bags for free shipping and you're getting these for $13/bag for their baseline blends.   Or checkout some origins for a few bucks more.
3. [Muletown Coffee (TN)](https://beandeals.com/muletown-coffee-25-off/) \- 25% off, expires tonight. (4) 12oz bags for free shipping at $13.50 / bag for blends.  I recommend this deal for bulk buyers too since this roaster has a great implied discount on 5lb bags -- $60 (free shipping) with this deal for their blends.
4. [Color Coffee (Eagle, CO)](https://beandeals.com/color-coffee-20-off-5lb-bags/) \- 20% off 5lb bags, 15% off 2lb bag through 10/31.   Get a 5lb bag for as low as $70, or a 2lb bag for $40.46 (just clears free shipping).   They also have a great selection of premium origins that trend much higher in price.
5. [Opus Coffee (FL)](https://beandeals.com/opus-coffee-20-off-sitewide-2/) \- I just posted this deal today.  20% off, expires tomorrow.   Grab (3) 12oz bags for free shipping at $15.30 / bag for their blends.

I've also got 18 other deals live on my site, including from some popular brands like CounterCulture and  Intelligentsia, and from a bunch of small roasters that are probably new to you.   I'm sure there will be a few more great deals coming later this week for Halloween too.

I don't make any money if you buy any of the deals I post.  I am not a middleman and not affiliated with any roasters.   If you guys come across any awesome deals in the future from your favorite roasters, definitely drop me a PM.",16,1761486419.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

It's about all I can manage at 4:30am.

Around 7:30 or 8 I'm looking to have a second cup and that's when I'll do a latte or cappuccino to take to work (I only need to walk 150m from house to work) in 12 oz travel mug.  I've got a 2018 version of the Breville Barista Express.  It's only a single boiler and it takes a minute to minute 30 to steam the milk.  I will measure out 18g of coffee and run it through the built in grinder which does a pretty good job and I've played with the settings to get it just right.  I'm getting about 36 to 40g of espresso.  It varies a bit as you can't only get so accurate with this machine.

I've been looking at getting a dual boiler and a separate grinder.  I know Breville is only consumer grade but they are a reasonable price for us non pros.  Is there any other machine that might be better?  As for a grinder I would love one that can dose a proper amount every time and not be off by 2 grams either way.

Or the other option would be to just stick with what I have and save my money.  ",1,1761486318.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

*Where the only thing more volatile than the odds is the number of times a player will trip over their own shoelaces.*

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Toes

The numbers tell a story of Lyon as the faint underdog in a race where everyone’s wearing lead boots. Converting the decimal odds to implied probabilities:

* **Lyon**: \~52% chance to win (odds: 1.91–1.95).
* **Strasbourg**: \~25–26% chance (odds: 3.6–3.95).
* **Draw**: \~27% (odds: 3.6–3.8).

The market’s essentially saying Lyon has a slight edge, but this isn’t a cakewalk. The total goals line sits at **2.75**, with most books favoring the *over* (odds as low as 1.67 for over 2.5 goals). Given the history of this rivalry—last season’s 4-3 and 4-2 scores—it’s as if these teams play soccer by firing cannonballs at each other’s goal.

### Digesting the News: Coffee, Fatigue, and a Midweek Munchie Marathon

Both teams are coming off midweek European jaunts: Lyon faced Basel in the Europa League, while Strasbourg tangled with Jagiellonia in the Conference League. Players are likely as refreshed as a 3 a.m. barista on decaf—i.e., not at all.

Lyon’s recent 2-3 loss to Nice? A speed bump, not a cliff. Strasbourg’s 3-3 draw with PSG, though? A minor miracle. The reigning champions left Parc des Princes with more gray hairs than points, which says less about their defense and more about Strasbourg’s ability to turn PSG’s backline into a game of Jenga.

Key lineups? Lyon’s defense includes Maitland-Niles and

somewhere along the way i gained some weight and woke up one day and decided, lets lose some of it, bought a food scale, learned about calories and macros, and it all went downhill from there. it’s been a constant cycle of overly restricting, over eating, feeling guilt, constantly body checking and weighing myself, working out to burn off calories instead of an actual desire to do so, hating going out to eat or eating food someone else cooked because of the unknown.

i’m just so annoyed that at the point in my life when i was probably my goal weight and felt the best about myself, i didn’t even know what a calorie was or what i actually weighed. ",4,1761486110.0,EDAnonymous,0,1.0,False

Here’s the plot twist: while Dubai was obsessed with coffee, a new trend silently exploded — matcha. And it’s causing a global crisis.

The global matcha market grew 240% in just 8 months (Jan-Aug 2024 in Germany alone). Japanese exporters like Marukyu Koyamaen and Ippodo Tea are now nearly sold out. Purchase prices in Japan have tripled, and retail prices doubled.

In Dubai and Abu Dhabi, specialty cafés are now racing to add matcha lattes, matcha-infused dates, and cardamom-dusted matcha desserts to compete with traditional coffee.

Tea farmers in Japan lacking equipment and resources are facing bankruptcy. Some tea ceremony practitioners and confectionery makers have stopped drinking matcha entirely because prices are too high.

Did you know your matcha latte is causing a crisis in Japan?",1,1761486068.0,DubaiCoffeeLovers,0,1.0,False
1ogkwgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwentiesIndia/comments/1ogkwgu/there_should_be_an_aptitude_test_before_people/,There should be an aptitude test before people are allowed to speak publicly 😤,"I’ve actually reached a point where I can’t stand opening YouTube or Instagram anymore. Every single person with a mic suddenly thinks they’re some kind of philosopher, politician, or intellectual, but 90% of them don’t even know what they’re talking about. It’s like stupidity with confidence has become a career now.  

I saw one interview where Formula 1 drivers were explaining their race setup and the anchor, the anchor herself, goes, “So you’ve created a formula, a concept?” Ma’am, it’s literally Formula One, a global sport that’s been around for decades. And she’s sitting there hosting them like she’s cracked some secret theory. How are these people even given platforms?  

Then there are these political interviews where both the anchor and the politician are just throwing random words like “development,” “youth,” and “vision” with zero meaning behind them. The anchor doesn’t question anything, the politician doesn’t answer anything, and both walk away feeling like they just changed the nation. No accountability, no intelligence, just scripted noise.  

And don’t even get me started on the Instagram “influencers.” Every other 20-something with a filter and an overpriced coffee suddenly becomes a life coach. “You have to believe in yourself.” “Energy attracts energy.” “Discipline is sexy.” Bro, you haven’t even paid your own bills yet. Stop teaching people how to live when you haven’t even lived properly yourself.  

Sometimes I genuinely feel we as a country are allergic to sense. The more nonsense someone speaks, the bigger their following gets. And people clap, share, comment “so true 💯,” like they just witnessed divine wisdom, when it’s just recycled trash in fancy words.  

We’ve reached a stage where being confident while wrong is more profitable than being quiet and right. That’s the problem.  

If we had a simple aptitude test before anyone could start a podcast, host a show, or open their mouth on a stage, 99% of this stupidity would vanish overnight. Gone. Peace. Silence. Maybe then we’d actually hear the few people who make sense.

I don’t even think it’s about being educated, it’s about being aware. Having a brain. And clearly, that’s too much to ask these days.

Does anyone else feel like this influencer-podcast culture is actually making people dumber and louder at the same time?

1ogkuf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFIB/comments/1ogkuf7/af_post_cardiac_ablation_asking_for_support/,AF post cardiac Ablation + asking for support.,"Hello all,  
Below, I put 2 Parts, the first that gives some context about my situation, a second more about my feeling, and some question on how you deal with it for me to ""Try"" new things (Which are not the prescribed drugs).

**Part 1:**

I am 38 M (I am European and live in Europe.)  I am healthy (No heart condition, no Diabetes, not overweight, no cholesterol...), Sporty I have played my whole life basketball at a competitive level (National level in France and Central Europe), when I stopped to play I wanted to do an Ironman which I trained for and completed Sept 2023. The Diagnostic was that I am part of the people doing Ultra endurance sport that are affected by AFIB. No structural issue in my heart, just lost at the ultra-endurance lottery. No anxiety, or stress overall (Just some adrenaline rush prior important competition, game, or key meetings... but nothing erratic).

I do not drink much coffee (Average would be 1 coffee a day probably less, more on the weekend. Drinking alcohol but socially and it has been decreasing as I get older.

After completing the Ironman, I took a 3 weeks break from sport and went back to some crossfit and I trigerred a first Afib. I was 36 and still M. Being young and healthy I was advised to do a cardioversion. Which worked and start of 2024 I was back doing sport, and mid-April back to normal, Cycling 300km in a go, doing some races... No issues. Happy life.

Feb 2025, I went after some holidays for a short run 20min cause it was sunny and I wanted to enjoy it. Nothing hard, highest HB was 155 - I triggered an Afib and back into it.  
As the cardioversion was done the first time I went for the Cardiac Ablation. I had it on the 9th of October. All worked well, it is so nice to have the Rythm beating to the music... feelso good.  
Two weeks later, last thursday back into AF, got the cardiologist who told me it is normal it can happen within the first 3 Months as the Heart is recovering and there inflamation in the heart is high. (Which the feeling in th heart and around is so weird).  
He said if I am still in AF after 7 days, this is when I might have to redo a Cardiac Ablation.

The positive in my case comparing at some people telling their stories here. When in Afib, my heartbeat does not go above 125. I am more between 80/100 - It is due to my sport's history.

**Part 2**:

My main challenge personally is not being able to do sports. It was my way to clear my mind, get my brain to disconnect and stop overthinking.  
How do you deal with it?  
Do you have tricks and tips to naturally slowing the AF outside of the Beta-Blocker (I have Metroprolol 50mg).  
I have tried, Jacobson Relaxation type, trying to lay down. The thing is when it is there I am overthinking it and it can get out of hand and I end up in a spiral that is not good.

I have realised that after a heavy meal, when I do have a bit of an adrenaline rush, when I focus on the unheaven rythm... my AF was more easily triggered.

Thanks for having reading the thread and for the response.

[**I (44m) caught my daughter (15) having sex in our home and I don't know what to do.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1b3h13/i_44m_caught_my_daughter_15_having_sex_in_our/)

My wife is out of town and son is away at college for break so it's just me and my daughter. I was supposed come home late from my office yesterday because of a lot of corporate bullshit I had to tend to but realized I forgot a handful of documents in my office at home so I had to come home earlier than expected.

I come home, go upstairs and walk towards my office down the hall and see my daughter's room door cracked almost half-way open. Wouldn't have thought twice about it if I didn't hear breathing noises coming from her room. I regretfully looked in with a lot of hesitation thinking it may have been my wife cheating on me believe it or not! Instead, I see my daughter on top of her boyfriend.

I suddenly got light headed and sick to my stomach. As much as I wanted to bust in there and grab the kid by the neck, my more reasonable conscience told me that my daughter would hate me if I did that and above that, would be mortified if I ""caught"" them. So it took every ounce of me to just walk into my office slowly and just went to work trying to ignore what just happened.

I ended up sleeping in my office last night. I'm almost certain my daughter realized that I had known she was having sex last night because when I came down for breakfast this morning, she was a little closed off and not willing to talk much. I'm assuming she saw my office light on and saw me sleeping earlier in the morning and figured I had walked past them last night. Anyway, I am pretty pissed right now for many reasons. I think my daughter is too young to have sex and I'm very certain other parents would agree.

I don't know what to do or say to her but I want to sit down with her and have a talk. The last thing I need me brushing this issue aside and making her believe that it's perfectly fine for her to have sex in my house with my knowing. With my anger there is certainly heartache and disappointment because I feel like there was also a considerable level of disrespect on my daughter's part for at least not trying to hide it. Yes, I came home early but I came home to MY house. I haven't talked to my wife yet either and she doesn't get back until Thursday.

TL;DR - Caught my daughter having sex with bf in our home and now I'm pissed and don't know what to say or do with her.

&nbsp;

**REPLIES FROM OOP**

*That's the thing. Her mother is a nurse practitioner and already gave her the entire rundown when our daughter took a health class last year. As relieved as that makes me to know she's well aware, it also worries me because it may give her too much confidence regarding the matter. I'm not worried about any infections because she and her bf are very close and he's a pretty good boy if I must say. I'm just worried about the pregnancy issue because I know she doesn't have BC at this moment and I didn't stick around long enough to see if her bf was using a condom.*

---

*As mentioned, my wife is an NP with a heavy background in the uterine/ovarian cycle and I can say that if anyone noticed or had any reason to believe our daughter was on the pill, her mother would be that person.*

*I will give my wife a call later tonight and give her a little background on what happened so that she can get on the birth control thing right away.*

---

*Very good points. Thank you. I am hoping that my daughter has already been well aware of her consenting rights and has properly conveyed them to her bf because I'm fairly certain I will destroy the kid in every way if I ever find out. I don't give a shit if she's 15 or 30, no one is going to coerce my daughter into doing something she doesn't want to. But I will certainly bring these topics up when I/we talk to her as well.*

---

*Yes, age is an issue but that's about 20% of my concern. My main problem is that if she is going to have sex in our home, why not use more discretion? My wife and I do all the time. My son did as well, and so well that we didn't even know. If she thinks she's grown up enough to have sex, she's damn well grown up enough to be more courteous about closing her bedroom door and not leaving it halfway open so that I or anyone else can hear her moaning. That's disrespectful and rude.*

[**[UPDATE]I (44m) caught my daughter (15) having sex in our home and I don't know what to do.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1bbhst/updatei_44m_caught_my_daughter_15_having_sex_in/)

YESTERDAY: I felt a little more calm and collected in comparison to the day after I found out what was happening. My daughter's breakfast session with me was very brief as I just made my coffee and ran out. I wasn't trying to avoid her. I had two board meetings to attend that day, one of which I was leading so I didn't have much time obviously.

I come home later in the afternoon. Daughter is home. She welcomes me with a hug and kiss and then proceeds to be very cute and bashful with me. She asked how my day was and what business plans I was planning to make. Things that she hasn't had interest in talking about for ages. This alone was a red flag that indicated that she probably thought that I knew about her and the bf, ""Chris.""

The night ended with my daughter asking if she could join me on the couch to watch a movie until she fell asleep. She put her head on a pillow on my lap and watched the movie. I will admit that I had some mixed feelings seeing her head on my lap because it just reminded me of when she was 7 years old and she would always watch tv with me like that. Those memories surprisingly began to lessen my disappointment. 

It was at that point that I became really calmed down about the situation and realized how much my love for her will always overcome anything that may disappoint me. After she fell asleep, I called her mother and told her what had happened. She was shocked but was prepared knowing that she would have to do most of the work when this day came. We discussed a plan of action beginning with her arrival today.

TODAY: I pick up wife from airport in the morning. We decided that it wouldn't be smart to approach her both at the same time. Her mother would break the news to her and immediately take her to get contraceptives and have an introductory talk about sex. Then I would talk to her when she got home. And then finally, my wife would continue to have a chat with her about the more personal and detailed sex issues that we knew wouldn't be comfortable or appropriate for me to discuss with her.

According to my wife, our daughter was shocked and embarrassed to find out that I saw her and Chris. She apologized to her mom and asked her not to be mad and that she was stupid for doing it out in the open like that. She was worried about how I would think but my wife reassured her that I loved her very much and that I would want to just figure this out with her help. They went out to get birth control pills and condoms and during that trip, my wife gave her a detailed run-down of both contraceptive uses.

They came home and my daughter immediately tried to hide from me upstairs. She told her mother that she needed about an hour before I had the talk with her. I gave her that time and space before going to her to have our discussion. 

She was embarrassed to look me in the eyes but I told her I needed her to cooperate so that we could both get through this. I told her that her mother would continue talking to her later about the more personal sex questions later and told her that she did not have to include any of that in our conversation as I didn't want her too either. I got the following answers from the questions I asked:

* She and Chris have been having sex for about 4 months.

* Chris was a virgin as well when they started having sex.

* It was both of their ideas to begin having sex, but more so 60-40 with the boy as the majority.

* There was mutual consent and neither one has pressured the other into doing something they didn't want to.

* There was only one time when Chris unintentionally did something she didn't want but she informed him right away and he apologized and stopped--this made me realize that I needed to sit down with little Romeo and have a little chat with him.

* That night was the first night they had sex in our home. All other times were at his house.

* Both of Chris's parents know they have sex in their home. They also found out the hard way. Both thought they were too young but in the end, accepted it and had a talk with Chris.

* His dad is more accepting of the kids having sex than his mother. His mom is still uneasy having them behind closed doors at home but the dad is more ok with it at this point like any stereotypical dad with his son.

* His dad had a talk with Chris about how to handle my daughter respectfully and that I was happy to hear at least.

I ended our talk with telling her that yes, as a dad, I was disappointed to find out that she was having sex at a young age and wished she had waited a little longer. But made it clear to her that I was speaking from the point of view of most parents. I loved her and would never shame her for exploring her sexuality like other teenagers her age. Her feelings and urges are natural like any other girl her age. Nothing to be ashamed about. I just wanted her to show more discretion with her explorations like all other private matters in her life.

She apologized over and over again and told me she was stupid for not being more careful and courteous of the possibility of anyone else being home. I told her not to dwell on it anymore and to move on. I emphasized that I wanted her to be safe at all times and that if she was old enough to have sex, she was old enough to be responsible about contraceptive use and considering the risk of becoming pregnant. 

I cautioned her not to think that her mother and I would take the responsibility of raising her potential child while she went on with her life. We have careers, responsibilities, and lives as well. And because having sex is a privilege and not a right, she would be responsible for purchasing the BC pills and condoms coming out from her savings account we have set up for her.

I told her I loved her and that I would always be there for her and that she should not be afraid to come to me with any questions or concerns. I told her I planned on having a little civil talk with Chris about the topic sometime this weekend and she said ok.

Thanks to all of you who provided input. Aside from some of the biased perspectives, all of you were great and have helped me guide my role as a father in this type of a situation in the right direction. Thank you so much.

TL;DR - My wife and I spoke with our daughter about her having a sex life with her bf. While a little embarrassed, she was very cooperative as were we. Informed her about contraceptives and how to properly conduct herself in our home.

**REPLIES FROM OOP**

*No we had the talk first when she was 11. Quick run-down about sex and having babies. Then we went into more details about contraceptives etc, when she took her health class last year.*

---

*First of all, in regards to your first question: no, her birth control would not be fully covered by insurance. Based on a sliding scale, we have to provide a co-pay for most if not all of our prescriptions.*

*While having the proper contraceptives is a necessity to avoid pregnancy, that necessity would be obsolete if her having sex wasn't in the equation to begin with. And having sex is certainly not a necessity at her age (in terms of absolute value) so I see the responsibility of buying and using condoms and BC pills as a responsibility that my daughter must procure.*

*Do I want my daughter to get pregnant at 15? Of course not. But her decision to have sex is one that all adults make. As adults ourselves, you and I know no one will be buying us condoms or bc pills any time soon so why should I make any exceptions for my daughter? Because she's 15? Mature actions require mature considerations and planning and that is something that my daughter must learn before it's too late.*

*Besides, it's not like using her own money to buy the contraceptives will put a dent in her savings account. She has more than enough funds in there to provide for her 4-year college education as well as other amenities. Spending X dollars per month on things that will ensure that she continue to be a successful student and normal teenager is a very small price to pay.*

---

*No, any money she has made on her own (excluding allowance) is located in a joint checking account I have set up for her. All the money in her savings account came from my pocket, investments, stock options, etc. You need to understand that it's not a matter of petty treatment on our part when we choose not to pay for her pills/condoms. We are not trying to say ""We think you're too young to have sex and because we do, we won't pay for your stuff and you have to. So THERE"" What we are trying to say is ""You obviously think you're responsible enough to have sex at your age and we respect that. But you must learn to consider all the other responsibilities that go with having sex and we think you're mature and able enough to do just that.""*

---

*Then she will have to deal with the consequences along with the boy. I won't be putting my career and life aside (and neither will my wife) to sit home and babysit while my daughter finishes high school. What if she gets pregnant? Then she will have to take indefinite time off from school and take care of her child.*

*I never said I would toss my daughter out on the street. I'm just not going to take over the responsibilities of her life due to her decisions. If she chooses not to use contraception, her fault and choice. And I'm fairly sure that there is a slim chance of conception when there is both a use of condoms and birth control.*

# **Final Update - 6 days later (2 days later from the last post)**

[**[FINAL UPDATE] I (44m) caught my daughter (15) having sex in our home and I don't know what to do.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1bgwbc/final_update_i_44m_caught_my_daughter_15_having/)

I have a very busy schedule but due to a large number of people requesting that I make a final update, I will provide one as I had promised.

I have been a lot more relaxed and at ease after our talk with our daughter.

Yesterday, I get back from the gym and my daughter comes up to me and says that she had a little talk with Chris on Saturday night telling him what I knew and what was discussed between us a couple of days ago. He was upset that they were caught and thought that I wanted to kill him. 

She assured him that I was calmed down and wanted to be very civil with him. She didn't mention to him that I wanted to sit down with him sometime in the future and just have a friendly talk about house rules and such because she was afraid he might've had a nervous breakdown. She decided to hold that thought until a little while later.

Then my daughter tells me that Chris had called her yesterday morning and he asked her if he could talk to me. He told her that he always assumed I was still aggressive and angry from my college football days and that really scared him. But he thought he would be an idiot not to own up to his actions and come to me to explain his side. 

He said that he put himself in my shoes and realized that he would probably react the way I did initially and knows it wouldn't be right to leave the situation as is if he intended on not showing any disrespect towards my wife and me.

I appreciated hearing all that and the kid began to actually grow on me at that point, I must admit. It takes a lot of maturity for a 15 year old to say those things. My daughter said that I would be leaving Tuesday for Europe and wouldn't be back for a while so he should hurry and have the talk if he really wanted to. So he decided to come over to our home on Sunday evening.

I told him right away that he needed to relax because I wasn't angry and aggressive. I told him that being strict didn't mean I was heartless. We sat down and before anything, I gave him a quick run-down of the house rules and what I expected from the both of them in our house. 

I told him that in light of recent events, I have come to the conclusion that they are now both obligated to handle themselves as young adults and deal with any aspects of their relationship themselves. They can always come to us for advice and information but ultimately, they will be the final decision makers in their relationship. All I expected was mutual respect, consent, and compromise.

He understood everything that I said and then began apologizing about what happened that night. He said he meant no disrespect to me or my wife and that they even discussed closing the door but ""stupidly"" decided it wouldn't matter according to him.

I told him to relax and that I have put myself in his shoes too the last couple of days and realized how easy it would be for a couple of teenagers to act on a whim and not be careful about the things they do. I told him that common courtesy always matters regardless of you being alone or not. What you do invariably affects others at some point down the line.

He mentioned that his parents knew but had only recently found out (a couple of weeks?). He said they were shocked themselves and didn't know if they should approach my wife and I in fear of us lashing out at our daughter. So instead, his dad took up the task of talking to Chris about what he needed to know instead. 

He said that both his parents had the talk with him like we did with our daughter and his parents also agreed to have their son be responsible for the purchase and use of condoms. And for those few dissenters who thought it was cruel for me to have my daughter be responsible for her own contraceptives, this boy, unlike my daughter, has to pay for his own stuff with an allowance that is half of my daughter's in which he has mostly worked for one way or another. His parents provide funds for all important and normal costs that Chris may have but have him pay for all the things he uses for ""fun times"" from his allowance therefore condoms fall under that category.

I told him that he shouldn't worry that much about the money because being that my daughter is in a similar boat, they can work together to split the costs or trade off buying what they need to stay protected. They can also communicate with one another as a way to remind each other what needs to be done and when so that we the adults don't have to involve ourselves in their business. 

I talked about a couple of more things that I won't get into details about because of time and length. I finished our conversation reminding him that he was a great student-athlete that had a bright future just like my daughter in her academic career and they both have very high hopes and goals. But the reality of those dreams will fail to appear if they choose to make the wrong decision from here on out. Thanks to everyone that helped. I really appreciate it!

TL;DR - The boy came to talk to me. He apologized and we discussed some ground rules for my house. He's a good kid.

>Wow. I've been following your story this whole time and it's broken my heart a little bit, not because you handled it badly, but because everyone handled this so well. My father would have gone about this all wrong from the start, and reading this makes me so, so happy for your daughter - what a lucky girl - and so in awe of you. She may not know it yet, but you've given her an incredible foundation on which she will build loving, trusting relationships throughout her life. Thank you, from a daughter who had to spend years in therapy learning to communicate, for teaching her this and showing her the way she should expect men to treat her.

The last couple of months I (23f) have been noticing a change in attitude in my best friend of 3 years, let’s call her Lin (23f), and it has been steering me away. 

It started last month when we went to a concert together, an artist we both really love. At the end of the show, I ended up getting a setlist and she flipped out, saying things like “I brought you here!” in a general manner that made it seem like she deserved it more than me (when we both had tickets months in advance and I drove there??) and didn’t even chill out when she even got her own setlist the same night. Just was mad and trying to fight about it, couldn’t place why even after she got it.

Anyways, second instance was only a week and a half after that. This one is what definitely started my ponder on whether this friendship was right for me or not. We went to a concert together again a couple cities away for her birthday. We had planned to get to the city early that day so we could do a bunch of activities before the show, which was at 8, and get breakfast the morning after and then leave early the next day. I told her I wanted to be home earlier the day after because I had things to do and opened the next morning at work so I just wanted the evening to get ready for the work week. 

So…some background also. I live an hour and a half away from her. The day of her birthday and day of the show, I leave my house early and I arrive at her house at 10am, thinking we would leave by 11/12 because we had planned to be there earlier. I give her her gifts and wait and whatnot—and I end up waiting for her to get ready for 6 hours. You read that correctly. We didn’t leave her house until 4:45pm. I even took a nap while waiting for her. We leave and the drive is 2 hours so we don’t get there until 6:45, an hour 15 before the show starts. We only have time to get a drink and a bite before and head right there. I accidentally get too drunk celebrating her bday, but the show still went great. After the show we went to a couple bars then back to the hotel. I woke up the next morning seeing God—genuinely one of the worst hangovers I have ever experienced. I threw up like 8 times within the first hour I was awake. I’ll spare you more gory details but let’s just say I was excited to gtfo of there. We check out at noon and I’m expecting to just get some grub and leave, but no. Lin takes me to Whole Foods, where I have to get some fruit and wait outside because I almost vommed in the cheese isle. She takes 30 minutes in there. We then leave there and go someplace else to smoke. I tell her again at this point (it’s 1 o’clock), that I wanna head back kind of early because it’s 4 hours home for me and I have things to do. She looks at me like I have to be kidding, which made me feel bad. It was her birthday after all, but I still wanted to stick to the plan cause not only did I have shit to do, but I was also feeling very terrible. She pretty much negated what I said and we stayed in the city until 5pm doing things we planned to do the day before, but didn’t because she wasn’t ready to go in the morning and spent 6 hours getting ready. I was basically just trying to go with the flow because I had already spoke up once and she didn’t listen—so just hoping she would decide to wrap it up sooner rather than later. Anyways! When we left, I was feeling especially awful, and asked her to roll her windows up on the highway because the hot and cold air was getting to me and I felt like I was gonna vom (she likes to drive with AC blasting and windows down on the highway, no matter the temperature)—she looked at me like I was personally offending her, and proceeded to not speak to me the entire time she had the windows up until I told her she could roll them down again if she wanted. This just pissed me off because? I’m your friend? If the roles were reversed, or if it were anyone of my friends, I would’ve taken them home in the morning when I saw they were feeling so terrible, and I would DEFINITELY do anything to make a friend comfortable if they were feeling that way. Birthday or not. So that was a tipping point for me—and I also didn’t get home that night until 10pm. No time for the chores I needed to do before opening the next day. We didn’t talk for a couple weeks after this until…

The last instance, 2 weekends ago, we went to an even bigger city for yet another show, and took the train in. I found us a bed to sleep in at my friend’s house (24m) that lived there, let’s call him John, (yippee, free housing!!!) and was super excited. First day was great, show was great. That night, we were all hanging together with the friend we were staying with, plus our other friend, and Lin was completely uninvolved and on her phone the entire time. I was trying to steer the convo towards her or have her sit next to me so she was in the circle of convo, nothin’. She called it a night early and I continued hanging with them and let her go to bed. The next day was horse shit. 

We woke up and got breakfast the three of us, we mentioned how we generally had no plan for the day, so John suggested going shopping like 15/20 minutes away. We all agreed, packed it up, and left. On the way there, we had to stop and fix something on our scooters, and we were waiting on Lin for a moment. We then see her ride past us so we follow her and get back on the route. We go thru two intersections and we realize we cannot find Lin and wasn’t sure where she went. She calls me, “Where did you guys go?” which confused me cause I thought we were following her. She proceeds to tell me she “just took a lap around the block” while we were waiting on her. Not sure why you would do that if you have people waiting on you, but alas. John goes and retrieves her cause she can’t find her way, and we continue. Not even 5 minutes later, I wipe out pretty bad on one of those Lime scooters and rip my leg and hip up and I’m bleeding through my pants. John pulled me up and was trying to get me calm and see what I needed, Lin on the other hand was very elsewhere. Asked if I was okay in an odd tone—I just decided to get right back on and finish the journey so we could get to the Walgreens on that street and bandage myself up. We get there, are speed walking to said Walgreens, and Lin calls from behind, “where are you guys going?” I stop, let her know again, and she dips into another store. I pay no mind, she wasn’t vibing with my friends the night before so I figured she just needed a break. I really wasn’t pressed at this point, just wanted a bandaid. We keep walking, I bandage myself up, hit a few spots, and meet up with her again less than an hour later. When we meet up, her demeanor has changed. I’m pretty high energy, she’s cold and only responding to me with “Mhm!” with a tight lipped smile and I decide to continue on because I didn’t want to hash it out in the shoe store. John and I hit two more stores and then decide we’re done and should be heading back. I text her that John is ordering us the uber soon and that we should meet up and head out, and John and I find a lonely patio to sit at while we wait. Our train home was in an hour and a half at this point. She said okay, we wait, we wait…we wait. 30 minutes go by. John is getting antsy because he wants to go but Lin is nowhere to be found. I check her location, it says she is a two-minute walk away, so I tell John to order the uber cause she’s close and she’ll be here before it gets here. Well, she doesn’t show up, the uber gets there, and we have to walk across the street to catch it—and I see Lin sitting across the street at another patio. I run up to her, tell her the uber is there, and she says she’s waiting on her coffee. I look inside and see the busiest cafe ever, and was confused why she stopped for a coffee without telling us while we were waiting on her—and at the busiest cafe on the block no less. I tell her I’d throw the driver some money to wait for her, and she goes, “well you guys have been doing your own thing all day, why stop now?” I’m confused, because she was the one that broke off on our way to Walgreens, so I say that and she just says, “When?” with a shitty look on her face. I once again, am not down for a fight, so I tell her to let me know how much her uber is and I’ll pay for it, but I’ll see her back at the apartment. 

John and I get back to the apartment and I’m stunned, but start to pack because our train is in an hour at this point and the station is 30 away. I then realize the $350 worth of shit I just bought is nowhere to be found. I freak out, search the whole apartment and try to get ahold of our uber to no avail. Lin gets back in the middle of this, with 10 minutes to spare until we have to leave to catch the train. She is trying to fight with me whilst I’m freaking out about this shit, and I wave her off cause I just could not deal basically. I end up just not being able to find it, John says he’ll keep an eye out for it, and I’m bummed as hell. I order Lin and I an uber to the train, and we miss it. We have to wait an hour 45 for the next train, and I’m just sitting there in silence and calling my girlfriend because I’m crying cause it’s just been a terrible day. I don’t want to hash things out with Lin. If I’m being honest, after the last two instances, I had a feeling it was gonna go awry and I didn’t have the energy to fight with her. She says “So, we’re just not gonna talk?” and she begins to cry. Says I didn’t run any of the plans by her, that I left her out, that she doesn’t socialize well with boys so she didn’t feel comfortable hanging with them. Starts criticizing my friend who lent us the place to stay and saying he’s a “performative man.” That pissed me off. She also said I didn’t even ask if she was okay when we met up again when her mood shift, and I said I shouldn’t have to pull it out of her, and that I wished she would just tell me how she feels instead of reacting in animosity. She also agreed to the plans that morning, we all made the plans together at breakfast, so I just didn’t know where to go from there. We patch things up a little and get on our next train, and I have my gf pick me up at the station so Lin doesn’t have to drive me home, and we disperse. I tell her to text me when she gets home safe, she doesn’t, and we haven’t spoken since. That was 2 weeks ago now I believe. 

What has been bothering me the most is the lack of respect she has for my time. I am always waiting on her. Multiple times throughout the trip she was making us wait on her—the uber, the scooter. The trip before I waited on her to get ready, and then waited the whole day after for her to take me home against my wishes of being home early. Everything is always on her time. It’s like she doesn’t even consider me, and that she’s just living according to her own schedule. John said the same thing. She’s an only child also, which has been becoming more apparent the more I’ve pondered on this. All of this has made me feel pretty clueless when it comes to what I should do going forward. I don’t know whether to just leave it at that since we already haven’t spoken in weeks, or to talk to her about it. But then again, how do you tell someone a build up of instances that hurt you without attacking them? Or tell someone they have no respect for your time and that their only-child complex is showing? I really have no idea what to do. 

She really was my best friend and I have been ignoring the issue because I am at a loss. I care about her a lot, but as an adult I have become very “cut and dry” and when I sense disrespect on a non-minor scale, I’m gone. She has always backed me up in this, so the fact that it’s her now, is…strange? Is she just not realizing she’s being this way or does she not care?? Am I overreacting??

Like I said, super long, but thank you to anyone who has read the whole thing. I have been in the dumps about this for weeks, so any advice is appreciated. ",4,1761485356.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False

Two years after university I moved to London and completely fell in love with it. I ended up living there for eight years and they were some of the best years of my life. During uni I did a year abroad in Barcelona and always thought I would come back one day. After I met my partner (he is English) we decided to move to Barcelona last year, thinking it's a better place to have a family and for a more outdoors life.

We are both very lucky to have very good jobs in Spain, I have a great job in tech, my partner is working  for an english speaking agency in his field. Arguably we are both even better jobs now. Pay is almost the same (with much cheaper life here) working for companies that are very well recognised.

I know it's completely normal to take time to adjust to a place as I've been living abroad my whole life, but I am really missing my East London life. I miss the morning coffee walks, my friends, the food, my social life, the pubs and even my gym I reminisce about. I don't miss the politics, the crime, cold weather or the crazy cost of living.

I am now pregnant which is another big life transition and the cost of having a baby/kid here is incomparable. I am also on a much better tax regime for five years which means my taxes are considerably lower than UK for now. Brining kid up in Barcelona has a lot of benefits - it's a bit of a concrete jungle city but you are super close to the beach, the mountains and kids seem happier on the whole. But my spanish is still limited, by catalan is non-existnat, my close friends I have here cancel plans every sunday because of partying too hard the night before. I don't know I just really really miss London, although the thought of raising a kid there seems like really not a good one (a lot of our friends in London who are having kids are moving out anyway).

We've been looking at buying a house or a flat which is probably another point of pressure - feels like we are at the age when we should really be on the property ladder as we are loosing money ever year by not doing it, but it's so hard to commit to a place at these costs (700-850k) when I don't even feel sure this is our place.

[Palestinians released from Israeli prisons under the ceasefire agreement arriving at the Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip on October 13, 2025.. Other prisoners were sent to countries including Egypt. \(Photo: Getty Images\)](https://preview.redd.it/7h59ygx5jgxf1.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0bdaf1155a8de48f741c649aca8d89195c6cd375)

Some of the Palestinian terrorists freed by Israel as part of the US-brokered agreement with Hamas in the Gaza Strip stayed at Egypt’s Renaissance Cairo Mirage City Hotel following their release.

In a call with Kan News, the Cairo hotel initially denied that the former Palestinian prisoners were among its guests, claiming: “We only have customers here. I don’t check what each customer’s intentions are.”

However, when asked by the Israeli broadcaster if Mahmoud Issa, who founded the special kidnapping unit of Hamas’s military wing, was staying at the hotel, the representative answered in the affirmative.

Asked who was footing his bill, the representative answered, “Turks.”

Kan News reported that the former prisoners, who were deported by Israel due to the danger they pose to the public, were expected to be transferred out of Egypt in the near future. It was not immediately clear whether they were still staying at the hotel as of Sunday.

An undercover investigation by the *Daily Mail* published earlier on Saturday found that 150-plus terrorists freed as part of the deal were staying at the hotel, which is part of the Marriott International chain.

The *Daily Mail* said its reporters were able to book a hotel room without any warning of former security prisoners staying there at the same time.

The paper documented several senior Hamas terrorists staying at the hotel, including Mahmoud Issa, who had been jailed since 1993 for his part in the murder of a Border Police officer; Samir Abu Nima, who was sentenced to life in jail for a 1983 Jerusalem bus bombing that killed six people including an 11-year-old child; and Muhammad Zawahra, who took part in a deadly February 2024 shooting near Ma’ale Adumim.

Others staying at the luxury hotel included Islamic State terrorist Izz a-Din al-Hamamrah, who recruited suicide bombers, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad bus bomber Samir Abu Nima, according to the *Daily Mail*.

“Should you stay here and walk around the idyllic grounds, as the *Daily Mail* did, you will find that hateful eyes follow every step you take. None were more sinister than those of Issa, who sat menacingly sipping coffee on his poolside balcony, our movements never escaping his glare,” the report said.

The *Daily Mail* claimed that the released terrorist killers were slated to be moved to “nearby tourist destinations” including Qatar, Turkey and Tunisia, which it noted are “hugely popular with British holidaymakers.”

As part of the hostage deal, Israel agreed to free 1,950 Palestinian security prisoners, including 1,700 Palestinians arrested since October 7, 2023. Among them were 250 serving life sentences for deadly attacks.

David Mencer, a spokesman for the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office, told the *Daily Mail* on Saturday: “These men are terrorists, convicted of bombing buses, murdering students and kidnapping teenagers. Israel freed them not to reward evil but because we value human life above all.”

“A bitter price, but one our people have paid across the ages to reclaim kin from the hands of Jew-haters,” the government spokesman added.

It will become another living room for when friends come over for a drink or to watch a game. It's a very diffucult room, becasue the floor is ceramic tiling and the terrace will be enclosed by three sliding glass walls. He told me he wants to buy a Sonos setup, the Sonos immersive, as he told me he will spend around 2500 euro on it. I suggested there are better options. He was entertained by the ""easy"" wireless setup, and not having the need to run wires to the speakers, but it isn't much difference, as he still needs power plugs, and he is missing at least two at the speaker locations.  
  
The room is aroun 60sqm, and as I told you, 80% of the time he will play music. There will be an 8 seat table in one half of the room, and a TV on the wall and a sofa for watching movies in the other half. I can't suggest floorstanders because the entire TV wall will have a counter underneath spreading the entire span of the wall. Ususally the music he listens to is Techno (Black Coffee, Paco Osuna, Mahmut Orhan, etc.)  
  
I believe Sonos is not worth the money. But I can be wrong, so please tell me if I am. With the current Black Friday pricelist (I already have it from one of the AV Stores in my country), for the same price I can get:  
Monitor Audio Silver 100 7G  
Montior Audio SIlver 50 7G  
SVS SB1000 Pro  
Denon X1800h - AirPlay functionality is a must  
  
Or I can go for KEF Q3 Meta, but they are more expensive with the current pricelist. He loved my KEF R500.  
  
Or I can go for cheaper, like two pairs of Monitor Audio Bronze 100 and there is enough money left for a central speaker.

What was once marketed as “relatable” now feels like a sitcom written by a committee of straight white men who think fat jokes are character development and transphobia is edgy humor.

Monica’s entire backstory? Fatphobic punchline. Chandler’s dad? A trans woman played by a cis woman and treated like a walking gag. And let’s not even start on the racial diversity, unless you count the occasional background extra who got half a line before vanishing forever. It’s like New York City was populated exclusively by white people with commitment issues and perfect hair.

And yet, Friends was the blueprint for mainstream comedy for years. We laughed, we quoted, we all wanted to get coffee at Central Perk. But watching it now? It’s a crash course in everything feminism has been pushing back against for decades.

I've been looking to upgrade but there are SOOOO many options (budget under $2000 USD).

Open to advice, suggestions, and do i need to be spending $2000 for a machine, or is there a combo for half the price to get the same taste?

I found out about my wife’s affair three months ago (DDay), from the other betrayed spouse (OBS). My wife is pregnant, and her affair was with a coworker. I have little doubt about the paternity though. 

They had met up for coffee a few times — once while I was home watching our three kids — and also spent time together at an Airbnb and in a vehicle. I remember one morning vividly: I was in bed, waiting excitedly for her to come home from her night shift. Usually, I don’t get to see her after those shifts, but I had a late start that day. She didn’t show up. At first, I wasn’t too worried since ER shifts can run long. Then I got a Facebook message from the OBs explaining why she was really late. It also stings because she started the physical affair right as I found out I was losing my job. 

first I didn’t believe it was possible. When I confronted her, she admitted to a tiny fraction of the truth, and more details trickled out slowly over time. She’s never done anything like this before, and she seems genuinely remorseful and committed to working on things. We’ve done about eight sessions of marriage counseling.

Still, I get triggered often — sometimes just waking up in the morning or when her shifts run late.

We’ve been through so much together: we dated through college, got married young, made it through med school and residency (7–9 years of training), and now have three — soon to be four — children.

I feel like I need someone to talk to who won’t take sides. Honestly, the only person I can think of is her mother. She’s the kind, church-secretary type — level-headed, compassionate, and she’s actually been through reconciliation with her own WS. 

Am I crazy for wanting to talk to my MIL about what’s going on? And if not, how do I even bring this up with my wife? She has been pretty resistant to telling anyone at this point. And the only person I have talked to lives 14 hours away, and is 100% on my side. ",17,1761483962.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,11,0.9,False

Most my young life, I (34m) lived in a small village, where the only thing one could do was going walking in the forest, and especially in rainy seasons or winter, I was staying at home.

Growing up and now working, I ended up living in bigger cities, however I find myself always spending most of my time alone at home. I rarely go out if I don't have a specifi reason, be it to go to work, buying groceries, going to the gym/climbing, or meeting friends. I never go to the ""city centre"" walking around.

But then people keep telling me that to meet new people you need to go out, which is true.... But to do what? I don't see the point in going to a coffee shop alone, especially because I don't even drink coffee and if I want a cake I usually bake it at home.

We had to get the cover of the tank fixed so we sent it … but it got lost and impossible to get it back. We cannot find this specific piece to buy, it never seems to be compatible. Our tank need a piece with 9 holes… but from what we saw, it is always sold with 8 or 12 holes.

We cannot simply go to an metal store to make it because it needs some specific holes for the resistance.

Does anyone have an idea of how we can make this machine work again by helping us finding that missing piece ?

I live in a building that doesn’t collect compost for a few reasons. It would increase the maintenance fees since we’d need more staff to deal with this (no one be willing to pay higher condo fees), the staff would also have to monitor it to make sure people aren’t tossing non-compostable items in there (people suck and just treat it as regular garbage), etc. 

As a small family, I’d love if we could collect our compost in the small countertop collectors and be able to drop off the bag somewhere that won’t be a hassle. It won’t be much since we’re 3 people but even a small bag every week or 2 would make me feel a bit better since I know it would go back into the environment. It would mostly just be used coffee grains and tea bags, and food scraps to a lesser extent. 

We toyed with the idea of filling a small bag and then finding a drop off point that wouldn’t be too much of a hassle, but we’re finding it hard honestly. We don’t want to do the eco centre since we’re sometimes w aited close to an hour in the lineup so it’s not feasible on a regular basis. We’ve also tried keeping an eye out for public bins that could have compost sections but those mostly tend to be in malls or downtown, and we don’t want to carry around a bag of compost that far. We’ve considered maybe tossing it in a house’s compost bin on collection day but we know a lot of people could take that the wrong way since nobody wants their garbage meddled with, but also the smell of opening one of these would be horrendous on a hot day. 

Is there anywhere convenient we could drop off a small bag weekly/biweekly that wouldn’t be too much of an inconvenience, like near a grocery store or consignaction?

It’s time to take Kendu beyond the charts — into the real world.

We’re launching a community-driven marketing initiative to promote all Kendu’s real-world products — coffee, merch, energy drinks, and more — through top creators on YouTube, X, TikTok, and Reddit.

The goal is simple:
Focus on products first, let the adoption tell the crypto story.

By driving sales of these IRL products, each participating project can pledge to give back — whether that’s through token burns, buybacks, or treasury contributions. This creates a direct, sustainable feedback loop between Kendu’s brand success and its token ecosystem.

Here’s how it works:

🎥 Influencers share their own Kendu product links and earn a small affiliate reward whenever their link drives a purchase.

💸 Buyers get exclusive discounts for supporting Kendu through creator links.

🔥 Kendu gains exposure across audiences, growing its holder base and reinforcing value organically.


This is adoption done differently — where every sip of coffee, every tote bag, and every share helps grow the Kendu brand and its ecosystem together.

Let’s make Kendu the brand that built its coin through community-powered creativity.
Join the conversation, pitch influencer names, or volunteer your project for inclusion.
Let’s take Kendu viral — one product, one post, one person at a time.",14,1761483332.0,KenduInu_Ecosystem,0,1.0,False

1ogjvmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreabanking/comments/1ogjvmb/why_i_stopped_using_my_home_country_bank_card_in/,Why I Stopped Using My Home Country Bank Card in Korea,"Alright, confession time.

For my first six months in Korea, I was that person. You know the one — pulling out my US/UK/Australian bank card at every convenience store, every restaurant, every coffee shop, thinking I was being ""smart"" by avoiding the hassle of opening a Korean bank account.

I thought I was winning. Turns out, I was hemorrhaging money like an idiot.

Let me show you exactly how much this ""convenience"" was costing me, and why I finally made the switch. Spoiler alert: the math is painful.

# The ""Convenient"" Lie I Told Myself

When I first arrived in Seoul, opening a Korean bank account felt like climbing Mount Everest.

You need an ARC card (which takes weeks), you have to navigate a bank branch where maybe one person speaks English, fill out forms that look like they were designed to confuse you, and then figure out how to actually USE the account through apps that are, let's just say not foreigner-friendly.

So I did what felt easier: ""I'll just use my home country card. It works everywhere! Plus, my bank said 'no foreign transaction fees!'""

Famous last words.

Here's what I didn't understand back then:

**""No foreign transaction fees"" doesn't mean ""No fees at all""**

And even if there are truly no fees, you're still getting absolutely destroyed by something most people don't even notice.

# The Hidden Costs Nobody Warns You About

Let me break down exactly where your money disappears when you use a foreign card in Korea.

# Cost #1: The ""Dynamic Currency Conversion"" Scam

Picture this: You're at Olive Young buying ₩50,000 worth of skincare (because when in Korea, right?).

The card reader asks: **""Pay in KRW or \[your currency\]?""**

You think: ""Oh, I'll pay in dollars/pounds/euros, at least I'll know exactly what I'm spending!""

**WRONG. THIS IS A TRAP.**

When you choose to pay in your home currency, the merchant's payment processor converts it at THEIR exchange rate, which is typically 3-7% worse than the actual rate.

Real example from last week:

* Item cost: ₩50,000
* Actual exchange rate: 1,420 KRW/USD = $35.21
* DCC exchange rate: 1,320 KRW/USD = $37.88

**You just paid $2.67 extra for the ""convenience"" of seeing USD.**

Multiply that by every transaction, every day, for months. Yeah.

# Cost #2: ATM Fees (The Double-Whammy)

Need cash? Let's say you withdraw ₩200,000.

Here's what you're actually paying:

1. Korean ATM fee: ₩3,500-5,000 (that popup you click through without reading)
2. Your home bank's ""international ATM fee"": $3-5
3. Foreign transaction fee: 1-3% of withdrawal (even if they said ""no foreign transaction fees"" for purchases)

So on a ₩200,000 withdrawal (roughly $140):

* Korean ATM: ₩5,000 ($3.50)
* Your bank: $5.00
* FX fee: $4.20 (3%)
* Total cost: $12.70, which is like 9% fee

You just paid $12.70 to access your own money.

# Cost #3: The Exchange Rate Markup (The Invisible Killer)

Even without DCC, even without obvious fees, your bank is making money on the exchange rate itself.

Here's how:

* Real mid-market rate (what banks trade at): 1,420 KRW/USD
* What your bank actually gives you: 1,380 KRW/USD
* Markup: 2.8%

This applies to EVERY transaction. It's invisible. It's automatic. And it adds up fast.

# Cost #4: The ""Declined Transaction Anxiety Fee""

Okay, this one doesn't have a dollar amount, but let's talk about it.

You're at a restaurant with coworkers. Bill comes. You hand over your card.

Declined.

""Try again?""

Declined.

Now everyone's staring. You're sweating. You mumble something about ""calling my bank"" while someone else covers you.

You call your bank at 3am their time. ""Oh, we flagged it as suspicious. Can you confirm you're in Korea?""

""YES. I'VE BEEN HERE FOR THREE MONTHS.""

""Okay, we've unlocked it. But you should've told us you were traveling.""

""I DID. TWICE.""

This happened to me four times before I gave up.

# The Real Math: What It Actually Cost Me

Let me show you my actual spending over my first 6 months using my home country card.

Monthly expenses (conservative estimate):

* Rent: ₩900,000 (paid via bank transfer, kept home account for this)
* Food/drinks: ₩600,000 (card)
* Transport: ₩150,000 (T-money, but recharged via card)
* Shopping/misc: ₩400,000 (card)
* Cash withdrawals: ₩200,000/month x 2 = ₩400,000

Total monthly card spending: around ₩1,550,000 (roughly $1,100)

Cost breakdown per month:

* Exchange rate markup (2.8%): $30.80
* ATM fees (2 withdrawals): $25.40
* DCC catches (maybe 30% of transactions, 5% markup): $16.50
* Random ""international transaction fees"" my bank snuck in: $8.00

Total monthly loss: $80.70 Total over 6 months: $484.20

That's almost ₩700,000.

Do you know what I could've done with ₩700,000? That's like 2 months of phone bills, a weekend trip to Jeju, half a year of gym membership. Or just, not giving it to banks for literally nothing.

# What Changed When I Finally Got a Korean Bank Account

Month 7: I finally dragged myself to Shinhan Bank, got my account opened (yes, it was annoying, but took like 40 minutes total), and linked my Korean debit card to everything.

Here's what happened:

# The Immediate Wins

No more ATM fees - I can use any Korean ATM for free (or ₩500-1,000 max at some)

No more declined transactions - Korean cards just WORK everywhere in Korea (shocking concept, I know)

No more exchange rate markups - I'm spending in KRW, earning in KRW (after salary deposit), so no conversion happening

No more DCC traps - Paying in KRW always, no questions asked

# The Unexpected Bonuses

Cashback/points that actually work - My Shinhan card gives me points at GS25, CU, Olive Young. My foreign card gave me nothing useful in Korea.

App integration - Naver Pay, Kakao Pay, Coupang Pay, all work seamlessly with Korean cards. Foreign cards? Good luck.

Easier money management - Bank app shows everything in KRW. No more ""wait, how much did I actually spend in dollars this month?""

Building credit history - Apparently matters if you ever want to get a phone plan, lease an apartment, or get a Korean credit card later.

# The New Monthly Cost: around ₩3,000

Literally. My Korean bank account costs me about ₩3,000/month in fees (and that's only because I have a specific account type, many are free).

Compare that to the $80/month I was losing before.

# ""But What About Sending Money Home?""

Okay, I hear you. ""I need to keep my home bank account anyway to send money back to family/save in my currency/whatever.""

You're absolutely right. Keep your home bank account. I still have mine.

But here's the smarter setup:

1. Salary goes to Korean bank account (no fees, direct deposit)
2. Daily spending from Korean debit/credit card (no fees, local currency)
3. Once a month, transfer whatever you need to home country (using proper transfer service, not bank wire)

This way:

* You're not paying conversion fees on every coffee
* You control WHEN you convert KRW to your currency (can wait for good rates)
* You only pay transfer fees once a month, not on every transaction

Pro tip: Don't use your home bank for the transfer either. Use a proper service (not naming names, but you know... services that compare rates and stuff). Bank wire transfers are ridiculously expensive.

# When Using Your Home Card DOES Make Sense

Look, I'm not saying NEVER use your foreign card. There are legit situations:

Emergency backup - Card stolen? Phone died? Good to have a backup that's not Korean

Online shopping from home country sites - Amazon, etc. sometimes don't accept Korean cards

Travel outside Korea - Going to Japan/Thailand? Your home card might be more convenient

Large one-time purchases - If your home card has good travel insurance or purchase protection

But for day-to-day life in Korea? You're just burning money.

# The Real Reason I Resisted (And Why You Might Too)

Here's the uncomfortable truth:

**Getting a Korean bank account felt like admitting I was really staying.**

As long as I used my home country card, I could pretend this was temporary. Just a fun adventure. Not my ""real life.""

Opening a Korean bank account felt like commitment. Like this was actually my home now.

And that felt scary.

But you know what's scarier? Realizing you've wasted $500+ because you were too stubborn or nervous to spend 40 minutes at a bank.

# How to Actually Open a Korean Bank Account (The Reality)

Since I know this is what's stopping most of you, here's the actual process:

What you need:

* Alien Registration Card (ARC)
* Passport
* Korean phone number
* Your sanity

Where to go:

* Kakao Bank (app-only, easiest for foreigners)
* KB Kookmin, Shinhan, Woori (English-speaking branches exist)

Time it takes:

* App banks: 10-15 minutes
* Physical banks: 30-60 minutes

English support:

* Kakao Bank app is mostly in English
* Big banks have English hotlines
* Bring a Korean-speaking friend if you're nervous (I did)

Is it annoying? Yes. Is it worth it? Absolutely.

# Bottom Line

I spent 6 months thinking I was being smart and efficient.

I was actually being lazy and expensive.

The moment I stopped using my home country bank card for everyday spending in Korea, I saved around $80/month. That's $960/year. That's a round-trip flight home. That's 2 months of rent. That's money you're just giving away to banks for no reason.

If you're planning to be in Korea for more than 3 months, the math is simple:

Cost of foreign card: around $500+ in 6 months Cost of Korean card: Maybe $20 in 6 months

Stop making the same mistake I did.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Feyenoord vs. PSV Eindhoven: A Clash of Titans with a Side of Sausage**

The Eredivisie’s title race has tightened into a neck-wrenching tug-of-war between Feyenoord and PSV Eindhoven, and their October 26 showdown at De Kuip feels less like a football match and more like a WWE championship bout. Let’s break down the numbers, news, and why this game might end with one team celebrating and the other wondering if their coffee was poisoned.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Statistical Tightrope

The bookmakers are playing it close to the vest, with **Feyenoord** as a slight favorite at decimal odds of \~2.35 (implied probability: \~43%) and **PSV Eindhoven** hovering around 2.7 (implied: \~37%). The draw? A tidy 3.8 (implied: \~26%), which feels low for a rivalry where neither team knows how to share the spotlight.

Feyenoord’s +19 goal difference (25 goals in, 6 out) is the statistical equivalent of a fortress. Their 7-0 thrashing of Heracles Almelo last time out wasn’t just a win—it was a mercy rule. PSV, meanwhile, has the swagger of a team that just beat Napoli 6-2 in the Champions League, which is like showing up to a barbecue with a 10-pound brisket when everyone else brought store-bought chips. Confidence is high, but can they translate that to a league game where Feyenoord’s defense is tighter than a dutch oven?

---

### Recent News: No Major Injuries, But Plenty of Drama

No blockbuster injury reports here—both teams are relatively healthy, which is either a blessing or a warning sign that the real drama is psychological. Feyenoord’s recent form reads like a horror movie for defenders: 7-0, 3-1, 2-1… you get the picture. They’re scoring like it’s their job (it is) and defending like they’ve installed a moat around De Kuip.

PSV’s saving grace? That 6-2 Napoli drubbing. It’s the footballing equivalent of a confidence-boosting spa day—refreshing, invigorating, and slightly suspicious. But let’s not forget:

1ogjphv,https://i.redd.it/m9952edfcgxf1.jpeg,Castenada (Part 29),"*Decomposition of the Waking World, 1993, by Blu Deepwater.*

Jean slept on her side with one hand under her cheek, hair fanned against my forearm. When I eased my arm free, she stirred and reached for me without looking. I kissed the heel of her hand and tucked the blanket up under her chin. I slid from the bed and she rolled into the warm hollow I left. Her belly had swollen quickly since the last doctor’s appointment and little Lara was due any day now. On the dresser, beside the little bowl where she kept bobby pins, my tie lay folded with the knot already coaxed into shape so I wouldn’t fight it in the mirror. I dressed without turning on the light, the room blue with the first seep of morning. When I finished, I bent and kissed the hairline at her temple, then lower, her mouth. On the way out, I quietly peered into Joshua’s room to make sure he was sound asleep. I let myself out of the house and closed the door gently behind me.

A month had passed since the last time I had been to The Bunker. I told myself that I wouldn’t go back. I told myself so many versions that when the morning finally arrived, I was helpless to avoid driving to the facility. I couldn’t let Langstrom destroy all the progress I had made. I couldn’t let two years of my life be tossed out to embolden a man who had clearly lost his grasp on reality. I will admit, the phenomenon that surrounds the glyphs still evades me, but there is a demarcation between curiosity and obsession that Langstrom had long since crossed since Project Summerhouse’s inception.

When I arrived at the facility, there was no guard at the security checkpoint. The card reader’s light, once a temperamental red, was dark. Power, maybe, had never returned after the last outage. The fluorescents beyond the glass were dead, banding the corridor in a soft green from the exit signs and the fish-belly pallor of light leaking through the high clerestory windows. I pressed my badge against the reader anyway, out of habit more than hope. Nothing. There was no sound save for the ticking of the clock on the wall. When it became ridiculous to pretend someone might arrive, I swung my body over the turnstile. “Hello? Anyone?” Silence.

I pressed forward, shoes clicking on the epoxy floor. At the bend came a sound: a wet percussive ticking, followed by the slow exhale of valves. Then, it rounded the corner. A body of brushed steel and rubberized canvas cinched in rings, elbows sheathed in concertina joints, a spine of braided hose pulsing faintly with fluid. Where a head should have been, a cylindrical jar sat cradled in a gimbal. The glass beaded with condensation, yellow lamplight caught inside it. A fetus floated there, waxen and hairless. Around the collar a speaker box was bolted, stenciled in white with a string I recognized from the glyph indices. The thing halted three paces off with the hush of seals seating. The speaker woke with a crackle. At first it was a wash of static, then a voice flattened to pure function: *“Dr. Li, please remain calm. You were expected.”*

“What the fuck?” I pivoted hard and ran back for the turnstile. I got two strides before a shutter dropped from the ceiling with the blunt punctuation of metal meeting metal. The thing advanced. Its braided spine pulsed in a slow peristalsis. Its jar swung in the gimbal to keep the little pale body level as it drifted in its yellow bath; condensation slid in slow tears down the glass. I backed until my shoulder blades found the shutter’s cold surface.

The thing stopped an arm’s length away and tilted the jar until the fetus within seemed to turn its face toward me. One hand floated up as if to touch the glass from inside. *“Dr. Li, your pulse is elevated and your breathing is shallow. We are not here to harm you. We are here to escort you.”*

I tried to maintain what little distance I could while attempting to catch my breath. “Where is Dr. Langstrom?”

The fetus turned in a slow curl. *“Dr. Langstrom is in convergence. We will guide you.”*

It led and I followed, because there was nowhere else to go. The jar’s dull saffron glow was the only light left in the dark. The farther we went the more the ceiling tiles sagged into wet pendulous sacs beaded with condensate that tapped a metronome of leaking fluid. The floor softened to a springy mat that took our shoeprints and slowly filled with clear ooze. The walls blushed with a fine bloom like mildew, then thickened into suede nap and veined itself with pale hyphae that stitched the casings of dead fluorescents. We turned through a corridor that had been straight now bowed as if bent around some unnameable mass, and at its crook a second figure waited: its body a blown vessel of glass articulated at shoulder and hip, the chambers within full of clear fluid where soft organs hung on delicate ligatures. Where its head should have been, a CRT sat, and when it turned toward me the phosphor woke with a slow wash and locked into a black-and-white image of the face of a woman with her mouth at rest, until the vertical hold steadied, and then the lips moved a fraction behind the sound. *“Welcome back, Dr. Li.”*

The entity reached across to the canvas-and-steel escort that had brought me, its translucent hands cupping the jar cradle. The clasps unlatched with a damp kiss and the cylinder came free trailing a handful of slender leads. The being turned with the jar in its grip and found, in the wall, a recessed cavity and pressed the jar into it. The door on the far end dripped open. The suit that had carried the jar slackened around its hoops as if a body had gone out of it and from the seams and vents poured a tide of small warm bodies: guinea pigs. At first a handful and then more than I could count, damp-furred and bright-eyed, their nails ticking like sleet on the floor as they scattered under consoles and along the baseboards.

Beyond the threshold the room opened up and at its center sat Langstrom. He was throned in a chair grown from a knot of pallid tentacles braided into armrests, pleating and unpleating in slow respiration under his thighs. Banks of CRTs ringed him at different heights, each screen jittering with the glyphs in columns that shed their places and reassembled midfall. Where a keyboard should have been, an organ pulsed from the console. A slick rosette of tendinous cords threaded into the soft webbing between Langstrom’s fingers and vanished under the cuffs of his shirt. “Yu, I was hoping you’d come back. Come on in.”

I felt my heart pounding in my chest. “What the hell is all this, Langstrom? None of this should be possible.”

“But it *is* possible.” Langstrom’s voice had lost the edge of command it once carried and now it trembled with something closer to awe. “I never told you, Yu, but after the ONR pulled the plug, a private financier took on funding Project Summerhouse for the purpose of us building him a sequence that would grant him immortality. I’d hardly believed it myself, but he insisted that for centuries, he’s survived by transferring himself into his descendants. But somewhere along the line, I found something else. Something bigger. It’s a realm that exists parallel to ours, where there’s no death, no sense of time, no sequence of before or after. I thought we could learn from it.” He stood, the chair’s pale tendrils loosening with a wet sigh.

“This is insane. What you’re saying is completely insane. This defies all logical reasoning. There’s no causal framework for this!”

Langstrom smiled faintly. “That’s because you’re still thinking in Newtonian space. From what I can surmise, the glyphs act as boundary conditions. When placed in a precise order, they instruct an embedding into a higher-dimensional manifold. The boundary shifts and matter reconfigures where our world intersects it.” Langstrom turned back to the stack of monitors. “I’m running a controlled analogue of the dream-talkers’ rituals through the algorithm. The goal is an aperture. A portal to the other world long enough to characterize it.”

I found I was already stepping backward. “You want to open a portal? Wh-what is this? Look around you, Langstrom! Look at all this shit! You don’t know what will cross over when it opens!”

The glass-bodied attendant was on me before I saw it move. Its hands came up like calipers and closed on my forearms. *“Please remain.”*

I pulled and felt bone in my wrist grind under its grip. “Let go! Hezekiah, let it- *let me go!*”

Langstrom didn’t look away from the ring of screens. “I can feel your hesitation. Just like I could feel everyone else’s before I had them repurposed.”

I twisted hard, rolling my wrist until the bones threatened to shear. The glass thing adjusted with me. I shoved my shoulder into its chest and felt the slosh of its inner chambers surge against my arm like a wave. The seam of its elbow joint met the edge of the console and I jammed down with both hands. Glass popped with a sharp crack. Clear fluid gushed across my sleeve and the creature’s grip slackened just enough for me to rip free. I bolted out of the chamber. I tore through the threshold and into the corridor at a dead sprint. Behind me, the glass thing gathered itself with a wet clatter.

The corridor pitched underfoot, tiles ballooning with trapped air that popped under my heels and exhaled ammoniac breath. Wall panels had softened into translucent bladders that pulsed with slow, uterine light with eel-slick shapes cruising within them. Blood was dripping from my wrist and soaking into the sleeve of my lab coat. I could feel myself slowly getting dizzy as the pain shot through me like lightning. At this point pure adrenaline was fueling me through the labyrinthine depths. My only compulsion, my light at the end of the tunnel, was getting home to my family. It was getting to live to see the birth of my daughter, closing that stupid restaurant, moving back to California, watching Joshua try out for softball, watching Jean get old with me, watching Lara develop a personality. I refused to be meat.

I could hear the loud footfalls of metal against squelching rubber just behind me as I rounded seemingly endless corridors that never existed before. Before long, I found myself nearing a door that looked like the one leading to the mess hall. I readied my badge, not even taking into consideration whether or not my credentials still worked. I pressed it to the magnetic reader and I heard a soft click as it unlocked. I managed to get in with enough time to close the door behind me. Though the door had been made with an aluminum alloy, I knew it wouldn’t hold for long.

The furnishings of this room looked similar to the ones I was more accustomed to. A coffee machine, a refrigerator, chairs stacked on top of tables, and Larkin’s defective hot plate. However, there was something odd about it. Everything was slightly discolored in a way, either being too vivid or being more muted in tone. Legs of chairs shined like polished chrome, the off-white wallpaper was now a deepening stained yellow, and the hot plate had an inexplicable rainbow vibrance to it that was only perceptible when the lenses of my glasses caught it at just the right angle. Of course, this wasn’t nearly as off-putting as the horrors I had already witnessed, but the mundanity of it felt deeply *wrong*. I couldn’t explain it beyond that feeling and the more I tried to unravel it, the more oppressive it felt.

I made my way to the back door, one that I assumed still led into a corridor with bathrooms at one end of a hallway and a floor of joint offices since converted into storage for old equipment. However, as I swung it open, I instead saw a hallway with walls of writhing, violet worms. I wanted to turn back, but then I could hear the metallic clanging at the other end of the messhall. With little choice left, I pushed forward into a room illuminated with orange light.


_____________________________________________

I could feel the pulsating dampness all over me, as things wriggled across my entire body and threatened to push into my nostrils and mouth. Any sensation of standing upright, where the center gravity was, or even what direction I was moving in was totally suspended. I couldn’t be certain that I wasn’t followed, but I knew I had no other choice but to keep walking towards the pulsating orange aperture that would periodically dilate. Every muscle was tensed and exhausted by the effort it took to move through the space, every nerve seemed to tingle with a wet and wriggling sensation. I couldn’t be certain how much time had passed between each motion, each beleaguered breath between dilations, but I eventually found myself in a circular room I had never seen before.

The walls were decorated with hundreds if not thousands of framed paintings in a myriad of styles, some seemed to simply sit on the carpeted floor and lean against the wall. There were various Victorian furnishings, upholstered with forest green cushioning and where the wood was visible, it had been elaborately carved with complex patterns and designs. Running across the floor were dozens of electrical cables centered on a tall-legged small circular table and a drafting table beside it. Atop the circular table sat a rotary telephone and single red-shaded antique lamp beside it. Affixed to the drafting table was a bizarre and bulky machine that looked something like an old telephone circuit board intermingled with superfluous devices of indistinguishable purpose or function along with vacuum tubes that flashed with electricity. Between them was an elevated upholstered chair with a tall back. Beyond these was a massive, roaring fireplace. I looked around, but couldn’t see any doors. Even the way I came seemed to have disappeared, replaced instead with a painting of what looked like a painting of a peacock my mother had in our home prior to me leaving Taiwan for California. Quietly, music began to play. 

The velvety pop of vinyl intermarried with the crack of burning logs. It was “Love Me Tender” by Elvis Presley. A song that I distinctly remember playing at a hole in the wall I took Jean to many years ago. I doubt she remembers it was playing, she was telling me about an audition she was going for and how much preparation she had been doing in the best Mandarin she could manage. Every time I have ever heard that song it reminds me of another time, of a light in her eyes I’ve since watched dim ever so slightly. Perhaps my own light had faded and she too could see it.

“You, Chinaman!” a voice called. “You speak English?”

I turned to see a middle-aged white man I had never seen before, his tattered clothes were completely wet. His features were tired, worn, and disheveled like he had been drinking nonstop for days.

“Yes, I speak English.” I said, adding *‘húndàn’* to the end of that sentence in my head. “What is this place? Are you a colleague of Langstrom’s?”

“Who in the blue blazes is Langstrom?” he asked. “I was going to ask you if you knew what this place was. Last thing I knew, I was in an old bar downtown and then some woman posing as Sam told me something about giving something to an operator and not letting something in, but I don’t understand what any of that meant.”

“Bar downtown?” I asked. “Are you talking about The Bear Arms? I’ve seen you there before, you said there was a Sam?”

“No, not The Bear Arms,” he insisted as he began to look around. “Sam is the only proprietor whom I know sells liquor in Castenada. His bar is named after him.”

“I don’t know a bar of that name downtown.” I said. “You said you’re from Castenada? Castenada, Oregon?”

“Originally Chicago, I was only here for work. What sort of hypnotic delusion is this?”

“Hypnosis?” I was sort of aware of an earlier incarnation of Project Summerhouse that worked in connection with another CIA-backed agency and that it was originally designated for the purpose of hypnotic suggestion and interrogation, but a lot of that was done prior to my involvement with the program and perhaps even Langstrom’s. “Who is it that you work for exactly?”

“A man named James Barker, or The Amazing Amsi if you prefer. He’s a…”

“Stage magician?” I asked.

“Yeah, you’ve seen his act?”

“No,” I said, somewhat confused. “Liam Randolph died long before I ever moved to Castenada. Just how old are you?”

He looked at me for a long while before answering, his mouth hung slightly agape as though debating in his head how to respond. “What are you?”

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“None of this makes any sense, I keep seeing people who… They don’t make sense. They shouldn’t be. People from the past, but also people from times I haven’t experienced. People I don’t even think Barker, or *Liam Randolph*, knows, no matter how strange his company often is. How do you know him? Why are you telling me that he’s dead?”

“I don’t personally know the Amazing Amsi,” I said. “I only ever read about him in a book at the library. Let me ask you this, what year do you think it is?”

“It’s 1936,” he stated matter-of-factly. “What book are you talking about?”

“I don’t know how to tell you this, but it’s 1981.” I said. “I read about him and his cult in a history book.”

“That’s… That’s impossible. There’s no…” He seemed to realize how ridiculous his train of thought was and dropped it. “So *who* are you?”

“My name is Yu Li.” I answered. I decided not to reveal any confidential information, even though I supposed the concept of a computer programmer would be something he wouldn’t fully grasp anyway. “I own a restaurant called The Red Lotus. In your time, it was a walk-up place that served soup and coffee. Then that place was torn down, and a new restaurant was built on the same land. Then that restaurant closed, a new owner took over, and so on for years until my wife and I took over.”

In truth, I didn’t buy the restaurant. The US government technically did, along with a number of other shell employers to cover any involvement with Project Summerhouse. It was more of a passing hobby I engaged with and it seemed to keep Jean busy until she was pregnant with Joshua and now Lara.

“So, you mean to tell me that rotten old bastard who overcharged me for coffee had his den of opulence torn down?” he smirked at this. “Serves him right.”

“And who are you?” I asked finally.

“Well, I am Joseph Merriam. An author of weird fiction and ghost stories, primarily. Perhaps you’re familiar with my work?”

“I’m sorry, no.” I said.

“Ah, well… Never mind.” His shoulders stooped somewhat, his eyes drifting back to the decor. “I’m nobody important then.”

“To be honest, I don’t read much horror.” I tried to reassure him. “I couldn’t tell you the difference between Stephen King and Edgar Allen Poe if you put stories of theirs in front of me.”

“Who the hell is Stephen King?” Joseph asked.

“Right…” I turned my attention to the more pressing matter at hand. “You say this is the result of some kind of hypnosis?”

“I don’t claim anything. This is just what I was told by a woman posing as a bartender. Myself and Matilda Trice were apparently placed under hypnosis and whoever she was managed to intercept me before I slipped further under Bar- uh, Randolph’s control.”

“Earlier you mentioned an operator?” I asked. “What was it you were supposed to give to them?”

Joseph reached into his coat pocket and retrieved a maroon napkin. He unfolded it and examined it with a furrowed brow before handing it to me. I gently lowered my injured hand a moment, blood dripping onto the floor as I accepted the napkin. What I saw caused my heart to sink in my chest. It was three of the runes I had catalogued. How was this possible? Don Johan’s diary would have been somewhere in Germany by 1936, if Langstrom is to be believed and the runes in Tatonga Cave wouldn’t be found for nearly thirty years. Who was this woman?

“You seem to know something about those symbols, Mr. Li.” Joseph said evenly. “I would suggest you cough up what you have.”

Before I could even begin to offer an explanation, someone or something had entered the room with us. His tall and slender frame suggested maybe a person, but the moment I actually saw him I was certain that wasn’t the case. He wore brown trousers, slippers, and a red satin smoking jacket which is where his human affectations began and stopped. His head was that of some kind of cephalopod, possibly an octopus or cuttlefish. His hands, or whatever they were, terminated in an uncountable number of long digits and vestigial phalanges with far too many knuckles for a human hand. Between each of his tentacles were a number of what looked like hooked teeth that flared and retracted reflexively like cat’s claws. He quietly filed past us and took his seat beside the machine before the hearth.

*The man at the controls had returned.*

Joseph cleared his throat to get the thing’s attention, but it proceeded to ignore us both as its many fingers set to the task of hitting switches, unplugging and replugging wires, turning cranks, pulling levers, hitting keys, and manipulating semi-organic surfaces. The vacuum tubes sparked and flashed with growing intensity as he worked. An immense, bass-heavy roar thundered through the walls and slightly rattled the frames of the many paintings on the wall, knocking some over.

“E-excuse me,” Joseph continued. “Can you hear me?”

The thing continued to work. The lightbulb in the lamp suddenly flickered before eventually illuminating the room. I could see now that the walls of this room extended upward without any ceiling to stop them from ascending infinitely into darkness. The thing slowed its movements as the roar turned to more of a dull drone. He relaxed into the seat of his chair at last. He had no discernible eyes, so it was impossible for me to determine if or how he saw us, but it felt as though we were being perceived somehow. I slowly approached the thing and with a quivering hand, I motioned to give him the napkin. Without a word, the napkin instantly disintegrated in my hand, turning to a puff of ash. The rotary phone began to ring.

The Operator picked it up. He listened for a moment as a voice spoke from the other end. His head nodded, his tentacles curling and flexing slightly. At last his claw-teeth flared, a disjointed and wet voice rippling from some hidden orifice.

*“Station 271, Manifold HZ-586 to Manifold UB-520. One to transport. One at Station 271 without necessary credentials, requesting a Type-3 logician or of a greater order. 4802-AE-91. Affirmative. Negative. Affirmative. End of transmission.”*

The Operator hung up the receiver and began working the machine again before settling back into his chair. I looked at Joseph who wore an expression I assumed I also had. One of utter confusion.

“Who is the one being transported?” I asked the Operator.

The Operator raised a hand and pointed at Joseph.

“And why do I need a Type-3 logician?” I asked.

The Operator pointed at a painting of a fresco, one that looked like a recreation or perhaps stylistic imitation of a much older piece by some Bronze Age civilization. It showed multiple circles within circles, showing figures in cycles of aging, pregnancy, illness, decay, suffering. At the center was the profile of a humanoid figure, one with a snake for a tail, the legs of a goat, feathers for hair, and curving tusks. It had three eyes from what I could see and two sets of wings. The piece reminded me of certain depictions I had seen of the Wheel of Life when I was a boy. However, it did little to answer my question.

“What is that supposed to mean?” Joseph asked, only to receive no answer from The Operator.

“Whatever it is, I’m not sure that I’m willing to find out.” I said. “Listen, Joseph, I don’t know if this will work or not, but is there any way you could do me a favor if and when you get out of here?”

“What do you need?” he asked skeptically.

“I need you to make an investment. In Montgomery Mining. They’re going to make a discovery in about twenty-seven years. When you make money off of that investment, which you almost certainly will, I need you to hide some money somewhere for my family after I’m gone.”

“I don’t really have much to my name, Mr. Li. I’m just a broke writer doing yard work for a stage magician.”

“I know it’s a tall order,” I said. “But I don’t know if I’m going to make it out of this and I doubt news of my death will be made public. If there’s anything you can do, anything at all, please make sure they’re taken care of. I…”

The words stung in my throat. My father was almost never a sentimental man and I tended to follow in his footsteps in many regards. It was difficult for me to express the overwhelming love I had for my wife and children, a love that grew in ways I never before imagined could change and grow in the ways it has. It was difficult to express to them, it was much more difficult to express to a man I didn’t know in front of a man with an octopus for a head.

“I understand, Mr. Li.” he said with an assuring smirk. “I’ll give it my best shot.”

One of the paintings on the wall twisted into a sphincter of purple worms. From it, emerged a pair of hairless, emaciated lions with huge grasping hands for heads. The hand-heads grabbed Joseph and pulled him through another painting. He gave me one final astonished glance before disappearing from view. I stood there bleeding, waiting for whatever fate The Operator had phoned in.

i'd see someone give a presentation without their voice shaking or start a conversation with a stranger like it was nothing, and i genuinely thought they were just... built different?

but then i realized something kinda wild: they weren't *feeling* confident. they were just *acting* confident. and their brain eventually caught up.

but here's the thing:: you can't just wing it. you gotta practice this stuff daily before you're actually in those situations. like literally rehearse it. i started using apps to help me build the habit (**i can drop some of them if anyone needs them**), and it made such a difference having that structure. tbh they do not help directly, but they help you build this as an habit..

so i started testing it. small stuff at first walking into coffee shops like i belonged there instead of apologizing for existing. saying my order clearly instead of mumbling. making myself speak up in meetings even when my heart was literally pounding.

it felt SO fake at first. like i was cosplaying as a secure person. i remember forcing myself to maintain eye contact during conversations and my brain was just screaming the entire time.

the more i did it, the less fake it felt. my body started believing the act. like i tricked my nervous system into thinking ""oh we do this now, this is normal""

1ogjgy9,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/1ogjgy9/my_letter_from_the_edge_of_goodbye/,My Letter from the Edge of Goodbye,"To the man who gave me his all,

Last week, someone asked me, “What’s your greatest fear?”

Seven months ago, I would’ve said it was losing you.

But time changes us in quiet, unpredictable ways. So I paused, letting the question linger between thought and truth. I almost said something simple, something safe — a lie would have been easier than the truth. But the truth sat heavy in my chest, whispering to be let out, to be finally told to the open.

In one breath, I let it out.

I fear being in a place again where my mind, body, and heart are all forced to survive — where calm turns into caution, and peace feels like a prize I have to fight for. I fear becoming that version of myself again who forgets how to rest, who confuses vigilance with strength, and survival with living.

Sometimes, guilt still finds me for choosing to walk away. But no matter how many times I replay it, no matter how many versions I imagine, it always ends the same: I still walk away.

Not because love disappeared, but because I needed to save what was left of me.

In the aftermath, I gathered my pieces — awkward, uneven, unsure where they fit. But that’s alright. I’ve learned that I’d rather be grounded than whole. I no longer walk carrying the shame of having given up. My steps are still unsure, but I’m walking forward, taking my time. And this time, I wear my surrender like a badge of courage I’m willing to show the world.

What I still carry deep in my heart is the memory of not looking back while you were holding your truth, crumbling under mine. It took all that I was to stop myself from holding you again — from being your calm one last time. I heard your voice crack beneath the tears you tried to hold back, and I couldn’t meet your eyes. For once, I didn’t promise that everything would be alright. Because I knew — this would break you more than it would break me. And I will forever be sorry for causing your heart to break, for denying you the gravity that would have kept you in orbit.

You lost me long before the day I walked out. I had already started to let go before I said goodbye. Every day for the past seven years, through the good and the bad, through every chaos and calm, I stood firm in choosing you. In every test and measure of my resolve, I always stood back up for you — because I chose you, even when holding on started to hurt me too.

The internal chaos you released burned me too fast and too bright until all I had left was a small flicker of light. It’s the one I carried as I took trembling steps away from the void you placed me in, without meaning to. I saw the light at the end of it all, but I stayed a little longer, hoping the delay might hurt you less.

If I could ask for one thing, it’s that you forgive me.

I hope you understand that I fought with all that I am and all that I have.

I hope you remember more of the good than the bad.

I hope our laughter lingers longer than the silence.

I hope you no longer need me to anchor your orbit.

I hope you find your calm without my gravity pulling you back.

I hope you find the strength to face your demons without waiting for me to quiet them.

Because you’ve always had that kindness in you — the same kindness that drew me in, and the same one that will help you move on without bitterness.

As for me, I’ll always wish you well — quietly, from afar.

In my still moments, I’ll send you hope: that you find peace, that you build your own gravity.

From the bottom of my heart, I can say this without regret:

I loved you with everything I had. I gave you my calm, my laughter, my light — all of me; heart, mind, body, and soul. And if I had the second chance to meet you again for the first time, I would still come to you, offer you coffee you wouldn’t drink, and say that same joke that made you smile at me for the first time.

Yes, I would go through all this again — over and over — until we find a universe where we succeeded against all odds.

But this time, I leave you with my memory, my quiet strength, and the still echo of what we shared — and what we could have been, if only I had more strength to carry your chaos, and you had more restraint to tame it before it defeated me.

Goodbye my Love. And please, live your life to the fullest.

Every day felt like I was walking through fog — heavy, aimless, and numb. I’d wake up with a pit in my stomach, scroll on my phone for hours, and pretend I was fine. But deep down, I was falling apart.

I had drifted far from Islam.  
I used to pray as a kid, but somewhere between exams, heartbreaks, and self-hate, I let it all go. I’d tell myself, “I’ll pray tomorrow,” but tomorrow never came. I thought I was too far gone for Allah to care.

Then one night, after a panic attack that left me shaking, I just couldn’t do it anymore. I remember whispering through tears,

>

That was the first dua I’d made in years.

The next morning, I forced myself to make **Fajr**.  
It was messy — I forgot parts of Surah Al-Fatiha halfway through and had to restart. My voice cracked during “Allahu Akbar.” But when I went into **sujood**, my forehead on the floor, I started sobbing uncontrollably. It was like every emotion I’d buried finally had somewhere to go.

That morning felt like oxygen after years of suffocating.

I made a deal with myself: no matter how bad I felt, I’d never miss **Fajr** again.  
At first, it was hard. My body resisted — I’d snooze my alarm and almost give up. But every time I managed to pray on time, the rest of my day just… flowed better. I started making **Dua Al-Masoor (the morning remembrance)** after Fajr:

>

I didn’t even know what I was asking for fully, but it started shaping my mindset — it reminded me that every new day was a second chance.

Then I added **Dhuhr**.  
By then, my anxiety was still there — but lighter. I’d take short breaks at work just to pray, and I noticed how even two minutes of **wudu** felt like washing away my thoughts. I’d sit after Dhuhr and whisper small duas like:

>

For someone who felt like their heart was all over the place, this one hit hard.

**Asr** became the hardest — the time of day when loneliness hit me. But I started using it as a reset point. Every time my mind spiraled, I’d say, “Just make it to Asr.”  
When I prayed, the world stopped spinning for a few minutes. My thoughts would slow, my breathing would steady. I’d make dua for peace — not success, not love, just peace.

>

And slowly, that peace started showing up outside the prayer mat too.

By the time I reached **Maghrib**, something had changed.  
I used to dread sunsets — they made me feel trapped between two days I couldn’t face. But now, I’d light a candle, do wudu, and pray. I started reading short Qur’an passages after — Surah Ash-Sharh became my favourite:

>

And **Isha**… that became my therapy.  
It was the prayer where I let everything out — all the guilt, fear, and exhaustion. I’d stay in sujood for minutes, just whispering,

>

Weeks turned into months.  
My life didn’t magically fix itself — but *I* did. I started smiling again. I reconnected with family. My mind quieted. I noticed the small joys again — the smell of rain, coffee after Fajr, walking to the mosque on Fridays.

Prayer didn’t erase my problems. It gave me the strength to handle them without breaking.  
Now, every time I pray, I remember that version of myself — broken, hopeless — and I whisper gratitude that Allah pulled me back before I slipped too far.

Food can be a part of a daily ritual or a special moment that resonates with people on a meaningful and emotional level. It can be a much-needed break in a long day, a taste that brings back memories, a creative experiment, a shared meal with loved ones, or even comfort during a hard time. Whether it’s a special occasion or an everyday occurrence, it should always be easy for people to get the ingredients they need.

You'll play a pivotal role in evolving retailer operations tools for catalog management, order management, and fulfillment, empowering retailers to succeed at scale.

**Asr** became the hardest — the time of day when loneliness hit me. But I started using it as a reset point. Every time my mind spiraled, I’d say, “Just make it to Asr.”  
When I prayed, the world stopped spinning for a few minutes. My thoughts would slow, my breathing would steady. I’d make dua for peace — not success, not love, just peace.

>

And slowly, that peace started showing up outside the prayer mat too.

By the time I reached **Maghrib**, something had changed.  
I used to dread sunsets — they made me feel trapped between two days I couldn’t face. But now, I’d light a candle, do wudu, and pray. I started reading short Qur’an passages after — Surah Ash-Sharh became my favourite:

>

And **Isha**… that became my therapy.  
It was the prayer where I let everything out — all the guilt, fear, and exhaustion. I’d stay in sujood for minutes, just whispering,

>

Weeks turned into months.  
My life didn’t magically fix itself — but *I* did. I started smiling again. I reconnected with family. My mind quieted. I noticed the small joys again — the smell of rain, coffee after Fajr, walking to the mosque on Fridays.

Prayer didn’t erase my problems. It gave me the strength to handle them without breaking.  
Now, every time I pray, I remember that version of myself — broken, hopeless — and I whisper gratitude that Allah pulled me back before I slipped too far.

Because truly…  
**Prayer saved me from myself.**",2,1761481566.0,islam,0,1.0,False

If you can name all the Hogwarts houses and pack a carry-on like a pro, we might just get along.

I live in Manila with six wildly charming dogs—yes, they’re all named after Harry Potter characters (points if you guess which ones). Life with them is never boring, and neither is my passport—travel is my passion, whether it’s a weekend discovering hidden corners of the Philippines or a long-haul flight to a far-off adventure.

I’m a bookworm at heart (fantasy and adventure especially), and I’ll always make time to re-read my favorite series. Movies are another love—anything from old-school classics to the newest releases. Bonus points if you’re into movie marathons and spontaneous cinema nights.

Music feeds my soul, especially live concerts. There's something magical about hearing your favorite song with a crowd that loves it just as much. I’m always on the lookout for new sounds, local gigs, or big shows worth flying to.

Throughout our friendship, he's had a few girlfriends, I've had a few boyfriends. We live in different countries, but occasionally see when one person is traveling. 

There has never been nothing romantic up to this point. I've never had feelings towards him, I've never indicated this. We have never acted like bf and gf, and I treat him the same I do other friends. 

In the nicest way possible, I'm like 99.99% certain he's on the spectrum. He is weird with food like he doesn't eat vegetables, he's socially kind of awkward, like he'll walk in front of me if I slow down to do something like tie my shoe, etc. So I may be in the wrong here by ""leading him on"".

Tim was recently visiting my country, and we had a dinner a few times. He full well also knew that I was seeing someone, although it's not serious yet. 

He made some comments about how he'd like to move to my country, because dating back home is hard, international matchmaking isn't working, etc. He then wanted to have coffee after dinner, which we usually do when I'm with him or our mutual friends. During the coffee, he made a comment that this trip made him realize he has developed feelings for me, touched my leg, then asked me to walk to his hotel. I felt uncomfortable, and was super worried about hurting his feelings because he can be very sensitive.

We walked to his hotel, and when we reached the lobby, I told him goodnight, and have a good ride home. Tim didn't accept this. He didn't insist me joining him in his room, but hugged me and went to kiss me on the lips without asking. I tried to sort of resist, but he went for it, and after the kiss had teary eyes and said that ""he's been waiting for this so long"".

So... yeah. I left, went home, and since then, he has been texting me about our ""marriage plan"". He wants to marry, and in his texts, it seems that he's convinced that I feel the same about him. I don't. 

So what do I do here? Did I lead him on? Did I do something wrong? What do I do going forward?

I’ve been building AI projects for a while now, and honestly - the hardest part was never the model itself.  
It was getting the *prompts* right.

Every time I launched something new, I’d end up spending hours (or days) trying to make the AI behave consistently. Then came the edge cases, weird responses, broken formats, and even some security issues. It got messy fast.

So I decided to stop doing it manually and built my own tool: **ArtisMind**.  
It helps you **engineer prompts** instead of just writing them.

Basically, it:

* Generates clear requirements for what your prompt should do
* Builds and tests it across multiple AI models
* Checks for clarity, accuracy, and security
* And gives you AI-powered suggestions to make it better

Now I use it daily for my own projects - and it’s saved me tons of frustration (and coffee...).  
It’s not some magic “AI prompt generator”; it’s more like a reliable workflow for prompts that actually *work*.

If you’ve ever found yourself debugging prompts at 2 a.m., you’ll get why I built this

So, the first time I thought I might was about a month ago. I was standing in my room which is on the second story in view of my window. I was distracted because I was playing a vidoe game, I glanced out my window and there was just a guy standing in the middle of the road staring directly into my window. And by the way, this was at around 11pm, so it's scared the hell out of me. As soon as I saw him I literally jumped out of view from my window, after I looked about a minute later he was completely gone and I didn't see any sign of him anywhere.

The second time was about a week ago. I was walking to school with one of my friends, and we were walking up this street. The opposite side of the street was mostly filled with parked cars, but there was this gap in the cars where there wasn't one, and in that gap there was a guy standing there. I don't know if this is necessary to include but where I live it's been super cold recently, and I didn't see him wearing a jacket, he also had a suitcase beside him. But about halfway up this street, I glanced at this guy and he was staring, like fully staring directly at us. I didn't say anything to my friend at first. We walked for a little more and he still was. We walked for a little more again and I looked again and he was still staring, he was watching us over a car, so I told my friend. She looked back and he was apparently standing in the middle of the road just staring at us, but I didn't see that. That freaked me out so bad, I was genuinely paranoid the entire day after that especially since I had to walk back home alone.

The third time was about 2 days ago, now this one might just be me overreacting but I don't know. I was sitting in my parents coffee shop at one of the windows on my phone, the way I was sitting was sort of sideways cause I had my feet on the stool opposite me (if you get what I mean), now my parents shop is in the middle of the city on one of the high streets, so it's busy and alot of people obviously walk past this window. But there was this one guy who walked past who was super weird. I was, as I said on my phone, but I glanced up and there was this guy walked past, just fully staring directly at me. Not into the store or at the menus on the window, directly at me. I was super freaked out, especially because he looked similar to the guy who was standing on the road from the 2nd time. After he had passed I sort of shrugged it off, and I had moved to the other side of the store. Then I saw him walk past AGAIN, super slowly and he was staring at me again. After that I never saw him again, and he wasn't a regular or anything, I know almost all of the regulars in our shop and I had never once seen this man before, so that only added to how much it freaked me out.

This might be irrelevant, but since this has started, specifically for the last few night I've had very vivid nightmares about people breaking into my house. This might not be related but I've never had dreams like this before and they're very scary.

Now I know that all of these could just absolutely be coincidences, and that honestly what I'm trying to say to myself to. I've always been a bit of a skeptic, and I keep trying to tell myself that I'm being crazy but I just don't think I am. I just want to say that I'm not a very socially anxious person, I'm never hyper aware of people or if they're looking at me, and I've never been a very paranoid person either. But lately I've been so paranoid that even going downstairs at night scares me.

I've told some of my friends, and they do believe me but I don't think they understand genuinely how afraid I am because of what's been happening.

Thank you so much in advance.

**Blurb**

Stephen Hadley's on a quest to recover a long-lost family treasure, but so far it's not been the adventure he'd hoped. After a near-miss with the law, he's forced to partner with an unflappable tour-guide who knows far more about his ancestor than should be possible. Ignoring a distracting and extremely inconvenient fondness for his charismatic companion, Stephen realizes they're not the only ones looking for the loot across London, Belfast, Amsterdam and beyond.

**Sample**

**Part I - London**

**Chapter One**

Stephen’s mother knew how to tell a story.

Typically, she chose the good living room as the venue for these tales, a room she called *the salon*, with the largest windows, a fireplace, and two couches facing each other. She'd light a stick of incense, mumbling something about cleansing, incomprehensible to the nine-year-old Stephen waiting impatiently for the story to begin. As always, it would revolve around his mother’s illustrious ancestry. Emphasis on the *ill.*

Fiona Hadley’s style drew you in without the need for surprises. In fact, she was so unconcerned with suspense, she often spoiled the conclusion to put her audience at ease.

“Now, my darling,” she’d say, in her languid west coast drawl, snakes of fragrant smoke spiralling around her head, “this story doesn’t start out very nicely. But it gets better, I promise. There’s a happy ending.”

Right now, handcuffed to a chair in a security guard’s office in piss-stinking London, Stephen wished she were here to skip ahead. To tell him how in hell he gets out of this.

He would hardly call his actions trespassing, a word the security guard repeated with galling frequency. He simply wandered in through an unlocked door and, facing no obstacles, made his way to a room labelled ‘Collections.’ At the time, he’d thought it was The Leadenhall Market Heritage Centre’s fault for failing to lock up properly. Granted, once he realized it was seven thirty in the morning and *not* the middle of the night, the unlocked door made a little more sense. And yes, he had been a little wasted.

Regardless of the details, his intention was to retrieve property belonging to *his* family, he had a right to see it. And he lived in the apartment above. That had to count for something.

The guard returned with a chipped mug of coffee and a newspaper under his arm. Now sobered up, Stephen stared at the steaming drink with unfiltered longing. His mouth was dry and foul-tasting, his brand new Huntsman three-piece suit was rumpled, and it was easy to imagine how god awful he looked from the shoulders up. 

Handcuffs seemed a little intense for a small, volunteer-run museum, forcing Stephen to assume they were the guard’s personal property. Oh God, this wasn’t some kind of kink, was it? He shook the cuffs against the armrest unsubtly under the guise of stretching, but his jailor didn’t look up, evidently engrossed in today’s crossword puzzle.

“Excuse me, sir, but how long exactly do you plan to keep me here?”

The guard took a long, loud slurp of coffee before turning his eyes up. “The manager’ll be in soon enough. We’ll deal with you together.”

“Listen, I told you, I was just trying to get upstairs. I lost my key to the door from the street, figured there might be a way through here.”

The two places did share a stairway, so the excuse wasn’t beyond the realms of possibility. 

“You can tell that to the manager when she gets here.”

Stephen had tried to get an appointment with this manager for the entire three weeks since moving into the apartment upstairs. It was she who’d taken most of the potentially significant items retrieved from said apartment, and locked them up in the very room he was caught trying to break into.

The bell above the front door to the Heritage Centre rang through the office. 

Clive kept his eyes on the crossword. “That’ll be herself, now.”

She slammed the door behind her, and loud footsteps moved towards them. “If that bloody new shop across the road asks me one more bloody time about getting a bloody blue plaque on their–”

*Herself* entered, startled, all of five foot and seventy pounds of her, wearing a pair of wing shaped eyeglasses that would definitely be hot to Stephen in different circumstances. 

She eyed the handcuffs. “What’s going on?”

The guard stood slowly to attention, a coffee stain on his light grey tie. *It’s not even nine am, man.* 

Myra Laithewaite’s gaze fixed on Stephen's left eye. In the strangeness of his morning, he’d totally forgotten he had a shiner. “That’s not your handwork, is it Clive?”

“He was in that state when I caught him rattling the collection room door ‘bout half seven this morning.”

She was unmoved by Clive's account of the event. “And what do you expect me to do with him?”

“Ms. Laithewaite, my name’s Stephen Hadley, I’ve been trying to contact you.”

“American?”

Can just *one* Brit begin a conversation with something other than clarifying the glaringly obvious. 

“That’s right. My ancestor, Molly Walsh, the diver, she lived in the apartment upstairs. The landlord found some documents after the most recent tenant left.”

“I am aware Mr Hadley, they’re in our possession now. Another of Molly Walsh’s relatives had said we could keep whatever we wanted.”

Stephen’s cousin, who they had unfortunately contacted first, had no interest in their family's history, nor believed in any possibility of finding the long-rumored treasure within it. If they had called Stephen instead, none of this would have had to happen. 

“Well my cousin spoke too soon, and I’d like to see them, I’m trying to dig up some information.”

“Family tree is it?”

That was most people’s assumption. And Stephen was happy for them to make it. “Something like that.”

Anything that saved him from having to say *I’m looking for a fortune of gold bullion hidden by my great-great-great-great-great-great aunt over a century ago.* 

According to one of this mother’s stories, this stolen bullion had cursed their entire family for generations. 

“Call the police, Clive.”

“Please, look, I was just a little drunk, I didn’t have my outside key, so I stumbled through the office looking for another way to get upstairs.” Stephen attempted to gesticulate, to enamor the pair of them to his case, but being handcuffed, he banged the bones of his wrist painfully. He felt his own desperation struggling to keep his tone even.

If the cops got involved, he’d be back to the US, and his search for the gold would be over before it’d even begun. 

And if the search was over, that meant an entire chapter of his life was also over. The beautiful, transient, nomadic existence of the last eight years would finally turn into the inevitable. 

Permanency. A roster of set-ups at the country club. Viewings of homes in rural Connecticut, commutable to his father’s office in the City. He knew he’d end up there eventually: a cushy job, domestic bliss, Sundays on the links. But he wasn’t ready. He hadn’t even managed to learn to like golf yet.

“Come on, don’t call the police. This was just a mistake, you’ve got to believe me.”

Myra leaned for the phone on Clive’s desk. “We have no idea you are who you say you are. What proof do you have of this ‘ancestry’ you speak of?”

Proof was always tricky where Mary Margaret “Molly” Walsh was concerned. Chasing back through seven generations was hard enough, the past receding like a spot in Stephen’s vision. The matter was not helped by the fact that Molly never wrote a damn thing down in her life.

Myra Laithewaite was a historian. She would understand that, right? The enormity of his task. 

“We don’t know you from Adam,” she went on, crossing her arms.

There was someone who could vouch for him. It wasn’t solid proof, but it was worth trying.

He reached his free hand into his back pocket, an action that caused both Myra and Clive to flinch backwards, screeching the desk an inch across the floor. Stephen wasn’t what anyone would consider classically threatening, neither tall nor broad, and while he was rather *menaçant* on the fencing strip, they couldn’t know that. The black eye clearly held a power of its own.

“Hey, hey, it’s just paper, Jesus,” he said, trying and failing to unfold the flyer with one hand. “Look, email this woman. She knows about my family.”

Myra cautiously came closer to take the flier from him, and narrowed her eyes, regarding it with familiarity. “Jade McGorry will vouch for you?”

Hearing Jade’s name spoken by someone else set Stephen’s pulse running. He hadn’t banked on having to see her again so soon. 

He can’t quite believe his fate somehow hangs on the word of a tour-guide he met days ago, who somehow knew more about Molly Walsh than should be possible. A tour guide he had pissed off royally and who probably hated his guts. 

They didn’t need to be burdened with that detail. “You know her?”

Clive relaxed a little after his near-death by paper-cut. He approached Stephen and unlocked the unnecessary cuffs.

“We know her,” adds Myra. “She occasionally frequents our collections for research.”

Her respect for Jade was easy to discern. Which was irritating but also useful for Stephen’s current predicament.

“She’ll vouch for me.” He held a minuscule hope that somewhere beneath Jade’s shiny veneer existed some mercy. She *had* seemed reasonable during their brief interactions. 

And, more crucially, he knew she was curious. 

People like Jade McGorry, who trace history, leaf through dusty old lists of names and obscured newspaper clippings, dig up pottery shards and unearth foundations, who pore over diaries and letters and UV-scorched photographs; they are powered by a need to know the unknowable. 

To find out how the story ends. 

Because history, like life, doesn’t have a narrator who knows all the answers. Who can ease your mind about where the tale is going. 

There's no one to tell you: *it gets better, I promise. There is a happy ending.*

You have to figure it out yourself. All the while aware there are no guarantees. Just a subjective interpretation of whatever scraps you’re lucky enough to find.

“Please, contact her. She’ll tell you who I am, and verify my connection to Molly Walsh. And would you look at that,” he said, making a show of digging around his pocket, “turns out I did have my key after all.”

Myra still looked skeptical, pushing those wing-shaped eyeglasses up her nose. It was a look that wondered, *do you get punched a lot?* But after a few drawn-out moments she nodded to Clive. He obediently picked up the phone while she retrieved a number from an address book. 

Stephen psyched himself up to say a phrase he’d spent most of his life avoiding. Perhaps the most detested combination of words in his repertoire.

“Could you also ask if Jade can come by the market today?”

He clenched his fists. *Come on, man. It’s just five little words.*

1ogj6if,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1ogj6if/i_wish_people_would_be_nicer_when_pointing_out_my/,I wish people would be nicer when pointing out my mistakes.,"Im not the smartest person and have difficulty navigating social settings, and will sometimes cause unintentional frusteration for those around me. 
An example would be i was standing a bit too far back in a coffee shop lineup, and one person got very frusteraed that I didn't go right up to the counter because my dumb brain thought I had to wait for the cashier to call up the next person. I wasn't trying to hold up the line, but this guy was very rude and aggressive when he could have been more polite.

Another instance was I didn't realize you were allowed to turn left at a red light onto a 1-way street. So a guy behind me got out of his vehicle and started yelling and banging on my windows because I thought  I was supposed to wait for a green light at left turns. He angrily reminded me otherwise 

I'm fine with being reminded what I'm doing is wrong, but there is no need to be so mean and aggressive while doing so. I'm not very smart, but still a human being and deserve to treated like one. Im really not trying to piss anyone off.",3,1761481079.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,1.0,False

But Witch mommy Mel is for sure ridin’ O-DILF-sseus every night. He’s getting his, and future you is getting the most tactical lover the underworld has ever known.

Personally, I wish there was a dialogue with Hecate where Mel just says “Seriously Hecate, is there not a single person you can trust to dig you out nightly?”

And Hecate just grins and goes “I give myself to Nobody” while Odysseus is just in the background undoing bonds from his wrists.

Realistically, future Mel knows the deal. She knows the young her was messing with three virgins and Eris. Hecate is a real boss, she doesn’t want some Asa Butterfield chump who can target ships but never the clitoris.

She wants a cut, smoking hot and well maintained middle aged man who spent 7 YEARS learning, out of desperate necessity, how to keep a goddess happy, not to mention his brief willing internship where he can guarantee how to keep a Witch happy, and who also has commitment issues so it never has to get real.

Anyone who doesn’t think our foster parents are boning is a fool. I want it to be true so it is. 

Anyone who wants us to be able to romance them is a weirdo. Not just because, like, what the fuck, but also because the Mel we play couldn’t handle either of those two hard bodied sex gods even IF they were down.

Stop being greedy, and let the adults do it right while we fumble in the bushes.

Fuck it, this needs to be expressed properly. I’ll chug a couple coffees and get started on a filthy Odysseus Hecate hot springs steam slam fic ASAP.",120,1761480803.0,HadesTheGame,23,0.88,False
