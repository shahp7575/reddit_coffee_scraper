For starters I used to drink a cup of coffee in the morning daily. I'd only put a single teaspoon of coffee grains, so already my intake is nothing compared to some people who are seriously addicted. Also, we see pro players with energy drinks on the side, same thing with people I play with on Discord seem to glorify the idea of chugging down a large can of Redbull.

In mid-December I stopped having coffee altogether. I'm not someone who takes well care of themselves so that's the thing I started with, cutting off caffeine.

 But then a week later I start playing like dog and it's only been getting worse since. My performance is inconsistent and I can't play like how I did back at my peak (gold 3) at all. I'm guessing it's a possible link to the caffeine but I'm not sure.

I don't feel a difference in my everyday life after quitting, and like I said before I am not good at taking care of myself which means I have a habit of forgetting to eat or I sleep short hours a night. Been working on fixing all of those this year and it's going fine except the sleep part. And I'm hitting the gym now but I am still not satisfied with how I play despite everything.

Maybe others experience this? Or is it just a very personal issue of mine? ",1,1738750113.0,VALORANT,0,0.99,False

I’m in a group chat with two other people (let’s call them A and X). We’re not super close, but not complete strangers either. We've hung out a few times for coffee and meals.

A and I work for the same newspaper, while X works for a rival publication, which coincidentally is a place both A and I used to work at. Despite this, we remain friends without any competitive vibes.

Our group chat is pretty quiet most of the time, but this morning, A and X had a brief exchange. I saw the messages but didn't respond. Around lunchtime, X sent a link to an article from my current newspaper — written by me. The comment they added was somewhat playful, maybe even a bit sarcastic.

I read the message but didn't reply because I wasn't in the mood to engage with the group at that moment. About an hour later, without any warning, X left the group chat.

**Now I’m stuck:**  
I feel a bit shocked by X's sudden exit and am unsure what to do next. Should I reach out to X privately? Ignore the situation entirely? I genuinely want to handle this thoughtfully but don't know the best approach.

I’d appreciate any advice or perspectives you can offer. Have you been in a situation like this before?

Just kidding!

Seriously, though, hear me out. I put 100% of my effort into dating for over a decade. I was on like 9 dating apps (Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, Coffee Meets Bagel, Badoo, Boo Dating, and Facebook Dating) for 12 years. I was going to Meetup ( https://www.meetup.com/ ) and Eventbrite ( https://www.eventbrite.com/ ) events every afternoon for like 6 years. I was in my city's co-gender running club and before that my university's running club. I majored in Computer Science and got a high paying coding job at Amazon because I thought a job would help me attract women.

After all that effort, the most I got was a 6 month (mostly platonic) dating relationship and a few one night stands. I was never married, engaged, or in an official boyfriend and girlfriend relationship despite being a straight man. Now I'm 31 and I've given up.

I'm just tired of trying. The juice is not worth the squeeze. The amount of effort put in is not worth what I get out of it. I have been single every Valentine's day for my entire post-pubescent life and I'm sick of trying. At this age I lack the necessary hormonal horniness to motivate me to want to try.

So here's my plan for Valentine's Day. I'm going to go to the massage parlor and get a full-body massage, and then I'm going to go to the strip club and get some lap dances from nude women who will let me feel them up. I have this one stripper's number (I'm just a client), but I'm going to call her after she gets off work and ask her if she would accept money from me to meet me outside the strip club. That's my plan for Valentine's Day.

Basically, I'm done seeking out free time and free sex from women. One year of swiping on dating apps is not worth the single one-on-one date with no compatibility that I get out of that effort. Three years of swiping on dating apps every day is not worth the single one-night-stand I get out of that effort.

So just after a bit of an advice.
I've been trying to lose weight since about August last year. I started very loosely - stopped eating breakfast (still had coffee with milk in the morning) increased protein, lowered the amount of sweet treats, occasional gym. No calorie counting, no goals, as it tends to demotivate me.
Anyway, the weight was going down, slowly but nicely. I lost about 15 lbs in a few months (initial weight was 229 lbs). Then I gained some back during the Christmas period as I let myself lose.
In January I thought I'll try a bit stricter approach, so just water/black coffee during fasting, I fast 21-23 hrs. I lost the weight I put on during Christmas, all good.
But in the last week or so I started gaining weight! I now gained 3lbs!!  And that's after I increased my time in the gym... my dinners remained the same as before. Mind you, I am a bit constipated.

I (17M) suggested I could have lunch with her and sacrifice almost all my afternoon studying time (I am having exams) in order for her not to be alone. To give some more context I only had buses to bring me home at 2pm or 5:30pm so I could either let her alone and go study home or be with her and then be to hours alone with nothing to do or study 

I decided I was going to be a good bf and said I would wait and have lunch with her sacrificing my time for her ( which I have no problem at all doing). On the way to Burger King we are talking about what she is going to do next, after the appointment, and she says she is going to the school library to study. This was an idea I was not against but I gave her other sugestions for her to do until her mother could pick her up like going to a coffee shop near or the park near by

I was saying this without thinking I was ofending or verbally attacking her in any way  but then she just turns to me full of rage and screams ""WHY CAN'T WE HAVE AN HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP"",  my heart shatered, I turned arround I started going towards the bus stops because I wasn't really trying to waste time I could be studying for my important exam with someone who just said this to me no remorse or anything. She tried to apologise before I left but it had already been said

On my way home she is spamming me with text messages  about how I am an asshole and that she would never do something like this ( she has done it several times) but the two messages that really mess with me were ""You are too childish to be in a relationship"" and ""You don't deserve half of what I do for you"". I tried ignoring this and studying but I was sobbing and couldnt focus and when she called She just kept going with it insult after insult (keep in mind I kept my composure at all times apart from when she called and I was already crying

Consequently, I turned off my phone so she wouldnt intertupt me and started studying. After a few hours when I turn it back on I have a trillion missed calls from 5 or 6 people she knows and she is spamming me texts saying that she loves me and asking for forgiveness for what she said. The problem is that I don't know if I believe that she is really sorry and if I should keep persuing this relationship, of course I still love her but this comments She made really hit me hard and idk if I can keep looking at her the same way as before AITA?",1,1738747393.0,AITA_Relationships,1,1.0,False

Coffee beans have a surprisingly long shelf life if stored correctly. Freshly roasted beans can stay fresh for up to two weeks. After this period, their flavor starts to degrade. Proper storage can extend this freshness. Air-tight containers and cool, dark places are ideal.

Factors like humidity and light exposure significantly impact the beans’ longevity. Understanding these factors helps maintain the best flavor. Discovering how long coffee beans last ensures every cup tastes delicious. In this post, we’ll explore the lifespan of coffee beans and ways to keep them fresh. Get ready to brew the perfect cup every time.

# Coffee Bean Lifespan

How long do coffee beans last? This is a common question for coffee lovers. The lifespan of coffee beans varies based on many factors. Freshness is key for a great cup of coffee. Understanding the lifespan of your beans helps you enjoy the best flavor possible. Let’s explore how long coffee beans last and what affects their longevity.

# Factors Affecting Longevity

Several factors affect the longevity of coffee beans. The main ones include:

* **Storage Conditions:** Coffee beans need a cool, dark, and dry place. Exposure to air, light, heat, and moisture reduces their lifespan.
* **Roast Date:** Freshly roasted beans are at their best within two to four weeks. After this period, they start losing their flavor.
* **Packaging:** Beans in vacuum-sealed bags last longer. Airtight containers also help preserve freshness.
* **Bean Type:** Different types of beans have different lifespans. Arabica beans might last longer than Robusta beans.

Here is a table summarizing the factors and their impact on coffee beans’ longevity:

|Factor|Impact on Longevity|
|:-|:-|
|Storage Conditions|High|
|Roast Date|Medium|
|Packaging|High|
|Bean Type|Low|

# Types Of Coffee Beans

Different types of coffee beans have different characteristics. This affects how long they last. The main types are:

* **Arabica:** These beans are known for their smooth and complex flavor. They are more delicate and can lose freshness faster.
* **Robusta:** Robusta beans have a stronger, more bitter taste. They have a longer shelf life due to their higher caffeine content.
* **Liberica:** These beans are less common. They have a unique flavor and can last longer due to their hardy nature.
* **Excelsa:** Often considered a variant of Liberica, these beans also have a long shelf life. They add depth to coffee blends.

Here is a quick comparison of these beans:

|Type|Flavor|Longevity|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Arabica|Smooth, complex|Medium|
|Robusta|Strong, bitter|High|
|Liberica|Unique|High|
|Excelsa|Deep, rich|High|

Understanding these types helps you choose the right beans for your taste. It also ensures you store them properly for maximum freshness.

1ii66z4,https://www.reddit.com/r/GastricBypass/comments/1ii66z4/baby_phase_of_the_gastric_bypass_process/,Baby Phase of the Gastric Bypass Process & Procedure. Halp?,"Hey there sweet peeps! My name is Bethany and I just got a referral from my doctor to see a bariatric doctor to discuss weight loss options. We agreed on the gastric bypass procedure. This is my first rodeo so I'm really new to the scene and I'm learning a lot. I was asked if I was a smoker bc the insurance won't cover it if I've smoked in the last 6 months and I said I was not smoking, but I am.

I just gave birth to my son January 6 and I had no problems quitting for my baby boy because a; I was pregnant and b: the smell disgusted me, but as soon as we were home, I stupidly picked up the habit again. I had bought both vapes and a carton of cigs a couple of days before he was born. Dumb decision. 

So please don't judge me. I need a little knowledge, guidance and education on this specific topic. What if I just switched to a nicotine free vape? Will that have an effect on being able to pursue my journey with the gastric bypass? 

I woukd ultimately like to quit, again, but I'm deeply back into smoking. I bought a carton a month ago and I still have 3 packs left which is crazy bc before, a carton lasted a week. So that tells me I can stop the cigarettes bc I am barely smoking them. 

But the vaping is non stop. From the moment I wake up to the moment I fall asleep. 

So is it safe to just go to nicotine free or do I really need to stop entirely? 

Also I want to add, i do not drink, do drugs or smoke Marijuana. Just smoking the cigarettes and vaping have me messed up. Lmao 

I was told they wouldn't test me until right before the surgery so I'm finishing the cigarettes and the nicotine vapes that I have for now, bit once they're gone, I fully intend to stick with nicotine free vapes unless that will still effect my surgery; if it does, I'll try to get Chantix ot find some support to help me kick this expensive, terrible habit. 

I hate myself for even going back to it. I was doing so well without it. 

Please don't judge me. I'm trying to figure this out.

Also, my surgery will be in 3 months as long as I am a good girl and stick with the dietician advice and pass the psychological testing. 

I was given a very strict diet plan and I am actually excited for it. Finally, some GUIDANCE on what to eat and not eat. I'm always on the road and I eat out too much. 

That's the other question though too... I don't have an eating disorder. I don't bingle, indulge, or even snack. But I also hate veggies lmao. I literally eat one meal a day, like two double cheeseburgers or a chicken sandwich. Don't usually order fries or sides. And i eat with a diet coke with no ice. I do drink water every day as well. Not a coffee or tea fan. I'm not even sure why I am as big as I am unless you consider the sodas and drive thru a huge problem; which it is but I do not indulge or binge. 

I live in a hotel with no kitchen and I work on the road.

So all the advice that I will be receiving next monday from the dietician will be great and taken seriously, but i will need help trying to find the diet that works in the living situation i am in. 

But what can I expect to be happening within these next 3 months at ths doctor's office? What usually takes place? 

Is the nutritionist or psychologist a reoccurring thing? Because they both don't take my insurance and they're both pricey as hell. Or is it a one time appointment just as a policy for the procedure? They both do not accept insurance and my bariactric surgeon referred me to them both because they're the ""best"" and I really trust my doctor, but if it's reoccurring, I'm not sure I'll be able to maintain additional appointments as I have to survive somehow too. 

I just feel like losing weight and being healthy would help me long term not only to be healthy and confident, but maybe actually stand a chance to better opportunities in life with a career and who knows what door it'll open? When you look good and take care of yourself, it makes you feel even better. I've just stopped caring about myself and it truly shows. I went to be healthy and happy like we all deserve to. That's why I want the surgery. I want my health and my life back. 

I'm basically in the baby phase.

I was just told that I'm a very low risk and I had these tasks to do with the dietician and psychologist for now.

So what do I need to expect once I go back in a month?

Or even a month after that? (Two months total.)

And what to expect in the final month before surgery??

All knowledge, advice, experiences and stories are so very much appreciated. 

I would love to know how your experience with gastric bypass. Success? Failures? 

But please do not judge me on the nicotine question. That's a genuine question so I know how to act accordingly. If nicotine from vaping will effect my healing or health (I know it's not good for you regardless) or could prevent the procedure, please inform me. I NEED this surgery.

4'11 
213 Pounds
I have managed to lose 22 pounds out of the 19 I gained during pregnancy. So there's some progress. I just want to continue to lose a little or a lot more before surgery; and I know that begins with diet and my mind.

And my end goal weight is 125-140. 

Thanks for reading my novel and thanks for any responses I get. I will be passing out shortly so if I don't reply right away, I am asleep but will get back to everyone tomorrow!!!

*On yellow sheet of faded whites and blacks,*

*With twenties' laughter peaking over hats,*

*A bride in white beside her groom in slacks,*

*Across the window, near the bedside sat.*

 

*The daises fresh were kept in vase at first,*

*But peaceful days were lost to tiny hands,*

*By second year, the days were spent in jest,*

*The tiny terror tracking trails of sand!*

 

*As days passed candles longer stayed at nights,*

*As lady kept her vigil over food,*

*So, she and he could catch the starry sights,*

*But not before the child was tucked in bed.*

 

*The lady bakes her man's beloved bread,*

*With sweetest, crunchy crust and spicy smell.*

*Just after kissing lady, out he fled,*

*With coffee aftertaste from morning bell.*

 

*The son is playing throw and catch with dad,*

*While heaving ball no farther than four rolls.*

*With strut triumphant, holding spam in hand,*

*Declares that she had saved five cents in sale.*

 

*The husband washing dishes after meal,*

*While heart of hearts with needle, mends the rips,*

*In summer rains, he repairs the roof-seal.*

*They both in winter enjoy skinny dips.*

 

*The child has fever burning one o' two,*

*The mother cried before the lord and kneeled,*

*The father threatened doctor that he'd sue,*

*To cure his son whatever bill it reeled.*

 

*The boy is charged and spanked for potty mouth,*

*The boy had grown three-fifths a quarterstaff!*

*The boy then moved away to room in south,*

*As bed no longer fits their two and half.*

 

*The family sets out for Sunday church,*

*In tight and formal dress with sulky teen.*

*And after sermon stop for early brunch,*

*Then homeward bound for chores yet unseen.*

 

*As dandelion the boy has flown afar!*

*The lady knits as Christmas drifts away.*

*The lord of house has lost the balding war!*

*She hides from mirrors showing white and gray.*

 

*Awaiting granddaughter’s letters every morn,*

*And taking longer walks along the lake.*

*While holding me to breast, they softly warn,*

*That only death together may them take.*

 

*Then moved away from lovely bedside stand,*

*And packed inside the cardboard box with rest,*

*In shadowed attic I was left to guard,*

*The tales of dad and mom were laid to rest.*

Tooth discoloration commonly results from coffee, smoking, and the natural aging process. Various whitening methods are available—such as in-clinic procedures, laser (light) whitening, and at-home whitening kits.

We’re happy to discuss all your teeth whitening options with you. During your initial call, we’ll address any concerns and answer all your questions.

# In-Clinic Teeth Whitening with Zoom LED Accelerator

The **Zoom** whitening system has been fine-tuned over many years, providing a safe, effective way to achieve a brighter smile. First, we protect your gums with a specialized barrier before applying a hydrogen peroxide–based gel. This gel breaks down the stains both on and inside your teeth. The **Philips Zoom LED light** is then used in three rounds of 15 minutes each (a total of 45 minutes), speeding up the whitening process by as much as 40%.

**Important:** A dental examination within the last three months by a dentist or dental hygienist is required to ensure safe and effective treatment.

# At-Home Whitening with Custom-Fit Trays

For home whitening, a specialized bleaching gel is placed into **custom-made trays** designed to fit your teeth. We use well-known brands like **Opalescence** and **Whiteness Perfect**. At your first appointment, we take impressions of your teeth. During the follow-up visit, you’ll receive your trays and detailed instructions on gel application and tray maintenance. Generally, the trays are worn for four to six hours over three to six days, depending on the degree of discoloration and the desired outcome.

--------------------------------------------------

When it comes to designing a kitchen that reflects a man's personality and style, creativity plays a key role. Men's home decor in the kitchen can be both functional and visually appealing, showcasing individual taste while enhancing the cooking experience. Here are some creative ideas to transform your kitchen into a space that resonates with masculinity, style, and practicality.

### Bold Color Schemes

Choosing the right colors for your kitchen can instantly change the atmosphere. Consider rich tones like navy blue, charcoal gray, or olive green for cabinets or walls. These colors evoke a modern and masculine vibe. You could also pair these with lighter tones for contrast:

- Use stainless steel appliances to enhance a modern look.
- Complement dark colors with white or cream accents.
- Incorporate wooden elements for warmth and earthiness.

### Functional Decor

Men often appreciate practicality in their home decor. Opt for items that are both decorative and functional. Here are some ideas:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/mens-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Magnetic Knife Strips:** These not only keep knives organized but also serve as a unique display.
- **Customized Cutting Boards:** Consider boards made from quality wood with engraved designs or initials.
- **Cookbook Stands:** A stylish stand can hold your favorite recipes and add a touch of sophistication to the kitchen.

### Artwork and Wall Decor

Adding artwork can personalize your space. Opt for pieces that reflect your interests and hobbies:

- **Framed Vintage Posters:** Consider frames featuring culinary themes or classic food and drink advertisements.
- **Black and White Photography:** Photos of your favorite chefs, foods, or landscapes can add an elegant touch.
- **Chalkboard Walls:** Dedicate a wall for your doodles or favorite recipes, combining functionality and creativity.

### Stylish Storage Solutions

Effective storage can enhance both the look and functionality of your kitchen:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/mens-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- Use industrial-style shelves to display dishes, glassware, or culinary tools.
- Jean or canvas bins can store lesser-used items but still match a cozier aesthetic.
- Utilize open shelving for a minimalist look while making items easily accessible.

### Statement Lighting

Good lighting can dramatically change the kitchen’s ambiance. Choose fixtures that are bold yet practical:

- **Pendant Lights:** Hang them over your island or dining area for direct lighting and style.
- **Industrial Lighting:** Metal fixtures add an edgy look and are ideal for a masculine kitchen.
- **Under-Cabinet Lighting:** This not only enhances visibility but also adds a layer of elegance.

### Thoughtful Details

Small details can showcase your personality without overwhelming the space. Consider:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/mens-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Unique Kitchen Gadgets:** Look for tools like artisanal bottle openers or handcrafted serving utensils.
- **Personalized Mugs or Glassware:** Items that reflect your hobbies can add a personal touch.
- **Aromatherapy:** Use scented candles or diffusers that promote relaxation and enhance the cooking experience.

A well-decorated kitchen can be an extension of who you are. By incorporating these creative ideas for men's home decor in the kitchen, you can create a stylish, functional space that reflects your personality and enhances your cooking adventures. Remember, the goal is to find a balance between aesthetics and practicality, making your kitchen not only a place for cooking but also a place to enjoy.

Essential Kitchen Accessories Every Man Should Have
---------------------------------------------------

When it comes to setting up a kitchen, certain accessories take center stage, especially for men who enjoy cooking and entertaining. A well-equipped kitchen reflects not just functionality but also style. Let's explore essential kitchen accessories that every man should consider incorporating into his home decor and culinary space.

### High-Quality Chef's Knife

Investing in a high-quality chef's knife is a game changer. It’s the most versatile tool in your kitchen. Whether you're slicing vegetables, chopping herbs, or carving meats, a good knife makes all the difference. Look for a knife that feels balanced in your hand and has a comfortable grip. Brands like Wüsthof and Shun are popular among cooking enthusiasts.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/mens-home-decor-kitchen  
  
### Cast Iron Skillet

A cast iron skillet is ideal for those who appreciate the art of cooking. It’s durable, retains heat well, and adds a unique flavor to your dishes. From frying to baking, the possibilities are endless. Over time, it develops a natural non-stick surface, making it worth the initial effort of maintaining it.

### Quality Cutting Board

A sturdy cutting board is not just practical but can also add visual interest to your kitchen decor. Opt for a wooden or bamboo cutting board as they are gentle on your knives and can withstand heavy use. A personalized board can also serve as an attractive centerpiece when not in use.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/mens-home-decor-kitchen  
  
### Elegant Dishware

Your choice of dishware says a lot about your style. Invest in a set that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. White or neutral-colored plates offer a classic look, while bold patterns can make a statement. Ensure your collection includes versatile pieces for everyday meals and special occasions.

### Stylish Kitchen Utensils

- **Cooking Utensils:** Stainless steel or wooden spoons and spatulas are essential. Choose a set that matches your kitchen's theme.
- **Measuring Cups and Spoons:** Accurate measurements lead to better cooking. Look for stainless steel options that won’t warp over time.
- **Whisk:** A sturdy whisk is essential for mixing and aerating ingredients. A stainless steel balloon whisk is perfect for many tasks.

### Modern Blender

Whether you enjoy smoothies, sauces, or soups, a reliable blender is crucial. Investing in a quality blender allows you to create a variety of dishes quickly. Choose one that is powerful, easy to clean, and has multiple speed settings. Brands like Vitamix or Breville provide excellent options.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/mens-home-decor-kitchen  
  
### Stylish Barware

If entertaining is your style, a chic barware collection is essential. Shakers, mixing glasses, and cocktail tools can enhance your pampering skills. Choose items that not only function well but also add character to your kitchen shelves. Copper and stainless steel finishes work well in most decor styles.

### Robust Coffee Maker

No kitchen is complete without a good coffee maker, especially for those who love their daily caffeine fix. Explore options that suit your brewing style, whether it’s a drip coffee maker, French press, or espresso machine. A quality coffee maker not only prepares your morning brew but can be a stylish addition to your countertop.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/mens-home-decor-kitchen  
  
### Compact Kitchen Gadgets

Modern kitchen gadgets can save time and space. Consider adding:

- **Electric Can Opener:** A smooth and effortless way to open cans safely.
- **Food Processor:** Great for chopping, slicing, and even kneading dough.
- **Digital Kitchen Scale:** Precision matters in cooking and baking.

### Attractive Kitchen Towels

Kitchen towels may seem simple, but they are essential for any cook. Choose designs that match your personal style while being functional and absorbent. Consider fabrics like cotton or linen for a combination of durability and elegance.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/mens-home-decor-kitchen  
  
Integrating these essential kitchen accessories into your culinary space not only enhances your cooking experience but also reflects your personal style. Remember, a well-decorated kitchen is not merely about looks; it’s about creating an environment that inspires great meals and memorable gatherings.

### Conclusion

Transforming your kitchen into a space that reflects your personality as a man is both enjoyable and rewarding. By incorporating creative ideas for men's home décor, like bold color choices, industrial elements, or unique wall art, you can make your kitchen feel more inviting and personal. Don't be afraid to express your style — whether that means selecting sleek, modern designs or embracing a rustic vibe, each choice can enhance the overall atmosphere.

Equipping your kitchen with essential accessories is equally vital. Items such as high-quality knives, stylish cookware, and functional gadgets not only improve your cooking experience but also contribute to the room's aesthetic. Invest in pieces that are both practical and visually appealing; for example, a striking cutlery set displayed on the counter can serve as both a tool and a decorative statement.

I was on Adderall for about a year and it worked OK. But ultimately it wasn’t the right med for me simply because it only gave me one to two hours of focus and a god complex mode. I also noticed I could take it and go to sleep like nothing. 

I was prescribed Strattera and reacted negatively with that. I tried combos of antidepressants but reacted negatively to all of them and eventually had a Genesight test done. My results showed I could only take one type of antidepressants and when it came to stimulants only 3 are tolerable for me; Ritalin, Focalin, and Concerta. Adderall and Vyvanse did not score meaning it could go either way. 

So, I was put on Ritalin 10 mg and I REALLY liked it. It was mellow and I was doing SO well. I was on month two going on three when I lost both a pet and family member. My psychiatrist was asking me routine depression evaluation questions (I am not on any antidepressants despite his recommendations because I am terrified of meds at this point) and asked if I was eating more than normal. I said yes, when I am stressed I overeat. But then I said I mean I tend to binge anyway. And he said “what do you mean you binge”. So after an assessment I was diagnosed with having binge eating disorder, which mind you I never thought I had and acclaimed it to be a stress eater. He immediately said he was putting me on Vyvanse. 

He put me on 30 mg. The effects were immediate and I hated it. Not only did I become an aggressive prick…I don’t sleep, I have weird cravings, adderall’s god complex mode is nothing compared to the raging lunatic I have become. The crashout is worse.

I have struggled with aggression due to PTSD. So being a 4’11 monster is not the best. I find myself not giving a shit about anyone and their feelings. I feel a compilation of feeling dead inside to I am Queen of my own delusional world to I can take on the military. Then that will violently shift to sadness and loneliness and need to crawl into bed and cry. Ive been on it for 10 days. My anxiety is off the chart. I messaged my psychiatrist (see him in 2 days) and he said this was normal and takes two weeks to adjust. I miss Ritalin, but Idk if he will consider putting me back  bc of the BED diagnosis.

Ritalin made me feel like me. Like I was getting better. I had less anxiety and panic attacks. I was sleeping and I was getting work done. I was really functioning and was nice and levelheaded. Now I just wanna riot in my underwear and drink lattes all day (i dont drink coffee and this is all i crave now) it is starting to affect my work. I took the day off yesterday bc on vyvanse IDGAFFFFF.

Finally, this feels druggy. I have only tried the devils lettuce and that only made me sleep. So I have no frame of reference for other drugs. But this feels like those videos I see people doped out. Not only are my eyes open so wide I feel like that gif with the little monkey thing and his eyes are ten times bigger than his face? But also I space out and just stare blankly. 

I see so many amazing posts about this so is this just me? I am a mutant when it comes to meds and react oddly if not violently and have the genesight to prove it. Im just curious if anyone else has this happen to them? I feel like he will say oh we will adjust higher and honestly I may spontaneously human combust if that happens.

I’m not sure why but over time he went from loving my dogs to snapping and yelling at them over dumb things and one day let my dog out of my yard while he was pet sitting (I was in the hospital having my appendix removed) and a neighbors dog attacked my service dog. She was rushed to the vet and they did all they could but within 4 days infection spread and got into her blood and brain and she had to be put down. During that time I put my old guy in a public access refresher and got him back to work while I mourned my girl and took time away from getting a new partner right off.. during this time me and my fiancé decided to move in together since we had been seeing each other for a couple of years and with him moving in so did his dog. Our dogs got along great but after he and his dog moved in I started realizing how his dog could do literally whatever he wanted and I couldn’t say a thing but my dogs did anything pretty much and it was an issue. He claimed my dogs got special treatment which aside from going with me to do their jobs they were treated equally to his as I don’t believe in playing favorites. He started being very cruel towards them verbally and then I got my new dog already trained she was a 3.5 year old yellow lab. And things seemed to worsen. He on a couple occasions put hands on her over stupid things like walking too close to him when he would go through the house and he’d get mad. She never got in his way or anything just walked beside him like she would for work. Then anytime she did anything it was an issue. I ended up returning her to the program and decided to take a break for a year in between dogs and honestly it was the worst mistake of my life I had multiple episodes that ended up with me in the hospital and with concussions one point they thought they were going to have to cut into my head to stop a brain bleed... I just didn’t want to argue over my dog and his anymore but I paid for it.. now this summer I ended up with a new SDIT and yes she is still not 100% because she is still working on it but tonight I felt like maybe he really just has an issue with service dogs.. I know that sound terrible to think as I plan on spending my life with this man but it’s really getting to that point.. tonight we had a snack instead of a full meal for dinner just chicken salad and crackers and my girl was laying in her chair half asleep and he randomly started screaming at her to go somewhere else and get out of his face while he was eating.. i took photos as proof as i was scrolling facebook when it happened.. she was just laying there resting.. at the same time though his dog was over by me literally in my face staring me down for my snack and I calmly pointed out my dog wasn’t doing anything and asked him to stop yelling at her over nothing. He then acted like I was the asshole so I decided to show him how it felt and yelled at his dog to go lay down and get out of my face. That started an entire argument over I’m mean to his dog and my dog is an angel and never does anything wrong and how I overlook everything my dog does (which is not true). I know my girl isn’t perfect she’s still a teenager and has her moments but she is massive already and can put her head on our counters and doesn’t touch a thing including food unless she is summoned or told to take it. She’s literally been standing by the coffee table in front of me just being with me and he yelled at her to get away from the coffee table but his dog can tear up the house and get into the trash and into the cat box and eat our sons toys and I can’t say a thing or get onto him. Is it wrong for me to feel like he just has an issue with my service dogs? Like is it that or is he just blind and doesn’t notice how he treats them versus his dog?",3,1738745406.0,service_dogs,17,0.8,False

Today though, I realized I have these small but noticeable yellowish white dots on the inside of my two front bottom teeth. I believe it's tartar but I'm not sure so what is it? And It's not EXACTLY on my teeth but sort of in between the gum and the tooth? (If that makes sense) I also noticed the gum surrounding one of the teeth is kind of loose? I wouldn't describe it as that but essentially It's like a little separated from my tooth (not so much that my tooth is wiggling/loose or causing me anything out of the ordinary) In the past I've neglected my teeth a little, only brushing once a day or not brushing at all for a day. But I've never had any problems other then plague. Last year (about August-October) I was concerned I had gum recession so my mum booked me a appointment but my dentist reassured me everything was perfect. I've practically been panicking for the last 2 hours about if I truly have gum disease, and what my future teeth would look like even though my bad dental hygiene has drastically improved. I'm planning on telling my mum to book me another checkup but I also want opinions. Do you think my teeth need to immediately be seen by a dentist? This is the first ever post I've ever made on Reddit but I'm desperate for some answers, please help!!!

(Also to note, I believe the dots have been there for a couple days and I haven't had a proper dental cleaning in a couple of years)

Little girls are being raped, their screams buried under the rubble that used to be their homes. Families are torn apart—mothers clutching the limp bodies of their babies, fathers digging through rubble with their bare hands, pulling out body parts instead of their sons. Their blood is on the ground, on the walls, in the air and YES, it’s on our hands too!

Meanwhile, I sit here in Europe, complaining that my room is too cold. I whine because my Wi-Fi lags for two seconds while across the world, a child’s last breath is slipping away under a collapsed ceiling. I’m disgusted with myself. I HATE MYSELF TO BE THIS TYPE OF MUSLIM. I look in the mirror and see a hypocrite staring back, someone too busy chasing comfort to even feel real pain.

I can’t take it anymore. My heart feels like it’s been ripped apart and thrown into the dirt. I read the Quran, and every verse feels like it’s shouting at me. The warnings of Allah aren’t distant echoes, they’re screams carved into my soul. 

Trump, —a pedophile’s bestfriend— pretends to be the king of the world, signing papers that decide who lives and who dies. A man drenched in filth and power, walking free, while innocent children’s bodies are trapped under rubble. Netanyahu a murderer with bloodstained hands, smiling for cameras, shaking hands, making deals—while the cries of Palestinian children echo into the sky, unheard, ignored. HOW CAN THEY BE ALLOWED TO BREATH?!

What do we do?!  
Nothing?!  
  
We post?!  
We cry a little?!  
We start the 12562th demonstration?!  
At the end of the day, we scroll again and see the same pictures. Nothing changed. NOTHING.

We’re sheep. No, we’re worse. Sheep don’t know any better. We do. We watch genocide live-streamed on our phones, sip our overpriced coffee, and talk about “self-care” while people are being executed for existing. We’re too scared to die, too scared to lose our comfort, too scared to speak the truth if it costs us anything.

Our Prophet ﷺ tied stones to his stomach out of hunger, while we can’t stand being slightly uncomfortable. He slept on the ground with marks on his skin, while we drown in luxury. Abu Hanifa gave away his wealth, living in simplicity, while we hoard money we’ll never need, stepping over the suffering to buy more things we don’t even care about.

Every meal I eat feels poisoned. Every building I pass looks like it’s built on graves. I can’t enjoy anything anymore. I see blood in everything. Blood in the clothes we wear, the phones we scroll, the food we waste.

I hate myself for caring about trivial things.  
I hate that I’m not doing enough.  
I hate that the world burns, and I’m still here.  
I hate that I wake up every day and go through the motions like nothing’s wrong.  
I hate that I’m afraid to die.  
I hate that I know all these things and still don't change anything.  
I am so disgusting and deserve the punishment.

I want to wake up. I want us to wake up.  
Because while we sleep, they die.  
While we post, they bleed.  
While we cry, they’re buried.

Maybe this pain isn’t here to break us. Maybe it’s the fire Allah lit inside us to wake us up. To burn away our cowardice, our hypocrisy, our comfort.

I think it is important in our current circumstances to see the emotional manipulation techniques Kylea uses with followers to boost engagement.

I have no background in law; however, I am semi-retired from the healthcare field with multiple college degrees.  These opinions are my own based on social media content.  I wish no harm to Kylea & Joseph ""Joe"" Gomez, their family, or Kylea's legal team.  

Quick Summary 08/09/24: There were zero posts about music, exercise, or personal growth.  3 posts mentioned prayer.  Birdie Mae (the dog) was 79% of the content.  At least 28% of the posts have been edited (wording of posts) and 14% was archived/hidden.  

1st Post- Birdie Part 1: Anyone who has utilized an emergency vet in the early AM hours knows they triage.  Either there was a payment issue, Birdie was not a priority (due to not being that ill) or the whole thing is bullsh!t.

2nd Post- Birdie Part 2: Birdie has been left at the regular vet's office.  Kylea had to have her coffee milkshake and will wait at home for an update around noon.  

3rd Post- Birdie Part 3: This 38 min video has been archived/hidden.  I lost track of the contradictions about the acute illness timeline and efforts Kylea has taken to protect Birdie for months.  Kylea is exhausted!  To protect her immune system, Birdie will continue to relieve herself on porous concrete.  Due to her proclivity to eat ""non-food items,"" Birdie will NOT be allowed to touch grass, go on walks, or to dog parks.  

Around the 30 min mark, Kylea announces Oliver has had a change in his eye color and will see the ""doctor.""  (Side note: this is a sign of feline optical melanoma).  Be prepared for a devious/lucrative cancer story arc.  You've been warned.  

Kylea talked about PTSD, the loss of her son, grandma, and 3 weeks ago, a father figure.  I am aware that Kylea did not visit this man, provide physical care or financial support and their relationship had soured.  To his immediate relatives, I am deeply sorry for your loss and any hurt my recaps have caused you.  I hope he rests in peace. ✝️ 

4th Post- Birdie Part 4: Kylea chose a giant cinnamon roll for breakfast (after 2 coffee milkshakes).  She is not addicted to sugar, is not an emotional eater, and has no cravings.  Ya'll, Jesus broke the chains!  Her journey has been perfect since July 2021 and she does not go off-track under any circumstances.  -210lbs forever!
  
5th Post- Birdie Part 5: She loves the baristas and tagged Crazy Llama in the comments.

6th Post- Birdie Part 6: If God wanted Kylea Gomez to be a mother, she would be.  She is a pet owner...and a bad one at that.  Kylea, call your therapist to discuss your many issues (possibly including malingering vs factitious disorder by proxy via animal...) 

7th Post- Birdie Part 7: Kylea made her followers wait an extra 4+ hours past when she said she would have an update to announce Birdie was home and it was an ""upset tummy.""  She drummed up worry and comments for 💰.  #greed

8th Post- Birdie Part 8: This post was quickly archived/hidden.  Ignore the luggage and look at the ceramic jar of Stevia & glass bottles of sugar-free syrup on the coffee bar...not on the highest shelf in her kitchen.  ⚠️ Birdie Mae's safety is in danger!  
  
9th Post- Birdie Part 9: 🤑 Kylea is thrilled with the payday today.  Her sheeple fell for the grift again. 💖 

10th Post- Birdie Part 10: Birdie looks great!  Oliver is on the back of the couch.  Still no sign of Alice. 🐈‍⬛️  They don't burn candles (there's one on the end table) due to Kylea's asthma.  Then why the duck does Joe vape around her?  Talk about that, Mrs. Gomez.  

11th Post- Sweet Mama: The woman who has not buried her mother (Grams) and enables her daughter (Kylea) saved the day with a hug?  Why the old picture?  Nope.  Not buying it.

12th Post- Dinner: Why so much soda & eggs these days?

13th Post- ""Joe's"" Got Jokes: 👋 Shopping addict!  

14th Post- Birdie Part 11: Someone is on a manic high from her increased engagement today.  It's like Birdie's illness never happened...🤔

✈️ Daily Recap Changes: After Birdie's 2nd alleged medical emergency, I made a promise to my family that if Kylea Gomez exploited her pet's real/fake illness again, I would stop writing these recaps.  I'm thankful to every person who gathered information to make these recaps possible, for their support, and to you for reading them.  To my family, thank you for going on this wild journey with me these 14+ weeks. ❤️

Hmmmmm.

That feeling, that itching in the back of my skull, I feel it. 

I only feel it when something is off, when something is out of order. It’s my sixth sense, trained and honed like any other, although it’s much more up to my interpretation than the others. What exactly is setting it off I have no idea, but I check the scopes again regardless, not that there’s much point. In-warp, a vessel is essentially blind, relying on her Navigator and her Computers’ calculations to see her through. I trust Gator to keep us safe from any natural threats, as is becoming of a competent Watchman, but it’s not natural threats I’m worried about.

Getting forced out of warp by the Federation’s disruptors causes many issues. For one, it tends to scatter the group quite fiercely, by sometimes thousands of kilometers, leading to long twenty to forty-minute sub-light burns to gather the group again for the escape jump. The ships could jump away individually of course, but that would leave them open to attack if they were to be disrupted again and increase the chance of a bad jump substantially. One bad jump is not a big issue for the experienced and battle-tested Navy Navigators, but for those more inexperienced on the civilian merchantmen it could be deadly, and with each ship carrying thousands that is too big of a risk to take. Another issue is the effects on a shielded vessel, and this is exactly why the corvettes in my force have none; being pulled out of warp in a shielded vessel causes the shield generators to overload with a tremendous electromagnetic pulse that scrambles electronics and shuts down drives, leaving said vessel dead in the water until it can cycle its reactor. If we are attacked, my destroyers will need several minutes before they are fully operational, while the corvettes can immediately move to put themselves between the Convoy and the threat with their Point Defence active, ready to intercept torpedoes and railgun rounds as they are fired. They will be on their own until the destroyers are cycled, but when the destroyers are ready they are free to push the offence and ward off the attackers as necessary.

As the Captain of both the Javelin and the Commander of the force as a whole, I am in charge of the destroyers while the second-most senior officer, Commander McKinley, is tasked with coordinating the corvettes, one of which he commands. Our plan has been drilled relentlessly and is as follows; Number one, reconstitute the Convoy by moving the Merchantmen together, then send them off away from the biggest threat, headed by Commander Buyskes in his  Flower-class corvette the HNLMV Friso for defence. Meanwhile, the rest of the corvettes place themselves between the Convoy and the threat, burning in the same direction as the Convoy as to not let the range between the two become too great, minus the Roselys and HV Sachtouris who will move to protect the destroyers. The destroyers, cycling their power as quickly as safely possible, then launch a counteroffensive as needed. Simple, clean, and effective it gives the greatest chance of preventing any losses to the merchantmen. 

It’s usually never that simple, however.

As distressing and unfortunate as it is to remember, I always need to keep the lessons from the first engagement of my career close to my heart, mind, and soul. The Cradle campaign was many disasters unfolding concurrently, but the one I personally saw with my own eyes was the ambush and slaughter of the UN warships, the UN oilers, and the UN troop transports that were leisurely waiting in orbit. Their troops and their tanks on the surface were guaranteed a quick victory after all, or so we thought. I still don’t blame anyone, save maybe for the Captain of the Halifax who got drunk at his post, but we were caught as flat-footed as can be all the same.

I think I did all I could, I hope I did all I could, but I had just been given command of my first vessel and even I had relieved the Javelin from General Quarters, although I certainly didn’t let the crew join the celebrations that had erupted on some of the other vessels in the Fifth Fleet. When Arxur arrived charging headlong into our formation with their guns firing and torpedoes letting slip from their tubes, even as their warp bubbles were still dissipating, the first emotion as always was confusion; Are we really under attack? Where have they come from? How many is their number? Can we raise UNFFCOM? Who were they, the attackers, even? It took a while before SIGINT identified that they were, in fact, not mystery Gojid vessels appearing from thin air bent on revenge, but Dominion forces. 

The next emotion that quickly took confusion’s place was fear, as our ships and people began to disappear into the void, torn asunder dazed, and unprepared for the Arxur’s sudden outpouring of fire. It was quite hard to communicate, with inexperienced captains realizing their crews and themselves were in deep peril. Screaming, I remember the screaming, vocal cords almost ripped as they begged for someone, anyone to come to their aid, their reactors beginning to bloom and their crews turning to mist from the shrapnel and torpedo detonations tearing their vessels apart, joining others in a cacophony of desperation. I was one of them, at the beginning, I was not special, but by the grace of God my XO Ford got himself together much quicker than I and took the Conn, guiding the Javelin to use the debris from our fallen comrades-in-arms as cover.

Five minutes to lose eighteen out of twenty-five vessels, most with all hands. The death of the Fifth Fleet.

That is what complacency, even momentarily, that is what it gets you. I cannot and I *will* not let that happen again, so help me God. Because of this, every time I feel my eyes wandering from the screens or my brain beginning to think of other topics unrelated to the mission I *force* myself to remember, to list the names in my head. A rolling ticker-tape of sons and daughters whose families now only have a photo and a sorrowful candle-lit vigil.

*The best lessons are learned through bloodshed, no matter how painful.*

I venture the stairs, going up halfway to the Crow’s nest. “Mister Summers, a report on the Warp Bubble and our wake please, if you would.” 

There’s a part of me that still misses the old days as a young ensign, back when the crew of a submarine felt larger than life and learning and using all of the nicknames you picked up was a rite of passage, the old days when I could joke and prank and bunk just like any of the others. But that time has long since passed, and I’m no longer a scraggly grease monkey nervous about playing his first prank on the head of engineering, hiding his tools under his bunk. 

The Captain can easily become a lonely, lonely person, even with his or her XO providing a link to below, even with the proximity to so many people. I can feel that pang on occasion.

The Gator muses in his den, “Clean, strong, slight lacerations on the western hemisphere but nothing substantial. More than enough to get us to our destination or even further, if necessary.”

“Splendid work Mister Summers. If you would, a report every quarter-hour would be much appreciated.”

“Reports every fifteen minutes, aye Sir.”

I step back down onto the main deck of the CIC, leaning over the railing to observe ‘the pit’, the recessed cubicles containing the men and stations. “Coms, ready tight-beam to the Flotilla and the Convoy Flagship.”

“Aye Sir, readying tight-beam. Five-minute estimate for acquisition.” 

“Thank you, Miss Lane.”

FTL communications are a godsend, but the sets on board most of the vessels of my fleet, with the exception of the Cambridge, are bordering on obsolete already in the face of technological developments given to us by the Venlil. It takes precious time to get the dishes oriented and transmitting correctly, and the messages that can be sent have to be quite short. Minor gripes in the face of being able to talk at all during warp, however.

I pace around the command deck, seemingly my favourite pastime when we’re in-warp. Back and forth and back and forth, between the railings. Swiping the cap off my head, I use the handkerchief from the breast pocket of my uniform to wipe away the beads of sweat forming on my forehead. The ship gets very hot and quite stuffy when the drives are active, I pity the ratings in the engine room.

""Pacing again, Sir?"" It's Ford. He has appeared on my left as usual, like a phantom. The first couple times he did it almost caused me to jump.

I nod, ""You know me, always.""

""I don't think I'll ever find myself enjoying this part of the voyage either, Sir. Here-"" He hands me a fresh mug of coffee. He seems to have been given an innate knack for knowing when I'd appreciate a new mug, as well as a great skill for tactical combat.

""Most appreciated Mister Ford, thank you.""

""Of course, Captain."" He retreats down the stairs to the Gunnery and LIDAR deck, his haunt.

Moment after moment, each second arrives and grins eerily at my mind with a Cheshire smile, tormenting me subtly. I place my cap firmly back on my head, securing it with a small wiggle. The void is as all-encompassing and vast as always, ready to swallow us whole.

Moment after moment after mom- 

""Captain, Distress Buoy spotted at the rear of the Convoy!"" 

Suddenly, Miss Lane calls out to me from her console and communications set.

I was recently strangled at work by a patient who was male. I have often had friction with men because I do not follow orders blindly. Especially not the orders of people I just met or who legitimately have no discernable power over me. 

When men I have dated or were married to have touched me in anger, I have left them immediately. I refuse to be treated with such disrespect. This very much angers a certain kind of man. 

I went on a trip with my husband to a car dealership in a remote republican area. I was directed to the coffee machine while my husband purchased a car for himself with his own money separate from me. I was happily making my coffee when a random strange man who seemed to just be hanging out in the car dealership commented that my shoes were untied. 

So I don't need to explain myself to anyone. But my shoes are too tight when they are tied and the laces are so short they don't touch the ground. I can't step on them. They don't get in my way. They don't bother me. The shoes are so crusted with brown paint I don't think re-lacing them would even be an option. They have been untied for a full year and I have never tripped while wearing them. Tying these shoes is literally not what I want. It is what I decided a year ago of my own volition. 

My husband comes out to try and convince me to participate in the sale of this car. I told the man I did not want to tie them and continued to make coffee. I asked my husband if he wanted a cup and he said no.

 Then the man asked my husband if he wanted me to tie my shoes. He said I don't tell her what to do and neither should you. This man literally said "" you defy your husband?"" And I said I defy whoever I want. (Very untrue at my job but true everywhere else) and I said i wasn't tying them. 

Ladies, this man at the great age of 60 gents his fat ass out of his chair and stands up, moving towards me extending his hands towards me. After I told him I did not want my shoes tied. This is a simple fucking thing. There are literally no laws about it. 

Friends when he came towards me I told this man that if he came any closer I would punch him in the face. And he stopped where he was. I walked away and went outside to calm down. 

He came out minutes later and heckled me from about 30 feet away like the fucking pussy he is. And I don't give a shit how uncomfortable I made him. 

He deserves to fear me. 


He deserves to fear us all.

I feel awful because I feel disappointed in myself that I couldn’t “mask” through the pain long enough until the show run ended. I did a pro/cons list and I even slept on it a bunch. I’m not sure if I made the right decision. And I feel myself slipping into a depression. I’d love some advice or support. 

——
LONG STORY:

I have been acting in plays/shows for years—paid and unpaid (like Community Theater). I landed a lead role in a play with a local community theater. This would have been my first lead role in a well-known play with a predominantly Black cast by a well-known Black playwright. (The role is unpaid. Volunteer.)

The director of this show was an older White woman in her 60s(?). The producer of this show was a Black woman. (This is important to the story.)

We started rehearsals back in December 2024. It was supposed to be to be in person but they ended up being over Zoom. We took a break for the holidays then came back for in-person rehearsals in January. The show was going to open in February. 

Here are the main situations that have happened throughout the process that affected me:

1️⃣ The play featured a LOT of physical touch and intimacy. This was a LOT for me and in December I asked if we could work with an intimacy coordinator who could walk us through scenes where a male cast mate would have to kiss and touch on me (female) sexually. I mentioned to the director during the audition for the role that I have Autism & ADHD and I’m touch sensitive. I reiterated this during our conversation about the coordinator and she responded with, “Why? Are you squeamish? You will be fine. We don’t really need one.” 

2️⃣ During the first Zoom rehearsal, we read the play straight through with no breaks. (The play’s runtime is about 2 hours) After this, I asked the director if for the next rehearsals she could incorporate a 5-10min break. The director said, “Why would you need a break?” And I said, “…to use the bathroom…get water…otherwise im reading for 2 hours straight and that’s a lot on my voice.” - the next day she gave us a break. When we all came back from the break she asked, “Did everyone have a good break? Did you get a chance to use the bathroom, MsRawrie? 😏” it was off putting to me that she directly called me out so I asked her, “Did you?” 

3️⃣ the director constantly didn’t give us breaks, even in in-person rehearsals. I had to keep asking for them. There was even a time when she gave us a 5 minute break but then after 2 minutes she walked over to me and the cast saying, “Hey y’all so—“ “Our 5 minute break isn’t over. We still have 3 minutes.” I just felt anxious whenever I was in rehearsals because I never knew if I was going to be allowed a break. And if she will actually leave us alone. 

4️⃣ whenever she tried to talk to us cast members who were Black, she kept bringing up topics about Blackness or how she “loves Dave Chappell”. It was super annoying. Like why can’t she talk to us normally? 

5️⃣ One of the biggest situations that I had with her was with staging. She wanted my role to be on stage THE WHOLE PLAY with NO exit/entrances from offstage. (This is normal yall. Most plays allow for entrances and exits and it was written in the script.) 

From Day 1 of rehearsals I mentioned to her that I need to be able to exit/enter from offstage because being perceived on stage for almost 1-2 hours straight at a time would cause me to have an autistic meltdown. I asked for her to map out these exits and entrances for me. 

When I first asked her she gave me a negative reaction and push-back saying that’s not what “she wants” and “this is what I signed up for”. I stood on business though and continued to ask for this “accommodation”. 

Then when we got together for in-person rehearsals, I asked about the accommodation again and she was defensive about it but ultimately told me she’d figure it out. 

Lastly, I asked her one final time last week (the week before opening night in the theater). Since I hadn’t heard any updates about it. She told me “she forgot” and proceeded to tell me that I’ll be fine. “Say it with me, ‘I’ll be fine’.” She instructed me. I did not respond. I became a broken record in the conversation asking again and again for her to map out my exits and entrances because I want to avoid a meltdown. The director proceeded to say, “if you need to have a meltdown you can do so in the parking lot.” And then asked me, “Weren’t you in [name of other play]? Did you have a meltdown then?” I said “no because I had time offstage and proper exits and entrances, which is what I’m asking for here.”

When I got home I went nonverbal—couldn’t speak for an hour and then I sobbed. I felt so infantilized and belittled. I also felt unsupported by her. 

6️⃣ I wrote an email to the director and producer detailing the conversation and how her comments made me feel. I threatened to leave the show if my “accommodation” wasn’t handled. The director never directly responded to me about it—not via email NOR in person. Only the producer who gave me a call and worked with me in person at the theater to map it out. 

7️⃣ 4 days before opening night (our first performance) we are in the middle of tech rehearsal incorporating costumes and lights and sound. The director still has not said anything to me regarding the email I sent 5 days ago. 

I overheard the director in the dressing rooms checking in on everyone. She didn’t check in on me. That triggered me. 

Before we were all suppose to go on stage, i started sobbing. I couldn’t stop. I couldn’t control it even though I had been able to all these weeks leading up to that day. My tears kept pouring out and my friends/cast mates were hugging and supporting me. 

The producer comes back backstage to ask what’s going on and I mention the trigger of the director checking on everyone else but me and how the director still has yet to respond to me about my email. The producer said, “it seems like a conversation needs to be had. Do you mind if I bring the director back here to talk with you?” And I said yes, as long as the producer and a couple of my cast mates stand by. 

I’m sitting down backstage and The director comes back there with the producer. The director immediately puts her hands on my shoulders and has her face so close to mine that I can feel her breath. It’s was unsettling and off putting. As I mentioned I’m touch sensitive. I confront the director tell her that I don’t feel supported by her and that he comments last week hurt me. The director became defensive and shrugged everything off as a joke. 

The director would then start talking about herself and started getting frustrated with me because I was “delaying the rehearsal”. I told her many times that her words hurt me and I’m upset that she never once approached me to talk. She then blamed me saying that I should have called her so we could “go out for coffee” to chat. Like ???? I sent an email. Then the director asks if I want I hug and I say, “no thank you” and the director says “well I need one!” And essentially assaulted me with a hug. My cast mates and producer had to pull her off of me. 

The producer then gave me 15 mins break. I called my support person and talked with cast mates who witnessed the conversation. They told me they wouldn’t be upset if I quit the show because they knew all the aforementioned situations I had been through. They saw it with their own eyes. I ended up doing the rehearsals that night and went home to think. 

I took the next day off work to rest and think. I did a pro/con list and talked to others in my life. Hours before the start of tech rehearsal I made the hard decision to leave my role.

I left because I lost the joy for the role. I left because instead of this show being a respite from all the hellscape we are in, it became an ADU hell, lol. A hell within a hell for me. 😩 my mental health has declined and I feel my depression creeping in. 

Do you think I made the right decision? If so, then why do I feel so awful? Any advice or support would be lovely.

So for context - I am the “host” friend. I love having everyone over, cooking for everyone, and throwing things for my friends. It’s a well known thing in my friend group. I went to my friends back in Jan with the idea of hosting a galentines. I did one last year and loved it and everybody had a great time. I was planning to move before then so I suggested we do it at my new place. Well long story short things didn’t go as planned so I won’t be moving til after the day we had it planned. But I’m currently in a 2 bdr  roughly 1k square foot apartment and there’s only 8 people and possible 3 children. So to accommodate space wise I packed up anything that wasn’t necessary for the party, got rid of my coffee table, rearranged the couch, and turned my sons room into a designated play room for the kids. I planned the menu, activities, and everything else to go all out for the party. I started purchasing food, a ton of decor (and not just party decor I’m talking throw pillows, champagne glasses, table runners, kitchen towels, rose petals, etc.), I got special serving dishes/trays, items for gift bags for everyone, even heart shaped straws to drink with. 

I spoke with a friend on the phone and let her know the party would just have to be at my apartment and she said it was fine. Then suddenly she texts in a group chat an Airbnb asking for everyone to pitch in. Obviously I’m confused so I ask why and she said the party will be there now. Keep in mind it’s a little over 20 minutes from where I live. She says it’s for space because my place is too small to host for everyone. Immediately I get annoyed because I worked hard to plan this event and it felt like they just decided to take over last minute. I told them I didn’t feel like transporting everything because it’s just me and my one year old and I live on the second floor with no elevator. I have a big car so that’s no issue but carrying a 1 yr old up and down 4 flights of stairs on top of everything else for the party is something no one would be willing to do. I also tell them I don’t want to cook in an airbnb (no telling what supplies are actually in the kitchen and who used them for what before we got there) They say okay we can just do a potluck, bring what you can and everyone else will bring stuff to fill in the blanks pretty much. Only one of them actually offered to even come help with the transporting. That annoyed me even more because it’s like okay so the last month of planning and shopping was for nothing? After some back and forth I angrily agree to the Airbnb, potluck, and just bringing some of my decorations. But everyone kept saying I was doing too much and I kept trying to explain why I was upset but they all just kept ganging up on me saying I’m dramatic. I mean I planned an event for over a month and they decide the week of to just switch it up without even considering me it felt like. And even after I was saying fine just get the Airbnb they kept going with the arguments saying I was ruining the vibes. Eventually I get over it I decide since they want to take over last minute they can figure everything out themselves. Now it’s a potluck? Fine everyone figure out the menu. Everyone is bringing decorations? Okay go shopping hopefully you can find some still. No activities planned? Welp start searching Pinterest or tiktok. I’ll admit it was partially me being petty but I was just so frustrated.

Then today it’s get brought up again and even with me saying I’ll bring some decorations (literally going along with exactly what they suggested) and they were still coming at me for ruining everything?!? I tried to explain myself again and kept getting shut down. So eventually I decided I’m just gonna remove myself completely and not go at all. This isn’t the first time something like this has happened and I’m just tired of being attacked and I already have enough going on in my personal life outside of this. 

But now that time of the month has started (sorry tmi) so it has me questioning if my feelings were valid or if I was just over emotional and overreacting.

I'm not sure why I'm sharing this but I just need someone to laugh with me. I'm 6w pp and my mom came to stay with my daughter so I could go for my check-up and run some errands.

I made a wrong turn (thanks, sleep deprivation) and wound up in a Chick-fil-A parking lot. It was noon and I realized all I'd had to eat for the day was a reheated cup of coffee so I thought ""Hey, why not?""

I've never tried Chick-fil-A before but I'd heard good things about the spicy chicken sandwich so I enjoyed a rare moment of post-partum peace and ate my meal in my car in the parking lot of the doctor's office.

Roughly 14 hours later I'm rocking my daughter to sleep and my stomach starts cramping. She's mostly asleep but I like to rock an extra 5 minutes to get her to stay down. This cramping caused me to all but toss her in the bassinet and run for the bathroom.

Long story short, I'm paying harshly for my moment of post-partum peace. Just my luck, my daughter is finally giving me a good stretch of sleep and I'm fighting for my damn life.

I was agitated this afternoon, perhaps the two coffees I had were the cause for that.

I had a slight craving this afternoon, the first I have had in a while. More so for chatsites than for alcohol, I wanted.. well, I’m not quite sure. I wanted something. Perhaps attention. Perhaps I just had a restless energy inside of me, and usually I would talk to let it out. I’m not entirely sure what I wanted to talk about either.

The weird and concerning thing was that I wanted to want what I wanted. I didn’t want to be pulled away or convinced otherwise. That was the weird thing.

I still don’t have Instagram or Facebook or Youtube on my phone. It’s.. boring. Going on social media on my laptop is also boring. Somehow it’s different from having it on my phone *Janky* as you said.

I love you so dearly. I’m very lucky you know, to have someone love me as much as you do.

Coffee can make you feel high if you drink enough. I wanted to smoke weed today. I wanted a substance of some sort. 

I’m eating icecream. I didn’t go on any chatsites. As innocent as any intention I had would be, being on a chatsite while in a relationship is a bad look. A dishonest move. An icky feeling. Like I need to hide it.

So, here I am. Eating my icecream.

I’ve been getting into calisthenics. I can do 3 poorly executed pushups. I want to be able to do 10 pushups, 1 pullup and a handstand.

My runs have felt especially slow lately and I’m unsure why. 

You know, one of my favourite things in sobriety is going to bed. Drunk, there comes a point in the night where sleep even overcomes the desire to drink more, and that anxious, gnawing feeling that the night is over and you have to face tomorrow. That *sucks*. Like mega.

Sober, it’s a calm affair. I feel good about myself, I know I’ll feel good tomorrow. 

I like that. It’s a content feeling.


In order to soothe my attention-seeking brain, I focused on the filming I have been doing. Documenting each exercise I do, the small progress. Maybe I’ll post it. Maybe I won’t. But I would rather people praise me for something I’m proud of, compared to moments that I am not proud of. Looking pretty on camera when I should be loyal is not something I would be proud of.

But being able to do a handstand press? Hell yeah.

I just love you. I hope you know that.

I feel without social media, my world has closed up a bit. I feel isolated. It’s not a good feeling.

All yours, forever.
