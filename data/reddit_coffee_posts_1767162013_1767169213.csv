1q07rh8,https://i.redd.it/vkv1tkdjvhag1.jpeg,Before You Apply for Lynnwood City Council - Part 1,"Hey all, this is Council President Nick Coelho. In case you hadn’t heard, we’re in the process of appointing yet another neighbor to a two-ish year term at City Hall as a City Councilmember.

Mayor-elect George Hurst has to vacate his seat to become the CEO of our city government, and so… we’re at it again. Doh!

Since the notice went out, a couple folks have asked what advice I’d give someone considering the position. Nothing nefarious—just how the process works and some food for thought. I figured it’s only fair to share with the whole class.

Take it with a grain of salt (*or a full helping of sides*). Doesn’t matter to me.  
  
My goal is just to help as many people as possible look their best.  
  
My advice?

1. **Attend Council Meetings** \- Council is on break until January, but we ordinarily meet the first four Mondays of the month at 6pm. Show up, sit down, observe. You’ll know within a couple meetings if you've been selected, and have an idea for the flow of the work.
2. **Catch Up on Context** \- I’ve sat through about 20 appointment interviews since 2021. You don't need to know everything on day 1 to qualify, but it *is* extremely obvious when someone hasn’t done even cursory homework on Lynnwood and our unique challenges. Do a google search with the city's name and something you care about, skim city and news material, and watch some recordings of meetings related to the topic on the city website (*Tip: Look on the City Council website for Meeting Agendas around the dates of those articles you read and skip the meetings up till those agenda items are discussed*). I’ve listed primers at the end worth devouring—or at least skimming.  
3. **Understand what City Councils do** \- Again, do a cursory amount of research. In general, we determine policy via resolutions and ordinances (*aka laws*), shape development and building code decisions, set tax levels (*usually a marginal slice of your overall tax bill*), and vote on budgets that fund Council priorities. It’s demoralizing to look at awesome resumes from passionate candidates who then describe goals that don’t match the job they are applying for. For extra credit, compare our scope to other entities (*Edmonds School District, Verdant Health Commission, Community Transit, etc.*). We are overlapping jurisdictions, but have wildly different responsibilities! Declaring you want to “*increase school funding*”, ""*fund more frequent busses*"" or “*promote an income tax*” may be heartfelt—but it’s mostly not the work of the Lynnwood City Council.  
4. **Scrub your Social Media** \- Checking privacy settings and old posts is standard for public office. It’s also annoying! But please do a quick sweep and make sure you’d be comfortable seeing your content in a newspaper with your name on it.  
5. **How to Apply** \- The broad questions on our application form exist so you can tell us who you are. A college essay isn't necessary, but one line answers really should be expanded on. Councilmembers only get the application + resume to rank candidates; the top 8 from a ranked choice vote advance to in-person interviews. Make the writing count. And *please* delete ChatGPT prompts before you hit submit. (*Yes. This happens.*)  
6. **How to Interview** \- If you move to the in-person interview, you’ll receive the interview questions in advance. At that point you can (a) read off prepared answers to us, (b) speak off the cuff, or (c) split the difference. Not everyone loves interviews, or is good at it. Totally fine! Reading can calm nerves, but it can also flatten your personality. My recommendation: lock in 2–3 core reasons you want to serve, build a few bullet talking points, and practice answering out loud. Aim to land your point in under 2 minutes per question to give yourself space to pause. Prep matters more than you might think.  
7. **Don’t Take it Personal** \- Many applicants pursue appointment because campaigning feels brutal. Fair! But being publicly rejected by recorded vote can sting more than a faceless election loss. Being on the dais also puts a target on your back. That doesn’t go away. I still get occasional hate mail from people as far away as Texas. During tense votes, people will say unflattering things about everyone involved—including the successful applicant. Appointments don’t shield you from the public side of public service.

Whatever your feelings about this year's election outcome, we’re entering the new year with the youngest and most working-class group of Councilmembers this city has seen in decades. It's an exciting time. Tell someone you know to consider joining us as we build toward becoming the best little big city in South Snohomish County!  
  
Applications are due by 4pm this Friday, January 2nd. You can find the application on the City Council portion of the City website. Listed below is some light reading material and a few core topics relevant to Quarter 1. *Note: I'll have more in Part 2 which will function as a Year in Review.*

Oh, one last thing! Soliciting feedback or engaging in back-and-forths on social media as a public official is heavily discouraged due to weird State laws. If you want to contact me, please do so at my official channels at [NCoelho@LynnwoodWA.Gov](mailto:NCoelho@LynnwoodWA.Gov) or via text/call at 425-725-0335.

At least read the 24-page introduction to get grounded. *Please note that retail in Lynnwood is not dying or on a serious decline.* I've heard this trope for years, from both candidates and applicants, and all it reveals is a misunderstanding of our city's economy in the region. Read a little bit!

See Chapter 8 (“Budgets”) and the chart on page 36 showing separation of powers between Mayor and Council. Hint: Council is much more hands-off and high-level.

This will be front-and-center in early 2026, so be prepared to talk about it!

With this year’s budget emergency, our Council priority to review poverty and housing insecurity in Lynnwood slipped through the proverbial cracks. This will likely be one of three themes we tackle in the first quarter of 2026. The timing’s good, too: the Hygiene Center just became a permanent fixture, the Lynnwood Neighborhood Center is due to open next month, and we are still discussing how to best administer our protected [**Affordable Housing**](https://wacities.org/data-resources/implementing-hb-1406) and [**Opioid Settlement Funds**](https://citizenportal.ai/articles/5965676/Lynnwood/Snohomish-County/Washington/Lynnwood-staff-propose-525000-initial-opioid-abatement-spending-round-solicit-community-proposals).

Human being has a meaning. We are souls that see the world through our eyes (not gonna discuss third eye theories). So are people from other countries. There have been great books on pretty much every topic from all around the world.

Lesson 2

Enlightenment is a deeply disputed topic
From the idea that nothing exists (at which point I don't exist so why even talk about it if everyone else is fake), to the idea were in a computer on some teachers desk (at which point all questions are just asked again like, where did that world come from or how did coffee appear for them), to the idea that this life is only so long and it's debated what happens after (agnostic thinking), to claim one knows all the universe everywhere is plain wrong and disprovably so I guess....

Humility
We all have more to learn, and the more you learn the more 'power' you gain, better that skills, understanding, access to conversations or relevant context. Like options that require skills in games",1,1767168579.0,enlightenment,0,1.0,False
1q07pgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/roleplaying/comments/1q07pgu/f4a_professor_slow_burn/,F4A professor slow burn,"The breakup had felt final the moment she walked away from it.

Three years condensed into one humid summer night, ending not with screaming or tears, but with exhaustion. She’d told herself she needed space—needed to remember who she was without someone else’s expectations clinging to her ribs. That was how she’d ended up at the bar. Dim lights. Sticky floors. Music loud enough to drown out her thoughts.

She hadn’t gone there looking for anything permanent.

He’d been easy to talk to. Older, but not intimidating. Confident in a way that didn’t demand attention, just earned it. They’d shared drinks, sarcasm, half-truths. No last names. No futures. Just the quiet agreement that this was a single night suspended outside real life.

And then summer ended.

Now, the campus buzzed with fresh beginnings—flyers plastered to brick walls, laughter echoing across the quad, the smell of coffee and new notebooks in the air. She adjusted the strap of her bag and told herself she was fine. That whatever she’d done over the summer stayed there. That college was a reset button.

The lecture hall was nearly full when she stepped inside. She slipped into a seat near the aisle, heart thudding but steady enough, flipping open her notebook as the low hum of conversation settled around her.

Then the room shifted.

The door at the front opened, and instinctively, everyone went quiet.

He walked in with a stack of papers under his arm, posture straight, presence commanding without trying. Clean-cut. Composed. Nothing like the man she remembered leaning close to hear her over the music, smiling like the world was a private joke.

Except it was him. Undeniably.

Her breath caught. Heat rushed to her face as recognition slammed into place, sharper than panic. The way he paused—just a fraction of a second—when his gaze swept the room told her she hadn’t imagined it. His eyes found hers, and something flickered there. Surprise. Tension. Control snapping firmly back into place.

“Welcome to the semester,” he said, voice smooth, professional, as if it had never whispered her name in the dark.

He turned to write his name on the board.

She stared at it, pulse roaring in her ears.

This wasn’t just awkward. This wasn’t just bad luck. This was going to be weeks of lectures, office hours, careful distance—and the shared secret of a night that had been meant to disappear.

She lowered her eyes to her notebook, hand tightening around her pen, and wondered which of them was more afraid of what came next.

⸻

I’m a 27-year-old woman living in Tennessee, USA, and I’m at a stage in my life where I’m no longer looking for excitement that fades or connections that go nowhere. I’m looking for something real, intentional, and rooted in faith. I’m here because I want my future husband — not a situationship, not entertainment, not temporary attention.

My faith matters to me. I’m not perfect, but I believe in God, prayer, growth, and accountability. I want a relationship that puts God first not just on Sundays, but in everyday life — in how we communicate, how we forgive, and how we choose each other. I’m looking for a good Christian man who values honesty, loyalty, respect, and commitment, and who understands that love is a daily choice, not just a feeling.

A little about me: I love iced coffee (especially the kind you sip slowly while talking about everything and nothing). I enjoy gaming — it’s something I genuinely have fun with and would love to share with the right person, whether that’s playing together or just enjoying each other’s company while doing our own thing. I love long conversations, deep talks late at night, and meaningful texts that show effort and intention. I value communication and emotional presence more than grand gestures.

When I love, I love deeply. I’m loyal, affectionate, and I care with my whole heart. I believe in building each other up, not tearing each other down. I want a partner who listens to understand, not to accuse, and who believes in working through problems instead of walking away when things get uncomfortable.

I’m not looking for perfection — I’m looking for sincerity. A man who is emotionally mature, kind, steady, and willing to grow. Someone who wants peace, stability, faith, and a real partnership. I believe in traditional values, but I also believe in teamwork — praying together, supporting each other, laughing together, and choosing love even on hard days.

I want marriage someday. I want a life that feels safe, loving, and grounded. I want my partner to be my best friend — someone I can talk to for hours, laugh with, pray with, and build a future with.

If you’re a Christian man who knows what he wants, values faith and commitment, enjoys real conversations, and is genuinely looking for a wife — not a distraction — then maybe this resonates with you for a reason. I believe God brings people together when the intentions are pure and the timing is right.

If this speaks to you, I’m open to a respectful conversation. And if not, I still wish you well on your journey. I know what I’m looking for, and I’m trusting God with the rest.",2,1767168105.0,ChristianDating,1,1.0,False
1q07lkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1q07lkr/my_boyfriend_has_feelings_for_his_ex_situationship/,My boyfriend has feelings for his ex situation-ship,"I 19 F recently started dating my boyfriend 20M. I had known him prior through brief interactions as we both study the same degree together at university. This last month we began spending more time together then just a once off gym sesh or conversation between classes. We went on a hike, painted together, went snorkelling, he took me out to dinner ect. After going to the gym one day he kissed me and and we started dating officially. Everything did move pretty fast but it all felt so normal, easy and casual. We even spent Christmas together, I met his family and he met mine. 

Now on Boxing Day he told me that his ex situation-ship called him and he wasn’t sure why, she is currently in another country and they haven’t spoke in a month or so. I told him he should call her back because I too was curious as to why she was calling. He called her on speaker phone when we were in the car and she was just calling to catch up and wish him merry Christmas. After the call I told him that I thought it was a little odd and that it appeared as though she may still have some lingering feelings. 

For context they had been close friends for a couple years and a little while before me and him started dating they had a bit of a friends with benefits type deal, he wanted a relationship and she didn’t and then they sort of left it unresolved before she went overseas. (I wasn’t aware of the unresolved part) he had told me before we started dating that this situation-ship was a really dark time in his life and that he regretted ever having that kind of relationship with her, he felt taken advantaged of and that his feelings were played with. 

We talked and he said things that conveyed to me that he still cared for her. He was talking about how if he was to cut her off (not that I asked him to do so or anything) that it would eat him up inside and that he still wanted to meet her for coffees and talk occasionally. I pointed out that it seemed like he may also have some unresolved feelings for her too. 

At the time he denied it at first before admitting that it might be true and that he hadn’t really considered it, that he hadn’t thought of her in a while and he was only thinking of me. He said that I was his priority and that things would just have to change between him and her. I reassured him that having unresolved feelings for something so recent was normal and that what matters more is how he chooses to act on it but that’s a decision he needs to make on his own. 

That night and the following morning things were largely normal, then I dropped him off at his house  and didn’t hear from him in a while. I asked him if everything was alright and he confessed he was really grappling with the unresolved feelings for this girl that he was now aware of. We talked on the phone and he confessed that if she ever wanted to be with him he couldn’t turn her down. He essentially confessed that she was more important to him then I was. Of course this upset me and in the heat of the moment we somewhat mutually broke up and I returned his things to his house. 

The following day I was really upset and ended up having a long talk with my father. Through this talk I came to the perspective that I can understand what he’s going through. I don’t think it makes him a bad person, I don’t believe he intentionally used me as a rebound. I believe he was unaware of these feelings but that doesn’t make what he had/has with me any less real or less genuine. His relationship with her was very recent so it was more of a case of right people wrong time. We were great together and it’s understandable that he would care for her more since he’s known her for years and I’m fairly new. Essentially I decided to sit down and have a talk with him. I told him my perspective and said that I would like to move forward with our relationship if he was willing to. After all she has no interest in a relationship with him with time, if our relationship was to mature it’s reasonable to consider his feelings for her diminishing and those for me growing stronger. Now many people might say that this is wrong, that I shouldn’t have offered this option but I don’t believe he’s a bad person, he’s been very honest with me and I don’t think anyone’s without their emotional baggage and relationships are never black and white. 

Anyways he supported the idea, we hugged and I layed out some boundaries regarding the ex. That I wanted sexual exclusivity, to be his first emotional support, to be told about any developments and for him not to confide in her about our relationship but I did want him to tell her that we were together next he spoke with her. I think this is all pretty reasonable, I also didn’t tell him they couldn’t be friends, again I know she means a lot to him. He agreed to all my boundaries and thought they were fair. 

Later he called me and told me that he had phoned her, that they agreed to be friends and that he told her about me and how much I meant to him. 

Now this is probably where I messed up in my attempts to fix things with him. It was late when he called me and although I understand him being someone’s second choice still hurts, a lot, I was kind of in my feels at the time so I was a bit dry on the phone. He told me to open up to me, to call him back or message him if I wanted to get anything off my chest. With that invitation I later sent him a message telling him that although I wanted to persue the relationship I’m just a little down at the moment as I’m grappling with my own feelings surrounding being a second choice ect. This message only made him feel worse about the whole thing and he went cold for a while. The next day he called me and attempted to end things again stemming from a place of his own guilt, feeling as though he had done wrong by me and that his actions weren’t morally justifiable. I tried to convince him otherwise and now we are in a stage of limbo where he’s asked for some time and space to think things over with himself, his own personal conflicts and to decide if he wants to continue our relationship. We haven’t talked in 24 hours or so. I’m a pretty anxious person so naturally I’m not sitting well with the no communication but I’m trying to stay level headed here. I only want to persue this if he also wants me. I can support him through his turmoils but not if he doesn’t also want me, even if at the moment it’s less then this other girl, that’s easily subject to change. 

Essentially my point of writing this post is I’d really like some advice on how to make him understand my perspective more and to give our relationship a try and to leave this issue in the past. I don’t care if it doesn’t work after we’ve tried, at least then we tried and there isn’t that what if surrounding something that could have been great.

# **COMMENTS DISABLED – EPISODE 3 NOVELIZATION**

### **“Kara, Explained”**

Kara learned early that silence could be productive.

Not the uncomfortable kind—the kind people rush to fill with jokes or apologies—but the clean silence of a room where everyone knows what they’re doing. She liked that silence. It meant the work would speak first.

The PBS studio smelled faintly of coffee and ozone. A technician adjusted a light. Someone checked levels without saying her name aloud, because they didn’t need to. Kara sat at the table, hands folded, posture relaxed in a way that came only from repetition. No ring light. No countdown. No adrenaline.

“When you’re ready,” the producer said.

Kara nodded.

“Today,” she began, “we’re talking about memory. Specifically, why the brain prefers stories to facts—and how that preference can mislead us.”

The red light blinked on.

Across the country, Chaz Wylde watched this footage weeks later from his couch, his laptop balanced precariously on a pizza box. He noticed immediately what wasn’t there: no jump cuts, no reaction cam, no music begging him to feel something. Just Kara. Explaining. Calm.

The documentary crew let the shot breathe.

---

## **The Interview**

Kara sat for the documentary in a smaller room, neutral backdrop, no props. She wore the same blazer she wore on television—not out of vanity, but habit. She had learned long ago that presentation saved time.

“When people talk about Wylde Stuff,” the interviewer asked gently, “they often frame you as the brains behind the operation.”

Kara considered this.

“We weren’t a brain-and-body situation,” she said finally. “We were… two different instincts responding to the same reward system.”

She didn’t smile. She wasn’t defensive. She sounded like a scientist describing weather.

“I liked explaining things. Chaz liked being watched. Neither of those is wrong. But only one of them ages well.”

The camera stayed on her face. No cutaways. No commentary.

---

## **Footage, Recontextualized**

Old clips surfaced—not with the frenetic nostalgia Chaz usually applied, but slowed, stripped of music. Kara in goggles, explaining surface tension. Kara counting down safety steps while Chaz shouted over her. Kara laughing, then stopping when the camera stayed on too long.

Watching herself, Kara felt the familiar ache of recognition—not regret, exactly. More like proof.

“I didn’t leave because of one fight,” she said in voiceover. “I left because the camera started to feel like a third person in the relationship. And it never slept.”

She described a hospital visit they filmed once—supposedly a kindness stunt. Chaz had set up a prank involving balloons and a speaker. Kara noticed the nurse’s expression. She reached down and unplugged the mic.

Chaz didn’t notice.

That was the moment.

Not dramatic. Not viral. Just decisive.

---

## **The Exit**

Kara’s apartment now was small and warm. Bookshelves bent under the weight of cognitive science texts and old notebooks. No merch. No trophies. A plant by the window leaned toward the light.

She cooked dinner while the documentary camera sat quietly in the corner. She didn’t acknowledge it.

“I didn’t announce my departure,” she said. “I just stopped showing up.”

She paused, stirring.

“The internet treats that as betrayal.”

On-screen, her PBS segment played in the background—her explaining how repetition rewires belief. The irony went unacknowledged.

---

## **The Myth of the Muse**

“Do you feel responsible for Chaz’s success?” the interviewer asked.

Kara’s jaw tightened—not in anger, but in correction.

“No,” she said. “I feel… credited late.”

She spoke about the exhaustion of being “the smart one” in a duo built on spectacle. About how people mistook her calm for support, her presence for consent.

“People think I left because I wanted recognition,” she said. “I left because I wanted sleep.”

The documentary cut to Chaz watching this line. He didn’t react outwardly. His face did something subtler—like a house settling after years of noise.

He had never considered that her leaving wasn’t about him at all.

---

## **Public Narrative**

Kara scrolled her phone that night. Comments under her PBS clip bloomed like algae:

*She carried him.*
*Why didn’t she stop him sooner?*
*She knew what she was doing.*

Kara exhaled.

“Women don’t leave chaos,” she said in voiceover. “We outgrow it—and get blamed for not fixing it first.”

She set the phone down.

---

## **Parallel Silence**

The final act unfolded without dialogue.

Chaz, alone, laptop glow reflecting in his eyes as Kara spoke onscreen—measured, unhurried, unbothered by his absence.

Kara, in her kitchen, eating dinner, reading a book. No camera now. No need.

For the first time, Chaz understood the difference between being abandoned and being surpassed.

The documentary did not underline this. It trusted the audience.

---

## **Final Word**

Kara’s voice returned, steady and unperformative.

“I didn’t escape Chaz,” she said.  
“I just stopped performing for people who confused attention with love.”

The screen faded to black.

Almost  2 weeks after taking my mom with me .she died from a heart attack last night. 

It still doesn’t feel real when I type it out. I keep thinking there’s been some mistake. tthe airbnb owner was visibly upset bec someone died on her property and the authorities needs to temporarily close it and airbnb needs to be notifed and cancel upcoming reservations. i just apologized and left with the ambulance last night and asked them to contact me if they need anything

yesterday was ordinary. She was telling me about an old friend she reconnected with in facebook. She asked me if I wanted eggs. She complained that the coffee was too strong, then drank it anyway. She laughed at something on TV. She looked okay. Tired, but okay. I left my room to get something from the supermarket, and when I came back out, she was sitting on the couch holding her chest.


At first she said it was just heartburn. She didn’t want to make a fuss. She kept apologizing, even then, saying she was probably just anxious again. I called for an ambulance anyway. I remember kneeling in front of her, telling her to look at me, telling her to breathe with me. She squeezed my hand so hard. That pressure is still in my bones. I tried doing cpr but it didnt worked and she didn’t make it.

The doctor said stress could have been a factor or she's been having heart issues but never told anybody. I keep replaying those words in my head like they’re an accusation. I know it’s not logical. I know years of fear don’t disappear just because you’re finally safe. But there’s a part of me that keeps thinking, we were so close. She was finally free. 

I keep wondering if her body just didn’t know how to exist without bracing for the next blow.
I’m drowning in what ifs. What if I had noticed sooner? What if I had forced her to see a doctor? What if we had left years ago? What if I had one more morning, one more cup of bad coffee with her?


The guilt is heavy and quiet. my job was to keep her safe and I failed.


The hospital notified the next of kin and they called my dad coz i couldn't bear to talk. My heart is in my throat the whole time and i didnt stop crying since yesterday. 

My sister sent a message saying she was sorry for my loss and nothing else. 

Im still in the same clothes as yesterday and couldnt eat . I just drank coffee and i guess this is what grief looks and feels like.
.

I dont feel hate anymore .  I don’t have the energy to unpack that.


Ny Dad keeps on blaming me for losing my Mom. He asked me to leave while he talked  to the M.E. He was cold towards me and  cpuldnt even look at me without being disgusted 
.
He decided for everything. The funeral home and everything. I only have my mom's personal belongings in my hands. Covered in sealed plastic. 

What I do know is my mom did not die afraid. She did not die behind closed doors. She did not die shrinking herself to keep someone else calm. For the first time in years, she lived quietly, gently, without permission. I hold onto that when the grief feels unbearable.
Nobody can replace her in my life. nobody will smell like her. nobody can ever cook like her.
My heart is in pain.

She was never absent in my life.


As i type this and as i sit here outside the ME's office. Ill tell u the truth. Losing someone you love is like dying with them.
She took ny heart with her.


And if you’re reading this and you’re hesitating to leave, or you’re waiting for the right time, please don’t.

I miss her more than I have words for. I hope, wherever she is, she finally feels at peace.

I wont update anymore. Theres no sense in doing that. The only person who cared for me also left me.

A pearly white grin is always in vogue. It is among the very few and the easiest ways to uplift your self-esteem and to improve your overall look. With the help of modern cosmetic dentistry, you can have a marvelous and glowing smile in no time, after just one treatment.

Still, one of the biggest questions that people put to the dentists is: “How long will my teeth whitening last?”

The reality is that teeth whitening does not last for good but the brightness of the results depends on different factors like your oral hygiene, diet, and lifestyle. The positive side is that you can take care of your whitening results and have a shining smile for many years to come with the right care.

Let’s investigate how long the effect of teeth whitening will last, which are the reasons for discoloration and what are the ways to keep the smile so dazzling.

# 1. How Long Does Teeth Whitening Last?

The permanence of your teeth whitening results relies on the selected treatment and the following proper oral care.

# Professional In-Clinic Whitening

* **Duration:** 1 to 3 years (with proper maintenance)
* **Details:** Under dental supervision, stronger whitening agents like hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide are used. Professional whitening gives an instant and very noticeable effect, usually brightening your teeth by a few shades already after one session.

# At-Home Whitening Kits (from your dentist)

* **Duration:** 6 months to 1 year
* **Details:** Custom-made trays and professional whitening gel are utilized at home. The effects appear slowly, but they can be long-lasting if touch-ups are done.

# Over-the-Counter Whitening Products

* **Duration:** 2 to 6 months
* **Details:** The whitening strips, toothpastes, and gels are gentle and inexpensive, but they provide the least effective and shortest lasting results when compared to professional treatments.

**Pro Tip:** If you prefer a whitening that lasts the longest, opt for professional in-office whitening together with regular maintenance using dentist-recommended at-home kits.

# 2. Why Teeth Lose Their Whiteness Over Time

Even after teeth whitening, the brightness of your teeth may slowly fade with time because of extrinsic (surface) or intrinsic (internal) staining.

**Common Reasons for Staining:**

* **Coffee, tea, and red wine:** They are all rich in tannins, which is the reason for their staining effect on teeth.
* **Smoking or tobacco use:** It leads to the formation of deep yellow or brown stains.
* **Pigmented foods:** This group consists of fruits such as berries, spices like curry, sauces like soy and tomato-based ones.
* **Sugary and acidic drinks:** Erode enamel, making it more prone to staining.
* **Poor oral hygiene:** It causes plaque to accumulate which in turn masks the teeth’ natural brightness.
* **Age:** The enamel gradually gets thinner, and the darker dentin layer gets more visible.
* **Some drugs:** Tetracycline and similar antibiotics are responsible for the same internal browning of teeth as they do externally by their staining effect.

Discoloration is a natural process that can be minimized significantly through conscientious practices and thus, your smile will last longer.

# 3. How to Make Teeth Whitening Last Longer

These are some of the best-known methods for keeping a white smile after bleaching:

1. **Maintain Excellent Oral Hygiene** Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and whitening toothpaste to brush your teeth two times a day. Use dental floss every day to get rid of the plaque that forms between teeth, which is often inaccessible to the toothbrush.
2. **Rinse After Eating or Drinking** After eating or drinking staining foods or drinks, rinse your mouth with water right away. This small action can keep the colors from sinking into your enamel.
3. **Use a Straw for Beverages** For coffee, tea, or soda use a straw so that there is less direct contact with your teeth. It’s a minor adjustment that yields a huge impact.
4. **Avoid Smoking and Tobacco** Tobacco is one of the quickest methods to stain teeth. Stopping smoking not only benefits your mouth but also keeps your whitening results longer.
5. **Choose Teeth-Friendly Foods** Have crunchy fruits like apples, carrots, and celery for snacks. They are natural cleaners, removing the surface stains and increasing the saliva secretion.
6. **Schedule Regular Dental Cleanings** Go to the dentist every 6 months for a professional clean up and polishing. This goes to the removing of plaque and tartar that has built up and that toothbrushing cannot get rid of.
7. **Use Touch-Up Treatments** Inquire your dentist about whitening touch-ups every 6-12 months to revitalize your effect. A speedy at-home session can keep your teeth shining.
8. **Stay Hydrated** Sipping a lot of water not only aids in the removal of food particles and pigments but also helps maintain a neutral pH level in your oral cavity.

# 4. Myths About Teeth Whitening Longevity

Whitening processes are surrounded by a lot of myths. Its time to get rid of some of them:

**Myth 1: Whitening damages enamel.**

**Truth:** In-office teeth whitening is a safe procedure for the enamel and it is effective when it is used in combination with dental supervision. It gets rid of discoloration without making the teeth more fragile.

**Myth 2: Once whitened, teeth stay white forever.**

**Truth:** The effect of bleaching is very long-lasting but not endless. To keep the whiteness, maintenance and touch-ups are required.

**Myth 3: Whitening works the same for everyone.**

**Truth:** The effects of teeth whitening vary depending on the tooth color chosen, the individual’s age, and the kind of discoloration experienced. Probably, several sessions will be required for the happiest and brightest look.

**Myth 4: Whitening toothpaste is enough.**

**Truth:** The use of whitening toothpaste can get rid of stains that are just on the surface but will not change the color of the tooth itself. It is a good practice to use this type of toothpaste only as a follow-up to professional whitening procedures.

# 5. What to Expect After Teeth Whitening

It is common for people to experience slight tooth sensitivity after whitening that lasts for a few days. The reason for this is that the whitening agents used to whiten teeth are opening up the tiny pores in the enamel temporarily.

To ease discomfort:

* Use desensitizing toothpaste.
* Avoid very hot or cold foods for a couple of days.
* Brush with lukewarm water.

Sensitivity usually fades within 48–72 hours, and your bright smile will continue to shine comfortably.

# 6. The Role of Your Dentist in Whitening Maintenance

A trusted dentist does more than whiten your teeth they help you protect your investment.

* Whitening treatments that are tailored for enamel type
* Post-whitening use of desensitizing and enamel-strengthening gels

1. Prepare well for your placements. If you don't have workex, do some internships, or whatever you can to fill up your CV with keywords before you join your MBA. Everything is all fun and happiness in those 2 years, but if you don't end up with a good job, many of us won't look at those times with affection.


2. Even if you don't have a profile good enough for getting into consulting, still prepare case studies and guesstimates. They for sure will increase your knowledge, structure your thinking and teach you excellent verbalisation of your thoughts. 

  



3. Don't join your MBA without a good Master CV and having all the failures, achievements, learnings, PORs and impact of whatever you've done in your grad, school, personal life, workex and internships. This will save you 10x efforts while preparing your CV and batch profile as well as you'll already have answers to 80% of the HR questions.



4. Shortlists for summers and finals are a very random process. So don't get disheartened of all your homies and girls get good shortlists but you don't. You'll soon get one too. All you can do is prepare a good CV and then hope for the best. You CANNOT target a shortlist. That's not how it works. However if you are fixated on a company, you can do your fucking absolute best in its case competition and get a PPI. 



5. Unless you want to get in the Dean's merit list or something, MBA grades don't really matter. Just don't fail anything. Anything above 7.5 is okay



6. The people around you decide what kind of 2 years you'll have. Trust me, you become an average of the people you spend your time most with. So find out good people and stick to them. 

  



7. Be kind and polite and do a couple of things for those around you. Create a sense of reciprocity.  

 



8. If the golden rule is ""Do to people what you'd like to be done to you"" then the platinum rule is that ""Do to people what they'd like to be done to them"".

 

9. Be respectful and talk well to people. Looks for sure matter, but not as much as we think they do and they're just an entry level criteria. 

  

10. MBA is that time when you may or may not have money, but you have all the freedom you want. Make good use of it. 

 

11. Relationships. Be clear about what you want: whether its something serious or casual or whether you don't have clarity. Be honest and communicate this to the potential partners you might be having. I've seen people giving false commitments and then withdrawing, leaving the other person broken beyond repair. Do not cheat. Don't hurt anyone, because trust me, when the hurt person has the last laugh, you'll be walking out of college with 0 credibility and respect. 

12. Draw clear boundaries with people, and stick to them. What makes you uncomfortable, communicate about it. 

 
13. Not everyone is worth the effort. You'll find some people who are extremely selfish and will take a lot from you, but show their true colours when it becomes inconvenient for them. They will have 0 reciprocity. Instead of wasting your time on such people, focus on the ones you want to keep forever. However DO NOT burn your bridges.

14. People won't remember you for the gpa you got or the placement you got. They'll remember you for how you made them feel. So be a good person, be kind and very polite. Create a sense of debt in people. You never know which company you might want to get referred to in the future :)  

 

15. Your health is extremely important: both mental and physical. Visit your campus therapist and keep exercising. Keep your room pleasent and clean. 

16. Be very clear about money. It is the biggest factor that spoils relationships. Make splitwise your best friend. Talk to your circle and decide whether you'll be adding the 18 rupees sutta, 20 rupees coffee, 50 rupees auto kind of expenses to your splitwise. Because with time, the law of averages catches up and you all end up spending more or less equally on these miscellaneous expenses. But if only 1 or 2 people pay all the time, the amount unaccounted for can  reach in 10000s by the end of 2 years. So be clear about this.

17. Use the CATS principle: Compliment, appreciate, thank, sorry. People who speak well do get an unfair advantage. Also, the quality of your network matters, not the quantity. 

18. Learn about your summer internship company and if you do want to continue full time with it, give your best for a PPO. A PPO makes your second year extremely chill. Remember, getting a PPO is more about how you gel with your boss and the team. So be polite and respectful there as well. You may or may not achieve all your deliverables in the project, but what kind of relationship you had with the coworkers plays a large part in getting a PPO. 

19. Get out of your comfort zone or your MBA will be just another 2 years of your life. A moment outside the comfort zone leads to a story for life. 

Finally, be humble, respect everyone and bahoot maje karo. You'll never have such resources to spend ever again.

1q07ffr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nobuy/comments/1q07ffr/my_nolow_buy_2026_rules/,My No/Low Buy 2026 Rules,"Hi Everyone,

I am loving reading everyone's no/low buy rules and thought I'd share mine for 2026, as well as some purchases I made in 2025 that I am really happy with.

I did a low-buy 2025 but wanted to really rein it in further for this year. My goal is to reduce consumerism and only buy things that are necessary or that are BiFL (or super long-term). I am not concerned with saving money as I already have decent habits - but I want to focus more on being mindful of what I own and ensuring that everything has a purpose, and I am not falling into the trap of buying something just to get the dopamine rush.

Happy to hear thoughts. My rules haven't changed much for 2026, but I did spend a bit on stationery and hobby stuff (I love crochet, painting, colouring, etc) and want to stop purchases of anything related until I have fully used and appreciated what I already have.

Also, just to note, I live in Melbourne, Australia, and, like many places in the world, the cost of living has gone up A LOT in the last few years, so if I do end up saving in the long run, that would be great.

**Fav purchases from 2025:**

* $250 - Blundstone #1671 Boots - super durable, great for work and walking around, can easily be dressed up or down. Worn at least 75 times so far and has zero wear/tear! There was also a deal on, so I got a free polish, waterproofing cream, and socks (worth $50 total for extras).
* $480 - DeLonghi Coffee Machine - I was buying a coffee daily for about $5-6. I bought a machine on sale and buy fresh whole beans from a local roastery that is focused on sustainability and ethical consumption. 1kg of beans gives me around 100 cups of coffee. Even with milk and descaling solution, it works out to be approx 65c per coffee, so this machine 'paid for itself' in less than 4 months.
* Better Cat Food - I have 2 cats. I used to give them cheap food from the grocery store. But after researching it and realising I was feeding them the equivalent of cat fast food every day, I switched them over to a better brand that I buy online through a subscribe and save. I've noticed that even though the tins are smaller in quantity, the cats are less hungry and seem more settled between meals. My older cat was also always underweight, and since switching her over she has gained a bit even though she's eating a smaller quantity. My older cat's coat has also improved a lot, and their teeth are healthier as well. The vet is very happy.

**2026 No-Buy Rules:**

* All purchases (except green-lights or emergencies) should be considered for at least 24 hours beforehand.
* Items being replaced should be of quality - focus on longevity
* NO fast fashion
* NO new hobbies
* Research everything first
* 1-day wait for every $50 an item is worth.
* If I REALLY want something (e.g. a new book), then I can request it as a birthday/Christmas gift from others.
* 1-item-in = 1-item-out

**Questions to Ask Before Buying:**

* Am I bored? Stressed? Why am I buying this?
* Is this necessary?
* Where will this go?
* Could I borrow this from someone else?
* Could I create this myself?
* If I need to dispose of this, where will it end up? Is it recyclable?
* How long will this last?
* Would I still buy if this were 2x the price?

**Green Light Items (Always Yes)**

* Bills (home, phone, car, insurance, etc...)
* Petrol/transport
* Cat - food/vet visits/council registration
* Groceries - meal prep for most days. I buy lots of good quality foods - would rather spend more on food items sourced ethically (e.g. free-range eggs from local farms) than save and buy something that isn't ethical (e.g. caged eggs) - no judgement on others who do/think differently, this is a personal preference.
* Medication (regular meds and anything necessary - e.g antibiotics if dr prescribes)
* Gifting (birthday and Christmas gifts - I do not want to be stingy to others, so I will buy them what they want. But want to focus on providing more experiences than stuff - so will buy things like vouchers for massage, hot springs, cinemas, restaurants etc...)
* Specific Self-Care (psych, remedial massage 4x yearly)
* Experiences under $150. I am VERY introverted, so I want to get out more with friends.
* New running/walking shoes - current ones are 7+ years old and hurt from wearing for >1hr. Also, all the foam/padding has disintegrated!
* New glasses - current ones are scratched. I can deal with it, but if they get worse will need to replace them.

**Yellow Light Items (Repair or Replace)** \- *Can only purchase if: the item is completely used up (e.g. shampoo, coffee beans); there are not alternatives I already own; it is not repariable; it would be unhealthy/unhygenic to not replace (e.g. new underwear if old ones are too worn); or if it would cost more to fix.*

* Clothing
* Skincare (basics only when product is used up - no new items added to routine)
* Makeup (basics only when product is used up - no new items added to routine)
* Coffee beans
* toiletries (basics only when product is used up - no new items added to routine)
* Broken items unable to be repaired (e.g., flat tyre)

**Red Light - NO!**

* New clothing
* furniture/home decor
* hobby items - must use everything I have.
* stationery
* books
* technology
* fast food
* shoes (except new trainers)
* anything gaming
* subscriptions (I have Audible and netflix but am cancelling both)
* jewellery and accessories
* anything from Temu/Amazon Haul/Shein/ASOS etc...
* Candles/Scented oils/Perfumes
* Cat toys - they have so many!",2,1767167410.0,nobuy,0,1.0,False

Started when we were fifteen and they had an obsessive crush on me. I realise I was the sorta type who never wants to say bye and only sees the idea of someone instead of them. So you can imagine how it has gone down.

This frienship has held me back a lot. Always wondering how they feel while they  get to do the ”idk why I didn’t invite you” ”I didn’t think of that”.

For the longest time I have felt that I am the problem. I haven’t felt at ease when beinh around them. I just don’t feel myself around them. I become a sad, passive aggressive person when I am with them and I just somehow really don’t like their personality.

I suppose I have finally let go of the idea of them and just don’t like them. Nor do I like myself around them.

They keep asking me for a coffee, we have had major talks where they do the ”idk” act and it doens’t go anywhere. So coffees is all we have right now, and I sort of don’t feel like doing it anymore because I want friendships that feel exciting to go for that coffee and chat about life. With us it feels forced, we don’t know eachother anymore and don’t really care enough to involve each other in our lives.

I know I could fix this if I wanted to. I could again show what else we can do than just coffee, how for them to understand. But I just do not feel like it because I should rather spend that energy on myself and new friendships. I am sick of being the ”bigger person”.

And normally I think it’s me who it at fault, that I am overreacting, I am the problem for having such feelings but in 2026, I shall listen to what I feel and take my distance if that’s what makes me feel better.",1,1767167233.0,Life,1,1.0,False

Here's what I've tried...

1.  Premade concentrate from Sam's a few years ago...horrible.  I don't remember the brand, but it wasn't SB or DD.  

2.  Premade DD in a bottle.  Again, a while back.  Not sure if it was originally refrigerated or just after I opened.  Still too bitter.

3.  Buying a separate cold brew container with the mesh filter to make concentrate, and also even just making it hot (regular strength) and then chilling it to use the next AM, which was ok but not great.


I love McDonald's Iced Coffee (caramel), and of course Starbucks and Dunkin... usually caramel.

I ask about their budget, they feel priced out and the conversation usually ends there. I have been lucky enough to fall into some equipment for my home setup and I totally blew past the delonghi/breville phase. I never had any experience with them and I’ve always brushed them off as something they shouldn’t even bother with. Well today, my curiosity got the best of me and I brought a Breville Cafe Aroma home from Goodwill. After a good deep clean and a few trial shots, I did it! I made good espresso with a cheap machine! I’m sure my grinder did most of the work, but I’m pretty blown away by the results. The shot had nice crema, flavor had a great balance of milk chocolate and mango, and it only took 4 shots to get there. I then took it a step further and tried the steam wand to make an oat milk capp - that was just ok, and could use more practice. But hey, after today, I’m a believer, with a decent grinder, you can pull a damn good shot on a cheap espresso machine.

I’m feeling really stuck and could use some outside perspective.

So i’m in the early stages of opening a modern Filipino-inspired coffee shop, and I know the design/theme is going to represent my brand long-term. I keep going back and forth between two different aesthetics:

-Dark, moody mountain vibe with concrete, black/white marble, lots of plants, earthy tones, very modern and grounded
-Light, airy, surfy vibe with browns and blues, bright, coastal, relaxed, more California-inspired (i am in CA)

Both feel authentic to different parts of me and Filipino culture in different ways, and I’m having a hard time committing to one. I need something that feels timeless, intentional, not JUST trendy and I like BOTH ideas. 

For those of you who love coffee shops or branding/design: what kind of space do you naturally gravitate toward? Or what do you think fits a modern Filipino concept better? Thanks for the help I really appreciate it. ",1,1767166764.0,Coffee_Shop,1,1.0,False

Chapter 1

In the fifth year of our long-distance relationship, I was thinking of getting married, but Elijah Harrington broke up with me.

""Sera, we've dragged this out long enough. Let's just end things here.""

My birthday dinner turned into an unexpected breakup.

My dad had fallen seriously ill and wanted to see Elijah one last time, but he blocked my number.

I cried and knelt as I begged him, but he remained indifferent.

""You know, seeing you cry doesn't hurt me at all. I simply find it annoying.""

After hearing that, I gave up on trying to save our relationship.

A year later, I had become a well-known jewelry designer.

As I faced the interviewer, I smiled calmly.

""I'm thankful for my ex-boyfriend, Elijah Harrington. I turned the pain he inflicted on me into inspiration.

""But I will never forgive him.""

In front of the screen, Elijah sighed and looked out of the window.

The moon was still the same, but he was no longer the boy he used to be.

\*\*\*

When he told me he wanted to break things off, I froze in place.

I couldn't bring myself to present the pair of rings I had prepared.

""Let's break up.""

Elijah repeated once more.

""Sera, we've dragged this out long enough. Let's just end things here.""

It felt as if the world had exploded into silence around me.

It took me several seconds to react.

""Why? Haven't we been doing fine?""

He turned his head to look out the window.

""That's just what you think. No sane person can handle five years of long-distance.""

I hurried to explain, ""I've already talked to my company. I'll be transferring to another branch, and we'll be closer then...""

Elijah shook his head, cutting me off.

""It's too late. I don't want this anymore.""

He was calm and cold, like a stranger.

Tears filled my eyes, but I forced them back.

Had he fallen for someone else?

Or was he truly tired of our relationship?

Just then, a waiter came out with a cake, ready to sing a birthday song.

""Go away.""

Elijah spoke sharply, his voice ice-cold.

The waiter froze, then quickly understood and backed away with the cart.

""Don't contact me ever again.""

Without sparing me a glance, Elijah turned around and walked away decisively.

I quietly stood up and took the train home.

My tears didn't stop flowing the entire ride.

I had planned to propose to him on my 26th birthday, but all I got was a breakup.

Before I even got home, a WhatsApp message popped up on my phone.

""Seraphina, did you and Elijah break up? Why did he just announce that he's dating another woman?""

I paused for a moment, then quickly checked his Instagram with shaky hands.

His most recent upload was two minutes ago.

In the photo, he stood next to a girl as they posed in front of the Ferris wheel I'd been dying to go to.

""Celebrating our first day together.""

Mutual friends were already liking and commenting on his post.

""You've finally accepted Janice's confession, huh? Congratulations, Eli. You two look great together.""

""So sweet! You two are perfect together.""

My phone kept buzzing with messages.

""Seraphina, weren't you guys celebrating your birthday earlier? Did he cheat on you?""

""No way. You two were together for five years. We were waiting for your wedding!""

""You shouldn't have been doing long-distance. Honestly, it's kind of your fault. You cared too much about work.""

I didn't reply to any of their messages, because my heart felt like it was breaking apart.

As it turned out, Elijah had fallen in love with someone else.

He wasn't tired—he found something newer, more exciting.

I collapsed on the couch and stared blankly at the photo wall in front of me.

There was a photo of us at the amusement park, with him teasing me with the cotton candy in his hand.

Another photo showed him walking along the beach at sunset, carrying me on his back.

And a photo of us in the library, where we secretly held hands under the table.

\*\*\*

All the memories surged over me like a tide, drowning me in an instant.

I remembered the night he confessed as the Pink Moon hung high in the sky.

His palms had been sweaty from nerves.

""Seraphina, this is for you.""

The round, rose-quartz pendant shimmered in the moonlight.

""People say the Pink Moon is a good omen. I think it's cheering me on.""

His eyes burned with passion.

""Seraphina, from now on, we'll celebrate our anniversary on this very night, okay?""

I nodded happily.

For five years, no matter how busy we were, we video-called every day.

When I got sick and had surgery, he took time off work just to take care of me.

When my grandmother passed away, he attended as my future husband and helped with everything.

When my dad's business struggled, he used all his savings to help my family get through it.

He treated me like a princess.

I moved to Seattle to grow my career, the city that offered the best opportunities for jewelry designers.

Meanwhile, Elijah worked at a public-sector firm back home—stable, just like he always wanted.

We both had goals to achieve, but we were fine with doing long-distance.

He'd fallen sick last month, so I rushed home in a panic.

I took an overnight train to see him, but he just smiled and waved it off.

""It's nothing serious. You didn't need to come.""

But I could see his pale face, drenched in cold sweat.

After thinking it through, I made up my mind.

I applied for a transfer. That way, I could be closer to Elijah.

I even mustered up the courage to propose to him as a surprise.

But little did I imagine...

""I don't love you anymore.

""This is too exhausting.

""Let's end things here.""

Those words kept echoing in my ears.

I curled up and buried my face in my knees, trying to ignore the cold.

All those sweet memories now left a bitter sting in my heart.

My throat was so dry it hurt to swallow.

Chapter 2

I didn't sleep at all that night.

By morning, my eyes were swollen.

All of a sudden, I received a call from my mom.

""Seraphina, your dad got into an accident and is suffering from a brain hemorrhage. Come home with Elijah.""

My hands were shaking as I stuttered in panic.

""I... I'll come back right away.""

""Remember to bring Elijah along. Your dad has something to tell him...""

My mom choked up, unable to continue.

A terrible feeling rose in my chest. Was my dad preparing his last words?

I didn't have time to explain anything. I grabbed my luggage and rushed to the train station.

On the way, I kept calling Elijah.

I called him over and over again, but he never answered.

I was so anxious that all I could do was pray silently.

Eventually, he answered.

""Elijah, my dad is in the hospital. Something's happened to him. Please come with me to visit him...""

He was silent for two seconds before speaking, his voice filled with disgust.

""Seraphina, I didn't expect you to be this heartless.""

I froze, confused.

""You'd even curse your dad just so you'd have a reason to reach out to me. Where's your conscience?""

I rushed to explain, ""No, I'm telling the truth. My mom just called...""

Elijah cut me off impatiently.

""Enough! Even if your dad is sick, I'm not a doctor. What do you need me for?

""Seraphina, if you keep this up, I'll call your parents myself and tell them we've broken up!""

""No!""

I begged him, my voice low and pleading.

""My parents think of you as their son-in-law. Now that my dad is seriously ill, he probably just wants to speak to you. Please, just see him... I'm not asking you to take responsibility.""

Elijah let out a cold laugh.

""You want me to go along with your act? To fool a dying man?

""Seraphina, I'm not doing that!""

He hung up on me immediately.

My heart sank.

What was I supposed to do?

Left with no other choice, I went to the hospital alone.

My mom panicked when she saw me walking in by myself.

""Where's Elijah? Why isn't he here?""

I lowered my head and lied because I had no other choice.

""He's on a business trip and couldn't make it back in time...""

My mom sighed helplessly.

""Forget it. Let's hope your dad can hold on for a few more days.""

I finally saw my dad, with his mouth slightly drooping and his body limp on the bed. He couldn't even move.

""Sera... Elijah... You've got to look out for each other...""

My tears fell uncontrollably, and I didn't know what to say.

That night, my dad was sent back into the ICU.

Standing outside the ICU, I held my mom up. Neither of us had any idea what would happen.

My mom held my hand, her tone earnest.

""Your dad is always worrying about you. But now that you have Elijah, he'll have no regrets as long as you two live happily.""

I lowered my eyes, unsure what to say.

I was afraid that if I spoke, it wouldn't just break my heart but theirs, too.

How could I bear to add to their pain?

After holding on for two days, my dad passed away.

My mom cried until she could barely breathe.

""Why isn't Elijah here yet? He'll be here for the funeral, right?""

My heart dropped to my stomach.

I had already lost my dad, and I couldn't let my mom worry anymore.

I gritted my teeth and called Elijah again.

No one answered.

I sent him a message on WhatsApp, but it never got delivered.

He had blocked me.

A chill ran down my spine. I could hardly believe how someone who'd been so good to me could turn into a stranger within days.

A wave of anger and resentment surged through me, and I decided to find him.

Chapter 3

When the door opened, Elijah frowned.

""What exactly do you want?""

I looked at him with teary eyes.

""Elijah, I know you don't love me anymore.

""But I just lost my dad. For the sake of what we used to have, could you please attend his funeral? My mom has been asking for you...""

Elijah froze, realizing my dad had actually died. His eyes turned slightly red.

He lowered his head briefly, then looked at me again.

""I'm sorry. Even if what you said is true, I still can't go.""

Shocked, I instinctively reached out and grabbed his arm.

""Why? After five years together, you dumped me just like that. Can't you even do me this one favor?""

""Just because we'd been together for five years?""

He let out a derisive laugh.

""Wake up, Seraphina. There's no point dwelling on that.""

He stepped forward and looked down at me.

""I've made it clear that I don't love you anymore. Why would I show up at the funeral as your boyfriend? Don't make things difficult, alright?""

""Elijah, I'm begging you. My mom can't take another blow...""

I reached out, trying to grab his sleeve.

He stepped back to avoid me, the disgust in his eyes evident.

""Seraphina, have some dignity, will you?""

Dignity? What was left of it?

My legs gave out, and I collapsed to my knees with a thud.

""Please, Elijah. I'm begging you... If not for me, then for how my parents treated you. They've been nothing but kind...""

I clutched the hem of his pants, humiliating myself like a groveling dog.

Elijah stiffened, a flicker of pain in his eyes before they turned even colder.

He slowly but firmly pulled his pant leg out of my grip.

""You know what? Seeing you cry doesn't hurt me at all. I simply find it annoying.""

I froze at his words.

Suddenly, a soft voice came from inside the room.

""Who is it, Eli?""

A girl rubbed her sleepy eyes, looking like she had just woken up.

I was stunned to see her wearing Elijah's pajamas.

""Are you two already...""

Elijah wrapped an arm around the girl and said with a smile, ""Say hi to my new girlfriend, Janice Keaton.

""She's my junior, and the department head's daughter.

""She's younger, prettier, and able to give my career a boost. Who do you think I'd prefer between the two of you?""

I shook my head in disbelief.

""No, you're not that kind of person...""

Elijah let out a cold laugh and cut me off impatiently.

""Looks like you don't know me at all.

""Any man would make the same choice.

""Seraphina, stop lying to yourself. Leave.""

He didn't spare me another glance and shut the door.

I remained kneeling on the ground, numb and lifeless.

The world around me spun in a blur, leaving me to deal with the humiliation and coldness.

Chapter 4

I came up with all kinds of excuses to calm my mom down and took care of my dad's funeral arrangements first.

""Mom, why don't you come to Seattle and stay with me? We can keep each other company.""

My mom shook her head.

""You and Elijah will be busy with your own lives, and I'd only be an inconvenience. I'll visit when you have a baby, okay?""

Hearing the hope in her voice, I covered my mouth and struggled not to cry.

My mom seemed to sense something and looked at me suspiciously.

""Sera, what's wrong? Did you and Elijah fight?""

I shook my head and wiped my tears.

""No, I'm just worried about you being alone.""

My mom pulled me into her arms, patted my shoulder, and didn't ask again.

A week later, I returned to Seattle.

But the doorway was piled with delivery boxes.

They were all from Elijah.

I recognized every single item.

On top was the gray scarf I had stayed up late knitting.

The stitches were uneven, but Elijah laughed while saying it was the warmest scarf in the world, and he'd wear it every winter.

Under it was the ceramic mug we'd bought on our first trip together.

Our initials were carved on the side, and he said he'd drink coffee from it for the rest of his life.

Now, he had returned everything that held sentimental value or precious memories we once shared.

It seemed like he was getting rid of trash.

Even after finishing an entire bottle of wine, I still couldn't get over it.

I used an alternate account to stalk Elijah's social media, hoping to find something from the past.

But he had deleted everything without a trace.

How had he moved on so quickly?

""Elijah, you bastard!""

I hugged my knees and cried over and over again.

Nicole Laufer, my best friend, called me two weeks later.

Her voice was full of worry.

""How are you, Seraphina?""

""I'm fine.""

I pretended to stay calm.

""Fine? I heard all about it. Elijah's such a jerk!""

Nicole was so angry that she started crying. After a while, she sounded hesitant.

""Seraphina, I don't know if I should tell you about...""

""What is it?""

At this point, what else could possibly hurt me?

Nicole's voice grew emotional again.

""Elijah and Janice just announced that they're getting married tomorrow.""

My heart dropped instantly.

Already?

We'd broken up less than a month ago, yet he was already getting married.

They must've been dating each other way before that.

""Seraphina? Seraphina? Are you okay?""

Nicole called my name several times before I finally snapped back to my senses.

""I'm fine.""

Nicole was furious.

""Forget about that jerk. Tomorrow, I'll introduce you to some hot guys. All of them are way better-looking than Elijah.

""How about my brother? He's great too.""

As I listened to her endless chatter, I gradually calmed down.

""Trust me, I'm fine. Right now, nothing matters except my job and my mom...""

Halfway through our conversation, another call came in.

It was my mom.

On the other end, she was crying and panicking.

""Sera, why is Elijah marrying someone else? He even sent me a wedding invitation!""

Boom!

I froze in place, feeling as though I'd been struck by lightning.

Why would Elijah do that to my mom? After all, he knew she'd just lost her husband...

I clenched my fists in anger, holding back my tears.

""It's a long story, Mom...""

My mom stayed quiet for several seconds before realizing I had admitted we'd broken up.

""No wonder he wouldn't come visit your dad, or even attend the funeral... What will you do now?""

I hurried to comfort her.

""It's okay, Mom. I'll be fine. I might meet someone better in the future...""

Suddenly, I heard something heavy fall to the ground on her end.

""Mom? Mom! Mom!""

I shouted anxiously, but there was no response.

I immediately dialed 911, then headed out to catch a taxi.

A while later, I received a message from the doctor.

""Your mother fainted and has been taken to the hospital.""

I stayed calm and kept urging the driver to go faster.

""Please be faster, Sir.""

The driver understood my situation and quickly reassured me.

""Sure thing. Don't worry, I'll get you there quickly.""

It was already late at night. As the car turned, a truck suddenly sped toward us.

Bang!

A deafening crash followed.

My vision went blank as I passed out.

By the time I woke up, I found myself in the hospital. My eyes hurt terribly.

My mom was crying beside me, her voice trembling.

""Sera... My poor daughter...""

I opened my eyes. When I caught my reflection in the glass in front of me, I froze.

My left eye was wrapped in thick gauze, and my right eye looked horrifyingly bloodshot.

""What happened to me, Mom?""

My mom held me tightly, guilt written all over her face.

""Glass shards got into your eyes. They had to remove your left eyeball...""

The news hit me like a ton of bricks, and I went completely still.

Right then, messages kept popping up on my phone.

""Seraphina, Elijah just got married.""

In the photo, Elijah had his hand around Janice's waist as they kissed.

My phone slipped from my hand, shattering as it hit the ground.

Likewise, my heart was in pieces.

Not from sadness, but from pure anger and regret.

I swore I would never forgive Elijah for what he'd done.

Two days later, I needed another surgery to fit a prosthetic eye.

I had just been wheeled into the operating room when the anesthesia kicked in, and my consciousness began to fade.

Suddenly, a burst of noise came from the hallway.

""Make way! Emergency case! Neurosurgery, get ready!""

The voices were close, pausing right outside my door.

""Hang in there, Eli...""

It felt like someone was calling Elijah's name.

I struggled to turn my head toward the sound.

A gurney rushed past with a man on it.

The person's face and jawline looked way too familiar.

Wasn't Elijah supposed to be on honeymoon with Janice? Why was he here?

It seemed impossible.

I must've hated him so much that I was hallucinating.

At that moment, the man on the gurney turned his head ever so slightly.

# LoRA Pilot (The Last Docker Image You'll Ever Need)

Pod template at RunPod: https://console.runpod.io/deploy?template=gg1utaykxa&ref=o3idfm0n

> Your AI playground in a box - because who has time to configure 17 different tools?
Ever wanted to train LoRAs but ended up in dependency hell? We've been there. LoRA Pilot is a **magical container** that bundles everything you need for AI image generation and training into one neat package. No more crying over broken dependencies at 3 AM.

##  What's in the box?
- **🎨 ComfyUI** (+ ComfyUI-Manager preinstalled) - Your node-based playground
- **🏋️ Kohya SS** - Where LoRAs are born (web UI included!)
- **📓 JupyterLab** - For when you need to get nerdy
- **💻 code-server** - VS Code in your browser (because local setups are overrated)
- **🔮 InvokeAI** - Living in its own virtual environment (the diva of the bunch)
- **🚂 Diffusion Pipe** - Training + TensorBoard, all cozy together

Everything is orchestrated by **supervisord** and writes to **/workspace** so you can actually keep your work. Imagine that! 

Few of the thoughtful details that really bothered me when I was using other SD (Stable Diffusion) docker images:

- No need to take care of upgrading anything. As long as you boot :latest you will always get the latest versions of the tool stack
- If you want stabiity, just choose :stable and you'll always have 100% working image. Why change anything if it works? (I promise not to break things in :latest though)
- when you login to Jupyter or VS code server, change the theme, add some plugins or setup a workspace - unlike with other containers, your settings and extensions will persist between reboots
- no need to change venvs once you login - everything is already set up in the container
- did you always had to install mc, nano or unzip after every reboot? No more!
- there are loads of custom made scripts to make your workflow smoother and more efficient if you are a CLI guy; 
- Need SDXL1.0 base model? ""models pull sdxl-base"", that's it! 
- Want to run another kohya training without spending 30 minutes editing toml file?Just run ""trainpilot"", choose a dataset from the select box, desired lora quality and a proven-to-always-work toml will be generated for you based on the size of your dataset.
- need to manage your services? Never been easier: ""pilot status"", ""pilot start"", ""pilot stop"" - all managed by supervisord
---

## Default ports

| Service | Port |
|---|---:|
| ComfyUI | `5555` |
| Kohya SS | `6666` |
| Diffusion Pipe (TensorBoard) | `4444` |
| code-server | `8443` |
| JupyterLab | `8888` |
| InvokeAI (optional) | `9090` |

Expose them in RunPod (or just use my RunPod template - https://console.runpod.io/deploy?template=gg1utaykxa&ref=o3idfm0n).

---

## Storage layout

The container treats **`/workspace`** as the only place that matters.

Expected directories (created on boot if possible):

- `/workspace/models` (shared by everything; Invoke now points here too)
- `/workspace/datasets` (with `/workspace/datasets/images` and `/workspace/datasets/ZIPs`)
- `/workspace/outputs` (with `/workspace/outputs/comfy` and `/workspace/outputs/invoke`)
- `/workspace/apps`
  - Comfy: user + custom nodes under `/workspace/apps/comfy`
  - Diffusion Pipe under `/workspace/apps/diffusion-pipe`
  - Invoke under `/workspace/apps/invoke`
  - Kohya under `/workspace/apps/kohya`
  - TagPilot under `/workspace/apps/TagPilot` (https://github.com/vavo/TagPilot)
  - TrainPilot under `/workspace/apps/TrainPilot`(not yet on GitHub)
- `/workspace/config`
- `/workspace/cache`
- `/workspace/logs`

### RunPod volume guidance

The `/workspace` directory is the only volume that needs to be persisted. All your models, datasets, outputs, and configurations will be stored here. Whether you choose to use a network volume or local storage, this is the only directory that needs to be backed up.

**Disk sizing (practical, not theoretical):**
- Root/container disk: **20–30 GB** recommended 
- `/workspace` volume: **100 GB minimum**, more if you plan to store multiple base models/checkpoints.

---

## Credentials

Bootstrapping writes secrets to:

- `/workspace/config/secrets.env`

Typical entries:
- `JUPYTER_TOKEN=...`
- `CODE_SERVER_PASSWORD=...`

---


## Ports (optional overrides)
COMFY_PORT=5555
KOHYA_PORT=6666
DIFFPIPE_PORT=4444
CODE_SERVER_PORT=8443
JUPYTER_PORT=8888
INVOKE_PORT=9090
TAGPILOT_PORT=3333

## Hugging Face (optional but often necessary)
HF_TOKEN=...                 # for gated models
HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1  # faster downloads (requires hf_transfer, included)
HF_XET_HIGH_PERFORMANCE=1    # faster Xet storage downloads (included)

## Diffusion Pipe (optional)
DIFFPIPE_CONFIG=/workspace/config/diffusion-pipe.toml
DIFFPIPE_LOGDIR=/workspace/diffusion-pipe/logs
DIFFPIPE_NUM_GPUS=1
If DIFFPIPE_CONFIG is unset, the service just runs TensorBoard on DIFFPIPE_PORT.


## Model downloader (built-in)

The image includes a system-wide command:
• models (alias: pilot-models)
• gui-models (GUI-only variant, whiptail)

Usage:
• models list
• models pull <name> [--dir SUBDIR]
• models pull-all

## Manifest

Models are defined in the manifest shipped in the image:
	•	/opt/pilot/models.manifest

A default copy is also shipped here (useful as a reference/template):
	•	/opt/pilot/config/models.manifest.default

If your get-models.sh supports workspace overrides, the intended override location is:
	•	/workspace/config/models.manifest

(If you don’t have override logic yet, copy the default into /workspace/config/ and point the script there. Humans love paper cuts.)

## Example usage

# download SDXL base checkpoint into /workspace/models/checkpoints
models pull sdxl-base

# list all available model nicknames
models list

## Security note (because reality exists)

- supervisord can run with an unauthenticated unix socket by default.
- This image is meant for trusted environments like your own RunPod pod.
- Don’t expose internal control surfaces to the public internet unless you enjoy chaos monkeys.

## Support

This is not only my hobby project, but also a docker image I actively use for my own work. I love automation. Effectivity. Cost savings. 
I create 2-3 new builds a day to keep things fresh and working. I'm also happy to implement any reasonable feature requests.
If you need help or have questions, feel free to reach out or open an issue on GitHub.

1q0772d,https://i.redd.it/cl93v3fathag1.png,My Husband Thanked His Dead Wife on Live TV,"I watched my husband's award ceremony in the kitchen while chopping pork ribs.



The host asked who he wanted to thank most at this moment.



He pushed his gold-rimmed glasses up, his voice gentle and refined, ""I want to thank my late wife, Sophia White. She taught me what it truly means to have a literary soul.""



The cleaver in my hand paused for a moment, nearly cutting my finger.



The blood from the ribs splattered onto my apron, staining it like a wilting red rose.



For eight years, I had been his legal wife, his mother's personal caregiver.



But in his acceptance speech, I was the air—unseen, unmentioned, utterly invisible.



\*\*\*



At 7 PM, Jonathan Greene returned home with his prized students and a few colleagues.



The heating was cranked up inside, and they removed their coats to reveal their finely tailored suits and elegant dresses.



Gloria Greene, his mother, was in good spirits today. She sat in a wheelchair, pushed by Jonathan into the center of the living room to greet his students.



""Mrs. Greene, you look great. Professor Greene must be taking such good care of you.""



""Yes, it must be tough for Professor Greene, balancing his academic work with caring for his mother, especially after his wife passed so early.""



Everyone was praising Jonathan's deep devotion and resilience.



I walked out of the kitchen, carrying the beef stew I had simmered for three hours.



Steam rose from the pot, its rich aroma filling the room and drifting into every corner.



A young female student turned around and gave me a sweet smile. ""You're a maid, right? Could you please grab two more sets of utensils and some drinks?""



The living room fell silent for two seconds.



No one corrected her.



Jonathan, who was pouring water for the student, didn't even glance at me. ""Go get them, hurry up.""



In that moment, I felt like an undeveloped monkey, intruding into a gathering of civilized people.



I glanced down at my faded house dress and the plastic slippers stained with oil.



I looked like a maid indeed.



Not even as good as a maid, really—maids get paid by the hour. I only have my fixed 5,000-dollar ""household allowance"" each month.



I turned back to the kitchen, the bitterness rising in my throat like sour, spoiled water.



When I brought the utensils and drinks out, Jonathan was standing at the study door, silently mourning in front of a photograph of his late wife.



In the photo, Sophia wore a black evening gown, sitting at the piano, looking as graceful as a swan.



As I walked over to hand him the bowl of stew, Jonathan turned abruptly and bumped into me.



A sharp thud echoed in the silence.



The bowl of scalding stew tipped right over, spilling onto the edge of the table.



I knew how much he treasured this space, and instinctively, I raised my hand to block it.



The stew splattered, and some droplets even landed on the frame of the photo.



""What the hell are you doing?""



Jonathan's reaction was like a cat whose tail had been stepped on—he shoved me hard.



I stumbled two steps and crashed into the doorframe.



The back of my hand was burned red from the hot stew.



But Jonathan didn't even glance at me.



In a panic, he fumbled for a handkerchief, carefully wiping at the frame, his movements tender as if caressing a lover's face.



""Clumsy and useless, what else can you do?"" He shot me a glare, his eyes fierce as if he wanted to devour me. ""On such an important day, you really have to cause me trouble, don't you?""



In that moment, my hand burned with pain, but my heart turned to ice.



The students around me exchanged glances, and the girl who had called me ""ma'am"" muttered quietly, ""Professor Greene really cares about his wife. He wouldn't even let a picture get damaged.""



""Yes,"" another whispered back. ""It really is a love that never dies.""



They resumed praising this deeply moving love.



I stood in the shadow of the corner, clutching my swollen hand.



I watched the man I'd served for eight years, gazing with deep affection at a picture of a dead woman.



I looked at all the highly educated elites, who ignored a living, breathing woman standing right in front of them.



Suddenly, I realized—those eight years felt like a joke.



I was the Greene family's maid, I was Gloria's caregiver, but I was never Jonathan's wife.



That string that had been taut for eight years finally snapped in that moment.



I was done.



Chapter 2

I didn't eat; I went straight to my bedroom.



It was not really a bedroom; it was just a guest room that was once a storage closet.



The master bedroom was where Jonathan slept alone, or rather, where he slept with his memories of Sophia.



My room was only ever graced by his presence when he had… needs. When he expected me to fulfill my so-called duties as a wife.



I looked at myself in the mirror. My complexion was sallow, with fine lines around my eyes, my hair dry and lifeless like overgrown weeds.



I didn't look like I was 35; I could pass for 50.



Once the campus belle whose charm was known far and wide, I had now withered into little more than wild grass.



I remembered the first time I came to the Greene house.



The house was filthy, the air carried an unpleasant odor, and there was Jonathan—handsome, elegant, and utterly helpless.



After Gloria became paralyzed, her temper became volatile. She beat and scolded every caregiver, and none of them lasted more than three days.



Then I came. I became the exception.



Because I couldn't bear it, when I tried to resign, Jonathan's face was filled with helplessness and pleading.



And when I agreed to stay, the joy in his eyes was impossible to hide.



Later, when my family called, urging me to come home for an arranged marriage, I tried to resign again.



Jonathan said, ""Blind marriage is irresponsible to yourself. You know me and this family well, let me marry you.""



Thinking of the deep affection in his eyes when he looked at his late wife, I agreed on a whim.



I wanted that kind of look for myself.



I thought I could wait for it.



As the outside gradually quieted down, the guests left.



Jonathan pushed the door open, holding a plastic bag.



""Here."" He casually tossed it onto the bed.



It was a pair of knee pads. Woolen, they looked thick and sturdy.



My heart skipped a beat. Could it be because he felt bad for me after seeing my burned hand earlier?



Or maybe because it was our wedding anniversary, though he'd never remembered, perhaps subconsciously, he wanted to do something nice for me?



For a moment, the kind of desperate hope women get stirred inside me.



I reached out to touch the knee pads, about to soften and say something gentle.



Jonathan took off his tie, his tone cold, ""My mom's old leg pain flares up this time of year. These knee pads are good quality, put them on her tonight.""



""Also, make sure to wake up quickly when she gets up at night. Don't let her wet the sheets. Otherwise, it'll always smell in the room.""



My outstretched hand froze in the air. Like a fool slapped in public.



It wasn't for me. They were supplies for his mother.



And I was just the tool tasked with using them, the human tool.



""Also,"" Jonathan didn't even look at me as he turned to leave, ""the stew spilled earlier. Remember to mop the floor again tomorrow morning, don't leave any smell. Don't touch Sophia's desk again in the future.""



I wanted to laugh, but only managed a grimace that was worse than crying.



""Jonathan Greene."" I called out to him.



He stopped, a puzzled expression on his face. ""What now?""



""I want a divorce.""



Four words. I said them softly, but clearly.



Jonathan froze for a moment, then let out a sneer.



He looked at me like I was a child throwing a tantrum, and took out a stack of cash from his wallet.



Probably two or three thousand dollars.



With a slap, he tossed it onto the nightstand.



""Are you embarrassed because the students misunderstood you earlier? Fine, take the money and buy a couple of clothes. I'm tired. Don't stir up trouble.""



He walked away without looking back.



I followed him.



He didn't return to the master bedroom; instead, he went to the study.



The door was ajar.



I'd never entered there alone. Normally, I had to ask him before cleaning it.



Through the crack in the door, I saw Jonathan sitting at the Steinway piano.



I heard that it was Sophia's favorite piano when she was alive.



His long fingers gently caressed the keys, his expression soft, as if he were caressing a lover's skin.



That kind of gaze—I never received it even for a second in the eight years I had spent with him.



He murmured to the air, ""Sophia, I won an award today. If only you were here... it would be so perfect…""



I pushed the door open.



Jonathan suddenly turned around, that tenderness instantly turning into sharp ice. ""Who said you could come in here? Get out!""



I looked at the shiny black piano, then at the man who claimed to be my husband.



""I'm serious. I want a divorce.""



Jonathan didn't even bother to turn his head, his finger pressing a key, producing a crisp ""ding.""



""Claire, I transferred your allowance yesterday. If you want more money, just ask. Don't use these cheap tricks. It's low.""



In his eyes, all of my emotions could ultimately be converted into money.



I looked at his still handsome and refined face.



A wave of disgust surged inside me.



It was more disgusting than looking at his mother's bed sheets covered in filth.



""I mean it. We're getting divorced. Tomorrow.""



I turned and shut the door, leaving the man, still lost in his late wife's memories, locked in his own grave.



Chapter 3

It was 2 AM.



I heard a muffled thud coming from Gloria's room.



I almost instinctively jumped out of bed and rushed into the next room.



I called out for Jonathan.



But his room was empty.



He'd probably gone to the cemetery in the middle of the night to visit his beloved late wife again.



Gloria had a seizure, her body jerking like a fish out of water, foam pouring from her mouth, her eyes rolling back in her head.



I quickly turned her onto her side, cleared her mouth of any obstructions to prevent her from biting her tongue, and pressed on her pressure points.



These actions were so ingrained in me that they came automatically, like muscle memory after eight years of care.



Once Gloria calmed down a little, I hoisted the 160-pound woman onto my back.



I weigh only 120 pounds.



But I carried her step by step down the three flights of stairs, my legs trembling with every step.



I flagged down a taxi and headed straight to the hospital.



I tried calling Jonathan, but he didn't answer.



I had no choice but to send him a text.



At the emergency room, I checked in, found the doctor, and took her for a CT scan.



I was still in my pajamas, wearing those plastic slippers, my hair messy, and still covered in the filth Gloria had thrown up earlier.



This was my everyday life.



""Where's her family?"" the doctor asked, eyeing my appearance with hesitation. ""You're... the caregiver, right? Can you contact her immediate family?""



""I'm…""



""I'm her son!""



I heard hurried footsteps behind me.



Jonathan finally arrived.



He was dressed in a sharp suit, his hair meticulously combed, the scent of perfume—Sophia's favorite, called ""Encounters""—lingering in the air.



The contrast between him, so composed and elegant, and me, a mess of exhaustion and filth, was stark.



The doctor quickly changed his tone, a smile spreading across his face. ""Ah, Professor Greene, right? You're truly devoted, coming all the way here in the middle of the night.""



Jonathan smiled humbly, expertly wielding his cultured, intellectual persona.



Once the doctor left, he turned and finally noticed me.



The smile instantly vanished, replaced by the familiar look of reproach.



""What happened? Why did she have a sudden episode? Did you feed her something wrong at dinner? How could you let this happen?""



His voice wasn't loud, but it was loud enough for everyone to hear.



This was his logic. If she were sick, it was my fault.



If she got better, it was his devotion.



I didn't say a word. I simply carried Gloria from the gurney to the hospital bed, adjusted her pillow, and tucked her in.



Jonathan stood by, watching.



Ever since I entered this family, he hadn't lifted a finger—not a single household chore, not even pouring a glass of water for his own mother.



Because he said it was my job.



The woman in the bed next to us couldn't help but speak up. ""Wow, you really know what you're doing. So quick and efficient. You must be their housekeeper, huh? Really professional. If I could hire a housekeeper like you, I'd be set.""



My hand froze, mid-action, as I wiped Gloria's mouth.



Jonathan froze for a moment.



I just stared at him.



Even if he just said, ""This is my wife,"" or even if he just tried to gloss over it, it would have been better.



But he stayed silent for three seconds.



Jonathan nodded and casually said, ""Yeah, she's very professional.""



Boom.



The final thread of my sanity snapped.



Those three seconds of silence were far more painful than any of his earlier curses.



They shattered the last shred of my unrealistic hope, the last remnant of any affection I thought we shared after eight years of sacrifice.



I threw the towel I was holding at him. ""I'm officially resigning. You can take care of your mother yourself now!""



I turned and walked out.



Behind me, Jonathan lowered his voice and shouted, ""Claire! What the hell are you doing?! This is a hospital!""



I didn't look back, my steps quickening.



When I walked out of the hospital, the cold wind hit my face, and only then did I realize my face was drenched in tears.



But inside, I felt an unprecedented sense of relief.



Chapter 4

I returned to that so-called ""home"" and began packing my things.



There wasn't much. Aside from a few changes of clothes, almost nothing really belonged to me.



In his study, I opened the bottom drawer and found the ""prenatal contract"" from years ago.



It was a life-long contract of servitude.



It clearly stated: \[Party B (Claire Brooks) is responsible for Party A's (Gloria Greene's) daily living needs, and Party A (Jonathan Greene) will pay Party B a living allowance each month. During the marriage, Party B cannot interfere with Party A's private matters...\]



I ripped it to shreds.



Beside it was a ledger, detailing every expense he had tracked over the past eight years.



He had a habit of keeping records, every penny accounted for.



I hadn't cared about it before, but now, flipping through it, each entry cut like a knife.



\[April 2018: Maintenance of Sophia's grave, note: For my beloved wife, $5,000.\]



\[June 2018: Dental visit for Claire, note: labor maintenance fee, $800.\]



...



It turned out, to him, I was no different from the washing machine that needed repairs.



Looking at the records one by one, I felt my blood run cold, my stomach churning, and I rushed to the bathroom, dry-heaving for what felt like forever.



I threw my coat off, stomped on it, and crushed it into the ground.



The coat had an ""S"" on it.



Sophia.



I left everything he had marked as ""labor supplies"" in the ledger. Including the thin gold wedding ring, only two grams in weight.



It was bought when we got married. He said he didn't like anything too extravagant, that simplicity was best.



It wasn't that he didn't like extravagance; he just didn't like spending money on me.



When I was done packing, there was only a tattered plastic bag.



This was my eight years.



The door lock clicked. Jonathan was back.



Seeing the mess in the room, he furrowed his brow, his eyes filled with displeasure.



""Claire, haven't you made enough of a scene? My mother's still in the hospital. What are you doing here? Hurry up and go back to the hospital!""



I was still in my streetwear, but this time, I stood tall.



I placed the distorted gold ring on the coffee table, and it made a soft clink.



Then I smiled.



This was the first time in eight years that I had smiled so freely, so unrestrained in this house.



""Professor Greene, your free housekeeper Claire Brooks, is officially off the clock.""



""And that coat? I threw it in the trash. After all, it carries the gloom of the dead. Disgusting.""



Jonathan's face turned pale, like someone had slapped him hard.



""What did you say?""



""I said, I'll see you at the County Clerk's Office at 8 AM tomorrow. And, I'm a professional housekeeper, so make sure you pay the eight years' worth of salary into my account. Don't think about dodging it. Don't make me look down on you even more.""



With that, I stopped caring about him, grabbed the plastic bag, and stepped over the still-wet stew stain on the floor.",2,1767166513.0,romancenovels,2,1.0,False
1q076dk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1q076dk/aitah_for_breaking_up_with_my_girlfriend_for/,AITAH for breaking up with my girlfriend for almost cheating on me?,"me (17m) and my girlfriend (17f) have been dating since october 2025 but have known eachother for years before this. we met each other through church and have had an off and on friendship since 2022 because of life style choices. we both used to smoke and drink and party in middle school/high school but I stopped in 2023, which resulted in our friendship collapsing. she made some changes to her lifestyle in 2024 and started coming to church again. I quickly became attracted to her again and this year is when I finally caught feelings. the way she switched her life around and started living for Jesus was super inspiring and attractive to me. I started talking to my youth pastor about wanting to date her, and he said high school relationships never end well. I also talked to my therapist, parents, friends and they all said it wasn’t a good idea. until october came around, and I decided not to take their advice.

anyways, onto the story-

this last saturday after christmas she told me she was going to a party. she does this a lot so I expected it to just be another chill hang out with some of her friends that I didn’t know. but I didn’t care, I trust her and I know she wouldn’t do anything stupid or let herself get peer pressured into anything she’s done in the past. I tell her to be safe and have fun and I go to sleep because I have church the next morning. 

the next morning, I wake up, get ready and go to church. when I walk in I see her sitting next to two guys. I didn’t recognize them, but I figured they were her cousins (she has a lot of extended family who visit all the time) or randoms. I sit down and I ask her who they are. she says they’re her friends. I try not to overthink it because I trust her and I know she probably just invited them to church to be nice or possibly introduce them to religion.

the worship concludes and I get to meet these guys. I don’t remember their names, but I’ll call them Kevin and Aaron. we shake each other‘s hands and introduce ourselves, and they seem pretty chill. they know that I’m her boyfriend and they weren’t alarmed by that which was a good sign at the time. as we walk out of the main service to go to the youth service, my girlfriend tells me that Kevin is her close friend but she doesn’t know Aaron that well. at this point, I want to ask questions but I can’t quite yet. 

we finally get up to the youth service upstairs and we all sit down. I’m getting chairs for all the people walking in and across the room, my girlfriend, Kevin and Aaron are talking and hanging out before the teaching starts. I walk over and my gf tells me about how tired she is and that she stayed up until 6am on a church night after that party. I’m shocked because that doesn’t seem like something she would do. she loves church and she takes our religion very seriously and wouldn’t stay up so late on a church night. I asked her why she stayed up so late when Kevin butts in and says that they stayed up together making steaks. now my brain starts to turn, because what does he mean hey stayed up all night together? I’ve never been the jealous type of boyfriend but him saying this really bothered me for some reason.

service starts and I can’t help but overthink what just happened. I start thinking about how we’ve set boundaries in place. and to me, it sounds like she may have broken said boundaries. but I tell myself that I’m being dramatic and try to focus on the sermon.

the sermon ends and me and my gf tried to figure out what we want to eat after church. we always get food together after church. I suggest we get Indian style pizza because she’s never tried it and it’s my favorite, when Kevin butts in yet again, and clowns on me for liking Indian pizza. It didn’t bother me that much, but I just thought that it was kind of weird for our first interaction. right after this happens, Kevin and Aaron leave.

after they leave, we decide to get regular Indian food so we leave church and say goodbye to everybody. we get out to her car and as soon as she opens the door, it smells like alcohol really bad. she apologizes in a joking way for the smell and says that her friends were drinking in her car last night. this also rubbed me the wrong way because I’m very confused as to why she would allow her underaged friends to drink in the car. especially, because as a Christian she is supposed to be setting an example for her friends and not enabling them.

once we get to the Indian food place we sit and order. our food comes and we eat. her little sister was also there and started talking about what she did the night before since my gf was gone. then it slipped out—my gf was at a sleepover. her sister realized what she said and immediately went quiet. I realized something was up, so I asked who she had the sleepover with, but she was very slow to reply. she said she slept over at Kevin’s house with Aaron too. I was very confused, so I asked about who else was there that night. she replied and said it was only them. my body recoiled and I was taken aback by this, but I wasn’t gonna talk about it in front of her little sister so I brushed it off and told myself I was going to ask her about it later. 

we finish eating, pay the bill, and say our goodbyes. I get in my car and leave because I had an order to pick up at a nearby record store. the whole drive there and back to my house consisted of me trying not to loose my mind over the fact that she slept over at another guys house and tried to hide it from me. my mind immediately started thinking of all the things that could’ve possibly happened in that house. but still, I trusted her. my emotions oscillated back and forth every 30 seconds for the next few hours—I was fully sent into an emotional spiral. hours later I finally called my youth pastor and asked him what I think I should do. we talked and my emotions started to settle, and I gained more clarity after I got done talking to him. I went to bed that night knowing I had a decision I had to make. 

the next morning I woke up and the emotional oscillation started again, so I told my parents about it. I normally avoid telling my parents about big situations because they tend to blow things out of proportion, but I told them anyways because this was a very big deal to me. they said something similar to what my youth pastor said, and again, my emotions started to settle and I gained more clarity. the rest of that day I spent at the mall and at dinner until I finally got home and sunk into my bed, processing my thoughts and making my final decision. me and my gf decided to meet up the next morning and talk.

I woke up, got ready, and left in the afternoon. I said a prayer on the way there for clarity of mind and a clean break, and that God would be with me while I did this. all my prayers were answered—except for the clean break. 

she arrived with her sister and her friend, which bothered me because I expected her to come alone, so I suggested that me and her should sit in my car and talk. they both left to go get coffee, so we went to my car and I asked her to explain her side of the story and exactly what happened that night. she was brief, but eventually told me all the details after we went back and forth a little bit. as I suspected, she didn’t fully cheat on me, and I  was very relieved. but that’s still no excuse for what she did. I told her I didn’t want to be in the relationship anymore and that I don’t think it’s good for me at the current stage i’m at (I had more reasons and went more in depth in person). she started crying and immediately pulled the victim card. she started saying things like how I was “so quick to give up” and that “this all proves that you never loved me”. she also said in a guilt-trippy tone: “I can’t change how you feel”. she left and that was the end. 

she made me feel like an asshole for breaking up with her, was I too harsh? was I being dramatic?

Chapter 1

In the fifth year of our long-distance relationship, I was thinking of getting married, but Elijah Harrington broke up with me.

""Sera, we've dragged this out long enough. Let's just end things here.""

My birthday dinner turned into an unexpected breakup.

My dad had fallen seriously ill and wanted to see Elijah one last time, but he blocked my number.

I cried and knelt as I begged him, but he remained indifferent.

""You know, seeing you cry doesn't hurt me at all. I simply find it annoying.""

After hearing that, I gave up on trying to save our relationship.

A year later, I had become a well-known jewelry designer.

As I faced the interviewer, I smiled calmly.

""I'm thankful for my ex-boyfriend, Elijah Harrington. I turned the pain he inflicted on me into inspiration.

""But I will never forgive him.""

In front of the screen, Elijah sighed and looked out of the window.

The moon was still the same, but he was no longer the boy he used to be.

\*\*\*

When he told me he wanted to break things off, I froze in place.

I couldn't bring myself to present the pair of rings I had prepared.

""Let's break up.""

Elijah repeated once more.

""Sera, we've dragged this out long enough. Let's just end things here.""

It felt as if the world had exploded into silence around me.

It took me several seconds to react.

""Why? Haven't we been doing fine?""

He turned his head to look out the window.

""That's just what you think. No sane person can handle five years of long-distance.""

I hurried to explain, ""I've already talked to my company. I'll be transferring to another branch, and we'll be closer then...""

Elijah shook his head, cutting me off.

""It's too late. I don't want this anymore.""

He was calm and cold, like a stranger.

Tears filled my eyes, but I forced them back.

Had he fallen for someone else?

Or was he truly tired of our relationship?

Just then, a waiter came out with a cake, ready to sing a birthday song.

""Go away.""

Elijah spoke sharply, his voice ice-cold.

The waiter froze, then quickly understood and backed away with the cart.

""Don't contact me ever again.""

Without sparing me a glance, Elijah turned around and walked away decisively.

I quietly stood up and took the train home.

My tears didn't stop flowing the entire ride.

I had planned to propose to him on my 26th birthday, but all I got was a breakup.

Before I even got home, a WhatsApp message popped up on my phone.

""Seraphina, did you and Elijah break up? Why did he just announce that he's dating another woman?""

I paused for a moment, then quickly checked his Instagram with shaky hands.

His most recent upload was two minutes ago.

In the photo, he stood next to a girl as they posed in front of the Ferris wheel I'd been dying to go to.

""Celebrating our first day together.""

Mutual friends were already liking and commenting on his post.

""You've finally accepted Janice's confession, huh? Congratulations, Eli. You two look great together.""

""So sweet! You two are perfect together.""

My phone kept buzzing with messages.

""Seraphina, weren't you guys celebrating your birthday earlier? Did he cheat on you?""

""No way. You two were together for five years. We were waiting for your wedding!""

""You shouldn't have been doing long-distance. Honestly, it's kind of your fault. You cared too much about work.""

I didn't reply to any of their messages, because my heart felt like it was breaking apart.

As it turned out, Elijah had fallen in love with someone else.

He wasn't tired—he found something newer, more exciting.

I collapsed on the couch and stared blankly at the photo wall in front of me.

There was a photo of us at the amusement park, with him teasing me with the cotton candy in his hand.

Another photo showed him walking along the beach at sunset, carrying me on his back.

And a photo of us in the library, where we secretly held hands under the table.

\*\*\*

All the memories surged over me like a tide, drowning me in an instant.

I remembered the night he confessed as the Pink Moon hung high in the sky.

His palms had been sweaty from nerves.

""Seraphina, this is for you.""

The round, rose-quartz pendant shimmered in the moonlight.

""People say the Pink Moon is a good omen. I think it's cheering me on.""

His eyes burned with passion.

""Seraphina, from now on, we'll celebrate our anniversary on this very night, okay?""

I nodded happily.

For five years, no matter how busy we were, we video-called every day.

When I got sick and had surgery, he took time off work just to take care of me.

When my grandmother passed away, he attended as my future husband and helped with everything.

When my dad's business struggled, he used all his savings to help my family get through it.

He treated me like a princess.

I moved to Seattle to grow my career, the city that offered the best opportunities for jewelry designers.

Meanwhile, Elijah worked at a public-sector firm back home—stable, just like he always wanted.

We both had goals to achieve, but we were fine with doing long-distance.

He'd fallen sick last month, so I rushed home in a panic.

I took an overnight train to see him, but he just smiled and waved it off.

""It's nothing serious. You didn't need to come.""

But I could see his pale face, drenched in cold sweat.

After thinking it through, I made up my mind.

I applied for a transfer. That way, I could be closer to Elijah.

I even mustered up the courage to propose to him as a surprise.

But little did I imagine...

""I don't love you anymore.

""This is too exhausting.

""Let's end things here.""

Those words kept echoing in my ears.

I curled up and buried my face in my knees, trying to ignore the cold.

All those sweet memories now left a bitter sting in my heart.

My throat was so dry it hurt to swallow.

Chapter 2

I didn't sleep at all that night.

By morning, my eyes were swollen.

All of a sudden, I received a call from my mom.

""Seraphina, your dad got into an accident and is suffering from a brain hemorrhage. Come home with Elijah.""

My hands were shaking as I stuttered in panic.

""I... I'll come back right away.""

""Remember to bring Elijah along. Your dad has something to tell him...""

My mom choked up, unable to continue.

A terrible feeling rose in my chest. Was my dad preparing his last words?

I didn't have time to explain anything. I grabbed my luggage and rushed to the train station.

On the way, I kept calling Elijah.

I called him over and over again, but he never answered.

I was so anxious that all I could do was pray silently.

Eventually, he answered.

""Elijah, my dad is in the hospital. Something's happened to him. Please come with me to visit him...""

He was silent for two seconds before speaking, his voice filled with disgust.

""Seraphina, I didn't expect you to be this heartless.""

I froze, confused.

""You'd even curse your dad just so you'd have a reason to reach out to me. Where's your conscience?""

I rushed to explain, ""No, I'm telling the truth. My mom just called...""

Elijah cut me off impatiently.

""Enough! Even if your dad is sick, I'm not a doctor. What do you need me for?

""Seraphina, if you keep this up, I'll call your parents myself and tell them we've broken up!""

""No!""

I begged him, my voice low and pleading.

""My parents think of you as their son-in-law. Now that my dad is seriously ill, he probably just wants to speak to you. Please, just see him... I'm not asking you to take responsibility.""

Elijah let out a cold laugh.

""You want me to go along with your act? To fool a dying man?

""Seraphina, I'm not doing that!""

He hung up on me immediately.

My heart sank.

What was I supposed to do?

Left with no other choice, I went to the hospital alone.

My mom panicked when she saw me walking in by myself.

""Where's Elijah? Why isn't he here?""

I lowered my head and lied because I had no other choice.

""He's on a business trip and couldn't make it back in time...""

My mom sighed helplessly.

""Forget it. Let's hope your dad can hold on for a few more days.""

I finally saw my dad, with his mouth slightly drooping and his body limp on the bed. He couldn't even move.

""Sera... Elijah... You've got to look out for each other...""

My tears fell uncontrollably, and I didn't know what to say.

That night, my dad was sent back into the ICU.

Standing outside the ICU, I held my mom up. Neither of us had any idea what would happen.

My mom held my hand, her tone earnest.

""Your dad is always worrying about you. But now that you have Elijah, he'll have no regrets as long as you two live happily.""

I lowered my eyes, unsure what to say.

I was afraid that if I spoke, it wouldn't just break my heart but theirs, too.

How could I bear to add to their pain?

After holding on for two days, my dad passed away.

My mom cried until she could barely breathe.

""Why isn't Elijah here yet? He'll be here for the funeral, right?""

My heart dropped to my stomach.

I had already lost my dad, and I couldn't let my mom worry anymore.

I gritted my teeth and called Elijah again.

No one answered.

I sent him a message on WhatsApp, but it never got delivered.

He had blocked me.

A chill ran down my spine. I could hardly believe how someone who'd been so good to me could turn into a stranger within days.

A wave of anger and resentment surged through me, and I decided to find him.

Chapter 3

When the door opened, Elijah frowned.

""What exactly do you want?""

I looked at him with teary eyes.

""Elijah, I know you don't love me anymore.

""But I just lost my dad. For the sake of what we used to have, could you please attend his funeral? My mom has been asking for you...""

Elijah froze, realizing my dad had actually died. His eyes turned slightly red.

He lowered his head briefly, then looked at me again.

""I'm sorry. Even if what you said is true, I still can't go.""

Shocked, I instinctively reached out and grabbed his arm.

""Why? After five years together, you dumped me just like that. Can't you even do me this one favor?""

""Just because we'd been together for five years?""

He let out a derisive laugh.

""Wake up, Seraphina. There's no point dwelling on that.""

He stepped forward and looked down at me.

""I've made it clear that I don't love you anymore. Why would I show up at the funeral as your boyfriend? Don't make things difficult, alright?""

""Elijah, I'm begging you. My mom can't take another blow...""

I reached out, trying to grab his sleeve.

He stepped back to avoid me, the disgust in his eyes evident.

""Seraphina, have some dignity, will you?""

Dignity? What was left of it?

My legs gave out, and I collapsed to my knees with a thud.

""Please, Elijah. I'm begging you... If not for me, then for how my parents treated you. They've been nothing but kind...""

I clutched the hem of his pants, humiliating myself like a groveling dog.

Elijah stiffened, a flicker of pain in his eyes before they turned even colder.

He slowly but firmly pulled his pant leg out of my grip.

""You know what? Seeing you cry doesn't hurt me at all. I simply find it annoying.""

I froze at his words.

Suddenly, a soft voice came from inside the room.

""Who is it, Eli?""

A girl rubbed her sleepy eyes, looking like she had just woken up.

I was stunned to see her wearing Elijah's pajamas.

""Are you two already...""

Elijah wrapped an arm around the girl and said with a smile, ""Say hi to my new girlfriend, Janice Keaton.

""She's my junior, and the department head's daughter.

""She's younger, prettier, and able to give my career a boost. Who do you think I'd prefer between the two of you?""

I shook my head in disbelief.

""No, you're not that kind of person...""

Elijah let out a cold laugh and cut me off impatiently.

""Looks like you don't know me at all.

""Any man would make the same choice.

""Seraphina, stop lying to yourself. Leave.""

He didn't spare me another glance and shut the door.

I remained kneeling on the ground, numb and lifeless.

The world around me spun in a blur, leaving me to deal with the humiliation and coldness.

Chapter 4

I came up with all kinds of excuses to calm my mom down and took care of my dad's funeral arrangements first.

""Mom, why don't you come to Seattle and stay with me? We can keep each other company.""

My mom shook her head.

""You and Elijah will be busy with your own lives, and I'd only be an inconvenience. I'll visit when you have a baby, okay?""

Hearing the hope in her voice, I covered my mouth and struggled not to cry.

My mom seemed to sense something and looked at me suspiciously.

""Sera, what's wrong? Did you and Elijah fight?""

I shook my head and wiped my tears.

""No, I'm just worried about you being alone.""

My mom pulled me into her arms, patted my shoulder, and didn't ask again.

A week later, I returned to Seattle.

But the doorway was piled with delivery boxes.

They were all from Elijah.

I recognized every single item.

On top was the gray scarf I had stayed up late knitting.

The stitches were uneven, but Elijah laughed while saying it was the warmest scarf in the world, and he'd wear it every winter.

Under it was the ceramic mug we'd bought on our first trip together.

Our initials were carved on the side, and he said he'd drink coffee from it for the rest of his life.

Now, he had returned everything that held sentimental value or precious memories we once shared.

It seemed like he was getting rid of trash.

Even after finishing an entire bottle of wine, I still couldn't get over it.

I used an alternate account to stalk Elijah's social media, hoping to find something from the past.

But he had deleted everything without a trace.

How had he moved on so quickly?

""Elijah, you bastard!""

I hugged my knees and cried over and over again.

Nicole Laufer, my best friend, called me two weeks later.

Her voice was full of worry.

""How are you, Seraphina?""

""I'm fine.""

I pretended to stay calm.

""Fine? I heard all about it. Elijah's such a jerk!""

Nicole was so angry that she started crying. After a while, she sounded hesitant.

""Seraphina, I don't know if I should tell you about...""

""What is it?""

At this point, what else could possibly hurt me?

Nicole's voice grew emotional again.

""Elijah and Janice just announced that they're getting married tomorrow.""

My heart dropped instantly.

Already?

We'd broken up less than a month ago, yet he was already getting married.

They must've been dating each other way before that.

""Seraphina? Seraphina? Are you okay?""

Nicole called my name several times before I finally snapped back to my senses.

""I'm fine.""

Nicole was furious.

""Forget about that jerk. Tomorrow, I'll introduce you to some hot guys. All of them are way better-looking than Elijah.

""How about my brother? He's great too.""

As I listened to her endless chatter, I gradually calmed down.

""Trust me, I'm fine. Right now, nothing matters except my job and my mom...""

Halfway through our conversation, another call came in.

It was my mom.

On the other end, she was crying and panicking.

""Sera, why is Elijah marrying someone else? He even sent me a wedding invitation!""

Boom!

I froze in place, feeling as though I'd been struck by lightning.

Why would Elijah do that to my mom? After all, he knew she'd just lost her husband...

I clenched my fists in anger, holding back my tears.

""It's a long story, Mom...""

My mom stayed quiet for several seconds before realizing I had admitted we'd broken up.

""No wonder he wouldn't come visit your dad, or even attend the funeral... What will you do now?""

I hurried to comfort her.

""It's okay, Mom. I'll be fine. I might meet someone better in the future...""

Suddenly, I heard something heavy fall to the ground on her end.

""Mom? Mom! Mom!""

I shouted anxiously, but there was no response.

I immediately dialed 911, then headed out to catch a taxi.

A while later, I received a message from the doctor.

""Your mother fainted and has been taken to the hospital.""

I stayed calm and kept urging the driver to go faster.

""Please be faster, Sir.""

The driver understood my situation and quickly reassured me.

""Sure thing. Don't worry, I'll get you there quickly.""

It was already late at night. As the car turned, a truck suddenly sped toward us.

Bang!

A deafening crash followed.

My vision went blank as I passed out.

By the time I woke up, I found myself in the hospital. My eyes hurt terribly.

My mom was crying beside me, her voice trembling.

""Sera... My poor daughter...""

I opened my eyes. When I caught my reflection in the glass in front of me, I froze.

My left eye was wrapped in thick gauze, and my right eye looked horrifyingly bloodshot.

""What happened to me, Mom?""

My mom held me tightly, guilt written all over her face.

""Glass shards got into your eyes. They had to remove your left eyeball...""

The news hit me like a ton of bricks, and I went completely still.

Right then, messages kept popping up on my phone.

""Seraphina, Elijah just got married.""

In the photo, Elijah had his hand around Janice's waist as they kissed.

My phone slipped from my hand, shattering as it hit the ground.

Likewise, my heart was in pieces.

Not from sadness, but from pure anger and regret.

I swore I would never forgive Elijah for what he'd done.

Two days later, I needed another surgery to fit a prosthetic eye.

I had just been wheeled into the operating room when the anesthesia kicked in, and my consciousness began to fade.

Suddenly, a burst of noise came from the hallway.

""Make way! Emergency case! Neurosurgery, get ready!""

The voices were close, pausing right outside my door.

""Hang in there, Eli...""

It felt like someone was calling Elijah's name.

I struggled to turn my head toward the sound.

A gurney rushed past with a man on it.

The person's face and jawline looked way too familiar.

Wasn't Elijah supposed to be on honeymoon with Janice? Why was he here?

It seemed impossible.

I must've hated him so much that I was hallucinating.

At that moment, the man on the gurney turned his head ever so slightly.

For a split second, it felt like I'd met his gaze.",1,1767166413.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False
1q075sp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogfree/comments/1q075sp/dog_sitting_nightmare/,Dog sitting nightmare,"My parents are watching a family members dog while they are on vacation. I am allergic to dogs and have been for my whole life. I mentioned stocking up on allergy meds and was met with laughter. As I've been sneezing all week, everyone in the household is so shocked as to why I go through a box of tissues every day. I had a fight with my mom for insisting that I keep the baby gate up so he couldn't come into my office space because I don't want him in my things and have to worry about him chewing my cords. I don't want a beady eyed creature staring at me constantly while I drink my coffee. 

The itchy face from the fur is awful, along with the permanent congestion. The anxiety of having a beast lurk and stare at you constantly when you're trying to eat or cook is brutal. I don't know how dogs enhance people's lives. It won't stop following everyone around for food. It begs constantly.  I'm working but end up watching the dog the most because he'll eat things when he's unsupervised and I am too hyper aware to ignore that. He comes and stares and cries for the other pets food  even after eating. When I think I understand the gluttony of dogs, it always continues to surprise me. 

My parents treat and fuss over the dog more than they ever did their old pets. Because he's fluffy and cute and doesn't give you a choice to interact with it.  He bites at drawers and kitchen cabinets get mad when I crate him when I cook. I cannot wait for this dog to get the hell out of the house, I feel like I'm in prison.

***The old kings watched from high towers. The new kings watch from basements, surrounded by screens that tell them they are already dead.***

***Valerius Thorne, First Imperial Archivist***

**CLASSIFIED TRANSCRIPT \[CODE: WHITE/ECHO\]**

**Source:** *The White House - Situation Room (Washington D.C.)* **Date:** *April 20, 204X* **Event:** *United Nations General Assembly - Extraordinary Session*

**\[Scene Description\]** The room is small, windowless, and smells of stale coffee and high-grade electronics. The air is recycled and kept at a shivering 68 degrees Fahrenheit. Dominating the North Wall is the ""Big Board""—a massive, encrypted display currently split into two feeds.

* **Feed A (Left):** A high-definition, live feed of the UN General Assembly Hall in New York. The hall is packed. Every seat is filled. The murmur of two thousand diplomats creates a low, oceanic roar.
* **Feed B (Right):** A mosaic of global news tickers, all silent, all screaming in red and yellow fonts: *REID ARRIVES - NYC LOCKDOWN - MARKETS HALTED - THE SURRENDER?*

**\[The Players\]** Seated around the mahogany conference table are the architects of American power:

* **President Thomas J. Whitmore (POTUS):** Sleeves rolled up, tie loosened. He looks like a man who hasn't slept in three days. He is staring at Feed A.
* **Vice President Hayes:** Taking furious notes on a legal pad.
* **General Mitchell Vance (Chairman, Joint Chiefs):** In full dress uniform, his face a mask of stone. He is the brother of the Senator who threatened Reid, and he looks ready to finish the argument with a carrier strike group.
* **Director Cohen (CIA):** Slumped in his chair, tapping a stylus against his teeth.
* **Director Miller (FBI):** whispering into a secure phone.
* **Ron Klain (Chief of Staff):** Pacing behind the President.
* **Admiral Blackwood**: CNO

And in the corner, seated on a folding chair against the wall, is **Captain James Miller (USN)**, Aide-de-Camp to Admiral Blackwood. He has a laptop on his knees. He is invisible to the men at the table. He is watching.

**\[Transcript Starts - 09:55 AM EST\]**

**Chief of Staff Klain:** ""Five minutes. He's in the building. Secret Service confirms he passed the magnetometer. No weapons. Just a datapad.""

**POTUS:** ""Is the perimeter secure?""

**Director Miller (FBI):** ""We have snipers on every roof from 42nd Street to the East River. NYPD has the blocks locked down. But Mr. President... the crowds. There are two million people out there. They aren't protesting against him anymore. They're cheering. They're chanting his name.""

**POTUS:** ""They're cheering for a terrorist?""

**Director Cohen (CIA):** ""They're cheering for access to space, sir. The narrative shifted. Our psyops campaign failed. The moment he released that 'Surrender' letter, he became a martyr. If we arrest him today, we create a saint. If we kill him... we create a god.""

**General Vance:** ""He's not a god. He's a man. And he's walking into a trap. We have the warrant ready. The moment he steps off that podium, U.S. Marshals take him into custody. Material Witness. Terrorist Act. We hold him at Gitmo until he gives up the encryption keys to the Tether.""

**VP Hayes:** ""And the Chinese? Liu endorsed the embargo, but his fleet is still parked in the Malacca Strait.""

**Director Cohen:** ""Liu is hedging. If Reid falls today, China joins the sucess. If Reid wins... well, Liu will say he was 'protecting stability'. The Chinese play the long game. We are playing poker.""

**POTUS:** ""Quiet. He's entering the hall.""

\[On Screen A, the murmur in the UN Assembly dies instantly. The doors at the back open. Georges Reid enters. He is not wearing the grey flight suit of SLAM. He is wearing a simple, dark suit. He walks down the aisle alone. No bodyguards. No entourage. He looks small against the cavernous architecture of the hall. He walks to the podium, places his datapad on the lectern, and looks up at the gathered representatives of Earth.\]

**General Vance:** ""Look at him. Arrogant son of a bitch. He thinks he owns the room.""

**POTUS:** ""Turn up the audio. I want to hear his confession.""

**\[The audio from the UN feed fills the Situation Room. Reid taps the microphone. It booms.\]**

**Reid (On Screen):** ""Mr. Secretary-General. Distinguished Delegates. I was summoned to answer for my crimes. Here I am.""

**Reid:** ""I wanted to read you my letter of surrender, but strangely enough I received another one, from a totally unexpected source: **Aditya Rao** — **Hyderabad**, **Telangana, India**. A high school student.""

\[A ripple of confusion moves through the General Assembly. The delegates exchange glances. Is this a joke? Is he stalling?\]

**Reid:** (Smiling slightly, looking down at his datapad) ""He writes: 'Dear Mr Reid, despite all the admiration I have for you, your space elevator is a hoax.""

\[In the Situation Room, Director Cohen snorts.\]

**Director Cohen:** ""He's reading fan mail? Is he insane?""

**Reid:** ""You see we were totally transparent with you: a 100 tons container sent every minute to geosync orbit. And obviously one down on the descending line. Not a whisper, not a single paper, not even a classified report on what is honestly a total impossibility.""

\[The confusion in the hall deepens. The murmurs grow louder. The Chinese Ambassador is leaning forward, his translation earpiece pressed to his ear. The American Ambassador looks like he is about to shout an objection.\]

\[Suddenly, movement in the third row. A man stands up. It is Dr. Kweku Mensah, the representative from Ghana, a Nobel Laureate in Physics. He is shaking. His face is drained of blood.\]

**Dr. Mensah:** (Shouting without a microphone, his voice cracking with terror) ""YOU DID NOT DARE!""

\[The hall freezes. Mensah points a trembling finger at Reid.\]

**Reid:** ""Please, Professor Mensah. Give me five minutes.""

\[Reid turns back to the assembly. His smile is gone. He looks tired, almost apologetic.\]

**Reid:** ""You see, my friends, to fulfill our promise of fast logistics, we needed energy. A lot of energy. To lift a 100-ton container to Geostationary Orbit against Earth's gravity at that acceleration in one hour requires approximately 20 Gigawatts of power. Continuous. Per container.""

**\[He taps the lectern.\]**

**Reid:** ""We have one hundred and twenty containers moving up and down the line at any given second. Plus the station keeping. Yes, my friends. Simple high school physics.""

\[The murmuring in the hall explodes into a roar. Diplomats are frantically typing on their tablets, calling their science advisors. On the screen in the Situation Room, the chaos is palpable.\]

**Reid:** (Waiting, the smile returning, colder now) ""Do the math.""

\[In the Situation Room, the silence is heavy. Admiral Blackwood spins his chair around, his face pale.\]

**Admiral Blackwood:** ""Captain Miller. You're the MIT graduate. Run the numbers. Is he bluffing?""

\[Captain Miller is already typing. His fingers blur on the keyboard. He hits enter. He stares at the result.\]

**Captain Miller:** ""Sir... he's right. It's a conservative estimate. To operate the elevator at the advertised capacity... he needs 2.5 Terawatts.""

**General Vance:** ""2.5 Terawatts? That's impossible. That's... that's 15% of the total power consumption of the human species.""

\[In a large technical room in the basement of the UN building, a light suddenly flickers in the dark—red, then orange, then green. It emanates from the new “Air Handling Unit” delivered just the previous week, following the catastrophic failure of the original system. Through an invisible conduit, a deluge of energy surges upward, coursing through the building's infrastructure, infiltrating the fibers of the brand-new carpet in the General Assembly Hall, and culminating in a hidden loop directly beneath the speaker's podium.\]

Reid smiles slowly. He feels the enormous magnetic field surging through the loop, resonating within the new metal lattice of his bones. It is a hum only he can hear, a vibration of pure power.

He taps on the microphone again, not like a defendant, but like a teacher calling an unruly classroom to order. ""Please, please, look here.""

The room quiets slowly, sensing the shift in the air.

""I want to introduce you to the future,"" Reid says softly.

Suddenly, the air behind him shimmers. An enormous hologram materializes, filling the cavernous space above the podium. It is a grainy, charmingly imperfect video.

It shows a school exhibition. A small girl with messy hair is talking to a woman wearing a Kestrel logo badge. Behind them stands a nondescript green metal box, roughly the size of a standard shipping container. The girl is pointing at a golden symbol on the casing.

Reid gestures to the frozen image. And suddenly to the astonishment of the audience, he rises in the air, at the level of the green container.

""This,"" he says, his voice echoing in the silence, ""is a Helios Node. It is a self-sustaining fusion reactor. It produces a lot of Terawatts of clean, carbon-free energy. Indefinitely.""

\[The assembly gasps. In the Situation Room, General Vance drops his pen.\]

**Reid:** ""We installed this one in a science museum in Luxembourg six months ago. We disguised it as a science exhibit. It has been powering the entire Benelux grid since January. And nobody noticed.""

\[Reid hovers effortlessly, looking down at the delegates. The tension in the room is breaking, replaced by a strange, collective curiosity. Shoulders relax. People lean back in their chairs. The impending doom of the embargo and the trial feels distant now. This isn't a tribunal anymore; it's a show. A magic show. And for the first time in months, the audience is actually enjoying it.\]

**Reid:** ""And now it is...""

\[Reid raises his hand to snap his fingers for dramatic effect. He presses his thumb against his middle finger. His fingers slide silently. He fails. A few people in the audience chuckle. He tries again, frowning slightly. Another silent slide. He finally succeeds on the third try—a sharp, clear snap—and the whole room erupts in applause, delighted by the humanizing error.\]

In the Situation Room, President Whitmore stares at the screen, his face draining of color as he watches the world's diplomats clapping for the man he intended to arrest.

**POTUS:** ""It’s turning into a circus. Why was I not forewarned? You bloody incompetents.""

On the giant screen a map of Europe appears with the major electricity main lines. Benelux is green, the rest red. And then the green advances, covering the Ruhr, the industrial region of Germany, northern France, going down on the east to Switzerland, and then stopping.

**Reid**, apologetic: For the rest of Europe, we shall need some coordination with EDF, the french nuclear energy supplier.

Then Reid turns toward the Chinese ambassador. The screen is now showing Asia. A green point, Singapore, and suddenly green lines shooting toward all neighbourhood countries. In the sea, a single green line starts from Singapore, cross the south china sea, and ends up in Shanghai, and suddenly the region of Shanghai and Shenzhen turn green.

“Your excellency, the quantum communication experimental line, that you agreed to connect too, can be used for other, more mundane applications.”

The screen centers now to Mali, where suddenly a big green dot starts blinking.

“If our African friends agree, we can link you to that generator in a matter of weeks or months.”

“For India? Give us the ‘green’ light (laughters in the room)”.

Reid rises a little more in the air.

“You have, the where, everywhere, the when, now, what is left is how much.”

“It will be free, decarbonated, unlimited energy for all! We now have a real chance against global warning, and even more importantly, poverty.”

“Who will vote for the independence of space, the independence of energy, the independence for all?”

**“SLAM, for mankind on Earth. And Beyond”**

[Logo](https://i.ibb.co/MyYTbnKq/SLAM-LOGO.png)

The silence in the Situation Room was heavy, broken only by the low, steady hum of high-end electronics.

On the main wall, Feed A broadcasted live from the UN Hall. The image was chaotic, jubilant. Delegates had abandoned protocol and were standing on their chairs. They weren’t just clapping; they were reaching out towards Reid, who remained suspended ten inches above the floor, moving slowly through the crowd. He smiled benevolently, looking less like a CEO and more like a prophet who had just parted the sea.

Beside him, the vote count on the massive display ticked up rapidly, freezing on the final tally for **Resolution 2443: Recognition of S.L.A.M. Sovereignty & Energy Partnership**.

* **YES:** 189
* **NO:** 1 (United States)
* **ABSTAIN:** 3 (Israel, UK, Poland)

To the right, on Feed B, the mood was apocalyptic. The mosaic of news tickers had transformed into a cascading red waterfall of panic.

* **CNBC:** ENERGY SECTOR BLOODBATH. EXXON, SHELL, ARAMCO TRADING HALTED AFTER 90% DROP.
* **AL JAZEERA:** REVOLUTION IN THE GULF. MIGRANT WORKERS SEIZE OIL FIELDS IN SAUDI ARABIA AND QATAR. 'WE ARE FREE'.
* **BBC:** LONDON RIOTS. CITIZENS DEMAND 'THE REID LINK'. GOVERNMENT UNDER SIEGE.
* **REUTERS:** CHINA ANNOUNCES 'STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP' WITH SLAM. US NAVY ORDERED OUT OF MALACCA STRAIT.

President Whitmore stared at the two screens. The cheering on the left. The burning world on the right. He felt the gravity of the moment crushing him, and he slowly sank into his leather chair.

""Turn it off,"" he said, his voice barely rising above the hum of the servers.

General Vance turned, his brow furrowed. ""Sir?""

""Turn it all off.""

Screen A went black. Screen B followed an instant later. The room plunged into sudden darkness, illuminated only by the ghostly green glow of the emergency exit sign.

The darkness seemed to suck the oxygen out of the room. For a long moment, no one breathed.

""Execute the contingencies,"" Whitmore said. His voice was no longer a whisper; it was cold iron.

General Vance hesitated in the gloom. ""Sir?""

""The Elevator,"" Whitmore clarified, standing up and smoothing his suit jacket. ""We prepared for this scenario. Initiate the seizure protocol. Combined sea, air, and commando teams. We aren't destroying the base station, General. We're taking it.""

""Mr. President,"" Vance cautioned, the light from his tablet illuminating his sweat-slicked face. ""That is an act of war against a sovereign entity recognized by 189 nations. The fallout—""

""Is preferable to the alternative,"" Whitmore cut him off. ""They want to play gods? Fine. But they'll pay rent to the United States. Secure the asset. Do it.""

Whitmore didn't wait for an acknowledgment. He strode toward the exit, the Secret Service detail swarming around him like moths. Vance cast one last look at the blank screens, then tapped his headset and followed, barking confirmation codes into his mic.

The heavy door hissed shut, sealing the room.

The silence returned, heavier than before.

Miller remained leaning against the tactical table, his arms crossed, his face unreadable in the shadows. Across the room, Admiral Halloway stood rigid, staring at the empty space where the President had been.

""He actually did it,"" Blackwood whispered, the words sounding too loud in the empty room. He turned to Miller. ""What is your take?""

Miller finally looked up, his eyes catching the green light. ""When it smells like a trap and looks like a trap...""

""A trap?"" Blackwood asked. ""What can we do?""

""Reid has never killed anybody,"" Miller replied, his voice low but steady. ""Even those mobsters. He doesn't want to kill. We do. So let us spring the trap, Sir.""

Blackwood smiled, a cold expression in the dim light, as he turned to leave the room. ""Let's take a spider in his lair.""

Miller stood finally alone in the room, looking at the dark screens.

""Long live the Empire,"" he whispered into the silence. ""Long live the Emperor.""

Outside of work, I'm into hiking, trying new restaurants, coffee shops, running. Being a new dad now takes up a lot of my time though. 

**Why I'm reaching out:** I've always admired the Ismaili community - the emphasis on education, entrepreneurship, and giving back really resonates with me. The Bohra and Ismaili communities actually share a lot of history (we're both Shia, both value tight-knit community, both have that ""business-minded"" culture), and I think there's a lot we can learn from each other.

I'd love to grab coffee, explore the city, or just have conversations about community, faith, or life in Vancouver. Always appreciate connecting with people who understand the diaspora Muslim experience, even if we come from different traditions.

If you're open to meeting someone from a ""cousin community"" or know of any interfaith/community events happening in Vancouver, I'd love to hear from you!",3,1767166273.0,ismailis,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1

In the fifth year of our long-distance relationship, I was thinking of getting married, but Elijah Harrington broke up with me.

""Sera, we've dragged this out long enough. Let's just end things here.""

My birthday dinner turned into an unexpected breakup.

My dad had fallen seriously ill and wanted to see Elijah one last time, but he blocked my number.

I cried and knelt as I begged him, but he remained indifferent.

""You know, seeing you cry doesn't hurt me at all. I simply find it annoying.""

After hearing that, I gave up on trying to save our relationship.

A year later, I had become a well-known jewelry designer.

As I faced the interviewer, I smiled calmly.

""I'm thankful for my ex-boyfriend, Elijah Harrington. I turned the pain he inflicted on me into inspiration.

""But I will never forgive him.""

In front of the screen, Elijah sighed and looked out of the window.

The moon was still the same, but he was no longer the boy he used to be.

\*\*\*

When he told me he wanted to break things off, I froze in place.

I couldn't bring myself to present the pair of rings I had prepared.

""Let's break up.""

Elijah repeated once more.

""Sera, we've dragged this out long enough. Let's just end things here.""

It felt as if the world had exploded into silence around me.

It took me several seconds to react.

""Why? Haven't we been doing fine?""

He turned his head to look out the window.

""That's just what you think. No sane person can handle five years of long-distance.""

I hurried to explain, ""I've already talked to my company. I'll be transferring to another branch, and we'll be closer then...""

Elijah shook his head, cutting me off.

""It's too late. I don't want this anymore.""

He was calm and cold, like a stranger.

Tears filled my eyes, but I forced them back.

Had he fallen for someone else?

Or was he truly tired of our relationship?

Just then, a waiter came out with a cake, ready to sing a birthday song.

""Go away.""

Elijah spoke sharply, his voice ice-cold.

The waiter froze, then quickly understood and backed away with the cart.

""Don't contact me ever again.""

Without sparing me a glance, Elijah turned around and walked away decisively.

I quietly stood up and took the train home.

My tears didn't stop flowing the entire ride.

I had planned to propose to him on my 26th birthday, but all I got was a breakup.

Before I even got home, a WhatsApp message popped up on my phone.

""Seraphina, did you and Elijah break up? Why did he just announce that he's dating another woman?""

I paused for a moment, then quickly checked his Instagram with shaky hands.

His most recent upload was two minutes ago.

In the photo, he stood next to a girl as they posed in front of the Ferris wheel I'd been dying to go to.

""Celebrating our first day together.""

Mutual friends were already liking and commenting on his post.

""You've finally accepted Janice's confession, huh? Congratulations, Eli. You two look great together.""

""So sweet! You two are perfect together.""

My phone kept buzzing with messages.

""Seraphina, weren't you guys celebrating your birthday earlier? Did he cheat on you?""

""No way. You two were together for five years. We were waiting for your wedding!""

""You shouldn't have been doing long-distance. Honestly, it's kind of your fault. You cared too much about work.""

I didn't reply to any of their messages, because my heart felt like it was breaking apart.

As it turned out, Elijah had fallen in love with someone else.

He wasn't tired—he found something newer, more exciting.

I collapsed on the couch and stared blankly at the photo wall in front of me.

There was a photo of us at the amusement park, with him teasing me with the cotton candy in his hand.

Another photo showed him walking along the beach at sunset, carrying me on his back.

And a photo of us in the library, where we secretly held hands under the table.

\*\*\*

All the memories surged over me like a tide, drowning me in an instant.

I remembered the night he confessed as the Pink Moon hung high in the sky.

His palms had been sweaty from nerves.

""Seraphina, this is for you.""

The round, rose-quartz pendant shimmered in the moonlight.

""People say the Pink Moon is a good omen. I think it's cheering me on.""

His eyes burned with passion.

""Seraphina, from now on, we'll celebrate our anniversary on this very night, okay?""

I nodded happily.

For five years, no matter how busy we were, we video-called every day.

When I got sick and had surgery, he took time off work just to take care of me.

When my grandmother passed away, he attended as my future husband and helped with everything.

When my dad's business struggled, he used all his savings to help my family get through it.

He treated me like a princess.

I moved to Seattle to grow my career, the city that offered the best opportunities for jewelry designers.

Meanwhile, Elijah worked at a public-sector firm back home—stable, just like he always wanted.

We both had goals to achieve, but we were fine with doing long-distance.

He'd fallen sick last month, so I rushed home in a panic.

I took an overnight train to see him, but he just smiled and waved it off.

""It's nothing serious. You didn't need to come.""

But I could see his pale face, drenched in cold sweat.

After thinking it through, I made up my mind.

I applied for a transfer. That way, I could be closer to Elijah.

I even mustered up the courage to propose to him as a surprise.

But little did I imagine...

""I don't love you anymore.

""This is too exhausting.

""Let's end things here.""

Those words kept echoing in my ears.

I curled up and buried my face in my knees, trying to ignore the cold.

All those sweet memories now left a bitter sting in my heart.

My throat was so dry it hurt to swallow.

Chapter 2

I didn't sleep at all that night.

By morning, my eyes were swollen.

All of a sudden, I received a call from my mom.

""Seraphina, your dad got into an accident and is suffering from a brain hemorrhage. Come home with Elijah.""

My hands were shaking as I stuttered in panic.

""I... I'll come back right away.""

""Remember to bring Elijah along. Your dad has something to tell him...""

My mom choked up, unable to continue.

A terrible feeling rose in my chest. Was my dad preparing his last words?

I didn't have time to explain anything. I grabbed my luggage and rushed to the train station.

On the way, I kept calling Elijah.

I called him over and over again, but he never answered.

I was so anxious that all I could do was pray silently.

Eventually, he answered.

""Elijah, my dad is in the hospital. Something's happened to him. Please come with me to visit him...""

He was silent for two seconds before speaking, his voice filled with disgust.

""Seraphina, I didn't expect you to be this heartless.""

I froze, confused.

""You'd even curse your dad just so you'd have a reason to reach out to me. Where's your conscience?""

I rushed to explain, ""No, I'm telling the truth. My mom just called...""

Elijah cut me off impatiently.

""Enough! Even if your dad is sick, I'm not a doctor. What do you need me for?

""Seraphina, if you keep this up, I'll call your parents myself and tell them we've broken up!""

""No!""

I begged him, my voice low and pleading.

""My parents think of you as their son-in-law. Now that my dad is seriously ill, he probably just wants to speak to you. Please, just see him... I'm not asking you to take responsibility.""

Elijah let out a cold laugh.

""You want me to go along with your act? To fool a dying man?

""Seraphina, I'm not doing that!""

He hung up on me immediately.

My heart sank.

What was I supposed to do?

Left with no other choice, I went to the hospital alone.

My mom panicked when she saw me walking in by myself.

""Where's Elijah? Why isn't he here?""

I lowered my head and lied because I had no other choice.

""He's on a business trip and couldn't make it back in time...""

My mom sighed helplessly.

""Forget it. Let's hope your dad can hold on for a few more days.""

I finally saw my dad, with his mouth slightly drooping and his body limp on the bed. He couldn't even move.

""Sera... Elijah... You've got to look out for each other...""

My tears fell uncontrollably, and I didn't know what to say.

That night, my dad was sent back into the ICU.

Standing outside the ICU, I held my mom up. Neither of us had any idea what would happen.

My mom held my hand, her tone earnest.

""Your dad is always worrying about you. But now that you have Elijah, he'll have no regrets as long as you two live happily.""

I lowered my eyes, unsure what to say.

I was afraid that if I spoke, it wouldn't just break my heart but theirs, too.

How could I bear to add to their pain?

After holding on for two days, my dad passed away.

My mom cried until she could barely breathe.

""Why isn't Elijah here yet? He'll be here for the funeral, right?""

My heart dropped to my stomach.

I had already lost my dad, and I couldn't let my mom worry anymore.

I gritted my teeth and called Elijah again.

No one answered.

I sent him a message on WhatsApp, but it never got delivered.

He had blocked me.

A chill ran down my spine. I could hardly believe how someone who'd been so good to me could turn into a stranger within days.

A wave of anger and resentment surged through me, and I decided to find him.

Chapter 3

When the door opened, Elijah frowned.

""What exactly do you want?""

I looked at him with teary eyes.

""Elijah, I know you don't love me anymore.

""But I just lost my dad. For the sake of what we used to have, could you please attend his funeral? My mom has been asking for you...""

Elijah froze, realizing my dad had actually died. His eyes turned slightly red.

He lowered his head briefly, then looked at me again.

""I'm sorry. Even if what you said is true, I still can't go.""

Shocked, I instinctively reached out and grabbed his arm.

""Why? After five years together, you dumped me just like that. Can't you even do me this one favor?""

""Just because we'd been together for five years?""

He let out a derisive laugh.

""Wake up, Seraphina. There's no point dwelling on that.""

He stepped forward and looked down at me.

""I've made it clear that I don't love you anymore. Why would I show up at the funeral as your boyfriend? Don't make things difficult, alright?""

""Elijah, I'm begging you. My mom can't take another blow...""

I reached out, trying to grab his sleeve.

He stepped back to avoid me, the disgust in his eyes evident.

""Seraphina, have some dignity, will you?""

Dignity? What was left of it?

My legs gave out, and I collapsed to my knees with a thud.

""Please, Elijah. I'm begging you... If not for me, then for how my parents treated you. They've been nothing but kind...""

I clutched the hem of his pants, humiliating myself like a groveling dog.

Elijah stiffened, a flicker of pain in his eyes before they turned even colder.

He slowly but firmly pulled his pant leg out of my grip.

""You know what? Seeing you cry doesn't hurt me at all. I simply find it annoying.""

I froze at his words.

Suddenly, a soft voice came from inside the room.

""Who is it, Eli?""

A girl rubbed her sleepy eyes, looking like she had just woken up.

I was stunned to see her wearing Elijah's pajamas.

""Are you two already...""

Elijah wrapped an arm around the girl and said with a smile, ""Say hi to my new girlfriend, Janice Keaton.

""She's my junior, and the department head's daughter.

""She's younger, prettier, and able to give my career a boost. Who do you think I'd prefer between the two of you?""

I shook my head in disbelief.

""No, you're not that kind of person...""

Elijah let out a cold laugh and cut me off impatiently.

""Looks like you don't know me at all.

""Any man would make the same choice.

""Seraphina, stop lying to yourself. Leave.""

He didn't spare me another glance and shut the door.

I remained kneeling on the ground, numb and lifeless.

The world around me spun in a blur, leaving me to deal with the humiliation and coldness.

Chapter 4

I came up with all kinds of excuses to calm my mom down and took care of my dad's funeral arrangements first.

""Mom, why don't you come to Seattle and stay with me? We can keep each other company.""

My mom shook her head.

""You and Elijah will be busy with your own lives, and I'd only be an inconvenience. I'll visit when you have a baby, okay?""

Hearing the hope in her voice, I covered my mouth and struggled not to cry.

My mom seemed to sense something and looked at me suspiciously.

""Sera, what's wrong? Did you and Elijah fight?""

I shook my head and wiped my tears.

""No, I'm just worried about you being alone.""

My mom pulled me into her arms, patted my shoulder, and didn't ask again.

A week later, I returned to Seattle.

But the doorway was piled with delivery boxes.

They were all from Elijah.

I recognized every single item.

On top was the gray scarf I had stayed up late knitting.

The stitches were uneven, but Elijah laughed while saying it was the warmest scarf in the world, and he'd wear it every winter.

Under it was the ceramic mug we'd bought on our first trip together.

Our initials were carved on the side, and he said he'd drink coffee from it for the rest of his life.

Now, he had returned everything that held sentimental value or precious memories we once shared.

It seemed like he was getting rid of trash.

Even after finishing an entire bottle of wine, I still couldn't get over it.

I used an alternate account to stalk Elijah's social media, hoping to find something from the past.

But he had deleted everything without a trace.

How had he moved on so quickly?

""Elijah, you bastard!""

I hugged my knees and cried over and over again.

Nicole Laufer, my best friend, called me two weeks later.

Her voice was full of worry.

""How are you, Seraphina?""

""I'm fine.""

I pretended to stay calm.

""Fine? I heard all about it. Elijah's such a jerk!""

Nicole was so angry that she started crying. After a while, she sounded hesitant.

""Seraphina, I don't know if I should tell you about...""

""What is it?""

At this point, what else could possibly hurt me?

Nicole's voice grew emotional again.

""Elijah and Janice just announced that they're getting married tomorrow.""

My heart dropped instantly.

Already?

We'd broken up less than a month ago, yet he was already getting married.

They must've been dating each other way before that.

""Seraphina? Seraphina? Are you okay?""

Nicole called my name several times before I finally snapped back to my senses.

""I'm fine.""

Nicole was furious.

""Forget about that jerk. Tomorrow, I'll introduce you to some hot guys. All of them are way better-looking than Elijah.

""How about my brother? He's great too.""

As I listened to her endless chatter, I gradually calmed down.

""Trust me, I'm fine. Right now, nothing matters except my job and my mom...""

Halfway through our conversation, another call came in.

It was my mom.

On the other end, she was crying and panicking.

""Sera, why is Elijah marrying someone else? He even sent me a wedding invitation!""

Boom!

I froze in place, feeling as though I'd been struck by lightning.

Why would Elijah do that to my mom? After all, he knew she'd just lost her husband...

I clenched my fists in anger, holding back my tears.

""It's a long story, Mom...""

My mom stayed quiet for several seconds before realizing I had admitted we'd broken up.

""No wonder he wouldn't come visit your dad, or even attend the funeral... What will you do now?""

I hurried to comfort her.

""It's okay, Mom. I'll be fine. I might meet someone better in the future...""

Suddenly, I heard something heavy fall to the ground on her end.

""Mom? Mom! Mom!""

I shouted anxiously, but there was no response.

I immediately dialed 911, then headed out to catch a taxi.

A while later, I received a message from the doctor.

""Your mother fainted and has been taken to the hospital.""

I stayed calm and kept urging the driver to go faster.

""Please be faster, Sir.""

The driver understood my situation and quickly reassured me.

""Sure thing. Don't worry, I'll get you there quickly.""

It was already late at night. As the car turned, a truck suddenly sped toward us.

Bang!

A deafening crash followed.

My vision went blank as I passed out.

By the time I woke up, I found myself in the hospital. My eyes hurt terribly.

My mom was crying beside me, her voice trembling.

""Sera... My poor daughter...""

I opened my eyes. When I caught my reflection in the glass in front of me, I froze.

My left eye was wrapped in thick gauze, and my right eye looked horrifyingly bloodshot.

""What happened to me, Mom?""

My mom held me tightly, guilt written all over her face.

""Glass shards got into your eyes. They had to remove your left eyeball...""

The news hit me like a ton of bricks, and I went completely still.

Right then, messages kept popping up on my phone.

""Seraphina, Elijah just got married.""

In the photo, Elijah had his hand around Janice's waist as they kissed.

My phone slipped from my hand, shattering as it hit the ground.

Likewise, my heart was in pieces.

Not from sadness, but from pure anger and regret.

I swore I would never forgive Elijah for what he'd done.

Two days later, I needed another surgery to fit a prosthetic eye.

I had just been wheeled into the operating room when the anesthesia kicked in, and my consciousness began to fade.

Suddenly, a burst of noise came from the hallway.

""Make way! Emergency case! Neurosurgery, get ready!""

The voices were close, pausing right outside my door.

""Hang in there, Eli...""

It felt like someone was calling Elijah's name.

I struggled to turn my head toward the sound.

A gurney rushed past with a man on it.

The person's face and jawline looked way too familiar.

Wasn't Elijah supposed to be on honeymoon with Janice? Why was he here?

It seemed impossible.

I must've hated him so much that I was hallucinating.

At that moment, the man on the gurney turned his head ever so slightly.

I (38m) went on a first coffee date with someone (39f) and pretty early on in the date they started to tell me about some very serious hardships and traumas that they have had in their life. It was a story of one hard thing after another. I was taken a bit aback but tried to do what I thought best at the time and listened deeply, held space and offered validation, without offering too too much. I felt deep compassion for this other soul and also genuine awe that they have accomplished so much in spite of major hardships (death of both parents, death of friends, addiction, suicidal ideation, divorce, chronic illness - a long list.) 

At the end of the date, maybe 2hrs, they made reference to suggestions that we should meet again, and be friends, (they live in my neighbourhood), I was in a state of I suppose now mild shock from all I had heard, and sort of instinctually, albeit lightly agreed to the possibility of a future meeting.

I don’t have the capacity or desire to be friends with this new person. I do genuinely feel that ‘I see them’, and gI feel strong empathy for this person. It feels very delicate.

Drink a lot of water like one litre.

I know women have a certain style where they can push from the inner walls of the vagina to pull the shit out.

So for men i reccomend putting your finger in your ass style and im not recommending gay sex here. Im reccomending just lightly pulling on the walls of your anal hole in a certain direction while trying to push.

While it shares similar traits with anal i reccomend it for anyone constipated and have no other way to go.

Do all this in one hour. For me eating the prunes takes 45 mins as it also needs to digest. Drink 1 litre in 15 minutes. Lastly the shit takes ONLY 5 mins. After this drink two servings of coffee and boom a little bit of diarrhoea but it works.

Eating food after that may make u shit too depending on what.

Also check how many grams of prunes or apircots you need depending on how many calories you eat. I eat 1750 calories so i eat around 150g of prunes a day.

Lastly theres a timing for it. If you eat at a lot at 12 noon and lets say a little bit at 6 pm, take the prunes the next day 12 noon and continue the process.

It started when I posted a birthday story and he replied wishing me happy birthday and asking how I was celebrating. He also shared details about his birthday and said things like celebrating with friends is nice.

The next day he asked how my birthday went, which I found a little unexpected since we don’t really know each other and even some of my close friends didn’t ask how it went. Most people usually leave it at wishing.

Then on Christmas I posted a simple “Merry Christmas” note, and he replied “Merry Christmas :)” and immediately added: “Should def hang out and do something quick like go for a coffee when we get back to school.”

I said yeah sure, just let me know when.

Later, he guessed where I was from and when I asked how he knew, he replied: “May or may not have looked at your bio 😳🫢”

One more thing: he’s graduating this year (so he’s older) and I’m a first-year. He has completed his masters in education.

1q06qrq,https://i.redd.it/m5ahutk9ohag1.jpeg,"How Budh Affects Learning, Speech, and Mental Balance?","Budh is the planet of intelligence, learning, and communication. Though it is the smallest planet, its influence on the human mind is very powerful. Mercury can be seen shining in the morning and evening sky, and sometimes even during the day. Budh governs speech, memory, humour, logic, calculation, self-confidence, astrology, mathematics, and short travels. It rules education and professions connected with thinking and communication, such as writers, teachers, artists, traders, businesspeople, and speakers. In the body, Mercury controls the hands, skin, tongue, nervous system, lungs, and intestines. The ability to learn quickly, speak clearly, make friends easily, multitask, and handle business wisely comes from a strong Mercury.

Mercury rules the zodiac signs Gemini and Virgo. In Virgo, Mercury feels strongest and gives sharp intelligence, while in Pisces it becomes weak and confused. Budh has a dual and flexible nature and is called a neutral planet because it reflects the company it keeps. When Mercury is well placed in the horoscope, the mind becomes alert, speech becomes sweet, and learning feels easy. Such people do well in teaching, business, media, writing, arts, and communication fields. When Mercury is weak, it can create anxiety, overthinking, poor memory, confusion in speech, or immature behaviour, showing imbalance in the nervous system and mind.

Mercury can be strengthened through simple daily habits. Since Budh rules the hands and nerves, gentle hand and arm massage with light oils like neem, olive, or Brahmi oil helps calm the mind. Writing, typing, drawing, playing music, or practising mudras like Gyan, Prana, and Vayu Mudra keep Mercury active and balanced. Keeping the skin clean and cool, eating fresh green and sattvic foods, and avoiding alcohol, smoking, excess tea or coffee, and heavy oily food support Budh’s nature. Speaking politely, avoiding harsh words, and chanting “Om Budhaya Namaha” also strengthen Mercury. When Budh is balanced, the mind becomes clear, learning becomes joyful, communication improves, and life flows with intelligence and ease.

1q06q1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/1q06q1a/i_folded_and_went_to_a_brothel_because_of_how/,I folded and went to a brothel because of how lonely I am,"I've (25M) been trying to think of what to say for this post for some days now. To get right to the point, I was visiting a friend in Syndey Australia (where prostitution is legal btw) with my friend group and I ended up having sex with 4 different girls at a brothel within the span of 3 days. I'll spare the details about the sex and focus this post more on what I'm feeling now a few days after all of it. Though I will say, the girls were absolutely gorgeous and I have zero regrets of doing this.

Growing up I've always been the odd one out, the loser, the guy that everyone bullied just for the hell of it because I was an easy target. All the girls in school that I had asked out would always point and laugh at me in hallways and cause drama and such. I was a virgin up until 5 days ago and even as an adult I got bullied because of being a virgin. I hung out with the wrong crowd and it made me question my self worth quite often. Everyone else was getting involved in hookup culture, Tinder, etc and I was the only one that wasn't. Made me feel terrible. At this time I had no money to my name so it seriously made me question my worth. There's probably a lot of details I'm missing about my childhood that resulted in me doing what I did but the summary is that it was shit and it felt like the world was attacking me for no reason all the time. Also had undiagnosed bipolar 1 disorder too.

Most recently a girl that I had liked for a long time but never managed to make a move on up until earlier this year got married. I had asked her out to a coffee date and was so excited about it that I told all of my friends and everything. Then out of nowhere I get ghosted and she posts her new man on IG followed by her engagement with that guy. More details about that in the previous posts. I asked her out to coffee in January of this year and the engagement happened around a few months ago or so, not really sure on timelines.

Fast forward to now, I was jokingly telling my friends that I'm going to spend big at the brothels. I don't even know how this thought came into my mind. I didn't even realize brothels were legal in Australia until I spent literal hours on the first day of the trip researching if it's legal and if there's anything that would happen to me on the way back to the US. My justification for wanting to do this is that everyone has to pay for relationships / sex in some way whether it's with time or money on dates and whatever. The first time I tried going to the brothel I wimped out. It was insanely terrifying and I had many racing thoughts going through my head when the ladies were introducing themselves. Thought that it was all a setup or something. Then I came back with a bit more confidence the next morning and actually did it. The last time I did it I got very emotional and was bawling my eyes out on the walk back to the hotel and at the hotel itself. Had a deep convo about life and love with the last girl I did it with and she was also getting emotional too. The part that really hit me like a truck was when we hugged at the end and she told me that I was a good guy with a good heart. People always tell me that but I refuse to believe it myself because of how broken I am on the inside.

I live a sad life. As I'm writing this I feel very numb. No girl has ever wanted to romantically be with me in my life. There was only one girl that gave me a chance and all we did was make out but she ended up hating me in the end anyways. I lost a lot of hair genetically over the past 4 years or so and no girls around my age would want to be with a fat, bald and ugly guy. Everyone goes for the good looking guy with nice hair. I could probably get a hair transplant or whatever the case may be but even with hair I had the same problems so I've decided to let it be and go bald. Even then, I'm at a point in life where I wouldn't be able to tell if the girl wants to be with me or just use me for my money. I can't really say I regretted the brothel experience either since it was meant to be a one-off thing. Honestly speaking I don't think this will be the last time that I visit a brothel like this. If I get the opportunity again I'm definitely taking it up.

Moral of the story is that I'll never get to experience the Disney type of true love that we were all promised growing up just because I'm balding, ugly and broken.",9,1767164777.0,ForeverAlone,5,0.76,False

She takes ONE sip and immediately says it's wrong. Says its not hot enough even though the steam was literally visible. I offer to remake it and she goes ""well I don't have time now, I have to get to my yoga class."" 

So I'm like okay... sorry about that, have a good night. And she just STARES at me. Finally she goes ""aren't you going to offer me a refund or a free drink card?"" I explained that company policy is we can remake drinks but we can't do refunds if the drink was made correctly, which it was.

She asked for my manager. My manager (23F, absolutely amazing) comes out and repeats the same policy. This woman then says ""I spend $6 here almost every day and THIS is how you treat loyal customers?"" My manager very calmly points out that she's never seen her before in the 2 years she's worked here.

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

If it doesn’t, at least we had a decent conversation.

      Frankly, Gregg wasn't even a real writer. He'd tell you that himself, he'd say, “Oh, I'm no Stephen King. I just like to scribble a bit sometimes for fun, you know.” If it came up at all that is, his writing, and it usually didn't, for a couple reasons. Firstly, because most of what Gregg wrote was poetry; he knew that as a general rule poems were rarely of interest to anyone besides their author and didn't presume his own would be exceptions, though he liked a few of them quite well. (Sometimes at night he'd dare to think, maybe it was only the wrong time - all the celebrity poets had been dead for ages, even celebrated poets weren't celebrities now, and the folks who did read poetry didn't like for it to rhyme anymore. But that's beside the point. Gregg's poems aren't why you know his name,  after all.) Secondly, because what wasn't poetry, the fiction, well, let's just say he had written a lot of beginnings. A great beginner of stories, he was, but for finishing them he hadn't the knack. 
      Given that he didn't talk much about writing, not being a real writer, most everybody acquainted with Gregg was rightfully astonished when they heard he had written a story, an honest-to-god short story that people had read and were talking about. Gregg had been astonished, too.
      Maybe it should've been a clue to him back then, as Gregg was completing the first draft, that something was different now. It wasn't at all usual how easily it came, and how had he even thought of it in the first place? Gregg couldn't say where the idea had come from but the story practically wrote itself when he sat down to type; some sort of miraculous change had come over him and for once he didn't struggle indecisively over names, get lost on detours, or write himself into any dead ends. This time he wasn't working to figure out what to say, just how to say it, and Gregg was grateful. It felt like being given an unexpected little gift. When he did the rewrite he had six decent pages of second draft, and a little seed of excitement germinating in his chest. “This… might actually be good,” Gregg marveled softly to himself. He printed a copy, stapled the pages together, and slipped them into the desk's top drawer, the long shallow one. Gregg was in his middle years and a touch old-fashioned that way; it wouldn't feel fully real unless he had a paper copy.
      When he revisited his little tale three days later Gregg was surprised and gratified to discover he still liked it. True, there was more violence than his normal fare, but, he thought, no more than was necessary to the plot - Gregg had aimed to horrify, not glorify, and believed it hit the mark. And even the names - at first some felt generic to him, just placeholders until he could put more thought into them, but on rereading they honestly seemed right somehow. Gregg leaned back in his chair, wondering. Did he really have something here, after all? Something more than filler for a desk drawer? 
      All week at work Gregg thought about it. He didn't suppose there was much of a market in publishing for amateur short stories, and truthfully it sounded a bit tedious to go around submitting to magazines and contests and things. Spooky season was coming up and there were podcasts that read original fiction, Gregg had listened to a few of them; of course, he hadn't written his to be an audio production, and there was still the matter of submitting, and waiting to hear back. But there were places on the internet where some people shared their work, and other people read it. Lots and lots of places in fact, Gregg found. Saturday night after he posted his story on Reddit Gregg toasted himself with a hot tea and pulled up his new project on the laptop. He was a new person now, a man who finished stories, a horror writer, and he'd had some compelling ideas recently. 

      He slept late Sunday according to his custom. When Gregg woke nearly noon it was the first thing he thought of, to wonder how his debut story was faring out in the world so far, but something about that embarrassed him so Gregg made himself shower and dress, then drive round the corner to the café for coffee and a breakfast bagel before finally indulging his curiosity. 
      Gregg didn't play at false modesty with himself. He expected to have some views and a few upvotes perhaps, and hoped to see a comment or two with encouragement or thoughtful critique. He didn't expect quite so many comments. His heart beat a little harder. When he scrolled through them Gregg was surprised again by what he was reading. 'Hey, that's my town!' jumped off the screen at him. And another: 'i use to live on the road that guy drives after bashing his wifes head in omg.' Gregg blinked. He supposed it made sense some town somewhere would really have that name, it wasn't terribly original; bit of a coincidence about the road, though. Gregg scrolled farther. 'Wow lol I tried to fish there too as a kid, OP were we neighbors???'  Another user believed they knew who the poster was, that they were at a party together when they heard about a corrupt sheriff's department that operated back in the day. Well, that was certainly strange. Gregg closed out of the app and got up to leave. The bagel wasn't sitting quite right on his stomach. 
      Monday evening after work he checked again. There were more views and more comments, not many with feedback about Gregg's writing skills though. Someone had found some decades-old yearbooks and linked to photos of the staff page where they had circled a teacher in the sixth row. Another user claimed to be digging into old missing persons cases from the area and requesting records from the Sheriff's Department. There was even a thread where people debated whether Gregg's work was a story or a confession. He thought about drafting a response ('Hey folks thank you for reading but it's just a story, I've never even been to that part of the country and those are all just coincidences') but decided it would blow over on its own shortly. There really wasn't anything for people to get excited about, after all. He'd made it all up. 
      The next day Gregg's post had triple the views and new people had joined the conversation. An assistant librarian had been digitizing old newspapers and stumbled upon articles mentioning a certain sheriff's deputy by name. A couple users shared maps with areas of interest highlighted, and discussed coordinates together. More and more people were asking each other, and asking Gregg: 'Is there really a body out there?' Of course there isn't, he thought. And then: There could be. How would he know? He hadn't known the town was there, but it was. There's no way he could have known there was a body buried out there before he was born, and there's no way he can know there isn't one. Gregg shook his head and thought he was being silly. 
      “It's just a story,” Gregg told himself under his breath. But he had a hard time falling asleep that night anyway.
       By the weekend Gregg didn't know what to tell himself. It was on the news now. A trio of college friends, two criminal justice majors and an aspiring investigative journalist, had gone out with pick and shovel based on what the news anchor called a “creepypasta” and actually found remains. Law enforcement had secured the scene and interviewed the students. They were actively investigating all leads and seeking information on the author of the post. 
      “Christ-on-a-cactus son of a cunt!” Gregg was alone in front of his TV but he jerked, almost clapped a hand over his own mouth. That wasn't one of his swears. Gregg would maybe write that kind of language for a character, but it spooked him to hear the words in his voice. Partly to clear them from the air he scolded himself aloud, “What have you got yourself into, Gregg?” He shot a suspicious glare at his laptop where it lay closed on his desk against the far wall, and blew out a breath. He knew he had to call the onscreen number, get this straightened out with the authorities. Gregg hated phone calls but he made himself pick up the phone and start dialing. Better to sort things right away, he thought, keeps everything simple.  
      Everything was not simple. It started out not simple and only got briefly simpler when Gregg finally hired a lawyer. Police had identified some of the remains (Some! Gregg was dumbfounded, and then nauseous - his story had only hinted at more, there wasn't a number, how many bodies would they find?) and there were frankly too many details matching for the connection to be ignored. The detectives weren't accusing him of murder, most of the remains they'd uncovered had been dead longer than Gregg had been alive, but they couldn't accept that Gregg didn't know more than he was saying, that he wasn't protecting some loathsome source. Gregg wasn't a real writer but he knew the words accessory, aiding and abetting. After hiring representation Gregg had two days of glorious peace before the cops leaked his info to the media, and that's probably when you first heard of him. 
      At first he thought he could clear up all the rumors if he did some interviews, and objectively speaking Gregg didn't do too bad, he didn't make a fool of himself on camera or anything. I worked with the guy almost four years, and I couldn't tell he was struggling. If you watch the last one you can kind of see it in his face though, when Drew asks him whether he's written any other stories, right before Gregg gets up and walks offstage he gets this look. That's the day his house burned down, the last day we saw Gregg. 
      I considered us friends, not best bros or anything but office pals. That's why I volunteered to be the one to take Gregg's work computer down to the IT department where it would get wiped before being reassigned to a new hire. And I did take it to IT, but I had a look around the files on it first; I guess I kind of wondered what Gregg used to work on during his lunch breaks. Turns out, most of it was journaling and a few crappy poems but some of it was - well, he'd have said fiction, but the thing is, one of those stories on there? There's no way he could have known anything at all about that, but I knew, Christ-on-a-fucking-cauliflower I knew the ending three lines in, because I'm in it. It's even got my real name, before I changed it,  I mean. And it's another true story.

[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/pdf/jenb-18-3-293.pdf](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/pdf/jenb-18-3-293.pdf)

The objectives of the present study were to determine the effect of sun exposure and aerobic exercise on quality of sleep and investigate sleep-related hormonal responses in college-aged males.

\[Methods\]

In this study, the cross-over design was utilized. The subjects (N = 10) without any physical problems or sleep disorders participated in the experimental performed 4 protocols in only sun exposure (for 30 minutes, EG1) protocol, only aerobic exercise (walking and jogging for 30 minutes, EG2) protocol, aerobic exercise with sun exposure (EG3) protocol, and control (no exercise and no sun exposure, EG4) protocol. Each protocol was 5 times per week with one-week break (wash-out period) between protocols to prevent the effects of the previous protocol. Total test period was should be 7 weeks (one week of protocol and one week of break). Before and after each aerobic exercise session, the subjects completed stretching to warm up for 5 to 10 minutes. Surveys consisting of (bedtime, wake-up time, sleep onset latency, and (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were obtained before the test and after each protocol. After each protocol, the following sleep-related hormonal responses were measured: blood concentrations of melatonin, cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. One-way ANOVA was used to determine differences between protocols. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.

\[Results\]

Bedtime of EG4 was significantly later than that of the EG1 or EG3. Wake-up time in the EG4 was significantly later than that of the EG1 or the EG3. Sleep onset latency in the EG4 was longer than that of the EG3. The quality of sleep in the EG4 was lower than that of the EG3. Sleep cycle in the EG4 was significantly shorter than that of the EG1. Blood melatonin concentrations of the EG3 was significantly higher than that of the EG4. There were no significant differences in blood concentrations of cortisol, epinephrine, or norepinephrine among protocols, with the order from the lowest to the highest values of EG1 < EG2 < EG3 < EG4.

\[Conclusion\]

The present data found that EG1 and EG3 showed positive sleep-related hormonal responses, sleep habits, and quality of sleep, indicating that sun exposure or exercise with sun exposure may improve the physical status and quality of life.

  
Sleep patterns are influenced by biological factors such as age, sex, and circadian rhythms \[[1](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b1-jenb-18-3-293)\]. As we enter the phase of adolescence through childhood, our bedtime gets later, and our amount of sleep gets smaller. After the adolescence, the amount of sleep increases with age and bedtime gets moved forward. Women between 50 and 70 years old have a tendency to have more amount of sleep because they go to bed earlier and get up later than men in the same age range. They frequently wake up from their sleep with longer awake time \[[2](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b2-jenb-18-3-293)\-[3](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b3-jenb-18-3-293)\].

Sleep plays a direct role in physical and mental recovery, memory, learning, growth, and lifespan. Proper average amount of sleep is known to be 8 hours. In regard to sleep, human body has a circadian rhythm of a 24-hour cycle. Insomnia or hypersomnia can be caused by irregular sleep patterns, anxiety, stress, overwork, excessive exercise, jet lag, and endocrine disorders in the pineal gland \[[40](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b40-jenb-18-3-293)\].

Sleep patterns can be changed by social, environmental, and psychological factors other than biological factors. University students may have irregular sleep-wake cycle due to late bedtime following social or academic requirements \[[5](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b5-jenb-18-3-293)\]. A lifestyle can also affect sleep patterns. The larger the allowance of a female university student is, the later she goes to bed \[[6](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b6-jenb-18-3-293)\]. The quality of sleep gets lowered by smoking, drinking, or caffeine intake \[[7](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b7-jenb-18-3-293)\]. Besides, an individual’s subjective physical conditions are related to sleep patterns \[[8](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b8-jenb-18-3-293)\]. Generally, in terms of biochemistry of the endocrine system, the importance of melatonin secreted from the pineal gland has been emphasized in sleep disorders \[[9](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b9-jenb-18-3-293)\]. Melatonin as a pineal hormone is related to sleep. It has a clear rhythm of secretion. Melatonin is secreted at the highest level in the blood at night. It is rarely released during the day. The melatonin secretion is regulated by the stimuli of neurons in the suprachiasmatic thalamic nucleus that controls mammalian biological cycles \[[10](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b10-jenb-18-3-293)\-[11](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b11-jenb-18-3-293)\]. Besides, melatonin has been reported to play important roles in controlling nocturnal and diurnal mammalian biological cycles \[[12](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b12-jenb-18-3-293)\]. Human melatonin can induce momentary hypothermia \[[13](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b13-jenb-18-3-293)\-[14](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b14-jenb-18-3-293)\], hypnosis \[[15](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b15-jenb-18-3-293)\-[18](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b18-jenb-18-3-293)\], and changes in biorhythms \[[19](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b19-jenb-18-3-293)\-[20](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b20-jenb-18-3-293)\]. It is closely related to the beginning of sleep as well as the maintenance of sleep \[[21](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b21-jenb-18-3-293)\-[22](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b22-jenb-18-3-293)\].

Exercise has been suggested to be a method to enrich the quality of sleep \[[23](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b23-jenb-18-3-293)\]. Several studies with healthy volunteers reported that acute and long-term exercises increased slow-wave sleep and total sleeping time while reducing the lack of sleep \[[24](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b24-jenb-18-3-293)\-[25](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b25-jenb-18-3-293)\]. However, the finding that exercise helps sleep is not accepted world-wide \[[26](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b26-jenb-18-3-293)\]. Several domestic researches dealing with the relationship between sleep and exercise have been conducted on subjects such as sleep and health, biorhythms, metabolic responses, and athletic performance \[[27](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b27-jenb-18-3-293)\-[29](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b29-jenb-18-3-293)\]. Correlation studies on exercise and sleep conditions including the influence of exercise intensity and hours on sleep \[[30](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b30-jenb-18-3-293)\], sleep disorders and performance capability \[[31](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b31-jenb-18-3-293)\-[32](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b32-jenb-18-3-293)\], and the influence of melatonin on sleep have been conducted \[[33](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b33-jenb-18-3-293)\-[34](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b34-jenb-18-3-293)\].

With regard to the role of melatonin in exercise and sleep, exercise late at night is reported to significantly decrease melatonin levels during sleep \[[35](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b35-jenb-18-3-293)\]. This result suggests that physical activities in improper time could cause sleep disorders through influencing melatonin level.

Sunlight is often considered as either beneficial or poisonous. Outside of ultraviolet rays, the visible light spectrum is generally considered to be poisonous. But a reasonable amount can be beneficial. Living in a sunny house helps healthy, bright, cheerful, and energetic life. Sunlight largely and variously influences health. Cycling adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) gets released by the stimulus of adrenocortical hormones due to intake of coffee, tea, chocolate, or stress. Excessive cAMP release accelerates energy release to reach excitement condition that leads us to be nervous and unsettled. However, sunlight exposure decreases cAMP, leading to peaceful and settled conditions \[[53](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b53-jenb-18-3-293)\]. Several studies have reported that sun exposure could improve the quality and state of the sleep as well as the sleep patterns, therefore improving the quality of life \[[36](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b36-jenb-18-3-293)\-[38](https://e-pan.org/m/journal/view.php?doi=10.5717/jenb.2014.18.3.293#b38-jenb-18-3-293)\]. Although many studies have studied the correlation between sunlight exposure and sleep or sunlight exposure and exercise, studies on sunlight exposure and exercise on sleep are insufficient. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were to determine the effect of sun exposure and aerobic exercise on quality of sleep and investigate sleep-related hormonal responses in male university students who suffered from unemployment and stayed indoors for long hours.

# Object of study

Subjects were composed of male university students in their 20s who had no physical, medical, or sleep disorders. All subjects gave consent to this study.

They were divided into 4 four groups: sun exposure for 30 min (EG1), aerobic exercise with walking and jogging (EG2), aerobic exercise group with sun exposure (EG3), no exercise and no sun exposure control (EG4). Each group was assigned 10 subjects to compare and analyze changes in the quality of sleep and sleep-related responses according to sun exposure and exercise. Subjects had height of 175.8 ± 5.69 cm and weight of 73.2 ± 7.55 kg.

# Sun exposure and exercise protocol

A total of 6 weeks of sun exposure and exercise were conducted to the same subject. Each experiment was conducted at 1-week interval to wash out the effect of previous experiment. A high-fat and high-protein diet was maintained for three meals a day without alcohol consumption. Diets of subjects were recorded prior to initial blood collection. Subjects were told to maintain similar diet prior to each blood collection after each experiment. Sun exposure was conducted by sitting outside for 30 minutes from 11 to 11:30 am to avoid excessively hot sunlight \[[39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/#b39-jenb-18-3-293)\]. The average temperature was about 20℃. The average humidity was 60\~70%. Aerobic exercises such as walking or running were performed. The exercise protocol consisted of five times of exercise session per week. Each exercise session contained 5 to 10 minute indoor stretching prior to and post exercise. Main exercise session was 30 minutes. Exercise intensity was measured by a wireless heart rate monitor (polar system). The intensity for each individual was moderate (50\~60% of the maximum heart rate/HRmax) calculated with Karvonen formula by substituting target heart rate.

# Surveys

Survey of the present study was conducted one time prior to each experiment in the morning of the day after each experiment. The questionnaire included simple personal information, questions about sleep pattern during weekdays (bedtime, wake-up time, and sleep onset latency), and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) developed by Buysse *et al.* \[[40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/#b40-jenb-18-3-293)\]. PSQI, a tool used to measure the quality of sleep, contains a total of 24 questions. The first part contains 19 questions to self-evaluate sleep. The second part contains five questions for cohabitant to confirm subject’s state of sleep. The present study used the first 19 questions of PSQI translated in Korean \[[41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/#b41-jenb-18-3-293)\-[42](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/#b42-jenb-18-3-293)\]. The 19 questions were divided into 7 subcategories: quality of sleep, sleep onset latency, amount of sleep, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleeping pills, and daytime impairment. The sum of each subcategory became the overall index for sleep quality evaluation. The higher the grade was, the lower the quality of sleep was. The credibility of this tool (Cronbach’s α) was 0.61.

# Blood collection and analysis

Each blood collection per experiment was conducted in the morning after 8-hour fasting for a 5-day experiment per week. Blood was collected from the median cubital vein. A total of 10 ml blood was collected during each blood collection. Collected blood was stored at -80\~-70℃ after serum separation following 5-minute centrifugation at 3,000 rpm. Stored blood was sent to a clinical center for analysis. Melatonin was protected from light and analyzed by radioimmunoassay using γ-counter (Cobra Qunatum, Packard Instruments Company, Meriden, USA). Cortisol was analyzed by radioimmunoassay using double antibody procedure (Coat-A-Count kit, diagnostic products corporation, Los Angeles, CA, USA). Catecholamine was analyzed by HPLCECD system (AS4000).

# Statistics

Statistical analysis was conducted by using One-way ANOVA for comparison of the sleep satisfaction following sun exposure and/or exercise and of the sleep-related responses. All data were analyzed by SPSS ver. 18.0 to calculate the mean and the standard deviation of each measurement item. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.

# RESULTS

The present study conducted experiments by dividing groups into sun exposure group (EG1), exercise group (EG 2), exercise group with sun exposure (EG3), and control group (EG 4) to compare and analyze the quality of sleep and sleep-related responses depending on sun exposure during exercise. The results on the quality of sleep (PSQI) and sleep-related responses (blood level of melatonin, cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine) are summarized in the following:

# DISCUSSION

Healthy sleep affects physical and mental recovery, memory, learning, growth, and active longevity. The proper average amount of sleep is known to be 8 hours. In regard to sleep, human body has a circadian rhythm following a 24-hour cycle. Irregular sleep and sleep disorders can cause anxiety, stress, overwork, excessive exercise, jet lag, and endocrine disorders in the pineal gland, which can result in insomnia or hypersomnia. Sleep disorders of the elderly are considered as warnings for future degenerative diseases \[[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/#b4-jenb-18-3-293)\]. Melatonin is a sleep inducing hormones. It has a secretion cycle related to sleep. Melatonin is secreted the most at night. It is rarely secreted during the day. It is closely related to the initiation of deep sleep and the maintenance of a good quality of sleep \[[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/#b21-jenb-18-3-293)\].

Sun exposure improves the quality of sleep, state of sleep, and sleep patterns. Furthermore, it improves the quality of life \[[36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/#b36-jenb-18-3-293)\-[38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/#b38-jenb-18-3-293)\]. Previous studies on the correlation between sunlight and sleep reported that changes in melatonin secretion improved the quality of sleep \[[36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/#b36-jenb-18-3-293)\]. For the elderly with low melatonin secretion, sun exposure improved their sleep \[[43](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/#b43-jenb-18-3-293)\].

Even though risk factors of obesity are generally known as family history, eating habits, amount of exercise, and other lifestyle-related habits through previous studies. Recently, discussions on the effects of duration and quality of sleep on obesity are being actively progressed \[[44](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/#b44-jenb-18-3-293)\]. Hauri \[[24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/#b24-jenb-18-3-293)\] reported that exercise can enhance the quality of sleep. Metabolic responses \[[45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/#b45-jenb-18-3-293)\], athletic performance \[[46](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/#b46-jenb-18-3-293)\-[47](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/#b47-jenb-18-3-293)\], and health \[[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/#b28-jenb-18-3-293)\-[29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/#b29-jenb-18-3-293)\] with regard to biorhythms have been studied. Correlation between exercise and sleep conditions such as exercise intensity and hour affecting sleep \[[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/#b30-jenb-18-3-293)\], sleep disorders and athletic performance \[[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/#b31-jenb-18-3-293)\], excessive exercise affecting sleep \[[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/#b30-jenb-18-3-293),[48](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/#b48-jenb-18-3-293),[49](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/#b49-jenb-18-3-293)\], athletic performance affected by sleep deprivation \[[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/#b31-jenb-18-3-293),[50](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/#b50-jenb-18-3-293)\], and melatonin affecting sleep \[[33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/#b33-jenb-18-3-293)\-[34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/#b34-jenb-18-3-293)\] have been reported. The present study showed that the sun exposure group and exercise group with sun exposure had the earliest bedtime and wake-up time. The exercise group with sun exposure presented the shortest sleep onset latency. Meanwhile, the control group showed the latest bedtime and wake-up time and the longest hours to reach deep sleep with shorter duration of sleep. The quality of sleep in the control group was low. In addition, melatonin secretion got lower in the order of exercise group with sun exposure and the sun exposure group without exercise. The sun exposure group showed low level of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine compared to the control group. Sleep restores physical functions and mental health beyond simple recovery. Sleep plays an important role in arranging and memorizing newly acquired information. Therefore, adequate amount of sleep is important for physical and mental health as well as task performance. However, for university students, they tend to be the evening type which is also observed at adolescence \[[51](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/#b51-jenb-18-3-293)\]. In other words, they are frequently active late at night due to task performance for educational purpose or social activities \[[52](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4241899/#b52-jenb-18-3-293)\]. Meanwhile, they usually have difficulties to maintain healthy sleep habits due to the lack of sleep caused by lecture schedule or other social requirement that starts early in the morning. They have decreased quality of sleep following irregular sleep-wake cycle. Besides, learning activity in libraries for future job seeking and day and night part time job to solve financial problems can result in their lack of sleep and reduced physical activities. Therefore, university students are more vulnerable to sleep problems related to decreased physical activities. Therefore, it is important for them to grasp sleep patterns and physical activities. The present study showed that exercise group with sun exposure and sun exposure group without exercise positively affected sleep patterns and the quality of sleep. Other than merely accepting the finding that lack of sleep and reduced physical activities were caused by stress from financial status and job seeking of university students, it is important to educate and encourage university students to have enough time to exercise under sunlight for at least 30 minutes a day. This is important for their healthy sleep which affects academic performance and social relationships.

# CONCLUSION

By comparing the quality of sleep, the order of bedtime of subjects from early to late was: the sun exposure group > the exercise group with sun exposure > the exercise group > the control group. The control group had significantly later bedtime than that of the sun exposure group or the exercise group with sun exposure. The order of wake-up time from early to late was: the exercise group with sun exposure > sun exposure group > the exercise group > the control group. Sleep onset duration got longer in the control group compared to the sun exposure group or the exercise group with sun exposure. The control group also showed lower quality of sleep. The duration of sleep in the order of short to long was: control group < exercise group with sun exposure < exercise group < sun exposure group.

In comparison of sleep-related responses, melatonin level was significantly higher in the exercise group with sun exposure than in the control group. The level of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine in the order low to higher was: the sun exposure group < the exercise group with sun exposure < exercise group < the control group. However, these levels were not significantly different. Based on these results, we concluded that both sun exposure group and exercise group with sun exposure positively affected sleep-related hormonal responses, showing good sleep habits and high quality of sleep.

I miss you! I guess you have already moved on, but I’m still stuck here. Now that the time you’ve been gone is longer than the time you were here, I just want to be honest about why it hasn’t been easy. I didn’t realize how much of myself I had given until it was gone, and that’s why it hurt the way it did. I just didn’t lose you, I also lost the hopes and dreams I carried with you. It’s hard to wait around for some thing that I know may never happen, but it’s even harder to let go of something that I know could be more special. My life was better with than without you. I’m a grateful person and I’m always grateful for the life I’m building. But the grace I had when you were here is always greater than the grace I have now that you’re gone. If I could go back time, I would do it all again no matter how short it was.

I really wanted to invest in you, and in us - but you broke my heart during your favorite season….I always felt peace whenever I was with you. You were my peace that blurs out the noise of this world. I was so ready to go through all the ups and downs with you because I know you are worth it. If I let my mind wander and get lost, it always finds you… I find you in a thousand small choices I make without thinking. I can't stand the thought of you with someone else and I can't stand the reality that I'm not with you anymore. I still keep your number saved. Not because I'll ever call, but deleting it feels like admitting to myself that you're never coming back...

Aaaaaaaa. Sometimes when you miss someone, you end up remembering so many things about them - their favorite food, their favorite drink or their favorite routine. You remember the warmth of being close to them: the sound of their laughter, the color of their eyes, the scent of their hair….Everything you can feel in and through the air. And I remember all of it about you - I guess remembering things is my way of missing you. Someday I say: I remember a lot about you, and about those good days when I still had you with me. But you know “I miss you more than I could ever remember you” (Ocean Vuong)

I miss you! I miss seeing you excited about all the plans and dates I wanted to take you on and showed you. I really wanted to see you play the piano one day. I really wanted to get you some yarns as your birthday gifts. I really wanted to go hiking/camping with you. I really wanted to see a vogue ballroom with you. I really wanted to show you a dance battle that I’d join. I really wanted to go and see the Nutcracker ballet with you. I wanted to show you Morning Disco where we can all dance to funk/disco music with coffee in hands on a random Sunday. I wanted to plan a getaway trip with you. I really wanted to teach you snowboarding and showed you how beautiful it is from the too of a mountain... Now I’m doing all of these alone as I had been to before you, but empty. Sometimes I found myself saying ""Caroline would love this""...There’s always a part in me aching after you’ve gone, no matter what I do and how I build my life.

I miss you! Every day, every night, there’s this quiet part of me that still reaches for you, still hopes for you, still believes in us. I miss your voice, your energy, the way just hearing your name could calm me down. And I miss the version of me I got to be when you were in my life - proud, fulfilled and the most grateful.

I miss you! I miss cooking with you and all the shows we watched laying in bed next to each other. I miss how I just laid in bed snd fell asleep next to you. You would hold me and stroke my hair, and when I would wake up, you would smile and offer to make me a coffee. I miss your hand on mine walking down all the streets, in a restaurant, on the bus…we never missed a chance to hold hands. And I miss your kiss every single time we say goodbye

I met you when I was not looking for you and I lost you when I was most sure about you. I would have always chosen you, Caroline. I always wanted it to be you, until I realized you didn’t want it to be me. As much as I wanted us to start over, you wouldn’t have chosen me…

I know this is not the love I am meant to spend my life in, but knowing that does not stop my heart from wanting you. It does not stop me from checking my phone, hoping your name is there. It does not stop me from replaying our best moments like a movie I cannot turn off. It doesn’t stop me from wondering if you were thinking about me too. I wish I could let you go. I wish I could wake up one morning and feel nothing, but instead I feel everything. I’d still get butterflies if I see you. I’d still hold my breath when you walk into a room. I do not want to want you, but I do. I want you in a way that makes no sense. I want you even though every part of me knows you will never give me the love I deserve. Even though things didn’t work out the way we wanted them to, I need you to know how deeply I loved our time together. I wouldn’t be okay if I didn’t tell you how incredible and beautiful in and out of a person you are. I am always going to remember and be grateful for you.

Caroline, you were the partner I had been looking for. You hold all the qualities that I value in a partner and that I uphold myself to, and I don't think I can find anyone else like you.... And maybe one day, I will be strong enough to choose myself over you, and I won't find someone better than you, but better for me. But right now, I’m still choosing you even when I know better.

We will probably never meet again. So one day when you walk down the aisle and complete the great love story that's yours, I hope you remember that I'm glad to see you win. How can I claim to be on the side of love if I can't even support it in someone I once fell in love with...

Do you miss me like I miss you?

It’s not for meeting daily requirements, from what I’m seeing online and in videos no one is pushing the fact that you will be superhuman taking it or it’s a miracle salt. It’s simply for hydration. When you feel dehydrated it’s a shitty feeling your body and mind both feel flat and tired. What sea salt does is help pull more water into the cell due to those trace amounts of minerals it contains. 1 or couple grains under the tongue is the best way to take it from what i read because mucosa membrane absorbs it a-lot faster. The reason why I’m here is because i take stimulant medication and i will try anything that is safe and deemed natural to help me stay hydrated because those stimulant crashes are no joke along with those miserable headaches. My question is i tried the Selina brand and for some reason my body just doesn’t agree with it. I take one crystal grain under the tongue and start my daily water intake but like half hour goes by and i just start feeling weird from it my muscles cramp up my body gets tense and i just feel weird. Far from all the reading I’ve done on this topic, i am 2 days in yesterday being my first time trying it i felt weird  for half the day and today i woke up with a dull headache that progressively got worse through out the day. I do take my stimulants at around 11am because i don’t like taking them when i first wake up as i like to have coffee and water first. I noticed the last couple days after taking my stimulants trying this new hydration method that i just don’t feel good at all and experience the symptoms i stated above. Idk could there be an interaction between the sea salt and my medication  i don’t take it together it’s about 2 hrs before i take my stimulant medication. Has anyone tried this method and felt the same way. I have no history of blood pressure issues no diseases i am a healthy 38yr old male who lives off healthy eating water exercise fruits and veggies and multivitamins. I am leaning towards discontinuing this method because my body is completely rejecting it and telling me it doesn’t like it, unless anyone has information about it. 

Ps today i find out this company has lawsuit (Selina brand Celtic Salt) for having lead and arsenic in it in trace amounts of course but my body is definitely rejecting it from the symptoms I’m experiencing so idk let me know what you think?",1,1767162887.0,adderall_dextroamphet,0,1.0,False

1q0639g,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1q0639g/i_launched_people_sign_up_and_bounce_and_im/,"I launched, people sign up and bounce… and I’m getting ZERO feedback. What am I doing wrong?","Hey all — I’m in that frustrating early-stage phase where everyone gives the same advice:

“Just talk to your users.”

I **want** to.. But my users won’t talk back.

I recently launched my product. I can see signups and some usage, so it’s not totally dead. But when I reach out for feedback (usually a short, friendly email), I get basically zero replies. Not even “looks good” or “not interested.” Just silence.

At this point I’m stuck between two fears:

* The product is confusing / not valuable enough, so they don’t care to respond
* My outreach is wrong (timing, wording, channel), so I’m failing to get a conversation going

And the problem is: without feedback, I’m guessing what to build next. I don’t want to spend weeks shipping things nobody asked for.

For those of you who’ve been here:

1. What *actually* got early users to respond for you?
2. Email vs in-app prompt vs surveys vs “can I buy you coffee” calls — what worked best?
3. Any specific message template that improved reply rates? (Happy to share mine too)
4. If users won’t reply, how do you still figure out what to prioritize? (analytics? session recordings? concierge onboarding?)

I’m not looking for generic “talk to users” advice — I’m looking for the practical playbook when they’re silent.

Would love to hear what you tried and what finally worked.",1,1767162574.0,SaaS,7,1.0,False
1q061l3,https://www.reddit.com/r/iih/comments/1q061l3/diamox_hack_via_chatgpt/,Diamox Hack via ChatGpt,"I’m super new to my IIH diagnosis and was recently prescribed Diamox 500 mg ER twice a day. Prior to starting the medication I gave ChatGPT a few prompts to help me prepare in order to minimize the side effects. It’s only been a week but I’ve had very few side effects so far and I wanted to share my plan just in case it’s helpful for anyone else who may be suffering. If you are someone like me who also takes other medications (antidepressants, allergy pills, etc) I would suggest that you ask ChatGPT to develop a plan that includes those prescriptions as well. I didn’t include mine here, but knowing when to take them during the day is also super useful info. Good luck!

It started when I posted a birthday story and he replied wishing me happy birthday and asking how I was celebrating. He also shared details about his birthday and said things like celebrating with friends is nice.

The next day he asked how my birthday went, which I found a little unexpected since we don’t really know each other and even some of my close friends didn’t ask how it went. Most people usually leave it at wishing.

Then on Christmas I posted a simple “Merry Christmas” note, and he replied “Merry Christmas :)” and immediately added: “Should def hang out and do something quick like go for a coffee when we get back to school.”

I said yeah sure, just let me know when.

Later, he guessed where I was from and when I asked how he knew, he replied: “May or may not have looked at your bio 😳🫢”

One more thing: he’s graduating this year (so he’s older) and I’m a first-year. He has completed his masters in education.

Only he has been the one initiating contact and suggesting meeting up.

So I’m confused, does this sound like someone just being friendly and social, or someone who’s low-key interested but trying to keep it chill? Also I think it is really weird for anyone to reach out to someone like this and I think when a random guy slides into a girl’s DMs, it didn’t always seem 100% platonic.",1,1767162218.0,NoStupidQuestions,2,0.67,False

1q05y6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hernia/comments/1q05y6o/question_about_ways_of_sitting/,Question about ways of sitting,"Last week I was diagnosed with “fat-containing partially reducible inguinal hernia, 4.2 x 1.0 x 2.3 cm. Size of the defect measures 1.3 x 1.2 cm”, left side. Urgent care was pretty matter of fact about it, and mostly just said Advil, heat, consider a belt, and wait for the consult with the surgical team, which isn’t until February 23.

Due to the sort of autistic haze I was in during the appointment, several questions did not even occur to me. Right now, my biggest is about sitting positions.

So far, the most I’ve even felt it was last week when I went to urgent care. Since then, maybe a vague ache or a feeling like a bruise. It is not visible.

Anyway, my ask: at home, I often tuck my legs under me as I sit and watch TV. Out at coffee, I typically cross one leg over the other. Being the paranoiac that I am when sole part of my body has gone awry, I fear just trying these positions.

Hopefully folks here will have some guidance, understanding that nothing will be a 1:1 with my specifics.
