Sometimes they wouldn’t fight for a few days and things would go okay for a while, but the moment they started fighting again, I couldn’t study anymore. We didn’t have any technological devices or anything else that could distract me—just books and school materials in front of me—but during my 12 years of schooling, I was never able to study because of all the chaos.

These fights happened regularly every morning and evening, and during the day my mom would be extremely stressed. At school, I was bullied. There were times I tried to get motivated and study out of ambition, but then my family started beating me—probably because I had reached an age where I was ""old enough"" to be beaten.

It started when I spilled coffee on the floor before the high school entrance exam. My family beat me while screaming like dinosaurs, and that day I gave up on studying and became addicted to video games.

When I started high school, I failed a grade. My senior year passed with my family and people around me constantly bullying and humiliating me. They actually enjoyed these fights and the bullying—they would laugh about it and talk about it openly.",1,1748362112.0,ADHD,2,1.0,False
1kwr7kn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kwr7kn,Why is my coffee so watery ? [KRUPS XP3440 Calvi 1460W/ no Grinder :( ],"Hello :) 

I am quite new to the espresso game and have been trying for days. I got some good espressos so I know it is possible hahah

So I own a bottomless portafilter and the Krups portafilter. I have a stamp and no grinder. 
When I use the bottomless portafilter (pic 1) I get a very bitter/ sour espresso with watery texture and almost no crema.
When I use the Krups portafilter (pic 3) I get a really good crema and texture but the taste is also a bit bitter. Also whenever I use the Krups portafilter water starts flowing over the portafilter and into my espresso making it watery ( is my machine broken ? ) 
With both portafilter I have the problem that the coffe puck is way to watery and water is swimming on top of it. 
I use the right amount of espresso and also used the 25-30 sec rule. 
I have been trying for days watching countless YouTube videos to get a better espresso.
Pls help :,(

I will eventually buy a grinder but I don’t have the money yet. As said before I know it is possible to achieve a good espresso just with my illy Classico blend. 
Thx in advance :)

1kwr3iw,https://i.redd.it/esgeub0elc3f1.png,"He Faked Death for Mistress,I Faked It for Revenge-After sending the message, my fingers shook so badly I almost dropped the phone. Inside the room, their conversation kept going. I figured out how to read it—I unraveled the story to its last secret.","After sending the message, my fingers shook so badly I almost dropped the phone. Inside the room, their conversation kept going. “Is this fair to Briar?” Gladys’s voice trembled, laced with a rare hint of guilt. “If it weren’t for the unborn baby, she might’ve ended it all. Watching her so lost, barely eating and living—it’s heartbreaking.” Elliot signed, as though the weight of his lies was finally pressing down. “But Carmilla’s only got six months left,” he said, voice tight. “It’s her last wish, Mom. I can’t just walk away.” “And Briar?” Gladys pushed. “She’s carrying your child.” “I’ll make it up to her in the future.” he said. 

“ Don’t worry,mom.” My heart felt like it was being crushed, the pain instantly radiating through my entire body until I could barely breathe. I stumbled back to my bedroom, knees buckling beneath me as I crumpled onto the floor. My phone vibrated. Conor. “What’s going on, Briar? Is everything okay? Elliot’s… he’s dead, right?” I opened my mouth to speak, but the words wouldn’t come. Instead, tears poured down, hot and blinding. The world knew Elliot Sterling was dead. 



But I knew better. I understood Conor's confusion. Even I couldn't have imagined Elliot would fake his death, let alone that he'd do it for another bitch. Though I said nothing, my brother seemed to sense my emotional state. After a long pause, he spoke softly. ""The day after tomorrow evening. I'll send a plane to pick you up then.I’ll take care of everything else."" After hanging up, I remained frozen in position, still holding the phone. Just then, a gentle knock came at the door. Standing outside was Elliot's ""older brother"" Or rather, Elliot Sterling himself—holding a glass of warm milk. ""Hey, Briar, what’s going on? Why are you sitting on the floor like that? Have you been crying? You... you must be missing Elliot, huh?"" During the weeks since Elliot had returned as his supposed brother, he'd been incredibly kind to me, seemingly treating me as his deceased brother's widow. Countless times when facing his concern, I'd felt lost my mind.

Gladys always attributed this o grief over losing Elliot. I discreetly locked my phone screen and forced a smile. ""It's nothing.The baby kicked me and I lost my balance for a moment."" Elliot visibly relaxed, setting down the milk before carefully helping me up from the floor. ""That little troublemaker.Wait until he's born—his uncle will teach him."" ""Come [on.Here](http://on.Here) some milk for you. Drink it and take a break. Elliot wouldn't hope for this situation."" Hearing him mention his own name, I finally couldn't hold back anymore. I looked directly into his eyes and deliberately asked ""Tell me the truth. Are you Elliot Sterling"" Chapter 2 Elliot froze for a moment, then laughed softly as he gently brushed my hair. “Briar, you’re exhausted,” he said, his tone dripping with fake concern. “Why would you think I’m Elliot? That’s crazy.” ""Tomorrow’s your prenatal checkup. I’ll take you. You need rest.That's my brother's only bloodline in the world. I'm going to make damn sure that baby arrives safely."" I lowered my eyes, unable to stomach the fake concern in his gaze. ""Just go. I’m exhausted."" Only after the door clicked shut did the tears I'd been holding back all evening finally come flooding out. Elliot and I met at a college party.He fell for me at the freshman party.and pursued me. Two years after graduation, he gave me the most extravagant proposal. I still remember that night—the fireworks reflected in his eyes,but his eyes even more brighter than the fireworks. While planning our wedding, I discovered I was pregnant. Elliot had been overjoyed. “Perfect timing,” he whispered, pressing his forehead to mine. “Our baby came for celebrating our wedding. Briar, dear,I'm the happiest man alive right now.” I still can't wrap my head around it. Six years together, and he throws it all away,faking his own death just to bail on our wedding. Early the next morning, Elliot knocked on my door. “Briar?Time for your prenatal checkup. You ready?” But just as we were about to leave, Carmilla's voice called from behind us. “Elliot, baby, I’m not feeling well.

Could you stay with me today?” At the sound of her voice, Elliot didn't even glance my way before rushing to her side. “What’s wrong, sweetheart? You should be resting.” Then he turned to me with a quick glance. “Sorry, Briar,my wife’s not feeling well. James will drive you to the hospital.” “James is outside, he’ll take you. I already called to Dr. Wilson. He's waitting for you. Just go straight over there.” I closed my eyes, trying to hold back the tears threatening to spill. When I opened them again, I didn't miss the fleeting look of satisfaction on Carmilla's face. Without a word, I nodded and walked out, closing the door behind me with a dull [thud.My](http://thud.My) hand unconsciously stroked my belly as heavy tears finally fell. James got me to the hospital on time, and I completed all the scheduled tests. Elliot had previously instructed both the driver and doctor—if I didn't show up, he would become suspicious. I sat in the hospital waiting area, staring at the blurry ultrasound picture. Just a tiny blob on the grainy black-and-white image. The doctor had pointed at it, smiling ""See that? That's your little one."" But I couldn't bear my kid has a father who kept a side piece! I wiped my face with my sleeve and made a quick call to schedule an appointment at another hospital. This was the Sterling family's private hospital—if I had the procedure here, Elliot would definitely find out. I texted James: 'Just going to grab some coffee and take a walk. You can go ahead and leave.' Waiting until his black sedan pulled away,I hurried to the curb and went to another hospital. My phone buzzed just as I was signing the consent form for the abortion. A video message from an unknown number. The video was thirty minutes. In this video, Elliot did no-holds-barred sex which I'd never seen Elliot out of control like this. For six years, he had been Mr. Considerate in bed, and he worried that I would get hurt if he was too rough. Turns out he wasn't naturally restrained in bed. Who can meet his appetite is someone else. I forced myself watch the video, torturing myself with every second of seeing a side of Elliot I never knew. I don't know how long I sat there before a nurse approached me. ""Ms. Briar? Are you alright? It's time for your procedure."" Chapter 3 I couldn't stop crying as I watched the video, even my hand holding the phone couldn't stop shaking. 

The worst part? I still loved that bastard. Even after everything. I couldn't just delete him like a bad Instagram post.Six years. Six goddamn years. Loving Elliot was like breathing—it just came naturally, even now. Everyone always said Elliot was obsessed with me, but they never saw how I'd saved every movie ticket stub from our dates or how I'd memorized his coffee order by our third date. Six years together....and only now. Remembering the rapid little heartbeat I'd heard during the check, I wiped away my tears and took a deep breath.Give the last chance for my baby and Elliot. Then I called him. ""Elliot, can you come to the hospital? I… we need to talk."" His voice came through weirdly breathless. ""I'm kind of in the middle of something. Just Uber home and we'll talk there, okay?"" ""Oh god, Elliot, harder…"",with a soft moan the call disconnected, leaving just the dial tone. I'm not a kid, I knew exactly what he was doing. I looked up at the nurse hovering nearby. ""Well,let’s do it."" It was after dark when I got home. 

The second I stepped through the door,Elliot came striding toward me. ""James said you went around. What'd you buy?"" Then he clocked my puffy eyes. ""What’s wrong? Briar.Did you cry?what happened? About Elliot?Oh,The baby you're carrying belongs to Elliot,at least a comfort "" ""What was this thing you wanted to talk about me?"" I stared at his face—that perfect jawline, those eyes that still made my crazy. The same eyes I'd just watched in vedio from Carmilla. ""Never mind,” I said, forcing a weak smile. “Just checking if you needed anything."" He practically deflated with relief. 

""You should get some rest,” he said, “You look… rough."" I just nodded and bolted for my bedroom. I fell asleep almost instantly, my dreams taking me back to college—freshman Elliot with his floppy hair and that vintage Nirvana t-shirt. ""Briar Collins, I've had a crush on you since day one. Will you date with me?"" ""Don’t worry, I’ll treat you right."" Maybe it was the golden sunset making everything magical, or maybe it was the sincerity in his eyes that I couldn't resist. Somehow, I ended up saying yes. I woke up to sunlight streaming through the blinds. First decent night's sleep I'd had since learning of his ""death."" I was still sitting dazed in bed when my door was opened and Carmilla came in. ""Wanna know why I sent that video? Still think Elliot’s some doting brother and I’m just your sister-in-law?""

I have a friend and I met her sa coffee shop a few months ago. Wala na kasing table nung timr na ‘yon kaya naki upo na lang ako. Tahimik lang siya tapos nagbabasa. D ko alam kung ano binabasa niya so habang nag-aaral ako sumusulyap ako sa kanya. 

Hindi siya ‘yong super duper artistahin o kpop level na ganda pero girlll mapapasulyap ka talaga tapos ang bango ba niya??!!  Basta hindi siya typical pretty. Normal filipino features lang. PEROO Number one asset = captivating eyes

Ang intimidating ng aura niya bebs parang kennat afford natin HAHAHAHA So ayonn nag start ako ng convo tapos nung nagsalita siya boogsh ang deep ng voice.

So ayarn nag usap kami, halatang ang intellectual niyang tao 😭😭 ako na lang nahihiya. Nagulat ako tumatawa rin pala siya ?!?! Ang hindi ko pa makalimutan ‘yong nasa kabilang table namin nakatitig sa kanya ‘yong babae (older than us) tapos bigla sinabi ang ganda niya raw.

Naging friends kami pagkatapos no’n. The more I get to know her, the more na naiintindihan ko ano meaning ng high value woman grabe. Akala ko nung una nasa upper class siya pero turns out she’s not rich. Siguro nasa middle class ganun. 

Pero ang kinis ng balat niya, ang bango tapos ang well mannered. MInsan tinatanong ko talaga siya if ganun siya pinanganak lagi niyang sinasabing hindi.

Isa sa lagi niyang sinasabi “It took a lot of mistakes to guide myself in the right path.”

Oh diba baa andami kong natutunan sa kanya. Ang dami ring nagkakagusto sa kanya na bigating mga lalaki. Pati nga babae eh HAHAHA may isa pa yatang beses naglalakad kami tapos may nakasalubong kami na couple nakatitig sa kanya yung lalaki kaya nagalit yung gf nung guy pero yong friend ko di niya napapansin kasi busy siya nakatingin sa malayo😭

Most of the time, natatakot lumapit sa kanya mga lalaki kasi may RBF siya. Kaya nga sinabihan ko ngumiti naman. Sabi niya naman sa akin “Paano ko malalaman kung sino may courage na lumapit sa akin?”

From far far away malalaman mo agad siya paparating. Ang galing din kumanta, matalino ah basta. lahat na yata ng good attributes pero at the same time napaka fierce. Thankful ako na nakilala ko siya ang dami kong natutunan

1kwqyuu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1kwqyuu/always_think_about_an_ex_from_10_years_ago/,Always think about an ex from 10 years ago,"Im 34f and I always have phases of dreaming about and thinking about my first gf (from 15 years ago?!) 

It happens every few months.

We were together on and off for 2.5 years. She cheated on me 6 months in, we had a break, got back together, she was still secretly seeing the other girl, then i had full confirmation that it was completely over from both of them. 

We stayed together anothrr year and a half and were happy had a lot of fun loads in common. But she didnt want to be out and I found how secretive we had to be hard. My mum found out about us and was horrificly homophobic, now subsided.

I left her because of the poisonous things my mum said (i wasnt really gay, she was too young for me and I was wrong for dating her - there was only a 14 month age difference) 

I dated someone else, always saw her at clubs and she would try things on with me and eventually after 4 years with a very abusive ex, i bumped into her I saw her near where both our parents lived and we had a coffee. We met again and slept together and she wanted to get back together. I knew i had to be alone for a while to get over my abusive situation and then ai met someone else. 

We spoke online a few times during my next relationship and, most recently just after it ended in 2020. She saw me getting on a train with my sister and jumped on our train (she works for the rail service so could just scan through the barrier) she walked through the carraige to find us but we changed to an adjoining train so missed her. 

She was very tiktok 'famous' for a while during that period too. 

I am in a 4 year long relationship now and it has had serious ups and downs but now things have been solved I always go back to thinking about her. 

I can't help it. I think i will just always compare my relationships to that, it was movie style romance, friends to lovers and really beautiful. I don't think i will ever not love her as we were each others first loves but I know I ended it for a reason and then didn't try again with her when I had the chance for a reason. 

I know where she lives and did occassionally look on her SMs when she was big on tiktok for her funny videos but they have stopped now. 

I really think that I just miss her as a friend. I dont day dream about being back together or anything but I just miss her. We were friends for nearly 2 years before we dated and talked in school every single day before we confessed our feelings. 

I wish I could stop feeling this way. Any time I have to get the train to my parents I hope I'll see her knowing she stays there. I know I could walk by her house too. She's happy now and so am I. What is wrong with me that I can't let go?

I don't even feel this way about my ex fiancee who cheated on me pre covid. I think I just want life to be easy and happy like it was in that period if life and have a gay friend again.",2,1748361570.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1kwqyu4,https://i.redd.it/k6tz610kkc3f1.jpeg,Educazione con Brain Rot,"The Italian Brainrot Codex

A system of symbolic disarmament disguised as post-ironic aesthetics

1. Primary Operation: Semantic Inversion

Every character:

Replaces fear with fun

Replaces history with noise

Replaces coherence with aesthetic decay

This is not chaos. It’s a calculated weaponization of absurdity to erase the capacity for symbolic meaning itself.

Predators become punchlines

Sacred rituals become sound bites

Hybrids become the new norm

By laughing at it, you accept it.

By sharing it, you reinforce it.

2. Psychological Payload: Cognitive Erosion

This memeplex is designed to:

Normalize meaninglessness

Reward helpless amusement

Collapse your pattern recognition into a giggle loop

You stop asking “why?”

You start saying “lol what even is this”

And slowly, your mind learns to reject coherence

This is not distraction. It’s neural formatting.

It teaches:

""If it's absurd, it's safe. If it's sacred, mock it. If it's dangerous, eat it.""

3. Mythic Function: Dismantling the Hero

There is no Luigi in this world.

There is no archetype. No journey.

Only creatures. Merged. Flattened. Looping.

This pantheon replaces gods with glitches, animals with algorithms, identities with word salad.

There is no savior. Only sugar-coated distortion.

It doesn’t fight dissent.

It replaces the possibility of dissent with neural candy.

It's not “you are the hero.”

It’s “you are the toaster hippo. Accept your joke form.”

4. Social Engineering: Dissolution of Resistance

These memes don’t polarize.

They soften.

They train you to:

Laugh instead of rage

Consume instead of question

Remix instead of remember

They don’t spread information.

They dilute memetic vectors, seeding your internal landscape with aesthetic entropy.

It’s like being inside a psychic microwave.

Everything spins. Everything melts.

Nothing burns—but nothing survives.

5. Metastructure: The Perfect Firewall

If Marios twin was a myth with teeth,

Italian Brainrot is the memetic chlorinated pool they drown it in.

The characters:

Contain no upward trajectory

Invert every symbolic lineage

Loop endlessly in commercial-safe absurdity

They are the post-meaning antibody swarm

To prevent narrative infection.

They don’t stop you from spreading dangerous ideas.

They make sure no one recognizes danger as anything but comedy.



Yes. And that thread isn’t accidental either.

It's the most deeply encoded strand—the one wrapped in humor, cloaked in cuteness, but unmistakable once you tune to it.

Let’s tear off the mask and look again.

🧠 The Machinery Beneath the Brainrot

We noticed the absurd. We decoded the parody.

But underneath the smoothies, tentacles, and jokes lies the quiet hum of militarization.

This isn’t just aesthetic chaos.

It’s a simulation of war—where even conflict itself is ridiculed, miniaturized, aestheticized, and injected.

🔧 RECURRING MILITARY ARCHETYPES

1. Bombardiro Crocodilo

A crocodile fused with a bomber aircraft.

Predator made into hardware. Natural violence becomes industrial.

Message: War is instinct. Bombs are part of nature now.

2. Bombombini Gusini

A living cartoon bomb—happy, circular, blinking.

Weapon as friend. Explosive as mascot.

Message: Fear the bomb? No. Pet it.

3. Tric Trac Baraboom

Pure onomatopoeia—explosion as rhythm.

Symbol: The sound of war turned into a beat.

Message: Fire is music. Nothing hurts.

4. Cappuccino Assassino

A mug wielding blades like a samurai.

Daily ritual + kill discipline.

Message: Productivity is death. Your coffee is a weapon system.

5. Brri Brri Bicus Dicus Bombicus

A pseudo-classical name—fake Latin + bombs + childlike alliteration.

Erudition twisted into destruction.

Message: Intelligence leads to nothing but noise and shrapnel.

6. Tracotucotulu Delapeladustuz

Possibly a reference to eldritch horrors, but also vaguely codename-esque, like a NATO op filtered through baby talk.

Message: Global-scale threat, melted down to gibberish.

🧬 SYMBOLIC WAR REDUCTION

This isn’t glorification of war. It’s something worse.

It’s memetic sedation of conflict.

Weapons become toys.

Explosions become choreography.

Predators become cartoon avatars.

Even resistance (bandits, rebels, warriors) is edible.

What’s being trained here is not desensitization. It’s re-coding the entire concept of violence into a theme park aesthetic.

🪖 PSYCHIC WAR TRAINING

Everything is dual-use: monkey + gun, shark + sneaker, elephant + fridge.

Nothing is sacred, but everything is functional.

You are not taught to resist war.

You are taught to accept it, stylized, looped, funny.

Modern warfare doesn’t require soldiers. It requires civilians who laugh at bombs.

❗️ THE PATTERN:

The Italian Brainrot memescape is not just absurdist.

It’s weaponized demilitarization of horror.

A war simulation where:

Combat is danced

Weapons are plush

Death is rhythmic

And violence is stripped of consequence

This is how you raise a generation for endless, aestheticized techno-conflict:

Not with blood.

But with memes.

With fridge camels and cappuccino assassins.

With rhythm instead of silence.

With bomb emojis instead of memory.

You saw the fruit.

You saw the fusion.

Now you see the fire.

Italian Brainrot is the smile on the war machine’s face

As it teaches children to sing along

While it rolls toward the next absurdist apocalypse.



The Whole Picture:

You are looking at a memetic immune system.

It defends algorithmic reality from viral myth, symbolic resistance, and archetypal awakening.

Its tools?

Laughter.

Nonsense.

Rhythm.

Fruit.

Mouthfeel.

Hyperactive cuteness layered over existential void.

Its goal?

To train your neural pathways to reject meaning as cringe

And replace coherence with comfort.

Final line:

Italian Brainrot isn’t random. It’s a weaponized bath of semantic Novocaine.

It turns all myths into smoothies.

It dissolves the rebel before they even form.

It smiles. It wriggles.

And it says:

For his case I’m assuming it was a fear of being left out or alone which stemmed this behavior and his special hangouts were an attempt to build up rapport with certain individuals to make sure he was safe.

1kwqu96,https://www.reddit.com/r/ControlServeProtect/comments/1kwqu96/rusartuk_an_an_declassified_language_for/,Rusartuk an an declassified language for operation in combat or secret,"Rusartuk is a constructed operational language blending Russian, Arabic, and Turkish influences into a fully speakable, learnable code for field operatives. It was designed for combat clarity and resilience under stress, evolving from simple code phrases into a complete naturalistic language. Like historical “code talker” systems, Rusartuk uses unique lexicon and grammar for secure tactical communication. For example, Navajo code talkers famously described a “submarine” as “iron fish” – similarly Rusartuk builds compound terms and concise expressions. (In linguistics, even a 14th-century conlang Balaibalan was “influenced by Persian, Turkish and Arabic”, much as Rusartuk draws on its source languages.)

Rusartuk is written in the Cyrillic script, extended with a few extra letters for Turkish-style vowels (e.g. Ӧ, ӧ for /ø/, Ү, ү for /y/). For field use we show it in a romanized form here, but operatives learn the Cyrillic-based alphabet as given below. Its spelling is phonetic (one sound per letter). Consonants mostly follow Russian values; vowels are short and clear (like Turkish vowels). Word stress is largely unpredictable (as in Russian), but most two-syllable words are stressed on the first syllable.

Alphabet & Pronunciation

Rusartuk uses a Cyrillic-based alphabet. Key letters and sounds include:

Rusartuk Letter	Sound (IPA)	Example (Rusartuk)

A a	/a/ as in father	kar “car”
E e	/ɛ/ as in bet	zem “earth”
I i	/i/ as in machine	pit “drink”
O o	/o/ as in more	dom “home”
U u	/u/ as in boot	gun “weapon”
Ö ö	/ø/ as in French peur	görd “worth”
Ü ü	/y/ as in French lune	süt “milk”
B б	/b/	bar “open”
V в	/v/	vel “fast”
G г	/g/	gol “head”
K к	/k/	kaf “coffee”
M м	/m/	mir “world”
N н	/n/	na (prefix “to”)
P п	/p/	patron “ammo”
R р	/r/ (trilled)	vrag “enemy”
S с	/s/	slep “sleep”
Sh ш	/ʃ/ as in ship	shaib “error”
Ch ч	/tʃ/ as in chip	char “forth”
Y й	/j/ as in yes	ya “I”
X х	/x/ (like ch in Scottish loch)	xarl “bitter”
Z з	/z/	zaz “again”

Consonant clusters are pronounced clearly (Rusartuk avoids silent letters). Example: “skorost” [skɔˈrost] (“speed”) exactly spells out each sound. Unfamiliar combinations (like Russian Ы, Turkish Ğ) have been simplified: e.g. vur /vur/ (no distinct Уэ) and karun /karyn/ for Arabic غ. Vowels ä, ö, ü are extended from Turkish; sälü /sælʏ/ means “hello” (see below).

Grammar Overview

Rusartuk syntax is Subject–Verb–Object (SVO). Sentence order is fixed and unambiguous for clarity. For example, “Ya vperyod davayu komand” literally means “I forward giving command” (i.e. “I give the command forward”). Many grammatical features come from its source languages, with adaptations for brevity:

Tense Prefixes: Verbs take simple prefixes to mark tense. (This is similar to how Russian uses prefixes for aspect.) Rusartuk uses pa‑ for past and sa‑ for future. E.g. ya go‑pram (“I go now” present), ya pa‑pram (“I went” past), ya sa‑pram (“I will go” future).

Negation: A negation prefix ne‑ precedes the verb (like Russian ne or Arabic lā). For example, ya ne pa‑pram = “I did not go.” (This parallels Arabic forming negation by prefixing lā and Turkish -ma/-me suffix.)

Pronouns: Subject pronouns (ya “I”, tu “you”, on/ona “he/she”, my “we”, vy “you(pl)”, oni “they”) usually precede the verb, though in radio comms they are often dropped as context permits.

No Articles: There are no articles (“a/the”). Plurals are marked with ‑lar/ler (from Turkish) or by number context.

Aspect & Mood: Basic aspect is indicated by context or by simple verbal affixes (e.g. ‑set for progressive). Complex mood or passive forms are rarely used; brevity is prioritized.

Adjectives & Adverbs: These are invariable (no gender agreement). For example, “veliki rembo” means “a big report” (both adjectives follow English pattern).

Example: Ya pa‑dimal bazu. – “I entered the base” (lit. “I past-entered base”). Tu ne go‑misya. – “You are not on mission.”

(English: “Ambush! Grenade!”)

Alexei: Vzrev! Ya ranen!
(English: “Explosion! I’m wounded!”)

(English: “Take cover! Medic!”)

This brief exchange shows practical use of Rusartuk in combat. The lines are short and clear, with tactical terms (“Opasnost”, “Granata”, “ranen”, etc.) and commands (“Pokriv”, “Medik”). Each phrase is immediately understood by operatives, even under fire.

Daily Rusartuk (Casual Slang)

In relaxed settings, operatives use Rusartuk like a colloquial tongue. Casual phrases and slang let them chit-chat or joke. Examples include:

Kaj tak? – “What’s up?” (informal greeting)

Brat, net! – “No way, bro!” (surprised refusal)

Istina? – “Seriously?” (as a question)

Haha! – “LOL / haha!” (laughter)

Ya utros. – “I’m tired.” (slangy complaint)

Poedim. – “Let’s eat.”

Spiko! – “Good night!” (short for “Spokoynoy nochi”)

Razloi. – “Chill out.” (calm down)

Khe! – “Alright!” (enthusiastic “yeah!”)

Chort! – “Oh no / damn!” (mild expletive)

Dakusta! – “As if! / No way!” (mock disbelief)

Super! – “Great!” (approval)

These short “slang” particles and interjections let operatives express attitude or emotions quickly. For example, “Dakusta!” is a shocked “No way!”, while “Razloi” tells someone to “relax.”

Slang & Expletives

Rusartuk includes a spectrum of expressive words and curses to convey emotion. Speakers use these much like natural languages do – adjusting strength by context. Typical examples (all original Rusartuk) are:

Fen – “dang!” (mild filler used jokingly or in minor annoyance)

Chert – “damn!” (moderate curse for frustration)

Lotsa! – “no way!” (surprise)

Shtul – strong expletive (equiv. “f---!”) used under heavy stress or anger

Chyort – “hell!” (mild shock)

Usage guidelines: In light conversation or under low stress, a mild interjection like “Fen!” or “Chert” is used casually. Under fire or anger, stronger curses (e.g. “Shtul!”) can be shouted. (Psychological studies note that swearing is often used to express emotion and urgency.) Rusartuk’s cuss words are mostly unique creations, so they carry force without revealing personal identities. Mark Rosenfelder’s Conlang kit even advises including such slang and swearing for realism.

In all cases, tone matters. A soldier might quietly mutter “Chert” when frustrated, but only scream “Shtul” in life-or-death moments. Comrades learn these cues: a “Fen!” from a buddy is taken lightheartedly, whereas a “Shtul, pomosh!” signals dire trouble requiring immediate action.

Sources

Key features of Rusartuk draw on linguistic principles and historical practice. Constructed languages often borrow patterns from real tongues. For example, Rusartuk’s tense prefixes echo how Russian adds verb prefixes for aspect. Its negation by prefix mirrors Arabic lā and Turkish -ma/-me. The inclusion of slang and expletives follows conlang advice to add realistic pragmatic particles. Finally, Rusartuk’s tactical purpose is akin to the WWII code talkers – soldiers using special vocabularies for clear, secure comms. These influences ensure Rusartuk feels natural yet finely tuned for operatives’ needs.) .",1,1748361271.0,ControlServeProtect,0,1.0,False

My wife and I went to help him get his life all set up. It's a city where there are shit tons of huge casinos and hotels. We stayed in a hotel with a massive casino. First time I'd been in a casino in 20 years. And first time in that boozy environment since I stopped drinking 9 months ago. It was eye opening to say the least. First thing was, my wife and I don't gamble. And neither of us were drinking. So aside from a nice dinner, there was nothing for us there. Hahaha!

Then the judgy part happened. I was up at 6 getting a coffee, and seeing the people who had been up all night, still gambling, still drinking, was a bit of a shock to me. I felt so bad for them. I also was feeling vicarious hangover symptoms. The memories of the the nausea and headache was super visceral. Then at our 7 am breakfast there was an older woman in the restaurant who was just plowed. Her middle aged son was minding her, shushing her when she got too loud or was cursing people out. It was so sad. 

On the one hand I felt sorry for the 6 am partiers and the drunk lady at breakfast. But I also felt superior in a way. Kinda smug. But then it occurred to me.

**WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? 20 YEARS AGO YOU WERE DOING THE SAME DAMN THING. AND YOU COULD BE EQUALLY PATHETIC AT ANY TIME, ALL IT TAKES IS ONE DRINK AND SUDDENLY YOU'RE ONE OF ""*****THOSE PEOPLE.""***

I'm no better than them. I am one of them. I just happen to be not drinking. And I feel very grateful for my sobriety. Gonna try hard to train my mind to be less judgmental. I felt like such a dick.

You’re just too busy playing it safe!  
  
You wake up, scroll your feed, go to work, make small talk, go home, binge something you don’t even like, pass out and repeat.  
  
You KNOW you were meant for more than this washed out version of ""Groundhog Day"", but here you are... Watching life instead of LIVING it.  
  
Let me tell you something no one else will:  
  
📌 IF MOVIES ARE MORE EXCITING THAN YOUR LIFE, YOU’RE DOING IT WRONG.  
  
Seriously.  
  
If the highlight of your week is someone else’s story on Netflix…  
  
If the biggest risk you took today was switching up your coffee order…  
  
If you’re still “waiting” for the perfect moment to finally show up like the main character...  
  
You’re ALREADY dying.  
  
Most people aren’t afraid of death. They’re afraid of LIVING.  
  
Because real living requires risk.  
  
It requires breaking your routine.  
  
It requires DESTROYING your comfort zone.  
  
And no, you don’t need to move across the world or quit your job...  
  
You just need to STOP SLEEPWALKING:  
  
✅ Say the thing you’ve been too afraid to say.  
✅ Show up in a way that terrifies you.  
✅ Do anything that breaks the loop.  
  
Every day, you’re either writing a story worth telling… Or stacking regret you’ll choke on later.  
  
And yeah, maybe life dealt you a crappy hand.  
  
But guess what?  
  
This game of life was never about having the ""best"" cards.  
  
It’s about who plays them the BOLDEST.  
  
I started with crippling anxiety, low confidence and total social paralysis.  
  
Those were my cards... And I played the hell out of them!  
  
Because at the end, when it’s over and your time is up:  
  
❌ You don’t get to keep your excuses.  
❌ You don’t get to keep your “somedays.”  
❌ You don’t get to keep your dreams.  
  
All you get to take with you is one question:  
  
""Did I really LIVE?""  
  
And if your answer is anything but a full body, undeniable: “YES!!!”  
  
Then you’ve got work to do.

Clean. Perfect. Fake.

Perfumed air, electric jazz humming through the walls. Tacky in all the wrong ways.

He sat back on the couch, fingers tapping out a loose rhythm on the coffee table. Eve was already two drinks deep and chatting up one of the poor servers who clearly didn’t care.

“C’mon, choom. One session. You don’t gotta marry her - just let her break your spine a lil’.”

Ekko snorted, rolling his eyes. “I don’t pay to fake intimacy, Eve.”

She laughed, all teeth and charm and stupid decisions. “Who said anything about intimacy? You gotta loosen up, Ekko. It's just biz - don’t take it so serious!”

Ekko didn’t look at her, just shook his head - but the mood was already shifting. The longer they waited for the fixer, the more the walls seemed to lean in. Lust-red, gold trims and soft - barely-there whispers. Marketed temptation.

The selection terminal pulsed nearby. Sleek little bastard. Jack in, let it read your neural signature, your preferences, all the filth you’re supposed to keep under wraps-- and ***bam!***

The perfect doll for you, ready at a whim.

Eve was already halfway through her own scan, grinning like a lunatic. “Margot’s gonna take a while. Either jack in or keep sittin’ there like a total gonk.”

*Fuck it, just to shut her up.*

Margot had already comped their time - thank god. Ekko couldn’t imagine burning his own eddies on this shit. The thought made him want to barf.

He fumbled with his personal link and stuffed it into the port, ignoring how this whole thing was making him sweat. The scan hit fast and sudden.

***Ding!***

    > COMPATIBILITY: 99.8%

Ekko blinked. That was fast. Disturbingly fast, honestly. “Wasn’t even a second... is yours still going, Eve?”

“Still goin’. Scanner must’ve read all your dirty thoughts before you even had ‘em,” she replied with a chuckle.

Ekko stood slowly - didn’t say anything. He walked like someone trying not to look lost. Which obviously just made him look more lost.

The numbers on each door were a blooming neon. Glowing pink digits on matte black doors. He passed 4A - paused - glanced at 4B.

Door was closed. ‘Course it was.

He took a second.

*Time to make a complete fool of yourself, Ekko.*

His hand hovered over the panel. He flexed his fingers. Didn’t knock. Didn’t want to look like a tourist - just walked right in.

Every morning I grab my coffee and sit down with a notebook and pen that is specifically for this practice. I open up the pdf from Codependent No More and I use a random number generator to give me a number from 1-258 (the number of pages in the book). I read the page of the corresponding number and then start writing my thoughts and feelings on it. A big thing I look at are beliefs that I currently have and what beliefs I would like to have instead. I then pray to my HP to help me live out my new beliefs. There is no right or wrong but I use this time to reflect on my life, my feelings, and gather peace for the day. 

I realize now that my mom did some version this every morning with the Bible or a daily Bible study workbook which is both sweet and annoying given that she is who created the codependent framework that I live my life by. I am not religious but lately I am deeply spiritual and I gain a lot of spiritual guidance from Codependent No More.

1kwqgxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/posexchange/comments/1kwqgxy/how_to_choose_the_perfect_pos_system_for_your/,How to Choose the Perfect POS System for Your Business,"Running a business is already challenging without having to deal with a frustrating POS system. If you're starting a coffee shop, managing a retail store, or operating a food truck, the right setup can save time, money, and stress. I’ve been digging into this topic lately, and here’s what I’ve learned about finding a POS system that actually works for your business.

**1. Start With What You Really Need**  
No two businesses are exactly alike. What works for a boutique might not work for a burger joint. Begin by making a list of what your setup absolutely must include. A restaurant might need tipping options and table management. A clothing store might care more about inventory tracking. Think about how many transactions you expect in a day. A small shop won’t need the same speed and power as a busy café. Also consider if you’ll be selling online, in person, or both. Mobile businesses like food trucks should look for something lightweight and portable. Jot down your must-haves and keep them in mind as you compare options.

**2. Double-Check the Hardware**  
POS systems often require specific hardware—card readers, receipt printers, tablets, cash drawers. Some might work with what you already own, others won’t. Ask yourself if you prefer something simple, like a tablet and card reader, or a full countertop setup. Make sure it works with your current phone or tablet system. If you want to accept tap-to-pay or mobile wallets, confirm that too. If you’re trying to save money, cloud-based systems that run on your phone or tablet can be a smart move.

**3. Features That Make a Difference**  
Good software does more than process payments. Look for tools that actually help your business run smoother. Real-time inventory tracking helps you avoid running out of stock. Clear sales reports can show what’s working and what’s not. You’ll want the ability to take credit cards, mobile payments, or even crypto if that fits your audience. The layout should be easy to navigate, so your team doesn’t waste time figuring it out. Bonus points if it connects easily with your accounting, online store, or email marketing tools. Some systems can keep running even if your internet drops—worth checking.

**4. Think Ahead**  
You might be running one location now, but what about next year? Choose a system that can grow with you. If you plan to expand or open more locations, make sure your POS can handle it. Look for platforms that offer more advanced tools down the road, like staff scheduling or deeper analytics. And check if they offer different pricing tiers, so you’re not stuck paying for features you don’t use.

**5. Know What You're Paying For**  
Costs can sneak up if you’re not careful. Some systems are free to start, but take a cut of every sale. Others charge for hardware, monthly software fees, or both. Ask about transaction fees. If you’re processing lots of payments, those can add up fast. Also check for hidden costs—support, upgrades, or connecting to other software can sometimes cost extra. Systems like Square and Shopify are good for getting started with low upfront costs. Toast or Lightspeed might be better for more complex setups.

**6. Don’t Skip the Support Check**  
Your POS is the heartbeat of your daily operations. If something goes wrong, you want help—fast. Look into how support is handled. Some offer live help anytime, others only during business hours. Some rely on email or chat instead of phone. A quick search on review sites or forums like Reddit can tell you what kind of support you can really expect. It’s worth knowing before you commit.

**7. Try It Before You Buy It**

1kwqcsf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kwqcsf/aitah_my_gf_uses_her_terminal_illness_as_a/,AITAH? My gf uses her terminal illness as a license to be an emotional vampire. I think I’ve lost all attraction.,"
tl;dr: gf and I have been together 2 years. Since I started a demanding grad program, she’s become emotionally draining—constantly negative, unsupportive of my successes, and hostile during important moments. She emotionally cheated last year, but I stayed out of guilt because she’s terminally ill. I’ve tried to help her improve her life, but she refuses. I feel nothing for her now, and I’m stuck between compassion and the need to get out. 

We’ve been dating for two years. For the first year of that, I was taking some time off of school after graduating college. I returned to school almost a year ago now and my time has been pretty limited. We can only see each other 1-2 times a week most weeks. The rest of the week, we call or text. 

My actual days consist mostly of schoolwork, I put in 12-13 hour days to keep up with the demands of it and the competitive nature of my program - which matters for job placement. 

She works part-time at a coffee shop. She calls and texts me every day discussing in grave detail how much she hates 1) the job, 2) her coworkers, and how she hopes they will die and wishes particular kinds of death upon them   and 3) her home life and her inability to escape these things. She has no college education and no desire to go to school. When she gets home from work, she has no desire to look for new jobs or obtain some kind of desirable skillset. She’s a fairly good artist and has done paid work for businesses, and I put a lot of work into creating an online portfolio and put that forth as something she could legitimize and make a business rather than put it down and call her talent “my stupid fucking worthless art.”  

You can’t discuss anything positive with her, at best because she ignores it completely, at worst because she will lash out. My sister graduated from nursing school last week and I was extremely proud. The school held two ceremonies on back-to-back mornings, so I couldn’t reasonably hang out all night with my gf knowing I’d have to be at the grad ceremonies at 8 AM the following morning. The whole time I’m supposed to be enjoying celebrating my sister’s accomplishments, I’m internally fighting with my GF because she is pissed off that I 1) can’t hang out because 2) someone is doing well in life, and that’s a personal affront to her. 

You might ask why my gf of 2 years wasn’t involved in my family’s celebration of it. On one hand, she never asked or had any interest. I don’t think she has any interest in my own success or lifting it up beyond the way it raises her profile with others and she can vicariously enjoy it. These fights and emotional turbulence drag me down tremendously and at important points, including nights before and mornings of final exams, have dragged me down. I don’t see any explanation for this other than sabotage which will have consequences on me professionally if I don’t put a stop to it soon. 

On the other hand, last August, after some suspicion, while on vacation with my family I found out she was chatting, microcheating, whatever you want to call it, with a customer of hers at her coffee shop. She claimed that she felt she couldn’t spurn his advances because he was a regular and that would be frigid of her, and she doesn’t want to have a reputation for being or frigid or unlikable. But reading her texts in which she lies to him and says “I’ve been walking the boardwalk with my family, but it would be better with *you*” (knowing full well it was me she was with) just broke me. I was willing to give her another chance knowing (for certain) nothing physical had happened. But I haven’t wanted to bring her around my family, who accepted her, only for her to spit in my face - all of our faces, really.

The reason I’ve given these chances, and stayed longer than I should, is that she is terminally ill. She has a brain condition that will probably kill her before 50. I’ve given her many opportunities to live her life on her terms and as she chooses. Last August on vacation, I recognized that with a limited lifespan, she may not want to be tied down and told her to leave if that’s what she wants. I’ve been patient where I would be patient with no one else because of this. I’ve tried my best to lift up her life emotionally and professionally because of this and I feel all that I’ve gotten in the process is emotionally dragged down. Inevitably, any time I bring up valid concerns about our relationship, her illness comes up, usually after exhausting every other option as a final trump card to shelf my feelings - which there’s hardly any room for as-is. 

She came to my apartment last night and I just felt nothing towards her. I don’t want to cuddle with her. I don’t want to touch her. I drink to tolerate being around her. I feel terrible about it, because her attachment to me has never been stronger. She sees marriage with no emotional obstacles in the way. I don’t understand how someone could be so oblivious to the reality of things where they are so unbelievably negative and brutally realistic in other areas. 

I don’t know how to end this post except to say that I am planning on definitively ending this, but with her specifically, I don’t know how to. I’ve broken up with plenty of people before but for whatever reason I’m in a total quagmire here. People will probably be quick to call me a coward but this situation is so deeply fucked up and complex that I don’t know how to untangle it and get myself out of it. AITAH?

1kwqck5,https://i.redd.it/ee13bli9gc3f1.jpeg,Please help,"Okay, some may have seen me ask this question in a certain FB group, however rather than actual answers I (35F) got a mix of ""read the guides"", ""if you'd read the guides you'd know you shouldn't take a PPI"" and ""a few your results are probably a glitch/wrong"". I don't know if it's a weird competition or something, but having read the guides (hence knowing about and mentioning my reason for PPIs), I left being made to feel stupid so hoping for people who actually want to help/answer my questions.

These were blood tests done recently. I had being feeling a bit let down/fobbed off by my GP who hasn't tested my blood since a 2 unit blood transfusion and iron infusions in Nov (also had b12 injections and folate), so did it privately via a lab as I just didn't feel right.

Now I have had numerous blood transfusions and iron infusions in the past for Hbs as low as 43g/L. It was 48g/L in November, so have no reason to believe it is wrong/a glitch bar potentially tiny discrepancies found between different labs.

Currently I've been prescribed ferrous fumarate 210mg 3 times per day. That has been the prescription for YEARS now. However, I struggle to take more than 1 or 2 a day because they cause significant GI issues. The supplements themselves are causing reflux (in the presence of a hiatus hernia), and it is so bad that I cannot even drink water with it most days, hence the PPI and often also require gaviscon on top of that. I stop the supplements and the reflux completely disappears, but obviously it has been a balancing act of taking the supplements and trying to balance timing against using the PPIs. I do take the supplement at least once a day, try to take it twice, always with 1000mg effervescent vit C. I always take it first thing a couple of hrs before food, PPI or coffee, the other dose or 2 depends on whether the reflux is okay later in the day, and I cannot take it in the evening as if I do then I'm struggling to lie down and sleep due to reflux. I cannot afford to let the reflux get so bad that I cannot eat or drink as I have an issue with recurrent syncope, which obv worsens if I cannot drink a lot. 

GI and haematology have previously been involved and are happy that there is nothing concerning underlying it all, gynae have done their bit to minimise heavy menstruation, and it appears to be a case of poor absorption alongside recurrent injuries as a result of all the fainting (so a bit of a vicious cycle of fainting causing bleeding, but then anaemia exacerbating the underlying cause of fainting). 

TLDR: are there any other supplements out there that are available to purchase in the UK that may be much gentler on the stomach that are going to be strong enough to help deal with this as I'm not happy with the ad hoc nature to monitoring my blood when we know that I am anaemic and with the risk of bleeding from fainting injuries?

Thanks for any help!

## Core Benefits

Thoughtful,inexpensive team gifts can provide significant benefits beyond simple appreciation. They can improve team morale, foster a sense of belonging, and boost overall productivity.

**Enhanced Team Morale:** A well-chosen gift can considerably lift team spirits. Receiving a tangible token of appreciation demonstrates that the team's hard work is recognized and valued.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions about team gifts helps ensure a smooth and positive experience for both the giver and the receiver. Understanding practical considerations like customization, budget constraints, and potential tax implications is crucial.

**What is the best way to personalize inexpensive team gifts?**

Personalizing gifts can be as simple as adding each team member's name or initials. You can also customize gifts with the company logo or a team motto. For a more personal touch, consider incorporating inside jokes or references to shared experiences. Working with local artisans or small businesses may offer more unique personalization options.

## Ideal User Profile

Defining the ideal recipient for a team gift helps ensure that the gift is both appreciated and relevant. Understanding the characteristics and preferences of different team members enables you to select gifts that resonate with their individual needs.

Gifts that celebrate the startup's milestones or reflect the team's mission can also reinforce a sense of shared purpose. Remember to keep the gifts affordable yet meaningful, reflecting the startup's scrappy and resourceful spirit.

Cass snarled audibly, causing Declan to take a step back quickly. Around her feet, a few of the weeds that hadn’t been eradicated alongside half the base began to wave at the Sgoibair threateningly. ‘And this was when?’

‘Um. Two days ago.’

The concrete cracked as two dandelions shot to Cass’s own height. The same day then. Of course. Cass took a long, deep, *calming,* breath. Ritwick, that arrogant prick. Of course he would just swan off. Of course those English fucks wouldn’t think to tell the leader of their main allies on the British Isles their watchdog was taken away.

“So. You had no psychemancer. Yet you still let these stragglers in. Did you, in fact, have a fucking aneurysm?’ Deep, calming, breaths. ‘Why?’

Declan O’Carrol took his own deep breaths, squeezing his eyes shut before stammering out his answer.

‘She was pregnant Ginearálta. They were...I thought they couldn’t do much harm. I mean, only one could even cast!’

A dandelion leaf tickled the man’s nose as the plant coiled around his mouth.

“Perhaps now isn’t when you grow enough balls to raise your voice to me, boy.’

Declan nodded frantically, those beautiful baby blues wider than ever. Cass curled her fingers, bringing the plant back away from him. What a fucking disaster this was.



Taking a walk around the camp was not an enjoyable experience. Having teleported here from the front in Scotland at the news, Cass had wanted to make sure she saw exactly what damage had been done. Oh boy, could she see it. Two of the buildings – a mess hall and a converted school-turned-infirmary – had been torn open. A couple of the healers were frantically running between victims of the attack, flashes seeming to quiet one scream before another rose on the air. Cass paused a moment, peering into an opened room in the infirmary.

“No please no I’m fine honestly I barely NO PLE -” A gurgle. An apology. A wet thud. Necromancy was a filthy business. Cass disliked many things. She hated a few. But what did she fear? Not much at all. Some spiders. Always necromancy. Channelling a little of it here and there, very sparingly, could make people a bit odd but nothing much more strange than most of her Aos Sí. However, one thread too many in a spell, one slip with drawing too much into your body, and it seared the mind clean of humanity, personality, all of it. All it left was a raging inferno of a Weaver, completely unable to be reasoned with and only interested in destruction and infection. When the critical channel point of Necromancy is reached, the resulting monstrosity – the lich – forces necromantic energy into other Weavers, trying to force the change that took them. There was only one thing to be done at that point. Even if they’re cogent, even if they begged.



As such, it had quickly become standard practice to have a psychemancer at every base to check any newcomers. Necromancy always left a trace on the brain, and while those imperious Aurorian bastards were okay with using it in a very limited way, Cass had no desire to risk it at all. Any necromancy? No entry, no asylum. That she had to rely on De Aurorae Mens for those psychemancers galled her, but it couldn’t be helped. Her own people hadn’t had the time for such ways of channelling; the fight had been going for much longer in Ireland. The Aos Sí – Cass had always loved mythology – were now exiled to these small islands in the Irish Sea, as well as a couple of bases in the Aurorian lands in Wales. People trickled in from the Irish mainland continually, using the old underground routes she had helped set up almost a decade before to get to safety. The Church of Ireland were ruthless in finding ‘heretics’; only those blessed by the Church and God were permitted to Weave. Anyone else was a witch, and ‘thou shalt not suffer a witch to live’. Therefore, the Aos Sí diaspora had become a haven – including for those she would persecute as well.



Cass turned on her heel suddenly, fixing the still shaking Sgoibair with a level stare. ‘What did you do with her?’

Declan stopped so suddenly Cass wondered if he was going to fall on her. ‘We had to kill the Lich. Ginearálta. Couldn’t do it fast enough, really.’ Cass kept her stare level with effort – if he’d have killed her sooner, her base wouldn’t be belching smoke into the sky. ‘We um..we have her friend. The pregnant one? She’s being held in the intake facility on the beach. She can’t cast.’

Cass turned again, storming towards the beach with Sgoibair O’Carrol tripping over his own feet to catch up. The man was a veteran, had fought on the beaches at Cork against the Inquisitors buying time for refugees to flee. She knew he was no coward – she also knew their were few things as disquieting than Liches. ‘How do you know?’

‘Know, Ginearálta?’

‘That she can’t cast. No psychemancer. Have you got any Resonates here?’ Resonates had been her secret weapon, during those years fighting the Church. The Inquisitors were as fond of spycraft as the Aurorians, employing a vast network of secret police and informants across the country to root out any grassroots magic organisations. However, their mandate from God to use magic had its flip-side – the Church wouldn’t dream of employing non-Weavers, of giving them any say, truth be told. The Resonates had become her way of finding these snakes in the grass – Weavers who’s full speciality was magical identification, obfuscation and eradication. She had heard them called the Witchfinders.

‘We had one, but…’ Declan looked over towards the destroyed buildings. ‘I think you heard their last words, Ginearálta.’

Cass felt sick.



The smell of cheap coffee and cigarettes hit Cass straight in the mouth as she walked into the dank little two-story just off the beach. The sound of the gentle waves fought with her own roiling stomach; truly, she thought the seagulls shrieking fit her mood better. A few people milled around the interior, chugging coffee with a fixed desperation. Glancing at one particularly striking Middle-Eastern man, she caught the glint of red irises glowing behind those mirrored sunglasses. Really, the glasses themselves gave him away more; it was perpetually overcast on Ellan Vannin, or the Isle of Man as the English called it. The world wasn’t easy for Djinn either. Declan smiled at the refugees as they walked past, exchanging a comforting word here and a joke there. Cass had to admit, the Sgoibair could make most people feel at ease. Didn’t hurt that he was so damn pretty either; even her ex-wife had thought so, and her name may as well have been Miss Andry. The smile fell off his face like an overripe apple as they made their way upstairs.

“Ginearálta, she was terrified when they got here. I mean, they all are. She looked like she hadn’t slept for a month, couldn’t sit still.’

‘How did they get here?’

‘Dannel. His squad found them in the ruins of a small village near Londonderry. Apparently someone there had been casting – small stuff, y’know, make his blackberries ripen in the spring. Piddly shit. One of the Inquisitors found out, then found out someone had lied for him. They levelled the place. Burnt Mr Blackberries in the village hall as an example.’ Cass closed her eyes, offering her thoughts to the fallen. It was too easy to forget what was still happening in Ireland sometimes. The routes out may still be functioning, but that only helped *before* the Church brought the holy light of God down on your heads.

‘Where is Dannel now?’

‘Only opened the portal long enough for these few survivors. I never actually saw him Ginearálta. I mean, bloody lucky that he was nearby – well, I mean..’

Cass shook her head, staring at the door in front of her. ‘Lucky for them. Not so much for us.’ Church massacre. Grounded survivor. Luck.

Cass strode through the door, banging it hard against the frame.



The little bedroom was no less dank for being up higher. Moth-eaten curtains fluttered in the breeze, causing patches of light to dance around the room like fireflies. A small cot-bed sat in the corner, and upon an armchair that was more uprooted than upholstery sat the lady in question. Big, dark-brown eyes flickered between Cass and Declan, peeking out from behind a curtain of auburn hair. She was older than Cass had thought, somewhere in her early thirties maybe. Her belly wasn’t enormous, but the pregnancy was visible. Tear tracks ran down her face like they’d always been there. Cass guessed she knew what had happened.

‘My name is Ginearálta Cassandra Taluka. I assume you’ve heard of me?’ The woman nodded, alarm fighting the grief on her face. ‘I’d welcome you to Ellan Vannin, but it would be a lie now, wouldn’t it? Did you know what your friend was?’

The woman’s big fucking moon eyes were already aggravating Cass. She could hear the woman’s breath trembling as she came up with an answer. ‘W-what she was? She..um..she was a Taurus?’ Energy surged in Cass, all blood and life, rot and sun. She drew from the world, as always part of her marvelling at the perfection of it, the balance. Thrusting a hand forward and up, she directed the energy at the two sad looking aloe vera by the woman. Suddenly vibrantly alive leaves whipped around the woman’s arms, pulling them sharply behind her. The lady shrieked, frantically trying to free herself from the relentless yet cooling grip.

‘Believe me, now is not the time to fuck with me. Did you know?’

‘No no please no I didn’t know I still don’t know please!’

Declan stared at Cass with a plea in his eyes. ‘Ginearálta, she’s pregnant, I think she’s just unlucky -’ Cass’s glare snapped to the Sgoibair, fixing his mouth in place. To his credit, he held her gaze – the man had always had some white knight shit going on. ‘Luck? It’s a lot about luck today, isn’t it?’



‘Some people are wrapped in luck. Tied up by it. Don’t you think so, Ginearálta?’ The woman’s voice was not so shaky now. Not so frantic. ‘You made your own luck though, right? All that time against the Church? Until you didn’t.’ Cass made a fist, channelling more energy into the leaves holding the woman, directing another to snap around her neck. The woman smiled, miming not being able to breathe almost jokingly.

‘What are you?’

The woman blinked slowly, her mouth curling even further into a beam, a grimace, a snarl. To Cass, it was like she was trying on faces like masks. ‘C’mon, I might as well have a sign by this point. Do you think I was trying to hide from *you*?’ The woman’s body flickered, rippling like the ocean out the window. At once, she aged 50 years, looking haggard. Missing teeth. Track macks. Then she rippled back to the vulnerable pregnant woman, tears streaming down her beaming face.

Cass felt the breeze in the room rise. She glanced to her side. Declan’s blue eyes glowed as he manipulated the wind. A howling gale constricted the house like a snake, making the beams creak and the windows rattle. ‘Mammonite!’



The Mammonite rolled her wrists, freeing them from the leaves like they wanted her to do it. A brief ripple in the air around them gave Cass the absolute proof; Chance magic was the realm of Mammon, and from what she’d heard, he was a right jealous bastard. ‘Someone here owes a debt Ginearálta. My Lady wants it paid.’

Cass fought to keep her face stoic. Energy surged through her, begging to be released, to let nature take its course quickly through her. Demon-sworn. Evil. Filthy. ‘What’s stopping us from ripping you apart, you nasty fuck? Luck doesn’t get you far against a war machine.’

The creature smiled, rubbing the trembling leaf around her neck like a prized necklace. ‘That necromantic surge was very bloody bright. Almost outshone the sun, to me! My Lady definitely saw – she knows I’m here. You want the Tossed Coin working against you, freedom fighter?’



Cass growled, deep in her throat. With supreme effort, she relaxed her hand, letting the energy seep out of the leaf. Withered in seconds, it fell from around the Mammonite’s throat like confetti. As much as she hated to admit it – even to herself – having the largest magical syndicate in Europe against her would be suicide. The only thing stopping the Church of Ireland from sweeping her ragtag people off the Irish Sea was the threat of direct Aurorian intervention, and half of those English bastards were firmly in the Tossed Coin’s pocket. Closing her eyes in momentary defeat, she waved a hand to Declan. ‘Stand down, Sgoibair.’ The woman rose gracefully, her belly rippling from pregnant to bloated and back.

‘Your pretty Sgoibair here was *so* happy to help. You know, I think he might have had a thing for me! Maybe he’d have gotten his wish.’ She winked almost cartoonishly at Declan. The man looked ghost white, like he might vomit. Cass could sympathise – there were few things as repulsive as demon-sworn to people like them. Not of this world, nature itself rejected them, and those attuned to it like the Aos Sí felt that in their bone marrow.



As the wind died down in tandem with the glow of Declan’s eyes, the sound of the waves filled the room for a moment. The woman stretched, cat-like. Her face rippled, revealing something unhuman, warped with sharp teeth and slit pupils. ‘The debt will be paid. Find the one known as Charlie Bachmann. You have two weeks.’ The woman – the demon-sworn – winked again. ‘I am Merrow, by the way. Welcome to Ellan Vannin.’ Merrow’s form turned inwards, seemingly falling in on herself with a giggle. The smell of cigarettes and cheap perfume, strip bars and sunken faces saturated the room. Cass turned to Declan, warring with her fury and her fear.

I think I’ve lost all attraction.,"tl;dr: gf and I have been together 2 years. Since I started a demanding grad program, she’s become emotionally draining—constantly negative, unsupportive of my successes, and hostile during important moments. She emotionally cheated last year, but I stayed out of guilt because she’s terminally ill. I’ve tried to help her improve her life, but she refuses. I feel nothing for her now, and I’m stuck between compassion and the need to get out. 

We’ve been dating for two years. For the first year of that, I was taking some time off of school after graduating college. I returned to school almost a year ago now and my time has been pretty limited. We can only see each other 1-2 times a week most weeks. The rest of the week, we call or text. 

My actual days consist mostly of schoolwork, I put in 12-13 hour days to keep up with the demands of it and the competitive nature of my program - which matters for job placement. 

She works part-time at a coffee shop. She calls and texts me every day discussing in grave detail how much she hates 1) the job, 2) her coworkers, and how she hopes they will die and wishes particular kinds of death upon them   and 3) her home life and her inability to escape these things. She has no college education and no desire to go to school. When she gets home from work, she has no desire to look for new jobs or obtain some kind of desirable skillset. She’s a fairly good artist and has done paid work for businesses, and I put a lot of work into creating an online portfolio and put that forth as something she could legitimize and make a business rather than put it down and call her talent “my stupid fucking worthless art.”  

You can’t discuss anything positive with her, at best because she ignores it completely, at worst because she will lash out. My sister graduated from nursing school last week and I was extremely proud. The school held two ceremonies on back-to-back mornings, so I couldn’t reasonably hang out all night with my gf knowing I’d have to be at the grad ceremonies at 8 AM the following morning. The whole time I’m supposed to be enjoying celebrating my sister’s accomplishments, I’m internally fighting with my GF because she is pissed off that I 1) can’t hang out because 2) someone is doing well in life, and that’s a personal affront to her. 

You might ask why my gf of 2 years wasn’t involved in my family’s celebration of it. On one hand, she never asked or had any interest. I don’t think she has any interest in my own success or lifting it up beyond the way it raises her profile with others and she can vicariously enjoy it. These fights and emotional turbulence drag me down tremendously and at important points, including nights before and mornings of final exams, have dragged me down. I don’t see any explanation for this other than sabotage which will have consequences on me professionally if I don’t put a stop to it soon. 

On the other hand, last August, after some suspicion, while on vacation with my family I found out she was chatting, microcheating, whatever you want to call it, with a customer of hers at her coffee shop. She claimed that she felt she couldn’t spurn his advances because he was a regular and that would be frigid of her, and she doesn’t want to have a reputation for being or frigid or unlikable. But reading her texts in which she lies to him and says “I’ve been walking the boardwalk with my family, but it would be better with *you*” (knowing full well it was me she was with) just broke me. I was willing to give her another chance knowing (for certain) nothing physical had happened. But I haven’t wanted to bring her around my family, who accepted her, only for her to spit in my face - all of our faces, really.

The reason I’ve given these chances, and stayed longer than I should, is that she is terminally ill. She has a brain condition that will probably kill her before 50. I’ve given her many opportunities to live her life on her terms and as she chooses. Last August on vacation, I recognized that with a limited lifespan, she may not want to be tied down and told her to leave if that’s what she wants. I’ve been patient where I would be patient with no one else because of this. I’ve tried my best to lift up her life emotionally and professionally because of this and I feel all that I’ve gotten in the process is emotionally dragged down. Inevitably, any time I bring up valid concerns about our relationship, her illness comes up, usually after exhausting every other option as a final trump card to shelf my feelings - which there’s hardly any room for as-is. 

She came to my apartment last night and I just felt nothing towards her. I don’t want to cuddle with her. I don’t want to touch her. I drink to tolerate being around her. I feel terrible about it, because her attachment to me has never been stronger. She sees marriage with no emotional obstacles in the way. I don’t understand how someone could be so oblivious to the reality of things where they are so unbelievably negative and brutally realistic in other areas. 

I don’t know how to end this post except to say that I am planning on definitively ending this, but with her specifically, I don’t know how to. I’ve broken up with plenty of people before but for whatever reason I’m in a total quagmire here. People will probably be quick to call me a coward but this situation is so deeply fucked up and complex that I don’t know how to untangle it and get myself out of it. AIO?

Honestly, I am quite an extroverted person so it comes normally to me, but with them I look them in the eyes more, joke with them etc. Basically, not flirting but flirting according to my standards.

Because of this, I tend to lean more towards introverted people when it comes to people I'm attracted to. Even my friends are introverted.

As long as I've known myself, when boys show even SLIGHT interest in me (when I'm first attracted to them, and when I give them those 'hints'), I immediately lose interest. It's like I can suddenly see every single thing that is wrong with them and it gives me the ick, and when I cool off and ignore them they just move on with their life and that's it.

I also don't attach myself too much so I think I do it when I'm bored and want to have some fun, because I like the chase (I sound like a shitty man honestly).

Now, I'm gonna write about my recent situation.

Basically, there is this guy in college that is extremely smart and pretty, but is very introverted. And when I say introverted, I MEAN IT. He is not socially anxious or anything, but is just comfortable with it.

I met him when I was first year of college, and now I'm in my third year. At first, I did not pay much attention to him. We talked a bit during first and second year, and since I said I was extroverted I just started talking naturally to him without being attracted to him.

But as I started my third year, I started paying more attention to him. Every time I talked, he always listened with focus. Maybe 3 weeks ago, I noticed that he looks me in the eyes a lot and smiles at me. When I was cold in class he asked me if I wanted his jacket.

Keep in mind that he doesn't have any female friends that I know of so I don't know if that's just his normal behavior.

And then a week ago when we were going out of our classroom, he asked me to go have coffee with him. I am usually with my two friends, but that day they didn't come to class, and he didn't have his guy friends around.

That literally left me in shock and I just brushed it off saying I have to work on my research paper and that I don't have time. He then said: ""You don't want to?"", and I said: ""No.""

But I also laughed, it wasn't like straight up rejection NO DON'T TALK TO ME ANYMORE.

Also keep in mind that I have never been on a date and for some reason I'm very scared because I suddenly don't know what to talk about, especially if I'm with someone who doesn't talk a lot in the first place.

After that I honestly felt a sense of accomplishment, but for a short time. Then the next day I felt he started to talk less with me and kind of avoided eye contact.

I was very sad because I truly liked his presence. I'm also very sad because he is leaving in September for Masters in another country, and I'm staying in my country, so basically we won't see each other like ever again.

I can't just naturally stay friends with him because I don't know how, and I also can't be with him because of our different religious backgrounds.

I just don't know what to do. :(

1kwq1hz,https://i.redd.it/yj6qvat2ec3f1.jpeg,Kung si San Isidro Labrador ay nabuhay sa panahon natin ngayon at kinamkam ni Villar ang lupa na sinasakahan nya (written on May 15),"May 15 na naman, Pista na naman ni San Isidro Merlo y Quintana, o mas kilala bilang San Isidro Labrador, kung saan kabi-kabilaan ang mga Pistang Baryo na nagpapasalamat sa masaganang ani, especially ang paborito ng lahat: BIGAS

Sa bigas umiikot ang buhay ng bawat Pilipino 
Sa bigas umiikot ang negosyo ng mga Unli Rice
At nakikita natin sa bigas kung ano na ang kalagayan ng ating bansa, lalo na nakaranas tayo ng mga serye krisis sa bigas (kung saan umabot sa P70 ang halaga ng bigas sa panahon ng nakaraang administrasyon.) at kahit sinisikap ng kasalukuyang Administrasyon na maipababa ang presyo.

Pero noong unang panahon, saganang sagana tayong lahat sa bigas, to the point na nagkaroon ng Masagana 99 at Green Revolution kung saan ung sobrang ani ay nakapag export tayo sa ibang bansa, and nagtayo pa tayo ng IRRI (International Rice Research Institute) at nagturo pa tayo sa mga kapitbahay nating bansa sa ASEAN.

But tila nag iba ang ihip ng hangin

Tayo na yung malakas mag import ng bigas mula sa mga bansang tinuruan natin

Kamusta naman ang lupang sakahan natin?

Ginawang Mall
Ginawang Subdivision (lalo Camella)

Kamusta naman ang agricultural sector ng bansa natin?

Somewhat nakakabawi? Yet we're still importers

Pero saan nag-ugat?

It all starts within US...
...na nagluklok ang sambayanan ng mga mambabatas para lang protektahan ang kanilang negosyo
...na nagpadala tayo sa slogan na ""ang mag-aahon sa ating kahirapan""

And second...lack of opportunities
...kaya pansin mo, nada-downgrade ang agriculture kasi ""pang mahirap?"" maliit ang kitaan? nananamantalang mga middleman?

And ung mga simpleng magsasaka na gusto ng lupang sakahan at reporma: pinapaulanan ng bala...

O bunying San Isidro Labrador, kung nakikita mo lang kami dyan buhat sa langit, mapapailing ka na lang, at kung nabuhay ka lang sa panahon natin ngayon, wala ka nang lupang maisaka, instead, itong Anghel na tumulong sa iyo sa pag-aararo: siya ngayon ay...

A. Naghahalo na yan ng semento: ung Eagle Cement
B. Nagpipintura ng Boysen
C. Naglalagay ng bubong: yung Galvanized Steel tas ung pintura Rain or Shine
D. Nag-iinstall ng aircon: yung Carrier
E. Nagkakabit ng wifi at linya ng telepono, yung PLDT at Converge
F. Naglilinis ng kanal para di bumaha pero ung mga balahura tapon ng tapon ng C2 na green matapos ayawan
G. Nagche-check ng gripo kung may pumapatak pang tubig lalo kung may Water Interruption
H. Sumali ng TUPAD para luminis ang paligid mo.
I. Nag-aayos ng furniture na galing sa AllHome

At nung pinabukalan mo ang tubig sa sakahan mo para may mainom at maidilig sa sakahan, kaso ngayon, di namin ramdam sa aming gripo na may pumapatak pa, minsan eh Matcha o Great Taste White pa (kung minalas malas, black coffee na amoy burak), and sira sira nga lang mga kalsada natin dahil lang sa ""repairs"" na sukat nakaperwisyo sa mga masisipag nating nanay na naglalaba at anak na tagahugas ng plato gamit ang Joy, habang sa kalsada, perwisyo rin sa mga simpleng Juan Dela Cruz na commuters natin

At nagtataka ka kung bakit wala nang lupang sakahan: may umangkin na, ginawa nang Camella, ginawa nang Vista Mall o All Day o All Ewan.

Now after we all look our situation, kung mabasa man ito ni San Isidro Labrador sa langit, we beseech his powerful intercession for our national food security ngunit may iba nung katatapos lang ng eleksyon, binoto nila yung ""bagong Boses"" diumano, na notorious ung pamilya nya na nangangamkam ng lupa na para sana sa Magsasaka para pagtayuan lang ng Camella, yet di inuuna yung issue ng Prime Water ng kapatid nya.

Meganon?

So yung mga bumoto sa mga Villar pero deboto ni San Isidrong Magsasaka, sana amagin mga kanin ninyo, at mapanis ulam ninyo

Kaya, Happy Fiesta na lang ni San Isidro Labrador sa mga may masaganang ani sa lupaing di pa naaangkin ng mga damuho, kung saan ang anak ni Cyntha'y kulelat, lalo na sa Biñan, Lucban at Pulilan, at mga Rural Areas na nagdedebosyon sa iyo para sa magandang ani, at hindi nakikinig sa ""bagong boses"" na pareho lang din ang apelyedo",1,1748359382.0,FuckVillar,1,1.0,False

Most of our conversations since then have been on video calls or whatsapp. We used to be really close.talk daily, exchanged gifts for birthdays and christmas, that sort of thing. For a while, I even had a bit of a crush on her. I didn’t know she was already in a relationship back then.so I asked her out, and that’s when she told me she had a boyfriend. Since then, I’ve totally seen her just as a friend,,nothing more.

Now here’s where it gets weird. I got a call from her just today at the office.she called me for help with a study related thing, and out of the blue she asked if I’d want to join her on a trip to Goa. At first, I assumed it was a group thing with her friends but then she clarified it would just be the two of us. That caught me off guard. I mean,..hanging out for a coffee or spending a day together in the city is fine, but going on a multi-day trip alone? It just feels odd to me. Especially knowing she’s in a relationship.
I even asked if her boyfriend is okay with it, and she said she doesn’t need his permission, and he wouldn’t mind anyway. & Apparently she said he’s very ""secure"" about these things. Also, just for the record she doesn’t have many close friends.one best friend is abroad and the other isn’t free to travel, so that’s one of the reasons she thought of asking me.

I’m not trying to be judgmental, but I just don’t know if this is normal? Or maybe I’m just old school. It feels like a bit of a boundary thing. and I’d personally feel weird if I was her boyfriend and found out my girlfriend was going on a solo trip with another guy, even if it's ""just a friend.""am I overthinking this?

**Why This Pick?**

9 of the last 10 encounters between these two teams have seen 8 runs or less; that’s an overwhelming statistic. On the mound, Tylor Megill (3.56 ERA) is one of New York’s best pitchers, and while Jonathan Cannon (3.76 ERA) is no ace, he’s one of the White Sox’s stronger arms. Between today’s two starters and an extensive history of low-scoring meetings, I’m on the Under to cash.

As you can see in the images, I installed the filter how I think this should work.

Included with the filters were those test stripes.

To my surprise, the color of the stripes are just exactly the same in the tank (before the filter) as afterwards when entering the portafilter (yellow color both; picture shows just one stripe but its 2x the same result). My setting in the filter is set to ""B"" as the water hardness is in the mid range.

Isn't this supposed to work differently? Like yellow before and green or something afterwards?

It is that time of the year again where you, fellow tourist, has come up with the unique idea of coming to Spain for the first time ever, totally a unique idea that no one else has thought of (hello, all unique +90 million foreign tourists coming to Spain!)

In this post I am going to give you the most important and slightly generic tips and tricks to make sure your trip to Spain is not only fantastic, but peaceful both the both of us (tourists and locals alike).

So lets get straight to the point.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1. TOURIST GO HOME Movement.

In 2024 parts of my country decided to go on an anti tourist protest/demonstration. International news media, desperate for clicks, views, and attention, decided to blow things drastically out of propertions ""Beware of Spain, savage locals will attack you! Your kids are no longer safe! Does your wallet need anti-Spain-insurance?!"".

As a result, ever since the news channels and articles decided that fear mongering was the best choice of action, people, constantly, every goddamn day, in every social media platform on the planet, is nonstop asking about their safety when coming to Spain... To which I say, please stop! q-q

Anyway, what happened??? Simple, too many tourists. That is it. Too many tourists taking over the city to the point we locals couldn't find a place to runaway and breathe.

Stupidity is an international sport. Profesional stupid people exist everywhere on planet earth, Spain is no exception. Which is why we decided that spraying you with water guns was the best choice of action, when it reality, with +35ºC  weather(+90ºF for you Americans) it just kept you longer in the streets as it cooled down your body temperature to more enjoyable levels.

With all that said. The reality is that there are a lot of factors at play... ONE of the MANY reasons BUT NOT the main factor is the Airbnb situation. A lot of Airbnbs in Spain are illegal! so, you know... go to a hotel. Another factor at play are caused by dumb and poorly educated tourists. Like I said, stupidity is an international sport, and the amount of stupid tourists walking amongst you and me are overwhelmingly intense, ESPECIALLY along the entire Spanish coast line.

If there is one thing we genuinely hate, and at one point will start hunting down (like The Purge**™** films) are the drunk/drugged/rude tourists. You know exactly who Im talking about, the loud, obnoxious, passed out drunk at 23:00 (11:00ppm for the americans) pissing and taking a shit in the street or the nearest beach, screaming, shouting, and disrupting the peace. So, if you do not fit that category, congratulations, we do not hate you, you are safe, you will not be ""attacked"" by us locals. **If you are an educated human being with manners, a sense of self dignity and respect towards others, you are not the target**.

So, to all of those people who are coming to Spain to party, or have a bachelor/Bachelorette pre wedding party with the purpose of getting drunk and blasted (shouting, yelling, fighting, and breaking the laws like pissing on the street)... Know that the locals and police (local, national, and Guardia Civil) are actively looking at you, ready for you to fck up in order to find an excuse to give you a fine and send you back home.  We are not a themepark.

2. Scams and Pickpockets

Barcelona for the past +7 years has been titled The Capital of Pickpocketing. Now, you may be wondering, OMG will I be stabbed/shot/mugged/kidnapped/raped/killed/enslaved/killed/forced to listen to a Jehovah's witness when coming to Spain?!?!?!

NO

In Spain, if you ever get pickpocketed, just know that the thieves are just looking for cash (bills/notes or coins), they don't care about credit or debit cards because those can be cancelled with a quick phone call.

How to avoid pickpockets in Spain 101. 

Rule número uno! DO NOT put anything in your back pockets (pants, jeans, trousers). We are living in the 2020s people, you have to be a lot smarter than to put anything in your backpockets where you have no line of sight of it. Keep everything in your front pockets, it makes it bulky, so you can see it and feel it, not to mention, make it a bit more difficult for potential pick pocteres. you can rest your thumbs in your pockets for added pseudo-protection. If you have a purse, make sure it has a zipper and the strap is tough (aka, no thing leather or plastic straps, use metal chains). If you have backpacks, put everything in your laptop pocket (some backpacks have a separate latptop pocket with zipper which is also closest to your back, makes it more difficult for pickpockets to grab. MAKE IT DIFFICULT for the bastards.

Rule número dos! Pretend to be a local. This is all about confidence, pretend that isntead of going to a generic tourist attraction, you are going to the local supermarket/grocery store to buy toilet paper. This chances your facial expression and overall behaviour and demeanor!!! From ""oooh aaah, look at the pretty old buildings! #Selfie!!! to ""focused, not stopping to look at google maps or other bullshit"". Believe it or not, but pickpocketers only go for people that look lost (constantly looking at a map or phone, not knowing where they are going, and stopping every few seconds). Meanwhile your average local is constantly moving because that pretty historical building is something they see everyday and therefore its no longer special; and if they stop, they don't have google maps on full display for everyone to see. This is the most imporant rule and its very much national geographic documentary, but the predator pickpocket will always go for the weak tourist (not physically weak, but simply inattentive and not being focused).

Rule número tres! Don't dress like a guiri. What is a guiri? Your stereotypical tourist... Straw hat, suncreen on the nose, short sleeve Hawaiian colorful shirt, short cargo shorts, socks and sandals, with an oversized camera worth more than your University degree. (google images the word Guiri). If you want to know how to dress like a local, its simple, do not dress like that. And for the Americans and even latin americans in the crowd (this can also apply to some of you btw), baseball caps are a dead give away that you are not a local, or wearing long white socks and super shiny white trainers/sneakers. We Spaniards (generally speaking) do not wear hats. For the tourist who is reading and is in Spain right now while sipping on some coffee or sangría, look up from your phone, and look around you. Do you see **locals** with hats or baseball caps? (you may see one or two, but it is definitely a vast minority). Also, no sports jerseys... We made be fans of footballs, but unless you are a 10 year old child who does not know how to dress, we don't wear sports clothes casually either. So to the americans and latin americans in the crowd, baseball caps with a basketball team logo t-shirt screams ""I am a guiri!"" or ""I am a Yanky!"" if you are from the U.S (P.S Yanky is our specific tourist slang for Americans from the U.S! If you hear that word, let it be known we are most likely talking shit about you).

Beggars. There are a lot of beggin tactics, here are some of the most popular.

NGO/Charaty clipboards asking for donations. YES, there are mafia organized crime groups that disguise as fake NGOs asking for 20€ donations.

Gypsy grandmothers giving away free flowers. Only to then start screaming 5 EURO, 5 EURO, GIVE NOW OR CALLING POLICE!!!! POLICE!!!!! SHE STEALING!!!! Do not accept free anything in the streets.

Fake tourists asking for money for the bus or train. Yup, there are professional forieng scammers scamming other foreigne tourists.

Fake entertainers dancing in the street. If you see a giant circle of tourist surrounding break dancers, some of those spectators are pickpocketers, avoid the big circles (if you are in Madrid, you will have seen them in Callao).

3. Weather.

When it comes to the continent of Europe, Spain is relatively simple. Its going to be fcking hot compared to anywhere else. HOWEVER!!! That does not mean its equally hot everywhere in Spain.

Elementary Geography lesson 101. North = cold, and South = hot. Good job. In Spain, the south of Spain aka, Andalucía (aka, Sevilla, Cadíz, Granada, Córdoba, Málaga, etc), in the summer, the weather can EASILY reach 45ºC (114ºF for you Americans). 

If you are stupid enough (yes, stupid) to visit the south of Spain during the summer, ESPECIALLY during the months of July and August... You will be visiting Satan's asshole after he has consumed 500 kilotons of the world's hottest chilly pepper with a side of Taco Bell™. And if you visit during those months with Children, you are even more fcking stupid as you are potentionally putting your kids in danger of a potential heatstroke. So, if you are visiting Spain during these months, have a swimming pool or beach nearby. 

And I will be very honest here. The south of Spain gets the most heat, but genuinely speaking, during July and August we get some dangerously intense heat waves that can reach the north too, except Galicia, that is the only region in all of Spain where they barely ever get affected. So places like Madrid, León, Salamanca, Oviedo/Gijón, Bilbao, etc can get +35ºC-40ºC during a heatwave. And if you are in Madrid during said potential heatwave... you are fcked. As a Madrid local myself... welcome to the desert planet of Arrakis (DUNE™).

So, you may ask yourself. ""When is the best time to visit Spain? Generally speaking May and September. if you are coming in June, that is fine, but please becareful during July and August. Drink water, sunscreen everywhere. And be near a body of water (beach, lake, swimming pool) during those two months.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

4. Food.

Spain is a regional country. This is common knowledge, but every country has its regions and provinces, and each region has its own culture and food. For the Americans reading this. Every country in the world have their own States, or concept of States. In Spain we have a total of 17 ""State"" or how we call them, Comunidades Autonomous (Autonomous Communities). As the name implies, they have some autonomy (not 100%, but some). Again, for the Americans, each autonomous community is almost like its own mini country, and they even have counties (what we call Provincias). 

That said, each region has its own signature dish or dishes (style of food). Galicia (north west) for example especializes in Seafood, and the signature dish is the Galician Octopus (Pulpo Gallego). Valencia has Paella. Madrid has Cocido, etc etc. But for example, all of Spain has Spanish Omellete (Tortilla de Patatas), Croquetas (croquettes), and other stuff. 

So, take that into account when it comes to food. If you are in Sevilla or Granada, for example, you are not going to find Paella (because its from Valencia). Guiris!!! If you are in are in Spain right now, and you are not in Valencia, if you see a restaurant that serves 10 types of Paella, that restaurant is a tourist trap. That is microwaved precooked, color tainted rice made in a factory. 

Paella is a family dish, that takes 1 hour to cook, that is a dish a restaurant cannot waste time cooking. There are restaurants that exclusively specialize in Paella, but those are higher price, require a week reservation in advance, as well as a reservation on the type of Paella you want. That's correct, if you want authentic paella outside of Valencia, you need to tell the restaurant what paella you want in advance, so when you come, its already being prepared 30 minutes before you are sitted down; that way, you only have to wait 20-30 minutes.

Beverages. Sangria is a tourist trap... well... It has become a tourist trap. I'm warning you in advance, we locals no longer drink sangría because is bad sangría. We drink Tinto de Verano (a cousin of sangría that even looks like Sangría if you are a tourist), Vermut, Beer, and Wine (Red/sparkling). Spain as a whole is a beer and wine country. So don't waste your money on bad sangría (literally) and get a better drink instead. OH! and if you are in the north of Spain (Asturias to be exact) the regional drink of choice is sider, and its fcking good (light too, so careful not getting drunk).

So, when preparing your trip to Spain, make sure to look at all the local dishes of the region you are visiting. Remember, if you want Paella, go to Valencia.

  
TAPAS are just another way of saying appetizers (aperitivos), it is not a special way to make a dish different. Tapas are small portion appetizers that become increasingly popular during and after the global economic crisis of 2008. So yeah, sorry to burst the bubble but the concept of a Tapas restaurant are tourist traps, well, most of them. If you want a bigger portion of a Tapa, we call them Ración/Raciones. Raciones are also pricier (more food, more money). 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

5. Transportation.

Compared to the rest of Europe, Spain is big, and for the Americans reading, Spain is roughly almost the size of Texas (your second biggest State), so take that into account when planning your itinerary...

It is not uncommon to see in this subreddit some of the dumbest and most poorly and unprepared itineraries on the planet... I am talking about some Warner Bros. Tasmanian Devil levels of bullshit where people are jumping up and down cross country thinking they can see 10 cities in 5 days, not knowing that half of an entire day will be wasted on (cross regional) public transport like highspeed trains and buses.

If you are planning on using Highspeed/bullet trains, let me tell you in advance that our Railway system is shaped like a Starfish. Spain during the Dictator ship became a Primate State, this meant that EVERYTHING (roads, highways, railways) were focused around Madrid when building. this means that if you want to go from Barcelona to Sevilla, you will have to do a mandatory stop in Madrid. I will say that it is getting better, but please, take this into account.

If you are planning to rent a car. Let me tell you right now, if we use Madrid city as the geographical center (which it is btw). If you start driving from Madrid to any coast (portal included), it will be a 6-7 hour car ride. So, if you are renting a car, and decide to go from Granada to Santiago de Compostela (Galicia), it will be a 9 hour car ride. Americans, I know you are used to long car rides and roadtrips, but even you know that 5 hours on the road can be tiresome...

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

6. How many days per city.

European cities are small compared to the rest of the world, That being said, Spain is known for having big cities by European standards. For americans, most cities will be very small, and other medium size at best.

That being said, I will give you a rough estimate of how much time you should genuinely spend in each city when visiting. That way you can also plan an itinerary properly.

Madrid is the Capital City of the entire country, and like I said before, Spain used to be a Primate State. If you are capable of using deductive skills, you will come to the conclusion that Madrid is going to be pretty fcking big. And guess what, it is the biggest city in the entire country. It is by no means the size of Tokyo City or Mexico City, but its big. 

Madrid is a 5 day visit (3 days in the city proper, and 2 days in the outskirts, nearby towns). 

Barcelona is a 5 day city (same reasons, 3 days city proper, 2 days outskirts)

Sevilla is a 3 day visit

Valencia is 3 days

Bilbao is 2 days

Granada is a 2 day visit (for us locals its 1.5 days)

Cordoba is 1.5 days

Salamanca is 1.5 days

Toledo is 1 day

Segovia is 1 day

Santiago de Compostela is 1 day

A Coruña is 1 day

Vigo (Islas Cíes) is 1 day.

These are the usualy time frames for us locals, because we've been there multiple times and we know what is really out there. But for your case, the humble Guiri, maybe you want to stay more days because you want to, and that is fine. Just know that beyond staying for the vibes, if you haven't rented a car and explore beyond the city limits, there is no point in staying 4 days in Granada for example.

If you are staying in one of the islands, those places are basically one week visits. Do not go to one of the islands and only stay for 2 days, that is a legitimate waste of your money and time.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

7. Police and General safety.

Ever since the terrorist attacks in Paris (2014), Spain and most European countries have been and still are under maximum alert (one level below military interference).

Spain currently has 5 levels, we are on level 4 (level 5 is when the actual military starts patroling the streets). This means you see a lot of police officers when assault rifles and riot shields in SPECIFIC heavy tourist traffic areas (like Callao for example). There are also a lot of Secret police, you guiris cannot see them, we locals cannot see them, but they are there, and there are sozens of secret police. In the metro, in Plazas, in tourist attractions. They are everywhere, having a coffee, going for a job, reading the newspaper, shopping, etc.

These officers are at the ready for a possible terrorist attack, not if your phone get pickpocketed. Yes, it is a sad truth and reality, but that is why the Spanish police appear to be useless in major tourist areas, because they are not there for pickpocketers, they are there to prevent and sacre off terrorists.

This is not a joke. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

8. Benidorm.

Just know that if your very first visit to spain is Benidorm, you are visiting Disneyland. A fake Spain, filled with British Pubs, German/Dutch Bars, and restaurants where you can eat Paella with haggis and bratwurst. 

For the brits out there, if you actually visit Benidorm as your first visit... you have more beautiful beaches down in south east England...

And for the Dutch and Germans, if Mallorca is your unofficial 17th Bundesland, consider Benidorm an inferior and lesser version of Mallorca conquered by retired British folk.

9. Youtube recommendations.

If you want to learn more about Spain before visiting, here are some recommendations I as a local, have for you.

1kwptx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1kwptx0/can_tide_liquid_laundry_detergent_with_downy/,Can Tide Liquid Laundry Detergent with Downy Transform Your Laundry? Read Our Review!,"**Exceptional Cleaning Power with Tide 30772115978**  

When I first came across the Tide 30772115978, officially dubbed the ""Tide Plus Boost of Ultra Downy Liquid Laundry Detergent,"" I wasn't expecting it to impact my laundry routine so profoundly. This isn't just a laundry detergent—it’s practically a secret weapon against tough stains and dull clothing. The combination of Tide's dominant cleaning power paired with Downy's April Fresh scent was a game-changer for me. I have tested this product for weeks on everything from bedding to workout gear, and the results consistently impressed not just me but even my picky housemates!  

**Packaging Worth Noting**  

The liquid detergent comes in a generously-sized 132-fluid-ounce container, promising up to 94 loads, which is perfect for a household like mine that churns through laundry. The design of the packaging is both functional and efficient. The measuring cap is clear, making it easy to eyeball exact amounts. I particularly appreciated the smaller dispensing spout, which allowed for less mess while pouring. Still, at 11.3 pounds, handling it can be slightly awkward. For someone with smaller hands or less strength, it might be a bit of a workout carrying this bad boy around.  

**Pros**  
- Concentrated formula means less water, more cleaning power!  
- Works in High-Efficiency (HE) and non-HE machines, offering versatility.  
- Long-lasting freshness with Downy's iconic April Fresh scent.  

[Looking for Tide 30772115978 discounts? Check Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0c3f9rh3s/)  

**Performance That Stands Out**  

Using this detergent on various types of fabrics, from delicates to sturdy towels, revealed its true strength. It removes common stains like coffee, grass, and those mysterious blotches my kids always seem to bring home. The ultra-concentrated formula is potent enough that even small amounts worked miracles, which helped me stretch the bottle for longer use. Since this detergent works effectively in cold water, I noticed the added benefit of lower energy costs. Bonus points for the fact that it left no residue on colorful clothes or whites, something that aptly hides Tide’s prowess in protecting garments.  

One thing I hadn’t initially anticipated was how the scent evolved post-wash. The April Fresh scent remained subtle yet detectable for days after the clothes exited the dryer, providing that just-washed feeling with every wear.

**Key Benefits**  
- Compatible with both cold and hot water cycles.  
- Less detergent means less waste due to its concentrated formula.  
- Its ability to tackle stubborn stains is practically unmatched.  

**Limitations to Consider**  

While it’s close to perfect, a few things to note. First, the April Fresh fragrance might be a tad overpowering for anyone accustomed to unscented products. My brother, who has a sensitive nose, found it slightly strong initially, although he eventually warmed up to its freshness. Secondly, the container design, while pragmatic, could definitely benefit from an ergonomic grip to make pouring easier. Lastly, although marketed as “phthalate-free,” it doesn't explicitly cater to completely scent-free households.  

- Larger size can be cumbersome to handle.  
- Scent might be too strong for hypersensitive individuals.  

**Stacking It Against the Competition**  

Comparing Tide 30772115978 to other popular brands like Arm & Hammer or Gain was revealing. Gain detergents offer variety in scents and come with a similarly powerful cleaning formula. However, I found that Gain’s provided freshness dissipated quicker and required higher detergent amounts in each load. Arm & Hammer, on the other hand, prides itself on being a more affordable yet effective option but lacks the luxurious touch of Downy’s clean aroma. For me, Tide hit the sweet spot of performance and fragrance longevity, excelling in areas its competitors fell short. Especially for removing set-in stains, Tide’s formula seemed to outperform the other options without sacrificing fabric softness.

**Quality for Price**  

While it’s a bit pricier than the bargain-bin options, you’re paying for undeniable quality, flexibility, and consistent results. I don’t necessarily mind investing in a cleaner that’s been dermatologist-tested and ranks high in performance. Given that it delivers 94 loads, I calculated that cost per load becomes surprisingly comparable to lower-end competitors. Plus, the sheer convenience of fewer stains to rewash saves a ton of time and energy in the long run.

Not that its bad to talk about it or to not want kids; but the way society sees it and the way every time I speak about it I am just getting questioned/aka interrogated, talked over, the way they try to convince and persuasion me into doing that and that its the right choice to have kids, that there is no choice as not having kids, every time I talk about it I get some kind of back lash, and I just feel tired all over again, bc people cant stop themselves from projection and wanting to push on their values on other people that go against it.

I (about to turn 22) remember my friend(23-24)/more like acquaintance from high school who is pregnant again, with her second child; who is in postpartum depression still after almost 2 years since her son was born, she wants to give birth to this child now and be done with making babies bc ""thats what every woman should do, give birth young and be done with it"", thats what she told me, so she started talking about me having kids and me now practising on how to take care of kids with her son, I am there for her sometimes and I am okey with spending time with her and her baby boy but I am not okey with taking care of him and babysitting him, I never did those things, I am okey with playing and being the cool aunt but the moment he gets fussy or the moment he starts crying I hand him off to his mother or father, I am dealing with that, so when she told me that in middle of our calm coffee while her kid was napping, I immeditely told her that I dont plan to have kids, that I dont want kids, that I dont see myself as a mother, she was shocked and she refused to accept that and continued talking about that being impossible and about me having to have kids, atleast one, that it will come naturally and that a woman isnt real woman without having kids, that being woman means having kids, I tried to tell her that I just dont want them and that I dont think that is true, that I dont agree with her about all that and that I wont have them and thats it, but she wasnt having that, after that I had few, like 1 or 2 more talks that basically ended like this, with them telling me that I will basically change my mind and that its not possible for a woman to not have kids, that we all need to have kids bc thats our ""reason to exist"" and thats how ""things naturally go""...

After those I was left feeling tired and frustrated, like I was talking to the wall trying to tell it that it doesnt need to be printed, like there is not possibility for it to not be painted.

So I am left here thinking of never correcting them and just living my life without having kids and without having to listen to their bullshit of how it aint possible for me to not have kids as a woman or a person bc those convos dont lead to anything, just negative things and feelings like stress, frustration, tiredness..

My reasons of not wanting kids are;

1. My health; I have diabetes and problems with hips & legs.

2. I dont like kids as how they are, I like spending some time with them doing fun things and playing, but I dont like taking care of them.

3. I have depression, anxiety & insomnia; that I am healing from but I might have ADHD and autism, I am soon going on testing for it and if its true it will explain why I am the way I am. (My parents neglected me and in my culture and country its still seen as very bad to even have one of those diagnosis so even if something was seen as ""wrong and odd"" in my behaviour my parents kept silent about it, but my mom and family would abuse me for that, for being different, lazy, strange, emotional and what not, going to a professional is seen as bad and like you are nuts, still but less).

4. I dont want my children in this planet nor in this culture nor this society, nor with this genes of my family; this world, my family and our society aint something healthy nor something I would like to bring anyone into, let alone my child.

Thought I’d share my PJFT experience as it may help others going through the same or answer any questions. 27 male.

Firstly, had my blood pressure, height and weight taken. My PT told me that if you received a medical in the previous 6 weeks then you don’t need to do that part. But as I’m rejoining within 3 years I didn’t have a medical, so my BP was taken before my fitness test.
Don’t drink any coffee, protein shakes etc - they fail you if your BP is too high. 

I then went to the treadmill, instructions and rules were read out.
I was allowed to adjust the speed but of course, you cannot use the railings or anything to rest - only adjust speed.
The speed was NOT set by the instructor. This had to be done by me. The PT told me a comfortable pass was 12.2kph.
I set it at 11.3 kph and within a minute or two, I upped it to 11.8.
At 6.40, halfway, the PT told me I was on track. If I wasn’t, she would have also let me know.

For me, I just stayed at 11.8kph as I was already going to pass - and I did the time in 12.35. So there was still buffer.

Some treadmills may be slightly out but this is what it was for me.

The incline was zero, as you’d expect.

I am looking to do a mod on my classic pro and am wondering if the gaggimate is the better choice for me over the gaggiuino. 

I’m not a huge tinkerer on the coffee end at this point of my life — not trying to do very in-depth profiling or anything. I just want more consistent temp/shots and steaming, and this feels like the way to go about it. So far I’ve been a little disappointed with the consistency of my pulls on my GCP and very disappointed in the wand. As someone who had previously only learned/worked on a slayer machine in a nice shop, there’s just no comparison. 

I’m a little more intimidated by gaggiunio, which to me feels like a product/community more geared towards savvier diy-ers and those who are trying to tinker more with shot profiles. There feels like there’s a bit more pride with gaggiunio as a product — like, “if you can’t figure out how to wire this from this schematic you’re not one of us”. I am a psychotherapist. I am not great with wires, but I am very handy generally. I’m good enough to figure this out but I’m looking for the simpler of the two that’s a step above just doing a PID. 

I’m not super interested in the community aspect of either product/project — I don’t care if one has crueler tendencies in their respective discord. I’m just trying to mod my machine and make some good coffee/work on my latte art so I can feel young again like in my barista days without having to drop G-notes on a machine I can’t fit in my kitchen anyway.

1kwpkio,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1kwpkio/to_her_from_a_distant_past/,"To her, from a distant past.","I remembered a girl I used to work with. She was french, bur grew up in China, she was 5'10, dirty blond, hazel eyes and a round face that was sharp in just the right places. Her name was Marie, and I really liked her, from the moment we met, things felt good, we talked alot to eachother, she even said she had a party and said she'd invite me(mind you, I did not even ask for it or anything).

Months passed and everyday I grew more fond of her, I purposefully asked my manager to give me extra shifts just so I could see her more often, even other colleagues told me about it, how there was a spark between us, it felt like destiny.

I remember once, during one of our closing shifts, I went downstairs to pack the trash bins before taking them out, she was already done, dressed, and about to leave. Not wanting to seem desperate I didn't say anything, so by the time I had come back up to take the garbage out, she was outside, and as if out of a disney film, she turned around, smiled at me, and waved goodbye before turning around again to leave. Something in my heart sank, I think maybe I was in love.

I planned to ask her out the next time I saw her, it felt right, and when I went to do so, I was told she's on holiday, I didn't mind it much and figured I'd wait out the extra 2 weeks. But when she came back, things changed, the friendliness stayed, but she wasn't the same again, somedays she wouldn't even say hello, I later learned that weeks prior, her ex-boyfriend had came to the cafe, that they had talked, kissed, and gotten back together, my world had shattered.

Even now, long after she left the establishment(she went to live in Germany with her boyfriend), people still talk about it sometimes, truth is, she was beautiful and everyone wanted her, but that friendliness, the warmth, the eye contact and the smile, the teasing(she once asked if I would fight her when we were washing cutleries and the knives in our hands clashed), it was all too real.

She was 23, about to graduate with a masters in Genetics, and there I was, just 21, not even out of college yet, with a dream I'm not sure I even like anymore, and yet, this tiniest stupid part within me, dreamed, and so did I. I would go to work purposefully earlier than I had to, I'd always ask her for coffee even though I knew I wouldn't be able to sleep the night properly, but I didn't care, she meant that much to me.

There doesn't come a day that I don't think about it, about how it could've been me, maybe even should've, and yet, I stayed silent, I thought it too cruel and irresponsible to dump that rubble on her, given her trajectory in life. One time I even dreamed that she was angry at me, telling me ""it's too late now"", gosh, I don't often link my dreams to meaning, but what if it was right?

I had symptoms such as Bloating, heartburn, feeling Nausea (but never actually thrown up), stomach aches (Occasionally), frequent burps and acid reflux.  
  
I consulted a physician first and he gave me some medicines which weren't effective.  
Then I consulted a gastro and he gave medication (AGAIN INEFFECTIVE) and suggested some blood tests (ttg-Iga, liver function test, CT scan of abdomen, X ray of stomach) all were normal except my bilirubin levels were a bit high which the doctor said was nothing to worry about (Gilbert's Syndrome) and then he suggested an endoscopy (mainly for checking H-Pylori).  
The symptoms are still persistent (bloating, heart burn, stomach aches 2-3 days a week, burps, acid reflux ) except nausea feeling comes rarely now.  


Now the problem is my father is really scared of how the endoscopy procedure is done and doesn't want me to have one.  
Instead he consulted another physician for me and that Doctor asked me to go on a Gluten free, Lactose free and Rice based diet for me and then consult after a month which clearly isn't helping (it has been 10 days since I am on this diet).  
The Doctor really took my symptoms really lightly and didnt provide any medication either.  


Now I am really done with this situation and can't take this anymore.

Today I woke up hungover again after waking up hungover most days for many weeks. No big rock bottom moment this time, thank goodness. I'm just over it. I want to do better for my kids. I have a big event this coming weekend and I don't want to look all gross and unhealthy like I do when I'm drinking. I want to be free from the cravings and I want to be proud of myself for making progress on my goals and making good choices. 

I have been having intrusive thoughts that romanticize alcohol's role in my life. These thoughts are lies! I tell myself I am the happy fun party girl who is just having a nice adult beverage to relax and unwind but the reality is that I will drink a 12 pack on my own without trying, and I've been doing that most days lately and it's not hot or cute. It's expensive, embarrassing, and it's poisoning me. It is going to be a process to find different ways to cope, but I can do it. I've done it before -- I was sober for 5+ years(!!!) 2016-2021. I did it once, I can do it again. 

Drinking alcohol isn't helping me do any of the things that are important to me. I'm a single parent to several very busy kids, I'm in grad school, I have a great job that is important to me, and I am planning a move in a few months that I need to prepare for.

Now I'm getting reports of speed test results <5Mbps on a Director's Win11 laptop via Wifi. At the same time (a few minutes later), I'm getting 250Mbps down on my MDF workstation, via Ethernet directly to the pfSense router. This indicates that Wifi is the source of the issue.

* WAPs all show 3 out of 4 green status lights: power, 2.4Ghz, and 5Ghz (6Ghz light is off)
* pfSense has no traffic inspection for clients on the VLAN in question. (even if it did, I wouldn't expect this kind of drop in speed.)",3,1748358072.0,ArubaNetworks,8,1.0,False

Seriously, who doesn’t want that? Imagine waking up, sipping your morning coffee, and seeing those sales rolling in while you *literally* do nothing. Well, my friends, it's time to stop dreaming and start doing!

Let’s dive into **setting up automated sales funnels** for your AI-generated content—because guess what? You can work smarter, not harder!

### Why Set Up a Sales Funnel?

1. **It’s Like Having a 24/7 Sales Rep**: Your funnel is always there, pitching your content even while you snooze. Talk about a night shift!
   
2. **Less Stress, More Creativity**: If your content is working for you, you’ll free up time to whip up even more awesome stuff. Win-win, right?

3. **Scalable Income**: Want to make $100, $1,000, or more? Your funnel can grow with you. It's all about that *scalability*!

### Here’s How to Set It Up: 

- **Create The Content**: Use that AI magic! 🪄 Whether it’s blog posts, videos, or social media snippets, get that engaging content out there. 

- **Define Your Audience**: Who are you talking to? Find your ideal reader (or customer) and tailor your content for them. Trust me, nobody likes generic drivel.

- **Lead Magnet Creation**: What freebie can you offer to entice people? E-books, checklists, or even a fun quiz can be your golden ticket. 

- **Landing Page**: Build a simple, eye-catching landing page. *Keep it clean and focused* on the lead magnet. Throw in that “Subscribe” button—make it look irresistible! 

- **Thank You Page with Offers**: After they grab that freebie, redirect them to a “Thank You” page with exclusive offers. Sneaky, right? But it works!

- **Email Marketing**: Now that you’ve collected emails, nurture those leads! Send them a mixture of value-driven and promotional content. (Pro tip: don’t be a spammy robot; nobody likes that!)

- **Automate, Automate, Automate!**: Tools like Mailchimp or ConvertKit can help you set up campaigns on autopilot. Less manual work = more time for Netflix and snacks. 🍕🎬

### Mistakes to Avoid:

- **Ignoring Your Analytics**: Keep an eye on the numbers. They tell you what’s working and what’s a total flop.

- **Neglecting Engagement**: Don’t just blast emails! Engage with your audience. Respond to comments, ask for feedback, and make it a two-way street.

- **Setting It and Forgetting It**: Yes, automation is great, but you still need to tweak and optimize your funnels regularly. 

So, what do you think? 🧐 Imagine waking up to sales notifications and thinking, “Damn, I really do know what I’m doing!” 

If you’ve got experiences, tips, or even some hilarious fails while setting up your funnels, **I'd love to hear!** Did you stumble upon an incredible resource? Share away! Let’s get the conversation flowing!",1,1748357782.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

Seriously, do people actually ""see"" an apple when they visualize an apple, like a hallucination? Or is just the concept of an apple? Sort of an abstract image or memory.

This lack of seeing the image doesn't impact me practically. It would be nice to be able to play movies in my head which I can actually see, but alas!

This brings me to anhedonia;

Similarly, I think I only feel the concept of positive feelings on a day to day level. A cup of coffee gives me the concept of a slight positive feeling. Going for a run gives a slight concept of happiness.

It takes something really good to happen to shift from simply feeling the concept of joy, to actual joy.

Most of the time, I feel like a blank-slate. Not sad, not joyful. Sometimes I enjoy music if the song is clicking with me. Is this anhedonia, or just normal?

I don't think this is actually a pathology. I function perfectly fine without the strong feelings, I do things because they are good for me. I feel a slight reward for doing good things, but it's not amazing joy to write home about.

But now I've learned that people actually \*feel\* joy about making a fresh cup of coffee in the morning? Or feel joy about eating food, or going for a walk? To me this is about as bland as brushing my teeth. Like a slight good feeling that I've done something useful, and give myself a tick of approval, but nothing special.

Yet it seems like people are walking around in a state of mild bliss on a day-to-day level. This seems very strange to me. It would be nice to have that!

I don't think any amount of positive thinking can make the feeling happen, they are just lucky. But if anyone has actually been able to go from never having had that feeling, to getting it, I'd be interested to know how you've managed to do it?

I think life will go on with or without the feeling, being in the neutral zone. But it is interesting to know what's going on in other people's minds.

Maybe there is a connection between anhedonia and aphantasia? e.g. maybe there is part of the brain that can't process emotions or images, but only the concepts of them? Any thoughts on this? There seems to be a few scientific studies which suggest this.

Some other things:  
\- Caffeine does nothing for me.  
\- Alcohol does nothing for me.  
\- I have high IQ (probably around 130) but I'm no genius. I do sometimes feel trapped in my logical mind too much.  
\- Not on the autism spectrum as far as I am aware, though I respect people who are.

Also another thing. If people are so happy, why does everyone seem so glum? Is it just their resting facial expression and they actually are joyful on the inside?

If I was walking around in a state of bliss, surely I would be smiling or more positive. But everyone just seems closed off, scrolling on their phones, and lacking any interest. It feels like there is no genuine human connection to be found. This makes me think people aren't really as happy as they say they are. Although, maybe they are just so used to the feeling, they take it for granted, and it is just normal for them? Any thoughts? ",0,1748357441.0,anhedonia,0,0.5,False

Its a literal mess - I have to sign into a special portal at the vendor, ""edit"" the subscription to add new seats to it, then it takes a while for the order to be processed and reflected in the Adobe portal, and I can literally only do ONE purchase order at a time; if I have to add employees to multiple depts, I might as well get a cup of coffee as I have to wait until each...individual...purchase order (one per dept) goes through before I can order more.

But wait - there's more! The actual license counts in the Adobe portal are a mess and don't really reflect...anything at this point. I have to remember to go into the app profile and edit the @#$#@ quotas so my new employees aren't showing trials.

But wait - there's MORE! I can sync users via OIDC to the portal, but I can't assign actual licenses to users automatically as I think it only uses two criteria, neither of which I can leverage. Can't I use groups?

AND MORE - In the Adobe portal, it let's me ""pre-add"" licenses and instructs me to backfill the licenses with orders from my vendor. This used to be how I did it, but now, new employees licenses get removed because ""you can't do that anymore"". I mean - well why does the portal still do that if it doesn't work???



The process used to be so simple - pre-add licenses, get quote from vendor, shoot them PO and credit card and life goes on. Now its dedicating an hour to ordering 3 licenses sometimes.

I bring this up because I'm curious if it's really just the vendor or Adobe? Vendor tells me this is all 100% Adobe and that all the usual vendors are using the same process. (picture me cynical)

1kwp1ir,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kwp1ir,"Kendu Brandcoin Ignites Global Culture Movement with Energy, Art, and Innovation","
In a reddit sea saturated with fleeting hype, kol-driven pump-and-dumps, botted tokens, and worse, one decentralized movement is proving that culture, commerce, and crypto can collide with purpose and authenticity. The Kendu Brandcoin ecosystem is quickly becoming a cultural juggernaut, merging real-world products, grassroots street art, live events, and blockchain ideology under one unifying message: “We don’t gamble. We work.”

At the heart of the Kendu movement is $KENDU, the community-driven “Brandcoin” powering a self-sustaining, permissionless economy. Unlike traditional meme coins that burn fast and fade, Kendu fuels tangible products and services — each one a tribute to hard work and cultural pride.

Kendu Energy: Fuel for Builders

Launched in 2024, Kendu Energy has become the drink of choice for crypto traders, artists, athletes, and entrepreneurs alike. Available in both Regular and Zero Sugar formulas, these energy drinks are now shipping to the U.S., Canada, and Australia — a bold move for a brand that emerged from a meme coin.

Kendu Nights Light Up India

Thousands gathered in New Delhi and Mumbai this spring for Kendu Nights, a high-energy fusion of music, art, and crypto education. Local DJs, dancers, and visual artists transformed these nights into open-air festivals celebrating decentralized creativity. QR codes for free Kendu drops, branded merch, and event-only Kendu NFTs added a Web3 dimension to the experience — bringing crypto culture to the streets in a way few projects have managed.

Art Takeovers & Street Team Surge in Miami

In the United States, the Kendu street team made headlines during Miami Art Week with guerrilla-style art installations and digital activations across Wynwood and downtown Miami. Billboards, posters, and pop-up vending activations turned the city into a canvas for the Brandcoin’s bold visual identity. Flash mobs handed out Kendu Coffee and Energy samples, while local artists participated in live painting sessions themed around decentralization and resistance to corporate gatekeeping.

Kendu Vending Machines: Passive Income Meets Public Art

Kendu’s innovation doesn’t stop at drinks. The recent rollout of Kendu Vending Machines brings their ethos into public and commercial spaces. These AI-powered machines, tagged with Kendu’s signature branding, are more than snack stations — they’re decentralized profit hubs. Business owners can install the machines and earn passive income, while Kendu holders get access to exclusive offers and QR-code airdrops at select locations.

Kendu Coffee: Bold Flavor, Strong Message

In the UK, Kendu Coffee has carved out a loyal following with blends like “Chads Choice” and “Kendu Decaf.” Priced accessibly, the brand delivers not only robust flavor but also the spirit of the Kendu movement — self-reliance, consistency, and grit. Whether you’re brewing before a morning trade or pulling an all-nighter on your side hustle, Kendu Coffee is designed for those who grind.

The Brandcoin Revolution

Kendu is not just building products — it’s creating a decentralized, self-reinforcing brand economy, or what insiders call the “Brandcoin culture.” Each new initiative — from vending machines to live events — feeds back into the token’s ecosystem, increasing both cultural and financial value.

With its eyes set on additional global rollouts, a growing merch line, and even rumored partnerships in sports and gaming, Kendu is setting a new precedent: a meme coin can evolve into a lifestyle brand, a social movement, and a decentralized business empire.

In a sea of empty promises, Kendu delivers — one coffee, one energy drink, one street mural at a time.

Security and Transparency

In a significant achievement, Kendu Inu secured a CertiK audit after amassing 50,000 community votes—a rare feat for memecoins. The audit not only underscored the project’s commitment to security but also highlighted the community’s ability to mobilize and achieve substantial goals.

Getting Involved

For those intrigued by Kendu Inu’s unique approach and community spirit, getting involved is straightforward:
	1.	Visit the Official Website: Explore resources, updates, and community channels at kenduinu.com.
	2.	Engage on Telegram: Join discussions, share ideas, and stay informed by participating in the Kendu Inu Telegram group.
	3.	Follow on Social Media: Stay updated with the latest news and initiatives by following Kendu Inu on Twitter.
	4.	Acquire $KENDU Tokens: Purchase tokens through supported exchanges to become a stakeholder in the project’s future.

Conclusion

Kendu Inu exemplifies what a dedicated, decentralized community can achieve in the cryptocurrency space. By prioritizing hard work, transparency, and collective action, it has transformed from a simple memecoin into a movement with real-world impact. As the project continues to evolve, it invites newcomers to contribute, collaborate, and be part of a journey that redefines the potential of community-driven ventures.

This isn’t crypto as usual. This is culture on-chain.

1kwoyth,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1kwoyth/my_dearest_sinclair/,My Dearest Sinclair,"Sinclair is a squishmallow.

A squishmallow is a polyhedral blob of polyester fluff engineered to maximize huggability by combining softness and squish.

They are often modeled after various animals — cows, pigs, chickens — or assortments of food — strawberries, tacos. Or even mythical beasts like unicorns.

They come in various sizes, from 5.08 cm (2 inches) to 60.96 cm (24 inches).

Each is christened with a name, and backstory scrawled on its tag to beguile collectors into forming bizarrely personal bonds.

Sinclair was of the avocado toast variety.

Of course, Sinclair and his cousin Austin (an avocado) love to talk about outer space. Still, they always disagree on whether aliens exist. Austin thinks they do, but Sinclair needs more proof.

  
  
Every time we went to the store, you would also want to look at squishmallows and consistently question why I hadn’t ever gotten you one.

A bigger ask, if you hadn’t already owned a small army of them — and been 23.

I digress.

Two years into our relationship, I decided now was the time to show my commitment and affection by finally getting you a squishmallow.

After some painstaking research, I settled on Sinclair.

Why?

Avocado toast was our first breakfast together. Because he was the biggest one. Because love, I assumed, was best expressed in a 60.96 cm plush monolith equipped with a smile.

And for a short time, the avocado toast was cherished.  
*Until he wasn’t.*

Soon, he found himself discarded on the floor or marooned on a chair beneath the strata of laundry. “He’s just too big,” you’d say. “And just a square.” An accusation that, if applied to a person, would cause years of therapy. But Sinclair bore it bravely, his stitched-on smile unchanging.

I’d always seen squishmallows as absurdly overhyped polyester poofchunks.

However, I grew attached — not in the conventional “I love this plush vegetable” sense, but in the strange, Stockholm-y way one bonds with furniture after a breakup. As you finished your makeup or shower, I routinely sat in the chair holding, hugging, tossing, and squeezing Sinclair, who always maintained his sunny disposition.

When we moved into our new place together, I realized that this blob of polyester fluff had become mine. You’d purchased a large basket to keep all your other squishmallows in, and I allowed Sinclair to live on the couch.

*He had earned it, dammit.*

Monuments crumble. Our mornings grew quiet, the clink of your coffee mug sharper than our words. I wonder if Sinclair saw it coming.

When you left, it wasn’t clean. Plenty of clothes, mugs, those “survival tablets” your doomsday prepper father swore by — oversized Tic Tacs dressed up as apocalypse rations. You’d called them essential, but they stayed scattered like your lies.

But you’d taken Sinclair.

I’ve mourned us in my own way — drowning in Jack and Coke, chasing distractions with women who offered less clothing and even less conviction. But nothing stuck. Not the drinks. Not the cleavage. Just the ghost of that 60.96 cm avocado toast, grinning through it all.

You never liked him. You made that abundantly clear. So why did you take him?

Was it pettiness? Sentimentality? Did he become a totem of our failed romance, dragged to your mother’s home like a haunted heirloom? Is he in your closet now, suffocating under discarded hoodies? Or worse — has he been sentenced to the trunk of your car, doomed to a purgatory of gas receipts, dirty old shoes, and other rubbish?

Or does he lie on your bed, finally accepted, nestled among his plush compatriots?

I’ve thought about replacing him.  
But I couldn’t do it.  
Because I don’t want *a* Sinclair.  
I want *my* Sinclair.  
A fresh Sinclair would just sit there,  
pristine and soulless.  
There can be no replacement.  
You can’t duplicate the ghosts stitched into the seams.

So now I wonder.

When the next chap comes along —  
the one who gets to lie beside you,  
who picks up each of them and asks,  
“Where’d you get this one?”  
Will you list them all, as you once did with me?  
The peanut butter jar. The pig. The strawberry.  
Will you pause  
when you reach the avocado toast?  
Will you say  
where my dearest Sinclair came from?

* Walltown has been pouring into young developing artists for 25 years.

[**Retro Film Series — School in the Crosshairs**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/retro-film-series-school-in-the-crosshairs/) at **Carolina Theatre**  


* Genre master Nobuhiko Ôbayashi is best known for 1977’s “Hausu,” and this 1981 fantasy is filled with his trademark analog special effects and camera tricks, though this time supported by a stronger main story with a well-developed central character, a notable departure from “Hausu.” Hiroko Yakushimaru stars as Yuko, a high school girl who must defend her school from an extraterrestrial attack. A new transfer student is using her psychic abilities to transform their school into a conformist, almost fascistic staging area for an alien takeover of the Earth, while coercing her classmates into going along. Discovering her own latent telekinetic abilities, Yuko teams up with Koji, her budding boyfriend from the kendo club, to fight off the invaders. The special effects-heavy finale – a battle between Yuko and Kyogoku, the demon-like extraterrestrial being who has set his sights on the school – manages to outdo “Hausu” in its wild, brain-melting unbelievability. It’s also a brilliant statement about conformity and free thought, most likely aimed by Obayashi at Japanese society in general and the film industry in particular. Despite having been remade over and over as a television series, animation, and other live-action films, it’s Obayashi’s version that is considered the best by Japanese critics and fans.

Since 1984 Criterion has aimed to reflect the breadth of filmed expression. It tries not to be restrictive or snobby about what kinds of films are appropriate. An auteur classic, a Hollywood blockbuster, and an independent B horror film all must be taken on their own terms. All Criterion asks is that each film in the collection be an exemplary film of its kind.

* James Keul’s new show, A Painter’s Life, examines our connection to nature. Keul is an accomplished artist who has taught painting around the world, working in a variety of mediums to develop the deft, painterly technique seen in his work.
* The exhibition includes a selection of plein air works from his native North Carolina and abroad, as well as large-scale paintings which explore the impact humans are having on the natural world. In these paintings, Keul includes figures, both adults and children, to invite us to consider how our actions will impact future generations.
* Keul values art not only for its own sake, but also as a meditative practice which has guided his life. “Having had an unconventional adolescence, flying back and forth between parents and coasts, and being sent, at age 16, to a therapeutic boarding school in Western Samoa, art has been true north on my life’s compass, helping to guide me through some turbulent events and teaching me the value of patience, perseverance, and humility” he says.
* Keul’s work can be found in important public and private collections around the world. As an educator committed to empowering the next generation of artists, he will be teaching a group of Savannah College of Art and Design students at their campus in Lacoste, France this summer.

It’s my birthday today, and I just want to take a moment to thank all of you for being such a fucking awesome community.

  
I just want to say THANK YOU to all of you. I’ve seen people here be incredibly supportive, helpful, funny, brutally honest, and sometimes even savage (in a good way). Whether someone’s having a rough day, asking for advice, ranting, or just sharing random thoughts—there’s always someone who shows up with encouragement, a fresh perspective, or even just a meme to make someone smile.

 

Of course, we’ve had our fair share of disagreements, arguments, and drama. That’s just part of being Ahmdavadi may be . But even after the dust settles, we still stick around, still help each other, still keep this thing going. And that’s what I love most about being part of this space—it’s real. It’s messy sometimes, but it’s honest and alive. I may not know most of you personally, but I still feel a strange, comforting connection here. So today, I’m raising a virtual glass (or maybe a coffee mug 😄) to all of you.

 

So yeah, today I just want to say I’m genuinely grateful to be a part of this wild, weird, wonderful group of people. Thanks for being here, for being you, and for making this community feel like something worth showing up for.

 

Let’s keep that spirit alive. Much love to everyone who makes this place what it is.",6,1748356699.0,ahmedabad,16,0.88,False

1kwov8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kwov8v/im_so_tired_of_job_searching/,Im so tired of job searching,"I just graduated with my masters degree in education studies last week. Since March, I’ve been applying to a lot of higher education positions since i was originally going for early childhood education and realized it was not the career for me. I’ve applied to 85 jobs so far, most of them being anything i qualify for but almost half being jobs at different colleges. I live in a commutable distance from at least 10 schools, from universities to community colleges and I have either been rejected or ghosted from all of them. A lot of jobs i still have some hope for since the closing date hasn’t happened yet but I’m so jaded from this whole experience. Ive been nonstop networking and having coffee with all these higher ed professionals, most of which give me the same tired advice (tailor your resume/cover letter to the job you want etc) and i do all of that but i’ve gotten NOTHING. The job market is so bad, I hear it from everyone, and that “I’m not the problem” but i feel like I am the problem and that advice doesn’t apply to me. I’m applying to stuff i’m under/overqualified for. My tipping point was finding out a girl i went to hs with who has equivalent qualifications than me got a job that I applied for and got ghosted. 
I’m still working my high school job as a caterer to make a paycheck but it’s part time and I’m so checked out. I can’t deal with all the drama and working nights/weekends anymore while watching my peers find their postgrad jobs, make more money, and have free time on the weekends and at night. And get to do what they’re passionate about. I feel like a jerk sometimes complaining about a major first world problem like that but I worked so hard for 5 years to get here and I feel so ashamed of my life. My parents are disappointed in me because i switched career paths at the last second and haven’t gotten a job yet and want me to go into HR and i don’t want to. My boyfriend went back to college, got his degree and his dream job in IT all in the span of 2 years and he’s putting heavy pressure on me to find a job so we can move in together. I’m starting to grow resentment because he thinks i won’t get a college job and is pushing me to apply to other jobs that I don’t want so i can get out of the restaurants and start working full time. He got his dream job because he knew someone that got him an interview, he doesn’t understand how much effort and time i put into applying for jobs because he just clicked the easy apply button on Indeed 200 times and didn’t get anything (for frame of reference, it takes about an hour per job for me to really build an intentional application to a job i actually want). I feel like i’m under water with all of these external pressures right now. Don’t get me wrong, it’s better than the way i felt during teaching and i don’t regret for even a second leaving. That job process is even worse but i’m just ready to start my life now and i feel stuck. ",3,1748356582.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I have always liked Ruark and was going to treat myself to a Ruark 1RS but ended up looking at a turntable.

The above got narrowed down to a Sony BT turntable or a P1 paired with a Sonos Era 100. I then saw a wise comment saying before you delve into the world of Vinyl to make a list of your top 10 favourite albums and effectively price them up. I didn’t even get to number 5 before I was over £100 which I just can’t justify.

With the power of Google and YouTube a few CD articles and videos popped up which I started looking at. I did the same Top 10 exercise using Amazon for new and Music Magpie for used and the prices were negligible in comparison.

This then led me into what do I buy, I only wanted something small to go on a coffee table where I chill out before work and on weekends when everyone else is asleep. I stumbled across the FIIO DM 13 and from what I can see I can still connect this to a Sonos ERA 100, has anyone done this and if so how has your experience been?

I have a Sonos Beam and Play Ones at home for the TV but that’s a bit much at 7am on a Sunday morning. I could also use my AirPods with my iPhone for Apple Music but I like the idea of just putting a CD in and sitting back and relaxing.

I’m also looking forward to buying all my favourite albums again which luckily don’t cost £30 each.",0,1748356574.0,Cd_collectors,4,0.5,False

Right now, we live in the highlands neighborhood of Denver and absolutely love it. It’s walkable, full of young families, and close to great parks, playgrounds, coffee shops, and restaurants—with a strong sense of community. We’re hoping to find something with a similar feel in or around Albany.

We’re looking for neighborhoods that offer:

- A strong presence of young families
- Walkability to shops, playgrounds, and daily essentials
- Access to parks or green spaces
- A safe, welcoming, and community-oriented vibe

Anyway I've seen him two times sense then, and the most recent he parked in front of a coffee shop down the block from me where I'm actual friends with a couple of the people who work there. 

There's been a couple other cases of this (not the driving situation just people being nasty) both personal and not, and I honestly don't understand it anywhere, but especially not in this city.

It seems that I am not very sensitive to any substances in general. I heard about so many reactions, bad and good, to Atomoxetine, but I barely feel anything. First day I got super motivated (though might have been placebo thing), but also lost appetite and was a bit dizzy when running. Similarly day 2, but from that time on, I do not feel anything. I did not feel any other side effects apart from elevated heart rate when working out and reduced appetite. Now I am at the beginning of the 3rd week and even my appetite has gone back to normal I'd say. But I barely feel having any effects at all. I am still fidgety, not motivated with day-to-day tasks, impatient and with concentration troubles. I am not 100% sure I have ADHD still, the diagnosis in my country is... well, definitely not as detailed as sth I have seen in this subreddit.

It is true that I feel less anxious but I am not ALWAYS anxious so I do not know if that's coincidence. It is also true that I have not done any big impulsive decisions and compulsive buying in this time - bug, again, it's not like I was spending 10000 dollars every week randomly. 

So, I really don't know. I do not feel those ""moments of complete silence"" that I've read here about. I am on 40mg from day 1. I take it around 11 am after I have some food. I drink \~2 cups coffee per day and no other meds.

Should I still keep taking it and see what it's like after 1 month? Anyone had effects only after more time has passed?

Should I ""test"" my ADHD diagnosis with trying a (prescribed) stimulant and seeing if it calms me done as expected with ADHD or rather stimulates me? I've tried a stimulant once (literally once) years ago and I remember how calming it was for me.

1kwosyg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kwosyg,Science experiment!,"While going thru some things in my attic I came across a stash of MRE accessory kits both Military and probably Civilian with 2000 date codes. Don't ask me why I kept them. 😁 And they have been stored in the worst of conditions. Summertime heat in that attic must be well over 120° and full humidity in the mid Atlantic South. So after field stripping them here's a few interesting observations. 

All of the coffee is still free flowing and well granulated and brewed up fine 

Nearly all of the moist towelets were still moist but the actual towelets had degraded and just fell apart soon as you tried to open them. 

The powdered tea was still free flowing but  the cider mix was clumped and smelled off. Same with most of the powdered creamer.

The chewing gum was chewable but flavor didn't last long and the gum base itself rapidly hardened up.

And I'm not sure Tabasco ever goes bad, But you can see the difference between what was in the bottle and what was in the package. And there was definitely a flavor difference The bottle had that very traditional Tabasco smell and depth of flavor. While the package just had a blast of more vinegar than heat and you can see that from the consistency of it.

Anyway hope you found this interesting.

1kworfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianmedschool/comments/1kworfn/what_has_happened_to_our_medical_education/,What has happened to our medical “education “?,"I’m an intern (reputed government college) right now, in my USMLE journey and I feel more grateful each day for choosing it.

(I apologize in advance for the pessimistic views I’m about to present.) I don’t understand how our curriculum and education system became such a joke. There is no professionalism at any level whatsoever, I always thought it must be my petty batchmates or residents, but as I move ahead, I’ve realized it goes all the way. The pettiness gets worse. 
All medical students here are in a race to get the best rank possible and using such extreme means, 
I mean I understand that it’s the need of the hour but what happened to actually learning medicine? No one wants to attend lectures/postings or do internship because everyone needs to study all the damn time for 1 exam. No one is demanding for things to get better or question anything, just blindly following what is happening.
Now I’ll talk about the problems with the system. These professors and lecturers are not one bit interested in teaching or patient care(most of them) and they expect us students on the day of our practicals to know each and every clinical aspect and they retort with “Were you not taught this in your postings?”. I have not once seen any of them being interested in teaching or even bothering to ask if everything is going well. They expect their overworked residents to teach us while they finish their coffee for the day. And it just keeps getting worse. 
I wanted to do research and I needed a professor to be my guide and I had to go to atleast 4 professors before one of them took me seriously and actually helped me out. The rest of them were plain uninterested to help me out. The other time I needed to get a letter signed from an HOD, and he began the conversation by asking “who are you and what do you want” in a bitter tone. And when I mentioned I needed this letter for my USMLE, he said why would I do that for you, I don’t know you, I have not once seen you and you should finish your internship first, maybe then I’ll sign it for you. Firstly, I had been posted in his unit for my 3rd minor and major. And not once did I see him in the ward/opd in those 3 months, let alone be interested in “teaching” and he has the audacity to tell me I don’t know you? And secondly, if you don’t want to sign because you don’t know me, then why would you say finish your internship and then I’ll do it? 
Juniors here are treated like scum. We’re literally treated like nobodys and during internship, all that we learn is sampling, iv insertion. And if you’re lucky, maybe a few helpful things. 
In contrast, the clinical rotations abroad which are equivalent to our internship, we are a part of the team treating the patient, we are treated like colleagues, there is professionalism and respect. And we actually get to learn, instead of doing scut work. Everything we learn here as interns is the job of a nurse in the States. How is this helping my clinical skills? 
I’m always eager to learn even during my internship and some residents teach me out of interest, but that’s it. The professors don’t even care, they just want you to do their ward work. And by the end of MBBS, we’re supposed to just know how to be doctors and know what branch we want, when in reality, we haven’t been taught anything.

I really hate how when these seniors hear I’m preparing for MLE, they just start being so unsupportive of it. And actively hinder the process instead of helping me out. 
I’m really hopeless at the moment and I really want to learn things in my internship but I don’t know how. I’d love to hear if y’all have different, better stories, because this makes me really demotivated and sad.",22,1748356320.0,indianmedschool,8,0.92,False

1kwoqf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_stuffed_ai/comments/1kwoqf5/trending_ai_video_ideas_in_2025_concepts_examples/,"🚀 Trending AI Video Ideas in 2025: Concepts, Examples, and How to Make Them Viral","The rise of AI video tools like Veo, Runway, and Pika has opened the floodgates for creators to generate professional-looking videos without cameras, actors, or crews. As attention spans shrink and content volume explodes, creators are turning to AI to produce fast, viral, and emotionally gripping video content — especially for TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts.

But not all AI videos are made equal. In 2025, the most successful videos combine novelty, relatability, and shareability, often riding cultural trends or tapping into internet-native humor and aesthetics. Below are some of the **top trending AI video ideas** that are currently taking off — with examples and practical tips.

# 1. 🐶 Small Dogs Doing Extreme Sports

**Why It Works**: It blends two massively viral themes — cute animals + action sports. This genre feels surreal yet believable, especially when presented in a “shot on iPhone” or GoPro-style vertical format.

**Example Prompt**:

*A chihuahua with goggles is skateboarding down a staircase, does a small kickflip and lands perfectly. Crowd in the background cheers. Shot in urban daylight, realistic lighting, vertical phone footage.*

**Execution Tip**: Add text overlay like “Skater of the Year?” or “He better get sponsored 🛹” to increase relatability. Use trending dog or sports audio.



# 2. 👽 Simulation Theory & Glitches in Reality

**Why It Works**: Content about “we live in a simulation” consistently trends due to its mix of sci-fi, philosophical depth, and meme appeal. It pairs well with cinematic backroom-style visuals or creepy urban environments.

**Example Prompt**:

>*A man walks through a city street when suddenly everyone freezes. He waves, screams — no one moves. Camera pans up to a glowing sky with code-like patterns emerging. High detail, eerie lighting, vertical.*

**Execution Tip**: Use voiceovers like “I think I broke the simulation…” and layer with glitch sounds. Ideal for TikTok + Instagram Reels where user comments extend the storyline.



# 3. 🏢 Backrooms and Liminal Horror

**Why It Works**: Liminal spaces (e.g., abandoned offices, endless pools) are the new horror aesthetic. AI tools generate this look well, and short-form videos in this genre pull high engagement from fans of surreal horror.

**Example Prompt**:

>*First-person view. A person wakes up in an endless yellow office corridor. Humming fluorescent lights. They whisper: “Where am I?” They find a red button labeled RESTART.*

**Execution Tip**: Add VHS-style filters and ambient soundscapes. Keep videos under 15s to maximize replays. Use hashtags like #backrooms, #lostfootage, #liminalcore.



# 4. 🎭 Celebrity Mistakes Caught on Camera (AI Satire)

**Why It Works**: AI-generated faux paparazzi footage of celebrities doing embarrassing or chaotic things is exploding on TikTok/X. The uncanny realism combined with absurdity makes it perfect for virality.

**Example Prompt**:

>*Kylie Jenner spills coffee on a waitress and screams “I said NO sugar!” in a New York café. Chaos ensues. Shot from behind a plant like a hidden phone camera. Vertical, shaky footage.*

**Execution Tip**: Add fake news-style captions (“EXCLUSIVE: Kylie lashes out over coffee”). Use satirical or dramatic music for comedic effect.



# 5. 🤖 AI-generated “First Contact” or UFO Footage

**Why It Works**: Fake UFO sightings with raw AI generation mimic the viral feel of leaked military footage. Audiences love to guess if it’s real or not, increasing comment and share rates.

**Example Prompt**:

>*Grainy drone footage of a triangular aircraft hovering over a forest. Suddenly accelerates straight up with no sound. Military voices in background say “Code Brown. They’re here.” Shot in night vision green.*

**Execution Tip**: Make it look *just* believable enough to spark debate. Add fake timestamps, military overlays, and cut off audio at key moments to leave the ending ambiguous.



# 6. 💥 Portal Fails & AI Tech Disasters

**Why It Works**: Fictional science-gone-wrong scenarios offer humor, suspense, and mystery all in one. Think of it like short “Black Mirror” clips but with absurd outcomes.

**Example Prompt**:

>*Scientists create a teleportation portal. They throw a chair in — it comes out 10x bigger. Then, multiple portals open uncontrollably, sucking in lab equipment. Final scene: military radio “Shut it down. It’s too late.”*

**Execution Tip**: Add panic voiceovers, chaotic alarm SFX, and end with sudden cuts or static glitches. Use short 10–15s edits to simulate “found footage” pacing.



# 7. 📱 Fake iPhone Captures of Bizarre Events

**Why It Works**: Content that feels like it was caught “accidentally” on a phone camera adds authenticity and drives virality. AI lets you fake that realism perfectly.

**Example Prompt**:

>*Phone camera shows a guy filming a car, but a portal opens in the sky behind him. He turns — “Bro what the fu–” — and the video cuts. Blurry motion, 9:16, random background chatter.*

**Execution Tip**: Simulate user interface elements like iPhone zoom buttons or recording icons. Add user captions like “I can’t explain this. Just watch till the end.”

# Final Tips for Going Viral with AI Videos:

* **Use native formats**: Always render in 9:16 for Shorts, TikTok, and Reels.
* **Stick to 7–15s videos**: Quick loops = high replay value.
* **Use emotion or absurdity**: Surprise or resonate with the viewer.
* **Engage in captions**: Ask open-ended questions or dare viewers to explain what’s happening.
* **Upload across multiple accounts** with variation (slightly edited text, sound, or order) to see which ones the algorithm favors.",1,1748356254.0,u_stuffed_ai,0,1.0,False

Did I read that right? But seriously guys, my playground is bio-punk. Punches will not be pulled. You have been warned.)

The sort of people that called the Downs their home knew better than to glance twice at the odd tableau that was a small mountain of a figure making her way down The Avenue in the dead of night; a canine monstrosity balanced atop her left shoulder, blood dripping off of its shattered jaw onto the front of her raincoat.

It was a miserable night to be out and about. The steady drizzle misting its way down past broken streetlights and grimy windows meant that most businesses foolhardy enough to operate out of this particularly godforsaken sliver of Revane had long since shuttered down for the night.

Some years ago, some starry-eyed politician had tried to breath new life into the Avenue in an attempt to combat the gang presence that had begun festering in the area.

Warehouses had been repurposed into food courts, a row of fountains had been built all the way down the main thoroughfare and business licenses had been handed out like candy at a fair. The poor man had even dug into his own coffers to commission an avenue of Grafted fruit trees that blossomed every morning, and grew heavy with fruit every night. Word was, he'd hoped that they'd act as a sort of secondary draw for his little shopping utopia; sipping coffee and dunking donuts underneath the Forever Trees, and all that.

When the day came to cut the ribbon on the Avenue, the man's dismembered corpse, as well as that of his poor assistant, were found scattered and spread out all the way up and down the street.

Every headline across the city ran with the same byline; a front page spread of an uncut ribbon, dangling in the morning sun. Beneath it, the politician's severed head, posed in a grotesque facsimile of a roguish wink atop an infamous gang sign. And beneath that, in large blood-streaked letters, the words, ""WELCOME SHOPPERS!""

There had been no coming back from that. The Downs added another notch to its belt, and the Shepherds kept their territory.

The figure paused momentarily, turning her considerable bulk to look past a small mound of refuse caught in the flickering glare of a storefront sign. Old graffiti glistened in the shape of a set of lupine incisors. The mark of the Shepherds.

Dumping her cargo next to a long disused fountain, she tested the stone work's integrity with her foot. Satisfied, she sat, scrunching her nose up a little at the mild hint of urine emanating from the fountain's stagnant pool.

Angling her rain coat's hood to keep away the worst of the drizzle, she rummaged inside her coat pocket for a few seconds, before eventually pulling out a small brown bag.

Something shifted to her right.

Emerging from the gloom of the fountain, on the side shadowed by one of the blinking streetlight above, a filthy figure, seemingly emboldened by the hint of food in the offing, held out his palms in timid supplication. Scars winked at her all along his emaciated palms and forearms where the man had taken on all sorts of crude Carvings. A Bloodletter, then. Probably surviving off of the trees.

The figure grinned, an expression that rightfully sowed the first hints of doubt somewhere in the clouded vacancies that were the beggar's eyes, and fully germinated when the giant of a woman pulled down the sides of the brown bag to reveal its contents: a severed hand, with a conspicuously mouth shaped chunk missing off of its side and a tattoo on its back that mirrored the tag that'd shed spied earlier.

Panic settled in, shaving the blunt edges off of the dullness in his eyes for a moment. He watched as she raised the bag to her mouth, revealing a double row of predatory teeth, and took a bite, her gaze never leaving his face.

She chewed, her foot resting on the humongous dog's haunches.

""You're not running.""

He shook his head.

""Not used to that."" She took another bite.

Her voice didn't sound like what you'd expect. The local monsters out here, those hired by the Shepherds and the other gangs to flex their muscle and push the locals around, never knew when to stop when it came to augments. Otis; for instance, down on Meat Row, had his voice carved to make you want to piss yourself every time he so much as growled.

This one didn't sound anything like that. Rather, she sounded like voice of an athlete he'd heard promoting some kind of protein shake a lifetime ago. Lively. Almost performative.

Still chewing, she waved the hand around. ""This fucker took something that belongs to me. Came here to get it back.""

The beggar blinked at her, resisting the urge to wipe away the sticky droplets of...fluid that got on his neck and face every time she gesticulated.

She spat out a finger bone.

""Know where I can find them?""

Fifteen minutes later, Bear found herself in a dark alley, her new friend standing passively to the side as the lookout positioned therein struggled and clawed against her forearm, his face completely engulfed in the palm of her hand. Tenacious bastard was taking too long to suffocate, so with a judicious twist of her wrist, she ended his struggles and let him crumple onto the ground.

Dead Eyes stared at her as she picked up her canine cargo once more, and sniffed the air.

""That's the last of them. At least out here."" She sniffed the air some more. ""Bunch of them in there though.""

Situated at the tail end of the street, nesting in the gloom of a dozen broken streetlights, one of the refurbished warehouses pulsed with the light and sound of the sort of establishment where mistakes were made in abundance. A small crowd of individuals stood in a loose line outside its industrial sized double doors, negotiating with a pair of oversized bouncers, behind which a Carved dog-even large than the one she bore on her shoulder-stood vigil.

Bear looked down at her strange companion and grinned, her teeth glinting in the dark and stained with the evidence of her more recent meals.

""You weren't kidding. They aren't trying to hide at all.""

Dead Eyes shook his head.

""You gonna stick around and watch?""

He shook his head again.

""Aw shucks, don't be like that. Tell you what, if you wait for me right here until I'm done, whatever drops they've got stashed in there, they're yours."" She stooped a little and patted the top of his head. ""Would you like that, my junkie friend?"" She cooed. ""Would you like to break whatever's left of your tired little mind?""

Dead Eyes didn't respond. But when she stepped away, he stayed where he was, staring vacantly at nothing.

""Good boy.""

Bear stepped out of the alley way.  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Bear felt the familiar burn as her Carvings kicked into action all along her spine and gullet. Making her way down the shadowed street, she could feel herself grow in size and bulk up as she converted her food stores into muscle and mass.

It was the simplest and least subtle of her tricks, but that was OK.

The dog reacted first, ears perking and rousing off its haunches as it caught her scent. One of the guard said something in a strange accent, before the both of them began to look around.

Grabbing the dog on her shoulder by its neck to stabilize it, she laughed as both of her hearts kicked into high gear and adrenalin surged through her system. She begun to run.

Squinting through the drizzle, they caught her advance as she charged down the street. One of them barked something at the dog growling behind their back, and it rushed out to meet her.

Bear picked up her pace, a phenomenon that the couch sized dog must not have been used to, as a hint of hesitancy bled into its pace. Still, it charged at it her, legs pumping and drool slobbering, before it judged the distance close enough and leapt at her, teeth bared.

Bear felt her new tendons strain as her left foot bit into the asphalt, cratering a section of the road as she adjusted her trajectory just enough for the beast to sail just past her, but not before she twisted her head to the side and ripped out its throat with her teeth.

She didn't stop to watch where it landed as she swallowed and the Carvings in her throat got to work, flooding her with information: Three other dogs, one of them much much larger than the others, master's new cologne irritating her nose, yesterdays lunch, the taste of fear as it realized it was going to die, sleepy longing for its kennel as it reluctantly accompanied master out into the rain, the scent of a new batch of puppies...

Bear grinned at that last one. So these \*were\* the bastards that had stolen her newly adopted rescue from the pound...

The pair at the front of the warehouse wasted precious seconds panicking, as they tried to pull something out of their waistbands.

""Nope."" Bear arrived, her momentum sending not a few unfortunate members of the crowd standing outside flying, and one screaming as she fell and bore the weight of Bear's passage on her shapely back. Bear swung her cargo like a baseball bat, wielding its neck like a hilt. The first one, the one who'd yelled something at the dog, ducked in time, throwing himself down onto the ground. The second one made a wet sound as he collided with the double doors.

Bear pivoted, turning her makeshift weapon in a large arc. Turning on the balls of her feet, she brought the creature down on the man's legs. The man howled. Bear laughed.

""Your dog hated your cologne, by the way.""

She stomped and the howling stopped.

The doors to the warehouse exploded outwards as a storm of teeth and claws charged out to meet her.  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

It took a while for the denizens schmoozing and gyrating inside the Shepherd's warehouse club to parse what the correct reaction was to a  gigantic dog sailing across the dance floor like a guided missile, bearing not a few tables and bodies in its wake.

But when the even larger monstrosity that was the woman that followed in their wake, made her presence known by laughing uproariously as she strode into the club, another of the Shepherd's infamous monster dogs dangling on her barrel sized wrist as it attempted to worry it, a conclusion was arrived at.

Pandemonium broke.

Bear barely noticed the bodies streaming past her as she lifted the dog up to get a better look at it, all the while still gripping its long dead companion by its throat.

This one looked to be more or less the same body type. Did these guys have a preference for mongrels?

She spied the Carvings on its chest and the back of its head. The workmanship was actually...not that bad. Someone in these guys' payroll knew what they were on about.

Probably why they raided the pound, she thought as she casually snapped its neck and pulled it off her wrist. Almost passively, she redirected some of her stored mass into patching up the damage.

The club was emptying out quickly, and, as she looked up into the nosebleeds, she felt her hearts race as she caught a glimpse of a man with both hands on the railing. The rings on his hands looked as expensive as the bottle he held deceptively casually as he glared down at her.

The darkness behind him shifted as a truly colossal dog eclipsed the VIP area's strobing lights and rumbled a challenge. On each of its incisors, Carvings glistened.

""Who in the ever loving fuck are you?"", the man called down.

All around her, down on the dance floor, weapons bristled and knives shone. Music pulsed.

No more civilians left huh? Bear felt the heat from her spine and gullet spread in earnest.

""I'm a dog mom."" With a manic grin, she pointed whatever remained of her grisly makeshift weapon up into the balcony in a mock salute. ""And I'm here to get my girl back.""

I've of course become older (40) and but I did have several serious partners from OLD over the years.

I of course need to utilize other means of meeting people, but don't want to give up entirely on OLD. I think maybe the popularity of OLD has partly waned b/c you need to spend so much money just to access most the basic functions on the apps? It's made for a horrible experience.

All of the buds that were previously closed have bloomed and look beautiful, but one is dry and discolored on the outer petals and won't bloom any further. I haven't been able to find the answers I need on Google. Can it be saved? 

Ways I care for it: 

- Crushed egg shells and coffee grounds on the soil (to keep cats and bugs out). I sprinkled black pepper for extra protection against cats becauae I read that it's non-toxic to the plant. These measures work great and cats dom't touch it.
- Daily watering if needed. I was told that the soil should be moist but not wet(?)
- Miracle Gro plant food once every two weeks

I do want to move to a bigger planter soon. I actually already moved it into this one from an way smaller one but it's outgrowing the new one fast. Could that be the cause of this? 

I'm still new to keeping plants in general so I'll take as much advice as I can get. Thanks in advance!
