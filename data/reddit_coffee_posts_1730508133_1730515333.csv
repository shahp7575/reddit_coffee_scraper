I am  the guy in front of the red woman. I am an actor based out of Toronto, and I wanted to share this to anyone who feels they are down on their luck.

I booked this background work, and have appeared as an extra in other shows, but this was my first film and the set and environment was incredible.

Prior to shooting this, I was (and still am) flat broke. I remember I initially couldn‚Äôt even do the film because I was working a retail job and the manager wouldn‚Äôt move my schedule around. 

I had 0.70 in my bank account and couldn‚Äôt afford to pay metro. I ran from Yorkdale mall to downtown Toronto in work boots to make the shoot and was fired from my job. Yes I continued for continuity and though it weighed on my mind the anxiety of not having income again, being on set is like a drug that dissolves my anxiety and sorrow. 

I love this craft, and not for a second will I ever be ungrateful to work in any capacity. I have so many stories about having less than 10 dollars in my account, and then getting that cheque in the mail for a couple hundred.

I had my total thyroidectomy a week ago yesterday. I ended up being very hypocalcemic, and had a good amount of pain. But despite those two things, every morning (starting 2 days post op) I woke up feeling GOOD. Like incredibly good, like a normal person. My heart rate was stable at 65 with no beta blocker all day. I didn't get winded. I didn't sweat my ass off just sitting in my house. I didn't have extreme joint pain and muscle aches. I didn't have a constant headache. I didn't have nausea. I didn't have tremors. I didn't feel OFF. For the first time in as long as I can remember, I felt like I was ON. 

Anyways. Yesterday I woke up, and it was like I time traveled and I had my thyroid again. I felt absolutely awful. Palpitations, nausea, splitting headache, body aches, feeling weak af, etc. I got tested, and I have the flu. But it felt so similar to graves. 

It made me think. I had been living my life waking up like I've had the flu every God damn day (+ some symptoms). How insane is that? I obviously knew I was struggling, but this situation just put it into perspective just how bad I was feeling. I grew so accustomed to feeling so sick all the time that I didn't realize exactly how abnormal life was living like that. 

Anywhoooo. Today I woke up feeling incredible again. No idea how I fought off the flu symptoms so fast (I'm guessing bc I had the vax), but wow. I spent my day giving my dogs baths, I cleaned my house, did laundry, and sat outside in the heat and sun reading a book and drinking a coffee. Oh then I did the dishes, and made dinner, and now I'm relaxing with a glass of wine. These are all things I couldn't do before. 

I just want everyone to know there is hope. Know there will be happy, healthy days ahead. We can fight this disease, whether through meds, lifestyle changes, treatments, or surgeries, we can do it. Hang on tight on those bad days. There will be good days. üå∏",3,1730514873.0,gravesdisease,1,1.0,False

Musically I'm into metalcore, power Noize, aggrotech, EBM, death rock, black metal, Goa trance, 70s hard rock, 80s synth pop, classical music and dark wave. I'm a goth, what can I say? But I also love Rihanna and Kendrick Lamar, so there's that. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

My perfect Friday night involves me lying on my couch with a cup of tea, cuddling with my plushies and playing Stardew Valley, while listening to some nerdy podcast about military history, comic books or pro wrestling (yes, I'm a wrestling nerd).

I can't really go out the way I used to because of anxiety around cis folk as well as nerve damage in my leg (I can't stand for very long without pain), but I like having dinner, going to see a play or just sitting around in the park.

I‚Äôm totally open to friendships with people of all ages/stages of life with and without kids but I feel stuck on how to actually develop meaningful relationships. I work remotely for my job which is great, but obviously makes it hard to make work friends 

Things I‚Äôve tried so far:
- a couple of volunteer groups
- going to coffee shops and the library to work
- meetup.com (seems dead these days?)
- going to neighborhood block parties and bringing a dish
- tomorrow I‚Äôm going to force myself to go to a yoga class

I think things I‚Äôve run into:
- I‚Äôm not great at striking up smalltalk with strangers. I want to get better but I really have no idea. 
- when I force myself to start talking to people I don‚Äôt get the sense that they want to talk to me. 
- the people who do seem to try to have a conversation tend to be people I have nothing in common with. 

I guess I just want:
- to hear a happy story or two from women who have successfully made friends in their 30s and 40s
- new ideas on places to try
- new ideas on conversation starters (please help spell it out for me I‚Äôm hopeless haha)",2,1730514646.0,AskWomenOver40,0,1.0,False

What has helped me the most is cutting out triggers (chocolate, coffee, gluten), drinking coconut milk several times per day, taking zinc carnosine daily, and using calcium carbonate as needed. My  stomach and throat was burning horribly every few weeks for the last year, and I tried so many different angles to combat this issue, but the zinc and coconut milk combo seems to help the most. Something about the zinc carnosine helps heal and strengthen my gastric lining, and the coconut milk feels like it coats and soothes it.

Park Ranger TOLD EVERYTHING,"The Vermont forest was a spectacle of colors, especially that autumn. But even with the beauty surrounding me, there was an unease in my chest. I, Christian Parker, a thirty-year-old forest ranger, had chosen this isolated life, far from the hustle and bustle of the city. My small, simple cabin was surrounded by towering trees that seemed to watch my every move.



That October morning was cold. The thick fog concealed the world around me, and an oppressive silence filled the air. As I sipped my coffee, a growing worry settled in my mind. There had been rumors about something strange in the forest: unexplained noises and sightings of animals behaving erratically. I had heard stories from visitors who couldn‚Äôt pinpoint the source of their unease.



‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôm just overreacting,‚Äù I thought, trying to shake off the feeling that something was wrong. After preparing myself, I grabbed my backpack and a flashlight, determined to investigate the complaints. The trail was blanketed with fallen leaves, and the light filtering through the fog cast everything in a more ominous shade.



As I walked, the familiarity of the forest began to fade. Each step echoed, and the trees seemed to close in around me. A growing discomfort settled in, as if the trees knew something I didn‚Äôt. The calm I once appreciated now felt like a trap. I recalled what some old-timers used to say about the forest, that it held secrets. But I was a skeptic. Still, the shadows cast by the fog kept me on edge.



In the clearing where I usually rested, something caught my attention. An abandoned campsite stretched before me: torn tents and scattered gear. The scene was disturbing. What could have happened to those who had been there? The atmosphere around me was thick with a dark feeling. My instincts screamed at me to leave, but curiosity held me in place.



I decided it was time to go back. The path was darker than before, and a sense of urgency propelled me forward. Along the trail, a distant roar cut through the silence. Panic seized me. My muscles tensed. Looking back, I saw a shadow moving between the trees.



I tried to calm myself, but the image of that shadow wouldn‚Äôt leave my mind. With adrenaline coursing through my veins, I ran, my heart pounding in my chest. When I reached the cabin, I slammed the door shut, breathing heavily. The place I called home now felt like a temporary refuge, and the forest outside had transformed into a hostile space.



I called the sheriff, struggling to articulate what I had witnessed. ‚ÄúChristian, stay at home. We need to investigate,‚Äù he replied, his deep voice reflecting concern. ‚ÄúThere have been reports of disappearances in the area.‚Äù



Those words lingered over me. The forest, once a shelter, had become a battleground against something unknown. The stories I had dismissed as mere legends now seemed all too real. Fear began to seep into everything, like a dark shroud that wouldn‚Äôt dissipate. The sensation of being watched intensified. It was clear that the forest was not just a place to work; it was a mystery to unravel.



The Vermont forest was more than just a job for me; it was a living entity, breathing and pulsating with secrets. The tall, dense trees intertwined in the sky, creating a natural ceiling that filtered the light and turned the atmosphere into a play of light and shadow. Over time, I learned to identify every sound and movement. The creaking of branches, the rustling of leaves‚Äîeverything told a story. And I felt like an intruder in this territory.



My days were filled with routine tasks: checking trails, cleaning campgrounds, and ensuring visitors respected the rules. I always maintained a firm stance, projecting a friendly yet authoritative demeanor when dealing with tourists. However, there was something deeper in the forest that I couldn‚Äôt quite pinpoint, something lurking in the shadows. The local legends spoke of spirits wandering among the trees, of lost souls seeking peace. The older residents, like Mr. Jenkins, an elderly man who often appeared at the convenience store, shared tales of disappearances and strange encounters.



‚ÄúYou need to respect the forest, kid,‚Äù he would say, looking at me with his piercing blue eyes. I used to laugh it off, thinking they were just stories to scare kids. Yet, with every visit I made to the forest, Jenkins‚Äô words echoed in my mind. There was something in the shadows that awakened a primitive part of me, a feeling that something was watching my presence.



My life before becoming a forest ranger was different. I worked in an office, surrounded by concrete and noise, and the idea of trading that for the serenity of the forest seemed like a clear choice. But now, the tranquility I once sought was turning into anxiety. It wasn‚Äôt just the beauty of nature that drew me in, but the quest for answers. What lay behind the stories circulating? What really happened in the darkness of the forest?



It was on one of those uncertain days that I met Sarah, a young environmentalist who had come to the area to study the local ecosystem. She was the antithesis of what I expected to find in the forest. Intelligent, independent, and with a smile that brightened even the cloudiest days, she quickly became an unexpected ally. From our very first meeting, during a talk I gave to a group of students, I felt an instant connection.



‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt believe in the legends, do you?‚Äù she asked, a mischievous glint in her eyes. I hesitated before answering. ‚ÄúI think every legend has a basis in truth,‚Äù I replied, trying to sound skeptical. Sarah was passionate about wildlife, dedicating her time to protecting natural habitats and studying local fauna. With her, I learned to appreciate the forest in a new way, to see the beauty in the complexity of natural systems.



As we grew closer, Sarah began mentioning strange behaviors in the animals of the region, as if they were reacting to something. ‚ÄúHave you noticed how the birds don‚Äôt sing here anymore?‚Äù she said one time, gazing at the overcast sky. ‚ÄúAnd the deer? They‚Äôre disappearing.‚Äù



Her words resonated with me. The animals I used to observe frequently now seemed scarce, as if fleeing from an invisible threat. The forest, once vibrant, was transforming into a sinister place, and the stories that had been mere myths were becoming urgent and real.



In the following days, the environment around us seemed to change. The trails grew darker, and the sounds that filled the air became oppressive. Sarah and I decided to investigate together. Armed with flashlights and recorders, we ventured into the forest one night. The darkness was thick, and the silence was almost deafening. The beams of light cut through the fog, revealing the familiar shapes of trees, but also creating shadows that seemed to move.



‚ÄúIt's just our imagination, right?‚Äù I asked, trying to ease the tension. But Sarah's expression said otherwise. She was apprehensive, alert to every sound. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something here,‚Äù she murmured, almost to herself.



With each step, the feeling that something was watching us intensified. Then, we stumbled upon something that would change everything: a clearing, an abandoned campsite. The scene was disturbing. Torn tents and scattered gear suggested the campers had fled in a hurry. It was not a safe place.



‚ÄúWe should turn back,‚Äù I suggested, but curiosity held her back. Before I could protest, Sarah was already inspecting the markings in the ground. ‚ÄúLook at this. What do you think happened here?‚Äù



The tension became palpable. The trees seemed to lean toward us, as if they were about to reveal their secrets. We decided it was time to leave, but as we stepped away, the fog began to close in, and the way back grew darker.



It was a critical moment. The forest I thought I knew was changing, and each passing day revealed more secrets. Sarah and I were about to enter a deadly game where the stakes were real, and the legends might be more than just stories.



The forest, once a peaceful refuge, had turned into hostile territory. The tension between me and nature grew daily, and what was once familiar now felt impenetrable. Sarah's visits became more frequent, and our conversations revolved around strange sightings and the increasing distress of the locals.



‚ÄúBen, I can't stop thinking about that clearing. What happened there?‚Äù Sarah asked, her voice heavy with concern as we walked along a steep trail. The sky was gray, and a fog began to form, obscuring our view.



‚ÄúMaybe we should leave it behind. What we found doesn‚Äôt seem good,‚Äù I replied, trying to maintain logic amid the growing unease. But a part of me knew that running away wasn‚Äôt an option. The mystery consumed me, and Sarah's curiosity pulled me deeper into the abyss.



That night, I couldn't sleep. Memories of the abandoned campsite replayed in my mind, each detail more vivid. A sense that we were being watched grew, becoming a constant pressure in my chest. At 3 a.m., I grabbed my flashlight and decided to patrol the area near my lodging. The air was cold, and the fog was thick.



As I stepped off the main trail, I realized the sounds of the forest had vanished. The crickets, which had once filled the night with their chirping, were silent. The darkness seemed to swallow everything around me. With each step, the tension escalated. Then, I heard a noise, a kind of snap. My heart raced. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù I shouted, but only the echo of my own voice answered.



As I explored, I saw something that made me stop. A shadow moved between the trees, like a silhouette. I tried to convince myself it was just my imagination, but the figure looked real. I wasn‚Äôt alone. I decided to turn back, but when I did, the shadow vanished.



The next morning, I found Sarah in the kitchen of the lodge. She was studying maps, her face tense. ‚ÄúYou felt it too, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù she asked without looking up.



‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I replied, trying to hide my own fear.



‚ÄúThe animals. They‚Äôre disappearing. I saw deer fleeing the area. Something is wrong, Ben.‚Äù She looked me in the eye, and for the first time, I realized the situation was more serious than I had imagined.



‚ÄúWe need to investigate further. If something is affecting the animals, it might help us understand what‚Äôs happening here,‚Äù she said, determined.



We decided to return to the clearing. The forest felt different that morning. The wind blew restlessly, as if whispering warnings. When we arrived at the campsite, the tension was palpable. The clearing didn‚Äôt look the same; something had changed. The tents were even more torn, and the ground appeared dirtier, as if a weight had been added.



‚ÄúBen, look at this,‚Äù Sarah said, pointing to deep marks in the earth. They weren‚Äôt natural; something had been dragged through here. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt good.‚Äù



Before we could investigate further, a deafening sound echoed through the forest. It was a noise like a scream, but distorted, as if someone were being called back. ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù I asked, panic rising within me.



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, but we need to get out of here,‚Äù Sarah replied, her voice trembling. We began to back away, but the noise grew louder, reverberating among the trees.



In the rush to escape, I lost my footing and fell into a muddy puddle. ‚ÄúBen!‚Äù Sarah shouted, reaching out to help me up. As I managed to regain my balance, I noticed she was staring at something behind me, her face pale.



‚ÄúLook!‚Äù she pointed, and I turned around. A figure was standing between the trees, but it wasn‚Äôt a person. It was an indistinct silhouette, vague outlines that seemed to twist and shift. The legs were not clearly defined, and the arms appeared to elongate and shrink. The sight paralyzed me.



‚ÄúCome on, quick!‚Äù I shouted, pulling her away. Running down the trail, the echo of the scream we heard earlier still resonated in our ears like a warning. Fear propelled us forward, but the forest seemed to close in around us, and the familiar sounds turned threatening.



When we finally made it back to the lodge, I slammed the door behind us, my heart still racing. Fear hung in the air between us, an oppressive cloud. ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù I asked, trying to catch my breath.



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. But I feel like we‚Äôre in danger. Something is happening in the forest, and it‚Äôs not just about the animals,‚Äù Sarah replied, her voice steady despite the panic.



The truth began to settle in. This wasn‚Äôt just an investigation; it was a fight for survival. We were entangled in something larger, something we didn‚Äôt fully understand. Time passed, but the feeling that something was wrong only intensified.



In the days that followed, we decided to gather information. Among the locals, we found an old man named Thompson, who knew the darkest stories of the area. ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be here,‚Äù he said, his gaze distant. ‚ÄúThe forest doesn‚Äôt like to be disturbed. Many have disappeared here. Some came back, but they weren‚Äôt the same.‚Äù",0,1730513899.0,u_Illustrious-Nail-652,0,0.5,False

It coincides with when I started taking gym more seriously and eating more protein.
My body just seems to not tolerate well increased amount of protein. For reference I would try to consume 90-100g a day. I couldn't get in more, I would be very bloated and painfully full.
I tried not caring about protein for a few days and the difference was crazy. It was so much better. However I still have to drink my probiotics and a ton of water. And when I say a ton of water, it's a TON. I go pee almost every hour, it's so tiring. And I can't drink coffee or strong matcha because it dehydrates me and makes me constipated as well. 
Now I'm having another hemorroid flare up and I'm waiting for my doctor's appointment in 3 weeks to fix that. Until then Im doing my best to avoid constipation by eating lots of fiber and not too much protein, but even with that my hemorrhoid keeps getting irritated and I need to use stool softener for a few days to calm it down. 
To be honest I'm just exhausted. The pain, the stress every day when going to the bathroom, the wandering why is this happening to me. I finally managed to get consistent with my gym routine and I got so excited that I might reach my fitness goal but now because of my diet I don't know if I will be anymore.

The people on normals help with the admin side so that the person on late does not get held up after work.

Several weeks where I was on late, the group of girls would vanish for hours. This often lead to me being held up after work and having to stay behind. If the manager was WFH, the girls would scarcely be in the lab, leaving me and another guy to do everything. It was a high capacity workload and we were extremely stressed. One day, the other lad wasn't in, and I was left for 45 minutes alone while the girls went on lunch break together (despite the rule that two people were required in the lab at peak times.) They began taking extra breaks throughout the day, going over the allotted time on their lunch breaks and, when the manager was WFH spending a ton of time in her office, claiming to be doing admin work. I entered once to ask for help and found 3 of them cuddled up on one chair. The computers were off and there was no paperwork out. I felt like it was putting more stress on myself and the other guy, but one of the girls in this group was also my best friend. I hung out with her frequently and didn't want to dob her in it.

So I let her know that it was bothering me and that I felt like this was putting a lot of stress on us. She apologised and said this would be sorted (she was also technically the lab senior) but it never was. I brought it up one more time to her, but once again, nothing changed.¬†

So the girl who was my close friend mentioned that they were going to sneak out and go for a coffee. She asked me if I wanted to come,¬† I agreed. We were not supposed to leave the lab unmanned. We got back about 20 minutes later. The manager found out about this. The following day, I was called up to speak to the manager who raised concerns that I had not been pulling my weight in the lab, and that it had been noted to her that I had left the lab unmanned and left work to go to costa. I admitted I did this, but explained that I was not the only one who had gone. I did not mention names, but expressed that lack of professionalism and general lack of productivity was a lab wide issue. I wasn't trying to get anybody else in trouble. But I didn't want to be a scapegoat when I wasn't even a main perpetrator. The manager mentioned that it would be brought up in the team meeting.

I went back to the lab and told everyone the whole story. The others in the lab got angry with me, called me a snitch, my close friend said our friendship was done, that she could lose her promotion over this, and that I had betrayed her trust. Even the other lad in the lab who wasn't involved with any of this (which I told the manager), called me sly and said I handled this in the complete wrong way. After a very unproductive team meeting with finger pointing and blaming, my friendship with these people was lost permanently.

We had an amazing weekend, he was so loving, saying i was irreplaceable, talking about marriage and kids, i would wake up to him holding me, it was perfect. We have had a couple of fights in the past few weeks but we always resolved them and ended up stronger. We did have a bad patch where he did pretty much break up with me but he took it back a few days later (it wasnt a proper break up we were still talking, but i went over to his house for him to do it in person and thats when he said he loved me and wanted to stay together) and that was like 3-4 months ago. Two nights ago he came home in a really bad mood, saying he wasn't feeling like himself, so i gave him space and was laying in bed ready for sleep, thats when he said that he was in a bad mood because on the way home he was hoping to be by himself which really hurt because me staying that night was his idea and i went out of my way to go to his that night. I got really upset at him saying the thing that hurts me the most is not being wanted because of things in my past and then we went to sleep upset at each other as much as i begged him not to end the night on a sour note. Things were tense when we woke up, we didn't talk and he went and sat on the couch while i stayed in bed, he made me a coffee but that was it. Then he came and sat down on the bed and we talked, he said he felt i deserved someone better (he hasn't always been the best boyfriend and at times he has treated me very poor and i have had to beg for the bare minimum but i still love him so much) and that I shouldn't have to deal with him going into his little phases that are almost bipolar where he's just shitty, but i said i was used to them which i am and he said i shouldn't have to be. I cried at lot and i begged him to not do it and try and fix it but he wouldn't budge. He said he didn't trust me anymore either because of an incident that happened on his phone, this is a long story but ill keep it short, I don't know what came over me but he was having a nap and i just felt and urge to go on his phone, so i decided to check my insta of his phone and went into his DMs to click my profile (i do it that way idk why its just easier) i found messages to a girl from when we were in a bad place where he flirted back with her after she replied he was so handsome to his story, all he said was really with a winky face and a tongue sticking out and then laughed when she said she wanted to marry him, it really hurt me when i found it so i confronted him, but i fake found it again so he didn't think i went on his phone which he caught me out on, he knew he was in the wrong and apologised and blocked her but he was mad at me for lying to him about going on his phone and said if i had just asked i could have, i knew what i did was wrong and i felt so bad but that was 3 weeks ago and i thought he would move past it. anyways after it happened i grabbed some of my stuff, cried and he came and hugged me and pulled me onto the bed for a long hug, there was some kissing and ect..... But we both knew that was for the last time. Im still snapping him but for the first time since we started snapping its been blank snaps, which feels weird because we're usually having a conversation. Im going back to his in two days to grab the rest of my stuff and i just want to know if anyone thinks there a chance he takes me back, has anything similar happened to anyone else, because i still love him so much, he's my first love and i know he had a long term relationship in the past where he took his ex back after a month, but is it worth holding out hope?

Edit: i have also come to the conclusion after seeing a lot of stuff online that i have an anxious attachment and he has an avoidant attachment, if he is avoidant could that mean he realises he made a mistake later on because ive heard that can happen.  ",1,1730512910.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Scam? Legit? Where do they sleep at night?

Are you a sympathetic person? I want to believe that's enough for anybody, like it was for me. Not that I know for sure where I'm going. I just know it's kind.

I'm in just my mid twenties, but through dedication and sheer whatever, I landed the prestigious position of pawn shop manager at the edge of town. Maybe you've heard of it. Darnell's  Electroknickknacks. Yeah. Well, Darnell, the owner, is a dad, so at least we know where his sense of humor comes from.

I'm just boring old Donald, yeah our store's name is weird, I can give you thirty for this flat screen TV.

I got calls at that job from time to time, but not often. Just someone asking me for a ballpark figure on a price for something they wanted to sell. Most of the time it's sorry, gotta bring it in or else we can't give a number. Why are you cursing at me. Get off the damn phone.

Sorry, I probably sound soulless and bored. I'm actually the opposite. I'm in shock. Good? Bad? You decide.

I got a call on Friday, but it wasn't the usual. The voice on the other end was a woman's voice, very gentle and smooth as though she were a topnotch therapist trying to reassure me that I would be able to get through some horrible trauma. The phone didn't have her number on it.

""Hello,"" she said immediately when I picked up, before I could say it first. ""Donald Carlson?""

""That's me. Are we getting popular?"" I was a bit surprised at the thought. I was content working here, it helped with my naturally laid back lifestyle, but we were kind of on the dead end side of things. Quiet in the store half the time.

""I didn't call about your store, Donny. I wanted to ask you something very important.""

I frowned into the phone. ""Is this about taxes or something? I'm only the store manager. I don't own it.""

""Donny, please, try to focus. Not your store. This is about you. It's very important.""

I was beginning to feel nervous. ""What's going on? Who are you?""

""My name is Emelie. Donny, I need to ask for something from you. A donation, if you're willing.""

Oh. It was THAT kind of call. But how had Emelie known my name? If she'd guessed Darnell, that would be no surprise, but I just worked here. How had she known I would be the one to answer the phone?

""Really,"" I muttered. Why not at least see what she meant? ""What do you have in mind?"" *A hundred bucks I'm not willing to shovel away,* I thought. I'm not selfish, but I'm not giving anything to some weirdo caller like this, and definitely not anything substantial.

""Would you be willing to give just one dollar to someone who needs it more, Donny?""

I furrowed my brow. ""You want my card number for a dollar? Get real.""

""I don't need your information. Just a yes or a no, and that's all."" She sounded painstakingly patient, and I had to admit, that was pretty dedicated. Most scammers would give up at overdone sarcasm, or at least be cussing me out by now.

""Oh. Uh, I don't know how that works, but sure. Fine by me."" I was smirking. How in the world would she get it without any of my account info?

""Yes, Donny? Is that your answer?""

""Yes."" I rolled my eyes, but kept the impatience out of my voice.

""Thank you,"" she whispered. ""Thank you so much."" And she hung up.

For about five seconds I tried not to burst out laughing in the middle of the store. What the hell had that been?

And suddenly a cold pit filled my stomach. The YES. There was a scam out there for collecting voice clips, wasn't there? And the word ""yes"" in someone's voice could be used to make a purchase in their name? I didn't have any apps or accounts that operated off of me doing that, and the whole rumor could have just been fearmongering and stupidity, but suddenly I felt like I didn't want to take a chance.

I logged into my bank account at once, looking for the support number to see if I could ask them about the possibility of the scam, and change my cards if need be.

There was a small message just below the big display of the few hundred bucks in my checking account.

*Thank you Donny.*

I clicked on my checking account, feeling a sharp zing in my chest, that mini heart attack feeling that something real bad's about to happen.

The latest transaction...it was one dollar.

No description. No destination.

Just one dollar taken. By someone or something invisible.

Who the hell...suddenly I heard a tapping on the window next to the counter. I turned in confusion, and saw a young girl standing outside. She was a little scuffed up, as though she'd been outside for a long time. Messy dark hair. Faint smears of dirt on her face. Clothes stained, some edges frayed. Face a little gaunt, not alarmingly so as though she were truly starving, but she definitely looked a bit malnourished.

She had both hands behind her back, smiling up at me, her face the very picture of admiration, as though she'd found a long lost friend, or a guardian angel. I blinked and stared at her, then slowly raised my hand in an awkward, short wave.

In response, she reached into her pocket, keeping the other hand still behind her back, and pulled out a white rectangle of paper. A receipt. I leaned forward to read it.

*Hubert's Hot Dogs! Get 'em while they're hot!*

*Jumbo Frankie Meal Deal! One dollar for the Big Bread Frankie with chili and cheese and a bottle of ice water! One lucky day a month only!*

She reached out with her other hidden hand.

A white shopping bag. She reached in and pulled out a large, long aluminum foil wrapped hot dog. A jumbo sized bottle of water with ice cubes in it came out next.

She was staring at me with her hot dog and water, smiling so big she could have been on a Christmas card. Tears flowing down her cheeks.

*Thank you.* Her lips formed the words. Staring at me as though I were her hero.

Then she turned and ran off.

I'll admit, I was shocked. I logged back into my account and looked at the transaction again.

It was no longer blank. Now the destination was *HuDog+MainTrans+Carolina,* and the description was *Hubert's Jumbo Frankie Meal Deal.*

As though the money had gone through right away, but to whom, had been decided only after it had already been paid.

I logged out, stunned. I looked at the window again, and there was nothing. She was, I figured, probably gone forever, and I'd never see her again. She couldn't have been the voice on the phone, though. That had been a grown woman. Maybe my age, maybe ten years older, no idea from just a voice. But that tiny kid? No way it had been her.

But my heart was kind of glowing, though. You ever get that feeling, when you do something wonderful and can actually see the gratitude from someone? The way you keep that with you for a while? Not an egotistical *I'm a freakin' saint* kind of feeling, but more of an *oh damn, I actually made a homeless child's day* kind of feeling.

And then it hit me. *A homeless child.* Shit, I couldn't just let her run off like that! Couldn't I call someone? Maybe take her to the police? Could they help find her a home? Or did she already have parents and a home and only looked bad because things weren't so good for her? The more I thought about it, the more mixed up I became. I'd never been in a situation like this.

So I told Ernie, one of my floor employees. He was a few years younger than me, paying for college, but wise beyond his years. He seemed as baffled as I was, and I guess I'm just grateful he believed the story.

""Nothing you can do, dude. The cops might go searching for a kid like what you describe, maybe they'll find her, maybe they won't. But the system, it fails kids more often than we want to acknowledge. Besides, if that chick knew this was going to happen, then that kid probably already has her watching over her. Maybe it was her mom or something. I dunno. Maybe this was just some cheapo feel-good scam.""

I hadn't considered that. The little girl probably already had a guardian. That woman on the phone could have been her mom, or her older sister, and besides, she *had* known my money was going to the kid, hadn't she?

Was leaving it there the right choice? I don't know. I'm not filled with worldly knowledge or a KFC-sized bucketful of common sense about every possible difficult situation I could find myself in. But that was what I did. If anything, if she had really needed my help, she wouldn't have run off with such joy on her face, would she?

For a week, nothing else happened. And then, Friday again, right after I came back from lunch, the phone rang.

I opened my mouth to greet the customer, and got the instant ""Hello? Donald Carlson?""

My stomach sort of squeezed in on itself. Her again. Was this a good thing? Was I going to help another child get a meal somehow? Everything happening around me was perfectly mundane, almost completely ordinary, but I was filled with the sense of something wonderful, almost supernatural.

""It's me."" My voice sounded dry and hoarse.

""Donny, it's me again. Emelie. Everything worked out well before, and I was wondering if we could do this again. Would you be willing to make a donation?""

I paused for a moment. ""Sure, a bit more this time?""

She seemed to hesitate. I could almost hear her holding her breath; the other side of the line had suddenly gone quiet.

""One minute,"" she said softly.

""Oh. Uh yeah, no problem,"" I stammered. ""I'll be here.""

""No, Donny, I mean...one minute. Can you donate that?""

""Wh...what? I don't know what you mean."" My heart raced.

""I'm sorry. I can't explain. Can you trust me, Donny? Are you willing to give one minute?""

The little girl's face flashed into my mind. She hadn't gone to sleep with a hurting tummy that night because I had given one dollar. Whatever her situation, however good or bad things were for her, I'd at least put a little light into her day and made that night a bit easier.

So what miracle could a single minute pull off? Could I help someone even more?

""Yes. I'll donate a minute."" I felt stupid saying that, having no clue what it meant. But I knew it meant something important.

Suddenly, I went stiff, and the phone slipped out of my hand, clattering onto the table. Hardy land lines, it didn't even crack, and luckily, neither did my head.

I opened my eyes, panting and sweating, to see my three floor associates gathered around me behind the counter.

""I said call 911!"" Ernie was insisting, and then he leaped a foot in the air as I shot up into a sitting position.

""Ey yo!"" Tyrone said. ""The hell you nappin' down there for, man?"" He was smiling, sort of, but his eyes looked terrified, as though I'd just dodged a bullet.

""You just fell right to the ground out of nowhere, Donny,"" Leslie chimed in. ""Just a second ago.""

I tried to speak, but they were all over me, helping me into a chair, handing me a glass of water. It pays to not be a shit manager, I guess. Your people care about you. Leslie was still debating about calling an ambulance for me, but I thanked them all and insisted I'd be fine.

We went back to business as usual after everyone was assured I wouldn't pass out again (call me crazy, but I'm pretty sure I'd been out exactly sixty seconds and was in no danger of it happening again). There was nobody at the window.

But two hours later, there was someone at the door.

A policewoman came in, dark blue suit, coffee colored skin, black ponytail, thirty at most. She looked almost as though she were in a trance, seeing something ethereal. She barely glanced around before seeing me, and gravitating right toward my counter.

""Donald Carlson?"" she whispered, and a flash of deja vu hit me. But she had a different voice; she wasn't the woman from the phone.

I nodded, and felt the color drain out of my face. Was it something bad this time? What had happened? Was the whole thing a gamble, and I'd landed on Bankrupt this time? Who had gotten hurt because of this little game I'd decided to play?

But her lips were trembling, and she was beaming at me, looking as though she were trying not to cry. She reached out to me, and I clumsily offered her my hand. She took it with the gentleness of a mother comforting her child, and led me out of the store. Jesus Christ, was I under arrest? What could I have done by giving up a minute of my time?

There was an unmarked bus waiting outside by a couple of police cars. Three more officers stood by, along with a small group of maybe twenty people. Young women, from children about the age of the girl from yesterday, up to college aged, all stood outside the bus. Some looked nervous. Some looked relieved enough to have been reborn.

""What's going on?"" I asked stupidly.

""Mr. Carlson,"" the officer next to me said, her voice shaking, ""we traced the call back to the phone at your counter in this pawn shop. A call lasting exactly one minute. A man with your voice, identifying himself with your full name, gave to our police force not a few hours ago, the address of a human trafficking house you claimed you had been anonymously informed of by an unknown caller with no callback number.""

My eyes were as wide as dinner plates by then. Of course I'd done no such thing; didn't she know that from the way the news was hitting me? But...then suddenly, I realized.

WHAT had I been doing in that one minute that I'd been out? Had I fallen right away? Had I...first dialed someone?

What had Leslie said? *Just a second ago.* They'd gotten to me in a second. A full minute had not passed from the moment I'd fallen and woken up. Only a few seconds.

I had dialed the police first, and then passed out, and woken back up instantly.

I tried to speak. Tears were clogging my throat. Several of the young women and a few of the children were right in front of me now, holding me, crying, and I felt like I was going to fall apart. Like a Jenga puzzle you've removed too many blocks from.

I couldn't have done something this meaningful. Not me. I just *couldn't* have. I mean, I've always wanted to be able to help someone in a profound, meaningful way, I dunno why. Because I'm nice? Because I'm some feel-good sap?

I'll spare you the rest of the waterworks. I didn't hold together too well after a few seconds of being hugged and hearing them cry at their rescue. I sank to my knees and kind of became a mess. The officers turned away, their faces twisted a bit painfully, and I had never felt anything so beautiful as this moment of wonder, that just giving one minute had done something so good. I didn't feel like I *deserved* to feel this kind of...whatever it was.

Pride? No. I didn't feel satisfied, I didn't feel proud, I didn't feel like it was all a job well done. I felt something that made my chest so warm, made me so weak that I could barely stand back up.

Over the next week or so, I got calls from dozens of parents, older siblings, relatives, people sending me flowers, presents, cards, visiting me in person. An old lady actually showed up to kneel as soon as I opened the door, and bless my soul in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior, for the rescue of her granddaughter, amen.

I just couldn't possibly deserve any of this. I already had enough trouble just taking a compliment. I wasn't really some kind of hero just because...because I'd given one minute to a telephone stranger and then been possessed...right?

Well, next Friday.

The phone rang. It was evening, almost time for closing, and I'd actually felt a bit hollow that day, as there had been no call. I felt like that had become a side job, almost. Some kind of miracle puppet, for the mysterious stranger to pull my strings and make me do wonderful things only she knew could happen. Together we were making a difference. Somehow. Don't ask, I'm still baffled. But if I was some kind of benign meat puppet with a kind master who worked with me to save innocent lives so easily, was I going to ever say no to her calls? You know the answer.

""Donny."" She spoke the moment I picked up the phone. She sounded different.

She sounded so sad.

""Hey...Emelie?"" I asked. ""Are you all right?""

She was quiet for a moment.

""It went...pretty well last time,"" I admitted, blushing. I didn't want to really acknowledge the weight of it all, and besides, didn't she deserve more credit than me? She must have been the one making things happen. At least I thought she was.

""I'm sorry, Donny,"" she whispered. ""Oh God, I'm so, so sorry.""

My heart sank. NOW it had to be something bad, I just knew it. Was there going to be an occasional mishap? A price to pay for such easily done good deeds?

""Em...Emelie?""

""Would you like...to make a donation?"" she asked, with great difficulty. It sounded like each word weighed a ton on her heart.

""Of----of course. What kind?"" I blurted before I could lose my nerve.

""Could y..."" she paused, and I could hear her voice momentarily flatten as she quieted down. That small, heart-wrenching sound of someone cutting their voice off to stifle a sob.

She was crying.

""Would...you..."" I heard her moan softly in a quivering voice, and she sniffed a few times, trying to gather a little composure.

""Would you...be willing...to...give....yourself?"" she was trying so hard to hold on. I waited for her to finish, but then I realized her sentence was already done.

""Me?"" I didn't get it.

Then I did.

She was breathing so shakily, waiting for that moment when I would say something that destroyed her, either for this reason, or that other one.

But I knew what this must mean. I knew what was at stake. If it wasn't for me, it would be for someone else.

For a moment, I was filled with terror. In fact, I still am. I haven't stopped being scared. Was it worth it? How would it happen? What was in store for me exactly? When, down to the second?

Everything seemed to get darker. Color faded from my vision for a few seconds as I considered the weight of the horrifying choice. A choice I'm still afraid of, even now as I wait for the inevitable. It had to come down to this. This ultimate test. To see if I really could be willing to do that much.

I'm not sure why I gave the answer I did.

""Yes. I accept.""

Emelie burst into tears. I heard her long, drawn out, shaking sobs as she struggled to speak. But she only managed one last word.

*""D-Donny.""*

Then the sound ended as she hung up.

Nothing was happening. But I knew something would.

Saturday, we were only open in the morning. Closed at twelve. No phone call, of course.

But there was a young woman standing across the street, visible from the window. She was wearing a pale blue dress, an elegant, wonderful thing that at the same time looked so comfortable, even from a distance, she might wear it to bed. Shoulder length wavy black hair. A lovely, kind face.

She was staring at me. Her face gleamed in the sun, and even from far away I could tell she was crying. Ernie asked me at one point what I was looking at, and glanced out there in confusion.

Only I could see her. Emelie would appear for nobody but me.

She was gone by noon, when we closed.

Monday, I was back. So was she. Now on our side of the street, standing on the sidewalk a little ways from the building. No longer crying. But still looking miserable as she stared at me. Now closer, she couldn't even meet my eyes. But she stayed there the whole day.

I was a little more scared then. I had made the choice. I couldn't take it back. But I was more scared than I'd ever been in my life.

Tuesday. She was further down the sidewalk a bit. Closer to the window than before. She managed to look me in the eyes a few times, and every time, I could see the apology there. The back of her dress, I noticed, seemed to be moving, as if something was hiding in there.

I almost hadn't come in to work. I'd wanted to stay huddling in my bed, hoping it would all go away, but I had managed to force myself. I had chosen this. I had to see it through. I had to have the resolve to do what needed to be done.

Wednesday. She was on the grass now, halfway to the window. Watching me. She managed a small smile at one point, and later, a shy wave, though tears still ran down her cheeks. Her dress was fluttering and moving, though there was no breeze.

I was shaking a little on and off that day. Leslie asked me if I was all right. She said I looked pale and sick. I tried to wave off her concerns.

Thursday. She was right outside the window, palms pressed against the glass, looking longingly at me all day. I took out my phone, knowing what was coming for me. I should have done it earlier, I guess, but better late than never. I started this post, and typed out most of it, saving it as a draft. It was the only thing that kept me from leaving early. Just reminding myself what I was doing.

Friday.

The doors unlocked at 7:30 in the morning. The open sign turned on automatically. The doors opened.

My heart stopped as I saw her face. It was too late to run. Too late to change my mind. It had been since the moment I'd said yes. Did I regret it? Did I want to beg her to let me take it back?

Even still, even then, somehow the answer was no. Maybe I'm just half softie, half coward, but I couldn't do it. What that would have done to someone, if I could have changed it...I didn't have that in me.

She walked in slowly, her eyes on me, and came up to the counter. I was the only one there. Nobody else came in till eight. She came closer and closer, and I felt like I would pass out, as though she were projecting the fear from her very being, fear mixed with darkness, that feeling of the unknown approaching, the very word I've been too afraid to acknowledge this whole time, just because I can't bring myself to actually write down that I've willingly brought that particular fate to myself.

She stood on the other side of the counter, staring into my eyes, into my soul. Then she reached forward and took my hands in hers. Tears filled her eyes.

As we stared at each other, it felt as though a lifetime of conversation passed between us in the span of lovely silence. There was nothing but the ticking of the clock on the wall behind me, and the beating of my heart. Her dress fluttered a little, and I thought I saw something white peek out from the side.

Finally, it was almost eight. She closed her eyes, turned, and walked to the door. She paused and looked back at me. We both understood.

As soon as I clocked out for the day...that was it.

She left, and I made more phone calls than I'd ever made in one day. Calls to family. Old friends, new friends, anyone on my contact list. My parents.

I couldn't really explain. But saying goodbye, even veiling it as something they would understand soon, was the hardest thing I've ever done. Even in that one moment before I'd told Emelie yes, I had realized this would be difficult for me, had known it would come, would be necessary. Somehow, I'd put it off. Somehow, she had known I would need to anyway.

Would she have taken me away instantly otherwise, as soon as she'd come in?

Maybe.

Or maybe she'd have given me this last day still anyway, standing outside the window after the short visit. The dress now fluttering in the breeze around her wings, large white feathery wings about as long as she was tall. Flapping slowly, silently, as she watched me, and waited for the clock to wind down. Still occasionally letting a tear escape.

Why?

I wasn't depressed or anything. I wasn't dissatisfied with what I had. I was content, comfortable for the time being, unsure of what the future would bring. But I'd never done anything really, *really* good, or important, and never made a huge name for myself. What harm could it do? People would miss me, and I was sad to hurt them that way, but they would move on eventually. The world would.

I'm not necessary. Not that mundane way. But in this way, at least I can know I did something right, no matter what it took.

Don't be selfish. Don't be cruel. If Emelie or one of the other sisters finds you, calls you, visits you, you'll know it's one of them when you see her. You'll know she came to you because you're that kind of person who would give.

It doesn't have to always be yes. You aren't a bad person for saying no.

But just pause for a moment and think. Why did they come to you? It isn't a personal attack. It isn't a mind game.

They just know you're the kind of person who can make a difference.

Just give what you can. It doesn't have to be everything. Please don't think you absolutely have to. Maybe I shouldn't have. I'm still afraid of the unknown, even though it's minutes away now. When there's no turning back, no matter how kind she is, no matter how she cries for you, she will make sure you keep your word.

Give what you're willing to, and don't feel obligated to give more. Just do what's right, if you can. You have no idea how much it means until after the fact.

The TV. What's it saying?

We interrupt this broadcast to bring you news of a miracle. Every single person at St. Sharif's Hospital who was dying in the terminal illness ward has suddenly, miraculously recovered. They're claiming they all see angels and that they've all been cured, and are being told they'll live long, happy lives, and all because of one...because of...one person...one...

I don't need to see any more.

When did the day go?

I forgot. We're off today. It's a holiday. Nobody came in at all. The hours flew by. I spent the day making calls, clocked in uselessly on a machine that wasn't connected to the internet, wasn't recording my hours today because it was all turned off. Nobody came in to switch things on out there on the floor. I was so preoccupied, I forgot...I didn't even have to come in.

But yes. I did have to.

Her face in the door now. The door's open. She's coming. Tears in her eyes again, but a small smile on her face.

She's walking slowly toward me, raising a hand. I know it's time. I agreed, after all.

Where am I going? What's coming next? I don't know. The fear's still there. I'm cold, I'm sweating, I'm barely standing. But somehow I know I can do this. I know I can honor my word.

I guess I'll see what's beyond.

*Excerpt from Strange Worlds, 1980. Found in an abandoned and derelict two-story home outside of Atlanta, Georgia.*

*Written by Ben Nakamura*

***Calculated Temporal Dissonance***\*: 6%. Increased from previously analyzed media.\*

On August 23rd, 1968, at approximately 11AM, two middle-aged American men walked into the lobby of a hotel in Brasilia, the capital of Brazil. The taller of the two men greeted the concierge sitting behind the desk, a grizzled older gentleman with a cigarette in his mouth and a scar over the bridge of his nose. He informed the concierge that they had a room booked and would be staying for three nights. The lobby was large and cavernous - a 3,000 square ft. floor plan with a slightly curved ceiling rising three stories above the two Americans. It was converted from a chapel into a hotel in the early 60s. Other than the Americans and the concierge, only two additional people were present in the lobby: another guest, a strapping young Brazilian man in a buttoned-down shirt, and the hotel's elderly custodian. The young Brazilian man was a patron of the hotel, sitting opposite the concierge's desk near a weakly spinning table fan, coffee in hand, and reading a newspaper. The custodian was seated at the same table as the young Brazilian man, chatting and waiting for the arrival of a maintenance worker. The shorter American excused himself to the restroom while the other got them both checked in. When he returned from the restroom, the taller American handed him a set of keys. As he did, he noticed the custodian was leering at the shorter of the travelers, his face contorted into an expression that relayed both confusion and anger. The custodian watched intently as the two men walked across the lobby and disappeared into the elevator.¬†

The Americans paced down the fifth-floor hallway to locate their rooms, 508 and 522. Although they were not adjoining as was requested, they decided not to bother the concierge by reporting this error, who had already been noticeably curt with the taller man while he was formally paying for the rooms. The shorter American entered 508, clutching the side of his head and informing his colleague he would like to rest. The taller American nodded and wordlessly strolled approximately eighty yards to his hotel room, intending to get a head start on work.¬†

Not more than an hour later, the taller American was startled by a wild flurry of knocks on the door of 522. A little jittery from surprise, he made his way toward the noise as the thunderstorm crashing into the dense wooden door only became more violent. Unsure of what he was about to encounter, he carefully pocketed a revolver into his suit jacket and looked through the peephole, nearly deafened by the abrupt onset of frenzied and incoherent shouting from the other side. It took him a moment to recognize the shorter American through the peephole through curtains of blood that had been drawn across his face.¬†

As he fearfully twisted the knob, the shorter American spilled into his room. As he passed, the taller American peeked his head cautiously outside the doorframe, not seeing anyone in either direction. When he turned back into the room, it became apparent that his friend had not been attacked by anyone- the damage was self-inflicted. He watched his colleague clawing at his head, haphazardly dragging splintered nails through ragged skin in short, savage bursts. The taller American tried to elicit the root cause of his colleague's erupting madness, but he could barely bring himself to form a coherent sentence, let alone shout it at a volume louder than the other man's screaming in the heat of the moment. The taller American gestured in a pleading motion for his colleague to explain what was going on, unaware that he had removed his left hand from his jacket pocket, which was still absent-mindedly clutching his sidearm. With a movement that the taller American recounted as simultaneously feral and strategic, the raving man placed his right hand over the hand holding the gun, pulled it up until it was level with his forehead, and then used his thumb to overpower his friend's index finger into the trigger, causing it to fire.

Why was the shorter American dead? Maybe, more critically, what had caused this chain of events to happen?

Feels like a riddle, right? A puzzle that could be solved with logic and intuition? Like some new age version of¬†*""There is a farmer, and he must transport a fox, a goose and a bag of beans across the river on a raft, but the fox can't be with the goose because they'll eat it, and the goose can't be with the beans because they'll eat it‚Ä¶""*¬†et cetera, et cetera. Ask your father or middle school philosophy teacher to explain that mind teaser if you've never heard it before. Don't write in and ask me - I only know the premise of the thought exercise, barely at that.

Perhaps a better comparison is this: the story of the two American men in Brazil feels like the cold opening of a particularly violent Agatha Christie novel. The mysterious pieces are laid bare for examination before the story begins in earnest - with a solution to the puzzle hidden just below the surface, waiting for a detective with a keen eye and keener wit to put it all together. Unfortunately, life does not unfold so thoughtfully. According to the story's narrator, Elliot Pierce, there would have been no possible way for him to have detected and prevented what transpired that day.

I sat down with Mr. Pierce, otherwise known as the Tall American, and his interpreter this week, and my, what a tangled web he wove. And if what he tells me is to be believed, I happen to agree with him - it was an unsolvable mystery from the jump. But that assumes this man's story is truthful. So, instead of asking you all, dear readers, to crack this riddle before the inevitable reveals, I ask you this instead - is Elliot Pierce a reliable narrator?¬†

*""We were ambassadors, not spies.""*¬†recounted Elliot through his interpreter. ""Our business in the area was purely economic - part of a larger effort to keep lines of trade open between America and Brazil. Throughout the sixties and into the early seventies, JFK and his administration did their damndest to maintain a healthy foreign policy; we were just a small piece of that.¬† I have no idea why we were targeted with that weapon. I try to keep myself from wondering too hard - sometimes I can feel a stroke coming on when I get too fixated on trying to make it all make sense.""¬†

Somberly, Elliot continued his recollection of the events that followed the gunshot. He couldn't tell me how long he was standing motionless in front of Greg Fields's corpse, AKA the shorter American. Still, given the commotion, he couldn't imagine it was more than a few minutes before his trance was interrupted by the arrival of other hotelgoers to 522, looking to determine the source of the explosive disturbance. When he was found, he was sitting at a small table with a single chair across from Greg. Elliot doesn't recall going from standing to sitting - most of the details immediately after the gunshot, apparently, are lost to him. The body had fallen backward onto the room's cot, and Mr. Pierce seemingly couldn't pull his eyes from the sight of it all. Eventually, though, he was pulled away - manually, by a Brazilian police officer, letting Elliot know in a language he did not understand that he was under arrest for murder. He was still clutching the revolver in his hand when he was first discovered.

At the police station, he was able to put in a call to his contacts in the US. They let Elliot know that a lawyer and some additional members of his department would be deployed ASAP to Brazil. In the meantime, Elliot was, thankfully, not interrogated too harshly. Although this crime had occurred on Brazilian soil, from the cop's perspective, no South American citizens were involved. As long as Elliot remained calm during detainment, the police were in no rush to spend resources determining his guilt or innocence.¬†They'd leave it to the Americans.

""It wasn't nearly as bad as I initially feared,"" Elliot relayed, although his eyes betrayed a lingering pain that seemed discordant with the words coming from his interpreter.¬†

""The guards, at the least the ones that knew a little English, were kind to me. In a moment of suffocating boredom, they even provided me with a pencil and a book of crossword puzzles from my suitcase. Looking back, it is very surreal. That act of hospitality saved my life.""

In the five days before his American counterparts arrived in Brazil, Elliot would have only one visitor. He did not know this man - nor did he recognize him from the hotel. He was not the concierge, the custodian, or the muscular young Brazilian.

""He first caught my attention arguing with the guards outside my cell. He didn't look Brazilian; he looked American - medium build, blue eyes, somewhere in his 30s. Couldn't tell you exactly what they said - but he spoke the local tongue beautifully. In the end, the guards relented and walked into another room. Then, he stepped into the cell using the guard's key.""

Elliot recounted all of this very rapidly - his interpreter barely kept up, but Mr. Pierce did not seem aware of this. Or he chose to ignore it, looking to move through this information as quickly as possible.¬†

""So he steps into my dingy cell with an expensive-looking navy blue suit and briefcase. The holding room had three cells, but none of the others were occupied, so I was alone with this stranger. Instead of sitting across from me, he pulls up a chair and sits beside me, uncomfortably close. I asked him who he was and if he was from my department, and he said nothing in response. He just smiled at me for a few seconds - with full eye contact. Don't think I ever saw him blink. Then, he slowly and very carefully opened his briefcase, all the while still looking into my eyes. No papers, pens, or files in that thing. It's completely empty, save a small brown box. He opens it gently, and it turns out to be a goddamned music box. Tiny harpsichord and everything.""

As Mr. Pierce tells it, this silent visitor sat next to him with the music box, opened it, and let it play for about a minute. What came out wasn't any song that he recognized - in fact, it didn't even really sound like a¬†*song*¬†at all.¬†

""I'm no musician, but what came out of that box wasn't a song. It was a sequence of three notes, playing without any discernable rhythm, and it just kept repeating in the same order, over and over. And part of me thinks I'm dreaming because, I mean, what in the hell is going on? But after about 60 seconds, he gently closes the box, puts it back in his briefcase, and gets up from where he was sitting. As he was standing over me, I noticed a small glob of green foam in his right ear - he had been wearing earplugs that entire time. Without a word, he walks out of the cell. Never seen him again in my life.""

After he said this, Elliot's words finally started to slow down to a normal, human speed. In the interview, I initially interpreted this change to mean something important was to follow. I was partially right - something important was to follow, but I think he needed to slow down primarily because he was struggling to recollect something traumatic.¬†

""So the man in the blue suit leaves, and I tried to ignore the eeriness of that whole interaction. I put my focus back on my crosswords, you know? But I couldn't put my mind to the puzzles because something else was bugging me. He closed the music box in the middle of the note sequence. He had let these three notes play in the same order for a whole fucking minute but then stopped on the second one. He didn't let the third one play the last time.""

Tears began to pool in Elliot's eyes: ""I started to realize I could still hear that second note in my head. Initially, it was quiet, like it was in the back of my thoughts I guess. But soon, that note was all that was in my head; I couldn't hear myself think over it. The sequence was just so painfully unfinished - literally, it was causing me physical pain. I wanted to hear that third note so the sequence would end, but I couldn't find it in my memories.

""Imagine the worst migraine of your life and multiply it by at least a hundred. I have to get up because I can't sit still. I run circles around the inside of my cell, but it doesn't lessen the pain. All the while, that second note just keeps getting louder. It's shrill agony. Like nails on a chalkboard, but it's a thousand hands on a thousand chalkboards. I started hitting my head against the wall and the floor because it felt like the note was creating physical pressure in my head, meaning if I cracked my skull open, the sound and the pain would float out of me and away.""

""And then‚Ä¶well, you know"" shrugging his shoulders in the direction of his sign language interpreter.¬†

He didn't give me the gory details, but he didn't need to. What I knew coming into this interview was that Elliot Pierce had been acquitted of the murder of Greg Fields by reason of insanity. He would describe, to his defense attorney and then on the stand, that Greg had been ""infected"" by the unknown man's music box. Elliot speculated this happened when they checked into the hotel when Greg used the bathroom; that man (or another agent of his, he would later say) must have exposed him to the sequence. Subsequently, the tall American proposed that the short American had taken his own life to relieve himself of the pain. The same reason Elliot had deafened himself by gouging his eardrums in turn with the sharpened pencil he had previously been doing crosswords with.¬†

Unarguably a compelling tale. Moreover, there are some auditory precedents for Elliot's allegations. The day after the interview, I gave Bernard Lane, professor of music theory and history at Berkly, a call to help contextualize what Mr. Pierce had told me:¬†

""What he seems to be alluding to is interesting - the 'unfinished sequence causing physical pain', I mean. Music, at its core, is about tension and release. Most melodies exist in what is called a 'key'. A key is a set of notes, usually 7 total, that fit together in a comfortable way. Take C major, for example. The notes in C major fit together comfortably because they all point to C Major as the 'home chord', also known as the 'tonic'. The tension, then, is playing notes other than C and chords other than C major - the note of G or the chord of G major, for example's sake. The release, in turn, is returning to C from G or from G major to C major.

""The phrase' home chord' is very elegant in its design - think about it this way, what is life but experiencing the tension and the discomfort of the world outside your home, only to then feel resolution and relief upon returning home when the day is through? Now, imagine leaving home but never being able to return, no matter how hard you will it. That tension, that discomfort - I imagine that is what Mr. Pierce is trying to describe. Now, do I think sound could be weaponized in a way that would use this principle to create unbearable physical pain? No, I think not."" Dr. Lane concluded.

Of course, the improbabilities in Elliot's story go far beyond the outlandishness of weaponized melodies. First off, not a single guard at the Brazilian jail recalled the strange visitation of ""the man in the blue suit"". Nor did any employee at the hotel recognize this man matching Elliot's description. Then, there is the question of the revolver - if Elliot's business in Brazil was peaceful, why did he have a loaded sidearm at the ready in his hotel room?¬†

The smoking gun of the prosecution's case, metaphorically speaking, was Elliot's potential motivation. It came out in court that the short American had slept with the Tall American's wife, and he only discovered the adultery nine months before Greg's death. Elliot fiercely denied this fact was related to the situation in any capacity, attesting that it was a one-time mistake on the part of his wife and they had already worked through it. The D.A. who tried the case, Phil Lindworth, had this to say:

""I think we all know why Elliot Pierce killed his Greg Fields,"" He growled, gravelly voice slightly hard to hear over an already lousy office phone connection.¬†

""Adultery can make people angry, and it can put them in a rage, but it doesn't make them insane. The jury was blinded by the spectacle. Elliot Pierce had days in a Brazilian cell to think and plan before he was interrogated, more than enough time to come up with a story that would make him look batshit. He's clever, I'll give him that. I think he realized the story alone wouldn't be enough to convince the jury of his faked insanity; he needed something more dramatic to sell it. Traumatically skewering your eardrums with graphite is one way to get people's attention. But in the end, it always comes back to Occam's Razor.""

Occam's Razor is a deductive reasoning tool that states that the simplest explanation is the most likely explanation. By virtue of odds, Greg was much more likely murdered by his cuckolded friend rather than by a killer music box. Elliot, however, has stood his ground in the years since his verdict. After being released from an asylum two years after Greg's murder, he has been very prolific in many conspiracy theory communities, espousing the claim that his own government experimented on him and Greg with a ""sonic weapon."" He theorizes that they sent him and Greg to Brazil specifically with the intent of having them die there discretely to prove the weapon's functionality. To further back his claims, he refers to a bizarre and tragic grocery store fire in Northern Maine that happened while he was institutionalized:¬†

""A year into my hospitalization, everything seemed to finally be going alright. I was even starting to believe what they were telling me: that there was no sonic weapon and that I killed Greg in a jealous rage. Then, I read about this fire, and it made my head nearly spin. Nine people killed inside a grocery store, burned to a crisp. No one knows what happened. Three out of the nine had pierced their eardrums with a sharp object: a metal antenna from a radio and two screwdrivers, if I remember correctly. When I talk to people, and they try to hide from the truth, they'll say things like it's a coincidence. Elliot, you're seeing patterns where they aren't. And to them, I say - none of the doors were locked, and it took a while for the building to collapse. How did every single person in that store die? Why didn't they run out of the fire? I could understand half of them being caught in the blaze, but all of them? Or, instead, was that fucking sequence tested again. Bigger this time, more people and a larger space. Maybe they played it over the intercom or something. Of course, they still performed the test in an isolated area; that grocery store was in a town of only 200 people.""

""When the fire started, it wasn't a tragic accident - it was because the victims hearing that note started the fire. And then they let themselves burn to escape that fucking sound"" Elliot signed while staring daggers into me. It became clear that he did not do well with confrontation, as he then cut the interview short and left.

Where do I land on all of this? God, it changes every day. I'll admit it, the grocery store incident is strange and compelling. Critics of Elliot's claims will say that those three people did not impale themselves purposely - small propane canisters must have exploded and launched those items into their victims. Admittedly, this is not a great explanation, but I suppose it's possible.¬†

So, now that I've presented all of the information - is Elliot Pierce a reliable narrator? Or just an insidiously clever murderer? Is it a little of both?¬†Do we not even have enough information to be asking the right questions?

As I said - there will likely never be a clear-cut answer to what happened in Brazil or Maine. Life refuses to be confined to the rules of a puzzle. That doesn't mean we stop asking the questions, though.

Elliot recounted all of this very rapidly - his interpreter barely kept up, but Mr. Pierce did not seem aware of this. Or he chose to ignore it, looking to move through this information as quickly as possible.¬†

""So he steps into my dingy cell with an expensive-looking navy blue suit and briefcase. The holding room had three cells, but none of the others were occupied, so I was alone with this stranger. Instead of sitting across from me, he pulls up a chair and sits beside me, uncomfortably close. I asked him who he was and if he was from my department, and he said nothing in response. He just smiled at me for a few seconds - with full eye contact. Don't think I ever saw him blink. Then, he slowly and very carefully opened his briefcase, all the while still looking into my eyes. No papers, pens, or files in that thing. It's completely empty, save a small brown box. He opens it gently, and it turns out to be a goddamned music box. Tiny harpsichord and everything.""

As Mr. Pierce tells it, this silent visitor sat next to him with the music box, opened it, and let it play for about a minute. What came out wasn't any song that he recognized - in fact, it didn't even really sound like a *song* at all.¬†

""I'm no musician, but what came out of that box wasn't a song. It was a sequence of three notes, playing without any discernable rhythm, and it just kept repeating in the same order, over and over. And part of me thinks I'm dreaming because, I mean, what in the hell is going on? But after about 60 seconds, he gently closes the box, puts it back in his briefcase, and gets up from where he was sitting. As he was standing over me, I noticed a small glob of green foam in his right ear - he had been wearing earplugs that entire time. Without a word, he walks out of the cell. Never seen him again in my life.""

After he said this, Elliot's words finally started to slow down to a normal, human speed. In the interview, I initially interpreted this change to mean something important was to follow. I was partially right - something important was to follow, but I think he needed to slow down primarily because he was struggling to recollect something traumatic.¬†

""So the man in the blue suit leaves, and I tried to ignore the eeriness of that whole interaction. I put my focus back on my crosswords, you know? But I couldn't put my mind to the puzzles because something else was bugging me. He closed the music box in the middle of the note sequence. He had let these three notes play in the same order for a whole fucking minute but then stopped on the second one. He didn't let the third one play the last time.""

Tears began to pool in Elliot's eyes: ""I started to realize I could still hear that second note in my head. Initially, it was quiet, like it was in the back of my thoughts I guess. But soon, that note was all that was in my head; I couldn't hear myself think over it. The sequence was just so painfully unfinished - literally, it was causing me physical pain. I wanted to hear that third note so the sequence would end, but I couldn't find it in my memories.

""Imagine the worst migraine of your life and multiply it by at least a hundred. I have to get up because I can't sit still. I run circles around the inside of my cell, but it doesn't lessen the pain. All the while, that second note just keeps getting louder. It's shrill agony. Like nails on a chalkboard, but it's a thousand hands on a thousand chalkboards. I started hitting my head against the wall and the floor because it felt like the note was creating physical pressure in my head, meaning if I cracked my skull open, the sound and the pain would float out of me and away.""

""And then‚Ä¶well, you know"" shrugging his shoulders in the direction of his sign language interpreter.¬†

He didn't give me the gory details, but he didn't need to. What I knew coming into this interview was that Elliot Pierce had been acquitted of the murder of Greg Fields by reason of insanity. He would describe, to his defense attorney and then on the stand, that Greg had been ""infected"" by the unknown man's music box. Elliot speculated this happened when they checked into the hotel when Greg used the bathroom; that man (or another agent of his, he would later say) must have exposed him to the sequence. Subsequently, the tall American proposed that the short American had taken his own life to relieve himself of the pain. The same reason Elliot had deafened himself by gouging his eardrums in turn with the sharpened pencil he had previously been doing crosswords with.¬†

Unarguably a compelling tale. Moreover, there are some auditory precedents for Elliot's allegations. The day after the interview, I gave Bernard Lane, professor of music theory and history at Berkly, a call to help contextualize what Mr. Pierce had told me:¬†

""What he seems to be alluding to is interesting - the 'unfinished sequence causing physical pain', I mean. Music, at its core, is about tension and release. Most melodies exist in what is called a 'key'. A key is a set of notes, usually 7 total, that fit together in a comfortable way. Take C major, for example. The notes in C major fit together comfortably because they all point to C Major as the 'home chord', also known as the 'tonic'. The tension, then, is playing notes other than C and chords other than C major - the note of G or the chord of G major, for example's sake. The release, in turn, is returning to C from G or from G major to C major.

""The phrase' home chord' is very elegant in its design - think about it this way, what is life but experiencing the tension and the discomfort of the world outside your home, only to then feel resolution and relief upon returning home when the day is through? Now, imagine leaving home but never being able to return, no matter how hard you will it. That tension, that discomfort - I imagine that is what Mr. Pierce is trying to describe. Now, do I think sound could be weaponized in a way that would use this principle to create unbearable physical pain? No, I think not."" Dr. Lane concluded.

Of course, the improbabilities in Elliot's story go far beyond the outlandishness of weaponized melodies. First off, not a single guard at the Brazilian jail recalled the strange visitation of ""the man in the blue suit"". Nor did any employee at the hotel recognize this man matching Elliot's description. Then, there is the question of the revolver - if Elliot's business in Brazil was peaceful, why did he have a loaded sidearm at the ready in his hotel room?¬†

The smoking gun of the prosecution's case, metaphorically speaking, was Elliot's potential motivation. It came out in court that the short American had slept with the Tall American's wife, and he only discovered the adultery nine months before Greg's death. Elliot fiercely denied this fact was related to the situation in any capacity, attesting that it was a one-time mistake on the part of his wife and they had already worked through it. The D.A. who tried the case, Phil Lindworth, had this to say:

""I think we all know why Elliot Pierce killed his Greg Fields,"" He growled, gravelly voice slightly hard to hear over an already lousy office phone connection.¬†

""Adultery can make people angry, and it can put them in a rage, but it doesn't make them insane. The jury was blinded by the spectacle. Elliot Pierce had days in a Brazilian cell to think and plan before he was interrogated, more than enough time to come up with a story that would make him look batshit. He's clever, I'll give him that. I think he realized the story alone wouldn't be enough to convince the jury of his faked insanity; he needed something more dramatic to sell it. Traumatically skewering your eardrums with graphite is one way to get people's attention. But in the end, it always comes back to Occam's Razor.""

Occam's Razor is a deductive reasoning tool that states that the simplest explanation is the most likely explanation. By virtue of odds, Greg was much more likely murdered by his cuckolded friend rather than by a killer music box. Elliot, however, has stood his ground in the years since his verdict. After being released from an asylum two years after Greg's murder, he has been very prolific in many conspiracy theory communities, espousing the claim that his own government experimented on him and Greg with a ""sonic weapon."" He theorizes that they sent him and Greg to Brazil specifically with the intent of having them die there discretely to prove the weapon's functionality. To further back his claims, he refers to a bizarre and tragic grocery store fire in Northern Maine that happened while he was institutionalized:¬†

""A year into my hospitalization, everything seemed to finally be going alright. I was even starting to believe what they were telling me: that there was no sonic weapon and that I killed Greg in a jealous rage. Then, I read about this fire, and it made my head nearly spin. Nine people killed inside a grocery store, burned to a crisp. No one knows what happened. Three out of the nine had pierced their eardrums with a sharp object: a metal antenna from a radio and two screwdrivers, if I remember correctly. When I talk to people, and they try to hide from the truth, they'll say things like it's a coincidence. Elliot, you're seeing patterns where they aren't. And to them, I say - none of the doors were locked, and it took a while for the building to collapse. How did every single person in that store die? Why didn't they run out of the fire? I could understand half of them being caught in the blaze, but all of them? Or, instead, was that fucking sequence tested again. Bigger this time, more people and a larger space. Maybe they played it over the intercom or something. Of course, they still performed the test in an isolated area; that grocery store was in a town of only 200 people.""

""When the fire started, it wasn't a tragic accident - it was because the victims hearing that note started the fire. And then they let themselves burn to escape that fucking sound"" Elliot signed while staring daggers into me. It became clear that he did not do well with confrontation, as he then cut the interview short and left.

Where do I land on all of this? God, it changes every day. I'll admit it, the grocery store incident is strange and compelling. Critics of Elliot's claims will say that those three people did not impale themselves purposely - small propane canisters must have exploded and launched those items into their victims. Admittedly, this is not a great explanation, but I suppose it's possible.¬†

So, now that I've presented all of the information - is Elliot Pierce a reliable narrator? Or just an insidiously clever murderer? Is it a little of both?¬†Do we not even have enough information to be asking the right questions?

As I said - there will likely never be a clear-cut answer to what happened in Brazil or Maine. Life refuses to be confined to the rules of a puzzle. That doesn't mean we stop asking the questions, though.

I feel privileged by the fact that my parents have always made it known that they love me and me and my brother are/were the best things that happened to them, but there was a lot of toxicity and emotional abuse growing up that has left me and my brother almost estranged with my parents. 

Growing up we:
-were raised in a very small cottage with the roof caving in because my dad refused to go into debt for us to have a safer/more comfortable living environment. This continued for 10 years. 

-were made to feel extremely ashamed for random things like drinking coffee, using chapstick, and for me cutting my hair(because women look ‚Äúbetter‚Äù with longer hair)

-I was told directly by my dad that women shouldn‚Äôt run for President because of their hormones and periods, knowing darn well that I‚Äôm a woman, along with other sexist comments. 

-eating normal meals consistently throughout the day put us at risk of comments like ‚Äúeating again?‚Äù Or ‚Äúoh I‚Äôve only had an apple and a handful of nuts the whole day, but sure get yourself another meal‚Äù. 

-Although my parents supported us throughout college, my dad made it a point at almost every waking hour to remind us of how much of a waste of money it was and how they‚Äôre being sucked dry by it every week. Basically I felt ashamed and guilty whenever I came home from school breaks. I even moved to a sketchy neighborhood 45 minutes away from campus Sophomore year, because my dad said if I didn‚Äôt get the housing/tuition costs down I wouldn‚Äôt be able to go back. Rent was only $350 a month but it was a very unsafe living environment for a young woman.

-A similar thing is happened now that I‚Äôm engaged with my fianc√©. I‚Äôve reminded my parents that they don‚Äôt need to contribute to our wedding expenses, and my dad is resentful and has mentioned how ‚Äúthe baby boomers are being raped‚Äù by their adult kids. For context, my dad is an extreme saver and has a net worth of 2+ million dollars, so it‚Äôs extremely hurtful that he comes up with the comments even though we havnt asked for anything. 

-Whenever I talk to my dad, it‚Äôs almost always a 1 way conversation and he almost immediately shifts the convo to start talking about himself. It‚Äôs just frustrating because I feel like I‚Äôve never really been able to connect with him, and I can‚Äôt really share my thoughts and feelings. 

-There was constant fighting between my mom and dad growing up, and they‚Äôve almost gotten divorced many times. My dad has always been very critical and mean towards my mom, commenting on her weight and shortcomings. 


There‚Äôs a million other examples, but basically I feel resentful towards my dad even though I know we mainly grew up in a loving household, and we were privileged in many ways. I still feel guilt, shame, and just overall anxiety when I‚Äôm back home because of the environment we were raised in. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, my dad still has many wonderful qualities, but I‚Äôm not sure how to navigate these feelings, and I don‚Äôt want to hurt my parents. They are starting to wonder why my brother and I don‚Äôt rush over to see them whenever we have the chance, as we‚Äôve both been out of the house for years now.

Is anyone else able to relate to this, and how have you navigated the situation?

1ghlsca,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/1ghlsca/labcorp_atm_profile_betaamyloid_42l40_ratio_ptau/,"LabCorp ATM profile? Beta-amyloid 42l40 ratio, P-TAU 181 or 218? An update ","Several weeks ago, my (64m) neurologist ordered the ATN profile test (putports to reveal Alzheimer's pathology and level of damage with high accuracy) from LabCorp after a CPAP machine and alertness pills failed to eliminate my excessive daytime sleepiness, and after I reported my APO-E 3/4 status and my brother (upper 70's) with active Alzheimer's.
The rest returned A+T+N-.
Meaning that Alzheimer's is a very strong likelihood, but that very little damage has actually occurred so far.
The A & T numbers reflect the ratio of Beta-amyloid 42|40, and the amount of P-TAU 181 found in the blood sample. Either value alone can be in the danger level but both being imout of range are key to the indicator of AD.
 
 The N is something called NfL and reflect the level of damage. In my case, the A & T are both clearly in the ""positive for Alzheimer's"" range, but interestingly, the N value falls very far below the limit indicating neurological damage.

The update is that I finally got the results of official cognitive testing, and they tell me I scored above average on all of it except one section where I went through it so fast that I didn't pay attention to the instructions and lost a few points (surely I can blame that on AD, right? ü§£)

So that jibes with the N values.

Next step (which I've had to delay multiple times due to being busier at work than any time in the past ~20 years) is a spinal tap and evaluation of spinal fluid for either the same or similar (maybe ptau 218?) markers.

(I'm also considering requesting a PreceptAD2 blood test as those may be more specific than the LabCorp test, but time is kind of tight right now.)

I'll post the results as a response here (assuming I don't forget ü§£ü§£ü§£)  but I don't expect them before mid December.

In the meantime I am continuing to try to improve my diet (working towards the MIND diet),  I'm drinking 2-4 cups of coffee per day (to keep alert), and using a 15 or 20mg dose of Belsomra nightly for sleep.
The Belsomra (suvorexant) has been especially helpful in improving my sleep, and my Fitbit is showing the results too.
Overall I feel like I'm in good shape, now I just need to get some time to fly my paramotor some more. ü™Ç

I have not descaled this machine before as the water where I live is fairly soft (24-148ppm) and coffee I make taste good (not bitter / sour tasting).

I mostly use filtered water from a water dispenser, along with the Lelit water filter inside the reservoir. Regular backflushing done with water (once weekly)  and chemical (bi-weekly)

At this point:

1) Is a descale required at this point? 
2) Any better water recipes I can consider?

I also lost two close long term friends at the same time due to political differences (which I swear I rarely talked about, they are just a little extreme).

And my friend group at work is shared with my ex since we work together and met there.

My friend group at work seems to not like me as much. They often get coffee without me, leave without me but wait for each other, dont talk to me excitedly the way they talk to each other etc.

I feel so crushed in so many areas of life right now. A year ago I had everything, my own apartment in the city I love, friends at work who loved me and I loved them (I still see group pictures we from when they would hug me and wait for me and ask about me), friends outside of work who I loved, a boyfriend who I loved.

Now I have nothing, no apartment, almost no friends, no boyfriend, and work is torture watching them all get closer, and even shower my ex with attention, while making me feel unloved.

I blame myself to a certain extent, they got closer within the last year while I was getting closer with my ex. If I gave them all more time and attention and effort, we might have been closer now.

My life just sucks so much right now. Work is torture, but its also the cushiest job I've ever had, which makes me feel like I've lost yet another thing.

I dont understand the point of my life. I feel like I'll never be happy again. I dont want to do anything else with my life. I dont want a new job, I dont want to move, I dont want any other man.

Looking for a haunted friend for Halloween adventures 

Let‚Äôs haunt a pumpkin patch


I just want to feel something. I want something to write about. 

Dreamy pajamas and tasty coffee. Scary movies and soft puppies 

Sometimes I want to read the most miserable books and feel my heart sink to the floor

Would love to talk an adult about dumb things. Nostalgia, Americana, let‚Äôs time travel and time warp(the dance is cool too) and reminisce on places we only see in our dreams

Bare with me a moment things going nowhere 



troubled waters, these dogs are howling in the distance and my dogs are howling just in front of me and everyone‚Äôs afraid of the earthquakes we‚Äôve been getting but it can‚Äôt be that bad can it?

I was here in 94 and and saw the freeways collapsed and the balconies smashed and the apartments sinking into the ground. 

California dreaming? I have the worst sleep. I take melatonin and I have the weirdest dreams. Always I‚Äôm in a bust station or a train station or moving though a casino like an ant on a sugar trail. 

Drunk as drunk on turpentine. 

But I found out Neruda is a piece of so maybe we don‚Äôt quote him tonight. 

My dog stepped on a bee and somehow they both lived. Well obviously rhe dog but I managed to get the bee to a hummingbird feeder and he drank up and then flew off. 

I‚Äôm afraid of those really blue nights I haven‚Äôt seen since I was sixteen coming home to an empty place and I‚Äôm outside waiting for that blue light to come but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs coming. 

Who needs coasts when you‚Äôre perfectly adrift?

What‚Äôs your favorite scary movie?

I want to be an urban legend. 
I want to be haunted. 

I want to live forever. 

My job. I make people feel pretty. And I make things that; with care, can last forever. 

Oh the lemon tree. The lemons are green still but so and when the pomegranates are out we‚Äôll make pomegranate lemonade and listen to my favorite song; it‚Äôs called 


Hopelessly dreamy rainy day vibes with new socks and soft sheets and soft windows and soft sunshine. Wake up to turn out the lights. My fears are soft and so are my knees. These dreams have had their fun with me. 


I make art for a living. Dreamy sad moody nostalgic stuff for dreamy people with bad intentions. 



I want to feel my heart drop through my stomach. I want to feel something good or bad and I want something to write about. Let me turn you into literature and bad paintings. Let‚Äôs take Polaroids and hide them in library books. 

Collector of old books and Polaroid photos. Constant reader and dreamer. Following foxes down rabbit holes and making all the worst mistakes. 

I want to believe in ghosts but I‚Äôve never seen proof of one. Someone said your hearts as big as your fist. 

Let‚Äôs be zombies. All braindead and ruled by instinct. 

I want to feel something. Tell me the sky is falling. Tell me the world is ending. 
Tell me something you can say today and never again. 

Come in from the rain and trade your wet socks for something new. 

I‚Äôll read you old poems and tell you all about that time,
The one you dream about

1ghla53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mycotoxins/comments/1ghla53/seeking_more_education_about_mycotoxins/,Seeking more Education about Mycotoxins,"I am struggling to understand the whole mycotoxin sickness mechanism. I have several family members who are in medical field and they don't believe it is a thing. We did have to completely replace our AC units (including all the ducts) in 2009 due to mold. It was around that time I was first diagnosed with Graves and have had other issues (like chronic reactivated EBV) since. It only occurred to me this past summer to mention the mold incident to my ND. My initial test came back positive for OTA. After treating with Nystatin, OTA  more than doubled and Citrinin showed up on the test.

This may be a ridiculous question, but could exposure that long ago continue to make me sick? If your body does not clear mold does it remain in your body for years? Or, is there no way to still have it in your body without another exposure? Could the elevated urine be from a recent walk through a moldy building? Drinking coffee from a moldy pot?  

I live in south Louisiana, where mushrooms grow in long grass due to the humidity so it is difficult to avoid. I am listening to podcasts and reading articles, but can't understand how this begins and continues. (perhaps brain fog still at play) Any advice or direction to a simple explanation of how this begins and continues to flourish would be greatly appreciated.

‚ÄúHey, sorry for not responding to your messages. I just wanted to be upfront‚ÄîI don‚Äôt want to waste your time, and I feel like this connection isn‚Äôt really going to grow. I think it would be best if we both focus on meeting other people. I really appreciate how kind you‚Äôve been, especially helping me start the year and hanging out with me at homecoming.

My friend keeps saying no don‚Äôt do it because he‚Äôs like obsessed with me and I‚Äôm the new girl In school and don‚Äôt really have friends but it‚Äôs just getting awkward

So am I the asshole for sending this because he has friends but he doesn‚Äôt really feel close to them or they don‚Äôt really like him I don‚Äôt know but yesterday was his birthday so..

Like he‚Äôs really is just a lonely dude I am also so I don‚Äôt know why I feel like I‚Äôm better than him-

I‚Äôm still going send it I just don‚Äôt know when because he‚Äôs celebrating his birthday this week probably

1ghl6zs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ghl6zs/my_mom_said_im_being_stubborn_for_not_wanting_to/,My mom said I'm being stubborn for not wanting to hang out at bars.,"  So for context, I'm 21 and I college at the moment. I grew up in a small family with one brother, and growing up he often had issues with drinking and using other substances in excess. On top of that I was around a lot of friends who would drink as well, and it caused some issues because they'd try and pressure me to drink when I didn't want to. I also had a lot of issues growing up with getting people to respect my boundaries, which got me into issues with people online who tried to manipulate me. 
   Even as soon as last year I was in an abusive relationship and ever since then I've been far more serious about no meaning no. However, this caused an issue recently with my current, amazing boyfriend who invited me out to a bar. He forgot to mention it and I've told him before my past with drinking and how I also want people to respect my boundaries. Before anyone says anything, he apologized and we worked it out, but I called my mom to ask her what she thought.
   She basically said that my unwillingness to hang out at bars will make people see me as a bitch or a prude, and to expect people not to hang out with me because ""People in their 20s hang out at bars."" Which I thought was unfair of her to call me over me expressing that I don't like bars, and that I don't judge people who hang out at them, but I don't want to hang out at them. The noises are too much, and the smells and crowdedness of bars just overwhelms me. 
   I don't find it fun to be around drunk people I don't know, especially when you overhear some of the conversations they have. I've always known this, and in general i prefer to go to coffee shops or other places that are much calmer.
   I know I'm very stubborn about knowing what I want and don't want, but im also sick of people pushing me into things I'm uncomfortable with because they swear I'll get used to it. I try to politely decline invites, but my mom said that even that will isolate me since om still saying no. The best I can do is be polite I feel, but maybe it's something I really do just have to expect, I'm not sure.",2,1730510096.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1ghl6po,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1ghl6po/nothing_in_return/,Nothing in return;,"It hurts to be the person that they always run to, no? 

I never was the type of guy who gives people kindness because I expect something in return. I've always wanted to help those close to me. I've always been the ""one call away"" type of dude. But whether it sounds true to you or not, I never expected anything in return.

I was kind to friends and family all coz I wanted them good. That maybe, I can make a difference in their life, big or small it may be. Maybe I can relieve some of their pressure. Maybe I can make them smile, be it for a short while or perhaps a little longer.

I offered everyone guidance, knowledge, kindness, laughter, companionship, what else? 

9 out of ten times I'd drop whatever plan or chore is occupying me if a friend asks me to hang out. You get therapy for your loss and a blueprint that suggests how you may be able to move forward.

Heart broken? Here, let's go out for coffee or beer and let me be your rant wall.

Money? I never asked for those who borrowed in me to pay back, and if they insist, pay me in half the most. Even when I didn't have and a friend needs to borrow money for an important cause, I'll give 'em how ever much I can and don't ask for a payment so he/she will have less to borrow from someone else and one less person to worry that he/she will have to pay back.

I ain't rich. I am struggling, heavily. But reach out to me and I'll do whatever I can to help you.

But, it hurts. Even when you never expected reciprocity to begin with, it hurts when you are the one in deep waters, and got no one.

It hurts to feel alone in your darkest phase while being a light in someone else's darkest phase.

I'm going to stop before anybody tells me I have a messiah complex and is narcissistic. 

I do all this because I know pain and struggle a little too well.

1ghl4xo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ghl4xo/what_is_required_for_crypto_to_be_the_future/,What is required for crypto to be the future?,"This is a rant!

I've recently discovered crypto in a more deep sense. I absolutely love the idea of decentralized finances and trustless systems. The technology of block-chains is fascinating. However I have one issue, if we want to use crypto like we do cash, (buy coffee, a house, new shoes, etc.) what is needed to make that happen?

Crypto is extremely volatile right now. So it doesn't make sense to me to pay for things with (lets say Litecoin) when the Litecoin could be worth 70 USD one day and 35 next month. (I understand that the perfect scenario is everyone uses crypto derived from limited supply currencies like bitcoin, and thus we have a decentralized, low fee, hard money system.) But let's be realistic, crypto will not replace fiat money in our lifetimes. So if the (ex. US) is still based on the USD, and inflation continues to occur, how does crypto help us fight that? You would essentially need your L1 currency of limited supply to increase in price equal to that of inflation, otherwise your currency has just succumb to inflation. So how do we deal with this?

Ideally, in a world of fiat and crypto, I should be able to hold an appreciating base currency that grows equal to or greater than inflation of fiat money, and then swap some of the base to a stable coin whenever I need to make a purchase or just convert it to fiat money.

So how do we get to a point where the L1 currencies are appreciating at a rate greater than or equal to inflation in an given moment. If I buy into bitcoin and convert 70k USD to 1 BTC, and I want to buy something that costs 70k USD (1 BTC), but then BTC is worth 65K the next week, I can no longer buy that 70k USD item. If I were to put 70k USD into a stable coin worth at 1:1, I would succumb to inflation as I directly need as many stable coins as dollars. But if I use a coin that is some set ratio of an L1 coin then we have a hard money system. But that hard money system is still attached to fiat inflation and other movements.

So how do we preserve value in crypto while connecting fiat movements while preserving peoples purchasing power.

I don't know I feel like I've been thinking in loops. I think I understand crypto and I do understand the US federal reserve and the gold standard, I'm just having a lot of difficulty connecting the two and making it make sense. I'm liking missing something.

Like if I buy into bitcoin at 70k and wanna buy a house for 700k or 10 BTC but then BTC went down, well fuck I guess I just lost my purchasing power. But then oh wait I can now afford a 1.7 million dollar house with my 10 BTC? How is that a good store of value?",10,1730509918.0,CryptoCurrency,15,0.86,False

He opens up and runs to grab it.  I stay in the  office and start looking around. I am standing at the counter where she works and I may or may not have looked at her desk calendar.

First, I‚Äôd like to thank everyone who gave feedback on our itinerary. Your advice was invaluable in helping us plan a successful trip!
Itinerary:

Day 1: Arrival in Taoyuan and Transfer to Taichung
12:50 PM - Arrival at Taoyuan Airport. The airport is very organized.
To-Do: Buy SIM cards, withdraw cash, and try the ""Lucky Land"" game (none of us won, unfortunately!).
Transfer to Taichung: Bought a U-bus ticket for 340 NTD. Go one level down, turn left twice, and you'll find kiosks for U-bus. Our bus experience was comfortable with clear maps showing stops. We got off at Minzu Road, about a 10-minute walk to our hotel.

Palmer Hotel: Great location‚Äîclose to the TRA Station, Gancheng Road, Taichung Park, Yizhong Night Market, Miyahara, and other attractions. Rooms were clean and spacious, perfect for large luggage. The breakfast buffet was convenient, with tasty food, which helped us start the day without looking for other dining options.

Yizhong Night Market:
Lots of clothing stores and food stalls. Not the biggest night market, but one of my favorites because of the manageable crowd and delicious options.

Food Highlights:
Angel Chicken Chop: Juicy and flavorful, even better than Hot Star.
Others: Sweet potato balls, milk tea, dim sum (average), and egg waffles.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Day 2: Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village / Sun Moon Lake
After catching the 7:45 AM bus to Formosan, we dozed off during the ride. Word of advice: don't miss the bus stop like we did! Since the driver announced in Mandarin and we couldn‚Äôt fully understand, we didn't realize the bus only has one stop for Formosan, thinking there would be multiple stops around the park. As a result, we ended up at Sun Moon Lake first, where we took a boat to Ita Thao for lunch and rode the Ropeway.

Sun Moon Lake Highlights:
The scenery at Sun Moon Lake is beautiful, but since our main plan was to explore Formosan, we couldn‚Äôt fully tour SML. From the Ropeway, you arrive at the cultural area of Formosan, which is enormous. We mainly explored the rides, though!

Must-Try Rides at Formosan
1. Spanish Coast's Armada Invincible: super fun and exciting!
2. Maya Adventure: so intense we nearly passed out from fear!
3. UFO: short but thrilling.
We finished at Formosan and waited for the bus near the European Palace area.

Takeaways and Tips:
Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask! If we had asked the driver or locals for guidance, we would‚Äôve skipped the detour and had more time for both Formosan and Sun Moon Lake.
If you only have one day: Start at Formosan to cover what interests you most, then take the Ropeway to SML to explore the lake, rent bikes, or island-hop by boat. But even better if you can take 1 night stay in SML. 

Dinner: Chun Shui Tang
Highlights:
Pearl milk tea, bubble tea, dan-dan noodles, spicy wontons, and shrimp shumai.
The braised beef noodles were just okay.
Soy sauce braised pork chop donburi: sadly, the meat was tender but had a strong, off-putting smell.

Dessert: Miyahara
The place is small, and the ice cream was decent‚Äîworth a try but not exceptional.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
Day 3: Alishan via Private Tour
Our tour started with an 8 AM pickup, arranged through Cai Xuan Huang (on Facebook). Easy to communicate with lali na kasi filipino si cai xuan husband niya yung nagddrive), and they even treated us to free milk teas!

Journey to Alishan
The drive took around 3 hours from Taichung to Fenqihu, where we tried their famous bento meals‚Äîthe pork chop was incredibly tender! After lunch, we drove another hour to Alishan Recreation Park. Entry is 300 NTD, but bus travelers can get a discounted rate (150 NTD) by showing their ticket. The park's trains cost 100 NTD per ride, but we chose to walk around for about 2 hours. The scenery was breathtaking‚Äîso different from anything back home in the Philippines. We wished we had more time to explore!

Takeaways
For a longer visit: Consider staying overnight near Alishan or in Chiayi for easier access. If you‚Äôre only there for a day trip, you might want to skip Fenqihu to spend more time in the park.
Route tip: If walking from the tourist village, follow this path: Chaoping Station ‚Üí Sister Ponds ‚Üí Shouzhen Temple ‚Üí Shenmu Station. We intended to do this but ended up following a group, so we missed Sister Pond and the Mongolian Tree.

Dinner: Fengjia Night Market

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Day 4: Kaohsiung (Private Tour)
This was a spontaneous switch from our original plan to explore more of Taichung (Xinshe Castle, Second Market, Literature Museum, Painted Animation Lane, Taichung Botanical Garden, Taichung Theatre, and Fengjia). We went with the flow and headed to Kaohsiung instead!
Kaohsiung Highlights
Skywalk

Lunch: Our guide chose a quiet, secluded spot with great food.

Fo Guang Shan: Massive and beautiful‚Äîperfect for sightseeing. There are reasonably priced dining options here as well.

Pier 2 Art Center: We strolled around and soaked in the creative atmosphere. Unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt have enough time to see the pagodas.

Dinner: Henji Hajimen (minimum 150 NTD/person)‚Äîdelicious ramen with a Taiwanese twist!

And of course, another milk tea run!

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Day 5: Taichung to Taipei
We started the day around 8 AM, had breakfast, and caught an earlier bus at 9:15 AM from Gancheng Station (originally had tickets for a later time) to get to Taipei earlier for check-in.

Arriving in Taipei
The bus dropped us off at Taipei Main Station. To catch a taxi, we headed down to B1, where there‚Äôs a high-tech taxi booking system using tablets! Thankfully, a local helped us out, as we probably would‚Äôve been waiting for nothing without knowing how it worked. Taxis do wait there, but it‚Äôs easier to use the tablets‚ÄîGoogle Translate helps!

Tip: Avoid mentioning ""Airbnb"" as it seems unofficial in Taipei.

Exploring Taipei
After settling in, we grabbed lunch at Wang‚Äôs Broth, which my siblings found a bit too oily. Then, we walked to Longshan Temple and Bopilao Historical Block, and took the train from Xiaonanmen to Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall. The memorial area is massive and impressive, though it was busier than usual due to a Hakka Festival.

Next, we headed to Taipei 101, taking a photo at the rainbow pedestrian near Taipei City Hall. Tip: For easier access, go straight to the red line and alight at the Taipei 101 station. Finally, we made a stop at Ximending Night Market to try local street food like Xin Fu Tang and rice sausage, watched some street shows, and took in the vibrant atmosphere.

Day 6: Beitou and Tamsui (Private Tour via Ntcrcaoc TST-Taiwan Car Rental)
The Ntcrcao tour was fantastic‚Äîaffordable, with great service, and friendly drivers.

Itinerary Highlights:
Beitou
Yangmingshan National Park (visited the volcanic area)
Qingtianggang Grassland: A beautiful, lush landscape reminiscent of New Zealand.

Lunch: Our guide took us to a mountain spot with generous servings and delicious food.

Tamsui
Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf: Quick stop (about 30 minutes) to cross the bridge and sightsee.
Tamsui Old Street: Extremely crowded, possibly due to an event, so it was a bit dizzying with all the people.

Ending the Day at Shilin Night Market
sobrang daming tao, people were shoulder-to-shoulder, and maraming may amoy huhu. We tried Hot-Star chicken (it was okay), taro cake (also okay), and shrimp-catching, which was a fun experience. Plus, we picked up some shirts, bags, and‚Äîof course‚Äîmore tea!

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Day 7: Wulai
Today was more relaxed since we were all pretty exhausted. We started around 10 AM, reached Xindian Station by 11, and took the 849 bus to Wulai (check Google Maps for bus timing, and load up your Easy Card beforehand).

Lunch: We ate at Wulai Old Street, tried some local snacks (the sausage was just okay for me), and grabbed a coffee by the log cart. In hindsight, it would‚Äôve been nicer to get coffee further up in Wulai.

Activities
We rode the log cart and explored Wulai for a bit. Then, we headed down to our reserved onsen experience at Volando Urai. It was a memorable, relaxing experience, though we initially felt self-conscious as it‚Äôs fully nude. But after a while, we relaxed, realizing the locals were completely at ease. Volando Urai offers hot baths, a steam room, and complimentary snacks. They have a shuttle bus, but if you miss it, there‚Äôs a nearby bus stop a short walk from the spa.

Dinner was in Ximending, but the restaurant we tried wasn‚Äôt great (unsanitary utensils). We did enjoy the xiaolongbao at Xin Fu Tang, though the bubble tea-flavored xiaolongbao wasn‚Äôt for me!

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Day 8: North Coast Tour (Private Tour with Ntcrcaoc TST-Taiwan Car Rental)
Despite the rain, we visited Yehliu, which was beautiful and reminded me of Biri Island. Jiufen was incredibly crowded and narrow; it was interesting to experience, but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs worth a second visit.

Dinner
After a week of Taiwanese food, we switched things up with Super Thai Food.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Day 9: Homebound
We kept it low-key today, started late, and just wandered around Ximending. Tried crispy donuts (similar to siakoy) and had ramen at Ramen Nagi‚Äîsafe to say, we were all a bit over Taiwanese food by then!

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Overall Thoughts:

We had fun during our stay, but most of the time, our tours felt like we were in an amazing race because everything was so fast-paced due to the travel time between different places. It was still fun, though! We did feel that the food was generally an acquired taste. Hehe

This happens with all kinds of places in all kinds of cities - tiny little noodle shops, big chain restaurants, whatever 

It seems incredibly rare for anywhere to have hours listed outside, even at some big chains. Shop hours online are often inaccurate 

Whenever I go in and ask if they're open, they act like it's an insane question - of course they're not. But there's often no visual difference I can discern between ""restaurant that is closed but the owner is sitting around"" and ""restaurant with no customers at this particular moment""

Last night I tried to go to a bar; doors open, lights on, listed as being open online. I walked up their stairs - all lit up, no other businesses in the building - and upstairs the owner and his friends are drinking at a table amid renovation supplies 

This morning I'm walking the streets of this unfamiliar town looking for a coffee and getting the same kind of thing a bunch of times in a row

How does anyone know when places are open if it's not the custom to close the door or put a sign up when closed?

There's a fundraiser underway to help support those artists directly. They're creating a deck of cards ($20) and a coffee table book ($50) featuring art that was lost in the flooding. They've already more than met their goal, but could use all the help they can get.
