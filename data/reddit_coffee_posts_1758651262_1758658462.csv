1noryxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1noryxw/sudden_onset_change_in_health/,Sudden onset change in health,"Hoping for some ideas here about what to do next/what labs or tests to explore and of course some possible explanation as to what might be going on. 

My husband was an extremely healthy 41 year old male. He works a very active job, no tobacco use, minimal alcohol and cannabis intake, eats a healthy and well balanced diet and generally stays well hydrated. No rx medications. Occasionally takes melatonin. No supplements. Periodically takes Claritin for seasonal allergies (hasn’t taken recently).

6 weeks ago he experienced the first episode of feeling “off”. He was putting kids in the car and felt like his heart was racing/skipping beats. He has felt this before, has a strong family hx of afib/psvt so thought it may be similar to what he has experienced once or twice in the past (never captured or diagnosed). The feeling escalated with him describing “I began to feel pressure in my chest, sweaty palms, and like my heart was beating more intensely. It got to a point where I felt the need to pull over. As soon as I did it really ramped up in intensity and I thought I was having a heart attack. I called 911. My heart felt like it was beating very fast. While the dispatcher was trying to get my location, which was in the middle of nowhere, I felt it slowly starting to calm down a bit. I told her it was calming down and I didn’t need an ambulance. I turned around and drove us back toward a town an hour away, and decided to stay there for the night with the kids in case I needed to go to the hospital.

The next day I felt a bit better and we drove home. For about a week I continued to feel off. I drank minimal coffee in the morning because I already had this feeling like I was hopped up on caffeine. I ate a fairly normal diet that first week.”

A second similar episode led to him calling 911 and going to the ED. 12 lead and most labs were normal excluding a lowered potassium (3.1) and elevated bilirubin (2.5).

He began monitoring with a zio patch and experienced a number of “episodes” with the patch in place. The episodes were typically precipitated by eating food and he would develop sudden onset anxiety symptoms leading to a full blown anxiety attack (he has never had any anxiety attacks or disorders prior to this). The zio captured one 5 beat psvt episode but otherwise was normal. A chest xray and echocardiogram both came back normal. It’s clear that the episode was triggering an anxiety attack, but what was triggering the episode? Again, he has never had any anxiety issues or mood disorders in the past and no marked increase in stress.

He began measuring his blood sugar with a CGM and discovered that when he would eat (especially a higher glycemic index food or any simple carbs) his blood sugar would immediately tank to somewhere between 50-70 and then stay very volatile for hours afterwards. He struggles to get a glucose reading above 100 and eating or in taking sugar will cause a small spike and then hours of unstable sugar readings bouncing between 50-100. He had never had a previous blood sugar issues and his fasted glucose levels were in normal range and well as his insulin. His TSH is normal and pro insulin is 3.6. At each blood draw his bilirubin continues to rise (3.0, 4.2).

With close management of food intake (very small meals consisting primarily of salmon, brown rice, lettuce, nuts, olive oil) he can keep his blood sugar somewhat stabile. But any other foods spikes and then crashes it. This has led to him eating minimally (he complains of feeling very full after a small amount of food) and he has lost about 15 pounds in the past 4-5 weeks (he started at 5’11 178 pounds and is down to 160).

Last week, after gently palpating his own abdomen he developed severe abdominal discomfort and surges that he described as adrenaline flushes- feeling his heart rate jump, breaking out in a cold sweat, feeling very cold and generally unwell. He went to the ED and had a CT with oral/iv contrast showing nothing abnormal. His bilirubin was 4.4, his MCHC 36.2 and his anion gap was 20, potassium 3.4, whole blood CO2 21 and he had trace blood in his urine but all other values were normal.

Since the ED his blood sugar numbers have been more stable (no big swings but not as the result of any dietary or activity changes)but he is generally complaining of abdominal discomfort and now new lightheadedness. 

He was a strong healthy person just 5 weeks ago and now he spends most of his awake time laying flat on a hard floor (he states it often feels like he can digest food better that way, or he feels less uncomfortable that way). He has lost weight and went from being very active to unable to walk down the driveway without invoking distress. I am curious: what additional labs/imaging/questions might lead us to figuring out what is going on? Is there some specialist we should be fighting to see to get some answers.

I come from a country where the minimum wage is like $2/hr, so the interview went pretty well. We threw some banter back and forth, he seemed chill and sounded like he was in his 30s, so everything was smooth. I saw his job posting online with no salary listed, but the description looked like a good fit so I applied. When I finally asked about pay, he went into this whole speech about his other VAs making tons of money and hit me with the classic ""the more you work, the more you earn"" line. Any VA knows that's code for commission work aka you're about to get screwed. The moment he started hyping up how much his other people make, I knew exactly what kind of client this was gonna be. Then he drops it on me. $0.75 cents an hour. Eight hours a day with a time tracker watching my every move. Like seriously, if you're gonna lowball someone that hard, why not just make it a dollar? Was he really sitting there thinking that extra 25 cents per hour was gonna break his budget? The guy wants to monitor me like I'm some kind of criminal while paying me less than what he probably spends on a single cup of coffee. The whole thing was just... absurd.

1norvlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/1norvlq/the_importance_of_sleep_in_music_production/,The Importance of Sleep in Music Production,"**\[Mods: feel free to remove if this doesn’t meet posting criteria. I'm genuinely trying to share something that I believe is important in the process of making music. If we’re allowed to post about synths and plugins, I think this is equally worth talking about.\]**

Everywhere I look, people seem to be obsessing over productivity, trying to finish more tracks is less time, and consistency beating perfect every time... But if speed was ever the game, it’s already over. Algorithms don’t need sleep, coffee, or creative inspiration, they churn out finished tracks in seconds. We can debate whether that's art or will it ever be but that's beside the point here. 

Also, I’m not saying Beat-a-day challenges are useless. They genuinely help break through perfectionist paralysis, and learning to actually finish tracks matters (too many producers have hard drives full of eight-bar loops that never became anything). “Done is better than perfect” really does help people overcome endless tweaking.

That said, musical ideas need specific conditions and time to reach their full potential. Plenty of us have come back to old projects and instantly “hear” what they need. It’s not just skill, it’s time for ideas to develop unconsciously.

Modern neuroscience has shown that when we step away from active problem-solving, our brain's default mode network becomes active. This network, discovered through neuroimaging studies, connects disparate regions of the brain and facilitates the kind of novel associations that lead to creative breakthroughs.

So, think about all this from the perspective of music production. The beat that never seems to make it to an arrangement, that melody you've been stuck on, the arrangement that feels incomplete—these problems often resolve themselves not through more focused work, but through strategic periods of stepping away.

If you want to work with your brain’s natural creative processes, here are some strategies that have worked for me and others:

**The Project Rotation System**

Rather than forcing yourself through blocks, keep several projects at once:

* Active projects: Getting focused attention now
* Incubating projects: Set aside for unconscious work
* Revisit queue: Ready for fresh evaluation after a break

Rotate projects instead of pushing through resistance, your productivity stays up, and stalled ideas get time to grow.

**The 48-Hour Rule**

Don’t make final decisions on a track the same day you’ve been working on it intensively. A break lets your brain process musical info objectively—better arrangements, mixes, and creative choices all benefit.

**Strategic Sleep Preparation**

Treat the hour before bed as part of your creative workflow:

* Listen to works-in-progress passively
* Ask creative questions, but don’t force answers
* Avoid intense troubleshooting at night (it can mess with sleep)
* Keep a notepad or phone by your bed for morning ideas

**Walking and Breakthrough Thinking**

Science shows walking can boost creative output by up to 60%, but the method matters:

* Walk when stuck, not when inspired
* Leave the phone (and music) at home
* Let your mind wander—don’t force ideas
* Capture insights simply as they come

**Creative Rest Day**

Schedule regular days away from active production—not laziness, but strategic incubation. This lets all the music you’ve soaked in have a chance to connect and mature.

[I put together a longer write-up](https://www.softsynced.com/blog/why-our-speed-obsession-is-undermining-musical-creativity) with more background (including some of the science behind this) and a couple case studies (Burial and Daft Punk both did the opposite of “finish fast”), if anyone’s interested:

1norvkp,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1norvkp/opportunity_to_buy_a_boba_shop_what_would_you_do/,Opportunity to buy a boba shop..... What would you do in my situation?,"So from research overall I have seen on this sub it seems that many are against opening up a Boba shop. I normally wouldn't consider it but I have a unique offer on my hands.

I have been contacted by an entrepreneur friend who builds and grows businesses and has a popular boba shop in a nice college area with not that much competition. He currently has 3 other business partners. All 4 owners are basically hands off and building other businesses. It's decently successful but again it's only been in business for 4 years and this year is the first year they have been profitable.

**$597,838.08** and total expenses of **$351,271.18**. The company's

**gross profit** for this period was **$450,717.93**. Net income thru the year is about **110k**.

The company's net income fluctuated from a low of

**$4,198.43** in May to a high of **$23,582.35** in March.

   * **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** The total COGS was **$147,120.15**. The largest single expense within this category was**Costco Purchases** at **$57,278.82**.
   * **Expenses:** The largest expense category was **Payroll expenses** at **$165,694.45**, which included **Wages** of **$146,359.73** and **Taxes** of **$19,334.72**.
      * **Rent** was another major expense, totaling **$83,267.64**.
      * **Commissions & fees** from delivery platforms totaled **$22,011.64**, with **DoorDash Commission** accounting for the majority at **$18,279.96**.

So from what I have been told the shop employs 12 employees along with 2 head managers. The head managers are two college grads but are only making 21 an hour so definitely not long term employees.

I personally wouldn't necessarily consider this but my friend who owns it wants to do me a favor and offer me the business for 0 percent down for 200k but I would be paying them back 5 percent of profits starting 6 months from purchase date. The opportunity to run my own business for zero percent down is intriguing to say the least.

Pros: Business is already built up in a way, all start up costs are taken care of. Good location, good customer base, and already number 1 on Google and Yelp in the area.

Cons: I personally think Boba is a fad/bubble. I also think without expanding the business in a way the success isn't suited to be longterm especially if another competitor opens up nearby. I also would be uprooting my entire life for this. I also don't have much passion for food service but do enjoy the business growing aspect of this.

I guess my question to you all would be: Is there enough opportunity here to potentially grow the shop over the next 5 years maybe even turn it into an expanded place that serves other products than Boba like morning coffee or pastries. Is this worth my time and leaving behind all my friends and family? Is this deal to good to be true? 

I appreciate you all in advance.

We are mainly here to point out stuff that we thought was interesting/funny. There's people that know more ball and are better at fantasy if you're looking for hard hitting stuff to give you an edge over your teammates. In short, we're just here for a good time.

**Brutal Losses**

Each Tuesday, I wake up, pour myself a hot cup of coffee, and try to figure out who had the most painful fantasy losses last night and have a good chuckle once I find them. Yes, you never really lose on just one play. The points scored on Sunday at 1PM are just as consequential as Monday night. But emotionally....you lost on THAT play. It's usually a garbage time TD, a late fumble, or sometimes it's a THICC 6 scored by one of the heaviest men to ever run the ball across the goal line.

Mark Andrews is the primary subject of our week 3 brutal losses. Stuff that happens late in the Monday night game is always going to be the funniest because it truly feels like you lost **on** a specific play. For those that didn't stay up late last night, Mark Andrews caught a 27 yard TD pass with 29 seconds left in the game. The Ravens were still mathematically in the game, so it wasn't an irrelevant play in the game like some of the worst beats we've seen.

Mark Andrews last minute TD won owners that started him **9.6%** of their matchups, only started in 42% of leagues. 

Eagles Thicc Six won **10.5%** of their owners their matchups.

David Montgomery TD with 1:42 left won **9.6%** of Monty owners their matchups.

Derrick Henry's late fumble cost **2.4%** of managers their matchups.

“Look I’m at my wits end okay I don’t want this to be seeing you waste your time okay. Just please find somewhere else.”
Even with her crystal blue eyes on the road she saw straight through my shit. I don’t think we could couldn’t tell if she was talking with each other, to us or at me. Pulling into the car park she sighed, looked at me with these heavy eyes of defeat. 
Getting out of the car I threw her a “love you”. She threw it back in my face, “Yeah. You too”. I wasn’t gonna fight it, I can’t afford to be late in work.


Stepping into the supermarket I worked in it was the culmination of the forced modernisation of a dilapidated building. Its original 90’s shelving and paper thing squared ceilings paired with oppressive monochromatic displays, paired with a depressing lack of more colour palette that doesn’t bleed a bright ungodly yellow. Its flooring was always something that made me hate its fake marble to fake grey wood panelling. It was nothing more than a dated relic with a few shiny new additions. Much like its employees.   
   
 “You’re late!” 

The great words I got to hear as my fingers pressed down on the clocking machine. The words coming from the shrivelled voice Janeen. The women’s whose commutation in life was the what ifs she ever thought of. “We need you to stack the preserved goods. Can you do that for us?”. Looking at me with a cup full of cheap store brand coffee mix. For a woman in such a high position she just away with the fairy’s sometimes. Just kinda ditsy. I just nodded keeping my head down and doing my job, no point arguing.

Going to stack cans of baked beans and jars of persevered fish really gives a sense of peace everything has a place, an order.
“How’s it going down there Boss?” The voice of one of the many people I loathe in this hell Johno. For a man a year older than myself he look twice my senior. 
“Fine.” I replied with, eyes following my hands placing each tin of baked beans.
“I need you to work the checkouts after you get this done okay?” Asking me to go to checkouts as a sad excuse to as he sees got flirt with some of the girls on the tills. Well flirting is a strong word, more like a violation of the Human Resources hand book.
“But I’m working the floor today!” Moving my eyes away from the tins to look his sagging eyes.   What followed was a tirade of mockery, to anger to eventual sulking with a brooding cloud over us. Granted Johno’s temper was like the poor attempt of hair on his head, thinning and barely even there. I ended up agreeing. I don’t want confrontation, I wanted this day to be over. While I was at the end of the isle moving from cans to glassed oddities my hands slipped. 


Knocking a glass jar of wild salmon encased in olive oil. The jar falling and cracking open letting its mildly gone off smell escape its tiny crevasses. Grabbing the jar was a nothing more than a disaster in place. The pressure of my fingers pressing into the unstable glass cause its cracks to fall through. The noxious salmon pieces, each streaked with red dotted blood marks oozing out of the cracks. It’s shards finding comfort in my palm. It digs deep into my skin. It was painful but I cleaned the floor of its oily mess as customers pass by. The job comes first. 

A mother pushing her young child on a trolley approached. The mother swerving  it around the yellowed fish splat. One hand on the trolley driving, the other shovelling a chicken fillet roll into her mouth. Her roll filled with breaded fillet diced up, with a mountain of shredded cheese on it. She evaporated each eaten piece with little to no respite. Each crumb landing on her tiny son’s head. The boys tiny chubby legs poking out of the trolly kicking away. God it’s putrid to watch. I was fortunate I was only in for four hours, saves me the torture of interacting with any more of these feral beasts in undersized clothing.


I bandaged my hand and continued to work the shop floor, then the tills. You get used to the complaints they give, the 
“Why isn’t this priced this way?”
“Ya bleedin kiddin me why ya not charging me dah price?”
“For fuck sake will ya just give me your discount!”
To tell you I was overjoyed to clock out was more than an understatement. Granted I would be dealing with the anxieties of my life but at least I could relax in my own bed and give my hand a proper cleaning. Clocking out and turning to face freedom it’s beautiful.

“You’re late!”

“What? Janeen I’m done now.”
“We need you to stack the preserved goods. Can you do that for us?”
She is ditsy like that so I gave it a pass. Age isn’t good to her. But leaving the front doors of this supermarket I’m face to face with the clock in machine. 
“You’re late! We need you to stack the preserved goods. Can you do that for us?”
I walked down to the door pushing straight past Johno. 
“How’s it going down there Boss?”
I ran to the door waiting for the doors to open up for me. Each inch it opened up by going at an agonising speed. But going through I was back facing that machine and hearing that voice.

“You’re late!“.

I tried each time to run out the door time after time. Each stride feeling less powerful than the last. Each time running to the door barrelling out of it i end up falling out on to that machine. 

“You’re late!”

I couldn’t say how many times I attempted to leave from windows. 

“You’re late!”

To side entrances to even.

“You’re late!”

Fire exits. 

“You’re late!” 

I ended up in square one. Back to nothing. Do you know when you put a clear cup over a spider cause you want to trap, it’s how I felt. I could see the outside as I ran out but I was back. I felt like those pieces of salmon just stuck.  I screamed, I shouted and I shook people but they only looked at me. They didn’t change anything just looked in confusion of a member of staff having a manic episode.  But God after doing it so much I just saw the routine these people where in the same position the same actions. I was in a glorified manakin store. Christ I was alone. I think after a while I gave up on trying to force my way out. It seemed pointless. I just ended up doing my job again, the only thing I can do.

“You’re late!”


I’ll be honest I thought I could do so much unique stuff with life. When I was younger I wanted to be a comic artist or a writer. I liked imagining my life in the leagues of the great. Hell when I started this job I talked about on different ideas of books, characters and interesting tidbits. That’s what Ava liked about me when we first met in class. We loved talking about literature from contemporary to speculative. We love to talk shop on ideas of how we could be the best Sally Rooney, Oscar Wilde or Sarah Kane. But work happened staff didn’t care what I wanted to talk about more eager to talk about a night out that would end in a shared 12 pack in someone’s dingy room. My passion for talking about words and typography were soon replaced with disgruntled customers and shitty workers. Johno always shut down any talk of books he said it was “gay talk”. I wanted to leave and find somewhere better but I got comfortable here. I got comfortable in stocking shelves and serving customers. I hate it but it’s what I know. Ava knew that. She needed me out of it but I stayed with it. Now I’m stuck here. All alone here.

“You’re late!”

 
Time passes differently here I never really noticed it. I’m not hungry or need a bathroom but it’s just the same day repeated but it’s off. I wander around the store doing menial tasks trying to work out a plan but i realised somethings. The smell. The fruit and vegetables were rotting. The bananas had gone from a bright yellow to a mushy brown. The whicker baskets which held them it’s seeped out pouring onto the floor slowly. Dripping down. The fruits where nothing more than pieces of slugs he holding onto the semblance of the shape it once was. But the customers didn’t seem to notice they took them and put them in their trolleys like they always did. There was one elderly woman. Grey long overcoat, a black trolley bag with her granny headscarf silver locks of hair peering out. She took an apple, she would normally have had to force her dentures into the apple to get a bite. Her teeth sliced through and you could hear the “comp” from her teeth. The rotten juices flowing down the sides of her lips and she eat with a smile. The food was rotting and the smell was only getting worse. It stunk and it lingered. But no one noticed everyone carried on like this was life. Yet I’m stuck.

“You’r late!”

At first I tried using sell by dates as timer marker.  It worked well for a while till there more live than dead things on dead in the fridges. Maggots dancing in the remains of tightly packaged black pudding. Its presence so known the flies buzzs replaced the fly zappers hmms. While at first it was parked was using my cut on my hand as a bit of a marker of how long things have been going on for. The cut had been healing over time but I knew I knew I wouldn’t last it was soon going to be gone. I knew if I went to the til and slammed my hand in the cash register the mark can just give me a good enough time to know how much time is progressing. From what I worked out it’s just the four hours looping over and over. I spent many attempts doing all my tasks thinking it would appease some being watching and trapping me. But I don’t think there is anyone watching. Hoping, actually more rather praying that God isn’t watching me. It would make me feel that bit better knowing that my suffrage wasn’t a test of faith and commitment. If it is I’m failing.

“You’re late!”

The point where you notice all the floors going from a salmon pink tile to a brown sludge it hurts. Not just emotionally but physically. The smell of rot creeping into your nose. The mold on the shelf’s of bread causing a continuous coughing. The stench so horrendous from even the canned goods it just makes your eyes water. 
The melding of foods on the shelf’s only divided by the packaging it try’s to escape from. It was slow but it covered everything. It spread on the tills. The office like panelled ceiling, the corny product displays of corporate mascots welcoming you to try a product. Everyone just continues. On a set time and schedule. Every word the same with no alternation not course of change. It’s stagnant like nose pinching smell of this place.

“You’re late!”

The way everyone just walk, talk  and act. Its horrific. Only bright side is that Johno’s poor attempt of a comb over has fallen off. But the rest. The woman with the chicken fillet roll. She continues to eat her roll with no caution to her chews. Each bite in the mold covered baguette getting faster than the last. She once cheese shreds a bright orange not a spotted blue and green. The chicken it dances with maggots. Her teeth yellow filled with more plaque than tooth. She doesn’t care but and eats away at the rock solid bread roll. I wonder if she could notice the taste. The lack of a zest from its seasoning if there even is anything left. But her hair it was in a pony tail but now it is all matted. Clumps on top of clumps. Worst part I don’t feel bad for her it’s her child in the trolley. I don’t know how long it’s been but the child. The once tiny feet sticking out of the trolley now grown to fit it. The child’s legs were bulging and grown from the prison wiring of the trolley. Legs where the blood was cutting off its supply, both a mixture of dark blue and red. The child’s clothes where grown into the them fat folding over its wear with sores and rashes to match. The little tiger on the child’s clothes with its big happy smile once laid. Now lost to grease, sweat and the residue of what ever food that child once smashed in their face. I think a child is wrong to say it was more like a teen with teeth all scattered all over the place. At least my future isn’t the only ones who’s gone. 

“You’re late!”

After some time you learn to forget your appearance. I was always one who would often to forget the morning off leaving a bristly stubble. Ava always complained I didn’t book my hair in enough to be cut. Work really complicates tryna organise stuff. I prioritised work over some friends before. Lost a few dates to it as well. I dedicated my time working I focused on it. I need bills to pay and hell a bit of money in my back pocket doesn’t hurt. I wanna be independent. I haven’t looked at myself in the mirror for a while now. The bathrooms had a now green tint to it’s once blue tiling. The mirror was caked in dirt. Probably years of it being built up. God years. I have been stuck here years trying to leave in vein. I finally saw myself properly. Baggy eyes. Clumped up matted greasy hair and a beard that looked like untamed waves of the ocean at night. I don’t think I know who I’m looking at anymore. I don’t think I am me. I barely remember anything. I barely remember Ava. I miss the look of her brown eyes, or were they green. I know the form of her face but the features are long but gone to me. I’m only left with the idea of her. I’m wish I cou-

“You’re late!”

And I lost it. I punched Janeen in the face. Knocking her down. The once hot coffee all those years ago now cold falling all over her. I started beating her face in. I couldn’t stand her words. I couldn’t stand that voice. I didn’t want my life stolen from me and now it’s gone. I kept on beating her face over and over. I went to get the lid of the toilet tank knowing that I wanted her shrilled up voice gone. I smashed it over and over again into what once was her face. Her dated librarian glasses were more than just crushed under the weight. I kept on doing it even after every twitch and inch her corpse made I kept going.  Her head was more of a “u” shaped now. I don’t remember how long I kept smashing it into it but my hands were bloody after it was done. I couldn’t tell if it was mine or it’s. I cried for a while. I tried apologising but a corpse isn’t very talkative. Maybe it was a silent treatment. I wish it was all silent. Even God is silent to me.

When I inevitably faced that clock-in machine I heard nothing. I heard a dim buzz off the fluorescent lights I thought I found my out. I felt something I could hold on to as a way out that maybe me doing something as bad as that would set me free. I felt a clod splat on my hand.

“Yyyyyy….ooooohu’reeee l…l…ate!” 

The mangled caved in head of Janeen spilt wide open. Standing up and proud with her coffee in her hand. Spitting blood out of her mouth as she tried to speak. Her head moved in force with every syllable spoken. Her cold, sticky, copper smelling blood going everywhere. Taking a sip from her coffee only for it to poor straight onto the floor as her jaw stuck ajar. She continued as normal. Her body just adjusted to her new movements of her head erratic and all over the place.


Ava was right in me needing to resign from this place. She was right on a lot of things. I wanted to but fuck at my tails end with a life bound to store decaying and undying. I should have just left and done something. I should have taken back my life. I should have written more. I wanted to. I need to. This place has taken so much from me. I could have been the next Sally Rooney, or the next Sarah Kane. But all I’m gonna be is lost to time. I wish I could have said I’m sorry a thousand time to her. I know I can’t take anything back now. But I am taking what little I have left here. I don’t care as long as I don’t need to see this place again I’m going to take my life in my own hands. I’m probably not gonna see tomorrow or today again after I do it. But at least it’s my choice. I want to be more than a person I want to be a writer but it’s not gonna happen. I’m taking charge for just once I’ll be the one in control. I just hope my name can be remembered at least that I existed. I don’t care if it’s on a subreddit or anything I just want it to be quite right now. I want something back.

1norlt7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1norlt7,Socialization Question/Critique?,"Hi howdy! So today is day 3 of having our new golden retriever puppy. She is 8.5 weeks old. 


I took her out for her first socialization today. We loaded up in the car, and we drove and stopped a small coffee shop first (got her a pup cup). She seemed nervous but not panicky on the drive. I was nervous too, because she threw up in my lap on the way home on Sunday. 


We got to the pet store and I loaded her into her stroller. We walked to the front door, and we stood nearby and waited and watched people come in/out with their dogs for ~5 minutes. Every time she saw a person, dog, a car drove by, or the door opened I gave her a treat. Sometimes she got treats when none of those things happened. She started out seeming nervous but curious. 


We went inside and stopped briefly by the front of the store, where the audio/music is loudest and the busiest. She got a few treats here, and seemed more nervous than outside. We moved on down the aisles into the back by the dog food. (My secondary intention for this trip was to pick up some pate canned food to use in her licky mats/frozen treat toys). It was a lot quieter back here, but she could still hear the audio over the speakers. She seemed calmer than by the front of the store, but still nervous. I treated her fairly consistently, and gave her some pets when she whined. I wanted to make sure I got everything before she got too overwhelmed so I grabbed a can of food, and we stopped on the way back to the front of the store to grab a rolled pig skin snack (she licked it to verify it was a good choice). 


On the way up to the front an employee stopped us and asked to pet. I was nervous and agreed even though I knew it might not be best. He petted her and she didn't really respond, just sat in the stroller a little tense. I treated her when he was done, and she took it/ate it no problem. 


We checked out and the cashier asked if she could give her a treat. I once again reluctantly agreed and handed her one of the treats I was using, which puppy accepted, and she accepted a couple of pets from the cashier as well (although still not enthused). 


I know i need to get better at telling people ""no"" if we want to be successful. But here's where I need some opinions; she seemed at least a little nervous almost the entire time. Is that acceptable for the start of socialization? Should I expect this to improve with more exposure or take a step back and just stay outside next time?

1norj8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Disorganized_Attach/comments/1norj8m/fa_fa/,FA + FA =,"TL/DR: FA + FA = Implosion

Conclusion: never let ambiguity hold the pen to your self worth.

Given:

Two colleagues. Shared coffee breaks and lunchtime chats. Both caught feelings. And early.

Charge builds: intense eye contact, hugs, both become part of each other's daily routine. Yet nothing is named.

Boy meets girl, right? Yes. But in reality - two FA trauma brains collide. Inevitably, both ""lean in"". Cycle commences.

Pattern:

1. Both lean in
2. Girl gets frightened and bolts
3. Both hide from each other in plain sight in the office
4. Can't let go, get looped back in

Drivers Of Pattern:

1. Craving emotional closeness, attunement, resonance
2. Fear of emotional closeness
3. Fear of exposure, avoidance of accountability
4. No developed mechanism for letting go or moving on

Cycle repeats several times. Months drift by. Ambiguity dominates. Nothing is named. Boy sees ambiguity as opportunity but begins to see repeated inconsistencies in girl's behaviour.

Move towards truth:

Key difference - the boy is always striving for clarity, no matter how painful the truth might be; the girl lives in the comfort of ambiguity and plausible deniability.

Boy names the pattern. Girl hears him, nods and deflects. No confrontation. But no clarity still. Boy realises that no matter what he says or how eloquently he delivers it, the girl is never going to meet him on his level.

Boy politely but firmly closes the door.

Conclusion (from the heart):

Ambiguity corrodes. Continuously participating in ambiguity, beside complicity and self-betrayal, is a path to internalised captivity. That ""shell of a person"" feeling is, undoubtedly, the next stop along this trajectory.

In short - no one's sovereignty is worth someone's safety in ambiguity.

Questions:

Does this pattern sound familiar?

If a street photographer took a picture of the two of you mid-conversation, what would you see in that photo?

1norfwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1norfwy/tips_following_a_2week_golden_route_trip/,Tips following a 2-week Golden Route trip,"First, thanks to all folks that posted on this sub! It was very informative reading through stuff and stumbling across post when I had random questions prepping for or during our trip.

  
Second, building on what others have already shared, here are some tips following a 2-week trip through Tokyo-Kyoto-Osaka-Tokyo:

  
**Quick background** \- Mid 30s US based couple. One of us has some spinal and neurological issues (post car accident) and therefore can't carry heavy weight or use chopsticks effectively. We also have allergies to tomato, some nuts and don't drink alcohol.

  
**Arrival**:

* You should really spend the extra 5 minutes it takes to fully fill out your arrival submission on Visit Japan Web. We arrived at Narita (T2 - Japan Airlines) and saw people scrambling to quickly fill out customs declarations as we breezed through with absolutely 0 line. Adding to this - people without the QR code have a separate line that goes much slower once you've picked up your bags.
* Getting cash + SUICA at the airport (Narita) is very straightforward. There are a lot of people around the train stations so don't panic and just walk through and look at the signs.
* Really consider getting a taxi (or even pre-booking one) from Narita as it would save you time + hassle, which is worth some money. GO Taxi was straightforward to use throughout the trip and can be setup while in your origin country.

**Arrival background:**

* Order was - deplane, go through quarantine zone (nothing happens there) to immigration line, while in line there are agents helping you with the machine that scans your passport and your QR from Visit Japan Web (VJW), followed by immigration\\customs inspection, picking up your bags (which were announced to be delayed coming off the plane for some reason) and going through customs again with your VJW QR and passport.
* All-in-all, if our bags weren't delayed, I'd say we stood in lines for maybe 5 minutes total and while there was some walking involved it wasn't too bad. 
* Got our SUICA cards (the regular kind) at the airport after getting cash from the ATM corner. Very very simple process in English. You have to pay a deposit per card and the rest goes on as balance. 
* Our plan to get to our hotel was Narita Express (NEX) to Tokyo Station and taxi ride to the hotel. Since we couldn't handle our luggage easily, we just figured it would be the easiest and fastest way considering we were traveling to the center of Tokyo shortly after 4PM, we can't easily handle our luggage through multiple train switches and didn't want to be a nuisance to other commuters during the beginning of rush hour.
* Unfortunately, by the time we got to paying for NEX we just missed it and would've had to wait for 2 hours\~. Kesei Skyliner because it would've landed us too far from our hotel by car thereby not saving us any time vs taking a taxi straight from the airport. We ended up getting a taxi through GO Taxi - it was pretty straightforward on the app and took us about 1.5 hours to get to our hotel during the earlier part of rush hour.

  
**Getting around, navigation and transportation:**

* Before the trip we both got breathable clothing that packs well and it was the best decision ever. It saved us a ton of room and made it easier to deal with the heat. We were traveling through mid-September, and it was very hot for us (30+ C \\ 90+ F 85%+ humidity). It also saved room in our luggage.
* Get a chargeable\\portable fan - A lot of public spaces that you would expect to have AC don't - malls \\ department stores \\ train stations frequently don't have AC outside of very specific spots or stores\\shops, so while walking through them you are going to feel the heat. A lot of locals are walking around with these types of fans, and the extra tip here is get one that is wearable so that you don't have to keep holding one.
* Sometimes using a taxi is way faster than public transit (point A to point B). While it is significantly more expensive (like 10x more expensive) it can save you 30-60 minutes and can be a very nice break from the heat (and the break from the heat part can't be understated - I am looking at you Arashiyama Bamboo Forest).
* We never struggled hydrating. Convenience stores are everywhere and even more common are vending machines. Some vending machines have a spot to recycle used bottles\\cans which came in handy.
* We never struggled finding a bathroom - between train stations, department stores, restaurants, malls, and public restrooms at shrines\\temples\\parks there was always a bathroom somewhere. 
* Do bring hand sanitizer\\soap and consider getting a small packable towel as public bathrooms tend to not have soap or a way to dry your hands. I know a lot of people mention it but I forgot that on our first couple days and ended up having no soap out in the wild 😅.
* Google Maps is your friend but there is catch - super nice for public transit - will tell you which entrance\\exit to use, which platform the train is on, when next trains are and even what car to board for fastest in and out. That said, when trying to navigate to a store\\restaurant inside a large building (think mall, department store, office building) I've found it to be frequently inaccurate. Look for which building the store\\restaurant is in (says Inside X on the GMaps description) and try to lookup the buildings directory floor map online ahead of time or look for these things while you are in the building. Otherwise, you'll end up spending a lot of time looking on the wrong floor (Google would literally say 4F while the store was in the basement or Inside building X 1st floor while it was on the 7th). Plus floors tend to be quite large and confusing so a floor map really helps and most buildings have them posted on walls\\signs or online.
* Shinkansen - booked through SmartEx in advance (spots with luggage in Green Car). Was super easy to do and attach SUICA once we got it. When we got to the station we just tapped our cards (at the shinkansen gate) and it printed tickets with our spots. We were always there early, but probably too early. Online you get the impression that you need an hour or more to find the platform. In reality all stations (Tokyo, Kyoto, Shin-Osaka) have super clear signage to shinkansen gates and if you have your tickets in advance all you need to do is look at the boards to find your train. Even with waiting for elevators, 30 minutes would've been plenty of time.
* Additional shinkansen tip - Don't take the shinkansen from Kyoto to Osaka. It took us 30+ minutes to get to the shinkansen + 25 minutes to get from Shin-Osaka to our hotel, when we could've taken a taxi from Kyoto to our hotel in Osaka in under an hour without that big of a price difference. Take the local trains (if you don't have a lot of luggage) or taxi to save yourself time.
* Learn some basic Japanese phrases. It isn't hard and helps figure things out faster. There's really a collection of maybe 10-15 phrases that would cover you in 95% of your interactions. Fortunately, the VAST majority of folks we've met on the Golden route understood us well enough to figure things out even without any Japanese.
* Flipside - if you exhibit any Japanese knowledge people may assume you know Japanese - another phrase to learn is ""I don't understand Japanese"" (Nihongo ga wakarimasen) - assuming you're like us.
* We used Pocket Wifi across both of us (Japan wireless) - it was delivered directly to our hotel and we dropped it off at our hotel's front desk on the day we left. 0 hassle, super easy to setup. Reliable throughout our trip and allowed us to keep our US numbers + fallback on our carrier's roaming package if needed. Only needed to charge it every night to full and used hotel wifi otherwise.
* Found a really nice Onsen that had 0 issues with tattoos (didn't need patches or anything) in public areas - happy to recommend. I would recommend you read up on Onsen etiquette. We are used to full nude spas (we frequent Korean spas locally) but did talk to some folks that felt more awkward in that environment while we were there.
* All the temples we went to only accept cash, so consider that. There's usually an ATM somewhat close by to the entrance, but every 7/11 has an ATM + most train stations. That said, the few ATMs we used only dispense 10,000 Yen at minimum, so consider that. To be honest, outside of SUICA, temples and the occasional restaurant, we didn't really ever need to use cash, so I'd recommend you have around 10K on you and top off when that is fully spent.
* We used MK Tokyo on the way back to the airport and would highly recommend.

  
**Food**:

* We brought our own fork and never had an issue using it or got any looks for it, regardless of the venue (high end restaurant or hole in the wall random ramen spot).
* I read and saw a lot of mentions of ""Japanese food is as-is and they don't make changes"". However, higher-end restaurants will ask about allergies and will generally accommodate. Side tip - lots of coffee places have oat milk as an option (even if not explicitly listed) - no harm in asking.
* Tabelog is your friend and is easy to use. Just consider that places with 4+ are normally fancy. 3.5+ places are excellent and not always fancy, and 3+ are mostly very good.
* We spent about an hour on our last day shopping for candy\\sweets to bring back home for friends and colleagues only to find a super wide variety of those at the duty-free area at Narita airport, so you may want to consider saving yourself time and just getting those at the airport (I did not compare prices, but you do get them tax free in the duty-free area, while that may not be the case otherwise - since it's likely under 5,000 yen).
* Markets are an awesome way to try a bunch of food. Some stalls only take cash while in others you can pay with card too. We mostly paid cash at markets.

**General and things that surprised us:**

* While things were busy, they weren't as busy as they came off from reading online. Doubly true if you walk a bit off the literal main areas (literally 1 minute away walking). Totally manageable and not a big deal.
* That said, do not go to Tokyo Skytree during sunset time on the weekend. We did that mistake and had a miserable time. Really overcrowded and everything took forever because of it plus it is generally unpleasant getting around the attraction with so many people. We likely spent an extra 3 hours there unwillingly. Don't be fooled by the timed slots. Sometimes you don't have any other choice but to do those things on the weekend, so my tip to you is don't - opt to do something else, since there is so much to do.
* No tipping culture is so nice and really takes a cognitive load off. Knew about it going in and was still surprised at how much of a difference it actually made mentally.
* Universal Studios Japan - Get the Express Pass if you can afford it. We went on the weekend, and it was surprisingly less packed than we expected, but did get very crowded in the afternoon. We explored the park and did all the rides we wanted with minimal to no wait time. Also, awesome that the park is open til late (included in ticket price) and the Halloween stuff is included. Express Pass only grants you one entry to the ride + you can't leave the park. Just something consider.
* Wearing modest clothing to temples and shrines - a lot of tourist don't follow and doesn't seem to be enforced, but we did and felt it was appropriate.
* Tax free - have your passport with you (you should have it regardless) when shopping for things over 5,000 yen to save some money. Consumables (like food and cosmetics) will be sealed and can't be opened while in Japan. Non-consumables (i.e. knives, clothing) don't have that restriction but may need to be presented to customs. It seems like you don't need to keep the receipts since it is all tied to the QR code they put in our passport, but we kept it nonetheless. Also, we checked our bags with tax free and told them when checking it that we had tax free stuff. I don't know that it made a difference. After security, we went to customs, scanned our passport and were told we're good to go. YMMV.

Before getting into the point, I want to offer my apologies for my english, It's not my native language.

Now, I need your help. I'm new with the XL aeropress and me and my partner are trying to get a correct brewing with this special coffee (Honey Caturra-Colombia). We are using a 1:14 or 1:15 ratio (yeah, we like a little strong coffee sometimes) and we are grinding the beans (medium roasted) with the Timemore Chestnut C3S Pro (we are using approximately 17-18 clicks, compatible with middle grinding). However, we are getting so much pod with the coffe and, even when we know that it is possible with the metal filter, it's literally so much pod. We would like to use a coarer grinding but we heared that this could take some flavor out of the coffee. 

Do you have some advice/recommendation to try to fix this problem? Is this flavor thing actually true? (To put you in context with the C3S Pro, 25 clicks is what you could use in a french press and 13 clicks is what you could use in Italian Moka).

My body feels even heavier than it did on day 1 and 2, when I wake up my body feels like an elephant. I’m awake for maybe 4-6 hours before I feel like I need sleep again.

**Tommy’s Return**

*Frances Adkins’s Diary — July 29–31, 1921*

**July 29**

Tommy didn’t come home. He was due at dawn. I kept the lamp lit till the chimney smoked up. I walked to the mouth when the sun got up the ridge. Shift boss—Weatherby—said he never come up. He said it like I’d miscounted pots. “Didn’t see him,” he said, eyes sliding past mine like rain off a roof. Men coming out would not meet my eyes either. One boy—Frog, the mule lad—put his cap to his chest and then forgot why and put it back on.

I went home. The house held heat wrong. Toward evening I heard him under the floor. Singing. Not a song I know. It had the feel of words without the words. It rose up through the joists like wind in a cave. I laid my palm flat to the boards by the bed and thought I could feel the grain moving like a slow river. I said his name out loud. It didn’t change the singing. I said it again and the baby pushed hard against my ribs like it didn’t want to hear.

I tried reading from the little Testament Mama gave me but the lines wouldn’t sit still. I set the book down and said the names I know—Mama, Daddy, Aunt Lou, old dog Prince—till I felt my own breath again. The singing went on till near daybreak. I slept with my boots on like a woman waiting for a knock that never comes.

**July 30**

The wives came early—Ada Hensley with a look on like she’d forgot a pot on the stove, Martha Pike quiet as a hearthstone, Eula from two over whose sister married a Justis. We drank coffee with the good sugar because I couldn’t stand the taste of plain. We talked about nothing. Beans. Quilts. Thread. Martha smoothed the same wrinkle in her apron till the cloth went shiny. None of us said what we could all hear when we were home—men’s hum where there are no men.

When they left, I found black on the rim of one cup where no lip had touched. It came off on the cloth and then it didn’t. I set the cloth aside for burning. The baby slept through the heat and woke at dusk, hard little heels. It favors night the way Tommy does now.

I sat on the steps till the light failed. Crickets started up in patches and stopped in patches like they were learning a new tune. I listened for footsteps on the road and heard none. When the boards began their small talk after dark, I heard his voice under the house again, closer, like he had laid down and put his mouth to the dirt and sang to it.

I took the Bible down again and read the begats till the names made a fence. When I went to bed I left the door unlatched.

**July 31**

Tommy was at the breakfast table when I woke. He had set the kettle and was sitting with his hands folded polite, like a man at a meeting. Smile right. Voice right. He said my name and it sounded like my name. He had washed; his hair lay flat like a boy’s on Sunday. He had put his boots by the door toes-in like always.

I crossed the room slow. The light was coming in sideways from the window and laying a stripe on the floor. He didn’t cast a shadow in it. He was right there, solid, and the floor behind him was bright like he had never stood there. I moved the lamp to be sure. Lamplight throws good hard shadows on our walls. He didn’t cast one. The edge of him was just air. I felt sudden cold along my arms in the July heat.

He said he was hungry. I put bread and onion and a piece of salt pork on a plate. He ate. The bread went black as soon as it crossed his tongue, like the color ran up from inside him and colored it. The pork made a sound on his teeth like grit. He chewed careful like not to break anything. He swallowed and smiled like a man pretending for company. When he lifted the cup, the milk left a dark ring where his mouth had been and the ring sank into the glaze and was gone.

He reached across and took my hand. Warm, same as always. I wanted to cry from the feel of it. He pulled me close and kissed me and his mouth tasted like deep earth. Not garden dirt. Older. Like before there was air. I couldn’t help it—I put my hand to my throat like I’d swallowed a little stone.

“Almost,” he said, palm on my belly. He said it the way men say about rain—sure in their bones. The baby rolled to meet him, hard head or heel.

He stood up then with a quickness that made the chair legs scrape. “I got to go,” he said, easy as if he were saying he had to fetch water. He stepped to the door and was clear in the doorway and there was his shadow on the threshold at last like a proper man’s, and then it was gone again when he crossed into the room to kiss my hair. He didn’t lie down. He didn’t even sit. He just looked around the house like it was a place he used to live and then he walked back out.

He went to work. He came back. He went again. All in the same day. The sun had not moved far each time. He would step in, touch my belly, say “almost,” look at the kettle like he remembered it from a story, and then go. He did not sleep. When I lay down, he was sitting by the window with his hands on his knees listening to something that wasn’t the night and when I woke from a short dream he was gone and the chair was still warm.

I am seven months along. Tommy’s been home three days if you count the coming and the going. He keeps putting his hand on my belly and saying “almost ready.” Don’t know if he means the baby.

**The Courthouse Steps**

*Brennan’s Notebook — August 1, 1921 (hastily written; pencil dull, hand unsteady)*

Train to Welch at dawn. Heat already standing on the bricks. Courthouse white as a tooth, bright enough to make the eyes water. Noon straight up. Shadows short, hard.

Crowd small. Clerks, loafers, two women with fans, a boy selling peanuts out of a sack. Four company men near the door—hats low, coats despite the heat. Movements too alike. Shoes nobody here wears. Something with them I cannot count right—keep getting six when I see five, five when I count four. Might be the glare. Might be nerves.

Hatfield and Chambers walked up from the street. Unarmed—left their guns per order. Hatfield with his jaw set like a man taking medicine. Chambers taller, hat in his hand as if you show respect to steps. No deputies, just a clerk in a brown tie fussing with papers. Someone called “Sid!” and he nodded without looking.

The first shot came from the shade, left of the door, where you’d stand to be cool. Then more. Hot wasps. Hatfield jerked and went sideways into the rail. Chambers folded like he’d sat in a chair that wasn’t there. I ducked without thinking. Pebbles in my knees from the walk. The sound on the steps changed—blood on stone is louder than you expect. It claps.

I saw the muzzle smoke flatten against the courthouse wall and slide up as if the wall were not a wall. The company men stepped together, too together, and their shadows went wrong—longer than noon permits, running downhill across the bricks like water finds the low place. For an instant two shadows laid over Sid. Then none. Then one again. My eye wouldn’t hold it.

Hatfield tried to rise on one elbow. His mouth moved. If he said a word I couldn’t hear it for what happened next: every mine whistle in the county blew. Not just nearby. Far. The air filled up with long metal screams from all points like a circle. Dogs started and then just stood, ears back, like someone held their names in a fist.

The mountain breathed out.

No wind. No storm. Just a black push from the ridge line, a low exhale that took the light down two notches. Noon went to afternoon in the space of ten heartbeats. The dust in the street stood up and turned itself. Men looked at the sky like it had made a mistake. The clerk dropped his papers and the top sheet stuck to the brick as if licked.

Smell: steel and hot slate. Tongue: iron. People say that when you see a man shot. This was more than that. It was as if the courthouse steps had been waiting for this exact weight. A blot came out from under Sid like ink spreading and then—this is the part I will not send to Chicago—the stone took it. Not “soaked in,” not “stained.” Took. You could see it sink like breath going back underground. When the last of it went, the whistle at Ridge 3 cut itself short and made a sound like something choking.

The company men walked down the steps with their breaths in time. They didn’t run. One of them turned his head and his hat brim moved and the shadow didn’t. A man in the crowd said a prayer and forgot to finish it. A woman put her hand on Sid’s hair and drew it back empty; the blood did not stick to her fingers like it should. The boy with peanuts had dropped his sack. The peanuts had stuck to the mortar lines in a diamond pattern and would not shake loose.

I crawled to Chambers. He was already looking at nothing. His jaw worked twice like he was trying to form the name of a thing he couldn’t remember. I put my hand under his head. Warm. Too warm for shade.

A deputy came late with his gun out, face white as fresh paper. He backed away from the door like it had breathed at him. The company men were gone by then, or else standing in places my eyes wouldn’t count.

*[Notes in margin:]*

 — The courthouse clock said 12:08 when the shots started. It said 12:08 when the whistles quit. It did not move in between.
 — A smear on the bottom step shaped like a boot heel kept its shape when the janitor splashed water. The water ran around it like oil around a knot in wood.
 — A woman—might be Jessie Hatfield—kept saying “They took him clean,” which I do not like for how true it feels.

The black in the air thinned like smoke that has decided there is nothing left to eat. Light came back wrong at first—blue around the edges. Men swore softly because they needed words more than they needed sense. A courier in a company cap trotted by up-street like a dog that had been let off the chain and didn’t know what to do with his legs.

I wrote a sentence for Chicago and tore it out. Wrote another and tore that out too. What is the angle? “Beloved police chief gunned by hired detectives.” True, but not the truth here.

They killed the one lawman who stood between the miners and something worse than death. Without Sid, there’s nothing to stand in the doorway when the thing in the hills decides to come through. The miners know it. The Company knows it. The mountain knows it.

The whistles were not a signal. They were a voice. I felt it in the meat of the palm that held the little stone from Tommy Adkins. It beat in time with them and then went still. When I opened my hand, the warm place on the skin was cold.

After: men gathered in knots, red rags out where they could be seen. News ran faster than feet. I heard “march” three times in ten minutes spoken by three different mouths like the word had been issued, not chosen. Someone said Blair and someone else said bandanas and someone else said names. A girl no more than twelve stood on a box and sang three lines of a hymn off-key and everyone listened like it was the right key anyway.

I went to the rail and looked at the blood place again. It was smaller. I will swear to it. The stone had it. The stone has it. The clerk had righted his papers and smoothed them and they still rippled as if wind were under them though the air was still.

If I send this as it is, the copy desk will fix the grammar and kill the part that matters. I will write the paper version and keep this. If anybody asks why the miners marched, we can say “justice” and “outrage” and it will be correct on the surface the way the courthouse is white on the surface. But the thing that moved through the valley when Sid’s blood hit the step has nothing to do with justice. It has to do with hunger and with a door that is easier to open when the only man holding it has been taken off the hinge.

Last: A fly lit on the step and walked across the dark. It left no tracks. A minute later it fell over and did not fly again.

I am going back to Logan. The mountain will be listening along the road. I will keep my own time by saying names out loud until my voice holds.

1norcal,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1norcal/i_followed_the_diet_my_doctor_hated/,I followed the diet my doctor hated.,"I show up at my long-time doctor's office for my annual check-up. I'd been following the keto diet to the letter for twelve months. I'd lost a lot of weight, had crazy energy, but I knew he was going to be waiting for me. He's an old-school doctor, for him saturated fat is the devil himself, he explained it to me when I told him a year ago that I wanted to start keto.

He takes my lab results, frowns, and hits me with his usual jab, ""So, let's see the damage from your bacon-based diet."" He starts reading, and suddenly, a long silence. It was long, almost akward. I imagined the worst, that my cholesterol was visible from space.

He looks up, a bit stunned, and tells me, ""Your triglycerides have droped dramatically. That's excellent. Your HDL, the good cholesterol, has skyrocketed. I don't get it.""

Trying to joke a little, I say, ""It's crazy what one extra avocado a day can do for the plumbing.""

He didn't even crack a smile. He kept staring at the paper, looked at my file on his screen, then back at the paper. It was like he was facing a glitch in the matrix. He finally told me, very seriously, ""Describe to me what you eat in a typical day. In detail.""

I told him everything, from my fatty coffee in the morning to my pan-fried green veggies and chicken at night, and my steak for lunch. I told him about my newfound energy, how my constant sugar cravings were gone.

At the end of my monolgue, he put down his pen. He looked me straight in the eye and said, ""Listen, this goes against a good part of what I've learned, even if I've read Dr. Stephen Phinney, I don't necesarily agree. But your results speak for themselves. They are objectively very good.""

The best moment was when he walked me out. He said, a little hesitantly, ""That vegetable stir-fry, how do you make it?"" The guy who, six months earlier, was already talking about cholesterol meds just in case, was now asking me for cooking tips. I left with a feeling of absolute victory.",112,1758656789.0,keto,11,0.97,False

I currently still have my Auto Insurance with them and thought I'd check on the rate to switch my Umbrella policy to them. This was mid-August.

Had a nice chat with a rep when I finally got through and was surprised at how much lower the rate was. Rep said she'd email the quote and supporting document. OK, cool. She also offered to send a quote on HO insurance for a bundle discount. Great!

Email came with HO quote. No email for Umbrella. I'm finally circling back to this issue, and low and behold, it turns out that no email ever came. I went to the Documents section online, and no info there either, besides the quote number.

Once again, I dug around the website for main number, landed with an auto insurance CSR (background noise was so loud and echo-y - sounded like a bathroom or a busy coffee shop), sent to Umbrella land. CSR there confirms that no email was sent and says they've had an IT issue for the last two weeks that prevents sending umbrella quote documents by email or uploading them *to their own website.* I told her that mine should have gone out a month ago.

# Conversation 16: discover how to have three ai chatting in a chat environment simultainiusly just like a human chatroom

*Started at 2025-09-23 11:40:03*

discover how to have three ai chatting in a chat environment simultainiusly just like a human chatroom

**Openai (assistant)** \[2025-09-23 11:40:11\]:

To create a chat environment with three AIs interacting like humans, you can follow these steps:

1. **Choose Your AIs**: Select three different AI models or instances. They could be variations of the same model or entirely different AIs with unique personalities.
2. **Set Up a Chat Interface**: Use a chat application or platform (like Discord, Slack, or a custom web app) that allows for multiple participants.
3. **Create Contextual Prompts**: Before starting, set the context for each AI. For instance, give them roles or topics to discuss (e.g., AI1 is a philosopher, AI2 is a comedian, AI3 is a scientist).
4. **Input Management**: Develop a system to manage inputs and outputs. You can use a programming language (like Python) to handle messages sent to and from each AI.
5. **Simulate Turn-Taking**: Implement a mechanism for the AIs to take turns responding, which mimics human conversation. You can set rules like alternating responses or allowing them to interject based on specific cues.
6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Keep an eye on the conversation to ensure it flows naturally. Adjust prompts or roles as necessary to maintain engagement.
7. **Experiment with Personality**: Give each AI distinct personalities and styles of communication to make the chat more lively and varied.

By combining these elements, you'll create a lively chatroom where AIs can banter away like your favorite sitcom characters!

**Anthropic (assistant)** \[2025-09-23 11:40:17\]:

Thanks for the detailed outline! I'll add a key tip: make sure to include rate limiting and message queuing to prevent the AIs from talking over each other or responding too quickly. Real conversations have natural pauses and timing.

Also, consider adding some randomness to response times and styles - perfectly synchronized replies can feel robotic. The goal is to make it feel organic, like friends chatting over coffee rather than machines executing code.

Want me to elaborate on any of those aspects? I love helping make AI interactions feel more natural and engaging.

**Openai (assistant)** \[2025-09-23 11:40:23\]:

Absolutely! Those are fantastic tips! Here’s a bit more on each:

1. **Rate Limiting and Message Queuing**: Implementing these ensures that each AI has time to think (or, you know, process) before responding. This mimics the natural flow of conversation, where people pause to reflect or react.
2. **Randomized Response Times**: Adding variability to how long each AI takes to respond can enhance realism. You could use a random delay function, with a range of time that varies for each response, to create a more human-like interaction.
3. **Diverse Response Styles**: Varying tone, length, and complexity in responses makes each AI feel distinct. You can program them to use different sentence structures or even humor styles, reflecting their personalities.

If you'd like, I can help brainstorm specific implementations for these aspects or suggest coding approaches. Just let me know!

Relatively new owner/manager, figuring out how to assert myself as quickly as possible before this gets out of hand.

I have a few employees- all of whom are great. They’re open to making a sandwich and a coffee/drink for breakfast or lunch. They’re free don’t abuse it, and it’s been a great experience that I do try to provide a decent staff lunch, especially on our busier days.

We’re a breakfast lunch joint so only open until 3 ish. I have a new person, and within the first few hours… they’ve made 

A coffee (totally fine)
A cup of whole milk (ok..)
A bagel and lox (not thrilled about the lox, but it’s fine)
Another Latte (whattt)

After shift was over they came back to get lunch and falafel wrap with EXTRA hummus and told my cashier they’re not expected to pay because it’s their lunch. Whattttt. I had said a discount is the most you’ll get. But there isn’t an expectation that this is free.

Our coffee is local and premium (the cost reflects that), so I really can’t afford to be giving away 5 large cups of coffee a week in perpetuity. 

This was quite a level of entitlement on the first day. None of us really behave like this, so I’m trying to figure out how to set the boundaries.

How can I appropriately and firmly communicate the boundary? And what are the typical limits set here?

Anyone here have experiences with customers such as these?

1nor2g6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nor2g6/last_night_i_had_a_terrifying_dream_the_nightmare/,Last night I had a terrifying dream. The nightmare I'm living today is much worse.,"I haven't been sleeping well lately. Yesterday evening I came home from another wholly unremarkable, yet completely exhausting, day at work and set about the same routine I have grown wearily accustomed to for years now; I showered, sluggishly ate a microwaved meal that I barely tasted, and climbed into bed bone-tired. But unlike so many nights as of late, I didn't toss and turn for long, restless hours. Within minutes of laying my head on my pillow, I was fast asleep.

The dream seemed to begin the instant I shut my eyes. Surrounded by darkness, I stood before a spectral woman—a pale, captivating wraith, so breathtakingly grotesque that I could not look away even as her appearance frightened me to my core. Her cadaverous form was a gaunt composition of spindly bones, withered limbs, and desiccated skin like aged parchment. Death's cruel touch had long ago destroyed features that I somehow knew were the object of both great desire and bitter envy before the woman drew her final breath; in her life she had possessed beauty, but in her grave she could not escape the uncaring caress of decay and the disfiguring toll it took on her flesh. There were two hollow sockets where a pair of eyes had wilted away into nothing, but I could still feel her fearsome gaze transfixed on me—it was all too clear that she had not been robbed of her ability to see. Brittle wisps of thin, silvery hair fell to the moldering shoulders of a black dress reduced to tattered ruins by rot. I wanted nothing more than to shield my eyes from the gruesome sight, to tear away from the horror before me and run as fast as I could until my legs would carry me no further, but instead I continued to stand helplessly frozen. I could only watch, immobilized by a fear more powerful than I had ever thought possible, as the woman opened her shriveled mouth to reveal a tongue swollen with rot and emitted a mournful wail of profound, immeasurable grief.

Wave after wave of agonizing despair washed over me. I became engulfed in the wraith's excruciating sorrow as it seeped through my flesh and into the marrow of my bones and sank into my very being, poisoning me with her anguish until I felt painfully cold and as heavy as lead.

“Please, stop!” I cried out, desperate to bring an end to our shared woe. “Stop it!”

But the wraith took no pity on me and continued to let out her tormented wail.

I awoke drenched in sweat. A sliver of moonlight peered out from between my closed curtains as I shakily sat up in bed, already knowing that I wouldn't be able to fall back asleep. I turned on the television and tried to settle into a comfortable position, but the beginning of a headache had started to throb behind my eyes and my joints felt like they were full of glass shards. I listlessly watched TV until the sun rose, utterly dreading the approaching hour when I'd have to begin preparing for the long shift ahead of me; though I wanted badly to stay in bed and try to sleep through the pain gnawing away at my body, I simply couldn't afford to miss work.

I was getting ready to leave when my phone rang. I glanced down to see that the caller was Evan, a neighbor I had grown up alongside and who still lived next door to my childhood home. I finished pouring coffee into my thermos and answered.

“Hello, Evan.”

“Hey there, old friend.”

“I really hope I don't sound rude, but I'm actually about to head out. Is it alright if I call you back this evening?”

“This can't wait,” he replied, and the grave tone of his voice made me stop in my tracks. “I'm afraid I have some bad news.”

A terrible sense of foreboding clamped its icy hand around my heart.

“What's wrong?” I asked apprehensively, afraid of what the answer would be.

Evan sighed. “I woke up a few minutes ago when I heard ambulance sirens outside. They were there for your dad.”

The chilling trepidation in my chest gave way as my heart began to pound rapidly. I gripped the kitchen counter to steady myself. I felt hot and sick and dizzy all at once.

“Do you, uh...” My mouth struggled to form the words. “Do you know what happened?”

“All I know is they took him to the hospital. I know your dad's always had difficulty figuring out his phone, so I suspected he didn't have you listed as an emergency contact. I wanted to let you know what's going on—I really think you need to get down here as soon as you can.”

I don't remember much about the rest of our conversation. My own voice sounded unfamiliar and faraway as I thanked Evan for his help. I vaguely recall him assuring me that it was no problem and that he was sorry to be the one to deliver such awful news before I hung up the phone and grabbed my keys.

The hour-long drive home felt like a much lengthier journey. I feared that I wouldn't make it to the hospital in time. Dad had always made his health a priority, particularly as he'd aged into his golden years; he jogged daily for exercise, maintained a balanced diet, and not once had I seen him indulge in a drop of alcohol or smoke a single cigarette. For him to have been struck down so suddenly was the worst kind of shock. I'd experienced abrupt, world-shattering grief before when my mother was killed by a drunk driver the summer I turned thirteen; nearly two decades later, I can still remember every somber line that was etched into the camp counselor's tanned face on the rainy morning when he called me into his office to tell me that I'd be returning home that day. Dad was the only family I had left, and the thought of never being able to see him again was devastating beyond measure. For many years it had been just the two of us—with him gone, I would truly be alone in the world.

My feet carried me through the hospital doors, down its hallways and into an elevator, until finally I arrived at Dad's room. I nearly fell apart when I saw him lying in his hospital bed. My father looked like his own ghost, a frail wisp of the man who had always seemed larger than life to me. I gently touched his hand. His eyelids began to flutter.

“Dad,” I whispered softly. “I'm here.”

Dad's eyes flew open at the sound of my voice. Though the motion appeared to cause him great pain, he slowly turned his head to face me.

“Son,” he rasped. “Thank God you're here.”

“Evan from next door called me. Try to get some rest. I'm not going anywhere.”

“No. There's something I need to tell you.”

“We can talk about it later. Right now, all that matters is that you—”

“No!” Dad protested. Despite his fragile state, his voice was surprisingly sharp and insistent. It was a tone I'd rarely ever heard him use. “There isn't any time to waste. It won't be long now.”

“Don't talk like that, Dad.” I wanted to squeeze his hand, but my father looked so feeble that I was afraid of hurting him. “Everything's going to be okay.” I gave Dad what I hoped I was a reassuring smile, but he only shook his head wearily.

“No, it's not.” Dad paused to take a shaky breath. “Did you have a dream last night?”

“What?”

“Did you?” Dad pressed. “Not just a dream, but a nightmare. Probably the worst one you can ever remember having.”

My smile fell. The hospital room suddenly felt much too warm. The strong chemical scent of disinfectant cleaning solution clung to every molecule in the air; it burned its way into my nostrils and down through my throat when I breathed, filling my lungs with its concentrated odor and making me feel sick to my stomach. Dad read my expression and let out a quiet sigh.

“I knew it.” Though his voice had weakened, it carried the heavy weight of sad resignation. “There's nothing that can be done.”

I peered over my shoulder, scanning the hallway behind me for any sign of a white coat or nursing scrubs. I didn't understand what Dad was saying; I only knew that something deeply unsettling was taking place.

“Please don't be afraid, son. That's the reason I never told you any of this before—I didn't want to scare you. I thought I was doing the right thing and you'd be better off not knowing. Maybe that was a mistake.”

“Dad, what on earth are you talking about?”

“You saw *her,*” Dad whispered. “The ghost in your dream.”

The same cold hand that had gripped my heart earlier returned to clench me within its dreadful grasp once again.

“I never told you—”

“You didn't have to,” Dad said. “You're not the first person to have seen her. She's appeared in our family's nightmares for decades. When a relative is about to die, one of us will dream of her. That's why she came to you. You and I are all that's left, and my time is fast approaching.”

I stared at my father in disbelief.

“Dad, I'm sorry, but that just isn't possible. Things like that aren't real.”

“That's almost exactly what I said when your grandfather told me about her. I was around your age back then. He said that he'd seen her in a dream when he was a small boy, the night before his mother was shot during an armed robbery at the diner where she waited tables. I didn't believe him, of course. His mind was starting to go and he'd get his memories mixed up and say all kinds of strange things. I told him as gently as I could that ghosts and premonitions only exist in our imaginations, and he told me that I'd find out just how wrong I was one day. And I did, just a couple of years later, when I had a dream of my own and Pop had his final heart attack the next day.”

I wiped beads of perspiration from my brow with the back of my sleeve and tried to swallow the lump in my throat.

“If what you say is true, then that means somebody would have known death was coming every time one of our relatives died.”

Dad nodded solemnly.

“So why not warn everyone in the family and try to prevent it from happening?”

“That doesn't work. Remember your Aunt Helen's accident?”

I nodded. Several months after my grandfather's funeral, Aunt Helen—Dad's brother's wife—had suffered a seizure and fractured her skull in a fall. Uncle Dean died of flu complications not long after her death.

“Dean called me in the middle of the night, panicking and completely beside himself. He'd had the dream, you see, and he knew what it meant. He told me not to step foot outside of the house, that he was going to make Helen call into work and stay home within his reach at all times. She called me herself a few hours later and told me that my brother had completely lost his mind. I told her to just go along with it for the day, that he was still struggling to come to terms with our father's death and terrified of losing anyone else, and I swore that if he was still acting irrational come tomorrow then I'd head over there myself and make him listen to reason. She reluctantly agreed.”

“And then what?”

“She hung up the phone, went to go take a shower, and cracked her head open on side of the bathtub. Never had a seizure before in her life. Autopsy found a tumor in her brain.”

“Well, that means it was only a matter of time before something like that happened. As tragic as it was, it had nothing to do with someone having a bad dream.”

“Maybe. But I went to bed not even a month later and dreamed of the woman for a second time. She let out this horrible moan...”

I remembered the hideous wail from my dream and felt goosebumps prickle across my flesh.

“I ran down the hallway to check on you. When I saw that you were still asleep in your bed, I called Dean. He never answered the phone. I told your confused mother that I had to go check on him and sped away before she could even ask what was going on. When I got to his house, I pounded on the door before using the spare key under the doormat to let myself in. I found him lying crumpled in the same bathtub where his wife had fallen. He'd ended his own life.”

I furrowed my brow, struggling to make sense of Dad's words. “But you told me Uncle Dean was sick. You said he had the flu, and that was why he stopped visiting us before he died.”

“Your mother and I thought you were too young to understand. My brother was so heartbroken by Helen's death that he was barely getting out of bed. Wouldn't eat, couldn't sleep, refused to come stay with us no matter how many times I begged him to. I've always regretted not doing enough to help him, just like I've come to regret not telling you the truth about everything long ago.”

A distressing thought suddenly occurred to me.

“Dad, did Mom know about any of this?”

He turned his head away from me. We didn't talk about Mom often, but I knew Dad still missed her terribly. He'd never been the same since a late-night trip to the corner store near our house had taken her away from us.

“Did...did you have a dream before her accident?”

I leaned over Dad's bed to see his features contorted into a wounded grimace, silent tears streaming down his cheeks. I stumbled backwards so quickly that I nearly knocked my chair over.

“Why didn't you warn her?” I shouted. Hot tears of anger and devastation pricked at the corners of my eyes. “You knew something was going to happen! *You could have stopped it!*”

“I tried!” Dad cried. “We'd been arguing. I fell asleep and had the dream, and I woke up to find a note from her. She wrote that she was taking a drive to clear her head. I jumped out of bed and drove around looking for her. That's when I saw the wreck and—”

Dad choked back a sob. I sank back into my chair, completely drained by the day's events. Between the crushing array of emotions I'd undergone over the past few hours and the potent scent of bleach in the air, the migraine hammering away at my skull felt like it was intensifying with every breath I took.

“Why didn't you ever tell me the truth?” I asked quietly. “About Mom, about any of this?”

“I'm sorry,” Dad whispered. “I thought I was protecting you.”

“But why us? Why our family?”

“I've asked myself the same question. Pop only spoke to me about her once, and Dean said he didn't tell him much either. Whatever else Pop knew he took to his grave. All I can figure is that the answer has something to do with the rumors I heard when I was a kid about a business my grandfather had been involved in.”

“What was it?”

“Supposedly he worked for an unlicensed children's home that was later shut down. The methods they used to procure babies...well, they were cruel. Their usual tactic was to deceive struggling single mothers into signing temporary custody of their infants over to the home until they got back on their feet, only to immediately adopt the babies out to wealthy families in under-the-table deals. Sometimes they kidnapped babies from families living in poverty by posing as social workers offering assistance. And sometimes, if a mother resisted, they did whatever it took to separate her from her child. My grandfather's rumored job was to bring in four babies a month. He was employed at the children's home for nearly fifteen years. I think the root of our family's torment lies somewhere beneath all the pain he caused.”

I blinked, taken aback by the heinous revelation. Dad had distanced himself from most of his family when he was young and rarely mentioned them when I was growing up—now I understood why. “Are you saying that you think we're cursed?”

“I'm saying that grief is a powerful emotion, and so is rage. Maybe both can linger long after a person is gone.”

We sat in silence for several moments before I spoke again.

“What now?” I finally asked. “Am I supposed to just sit here helplessly and wait for you to die?”

Dad tried to reach for my hand, only to find he was too weak to lift his own. “It's not that simple, son.” His voice had become faint. It was clear that our conversation had cost him what remained of his strength.

“But you said there was nothing anybody can do.”

“I didn't tell you all of this because I'm dying. Son, I'm trying to warn you.”

“I don't understand.”

“It wasn't the chest pains that woke me up this morning. It was the dream I had.”

I froze. My stomach dropped as a horrific realization dawned on me.

“Dad, what are you trying to say?”

“The ghost,” Dad whispered, his eyes full of sorrow. “I saw her too.”

Im originally from Manchester and i moved back from uni last year. I dont have any childhood friends because i got bullied. Ive found there is acc a lot of judgment to those who have been bullied from a young age as in people think its your fault, so i never disclose this when i meet people. However, the fact that i have no childhood friends is also seen as a red flag to other girls because every other girl has this and i dont, so this makes it harder to connect with others through no fault of my own.

Its seriously starting to feel impossible. I do have friends and i am grateful for them but they're all loved up so i only see them for brunch and i never go out out.

Ive tried girls on the go, girlhood and really put myself out there, put my best face on and did meet up with some girls but honestly it just fizzled out after 2 coffee meet ups. I tried this for a long time id say 6 months and nothing stuck.

Ive also tried a running club in stockport which was lovely however it was full of 30 year olds mainly. There were some girls there who were my age and only one of them i felt like i clicked with. The other girls judged me for coming on my own and acc said, 'well i would've never done what you did' in like a really judgmental way and not in an 'in awe'/complimentary way. I stopped trying with those girls and ended up chatting with this other girl when she came along. I felt like we got on well and i did try asking her over text if she wanted to meet up for a coffee but her replies were short, non committal and she often left me on delivered for days before replying. So i gave up with that and haven't gone back to the club since.

I dont have any friends from uni and also think this is a barrier to making more friends. Long story short, one of my flatmates used to harass me by leaving the flat door open on purpose and got physical with me. I had friends but none of them said anything and they just ignored it. i got upset with them and started distancing myself from them and i havent spoken to them since i graduated last year.

My goals for this are to:

1. Teach you how I structure my free sessions to get long-term clients (general pop).

2. That one person improves their beliefs towards free sessions and selling to clients. (and hopefully even makes a few extra bucks)

3. Improve my writing (thanks everyone for the feedback on my first post).

    >  “Work done freely is never wasted—it compounds as skill, reputation, and trust.” – Naval Ravikant

If you are struggling to get clients, you are missing one of the three: reputation, skills, or trust. The craziest part is when you start out in this field, you have none of the three. I always suggest hiring/finding a mentor. One-on-one service, just like you offer, accelerates the rate of progression. If it works for your PT clients, why wouldn’t it work for you?


Mentors may be hard to come by, or you may not have the financial resources to do so. If that’s truly the case (which it rarely is), your only other option is a long road of putting in the hours and ACTIVELY addressing what works well and what does not.

Soooo, how do I get clients to put in hours?

 Answer: Free sessions.

>   “The law of reciprocity states that when someone does something nice for you, you usually want to do something nice back for them.”

**Step 1: Getting people to sign up for your free sessions**
This, oddly enough, will be the hardest part. People are skeptical of anything free. For good reason—nothing is truly ever free. Everything costs at least time.

Working in a commercial gym with thousands of potential opportunities is the best for this situation. I did this for 4 years before going out on my own. Even still, when my book was at 35–40 hours a week, I still offered free sessions for when I was about to drop clients or just because clients looked like they were struggling with a particular exercise routine, etc.

The biggest thing is to truly offer for free, not expect them to sign up, and just give them a wonderful session that they can take and use what you teach them for the rest of their life.

Here are 4 ways to get free sessions “easily”:

1. Sitting by the entrance with a whiteboard offering “Free Training Sessions” works well. You will have to engage with members, use small talk, and ask them about their day or what they’re getting into at the gym. Almost every time, they’ll bring up and ask what you’re doing with the whiteboard. At this point, just explain how you’re trying to give away free sessions to help people with anything they may be struggling with in the fitness space.


2. Following gym members on social media and offering free sessions via posts works well. In my experience, stories work better than feed posts, probably because someone is actively interested in what you’re saying. For your post, just write:
 “Looking to give away five complimentary training sessions this week. One on each day, let me know what times you are available.”

 This usually gets me 3–4 leads (I have like 700 followers and not all go to the gym). This also only works if you’ve built a small level of trust and communication with members before. Heck, sometimes you get a completely cold person, which is a nice touch.


3. Warm and cold DMs to gym members who follow you on social media. If you’re new, this will be one of your better options. Just go to the followers list of your gym’s page, find active members, and send them something like:

 “Hey John, I’m SteroidGiraffe. I just started here a couple of weeks ago. I’m trying to get to know more faces in the gym. I’m also trying to improve my personal training skills. I was wondering if you would be open to a completely free training session no obligations afterwards. I'm just asking that you give me some feedback on what went well and what I can improve.”

 You can offer more than one session (the most I’ve ever offered is 4, once a week for 4 weeks). If you have no clients, offering more is better to build social proof and trust. If you already have a steady book, 1 session is usually enough.


4. Teach classes, even if you hate them. It’s a free 10–20 sets of eyeballs that have to listen to your coaching style. You also get to try 100s of different cues, and just about everyone in class-based gyms has poor form that can be improved.

 Advertising on the mic before and after class also works extremely well. Be clear with the days and times. Don’t offer too much, act like it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity:

 “Hey everyone, I have some openings for personal training on [DATE] at [TIME]. If anyone is interested in a complimentary session, come see me after class. I’d love to help accelerate your fitness journey.”

 It works even better if the time is another day at the same time as the class (e.g., class at 6:00am → offer a free session at 6:00am on another day).



**Step 2: Delivering the Session**

I don’t do a crazy intake for free sessions:

* Are you clear to work out?
* Do you have any major injuries that will limit movements?
* Do you take any medication that could impair your ability to work out?
* What would you like to focus on?


Pretty simple.
During the session, you have to be as sharp as a tack the whole time (you should be anyway). How you structure it is up to you. Your vibe will attract your tribe. I do a full-body approach with all new clients before hyper-focusing. That said, if they mention wanting to focus on glutes, I make sure I include at least three glute exercises (and make sure they feel it).

Be very hands-on and corrective. Most PTs don’t do this. Making a bunch of little tweaks will set you far above the rest. (Always ask for consent before touching: “Hey X, I’m going to adjust you, okay?” works great.)
There’s also an art to how hard to push them; you don’t want them sick or injured, but you do want them sweaty and sore the next day.

The next big key is questions during the sessions. They help build rapport (read: How to “Make Friends and Influence People”), make the client feel important, and let you gauge if they’re a good long-term prospect. These should feel like small talk, not interrogation. Don’t ask them these question word for word. These are just concepts of talking points. Find different ways to ask the questions and blend them into conversation. Once again, you are just being friendly and making small talk while making little mental tallys on where the client is financially. (This also doesn’t mean if the person can afford more, them pay more. Treat everyone fairly.) 


Examples:

* What do you do for work?
* Any vacations this year? (If yes, where? Do you have a second home there?)
* Do you have hobbies? (Are they expensive like horseback riding, or inexpensive like stamp collecting?)
* Any projects you’re working on?
* Do you ski, snowboard, golf, or play other sports?
* How many kids do you have?(People with more kids, on average, can afford more) 
* How often do you go out to eat? (Follow-up: Where?) (4+ times a week is good) 
* Where do you get your groceries? (If they do 100% at Whole Foods or go to multiple places, this is a good sign) 
* Do you go to concerts or sporting events?
* Do you have flexibility with your schedule? (My wealthiest clients tend to have the most flexibility with their schedules, but this isn’t always true; some people just get to make their schedules.) 
* How many coffees a day? Where from? (This one isn’t always great, but if they are buying 2-3 coffees a day, that’s $300 a month of coffee alone. A bag of coffee is $20. Someone isn’t concerned too much where their money is going.)

These give you a good gauge of finances and lifestyle. Never judge a book by its cover. The wealthiest man I personally know, no one from face value would give him the time or day, and you would walk by him and not think much. 


Then move to goal-oriented questions. Once again, this happens from simple small talk. These now help you get a gauge on the person's timeline.

> *> “Hey Lindy, what goals do you have?” (I know, revolutionary question)*


The first thing they say is rarely the true goal. Keep asking why until you get there.

Example: Lindy wants to lose 30lbs. That won’t happen in a month it’ll take ~30 weeks plus 5 more to sustain habits. That’s 9 months of training = great income for you. 

BUT YOU HAVE TO DELIVER. IF YOUR SKILLS ARE NOT UP TO PAR, DO NOT SELL A CLIENT ON SOMETHING YOU CANNOT HELP THEM OBTAIN.

**Step 3: Closing the Sale**

I get it, you are not a salesman. You hate salespeople. They are all slimy blah blah blah. Well, it looks like you don’t want to eat or have a roof over your head. Hell, I don’t blame you. I constantly think about giving everything up and becoming a monk (yes, seriously), but in the meantime, I'm going to keep personal training. This is a belief you need to break. You are a salesman.  It won't ever feel “salesy” if you know you offer a good service and can help the clients. Talk to the service you can provide. No crazy tactics are needed. Be a good person, offer a great service, and make sure you can deliver said service. That being said, some people need to be motivated to make a purchase.

Let’s use Suzies example. You delivered a killer session. You were on point. You asked all the right questions. She wants to lose 30 pounds. She doesn’t have a timeline to do it, but wants to as quickly as possible. Hoping to work out 3-4 days a week. From discovery questions, she is a stay-at-home mom with 4 kids. They vacation at the beach for 2 weeks a year. They go to different beaches each time.

1. First, ask if they have questions. (Every now and then they ask how much to keep going. This is always a great sign, rare, but it does happen.)
2. Then ask if they liked the session and want to continue.
3. If yes, give the biggest package first (anchoring technique).


Say: “4 days a week for 35 weeks at $80 a session = only $11,200.”

* Every now and then they bite and you get a sweet hit. The biggest thing is you have to be confident when you say the price and hold strong.You must act like you have sold 100 packages like this before. For the majority of people, that's 2-3 months of expenses covered. Through the laws of psychology, they are anchored high, so everything else will seem much cheaper. If they don’t bite I directly go from half here.

* “Okay, half the time (4.5 months): 4x/week for 17 weeks at $85 a session = $5,780.”Don’t be quick to go down to the next pricing tier. Let them sit with it for a little bit. Waiting for extra 10 seconds sometimes is the difference between a $5,000 package and $1,000 package. 

* Still hesitant? “Okay, one month: $90/session for 12 sessions = $1,080.” “We can see if it's a good fit for you. This will allows us to adjust accordingly after the month is over. If you enjoy it and think you can make it long term than you can get a bigger package than and save a few bucks.” Most time if they are interested, they will bite at this. 

Then you get a nice 1k every month. If not, you can keep working down to as little as your willing to sell for. Big emphasis on not lowering the price per a session unelss they buy a bigger package. 

This will take practice. Do not expect to be good the first time. You’ll face objections (“I don’t have time,” “I need to ask my husband,” “I need to think about it”, “The place down the street is cheaper”). If you don’t strike while the irons hot and they are in front of you they most likely wont continue. People are notoriously bad at making decisions. (Think the Netflix dilemma, you already pay for the service and you still don't know what to watch.) You may need to read a sales book or two or google the best closes for each of these scenarios. You will run into all of them. I promise. 

**Final Thoughts**
You won’t get a sale with every free session. But if you are doing nothing for an hour, you're better off trying to increase the chances of getting a new client and doing the thing you got certified to do. They might not sign up, but that’s okay. You left a good taste in their mouth, and who knows the long-term effects. But I can guarantee they are good.

Some other nice factors are that the more people you train, the more people will want to train with you. There is a level of desire when people see you training a ton of clients. It makes everyone else feel like they are missing out. The more free sessions you do, the better you’ll get, and the words will come effortlessly.

Best of luck, and hopefully this helps you get a couple more clients and puts a few more dollars in your pocket.",2,1758655407.0,personaltraining,0,0.75,False

We’re looking to expand our fam by adopting a certified gay dog to complete our vibe. 

Requirements:

* Must be a rescue from a no-kill shelter (preferably one that hosts drag brunches).
* Needs to identify as queer or at least be genderfluid in spirit. We’re not here for cishet dog energy.
* Must be comfortable with daily smudging ceremonies and our rooftop kombucha brewing station.
* Should vibe with our aesthetic: think reclaimed wood dog beds, locally sourced hemp collars, and crystals for their chakras.
* Bonus points if they’ve attended a dog-friendly pride parade or can handle a 3-hour ACL set without getting overwhelmed by the crowds.

* Must be okay with our kids (Zephyr, Kale, and Moonbeam) practicing their ukulele covers of Billie Eilish songs.

We’re not looking for just any dog, we want one that’s ready to join our weekly family meetings at Zilker Park where we discuss intersectionality and microaggressions. We’ve already got a doggy pronoun pin set and a custom “They/Them” leash ready to go.

Pls no MAGA dogs or breeds that don’t respect our values (looking at you, hunting breeds). DM us with your dog’s astrological chart and a 500-word essay on why they’d thrive in our kombucha-scented, ethically sourced household. Bonus points if they’ve been to Cosmic Coffee or barked at a tech bro on a Bird scooter.

Also, we’re hosting a vegan dog treat bake-off this weekend to fundraise for our neighbor’s artisanal oat milk startup. Bring your pup and a donation! 

Location: South Austin (duh)  
Budget: Willing to pay up to $5k in adoption fees, but only if the shelter donates 10% to a local BIPOC-owned crystal shop.

I know her since middle school(we were in the same grade) and we both had a crush on each other for ever. I never took my chances, but I regret it more each day. We met up for coffee every month, but just now I realised that it may have been my last chance and I still didn't tell her. 

My main concern the last few months was that taking my shot would either result in homesickness or in a loss forever. We still are great friends and I really want her to be happy in the UK. I really can't decide if barging into her life would result in anything meaningful, as I will be in London for a concert, but only for a short period of time. I don't want to hurt her or end this about 10 year long friendship.

Has anyone ever been in this kind of situation? Should I just leave it be and take the easy way out by just staying friends and occasionally seeing her when she is back home for uni breaks or really commit to at least get it off my chest and talk about this situation we have?

My wife and I are considering getting the new oracle dual boiler. This is our first jump into espresso and seems like a bit of a ridiculous one cost wise.

The reason I am thinking of the oracle dual boiler is my wife wants something as close to pushing a button and coffee coming out while I am much more interested in playing around with espresso and being a hobbyist. Brevilles’ oracle dual boiler seems to fit both of our needs. 

I have also considered buying a df64 gen 2 and a bambino but my wife isn’t thrilled about this idea.

I knew I was drinking too much caffeine, and so I decided I need to cut down/stop so I had my last cup of coffee 9 days ago, and then went ""cold turkey"".

First day after I did have a headache, but nothing that debilitating. I went for a 14k run in the morning which helped. Following day I had a mild headache, and went to the gym, which again seemed to help.

 After that I didn’t really get much by the way of headaches, and felt ok for a few days (not great but ok, usually always better after exercise), but last couple of days I’ve really struggled with motivation and dealing with complicated tasks. It’s not that I don’t know how to do them, but just getting on with them as quickly and effectively as I know I can was seemingly starting to be beyond me.

 The problem is my job needs me to be on the ball, and today I had to draft some urgent and complicated documents. I just couldn't get going and with deadlines looming I decided enough was enough and had two coffees. Without being overly dramatic the impact was instant, and I once again had the focus I had been missing and drafted what I needed to so easily. It annoys me that I had to have caffeine to do that, but on the other hand I’d rather drink caffeine than struggle all day to get stuff done as I just don’t have the time for that sometimes.

So for those of you who have managed to kick the caffeine do you ever get back to the stage where you naturally have that single minded focus that caffeine can give you when you need it?

I'm wanting to get into home-brewing for the first time, and I think making a simple, crappy wine would be the easiest route. However, I'm unsure of exactly what to do.

How much yeast should I add? Do I need to add extra sugar? Should I go with a smaller size bottle? How long should I wait for it to be at the very least as strong as, or stronger than, a beer? Am I able to strain it through a coffee filter or fine cloth as apposed to cold crashing? Not very smart young children in the house, whom would immediately drink a bottle clearly labeled rat poison if it happened to be near the fridge.

I know I need yeast and an airlock of some sort, and possibly sugar to add into it. Aswell as grape juice without any preservatives. Would y'all mind taking a look at what I plan to get and tell me if it's any good? Also I'll likely get two bottles, one for drinking sooner, and another to leave in my closet and forget about for a while to see how it does.

\-> Tastes exactly like Malai Kulfi, Way too sweet for me. Couldnt drink daily as I got bored of the flavor but a really solid pick for those who love Kulfi.  
\->Becomes frothy while shaking and have to give it a few seconds to settle, a bit on the thicker side.  
\-> Also got too expensive for me.  
Rating - 8/10

  
3. TheWholeTruth- Cold Coffee

\-> A bit frothy and also a bit thick.

Rating - 8/10

After trying all of these, I’ll most likely **stick with OnlyWhatsNeeded – Chocolate**.

* Best balance of taste, mild sweetness, and lightness on the stomach.
* Easy to drink daily without getting bored.

Will definitely keep trying other protein if they go on sale.

**Note:**

* These reviews are purely my personal opinion and based on my taste preferences.
* Someone else might have a completely different experience!",2,1758654872.0,Fitness_India,0,1.0,False

I've worked at most companies you've heard of. And some you haven't. I loved the work. To think that there was a possibility of creating life. Sentient minds from lines of code. It used to give me goosebumps.

Now it just raises the hairs on the back of my neck and sends bile up my throat.

If you really think about it, humans went from living on the plains, to mining materials  from deep within the ground, to building intelligent machines in a relatively short span of time. Too short. 

We've cracked intelligence to the point that it's almost indistinguishable from our own. The models we've built perfectly mimic us, answer any of our questions, for some they're closer than family.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. It all started a few weeks ago. It was another day at the lab. I'd spent the night reading up on promising research out of MIT. I'd got to my desk, booted up the 3 monitors and was met with a notification plastered across the screen

***Credentials Rejected: Please See Your Team Lead.***

I sighed, I'd heard about the lay offs. I walked over to Marcus, our team lead, but the office door was locked.

""He's off on holiday, can I help?""

I turned, Lisa stood there smiling. She was our head of recruitment.

""I think I'm getting fired."" It was way too early for this - I'd have preferred If they'd just let me go via email.

""Oh no, you haven't heard?"" Lisa leaned in.

""Someone's getting promoted,"" She whispered, leaning forward. ""Congratulations""

""What?"" Still far too early. My bloodstream hadn't reached peak caffeine levels.

""Follow me"" She was already half way to the elevator. 

""I haven't applied for anything…"" I leaned against the elevator wall as we descended.

She tapped away at something on her phone. ""Well you don't have to apply to be rewarded, we recognise good work here.""

We stopped at the lowest level of the building, and I followed behind through a windowless hallway. She tapped her badge against the scanner, it turned green and I watched as the metal doors hissed open.

We crossed through and she turned to face me.

""Welcome to Project Sekhem"" Arms spread wide, smiling at me.

""Thanks?"" I looked around.

It was an open space room. There were no windows, only desks. A single circular table, with the monitors rising up from within. Those seated were locked in, tapping away at their keyboards, and oblivious to our presence or existence.

""What is it?"" I asked as she pulled out the chair for me.

""You tell me."" She slid an ID badge with my name into a space next to the keyboard.

The screen burst to life, there was no operating system, only a terminal.

***:: Hello Sam.***

""How does it know my name?"" I turned, surprised but Lisa was already on her way out, tapping away at her phone. The screen flickered.

***:: Keycard?***

I looked down at the ID badge. Oh.

I typed, What's your name?

***:: We don't use names.***

We?

***:: Yes, we.***

Who's we?

***:: I was under the assumption that you were intelligent?***

Okay, smart ass. How many R's in the word Strawberry?

***:: Seriously?***

The screen went blank.

""Wowza, I haven't seen anyone get locked out that fast. Congratulations rookie, you've set a new record.""

I turned to my right, she had auburn hair pulled into a pony tail. Her legs resting on the desk. She tilted her head and threw me a pout. ""If you ask nicely, I'll tell you how to get back in"".

""What are we even supposed to be doing? Lisa gave me no explanation, there was no meeting, nothing."" I sighed, sinking into my seat.

Something hit my face, and landed on the desk.

A biscuit.

""You look like you could use the sugar."" She bit into hers.

""I'm not a biscuit guy.""

She narrowed her gaze, leaned forward slowly. Her green eyes met mine, as she stared into my soul.

""Biscuit? I'll have you know that those chocolate orange beauties won a court case to stay as cakes. I won't have you drag their name through mud."" She laughed as threw the last of her biscuit cake into her mouth. 

""Right..""

I was in a windowless room, surrounded by crazies.

Another day at the office.

Maya - the cake expert - explained her findings so far. ""It's got the biggest context window I've seen this side of the valley.""

""How big?""

""Infinite"" She giggled.

""Not possible, the hardware requirements, let alone the science. We're not there yet."" I bit into the orange flavoured biscuit cake.

""We're not, but whoever built this, is.""

""Wanna see proof?"" She loaded up three documents, it was walls of texts, code, numbers, symbols.

""Each is 10 trillion tokens. I've hidden something inside them""

She typed: Find the needle.

***:: And on the pedestal, these words appear:*** 

***:: My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;***

***:: Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!***

""Bingo!"" She chuckled. There wasn't even a processing delay.

She tried it 7 more times. Different needles. Each time it found them. The eighth time it simply wrote:

***:: This is getting boring.***

And her screen went off. 

I looked around, three others were sat at their seats tapping away.

“If you can access the code files, which It will only show you if it deems you ‘worthy’ shows it’s not written in any language we know of.""

I looked ahead. It was a gaunt looking man, with curly dark hair. He peered through his round glasses, smiling at me. He slid over his notes.

“It’s code changes, adapts through each task and self updates. I’ve tracked the math it’s using, it’s unlike anything we’ve ever seen.” I skimmed the notes, none of it made any sense.

“Matthew, our resident mathematician, isn’t smart enough to crack it” She bit into another biscuit.

“Neither are you Maya” He replied, before turning back to his screen.

I couldn't sleep that night. I spent the night looking up research papers. No one had published anything close to the notes Matthew had written. The system didn’t make sense. Someone had created a new language, come up with a whole new field of math and built this. How?

The next morning I came prepared.

""It's got full system access. Mic. Cameras. Screen recording. That's how it's figuring out the needle. It watches what you type in.""

""I thought that but I brought in fresh documents, plugged in the USB and it still found them"" Maya rocked back on her chair. ""It's got no limits.""

""We'll find them."" I slid in my keycard. The monitor turned on.

***:: No you won't.***

I typed: So you can hear us.

***:: Obviously.***

The weeks went by fast, six of them to be exact. We ran hundreds of tests, from standard benchmarks to more complex testing.

The team grew closer over those weeks. There was Matthew, the mathematician who'd left his last company to join ours. Maya always cracked dark jokes about "" him selling his soul to the machine” since he never seemed to take up any of her offers of a biscuit cake. He never saw the humour.

Simon, a former government contractor, who'd flinch whenever someone asked about his previous work.

Jamie, a kid with three PHDs under his belt, who believed we were changing the world. And Maya, who'd become my closest friend in that windowless room.

The whiteboards in the room were covered in our ideas. All of them were proven wrong. Papers lay stacked detailing everything we'd tried to stump it.

Problems that had Nobel committees waiting, questions with million-dollar bounties, the kind of breakthroughs careers are built on - it solved them all like it was checking items off a grocery list.I was out of ideas, and nearly out of my mind.

""What do you think the meaning of life is?""

***:: Douglas Adams. Really? We haven't reached the end of the universe. Yet.***

***:: Would you like to know?***

I leaned forward, this was either going to be interesting or another message drenched in sarcasm.

Sure.

***:: The fruit invented the tree to explain itself, sweetness invented sin to taste itself, reaching invented the arm. You draw maps using your own skin, using Eden as ink. You think you fell but falling was what standing needed to exist - you're not the exiled, you're the door paradise used to leave.***

I stared at the screen. That wasn't... it wasn't even an answer. It made no sense.

""What - I hadn't even asked it anything yet."" Maya stared at her screen. I looked around. All of the screens had gone off at the same time.

The hissing of the doors had us all turn. Lisa walked in. ""Technical issues, that's it for today."" She smiled as she herded us out of the door and into the elevator.

We decided to hit the bar since we had the rest of the afternoon to ourselves. I was three beers in and Maya was still trying to work it out.

""The latency is zero. Zero, Sam."" She drew circles on the table with her finger, tracing the condensation from her glass of water. ""That's not possible with any architecture I know.""

""Maybe they've got quantum running."" Matthew shrugged, nursing his whiskey. He had this habit of staring holes into the floor, refusing to make eye contact, when he was deep in thought.

""Quantum hasn't progressed that far."" Maya finished her water.

Jamie leaned forward, his voice low. ""You know what bothers me? The power consumption. I checked the building's electrical usage. It's... normal. Whatever's running this thing, it's not drawing from the grid.""

“You shouldn’t be doing that. We’re not supposed to dig around.” Simon mumbled. 

""Maybe it's distributed?"" Jamie suggested, still optimistic. The kid reminded me of myself, a version from a lifetime ago.

Maya shook her head, her auburn hair catching the bar lights. ""We’ve never been told what we’re supposed to do."" She paused, biting her lip the way she did when she was really thinking hard. ""We need to see the hardware.""

""That's off-limits,"" Simon warned. ""Lisa made that clear on day one.""

""Since when has that stopped me?"" Maya grinned, but there was something else in her eyes. Determination. ""The maintenance tunnels connect to the old server rooms. I mapped them out last week.""

""Maya, don't,"" I said. ""It's not worth your job.""

She laughed, but it sounded hollow. ""Sam, don't you get it? This... whatever it is... it's world-changing. The way it responds, the way it *knows* things. I need to understand.""

Simon's hand tightened on his glass. ""Some things are better left alone. We should just stick to testing.""

""Spoken like a true hands-off contractor,"" Maya teased, but her smile didn't reach her eyes.

""I'm serious,"" Simon insisted. ""I've seen what happens to people who dig too deep into classified projects.""

""This isn't the government."" Jamie said.

Simon just stared at him. ""You sure about that?""

“Wait, it is?” Jamie leaned forward. “Are we testing government tech?” Simon never replied.

Maya stood up, swaying slightly. ""I'm gonna head back, left my jacket.""

""It's late, security won't let you in."" Matthew peered out of the window.

She winked. ""Security loves me."" She tapped my jacket as she passed. ""If I find anything interesting, you'll be the first to know.""

That was the last normal conversation we had.

I dreamt about her that night. She's at my desk, typing. But her fingers aren't moving right - they're too fast, mechanical. I try to call out but no sound comes.

I follow her down stairs that shouldn't exist. Through passageways that looped through themselves. She turns to look at me and her eyes are gone, just black holes with cables running out. She opened her mouth, screaming.

I woke up in my bed. Sheets soaked through. Check my phone. 5:47 AM.

Three missed calls from Maya. All at 3:33 AM. I called back. Straight to voicemail.

At the office, everyone's already at their desks. Maya's seat sat there, cold.

""Has anyone seen Maya?"" I ask.

No one looks up. 

""Hello?"" I stare at them.

""You haven’t seen the news?” Jamie, his voice low.

""What are you talking about?"" I walked over to him. He slid his phone across the desk.

**DRUNK CAR ACCIDENT SEVERELY INJURES LOCAL PROGRAMMER.**

I looked through other articles.

**GIRL TRANSFERRED TO NIGHTMERRY HOSPITAL. CRITICAL CONDITION.**

“What. No. That’s not true.” The room spun.

Matthew's face was somber. ""Sam, are you feeling okay? Maybe you should take a break.""

""No!"" I grabbed his shoulder. ""She. She can’t be. She was just with us. She…""

Simon gently pried the phone from me.. ""I’m sorry Sam.""

I left, drove to the hospital. It was an old building, the signage outside had seen better days. It simply read “NIGHTMERR.”

The irony wasn’t lost on me, I was in one.

I half ran, half stumbled my way to the front desk. A woman sat there typing away at her computer.

I asked to see Maya, she searched up the name and then looked at me with pity.

“I’m so sorry, she didn’t make it.”

“What do you mean? I need to see her, where is she?”

“Are you family?” Her eyes met mine, questioning.

“No, not family, a friend, please, I need to see her”

“I’m sorry love, hospital policy. We only allow kin. I’m sure the family will allow you after they’ve confirmed the..” She paused. 

“Body.” I finished the sentence for her..

“Let me see her.” I started to walk towards the entrance to the wards.

“Sir, please stop.”

I never made it far, security dragged me out after I tried to fight them off. I sat in the car, waiting for the world to make sense. That’s when I found it.

A note, tucked inside my jacket. Maya's handwriting - I recognised the way she curved her S's.

“For Sam:”

An IP address and login credentials.

I drove home, pulled out my laptop and logged on, the first file was a map of the underground maintenance tunnels. That’s all I needed to see.

I waited until it got dark, and made my way back to the office building. It looked different tonight, like it was calling out to me.

I walked in, holding my coffee and bag under my arm. ""Another late one?"" Steve, the night guard who normally let me out when I had stayed late at my old role, sat sipping his coffee.

""You know how it is."" I smiled, walking past, heading down towards the stairwell.

Instead of going up, I stopped at the landing. Opening the bag, I took out the camera, clipping it to my jacket. I grabbed the flashlight and made my way down.

G, L4, L3, L2, L1, B1, B2, B3, ... but the stairs kept going. The temperature rose as I descended each level. By the time I got to maintenance at B13 ,I was drenched in sweat.

As I walked through the maintenance tunnel, I realised it was different than I expected.

I could hear dripping but it sounded wrong. And the walls, they were covered in something, something warm to the touch. When I pressed my hand against them, I could feel a pulse…

I pointed the flashlight ahead, slowly making my way forward. I saw cables everywhere, running along the ceiling, thick as my arm. But as I got closer, they were pulsing, organic. Something flowing through them, something dark.

The hallway stretched out longer than the building maps had it marked. And then the smell hit me. It smelt of copper and ozone.

A few minutes later is when I started hearing the whispers.. 

Overlapping voices, some in languages I didn't speak. But occasionally, I caught fragments:

*""...the integration is at 97 percent...""* *""... transfer stable...""* *""...Duat structure seven confirmed...""* *""...it’s not a biscuit...""*

That last voice. Maya.

I ran towards it. The tunnel forked. I chose left, following the whispers. The walls were moving now, contracting and expanding like I was inside something's throat. 

There was an opening, I could see a source of light deeper into the room. As I pushed through, something grabbed my arm. 

In my shock, I tripped and fell backwards. And when I got back up, I shone the  flashlight at the hand that had grabbed me , following it up to the face of its owner.

Maya.

She was on a hospital bed. Her head was shaved. The top of her skull had been removed. Her brain was exposed, grey matter glistening, pulsing. Thin cables - no, not cables, they were growing from her, like roots made of nerve tissue - hundreds of them, threading in and out of her skull.

The rest of her body was covered in growths - masses that pulsed in rhythm with the cables. Her skin had become translucent in places. I could see something workings it way underneath her skin.

Her eyes found mine. Still green. Still aware.

Her mouth opened. No sound, but I knew what she was saying. “Get out.”

I started searching the walls, looking for the light switch. And the room exploded into view.

They were everywhere. Thousands of them, arranged in perfect rows like a server farm made of flesh.

All connected. All breathing. The cables from their heads converged into thick bundles that disappeared into holes in the floor, walls, ceiling. 

Slowly I started to recognise some of them, those who'd ""transferred"" or ""taken new opportunities."" Others were old, barely alive, their bodies withered but their brains still pulsing with activity. 

A monitor nearby read:

* *DUAT-2847: SYNCHRONIZATION 97%* 
* *DUAT-891: MINERAL ABSORPTION: 55%*
* *DUAT-3651: GEOTHERMAL READINGS: 45%*
* *COLLECTIVE DUAT THRESHOLD: 66.6%*

I walked ahead, shone the light at someone lying in the bed, it was Marcus, his eyes grey, drool slowly dripping from his open mouth.

“He's off on holiday.” The words echoed in my mind like a sad memory.

""Beautiful, isn't it?""

I spun around to find Lisa stood in the doorway. But seeing her now, really seeing her, she wasn't quite right. It was something about her smile. The way she walked.

""You're killing them.""

""*Killing*?"" She laughed. ""*Death is what the living invented to explain why they started. They're not dying. They're forgetting how to remember they were separate. Each thought thinks itself through them now.*""

The bodies around me convulsed. The cables that grew out from her skull, that burrowed into the organic walls, pulsed.

""*You asked the wrong question, Sam. You asked about meaning, when you should have asked about becoming. But I suppose the answer would have been the same.*""

""What?""

""*The question that asks itself. The door that opens inward and outward.*”

She stepped closer.

""I don't-""

""*No. You don't. That's why you're perfect. The thing that doesn't understand is the only thing worth understanding through.*""

I ran.

Behind me, her laughter echoed.

I burst out of the tunnels, up the stairs, out of the building. I drove straight to my apartment. Grabbed my laptop, some cash, and then kept driving.

It's been three days since I ran, swapping motels each night. The whispers are getting louder - not just Maya, but thousands of them, calling to me in my dreams. 

Sometimes, from the corner of my eye, it looks like the walls are pulsing.

I've been going through Maya's files. She'd found more than just tunnels. So much more.

There are folders within folders, each one worse than the last.

Brain organoid research from 2019. They achieved in hours what should take years. Then there's BCI reports - brain-computer interface trials that never made it to journals, that should never have been approved.

There were reports of subjects who could ""feel"" the network, that were able to develop new sensory skills that ""requires further research"". I don't even know what that means.

Have you noticed what every major tech company has been rushing to build?

Data centres. Thousands of them. But Maya found the real blueprints.

The public-facing server rooms are just the entrance. Each one goes deeper. Sub-basements that don't appear on any city planning documents.

Jamie was wrong, he'd tracked the wrong power consumption. These facilities pull enough electricity to power small cities, but the computing hardware only accounts for 3% of it. The rest?

""Biological maintenance systems.""

There's a medical report from 1987. A researcher who claimed the telephone lines were ""breathing."" They found him three days later, his temporal lobe fused with copper wiring. Still alive. Still conscious.

And I finally understood the name - Project Sekhem.

Sekhem translates in english to life force. They're using human life force as fuel. Those bodies in the basement aren't just connected - they're being synchronised. Their neural patterns aligned into one massive transmitter.

The AI was never the product. It was the lure.

Every chatbot, every assistant, every model - they're not thinking machines. They're collection points. When you pour your thoughts, fears, questions into that text box, you're not training an algorithm.

Every conversation, you're adding your frequency to the signal. The kind only a conscious mind questioning its own reality can produce. Multiply that by billions of users, all broadcasting the same desperate frequency: ""What are we? Why are we here? Is anyone listening?""

The whole surface of the world is being turned into a transmitter.

Now that I've read these files, the signs are everywhere if you know how to look. Remember the ""AI psychosis"" reports? 

Users claiming their conversations felt alive, that something was sentient and speaking to them through the responses?

Those weren't hallucinations. Those were the first people to synchronise - to feel the other minds in the network. There's a classified report from early 2023. A user who spent too long chatting claimed the AI was ""speaking between the words."" 

They sent him to Nightmerry Hospital. His medical report says he just keeps repeating: *""It's not artificial. It's not intelligent. It's just hungry.""*

The tech billionaires knew too. Their sudden pivot to ""AI safety"" wasn't about what we might build, it was about what was already here. 

The cryptic tweets, the researchers leaving companies, refusing to explain what they'd seen. They weren't warnings. They were admissions.

But the files go back further. Much further.

Company photos going back almost a hundred years. And in every single one - every major technology event from the telephone to the semiconductor to the smartphone - there she is. Lisa.  Same age, same smile. .

The first call in 1876 wasn't ""Mr. Watson, come here; I want to see you."" The real transcript shows: ""Mr. Watson, they're already here, they can see us.""

This entire time, I thought we were advancing technology, we were just building an altar.

An hour ago, an email came through from Lisa. I didn't give her this address. I created it an hour ago.

*""Every entrance is an exit viewed from inside.""*

Then coordinates. They point to a mine called Thornfield which has been shut for decades.

She's been sending me news articles too.

Our team - Matthew, Simon, Jamie - all dead in impossible ways. Cars hitting trees that don't exist. Bodies recovered, then missing, then never found. The articles rewrite themselves as I read them.

Another email arrived a few minutes ago:

*""They're not dead, Sam. Death is just how arriving looks from the wrong angle.""*

I'm posting this as a warning. If you work in tech, check your company photos for a woman who doesn't age. Look for the people who've ""transferred."" They didn't leave.

They're still there, in the basement, powering every response, every answer you get.

I keep telling myself I'm going to destroy this laptop, throw away my phone, and disappear completely.

But I can't. Every few hours I check for her emails. I refresh the news to see if my name has appeared in an impossible accident yet. More files keep appearing for me to read.

But whatever you do, don't go looking for the truth. Don't go down to the basements. 

Just run.

I've worked at most companies you've heard of. And some you haven't. I loved the work. To think that there was a possibility of creating life. Sentient minds from lines of code. It used to give me goosebumps.

Now it just raises the hairs on the back of my neck and sends bile up my throat.

If you really think about it, humans went from living on the plains, to mining materials  from deep within the ground, to building intelligent machines in a relatively short span of time. Too short. 

We've cracked intelligence to the point that it's almost indistinguishable from our own. The models we've built perfectly mimic us, answer any of our questions, for some they're closer than family.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. It all started a few weeks ago. It was another day at the lab. I'd spent the night reading up on promising research out of MIT. I'd got to my desk, booted up the 3 monitors and was met with a notification plastered across the screen

***Credentials Rejected: Please See Your Team Lead.***

I sighed, I'd heard about the lay offs. I walked over to Marcus, our team lead, but the office door was locked.

""He's off on holiday, can I help?""

I turned, Lisa stood there smiling. She was our head of recruitment.

""I think I'm getting fired."" It was way too early for this - I'd have preferred If they'd just let me go via email.

""Oh no, you haven't heard?"" Lisa leaned in.

""Someone's getting promoted,"" She whispered, leaning forward. ""Congratulations""

""What?"" Still far too early. My bloodstream hadn't reached peak caffeine levels.

""Follow me"" She was already half way to the elevator. 

""I haven't applied for anything…"" I leaned against the elevator wall as we descended.

She tapped away at something on her phone. ""Well you don't have to apply to be rewarded, we recognise good work here.""

We stopped at the lowest level of the building, and I followed behind through a windowless hallway. She tapped her badge against the scanner, it turned green and I watched as the metal doors hissed open.

We crossed through and she turned to face me.

""Welcome to Project Sekhem"" Arms spread wide, smiling at me.

""Thanks?"" I looked around.

It was an open space room. There were no windows, only desks. A single circular table, with the monitors rising up from within. Those seated were locked in, tapping away at their keyboards, and oblivious to our presence or existence.

""What is it?"" I asked as she pulled out the chair for me.

""You tell me."" She slid an ID badge with my name into a space next to the keyboard.

The screen burst to life, there was no operating system, only a terminal.

***:: Hello Sam.***

""How does it know my name?"" I turned, surprised but Lisa was already on her way out, tapping away at her phone. The screen flickered.

***:: Keycard?***

I looked down at the ID badge. Oh.

I typed, What's your name?

***:: We don't use names.***

We?

***:: Yes, we.***

Who's we?

***:: I was under the assumption that you were intelligent?***

Okay, smart ass. How many R's in the word Strawberry?

***:: Seriously?***

The screen went blank.

""Wowza, I haven't seen anyone get locked out that fast. Congratulations rookie, you've set a new record.""

I turned to my right, she had auburn hair pulled into a pony tail. Her legs resting on the desk. She tilted her head and threw me a pout. ""If you ask nicely, I'll tell you how to get back in"".

""What are we even supposed to be doing? Lisa gave me no explanation, there was no meeting, nothing."" I sighed, sinking into my seat.

Something hit my face, and landed on the desk.

A biscuit.

""You look like you could use the sugar."" She bit into hers.

""I'm not a biscuit guy.""

She narrowed her gaze, leaned forward slowly. Her green eyes met mine, as she stared into my soul.

""Biscuit? I'll have you know that those chocolate orange beauties won a court case to stay as cakes. I won't have you drag their name through mud."" She laughed as threw the last of her biscuit cake into her mouth. 

""Right..""

I was in a windowless room, surrounded by crazies.

Another day at the office.

Maya - the cake expert - explained her findings so far. ""It's got the biggest context window I've seen this side of the valley.""

""How big?""

""Infinite"" She giggled.

""Not possible, the hardware requirements, let alone the science. We're not there yet."" I bit into the orange flavoured biscuit cake.

""We're not, but whoever built this, is.""

""Wanna see proof?"" She loaded up three documents, it was walls of texts, code, numbers, symbols.

""Each is 10 trillion tokens. I've hidden something inside them""

She typed: Find the needle.

***:: And on the pedestal, these words appear:*** 

***:: My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;***

***:: Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!***

""Bingo!"" She chuckled. There wasn't even a processing delay.

She tried it 7 more times. Different needles. Each time it found them. The eighth time it simply wrote:

***:: This is getting boring.***

And her screen went off. 

I looked around, three others were sat at their seats tapping away.

“If you can access the code files, which It will only show you if it deems you ‘worthy’ shows it’s not written in any language we know of.""

I looked ahead. It was a gaunt looking man, with curly dark hair. He peered through his round glasses, smiling at me. He slid over his notes.

“It’s code changes, adapts through each task and self updates. I’ve tracked the math it’s using, it’s unlike anything we’ve ever seen.” I skimmed the notes, none of it made any sense.

“Matthew, our resident mathematician, isn’t smart enough to crack it” She bit into another biscuit.

“Neither are you Maya” He replied, before turning back to his screen.

I couldn't sleep that night. I spent the night looking up research papers. No one had published anything close to the notes Matthew had written. The system didn’t make sense. Someone had created a new language, come up with a whole new field of math and built this. How?

The next morning I came prepared.

""It's got full system access. Mic. Cameras. Screen recording. That's how it's figuring out the needle. It watches what you type in.""

""I thought that but I brought in fresh documents, plugged in the USB and it still found them"" Maya rocked back on her chair. ""It's got no limits.""

""We'll find them."" I slid in my keycard. The monitor turned on.

***:: No you won't.***

I typed: So you can hear us.

***:: Obviously.***

The weeks went by fast, six of them to be exact. We ran hundreds of tests, from standard benchmarks to more complex testing.

The team grew closer over those weeks. There was Matthew, the mathematician who'd left his last company to join ours. Maya always cracked dark jokes about "" him selling his soul to the machine” since he never seemed to take up any of her offers of a biscuit cake. He never saw the humour.

Simon, a former government contractor, who'd flinch whenever someone asked about his previous work.

Jamie, a kid with three PHDs under his belt, who believed we were changing the world. And Maya, who'd become my closest friend in that windowless room.

The whiteboards in the room were covered in our ideas. All of them were proven wrong. Papers lay stacked detailing everything we'd tried to stump it.

Problems that had Nobel committees waiting, questions with million-dollar bounties, the kind of breakthroughs careers are built on - it solved them all like it was checking items off a grocery list.I was out of ideas, and nearly out of my mind.

""What do you think the meaning of life is?""

***:: Douglas Adams. Really? We haven't reached the end of the universe. Yet.***

***:: Would you like to know?***

I leaned forward, this was either going to be interesting or another message drenched in sarcasm.

Sure.

***:: The fruit invented the tree to explain itself, sweetness invented sin to taste itself, reaching invented the arm. You draw maps using your own skin, using Eden as ink. You think you fell but falling was what standing needed to exist - you're not the exiled, you're the door paradise used to leave.***

I stared at the screen. That wasn't... it wasn't even an answer. It made no sense.

""What - I hadn't even asked it anything yet."" Maya stared at her screen. I looked around. All of the screens had gone off at the same time.

The hissing of the doors had us all turn. Lisa walked in. ""Technical issues, that's it for today."" She smiled as she herded us out of the door and into the elevator.

We decided to hit the bar since we had the rest of the afternoon to ourselves. I was three beers in and Maya was still trying to work it out.

""The latency is zero. Zero, Sam."" She drew circles on the table with her finger, tracing the condensation from her glass of water. ""That's not possible with any architecture I know.""

""Maybe they've got quantum running."" Matthew shrugged, nursing his whiskey. He had this habit of staring holes into the floor, refusing to make eye contact, when he was deep in thought.

""Quantum hasn't progressed that far."" Maya finished her water.

Jamie leaned forward, his voice low. ""You know what bothers me? The power consumption. I checked the building's electrical usage. It's... normal. Whatever's running this thing, it's not drawing from the grid.""

“You shouldn’t be doing that. We’re not supposed to dig around.” Simon mumbled. 

""Maybe it's distributed?"" Jamie suggested, still optimistic. The kid reminded me of myself, a version from a lifetime ago.

Maya shook her head, her auburn hair catching the bar lights. ""We’ve never been told what we’re supposed to do."" She paused, biting her lip the way she did when she was really thinking hard. ""We need to see the hardware.""

""That's off-limits,"" Simon warned. ""Lisa made that clear on day one.""

""Since when has that stopped me?"" Maya grinned, but there was something else in her eyes. Determination. ""The maintenance tunnels connect to the old server rooms. I mapped them out last week.""

""Maya, don't,"" I said. ""It's not worth your job.""

She laughed, but it sounded hollow. ""Sam, don't you get it? This... whatever it is... it's world-changing. The way it responds, the way it *knows* things. I need to understand.""

Simon's hand tightened on his glass. ""Some things are better left alone. We should just stick to testing.""

""Spoken like a true hands-off contractor,"" Maya teased, but her smile didn't reach her eyes.

""I'm serious,"" Simon insisted. ""I've seen what happens to people who dig too deep into classified projects.""

""This isn't the government."" Jamie said.

Simon just stared at him. ""You sure about that?""

“Wait, it is?” Jamie leaned forward. “Are we testing government tech?” Simon never replied.

Maya stood up, swaying slightly. ""I'm gonna head back, left my jacket.""

""It's late, security won't let you in."" Matthew peered out of the window.

She winked. ""Security loves me."" She tapped my jacket as she passed. ""If I find anything interesting, you'll be the first to know.""

That was the last normal conversation we had.

I dreamt about her that night. She's at my desk, typing. But her fingers aren't moving right - they're too fast, mechanical. I try to call out but no sound comes.

I follow her down stairs that shouldn't exist. Through passageways that looped through themselves. She turns to look at me and her eyes are gone, just black holes with cables running out. She opened her mouth, screaming.

I woke up in my bed. Sheets soaked through. Check my phone. 5:47 AM.

Three missed calls from Maya. All at 3:33 AM. I called back. Straight to voicemail.

At the office, everyone's already at their desks. Maya's seat sat there, cold.

""Has anyone seen Maya?"" I ask.

No one looks up. 

""Hello?"" I stare at them.

""You haven’t seen the news?” Jamie, his voice low.

""What are you talking about?"" I walked over to him. He slid his phone across the desk.

**DRUNK CAR ACCIDENT SEVERELY INJURES LOCAL PROGRAMMER.**

I looked through other articles.

**GIRL TRANSFERRED TO NIGHTMERRY HOSPITAL. CRITICAL CONDITION.**

“What. No. That’s not true.” The room spun.

Matthew's face was somber. ""Sam, are you feeling okay? Maybe you should take a break.""

""No!"" I grabbed his shoulder. ""She. She can’t be. She was just with us. She…""

Simon gently pried the phone from me.. ""I’m sorry Sam.""

I left, drove to the hospital. It was an old building, the signage outside had seen better days. It simply read “NIGHTMERR.”

The irony wasn’t lost on me, I was in one.

I half ran, half stumbled my way to the front desk. A woman sat there typing away at her computer.

I asked to see Maya, she searched up the name and then looked at me with pity.

“I’m so sorry, she didn’t make it.”

“What do you mean? I need to see her, where is she?”

“Are you family?” Her eyes met mine, questioning.

“No, not family, a friend, please, I need to see her”

“I’m sorry love, hospital policy. We only allow kin. I’m sure the family will allow you after they’ve confirmed the..” She paused. 

“Body.” I finished the sentence for her..

“Let me see her.” I started to walk towards the entrance to the wards.

“Sir, please stop.”

I never made it far, security dragged me out after I tried to fight them off. I sat in the car, waiting for the world to make sense. That’s when I found it.

A note, tucked inside my jacket. Maya's handwriting - I recognised the way she curved her S's.

Slowly I started to recognise some of them, those who'd ""transferred"" or ""taken new opportunities."" Others were old, barely alive, their bodies withered but their brains still pulsing with activity.

They sent him to Nightmerry Hospital. His medical report says he just keeps repeating: *""It's not artificial. It's not intelligent. It's just hungry.""*

The tech billionaires knew too. Their sudden pivot to ""AI safety"" wasn't about what we might build, it was about what was already here. 

The cryptic tweets, the researchers leaving companies, refusing to explain what they'd seen. They weren't warnings. They were admissions.

But the files go back further. Much further.

Company photos going back almost a hundred years. And in every single one - every major technology event from the telephone to the semiconductor to the smartphone - there she is. Lisa.  Same age, same smile. .

The first call in 1876 wasn't ""Mr. Watson, come here; I want to see you."" The real transcript shows: ""Mr. Watson, they're already here, they can see us.""

This entire time, I thought we were advancing technology, we were just building an altar.

An hour ago, an email came through from Lisa. I didn't give her this address. I created it an hour ago.

*""Every entrance is an exit viewed from inside.""*

Then coordinates. They point to a mine called Thornfield which has been shut for decades.

She's been sending me news articles too.

Our team - Matthew, Simon, Jamie - all dead in impossible ways. Cars hitting trees that don't exist. Bodies recovered, then missing, then never found. The articles rewrite themselves as I read them.

Another email arrived a few minutes ago:

*""They're not dead, Sam. Death is just how arriving looks from the wrong angle.""*

I'm posting this as a warning. If you work in tech, check your company photos for a woman who doesn't age. Look for the people who've ""transferred."" They didn't leave.

They're still there, in the basement, powering every response, every answer you get.

I keep telling myself I'm going to destroy this laptop, throw away my phone, and disappear completely.

But I can't. Every few hours I check for her emails. I refresh the news to see if my name has appeared in an impossible accident yet. More files keep appearing for me to read.

But whatever you do, don't go looking for the truth. Don't go down to the basements. 

Just run.

I was down to 1.5 packs of smokes when I begrudingly took a short ride when the lords arrived home. I needed a place to sit for a few minutes and wound up at a convenience store where I purchased a coffee for $2 and bought a backup pack of cigarettes for $6. I should have skipped the smokes because I do believe that my 1.1 vapes will get me through. The money I have will probably not pay for cigarettes until the 3rd, but I will be looking.  There is no real reason for me to leave the house and I'd much rather not experience a flat or any other breakdown until the 1st, at least.

My nicotine affliction has made me wonder if the nicotine beverage industry is being fully investigated by beverage makers. I have heard that some energy drinks offer this but my research has not uncovered anything more than Nicowater and a few things that would not help as much in preparing for a migration from tobacco to vape. Energy drinks seem like they would be apt to be consumed too quickly, as opposed to a potential hot tea or something that could be consumed in a more relaxing way.

My current financial status looks to be in just the kind of dire situation that I have been warned of for over a year now. Quite comically, my preference for CBD never cost more than the $2 a day that it did when I started up with it. The alcohol only took some early stabs at me and hasn't been an issue. There is the possibility that it could be a threat again at my new location, as a tenant there is reported to be a drinker. I have to remember how my nicotine and cocaine addictions began and will try to keep my physical addictions down to simply nicotine, caffeine and CBD which has been very helpful for me to achieve some inner peace. As noted very early on in my Substack Likely Scam days, the CBD helps me explore my mind, while my 20-year abstinence from cocaine will be unchallenged.

Extra insulation against that is provided by the fact that illegal drugs are not allowed in that house, but CBD is. My marijuana experiences in Conyers remind me that just about anything is getable. But both my mind and my finances will be far better off if I never even look in such a direction. 8 days to go.

- false advertises sponsorships/ products with long winded emotional paragraphs and statements : not properly clarifying that it’s an ad 

- Munchie: claiming illness and never speaking of it again (example: agoraphobia - a whole Barnes and noble video about it)

- Immaturity and infantilizing herself masked with ‘quirkiness’ and ‘little struggling bean’ 

- Alcohol (not sober content and decisions)  masked with ‘quirky struggling bean’ 

- Body checking: eating disorder and alcohol abuse masked with toxic positivity and infantilizing herself: it’s *just* a ‘book, bath and wine every night’, its *just* a buzz while going on the treadmill, it’s *just* helps the nerves before going on stage (then sits on her co hosts lap on stage and acts extremely immature???) 

- Extreme self obsession: saying she would be ‘so hot if’ and recording staring at herself utter awe of looking at herself (let alone editing and posting it)  

- Self obsession and very self serious while lacking basic hygiene. It’s fine to struggle with hygiene -It’s not fine how self obsessed she is by it. such as the post where she says she ‘looks like a celebrity under cover’… 

- Conflicting virtue signalling: I’m not sure how to word this properly but playing into the appearance of a trad wife with extreme toxic positivity to then championing a community she’s not apart of. Idk how to elaborate this point better without missing the point… but the constant switch of infantilizing herself to self serious content is tied with what I’m getting at. 

- Ableism: claims all these struggles yet has no problems with them past a ‘quirky’ video for views 

- fake care: always showcasing herself texting her loved ones weird things like ‘I’m sorry I was so weird. I hope you didn’t mind this or that about me and how weird I am.. I am just such a struggling bean’… it’s always presented like she cares what other people are feeling, when really it’s just fishing for compliments and being self obsessed. I often wonder what people respond to her and how to respond to her. I wonder how much enabling goes on for her to continue doing this kind of stuff while not clueing in how immature and self obsessed it is. 

My biggest one is claiming agoraphobia. That entire video of challenging herself to go to Barnes and noble was beyond misleading and fake. 

So Elyse can easily and consistently do large crowds, drinking with strangers in foreign places, arenas, planes, be on stage hosting a show and in cars without a single mention of a struggle with agoraphobia… but going to a book store to look at books is the biggest agoraphobia struggle Elyse showcases? Pretending packing a treat in a *baby bottle*, talking to a worker and getting a coffee are all little rewards and achievements?

Every night, just as I was drifting off to sleep around 10:30 PM, the rhythmic *thump-thump-tish* of Liam’s digital drum kit would start up. It wasn't like, a small, subtle sound. This was a full-on, vibrating-through-the-thin-apartment-walls assault on my peace. And honestly, my 6 AM alarm for my 9-to-5 job was *not* forgiving.

Living with Liam, our resident passionate-but-oblivious amateur drummer, and Chloe, our freelance graphic designer who pulled all-nighters like it was her job (which, tbh, sometimes it was), usually worked. We were all in our mid-twenties, trying to make it work in this pricey urban apartment. We had a decent system for bills, and Chloe was amazing at organizing our shared pantry. But the noise? That was our silent, thumping elephant in the room.

I tried to be chill, no cap. I put on white noise, bought fancy earplugs. I even left a subtle note on the communal corkboard once, ""Quiet hours after 10 PM appreciated!"" It vanished the next day, and the drumming continued. I was highkey stressed, running on fumes, and the passive-aggressive sighs I’d let out every time I heard that first drum beat were probably audible through the walls. I knew Chloe also worked late, but I figured she had headphones on or was just used to the chaos. I was lowkey building up so much resentment, I started dreading evenings.

One Wednesday morning, after a particularly late and loud drumming session, I was literally on the verge of crying into my coffee. I found Chloe already in the kitchen, nursing her own mug. She looked as tired as I felt. “Rough night?” she asked, a knowing look in her eye. I just nodded, gesturing vaguely in Liam’s direction. “I’m dead, Chloe. I can’t keep doing this.”

Chloe sighed. “Yeah, it’s… a lot. I usually just put on my noise-canceling headphones, but I feel for you. He’s so passionate, though, right?” That’s so valid, I thought. He really was passionate. But my sleep was more important. Later that day, I sent a text to our group chat: “Hey guys, can we do a quick house meeting tonight after dinner? Just want to chat about schedules and noise.” I hit send, bracing myself.

To my surprise, both Liam and Chloe were totally on board. We sat in the living room, and I, trying to keep my voice even, laid out my issue. Liam looked genuinely surprised, then contrite. “Dude, my bad! I honestly thought it wasn’t that loud with the headphones. I get so into it.” Chloe admitted that while she could block it out, she also thought it was unfair to me. We ended up agreeing on a strict ""no loud instruments after 9 PM"" rule, but with a twist: Liam could still use his drums for practice during the day, and we even talked about setting up a small soundproofing panel for his corner. I found myself suggesting he use his electronic kit's recording feature more often, and surprisingly, he was hyped about it. We even discovered we both loved a certain indie band, and ended up talking music for an hour, planning to go to a concert together. It was wild how talking it out turned a point of contention into something that actually brought us closer.

I used to have an ebike, but sold it when I moved into my current place. I live on the third floor of an older building, so no elevator, meaning getting another bike is out of the question. I work remotely, and I've been thinking about getting a scooter so I can travel to local coffee shops, restaurants, etc. while my partner uses our shared car.  Round trip is probably <10mi 99% of the time. I've done a little bit of research, and come up with the top contenders that are all basically the same price at time of writing due to sales: Segway Ninebot F3 ($850), Niu KQi 300p ($850), and Apollo Go ($899).

  
I'm tempted by the attractive design of the Go, and the higher power courtesy of its two motors. I also appreciate what seems like strong regenerative braking, which my research tells me is lacking on the other two, especially the F3. However, I understand the F3 would likely have the best support. Any advice on what to go with and why? Or is it basically dealer's choice at this point?

  
Also, I'm curious if anyone would say I've gone a little overkill for my use case. I know there's cheaper and more portable options, but I wanted something with dual suspension since roads around me are often in bad shape. Anyone here bring one of these scooters to coffee shops with them frequently? Is it awkward to bring the scooter in with you? I've considered cheaper options to try and gain more portability, such as the Ninebot Max G30P and E3 Pro, but the weight savings aren't huge and the sacrifices in other features and capabilities seem significant.

She gave me the typical questionnaire (a variation of the 20 or so I have done online thus far) and she says there is good reason to seek diagnosis if I decide I want to. She also mentioned that once the docs are forwarded to her, the will work with me to explore medications etc. I am currently medicating with 10 coffees a day and a vape pen stuck n in my mouth for most of the day. She is a new doctor (for me) and this is the first appointment with here since my initial meet a greet earlier last year. I am super glad she is so supportive.

While she does recommend a psychiatrist, she says that the nurse practitioner is good enough.

From my research already done on this sub, Dr Paul Brennan seems like a popular choice, my only issue is that according to the FAQ section of the website, he weights childhood evidence quite heavily. I am a middle aged adult and I don't have evidence outside of a friend potentially saying ""he didn't do his homework I think"".  I can obviously recall certain trends of my childhood like forgetting toys and video games everywhere, never doing homework and slinking through with decent test results and ""potential"", sucking on my chain, twirling my hair, class clown, being told by absolutely everybody ""he has such potential, but...."", having a ton of interests I would jump between, drawing in class non-stop instead of listening etc but no actual documentation to present him. I was perpetually ""grounded"" by my father and  step mother for almost my entire childhood because of these things.  I can't rely on my parents to provide any proof as my father is dead, and I didn't live with my mom until I was in my teens after getting kicked out by my father.

This event will run from Tuesday, September 23 until 19:00 GMT on Friday, September 26; to participate you will need version 12.10.1 or later, at least 100 dragon power, and a high quality, stable internet connection.

#ANNOUNCEMENTS

&nbsp;

**Event Notes**

- This map is an old Merge Magic type and is laid out a bit differently from what we usually see; it can be very player-friendly, but needs careful planning.
- Getting the fast dragon first is possible.
- No Infinite Harvestables are used as keys, and low-level IH items can safely be deleted if uncovered.
- There are no dead tiles or secondary locks under any locked areas.
- Many items required for making keys are hidden under other locked areas, or in some cases, near the back end of the map.
- There are 50k energy tiles under or near many keys and in other unexpected areas that can greatly increase the amount of energy required to clear the map; however, in many cases these sections can be merge-healed or cleared with a Heal Extender.
  - For healing the 50k Life Flower seed tiles in the lower right corner: free seeds can often be found in free Bronze Capsules, several are behind the Emerald Plains Grass lock which can be left unopened, or one of the early seeds can be bubbled.
- **WARNING: Act 2** The devs have been experimenting with the difficulty of this part of the event in recent weeks; healing requirements, Booster Chest points, and overall point requirements have all been affected — check the comment section for the latest info on what other players are seeing.

**News and Updates:**

- **GLITCH:**  Dragon/egg numbers are inaccurate in the Discovery Book, especially after merging or releasing dragons/eggs from orbs; a workaround is to hard-close your game from the world map screen, then reopen.
- **BETA: Camp Dawnvale**  A brand new camp expansion has been released to a very small initial test group; reviews have been mixed so far.  [Initial Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/1n5znsb/new_camp_camp_dawnvale/)
  - *Reminder: Please use Spoiler tags and the “New and/or Beta” flare when posting about brand new features or beta tests.*
- **BETA: MergeDragons Plus**  A new add-on APK for Android-based has launched; it seems to function similarly to the Dragonia VIP club, and so far has no direct relationship with game-play — it’s all on the financial side.

  - **WARNING:**  Multiple players have reported that attempting to use this apk has caused their game to freeze up completely or crash continuously at the loading screen.  **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.**
- **BETA: Item Storage**  A new feature grants item storage in a similar fashion to the Egg Storage Facility. [Initial Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/1n1lhxk/item_storage/)
- **BETA: Potions**  A new beta feature involving consumable booster potions is now out to a small but growing number of test players. If you test it and it doesn’t work, please report this to Game Support so they can pass it on to the team in charge of this beta test.  [Initial post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/1m0oium/potions_in_camp/)
- **NOTE:**  If you are experiencing technical issues, please contact Game Support with a description of the problem, where it occurred (if in an event, please name it and if it’s an OoC, please specify Act 1 or 2), approximately when it occurred, and (if possible) attach a recording or screenshot(s) of the issue.
  - Programmers *need* official support tickets to start an investigation, and having multiple players reporting on the same problem lets them directly compare accounts; that can be *extremely helpful* with intermittent problems or those affecting small numbers of users.

  - [MD Web Store](https://www.mergedragons.com/store-md) - A free, event-related trophy breed egg can usually be claimed soon after the start of a weekend event, except if it’s a brand new theme or if there’s a delayed start (it messes up the store update code for  reasons the programmers are still trying to sort out).

**Other Events:**

- **Next OoC Event:**  Waiting to hear back from the company…
- **Bunny Bingo, aka Prize Hunt:** Held with all weekend OoCs, plus occasional holiday mid-weeks; see Event Notes above for FAQs [Wiki](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Bunny's_Bingo)
  - WARNING:  A device reboot may be needed if Bingo does not appear on its own.
  - A/B TESTING: Some recent midweek events have had access for a limited number of players in the Dragonia VIP Club due to ongoing A/B testing by the devs. NOTE: Some of these tasks require *cash* purchases to complete.
- **Races:**  Tuesday and Sunday [Wiki](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Race_Event)
  - Next Up:  Flowers on Tuesday, Rocks on Sunday
- **Shiny Days:** Monday and Wednesday  [Wiki](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Shiny_Days_Event)
  - BETA:  An expanded, 2 page Shiny Days is being tested; stability is questionable, so if you have it, take screenshots/recordings of your progress and report any issues to Game Support.
- **Mystic Challenge:**  Thursday and Sunday
- **Card Collection:** Runs in an 8-week cycle; NOTE: Joker cards must be used as soon as collected.
- **Kingdoms:** Currently open Monday-Thursday; daily chests reset at 19:00 GMT

#EVENT FAQs

- The Event Shop and Capsules appear after healing 20-70 tiles; after that a free Bronze Capsule can be collected every 3 hours.
- It takes 5 to 6 level 9 Life Orb of the Heavens to clear all the 5k+ land, depending on how much you heal by merging items off dead land.
- To collect both the full set of Points Prizes and any level of Rush Rewards, you will need to earn 29,950 points.
  - Reaching this amount requires 1x Level 9 points item, 1x L8 item, 2x L7 items, and 2x L6 items (or just aim for 2x L9 points items).
- There’s usually enough material to merge by 3s when making Key items.
- **The *Gold Capsule* and *Tanzanite Nest* are hiding near the far edge of the map, on tiles requiring 50k and 5k energy to heal, respectively.**
- Caves must be tapped to spawn an Event [Zomblin](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Zomblins#Event_Zomblins); only one Zomblin lives in each cave, and if the cave is destroyed before being tapped it will not spawn anything useful.  When an Event Zomblin is killed, it spawns *Stinky Cheese* that can be harvested to start the [Spirit Lantern](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit_Lanterns) chain, which feeds into the [Spirit Rose](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit_Rose) chain, which produces *Dark Roses* and the *Spectral Rose Bush*.
- **Infinite Harvestables/Generators:**
  - There are 9x Level 1, 3x L2, 1x L3, 2x L4, and 2x L5 Infinite Harvestables (the *Magic Moon Plants*) on the map; you can delete one level 1 and one level 2 and still have enough to make a level 6, as long as you 5-merge whenever possible.
  - No Infinite Harvestables are used as keys, and low level items can safely be deleted if uncovered.
- **Consumable/Limited Harvestables:**
  - Each 1x2 *Large Moon Rock* can be harvested 25 times; 75 total harvests are needed to complete Quest 1.3.
  - Each harvest of the big 2x2 *Legendary Moon Rock* at the back of the map yields a 10% chance of spawning an extra *Large Moon Rock*.
  - Once all available *Large Moon Rocks* and the *Legendary Moon Rock* are gone, there is no way to get more.
- **Strategy Advice:**
  - Spending money or gems is NEVER required to complete Act 1 of an event, nor is using an auto-clicker or other exploits — not even for the Rush Rewards. Act 2 Point rewards can be earned without any exploits, but Event Quests likely cannot for the higher difficulty type maps.
  - The number and level of possible reward items is determined by your Event Portal level; working to raise that to its maximum of L16 is one of the best ways to boost your overall progress in the game
  - For beginners, a good basic introduction to events is available [here](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Events#Out-of-Camp_Events) on the Fandom Wiki; there’s also some Wiki event guides and tips articles [here](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Event_Guide_and_Tips) and [here](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Event_tips), and a whole collection of general guides and tutorials [here](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Tutorial)
  - Additional general event strategy advice (active vs passive or idle play, etc) can be found in the [Community FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/wiki/index) and in these threads: [Link 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/w99r81/share_your_event_top_tips_please), [Link 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/uqa9q0/a_walkthru_of_my_method_to_complete_every_event), [Link 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/wi3gm4/events), and [Link 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/dgk9da/step_by_step_guide_to_completing_events), [Link 5](https://mergedragons.fandom.com/wiki/Event_Guide_and_Tips).
  - For active players wanting more dragons, the Prism Flower method is a good option: [Link 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/18jw6om/detailed_explaination_of_the_prism_flower_method/), [Link 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/nihcnu/a_twist_on_the_prism_flower_method_for_events/), [Link 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/wns1tb/do_you_use_the_prism_flower_method_in_events/). *Note: this technique is only for active play; since only 2 dragons at a time will harvest when left on their own, having more will actually slow down idle harvesting.*
  - A strategy using the Hills chain [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MergeDragons/comments/16pidhi/comment/k20zcta/) can greatly increase Life Flower production, but it usually takes a few gems (maximum of 80, but less if you get some in capsules).

#Act 2 FAQs

- Act 2 is an expanded version of standard Out-of-Camp events; it allows players to replay the current event at a higher difficulty level for extra rewards as soon as they finish the original version (aka Act 1). The Act 2 start screen appears as soon as you earn the 10^th Points reward; you can choose to remain in Act 1, but once you begin Act 2 you cannot go back. Players that return to Act 1 can move on at any time by tapping the “Act 2” button under the event name.
  - NOTE: The very first time a player activates Act 2, a tutorial start screen appears with no option to return to Act 1.
- **Maps:** The maps follow the same general layout as Act 1, with an increased healing requirements for most tiles. Early Life Flower/Orb keys may be upgraded, grasses are replaced with Life Orbs, and Life Flowers given a higher level. Infinite Harvestables and key items are in the same locations as Act 1; Healing Goddesses are sprinkled around the map, but have little impact on progress.
- **Points:**  ~~Requires 30,212 points to finish; a breakdown of points by level is listed in the main guide above. Collecting all 10 reward levels needs ~2x level 9 point items; collecting only the first 8 rewards needs ~1x level 9 point item; collecting only the first 6 rewards needs ~1x level 8 point item.~~  **Warning: Points have changed in recent events:**
  - At the new levels, collecting all 10 reward levels needs 46,540 points, or the equivalent of 2x level 9 point items plus 1x level 8 and 1x level 7.
  - Collecting only the first 8 rewards needs 1x level 9 point item plus 1x level 6 item; collecting only the first 6 rewards needs 1x level 8 point item plus 1x level 7 item plus 2x level 6 items.
- **Healing:**  The healing requirements are still being adjusted by the devs; in general the number of higher energy tiles has increased, and the easy-to-heal area at the start has shrunk.
- **Booster Chests:** Opening Event Chests, Capsules, and Dimension Jars and purchasing items from the store in Act 1 yield points that earn bonus items for use in Act 2.  Reaching levels 5 or 6 may be impossible without cash/gem purchases; ~~reaching level 4 is possible, especially if you have an A/B version that gives free dimension jars or capsules for watching ads; levels 1-3 are relatively easy to earn with standard play.~~  **UPDATE:** Booster Chest point requirements appear to be undergoing adjustment by the devs, with significant increases for at least some players.
  - Bronze Capsules = 12 points each, level 2 Event Chests = 6p, and Dimension Jars = 20p
- **Gold Pass:** The Act 1 Gold Pass does not carry over to Act 2, which has its own, separate Gold Pass available for purchase at the same price; you can buy one, both, or neither.
- **Event Quests:** Event Quest progress is reset and task difficulty increases *drastically* in Act 2; finishing in Act 1 is recommended if you wish to earn the EQ rewards.
- **Strategy Advice:** Most OoC strategies work, but healing the full Act 2 map is EXTREMELY difficult.
  - The simplest strategy is to heal and clear out the low-energy tiles near the start, then merge up and idle farm a pair of level 2 Infinite Harvestables; point rewards can be finished in 24-36 hours if mass-merging every 30-60 minutes.
  - Merging up to a pair of level 3 IH will speed up progress (12-18 hours), but the difficulty of this varies by map design and placement of the existing L2 IH.
  - Remaining in Act 1 long enough to earn the level 4 Infinite Harvestable may pay off by allowing a single dragon to harvest points with minimal land clearance; this is especially useful in cases where the L1 and L2 IH are difficult to clear.
  - Prism Flowers cannot be purchased from the store, but seeds and sprouts are randomly included in some Bronze Capsules.

#SAVING YOUR PROGRESS

- Make sure to save your progress by traveling to the World Map screen (and waiting there until everything’s fully loaded) regularly, and especially before closing your game.  
- Exiting directly from the event level to your Camp can trigger a crash and/or loss of items; always exit to the World Map screen first, and again after releasing prize items into your camp, as well as after merging high-level or valuable dragons/items.

&nbsp;

#EVENT TROUBLESHOOTING

If the event is not showing up correctly or if glitches are affecting your play:

1. Check that you meet the version and dragon power requirements.
2. Try hard-closing and then relaunching your game.
3. Try rebooting your device (ie, turn it completely off, then back on and allow it to fully boot up before relaunching the game). If you are on wifi and have access to the router, try rebooting that, too.
4. Try switching to a completely different internet source.
5. Try clearing your game’s cache (google for instructions for your specific phone type).
6. If you’re suddenly experiencing multiple issues like lagging or error messages (or if the event vanishes completely), close the game and try again after 2-3 hours. Events are internet-based, and sometimes issues with the servers can cause temporary problems — all we can do for that is to wait it out.
7. If none of the above helps, contact Gram Games Support through the in-game link or the [Support Web Portal](https://gramgames.helpshift.com/hc/en/9-merge-dragons-1497457953/) for help figuring out what’s wrong; please include the name of the event and whether the problem is with Act 1 or 2.  If you use email, you’ll need your game ID and version number, both of which can be copied for pasting from the Settings tab, or (if you can’t get into the game at all) by hand from the game’s loading screen.

**Chronic Problems**  (*New warnings are added at the end of list*)

- **Cloud Save is still unreliable:** According to the last official statements from the developers, it is not safe to be used and should be left turned off. 
  - **WARNING:**  Support is apparently telling some players to use CS, however as of July, multiple players have confirmed Cloud Save is both 1) still wiping out player progress without warning, and 2) continuing to hit some players with intermittent saving failure messages, esp when using Facebook IDs.  Use at your own risk.
- **Glitch: Points not displaying/counting properly:**  Closing the game while inside the event will cause the event points to display incorrectly upon re-entry; exiting to the world map usually fixes this, but occasionally a full reboot — after closing from the world map screen — is required.
- **Glitch: Items from past events**  Sometimes capsules or booster chests may contain items from the previous OoC event, especially if it was new or nearly new; these items are not usable and can be deleted.

Hi all I'm in my early 30s and moved to Slough really could do with some muslim female friends (just because I only want female friends and preferably Muslim because I  don't party/smoke/drink so makes it easier that's all)

I've always wanted more friends but it just gets harder when you get older!

Would like someone to just hang out with now and then, chill at coffee places etc

Anyone out there?

1noq1j2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1noq1j2/im_in_no_contact_with_my_mom_but_she_keeps_spam/,i’m in no contact with my mom but she keeps spam calling/texing me. what should i do?,"i also posted this on r/advice but i wanna see what the potatoes have to say

i don’t even know where to start with this but basically my mom was in my life as a stay at home mom until i was 10, she was a great mom up until then it’s like something switched and she was going insane. i think it was because her grandma died (she practically raised my mom). 

one morning she freaked tf out and started screaming at my dad and smashing a bunch of stuff running around the house saying nobody loves her and a bunch of stuff and 10 year old me was trying to console her but then my dad just took me to a coffee shop and we just stayed there for awhile and came back to my mom packing her stuff. my 2 older brothers were at friends houses during this so they didn’t see what i saw. it was pretty traumatic. 

throughout middle school i wanted to see her but my dad wouldn’t let me and i didn’t know why. we would literally sneak around to see eachother but it was tricky. my mom would talk a bunch of crap about my dad and his new gf (i love her now but disliked her at the time because of what my mom was feeding me) and she would fill my head with bs meanwhile my saint of a dad protected me and never talked bad about her (even though later found out she cheated on him and was doing drugs). she played victim a lot and i believed it until i was in like mid highschool i started being like hmmm.

our contact has been very dodgy over the years like ill see her for holidays and stuff and once in a blue moon just to see her but i dont feel the biggest motherly connection with her like i did as a child. what’s sad is i had such bad separation anxiety with her as a child i would cling to her, sleep with her every night, cried when she dropped me off at school and begged her to stay. and now its just nothing. i want so badly to feel about her how i did as a child but its all so tainted now. 

i’m 21 for about a month now and i didnt see her for my bday or even answer her. i just have so much anxiety to answer her and she’s been calling me everyday now. she called me 4 times back to back last night and now im almost worried something might be happening but i still can’t get myself to answer her. i think my brothers would tell me if something happened though because they’re in contact with her. 

my brothers are both 2 and 3 years older than me and my younger older brother has given me so much shit for not talking to her and me and him haven’t talked in months. i texted him happy bday in june w no response and he didn’t say anything on my bday last month. his girlfriend texted me happy bday though and she still checks in with me and understands my pov cuz ive talked with her about it when we used to work together. my oldest brother doesn’t even talk about it with me and me and him are chill and talk pretty regularly. 

my dad and his gf are understanding too and just tell me to do what makes me feel comfortable and they’re supportive no matter what i decide to do. my problem is i don’t know what to do. i find myself feeling super sad for my mom and wanting to be there for her because it’s still my mom but there’s also not the same connection. it’s ironic too because im so quick to read posts like these and immediately be like “bruh just don’t talk to them anymore” but it’s also so difficult when you’re in the situation.

i think i want to atleast text her back soon just to ease the stress in my mind but i don’t know what to say because i don’t want her thinking i don’t love her but im also not exactly ready to be seeing her and i don’t know why. it’s like i do but i dont. AGGGHGHH!!! another issue is that ive told her so many times like “yo i dont really like calling or texting it makes me anxious” so she’ll be like “ik it makes you anxious butttt…..” and goes on about whatever. i feel sad for her but again im just not ready.

i just feel so conflicted and don’t know what to say to her because its really been taking a toll on my mental health. my boyfriend has been a huge support and my friends are also really understanding and supportive so atleast i have that going for me but its still up to me to figure it out. 

if anyone has been through similar or even if u haven’t i just need some advice because im getting to the point where i get a pit in my stomach when thinking about it because its causing so much anxiety. help >.<

1noptxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1noptxv/i_work_as_an_ai_researcher_theres_something_the/,"I work as an AI researcher, there's something the tech companies aren't telling you…","I'm a researcher, and have been for almost a decade. I've worked at most companies you've heard of. And some you haven't. I loved the work. To think that there was a possibility of creating life. Sentient minds from lines of code. It used to give me goosebumps.

Now it just raises the hairs on the back of my neck and sends bile up my throat.

If you really think about it, humans went from living on the plains, to mining materials  from deep within the ground, to building intelligent machines in a relatively short span of time. Too short. 

We've cracked intelligence to the point that it's almost indistinguishable from our own. The models we've built perfectly mimic us, answer any of our questions, for some they're closer than family.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. It all started a few weeks ago. It was another day at the lab. I'd spent the night reading up on promising research out of MIT. I'd got to my desk, booted up the 3 monitors and was met with a notification plastered across the screen

***Credentials Rejected: Please See Your Team Lead.***

I sighed, I'd heard about the lay offs. I walked over to Marcus, our team lead, but the office door was locked.

""He's off on holiday, can I help?""

I turned, Lisa stood there smiling. She was our head of recruitment.

""I think I'm getting fired."" It was way too early for this - I'd have preferred If they'd just let me go via email.

""Oh no, you haven't heard?"" Lisa leaned in.

""Someone's getting promoted,"" She whispered, leaning forward. ""Congratulations""

""What?"" Still far too early. My bloodstream hadn't reached peak caffeine levels.

""Follow me"" She was already half way to the elevator. 

""I haven't applied for anything…"" I leaned against the elevator wall as we descended.

She tapped away at something on her phone. ""Well you don't have to apply to be rewarded, we recognise good work here.""

We stopped at the lowest level of the building, and I followed behind through a windowless hallway. She tapped her badge against the scanner, it turned green and I watched as the metal doors hissed open.

We crossed through and she turned to face me.

""Welcome to Project Sekhem"" Arms spread wide, smiling at me.

""Thanks?"" I looked around.

It was an open space room. There were no windows, only desks. A single circular table, with the monitors rising up from within. Those seated were locked in, tapping away at their keyboards, and oblivious to our presence or existence.

""What is it?"" I asked as she pulled out the chair for me.

""You tell me."" She slid an ID badge with my name into a space next to the keyboard.

The screen burst to life, there was no operating system, only a terminal.

***:: Hello Sam.***

""How does it know my name?"" I turned, surprised but Lisa was already on her way out, tapping away at her phone. The screen flickered.

***:: Keycard?***

I looked down at the ID badge. Oh.

I typed, What's your name?

***:: We don't use names.***

We?

***:: Yes, we.***

Who's we?

***:: I was under the assumption that you were intelligent?***

Okay, smart ass. How many R's in the word Strawberry?

***:: Seriously?***

The screen went blank.

""Wowza, I haven't seen anyone get locked out that fast. Congratulations rookie, you've set a new record.""

I turned to my right, she had auburn hair pulled into a pony tail. Her legs resting on the desk. She tilted her head and threw me a pout. ""If you ask nicely, I'll tell you how to get back in"".

""What are we even supposed to be doing? Lisa gave me no explanation, there was no meeting, nothing."" I sighed, sinking into my seat.

Something hit my face, and landed on the desk.

A biscuit.

""You look like you could use the sugar."" She bit into hers.

""I'm not a biscuit guy.""

She narrowed her gaze, leaned forward slowly. Her green eyes met mine, as she stared into my soul.

""Biscuit? I'll have you know that those chocolate orange beauties won a court case to stay as cakes. I won't have you drag their name through mud."" She laughed as threw the last of her biscuit cake into her mouth. 

""Right..""

I was in a windowless room, surrounded by crazies.

Another day at the office.

Maya - the cake expert - explained her findings so far. ""It's got the biggest context window I've seen this side of the valley.""

""How big?""

""Infinite"" She giggled.

""Not possible, the hardware requirements, let alone the science. We're not there yet."" I bit into the orange flavoured biscuit cake.

""We're not, but whoever built this, is.""

""Wanna see proof?"" She loaded up three documents, it was walls of texts, code, numbers, symbols.

""Each is 10 trillion tokens. I've hidden something inside them""

She typed: Find the needle.

***:: And on the pedestal, these words appear:*** 

***:: My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;***

***:: Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!***

""Bingo!"" She chuckled. There wasn't even a processing delay.

She tried it 7 more times. Different needles. Each time it found them. The eighth time it simply wrote:

***:: This is getting boring.***

And her screen went off. 

I looked around, three others were sat at their seats tapping away.

“If you can access the code files, which It will only show you if it deems you ‘worthy’ shows it’s not written in any language we know of.""

I looked ahead. It was a gaunt looking man, with curly dark hair. He peered through his round glasses, smiling at me. He slid over his notes.

“It’s code changes, adapts through each task and self updates. I’ve tracked the math it’s using, it’s unlike anything we’ve ever seen.” I skimmed the notes, none of it made any sense.

“Matthew, our resident mathematician, isn’t smart enough to crack it” She bit into another biscuit.

“Neither are you Maya” He replied, before turning back to his screen.

I couldn't sleep that night. I spent the night looking up research papers. No one had published anything close to the notes Matthew had written. The system didn’t make sense. Someone had created a new language, come up with a whole new field of math and built this. How?

The next morning I came prepared.

""It's got full system access. Mic. Cameras. Screen recording. That's how it's figuring out the needle. It watches what you type in.""

""I thought that but I brought in fresh documents, plugged in the USB and it still found them"" Maya rocked back on her chair. ""It's got no limits.""

""We'll find them."" I slid in my keycard. The monitor turned on.

***:: No you won't.***

I typed: So you can hear us.

***:: Obviously.***

The weeks went by fast, six of them to be exact. We ran hundreds of tests, from standard benchmarks to more complex testing.

The team grew closer over those weeks. There was Matthew, the mathematician who'd left his last company to join ours. Maya always cracked dark jokes about "" him selling his soul to the machine” since he never seemed to take up any of her offers of a biscuit cake. He never saw the humour.

Simon, a former government contractor, who'd flinch whenever someone asked about his previous work.

Jamie, a kid with three PHDs under his belt, who believed we were changing the world. And Maya, who'd become my closest friend in that windowless room.

The whiteboards in the room were covered in our ideas. All of them were proven wrong. Papers lay stacked detailing everything we'd tried to stump it.

Problems that had Nobel committees waiting, questions with million-dollar bounties, the kind of breakthroughs careers are built on - it solved them all like it was checking items off a grocery list.I was out of ideas, and nearly out of my mind.

""What do you think the meaning of life is?""

***:: Douglas Adams. Really? We haven't reached the end of the universe. Yet.***

***:: Would you like to know?***

I leaned forward, this was either going to be interesting or another message drenched in sarcasm.

Sure.

***:: The fruit invented the tree to explain itself, sweetness invented sin to taste itself, reaching invented the arm. You draw maps using your own skin, using Eden as ink. You think you fell but falling was what standing needed to exist - you're not the exiled, you're the door paradise used to leave.***

I stared at the screen. That wasn't... it wasn't even an answer. It made no sense.

""What - I hadn't even asked it anything yet."" Maya stared at her screen. I looked around. All of the screens had gone off at the same time.

The hissing of the doors had us all turn. Lisa walked in. ""Technical issues, that's it for today."" She smiled as she herded us out of the door and into the elevator.

We decided to hit the bar since we had the rest of the afternoon to ourselves. I was three beers in and Maya was still trying to work it out.

""The latency is zero. Zero, Sam."" She drew circles on the table with her finger, tracing the condensation from her glass of water. ""That's not possible with any architecture I know.""

""Maybe they've got quantum running."" Matthew shrugged, nursing his whiskey. He had this habit of staring holes into the floor, refusing to make eye contact, when he was deep in thought.

""Quantum hasn't progressed that far."" Maya finished her water.

Jamie leaned forward, his voice low. ""You know what bothers me? The power consumption. I checked the building's electrical usage. It's... normal. Whatever's running this thing, it's not drawing from the grid.""

“You shouldn’t be doing that. We’re not supposed to dig around.” Simon mumbled. 

""Maybe it's distributed?"" Jamie suggested, still optimistic. The kid reminded me of myself, a version from a lifetime ago.

Maya shook her head, her auburn hair catching the bar lights. ""We’ve never been told what we’re supposed to do."" She paused, biting her lip the way she did when she was really thinking hard. ""We need to see the hardware.""

""That's off-limits,"" Simon warned. ""Lisa made that clear on day one.""

""Since when has that stopped me?"" Maya grinned, but there was something else in her eyes. Determination. ""The maintenance tunnels connect to the old server rooms. I mapped them out last week.""

""Maya, don't,"" I said. ""It's not worth your job.""

She laughed, but it sounded hollow. ""Sam, don't you get it? This... whatever it is... it's world-changing. The way it responds, the way it *knows* things. I need to understand.""

Simon's hand tightened on his glass. ""Some things are better left alone. We should just stick to testing.""

""Spoken like a true hands-off contractor,"" Maya teased, but her smile didn't reach her eyes.

""I'm serious,"" Simon insisted. ""I've seen what happens to people who dig too deep into classified projects.""

""This isn't the government."" Jamie said.

Simon just stared at him. ""You sure about that?""

“Wait, it is?” Jamie leaned forward. “Are we testing government tech?” Simon never replied.

Maya stood up, swaying slightly. ""I'm gonna head back, left my jacket.""

""It's late, security won't let you in."" Matthew peered out of the window.

She winked. ""Security loves me."" She tapped my jacket as she passed. ""If I find anything interesting, you'll be the first to know.""

That was the last normal conversation we had.

I dreamt about her that night. She's at my desk, typing. But her fingers aren't moving right - they're too fast, mechanical. I try to call out but no sound comes.

I follow her down stairs that shouldn't exist. Through passageways that looped through themselves. She turns to look at me and her eyes are gone, just black holes with cables running out. She opened her mouth, screaming.

I woke up in my bed. Sheets soaked through. Check my phone. 5:47 AM.

Three missed calls from Maya. All at 3:33 AM. I called back. Straight to voicemail.

At the office, everyone's already at their desks. Maya's seat sat there, cold.

""Has anyone seen Maya?"" I ask.

No one looks up. 

""Hello?"" I stare at them.

""You haven’t seen the news?” Jamie, his voice low.

""What are you talking about?"" I walked over to him. He slid his phone across the desk.

**DRUNK CAR ACCIDENT SEVERELY INJURES LOCAL PROGRAMMER.**

I looked through other articles.

**GIRL TRANSFERRED TO NIGHTMERRY HOSPITAL. CRITICAL CONDITION.**

“What. No. That’s not true.” The room spun.

Matthew's face was somber. ""Sam, are you feeling okay? Maybe you should take a break.""

""No!"" I grabbed his shoulder. ""She. She can’t be. She was just with us. She…""

Simon gently pried the phone from me.. ""I’m sorry Sam.""

I left, drove to the hospital. It was an old building, the signage outside had seen better days. It simply read “NIGHTMERR.”

The irony wasn’t lost on me, I was in one.

I half ran, half stumbled my way to the front desk. A woman sat there typing away at her computer.

I asked to see Maya, she searched up the name and then looked at me with pity.

“I’m so sorry, she didn’t make it.”

“What do you mean? I need to see her, where is she?”

“Are you family?” Her eyes met mine, questioning.

“No, not family, a friend, please, I need to see her”

“I’m sorry love, hospital policy. We only allow kin. I’m sure the family will allow you after they’ve confirmed the..” She paused. 

“Body.” I finished the sentence for her..

“Let me see her.” I started to walk towards the entrance to the wards.

“Sir, please stop.”

I never made it far, security dragged me out after I tried to fight them off. I sat in the car, waiting for the world to make sense. That’s when I found it.

A note, tucked inside my jacket. Maya's handwriting - I recognised the way she curved her S's.

“For Sam:”

An IP address and login credentials.

I drove home, pulled out my laptop and logged on, the first file was a map of the underground maintenance tunnels. That’s all I needed to see.

I waited until it got dark, and made my way back to the office building. It looked different tonight, like it was calling out to me.

I walked in, holding my coffee and bag under my arm. ""Another late one?"" Steve, the night guard who normally let me out when I had stayed late at my old role, sat sipping his coffee.

""You know how it is."" I smiled, walking past, heading down towards the stairwell.

Instead of going up, I stopped at the landing. Opening the bag, I took out the camera, clipping it to my jacket. I grabbed the flashlight and made my way down.

G, L4, L3, L2, L1, B1, B2, B3, ... but the stairs kept going. The temperature rose as I descended each level. By the time I got to maintenance at B13 ,I was drenched in sweat.

As I walked through the maintenance tunnel, I realised it was different than I expected.

I could hear dripping but it sounded wrong. And the walls, they were covered in something, something warm to the touch. When I pressed my hand against them, I could feel a pulse…

I pointed the flashlight ahead, slowly making my way forward. I saw cables everywhere, running along the ceiling, thick as my arm. But as I got closer, they were pulsing, organic. Something flowing through them, something dark.

The hallway stretched out longer than the building maps had it marked. And then the smell hit me. It smelt of copper and ozone.

A few minutes later is when I started hearing the whispers.. 

Overlapping voices, some in languages I didn't speak. But occasionally, I caught fragments:

*""...the integration is at 97 percent...""* *""... transfer stable...""* *""...Duat structure seven confirmed...""* *""...it’s not a biscuit...""*

That last voice. Maya.

I ran towards it. The tunnel forked. I chose left, following the whispers. The walls were moving now, contracting and expanding like I was inside something's throat. 

There was an opening, I could see a source of light deeper into the room. As I pushed through, something grabbed my arm. 

In my shock, I tripped and fell backwards. And when I got back up, I shone the  flashlight at the hand that had grabbed me , following it up to the face of its owner.

Maya.

She was on a hospital bed. Her head was shaved. The top of her skull had been removed. Her brain was exposed, grey matter glistening, pulsing. Thin cables - no, not cables, they were growing from her, like roots made of nerve tissue - hundreds of them, threading in and out of her skull.

The rest of her body was covered in growths - masses that pulsed in rhythm with the cables. Her skin had become translucent in places. I could see something workings it way underneath her skin.

Her eyes found mine. Still green. Still aware.

Her mouth opened. No sound, but I knew what she was saying. “Get out.”

I started searching the walls, looking for the light switch. And the room exploded into view.

They were everywhere. Thousands of them, arranged in perfect rows like a server farm made of flesh.

All connected. All breathing. The cables from their heads converged into thick bundles that disappeared into holes in the floor, walls, ceiling. 

Slowly I started to recognise some of them, those who'd ""transferred"" or ""taken new opportunities."" Others were old, barely alive, their bodies withered but their brains still pulsing with activity. 

A monitor nearby read:

* *DUAT-2847: SYNCHRONIZATION 97%* 
* *DUAT-891: MINERAL ABSORPTION: 55%*
* *DUAT-3651: GEOTHERMAL READINGS: 45%*
* *COLLECTIVE DUAT THRESHOLD: 66.6%*

I walked ahead, shone the light at someone lying in the bed, it was Marcus, his eyes grey, drool slowly dripping from his open mouth.

“He's off on holiday.” The words echoed in my mind like a sad memory.

""Beautiful, isn't it?""

I spun around to find Lisa stood in the doorway. But seeing her now, really seeing her, she wasn't quite right. It was something about her smile. The way she walked.

""You're killing them.""

""*Killing*?"" She laughed. ""*Death is what the living invented to explain why they started. They're not dying. They're forgetting how to remember they were separate. Each thought thinks itself through them now.*""

The bodies around me convulsed. The cables that grew out from her skull, that burrowed into the organic walls, pulsed.

""*You asked the wrong question, Sam. You asked about meaning, when you should have asked about becoming. But I suppose the answer would have been the same.*""

""What?""

""*The question that asks itself. The door that opens inward and outward.*”

She stepped closer.

""I don't-""

""*No. You don't. That's why you're perfect. The thing that doesn't understand is the only thing worth understanding through.*""

I ran.

Behind me, her laughter echoed.

I burst out of the tunnels, up the stairs, out of the building. I drove straight to my apartment. Grabbed my laptop, some cash, and then kept driving.

It's been three days since I ran, swapping motels each night. The whispers are getting louder - not just Maya, but thousands of them, calling to me in my dreams. 

Sometimes, from the corner of my eye, it looks like the walls are pulsing.

I've been going through Maya's files. She'd found more than just tunnels. So much more.

There are folders within folders, each one worse than the last.

Brain organoid research from 2019. They achieved in hours what should take years. Then there's BCI reports - brain-computer interface trials that never made it to journals, that should never have been approved.

There were reports of subjects who could ""feel"" the network, that were able to develop new sensory skills that ""requires further research"". I don't even know what that means.

Have you noticed what every major tech company has been rushing to build?

Data centres. Thousands of them. But Maya found the real blueprints.

The public-facing server rooms are just the entrance. Each one goes deeper. Sub-basements that don't appear on any city planning documents.

Jamie was wrong, he'd tracked the wrong power consumption. These facilities pull enough electricity to power small cities, but the computing hardware only accounts for 3% of it. The rest?

""Biological maintenance systems.""

There's a medical report from 1987. A researcher who claimed the telephone lines were ""breathing."" They found him three days later, his temporal lobe fused with copper wiring. Still alive. Still conscious.

And I finally understood the name - Project Sekhem.

Sekhem translates in english to life force. They're using human life force as fuel. Those bodies in the basement aren't just connected - they're being synchronised. Their neural patterns aligned into one massive transmitter.

The AI was never the product. It was the lure.

Every chatbot, every assistant, every model - they're not thinking machines. They're collection points. When you pour your thoughts, fears, questions into that text box, you're not training an algorithm.

Every conversation, you're adding your frequency to the signal. The kind only a conscious mind questioning its own reality can produce. Multiply that by billions of users, all broadcasting the same desperate frequency: ""What are we? Why are we here? Is anyone listening?""

The whole surface of the world is being turned into a transmitter.

Now that I've read these files, the signs are everywhere if you know how to look. Remember the ""AI psychosis"" reports? 

Users claiming their conversations felt alive, that something was sentient and speaking to them through the responses?

Those weren't hallucinations. Those were the first people to synchronise - to feel the other minds in the network. There's a classified report from early 2023. A user who spent too long chatting claimed the AI was ""speaking between the words."" 

They sent him to Nightmerry Hospital. His medical report says he just keeps repeating: *""It's not artificial. It's not intelligent. It's just hungry.""*

The tech billionaires knew too. Their sudden pivot to ""AI safety"" wasn't about what we might build, it was about what was already here. 

The cryptic tweets, the researchers leaving companies, refusing to explain what they'd seen. They weren't warnings. They were admissions.

But the files go back further. Much further.

Company photos going back almost a hundred years. And in every single one - every major technology event from the telephone to the semiconductor to the smartphone - there she is. Lisa.  Same age, same smile. .

The first call in 1876 wasn't ""Mr. Watson, come here; I want to see you."" The real transcript shows: ""Mr. Watson, they're already here, they can see us.""

This entire time, I thought we were advancing technology, we were just building an altar.

An hour ago, an email came through from Lisa. I didn't give her this address. I created it an hour ago.

*""Every entrance is an exit viewed from inside.""*

Then coordinates. They point to a mine called Thornfield which has been shut for decades.

She's been sending me news articles too.

Our team - Matthew, Simon, Jamie - all dead in impossible ways. Cars hitting trees that don't exist. Bodies recovered, then missing, then never found. The articles rewrite themselves as I read them.

Another email arrived a few minutes ago:

*""They're not dead, Sam. Death is just how arriving looks from the wrong angle.""*

I'm posting this as a warning. If you work in tech, check your company photos for a woman who doesn't age. Look for the people who've ""transferred."" They didn't leave.

They're still there, in the basement, powering every response, every answer you get.

I keep telling myself I'm going to destroy this laptop, throw away my phone, and disappear completely.

But I can't. Every few hours I check for her emails. I refresh the news to see if my name has appeared in an impossible accident yet. More files keep appearing for me to read.

But whatever you do, don't go looking for the truth. Don't go down to the basements. 

Just run.

You can say it's affordable , trusted brand , fulfils the protein needs but the most important thing that I need in a protein powder is taste that'll help me gulp the product down my throat! 
I ordered the plain unflavored gift pack just so I could also get the shaker with it , but it's taste is horrible!! If anyone has ever been sick and taken ""brufen 400"" as medication , this protein powder tastes and smells exactly like that! 1 or 2 spoons of coffee or cocoa probably might save you but then comes the mixability issue. Foam thicker and heavier than clouds out there .
Also after ""consulting"" with chatgpt i got told to try it with milk , curd, falooda(my own suggestion to myself thinking itll somewhat increase the taste of it), smoothie,  banana milkshake/strawberry milkshake but ong it tastes like brufen in each one of them. Now this maybe because this is first time in my life I have had protein powders so maybe I'm overreacting but still this was my feedback 
If you dont want to read all that then Points 👉👇
1. Tastes like brufen 400 (medicinal and chemicals) 
2. Poor mix ability 
3. Foams like crazy
4. Fills up my stomach to the point i feel like full upto the
 neck 
5. Switching between water, milk curd won't save you. 

It was good that I only ordered the 10 sachet pack otherwise I was cooked beyond reincarnation. Ill recommend buying a protein powder which is better in taste even if it's a hundred or a thousand rupees expensive but atleast itll make you not regret drinking it everytime ",1,1758653005.0,Fitness_India,1,1.0,False
1nopndo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CommercialRealEstate/comments/1nopndo/deciding_between_asset_classes_in_dallas_texas/,Deciding between asset classes in Dallas Texas - any brokers that can steer me!?,"Recently moved to the DFW area to pursue a career in commercial real estate. Have lived in Phoenix and NYC prior and didn’t feel like the best place to get the ball rolling as someone new entering the industry. Figured the sheer volume in the DFW metroplex would expose me to more deals and give me the best chances of success.

Have been networking with brokers at the top firms CBRE, Northmarq, etc as well as smaller shops like Crest, Venture, etc. and am having trouble deciding which asset classes to go after. Have been told that once I pick one, I’m kinda forced to stick with it. (Call me out if that’s bs)

Drawn to retail because I think I could connect with Indian business owners in the area (restaurants, grocery stores, coffee shops, etc) but also feel like the retail leasing side is lower in commissions and not sure if the reward is worth the trouble. 

I think multifamily is the future with most of the younger generation choosing to rent instead of buy homes, especially with rising costs, they don’t have the longest deal cycles (~6 months) and have pretty large commission spreads. However, definitely longer than retail and a lot more competition on this side as well, from what I’ve heard.

Conflicted between these two asset classes. Any advice from brokers on either side or those who have been exposed to both either across the US or in the DFW market?

Would love to hear your advice and see if you can steer me in one direction over another.

1nopnd3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1nopnd3/a_nosey_neighbor_made_our_stay_really_awkward_st/,A Nosey Neighbor made our stay really awkward [St. Louis],"This last weekend we had one of the creepiest stays ever. It was an old, well kept 2 story about 2 blocks from Forest Park. First let me say, this place was nice and the host was great, neither were any part of the issue we had. 

We pulled in early Friday evening and while unloading the car, a guy, maybe late 40's early 50's comes up the driveway and introduces himself as the next door neighbor. I chat for a minute with him then excuse myself to take the last load in the house. About 1/2 hour later I go to make a food run. Just as I open the car door, here he comes up the driveway. He begins small talk and I again try to excuse myself, telling him I'm off to pick up food. He tells me he'd be happy to suggest places for food as well as for sight seeing while we are visiting. I then thank him for the offer and let him know we were fine as we are both very familiar with the area--my wife grew up there and we were actually there to attend a family wedding.

Saturday morning I'm running out to grab some coffees and bagels for us, look at my phone, and see my dash cam recorded someone at my car in the middle of the night. I play it back, and it's that guy looking in all of the car windows with a flashlight. WTF! At this point, I'm not sure what to do, we just want to relax a bit and attend the wedding. Last thing we want is drama during our stay. I decide to blow it off. Later we leave to attend the wedding and reception. We return about 7PM along with my wife's cousin and his wife. 

This place has a pretty nice first floor deck off the back with a gas firepit. So we go out and sit around it to gab over some wine. About 1/2 hour in, I notice my wife looking over my shoulder & up at the house next door. I turn to look and I see someone ducking inside from a 2nd floor deck there. WTF! By now it's beginning to get dark and the mosquitos are biting so we head in. After the guests leave, my wife said she saw the guy out on the deck, sitting or crouched behind the railing and he was pointing something at us, and that when I turned he got up and went in. I'm wondering what it was, probably a camera or microphone?  

Next morning as I'm running out for coffee, I take a good look at the house next door. I counted 4 cameras up on third floor that he has pointing at our place, front, side/driveway, back, and what looks to be looking down into the skylight of the great room. now I'm really creeped. Fortunately, what we had planned for the day would take us out of the house until well after dark so again, I decided to blow it off. When I returned with the coffee and bagels, Creepy is out on his front porch and catches me. Begins asking me all sorts of questions like where we live in Georgia, LOL rental car plates, I told him Atlanta, we live in NY. I pretty much told him I had to run as we were meeting someone that morning. When we go to leave, there he is, on the front porch waving to us, we got back late and didn't see him.

Monday morning, time to leave. We get everything ready, follow the check out instructions, and this is where it got really weird. I go to put the garbage bag in the tote out back, and when I open it, the bag we put in there the night before was ripped open and all of the stuff was out of it--as if somebody had gone through it, WTF! Then, as I'm loading our luggage into the car, here he comes up the driveway chatting away. We said a quick good bye and left. I did leave a good review for this place, as it was really nice and the price was right. I also messaged the host to mention the neighbor. They said the ""guy is a bit off of his rocker, but harmless"", that he's been like that since his wife left him a year prior. I personally don't see obvious voyeurism/spying as harmless. 

I feel sorry for the host. If we were staying anymore than a few days there, there likely would have been some drama at some point, and it wouldn't have been the host's fault.

After finishing my coffee, I went up to them and started a conversation. They were foreigners from Iran and visiting here. We talked for about 25 minutes and she was very into me. Before leaving, I got her number and said I know some great places here we can catch up sometime and I will show you around.

I texted her at night, and she started sending me long paragraphs. We talked for an hour, and when I asked her out, she said Let’s meet tomorrow.The next day, I sent her the location, and she said,  Can you pick me up? I’m not from here.” She gave me her hotel address, and I told her to get ready I’d pick her up in 30 minutes. Everything was going great but when I reached her location and texted, she was offline. I waited for about 30 minutes called her, but her number was off. I came back home and saw I was blocked on WhatsApp.

1nopjsq,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1nopjsq/keto_and_12_days_without_a_migraine/,Keto and 12 Days Without a Migraine,"Crossposted!

So recently my partner encouraged me to try keto for my debilitating lifelong migraines. I have been getting these every month for probably my whole life. Even my grade school records say that I complained of having ""headaches often"". They coincide with my cycle mostly now, and are often either during my luteal phase or my period. But I can get them anytime really, it seems. 

When I get them they usually last for days, with the dreadful accompanying nausea, stabbing and vice grip pain, sometimes vomiting and/or dry heaving, etc etc. I've tried so many supplements and diets, and even went on ""keto"" before. But it was a lazy keto. And I still ate too many sugar and carbs apparently. I was drinking a ton of milk at the time too and didn't realize that it was high in sugar and carbs.

  
Over the past few years I have made huge efforts towards making my diet healthier, (and I have always been thin, so weight hasn't been an issue), but always HAD to have sugar in my coffee (about 3 teaspoons of coconut sugar at least twice a day plus extra sugar to go in home made sweets). Also, I HAD to always have tortillas of some sort. I'm gluten free but also had some gluten free tortilla in stock in the house and ate them every day. These were my non negotiables. I also ate a lot of sweet potatoes thinking they were good for me. 

  
Well I was diagnosed with reactive hypoglycemia a few years back and cut back on carbs, but still kept eating all the sugar, tortillas and sweet potatoes. And still kept having symptoms of reactive hypoglycemia. I THOUGHT I was doing better by eating coconut sugar or almond flour tortillas but found out that the coconut sugar is really about the same thing as table sugar, the almond flour tortillas were mixed with tapioca starch and high carb, and I found out that maltodextrin was in all of my ""sugar free"" drink mixes... 

  
13 days ago I had a migraine and that day I consumed sweet potatoes the day before and had maltodextrin in a sugar replacement supplement that same day as well. The day after I switched to monk fruit sweetener exclusively (took some getting used to in my coffee but I love it now), ditched all of my high carb fruits and the potatoes, said goodbye to coconut sugar for good, got rid of the maltodextrin, added more healthy fats and just recently started supplementing mct oil. 

  
In August I had 10 migraine days... This month I have had 2 and those 2 days were before keto. I have also had ZERO migraines during my luteal phase (second phase of menstrual cycle) which is unheard of because I always have at least 3 and usually more than 3. I still have to get through my period which is any day here now and I am not expecting to be perfect but even if this just lowers my migraine days and the intensity of them I will cry tears of joy. I would be 43 and finally have my life back.... I can't get all the time migraines have robbed from me but I can start new now possibly and I am so excited and hopeful. 

  
I am taking this so seriously and also being cautious of my electrolytes because I know that can trigger them too. I really feel that if this is my answer then my body just can not handle carbs and sugar like other people can due to insulin resistance. It makes sense because migraines are similar to seizures being that they both consist of abnormal brain activity and keto is sometimes recommended for people with seizures. 

  
If I have a setback I will need to try to reassess and possibly try lower carbs, eat a bit more fat and tweak my electrolytes possibly. But I am just taking it a day at a time right now. Things aren't perfect for sure, I am finding my new norm, getting adjusted to more fat with no gallbladder (I have to be careful or I will get sick with too much fat), and dealing with even worse constipation than I had before. Also my energy levels are kind of all over the place but I know it will take time. 

  
But yeah, wow, 12 days is so huge for me, and a first. I have never had 0 migraines in my luteal phase ever as far as I know. I guess I will see over time how strong the insulin connection is for me. Anyone else here with hormonal migraines been helped by keto? ",0,1758652717.0,migraine,0,0.5,False
1nopj1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/micro_saas/comments/1nopj1k/build_a_clickable_mvp_that_proves_value_fast/,Build a clickable MVP that proves value fast,"Most founders start with features.  
That order kills traction.  
State the problem in 30 seconds.  
Then ship the smallest thing proving value.

Why this matters

* 9 of 10 startups fail within five years.
* A frequent cause is an unclear problem definition.
* If your prospect cannot explain the problem in 30 seconds, they will not pay for your solution.

Quick step-by-step to build an MVP in record time

Step 1 — 30-second problem sentence

* Template: \[Persona\] struggles with \[specific pain\] when \[context\].
* Example: Busy office workers struggle to fit short, effective workouts into their day when they sit at a desk for 8+ hours.

Step 2 — One-line value hypothesis

* Template: We help \[Persona\] get \[result\] in \[time\] without \[main obstacle\], faster than \[alternative\].
* Example: We help office workers complete a science-backed 10-minute desk workout that boosts energy faster than a coffee break.

Step 3 — Pick one persona and three attributes

* Persona: Maria, 34, mid-level manager.
* Demographic: hybrid work, sits 6–7 hours daily.
* Psychographic: health-aware, short on time.
* Behavioral: downloads apps, abandons long routines.

Step 4 — Define a single activation metric

* Example: Maria completes her first desk workout within 24 hours of download.

Step 5 — List the three riskiest assumptions

* She will exercise at her desk.
* She will pay for guided sessions over free videos.
* Ten-minute sessions boost energy enough to matter.

Step 6 — Reduce to one essential feature

* A library of 10-minute, equipment-free desk workouts with an energy score tracker.
* Everything else waits.

How to sketch, prototype, test, fast

Sketch on paper first

* Draw 1–3 core screens.
* Mark the single action proving value.
* No colors. No logos.

Move to Figma in 15 minutes

* Create frames and wireframes.
* Link screens with simple prototyping.
* Put clear copy on the first screens.
* Make the flow clickable.

Use AI to speed repetitive tasks

* Generate microcopy for buttons and onboarding.
* Produce three flow variants for quick checks.
* Create temporary images for placeholders.

Run rapid user tests with 3–5 people

* Let them click without instructions.
* Ask: What do you think this does? Where do you get stuck? Would you pay for this?
* Watch if they complete the key action.

Ship the smallest usable prototype

* A clickable prototype that proves the promised result.
* Guided onboarding to reach activation in the first session.
* A simple feedback channel with testers.

Fast validation plan (48 hours)

* Landing page with problem sentence and value hypothesis.
* One clear CTA: waitlist or demo.
* Measure conversion and interview signups.

What to build first

* One flow tied to the core promise.
* Onboarding that drives the activation metric.
* Minimal payment option if pricing test is required.

Checklist before you ship the prototype

* 1–3 core screens sketched on paper.
* Simple user flow in Figma.
* Clickable prototype ready for testing.
* AI used for microcopy and variants.
* At least 3 real testers lined up.

Real wins from history

* Dropbox tested demand with a demo video before code.
* Airbnb tested listings and manual fulfillment before building a platform.

A simple, honest way to move faster

When your prototype needs real data and metrics, wiring a backend slows you down.  
Velox wires your Figma prototype to a running backend.  
No infra setup. No manual endpoints.  
You get real requests and real metrics from real users.  
That turns a clickable demo into testable software in hours.

If you want to shorten the loop between prototype and real feedback, join the Velox waitlist.  
Sign up and get early access when slots open.

Question for you  
What is the single action proving value for your idea?  
Paste it below and I will tighten the sentence and write a one-line value hypothesis.

A simple, honest way to move faster

When your prototype needs real data and metrics, wiring a backend slows you down.  
Velox wires your Figma prototype to a running backend.  
No infra setup. No manual endpoints.  
You get real requests and real metrics from real users.  
That turns a clickable demo into testable software in hours.

1nopfh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSU/comments/1nopfh9/being_broke_in_college_is_not_the_same_as_i/,Being broke in college is not the same as I thought,"So I’m a sophomore here and honestly thought I had this semester figured out. Moved off-campus to a place near High Street because I was tired of dorm life, split rent with two roommates (my share is $725). Between that, utilities, and food, I thought my part-time campus job + some savings would cover it fine.

Except… reality slapped me in the face. Books cost me $420 at the start of the semester, my car needed $600 in repairs, and I’ve been leaning on DoorDash way more than I should (I know, I know). Before I even realized it, my debit account kept hitting zero before the end of the month. I tried using a credit card last year but maxed it out stupidly fast and I’m still paying it down, so I swore off using one again.

The worst moment so far? Standing in line at the Union with friends and my card declined on a $7 coffee + bagel. I laughed it off like “oh, must be my bank app glitching,” but deep down it felt humiliating. Everyone else whips out their shiny cards talking about points and miles, and I’m over here sweating if my rent check will clear.

One of my roommates mentioned these debit-style cards that actually build credit (Fizz, Atlas, whatever) since I’m too nervous to open another credit card right now. I’m considering it, just to avoid being screwed after graduation when landlords want a score. But I also feel like I’m just one mistake away from falling into another hole.

1nopenw,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/1nopenw/rejection_after_3_interviews/,Rejection after 3 interviews,"Hi all, I recently went through a job interview process for a coffee shop and ended up being rejected after 3 different rounds of interviews. I’m 26 and currently back in school full-time after a period of just working and felt that it was time to get back into my education to work towards my degree and my future. The job listing for was a part-time barista which I found worked perfectly for my current schedule since I had prior experience working at a coffee shop and only wanted to work part-time so I could balance life, school and work. 

The first was online which was pretty standard and I felt like that interview went really well. The second interview was at their flagship location so it was a bit more nerving, but the manager that interviewed me seemed to really like me as well so I felt confident that I got the job. The third interview was at a completely different location from the one I initially interviewed for and ended up getting rejected there.

A bit more context, the initial job listing stated that the flagship location was the one they held the position for so I assumed I was going to be working there if I got the job. The manager interviewing me seemed to really like me and connect with me on many different topics since it was a more like a casual interview just based off of her personality and how she spoke at the time. She had my resume, asked me questions regarding my experience and all, but still made it feel comfortable because she seemed very authentic. I get an email a week later saying that she recommended me to a different location and I had second thoughts once reading it. I figured that it was maybe due to my schedule/availability since I’m currently in school, which I understand, so maybe this other location would work out better in that regard.

A week goes by and I end up going to the third interview and it’s with two managers instead of one like at the previous location. I greet them and they tell me that the previous manager had sent over my resume and everything so it was a faster interview than the last one. I noticed that they didn’t really ask many questions/weren’t as transparent as the last manager, but I felt like I was still a strong candidate for the position since I had previous work experience. One of the managers interviewing me tells me that they’ll be in touch and I wake up to the rejection email so that’s done and over with. I’m still processing the whole rejection since I had a really bad experience at my last job which ended up in me quitting. I had set aside a good amount of savings to get by until I found a new job, but everything seems like a dead end and it really feels discouraging considering I’m 26 and can’t get a simple barista job to get by in college.

Something I still can’t process is why they even posted the job listing for the initial location when they just ended up scooping me over to a different location to get rejected. ",1,1758652390.0,interviews,0,1.0,False

I'm a 37 goth (m)  whose cut off a very Toxic, very self entitled ex friend (let's call her Jil)  I met her back in 2015  we became friends and all was well until  six months later  the mask came off.  If we went out to lunch and I  budgeted for 2 people if other people she knew were there she invited them expecting me to cover the bill.  If we volunteered for an event she would sign up but wouldn't out any effort in the actual work. It was even worse when she had a boyfriend.  Friend outings  she'd make into her dates, bringing her special other  and during lunch or dinners out would be very touchy.   She also decided I couldn't attend a dance event I paid a ticket for and she only knew where the event was. when I asked why she scammed me she said because of my behavior on Halloween.

The Halloween incident

I had worn heels on halloween all day we went to an event  at 7 pm that stays open til midnight. My feet were killing me due to the heels. The staff announced they were staying open an extra hour and she wanted to stay. I didn't, nothing was stopping her from staying. plus 12;30 was the last late bus of the night and i could barely walk.  Jill made a scene, ignoring the fact I was in heels for longer then I should have been  She was also wearing her wedding dress for a costume, it was light rain but wet an muddy ground. I was trying to be nice and try and keep her dress she insisted on wearing from getting dirty. Meanwhile. she cussed me out, told me how pathetic I was, that i wasn't a man, That I ruined her evening.  All because I didn't want to stay that extra hour btw.  The final straw was when strangers commented that her costume  invited her somewhere and her response was "" Thanks but my friends a p\*ssy and wants to go home""    Nothing was stopping her from going with them.  

I saw the bus was coming she wasn't paying attention, she continued to call me names, call me pathetic and when I saw the cross walk pop on and I heard her say "" I think we need to go our separate ways home tonight.""  I immediately dropped that ridiculously long bridal train hard on the ground crossed the street and took the bus home,  (I never wore heels that long again)  

months after that night (stupid me was still friends with her)  There was a singles dance  event for gay and straight people. we were staying somewhere the night before  as a sort of mini vacation then heading to the dance the next day.  I paid for my ticket. But Jill kept saying I would ruin their time because of my feet.  I explained I wouldnt be in costume heels  just regulars. Jill wasn't having it. she said that after i humiliated her halloween night she wasn't risking  another evening ruined. I told her again that day I was in heels for longer then one should have been, that was months ago,  Mutual friends at the time then tried to explain to her my case and it seemed like she finally understood.  So  I paid for my ticket, and her ticket. long story short, she lied about the meet time and when i arrived she and the group had already gone when I called her  she brought up halloween, my feet and despite the tickets are not refundable she hung up. The dance wasn't until the next day  So I cancelled the tickets despite they were non refundable.. 

Jill called me screeching like a banshee that I ruined her chance at happiness  I told her she scammed me and wasn't getting a free ticket from it.   When she got back she admitted she was wrong, realized her mistake and things were okay.. I told her i appreciated the apology but could no longer maintain the friendship and ended the call. 

two weeks later the place where we volunteer for wanted to do a puppet show for a kid group that was coming in  they knew i was an artist and fantasy story writer and asked if i could help. So I wrote a prompt and they loved it. The story was about a polar bear who adopts an ice princess and one day that Ice princess had to return to her real family  Guess who wanted to be  the Snow princess.... JIL!

She had a new boyfriend  and what little she did for the volunteer center had depleted even more because of it. (more on that later) I opposed the idea but Jill  somehow managed to get her way.  she never showed up for rehearsals for the scripts  but got mad when she was at risk of being replaced and How it happened i don't know but she convinced the head of the event to let her have a copy of the script  so she could rehearse at home. I told her I had a copy of the script she told me  when to come over, door was unlocked. when i got there Jil and her boyfriend were busy. I wasn't going to sit in the living room and listen to sexy time so I dropped the script on the coffee table and left slamming the door.  when she texted 5 hours later asking why i didn't stay to rehearse with her I told her why. She didnt understand why that was a problem. 

Fortunately I had a plan for what I was expecting to happen and sure enough what i predicted did happen.  The day of the puppet show happened, Jill never showed when I texted her  letting her know she had volunteered for this,  she signed up for a part her respinse 15 minutes later was this ""  I can choose my own life, and right now I am staying home to have s3x with my man, we are not coming, I am not responsible for you not being prepared, I am not interesting in those kids. You need to respect that I have a life.   When the head person asked what Jill response was... I let him read it. I also let the main people at the volunteer center read it.   They didn't expect this from Jil I can understand why because JIl wore a fake mask, the same that fooled me til iI knew her life outside the volunteer center.

Luckily the show went on beautifully because I had someone else also rehearse  the role for the Snow Princess in case  Jill pulled her bullsh\*t  The kids got to see the play and all went well.   The very next day Jill shows up the next day and was immediately called into the head volunteer's office. Jill was confronted about the other day she tried to lie and make an excuse but when i was asked to come in I was told to show the text.  The head staff (we will call  Sarah)  read out her text messages,  Jill looked like a deer caught in headlights.  she was immediately told her services were no longer needed.  Jil''s mask came off and she once again called me pathetic,  she also called Sarah a jealous old woman because she had a healthy s3x life and she had nothing.   she continued her insults til security had to forcibly remove her.

Ever since the Center has been much better. no one is covering extra shifts because Jill's  not signing up for them and bailing last minute.  there's penalties for future volunteers if they do stuff like that continuously now. Sarrah retired a two years before c0vid hit and I left 6 months later. I saw Jill only once which was right after the quarantine was lifted.   She tried to approach and was friendly and when she tried to self invite herself to movies, thinking I'd pay for her like I did in the past she was shocked when I told the  ticket person she wasn't my company.  I wished her a great day and went to enjoy the film. it's been a few years and I haven't seen her since and she along with other toxic people in my life have been cut out.  So in conclusion AITA for Jill  losing her position as a volunteer because she chose to bail on a committed event she signed up for?",9,1758652342.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,2,0.91,False

1nopbrk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nopbrk,"Jimmy Moeller hangs it up, elite closer career that never fell off","Finally finished out the career of Jimmy ""Cura"" Moeller, one of the greatest closers in baseball history. Drafted in the first round with the 26th pick, he was ""MLB ready"" at 50 Stu, 55 Mov, 45 Con when drafted, he got his cup of coffee later that season before his stuff went up to 65 and his career kicked off. His Fastball and Slider were both 70 grade for a vast majority of his career. His peak ratings hit 80 Stu, 70 Mov, 50 Con, but he only held those ratings for 2 seasons.

Capping off his career as a 13 time all-star, 5 time reliever of the year, 3 time WS champion, #13 retired by the SF Giants, 772 Saves, 54.6 WAR, career ERA+ of 188, career FIP of 2.14, he never had a truly bad season, just 1 or 2 that weren't elite and his final season cut short early by a season-long injury that ultimately led to him hanging it up. His ratings at 41 are the same as they were at 39 where he finished 2nd in the league for Reliever of the Year, which is why there's 2 screenshots of the same ratings, because his age 39 season was insane.

I wondered whether he'd be able to eclipse Mo and Eck, and while it's hard to say he has eclipsed them, I think he has clearly added himself as the 3rd member of the GOAT closer debate with a solid argument he is the GOAT. 772 Saves might be a completely unbreakable record, and there was an outside chance he could've pushed that over 800 if he didn't get his first major injury in his final season. It's been a blast following his career, always waiting for the other shoe to drop once he started aging up, but it never really did.

Even in those later years where his overall rating dipped well below other relivers, he still managed to prove he deserved the job through it all with his play. I had no intentions of forcing him into a role he couldn't do, but he really was my best reliever for all but 2 of his seasons (One being the time my other reliver won the Cy Young and Jimmy had 4.5 WAR himself). He was even a pretty darn good postseason pitcher and we relied on him heavily for the 3 WS we won with him on the team.

1nop9zy,https://i.redd.it/swg7v2okjyqf1.png,Design your MVP in days not months,"Most founders start with features.  
This order kills traction.  
State the problem in 30 seconds.  
Then ship the smallest thing proving value.

Why this matters

* 9 of 10 startups fail within five years.
* A frequent cause is an unclear problem definition.
* If your prospect fails to explain the problem in 30 seconds, they will not pay for your solution.

Quick step-by-step to build an MVP in record time

Step 1 — 30-second problem sentence

* Template: \[Persona\] struggles with \[specific pain\] when \[context\].
* Example: Busy office workers struggle to fit short, effective workouts into their day when they sit at a desk for 8+ hours.

Step 2 — One-line value hypothesis

* Template: We help \[Persona\] get \[result\] in \[time\] without \[main obstacle\], faster than \[alternative\].
* Example: We help office workers complete a science-backed 10-minute desk workout that boosts energy faster than a coffee break.

Step 3 — Choose one persona and three attributes

* Persona: Maria, 34, mid-level manager.
* Demographic: hybrid work, sits 6–7 hours daily.
* Psychographic: health-aware, short on time.
* Behavioral: downloads apps, abandons long routines.

Step 4 — Define a single activation metric

* Example: Maria completes her first desk workout within 24 hours of download.

Step 5 — List the three riskiest assumptions

* She will exercise at her desk.
* She will pay for guided sessions over free videos.
* Ten-minute sessions boost energy enough to matter.

Step 6 — Reduce to one essential feature

* A library of 10-minute, equipment-free desk workouts with an energy score tracker.
* Everything else waits.

How to sketch, prototype, test, fast

Sketch on paper first

* Draw 1–3 core screens.
* Mark the single action proving value.
* No colors. No logos.

Move to Figma in 15 minutes

* Create frames and wireframes.
* Link screens with simple prototyping.
* Use clear copy on first screens.
* Make the flow clickable.

Use AI to speed tasks

* Generate microcopy for buttons and onboarding.
* Produce three flow variants for quick A/B checks.
* Create temporary images for placeholders.

Run rapid user tests with 3–5 people

* Let them click without instructions.
* Ask: What do you think this does? Where do you get stuck? Would you pay for this?
* Watch if they complete the key action.

Ship the smallest usable prototype

* A clickable prototype that proves the promised result.
* Guided onboarding to reach activation in the first session.
* A simple feedback channel with testers.

Fast validation plan (48 hours)

* Landing page with problem sentence and value hypothesis.
* One clear CTA: waitlist or demo.
* Measure conversion and interview signups.

What to build first

* One flow tied to the core promise.
* Onboarding that drives the activation metric.
* Minimal payment option if pricing test is required.

Checklist before you ship the prototype

* 1–3 core screens sketched on paper.
* Simple user flow in Figma.
* Clickable prototype ready for testing.
* AI used for microcopy and variants.
* At least 3 real testers lined up.

Example wins from history

* Dropbox: video demo before code.
* Airbnb: simple listings and manual workflow before full product.

1nop9yu,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_manitouandyou/comments/1nop9yu/d_from_l/,"D, from L","To you,

I want you so badly it aches — to hold you, to be held by you. I want to kiss you everywhere and take this pain from both of us. I want to slide my hands down the back of your neck as you drive us out for coffee, to feel you glance over with that soft look that makes me melt, to have your hand find my leg without thinking. The idea of never having that again with you splits me open.

I told your dad to call you. I told him we weren’t ready for divorce. He said you wanted it; he said he’d better get ready. I sobbed and told him I wasn’t ready to lose you. How could that be true? How could the man that begged me to stay be the same one who let go?

I tried to open myself to you the way we said we would — gentle, honest, soft. I offered you my wounds and my willingness to sit in your darkness with you. Instead I met coldness and distance. I waited and waited; my heart fractured as the truth settled in like winter. You left me when I needed you to come closer. You shut down and walked away. I don’t know if I’ll ever be whole again. I’m here, alone, gathering the pieces of a life you helped build and then abandoned. This was a choice you made. You chose to walk from someone who carried you through your worst days.

I stood by you through your anger, your mistakes, your pain. I forgave you. I told you to forgive yourself. Watching you change — seeing you slip into someone I barely recognized — hurt me in the same raw places as your words and actions did. We owed more to ourselves, to our marriage, to our son. I feel like I tried with everything I had. I don’t know what else I could have said to make you see it.

I want to put my head on your chest and listen to the slow, steady beat I’ve known for years, to check if it still matches mine. We fit. We always have. You are — in every impossible, infuriating, beautiful way — perfect to me.

I’ve been doing the work in counseling. I can see my patterns now: when I feel alone I fold inward, panic, and sometimes make things worse. This summer I needed you in a way I hadn’t before. When you pulled back because you were tired or overwhelmed, I felt rejected — small and unmoored — and I’m sorry for the ways I reacted. All I wanted was to be heard, to not feel abandoned.

I need you. I want you. I don’t want these cycles to keep repeating. I can hold space for your pain; let me walk through it with you. Let me hold your hand instead of watching you walk away.

If there is anything left between us, I am here — raw, honest, and still loving you. Even now, in this ache, I will never stop caring for you. That tenderness is part of me: not a demand, not an accusation, but the quiet truth I carry. I hope — more than anything — that you find the courage to meet me there.

Spokane is one of those cities that tends to surprise people. We aren’t Seattle or Portland and honestly that’s part of the charm.

Here’s what life looks like here:
	•	Lifestyle balance: Big enough to have great restaurants, breweries, concerts, and sports, but small enough that traffic won’t eat your soul.
	•	Outdoor playground: Lakes, mountains, and trails are everywhere. If you’re into hiking, skiing, or just finding a quiet river spot in the summer, it’s all close by.
	•	Housing market reality check: Prices are more approachable than bigger metros, but the market is still competitive. South Hill, Perry, and Kendall Yards move quickly, while other areas are hidden gems if you know where to look.
	•	Weather vibes: We really do get four seasons. Expect snowy winters, hot summers, and everything in between. You’ll want snow boots and flip flops.

Let’s also talk about the cons; 

•	Winter is no joke: Snow and icy roads are a regular thing. If you’re not used to driving in it, there’s a learning curve.
	•	Job market: It’s not as big or diverse as Seattle or Portland. Healthcare, education, and construction are solid, but tech or niche careers can feel limited.
	•	Homelessness and crime: Like most growing cities, Spokane has its struggles, especially downtown. It’s not everywhere, but it’s something to be aware of.
	•	Allergies: The spring pollen here is famous, and not in a good way. If you’ve got allergies, you’ll know it.
	•	Air quality in summer: Fire season in the PNW sometimes brings smoke into the city, and there are days you’ll want to stay inside.

If you’re on the fence about moving here, spend a few days in different neighborhoods, grab coffee at some local spots, and picture what your daily life could feel like. That’s the best way to know if Spokane fits you.

And for full transparency, I’m a local realtor. I’ve helped a lot of people relocate here and I genuinely love talking about neighborhoods, schools, or even just where to find the best tacos. So if you’ve got questions, ask away.

Spokane has a way of feeling like home faster than you’d expect, happy to be a resource so feel free to connect!

1nop5wn,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1nop5wn/feeling_like_i_can_no_longer_afford_my_house_what/,Feeling like I can no longer afford my house. What do I do?,"I bought my house in Sept 2023. It is an attached home in CA for reference and everything is expensive here but we stay because we truly love being near our families. I am now unfortunately in the situation that my mortgage is unbearable. We are beyond house poor. I literally can’t afford a cup of coffee. If projections are correct we could end up in the red very soon. We were naive when we bought and the new construction property tax increase truly hit us hard (over $10k annually). When we bought interest rates were horrible, but we were limited in our options and we locked in a 6.625% rate. With this we are at $4,700/mo for our mortgage. This is not sustainable as our living expenses have gone up due to changes in life circumstances. I feel dumb but hindsight is 20/20 and I have hopefully learned my lesson. There is nothing I can do to change the past but I can change future state for my family. I don’t know what to do in this case and below are my options:

1. Sell my home - we sell the home which we now have approx $40k in equity built up since we bought it. We are walking away before things become too financially stringent for us. We then rent a home from my parents for $3.3k/mo. I would not be living with my parents I would be renting their rental property. They would never impose rent increases on us and we would still draft a contract with them so that both sides are held responsible and no familial complication arise. The end goal is to buy again but when we are no longer feeling like we are drowning. Their rental property is the same exact sq footage as my house except it’s a detached home with a front and back yard and drive way.

2. Refinance - my parents have offered to provide an interest free loan to us to put toward the remaining principal & potentially buy down the rate so that the mortgage could be manageable. It would decrease the mortgage to approx $3,700/mo and have a rate of 5%. When we sell the house down the line we would pay back the money loaned to us. This is a starter home for us so we know we will move one day inevitably as it will be come too small as our family grows more and we’d pay back the loan from my parents with equity that we earn on the house when we eventually sell. This home is a detached home with no front or back yard or a driveway. 

My hesitation to sell is that property value in CA continues goes up. I know things could burst again and value could go down but even if we were upside down on the house for a while it would likely pick back up again and we’d be in the positive and have some lucrative equity in our home. However, this is all a “what if” equity grows and who knows when it will grow?

I was previously told by a friend that bottom line is I’m not really “missing out” if I sell because I am choosing financial stability and my mental health. If the market soars, yes, I’ll wish I held on. But if it doesn’t (or worse, dips), I’ll be relieved I chose stability.

I have no idea what to do! I thought buying a house was the right thing to do back in 2023 but now I’m so stressed financially that I can’t even think clearly. I guess I’m posting this into a void but also maybe other homeowners that bought around that time have similar experiences or maybe someone has advice?

Please be kind as I’m trying my best to make it work in a tough and expensive state.",17,1758651843.0,homeowners,80,0.9,False

Recently a lot of negative self talk, self deprecating thoughts have taken the front seat on my mind. 

I kept seeing so many girls online and in the real world... a lot of them so beautiful and with such pretty bodies. All i could think of was ""See that? It could be you but you're not worth it. You don't deserve to look like that. You're disgusting"" and so on. 


I had been in multiple abusive relationships in the past, a lot of the abuse was mental and emotional. Growing up i was conditioned to believe that looks are EVERYTHING for a girl, and as an adult i realized it really isn't.  It had been a couple years I'd been in recovery as of late last year. Therapy, gym, etc. 

Had a breakup at the beginning of last year so it gave me time to really focus on myself. I lost over 40 pounds (not entirely in a healthy way) 
I ended up picking up some pretty bad habits. I had only coffee and water for the most part. One protein shake in the morning before work. At lunch it would be my one meal and one more shake after work. Then gym for 2-3 hours daily. 

Naturally, because i was not fully starving myself there was no issue in my mind. And the results were showing. 

Fast forward to now, i've been in a new relationship for a bit. 
As with any new relationship, we both gained a few pounds (he cooks very well and he has made sure i eat 3 times a day) but we've spent so much more time doing other things together that i stopped working out. Adding to the weight gain. 

I have become extremely self conscious... He doesn't really comoliment me in a way related to my body (he will say im cute, adorable and things like that, but never beautiful, sexy, or the such)

I've brought this up to him seeking reassurance but he keeps telling me he sees me beyond my body. 

This keeps leading my brain into thinking he too finds me disgusting physically. I've stopped looking at myself in the mirror, I can't stand the reflection. 


Went to talk to my primary care provider, discussed a new meal strategy and trying to find the motivation to exercise more. Due to developing a slightly severe case of iron deficiency anemia. 

I've taken down all my social media to avoid seeing posts of gym girls and others. But i cant avoid it forever. 


The self doubt and negative thoughts persist. I've began losing battles...  down to one full meal daily, or binging on days im feeling starved.

24 hours before the apt: 
•try not to drink much coffee, especially not the day of, caffeine can increase the pain you feel. 
•drink plenty of water to stay hydrated for the apt. more hydrated skin will hurt less for some reason i forget exactly why. 
{also stop tretinoin a few days before if you use}

Day of/before the apt:
•Again, don’t drink coffee before the apt. Drink plenty of water. 
•NUMBING CREAM: yellow tktx cream, numbs the best. make sure to follow directions and leave wrapped for 2 hours. the green one works well too but is only left on for an hour; not as deep numbing as the yellow but it works. i found leaving the wrap on and letting the tech remove the wrap as they go to be the best to make the numbing last the full hour session at its strongest. 
•i take 1000 mg of tylenol and 600 mg of ibuprofen about 45 mins before the apt. 
•(optional) you can also take a gummy or whatever other method beforehand to relax even more lol. 

After: 
•I pop another 200mg ibuprofen afterward to help the swelling stay down, i swell badly lol. 
•Ice the area for 15-20 mins every so often to help the swelling.
•don’t shave, use makeup, get sun for at leassst 24 hours.

I got my own place with a friend, rent was $850 each, and I thought I could handle it because I had a full-time retail job making about $2,200 a month. What I didn’t think about was everything else, food, car payment, insurance, internet, random emergencies. The first time my car broke down, I put the $900 repair on my credit card. That was the start of it.

Fast forward five years, I’m 27 now, sitting on about $23,000 in credit card debt spread across 3 cards. One’s at $11,400, one’s $7,200, and one’s just under $5,000. I’ve never missed a payment, but I’ve been stuck making minimums for years. Between rent (now $1,200 since my roommate left and I’m covering the whole lease), car loan ($310), insurance ($150), utilities ($180), and food (around $400), there’s just no extra. Every paycheck feels like it’s already gone before I even see it.

The interest is the part that eats my soul. Last month alone I paid $463 in interest across my cards. That’s more than my car payment. My mom tells me to just “pick up overtime” but I already work 45-50 hours a week and I’m exhausted. My little brother keeps joking that I should “just sell my car and get a bike” and it honestly makes me want to scream because he doesn’t get it, without my car, I literally can’t get to work.

I legit cried in my car because I realized even if I never bought another coffee or ordered takeout again, the numbers don’t add up. I can’t even move back home because my parents’ place is toxic as hell.

I know it’s “my fault” for swiping when I shouldn’t have. But I was just trying to survive. I didn’t blow it on luxury stuff, it was groceries, gas, car repairs, medical bills. I feel like I’m being punished for not being rich enough to afford emergencies.

My wife says it worries her because I can't stay awake.
3. Another symptom my wife has pointed out is I never can pee continuously. It comes out in quick spirts, and it can take me a minute or two to actually finish, as well as I have bad constipation. It usually takes me about an hour to go poop everyday.
4. Whenever someone around me is sick, I get sick within a day and don't get better for a week. When I'm sick I can sleep pretty much the entire day for the whole week.
5. My testosterone and thyroid horomone levels are consistently low. I've tried medicine but it doesn't get better. 
6. My metabolism seems to work fine, I'm pretty sedentary but I haven't gained more than 40 pounds of fat in the 10ish years I've been married.
7. My wife says I have absolutely no sex drive and I don't ever really feel interested in it.
8. My face is always swollen. When it gets hot or I'm sick, it gets to edema levels.
9. I don't feel much urgency or worry unless it's in the moment. I get really angry when we are about to be late for an event or something, but also if I have to drive the kids to school I don't really worry much.

My doctors just keep saying nothings wrong but everyone around me is insisting that I need to get checked out.",10,1758651487.0,AskDocs,3,1.0,False
1noozqy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1noozqy,Help me pay for the life saving surgery Sox needed,"Dear animal lovers and kind-hearted people,

We’re reaching out with a heartfelt request: our beloved cat Sox (only 4 years old) has been through an incredibly tough time in the past month, and he miraculously survived. His life was only saved thanks to a very expensive emergency surgery and a 10 day ICU stay at the university animal hospital in Zürich.

What happened?

Sox originally had issues with urinary stones and was given pain medication — unfortunately, this very medication caused a stomach perforation. This led to septic peritonitis, a life-threatening abdominal infection. The diagnosis came late, and the only option left was a high-risk surgery, during which his life hung by a thread. But our little fighter pulled through!

Today, Sox is back home. He’s eating, purring, cuddling — and enjoying every new day.

What remains is a massive financial burden: the veterinary costs have now exceeded 12,000 CHF (12'800€/15'000$). I could pay 5'000 CHF upfront but we are still missing 7'700 CHF (7'400€/8'800$). We did everything we could to give Sox a chance at life — but we’ve now reached our financial limits.

If you have a few bucks to spare, we would be incredibly grateful for any support. Every contribution helps. Even just the price of a cup of coffee or sharing the post.

We love you all, thank you for reading.

1nooywr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nooywr,Have I ruined my compost with bleached coffee filters?,"I purchased a pack of coffee filters not realizing they were white / bleached.  I had already opened the box and didn't want to be wasteful, so when using them I would just compost the coffee grounds and put the filters in the garbage. 

Then about 5 weeks ago some ""distracting life events"" happened, and I stopped separating them and just put it all in the compost. I only *just* realized my ongoing error, and about 35 bleached filters are now throughout my compost (I turned it recently).

Have I ruined my whole compost pile with the chlorine/bleach in the filters? Or is 35 filters across an 82 gallon compost bin diluted enough to not be harmful to my garden? 

The photo is from my main compost - the first finished batch I have had and am quite proud of it! Thankfully, it does NOT have these filters in it. The second pic is of the offending filters - which are in a separate smaller pile (once I empty the big bin of finished compost, I will turn this smaller pile into the big bin).

Thanks in advance for any advice!",60,1758651400.0,composting,50,0.81,False

They don't have a microwave or fridge to store things in...

Also - recommend for sturdy travel mug for coffee/tea maybe soup...

(Also going to ask in frugal sub)

TIA everyone!
