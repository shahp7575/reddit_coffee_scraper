I once had an interview to work at this Arabian horse stable. It was weird from the start. I was invited inside a trailer by a little old lady in probably the most cat-ridden house I've ever seen. Now I don't mind animal hair, but it was CAKED everywhere. I kindly pretended to drink the coffee she made me (featuring cat hair).


The wild thing is that this woman was a champion rider and breeder back in the 80s-00s. She still maintained over a dozen of the prettiest Arabians I've ever seen, still breeding occasionally but almost never selling. Her husband was a very well known attorney,  but you wouldn't have guessed it by the state of the property.


That wasn't the bad part. The barn was stunning and genuinely the most meticulously maintained stable I've ever seen. And...oddly free of flies for a rural property in the peak of Sacramento summer. She explained that she HATED flies. She installed a whole system that periodically sprayed fly repellent throughout the stalls and the entire barn. 


What was her fly spray you ask? It was raid. Straight raid. She had CASES of raid. She instructed that whenever I were to see a fly on a horse, I must promptly spray it with a  can of raid. Directly on the horse.

[SIL and EB's MIL indignant over baby shower gift](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/s/Nmv9pGtvHm)  **Feb 15, 2019**

So you thought I'd run out of stories about entitled brother (EB) and sister in law (SIL)? Oh, how wrong you were. This one also involves SIL's mother (MIL) and lemme tell you, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. 

This happened just before my first nephew was born. Nephew is not EB's (not that this matters but it does lend a bit of relevance since SIL essentially roped EB into being a baby daddy when she was 17 and desperate to find someone to support her). 

I was sent an invitation to SIL's baby shower, organized by herself. Maybe I'm a bit old fashioned, but I was brought up with the notion that it was in poor taste for the expectant parents to throw their own showers, but perhaps times have changed since then. 

Anyway, I read on the invitation that it was a Winnie the Pooh theme. I was a student working PT at minimum wage, and Winnie the Pooh (or anything Disney themed at the time) was way out of my price range. I definitely didn't want to go empty-handed, so I checked my bank account and went shopping. The only thing I could find in my price range was a Tiny Toons themed onesie and a couple of receiving blankets. I figured that they would be of the mindset that it was the thought that counts and they were super strapped for cash, so some useful items despite the lack of the desired theme would be appreciated. 

Hell no, I couldn't have been more wrong. 

When the time came to open gifts, I excitedly gave her mine and I waited with bated breath. The look of disappointment and then disgust took the wind out of my sails. 

SIL: Umm, the theme was *Winnie the Pooh*, NOT Tiny Toons. It was right on the invitation. 

MIL then snatches the onesie and scoffs, ""This isn't even worth $10!"" She even went so far as to toss the receiving blankets into the pile of wrapping paper and muttered, ""How could someone be so cheap?"" 

I was floored. And hurt. I could barely stammer out, ""I'm sorry, but I couldn't afford --"" and she cut me off. 

MIL: If you couldn't afford a decent gift, why did you even bother coming? 

Side note: SIL and I are very close in age, so I was 17 and very timid at this time. Glad to see I've changed since then. In spades. 

I looked around the room and it was if everyone was frozen in place, teacups hovering and sandwiches in mid-bite. I was so humiliated and thought everyone was in shock at the shitty gift I had given that it never occurred to me that they were actually shocked at SIL's and MIL's appalling behaviour. Even EB looked uncomfortable. 

I burst into tears, gathered my shit and promptly left for home. There was nothing else I could do; I had spent my last $20 on the gifts, wrapping paper and card, and I didn't even have money to go to a restaurant to get myself a cup of coffee and wallow, so I went straight home. Mom and Dad weren't home (they were on a well deserved vacation) so I just curled up with a book and tried to distract myself from the events of that afternoon. 

In the end, EB did feel a little bad, even though he didn't stand up for me. He called me and told me the shower pretty much ended right after I left. He did express a smidge of an apology for SIL's and MIL's behaviour, which was quickly quashed when he added that the shower ended early due to my outburst. Gee, thanks. I go out of my way to find a thoughtful (and affordable) gift and have it thrown in my face, along with insults, and somehow it's MY fault everyone decided to leave early? Fuck you and the camel. 

I told my folks what had happened after they got back from vacation. At least Mom expressed her relief at being out of town for the event because she had zero interest in going. 

TLDR: spent the last bit of available cash on SIL's baby shower gift, SIL and MIL felt it wasn't good enough and threw the gift back in my face because it wasn't expensive enough.

[SIL and EB's MIL show zero appreciation for nephew's birthday party](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/s/leMhgd0NNg)  **Feb 15, 2019**

I think Reddit may have created a monster in me.  Ever since I found this sub I've been dyyyyying to relay stories of my entitled brother (EB), his wife (SIL), HER mother (MIL) and their kids (K1 and K2).  The more I think back, the more crap I seem to dig out from my subconscious as I've been making a concerted effort over the years to repress a lot of it.  Every time I finish a story, my dear husband (DH) says, ""Oh, but what about...""  ""Don't you remember when he..."" so it's a neverending cycle of story after story.  But with the glory of the intarwebz, I now have an outlet to vent (and I thank you all for allowing me to do so - I love this sub).  The only drawback is the floodgates have now opened and sometimes I think I'm posting a bit much all at once and fear I'm spamming.  So if you think too much is too much, let me know and I'll put the muzzle on.

\-------------------

It was right before K1's sixth birthday, and EB and SIL wanted to throw him a birthday party - K1 voiced that he *really* wanted to go bowling, complete with hot dogs, cake, ice cream, presents, and all of his little friends in attendance so they can have a fun afternoon.  This sounded wholesome and fun; I remember my past birthday parties involving bowling and having a blast, so I happily obliged when EB called me to ask for a bit of help from me and DH (dear husband).  The only concern was that I was working that Saturday, but had arranged with a coworker to switch shifts so I could attend.  Thankfully co-worker is a father himself, and understood the need for me to take this particular Saturday off.

I knew EB and SIL were very badly struggling financially, and naturally they still wanted to show their little one a good time, with all of his friends.  To help ease the burden, DH (who also arranged for a day off from work) and I offered to bring a cake and supply the grab bags (mini bags usually full of dime store candy and small toys that are distributed upon the kids' departure from the party).  There were 10 kids confirmed, which meant that the bags alone and their contents would be between $50 and $70 in total if you included the cost of the bags and the cake ingredients.  Since store-bought cakes are often expensive (and taste like shit, especially if purchased from a grocery store chain, I opted to bake a chocolate scratch cake (per K1's wishes).  DH and I weren't rich by any means (this was several years before ""the inheritance"" came to be, and we were both still early in our careers with one of us taking PT classes at the same time) but we felt between us we could definitely aside a maximum of $100 toward this little shindig.  SIL jumped at the offer and gave us the details.

The night before the party I made the scratch cake and decorated it with sprinkles and colorful icing, complete with ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY K1"" scrawled on top in bright blue decorating gel.  It wasn't a Rembrandt or Picasso, but it looked pretty festive and nice and was tasty as hell, and most kids aren't terribly concerned with particulars about how fancy a cake looks, they just want to *eat* it and get that sugar rush.  Meanwhile, DH was filling the treat bags - ten bags containing a small assortment of candy, a toy whistle, and a 'clacker' toy.  We even made two extra ones in case there was an extra surprise kid or two, or if one of the kids had a little sibling at home and they didn't want to them to feel left out.  We were set.

The next afternoon DH and I carefully loaded the cake and grab bags into the car and made our way to the bowling alley close to EB and SIL's place (so roughly a 30 minute drive away).  EB and SIL were already there, as well as SIL's mother (MIL).  This alley hosts birthday parties on the regular, and they have a room set up in the back for such an occasion.  We carefully carried the cake and bags to the room, ensured the girl behind the counter started the hot dogs (they were cooked on rotating spokes in a glass display and took quite some time to heat up to a proper temp) and waited for the kids to arrive.  Within about half an hour of arriving, 10 kids showed up, along with some parents,  making it 12 kids if you included K1 and his brother K2, and about 6 adults.  Great turnout!

We herded the kids to the shoe counter where they all got their bowling shoes.  After helping them lace up, we hit the lanes.  All of the adults opted to sit back and watch, and two of the kids didn't bowl (one had a cast on his wrist and the other simply didn't want to bowl - I think he was just in it for the cake, lol), but they were amazingly well behaved and were content with just sitting on the bench, watching their friends chuck balls down the lanes.

After about an hour, we called the kids to the back room for hot dogs, cake and presents.  Thankfully, this went off without a hitch.  After everyone had their fill, bowling resumed.  Once the third game was done about another hour later, it was time for the kids to leave.  DH handed each kid their grab bag, which was welcomed with a huge ""THANK YOU, MISTER!"" and everyone was happy.

Or so I thought.

DH and I started gathering up the paper plates while EB returned the bowling shoes to the counter.  Then came the time to pay.  Thankfully, K1 and his brother were sitting at one of the tables playing with toys, away from the adults so they couldn't hear the ensuing conversation.

""All right,"" said the fellow behind the counter.  ""That's a bowling package for 12 kids at $6.00 each... I'll only charge you $3.00 for the two kids who didn't bowl, to cover their hot dog and pop … so that comes to $66.00, please.""

No one moved.  I looked at DH, DH looked at EB, EB looked at SIL, and SIL and her mother were both shooting daggers at me and DH.

MIL:  *Well??*

DH:  Well what?

MIL:  Aren't you going to pay the man?

Me:  For what?  We already made the cake and the grab bags!  You were expecting *us* to foot the bill *AGAIN* for something?

MIL:  Well, isn't that what you promised to do?  You said you were going to pay.

Me:  I said we would cover the cake and the gift bags for the kids!

MIL:  Well, *the cake* (voice dripping with contempt) was *homemade*.  You \*\*cheaped out\*\* on the cake, so you may as well put the extra toward the bowling.  Why are you trying to cheap out on this whole thing and go back on a promise and break a little boy's heart?

DH:  Like hell we will.  We did our part, you can take some responsibility for once (while pointing at the three of them).

SIL:  K1!  (calling out to the birthday boy)  Come here please!

K1:  (trots over)  Yeah?

SIL:  Auntie and Uncle don't want to pay for your birthday party.

K1:  (while hugging DH's legs) But Auntie and Uncle brought cake and presents!  I thought you and dad and gramma were taking us out.

It took every ounce of willpower to not burst out laughing.  EB's face turned beet red with embarrassment and SIL was visibly flustered.

Me:  Did you have a good time, K1?

K1:  YES!  IHADSOMUCHFUNBOWLINGANDPLAYINGANDBEINGWITHFRIENDSANDEATCINGCAKEAND ...

Me:  (laughing and giving him a big hug) Okay, okay.  Listen kiddo, we have to go, but you give us a call later tonight.  Happy birthday!

K1:  OKAY!  THANK YOU FOR THE CAKE!  (kids' priorities, lol)

And with that, DH and I turned on our heel and walked out, leaving the remaining adults to hash it out.  K1 called me later that evening and we briefly chatted, but he was winding down from his sugar rush so the call was short.  I never did end up finding out how EB, SIL and MIL handled everything afterward, but that was one of the few times I left him hanging and feeling really good about it.

Edit:  Because I can't math the number of kids who actually attended, lol

[Husband reminded me of an EB incident I had repressed](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/s/SoYu96pt5E)  **Feb 17, 2019**

This one kinda skates a fine line between belonging here or in jnfamily. If it doesn't belong here, I'll remove and post elsewhere. 

In one of my earlier (many) posts I've made mention of my entitled brother (EB) and sister in law (SIL) behaving badly at my house during my Mom's funeral tea. I recalled her walking around the house openly pointing out shit she wanted, but my dear husband (DH - fiance at the time of the incident) and I were reminiscing about this day last night after I told him about my posting these stories to Reddit and how helpful it (and all of you guys) have been. 

DH: SIL was just walking around pointing out what she wanted? 

Me: Yeah. I remember her walking around upstairs in the living room, commenting about how much she liked the painting over the mantel. And how they could use one of the sofas. And how K1 (nephew 1) would like the NES system, which was actually mine. 

DH: No, I meant, is that *all* you remember? 

Me: It was a pretty emotional day and it's been well over 20 years. 

DH: You don't remember what happened downstairs?

Me: I remember sitting with all my cousins downstairs while the aunts and uncles were upstairs having tea. But that's about all I can really recall. 

DH: Hon, I was downstairs with you and the cousins too, but you seriously don't remember SIL casually commenting to EB about how the house was 'all theirs now', and were both standing within two feet of me? 

Me: **blank stare**

DH: It was pretty obvious the cousins heard because all of a sudden you had [cousin 1] pinning your elbows behind your back, and [cousin 2] freaking out and begging you to calm down. You don't remember? 

Me: I remember being upset and the cousins trying to calm me down but I really don't recall why. 

DH: SIL and EB made a hasty retreat out of the room and I followed them to make sure they left right away. I knew you'd be fine with all (seven) of your cousins; I was scared what would have happened if EB and SIL decided to return to the rec room. 

Me: So that's why they left? People were asking where EB went and I had no answer for them. 

DH: Yeah, that's why he stayed for only half an hour. I didn't want to say anything to the aunts and uncles because you had been through enough that day. Besides, I'm pretty sure your cousins would have informed them later. I couldn't believe she had the audacity to say something so inappropriate, 1, at a funeral tea, 2, in front of so many people that were related to you and your Mom, and 3, *in front of you.* It was and still is none of her business. No wonder your family hates her so much. 

Maybe I should be glad I didn't remember everything from that day. Geeze, I had the chain of events of that day all wrong before. 

[The beginning of the end of entitled brother's gravy train](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/s/qfqxrq1pOd)  **Feb 18, 2019**

I know almost all of my stories took place years and years ago, so I don't know if such submissions would be considered relevant as they're not in present day. Please delete/remove if this is not appropriate here.

My entitled brother (EB) is usually the focal point of my rants, sometimes involving his wife (SIL). My brother was spoiled as hell, and while my parents *meant* well at the time, they didn't realize just how badly things would turn out for both EB and themselves. 

EB was set to graduate from a fairly prestigious university (on Dad's dime) and even though EB had proven himself to our parents to be utterly greedy, shameless, manipulative and selfish, they still indulged him. So yeah, I do acknowledge they played a huge part in his attitude, but their punishment was having to put up with his abuse.

He was living on campus during the school year and split his time between the family home and SIL's (then girlfriend) during the semesters he didn't have classes (usually limited to one per year, winter or spring, depending on his courseload). And during those semesters off he would work at a local retail shop for additional spending money, even though he wasn't expected to contribute any of it to living expenses or tuition. Lord knows why.

Upon graduating from uni with his BA, my parents were super proud, as they should, as he was the first one to graduate from post secondary. It was a reason to celebrate, and the parents had a myriad of graduation gifts for him - a new watch, a gold chain, cash, etc. Despite the magnitude of gifts he received, he approached Dad with the request of a car, citing the need to have a vehicle since there now was a baby (K1 or nephew 1) to look after. 

Dad was skeptical. He was nearing retirement and he had already used up both EB's *and* my RESPs (registered educational savings plan) to pay for EB's last year of uni. His heartstrings were being manipulated with the mere mention of K1, but he also knew that he couldn't plunder his and Mom's savings just because EB wanted a car. 

So after hemming and hawing, he made EB a deal. He would cosign a loan for said car, so long as it was limited to something sensible and affordable. Together they settled on a newer model secondhand Geo Metro (think of a gas powered sewing machine - the epitome of compact car) for $3k. The minimum payments came to a reasonable amount; if I recall correctly EB would have had to make a $50 payment twice monthly. The problem with this setup is that Dad would be taking all the risk while EB would get off scot free if he defaulted. Dad made it very clear to EB that he would have to be extremely diligent with making that minimum payment, or else it would be Dad's credit that would suffer. EB eagerly agreed, stating that he was going to get more hours at his retail job to maintain the payments. 

You know where this is going, don't you? 

Two months go by without incident, until one day I got a phone call for my Dad. It was the bank. Dad wasn't home so I asked if I could be of any help. They couldn't tell me anything really, except when I asked if it had anything to do with a loan. 

Side note - Mom and Dad dealt with one bank forever (Bank 1), and this loan was made through the bank EB dealt with (Bank 2). So when the bank rep said he was calling from Bank 2, it was pretty easy to discern for what reason they were calling. 

The rep kind of faltered. We lived in a very small town, where everyone knew everyone and their business. I got a sick feeling in my stomach and told them I'd get Dad to call them back or visit their branch the next possible moment. 

When Dad got home, I had no choice but to tell him. When he returned from the bank, he was madder than a wet hen. Apparently EB hadn't made a single car payment - not a one. The total amount outstanding wasn't huge, but the fact that he had welched on an agreement between he and Dad and put Dad's credit at risk, he was furious. 

Dad called EB with a fury I had never seen before. EB promised he would make the payments ASAP and we thought that was the end of it. 

Another three months go by, and Dad got yet another call, for the same reason. Dad again called EB and demanded he bring the car to the house since he couldn't be responsible enough. The plan at that point was to allow me to take over the payments and have full use of it. 

Here's the problem none of us were expecting. EB told Dad he didn't have the car anymore. When asked (more like demanded) why, he said it needed a $400 brake job and he couldn't afford it, so he sold it to some guy down the road from him for scrap, for $100. Because it was a private cash sale, there was no search for liens or anything and he just let it go. 

Words cannot express how pissed off Dad was. He demanded EB continue with the payments, but EB refused because he felt he shouldn't have to pay for a vehicle he didn't own. And because Dad was on the hook as he was the cosigner, he was ultimately responsible for that loan. 

Dad ended up paying for that car for the next year, and it was another nail in the coffin for EB. I think that was when EB was completely cut off financially, but it came too late. 

Outlined in another post (found in jnf): The last straw came when he abandoned me at a train station when I was on crutches and he refused to give me a ride home when he was in possession of our Dad's car, instead opting to go shopping with SIL to a mall that took him literally past our house. After both parents had their way with him, he moved out permanently a week later. 

It's been over 20 years since that happened and I'm still mad about it. 

Edit: spelling/grammar. I have the dumb. 

Disclaimer  this marks the end or close to the end of my ""entitled brother"" series, unless I'm able to go deeper into my subconscious. I hope you've enjoyed reading. And if even one person dealing with a shitty relative benefitted from these, then that's all that matters. ❤.

1) So, I wasn’t really aware of what each DLCs brings to the party, but I’ve noticed a few new things that were new, like helium and all the aviator stuff? Also there’s far too many new expeditions for other new Worlds (apart from the New World that I was already familiar with from the PS version). I was wondering if you can suggest which DLCs are good for new players like me, and which ones will be adding a lot of headaches to my gameplay. 

2) Some items, like beer, now display that they can be produced both in the Old World and the New, however, when I try to create a production chain of Beer in the New World, it’s all greyed out, not allowing me to build it (see picture).

3) It’s my first sandbox on the PC version, and not to brag, I’ve been very good, so far. Got past the Engineer Tier and managed to finally get spectacles production, on the New World I finally reached the next tier (Artistas), AND I’ve been in profit all the 29h that I’ve played so far. Again, not to brag, but I super proud and happy with all my efforts. Having said that, I must admit that the biggest struggle so far is the “in between worlds trades”, such as supplying rum/cotton/coffee to my Old World, and sewing machines supply to the New World. Because, regardless of my trade settings (i.e. wait for good to load/unload) there’s always a gap in both worlds whilst the trade routes are being sailed. Any advice on how to maintain a good supply? 

I have so many more questions, but these are the main ones feeding my anxiety. Thank you in advance! ",1,1748296574.0,anno1800,0,1.0,False

It was one of those streets with rows of street lights on both sides. One of the lights on the left side was broken and that area was dimly lit. As I approached it, I noticed something. Another light was broken 20 yards down the road on the right side of the street. And that area was also dimly lit. 

A dog barked from the house on the right as I passed by. And then - silence. Until another dog barked from the other side. And silence again. This time the silence was longer. It lasted until I arrived at my friend's house. Still silence. I rang the bell. Silence. I rang again. 

My friend opened the door. We greeted each other like people that haven't seen each other for two days greet each other. I asked for black coffee with sugar. He told me that he hopes he has some. 

He opened the cupboard and there it was. 3oz jar half filled with sugar. The other half of the jar was empty. I asked him when was the last time he filled that jar. Last Friday, he said. That reminded me of things that happened to me that day that I wanted to share. So I started:

- ""It was a rainy day. One of those rains that makes you think whether to open the umbrella or not. So I left my office contemplating whether I should open the umbrella and headed towards the bus station. 

It was one of those Fridays that mark the end of the work week so I was contemplating whether I should stay at home this weekend or go shopping for new shoes. The old ones that I bought last year from the shoe store on Saturday were black.

As I approached the bus station I noticed a car going towards it. There was a large puddle right in front of me on the street. I had no time to react. The car was driving at moderate speed and started slowing down. Just as it came over the puddle, it was driving so slow that it went right through the puddle without making a splash. 

The bus arrived. I realized that I had subconsciously opened my umbrella so I closed it just before entering the bus. When I arrived at the station closest to my home I left the bus. I usually stop at the station after my house but for some reason this time I stopped at the one before the house. The rain had stopped so I kept my umbrella closed and went home. I wanted to make a coffee with sugar, so I opened the cupboard and saw the half filled jar of sugar"".

Ok so I'm in love with Kevin and I've been rewatching his scenes in early episodes and one thing just blew my mind on second watch.

Remember in episode 1, Harry gets called by Kevin to speak to Eddie at his house after he's come home from the club covered in blood (and after killing Tommy). Harry arrives and they start chatting. Bella then makes a cup of coffee/tea for Harry. Eddie asks if he can have one too, to which Kevin intervenes and tells Bella not to make him one. But she does anyway. Then, Kevin goes downstairs with Eddie to get his phone I think to give Harry the address of the club.

During this time, Harry takes the first sip of his tea/coffee and makes a disgusted face. Bella then explains that all 3 of them now have to drink oat milk because Kevin has got high cholesterol and has been put on statins. 

THAT'S WHERE IT GETS INTERESTING. 

Then, Harry asks Bella why does she and Eddie have to drink the oat milk. He proposed that both of them drink the normal milk while Kev drinks the oat milk.

THEN BELLA SAYS SOMETHING VERY TELLING WITH EVERYTHING WE KNOW NOW. She says ""I suppose we could keep a secret supply and drink it behind his(Kevin's) back. I don't suppose he'd ever find out."" To which Harry replies ""I don't think he would"" and she smirks. Then Kevin and Eddie both come back upstairs and they continue their talk.

I think Bella was using the oat vs normal milk metaphor to tease Harry about their affair (past or present). And Harry 100% knew what she was talking about and that's why he said what he said. It's so obvious now. They actually did what she's saying, ""keep a secret supply"" and ""drink it behind his back"" and they managed to hide it very well because to this day he still hasn't found out about it, just like they thought.

I think Eddie is actually Harry's and that's why Kevin was so enraged when Maeve told him about his ""other brother"". I think the other brother is actually Harry. She's throwing back the affair between Bella and Harry to Kevin's face and that infuriates him, because he does consider Harry like his brother. And what does his brother do? Sleeps with his wife and gives her a kid. I think Kevin had his doubts, but like everything else he squared it away to preserve the image he had of Bella. And these doubts are reawakened in the scene where he unexpectedly bumps into Harry coming out of Bella's room at the hotel.

TL;DR: I think Bella and Harry were/are having an affair under Kevin's nose and the whole oat milk chat was ""code"" to tease the situation.

I work on night-afternoon shifts while he recently got a job and works on morning shifts, so we never meet during the day unless he comes to my workplace to have coffee (I'm a barista).
I am annoyed by the fact that when I'm free he would rarely go out on dates and would always want to stay home.
Most of the times we got out were when his friends invited him out and I was invited, but when my friends wanted to go out he rarely wanted to tag along.
Long time ago he complained about me not wanting to do more things and go out on dates: he wanted me to make the first step, so I began to stat proposing activities, but the more I did, the more he would refuse and say ""I can't always have to decide everything""
Lately I got more busy: my coworkers and I got closer and started to do stuff together after work; I got into a dnd party; sometimes I have lunch with my mom or I hit the gym.
I always try to get him involved but again he refuses and most of the times he gets on an attitude and when I ask him ""do you want me to cancel and stay with you?"" or ""what's up?"" he'll hit me with ""No. Everything is ok.Go have fun."" he then doesn't want to kiss me goodbye or does it sour.
He barely sees friends tho and when I'm at work or busy and tell him ""ask x or y, they always want to hangout with you"" he answers with ""no.... don't feel like it/we don't have much in common"" which I get it, but still don't complain then, what do you want from me?!
I don't know what to do because he doesn't communicate with me. Don't get me wrong I don't feel guilty, like at all, that's a him problem, but I don't know how to get him to talk about it and I'm tired of being the one pulling things out of his mouth...",1,1748296347.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

Hey there,

I'm a 33 year-old guy from Michigan who thrives in the sunshine hiking, grilling, and just being outdoors when it's not snowing sideways. Come winter, I trade trails for books, binge-worthy shows, coffee, and good company and bonus points if you're a fan of cuddles.

I’m laid back, sarcastic as hell, and quick to laugh once I’m comfortable with someone. Physical touch is my love language, and I’m the kind of guy who’s attentive, dominant, and insatiable behind closed doors — but chill and respectful outside them. If you’re fun, flirty, and down for consistency without pressure, we’ll probably get along great.

I work a hybrid job with odd hours, which makes traditional dating a bit tricky. The upside? I can travel easily if you happen to be near and we get that far and I can  adjust to your schedule pretty well.

A few basics:
5’10”, green eyes, brown hair, athletic build

Drug-free, social drinker

Open to all body types, races, and ages (30+)

Looking for friendship or more or something in between

Respectful of boundaries and low pressure  I know we all have lives

If you’re craving real connection with a fun, no-drama guy who knows how to listen and make you laugh (and maybe bite your lip a little too), shoot me a message. Let’s see where this goes.

1kw6lz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kw6lz1/i_met_another_woman_on_vacation_and_think_about/,I met another woman on vacation and think about her to this day,"Let me start by saying that I love my wife. We’ve been married for several years now and this was a long time ago, during a particularly rocky period of our relationship where we both knew that we might not make it through. Some of you may argue that I couldn’t possibly love my wife given this confession, and I would have agreed with you before it happened to me, but I truly do love her. You may think I’m a bad person and you’re probably right, but I’m doing the best I can now.

A few years ago I went on a solo trip to a somewhat romantic, very relaxing destination. My wife couldn’t come due to work but was fine with me going, and maybe even wanted me gone for a bit given how things had been at home. It was pretty uneventful by design, and I was able to really kick back and relax for the better part of 2 weeks.

In the last few days of my trip I noticed a woman who really stood out to me - to this day the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. Like one of those Instagram models who you figure edits their photos top to bottom, but she just looked like that. She was also acting goofy, playful, and having genuine fun in the water. That intrigued me more than anything, on a resort full of beautiful women who spent hours every day on the beach and never seemed to go in the water.

On my last day, at the beach, I noticed her again. Approaching women had never been my strong suit (my wife and I were introduced through friends) but something possessed me that day to approach her and strike up a conversation. I actually did a countdown in my head to psych myself up into walking over to her, and when I got there, I just said hi and asked if she liked snorkelling since I had noticed her wearing snorkelling goggles in the water, and she said yes. I mentioned a very good spot for it that I had found during my stay and pointed it out to her, then chickened out and walked back to my spot after. A minute later I heard her voice behind me, asking me if I could point the spot out again, and after trying for a moment I suggested that I could just show her. We made our way over to the spot and got to talking, and we discovered that we had both arrived on the same day and would both be leaving the next day, on the same flight with different connecting flights after, to very different places. Eventually we got to the spot and I gave her some quick notes about the spot, she gave me her name and I gave her mine, we exchanged some pleasantries and I headed back to my room. My heart was beating out of my chest for the entire interaction and for a good while after.

I saw her a handful of times throughout the rest of the day and the morning after, but we never spoke, only smiled and waved. I got to the airport, and before I checked in my selected seat got changed to a window seat that had opened up. When i boarded the plane I realized that I was sitting in the row directly behind her. I obviously didn’t want to bother her on the flight at all but once it landed and we were getting our overhead luggage, I asked her how she enjoyed the snorkelling spot. She said it was really nice, and as we walked through the airport to the security checkpoint we chatted about our trips, where we were headed to, her mother made a comment in her native language about me not being very tan (I was extremely tan by my standards) and other small talk, but it felt incredibly genuine and engaging. We both had a few hours to kill before our connecting flights, and it was late (10-11pm or so) and we would both be going to our respective business class lounges at the airport. Eventually we reached a point where we would be splitting off to different concourses to get to our gates, said goodbye, and went our separate ways.

When I got to my gate I sat down for a minute and felt this really strong knot in my stomach, like a horrible sense of regret. I got up and backtracked to the other concourse and went to the lounge there, and after walking around a little bit I found her. She seemed really surprised but happy, I think, and she said that she would have come to the lounge sooner if she’d known but she was doing some airport shopping. We found a quiet corner to settle in for the next few hours, and her mother (who had been with her the whole time throughout this and spoke no English) brought us both coffee and ice cream while we chatted for the next few hours, which was really sweet of her. The conversation was so engaging and fun, and she seemed so genuinely interested in what I was talking about. When we did get to some deeper topics she had this kindness and empathy in her eyes that was unforgettable. There was a moment where we just held eye contact for a good 5-10 seconds with neither of us saying anything and I just felt at peace, like I was understood, and like this person who I barely knew truly cared. I kept watching the clock tick closer to when I would have to leave to catch my flight and I was dreading it. I could have stayed there in that moment forever, but eventually the time came for me to leave.

As I got up and grabbed my bag she stopped me and had me add her WhatsApp, which I would’ve asked for anyways but it was a welcome surprise for her to ask me first. I said my goodbyes to her and her mom, and made my way back to my gate with a real feeling of optimism and a skip in my step. In the months following, nothing ever really worked out. I’m admittedly not a great texter but once we were both back home she got very unresponsive and eventually mentioned that she had a boyfriend who could be quite jealous which is why she was never able to call. I’m still not sure if that was true or just a way to get me to distance myself but either way I pretty much gave up on reaching out after that. Things with my wife improved, we worked through a lot of our issues, went to couples counselling, and things are much better now, but I still think of that woman every now and then. Her striking brown eyes are seared into my memory and I don’t know if I could ever forget them.

I have a lot of conflicting feelings about the whole experience. I could absolutely be looking at a lot of the interactions through rose tinted glasses. Maybe I was inserting myself unfairly by going back to her lounge, but she seemed to have as good of a time as I did. Maybe she was just being nice or polite, but then why did she volunteer her contact info to me without me asking? I just hope that I’m not so socially inept as to have missed some obvious sign that I wasn’t welcome but I’ll never know why it fizzled out with any kind of certainty. Obviously we don’t talk anymore. I haven’t blocked her but I also have no intentions of ever reaching out, especially given how much my life has changed and how long it’s been.

I just wanted to get it off my chest. There’s only two people I’ve ever told about this. If by some insane fluke she’s reading this: I really am sorry if I misread the situation, inserted myself, or made you uncomfortable in any way. I would’ve been happy just being international friends who talk now and then about what they’ve been up to, but I guess it was never meant to be.

I do regret it happening. I think my life would be simpler, that I would feel less guilt, and that I wouldn’t have the thought of her in the back of my mind. If I could go back there I would have never talked to her.

TLDR: While going through a marriage rough patch, I met a woman who is astronomically out of my league while on vacation, it felt like the stars had aligned, we had good chemistry, she was fantastic and kind, but once we weren’t in person it fizzled out and died. I still think about her every so often.",1,1748296254.0,offmychest,1,0.67,False

Sent a woman a hello and a question a few days ago. She matched with me and responded and we’ve had about 3-4 days of friendly chatting. It’s felt like a good fit, so I asked if she wanted to meet up and grab coffee. 

It was awhile before she responded, but when she did, it was very enthusiastic — she suggested which days are easiest for her to make plans and asked where in town I live. I responded with my general neighborhood and availability on one of the days she mentioned. 

That was last night. since then, I haven’t heard back from her. The app says when the message was read — she didn’t read it until this morning….but still, is it weird that she read it 7 hours ago and hasn’t responded? 

The main reason I’m  asking is that Tuesdays are the days that we’re both usually available….and tomorrow is a Tuesday. If it works out, I’d like to meet this week rather than waiting until next — mostly because I find that if I meet someone soon after connecting with them, it’s easier to find things to talk about on the first date.

Not too long after that she's following me to a little coffee shop after work every day.  We chat.  About nothing.  It's all surface level stuff unless she lets her guard down for a second but quickly catches herself.  It's clear to see she's guarded.  Whatever, we're friends and I don't want anything more (yes, actually).  I realize she's not seeing me for who I am.  She's not even trying to.  She just wants a safe space.  A safe person.  She doesn't ask much about me as a person or my opinions or anything.  Still though, you do you.  I'll listen.  I'll ask questions.  I don't mind.  I'm not trying to be her therapist but I also know what it's like to think someone is safe and then be rejected, so I'm not going to do that.  

**Did I fail at setting boundaries?  Abso-fucking-lutely.**

Before too long I realize it.  The hesitation, the seemingly low self worth.  Saying odd things like ""I don't think I deserve to drive a car"" when I asked why she hadn't gotten her license yet, and then slowly letting her guard down and giving me little tidbits of how tumultuous growing up with her mother was.  The way she doesn't eat breakfast or really take care of herself or care about her own well being.

I can see things.  I've seen this before - in myself.  I can see someone who like me spent a lot of time as a child isolated.  We knew all the same childhood shows, all the same little references and quotes from movies and shows that only 90s kids would know.

She's saying everything my inner child has ever wanted to hear.  I don't know what to make of it.

But then time goes on.  I pry.  I ask too many questions.  I try to get close.  I try to help her with her ADHD issues she's expressed to me.  I try to problem solve a lot of things that *she has brought up* because she framed herself as someone to be solved; to be fixed.  I fall for the trap.  I get too close because I want so badly to heal her because it would feel like I'm healing a part of myself - the part that nobody else ever tried to heal.

Pretty soon she's overwhelmed, as am I.  I'm not pushy but I can't just keep having surface level interactions with someone who seems like she's trying to ask for help but won't directly ask for help.

I realize now that wasn't the case, and I was just misinterpreting.

Not too long after we drift apart.  And by ""drift"", I mean she completely stonewalls me.  She's turned off by me in a way I've never experienced before in my life, and that's reasonable.  She avoids me at work entirely.  Won't even look at me.  Goes out of her way to avoid me, as if she's trying to stay 20ft apart at all times.

I don't pry anymore. I don't care.  I ask her what's going on but she ghosts me.  I don't push.  But now I hate going to work because I get a daily reminder of something I don't even know, since she won't articulate it to me.  But that's what trauma is I suppose.  Every time I'm near her she looks terrified.  I haven't said a word to her that isn't work related in over 2 years.  Still though, I feel gaslit.  I feel like an awful person.

At one point I thought she was someone sent from the right hand of God himself to speak to my inner child.  Now I wish I never met her.  I hate feeling like this, especially at work of all places.

And I'm sorry for the Good Will Hunting reference here but I will say this:  **The very best part of my day is from the time I clock in in the morning to when I see her for the first time that day.  Because in those usually ~10 minutes I'm thinking ""Maybe she won't be here.  Maybe yesterday was her last day and she didn't tell anyone, and now she's just gone"".**

It started last summer when we first met. We went from friends to very quickly in a relationship. The relationship was amazing, we never got into arguments or anything but the communication was not all there. So after 4 or so months he broke up with me out of no where. It was a very messy breakup because we both seemed to be distraught about it. I would message him about 2 months later and we talked it out and I got some form of closure. That was in December. 
From December to about 2 weeks ago we didn’t text at all. 
Well, last week or so I had messaged him asking if he’d like to get coffee not expecting him to answer me at all. Well he did and he seemed very excited. I assumed that would be the end of convo until the day we planned to hang. It wasn’t. He kept texting me and checking on me, asking me about my day and sending me pictures and things I liked. It felt like we were really friends again. He was remembering old things about me when we were in the relationship. He was venting to me again and letting me help him out. It honestly seemed like he wanted more out of this hangout then friendship.
We planned to get coffee or lunch on a Thursday. He text me the night before and asked to move it because he had plans with his dad. I said yes, well he then says he needed to move it again but didn’t know exactly what day. I said ok and left him alone for a day or two. I text him on Sunday night and said “hey what’s your schedule looking like this week” 
Got left on read. 
Texted him again 
“Yk if you don’t wanna get lunch anymore that’s fine with me ik this might be a lot” 
Left on read again. But he still wants to view my story’s and everything. I want to give him a piece of my mind but idk if that’s too much. So my question is .. am I overreacting or am I allowed to be this upset over this ",0,1748295721.0,AmIOverreacting,7,0.5,False

# Chapter 1

Shiloh pov:

Shiloh pov:

I never imagined my life will take such a huge turn, never in my wildest dreams have I ever visualized my life turning out this way.

I have always been a good daughter, and the best younger sister anyone could ask of, never done any wrong except for the time I sneaked out with my best friend Emma (Emmalynn) for a party but that is beside the point.

I planned to have good grades, become a fashion designer like my mum and sister, have a handsome guy just like a fairy tale story, live a happy life with him and our kids running around, and have a happy ever after.

Okay back to the point my dream was to have a happy life and if you must know my sister Sylvia and mum are my role models for life.

I always look up to Sylvia, she runs my mum's designer label, married to Garrett Seth, who runs my dad's company and his company with a lovely adorable son Edward, her life isn't perfect but great and living my idea of a fairytale.

But I never had a plan of getting pregnant at 20 years old while still in college or ever thought of losing everything I cherish just in one day.

Your query right now would he how did all this happen to a beautiful girl with so many dreams, I will let you know and I hope you understand mistakes often happen.

I had a beautiful life being the youngest daughter of the Danta family one of the richest billionaire tycoons and dating the only son of the Cristian family among one of the richest multi-billionaire tycoons.

We were high school sweethearts always seen together, Chance is my love and will always be my love, we were inseparable and you can guess that one of the reasons I am where I am now, pregnant with his child, I mean my life was a fairytale every girl will succumb to be like me, Shiloh Malia Sante the unknown daughter of the Danta family.

I sound like a brat right now but you can't help it when your life is just great, not completely great but it's better than having nothing.

It should be easy since we are in love and we could just get married raise the child together and live happily ever after, just the way I dreamt.

But sorry to burst your bubble this is real life there is nothing like happily ever after and I had to learn the hard way.

I can't have that as an end plan when my father is strict and believes in reputation, morals, and learning from every negligence you make.

He believes having a child before getting married is bad luck and an end to my life as an ethical lady.

And also a mother who believes in never settling for less or going for what you can never handle, my Mum, a woman of the limelight every young woman role model, you don't expect her to look good for the spotlight when her daughter is pregnant without getting married.

Since my Dad and Mum had arranged married my dad felt hostility toward it believing not every arrange married can end up great as theirs, and the more reason he hated the idea of getting married just because of a child.

Just by the way, things ended up this is one of the reasons my Dad asked me to leave his house.

Leaving me without an option.

The memories of today run through my mind, making my eyes cloud with unshared tears.

The earlier part of the day.

I sip from my coffee feeling anxious, the morning rays bright welcoming the refinement of the day to some people that is.

The noise of people chatting, flipping sounds of newspapers paired with the ringing sound of the doorbell welcoming people walking in, it is always a busy day in the morning cafe with people rushing for coffee getting ready for an industrious day.

I take another gulp of my coffee looking at the activities going around me trying to focus my mind running through the different scenarios like what will my parents say? Sylvia, will she be angry with me?, what am I thinking, of course, she will be hearing, her baby sister having an unexpected baby.

What have I gotten myself into, I can't bring myself to tell Chance, he will be furious because he always made sure I am always on the pharmaceuticals but just one mistake of mine is about to cost me my relationship.

I can't even think about what my Dad will do getting this information or my Mum, she will be heartbroken, her dreams and ambition for me gone down the drain.

The only person who can give me support right now is my best friend Emma, she is my childhood friend, well more like a sister always getting in trouble and a scamp.

I love her but right now she is keeping me waiting here for almost 30 minutes now, she had a thing for always being late even when we were in high school.

But she is the best so I can't complain, the high pitch sound coming from the door snaps me out of my thought.

I look towards the door my only bestie, her long brown wavy hair left open, flawless skin but what can you expect when her Mum host famous fashion shows, she is glamorous both inward and out.

She smiles glancing my way, a smile that can get any guy on his knees, her boyfriend Damien Mario once a typical playboy is really lucky to have my girl.

She makes her way towards me taking a seat in front of me while studying my facial expression"" girl you are looking sick"" she says concerned lacing her voice before calling for a female waiter to order a mocha overnight oatmeal smoothie.

""Someone requires something sweet"" I tease her with a smirk after the waiter takes her orders.

""whatever,"" she says rolling her eyes before staring at me with a serious look ""back to my question, you look sick because the last time I saw you like this was when Chance called you fat,"" she says laughing, oh don't remind me of that, it made me go on a diet for two weeks and it ended up with me on a hospital bed, I never want to go through that ever again. But he later apologized saying it was just a joke nothing else.

""and right now you are looking just like that, so tell me what is going on"" she urges with a raised eyebrow.

The waiter came with her order placing it on the table with a sweet smile before leaving ""with frequent mood swing like mine, having morning sickness now and then, finding out you are two weeks pregnant "" I pause dramatically thinking everything through ""so yeah, that will undoubtedly make you look sick""

She laughs lightly before smirking "" you got me scared thinking you were pregnant"" she says chuckling before taking a bite from her macho.

""I also wish it was a joke but it's not,"" I  state matter of fact.

Her eyes wide and mouth agape in shock not finding words to say make my anxiety come rushing back, I look everywhere but her feeling embarrassed ""I know this is bad but I need your help"" I beseech still not finding the courage to meet her intense gaze.

She moved sitting close to me ""have you told your parent and Sylvia yet? "" she asks softly as her gaze locks with mine.

""no, I can't do it, what if my mum and Sylvia feel disappointed or worst Dad disowns me, "" I say in panic, my breathing becoming heavy.

She places her hands on my shaking hands making me release my hands from hers then bite my nails nervously, a character I develop during pressure.

""calm down Shiloh, take a deep breath, "" she says pulling my hand away from my mouth.

Taking a slow deep breath calming my nerves ""Thanks "" I say with a smile.

She returns the smile ""so does Chance know about all this?"" she asks running her tub on the tip of the glass.

""no,"" I say sipping from my coffee before putting the bill on the table and walking out towards my car with Emma trailing after me.

""why?"" she says getting into the passenger's seat.

Moving the car out of the parking spot ""I don't know how he will react after constantly telling me to be on pills "" I say with a frown as her gaze burns the side of my face.

""Shiloh you have to let your parents know you can't keep this from your family most importantly Chance,"" she says staring intensely before facing the window.

""Okay,"" I say taking a turn towards Emma's house.

She gave me a look I know so well ""right now"" I ask alarmed.

""yeah of course just drive me to my place and go straight home "" she orders.

""park at the front of the gate, "" she says going through her bag.

""why? I should just take you inside "" I ask confused parking in front of her gate.

""Don't worry I just want you to get this over with,"" she says stepping out of my car before closing it shut"" call me if you need any help ""

""can't you come with me? "" I ask desperately pleading.

She smiles ""not happening,"" she says before entering through the gate.

I sigh loudly before driving off towards the house anxious for what is to happen.

# Chapter 2

Steering into the garage I put the car into park, stepping out of the car I left the key on the key holder.

I stare at the vast wooden glass door with fear of what might be of my fate if the door opens.

Dad prefers living in a luxurious homely environment since my Mum loves flowers she had a small garden for visitors for site seeing.

I fist my hand while the other wrap around the knob but before I could open the door it's pulled open reviewing Kate our cook. She was the one who practically raised me showing me a bit of a mother's love.

She smiles warmly leaving the door open for me to come in ""is Dad and Mom inside? "" I inquire with a smile.

I walk into the kitchen placing my bag on the counter before opening the mini-fridge for an apple juice because my nerves are in overdrive.

""your mum..."" she was cut off by sounds of laughter coming from my Dad's office and little footsteps running towards me.

""Aunt Shiloh"" Edward yells running towards me before draping his little hand around my legs.

A handsome little boy, he is a replication of his dad, except for the color of his hair which he got from Sylvia.

I pull him up placing him on my hip kissing his chubby cheeks making him laugh ""so how is my favorite nephew doing"" I say grinning widely pushing down my nervousness away for now.

""fine, I made a boat today in class using two sheets of paper,"" he says proudly.

I took my apple juice from the counter before using the other to place him properly on my hip then made my way towards the living room laughing as Edward tells me about his day, I place him on the couch before taking a seat close to him drinking from the glass of apple juice.

""where is your Mum(Sylvia)?"" I ask helping him arrange his building toy.

""she is with Grandma, Grandpa, and Dad,"" He says.

""Oh, Shiloh you are back,"" Mum says walking towards us dressed in a summer black gown reaching below her knees and brown hair curled and left open looking beautiful as always.

""hey mum"" I greet with a smile from my place on the couch, Sylvia, Garrett and Dad walk down the stairs walking towards the living room ""hey big girl,"" Sylvia says welcoming me into an embrace.

""I was thinking you were never coming to visit"" I joke as we both laugh.

""of course not I can never let you have a minute of rest"" she winks.

I laugh ""brother-in-law what a wonderful surprise, "" I say grinning while Dad scoops Edward from the floor hugging him to his chest

Dad sends a smile towards my direction before speaking,"" what have you been up to Shiloh? "" Dad asks taking a sit on the couch placing Edward on his lap.

I gulp down nervously fear running through me, does he know? no, it can't be.

I blinked twice "" Um... Everything is going fine, classes resume next week "" I say coolly hiding any trace of fear in me before sitting back on the settee with Sylvia while mum sits with Dad then Garrett sits on the armchair.

My phone vibrates from the front pocket of my jeans, I pulled it out seeing it was a text message from Emma ""what was their reaction"" she asks concerning sharing the news with my family.

""I am yet to tell them"" I text back.

""you have to let them know to get it off your chest"" she text back.

She is right I have to get this out of my system it's not like I can keep it from them forever"" I will do it soon"" I text back.

I tuck my phone back into my pocket before looking up to find everyone chatting and laughing, finding little confidence in Emma's words.

You can do this.

I need a little time maybe tomorrow.

No, I have to do this right now.

Huh, I sigh inwardly.

""I have something to say and it's very important,"" I say not meeting anyone's gaze.

The place becomes quiet, I anxiously look up to meet Dad's intense stare, Edward and Garrett were no longer in the room.

""I...I...I..."" I can say this?.

I exhale and inhale my chest hurting as everyone waits patiently for me to continue, Sylvia places her hand on mine getting my attention "" Shiloh relax you are having an anxiety attack "" she says worriedly.

I exhale directing my gaze on the most precious floor ""Iampregnant"" I sprint out in one breath.

""Darling calm down we can't get what you are trying to tell us,"" Mum says concern lacing her voice.

""I am pregnant, "" I say reluctantly.

My words lingered in the air as silence enveloped us.

I shift my gaze towards Dad meeting his sizzling gaze, the anger in them making me flinch back.

Mom and Sylvia looked thunderstruck, the couch feels hot from their intensified gaze making me squirm.

""what? "" Sylvia asks jumping from the couch in anger and shock evident on her face.

My gaze focuses down to my feet feeling like a disappointment to my family"" does Chance know you are pregnant? "" she asks calmly which is very surprising.

I shake my head in a no with tears threatening to spill, she fell back on the couch shaking her head in disappointment.

""Shiloh I am so disappointed in you, how can you do this to yourself, forgetting which family you are from,"" Mom says angrily glimmer of tears in her eyes.

My heart broke from the words she said, never had my mum called me a disappointment or looked at me with some much pain in her eyes.

But she is right how can I be so stupid to let this happen ""Mum please don't say that, it was a mistake on my path but please don't "" I plead with tears running down my cheeks, I can't tolerate seeing my mum in pain and also because of me.

""I gave you everything, we made plans together,"" she says in outrage while Sylvia tries to stop her from saying more "" but what did you do? go get yourself pregnant by that playboy who doesn't even respect you or care,"" she says bitterly.

I shake my head ""no he loves me and he cares, I am sure he will accept this child "" I say with all confidence.

My parents were never happy with my relationship with Chance saying he is a rake, very aggressive, arrogant, and filled with pride lavishing his father's money.

I tried to let them know he loves me but gave up because they were standing their ground but I had my sister backing always.

Strangely quiet Dad stood suddenly from his chair"" Shiloh I never expected this from you but it seems you are all grown up now and can take care of yourself and a baby"" he says maliciously ""so I am giving you the freedom to do what so ever you like, leave this house with your belongings"" he orders calmly.

""Dad please I can't survive on my own"" I pleaded desperately.

""I am not done talking, "" he says angrily ""your car, bank cards will be confiscated, I will take care of your college fees and the rest is up to you""

""you are not allowed to mention this family's name or come near us until you become responsible and made something of your life"" he continues has sobbing rank my body, Mum, and Sylvia also in tears.

""leave this house within 45 minutes"" he turns to look at me with pain and anger evident in his eyes ""I warned you about that chap so bear the consequences of your actions,"" he says walking away towards the stairs.

I ran towards him standing in front of him blocking him from taking a step forward "" Dad please, forgive me. Dad, you can't do this to me, please. Please "" I dropped on my knees for him to take his orders back.

He shoves me out of his way walking up the stairs, I run towards Mum pleading "" Mum please help me speak with Dad. I know it's my mistake but please Mum. I am still your little girl, right? "" I say hugging her tightly.

I cried for what it's worth because no one can ever change my father's decision, he never goes back on his word but I just wish he could take his words back or Mum could try speaking to him.

She did something that would never be erased from my memory ""Kate"" she yells, I pull away from her confused, Kate came running from the kitchen"" pack everything that belongs to Shiloh send it out of this house"" she orders while Kate nods in reply before giving me a look of sympathy listening to everything that went on.

Mum glance back at me ""you know how your father is, he will never listen to a word anyone says"" she takes my hands in hers ""I want you to live with Chance even if I don't like him but this is the only way I can think of, but it for a few months until I get your father to bring you back,"" she says tears in her eyes before leaving.

Sylvia hugs me tightly ""it will be okay,"" she says leaving me mystified standing in the same spot before dropping on my knees stuffing my face into my palms and quaking with sobs.

I drown in self-pity, feelings of lonesomeness overwhelming my heart.

I (33M) matched with this woman (30F) about 4 months ago. We chatted and everything was going well, we moved to texting pretty quickly. We really didn’t make plans to meet up initially due to some family things happening on her side and our work schedules didn’t line up. She ended up going on vacation and she said she was going to text me when she got back. Vacation happened and I never heard back from her. So fast forward to about 2 weeks ago I redownloaded and remade a Hinge account and started swiping and saw her profile. 

I said to myself I’m going to send one more text and almost like a last ditch shot to see if this was worth it (cause I still had her number). She responded and told me that her and I, to her, felt like “pen pals” and we weren’t making plans to meet and she didn’t feel like there was a reason to keep messaging. I said that it felt like with what was going on with her family, our schedules and the trip happening it didn’t seem like it was the best time to initiate a date but she was still interested, I wanted to meet and take her on a date. She agreed and we planned something for that weekend. 

That came and went with her telling me that there was a mass that she forgot about for her recently passed uncle and we were going to plan something for this weekend. We planned for dinner on Sunday night but she told me yesterday morning that she’s come down with a severe allergic reaction and she said she would text me tomorrow (today) to see if she was feeling better for coffee. Now it’s almost 6pm and I haven’t heard from her, even though I sent a message this morning saying that I hope she felt better. 

Now from all the posts I’ve seen, this pretty much means I’m cooked, but I just would want to get some ideas if I should just send her one more message and be like I think this is just not meant to be and hope she finds something that works for her. ",1,1748295153.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

1kw61nd,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1kw61nd/i_finally_quit_368/,i finally quit! (368),"i put in my two weeks on may 16th! it's bittersweet honestly, because i love working with coffee and my partners. i also met lots of cool customers at a ton of different stores. but with the terrible new ceo, i felt as if it was taking a turn for the worse. the final straw was when i transferred home from college. while i was gone, my home store went through many managers, and the one i came back to put me in a unfortunate scenario. i put in my transfer paperwork with my manager in my college state in april, and she heard nothing from the manager at my home state. calls, emails, all with no response at all. then, when i finally get home for the summer, i find out that i'm still not transferred in, regardless of her telling me that she would get it done (i had called her multiple times). so, for my first week back, i was working her manager shifts up until admin block while she went on vacation, still without approving my transfer. i eventually reached out to a proxy manager and he approved it, but at that point, i was fed up. additionally, the store was very uncoordinated and dysfunctional and i was just stuck on bar for 5+ hours a day because i was the only one comfortable with bar on shift. 

note: can anyone confirm if the following is true or not because ive never heard of it. my manager said that i had to have ""open availability"" as a transfer all summer or else i couldn't work at that store. i've been told she's making it up, but i want to be sure before i just complain about it lol.",1,1748294806.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False
1kw60hz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruises/comments/1kw60hz/princess_is_the_worst_line_weve_cruised_on/,Princess is the worst line we’ve cruised on 🫠,"We have cruised with Carnival and Disney so yes, very different ends of the spectrum 😂 However, we are currently on Grand Princess (first time with Princess) and I have to say - this is hands down the worst cruise experience I’ve ever had. I had high hopes (and I’m still grateful for the destination!) but this is 100% a never again. I will also share with everyone possible to avoid this line at all costs - I would hate for anyone to make this mistake we did.

First, and probably most horrifying, they do not clearly state which port to arrive at — anywhere. No, I kid you not. Go ahead and Google “Princess port Seattle” and you’ll probably get #91. We had to Google because nothing - our documents from Princess, our app, any communication from them - NOTHING stated where to go.

Well guess what? It wasn’t 91, it was 66 😡 how in the world were we supposed to know that? At 91, we saw hundreds of people made the same mistake and we were all frantically ordering Uber/Lyft to get to the right port. I have never in my life witnessed any company so incredibly unprofessional.

Next, let’s talk about this Plus/Premier BS. Y’all have got to be kidding me 😂 With both Disney & Carnival, most things are included except just a select few restaurants/upgrades. Although the upgrades are nice, it never feels like an obligation but a fun treat here and there, if desired.

I expected something similar and didn’t think much of it. I looked over the offerings and skipped. Little did I know, it was an absolute trap and essentially holding folks hostage to have a chance to even enjoy their vacation 😂 Why? Because the “regular” food is absolutely HORRENDOUS. This food is disgusting! And yes, been on several different Carnival cruises and their food is actually better than this! (Even the dessert, come on Lava cake!) You can’t sort mediocre crap in a nice presentation and pretend it tastes good - it doesn’t and you know it. It is bland, boring, and traps people into feeling convinced they need the upgraded package.

Also, are you serious that only water, lemonade, and mud coffee are free? Sodas are charged? Seriously? Mind blown. Even the desserts are bland, tasteless, and hard. Y’all, even the rolls were rock hard! They are not even pretending to put in any effort here!

Even room service comes at an upcharge?(Food and even the “complimentary” bath robes). Never in my life have I seen a cruise line do so. Absolute bottom of the barrel.

The idea of “customer service” is completely absent. It simply doesn’t exist. When we ask simple questions, very politely, we’re either brushed off or given incorrect information. This has happened so many times we stopped asking them for anything (intentional on their part, I see now). Even our room steward insisted my 10 year old son sleep in the couch bed that was made too small (when we kindly asked her to expand it) and he slept terribly. Once we noted to her this occurred, she begrudgingly opened it (and before you ask, no, she wouldn’t let us just open it ourselves; she claimed she had to for some reason 🤔).

When we call Guest Services to ask a question,  they let it ring and then hang up 😂 We just have to keep trying over and over… dozens of times to ever get through to ask a simple question. This morning, our cabin phone doesn’t even work anymore. It literally doesn’t operate 😂 they apparently disconnected it.

Which, by the way, we wouldn’t have to ask if anything was ever clear. There is so much ambiguity about times, locations, and events, it is nearly impossible to enjoy yourself in this dump.

The hot tubs are constantly over run as there are simply not enough available for a cool weather cruise (they would close some/not open all). People will rot in there for hours marinating in their own body soup and refuse to leave. I got into one finally near the adults only area and it was actually cold 😩 unbelievable. So I walked into the sauna right next door and was reprimanded because I didn’t pay for access (????). At no point was there ever any sign, indication, or request to pay for the sauna (lol of all things) or I would have gladly! Every cruise I’ve been on, this has never been an issue. I felt absolutely humiliated and pointed out to her that I checked in at the front desk and was told nothing about this nor any signs or notifications anywhere indicated a price point for the sauna. I just looked through everything on the app, our papers, everything, and not one single thing indicates the sauna is paid access.

On top of everything, there is nothing truly entertaining to do on this ship. Nothing. This is hands down the most boring cruise I’ve ever imagined! The nightly “entertainment” is incredibly poor quality and that is about all you’re offered. Otherwise, good luck during the day! It’s just hour blocks of staff trying to get you to buy horrendously ugly stuff no one in their right mind would ever purchase- if they weren’t been held hostage on this boring to death ship 😩 I mean again, I get it. It’s all part of the trap.

We were enticed with the promise that the Kids Club would offer educational “games” or enrichment sponsored by National Geographic. Fat chance! They sit ‘em in front of TV screens with video games 😂 I mean I guess it’s better than “nothing” but it’s like, don’t say you’re going to do something then not.

Oh, and we can’t even wash our clothes in the laundromat because they’re closed and they’re not sure when they’re gonna reopen 🙄 I mean, this is almost comedic at this point.

Again, all in all, worst experience I’ve ever had.

While people dump on Carnival all the time, I’ve actually had some surprisingly great times there (and some not so great!) and Disney is always amazing but then you pay for that, so not surprising 😂 Let me tell you, going from Disney to Princess is like mansion level to slum level. Princess is easily bottom of the barrel. Will never make that mistake again!

We came to see Alaska/Canada and I’m glad we did. Of course I don’t regret that. However, I will ensure in the future, even for destination cruises, it is never Princess again.

I would highly advise anyone looking to cruise to strongly avoid this line at all costs.

Forgot a few more things:

Motion detectors in the room 😡 we couldn’t budge an inch without super bright lights going off and no way of turning them off. Just fabulous if you’re traveling with young kids or babies.

Flew Down on Thursday morning we stayed at a small Air bnb that Dan found close to the venue, and a huge shout out to Cosmic (my Discord mod and fellow denizen) and his wife who gave Dan and I rides so that we did not have to use an uber all the time. 

—————

This is my second GW big competitive event , the first being WCW last November I was excited to take a run at it with my Drukhari, having done well at LVO my goal heading into it was to place top 16, as I’m looking to place top of the ITC (have to dethrone Josh Roberts) and I’d love to do it with my fave faction ! Through thick or thin. 
The venue was awesome, a huge e-sports arena big screen at the front , cool stage air con … I arrived early Thursday in the morning so I got to hang out at the venue and help the GW staff set up tables and terrain, especially for the narrative event that was going to start on Saturday. 

This event started on Friday morning, 3 days of Warhammer ! At least 8 rounds (9 with the potential shadow) . Starting at 9:30 am and running till 8 or 8:30 pm each day (except for Sunday) - these events are a test of endurance ! Up on your feet , thinking , leaning over tables… it was time to roll some dice. 
After a good chill evening checking into the Air bnb it was coffee and toast in the morning , and heading to the venue for the event !

And this is how it went down :

Day 1 

Round 1 vs Chaos Deamons Index Detachment - 
3 thirsters , belakor and skarbrand, 2 sullcannon and 3 beasts. 

Mission Supply Drop - Went Second - Lost by 8 points. 

Oooofffff - well there you have it, a round one loss. This is one of the hardest things to take in when you are pushing for a competitive goal. Being that my goal is to be top of the ITC this season I was heartbroken to have lost this game. However , it is also one of the best lessons you can take and show at a high level. There are two routes one takes for here - let it affect the rest of your event , drip out , be miserable -or- the choice I made chin up, take the loss , analyze it for later , feel sad for a bit , let yourself feel. Picked myself up , dusted myself off , and took each game one at a time like I always do with a fresh outlook. 
Mental toughness is so important in competition, and it is something that is learned and becomes a habit. It’s ok to feel emotions about it , but it’s important to not let a game that did not go to plan dictate the remainder of an event ! 
Also, huge kudos to my opponent -
I was in total control of the game we played for the first 3 and a half turns. 
I made one mistake on a “eff it lets gamble” that did not pay off (used my only pain token on a scourge unit to try and kill a beast of nurgle , that resulted in 0 damage from my darklances on it, this prevented me from having a pain token for my hellions when I needed to kill a bloodthrister and it lived on 2 wounds and killed all my hellions and then my archon in the next turn, so it cascaded from there) and he just stuck it out , he showed great tenacity and was able to pull the rug right from under me on the last turn with a 21 point turn. He went on to the top bracket and ended up with a respectable record ! I can’t wait for the rematch.  But with 8 points in his favour , the game had swung his way. I was under the information that top bracket was top 16 4-0 but as there were 17 undefeated after 4 rounds , it expanded to top 32 and a shadow round … I was 34th at the split. Had I my opponent win percentage been a bit better I could have made it in to the top bracket and competed for the top spot even with a loss ! 



Round 2 vs Space Marines Gladius 
Repulsor , Repulsor Executioner , 10 hellblasters, 10 infernus , 15 intersessors , 3 preds, 6 bladeguard , heavy intersessors + characters 

Mission Scorched Earth - Went First - 93-27 victory. 

So , after lunch it was on to hame two. This time into a unique gladius marine army, I am very comfortable playing against marines with my Drukhari, I feel like I have all the tools to just annihilate power armour. My opponent made a fantastic move round 1 , declaring assault doctrine and running everything forward at me at speed , even one of his predators! His plan was to charge a scourge unit to tankshock it as he could not get any angles on it , this sort of yolo move is terrifying at events as when it pays off for the player that does it it can just throw a wrench into the pairing ! 
Luckily for me , the charges all failed - and my ensuing turn solidified the win for me. 


Round 3 vs Ultramarines Gladius - Guilliman , Calgar , Vindicators , ballistus (good stuff) 

Mission Ritual - Went First - 98-64 victory 

Last game of Day one ! More space marines. This time against gladius ultras with all the “meta” stuff. Hammer and anvil on the ritual meant I was able to stay back and play the long game on the scoring going first allowed me to kill and exploded ballistus , the lone op lieutenant with the beast pack and tie up one of the vindicators. This set me up for the rest of the game. My opponent was inexperienced with the list and was playing it as it was an easy army to pilot. One of the highlights of the game was urien making so many invuls and feel no pains , only for calgar to
Do the same thing once his heroes were all dead ! Like seriously , 18-26 4++ or 4+ fnp against lelith and incubi and Drahzar , it was insane. I do believe a 4++ should never have a 4+ fnp lol. So with a few wins under my belt , it was chill time. Went to dinner with Dan (my sponsor from the Red Dragon) Cosmic (one of my coaching clients and discord mod) and other denizens, his wife and Mr Don Hooson the crab 🦀 man himself ! (Who was crushing all with his DG list, he made top bracket and eventually lost in the shadow round against the eventual winner) It was a great time. 

I slept like a stone.  Also holy moly Texas is super hot and humid , thank goodness for Air Conditioning.

Day 2 

Round 4 vs World Eaters , new codex - index detachment - 20 zerkers in rhinos , 2 spawn units , foot prince , 3 forgefiends , exalted 8bound , 20 jackals , gorechosen , kharn , moe. 

Mission Linchpin - went first - 96-46 victory 

So, it was one more round before they split the players in to the pods for the final 4 rounds. And I get to play my first game into the new WE codex using berzerker warband. A quick read over their detachment rule, and enhancements and starts and I was ready to rock … holy moly are they fast. Going first allowed me to stage up and move block his whole right flank with my beast pack. They all ford but provided me with valuable intel … khorne spawn are … insane . So now I had to kill them priority one ! In this game tho , it was the plane that just …
Was amazing. Plane arrived… I killed a rhino, the plane proceeded to kill all 10 zerkers and almost the character in its activation. Then , survived with 1 wound agains the forgefiends because I had made some grotesques the closest target for them to prevent re rolls to hit. Only to then use the no overwatch strat to just move up, and delete the second unit of berserkers with kharne as they had failed a charge the previous turn. I also killed 2 of the forgefiends that turn and it was basically over. 

So with that win the field was split into brackets. I was 34th / 277 missed out on top 32 (tier 1) bracket barely. So ! Time to play in the 3-1 (tier 2) bracket. Cosmic , and Dan had both made the same bracket as me as well ! So after lunch , we see the pairings and bam … I’m paying Cosmic - a chance for the student to beat the master! 

Round 5 vs Ynnari - guardian + warlocks brick , yncarn 

Mission Terraform - went first - 88-84 victory - super close , Urien survived on one wound , presicioned out the Visarch from the yvraine brick and that flipped the game as I was able to kill the unit as it was tied up preventing movements and overwatch. Had this moment not happened  it was a loss for me. Cosmic played the game very well, using his resources expertly and simply playing the bottom turn , he even went to secret mission and succeeded to get even more points on primary at the end. One of the best tactical moves I witnessed all event was in this game, where Cosmic heroic intervened against my Beastpack when I charged him turn one with a jetbike warlock to prevent my clawed friend from being able to pile in and fight into his jetbikes, this allowed the jetbikes to survive and basically go on to kill my plane on overwatch lol 😂 . As the dust settled I was barely up thanks to having terraformed one objective turn 1 that gave me points all game!  And with that , it was on to the last game of day 2. 

Round 6 vs Custodes - lions with wardens , Drax, Trajan, bikes and calladius tank. 

Mission Burden of Trust - went first - 64-61 victory 

Time to play some against some lions ! This was also going to be a great match , Stefan who is on the Austrian WTC team he was certain I was going to win this game , but on burden of trust , against wardens … I was not so certain. The game flipped in Stefan’s favour when I failed to kill the calladius tank with my shooting turn 2 , living with 2 wounds , it killed my plane … all of a sudden it was a game ! He smelt blood in the water and yeeted 10 wardens into the middle of the table. Luckily enough I was able to barely kill enough to deny primary points on the 3-4 th turn and hold on to a very close win. 😅 with that ! Time to go for dinner. Don Hooson had made it to the shadow , so we went to dinner, as GW provided the shadow round players with a meal, that was cool. 

Day 3 

Once again slept really well. I was so tired ! Also got to follow the hockey and the panthers just … annihilating the other team.
Two more games! There were 8 or 9 players that were undefeated in the bracket so far. So I was bound to have two more challenging games. One Game at a Time. 

Round 7 vs Custodes - lions with bikes , callidus assassin - 18 terminators + characters. 

Mission Purge the Foe - went second - 100-57 victory. 

So I got to play against lions again ! This time with - all the terminators. I love purge against armies like this, I don’t throw away my units lightly … so I try not to give up kills without making my opponent pay, also if he split his terminators I would have many kills , and pain tokens … (he did not split anything) he went first tho ! This was perfect as on purge it allows me to set the tone of the kill. The game started with his bikes blasting into the middle to get area denial , and the. Proceeded to make zero invuls against my shooting so I could get a kill and almost kill the bike captain. The main mistake my opponent made was putting too many things in reserves … I was able to take over the entire table and force his reserves into bad spots , sticky objectives became my friends and I was able to screen the table effectively while being able to focus fire. In this game again, the bomber lived on one wound , and a cheeky ignore overwatch allowed me to bomb the callidus and shoot her to death the next turn (hehe callback to LVO, my bomber the callidus assassin, assassin) 

Well, one more round !  And it was going to be into either of the two Necrons players that were undefeated , or knights ! 

I ended up against the Knights ! Dicky , golden ticket holder and very consistent faction specialist ! I was in for a treat of a tactical game. Also shout out to him, it was a very fun and friendly match , but also very tight and competitive , he had tokens for everything , rolled super clearly , stated intent and him and I had an awesome match , I love these kinds of games (also had this style of game with Cosmic) were tight gameplay is expected but it’s also super fun, peak tournament 40K. 

Round 8 vs Imperial Knights - noble Lance - 2 big knights , 4 hellverins 2 wardogs , sisters in immolator , and callidus 

Mission Take and Hold - went first - 76-54 victory 

Going first in this mission really helped me. His list had all the right tools to make my game hard, the sisters and the immolator especially, but also the uppy downy errant and 4 hellverins ! (Made my plane cry) this game … was a roller coaster and what felt like a comfortable matchup for me usually quickly felt like it would sneak away from me after my haywire scourge did a combined total of 6 dev wounds to one hellverin over my first 2 turns … yup …. It was crazy. My opponent put the pressure on and by my turn 3 it seemed like he was going to swing it late game. 
The main thing that kept me in the game was denying him primary as much as he denied me primary, as well as keeping my haywire scourge alive for the late game. 
It all came to fruition my turn 4… I was able to kill both big knights , and tie up one of the last two little knights , and kill his callidus and tie up the sisters, even had to charge with scourge! 
This allowed me to score a 15 on turn 5 and deny him that late game score …
As the dust settled, that was my run! 7-1 top of the bracket ! I’ll take that. 

At the end of the day, I did not achieve my main goal of top 16 at the event, but even some of the top 32 did not even play all their games. There were only a handful of  players that went 7-1 at the event and I was one of them. After that game one upset, I am proud of what I achieved. 

So, what did I learn ? Well , I’ll be doing a full tournament in review that will release on Tuesday. So stay tuned for that as well as changes that I’ll be making for the list etc etc. 

A huge shout out to Dan and Red Dragon Ottawa, and my Patreons.

It's not like I didn't try. I went to networking events, did a couple stupid coffee chats, got my resume ATS compliant and looked over by my college's career center, and did mock-interviews with a counselor. Over a hundred applications and six interviews (two of which went second round) later, dice. I'm going to have to work my stupid customer service job that only gives me part time hours this summer. 

Whatever, at least I can hang out with my boyfriend, right? Wrong, I had to dump him because apparently I'm a lesbian. I tried to be as amicable as I could about it, but he just kept talking about how he felt so unwanted and  ""didn't understand."" Then, he threw out a bunch of stuff I'd made for him along with some knitting supplies I'd been keeping at his place because mine just had bedbugs. I managed to stash most of the stuff I cared about in my freezer, but he did throw out this cabled hat I was making, and I'm unreasonably sad about it. I don't even wear hats. The pattern just made me happy, and now I can't bring myself to start a new one. 

Cool, no boyfriend, no new job, but I always have my friends? Kind of. They're all transferring to universities in different cities while I've been living at home and attending a local university. They're also all in relationships, have jobs that give them more than like twenty hours a week, and are busy sorting out housing and doing couples shit. I did make two new local friends in my major, but one of them just get into a relationship. She's the type to just disappear for a couple months during her honeymoon phase. The other was never actually my friend. I avoided a couple of red flags because I was just excited to make a new friend after transferring colleges and hung out with him one-on-one like an idiot. He fucking groped me when we went to get coffee, and now he's blocked. Luckily, he lives on the other end of the city, so he won't be hard to avoid. 

I am trying my best to make sure I won't spend the summer just rotting in bed and playing videogames or whatever, but it's fucking hard. I signed up to volunteer at my local library to help old people with their computers because I genuinely believe in tech literacy, and it's something to put on my resume. Plus, I have my job so I'll literally have to live my house at least three times a week, but other than that, I don't fucking know. I'm going to turn twenty one in a couple of weeks, so I might be able to go out with some of my friends once or twice this summer, but trying to coordinate all of their schedules is kind of a nightmare. Literally everyone's schedule is packed except for mine. I guess I should do some studying, but I just don't have the willpower to open my laptop.

# RV In line Water Filter: 2025's Best Buying Guide

Water is essential for any triumphant RV trip,and ensuring its purity is paramount for your health and safety. An RV in line water filter acts as a crucial barrier against contaminants,providing clean and potable water for drinking,cooking,and showering. This guide will explore the best RV in line water filters available in 2025, highlighting thier features, benefits, and ideal users, helping you make an informed decision for your next adventure.

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of an RV in line water filter hinges on several key features, each contributing to its ability to purify water.

**Filtration Capacity:** The capacity of a filter refers to the amount of water it can effectively filter before needing replacement. It’s usually measured in gallons. Different filters offer varying capacities, ranging from a few hundred gallons to several thousand. Selecting a filter with adequate capacity for your typical RV usage is crucial to avoid frequent replacements and ensure continuous water purity.

This directly impacts the filter's lifespan and the frequency of replacements. A larger family or frequent travelers would benefit from a higher capacity filter, while occasional campers might find a smaller capacity sufficient.Consider your water consumption habits when choosing a filter's capacity.

**Micron Rating:** The micron rating specifies the size of particles the filter can effectively remove. A lower micron rating indicates finer filtration, capable of capturing smaller contaminants. RV water filters typically range from 5 microns to 20 microns.A 5-micron filter will remove finer particles than a 20-micron filter, resulting in cleaner and tastier water.

Sediment, rust, and other particulate matter are removed based on the micron rating. A lower micron rating not only improves water clarity but may also extend the lifespan of your RV's plumbing system by preventing the buildup of sediment.

**Materials and Construction:** The materials used in the filter's construction determine its durability and resistance to pressure. Look for filters made from BPA-free, food-grade plastics that can withstand the rigors of RV travel and fluctuating water pressures. A robust design ensures the filter doesn't crack, leak, or degrade prematurely.

Reinforced housings and sturdy connections are important for a long-lasting filter.Some filters utilize activated carbon, KDF media, or other advanced materials to enhance filtration capabilities. Choosing a filter with high-quality construction minimizes the risk of failure and ensures reliable performance.

**Flow Rate:** The flow rate is the volume of water that passes through the filter per minute, usually measured in gallons per minute (GPM). A higher flow rate means you can fill tanks or shower without significant pressure reduction. Though, excessive flow rates can reduce the filter's effectiveness, as water has less contact time with the filtration media.

A balance between flow rate and filtration effectiveness is desired.Consider your RV's plumbing system and typical water usage when selecting a filter with an appropriate flow rate. some filters offer a high flow rate without sacrificing filtration quality through advanced design and materials.**Certifications and Standards:** Independant certifications, such as NSF international, indicate that the filter has been tested and meets specific performance standards for contaminant reduction. Look for filters certified to NSF/ANSI Standards 42 and 53, which address aesthetic effects (chlorine taste and odor) and health effects (lead, cysts, etc.), respectively.

Certifications provide assurance that the filter performs as claimed. They ensure that the filter has undergone rigorous testing and meets the industry's defined benchmarks for safety and effectiveness. Choosing a certified filter gives you confidence in its ability to provide clean and safe water.

## Core Benefits

Using an RV in line water filter provides numerous benefits that enhance your RV experience.

**Improved Water Quality:** The primary benefit is significantly improved water quality. Filters remove sediment, chlorine, and other contaminants that can affect the taste, odor, and safety of your water. This results in cleaner,clearer,and better-tasting water for drinking,cooking,and showering.

In many campgrounds and RV parks, water sources may contain undesirable levels of contaminants. An in line filter provides an extra layer of protection, ensuring your water is safe and palatable. Improved water quality also reduces the risk of waterborne illnesses, contributing to a healthier and more enjoyable RV lifestyle.

**Extended Plumbing System Life:** By removing sediment and other particulate matter, in line filters can help extend the lifespan of your RV's plumbing system. Sediment buildup can clog pipes and fixtures, reducing water pressure and potentially causing damage. A filter prevents these issues, keeping your system running smoothly.

this reduces the need for costly repairs and maintenance. Clean water also prevents the buildup of scale and corrosion in pipes, fixtures, and water heaters. Investing in a water filter is a proactive step to protect your RV's plumbing infrastructure.

**Enhanced Taste and Odor removal:** Many in line filters incorporate activated carbon, which is highly effective at removing chlorine, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and other substances that cause unpleasant tastes and odors. This results in water that tastes and smells significantly better, improving the overall experience of using water in your RV.

No more chlorine taste in your morning coffee or tap water. Enjoy fresher, cleaner-tasting water for all your drinking and cooking needs. Enhanced taste and odor removal makes your RV water more appealing to drink, encouraging better hydration during your travels.

**Protection Against Waterborne Illnesses:** Some in line filters are designed to remove harmful bacteria, cysts, and other microorganisms that can cause waterborne illnesses. This provides an extra layer of protection against contaminated water sources, ensuring the safety of you and your family.Campgrounds and RV parks sometimes experience water contamination issues. Having a filter that can remove these harmful microorganisms provides peace of mind. It's especially essential for travelers who frequently use water from unkown or unreliable sources.

## FAQs Section

**How often do I need to replace my RV in line water filter?**
The replacement frequency depends on the filter's capacity and your water usage. generally, filters should be replaced every 3 to 6 months, or after filtering the specified gallon capacity. Regular replacement ensures optimal performance and water quality.

**Can I use an RV in line water filter on a garden hose?**
Yes, most RV in line water filters are compatible with standard garden hose connections. This makes them versatile for use with various water sources. Though, ensure the filter is rated for the water pressure and temperature of your water source to prevent damage.

**Are all RV in line water filters the same?**
No, different filters offer varying levels of filtration, capacity, and features. Some filters are designed for basic sediment removal, while others incorporate advanced filtration technologies for removing chlorine, lead, and other harmful contaminants. Choose a filter that meets your specific needs and water quality concerns.

**How do I install an RV in line water filter?**
Installation is typically straightforward. Most filters connect directly to the water hose between the water source and your RV's water inlet. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper installation and sealing.It's important to ensure a tight connection to prevent leaks.

A quick search confirmed it: a fast-moving tempest was sweeping through Houston, here and gone in three hours. So I pulled on pants, a shirt, grabbed my thermos of coffee, and stepped outside.  


At first, I leaned against the hood of my car, face tilted skyward. The rain was sparse then, just whispers of drops. But something in me needed more. Without thinking, I climbed onto the windshield and lay there, watching the water streak down from the gray expanse above. The tree nearby framed the falling drops, turning them into fleeting silver threads. When the rain paused, I slid off, only for my landlord to appear. We talked under the drizzle until it thickened, then retreated to his carport.  


Back inside, I listened to the faint tap-tap on the roof. But the pull was still there. I went out again.  


Two years and five months had passed since I’d last done this—stood bare to the sky, craving the rain’s absolution like some half-remembered baptism. That time, I’d lasted less than 15 seconds. This time, I stayed.  


Coffee in hand, I stood with my back against the car’s hood, leaning into its solid shape—not lying down like before, just resting there, my legs braced against the front bumper as the rain fell. 


 Not a downpour, but steady. My sunglasses let me stare upward without flinching (maybe a flinch or two) as the water fell toward my face. There’s a difference, you know, between watching rain from a distance and feeling it birth itself out of nowhere above you. Each drop became a tiny revelation. I breathed in the petrichor, that earthy scent of awakened soil, and watched the clouds churn.  


Time blurred. Five minutes? Ten? Long enough for my hair to plaster itself to my scalp, for my shirt to cling like a second skin. I held out my palms, let the water pool in my cupped hands, then traced the beads with my fingertips—a silent ritual of catching and releasing. The rain grew heavier, each drop a deliberate punctuation on my skin. 


When the rhythm shifted from cleansing to drenching, I knew it was time. I grabbed my thermos and walked inside, dripping and oddly light. The storm had given me what I needed.

I'm a 36-year-old woman who recently moved back to the Houston area, and I'm hoping to meet people with similar interests to build some meaningful friendships. I'm open to friends of any gender, but just to be clear, I’m happily in a relationship and only seeking platonic connections.

I'm not really into drinking or the bar/club scene anymore, so I’m a bit out of my element when it comes to meeting new people these days. I also have social anxiety, which makes it tough to initiate conversations (especially with strangers), but I’m kind, genuine, and always happy to connect once I feel comfortable.

I love reading, art (drawing & painting), photography (though I don’t currently own a camera), and DIY projects. I like walking on nature trails, gardening, city biking (I ride a road bike), thrifting, traveling, cooking and baking. My favorite movie genre is horror (but I do watch others). I like collecting and admiring oddities/curiosities, and specimens. Music is also a huge passion—especially punk, metal, goth, garage, post-punk, etc. I love going to shows and collecting records and tapes. I’m far left on the political spectrum.

Due to chronic health conditions, I do have some physical limitations, so I’m not looking for a gym buddy or to train for marathons. But, I am always down to hang out casually, grab coffee or dinner, visit local markets or museums, going to a show, crafting together, or just strolling a nature trail.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The modern ac adapter for car boasts a range of features designed to enhance functionality and safety.

**Power Output:** The power output of an ac adapter is measured in watts and determines the types of devices it can power. Most car adapters range from 75 watts to 400 watts. It's essential to choose an adapter with sufficient wattage to handle the combined power requirements of the devices you plan to use simultaneously. For example, a laptop might require 65 watts, while a smartphone charger only needs 10 watts. Exceeding the adapter's rated wattage can lead to overheating and potential damage to the device or the car's electrical system.

**Input Voltage:** Ac adapters for cars are designed to work with the standard 12v dc power found in most vehicles' cigarette lighter sockets or accessory ports. It is critical to ensure that the adapter is compatible with your vehicle's voltage. Some heavy-duty adapters may require direct connection to the car battery, especially those with higher power outputs exceeding 150 watts. These direct connections often involve thicker gauge wires and fuse protection for added safety.

**Output Voltage and Outlets:** The ac output voltage is typically 110v or 120v ac, which is the standard voltage for household appliances in North America. Many adapters also include usb ports for charging devices like smartphones and tablets, providing added versatility. Some models feature multiple ac outlets and usb ports, allowing you to power several devices simultaneously. The quality and type of outlets (e.g., grounded vs. ungrounded) should also be considered for safety and compatibility with your devices.

**Safety Features:** Safety is paramount when using an ac adapter in a car. Look for adapters with built-in protection against overvoltage, undervoltage, overload, overheating, and short circuits. These safety features protect both the adapter and your devices from potential damage. Fuse protection is also crucial, as it prevents excessive current from flowing through the adapter in case of a fault. Some advanced models even include smart charging technology that automatically adjusts the charging current to match the device's requirements, preventing overcharging and prolonging battery life.

**Cooling System:** Ac adapters generate heat during operation, especially at higher wattages. An efficient cooling system is essential to prevent overheating and ensure reliable performance. Many adapters use built-in fans to dissipate heat, while others rely on passive cooling through heat sinks. The effectiveness of the cooling system can significantly impact the adapter's lifespan and performance, particularly in hot environments.

**Portability and Design:** The size and design of the ac adapter are important considerations, especially if you have limited space in your car. Compact and lightweight adapters are easier to store and transport. Some models feature swivel plugs that allow you to adjust the adapter's angle to fit comfortably in your car's cigarette lighter socket. The overall build quality and durability of the adapter should also be considered, as it will likely be subjected to vibrations and temperature fluctuations inside the vehicle.

Key features of the best ac adapters for cars include:
* High power output to handle multiple devices.
* Multiple ac outlets and usb ports for versatility.
* Comprehensive safety features to protect against damage.

Ac adapters for cars provide several practical benefits that enhance convenience and productivity while on the road.

**Enhanced Productivity:** With an ac adapter, you can power your laptop and other work-related devices while traveling, allowing you to stay productive even during long commutes or road trips. This eliminates the need to rely solely on battery power, ensuring that you can work uninterrupted. For example, a sales representative traveling between clients can use an ac adapter to prepare presentations, respond to emails, and manage their schedule without worrying about running out of battery.

**Entertainment on the Go:** Ac adapters enable you to power entertainment devices like gaming consoles, dvd players, and portable tvs, making long journeys more enjoyable for passengers, especially children. This can significantly reduce boredom and keep everyone entertained during road trips. Imagine a family traveling across the country; the kids can play video games or watch movies, keeping them occupied and preventing restlessness.

**Emergency Power:** In emergency situations, an ac adapter can be a lifesaver. It allows you to charge your phone, power a portable radio, or even run a small medical device. This can be particularly useful in remote areas where access to traditional power sources is limited. For example, if your car breaks down in a rural area with no cell service, you can use the adapter to charge your phone and call for help.

**Versatile Charging Options:** Ac adapters with usb ports provide versatile charging options for smartphones, tablets, and other usb-powered devices. This eliminates the need for multiple chargers and keeps your car clutter-free. It also ensures that you can keep your essential devices charged and ready to use at all times. Consider a rideshare driver who relies on their smartphone for navigation and communication; an ac adapter with usb ports allows them to keep their phone charged throughout their shift, ensuring they don't miss any ride requests.

**Cost Efficiency:** By allowing you to power your devices in your car, ac adapters can help you save money on charging costs. Instead of relying on expensive charging stations or paying for power at hotels or airports, you can use your car's battery to power your devices. This can add up to significant savings over time, especially for frequent travelers.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about ac adapters for cars.

**What size (wattage) ac adapter do i need for my car?**
The required wattage depends on the devices you plan to power simultaneously. Add up the wattage requirements of each device and choose an adapter with a slightly higher wattage rating to provide a buffer. For example, if you want to power a 65-watt laptop and a 10-watt smartphone charger, you'll need an adapter with at least 75 watts, but a 100-watt or 150-watt adapter would be a safer choice. Always check the power requirements of your devices before selecting an adapter.

**Is it safe to use an ac adapter in my car all the time?**
While it is generally safe to use an ac adapter in your car, it's essential to use it responsibly. Avoid using high-wattage devices for extended periods, as this can drain your car's battery. It's also crucial to choose an adapter with built-in safety features to protect against overvoltage, overload, and short circuits. If you plan to use the adapter frequently, consider upgrading to a higher-capacity car battery to prevent draining the battery too quickly.

**Will using an ac adapter drain my car's battery?**
Yes, using an ac adapter will drain your car's battery, especially if you're powering high-wattage devices or using the adapter for extended periods while the engine is off. To minimize battery drain, only use the adapter when necessary and avoid leaving it plugged in when not in use. If you plan to use the adapter frequently, consider starting your car periodically to recharge the battery or investing in a portable jump starter to avoid getting stranded.

Below there’s a rough timeline of events:

	•	Five and a half years ago, my daughter was born. Living in a small apartment and with no nearby family to lean on, my sleep quality and duration took a direct hit.
	•	I started relying on coffee and sweets to boost my energy, especially in the morning.
	•	Lack of physical activity combined with a stressful IT job led me to start taking melatonin at night to compensate. Over time, I went from 1mg, then 3mg, and 10mg, as I felt its effects lessen.
	•	A year and a half ago, I introduced diphenhydramine and THC/CBD gummies, which I alternate. After one year, I could tell they became less and less effective on me.
	•	Up to this point, my sleep quality is not great, but I manage an average of about six hours a day. I have to work my way to falling asleep over an hour or so, and then have 4-5 awakenings in the night, which I typically overcome in 15-30 mins.
	•	Ten months ago, in order to improve my activity levels, I started tracking +7k steps a day and lifting weights 4 times a week.
	•	Two months ago, I removed caffeine and reduced sugar in my diet. I put screens away 1-2 hours before bed.
	•	Two weeks ago, my sleep has significantly worsened. Now I wake up 2 hours after sleep onset (start at 9-10 pm) and I cannot go back to sleep until early morning (5-6 am) to get an extra hour, sometimes nothing at all.
	•	I’m now pretty desperate. Through a tele-consultation, I got prescribed 25mg Doxepin. I tried it for a few days, but it makes the whole process even more miserable. Not only cannot I fall back asleep, now I’m groggy and useless for part of the daytime hours. It feels like a step in the wrong direction.
	•	I’m now waiting to get an appointment with a sleep specialist, although this may not be possible until a month from now, and I’m skeptical of addressing this with more meds.

At this point, I’m worried that my history of use (probably abuse) of sleep aids has messed up the natural ability of my body to stay asleep.
Since yesterday, I’ve cut off all sleep aids (other than Valerian tea and a magnesium supplement) in the hope that over time my body will be able to regulate sleep normally again.

I’m wondering if people here have had similar experiences, and whether you’ve (or witnessed folks who have) been able to restore normal sleep without the crutch of increasingly stronger sleep aids.

1kw5pmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheTicker/comments/1kw5pmx/zuckerbergs_bet_on_maga_has_yet_to_bear_fruit/,"Zuckerberg’s Bet on Maga Has Yet to Bear Fruit, While Risks Loom","Bloomberg Businessweek) -- In early February, Mark Zuckerberg boarded his Gulfstream G650 for a trip to Washington, DC—a cross-country route he was flying with newfound frequency. After years on the outs, the chief executive officer of Meta Platforms Inc. had regained something valuable he’d lost: direct access to the president.

Since November, Zuckerberg had already had a string of postelection get-togethers with Donald Trump. He’d made multiple trips to Mar-a-Lago in Florida, and he’d sat in the Capitol Rotunda with other tech executives when the president-elect took the oath of office in January. Meta had also donated $1 million to the inauguration, and Zuckerberg co-hosted a black-tie reception that evening in Trump’s honor. In a sign that he plans to spend more time in Washington, Zuckerberg in March purchased a $23 million mansion just paces from Vice President JD Vance’s residence at the Naval Observatory.

On this particular February visit, Zuckerberg had a short chat with Trump, according to people familiar with the meeting, but his agenda centered on a discussion with Vance. The vice president was headed to Paris for a summit on artificial intelligence, and Zuckerberg wanted him to hammer home to European leaders that their regulators were treating Meta unfairly, making it difficult to roll out AI products.

When Vance spoke in Paris five days later, his speech delivered exactly the sort of message Zuckerberg had had in mind, warning against overregulation in AI and abandoning the Biden administration’s more careful approach to the technology. Vance said he was troubled by reports about governments “considering tightening the screws” on US tech companies, telling his audience that “America cannot and will not accept that, and we think it’s a terrible mistake.”

Map: Mark Zuckerberg's Trump-related travel since the presidential election
Vance’s speech seemed like tangible evidence that Zuckerberg’s clout in DC was on the upswing. Joe Biden’s disdain for Meta was evident well before he assumed office, and once in, he pointed to the company as the source of some of the US’s greatest problems, among them the spread of conspiracy theories, the surge in political polarization and the exploitation of children. He repeatedly called for the repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, a rule shielding internet platforms from legal liability for content posted by their users, which Silicon Valley considers a critical protection. Biden’s appointees to the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice had pursued an aggressive antitrust agenda that included Meta among its targets, and his administration had pushed Meta to control misinformation in ways the company deemed inappropriate.

Unlike Trump and President Barack Obama before him, Biden never met with Zuckerberg personally, and Meta insiders had heard he was known to throw around demeaning nicknames for Zuckerberg in private. (“Little Twerp” and “F---erberg” were among the favorites, according to Biden aides.) A spokesperson for Biden’s office declined to comment for this article.

Zuckerberg had been hinting at a move toward Trump even before the election. He’d described the candidate’s reaction to an assassination attempt in July as “badass,” called him personally on several occasions last summer and bashed the Biden administration in a letter to Congress. Once the election results were in, Zuckerberg sprinted Trumpward. He appointed Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White—a Trump ally—to Meta’s board of directors, elevated Republican strategist Joel Kaplan to chief global affairs officer and rolled back diversity efforts both at his company and his family’s philanthropic organization, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. Meta weakened hate speech policies, broke up its civil-rights team and eliminated the outside fact-checking system that had so infuriated Trump during his first term. The company even paid Trump $25 million to settle a lawsuit he’d filed after it suspended him from Facebook and Instagram, even though insiders viewed the case as an easy win for the company.

The speed and scope of these moves by Zuckerberg have left many onlookers with a sense of whiplash. He declined to be interviewed for this article, but Bloomberg Businessweek spoke with more than 50 people about his approach to politics, including more than 30 current and former Meta employees and a dozen government officials who’ve engaged with Meta during the Obama, Biden and Trump administrations. (Many of them asked for anonymity out of fear of retribution.) What emerges is a portrait of someone who isn’t motivated by a political ideology as much as a finely tuned sense of self-preservation.

“Mark is always going to do what’s best for the business,” says Katie Harbath, a former Republican digital strategist who worked on Facebook’s public policy team from 2011 to 2021. “He is always worried about being out-innovated, and he is always thinking about his own legacy,” she says. For years, Zuckerberg’s vocal and financial support of liberal approaches to immigration reform and diversity initiatives had been driven by the same calculation, Harbath says. When those values were no longer politically expedient, she adds, he shed them easily.

It’s become clear since Trump took office that business leaders will need to overhaul their formula for playing politics. The president’s vindictiveness creates risks for holdouts, and his transactional style leaves open the chance of substantial rewards for those who win him over. Zuckerberg’s bending of the knee stands out as a particularly revealing test case.

Mark Zuckerberg at Donald Trump’s inauguration.
Zuckerberg at Trump’s inauguration.
There are reasons to question how well it’s working out, Vance’s chiding of the Europeans notwithstanding. Trump is still looking for a way to keep key Meta rival TikTok operational in the US, despite widespread suspicion in Congress that its ties to China represent a national security risk. He’s done little to signal support for Section 230, which remains in Congress’ crosshairs. The president’s tariff policies have sparked concerns of a looming recession: When reporting first-quarter earnings, Meta warned that it expects its hardware costs to go up because of Trump trade policies. It also made more than $18 billion in sales from China-based advertisers last year, a revenue stream that remains at risk as negotiations between the countries continue.

The limits of Zuckerberg’s influence were also on display in the weeks before the FTC’s antitrust suit against Meta went to trial in April, when his last-ditch effort to persuade Trump and FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson to settle the case was unsuccessful. Zuckerberg and other executives spent days on the witness stand going over the company’s inner workings in uncomfortable detail, and Meta rested its case on May 21. If the FTC prevails, Meta could be forced to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp, a prospect that would destroy the $1.6 trillion business Zuckerberg has built. The FTC didn’t respond to requests for comment.

At least so far, the actions Zuckerberg has taken to make Meta more Trump-friendly haven’t resulted in much tangible gain. “We haven’t seen evidence one way or another that these changes have benefited Meta,” says Stefan Slowinski, an analyst at BNP Paribas Exane.

None of this should be particularly surprising. Trump has been regularly attacking Zuckerberg and his company for alleged anti-conservative bias for almost a decade. During the 2024 campaign, Trump referred to him as “ZUCKERBUCKS” in a post on Truth Social, claiming without evidence that he might be engaging in election fraud, and suggested he could end up in prison. A coffee-table book published in September and written by Trump also made the threat to imprison Zuckerberg.

If Zuckerberg’s about-face has come off as craven to liberals, the MAGA crowd isn’t necessarily buying it either. “There’s still tremendous distrust,” says Alex Bruesewitz, a digital strategy adviser to Trump, who runs his political social media accounts and who Meta briefed on its Trump-friendly content moderation changes before announcing them. “I don’t know what it will take for our base and our voters to forgive him fully. I don’t know if they will.”

For years the working assumption in Silicon Valley and DC was that tech leaned Democratic. The industry’s young, largely California-based workforce aligned more closely with the party on social issues. Obama was the first president to successfully leverage a digital campaign in his path to the Oval Office, and Democrats were content to take a light-touch approach to internet regulations. Zuckerberg, who was 24 when Obama took office, interacted regularly with the president.

The company’s user base expanded from about 200 million to almost 2 billion during Obama’s administration. The scale made Facebook ever more important, but mistrust began to mount over the company’s approach to privacy and its influence over politics. Then came the 2016 presidential election. Zuckerberg was shocked and confused by Trump’s victory, but said the suggestion that misinformation on Facebook had played a role was “crazy.” Still, the company quickly attempted to mollify concerns about how its platform had become vulnerable to manipulation, developing stronger tools for fact-checking and content moderation. Democrats were unmoved. Trump and other Republicans began attacking the company for what they claimed was anti-conservative censorship. From 2018 to 2024, Zuckerberg was hauled before congressional committees on eight separate occasions to answer questions about Meta’s policies and business.

The company tried its best to make inroads with the first Trump administration. Kaplan, at the time Meta’s vice president of global policy—who’d been deputy chief of staff for President George W. Bush and had briefly considered taking a job in the new administration—worked to build relationships with Trump’s inner circle. At the same time, he sought to convince Zuckerberg that aligning the company with a business-friendly Republican administration and conservative Supreme Court were of vital importance. (Within Meta, this approach to fending off a potential breakup or other existential regulatory threats became known as the “Clarence Thomas strategy,” according to people familiar with the matter.) As the 2020 election approached, Kaplan’s pitch about the benefits of a Republican administration was resonating with Zuckerberg. On the sidelines of a tech conference where he was speaking, Zuckerberg turned to a staffer with a question: “Joel keeps telling me Republicans are better for us than Democrats. They are, right?”

Joel Kaplan walking with Mark Zuckerberg
Kaplan, left, has long argued that Meta’s interests align with Republican political priorities.
From Zuckerberg’s perspective, he’d tried to play it down the middle and gotten punished for it from all sides. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative donated more than $400 million in election-related grants, awarded to 49 states for unobjectionable actions such as helping fund poll workers, voting equipment and face masks for volunteers. But Republicans accused him of trying to sway the election in Biden’s favor, and Zuckerberg also grew frustrated that Democrats didn’t give him much credit for the gesture, according to people familiar with his thinking.

Throughout the election, it was clear Zuckerberg wasn’t winning Biden over. In a campaign Q&A with the New York Times, the Democratic candidate said that he’d “never been a big Zuckerberg fan” and that he saw the CEO as a “real problem.”

Any hope of a fresh start following Biden’s victory was dashed almost immediately. Trump used Facebook to reject the election results and spread florid conspiracy theories. “We knew this would happen. We pleaded with Facebook for over a year to be serious about these problems,” Biden Deputy Communications Director Bill Russo tweeted just days after the election. “They have not. Our democracy is on the line. We need answers.”

The violence on Jan. 6 reinforced the incoming administration’s view that Facebook’s inaction on misinformation had serious consequences. Biden never sought a personal relationship with Zuckerberg after taking office. His staffers, however, were in almost constant communication with the company—and at times with Zuckerberg directly—over misinformation related to the pandemic and the rollout of the first vaccines. Although Facebook announced actions to crack down on misleading content, the White House wasn’t impressed.

In emails and text messages that became public as a part of a Republican-led congressional inquiry into allegations of online censorship, White House officials expressed frustration and outrage about Facebook’s approach to misinformation. “You are hiding the ball,” began the subject line of one email. In the messages, White House officials accused Facebook of giving them the runaround. “Not for nothing, but the last time we did this dance, it ended in an insurrection,” one Biden staffer wrote. In internal messages, company executives complained that its staff members were being harassed.

The feud spilled into public on a swampy Friday afternoon in July 2021, when a reporter yelled a question about Facebook and Covid just as Biden was climbing onto his helicopter for a weekend at Camp David. “They’re killing people,” Biden replied. “I mean it, really. Look, the only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated, and they’re killing people.”

The unexpected comments sent staff in the West Wing and at Facebook into a tizzy. Nick Clegg, who oversaw the company’s policy organization, messaged his colleagues that Biden officials had been “highly cynical and dishonest” about the interactions over Covid misinformation, adding that Facebook had gotten positive feedback from the surgeon general’s office earlier that day, contrary to Biden’s remarks.

Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, then the company’s chief operating officer, mulled going public about the discussions as a way to push back against Biden. Zuckerberg said he suspected Biden’s comments were part of a coordinated pressure campaign. “I also wonder if we should change our model of how we work with the [White House] on this,” he wrote to colleagues, in messages that came out during the congressional inquiry. “If they’re more interested in criticizing us than actually solving the problems, then I’m not sure how it’s helping the cause to engage with them further.”

The president walked back his comment the following week, though he continued to criticize social media companies—and especially Zuckerberg’s—until the final days of his presidency. Zuckerberg retreated from the role of statesman. He changed the name Facebook to Meta in late 2021, a rebrand that reflected a new vision for the company and had the added benefit of distancing it from recent controversies. Then he tasked Clegg with serving as president of global affairs, turning his attention toward the metaverse and AI.

Throughout his struggles with Washington, Zuckerberg couldn’t help but notice that a more satisfying approach was being modeled by another tech CEO: Elon Musk. The two had been rivals for years, and not always in a friendly way. When Musk laid out doomsday scenarios related to AI, Zuckerberg described such talk as “irresponsible”; Musk said in 2023 that Instagram makes people “kind of depressed” and called Zuckerberg a “cuck.” The two men flirted with meeting in a UFC-style cage match, but Musk backed out, citing a back injury.

Several times a year, a Meta marketing team conducts polls measuring public opinion about, among other things, Zuckerberg himself. Past polling has looked at whether he’s seen as “honest,” “mature” or “passionate” and how he measures up against other tech leaders, according to documents viewed by Businessweek. Zuckerberg has regularly been mocked as being robotic or disingenuous, whereas Musk has often been described as a visionary. Zuckerberg has also expressed frustration that Meta’s own polling has previously shown that people considered him less innovative than Musk.

Zuckerberg also watched Musk flout federal regulations, conduct mass firings and act boorishly online, all without suffering serious consequences. After years spent apologizing for missteps and trying to build his own political capital, Zuckerberg grew jealous of how Musk could disregard any and all criticism, according to people who’ve worked with him. He developed what those people have described as “Elon envy.”

Around this time Zuckerberg began to adopt the “masculine energy” popular in corners of the internet that embraced Musk. He got into mixed martial arts, grew his hair out and started wearing gold chains and a T-shirt implicitly comparing himself to a Roman emperor. He appeared on manosphere-friendly podcasts hosted by Joe Rogan and Theo Von. “I don’t apologize anymore,” Zuckerberg deadpanned at a live taping of the tech-focused Acquired podcast in September, prompting laughter from the audience. “We’ve noticed,” responded one of the hosts.

Well-attuned to the aesthetics of the MAGA movement, Bruesewitz, the Trump adviser, took note of Zuckerberg’s “conscious decision to kind of start pivoting,” echoing right-wing talking points. “Maybe he’s had a change of heart,” Bruesewitz told Businessweek before the presidential election. With a newly sympathetic Zuckerberg and Musk at the helm of X, Bruesewitz said the social media environment was shifting to look less like it did in 2020 and more like the Trump-friendly landscape of 2016.

Since Trump’s election, Meta has walked back the approach it took for much of the previous eight years. In addition to the laundry list of policy changes in January, the company moved its trust and safety teams to Texas as a sop to conservatives who complain about Californians’ left-wing bias. (Employees say this gesture was meaningless, given that many of those staffers were already located in the state.) Zuckerberg also replaced Meta’s fact-checking program with a crowdsourcing feature similar to the one Musk uses on X.

Meta has often copied competitors’ products but rarely acknowledges it’s doing so at the time. In this case, Zuckerberg openly credited Musk and has used X’s open-source algorithm as the basis of its fact-checking replacement. The two have spoken privately on multiple occasions since the election, according to people familiar with the situation.

Zuckerberg has always held enough voting power within his company to take it wherever he chooses. But Meta insiders say he was more willing in the past to consider the counsel of other executives and board members. Key advisers who once had his ear, including Sandberg and Elliot Schrage, the former global communications and policy chief, have long since departed. Well-respected board members Jeff Zients, Ken Chenault, Erskine Bowles and Reed Hastings, known for their ties to the Democratic Party and experience working with governments around the world, have also moved on.

Privately, colleagues say changes including eliminating fact-checking and loosening content rules reflect a more authentic version of Zuckerberg’s beliefs. Still, many people who’ve worked with him over the years have found themselves questioning whether his values still align with their own—or if they ever truly did. “I thought tech was progressive,” says Kelly Stonelake, former director of product marketing in Meta’s virtual reality unit, who, after 15 years with the company, is suing Meta for sexual harassment and discrimination. (Meta has asked a federal court to dismiss the lawsuit.) “But we were really just good at performing inclusion and progressivism because that was a means to an end.”

There are signs of flagging morale. Some current employees do “wellness checks” with each other at the beginning of meetings. Others have created secret book clubs to discuss Careless People, the bestselling memoir by Sarah Wynn-Williams, Meta’s former director of public policy. The company saw the book, which includes unflattering personal portrayals of Zuckerberg and his top deputies as well as a sharp critique of its dealings with foreign governments, as a violation of a non-disparagement agreement. It has taken Wynn-Williams to arbitration to keep her from promoting it. (Meta “maintains a gag order to silence Ms. Wynn-Williams for speaking the truth,” says Ravi Naik, a lawyer representing her, adding that the company is pursuing a $50,000 penalty for each violation.)

Some evidence remains of Meta’s continued aspirations to be a conscientious workplace, such as the posters pinned around its campus that preach things like, “Nothing at Facebook is someone else’s problem.” But Meta’s leadership has sent signals to its staff that protests aren’t going to fly this time around. When an employee voiced concerns about Meta’s new direction on an internal workplace tool earlier this year, Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth replied that employees who disagreed with the changes could either leave or get on board.

There are reasons even for critics to stick around. Meta remains a lucrative place to work—its share price is up more than 600% since its 2022 lows—at a time when predictions of an economic downturn have sparked concerns about job security. In January, Meta said it would fire about 3,600 employees who were publicly labeled low performers, a move some employees saw as a way to quash ideological dissent. Additional layoffs have followed. (A Meta spokesperson denies the idea that layoffs were intended to suppress internal critics.)

The internal tension was on display among Meta’s highest ranks when the company flew its senior leaders to Menlo Park, California, for annual planning meetings in January. Included on the itinerary was a Q&A with Zuckerberg, attended solely by employees who carry the title of vice president or above.

Zuckerberg had just announced the policy changes, and in a large auditorium on campus known as the Museum, executives unhappy with the company’s new direction quizzed him about his decisions to change directions on diversity, equity and inclusion as well as content moderation, according to people familiar with the event. Eva Chen, who oversees fashion partnerships at Meta, seemed frustrated by Zuckerberg’s comments earlier that month on Rogan’s podcast, when he talked about corporate America needing more “masculine energy.” She asked Zuckerberg for his definition of masculine energy in front of the group.

Zuckerberg attempted to clarify his comments, acknowledging that “masculine” may have been a poor choice of words. But he didn’t take them back. US businesses needed to be more competitive and aggressive, he said. As to the other questions, Zuckerberg was unapologetic. He’d made his decisions and wasn’t interested in relitigating them.

Over the past decade, many powerful people have tried to adapt to Trump’s whims and gotten burned. The president has mocked Zuckerberg on multiple occasions for coming to the White House during his first term to “kiss my ass,” and, since returning to office, he hasn’t shown him the affection that he’s demonstrated for Musk. But that doesn’t mean Trump dislikes the pandering. When asked to comment for this article, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly sent an email saying Trump “takes meetings with many CEOs who are eager to participate in the Trump economy.”

Investors see potential upside as well, says Shweta Khajuria, an analyst for Wolfe Research LLC. Changing its policies to align with Trump’s doesn’t undercut the company’s financial performance, she says, and reduces the chance it will be hit with new regulations. If Democrats take the White House or Congress in the future, she predicts Zuckerberg will “just adjust to work with that administration too.”

Others see more risk to Meta if the political winds shift. For all the enviable access Musk secured with his support for Trump, his association with the administration has done real damage to his popularity—and to Tesla’s sales. Political strategists inside and outside Meta say there’s a feeling that Zuckerberg, too, may have “overcorrected” toward Trump; Zuckerberg himself was aware of how his changes to company policies could alienate Democrats even as he was making them. He’s already directed executives to map out ways to secure their support in the future, according to people familiar with the efforts.

But Meta may find it hard to pivot, given the real damage that progressives see coming from the company’s shifting policies. Advocacy groups are already tracking increases in hate speech and harassment against minority groups, women and trans people. The Center for Countering Digital Hate said in a February report that hundreds of millions of posts each year that would have previously been deemed harmful will likely stay up on the platform—a finding that Meta has said is based on “flawed” methodology.

Alejandra Caraballo, a clinical instructor at Harvard Law School who’s spent years engaging with Meta on its content policies, says such online abuse can translate into real-world harm. “What do you think is going to happen when you greenlight a policy that allows people to call LGBTQ people mentally ill, when you greenlight slurs against trans people?” she asks, adding she is not speaking for Harvard. “It’s very clear there’s essentially a quid pro quo with Mark Zuckerberg: If that’s the decision they have to make, they’ll sacrifice trans people, they’ll sacrifice women, they’ll sacrifice minority groups.”

Even Meta’s own Oversight Board—an independent entity it formed to weigh in on complicated content moderation decisions—said in late April that the changes were “announced hastily, in a departure from regular procedure, with no public information shared as to what, if any, prior human rights due diligence the company performed.” It has advised the company to assess and report the potential harm of its new policies. Meta said it would respond to the recommendation within 60 days.

Given all this, Zuckerberg would have a significant challenge presenting himself as a reliable actor if Democrats return to power. The worst-case scenario is that he ends up with enemies on all sides. This possibility was on display on April 9, when Wynn-Williams testified before Congress. Republican Senator Josh Hawley, a Trump ally who’s been among the most outspoken critics of Silicon Valley from the right, noted that Zuckerberg’s new political positioning conveniently aligns with the MAGA movement. “Do you buy this latest reinvention?” he asked Wynn-Williams.

She began her answer by asking rhetorically whether securing a gag order to keep her from discussing her book publicly was the action of someone who believed in free speech. “This is a man who wears many different costumes,” she continued. “Now his new costume is MMA-fighting or whatever, free speech—we don’t know what the next costume is going to be, but it will be something different.

“It’s whatever gets him closest to power,” she said",1,1748293965.0,TheTicker,0,1.0,False

I'm a 36-year-old woman who recently moved back to the Houston area, and I'm hoping to meet people with similar interests to build some meaningful friendships. I'm open to friends of any gender, but just to be clear, I’m happily in a relationship and only seeking platonic connections.

I'm not really into drinking or the bar/club scene anymore, so I’m a bit out of my element when it comes to meeting new people these days. I also have social anxiety, which makes it tough to initiate conversations (especially with strangers), but I’m kind, genuine, and always happy to connect once I feel comfortable.

A little about me and what I’m into:

I love reading, art (drawing & painting), photography (though I don’t currently own a camera), and DIY projects. I like walking on nature trails, gardening, city biking (I ride a road bike), thrifting, traveling, cooking and baking. My favorite movie genre is horror (but I do watch others). I like collecting and admiring oddities/curiosities, and specimens. Music is also a huge passion—especially punk, metal, goth, garage, post-punk, etc. I love going to shows and collecting records and tapes. I’m far left on the political spectrum.

Due to chronic health conditions, I do have some physical limitations, so I’m not looking for a gym buddy or to train for marathons. But, I am always down to hang out casually, grab coffee or dinner, visit local markets or museums, going to a show, crafting together, or just strolling a nature trail.

I'd like to start with messaging, graduate to texting, and then hopefully make plans to hang out in person once we're both comfortable.",1,1748293830.0,Houston_Meet_Up,0,1.0,False

It's possible even with the Steam version of the game:

*First, we will copy the game itself.*  
1. Copy your installation of Rimworld somewhere (for example: C:\Games\OldRimworld)  

*Now, we are going to copy the mods from steam workshop the the local mods folder, so update to the mods in the steam workshop will not affect your installation.*  
1. Search the folder where steam host your mods usually C:\program files\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\294100.  
2. Copy all the folders inside into the Mods folder where you copied Rimworld (here: C:\Games\OldRimworld\mods).  
3. Depending the number of mods you subscribed, go walk outside, come back, take a nap and after take a cup of tea  or coffee. In brief, wait until this is done.  

*then we copy the configuration from the main game to your frozen installation, so you can continue to play the actual game without affecting your frozen installation.*  
4. Create a folder named ""Config"" inside the Copied Rimworld (here: C:\Games\OldRimworld\Config)  
5. Go to the folder where Rimworld store config files:  
	- Either by using windows key: `WIN + R` then inside the box, enter `%userprofile%\AppData\LocalLow\Ludeon Studios\RimWorld by Ludeon Studios` then press ok  
	- Or inside the game, go in the options > General and press the ""Log File Folder"" button.  
6. Copy all the files inside the Config folder of your copied installation (here: C:\Games\OldRimworld\Config)  

7. To Unlink your frozen installation form the steam workshop (or you installation will not appreciate the many duplicate mods from the local folder and the steamworkshop ones), just rename the app_id.txt from your frozen installation to something else (Like app_id.txt.old).   
8. And to tell rimworld to use the config folder from inside the game folder, create a shortcut with:  
	- Start in: You game folder (Here: C:\Games\OldRimworld)  
	- Target: You game Executable (Here: C:\Games\OldRimworld\RimWorldWin64.exe)  -savedatafolder=Config

It was hard to find a place where I could try out the machines I was considering.   

Most place like furniture shop had clueless sellers that had to google most of my questions, and they refused that I try the milk-based brevages (I assume they dont want the hassle to do the milk cleaning maintenance).

Other were resellers of a single brand which mean you cant compare directly, not to mention they will be heavily biased that you buy their machine.

But I found the perfect place, a specialized coffee shop having all the model on the display with a guy not paid on commission helping me out.

I love milk-based beverage so I used the cappucino on all machines to make my decision. 

Here's the machine I was considering.

-Jura Z10

-KitchenAid KF8

-Delhongi Elleta Explore


I went in the shop being almost convinced that I would leave choosing the KF8.   Like many I was given the insider pass and in my mind, there was no way the difference would be so huge compared to the other options that I would pay betwee 50% to 200% more.

Boy was I wrong.  With all 3 cups in my hand, using the same beans, the same temperature, the same intensity  and the same quantity, the difference was night and day.

I saw alot people saying the Z10 was above and beyond the alternatives and I was  trying so hard to discard that as zealotry from espresso snobs (which I dont consider myself) but they were totally right.

The Z10 came out on top by far, both in taste and texture. I would literally go back to ""wash my mouth"" with the Jura cup after trying the others

If I wasnt in a financial situation to afford the Z10, I would of went with the Delonghi Eletta Explora. It was a very decent cappucino.

The KF8 was dead last, both in taste of the extration, and milk quality. Even with the insider discount, I would of taken the Delhongi instead.

In the end dont take anything I wrote to finalize your decision beside one thing, find a place that you can try both cup at the same time and make your own decision.

Hi. I’m F23, from CDO. I met a guy on tinder. We decided to meet up, the first invite was for coffee and then murag hesitant man sya so abi nako dili madayon. Then fast forward, we decided to meet that same night. Pero lahi na, mag hookup nami. Mag check-in na. 

So nag book ko og ride going to Iponan and I’m from uptown ha. I don’t mind naman since he’s the one who’s going to pay plus I really wanna meet him. So I arrived and then he was so tall, like 6 flat or 6’1 ata. And he was very decent, he wasn’t touchy and all. He was friendly, dili flirty. Which tbh, I liked. So instead na diri mi mag grab og taxi pa check-in sa kauswagan, he asked if I wanted to grab some coffee first kay giduka sab daw sya. So I said yes, I mean dili rman jud hookup sab ang akong main nga gina think that night, I also wanted a good talk actually. So niadto mig HiFi Cafe sa Opol. Nag order mi and then nag decide mi na sa 2nd floor mag stay.

All throughout, grabe among talk. Na nalimot nami sa time and among agenda nga mag check-in. We talked about our Highschool era. Among ka jejemon sauna, like unsa ang mga mainstream before. It was honestly a good talk, like I had so much fun na I was able to clear my head from all the stress going on at school and personal life. Pag check nako sa phone, almost 4 am na. So I asked him na mag baklay nami kay walay taxi gasulod didto na area.

So nag baklay mi and we continued to talk, he even shared a series na currently gina watch niya. So pag abot namo sa hi-way, nag ask sya if unsay plan so I told him na syay bahala. So he decided na mag go home nami kay pa morning najud and mag meet nalang mi later for coffee nsab pero sa downtown na. Which is na offer nya before we decided to go for hookup. Honestly, I was so excited. Kay that would mean na mag talk nsab mi, mag chika nsab. Nawala njud sakong mind ang plan na mag hookup mi.

So he gave me money ky pang bayad sa akong transpo, wala man koy change so I told him na later nalang pag meet namo again to which he agreed. Niana pako na “Ikaw if mag meet ta later” to which he replied na “nganong if man? mag meet man jud ta again” so I really got my hopes up.

So nag book nako and niabot na ang rider and then I went home. Last message I received from him was “jgh”, a few minutes earlier lang. Nag reply ko and then that was it. Wala na sya ever nag message. 

It’s been 3 days now and I wonder na basin wala ko nakapasar sa vibe check nya? Idk. I just feel sad about it kay ganahan ko sa iyang company. I thought na we would be friends. Pero i guess we didn’t feel the same way ay.

Which have happened to be the best years of my life. We've had multiple mild arguements throughout our time together but not one quiet this heated. Recently we got into a very big arguement which resulted in him leaving our home and staying with my mother-in law and not speaking to me. After around a week of ignoring all my calls and messages he followed up with a paragraph, basically explaining that he feels we need time away from eachother. Which i did not argue with

Its important to mention that I have done things in my past that have involved multiple exs, but have ultimately turned my life around. On the 2 week mark of me and Liam's break I bumped into my 29M ex that I had thankfully ended on good terms with in one of my towns local coffee shops. We sat and chat catching up for a while before he invited me out for dinner the following days evening. I reluctantly agreed. While we were out for a ""friendly"" dinner we had far too many drinks and started flirting with eachother subtly, I then invited him back to my place though deep down I knew it was wrong. One thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together.

During The following 3 weeks after my one night stand, I was experiencing alot of nausea and fatigue and Liam still had not responded to any of the texts I sent him after the paragraph he sent me. My mother who recently came to stay with me at the time noticed my shift in mood throughtout the few weeks after my outing with my ex and recommended I take a pregnancy test. After getting the results back i discovered i was pregnant. My mother was overjoyed until i explained to her that the baby was most likely not Liams. She told me that I have to come clean about being unfaithful to him however i recieved insight from some of my very close friends whom have explained that itd be better to have the baby and raise it as Liams

I havent told my ex yet and I feel so disgusted with myself for letting such a thing happen. I really do love Liam and have realised i dont feel anything besides lust towards my ex. I am extremely torn between whether I should be truthful with my husband or keep this a secret from him. Do i come clean?

Like girl..  you have no kids what gives you the right to give me kid advice..? 

Like on the weekend we were supposed to meet up for coffee and I told her prior to that I’m unwell and I’d let her know how I go, roll on Wednesday I tell her I’m not well to meet up Friday and she goes “rest up and drink fluids, have some vitamin C which is found in Oranges or Kiwi..” (in my mind)… like yeah I know all this.. 


But I’m polite, I don’t say anything but it’s really annoying me now! 

I have noticed she does have narc traits and it’s her ego talking but she also has I think ADHD. (Hard to get a word in, doesn’t listen & is dismissive).

I have other friends that are more aware and ask first, would you like some advice and it’s nice and refreshing and I’m like yes, I’m all ears! 😌🥰😊 I can accept that.

I don't know what to make out of this call. The candidate profile in their ATS still says applied.

I am going into this call with a non-interview mindset.

By 3pm David was starting to get really hungry. He hadn’t eaten for more than fifteen hours and he had been working hard. He still had the main bedroom’s floor boards to polish but he felt he needed to eat something as he was starting to feel faint. He descended the stairs and found Joe and Lori watching a film. Lori’s legs were resting over Joe’s.

“Ummmmm…sorry to interrupt, would it be okay if I had some lunch?” David asked.

“Yeah, no problem, little worker bee. I left your lunch in the cupboard next to the sink.” Lori paused the film as she spoke to him. She then looked at her watch. “So you were going to get a twenty minute break but because you were lazy enough earlier to think you’d earnt an extra break, we are deducting six minutes. So you have fourteen minutes before I want you back to work. Understood?”

“Yes Lori” David said

“Oh my god, like seriously, what happened to you dude?” Joe asked with a mixture of amusement, disbelief and concern, “Like, I just can’t imagine letting someone treat me like this.”

“Oh sweetie, you and David are built very differently.” Lori stroke Joe’s chest.

“You can say that again.” Joe snorted as he shook his head. “Emily must be quite something if you go through all of this.”

“She really is.” David replied.

“Anyway, enough pining wimp! I’ve started my timer so you have about thirteen and a half minutes now.” Lori restarted the film, “And believe me, you do not want to know what the consequences of your lunch break over-running would be!”

“Yes Lori” David ran to the kitchen consumed with shame and embarrassment. “What the hell must Joe think of him” he thought. He opened the cupboard and found a cheese sandwich. It was dry, cheap and boring. But he ate it with such fervour, as if it was the best meal he’d had in years. Unfortunately he was still hungry when he finished. So he returned to the lounge and pleaded with Lori to be allowed something else.

“You’re still hungry?” Lori asked.

“Ummmm…yes I am.”

“You didn’t appreciate the cheese sandwich that I lovingly made?” Joe smirked at the spectacle of David having to beg for more food.

“No no, I did, I promise I did. I just. I haven’t eaten anything since 5.30 this morning and I…I could really do with something else.”

“Oh go on then, there’s some ravioli in the fridge, you’ll just have to boil it and that should be fine.” Lori returned her attention to the film as David rushed back to the kitchen. He boiled the water, heated up the ravioli, drained the boiling water and was just about to take a bite when he heard Lori’s phone alarm in the next room.

“BREAK TIME’S OVER WIMP!” Lori yelled from the lounge. David’s shoulders slumped as he had to leave the ravioli untouched as he trudged up the stairs.

“Shouldn’t have sat down for that unauthorised break should you loser?” Lori laughed as she watched him ascend the stairs.

David’s hunger started to dissipate as he got back to work and before long he had finished polishing the floor in the main bedroom. The clock showed the time was 4pm and he decided it would be a good idea to head to the shop and return the excess paint. He did not like the idea of the shop closing before he got there and then being in trouble with Lori, and by extension probably in trouble with Emily too.

Fortunately the store was not far away, David parked up his car and headed inside towards customer services.

“Hi…errrrrr…I’d like to return this paint that I didn’t end up using.” David lifted the half full tin onto the counter.

“Oh yeah, no problem.” The store clerk took the tin from him with a smile.

“I…I…was told that I could get a refund for the leftover paint.”

“Okay… do you have the receipt?”

“Errrrr….no” David replied, irritated that he hadn’t asked Lori for this. He knew she was going to be pissed if he didn’t get her money back.

“Don’t worry, my dude!” The store clerk smiled again, “When did you buy the paint? I’ll see if we have a record of the transaction.” He started to log onto his computer.

“Well actually it wasn’t me…I mean. I didn’t buy the paint.” David started to stumble over his words. “It was my wife’s friend.”

“Your wife’s friend?” The store clerk raised an eyebrow.

“Yeah…” David blushed, he was sure that his story sounded weird. He was sure that this guy would see straight through him. Why hadn’t he just said his wife had bought the paint. “His wife’s friend”…he felt little beads of sweat form on his forehead.

“That’s nice of you to help out your wife’s friend” The clerk continued, “I bet your wife will be pretty pleased with you.” He gave a little suggestive wink, David just laughed along. “I’m sorry though dude, without a receipt I need the person who actually bought the paint to be here, to issue the re-imbursement.”

“Really? Is there nothing you can do?” David pleaded.            

“Sorry, my hands are tied.”

“It’s just, she wont be happy. She’s quite busy at the moment.”

“There’s nothing I can do.” By now his friendly smile had started to fade.

“I’ll give her a ring.” David took out his phone and gave Lori a call. She didn’t pick up the first two times he called her, but she did on the third time.

“What?” She sounded out of breath.

“Ummmmm…Hi Lori, I’m trying to get the refund for the paint but they say I need the receipt.” David explained.

“Oh for fuck’s sake, I’m busy right now.” David could hear kissing noises in the background accompanied by Joe’s deep voice.

“I’m sorry, I just don’t know what to do.” David was starting to lose confidence.

“Look David…oh fuck!” Lori was clearly getting distracted by whatever Joe was doing, “Baby, hang on, I need to talk to this little fuck up!” David was amazed how differently Lori spoke to Joe compared to how she spoke to him, “Look, Emily gave you to me for the day. Your only purpose is to be useful to me. So just get my money for the excess paint. I don’t know what happened to the receipt. I don’t care what you have to do, just get the money!” She hung up on him and with shoulders slumped and a heavy heart David turned back and approached the store clerk. While he had been on the phone two other people had joined the queue so David patiently waited his turn.

“I’m really sorry, she doesn’t have the receipt and she can’t come down right now.” David said.

“Look, buddy, I have told you what I need. I either need the receipt or the person who bought the paint. Can she come down another time?”

“I don’t know, she’s a very busy person.”

“Busy all the time?” He looked sceptical, “And what are you? Her assistant or something?” He smiled again, but this time with a bit more mockery behind it.

“No, I just. My wife just…she…she just…it’s kind of like a bet thing…I lost the bet and my wife said that I should help her friend for the day.”

“Right…” The clerk rolled his eyes, “Look, as I said before, my hands are tied.”

“Please…I really need the refund!” David was becoming more desperate.

“Buddy, its like fifteen bucks, its not that big a deal. But if she really wants her refund your wife’s friend needs to come down here.”

David turned and left the store. He was nervous at the prospect of returning to Lori’s house. She had sounded very clear on the phone “I don’t care what you have to do, just get the money.” He spied an ATM on the corner of the street and debated whether to go and get some money out and say he had got the money for the paint. Emily controlled their finances and he thought there was a good chance that she would notice if he withdrew 15 bucks. But what else could he do? Go back to Lori and face her wrath or potentially face questions from Emily about why he needed 15 dollars. Maybe Emily would understand…maybe she would even be happy that David went out of his way to get Lori what she wanted. He decided to get the money.

On his return to Lori’s he found the lounge and kitchen empty but the main bedroom door was closed. He started cleaning the windows, inside and out. But he left the bedroom windows, he figured he would start on those when the two lovebirds emerged. The downstairs windows were fine but for the upstairs windows he needed a ladder for the outside parts. David had never been comfortable with heights and he had to take a few deep breaths to steel himself prior to climbing the ladder and cleaning the windows. Every little shake of the ladder, every slight tremor, or imagined tremor caused a fluttering of his heart and made him grab onto the wall for safety.

It didn’t help that loud, heavy thumping started coming from the main bedroom. Accompanied by feminine cries and masculine grunting. David assumed that this was round two for the lovebirds and he admired Joe’s stamina. But his thoughts were mostly on his safety as their fucking seemed to shake the walls of the house and consequently David’s ladder. David scrunched up his eyes, took five deep breaths to try to focus his mind. “You’ll be okay! You’ll be okay!” He kept repeating to himself but the thumping only seemed to grow in intensity. “Fuck! Yes! Oh my god Yes!” David concentrated as best he could, washed the windows, dried them and then returned to the ground, pleased beyond belief to be back on solid ground.

David left the final window for later and he went to clean out the shed. It was dusty, wet, cramped and overflowing with garbage. But within a couple of hours David was pretty pleased with how much better it looked. He returned to the house and found Lori and Joe in pyjamas watching TV. They were eating takeaway pizza. David thought better of asking if there was any for him. He could guess the answer to that question, he thought ruefully.

“Did you get my money?” Lori called out to him without looking away from the TV.

“Yes Lori” David placed the fifteen dollars he had got from the ATM onto the coffee table in front of her.

“Good boy!” Lori grinned as she pocketed the cash. “You almost done?” She asked, looking at the clock which now showed 8.30pm.

“I just have to clean the bedroom window and then I think I’m done Lori.”

""Well while you're up there you may as well put new sheets on the bed. Me and my insatiable tiger here made a bit of a mess."" She leaned over put her arm round Joe's next and planted a deep and intense kiss on his lips.

""Yes Lori"" David sighed, bringing further laughter from the two lovers. As he ascended the stairs he could hear Joe's loud comment of ""I just can't believe this loser!"" followed by Lori’s laughter. 

David changed the sheets so that Lori's bed looked brand new. He picked up the discarded clothes around the room and allowed a bit of air in through the window to enable the smell of sex to dissipate.

He finally got to cleaning the last of the windows and by the time he was finished the sun was far over the horizon and it was dark out.

David was exhausted driving home. Exhausted and starving. He finally arrived home at 11pm and found a note on the kitchen table, ""don't wake me when you get in. Just sleep on the couch tonight.""

With a sigh, David made himself a sandwich, as quietly as he could so as not to wake his wife. After eating he grabbed the blanket and laid down on the couch to rest. ""Alone again"" he thought ruefully.",6,1748292835.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

I’m a 5’4” female and was a bit worried about its size and weight (being there’s hardly any reviews out there for folks my size… hence, me writing this one) but it’s manageable. 
When seated, I can’t put my feet down totally flat, but I’ve got more than enough ground contact to be comfortable. 
It IS heavy… but it’s actually nice because it feels stable on the road and through the wind. We have lots of wind. I went with the hardtail to save myself 10lbs. I’d definitely have trouble loading it into a car or onto a bike rack by myself, though. 
I was hoping for a softer seat… if anyone here has an aftermarket seat, could you tell me if it’s more comfortable? 
My tire did go flat after my first ride… which was a real f’ing bummer. Something happened with the stem that caused the tube to collapse, hoping Ride1up will warranty this… but my local mobile bike mechanic got me fixed up. He also helped me align the front wheel and brake caliper as I had some intermittent rubbing. He noted that it was particularly tricky to do so.
Overall though, I’m stoked! Errands just became fun! The storage cage fit my gallon of OJ, box of triscuits, and pound of coffee with some room to spare.

1. When did you start applying if you graduate at the end of Spring? (I ask this because the internship I have in Summer, I had applied for it \~7 months in advance) 
2. My university has a rule that the final semester should be on - campus. What are my odds of getting a return offer, if there is a semester long break in between
3. Please drop any precious tips or hacks that stood out to you guys in particular, mostly stuff or hacks about referrals, how you managed to increase the number of applications in a day, stuff about cold emails or coffee chats etc.

1kw554z,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1kw554z/uncover_if_teehay_th04_refrigerator_water_filter/,Uncover if TEEHAY TH-04 Refrigerator Water Filter Review Matches Its Premium Claims,"The TEEHAY TH-04 might not be the most glamorous item on the market, but refrigerator water filters don’t really need to be dazzling to do their job. I’ve been using the WF3CB Water Filter Replacement—designed as a compatible replacement for Frigidaire’s PureSource 3 filters—and it offers an interesting mix of highs and lows. When you crack open a box that touts compatibility with models like 706465, 242069601, and 242086201, you’re tempted to imagine this will be a plug-and-play miracle. Let’s break it all down to see how this filter performs.

**Easy Installation Experience**

Getting the filter installed was a breeze, and I appreciate how the twist-and-lock design eliminates the need for special tools. The last thing anyone wants when replacing a water filter is a full-scale DIY project. The TEEHAY TH-04 slides into place in seconds, and there’s no dripping or mess. I even tried removing and re-installing the filter just to ensure the ease of use wasn’t a fluke—still easy as pie. I’d generally place ease of installation among the most important features of a refrigerator filter, and this one delivers.

[Grab TEEHAY TH-04 at the best price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0dnm37z4c/)

**Water Quality and Performance**

This water filter promises a significant reduction in contaminants like lead and chlorine taste, which is essential for anyone who’s serious about their drinking water. Testing the water both before and after installation revealed a noticeable difference in taste—cleaner, crisper, and with zero odd flavors or smells. It's worth noting that this filter is NSF/ANSI 42 & 372 certified, meaning you can drink with confidence knowing the materials and filtration quality meet solid safety standards. Whether you’re filling water bottles for the gym or brewing your morning coffee, the improved water quality is palpable.

**Positives**

- Certified to reduce 99% of lead and chlorine.  
- Hassle-free, tool-free installation.  
- Compatible with various Frigidaire models.  

**Build and Materials**

One thing I pay close attention to is whether a filter feels like it’s made to last. The TEEHAY TH-04 is built from BPA-free, food-grade materials and feels sturdy enough for its purpose. However, given the fact this is a disposable product meant to last for six months or 200 gallons, durability beyond that time frame is irrelevant. Nonetheless, these premium materials combined with certification standards ensure no “cheap plastic” mood creeps into your bottle of iced tea.

**Drawbacks**

- Lacks advanced contaminant indicators or filtering metrics.  
- Only lasts six months, which may feel short for heavy water users.  

**Does It Live Up to Its Claims?**

The product description boasts “leak-free” operation, and I was initially skeptical of this claim. Some replacement filters, in my past experience, have fallen short of this promise, leading to minor puddles at the bottom of my fridge. Not this one though! Not a single drop showed up during weeks of use. The 200-gallon capacity is par for the course, but I occasionally feel this falls short compared to competitors offering options capable of more extended use between replacements.

**Product Alternatives**

Stacked against its competitors, like the EveryDrop by Whirlpool or Samsung’s OEM filters, the TEEHAY TH-04 is more affordable while still providing professional-grade filtration. EveryDrop does outperform slightly in contaminant elimination, especially with heavy metals, but it’s priced higher. Samsung's filters, on the other hand, feel like overkill if you don’t need ultraspecialized filtering capabilities. Sticking to a balance of convenience, affordability, and quality keeps TEEHAY competitive, particularly when budget matters but performance cannot be compromised.

**Cost Efficiency**

This filter offers excellent bang for the buck considering it provides top-notch functionality without requiring you to buy a heavily branded filter from the refrigerator manufacturer. While there are cheaper aftermarket options on the market, they often come with the risk of poor fit—or worse—potentially hazardous materials. Spending a little extra on the TEEHAY TH-04 still keeps you within a reasonable financial zone while providing certified safety and functionality.

Hi everyone,  
I could really use some advice on whether I should stay in my current job or move on.

I recently started working part-time (30h/week) as a **receptionist in a boutique hotel**. I genuinely like the team and the environment, and I’ve already learned a lot. The issue is… the job is turning out to be **far more than reception work**.

Here’s a quick rundown of what I do:

* Standard reception tasks: check-ins, check-outs, bookings (Booking.com, Expedia), emails, assigning rooms, handling email communication, farewell messages, invoicing, and trying to sell tours for commission, schegualing guest transfers, calling maintenance, etc..
* Housekeeping support: preparing cleaning schedules, reporting issues, folding towels, replenishing supplies, inspecting rooms
* Preparing and serving breakfast (replacing items on the buffet, cleaning tables, taking special orders, etc.)
* Bar service: making drinks, toasts, charcuterie boards, etc. during the afternoon shift
* Managing the pool, coffee machines, heating systems, and more…

To make things harder, my **commute takes between 2 to 3 hours daily** due to unreliable public transport, and I often return home too exhausted to function — and the busy summer season hasn’t even started.

Salary-wise, I earn about **€700/month net** plus food vouchers, which is okay for a part-time first job — but not amazing for the level of responsibility and multitasking expected.

I feel like I’m doing the job of **receptionist, café/bar staff, and operations assistant all at once**. I’m still in my **trial period**, but I’ve already been trained on everything, have full access to all systems, and even have next month’s schedule.

I’m thinking of leaving now, before the summer gets hectic — but I also feel guilty. My manager invested time in me, and I don't want to be “just another person who quits.” I was thinking of handing over a small manual with everything I’ve learned as a goodwill gesture, and saying I accepted another opportunity closer to home (even if it’s just an excuse).

What would you do in my situation? Should i give it more time and actually see if i can handle the busier times ahead?  
Is it unreasonable to feel this way in hospitality? Or is it fair to say this just isn’t what I signed up for?

For some aditional context, my goal is to work in the art industry, but i need some work while i buit my porfolio and skills...(i also work freelance in all kinds of events- weddings, concerts tiketc offinces...) and i gonna finish my degree next week - same time as my trial period ends at this new job.

The truth? I'm already intrigued. The way you talk... like you know you'll be a little dangerous for my peace of mind? You're right. But I'll love every second of it.


I don't know the sound of your laugh, the rhythm of your voice, or the way your eyes light up when you're lost in something you love. But I think about you more often than I care to admit.


You're a mystery I'm aching to unfold, page by page, day by day. I imagine the way your hand might fit in mine, the way our conversations might stretch into the early morning hours, effortless and infinite. I wonder what it will feel like the first time our paths cross, if you'll smile and I'll know, deep in my bones, that it was always meant to be you.


I'm not looking for perfection. I'm looking for something real. Someone who will see the mess and the beauty in me and choose to stay anyway. Someone I can build a quiet, steady kind of magic with—no fireworks needed, just a love that feels like home.


You've been dancing around the edges of my imagination, and let me tell you, the version of you in my mind? She's got an alluring smile, a laugh that makes my day better, and a way of looking at me like she knows all my secrets... and likes them anyway.


I want to learn all your quirks, your go-to coffee order, the way your voice changes when you talk about something you're passionate about. I want to tease you, challenge you, make you laugh until you can't breathe—and then kiss you quiet.


Let's skip the part where I pretend to be subtle. I think about the tension that'll hang between us when we first meet. You'll act like you're unimpressed, but your eyes will say otherwise. And I'll smile, that slow, knowing kind of smile, because I'll already know: you're the one l've been waiting for. 

I like a woman who knows what she wants. Even more, I like a woman who can keep up. So when we finally meet—don’t be shy. Bring that fire. Look at me like you’ve already undressed me in your thoughts (you have, haven’t you?). Touch me like you’ve been waiting your whole life. And talk to me like no one else exists.


I’m not looking for ordinary. I want wild nights and soft mornings. I want banter that turns into kisses, and kisses that leave us breathless. I want to make you feel seen, wanted, and wrecked in the best way. You deserve someone who never stops choosing you. Every damn day. 

Just one thing, darling: when you fall—and you will fall—make sure it’s deep. I don’t do halfway. I want all of you, or nothing at all.

Until then, I’m working on becoming someone worthy of you. Someone who won’t just love you, but will cherish you. Who will protect your heart like it’s a fragile miracle. Because that’s what I believe love should be—a sanctuary, not a battlefield.


So take your time, love. But not too much time—l'm getting a little impatient over here lol.


Wherever you are, I hope you're safe and I hope you're smiling. I'll be here when the timing is right.


To the woman who's already got my attention,

# Ethiopia and Italy: A Multifaceted Strategic Partnership

Ethiopia and Italy continue to expand and deepen their bilateral relationship, harnessing both traditional diplomacy and cutting-edge industry collaborations. This dynamic partnership is evident in recent high-level meetings, robust aviation initiatives, and strategic discussions centered on regional stability.

# Diplomatic Engagements: Building Bridges

Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali met with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni at Palazzo Chigi in Rome. Their discussions focused on strengthening bilateral ties, enhancing multilateral cooperation, and exploring new investment and economic partnership opportunities that benefit both nations. In a symbolic gesture that underscored the human connection between the peoples of these two countries, Abiy also held a private audience with Pope Leo XIV at the Apostolic Palace, where talks about global peace and cooperation took center stage. During this meeting, Abiy presented the Pope with Ethiopian coffee—a gesture that resonated with historical significance and cultural pride.

# Regional Priorities: The Horn of Africa and South Sudan

Beyond high-level diplomacy, Ethiopia and Italy have been engaging in discussions on issues that shape the broader regional landscape. One focal area has been the Horn of Africa—a region of immense strategic importance. Italian engagement in this region aligns with its broader strategy of addressing economic cooperation, infrastructure development, migration policies, and security concerns.

In addition, there have been substantial talks on regional security relating to South Sudan. Both nations have shown a commitment to strengthening ties not only through dialogue but also via practical measures aimed at economic development and peacebuilding. Ethiopia, a key regional player, has been working to bolster relations with South Sudan while addressing the humanitarian challenges that include rising cholera cases and malnutrition among South Sudanese refugees in Ethiopia—a situation that has drawn international attention and urgent calls for intervention.

# Soaring to New Heights: Aviation Collaboration

On the aviation front, the economic and cultural bonds between Ethiopia and Italy are taking flight. Ethiopian Airlines is actively expanding its routes to Italian destinations, reinforcing trade and tourism ties that bridge Africa and Europe. Adding a touch of historical resonance, Italy has returned the Tsehai aircraft—a once-iconic plane from the Ethiopian Imperial Air Force of the 1930s—to Ethiopia, symbolizing a restored and respectful connection with the past.

Moreover, a strategic joint venture between Ethiopian Airlines and Etihad Airways is designed to enhance regional connectivity between Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. This alliance is expected to improve passenger flexibility, boost cargo operations, and enrich frequent flyer programs, positioning Ethiopian Airlines as a key player in global air travel.

# Looking Ahead

Ethiopia and Italy’s partnership is rooted in shared ambitions—both are keen to leverage economic, cultural, and security collaborations for a more connected and stable future. Whether through expanding aviation networks, engaging in historic diplomatic dialogues, or addressing pressing humanitarian challenges in the Horn of Africa and South Sudan, these groundbreaking initiatives promise a transformative impact on regional development.",1,1748291703.0,WorldDevelopment,6,1.0,False

1kw4rxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1kw4rxw/34m_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection_and/,[34/M] - Longing for intense and deep connection and seeking the casual chat that leads to it,"Hello!

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress - it strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way, while not being totally lost to them.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is inscribed onto one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, and coffee.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. A person who understands that no one will ever be your clone and dares to take exuberant advantage of that fact seems required for the deepest sorts of bonds.**  I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably detailed chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention; anything dazzling will also do. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1748291639.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

I am doing a quick analytics project before i start an internship. The main data source I am using is based on the coffee industry, with my inspiration derived from a Kaggle dataset: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michals22/coffee-dataset/data?select=Coffee\_export.csv)

The data is just export, import, and some inventory data on a country-level basis, so quite high level. I decided to create a business case/scenario, because i think its fun, tests my creativity, and forces me to learn a little about the industry.

In short, my fictitious company is a portuguese coffee trade brokerage that has a focus on facilitating and consulting on trade of specialty coffee. We basically are a Mid-size coffee trade facilitator that connects smallholder exporters, currently in Brazil, with a select few specialty coffee importers (and roasters) across european markets in portugal, netherlands, france, and germany. 

What I have been ""tasked"" to do is determine which coffee-producing and exporting nation to expand our trade facilitation and consulting operations to. We want to expand out of Brazil (where our facilitation is concentrated) to find an emerging market that we can connect importers with. We believe that there could be places with higher margin supply and unique ESG funding, since we have determined that consumers of speciality coffee are more and more demanding traceable, ethical coffee, which could help our PR and put us in the position for NGO partnerships and even grants/additional funding.

I, as the analyst, have decided to create a scaled (z-score), weighted average scoring system that takes into account different categories that are relevant to whether we should expand our business to a particular country AND reporting on whether that country is emerging and ready to produce specialty coffee (think of it as potential). To do this, I decided the following scores were needed to create the ""overall"" score:

1. Feasibility Score: takes into account WGI, LPI, and ease of doing business scores from World Bank data.
2. Coffee Quality Score: Can either be quantitative or categorical, still deciding. I do not want to give a nationwide score really, since a country's coffee quality varies within locations of that country. however, I do not know what else to do. I may just 1-5 it based on academic research of each countries coffee quality.
3. 10 yr export growth, production growth, and total exports/production for 10 year period (CAGR?)
4. Volatility Score (10 year standard deviation; checks for how volatile a country's exports/production has been).

There is some other data that I will consider for the overall score. My biggest issue is assigning weights.

My question is: Does this seem like a decent strategy for the problem I am facing? Is this crap, and useless to show in a portfolio? And have I given enough context for answers to those questions?",1,1748291600.0,data,0,1.0,False
1kw4r4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlInet/comments/1kw4r4s/cant_access_captive_portals/,Can’t access captive portals,"Hi all, I have the GL iNet AX1800 (Slate AX) WiFi 6, and I used to have no problems with captive portals, but now I can’t seem to access any captive portals on public WiFi  (including Costa coffee and other big chains, my current housing that has one, etc). 

I consulted ChatGPT and many YouTube videos, and even factory reset, but to no avail. Here’s what I tried:

	1.	Enabled Login Mode for Public Hotspots in the admin panel.
	2.	Manually opened captive portal URLs in browser (neverssl.com, forced redirect URLs) — they failed to resolve.
	3.   Disabled the VPN 
       4.   In LuCI > Interfaces > WWAN > Advanced Settings, unchecked “Use DNS servers by peer”)
	5.	Had DNS mode on automatic, then manually Reset DNS settings to 0.0.0.0 or 1.1.1.1 multiple times and rebooted — often reverted to 8.8.8.8 after reboot. Also disabled “DNS rebinding attack protection, “override dns settings of all clients,” “allow custom DNS to override VPN DNS”
	6.	Tried different MAC address clone modes.
	7.	Verified firewall settings and forwarding zones in LuCI — nothing appeared misconfigured.
	8.	Disabled IPv6 (wan6) and made sure WWAN was in the right zone with masquerading.
	9.	Factory reset the router and reattempted with clean settings — same result.
	

Despite all this, DNS still fails or the captive portal never appears. I’m stuck in Login Mode with no way to authenticate.

It’s a unique place with a tight-knit local community, a growing remote worker population, and tons of people passing through: road trippers, vanlifers, climbers, skiers, backapckers and folks headed to the next national park. Though, the bulk of our visitors are here for the restaurants, shops and mountain views.  

Through informal market research (mostly word of mouth), we’ve found a clear **need for a laundromat**. There isn’t a good option right now, and people are asking for one. We’ll be starting with:

* New coin/card-op machines
* Basic **wash & fold service**
* Specialty laundering for **down gear, pillows, and oversized items**

While there are many short-term rentals in town, most already have their bedding washed by their rental agencies who have on-site, private washing facilities. So our core focus is locals self-supported travelers who need a reliable place to clean up, local businesses and short-term renters not managed by rental agencies.

We know this will be a **hands-on business**, and we’re excited to create something that meets real needs here. We also want to grow intentionally, with **add-on services that are low-cost to launch** and genuinely helpful.

A few things we’re considering:

* **Laundry pickup & delivery** (down the road)
* A clean, comfortable **self-serve work/coffee area**—since remote workers here have nowhere to meet or work without battling long café lines
* Maybe **vending** or outdoor gear-specific services to support the adventure crowd

**If you’ve launched a laundromat, especially in a mixed local/tourist market, what worked for you?**

* What smart add-ons helped generate extra revenue early on?
* What helped build trust and repeat business in your community?
* What would you do differently?

1kw4o2r,https://v.redd.it/rzqm1demq63f1,Is this the Endgame technique for getting tasty espresso using Delonghi dedica? I have found even channelled shots of this technique to be tastier than any version of with/without blooming the puck while not using the partial opening of steam wand for varying the pressure.,"I have had Delonghi Dedica 685 since November 2024, and after learning and relearning about espresso from YouTube, I have finally settled with this method. Any other method produced sour or striking acidity shots that were undrinkable without adding steamed milk. One step coarser grind did not have channeling at all but this grind size created a better shot. I have attached my brew journal entry at the end of the video(Reddit is not letting me upload another attachment)


Tools and beans used
1. Beans: Rosette Coffee Lab Equinox blend
2. Grinder: Mhw-3bomber R3 (5.4 clicks)
3. Basket: IMS 15-17g 
4. Puck prep tools: 3D printed WDT tool, generic RDT (4sprays), supvox distributor, self-levelling tamper, supvox puck screen 0.8mm thick
5. Timemore black mirror mini scale with flowrate display
6. A mirror to observe the shot and to effectively pressure profile.


The Technique

1. Preheat the basket along with the portafilter over a boiling kettle.
2. Wipe it and do puck prep.
3. Preheat the group head.
4. Fix the portafilter without wasting time, and start the shot with the steam wand partially open to mimic a slow pressure ramp-up.
5. The preinfusion phase and extraction till 10g yield utilises a steady low pressure with a flow rate of ~0.5g/sec to 0.8g/sec. 
6. Slowly close the partially open steam wand by the time 10g yield is achieved.
7. Wait till the 1:2 shot is complete.
8. Stir properly and drink up!

What can be improved: Fixing the pressure ramp-up technique. The initial pressure decrease can be a hit or miss as there is no way to consistently partially open the steam wand in the same capacity every time, which causes channelling often. Although the channelled shots are balanced with medium to medium-dark roasts, the acidity experienced was not at all sharp.

Later, I pulled another shot today that included a 5-6 sec low-pressure bloom. The acidity was not to my liking, it was overpowering and reminded me of the worst espresso shots I had pulled along my espresso journey.

If any changes that can be done altogether or you have come up with a better technique, please do share.

Apologies if this has been asked before, but I’ve searched and searched all over the many ADHD subreddits and used Google (for what it’s worth these days) for the answer specifically to the above titled question.

I am about 4/5 weeks into my Titration program, on 70mg a day. I’ve just recently split my dose between 50mg in the AM and 20mg in the PM starting tomorrow on the advice of my Titration team after I found the 70mg dose made me feel like I was reverting to pre-med ADHD symptoms.

Before I started I was using Macha Powder in a smoothie or coffee and topping up with a TRIP Mindful Blend (Magnesium & Lionsmane + other active ingredients) and the odd TRIP CBD Blend (CBD & Magnesium + other active ingredients) which was managing to help increase my focus throughout the day and aid my relaxation by the evening.

Since starting Titration I haven’t touched any of them, but I’ve been wondering if anyone has any experience with using any of them whilst on Elvanse and if it has had any negative effects or if they know it’s okay to take them (in moderation)?

Additional Info: I’ve also fully cut out Alcohol and Coffee (which never affected me anyway)

I took a couple of weeks & browsed through each one until I found a recipe I wanted to try to make this year. I compiled a list and categorized them into types of meal/course as best I could. 

Although I’m not moving as quickly as I’d like to be, it’s been fun trying some new things! Tonight’s meal will be “Our Burger”, which is a burger, oven-baked onion rings, and a malted chocolate milkshake from the “Date Night In” book. 

If anybody has some of these cookbooks and has a favorite, please feel free to share so I can hopefully start another list for next year! ",24,1748290681.0,CookbookLovers,4,0.94,False

But let’s be real: sometimes even a triple espresso can’t fight off the fog.



So — what’s your emergency go-to when caffeine just doesn’t cut it?

 Cold shower?

 Screaming into a pillow?

 Dance battle with your cat?

 Pretending you’re a robot programmed to finish tasks?



Drop your weirdest and most effective “wake up my brain” ritual.

Bonus points for methods that make your neighbors question your sanity. ☕",14,1748290641.0,Productivitycafe,33,0.9,False
1kw4d04,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1kw4d04/another_venting_for_not_able_to_use_one_time_pass/,Another venting for not able to use one time pass,"I don’t think that forbidden sign ever leaves the front door. Once again, denied. There’s people leaving so I went to the counter and said “I saw some people leaving… just have to ask about the one time pass.. since my flight got delayed again..” already the person at the counter goes off “we are overwhelmed right now and not accepting any…” I said what if some more people leaves? Then she says “you may check back later.” 😞😞😞 (well if I wait around some more it would just be less than an hour before my flight.. not really like I’d need to go in for some coffee and snacks any longer..)
I’d thought the new rules would make club access more efficient for those of us transiting with an hour or two to get freshened up since it only let people use it within 3 hours of flight so people don’t camp there forever. But it looks like even with new rules I could never use my passes ever… who’s been successful using theirs recently? 😭😭😭

And while I’m a bit introverted, I love having a handful of people to form deep connections with. 

I live in California and have a small circle of people I consider myself close to. I enjoy gaming, cooking, writing music, and I know entirely too much about coffee. Also a huge sports fiend. 

I’d love to find some cool people to chat and connect with. If you’re interested, send me a message with a bit about you and where you’re from. ",1,1748290533.0,MakeFriendsOver30,1,1.0,False

This being my first miniature I’ve painted that I’m most unsatisfied with; and it being my favorite mech in game doesn’t help either! 😂🤷🏻‍♂️ Thinned out Agrax earth shade and a light tan paint job was not in my favor.(coffee staining was ridiculous on this) 

Definitely a love hate with this guy, still nonetheless I kept him as is and will be a reminder that not every miniature will go your way! ",110,1748290347.0,battletech,0,1.0,False
